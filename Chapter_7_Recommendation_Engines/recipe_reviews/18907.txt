I made two small changes--I used reduced fat cream cheese and one 4 ounce can of mild green chilies. I did not use fresh jalapenos because I was feeding two little ones and I didn't want it to be too hot for them. That said, this was a huge hit. Everyone loved this side dish. I think I could get by with cutting the butter back by half next time and it would still be just as good.

I made this last night, what a hit! We don't like really "hot" foods so i used 2 cans of green chilies and a splash of red hot sauce instead of the peppers. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was GREAT!!  Thanks Karen

The ultimate test--my DAD!!  He raved over this recipe.  I used frozen sweet white corn (I find that it's not as crunchy and tastes much more fresh than canned, which I just refuse to make) in a heated skillet, no olive or vegetable oil, no butter.  Just cooked the corn, added 3/4ths of a thing of cream cheese, and added the jalapenos.  My family is from Louisiana (Cajun, baby!) so we like spicy things--I added all the jalepenos the recipe called for, and kinda wish I'd added more.  I love that spicy kick to it.  Anyway, was extremely unique--nothing I EVER would have thought to try, so I really enjoyed making it and serving it to my family.  I will definitely give this a try again, although next time will use reduced fat cream cheese to cut out those unnecessary and unhealthy extra calories.  I highly recommend giving this a shot!  Thanks so much for the unique recipe!

This was very good.  I only used 1/4 of the butter, 1/2 of the cream cheese and 2 of the hot peppers and got very good reviews.  Try it whatever variation you like.  I'm a health nut so I cut the fat but not the flavor.

Comfort food indeed. So good you can eat it all week! I use half the cream cheese and for the other half use sour cream. No butter, add 2 cans of Ortega green chilis, sometimes throw in some leftover cooked rice and sprinkle with green onion. Really, really, good.

Very good, did not use that many peppers though - I used less than half. The group I served it to could not get enough, they loved it. Will certainly make this again, maybe even tonight!

Yum , I loved this dish I made it with the salsa chicken on this site by Faye and a great side salad (was out of spanish rice) BUT it went over great. It taste like a jalapeno popper.

I'm a Mexican and I've never heard of this recipe before.  Skeptical but open-minded, I gave it a whirl and was ever-so pleasantly surprised!  Changes:  I used only half the cream cheese & butter, and I sauteed 3 cloves of minced garlic and added that to the recipe in order to omit powdered stuff.  After reading the other reviews I opted to use only 3 (fresh, minced) jalape√±os for something tame enough to share with friends.  So easy and fabulous!  Great recipe!

I loved it.  I served it with enchiladas and refriend beans and made it with half the cream cheese and no chilis.  Very yummy.

Excellent, but very very spicy. I would halve the number of jalapenos next time.

HOT! We used only five jalapenos with two of them seeded and it was still very spicy. We had it as a side dish for Thanksgiving and everyone thought it was excellent. Will definitely make it again.

This comes close to the Corn Crema at my favorite TexMex spot. I had some green enchilada sauce leftover so I tossed it in with the other ingredients. I definitely like the added flavors it brings. I adjusted the jalapeno amount to our tastes. VERY yummy and kudos for simplicity!!!

I strongly suggest removing the seeds, which is the source of most of the peppers' heat. That way, you can enjoy the true flavor of the jalapeno! without overpowering spiciness.

Big hit!  I make this for food days at work and just throw it all into a slow cooker.  Great blend of texture and flavor.  I cut down the butter with the slow cooker...not really necessary to the taste, more to keep the cream cheese from sticking.  I use jarred jalapenos and pour a little of the juice in for some extra kick.  Great for b-b-q and as a side to almost any mexican dish.

I really liked this recipe for corn but the rest of my family was only so-so. Instead of jalapenos, I used a can of green chiles AND I chopped up a green bell pepper and half a red bell pepper. Like I said, I thought it was really good but since I want to maintain a high approval rating with my family, I doubt I'd make this again (at least, when they're around).

Tastes good, but could use some adjustment on the quantities of Cream Cheese and Butter... perhaps half as much of each would help out.

I've been making this for years and it's a family favorite.  It's much better if you use frozen corn instead of canned as you get a much fresher taste.  I've even used fresh corn cut off the cob and it's even better yet.

I've made this recipe twice and the first time I made it, it was a 5 star but the second time-3 stars the difference? - I used canned corn the first time and frozen ones the second time. And believe me, it made a whole lot of difference. Be sure to use  the canned ones as the recipe suggests. mmm.. mmm.. Good.

This was a quick and easy side dish to make. I served with a Taco Salad. My boyfriend liked it but didn't rave about it. I used Green Chilies instead of Jalapenos.

I've made this twice now. The first time, I used the EXACT recipe as written. Too much in the jalapeno to corn ratio, plus a notch too bland (I fully deseeded all jalapenos to dim the heat. I like them for the flavor they bring). The guests liked it, but I felt it left something to be desired and the jalapenos were too crunchy.

The second time was the winner for me. First, I deseeded 5 fresh jalapenos and diced them super fine. I cooked the jalapenos in the butter until soft. I then added one standard size bag of frozen corn. I stirred that around until hot, then added 1 tsp of garlic salt. I then added another 1 lb. bag of frozen corn. Stirred until hot, added an additional tsp of garlic salt. Once hot, I added the 8 oz. cream cheese and stirred it in until melted and everything was blended and hot.

Wow, what a difference! I brought it to a work potluck and everyone was raving, there wasn't a bite left! With a few minor changes this was definitely a winner and I plan on adding to my regular rotation.

This was a huge success as a side dish for our Thanksgiving dinner. Even my 26 year old daughter who has always disliked corn had seconds and requested the recipe. 
And for those who can't tolerate the jalapenos, consider using a small can of diced green chiles instead.

I used a 32 oz. bag of frozen corn.  Threw everything in the pan and it was delicious.  I only used 4 jalapenos.  I like hot food to also be tasty, not just hot.  Ten jalapenos seemed to be too extreme for me.  Again, this was delicious and my company thought so too.  An excellent side dish for any Mexican meal.

A great recipe for changing up your everyday corn.  Thought it was delish and I plan on making it again for sure!  Instead of using ten jalapeno peppers, I used one can of diced green chile peppers and a can of diced jalapeno peppers.  Just enough kick! (This also works well when eaten with tortilla chips and used as a dip.  I know it may sound strange, but it was excellent both ways!)

This was really good but really rich.  That's a lot of cream cheese and butter!  I used canned diced green chilis because we don't like things really hot.  It tasted great!

This recipe is fantastic.  It is incredibly easy AND gets rave reviews.  It is creamy and much more flavorful than any other creamed corn I have had.  You must definitely use the peppers.

I found this recipe when trying to create a "pantry" side dish.  I had frozen sweet corn on hand rather than canned and replaced the jalapeno peppers with a half can of original rotel.  Since it was a side dish and not a dip I only used 4 oz of reduced fat cream cheese and eliminated the butter, but it was DELICIOUS and cut down on the fat and calories!!!!!!!

Delicious!  Only changes I made were to use 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 1/4 less butter, and frozen corn rather than canned.  This is going to go over very well at parties.  Thanks for the recipe!

In theory this recipe is great. one thing to consider is that Jalenpenos vary so much in heat.Generally speaking if you were to add the amount of peppers called for, it would render the dish inedible. I added couple chopped peppers and it was perfect. The recipe calls for too much cream cheese. I added enough to just give the corn some body and it was fantastic.

This is one of mine and my husband's favorite corn recipes! I use jarred or canned jalapenos instead of fresh ones and cut tje amount in half because it was a little too spicy for our taste. Other than that it is delicious!

This rocks - I only had 4 jalepenos at home so I added a small truckload of cayenne pepper.  Excellent, and good added to noodles the next day for a tuna-mex casserole.  Trying with jalep's and poblanos tonight (jalep's don't hang around long enough in this house, even from the garden).  I've never had anything like this at a Mexican joint or in Mexico, but the taste is definetely authentic.  Thanks much for sharing!

Wow, looking over all the previous reviews, it looks like almost everyone cooked up some variation of this recipe. I always choose to trust the recipe creator first, and I made it to spec - using ten chopped fresh jalapenos (not canned, not green chilies), and regular cream cheese (not low or non-fat).
That being said, I thought this dish was just barely okay. I think it's just my personal tastes, since I don't like cream cheese all that much. I love hot food, and this was pretty spicy, and I love creamed corn. This recipe made me think of adding the same jalapenos to a nice creamed corn recipe, but this "cream-cheese corn" didn't appeal to me all that much. Also, I didn't really notice the garlic salt at all - maybe it's not necessary, or maybe more should be added. Thanks anyway for an interesting recipe.

Wow! A winner!!  I had made some camarones y bistec ranchero and needed something to cool it down.  So I made this corn and added "just enough" pickled jalepenos to give it flavor and it was PERFECTO!  Next time I'll add more heat (when I don't have enough heat from the rest of dinner. Thanks Karen!

I made this for a small dinner party and it was a huge hit. It was a bit too hot, though. I used one can green chiles and one can jalapenos, so next time I'll use two cans of chiles. I did cut back the  cream cheese a bit and it was still incredible!

This was an amazing treat. I substituted the canned corn for frozen (added it frozen to the recipe) and I used all the peppers. I served it with Barbequed chicken and Cheddar and Chive Hashbrowns recipe for the crockpot. My husband loved it and I can see it will go with a lot of other dishes, even my mother-in-law's yummy pheasant recipe. Going to serve this often.

I didn't put as many peppers as was called for. This was an ok side dish, wasn't like I thought it would be. Thanks for sharing with us all, always fun to try new things.
The rest of my family loved it! 3 kids, 1 adult.

This recipe is amazing!!! I was a little intimidated by the ten jalapenos the recipe called for, so I only added half. I'm glad I did, five was enough for us.

So delicious!!  Definitely does NOT need the 1/4 c. butter, and obviously the heat varies depending on the potency of the jalapenos, but this is the only way my husband will eat corn.  The whole family loves it.  We add a few tomatillos as well.

I cut the recipe in half and used only 1 can of corn for 2 adults.  I used jalepeno slices from a jar instead of fresh jalepenos.  You only need about 5 slices to get a good heat.  The first time, I used 10an d it was almost too hot to eat.

Tasty! It was definitely a good change from the usual corn recipes we try at my house. I used two jalapeno though, since that was all I had on hand. I was going to add in pickled ones but upon tasting, thought that would have been way too much. It had a good punch without being overwhelming. I sauteed onion (1/2 an onion), garlic (2 cloves) and the jalapenos in the butter, then added the corn. Only needed 1/2 the cream cheese. Turned out really good!! Will be making this again this weekend for guests.

I made 1/2 of the recipe, and it was really good. I was thinking that 10 jalapenos was too much for the whole one so used only 2 in my halfed recipe...but I have to say that it would have been much better with the extra 3! But this is a delish corn. My son didn't care for it too much, he was thinking it was my creamed corn (which is sweet.) But Daddy and mom LOVED it!

So yummy! I slightly modified to use up what I had on hand. Used white/yellow niblets, 1 rounded tbsp of margarine, light cream cheese & 4-5 tbsp. of jarred sliced jalapenos (diced).

It was definitely spicy, but we loved it. I'd say reduce peppers by half if you are worried about the heat. You can always add more!

I have tried this several ways, the first time I followed the receipe exactly and it was too hot for my liking, but my husband LOVED it.  I have modified it to use garlic salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste and it is my favorite mexican side dish.

LOVE THIS! I wanted something quick and different to bring to a dinner and this was it. I made this spur of the moment and didnt have any jalepenos, I added a 1/2 cup finely diced onion and some cayenne powder and crushed red pepper...fantastic! I will be trying with jalepeno next time.

Made this as a Turkey Day side and it was a huge hit.  I used green chiles instead of jalapenos so that everyone could enjoy - and they really did.  Of all the dishes I brought, this is the only one that came home with an empty dish.  Will be making this again and again.

Very good. I didn't have the jalapeno peppers so I just added one chopped green pepper and a tsp of ground red pepper spice. It gave it a little bit of a red speckled look and also a kick that I am sure the jalapenos would have done equally. wow. It was a little too hot for me so I just scooped it with tortilla chips (a good dip too).

I've been making this recipe for a while and everyone loves it. The only thing I do different is half the cream cheese, because the few times I made it with all the cream cheese everyone said it was way too much. Other than that a fast, easy and delicious recipe.

This was fantastic.  It wouldn't be an allrecipes review if I didn't mention my changes.  But really all I did was use green peppers and add the standard taco spices- cumin, chili powder, garlic, onion, etc.  It will be present on our table often.

Great idea - I used frozen corn and no butter, but the reason I didn't give this 5 is because it needs more herbs, maybe some chili powder and pepper and it would be phenomenal. Otherwise great great idea for serving up corn.

I am a huge corn, jalapeno, and cheese fan.  This was right up my alley.  Will make again, and again.

This was actually good. I halfed the recipe and used already sliced jalepenos in a jar and just cut them up from there and I also added cilantro.

I made this for the first time last night and I have to say, it definitely is a twist to the same old side dish to go with a mexican themed meal.  I didnt really change anything except added a little bit of cumin & chili powder to add a little more flavor.  I also cut the cream cheese, only used to achieve the creaminess.  All in all a good side!

I made this for about 25 people. Followed the recipe and then added about half a small jar of cumin and it was fantastic. It's a great side dish to wake up a meal

Was a little bit too spicy for me, but luckily my boyfriend likes it hot! He ended up eating the entire pot of the stuff, so you can thank him for the four star review (personally I'd give it a 2).

Love this recipe! Living in Norway, I use a lot less chili (since most people here are not used to really spicy food). I also use jarred, sliced jalape√±os, and add some salt, pepper and whatever I feel like.

very good.  Took it to a Mexican luncheon at work, and everyone loved it.  Next time I will cut the cream cheese to 6 oz. so it's not so watery. Otherwise followed recipe exactly and it was delicious.

Very good & very easy. I used frozen corn - didn't even cook it first - threw everything in at once. Also used jarred jalepeno peppers - just happened to have them on hand. Definatly not "healthy" veggie dish, that's why it was so yummy.

I had this a couple of years ago when my sister's friend made it. I really liked it and knew I could find a recipe for it here. It turned out the same except less spicy since I only put in four peppers as requested by other members of my family who do not like really spicy food. I used 4 cups of frozen corn that I cooked prior to adding the remainder of the ingredients, serrano peppers since they are all I always have on hand, neufchatel cheese since it has fewer calories and ommited the butter for less fat and I did not feel it really needed it, I think it would have made it greasy. Served with the country fried steak from this site, mashed potatoes and a salad.

I was invited to a Memorial Day Cookout. So I tried this recipe for the 1st time and took it with me. Everyone loved it, and wanted the recipe. It was a big hit. I made it as the recipe said, only I add minced garlic, diced onions and mushroom.

Oh my!! This is just excellent!  I cut the recipe in half and only added 1 large, seedless jalepeno (which was enough for us) and we absolutely loved it!  Thanks so much Karen, this will be put into our regular rotation for sure!

I WAS A BIT SCRARED TO TRY THIS BUT I LOVED IT....I USED FROZEN CORN IN THE MICRO AND ABOUT HALF WAY THRU COOKING I ADDED THE OTHER INGREDIENTS. I ALSO USED FAT FREE CREAM CHEESE AND BUTTER BUDS TO KEEP THE CORN LOW IN FAT...A DEFINITE KEEPER.

Great combination.  I could not believe how smooth and creamy it was.  The crunch of the frozen corn was a great contrast.  I served it with burrito pie from this site. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers, I used a 32 oz bag of frozen white corn, only 3 oz of cream cheese, 4 T of minced fresh jalapenos (seeds and all), but I did add a couple more tbls of butter.

This recipe was great.  I didn't add the butter because I didn't see the need for it.  Left out the garlic salt too... My husband doesn't like garlic.  And used 1/4 cup diced jalepenos from a jar (pickled jalepenos).  It was great.  Along with this I made the Spanish Rice II recipe from this site and Chicken Enchiladas.  My guest raved.  And the rice and corn complimented each other very well.

This was delicious!!  I used canned diced jalapenos half and half with canned diced green chilis.  It was very spicy.  You could probably use all green chilis to tone it down a bit.  May even try a different vegie next time!

This was okay - I used 2 small cans of hot diced jalape√±os, next time I will only use 1 can. For me there was too much butter and cream cheese. I think you could use 4 ounces of cream cheese and it would be better. My fiance really liked it though.

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I used frozen corn, a small amount of sour cream, chopped hot pepper, some chopped green and red pepper, and garlic powder and salt. This still came out really good. Next time I want to add onions!

I made this according to the directions and was overwhelmed by the cream cheese.  I might have given it a better rating if I had used 1/2 a block as other suggested, but I like to run through the recipe and rate it as written before I go making changes.  In any case, I probably won't make this one again as the family didn't like it much.

This was just delicious!  The only change I made was to use fresh corn that I cut off of the cob (because that is what I had left over from another meal!)

I thought this was very good but had a little too much cream cheese.  Other than that was very good.

I used half the peppers, and the taste was wonderful. SO easy to make, and a wonderful tasty side dish. My kids ( teenagers) devoured every bite..

I sauteed fresh garlic and the jalepeno peppers in olive oil, then added the corn and cream cheese and a pinch of salt.  Very tasty.  Kind of reminded me of the corn that is sold off of the cart with mayo and parmesan cheese.

I only used half the amount of cream cheese and garlic powder.  I think next time I'd fry the jalapenos first to soften them up.  This is a nice, spicy side that I'll be making often, thanks for sharing!

This was a GREAT recipe that i will be sure to use over and over again. I did it alittle different though, I used half the jalapenos, Fresh garlic instead of garlic salt, Half a can of rotel, a pinch of salt and a quarter of an onion. Turned out great. My husband LOVED it and told me to make it more often!!

This was pretty tasty.  I did the green chilis, like everyone suggested since my husband isn't a fan of hot stuff.  It was quite creamy, and I ended up adding twice as much corn.  It's just personal preference though.

This recipe was so good and tasty!  I love hot food but this was ridiculously hot and I only used 3 jalapeno peppers!  I will make again with less peppers.  My family loves this recipe!

This corn side dish, is good but a little tasteless if prepared as directed. I added a little more seasonings and it was great along side ALMOST STUFFED PEPPERS, from this site :)

This was excellent. Family loved it. I added only half the jalapenos, and next time I will use low fat cream cheese and butter. A word to the wise, I made the HUGE mistake of not wearing gloves to seed and chop the peppers. My hands and lips and everything I touched burned all night.

Not really sure how to rate this.  I needed a second dish to take to a pot luck and I had all the ingredients.  Reminded me of a couple of recipes I've fixed including one of my own but it really wasn't all that in book.  I followed the recipe because I didn't have time for frozen corn as others had suggested.  I didn't use fresh peppers because I only had jarred peppers.  It had a kick to it but it wasn't unedible regarding heat so I did okay judging the amount.  Two people asked for the recipe and the firemen in the group said it was was good.  I had eight people in the group and I still had some left but not a lot.  I might fix it again for another mexican pot luck because it was so simple but I'm not sure.  I gave it a three because I was asked for the recipe but for me it didn't knock my socks off.

Wow, so good and so easy.  I used Trader Joes Roasted and and used pickled jalapenos.  I just eye balled it and adjusted to taste.  The garlic salt is a nice addition.

This is very good - I used 11 jalapenos, but will probably tone it down next time to about 7-8. I also forgot the garlic salt but it was still good. I might add Rotel tomatoes next time around. Thanks!

Awesome! We had it tonight and didn't know what to expect but this was amazing. We used 5 peppers and it had the best flavor. You could maybe add a few more if you have taste buds that can handle it! We ate it with salty chips and it made an excellent dip as well.

OMG!  I always have such good luck on Allrecipes, but be careful with this one!  I just made it for a potluck and used only 3 peppers.  I love spicy stuff and my husband eats ridiculously spicy stuff and even with just 3 peppers it's almost inedible.  I am going to just present it as corn salsa because I don't have time to re-make it with less peppers because it definitely can't be eaten as a side dish!  Maybe when the original recipe says 10 peppers they mean of the sliced canned/jared type?

This was awesome except for one thing.  DON"T use 10 jalapenos!!!!  One will be more than sufficient if it is a good hot one.

Cut the butter in half, used frozen corn and used a can of chopped jalapenos.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and this was GOOD and SPICY!  I have been looking for a mexican side dish and I have found it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great, easy to make recipe. I reduced the cream cheese to about half, omitted the butter, added garlic salt and some onions. Tasted soooo good! Very spicy! I also seeded the jalapenos.

Pretty  good.  Used Garden Vegetable Cream Cheese as that was all I had.  I live in Louisiana with my girlfriend who is Cajun and she said it was too hot (that was with the recipe cut in half and only 2 peppers).  I have acid reflux disease and was able to bear it.  I read a review where someone substituted 2 cloves of garlic and some hot sauce.  Definately going to take that route next time.  Best part.  It was QUICK AND EASY.

The best thing about this recipe is you can make it as hot or mild as you like. I don't like fresh jalapenos so I used canned. I sliced up two large jalapenos and mixed in some of the juice along with a few of the carrots and onions. 

My brother LOVES this dish, I am now required to make it once a week!

Tried this just on a whim b/c I needed a "mexican" side dish.  Everyone seemed to like it.  I did cut down the amount of peppers to 5 and didn't add any of the seeds.  It was still way to hot for me but I will fix it again with less peppers.  Also used fat free cream cheese and it melted down fine.  It does need some kind of added color though so maybe adding diced red bell peppers would help.

UPDATE: I used cream cheese this time and added some chopped jalapeno with the canned mexicorn, mmmmm, it's so much better. 
ORIGINAL: Quick and easy to fix. All the other recipes called for baking for 35-40 minutes or more. I needed a fast recipe and found it. I used mexi-corn with the green and red peppers already in it. I used Pepperjack cheese b/c I only had a little cream cheese and left the jalapenos out since they were in the cheese. This went well as a side with the mexican casserole I served.

I made several alterations to this recipe based on other reviewers comments.  I used a bag of frozen white corn, 2 tablespoons butter, 3/4 package cream cheese, 2 jalapenos and 2 cloves garlic.  It wasn't great, wasn't bad, my husband didn't like it but I thought it was ok.  I'll make it again but with much less cream cheese, as I felt it was overbearing.  I originally intended to use 3 jalapenos but chickened out while chopping, only using 2, but felt like it could have used more.  I think jalapenos loose some flavor and spiciness during cooking. Definately unique and has potential, but not as recipe is posted, not for my taste atleast.  I will use more spices next time, probably chili powder and cumin.

I did not like this recipe at all. I give it two stars because my boyfriend ate what was on his plate, said it wasn't horrible but did not go back for more, which he usually does. I thought it was lacking in flavor. I only put three jalapenos in because I think ten is way to ambitious. But that wasn't what it was lacking. Maybe it was the fat free cream cheese I used? Who knows. I think maybe this would be okay cooked in a slow cooker for a couple of hours. I only say that because I have a similar recipe that uses that method, only without the jalapenos. Thanks anyway!

Loved it!  I used canned Jalapenos though, didn't drain them, maybe that's why my corn came out kind of watery.  All in all, was a great dish!

Maybe i just didnt do this recipe right, but i couldnt get everything to mix! Ended up with pools of butter or cream cheeese and corn dotted around in it. The taste was okay but not very interesting, really oily too.

Love this dish!  My church group was meeting and having taco night, so I offered to bring a side dish.  This was perfect.  The casserole dish was emptied out and mouths were satisfied.  This is a keeper -- a great marriage of creaminess with sweet and heat.

I also added some pepper jack cheese cubes for extra "goo".  Wonderful comfort food!

We loved this recipe!  Was looking for something to add to chicken enchiladas and found this!  What a surprise!  The only change that I made was using a can of green chilis instead of the jalapenos as our 2yr old was eating too!   Was a great success!  A current fav in our household! 
One night to "jazz" up a otherwise boring dinner I took the idea and used a can of mixed veggies instead of corn... then added shredded cheddar cheese right at end of cooking time..They loved that too!  Great way to excite a meal!

I love this recipe!!!!  I would make it every night if it were not for the cream cheese:)

I like the recipe the way it is, but I now add mushrooms and black beans.  I even added some frozen peas.  I followed other users advice and add canned jalapenos and green chilies. Such a great dish!!!!

Because I was serving this for Thanksgiving dinner, I followed the advise of previous reviewers and cut the cream cheese and jalapenos by half for my unadventurous inlaws. YUMMMMMMMMMM.  The corn was FANTASTIC!  Next time I think I'll try the recipe as written and keep it all for myself.  :-)

I don't like corn, so I didn't try this, but my roomates loved it.  I didn't have any garlic salt, so I just minced fresh garlic & added salt & pepper.  They mixed it in with some spanish rice & said that made it even better.  I will definetely make this again!!

I used a 28 oz bag of frozen corn rather than canned corn, neufatel cheese rather than cream cheese and two cans of diced green chilis rather than the jalapenos.  It was easy to make but tasted too sweet when it was done.  I tried adding extra garlic salt to it but it didn't help to reduce the sweetness.  I don't think I'll make this one again.

This was very good and had a different twist.  It is similar to the creamstyle corn that mom use to make. I got great reviews when I took it to a small gathering.  I did make a few adjustments--I cut the recipe in half and I substituted one bag of frozen corn instead of the canned corn and I only used one jalapeno.  I am definitely making this again!

Everyone loved this, although some complained it was a little too spicy.  I thought the spicyness was fine, but there was too much creamcheese.  I would halve it next time and the butter too.  I think this would be a great idea for a spread for corn on the cob as well; maybe next time, I'll cream the cheese, jalepeno and salt and spread it on the cob, sounds tasty!

This left much to be desired. Took to a mexican dinner party and it was not a hit :(   (Mexican friends there as well)
Made it as written, then I made it again and added paprika and diced green chiles to give it some more flavor and still not impressed. Next time I'll try a corn casserole or a black bean/corn salsa.

Not all I had hoped for. Way too much butter and cream cheese (didn't realize that was possible until now! :) ) and even with the garlic salt and jalapenos it was just bland.

I used fresh cooked corn which I cut off the cob and mixed remaining ingredients and it was WONDERFUL! So flavorful with the lightly cooked jalapeno peppers!
I will start adding this often to my rotations. Thank you for th recipe.

This was wonderful and a such a nice change from the usual refried beans that I normally make as a side dish with my chicken enchiladas. The changes I made was to half  the recipe since it was just for my husband and myself, and replaced a 4 oz can of diced green chilies instead of the fresh jalape√±os. So good!

I needed to use up an extra large 6.6lb (106oz) can of corn.  I was doing a taco bar for a youth group and decided to try this recipe.  I hate creamed corn so I was concerned from the pictures this would turn out similar.  I modified the recipe by using the extra large  can of corn, fully drained, added the one stick of cream cheese, 1/4 c butter, 1/2 c chopped jalape√±os, 1/2 c chopped fresh tomatoes (mostly for color) garlic, salt, pepper to taste.   It turned out perfect.   The kids enjoyed it, it wasn't too hot, and it was not "saucey" at all.   I will make this again.  Next time I will definitely use frozen corn as canned corn is just too mushy.

I wasn‚Äôt sure what people would think about this recipe since we live in CA and are accustomed to authentic Mexican food. I have to tell you, people RAVE about this dish!! I do tweak it a bit based on who is eating it - like swap the jalape√±os out for mild green chiles when needed, or add some additional spice with chili powder, pepper and some spicy mrs dash. I have received nothing but compliments (reminding them of their grandmother‚Äôs recipe or just how good it is and that they can‚Äôt stop eating it!) and requests for the recipe - and always ALWAYS end up with an empty dish no matter how much I make!

I threw this together at the last minute (in the microwave!) and it still turned out great.  I cut the recipe in half, as there were only three of us.  Since I didn't have any fresh jalapenos on hand, I replaced them with a small can of diced green chilies, drained of excess liquid.  I will definitely make this again, probably with frozen corn (which I personally prefer over canned) and fresh jalapenos.

Made this for a catered lunch for a crowd of 70. Tripled the recipe and then kept it warm in a crock pot. Every last drop vanished! I did not use jalape√±os, added lots of chopped green onions instead. Fabulous & couldn‚Äôt be easier!

I followed the other reviewers' tips to use canned chopped green chiles instead since I was making for a crowd and wasn't sure how much spice they liked.  I will make this again but will use the jalepenos -- it needed a bit of spice.  I might reduce the cream cheese by 25% though and only use 3/4 of a block.

Excellent!! Ended up using 3 jalape√±os (instead of 5) for a serving of 3, and found that it was plenty.

Great new way to enjoy corn! had this with chicken tacos and good amount of spice. reduced recipe to 1 jalapeno and used frozen yellow corn for quick and easy prep. Not the healthiest but you can adjust as you see fit

Everyone loved this dish, but only after I drastically altered the amount  of corn.  I put all the ingredients together per directions and there was more cream cheese than corn.  Fortunately I had another can in the pantry., so I added it to the mix.  It was still too much cream cheese but it was OK  and  everyone ate it until it was gone.  Next time I will only use 4 oz. of cream cheese.

Don't give up on this recipe because of the Jalapenos.  Just clean them and soak in 7-UP (not diet) from 45 min to 2 hrs. The longer you soak the less the heat.  But 45 min should be just right for most folks.  Tip: Don't drink the soda afterwards!
Also use fresh corn off the cob, it makes a difference.

Followed the recipe almost to the letter (used a couple fewer jalapenos), and this was incredibly bland! This recipe would need some SERIOUS adjustments -- cheese, spices, I don't know. This was a total disappointment.

This was ok, not exactly what I was looking for.  I used 5 huge jalapenos, but there was no heat even though the ones I  picked out should have been hot, next time I'll include some of the seeds.

Update, I used 5 jalapenos with the seeds included, and 4 cloves fresh garlic. It turned out really well and everyone loved it!

I made this for a potluck at work and it was a big hit! Super easy and delicious! Doesn't need quite that many jalapenos, though--I made a double batch and only used 6 md-lg jalapenos and it was nice and spicy!

Since I made enchiladas I thought this would be the perfect side. I did not use the peppers but added some mild tomatoes from a can. I also used seasoned salt as well of garlic salt. This is the second time making it and it was very good.

Very simple and yummy recipe. Maybe cut the jalape√±os down to 5 and a little less cream cheese. You can add some ingredients to experiment with, but overall it was good, cheap and easy to make.

Corn is in season so why not use fresh, right?  So I lightly grilled 4 ears of corn on the grill.  Cut it off the cob and ended up with 2 cups of corn, b/c 2 cans = 3 cups.   So I ended up using 6 ounces of Cream Cheese 3 Tablespoons of butter and I used 3/4 of a fresh Jalape√±o seeded and chopped and 3/4t of garlic salt.  After cooking for 10 minutes, I added just a bit of milk to thin it out a little.  I made this as a side for my carne asada tacos.  Super Super Yummy!!!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

This recipe is alright. 
If you're counting calories, i wouldn't recommend it and using 'low fat' cheese just doesn't do it. 
The best way to enjoy this corn is to use natural corn. Corn still on the cob and wrapped in the husk has a taste that canned and frozen corn just don't.  
Also, we eat this with Mayo, Parm cheese, Chili powder, Lemon pepper, Lime, Butter, and a Homemade hot sauce. Perfect everytime(:

Not sure why people are complaining it's bland when it has 10 jalape√±os in it! My mom doesn't like her food too spicy so I only put 1/2 of one large one in and it was still very good though we both agreed we should have added the entire pepper. It was very creamy and even without the salt (we just used powdered garlic), it was flavourful. However, I did use it as a topping/sauce for chicken breasts I seasoned with cumin so that probably gave it a bit more of a taste. Just dumped the corn mixture over cooked chicken breasts and threw them back in the oven to warm the topping. Ate it with buns. Definitely keeping corn around to make this again!

I loved what I made, inspired by this recipe.  I kind of followed the recipe, but I only used 1/2 as much cream cheese and no butter and no peppers.  Basically, what I made was:
2 cans of corn
1/2 stick of cream cheese
1 teaspoon of garlic powder
It tasted wonderful.

Made this exactly as directed and I gotta say, it wasn't all that hot.  I used 8 jalapenos because that's what came in the package.  Tasted great though and hubby even liked it. He who usually hates all things with corn in it.  So will repeat.

I made a few changes: fresh corn on the cob, about 4 ears, used 1/2 the amount of Jalepenos (only had 5 left from our garden), added a few sprinkles of cumin, and a dash of red pepper.  It got rave reviews at the dinner table! It is now going to be a taco night staple, it was a fantastic way to top our tacos! c:

So delicious!! I only had 2 fresh jalape√±o peppers on hand. Wish I had more! My family loved it and said more jalape√±os would be great!, I say to taste. Next time I'll do 5.

Tasty, but too much cream cheese.  I used 2 4oz (I think?) cans of diced green chilies instead of the jalapeno.

Pretty good stuff, and it wasn't too spicy at all. Even my daughter, who avoids hot spicy foods, liked it. The only change I made was to use 4 large ears of fresh corn rather than the frozen.
Update: I've now made this recipe several times. In hopes of making it even healthier, I have begun using half the cream cheese called along with an equal amount of Greek yogurt. It's terrific! Next time, I'm thinking of adding some chopped red bell pepper, mostly for the added color.

The final result was a 5 star, but the recipe as written doesn't make sense to me. I followed, up until 10 fresh jalape√±os.. I make everything pretty spicy, but the proportions would have been more jalape√±os than corn. I only added 2 jalape√±os, and that was enough.  Maybe 3 at most. It bothers me that the most helpful reviews didn't even follow the recipe and used green chiles..Those people should not have rated this 5 stars, considering they didn't follow the recipe. Oh, I also added grated Parmesan because it needed more flavor.

I omitted the butter and added 1/2 reduced fat mexican cheese blend and replaced the jalepenos with canned chilis.  Not bad at all after adding a little more regular salt!!

This is one of my favorite go-to sites for recipes and I have served my family many delicious meals I found here but this recipe IS AWESOME!  I had last minute dinner guests and was searching for a side dish with a SW theme.  I had a bag of frozen corn and ran across this recipe and the rest is history!  Everyone raved and I'm addicted!  Making it again for dinner tonight.  The spice of the jalape√±os is balanced by the cream cheese and sweet corn.  Simple and delicious!

My husband and I both have iron stomach's and it's hard to make a dish too hot for us.  I almost think 10 jalapeno's is a misprint.  I noticed many used pickled jalapeno's. I only use fresh.  I used two (instead of the 10 called for in the recipe) and it was PLENTY hot.  (I did not de-seed.) This is now a "regular" in our household.  Yummy!

I have taken this recipe to a pot luck 3 times. I have gotten great reviews but I did change it a little. I used a 32oz bag of frozen corn, and a large can of green chili's the second and third time I took it.  It was big hit with green chili's.  Not so hot. I also added salt and pepper.

I made this but doubled the recipe and added things. I used 4 cans corn, 16 oz. cream cheese, 3/4 cup milk (1/2 c. & added extra 1/4 cup when mixture looked too dry), 3/4 cup butter (again, added extra 1/4 c. when too dry), 1/2 onion (diced), 1 lg. red bell pepper (diced), 5 jalapenos w/seeds from half of them, garlic powder, some salt, 1/2 tsp. hot chili powder. I sauteed the veggies w/out corn in pan and cooked cream cheese, milk, & butter in another pan. Then, I added it all together w/ the corn (drained) and baked in oven. Toward the end, I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the top of it. Delicious! It paired awesomely with bbq grilled chicken.

I tried this recipe almost exactly as is.  However, after putting in 6 chopped jalapenos, seeds and all, it was so spicy that I could hardly get it down (and I love spicy food).  So, if you intend on putting in all 10 jalapenos, make sure you cut the seeds out and really, I still think 10 jalapenos is twice of the amount that should be in this recipe, even for people who love spicy food.  Also, I threw everything into a slow cooker and it was awesome!  Great recipe!

We liked it very much. I made this for a diverse group so I cut the jalapenos to half and I added a drained can of rotel (mostly for color) and I didn't feel the canned corn I used was sweet so I added a tablespoon of sugar.  There was a nice crunch in the fresh jalapenos that we really enjoyed and everyone liked it.  Thanks!!!!

Quick, easy and delicious.  I found Philly jalapeno cream cheese in my grocery store which makes this dish even easier--no need to cut up a jalapeno unless you want to.

Delicious!  Made exactly as written (excluding only the butter) taste-testing along the way.  Very good as is but replacing half the cream cheese with half an avocado, and adding a minced onion, minced garlic (instead of the garlic salt), a diced tomato and some cumin and chili powder take it over the top.  We eat it as relish or a dip for tortillas.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Loved this side dish! I did add green chillies to mine & left out the garlic. I used a can of mexi corn only to make this a more festive dish. My son is not too big on corn but loves mexican & he asked for a second helping.

This is an excellent dish.  But I only used two jalapeno peppers, and it was almost too hot to eat.  We northerners aren't used to so much heat!  I can't IMAGINE 10 peppers in it!

I made this for a cookout and it was a big hit.  Made "as written"  but since my jalapenos were large I only used 5 and it was Hot! and so yummy!  Everyone loved it.

We are spicy food LOVERS! I used 6 fresh jalapenos, trying to make it not TOO spicy for those in the family who do not like very spicy food, and it still came out incredibly spicy.My boyfriend and I loved it... but we were the only ones who could eat it. I reccomend using only 2 jalapenos for those who only want a little kick.

This was good! I halved the recipe and used 1 can of mexicorn instead of regular corn. I didn't use any jalapeno peppers because my little guy was eating this too, but I will definately add some next time to give it a nice zing! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is really really good. I had more cream cheese than corn, but it was still good and that's probably because I used a small bag of frozen corn instead of two cans. I used pickled jalapenos because I didn't have fresh. Will probably make this again!! Thanks...

Good recipe - I found that after I had followed the recipe exactly, I would make it a bit different next time.  The dish was VERY creamy - almost too rich, and my husband said it would be good even without adding the cream cheese.  I also added half a chopped red pepper for some color, and halved the amount of jalapenos.  I would definitely make it again, but with no or less cream cheese.

This was so yummy! Last time I made it I used 2 cans of green chillies as suggested by another review just because we had green chillies on hand. I will be making this again next week and plan on using jalapenos. I would also suggest using frozen or fresh corn instead of canned, so much tastier. Absolutely can't wait! Thanks for the recipe.

I only used 3 1/2 jalapenos and could only BARELY taste any heat.  Will use more if not all next time.  First time for this recipe and decided to get Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn...OMG!!!!!  Used a bit less cream cheese and butter but ended up having to add a bit of sour cream to make it creamier.  I sampled a bit too much of the cream cheese...oh well.  The roasted corn made it indescribably delicious.  Can't wait to tackle the few leftovers I had.   My new favorite side dish!!

made this last night.  It was really simple and had a great taste.  Didnt have canned green chilis so I just added a chopped tomato.  I only used 4 jalapenos (ours were really hot) and 1 can of corn (i cook for 2) and next time I will use less cream cheese because it didn't need as much as the recipe calls for :)  Overall very flavorful and I will be making it again.

This recipe was very good!  The only things I changed were that i didn't add jalapenos, and instead used diced chiles and i only added about 3/4 of the cream cheese.  Even with using less of the cream cheese, it was still very creamy!

This was so-so. Not my favorite side by far. Made 3 servings for my bf and I to serve alongside Spicy Garlic Lime Chicken (by C. PEREZ). My only changes were to use a 3 oz. block of cream cheese and 3 lg. jalapenos (instead of 5). I didn't care for the "sour cream" like taste. My bf thought the dish tasted no different than a can of corn with some cream cheese (he couldn't taste the jalapenos and said that it was very mild). Perhaps using 5 jalapenos would have given this more flavor / heat??? Regardless, I will not be making this again to find out! Sorry : )

This was absolutely delicious.  To make it for people who don't like things super hot I used just one jalapeno slice chopped very fine and then diced half a green bell pepper very fine to give it a little colour.  Yummy!

This was awesome! Creamy and cool, mixed with the sweet spicy og the peppers. I modified and used only frozen sweet corn, and I cut up one red and one green bell pepper because I didn't want it smokin' hot! It was perfect paired with the awesome burrito pie that was spicy and hot! I will make this again for sure.

I love this recipe!  I also only used 1 jalepeno (I know I'm a wimp), but everyone loved it - even my husband who can't stand cream cheese couldn't get enough!

This corn is soooo good! I took another reader's advice and used 2 cans of green chilies and hot sauce instead of the peppers. It came out perfect! It is definitely a nice side item to any Mexican dinner. This is a keeper for my family!

This was very, very good! A great side dish for a Mexican-inspired meal. I didn't have any jalapenos, so I used a can of diced green chilis. I decided to omit the butter, it just didn't seem necessary and I used about 3/4 of a block of fat-free cream cheese. Yum!

This recipe went 50/50 at a recent get together.  Half raved over it and half thought it was way too spicy!  I guess I'm in the ladder half as I could have been happy with half the jalapenos suggested.  My husband on the other hand could not get enough!  Overall this is a very easy dish that could easily be modified based on how spicy you like it.

Def. do not forget the jalopenos for flavor, otherwise this dish is very boring.  Mixing it with a spicy, dry mexican dry dish is you best bet after comepletely cooking both dishes.  I would also recommend putting in less of the cream cheese.

I've made the Mexican Corn several times for parties.  I only use 5 jalapenos for a little flavor (most folks don't like it too spicy), and I find that leaving it simmering on the burner adds to the flavor!

My friend loved this, although I thought it was too hot for me. I think cutting down on the jalapenos would bring out the rest of the recipe better. I enjoyed the texture of the corn and cream cheese. An easy side dish, will make again.

We used this and subbed a 4 oz can of green chilis for the jalapeno's. There was a lot of cream cheese so I ended up using 3 cans of corn. Pretty good as a side dish. Very rich and fattening!

I was cooking for guests coming for dinner. I doubled everything except the cream cheese and I put the jalapeno peppers(from a jar) in the food processor. I only used about 2 tablespoons of the peppers and it was a perfect sweet and spicey blend. Everybody liked it especially me because it was so easy,quick and tasty. It complimented the grilled mahi mahi and rice well.

Very hot! I used jalapenos from a jar and probably didn't use more than 6 slices. This was to hot for me and I like spicy food. I really liked the flavor though. Very creamy. I did use lite cream cheese, but doesn't seem to change the flavor of anything much. I will try next time with green chilies and onion powder and another time with fewer jalapenos. And maybe serve with a not so spicy main dish.

It's not a bad idea, but it's not so good that I'll make it again. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but I couldn't imagine it with more cream cheese and butter. I used one can of corn (the kind with green and red peppers mixed in), 1/4 pkg cheese, 1 tbs of butter and a small can of diced green chiles plus some dashes of hot sauce for spice. I liked the flavor, except the cream cheese was almost overpowering the whole thing.

I love mexican food - but this was MUCH too hot for my taste.  We barely ate 4 bites of it and didn't bother trying to save it for leftovers.  I didn't even put 10 jalapeno peppers in - I only usesd 3.

After reading all the reviews, I did the following:  halved the cream cheese and butter, used two cans of green chiles instead of jalapenos and omitted the garlic salt.  Conclusion:  was missing the kick I thought it would provide.  Wasn't necessarily bad, but really had no more flavor than regular buttered corn.

I halved the recipe (and halved again the amount of butter called for, only using one tablespoon) and I was very happy with how everything turned out.  I like spicy food and the spiciness of this was enough to give it a good zest but certainly was not overwhelming.  I also used non-fat cream cheese, with apparently no negative effects.

My husband and I really liked this!  My boys weren't wild about it, but they don't like anything new, anyway.  I chickened out, and only used 1 jalapeno, and took others' advice to try low-fat cream cheese.  Next time I make this, I will use 2 or 3 peppers.

This has amazing flavor. It is a little hot but you can just cut down the peppers or use green chiles instead. I also added some onion powder. Very good.

So simple, but yet so good. I did cut down on the jalapenos, just because my children were eating it. and I used jarred jalapenos instead of fresh. My husband said, we're keeping this recipe forsure, and he usually isn't a huge fan of corn.

This was an easy side dish that went well with our fajitas.  If you like spicy food, give this a shot.

This is very good, but also hot.  A little too hot for some of my guests.  They all agreed that it was good, but just couldn't handle it.  I will make this again when I have people over that can handle it.

The cream cheese and corn thing just didn't work for me.  I guess that is just a personal preference. As far as ease of cooking and it's ability to go with any mexican dish, it's great.

We just wasnted a quick side dish to go with tacos and this was great!  We grow jalepenos and have a ton, so we used the amount called for.  It was hot, but oh so good!

This was good, but just way too rich for a side dish for us.  I may try again and add some milk to tone it down a bit, less butter and a pinch of cayenne.

Unlike any other corn I've had and that's a good thing. Was a bit too hot for me and I like food spicy. This receipe is a keeper.

I seem to be the minority here...but I thought this was WAY too rich and gooey.  I LOVe spicey foods and I was making salsa chicken (from this site....it was wonderful)so I thought this would go well with it. Maybe this would be better with some diced tomatoes or mixed with spanish rice. My husband and I couldn't eat it though.  Only make this if you really like rich creamy foods.  Sorry but It was nice to try a new recipe for corn.
