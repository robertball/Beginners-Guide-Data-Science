Excellent Fudge.  Here are a few tips
for the success of this fudge.  Line pan with buttered foil.  I used a 13x9x2.  I just prefer a thicker fudge.  Measure out all of your ingredients..and have
them ready to use.  Once mixer has boiled
you need to work fast.  

Use a candy thermometer!  When thermometer reaches 234-240 degrees..
the mixture is ready.  This is more then the 4-5 minutes boiling time the recipe suggests.

Enjoy!

I compared this to the recipe on the jar of Jet Puffed marshmallow creme and this recipe uses way more chocolate.  That recipe makes good fudge.  This recipe makes great, rich, fudge.  My only comment is that you better have a really big pot.  Use a candy thermometer and take the mix to at least 234 F.

Excellent fool proof recipe!  No changes to this recipe.  Be sure to boil 5 full minutes and don't start the timer until the mixture is at a full boil.  Your arm will get a workout -- you have to stir it the entire time.  Mmmmmmm chocolate!

The fudge is good, but you will definately need a bigger pot or split the recipe in half.  Will definately make again.

Tastes amazing - give that 5 stars!  But OH MY!  I guess if you are used to making fudge you might find this easy - but as a novice, I found it incredibly hard! First, it took way longer than 5 minutes for the candy thermometer to reach 232 degrees.  Then it seems like the melting chocolate got thick too quickly. And OMG! How the heck do you get the Fluff out of the jar!  I'm exhausted!

Excellent recipe. I halved the ingredients and it was so good.  Definitely a do-over for next x-mas. :)

I thought this fudge was quite good, though I've tasted some that were better. It seems rather crumbly and not as smooth as I'd like it, but I could've just done something wrong.

I made this fudge and received nothing but rave reviews. It was the best I have ever had. Made great Christmas gifts. I too brought it to 234 on the candy thermometer and put it in a 13x9x2 buttered foil lined pan, which made it easier to remove and cut into 1 inch square. It is so rich and creamy, really good!!!!!!
