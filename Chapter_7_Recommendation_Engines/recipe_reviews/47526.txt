Nice pie, Jenn! IMHO, however, sub FRESH basil for Italian seasoning and FRESH garlic and sea/kosher salt for garlic salt. Maybe cut back on olive oil by half (tough call, I love EVOO).

I've made this pie at least five times, and it's delicious.  Ripe tomatoes.  Tangy goat cheese.  Really good.  Everyone loves it.  I do use a Boboli crust.

pretty good.  Goat cheese can be a bit overwhelming, though.

Yellow tomatoes from my Dad's garden made this an amazing pizza!  I pre-cooked a commercial crust, let it cool, added garlic infused olive oil, a little red sauce, the yellow tomato slices then sauteed sweet onion, mushrooms, red peppers and then the goat cheese (maybe 6 ounces, rather than just 4).  Since the crust was already baked and the veggies sauteed, it was just 8 minutes at 450 degrees. Half-way through cooking I added baby spinach leaves and drizzled a little more of the olive oil so the leaves wouldn't dry out too much.  Such a treat!

Meh, I don't know... There's nothing wrong with this recipe, imo.. It just didn't really do anything for us. I made it, we ate it, we thought it was alright. But we weren't gobbling it up, looking forward to the next time I make it either...

Good. I added a lot more goat cheese. The spice needs to be toned down a bit. Used jarred sauce.

Pretty good!  Needed a little more sauce though.  I added red and green peppers, as well as a hot chili pepper, and it was  a great contrast againts the creamy mildness of the goat cheese.  I'll likely make this again.

This is possibly the BEST pizza I've ever had! My boyfriend and I positively loved it. The sauce is fabulous. I added some roasted red peppers from a jar, and spinach as well. I also had some extra dough, so I stuffed the crust with goat cheese. Definitely will make this again!

I liked this, but my husband hated it. It's really sweet, and more of a dessert pizza really. There's not much I can see adding or taking way to personalize it. I could have ate the entire pizza in one sitting! This will be something quick and easy to make when the husband is away!

It was okay. Something was missing, fresh basil might help but I don't know. It was kinda dry too.

Delicious!  I used pre-made sauce and brushed garlic on the crust.  Easy and fabulous for goat cheese lovers

My review is for the sauce.  This is pizza sauce like it should be.  I didn't have Italian seasoning so used a mix of basil, oregano, thyme and rosemary and I used fresh garlic (a lot).  I couldn't disagree more with those who said it was heavy on the spices - if anything I used more and I thought it was great.

this was wonderful! I cheated and used premade crust, but it was still very good, and easy.
