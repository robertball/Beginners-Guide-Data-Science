This recipie was pretty good, it was a little bland, so I added some more seasonings (garlic powder, more pepper & Basil). I also added more Ham, since I was using it as a main dinner dish, for my self. If I was making it for a potluck I would probably leave the ham amount as is.

This was ok, not great. I liked the abundance of veggies and the extras like cheese and ham, but found the dressing pretty bland. Maybe Miracle Whip in place of some of the mayo or sour cream, or some more spicy mustard. I'll probably play around with this recipe.

We liked this quite a lot.  I left the ham out for the first day, and served broiled ham slices along side.  Leftover ham was diced and added to the remaining pasta salad.  I substituted corn for peas, and added a little granulated garlic and some tobasco sauce to the dressing.  Yum!  Because I like the veggies in my pasta salads to be al dente but not too crunchy, I dumped the chopped veggies (sans green onion and parsley) into the pasta water for the last minute of macaroni cooking, then drained the whole thing, plunged it into cold water, and drained again before adding to the dressing with the green onion and parsley.

This is a great macaroni salad.  I left out the cheese and ham.  They weren't missed. I found it very simple to prepare also.  I will be making this again.

I really liked this salad, it was a nice change to the usuall.  My husband didn't like it, maybe to many veggies for him.  It's a like time consuming, with all the vetables that need to be chopped, but nice for company or to take to a cookout.

This was O.K.  I made it the night before my party thinking the flavors would really develope and all that happened is that there was no flavor.  I had to add a lot of extra salt for this to have some flavor.

well, i'm a picky eater so i hate to make some changes.  i only added sour cream, mayo, mustard, mac, cheese, and ham.
good filling food.  with my own adding and subtracting it's not too bad.
