This was so yummy and hearty. I love yogurt and garlic together and the pine nuts work really well too.

The flavors just didn't come together well on this one.  I won't be making it again.

We love all these ingredients, but this really didn't work well.  The flavor just wasn't right.  We won't be trying this one again.

One of my favourites, but used to do it only with chickpeas. Eaten after 2 hours of chilling is especially yummy. (for those who do not know, this should be eaten with a spoon) Thumbs up!

Ewwww, it was REALLY weird.  Plus, the measurements didn't really seem to fit the dish, it looked awkward and tasted so odd.  We didn't know how to eat it.

Pretty good and basic. I added some sour cream and finely chopped onion to the yogurt mixture. I also suggest using only two cloves of garlic, three is a bit overwhelming.   After placing the chicken in the baking dish, I added finely shredded cheese and baked the dish until the cheese was melted (about 10-15 minutes)and then put the mixture over the warmed dish.  I did not use the beans or the nuts, but instead spread chopped peanuts over the top. Great!

I thought this was a very nice dish to  have in the hot weather.  I do think next time I will add more seasoning, fewer chickpeas and maybe a green veggie
