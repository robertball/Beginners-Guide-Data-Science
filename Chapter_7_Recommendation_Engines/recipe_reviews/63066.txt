WOW - a great cookie - I used Allspice instead of the nutmeg, as I had no nutmeg, and I was short 1/2+ cup of the oats and used flour instead, (which made it a bit more on the "cake" side than I expected), and I added walnuts in the same amount as the raisins, and it really turned out GREAT!

This is a wonderful recipe! I did use cloves instead of nutmeg, just because that's what I had on hand. I also added 1/2 cup of walnuts & would probably add more next time. My kids loved them.

These were great!  I Used whole wheat flour, egg substitute, skim milk, increased the oats to two cups a,d the raisins to 1 1/2 cup and these cookies turned out wonderful.  They are soft and moist.  Just great for a healthy snack!
