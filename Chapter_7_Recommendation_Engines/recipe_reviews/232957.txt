I iked this 1 because it was easy and didn't have any odd stuff that isnt in the pantry in it. I will use this recipe again. Thanks for posting it. Just go easy on the Brown Sugar. Mine turned out on the sweet side.

Very good and very easy! All of the flavors blended well together, and they were just sweet enough. This is coming from someone who was raised on and still uses Manwich, lol...I would def make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I omit the chili sauce because I don't have any and I'm not a spice lover. I also used it for a sauce on meatballs

I don't usually make Sloppy Joe's so I don't really have much to compare it to. My kids liked it. Not sure if I will make this recipe again.
