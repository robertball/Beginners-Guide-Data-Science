This is exactly how we make our smelts every Christmas Eve and they are delicious. The simple flour coating really allows the flavor of the smelts to shine~YUM!

Used panko crumbs and these were perfectly cooked. Between 2 of us we ate a whole pound.

We both really, really enjoyed these. It had been years since I had cooked smelt and I couldn't remember the method, so I was happy to find this recipe. I did find that there was far too much salt and flour than needed. I cooked these in coconut oil, again much less than the recipe called for. Thanks for sharing your grandmothers recipe.

I fried mine in coconut oil, because it was handy. Seriously, this is delish.

I like this much better than the deep-fried version you usually get at restaurants. I added the step of dipping the smelts in egg/milk before dredging in the breading. I used cornmeal because I didn't have flour handy, and added some seafood seasoning. I wish I could give it 4.5 stars, hubby probably would give it 5. :)
I had a few lake perch along with it that I used the same method for, and it turned out good, too.

I added a couple of spices (Cumin and Garlic) along with salt and pepper to give it some flavor.  Just dredging it in flower without an egg-wash first made for a more delicate crust..I liked that.

I used the flour and salt but just couldn’t/wouldn’t use 2 Tablespoons to one cup flour! That’s over 12,000 mg of sodium! They taste great using 1 teaspoon per cup. The lighter colored are  using the flour mixture, those in the picture that are darker are fried using just Italian bread crumbs. Yummy both ways!

It was WAY too salty.  I think it is supposed to be teaspoons not tablespoons of salt. It was like eating fried play doh. Although, they were lightly salted already in the package.

Followed recipe as directed.  They never really got brown and crispy.  Will turn up heat next time.  They were still tasty.  My mom made them often.

Easy and very good! I always think of fried smelts as a Christmas Eve tradition from way back. The amount of salt called for seemed a lot to me, so I cut back to about a tsp and also added  garlic powder (makes everything better). In addition to the blend of oils that I used, I also added coconut oil (unflavored). I'll try all regular coconut oil the next time (as a reviewer suggested -- it sounds good). Cooked for 3 min per side, and that worked well. Definite repeater recipe.

Cooking temp should be higher. Medium high is better. These were nice. I kept the heads on for extra nutrition. I used 1 tbsp. salt instead of 2.

No changes to recipe. Just like I remember eating the ones I caught  in Lake Michigan. Thanks for the wonderful memories,
and the wonderful tasting smelt
