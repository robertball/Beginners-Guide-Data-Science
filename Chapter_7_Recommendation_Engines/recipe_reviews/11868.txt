This was great, but I did change some things to suit my own personal preferences.  I, like everyone else, only used a small amount of oil.  I added about 1 cup of onions and one teaspoon of minced garlic to the oil and butter and cooked over medium heat in a saucepan.  Then I added the basil, pepper, and chicken broth to the saucepan.  Meanwhile I cooked and drained some angel hair pasta.  I decided I wanted the sauce to be creamy, so in a smaller saucepan I made a white sauce with 1 cup of milk, 2 tbsp. of butter, and 2 tbsp. of Wondra flour.  Once that had thickened I slowly stirred it into the onion mixture.  I let it simmer together for a few minutes, added more salt and pepper, then began to spoon the pasta into the sauce until it was just the right consistency.  It was so yummy!  It was super creamy and my husband loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe, Jackie!

This recipe has really good flavor--I did add one clove of minced garlic to the onions when they were nearly browned and I served it over spinach linguine. Quite creative too, I would never have thought of using carmelized onions over pasta but it works for me!  The only reason I am not giving this recipe a 5-star rating is that in my opinion it has a lot more oil and butter than necessary.  It gives it an overly greasy feel. Next time I will cut down on the oil and I am sure it will be more to my taste.

I have debated for months on whether or not to try this...Personally, I liked it but I only used 2 onions - which was plenty for me.  Yes, they shrink down plenty but I still want my goodnight kiss!! I did add some minced garlic and like another, a splash of white wine (which I added halfway through carmelizing).  My daughter wouldn't touch it and my boyfriend picked out half the onions but my roommate and I really enjoyed it - any onion lover would.  Not the best but a quick, easy, and tasty dish indeed!

I first started making this for the times when we were low on groceries or for one of our self-imposed meat-free meal nights. Now I make it simply because we love it so much. This is an absurdly easy to prepare yet deceptively delicious meal. The only change I make is to cut WAY back on the butter and oil (that's the only reason why I ding it by one star); I use just enough butter to grease the pan, and give the onions a little moisture. Oh, I usually use 2 large strong-tasting onions for 2 servings. This is a superb recipe. Thanks so much, Jackie!

This was very tasty.  I added broccoli, garlic, shallots and deglazed the pan with white wine.  I also used stock instead of water.

This recipe was pretty good. I only used 2 onions as was suggested, and I added in a tablespoon of minced garlic. When the onions were almost done I also added in some broccoli and bean sprouts. I also substituted the water for chicken stock. The only thing I didn't really like about the recipe was how greasy it was. Next time I make this I will probably cut the amount of oil in half.

This is really good, I used three large onions, which was plenty, and some fresh garlic.  When I heat up the leftovers tomorrow, I will saute some mushrooms and add to the mix.  Can't wait!

I make this all the time when i am being lazy ...because it is just so easy. I do tend to use a little less onion, usually 2, and i cut down on the oil so it's less greasy, but this is good and simple stuff

Hubs called this “a solid performer” but said he wouldn’t call this memorable.  While there is no right or wrong on this, all things being subjective, I have to disagree.  Taking the time, over low heat, to adequately caramelize the onions gives the dish a rich and assertive flavor with a hint of sweetness.  I didn’t bother with the bouillon and I didn’t miss it.  Those beautiful, golden onions, the basil and a little garlic provided all the flavor I needed.

Instead of bouillion and water, I used organic chicken broth. I used it to deglaze the pan and reduce before tossing in the cooked pasta. Using the full amount of olive oil and butter would have been much, I used two tablespoons of each. My family really enjoyed this. I paired this with Brenda's Chicken Pepperoni Rollups and spinach salad. NOTE: I used whole wheat pasta.

Love Love Love this!  So simple, not many ingredients, and yummy.    I read some reviews and also decided to change some things.  I added 2 extra cloves of garlic, I used about 1/4 cup of oil and about 2 1/2 tablespoons of butter, I used 1 cup chicken stock and 1/2 cup heavy cream...  It was delicious!    Will definitely be making this often.  my daughter loved it as well (only because she has no idea there are onions in there!).

With some modifications this dish was amazing! I decreased the O.O to 3 tbsp and the butter to 1 tbsp (I made this as a side dish and could not waste that many calories or that much fat on a side!) I only used 2 onions and added white wine and garlic as suggested by others.  I  mixed this with whole wheat rotini and yellow squash and zucchini that I had sauteed with the onions.

This was pretty good. I had to make some modifications because I had some leftover chicken that I needed to use. I didn't have any olive oil so I used 2 extra tablespoons of butter. I cut way down on the onion and added garlic as well. I also added some Italian seasoning and my leftover chicken. I used angel hair pasta also. Wasn't bad at all, not my absolute favorite but a good dish to help get rid of that leftover chicken.

It was definitely easy and tasty. I ended up carmalizing the onions and adding chicken and it was even better. My husband can't stop eating it.

I used 2 1/2 onions and 3 cloves of garlic (chopped) in this, and actually I would have liked more onions!  I'm still giving 4 stars because even with more onions I think it would be a bit bland.  I definitely had to add salt and a good amount of parmesan.  Maybe next time I make it I'll try 3 to 4 onions, along with a spash of white wine like a reviewer suggested.  I do think that 5 would be way too much.

Really good! Modified a bit, added a pound of ground beef (My Hubby would have a fit about a no meat meal). Fried the beef, removed from pan and fried the onions. Added the beef back when I added the water and such. Also added some parmesean cheese to the top when served. I really liked it, my Hubby loved it. Will be making it again.

This is a great dish. I was skeptical at first, but I used the advice of many and cut down the oil and onions. I used 1.5 good size onions. I used 1/3 cup oil and it was still too much! I took the awesome advice of another review and made a creamy sauce on the side and then added to the onion mixure and itmade the dish perfect! Also -- I was weary about a no meat recipe... so I added chicken and it was a great addition! I used cilantro instead of basil because I didn't have any. This will be a frequent favorite! My husband loved it! Thanks!

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was delicious! I even shared the recipe with my friend.  I used spaghetti as the pasta and just 1 onion. It was perfect.

I added some kielbasa to this and replaced the chicken bouillon with a 7.5 oz jar of grilled marinated artichoke hearts. The addition of the protein brought the whole dish together for me.

This was really good, though I changed some of it.  I halved the sauce, using only two large onions and chicken stock instead of water and bouillon (didn't have it), but used all the pasta.  Added a clove of garlic, too, but didn't really taste it.  Turned out awesome.

This was tasty but it calls for way too much oil.  I used all the onions and that was good.  I think it would make a better side dish than a main meal due to lack of protein.

What a great recipe! I added mushrooms and garlic. I then browned some chicken and used my pasta water in the onion mixture. I mixed it all togther and served. You can really customize this in a lot of ways.

Try this with half the olive oil, half the butter, half the onions. Add some fresh chopped garlic, 1/2 c. white wine, 1/2 cup chicken broth. Add cooked pasta to pan, toss with fresh grated parmesan, 1/4 cup fresh chopped basil and fresh ground pepper....

Used only a tbls or two of oil, little less butter and only 3 onions.  Deglazed the pan with some sherry after carmelizing onions, added garlic, shrimp & brocolli and it was great, would be great with chicken too.

This tasted great! Make sure you don't skimp on the onions. My mom said it sounded like there would be too many and only put half, but it wasn't enough. Next time I'll have to put in all five. mmm...onions

Very good recipe. I usually make this once a week. The recipe is good enough to stand on its own, but I also find that if I add any leftover meat from previous meals (ex., pork chops, chicken, bacon) it still tastes great and uses up the leftovers.

YUM! I added 1/2 cup cream and sauteed some mushrooms with the onions. Next time I will try adding chopped broccoli and/or chicken. What a great base recipe for cream sauces!

This is a wonderful recipe! A wonderful recipe can be changed to ones personal taste. You have the basic and are able to add and subtract to suit your family or health issues and it still turns out fabulous. I totally recommend this with whatever changes you make to the basics of this. Be sure to carmalize the onions thats the key.

I love onions but this wasn't as good as I hoped.  I used spinach and whole wheat noodles and maybe that was it.  I'd use egg noodles next time.

I used less oil and butter, and less onions too. My husband really loved it and my naturopath told me to eat more onions as I was sulphur deficient, so this recipe is a keeper.

I tried this (for 2) as a change from spaghetti sauce. I wanted to make the (1 large) onion carmelized and that takes a very long time. So the prep is easy but still time consuming. I added garlic, white wine and mushrooms as suggested, used half the olive oil, and vegetable broth instead of water. It was good.

In reading this recipe I immediately thought "What a great starter for a Lo Mein". As other reviewers I decreased the oil to just enough to coat the pan, added 2 TBSP butter, and used 2 onions. Then in addition to the basil and pepper, I added crushed garlic, ginger and a splash or two of soy sauce. After adding the chicken broth, I added broccoli and celery. When the veg was el dente I thickened it slightly with cornstarch and tossed it into cooked Lo Mein noodles (Oriental egg noodles). Served with Teryaki flavoured pork chops. What a great Asian meal. My boyfriend demanded that it be added to our regular rotation. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night because my husband had already eaten dinner and I wanted a simple fix.  The longest part is cooking the onions, but it is still a simple recipe and worth the wait!! Instead of using 1 cup of water I used 1/2 c water and 1/2 c milk  (didn't have any cream).  This made it more creamy and rich.  Even though my husband was already full from dinner.. he just HAD to have a bowl too!  SO GOOD!

This was a surprisingly excellent pasta!  I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but it was delicious!  I did cut back on the oil and butter, and added garlic to the onions in the last few minutes, as well as sauteed portobello mushrooms.  Absolutely fabulous!!  We'll keep this on the menu.  Thanks!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because 2 onions was plenty for 4 people. I liked this recipe a lot, the onions were delicious! The onions took a long time to cook, but it was worth it. I added a bit of butter to the onions after I put in the water and chicken Bouillon just to make it a bit thicker

Excellent recipe.  Be sure to caramelize the onions (takes about 30 minutes) for the best flavor.

Very Good! Took other reviewers suggestion and reduce oil and butter by 1/2 and it was plenty. Otherwise, followed recipe exactly.  Per my husband suggestion, sprinkle crumbled bacon on top -- Delicious!

I made this a few nights ago.  We ate it, but I'm not sure I would make it again.  The taste is good, and I did add some garlic, but it just seemed oily and heavy, even though I reduced the amount of oil. Good way to use up some of these Vidalias, but will stick with my usual garlic sauce on angel hair.

This was yummy!  I made a couple modifications.  My pan barely fit 2 onions, so that's all I used (another would've been much better though).  I also added a clove of garlic, because you can't have pasta with out garlic!  The store was out of dry basil, so I used the Tastefully Simple Tomato and garlic pesto I had on hand.  I didn't have a problem with it being too greasy, but I only used enough oil to coat the onions, so it was probably closer to 1/4 cup.  I also left out the cup of water, and instead tossed the onions in with the pasta, and then added a cup of white wine and cooked for a few more minutes.  This will definitely become a regular dish for us because it was so easy!  If you want to make it an entire meal, it would be great with some shrimp tossed in.

Okay..you have to like onions to like this recipe. I used a mixture of onions..white, shallots, scallions and leeks and I only used enough olive oil to just coat the bottom of my saute pan. Also instead of water I used 1 cup low sodium chicken broth and half a cup of heavy cream. I didn't have basil for some strange reason so I added thyme and 2 TBS balsamic vinegar. I don't like parm so I topped it with pearl mozzarella. I know I changed the recipe around...sometimes I get carried away....

Great base recipe.  I used only 3 large onions. I added;  1/3 package of frozen spinach, 1/3 cup white wine, parsley, additional 1 cup of chicken broth, & a 1/4 cup of canola oil (to cut the strong flavor of the olive oil). I would of added fresh garlic but had none on hand so I used a pinch of garlic powder & pepper.  Came out terrific.  My husband & I Loved it.

I thought this recipe was very tasty, I did add a cup of sliced portabella mushrooms and cut the amount of butter in half, and I also used 1/4 cup of white truffle grapeseed oil and 1/4 cup regular olive oil rather than 1/2 cup olive oil as the recipe calls for. Oh, and I used vegetable boullion as well as chicken broth, and added garlic. Yummy - very simple, and great served over cheese ravioli!

This is very good for onion lovers.  I did need to add more chicken broth so it wouldn't all be soaked up by the onions.  I like to have the "sauce" flavor all the pasta, not just the onions.

Wonderful! My daughter (almost 4) and I loved this. It smelled heavenly. It would be a good side dish too. I mixed sauteed zuchinni and sliced chicken sausage into the leftovers.

Although it sounds delicious, I was hesitant to try this. So I scaled it in half to use as a side dish and it was WONDERFUL! My husband complimented several times. I will certainly make this again! For a main dish I'll probably add maybe mushrooms and chopped tomato, maybe some shrimp. 
Don't be intimidated by all the onions. Once carmelized, they have a sweet, mild, delicious flavor. 
Thanks for sharing your creation!

I love this recipe...I make it consistently, but with additional changes.  I typically cut back on the oil and butter  and  substitute with butter flavor pam.  I also add zucchini, mushrooms, tomatoes, fresh parsley & basil, and top with Asiago cheese. So wonderful and filling.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Like everyone else that has tried this I cut back on the onion and the next time I make it I am going to cut back on the oil. It was a little too much oil. Other than that it was very yummy. My daughter loved it my husband wasn't to keen on it but he doesn't like onions so why would he like it....Very easy to make! You will love it if you love fried onions!

My girlfriend and I made this last night and it was terrific. We cut back a little on the number of onions, but added mushrooms and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Also didn't use quite as much bouillon as called for. Delicious!

I am an onion lover as is my boyfriend. This dish was nothing like I thought it would be. I made it exactly as it says in the recipe.  It just felt like warm... greasy noodles with a watered down flavor? I dont know how to expain it. I wasn't a fan of the basil.  IF I make it again I think I would recommend some minced garlic, oregano or some italian seasoning set, cut the oil/butter probably in half and instead of adding a full cup of water to the bouillon maybe just a fourth so it has a thicker flavor.

This was a very good pasta dish. I served it at a dinner party and received many compliments. I'd recommend seasoning it with salt though, as it might be a little bland for some. It's not a fancy dish, if that's what you're looking for. It's mild, but good, and really hits the spot.

A friend of mine actually told me about this dish and I've had it on hand every since. This has such a simple, yet comforting flavor! It take some time to carmalize, but it's worth it! Serve w/ grilled or sauteed chicken w/ a salad and you're set for a great dinner!

I liked the looks of this recipe because of the simplicity of ingredients. I am a volunteer in the Philippines, so my budget is limited and I really have to stick with local foods.  I was pretty disappointed with this meal--too greasy even though I cut back on the oil,  and just not a lot of flavor.  I am tempted to try it again because it still sounds good in theory and is affordable.  Maybe it will work out better next time.

I loved this recipe.  However I used less oil and only 4 small onions.  I also added Sargento's mozzarella with sun-dried tomatoes and basil shredded cheese blend which gave it great extra flavor.

All I can say is WOW WOW WOW!  This is incredible.  Tastes like I have gone out to my favorite pasta restaurant!  My daughter won't stay out of it until meal time.  I used 2 onions cause that is all I had, added 2 cloves fresh minced garlic and 2 tbls butter and just enough olive oil to streak my pan bottom.  I was wanting to have homemade mac and cheese but this really hit the spot.  Served it with roasted chicken found on allrecipes.  Delish!

I only did 2 onions instead of the 5 and they were plenty! (They were just standard yellow organic onions, nothing special) I used oregano instead of basil (just like oregano better) and added a dash of garlic powder. I used more pepper than the recipe called for. Maybe 1/4 tsp. I liked this quite a bit as an easy recipe when you're low on groceries. I wasn't 100% wowed, but I'm sure I'll make it again.

Well as you can see by my ID...am an onion lover! This was so good...the onions are so sweet they are like candy...it was a little strange eating it with pasta..but we added some shrimp, and it was great!

I was scared at first by the amount of onions, but they did shrink down with cooking.  It took me about an hour to brown them though because of all the liquid in the pan.  I added a few things:  2 cloves of garlic, some white cooking wine, and some grilled chicken (Tyson--frozen).  It turned out pretty good although not great.  The parmasean on top was a good touch.  It reminded me of pasta-roni except with onions in it.

An easy and good tasting dish. I used more spices than what it calls for. I made enough for leftovers for me.

We really enjoyed this pasta!  I followed it exactly, except I did add a huge clove of garlic to the onions about halfway through sauteing them, and I added a cup of chicken broth in place of the water and bouillon.  This is the second recipe I have made lately that has called for a significant amount of olive oil, and the reviews for both have quite a few people saying it is too much.  To each his/her own, but I have to say I think the amount of oil is just perfect for the amount of pasta.  Maybe it is because I really dislike dry pasta, I'm not sure, but I love this as is, and will be making it again!  Thanks for sharing Jackie  :)

My family went nuts over this simple pasta.  They were each calling 'dibs' on the leftovers for lunch.  After reading the reviews, I did cut back on the olive oil (used 1/4 c) and butter (used 3 TB) and will do so the next time I make it also.  There was more than enough oil to cook the onions.  I used a  one pound box of cut spaghetti to make this dish.  We really liked the texture of that pasta with the onions.  I served this with 'Easy Chicken Gyro' from AR and we had a delicious meal.  The next time I am going to try this with fresh basil rather than dried.  The leftovers were just as good as the night the dish was made.  That is always a plus in my book.

I made halve the recipe; read the reviews saying it was too greasy, so used just a little of the oil and butter.  Used one very large sweet onion.   I have a little leftover for lunch tomorrow and may add a garden fresh tomato to it.   Everyone enjoyed this quick easy meal. Thank you for sharing.

This is a surprising recipe.  I can't comment on the amounts of oil and butter because I had already carmelized some onions for another recipe and was using the leftovers.  I followed the rest of the recipe and upon tasting felt it was missing something.  So I went back and added in some cream and tossed in a good handful of freshly shredded parmesan.  I still felt it was missing something so lightly sprinkled on a good quality balsamic on individual servings.  That was what made the dish for us.  I would suggest that if I had followed the instructions for the onions I would have been disappointed.  I think using carmelized  onions was significant in how much we liked this recipe.  In the description the submitter suggests this recipe just takes minutes but carmelizing onions well takes quite a bit longer than a few minutes.  Great change of pace as a side.

I made this because we had so many onions around and I had to feed a bunch of family and friends. I made so much I thought I would have leftovers for a few days to take to work with me for my lunch. Well, as it turned out, it all went and they were asking for it again soon. They all said this one is a keeper.

I made the mistake of not putting enough onions in, because I thought it would be too much...NOT! Amazing flavor from such a simple recipe. Made it along with balsamic chicken. Wonderful!

I'm giving this 3 stars because my dad absolutely hated it.  Me and my mom thought it was tasty but would have been better as a side dish.  The only change I made was adding a little minced garlic and drastically decreasing the amount of oil to saute the onions.  I have no complaints.  I'd make it again. UPDATE: We ate the leftovers with just a tad bit of store bought alfredo sauce (only because my dad had opened it the night before) and a drizzle of olive oil before warming it in the microwave and it was excellent!  I know it kind of goes against the simplicity of the recipe but it was so good that I had to share.

This was an overall delicious dish, and very easy to prepare I might add. I cooked it for my family, and they all thought it was incredibly delicious. However, I only used 4 onions, and I used fresh basil, it turned out great.

My family did like this dish, however I did do a couple things different. After reading many reviews regarding the oil, I omitted it completely and used just butter and cooking spray. I used only three onions. Also did not use water and bouillon and used 1 can of chicken broth instead.  Added garlic powder for more taste.  All in all, we do like this recipe and may add other things next time like broccoli or chicken.

We are an onion loving family, so, we loved this--yes--it's a bit buttery/greasy, but just eat with some french bread to sop it all up and you'll be o.k.!  The parmesan cheese is a must!

I was very dissapointed with this recipe.  It left my lips feeling like I had put a thick layer of lip gloss on them.  It tasted too rich or something.  I won't be making it again unfortunately.

This is very tasty, I used italian seasoning because I was out of basil, I did add a pinch of minced garlic.  I only used 1 tablespoon of oil, and about 2 tablespoons of butter, and only 3/4 cup of water.  This is much better than the previous 3 pasta recipes I've tried from this site!

I like it sweeter, so I added a package of Sweet n Low.  I also added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in a 1/2 cup water to make it more of a sauce.  It was very tasty, very simple to make and scrumptious to eat.

I made this when we had a vegetarian friend over for dinner.  Very good, I will definitely make this again.  I had to leave out the bullion, but I added a little extra salt.  Also, I served it with sauteed fresh mushrooms for putting on top, and extra parmesean cheese.  Very good dinner!

Love this!  I made it last year and should have reviewed it then.  Candy onions appeared at our local market and I used them.  Made as listed first time, then modified using less oil and some beef broth and thyme to give it a french onion soup - ish flavor.  It is great as written, though.  Onions have appeared again this year so will be making again soon....

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is so easy to prepare and it doesn't require many ingredients. I didn't use nearly the amount of oil called for, so I didn't find it greasy like other reviewers. I just used enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan. I also added some garlic and green peppers. Very, very tasty.

The onions had a great flavor, but a little too greasy for my taste.  Also, the recipe doesn't have any meat in it which is always a must in my house.  I might make it again if I'm low on ingredients, but not with so much oil/butter.

Excellent! I have to assume that by 1 tablespoon chicken stock she means chicken granules as there is a reference to bouillon in the directions. I also saved my pasta water and added some of it at the end to moisten. It was a little dry without it. Approximately 2-3 cups. It was fun to watch the expression on everyone's face when they took their first bite. I am sure we will have this many times in the future.

This is DELISH, and so simple to prepare. I could not believe how wonderful this tasted over pasta. Only thing I changed was I added chopped garlic to the onions as I cooked them down.

Stupendous.  It is so easy and yet so yummy.  I have tried this with several variations of onions, either alone or mixed together.  They all offer a new twist and are very good.  The favorite in my house is with vidalias.

I really liked this recipe. I had to half it because I live in a house filled with onion-haters but I made it exactly as it was written and it turned out great. I'll add garlic the next time I make it, just to try something different.

So, I didn't have chicken bouillon, so I had to use a top ramen packet. Nevertheless, this was an awesome recipe!! I loved it and my 12 year old who's not a big fan of red sauce spaghetti loved it too. Thank you!!!

Amazingly good!  You can put anything in this pasta or on this pasta or serve it as a main dish if you aren't married to my meat freak husband or serve it as a side dish.  It is just good.   I halved the recipe and then cut the olive oil by 1/2 after that (so 2 Tablespoons).  I used 2 onions and they were kinda small and it was enough for us.  I added 2 cloves of garlic and tossed it with Parmesan.   My favorite way to make this is with about 12 ounces of shrimp.  I toss them in 5 minutes before it is done and it makes a great shrimp pasta dish that my husband just loves.  Yum

We loved this pasta, we made it with all 5 onions (we love onions) and the only change was to use 3 bouillon cubes in place of Tbsp of bouillon. Sooooo good!

Great recipe. I served this with filet mignon. My family love it. I usually take a recipe and modify it to my own taste, but I didn't have to with this...it was perfect as is. I even gave this recipe to my aunt so that she can prepare for her husband since he enjoys it so much.

I used only 2 1/2 large onions  based on other reviews, but will make the recipe as written next time. The reduced amount of onions only made enough sauce for half the pasta. Lots of chopped fresh parsley at the end really enhances the dish, and I'll probably add some garlic (mild elephant garlic) when I make it again . Definitely a recipe worth perfecting– it's simple to make but tastes richer and more complex than the preparation. A keeper.

This is one of my go to comfort meals, and since I discovered it, I’ve made it quite a few times. I use either the oil or the butter and I cut it down too cause I don’t like it too greasy. I usually make some garlic oregano chicken breast and mix it in when the pasta is ready when I’m looking for a heartier meal.

I cut the recipe in half for us. I only did a tablespoon or two of oil and the same of butter. And I only did one onion instead of 2 1/2. I used parmesan cheese. I really liked it!!!

I poured out some oil since I was late to read that you needed to cut that down, which I only added two onions so I shouldn’t of added all the oil~ however...depending on how much pasta you add and how saucey you like that~ it would of been fine sine I added more than a lb. of pasta with it. It was buttery tasting and Fantastic! it is going to be a favorite for sure! all my children ate it too! (4yrs, 8, 11, & 12yr old) great at any age!!

Oh man.  Add chicken (sliced and sauteed with the onion and olive oil/butter) and sliced green onions, and I might as well be back in Chicago, I was wondering how Barnelli's did this, they called it Chicken Siciliano.   Never know what you miss till you move.

I have made this recipe over a dozen times and really enjoy it. It is easy, simple, and has a beautiful presentation. A picture cannot do it justice.  I do now add Marsala wine the last 10 minutes which adds a different finish to it, but it is lovely just the way the recipe is written. I have also added leftover chicken from time to time. The recipe is a perfect base for additional creativity.

I'm a vegetarian so I didn't use the bouillon cube. Instead I used fake/vegetarian chicken. It was amazing. If you eat meat and the recipe seems a little bland, try adding beef/chicken!

good! cut the recipe in half, used 2 sweet Vidalia onions,added fresh minced garlic while sautéing onions; deglazed the skillet with white wine and then used only 1/2 cup chicken broth instead of water; added the noodles and then served with parmigiano cheese; easy, cheap, and good!

I followed the recipe pretty closely. It was okay but I didn't think it was anything special.
