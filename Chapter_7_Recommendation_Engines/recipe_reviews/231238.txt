Watch your cook time! I have made this recipe twice, once using the cook time written, and once checking after just one minute. My chocolate was melted after the first minute! The first time, using the longer cook time, the fudge ended up a bit hard, but the second time around it is smoother and softer. Also, the second time, I added the butter (softened) after the chocolate melted and it incorporated much better. Will make this again!

I tasted the mix before I spread the fudge in the dish, and I felt the mint flavor was far too subtle so I increased the extract by an additional 50%.  This made it just right, in my opinion.  Also, I wouldn't even think of going for 5-6 mins in the microwave-the mix should be melted long before that.  My biggest issue is the fudge is VERY soft.  I will be storing any uneaten portions in the fridge for sure.

This fudge was a HUGE hit with my family! They think it is the best I have ever made, and since it is WAY easier than a traditional fudge recipe, this one will be it from here on out! My microwave has high wattage, so I cooked the ingredients in one-minute increments, and it was completely melted after three minutes. Also, did you know that they sell crushed peppermints in specialty stores? That made the recipe even more simple to make! I think next time I will increase the peppermint extract to 2 teaspoons, as others have recommended.

Made these for the first time and took the advice of the previous reviewers. I put in 2 tsp peppermint extract and it's the perfect taste. I also only microwaved it for 2 min total, and I added the softened butter AFTER it was microwaved - the melted chocolate melted the butter. I did have to leave it in the fridge overnight before it was the perfect texture. That's also where I am storing it. Tastes delicious cold from the fridge. Can't wait to make it again!

I really liked the flavor and how easy this was!!! I would definitely try using a silicone baking mold, as suggested, because i don't have one and i used a glass one with cooking spray and it was a little difficult to remove. so thats all i would change, but the recipe was absolutely delicious!

Super easy and tastes *SO* good! I found that 1/4 cup butter wouldn't blend in, so began adding  1T at a time, and for me, 1-2T, depending on which variation I made, worked perfectly! I think it may depend on elevation and climate of where you live that makes the difference. Drier climate needs more butter, wetter climate, not so much.

I think that I did something wrong! The chips took forever to melt, probably because I included some milk chips to make it less dark.... anyway, this morning, I went to turn out the fudge and it was very gooey and sticky - tastes like chewy toffee. Any tips?
