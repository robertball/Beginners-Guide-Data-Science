The recipe calls for BAKING POWDER not baking soda.  I have read a lot of reviews complaining about the amount of baking soda in the recipe.  The recipe clearly states baking powder which has very different properties from baking soda.  They cannot be interchanged or you will end up with a bitter tasting batter.  That said I followed the recipe and it was lovely.

It's a good basic recipe; however, please note that there is far too much baking soda called for in this recipe. 2 tablespoons should most likely be two teaspoons.

I really enjoyed these pancakes. They were very fluffy and full of flavor. I added some chocolate chips to some of these and they were amazing!

I doubled the recipe out of habit - very few pancake recipes make enough for my family - but I shouldn't have! These are very rich, and everyone liked them. Next time I might use a little less peanut butter and add some cinnamon. Great flavor just the way the recipe is, though!

These are melt in your mouth! They are so soft and fluffy!  I substituted brown sugar for white, I used 1 cup white, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I live at high altitude and this was the perfect amt of baking powder. The recipe dies make alot, freeze them for a week day treat! Will be making these again! These are sooooooo delicious!

Absolutely love this recipe, as does our toddler!!  It is delicious as written, and you can easily modify or add to it. I made them today with coconut milk instead of cow's milk, I used agave syrup instead of sugar, and I added some carob chips. In the past we have added cinnamon, raisins, cubed bananas (in addition to the banana in the mix), and they turn out fantastic each time.  These don't even need syrup.  Soo good!!!

These were really good, dense and not too sweet. Plus, you could really taste both the banana and the peanut butter, so no one flavor overpowered the pancakes. The family really liked them and it was a good way to use up an over-ripe banana. I would make these again.

I generally will add bananas to my pancakes but the peanut butter adds a nice flavor. Based on the other recipes I've used for pancakes I only used 1 tablespoon of baking soda. Thanks for the recipe.

This really jazzed up my Sunday morning breakfast.  I accidentally doubled the peanut butter and will correct that next time (counting calories).  So yummy.  Will make again

Quick and easy. These pancakes were fluffy and delicious. A perfect balance of peanut butter and banana. We ate them with both regular maple syrup and butter pecan syrup. My kids absolutely loved them. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These are ok. A good way to use up peanut butter. I added cinnamon to half the batter, and it tasted better.

This recipe is great but I decided to try a few alterations to see if they would work.  I have happen to have a bunch of pancake mix in the house that I need to use up so I used that instead of the flour mixture.  I decided to add a teaspoon of baking soda to help them fluff up more.  I didn't quite double the recipe ( 2 1/12 c. pancake mix, 1 tspn. baking soda, 2 eggs, 2 cups milk, 1/2 cup peanut butter, 2 ripe bananas,  1 tspn. vanilla, 1 tspn. vegetable oil, 2 tblspn. sugar and 1 cup chocolate chips).  They pancakes trned out great. Lots of banana flavor and lots of peant butter flavor.  The chocolate chips made them sweet...this recipe reminded me of a cookie I make with almost the same ingredients.  I recommend this recipe mostly because it is a great basic pancake recipe that can be tweeked to your tastes.

Running low on groceries and I didn't have peanut butter or vanilla extract. As a substitute, I used PB2 and vanilla bean. Nice fluffy pancakes and I was able to make 8 larger pancakes. Would have been better with real PB but I guess my way is "healthier." Would love to make with real PB next time.

This came out really good though I think I prefer just plain banana pancakes.  They were big, fluffy, moist pancakes.  I wish I had put in a teaspoon of cinnamon as others mentioned. I microwaved the peanut butter for around 35 seconds so it would stir in more easily and made sure to whisk hard while pouring it in so as to not scramble the egg with the hot peanut butter.

I’m giving this 5 stars because I used the recipe as-is and it was perfect. Please notice to use baking POWDER and not baking soda. The pancakes came out perfect size, very moist, flavorful, fluffy and 100% toddler-approved. We truly enjoyed these and we did sprinkle some of them with cho plate chips before flipping. Came out very good.

These were fluffy and yummy. The only thing that I did differently, was it came out to thick at first so I added extra milk until it was at the thickness that I like.

I changed the All Purpose Flour to Organic Whole Wheat Flour, and used  Almond milk instead (I made my batter a bit more runny) , and added an extra banana. I also added an extra teaspoon of baking powder, a couple pinches of nutmeg and ground cloves, and a tablespoon of cinnamon. They came out light and fluffy and were very tastey. I love making pancakes, I make a new type every week if I can these where some of my favorite.  I also made muffins with this recipe, I added walnuts and craisins. Really good!

Fantastic! I doubled it, added a bit of wheat flour and added some additional milk to thin it down a bit. They were still thick, fluffy and oh my gosh yummy! I like making them up and freezing them to grab when I'm rushed in the morning (always!). This is a keeper.

I've tried a banana pancake from this site, and it was great. When I saw peanut butter, I needed to try these. I believe, as another reviewer mentioned, that the 2 tblsp of baking powder may be incorrect. (The plain banana pancake recipe that worked fine for me only had 2 tsp in it.) So, here I used ~3 tsp of baking powder, and they rose considerably and were fluffy. I also added some semi-sweet chocolate chips to some, and I liked those better. Good recipe - thanks!

These were full of flavor and super fluffy! These pancakes were a hit in my house. Because the batter was thick, when I placed it on the griddle I used a knife to spread the batter out for even cooking. The end result was perfect. Love!

My kids and I really loved these.  They were a little sweet by themselves but good with a touch syrup.  It has the flavor of banana bread and denser than a regular pancake.  We once substituted peanut butter banana chips for peanut butter and they went from good to awesome (but also more sweet- we didn't use syrup.)  With the peanut butter chips even my husband, who does not like pancakes, ate them.  They were also considerably easier to stir with peanut butter chips.   After Christmas, we added a 1/5 of of mini chocolate chips and peanut butter chips and they were great this way, too.  They can be heavy can a bit heavy so I usually serve them with fruit.  They freeze well also.  I lightly wrapped each in wax paper and put them in a Zip-lock freezer bag.  They kept well for about two months.  We warm them up in our toaster oven.

I made theses as directed in recipe. I ended up with 15, 1/4 cup pancakes. My husband says they are Tasty. They came out very fluffy and cake like do to the 2 Tbl. Of baking powder. Like it has been mentioned before. Baking powder and baking soda are different and not interchangeable. This recipe has no baking  soda in it. For your sake don't mix them up. The recipe is perfect.

At first, I was skeptical about the 2 tbsp of baking powder but after reading some of the reviews, saying they followed the recipe to the book, I gave in and indeed used 2 tbsp of it. It was great and very fluffy. I did modify it a little bit by adding 1 tbsp of vinegar with the 1 1/4 cup of milk to make buttermilk. I set the vinegar and milk mixture aside for 10 minutes before mixing it with the rest of the ingredients. The kids loved it!

My family loves the recipe! I like my pancakes on the sweeter side though, so I add a little more sugar. The baking powder amount is also adjustable I think. 2 tablespoons does make them pretty fluffy but it's all to your preference!

If you flip them right as the first side is only slightly browned you may get a delicious inside like that of a soft cookie.

They were ok, fluffy and all. Just not a big hit in my home. They liked it but didn't love them. I used less baking powder than the recipe ask for.  Only 2 tsp was more than enough. .

These were some yummy, fuffy pancakes!!! We did make slight alterations, however.  Left out the sugar completely & substituted coconut oil for the coconut oil. We also used crunchy all-natural peanut butter because that's all we had on hand. Great recipe...thank you!!!

These are really filling and really good.    Only change I did was make a half recipe since I would be the only one eating them.  I got four out of it and I really enjoyed myself.  I topped mine with chocolate chips and more banana slices.  Will definitely make these again.

Meh. I wanted to love these. I made it exactly as stated. The batter was a bit too thick. The pancakes tasted only slightly like peanut butter or banana. My husband said he would rather just spread peanut butter on a regular pancake and top it with a few slices of banana. I agree.

Not very good. Way too dense and thick. Not airy and fluffy. Definitely needs a lot of syrup and tall glass of milk. Will not make this again.

This is a really good recipe. The pancakes came out nice and thick. Most importantly they tasted pretty good. I made them for some kids I babysit and they loved them. I added a couple shakes of cinnamon to the batter because I thought it would fit well with the overall flavor composition. Not sure why anyone would try to substitute baking powder for baking soda like some reviews below me did. Especially considering I haven't met a single person allergic to baking powder.

I followed the recipe exactly!  It's really good, but I think I'd like more sugar (naturally per my sweet tooth).  Also, sift the dry ingredients in a bowl, put the wet ingredients in a large bag and mix all the ingredients together in the bag just with your hands, then cut the corner and use it like an icing bag.

Personal side note: for me, one serving is 1.5 pancakes.

I adjusted for 4 servings and left out the peanut butter. I was in the mood for pancakes but didn't feel like making individual ones, so sprayed cast iron grill pan with cooking spray, poured batter in and cooked for 20 minutes. Next time I will try cooking it on the stove top and then broil for a few minutes to finish cooking the top.

We found these to be overly dense. I also felt that the peanut butter flavor was a bit overpowering. I typically make straight banana pancakes, but thought I'd try the peanut butter version to increase the protein. In the future I will stick to my normal banana pancakes recipe.

This is a pretty good recipe.  I thought the pancakes were kind of a pain to make because my batter was super thick, but my toddler scarfed them down so I know I'll even making them again! They freeze well - just throw them in the microwave for a minute or so

i absolutely love this recipe! i always make a bunch of them, freeze them in a bag and throw them in the toaster for breakfast 
sometimes i mix all purpose flour with spelt flour for a "healthier" version of it. it is also more filling

These are yummy!  Even my picky eaters gobbled them down. The only change I made was to use 1 tablespoon of baking powder. I have a family of 8 and this made enough for everyone to have 2 decent sized pancakes. We will be making them again.

I tweaked the recipe a little.  Used almond milk instead of regular milk and added white chocolate chips and cinnamon into the mix.  Very tasty!

Simple recipe! The low rating is because of the lake of taste. We found that the pancakes didn't have enough of the banana and peanut butter taste. I even added maple syrup but that barely made the taste come out. It isn't a bad recipe, just not one I would add to my cookbook.

Glad I read earlier reviews. Knocked baking powder down to tsp. measure v. tbsp as stated.

Mixed it up a bit subbing cashew butter for pb. Also threw in a few blueberries. Kids were happy!

This is a great recipe, but I made a few changes to fit my tastes. First, the batter was too thick for my preferences, so I added milk as needed. I also doubled the banana and peanut butter. These were delicious and make about 8-10 large pancakes--plenty of batter.

Made as recipe called for and they were delicious. Just the right amount of pb to banana. Might want to cut the baking powder back alittle. I like to turn mine twice to keep an eye on how brown they are getting.  As I was turning the second time the pancake slipped off the spatula and landed on the side standing straight up. Lol. Thick, fluffy,  and delicious. It's in the rotation.  Plus good way to get rid of the last banana.

Made recipe for 6 instead of 12 and added some chocolate chips. Topped off with fresh bananas and ground peanuts. The pancakes in general are not that sweet if you follow the direction, which is fine for me because of the added chocolate chips and toppings.

Made this as recipe stated, batter was way too fluffy and thick,  I had to try to flatten down and didn't cook in middle before outsides were done. Couldn't taste the banana much and pancakes by themselves didn't have much flavor but were OK covered well with syrup and butter. Won't make again, I'll just put peanut butter and banana on my regular pancakes. Might work better with less baking powder as suggested earlier or more liquid

Great recipe. My only adjustments were using ww flour, adding flaxseed and some chocolate chips. Both my toddler twins loved it...even without the syrup.  Will definitely make it again.

As someone else said, 2 tablespoons of baking soda is far too much. I made it that way trying to give it the benefit of the doubt and the baking soda overpowers everything.
