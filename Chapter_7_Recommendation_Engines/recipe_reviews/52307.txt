This chicken is amazing!  It is one of those recipes that I thought would be good, but it ended up tasting better than I thought it would.  I made it exactly as written.  The seasonings were perfect, the chicken breasts were moist and tender.  My husband loved it!  It would be perfect for guests, since the prep work can be done in advance, then it can be put in the oven and left alone.  Fantastic!

Great recipe.  Easy and tasty.  Even the kids liked it and that says A LOT!  I didn't have fresh tomatoes or peppers on hand so I used sun-dried tomatoes and frozen pepper strips.  Cut the black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon for the kids.  It was the perfect amount of spice for them.  Worked very well!  Will be making this again.

This dish is quite good, however, I made it according to directions the first time and found it to be way too peppery.  I will cut the black pepper down to 1/2 tsp. next time.  Also followed others suggestion of switching garlic salt for garlic powder and glad I did, otherwise may have been too salty.  I would also suggest using a small to medium red onion as in my dish the onion was slightly overpowering.

Certainly five stars for being easy! Mindless and quick to get in the oven with very little clean-up (particularly if you have the clever habit of lining your baking pan with foil and just tossing it afterwards!).  I enjoyed this and while I wouldn't call it extraordinarily delicious it was light, tasty and satisfying.  I didn't add the tomatoes because I wanted the chicken to brown and the peppers and onions to roast.  I kind of smooshed the chicken between the palms of my hands to even out the thickness, then baked it for 30 minutes at 375 degrees with the vegetables alongside of, not on top of, the chicken - again, so the chicken could brown.  Also, I used a multi-purpose seasoning blend rather than the Old Bay. I served this with Pasta Pancetta from this site and some grilled zucchini.

I've been meaning to rate this recipe for a while now, it was grrrrrrrrrrrrrt.  The only thing we did different was use garlic powder and used one green pepper and one red.  We love this and make it a couple of times a month.  Thanks for a great post.

Super Easy! I cut the chicken breasts into strips and added 2 small zucchini's to the vegetable mix (as suggested by another), and substituted canned diced tomatoes for the fresh (it's what I had on hand). I also left out the chives (again, didn't have any), but will include them next time for sure! It went together in a snap and smelled great while it cooked. The left over juices will be saved for a soup base. Thanks for a fab post! We loved it!

Mmmmmm!  'Like a good restaurant-quality dish.  I plan to serve it in flour tortillas next time, but the sauce was soooo delicious I'll come up with a use for it.  Very good!

Made this last night and was worried by the simplicity of the recipe that it would be bland - it wasn't!  It was so easy to put together and delicious!  I made a couple of changes - only had 2 chicken breasts, so  used one onion, one bell pepper, and 1 pint of diced tomatoes (canned).  Didn't have Old Bay, so I used half the season salt and then 1 tsp of cumin and 1 tsp of oregano instead of chives.  The veggies had a great roasted flavor, and the chicken was cooked perfectly in 1 hour.  Will definitely make this again!

I’ve made this a number of times and have tweaked it to my liking.  I use about two cloves of minced garlic, instead of the garlic salt, and a mix of green, red and yellow peppers.  I use halved grape tomatoes and white onion.  I have found the perfect cooking time is 45 minutes in my oven.  More than that and the chicken dries out.  I’ve served this over rice and mashed potatoes.  Quick and easy and tasty!

This was an OK dish. I thought it had to much salt in it. If I make this dish again, I will use less OLD BAY seasoning and seasoned salt. The tomatoes, onions, and green peppers were very good though.

For simplicity five stars, for healthy meal five stars! I've been in a cooking slump this week and found this recipe in my box, since I had everything except fresh parsley, I whipped it up for the husband and I. I didn't add garlic salt, just powder since I watch my salt intake, and dried parsley. My chicken breast weren't real big and the dish was done in 50 minutes. The chicken was very tender and the veggies were fantastic. Next time I'll rub the seasoning mix on the chicken and let it sit for a few hours so the flavor has time to work into the meat.

We loved this recipe.  I actaully put the rub on the chicken the night before because we decided we didn't want chicken that night so I went ahead and prepared the rub and put it on the chicken. The next night, since I didn't have fresh tomatoes I used canned diced Tomatoes with Peppers, and onions. I also added some red peppers and some red Onion, mixed that up in a bowl poured it over the chicekn, and put it in the oven. the chicken came out tender and ver juicy.  The tomato mixture was very good to put over it. I served it with herbed rice and green beans, it was a great meal.  Will definately make again. 

NOTE:  It says in the recipe that you take whatever leftover rub you have and put it in with the tomato mixture. I didn't have any rub left over. so I just added some of the spices to the tomato mixture.

I didn't have any peppers, but I did have an eggplant, some tomatoes, onion and mushrooms. I used dried chives and dried parsley. Also, used chicken legs and thighs. Yummy served with couscous.

I made this recipe twice, the first time just as given.  My family thought the red onion overwhelmed the other veggies so the second time I made it I used mushrooms instead.  It got rave reviews!  I am sure I will use this recipe over and over, especially in the summer time when we have lots of garden veggies.

It was very good. Might even work if you cut it up and put in a tortilla with some toppings like letuce or cheese w/ sour cream! Im going to try that next time.

The general consensus was that this was one of the best things I've made. I even forgot to buy green pepper and chives. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I added a little extra olive oil so I could use the extra sauce after baking on some penne pasta. The 16 oz. of pasta had my sub. for heavy cream-- 3/4 cup milk and 1/3 cup margarine, so with the olive oil and spices poured over it, it went perfectly with the chicken and I can't wait to make it again with the green peppers.

Excellent! My wife kept mmm mmm'ing the whole meal.  I used red, yellow, and green peppers for color, and sliced up some squash also.  Took the advise of another and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and salt free seasoning instead of season salt.  Chicken was so juicy and flavorful, my wife will kill me if I don't make it again soon.

Made recipe as it is with 1 tablespoon of Italian dressing mixed in. Also, since I didn't have parsley or chives, I added broccoli and corn. Instead of green bell peppers I used red peppers. Also chopped chicken breasts up into cubes which allowed for after cooking (only 30 minutes in the oven on 350 degrees). Amazing!

Wow, I am impressed!  Honestly, I did not have high hopes for this recipe.  It just didn't sound as though it would be good.  But pretty much all I had on hand was chicken, bell pepper, tomato, and onion so it was my only choice.  It far surpassed my expectations!  The chicken was so moist and juicy and flavorful and the juices and veggies made a wonderful sauce.  Plus, it is very easy and healthy too.  My boyfriend who usually only likes fried or fatty things, loved it.  I am going to be making this all the time from now on.

I would make this again, but use less salt. It was good. I would check the chicken at 50-55 minutes. I would use granulated garlic and not garlic salt. I put four large boneless, skinless, room temperature chicken breasts in a 13X9 on a bed of fresh spinach. The spinach was the only tweak I did. I followed the recipe exactly. The chicken came out borderline dry after an hour. Knowing that chicken continues to cook after you take it out of the oven, I think 50 minutes in the oven and 10 minutes "rest" would make this fantastic. I also had to double the olive oil measurement to make it spreadable for the amount of dry seasoning. This was good, but as written it is 4 stars. Thanks for a new recipe in my rotation!

Great flavor, beautiful colors, and supremely easy preparation.  After baking, I sliced the chicken lengthwise and tossed with the veggies, juice, some parmesan cheese and pasta for adults, and diced the chicken to mix with veggies for the kids.  This would also be great alongside a crusty bread.

The vegetables were still crunchy after an hour.  I cooked the dish an additional 30 minutes and they still weren't finished.  I removed the chicken (afraid it was going to be dry and overcooked at this point) and cooked vegetables 30 more minutes.  When all was said and done, it was wonderful!  I cut the vegetables pretty small, can't imaging going much smaller so I'm not sure what I did wrong?  Will make this again, but will likely saute the vegetables a bit before adding them.

This is great but I agree with others that garlic powder should be used instead of garlic salt. It was still yummy even though it was a bit too salty! I used chicken strips instead of cutlets, to make it more "fajita" -like. Also used about 2/3rds of a large can of diced tomatoes (drained) in place of regular tomatoes. Turned out pretty good!

I have made this at least a dozen times, and it never fails to impress my guests. The chicken always comes out incredibly moist, and the vegetables work nicely with a brown rice or hearty bread. Easy, healthy, and very tasty!

Excellent and healthy recipe!  I only had red and orange baby sweet peppers so that is what I used, but I think that the more pronounced flavor of a green pepper would have been nice.  I served this with Fast and Easy Spinach with Shallots, and it was a very good combination.

So tender and flavorful. I loved the vegetables on the top and the spices. It was the greatest combination. Can't wait to make it again. We had corn on the cob and parsley red potatoes with it and it was very satisfying!~ Thanks!

This was okay. I gave it a four because my husband and father liked it but I didn't care for it. There was a certain herb that stood out that I really didn't like. Maybe it was the old bay seasoning.

I LOVE this chicken . At first I was scared of the Old Bay. I was also scared to cook it so long. I ended up cooking it 50 min. & the chicken was great- not over cooked. I'm gald i tried it anyway. It turned out great! I used a  yellow pepper instead of a a green pepper I also doubled the parsley scallion mixture. I am making this agian next week!

This was a great dish! I only made a couple of changes. We don't eat bell peppers, so I used two cans of french cut green beans instead. Since I used so many veggies I doubled the sauce. I added a little bit of chicken stock to the bottom of the pan to keep the chicken from drying out. It came out moist, and yummy. For anyone who doesn't like bell peppers, I recommend trying the green beans. They were DELICIOUS.

I am not a big fan of chicken, but the rest of my family loves it. I gave this one a try and I LOVE IT!! We will have this one again. I loved the spice, and it's so easy to make. It's almost like you have salsa on top of your chicken. I would not change a thing!!

This was a nice change from our usual chicken dishes. I doubled the rub based on some reviewers because I used an extra chicken breast. I think that next time I'll use less black pepper and still double the rest of the seasonings because my children found it a bit too peppery. My husband enjoyed it, and that's saying something from a man who prefers meatloaf and creamed potatoes. I served this with seasoned couscous but I think roasted potato wedges would really compliment this dish. The roasted vegetables were great when mixed into the couscous. The chicken was very tender, although I did add a few tablespoons of chicken broth before baking to make sure things wouldn't dry out.

I subbed garlic powder for the garlic salt since there is 1tsp of seasoning salt, which was a good amount of salt for us.  The rub is very nicely flavored; I did sprinkle a bit more garlic powder, seasoning salt, black pepper, and Old Bay on the veggie mix as it didn't seem like enough seasoning to cover it all.  Used a yellow & a red pepper because that is what I had, and it looked nice & colorful with the red onion.  I was concerned that the chicken might not be moist being in the oven for an hour, but the juices from the vegetables must have done the trick as it came out pretty moist.  This was an ok weeknight meal; probably won't make it again though.

I saved this recipe some time ago but never got around to making it.  What a fool I am!  Looking for something different last night and tried this.  Very, very good.  The only changes I made were to season the breasts with a little kosher salt and ground black pepper.  Also didn't have the seasoned salt.  Used cherry tomatoes (sliced in half) instead of one large tomato.  Turned out fantastic.  This is an excellent recipe.

This was great. I also added squash, and a little chicken broth. I served over brown rice, with an Italian salad on the side. Next time I make it I will have the prep work done in the morning, so I can put it in the oven right when I get home. 

Thanks!

Awesome recipe!  Very easy to prepare.  I didn't have tomatoes on hand so I substitued canned, diced tomatoes (with basil and oregano) and it turned out great.  My husband weightlifts and is on a strict diet.  It's a challenge to find recipes that he's allowed to eat that actually taste good.  Lisa's recipe was exactly what I was looking for.

Super impressed!  The only 2 things I changed were to use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and I had no fresh tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes with basil and oregano.  I doubled the rub b/c I used more chicken than the recipe called for.  Next time I will add zuchinni like others have mentioned.  Thanks for a quick and healthy recipe Lisa! :)

My husband loved this dish and I have to admit it smelled delicious when it came out of the oven. The only change I made was to use canned tomatoes instead of fresh. I will have to try on some kind of fish for me and the kids since we don't eat other meats. Good job lisa

I absolutely loved this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully. I especially like tossing the leftover seasoning with the veggies, it gave them a nice kick.

This recipe was definitely awesome!! I made this for my boyfriend and his parents when they came over to visit his new apartment. They were really impressed with me! It's very easy to make and you will impress everyone! I added zucchini and then topped with parmesean cheese and it was fantastic! I already have everyone else in his family asking for the recipe after hearing how well it turned out :)

Quick and delicious.  I couldn't bring myself to add all that salt though, so I used 1t seasoned salt and 1T garlic powder... and it was still salty enough for us.  Served this with a side of penne pasta.  Mixed the leftovers together for a one dish lunch tomorrow.

I cooked this for my wife the other night, and we both agree...wonderful! The flavors blended extremely well, and I think the only change i'd make is to marinate the chicken for several hours prior to baking.

This is great recipe!  The chicken is moist and tender, and the seasonings and vegtables give the dish an intense flavor.  I added mushrooms and chunks of zucchini to the veg. mix and Italian seasonings.  This was a big hit with my family and I will definitely be making again.  Thanks.

This was fabulous!! The whole family loved it... I had to substitute red and yellow bell peppers, nothing that would have changed the taste.  I will be making this again and again!!  Oh- I didn't have any chives either, but I think it would be good with them as well.

After reading the reviews, I only used 1/2 tsp of the season salt and we like red bell peppers better, so I used those too.  We loved it and will make again, except it was a bit too spicy for me and my daughter. I am guessing that is due to the Old Bay seasoning, so I will try 1/2 tsp next time.

This was ok but probably won't make again.  I doubled the seasonings to spread on the chicken several hours ahead of time which was good.  The other half I used for the veggies, putting them all in a bowl and stirring to coat them well.  I did use Yukon Gold potatoes (cut up) as one of my vegetables along with baby carrots (sliced in half length wise). I didn't care for the peppers , tomatoes in this recipe.  Also cut way back on the red onion as other suggested and that was good.  The one pan meal was nice but I'd rather have roasted the carrots, potatoes & onion at a higher temp to get that charred crispiness.  Flavor was good & the left-overs will probably be even better.

I found this WAY TOO salty.   Next time I will only add half the seasoning salt and Old Bay. 
Other than that... the chicken was so moist and delicious.

So easy and really delicious. I only omitted the seasoned salt to keep the sodium content down. I will be trying Old Bay in more recipes in the future! Served with rice .

I made a few changes based on what i already had in my kitchen:  I didn't have chicken breasts, so, i substituted with 6 boneless,  skinless chicken thighs. I didn't have garlic salt or garlic powder, so, i used 6 garlic cloves. I didn't have parsley, so, I substituted with cilantro.  I used 1 red pepper and one yellow pepper. I used 4 brown tomatoes.  I baked everything on a bed of spinach as someone else had suggested.  Also, I lightly seasoned the thighs first with adobo Goya. I tossed all the ingredients by hand in a large bowl and then poured everything into a baking dish. 

I've never cooked with Old Bay before (other than to make crab cakes) so i was skeptical. The aroma coming from the oven was delightful and the flavor surprising! I definitely will make again perhaps adding some zucchini next time.

Delicious. I'm not a big fan of salt, so I subbed garlic powder for garlic salt and omitted the seasoned salt. There was still plenty of salt in the Old Bay seasoning! This dish was easy to assemble. The layer of vegetables kept the chicken moist as it baked. I'm likely to make this again.

My family loved this!   I did not add the peppers because of food sensitivities and I reduced the amount of salt and only used half a red onion due to previous reviewers' comments/suggestions.  It was still delicious and I will certainly make it again.

I made it last night.  The tomatoes onions and peppers would have been better had they been reduced before hand.  Half the pepper would have been plenty.  On the plus side the chicken was very moist and tender.

Great recipe - nice flavor - a little salty.  Trying to watch the sodium intake so next time I think I'll use garlic pepper (instead of garlic salt). Delete seasoning salt (not necessary with Old Bay Seasoning giving it so much flavor).  I used grape tomatoes and it made a very nice presentation.  Served with salad and angel hair pasta.  Will be making this again - thanks.

Yes, this is easy to throw together, but be sure to read the recipe all the way through.  It must bake for an hour, so it's not exactly the best recipe to select for an evening when you work late.  Other than that, which was my fault, and I will certainly not dock the recipe for that, this was tasty.  Mine made a good quantity of liquid, which could be thickened and enjoyed over pasta or rice, but I chose this for it's low carbs.  I didn't have tomatoes, but I don't think the dish suffered for that.  Thanks for the idea!

Great chicken dish, with lots of flavor.  I cut the recipe back to two breasts and cut back on the amount of garlic and seasoned salt.  The pepper I used had green, orange and red coloring all on the same pepper, hence the different colors in the picture.  I baked it at 375° in the toaster oven for 45 minutes.  The veggies still had a slight crispness to them, just what I was hoping for.  Served it with corn on the cob, Italian bread with 'Basil Butter' from AR, baked potato for DH and 'Pesto Zoodles' from AR for me. This dish was wonderful and I would make it again, using the lesser amount of salt as I did, this time around.

Loved this, although I made the mistake and doubled the marinade which made this meal a bit salty. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will be sure to only use the amount stated in the recipe. That or use garlic powder instead and less seasoning salt (and I love my salt!).

This was delicious. I added chopped garlic and salt seasonings to taste.  Those were the only differences - loved it. It would be so good with pasta or rice; we're low-carbing right now and it was fine without that as well.  I did let the chicken marinate for a few hours.

This was delicious.  I didn't use the peppers, since my family isn't crazy about them.  I did add some capers though.  I made it with chicken breasts one time and boneless pork chops another time.  Both were great. I think it would be good on a fish like grouper too.  I may try adding some spinach to the tomatoes sometime soon.

I liked it very much.  I used wings and I cooked it on top of the stove.  It was easy too, well it was, once I had found out what Old Bay Seasoning was and got a recipe for it. I, too, found it rather salty, but will amend that the next time.  What turned me on, was the turning of the meat in the mixture of oil/herbs/spices.  I am going to try this with other meat/vegs.  Only one thing against,  I like green pepper, but can't eat much and in this way, it turned out like a mush, so I had to pick it out.  The next time I will put it in towards the end, so that it stays intact.  A query....why RED onion?

Very delicious!! I adjusted the seasonings so there was less salt, and I only used a dash or two of Old Bay seasoning. The chicken breasts were cooked through after 35 minutes.  I served it on a little bit of pasta.  Everyone in my family loved it!

Had not thought of using Old Bay for chicken, but it adds a nice flavor.  I used chopped garlic to reduce excess sodium, and  ripe (as in red, yellow, orange) bell peppers for better flavor and eliminate the post-meal 'return of the green pepper' reflux.

Had to use dried parsley and didn't have Old Bay seasoning so I used 1 tsp cumin and 1 tsp oregano instead as suggested by another reviewer.  I also cut the pepper down by half and used garlic powder in place of the garlic salt.  Used red pepper instead of green and only half a red onion as a while seemed liked a lot.  Even with all these changes this was a pretty recipe.  Very easy and quick.  Will definitely make again.  12/16- made again, half onion, dried parsley, sun-dried tomatoes (1/2 cup) in place of fresh, cut pepper by half, garlic powder not salt.  Sun dried tomatoes make this so much better!

I used fresh crushed garlic in place of the garlic salt, didn't have Old Bay seasoning and so replaced that and the seasoning salt with Mrs. Dash's Table Seasoning (also in an effort to reduce sodium for myself) and this dish was so, so good. The peppers retain their fresh flavour, the chicken is incredibly juicy and it was still great heated up the next day.

This was pretty good. I felt there was enough salt with the tsp seasoned salt (there are simple recipes for this elsewhere), so I minced a garlic clove instead of adding the garlic salt. That was my only change, and I'd make it again.

I had been meaning to try this recipe for about a year, and I'm glad I finally did. After reading some of the reviews, I doubled the rub. The only other significant change to the recipe I would make is leaving out the green pepper. It didn't seem to "go" with the dish.

I liked this and it tasted good but there was not even NEAR enough of the oil mix for a good coating of the veggies and chicken so I would double the amount. Also, I would add more garlic then what it calls for. The overall flavor is nice but VERY calm and I generally like a little more pizzaz.

I made this recipe for 3 and here's what I did: I sauteed about 4 crushed and chopped garlic cloves with a tbsp extra v-olive oil and half a diced yellow onion. I added 1/2 diced tomato (I'm not a fan of tomatoes), 1/4 diced green pepper, 1/4 diced yellow pepper, 1/4 diced red pepper and 3 chicken breasts cubed. I poured a packet of sazon seasoning, 1/4 a cube of chicken & tomato bouillon, 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 tsp black pepper and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and let cook covered over low heat for about another 15 minutes, mixing occasionally, then 10 minutes under medium heat, adding a little water so that it doesn't dry out. Note: I chopped and diced as I went so there are stages, so when I say "another 15 minutes" I mean after all is in together.  It came out juicy and very flavorful, will definitely make again!

Followed this recipe to the T. It was great. Even made it with crusty bread. After all those veg are baked in and reduce down they make a great dipping sauce with the bread. Thanks for a great recipe.

Okay so I did make a few changes due to what I had (I thought I had everything except Old Bay when I started making it). I didn't have olive oil so I used canola oil, I don't know what old bay is so omitted it (another reviewer omitted it also so I figured I'd be okay) and I don't have chives so it got omitted it too.
I have to agree with another reviewer that it is a lot of vegetables but hey they are good for you!
The result: my husband kept raving about it and my two year old actually ate her vegetables!!! I tried mine with adobo and even though it added more salt it was still good. I liked both ways. We ate it over rice, which seemed to help take away some of the spiciness of it.
I would like to try it again in the future and use olive oil, chives and old bay!
This is a good healthy meal.

This has way too much veg. I missed out Old Bay Seasoning, as we dont have it here in England. It tastes good, and keeps the chicken moist because of the juice from the veggies. I would make this again

This recipe did not disappoint! I've never bought or cooked with Old Bay seasoning before (not a seafood eater) but I am a believer in it for chicken now that I used it in this recipe. 

I used a can of crushed tomatoes and 1/2 back of frozen pepper and onion stir fry mix to cook with the seasoned chicken. Turned out perfectly. I thawed the peppers in the microwave before cooking. 

Will make again!

Maybe it's just personal preference, but I followed the directions to the T and neither myself or husband cared for this recipe at all.  Can't put my finger on what it was, just didn't like it.

I usually don't eat baked chicken because it seems to always be dry. However, this meal was a hit!!! The aroma was great! I enjoyed it as well as my husband. I only added some butter aside from the recipe. I will DEFINITELY be making it again!

This recipe was awesome.  Hubby actually liked it, and he is NOT a big chicken fan at all!  It was all he could talk about.  Saute was something I hadn't done in a while but I will  definitely be doing it again soon.  We had it with a side of white cheddar and broccoli noodles and salad.  Absolutely delicious!!!

This was easy and very delicious. My husband and kids loved it. I started looking on this site because I have run out of ideas for chicken, and this is certainly one of the better ones.

I agree that it has a little too much salt the way it is written, but I remedied that by using Onion Powder and Garlic Powder instead of the salt versions, as well as fresh onion and garlic. Also suggest using Mrs. Dash without salt instead of seasoning salt. That way the only salt will come from the Old Bay Seasoning.

Well, let's see...I didn't have some of the ingredients so I used 1/2 tsp. garlic powder in place of garlic salt, Chef Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Magic instead of Old Bay, no parsley, and added a chopped zucchini to the mix. It was served over brown basmati rice. Between the chicken and the basmati rice the house smelled heavenly. It is elevated to 5 stars because of the ease of preparation. Will definately make again, especially when the garden comes in. Thank you, Lisa.

Not bad.  Next time I'd use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  It was too salty to my taste otherwise.  Good flavor tho.

This is super easy to make and tastes wonderful!  I doubled the rub and didn't use fresh parsley, but it still turned out great.  It's a nice alterative to the normal baked chicken.

This was really good, Hubby loved it.
Served it over rice. Had alot of juice 
and veggies left over. May cut back on
them the next time. 
But a very easy quick meal. Thanks for sharing Lisa.

We would have given it four stars for flavor, but considering this dish is extremely healthy, being low in fat and calories, we decided it deserves all five stars.  We didn't have chives on hand and added in some yellow peppers.  No measurements were used on the veggies, just the rub, and everything was fantastic.  Very moist chicken, delicious broth, and an absolute must with some crusty bread.  Oh, and it's really easy to make too.

Good stuff. I didn't have old bay and I added a teaspoon of chicken and grill rub. I will only use 1/2 t. of pepper next time. I also used one green and one red pepper and 1/2 zuchinni. Pretty too!

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  It's a healthy recipe, that takes no time to whip up.  We just had it by itself for lunch, but next time I will have a side of brown rice with it.

Yum!  The chicken was very good.  The spices smelled wonderful and mixed very well.  The chicken was very moist and juicy.  This will be a regular meal at our house.

Great recipe!  
I touched it up a bit to suit my tastes and what I had in the pantry at the time.
I used a can of Hunt's diced tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh.  I only had half a pepper on hand, but I did add in two medium size yellow squash.
I also used a touch of mesquite seasoning in the rub, and topped the whole thing off with some shredded parmesan cheese when I served it.
This is an easy recipe to modify and change to suit your needs and tastes, as well as whatever is on hand ingredient-wise.

This dish is absolutely divine. I added mushrooms and used a yellow and green pepper and it was delicious. Because I had some extra veggies and the pieces of chicken I had were rather large, I somewhat doubled the recipe with a little extra olive oil. (I'm not much for measuring.) This dish will become a staple at my house. I'm thinking I might add some chicken broth and rice or orzo to the leftovers to make a stew. Make extra bread to go with this recipe because the juice is that good. Thanks for a fabulous dish!

It is now my husband's favorite chicken recipe.  I have made it twice and he love it. I have substituted red bell peppers for orange and forgot the chives once and he still loved it!

Tasty and easy.  I baked this for about 15 minutes longer than directed.  Also, I added about 1/2 tsp. of sugar to the vegetables for the last 20 min. to add flavor.  The chicken and vegetables make a light and delicious sauce that goes well with rice or bread.

I tripled this recipe and made it for a dinner party in a huge stainless roasting pan. I added yellow and orange peppers for color and everyone just kept commenting on what a beautiful dish it was. The chicken comes out so moist and tender. Perfect!
