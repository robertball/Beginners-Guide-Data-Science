My family really liked this! I did add a couple of things - black beans to kind of stretch the meal a bit since I'm feeding four people, and some black olives, but nothing that would change the recipe drastically. My five year old loved it, and my almost two year old ate mostly the meat and cheese, and kind of ate around the chips. That's okay though, I was just happy that he ate most of it! I will be making this again.

We really liked this! The jalapenos were the perfect amount of spice! I would like to use this recipe for tacos, I bet they'd be awesome!

Thee were pretty good but if I make this again I will add a little taco seasoning to the meat mixture.  I also will use more as a dip since I am not a fan of soggy chips.

Definitely a keeper!  I did change a few things after reading the reviews.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and added fajita seasoning, salt and jalapenos to the turkey.  Once cooked, I drained and added fresh salsa and cheese to the mixture and put in a casserole dish.  I put leftover crushed taco shells only on top (since I don't like soggy chips) and cheese to top it off.  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

These were good! I would have preferred more flavors, like taco seasoning w/ the meat/jalapeno mixture, green onions and sour cream, but that's my personal preference, in fact hubby loved them just as is, which was a huge surprise, lol. I did put it together a bit differently too...I put some chips on the bottom, the meat mixture/salsa/cheese, more chips and cheese. Note that most of the chips do get soggy, so if you're not a fan, take that into consideration. All in all, these came together quickly and the family was happy. I would make these again, but add in my changes. Thanks for sharing. :)

after reading some reviews, I added taco seasoning and kidney beans. I also omitted the peppers because I didn't have any. I also put the chips on the top only. It was delicious, I would definitely make it again.

I modified the amount to match the servings. I already had ground beef cooked from a couple days ago so I just used that and because I didn't have any refried beans, I used Heinz Chili style beans. It was delicious!!!
