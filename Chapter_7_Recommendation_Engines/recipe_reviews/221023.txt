Omitted the pineapple due to allergies. I would skip the ranch dressing next time and season to taste.  A high rating would have been given, but as stated, it was too salty due to the dressing mix.  Great add ins though, and great for a low carb option!

Great recipe! Especially when it's hot and you don't want to cook (I used canned chicken).

Great recipe, been eating this since I was a kid, probably in the 60's and for sure in the 70's.  Never had it with pineapple, but the mandarin suggestion was a great idea.  Also I'd cut the dry ranch dressing and replace with a tablespoon or two of liquid ranch or bleu cheese dressing, instead.  Overall, still a great version of this classic.
