I followed the instructions and the bread didn’t rise. My water was the proper temp, but I’m wondering if it’s because my eggs were cold??

While the flavor was right, the texture was not. I read and re-read this recipe and tried it twice as written with poor results. Adding the yeast dry, without first activating it per package instructions, meant this dough did not rise at all and outcome was dry and crumbly. If you make this, first activate the yeast and then add it to the batter.
