The seasonings are right on target.  The only thing I feel it needed is a little chopped white, red or green onion. An easy and delicious summer meal idea.

I have to update my previous review, since I have been serving this for several years now.  It has become a family favorite, and it's great to take on picnics, camping, and I have served it at company dinners.  I have given the recipe out countless times.  I do add celery and onions and I use a 15 oz. can of sweet corn.

Let's get this back up to 5 stars! This was yummy!  I rinsed the beans, used frozen corn, added 3 green onions and some red, green, and yellow bell pepper.  Didn't have cilantro, added some garlic powder.  Started eating it a few minutes after putting it together - it was EXCELLENT.  Don't know if it will make it to tomorrow to see how it tastes fully marinated.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Simple, easy, and delicious! This is a very light salad that has a lot of flavor. I used olive oil vs. veg. oil and 2 Tbsp. of cilantro. I added 2 Tbsp. of finely chopped red onion and used an 11 oz. can of no salt added sweet corn. Next time I might added a bit of chopped red pepper for come additional color and crunch. I let it chill for a few of hours before serving and it was even better the next day!

I used this recipe as the foundation and made a few changes due to what I had on hand.  I used one can each of garbanzo beans, black beans and kidney beans (red, white and blue) in lieu of the corn and black beans recommended (I'm sure would be excellent too).  I also had no fresh cilatro on hand, which would have enhanced the flavor further, and used dried.  It was tasty, especially the second day!  My 4-year old wanted to know if he could just have a spoonful of the dressing!  Would be great addition to a BBQ!

I actually amde some changes that made this outstanding.  I used rice wine vinegar, dijon mustard, cumin, garlic powder and tabasco and whisked in olive oil. I also used scallions, a bel pepper, and a jalapeno pepper with the cornand balck beans. Yum!

This is a very easy and delicious recipe to make. It has outstanding flavor. Additions that can enhance the taste are adding thinly sliced onions, and diced peppers. This brings some tang to the recipe although it is great by itself. I've made this several times already, and it has been a hit everywhere. Try it. You'll be happy you did.

This was so easy to make and it tasted AMAZING! I can't stop snacking on the leftovers. I served this salad along with Jay's Jerk Chicken, Black Bean and Mango Salsa, and Tropical Salad at a party on Saturday night. They were all hits.

I just love this recipe.  I added chopped red bell pepper and some onion as someone else suggested and wow!  Just the right amount of crunch and flavor.  I will be making this one again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was pretty good!  Very easy to make and it is can easily be changed, by adding some more spices or veggies.  I will make it again!

I should not have tasted this before putting it in the fridge. I had to make another batch because I wound up eating too much of it.

This was so easy and delicious! I did use only 1/4 tsp. salt (trying to cut back on salt) and canned corn with no sodium added. I also added half a chopped red pepper I had in the fridge. I had one bowl over a bed of romaine lettece. Economical and healthy!

Vinegar flavor was just a little strong.  Think next time I will add some chopped onion, tomato, or red pepper..But this is certainly a recipe to try...easy to adapt to your own taste.

I always believe a great recipe is one I choose to make more than once!  I have made this recipe a few times now.  The first time I made this I ate half of it by myself the first day.  I rinsed both the corn and black beans before mixing with oil mixture.  I did not have cumin, so I used onion powder instead.  I also have not had fresh cilantro on hand, so I have used fresh cilantro paste, which comes in a squeeze tube, as well as frozen cilantro cubes. Definitely a recipe to save!

Finally, I found the perfect side dish for mexican night!  I roasted a red pepper, peeled, diced it, and added it to the salad.  I think the sweetness of the red pepper was a real compliment to the salad, and made it look gorgeous!  I only had two hours to marinade the salad and it still tasted just great.

Different strokes for different folks but I didn't care for the balsamic vinegar taste in this salad at all.  I thought the Black Bean and Corn Salad II recipe had a better flavor as it used lime juice instead of balsamic vinegar.  I also think this recipe could use some tomatoes & red onions or scallions.

Made this wonderful salad for my son's birthday/barbeque and everyone loved it!!!  Added red onion and let it sit overnight and it was delicious.  Everyone was asking to take the leftovers of the salad (not the cake)!

Love it!  Made many times, given out recipe many time.  Red/green pepper and onion add nice crunch and I also prefer white balsamic vinegar to maintain the color of the corn.

My husband liked this a lot - he thought it had zip.  I hated it & ate only two bites.  I couldn't reconcile the corn with the strong vinegar flavor - even though I love balsamic vinegar.  But like I said, my husband really liked it.

This was so simple and delicious.  I used a packet of artificial sweetener in place of the sugar but that was the only change I made.  Next time, I'll probably add some bell pepper for a little more color.

Nice color, spicy flavor but had to add onions and another can of beans to add volume.  Still a keeper for potluck dinners or a quick side dish.

Great little recipe to accompany any meal - I served this as a side dish with the 'Sour Cream Chicken Enchildas' and it was wonderful - the sweetness of the balsamic vinegar was a perfect pairing with the more complex flavors of the enchiladas - I definitely recommend!  I made it exactly as listed and did refrigerate it overnight...thanks for such a yummy recipe!!! (Not outrageous enough to be five stars, but very good and easy!).

Outstanding flavor! I added a 4 ounce can of diced green chili peppers and about the same amount of diced sweet Vidalia onion. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it! I'll be making this again and again.

This dressing is out of this world.  You can also use it for southwest salads on greens for an incredible extra southwest flavor.

Not a big fan of balsamic vinegar, but I think the flavors where well balanced in this recipe.

I made it as directed, and it just wasn't good. I think the balsamic was too overpowering.

Amazing that corn and beans can taste this good!  I always add tomatoes and tons more cilantro.  Sometimes I'll top it with a little bit of avocado.  Very pretty and travels well!

This is the one of the easiest, most delicious recipes I've ever come across. My mom and I love and prepare it habitually. On ocassions when I'm without fresh cilantro, two tablespoons of dried has worked beautifully as well.

I've made this many times -- always a hit! I skip the cilantro, add onion. To accommodate my picky kids, I make half the batch without vinegar or onions, then make the other half with.

I don't like (and don't have) cumin, so made it without and it is scrumptious! I added chopped tomato and squeezed half a lime into it. This is one of those recipes that you can add to and it tastes great because the dressing is so good. I hope I don't eat it all before my main course gets done!

This was a terrific side dish and an add-in for fajitas.  We like cilantro a lot, so we used about a half-cup.  We also added garbanzos (chick peas) just as a personal decision.  We ate this after only an hour of marinating, so I'm looking forward to seeing what it's like after waiting longer.

I'm on a roll with two good recipes in a day.  Great as a side dish with grilled or roasted meat and as a filler to make wraps.  I added some to a spinach wrap along with thin slivers of roast pork,  jalapenos, and a shredded Mexican cheese blend.  Delicious!  I used a 15 oz can of corn and added in about a 1/2 cup of diced onion.  This will be a great side for BBQs.

This is delicious! I absolutely love the dressing.  I made it as is the first time (adding a little chopped onion for flavor).  The second time I made it, I added chopped tomato and avocado also, which brought it up to 6 stars!  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

I didn't love this, but my guests seemed to.  I think I was a little confused by the balsalmic bite in a mexican-style dish.  But it was fresh tasting and lovely looking.

Changed it up a bit, and it was AWESOME!!!  Some reviewers noted it was too overpowered by blasamic, so I made dressing with white wine vinegar + added 1/4 ts cayenne & 1ts dry onion flakes & juice of 1 lime & cut oil in half.  This would make an awesome taco salad dressing as well, looove the cuminy flavor!  To the salad itself, I added a red bell pepper, jicama, avocado & olives.  Used fresh grilled corn instead of canned.  Will make this again for sure, but I had to jazz it up a bit for my taste.

I used a can of fiesta corn in place of the regular corn and added some mild Rotel the second time I made it. It was great both ways and I got so many compliments on it and it is even better after a day or so in the refrig. Great recipee!

This was delicious.  I used it as a salsa for some fish tacos!  It was great!  This will definitely be served in our house again!  I did leave out the pepper and chili, spicy isn't so nicey in my house.  But the end result was still terrific.

Very easy to make.  Good stuff, but maybe not "great."  (More like a 4.5)  A good amount of spiciness.  Made it as is, except I don't have fresh cilantro on hand.

This is an interesting recipe! I really enjoyed the unusual pairing of balsamic vinegar and cumin. The only thing I changed was using a 15oz can of corn, because it's all I had on hand.

I wasn't sure I'd like this, since I'm not a big bean fan, but I made it based on all the good reviews and the delicious sounding dressing.  I'm glad I did, because this is a great summer salad that I'll make all season long; my husband and I both  loved it!!  Thanks!

This salad is SO easy to make - the only thing you have to chop is the cilantro!  I make a double recipe on Sunday night and can take it to work for lunch for the week!  The taste only gets better with time.  The only change I made is to double the amt of cilantro.

Pretty good.  There is plenty of extra dressing, so I served this over finely chopped romaine lettuce and chopped tomatoes; a nice change of pace healthy salad.  I tried this recipe again another time and used part chickpeas, a little chopped celery, and fresh parsley in place of the cilantro -- I liked it even better with these changes.

The vinegar adds the bite.  I didn't add the cilantro because I am one of those lucky people who think it tastes just like soap.  Instead I added chives.  The oil was olive and oregano.  Eased up on the sugar and chili powder because I am serving it with the tangy pumpkin soup leftovers, some fresh baked soft wheat bread and a fruit dish.  Added black olives, mushrooms, green peppers, some parsley to the beans and corn. Wonderful color that will play well against the pumpkin soup.  A winner with a lot of modifying possiblities.

I made your salad this evening, but also added, as did some others, tomatoes and chopped onion.  Didn't see the wait time and it tasted so good with just 30 min. marinating, can hardly wait to see what it will taste like tomorrow.  Husband enjoyed it too. Great recipe.

We ate it, but will not make it again.  The flavors were a strange mix with the traditional flavors used with black beans.

So simple yet so good!  Didn't have any fresh cilantro handy, so just used a tablespoon or so of dried.  I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

I love the ingredients but as it is the recipe tastes very, very strongly of balsamic vinegar including after letting it sit and develop the flavors. I like BV a lot, but even after adding more of the other dressing ingredients it was too overpowering for me. I would cut the amount of BV by half at least or, as some other reviewers suggested, replace it with lime juice. I will certainly make this again but with changes.

I love this salad.  What's really awesome is I serve this as a dip, with the Tostitos Scoops.  Very addictive!!  I also will heat this up on top of a flour tortilla with cheese, as a burrito.  And last but not least, I have made this with cold pasta.  And then heat it up with diced chicken and diced tomatoes.  There are soo many unlimited ways to make a meal out of this.  This recipe is definitely Five Stars!! :)

I didn't care for this too much, but my husband really liked it.  I think the dressing was a little overpowering and it felt like the salad was missing something.

OMG! I AM  a huge fan of balsamic vinegar but with this recipe it was too much. I like the idea of this recipe really I do. I think when I make this next time I will totally omit the balsamic vinegar. Stick with the seasonings and olive oil.

This recipe was the star of my fish tacos.  We placed  the corn and black bean salad in a soft taco, topped with a little cheese, then added grilled tilapia on top along with a slice of avocado.  Yummy.  A real keeper recipe.  I did add a little red onion to the salad.

This is a great side dish to use throughout the week. I ate it on wraps, salads, and all by itself. I only gave it 4 stars because I changed it a little bit- here is what I added: thinly sliced red onion, chopped red & green pepper... this added more of a crunch and was delish! I would also suggest using more cilantro.

I have made this several times and have had to write this recipe out more times than I can count for friends! I even made large batches for my daughter's Graduation party simply by quadrupling (x4) the recipe because of its great taste, affordability, ability to make ahead and simplicity. I prefer mine with some chopped green onion, but the recipe is perfect as is! What's not to love about a 1-bowl recipe?

It was very refreshing, the flavor wasn't my favorite, but I think it was just my taste buds.  I did add some onions and green peppers.  That added crunch did improve the flavor for me.

This recipe is very easy to make.  I gave it a 4 rating because, personally, I think the balsamic vinegar overwhelms the other flavours too much.  Next time, I think I'll try cider vinegar with just a tablespoon or so of balsamic.  Also, we doubled the dressing ingredients  because we didn't think it looked like enough to coat the corn and beans enough.  Big mistake!  Our salad ended up "soupy" and we had to strain some of the juices off.  So, next time, we'll stick to the recipe (except for adjusting the balsamic) and see what happens.

Wonderful.  A friend brought this to a bbq and it's now one of my favorite summer dishes.  Use a 15 oz. can of corn, though.

We loved it!  I made it an hour before dinner, because I found the recipe late in the afternoon of the day we wanted to use it.  It was great.  I can't wait to see how much better it will be after it sits the appropriate amount of time!  Thanks for the recipe.

Super yummy - even my carnivore eating boyfriend loved it. Chopped up the cilantro and put it in the salad along with some fresh diced tomatoes. I think it would be great to use as a dip with chips as well!

I rated this a 4 because I made a few changes, but wow, is this a delicious recipe!  I changed the corn to a 14 oz can, deleted the chili powder and cilantro (I just don't like cilantro and didn't want this spicy). I added red onion and red pepper for crunchiness, and left everything else the same. My DH has asked me to double to recipe next time as we both chowed down on the first batch! Can't wait until this summer and will use with fresh sweet corn and may take the advise of another by grilling the corn. This is definitely a keeper!!!

Have made this many, many times exactly as the recipe is written (except I usually double it). A very easy yet tasty dish that you are able to make ahead of a gathering. I serve mine with chips and use this as more of a salsa/dip.

Crazily easy to make.  Was too vinegary so I added pasta.  The pasta made this a nice small meal when you're hungry and it's not yet time for dinner =)

I made this recipe this week and it is just great.  I doubled the recipe and am still eating on it.  We put pasta in it for the 2nd time and added a little more sugar.  Next time, I'll probably add some kind of a white bean.  Thank you for sharing.

Since my first review, I've continued with this salad as a "go-to".  I've added cannellini beans and serve over rice.  The dressing can be so versatile.

It was very good and seasoned well.  I added some celery to give it some crunch.  We really liked it!

this was an excellent base for an "anything goes" side!   i used another reviewers suggestion and used an alternate dressing of the rice wine vinegar, dijon mustard, cumin, garlic powder, a TBSP EACH ADOBO, chili powder, tsp of sweet pepper flakes, and a pinch of cayenne,few splashes of hot sauce whisking in some EVOO.   Used a can of g. giant white shoepeg corn along w/ a cup of regular frozen corn.  I also added about 1/3 c. chopped sweet onion, 1/4 c. chopped celery, 1/2 large red pepper, and a small green pepper.   also about 1 TBSP each chopped jalapeno peppers and banana peppers.    very fresh!

I am a big fan of the corn & black bean combo, and this one is great.  I added red onion and red bell pepper to this, and served it over romaine lettuce.  This keeps well in the refrigerator.  In fact, it seems to get better with age.  I made it several times this past summer and it was perfect to have when you just didn't feel like cooking or eating hot food.  I'll make it many more times in the future!

Made this exactly as described by Jodi, except that I used a 15.25 oz can of corn.  It was excellent!  Besides eating this as a stand-alone salad, I used it to make burrito bowls: I included jasmine rice, leftover "good easy garlic chicken" from this website, the corn and bean salad, salsa, a little chopped fresh jalapeños, grated cheddar cheese, shredded lettuce, and sour cream...  so easy and so yummy, and they came out very much like Chipotle's chicken burrito bowls.

This made for a tasty salad. I used fresh corn, low-sodium (and rinsed) black beans, and raw organic honey instead of sugar. I also added some finely diced shallots and fresh tomatoes from my garden. I plan on making this again.

Incredibly easy and super tasty.  I didn't marinate overnight, only a few hours and was still very good.  Served it over brown rice, next time I'll just mix the rice in.

I make this recipe constantly and am always always asked for the recipe.

I like to add red onion and or red pepper for some extra color and flavor. The longer this sits the better it tastes..

Made this to bring on a camping trip, was easy to make ahead. One of those you like it or you hate it things. Went over great with some people. I liked it, my husband of course, hated it due to the cilantro. Easy, tasty and healthy, I will give it four stars b/c there is a corn/bean salad I like better than this one.

A great, easy recipe that's perfect for the summertime. I followed the recipe closely, but subbed olive oil for vegetable oil and also added one diced red bell pepper. If you don't like balsamic, this isn't for you, but I happen to love it. I think cilantro is key and if you're not a fan of cilantro, I'd go with parsley.

Way too vinegary for my taste.  whew!  I checked to see if I did everything right and it seems I did.  I used balsalmic vinegar as called for.  Maybe it was a bad brand.  Don't know.  I won't be making this again though w/o modificatioins.

This is a good basic recipe that can be eaten as is, which is very tasty or can be altered by adding additional ingredients if you happened to have more on hand. I added green pepper  and some red onion since I wanted to add more color and nutrition.  Since Balsamic vinegar can be a little strong for my tastes, I only used 1/2 what the recipe called for. I followed the rest of the recipe as written. It marinated in my fridge only for a few hours before I used it inside my chicken and cheese quesadillas that I was making. I am sure it would be good as a side, but I really liked it as a filler to my quesadillas. Ate the rest for lunch the next day!

Didn't realize until the third time I made this that is actually a salad recipe - I have been serving this as a black bean and corn salsa with tortilla chips - it's delicious - don't think I'd enjoy it as much as a salad.

I am mixed on this one.  I think the balsamic kinda ruined it.  The vinegar was so over powering.  I wish I would have added that last and tasted it as I was adding it.

This is really good!  I love that leftovers are good, too!  It has just the right combo of flavors in the dressing, although the balsamic vinegar is kind of dark.  We love cilantro, and I know I used at least 1/4 c.  I also added half of a red bell pepper for flavor, and I wish I had an avocado.  It would be a perfect addition!

This is so delicious!  We ate it on its own as a side to dinner and then I used the leftovers the next day in a taco salad.  So simple, but the flavors are great and it gets better the more it sits.  The only changes I made were adding in a tomato and a small red onion (both diced).  This will be a new staple in our household!

This was very good. I had to dress it up a bit. I added chopped red pepper and red onion, crushed red pepper flakes, garlic powder, seasoned salt and more fresh ground pepper. It was MUCH better after it marinated over night. The vinegar taste was just right. I think it would be terrific with avacado. I used fresh corn(2) that I cut off the cob after I cooked it.  I think next time I will cut down on the sugar. The fresh corn was very sweet.

I made this according to the directions and I loved it.  My husband and kids thought it was a bit strong, so next time I'll cut down on the balsamic vinegar a bit for them, but it was perfect for me.  I love the tangy taste.  I might add some sweet onion next time as well.

Right after I made this I was bummed cuz the vinegar seemed to overpower everything, but after letting it sit overnight in the fridge like the recipe says to, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the flavors melded together.  I ate mine with tortilla chips and it was tasty!  (I also used a 15 oz. can of corn).

Delicious!! I added red onion, red pepper and jalapeno based on other reviews and it turned out amazing. My husband couldn't eat enough! I thought the balsamic was great, not overpowering at all.

SOOOO GOOD! I took the advise of other reviews and added some chopped onion and red pepper for added color and flavor. I have also added chopped jalapeno for when I want a little kick. Its the kind of salad you find yourself going to the fridge with a spoon in hand  :)

Delicious.  We didn't eat this like a traditional salad, though - we used scoops chips and ate it like salsa.  I make this all the time now, and it is especially popular at parties.  It's a great make-ahead dish!

Yum, this salad is great.   I do not like very spicy food so I only added in 1/4 of the chili powder and I thought it was great.  Made a double batch to eat throughout the week and will definitely make again.

This was very good as written, but a I wanted a little more umph, so I doubled the cumin and also added some lime juice, and it was delicious.

We really enjoyed this dish as a side for grilled burgers/hot dogs. It had a nice spice and flavor to it and smelled great! What a nice change to the usual potato salad. The leftovers tasted just as good the next day. Will definitely make this again!

My boyfriend and I had this yesterday with chicken soft tacos. He made it while I was at work, and didn't refrigerate it nearly as long as the recipe called for--only about an hour. He was a little worried about it, not sure that all the flavors would go well together. However, we both loved it and it went great with the tacos. The vinegar really brought out the cilantro flavor, and wrapped it all together nicely. I think with a little more time refrigerating, the flavors would have been a little more consistent, but we still loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Excellent!  We added a bit more cilantro and omitted the black pepper.   Also added a small diced red onion.

This is a truly good salad. I have made it several times and have used different beans and varied it a little. I know it works great with red beans and also with garbanzo beans. This will be on my menu many many more times. Thanks!

Wonderful salad, can modify it tons of ways to suit what you like/have on hand.  I increased the cumin quite a bit to match our tastes and also added a bit of garlic.  Added in tomato & red bell pepper, too.  Great with tortilla chips, as a side dish, or as a light meal.  Kiddo loved this one.

I loved this! The only thing I changed was instead of Vegetable Oil, I used a extra vegetable oil that had a hint of lime flavoring. It was fantastic!

Great Salad.  Served it with tacos and it was a hit!  I doubled the corn and the beans and it was just right (too much dressing without doubling).  Will make often.

Yum!  I had everything on hand for the recipe and added onions based on recommendations and my inability to completely follow a recipe.  I just made it for the first time but I already know it will become a favorite.

I made it with twice the beans and corn, but kept the sauce the same.  Came out just right.  I keep it in the fridge and grab a few bites here and there as snacks.

This is a great start...but not nearly interesting enough. I added chopped bell pepper and MUCH more spice. I tripled the cumin and pepper. Also added more chili flakes for an extra burn. 

Thanks for the idea! I love it!

Simply amazing. I used a frozen bag of black bean/corn/green & red pepper/onion mix, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, all the seasoning as listed, and olive oil i/o vegetable oil, then simmered it for about 15mins on stove top. It turned out great! Made a great side dish.

This is delicious! Every time I make it I get rave reviews. The dressing is absolutely perfect, and to the salad I add small chunks of avocado and carrots to add creaminess and crunch.  I highly recommend, especially on a hot summer day!

I have made this a few times now & it is wonderful! So easy to make. I used fresh corn because it is in season now and it was even better! I added it to some left over black bean rice and let it sit over night, it made a nice cold rice salad. So many things you can do with this recipe!

Great recipe! This is a wonderfully simple to put together recipe, but the taste is outstanding. I don't care for balsamic vinegar, so I used plain white vinegar and cut the amount down to 2 tbs. I also used  olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and frozen corn (1 cup) instead of the canned. Other than that, I made it as written and am really enjoying the results! This is such an extremely easy, tasty, and healthy salad...the dressing has so much flavor. Please try this salad...you won't be disappointed!

What a great salad for every day or potluck time! I usually have the ingredients on hand, so will be making this often.  I used a whole 14.5 can of corn and liked having that amount equal to that of the black beans.  I also added 1/2 cup sliced green onions and 1/2 cup finely chopped red bell pepper for the extra crunch, color and nutrition. Thanks for the posting this recipe.

Great recipe.  Next time I am going to do as other suggested and add tomato, avocado, and red onion.  I did double the seasonings as others also recommended.  I used fire roasted frozen corn sold at Trader Joe's, and it added a great smoky flavor.

This stuff is absolutely wonderful!  The mixture of flavors is great.  I made it for Memorial Day and the fam just ate it up.  I had to hide some away for myself!!  I added some cherry tomatoes and thinly sliced red onions as other reviewers suggested.  Next time, I will add some avocado.  I will be making this all the time this summer!  Thanks!

Excellent salad. I use it frequently with BarBQ meats, or lovely with just some corn bread, or maybe a small bowl of soup, this is awesome!  But I will have to admit, I use lime juice in place of the balsamic vinegar and I like it so much better. But the rest is the best!

I've made this several times.  I love the dressing.  I recommend adding additional veggies to aid the appearance and the texture.  I add some white onion, red and/or green bell pepper and celery to give it crunch.

We really like this one.. I don't love, love, love, Balsamic vinegar so I actually toss in 1 can of garbanzo beans and about 1 hour before time to eat it-I add 1 cup of whole wheat rotini. There have yet to be any leftovers!

This was really good.  I made it the day before I served it, also added red onions and green peppers.  I also subbed dried parsely for the cilantro because I didn't have any.  I also add cucumbers or whatever is on hand and it always turns out great!

I really liked this a lot. I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, added a can of kidney beans, and a smal red bell pepper! The best side dish for our BBQ today! Yes, I only refrigerated a short time, but delicious!

yum! the dressing has a great mild, sweet flavor... next time I might add some red pepper flakes to kick it up a little though. I added fresh chopped tomatoes, avocado, black olives and a squeeze of lime juice which I think bring this up to 5 stars.

update: in scrambling to find another side dish when extra people decided to come to a BBQ I realized I didn't have enough ingredients to double this or to make a large pasta salad, so I combined the two! doubled the dressing from this recipe and stretched with a box of tricolor rotini. delish!

I didn't have veg oil so I used olive oil, but the flavor if phenomenal!I did add a little onion and pepper because that's what I like, but it'd be great without. The sauce base of basalamic vinegar makes it!

This was great! I used frozen corn and omitted the chili powder and cilantro to suit my family's taste. We ate it after marinating only 30 minutes and it was very flavorful.

Love this! The basic recipe is great on it's own, but is also delicious with more corn, a bit of onion (red, white or green) and even some red bell pepper.

I thought this was very good with a few tweaks. I used 1 can black beans and 2 14oz cans of corn. I added green peppers, red onion, and grape tomatoes. I also doubled the amount of balsamic vinegar.

I like the simplicity of this recipe. I did change it up a bit. I used a honey ginger balsamic and jalapeño olive oil (Didn't use the sugar due to the sweetness of the balsamic) and I used one 11oz can of Mexican style corn. I like a little bit of a kick and this turned out perfect.

The balance of flavors in this recipe seems a little off.  I think the vinegar is too strong.  Also, the flavors get stronger over time, so for us, it was even worse as a leftover.  If I make it again, I'll use less vinegar knowing that the intensity will increase over time.

We love black beans so I upped the recipe to 2 cans but left corn the same. I also added a cup to a cup and 1/2 [I really didn't measure] of medium spicy chunky salsa and a bit of grated onion but eliminated the chili powder. we are not fans of cilantro so I substituted parsley and some extremely finely chopped celery.. Even my 6 year old grandson loved it!

I've made this twice now, first time as written so that I could rate it and the second time with a few adaptions I made for our tastes.  We loved it both times and really, if I only made the original that would be fine with us.  The second time I used one whole bag of frozen corn that I defrosted in the microwave and white beans since I was out of black beans.  I also added two small chopped avocados which I needed to use quickly, celery, a bit of onion and two small chopped roma tomatoes and a small red Fresno chili, which isn't hot. I doubled the dressing and increased the sugar to 2 teaspoons and let it all sit for a hour or so before serving.  It was wonderful.  Original recipe or the adaption, I heartily recommend both.

This is such a great make-ahead!  When we were up to our eyebrows in indoor track meets and a little tired of standard packed lunch fare, this traveled really well in lunch sacks with some cut up leftover chicken resting on top.  Have made it time and again ... easy, tasty, and ingredients that are easy to keep on hand!

I gave this 5 stars as written, but I as I use a very high quality balsamic vinegar that has a powerful taste I will probably use less of it the next time.  This is a great quick and easy side dish, love it!

I added chopped red onion and red pepper, and replaced half of the vinegar with LIME JUICE.  Yummy.  We ate it over chopped romaine and put some tomato on top.

I added finely diced onion and green bell pepper for additional color and crunch. I thought the balsamic was too overpowering when made as written. I added an extra can of black beans and additional corn (I used frozen) but it was still a little too vinegary. I will make again but decrease the balsamic. We ate half a few hours after being in the fridge and the res the next day. It was definitely better after sitting over night.

This recipe is awesome.  It's great to serve over any lettuce mix and there's no need for any other salad dressing.  Delicious!

Very tasty!  I put it in the fridge, for a couple of hours, and then went to try a little bit to see if it was good...and I almost ate the whole thing! LOL  This salad is now part of my menu.

This tastes great!  I followed the recipe to a T, but decided that we would like it with red onion and red bell peppers.  So I added.  Great the way it is, but even better with the onion and peppers.  We like to eat this on top of Cilantro-Lime Jasmine rice, add it in our Chicken Wraps or on chips.  Tastes great just as a side as well.

Quick, easy and GOOD!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding onion and thought the dressing was spot on.  It does need onion though and I added avocado and diced red pepper the next time I made it and really enjoyed it with these additions.

delicious but has a southwestern flair.  if you don't like that, omit or decrease cumin. i will try it next time without it.  you can eat it immediately and don't have to wait for the next day.

DELICIOUS! I also added 1/2 cup each of finely chopped white onion, celery and red pepper.  The marinade is really tasty and plentiful - I doubled the amount of corn and black beans while keeping the marinade ingredients in the given amounts.  YUM!

I've actually made this before even reading this recipe (thought I pulled something out of my creativity hat! ha). I add a little chopped green onion/chopped bell pepper/tomatoes/cucumber/ and jalapenos. I use red wine vinaigrette for the dressing. This is a tasty salad.... :) Thanks for sharing!

i used this as a salsa for a southwestern chicken salad and it was excellent. I left out the vinegar, doubled the cumin, and added diced green bell peppers. I already have people asking me for the recipe.

This was just ok for me. I like the Garden and Corn and Black Bean Salad recipe I got from  Midwest Living. The previous review was written in 2011.  I tried this again in 2017 and my opinion has not changed. It is very bland.

Great recipe!  I used fresh corn from the garden and kidney beans.  Didn't have cilantro so I substituted basil and it was very good.  Next time I will try with cilantro and black beans, it was great with basil but I imagine it would be even better with cilantro.

Great Basic Recipe. Its sitting in my fridge right now just waiting for the pineapple grilled pork chops (also from AR) to finish grilling. You really don't even have to marinade it overnight. after reading other reviews, i did add some tomato and onion. Fantastic. I probably would have added avocado, but i'm out. also, i left out the chili pepper-My family isnt big on heat. Even with just the cumin, i'm SURE my 6yr old won't touch it. but that's ok. Awesome recipe for a hot summer evening. I'll be making it again!

This recipe is like one I've been making for years. I have exchanged the sugar for either honey or agave nectar, use more cilantro, and add avacado. The avacado it what makes it incredible. Cut it in cubes & gently fold in which will make the salsa/salad creamier & wonderful. This is wonderful on salads and quesadillas also. Thanks for sharing.

I make this using olive oil, Trader Joe's roasted corn, chopped Jalepenos, chopped red pepper and onions.  Sometimes I add cut up avacado.  It's really yummy and very colorful.

I was actually looking for the salsa version, when I came across this. The dressing is unique and yummy! I used leftover corn on the cob we had grilled and added diced homegrown tomatoes and it was delicious!

This was good but seemed like it was missing something, probably onion.  I also used a bigger can of corn and felt like it worked better with more corn.  I may cut back on the cilantro just a bit bc my husband doesn't love it.  I served this as a side dish to Mexican lasagna, but feel like it would worth better as something you eat with chips.

Everyone raved when I brought this to a potluck.  Per others' suggestions, I used less balsamic and added some green onion, roasted red pepper, plus Dijon mustard and garlic powder.  Look forward to making this again and again.

Corn & Black Bean Salad Haiku: "Too much vinegar. Maybe add lime juice instead? Wasn't too impressed." I served this at a BBQ and followed the recipe faithfully, but despite everyone saying "mmm!", the bowl remained nearly untouched. I think the balsamic vinegar just threw the whole thing off, and would've preferred a little EVOO and lime juice in its place. The only thing I added was a little diced red onion. I'm going to yank the leftovers this afternoon and try to salvage them w/ more cilantro, diced tomato, lime juice and a bit more sugar, but I much prefer the similar AR "Super Summer Salsa" recipe to this.

First, my observations: YUM! I followed the recipe, but also added half a red onion, chopped. I was surprised that I could barely taste the cumin, and could not taste the chili powder at all. (They were both fresh bottles bought in anticipation of making this.) What I mean is, those flavors did not stand out as identifiable, but I do believe they contributed to the overall flavor of the marinade.

I have an old corn, pea and onion salad recipe I inherited from my auntie (it was her favorite "funeral potluck" dish) with a vinegar-oil-salt-sugar marinade that calls for bringing the marinade to a boil for a few minutes, then letting it cool before pouring over vegetables. I think I might try that with this - it might spike up the cumin/chili flavors a bit. If that doesn't work, I might also try doubling the spices. I will definitely add more red onion next time for crunch - maybe some bell pepper, too. (Don't care for celery.)

Much as I love balsamic vinegar, I might also try making this with red wine vinegar instead. I don't like the effect of balsamic vinegar on the color of some foods, i.e., the cut edges of the red onion and the corn both turned a bit "muddy" looking.

So - liked it a lot as is, and think with a little tweaking it could be great. I definitely intend to try again.

Yummy, even my 5 children ate it. Followed the recipe exactly except the cilantro garnish. Didn't have it on hand. Wonderful chilled salad for the spring and summer ahead!

Excellent recipe! Very Adaptable. I added about a 1/3 cup chopped Vidalia onion and some chopped sweet red & orange peppers (had extra from another recipe...about a half cup or a little more). I also substituted the canned corn for half a bag of frozen Birds Eye Baby Gold & White corn. Put the corn in a strainer and just let it thaw to room temp. I also doubled the dressing- simply because I had aded extra ingredients. 

The added colors of orange and red with the white & yellow corn and black beans was very festive and added other layers of flavor. 

Served this with shredded beef chimichangas, Mexican rice; home made tortillas and guacamole. My husband has requested adding a finely minced  fresh jalapeno pepper the next time. I think I'll take half the batch to honor his request but will still keep the mild version.

This dish was amazing the only altering I made was adding a 1/2 tsp garlic powder. I have been suffering over the past 3yrs of the effects of steroid weight gain. I'am COPD patient and at the onset my weight was 146. My weight now is 184, so this dish fit's into my new nutrionional plan perfectly. Thank you for sharing.

Wow! I decided to throw this together for lunch, without refrigerating the mix overnight and it was still amazing. What a perfect blend of seasoning in a very light salad. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this! The dressing is delicious. I used a 15 oz can of corn instead of the 8.75 oz  & added a diced avocado.  I'll be making this again for sure.

A friend gave a similar recipe to me many years ago and if you are an avacado fan like my entire family...it's sooo delicious with avacado, tomato, shoepeg corn and red onion as well!  (all cut up, of course!)

Very tasty!  I'm not sure any will be left tomorrow to see how it tastes after a night in the refrigerator.  I omitted the cilantro because I do not like it.  I think grilled corn would also be excellent!

This is wonderful!  Tasted great the same day I made it, but man oh man was it fabulous 3 days later.  I took some of the suggestions on here and added onion as well as increasing the corn to a 16 oz. can.  This will be a staple in our house.

I have a version of this recipe that is exactly the same except it calls for red wine vinegar.  It is vinegary and delicious.  I save time by thawing a bag of frozen black bean, corn, onion, and pepper mixture.  I think the red wine vinegar would allow the flavors of the spices to come through better.  I also know someone who makes hers with apple cider vinegar and that too is delicious!

Very easy to make. Had in the fridge all day, so at dinner time I didn't enjoy it very much. Tasted like all balsamic vinegar. But the next day at lunch, my 1 year old and myself enjoyed it very much. My husband enjoyed it as well. Makes so much!

Good, good, good. I made this as a side dish for a burger cookout but my daughter and granddaughter found it before hand. They ate a large portion of it with tortilla chips until I found them and made them get out of it. I made 1 1/2 times the dressing, used two cans of black beans and an 11oz can of shoepeg corn. I also added part of a red pepper diced small. I wanted to use onion but my DD won't eat onion. When I tasted the dressing immediately after mixing I was worried because it tasted grainy. After sitting in the fridge for about 5-6 hours it was perfect. I'm making again for an office function this week and will be adding the onion. I think it will be great with the tortilla chips that have a hint of lime. I'll update my review next week. Thanks for a great recipe.

I left out the cilantro and oil and substituted frozen corn for canned corn (more nutrients). The chili powder really made this fantastic!

This was very good.  It got lots of compliments from some distinguished pallets.  I added some thinly sliced onion and red pepper and it helped to perk the dish up a bit.  Overall a great simple dish for summer.

This is a great basic recipe that lends itself very well to alternate ingredients. I subbed olive oil for the veg oil and used fresh corn. I didn't have any fresh cilantro, so I used some fresh basil, which was really good, but cilantro is probably better. I also diced a roma tomato to add to the mix.

wasn't so great. the vinegar was way to acidic for me, even if added more corn and half a can of beans(had extra from another recipe). i found it didn't really taste like much even when i marinated overnight so had to re-mix before serving(hence the dressing being too acidic). won't try this again.

What a good salad!  I used frozen instead of canned corn and also added 3 green onions which I don't think I would have liked it as well without.

Awesome recipe.  Only change was we used olive oil in place of the vegetable oil.  Be sure to use a high quality balsalmic vinegar.

Really simple and tons of flavor.  This is a definate stand by in our house, because it's easy to always have the ingredients on hand.  The only thing you could add might be a little red onion, but that is a personal thing.

Basic relish/salad/side dish.  Easy to make.  Sitting overnight didn't make any big difference.  If I were to do it again I might cut down on the vinegar some...it was a little strong.

I really didn't care for this recipe.  Maybe it's a personal taste thing, but I didn't think the balsamic vinegar and the white sugar were a good combination with the southwest flavors of the rest of the ingredients.  I think the corn added plenty of sweetness without the balsamic and the white sugar.  Next time I'll just try leaving out both and adding a little olive oil for moisture.

I made this perhaps ten minutes ago, and had to tear myself away. My boyfriend wasn't sure about the balsamic, but I think the earthiness of the beans and corn really needed a strong vinegar. I used boxed chili mix because I was out of chili powder and cumin. I used two tablespoons of the prepared powder, one tablespoon of lime juice, and olive oil instead of vegetable. I mixed the cilantro into the dressing, since I was using dried, and it tends to taste better after a little time to rehydrate. Absolutely delicious now, and sure to be even better tomorrow night!!

I gave this 5 stars because this is one of my favorites salads of all times.  I make this by grilling 4 - 5 ears of corn without husks and no oil, till lightly charred then cutting off the cob. I then add red 2 tbls. red wine vinegar and the juice of a lime instead of balsamic.  Grilling the corn only takes a few mins. and realy adds to the flavor.  We like it to top fish and chicken or by itself.  I take it to alot of parties and am always asked for the recipe.

This has become one of my favorite salads. Made it all summer and everyone loved it. With the leftovers, I heated some up and put it in a wrap with a little sour cream, Yum - love it. Great salad, thanks so much for sharing.

This was good, but I wasn't crazy about the spices so I will definitely play around with this.  This is one of the great things w/this website you get the ideas, try the recipe and then can figure out how to tweak it to your liking.

It's amazing such a simple dish would taste so good.  I think I've made this 3 times in 3 weeks.  Once for a church function and the other times for us.  My 16 month old even likes the corn and beans.

We really enjoyed this salad. I did add a little salsa for extra juiciness and I had no cilantro, so I didn't use that. This was very refreshing and summery, (if that's a word). I will definately make this again! Thanks for posting :)

Yum!  I added some fresh chopped onion and sweet bell peppers and a bit extra of the cumin and chili powder and this was AWESOME!  I took it to a potluck for work and they gobbled it up and asked me to make it again for the next one.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Awesome. I added sliced grape tomatoes and some purple onion. But only did that for personal preference. Also, I made this for a crowd of 28 and it was a breeze to make with the nifty calculator. EVERYone loved it. Thanks!

This was an ok recipe, not bad at all.  I prefere different versions of the Black Bean Salads.  I had four guests to dinner and not much was said and not much of it ate.  I think it was the balsalmic vinegar, atleast for me, I didnt favor it much with the mixture. I would eat it again, but I prefere a more Texas version of this.  Thanks for the recipe though.

I made this for a potluck and got a compliment then my husband had some later that day and liked it but said it was a bit vinegary.  I don't mind the vinegary but next time will add a bit more sugar for him.  Certainly was simple to make and inexpensive.

I kind of combined this recipe and another (so I used frozen corn, added a diced red pepper and red onion) but I'll still give this recipe 5 stars because adding balsamic vinegar was something I didn't think of but really made a difference from my other attempts at a corn and black bean salad. 

I probably only added an 1/8 of a cup but it was enough to really balanced out the other flavors.

I add a little chopped vidalia onion and sweet red pepper to give a little colour.
I make it at least once a week during the summer. Leftovers are nice in a tortilla with cheese and lettuce for a veggie tortilla.

This salad was totally overpowered by the balsamic vinegar. It was edible, but I wouldn't get excited about making it again. I've found another recipe for black bean and corn salad that I prefer.

Pretty tasty, although I wished I had some sweet pepper and green onion to add like other reviewers suggested. I used frozen corn that I cooked up first instead of canned. Also, I used 2tbsp of tomato-flavored balsamic vinegar and 2 tbsp. of regular, and it made for a different-but-good flavor. I used canola oil instead of vegetable. Aside from chopping the cilantro, which I'm not very good at, this was easy to put together and we ate with the marinated flank steak recipe on this site. My 2 year old enjoyed eating this as well.

Good stuff! To make it healthier, I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil and  organic, pure maple syrup for the sugar. I added an avocado and served it over mixed field greens, and topped it with baked, cajun-seasoned tortilla strips. I also used fresh, raw corn cut from the cob--the sweetness really worked well with the balsamic, and the snappy texture was a nice balance to the smoothness of the beans and avocado. This is definitely a keeper--next time, I'll try adding black olives.

This is good as a side salad, and also wrapped in a tortilla with cheese and baked until crispy outside. It's a solid recipe, although I would suggest cutting the vinegar down by half.

A little sweet as prepared.  I would cut back on the balsamic vinegar next time.

Having read other comments I added 15 oz corn, some red pepper I had on hand for color. Didn’t have time to marinate overnight just 2-3 hours but was still good. Nice for summer. Would definitely make again.

This was easy & turned out yummy.  I’m not totally sold in the balsamic flavor combo with the Southwest ingredients.  I did add red onion. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this salad many times. People seem to really like it. The only thing I do different is to add halved cherry tomatoes for color and I use frozen corn that has been rinsed and drained instead of canned corn. Some of my friends eat it  as a dip with corn chips. Yum.

Super easy and so very good! I modified a few things because I had to make do with what I had; I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and honey instead of white sugar. I also added some onion per the other reviews. Make sure you let it sit overnight like the directions say. I made the mistake of first having it 3 hours after making it and it was okay, but it was WAY better the 2nd and 3rd day. I can easily see this entering my lunch meal prep rotation!

I loved the dressing that went with this! I didn't add cumin or cilantro because they are not my favorites and I added some home grown garden salsa peppers.

Delicious!

Loved the seasoning for this. I did add 1 avocado, 2 tomatoes, 1/2 an onion, and 1/ 4 cup of quinoa, some extra salt (~1/2 tablespoon) to take it up a notch.

I love to use white balsamic vinegar. Seems sweeter, and because it's clear, it doesn't discolor the corn like the dark balsamic.

Went lighter on the spices but added red onion, lots of lime juice and cilantro, though.  Also tried using Trader Joe's roasted corn.  Excellent.

I took this to the summer picnic at work as the Vegan Salad option. None was left! Everyone loved it. I added a bit of green onion and 2 small red and orange peppers for color and crunch. It is very quick to make and is a great addition to the standard picnic spread.

I love this salad and have made it many times.  It is a lunch staple for me, served with avocado.  The dressing is perfect.  The only thing I do differently is to add a chopped red pepper and green onions.  It adds a little bit of veggies to the meal, and makes it a little more colourful.  Great recipe!

I had one serving, and my husband ate the rest! Really excellent side dish.  I think it is a versatile recipe that you could add anything to; bacon, tomato, peppers, red onion, etc. p.s.: I've made this twice, once marinated all day, the second time only and hour.  Great both ways!

This was pretty good but I think because the looks of it not many people at Fibers of Love tried it.  Next time I would make it more than 1 day ahead of time, maybe up to a week. Keeps really well. I served it with the Creamy White chili. I really liked the taste of it only next time I won't double the recipe.

I make this regularly and it always gets great reviews. I have taken to adding in about a half a chopped sweet onion from time to time. If I don't have one handy, though, I still like it! Easy and really very tasty!

This was a great side dish to our barbecued pork tenderloin. I used the Grilled Corn on the Cob recipe from this site with two cobs of corn which I then shucked and cooled. I used a really expensive aged balsamic vinagrette. I threw in about 1/4 cup of chopped Vidalia onion and 1/4 cup of chopped celery. Unfortunately, I didn't have any cilantro but next time I make it I'll be sure to have some on hand. The great thing is you can add or omit vegetables or change the beans to whatever you have on hand.

Awesome, I'll definitely be making this again. I'll add more cumin and chilli powder next time. Overnight didn't do it justice. Way better after 3 days in the fridge.

Love this with a few minor changes.  I reduced the balsamic to 2 TBL and eliminated the sugar as the balsamic is sweet enough. I added some fresh red pepper and a little sweet onion, and it was amazing.   Thanks for a fabulous easy recipe!

Love the taste & simple to prepare!  I skipped the cilantro since we aren't fans.  Added a bit of chopped sweet onion but was great either way.  Take a taste & it is hard to stop eating it!

Super tasty and fast. This is my summertime go-to salad to share at BBQs. Kids love the sweet and tangy taste. I improvise and add diced red onions for color and kick.

My husband and I loved this I altered it adding a little yellow onion -- we grilled chicken strips that were marinated in a chipotle rub and topped the salad with them. Great recipe.

I have made this several times and I enjoy it as written. However, recently I've doubled all the spices and added 1 cup of cooked red quinoa and minced red, yellow and green peppers. When I do that, it serves as a heartier side dish.

I used fresh grilled corn instead of canned corn - perfect!  Definitely chill overnight for flavors to blend or the balsamic will overpower the dish.

Oh.my.gosh!  This is outstanding!  Black beans make the think of bold & heavy, but the balsamic vinegar makes this dish so light and refreshing!  It's a great summer dish!  I did add red onion, as suggested by others, which I think added a little more depth to it.  It was fine without the red onion, but I liked it better with.  Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing Jodi T!

Very tasty and easy recipe. I've made this type of salad in the past but have always used more ingredients.  This was simple, cheap and easy to make.  I added one tomato, chopped very fine, garlic and onion powder.  I also used 4 cans of corn to 2 cans of black beans.  The dressing was olive oil and white vinegar.

Really good!  Did not use balsamic vinegar.  I chose white wine vinegar which I had readily available.  This is a good basic recipe.  We had it on brown rice which was awesome.

Made this tonight 03-01-2015 turned out really good,  I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil cause that is what I had in pantry. I did add 3/4 of yellow sweet onion, a original 10oz can diced tomatoes & green chilies from Hill Country Fare used rice vinegar instead of balsamic cause that's what I had, added all other ingredients to the exact measurements. This will definitely be part of my side dishes, tonight we had chicken lettuce wraps with this on side, and my family just raved. Thank You for this recipe......   From San Antonio Texas O. Santiago

I really like black beans and corn. However, this was less than good. It would be great if the recipe owner suggested what kind / type of balsamic vinegar to use. I went to the store, randomly selected one and tried the recipe. All you taste is vinegar.

This recipe has become one of my favorites. I use it as a base with the following changes: 
- I add chopped green and red bell peppers to add texture and additional color (1/2 of each)
- I substitute italian parsley with cilantro 
- I slightly reduce the amount of vinegar and
- I use olive oil

This has a great flavor! It tastes very fresh and summery to me.  I made it as per the recipe, and then I also made a version where I included chopped up avocado and tomato.  I think you could include a pretty good range of beans or vegetables and they'd all taste great in this dressing.

We didn't like this, even though we love balsamic and put only that on our salads...it just was too overpowering and didn't meld well with the cilantro.
May try the lime version because the texture was great.

I have tried many Corn and Bean combinations, and this is the best!  As others had recommended, I added 6 chopped green onions and 1 chopped red pepper.  Great flavor.  I also added it to my taco salad.

Pretty good, added a diced red pepper for color and flavor. Might use less sugar next time.

This recipe is great as written, but it is very forgiving.  Don't be afraid to use any combination of vinegars if you don't have balsamic. I usually add chopped red onion and chopped avocado, which I soak in lemon juice.  Anything you add can only enhance it, in my opinion.  Chopped red or other colored peppers are another nice addition.  Have consistently received high compliments whenever I serve this.  The only unfortunate thing is that I never have any leftovers! :-(

Great, Added fresh minced garlic bud to the dressing and put in a jar in the fridge until needed.  Mix any beans and/or veggies, quinoa, rice.

I LOVE black beans! I sooooo wanted to LOVE this.  But, I had to toss it.  The vinegar was the problem.  I made it a second time...omitting the vinegar/oil/sugar; instead, I used juice from a fresh lime.  SO MUCH BETTER!!  I hate to toss out anything...so I tried making enchiladas from the first batch.  Even enchilada sauce and cheese couldn't wipe out the taste of the vinegar for me. Sorry!!!

Wonderful flavor! I followed the recipe as directed substituting frozen corn for canned and omitting cilantro (kids don't care for it). I doubled the recipe and served it along side brown rice with optional toppings of fresh tomatoes and avocado to make it a full meal. A huge hit! The salad has wonderful flavor with just the right amount of spice. Highly recommend! Delicious!!!

Pretty good!  I used apple cider vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  Also I added a little more sugar than called for because I thought it needed a little more sweetness.  All in all it was a super quick and tasty side dish!

When I tasted the dressing before mixing everything together I found the vinegar flavor to be just a bit overpowering, so I added about a tsp. of honey to even out the flavors (agave nectar would also be great, I bet!). I also added some fresh diced tomatoes and onions, and just a bit of lime juice to the finished mix. If you don't have time to refrigerate overnight, you can use frozen corn (thawed just a bit so it's cold but no longer frozen) to cut down on the fridge time in a pinch -- it will chill your other ingredients as you mix. Next time I may experiment with adding some lime zest for more of a flavor kick.

I just made this for my family and it is wonderful.  I was sceptical at first because of the mix of flavor, but in the end the only thing I did different was to put some chopped cilantro in the mix when I made it and let it sit in the frig for the day instead of overnight.  Paired it up with chicken taco's made from leftover chicken for a great meal.  I will certainly make this again!

This salad is delicious and goes well with many foods that I like. I didn't have cilantro but the garden still had a few chives, so I used those.
Great recipe - thank you!

This salad just sings with flavor.  The spices are perfectly balanced and blend together beautifully, especially when refrigerated overnight. I like to add a chopped bell pepper and some onion to add pleasing depth and crunch.  My 12 year old daughter begs for this salad in her lunch, she can't get enough of it!

Surprisingly good! Followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it! With leftovers I added some purple onion. I wouldn't suggest adding the onion to it, as others have suggested, unless you plan to serve it with chips.

This is a tasty and health party dip.  You can scoop it with a chip or use it in a taco with chicken or pork.  I took it to a superbowl party and it was gone in seconds.  A really good, guilt-free way to snack.

I made this for a pot luck since my friend is a vegan. It was a BIG hit!!  I get asked to bring it all the time. I added diced avocado which adds another texture. 

Great as a salad or served with corn chips as a dip.

I'd give this 10 stars if I could!! This has become my favorite side dish of all time. It goes with everything (at least when I'm cooking) but I love to serve it with tacos as it makes a great topper. All of the ingredients are things I have in hand and it's so quick to throw together. Not being a big fan of spicy I was a little leery of chili powder and cumin but they give just enough zest without being overpoweringly hot. I do often add some dried minced onion and garlic, and I skip the cilantro. My dad's only complaint is that every time I make this he eats too much of it.

This was really good, a little messy but really good. The messy part is probably my own fault though because I don't think I drained the black beans well enough. However it made really cute pictures of my 10 month old and he loved it.

I added a diced small onion and 1/2 of a diced red bell pepper.  That was a 5 star dish.  Without those, it would only be a 4 star.  Delish!  I have made it several times now and have taken it to a party.  It always gets gobbled up.

Surprisingly tasty for so few ingredients!. Next time will replace 1 tbsp of balsamic with white vinegar or lemon juice as the taste is strong but good. Serve with fresh chopped tomatoes...

This salad was the perfect addition to my summer bbq. I added some chopped red onions for extra crunch- but the dressing itself was AMAZING!

LOOOVE this recipe!  I do think it needs a little chopped red pepper for colour and crunch, but otherwise PERFECT!  I discovered this recipe last week and have already made 4 batches!

This makes my mouth water just thinking about it. I always double the recipe, use bigger cans of corn, and throw in a yellow or red bell pepper. It is delicious!

Great on it's own or part of a taco salad or just atop some romaine. Will cut a tiny bit of the balsamic vinegar, so just shy of 1/4c for me.

Easy, tasty. This didn't last long. We left out the cilantro because we don't like this herb and I added a bit more chili powder to compensate.

I made this for my husband and I thought that he wouldn't like it.  But I was pleasantly surprised when he said I could make this again. He ate all the left overs.
I followed the recipe to the letter.  I like that it is so healthy.

This is a great recipe with a perfect amount of flavor. I added some sliced jicama for a nice crunchy texture. I think it would also taste good with a a bit of cubed avocado mixed in.

Really good, added green onion and diced red pepper, 2 cans of black beans, have also used red onion and yellow and orange peppers. Have also added a can of Rotel or diced tomatoes drained. Used olive oil instead of veggie oil.

Good as written, but improved by the addition of a 1/2  onion (finely chopped).  I also recommend using 2Tbsp lime juice in place of 2Tbsp of the vinegar - cilantro & lime were made for each other! :-)   It is also delicious when served warm - 10min @ 350F in the oven (direct from the refrigerator) was perfect. Thank you for a wonderful salad Jodi T.

This is fabulous!  Following a friend's suggestion I add 1 can of Hearts of Palm and then right before serving add one chopped Avocado.  Delish!!  Skip the sugar and add lemon juice for a crisper taste.

Loved this!  The flavor of the cumin and chili powder is what makes it.  I added a bit of onion and some tomatoes for color and additional flavor.  My husband asked that I heat it on the stove, and it was even MORE delicious that way!  Fabulous- making it this afternoon for our BBQ!

I followed this recipe almost exactly besides skipping the cliantro and adding a clove of crushed garlic and some green onion. This turned out great and I haven't even let it marinate yet! This will go awesome along side some grilled chicken breasts. Thanx for sharing.

This is a great dish to make on a hot summer night to take for lunches during the week.  I've added to the original recipe by adding a can of red kidney beans, 2 chopped garlic cloves and about a 1/4 cup of chopped red onion.  I then increase all the spices and balsamic vinegar by 25%.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

Really good and fast to make salad. I couldn't wait to eat it, so I took it out of the fridge several times for a bite. So easy with most ingredients already on hand.

YUM.  This recipe was so good and easy!  Took me about 5 min.  I did the dressing exactly as the recipe says except I didn't have the cilantro.  Tasted awesome anyway!  I used black beans, white navy beans, some shredded purple cabbage and celery (added great crunchiness).  I didn't have corn on hand but I would think that would taste great too.  I've been looking for a recipe to use up all the cans of beans I get for free through the WIC program and this is it!  Excited to try it again with different beans/add-ins.  Maybe chopped raw carrots next time?

Fantastic! I actually only used 1/8 cup balsamic vinegar and it was perfect for my taste. Also used olive oil instead of vegetable and halved the salt. Really good, will make again. Thanks :)

This is delicious. A great cool side dish or easy snack for tortilla chips. I added green pepper for color and flavor, but other than that, the ingredients were spot on, even before it had completely marinated. Two thumbs up!

Wonderful.  Followed recipe exactly except added a few green onions.  Excellent blend of flavors with no one playing too big of a role.  I served it with chicken enchiladas and expect I'll make it again.  Another bonus (excluding cilantro), I already had all the ingredients.

Was looking for something to take to a Mexican dinner with authentic Mexican cooks. Found a number of similar recipes; but this one sounded best. Used this as my basic recipe but added diced red bell pepper, sliced green onions with tops and feta cheese. It was a hit and all I brought home was an empty bowl.

I liked it but it was too sweet and it was swimming in dressing so if I make it again, I'll eliminate the sugar and reduce the dressing.

Very good base recipe that can be altered to suit your own taste.  I added some chopped red onion and all thought it was a nice change from the normal BBQ salads.

This was ok. I thought the dressing was real good & it didn't taste bad but I'm not a huge fan of black beans to begin with so it was just ok. I also added onions & peppers to it because I thought just corn & black beans was a little bland. It was good but not something I really like but thats just my opinion, my hubby didn't like it at all he thought it was weird having the beans uncooked.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I've made it numerous times and the only thing I've ever added is chopped red onion.  I like it as a side dish with a taco dinner, but I LOVE it the next day as dressing for a taco salad made with the leftovers.

This is in our regular rotation of lunch foods.  I cut the balsamic vinegar to about half of 1/4 cup because it is so pungent.  Very unique flavor and healthy.

I made this recipe last night as a side dish to some rippers (deep fried hotdogs). This salad has a great taste and the seasonings were right on the money. I did add some homemade pickled jalapenos to add a little more kick. I will definately make this again and do a little experimentation. Great recipe!

Sooo delicious.  I am biased as I really love this combo of vinegar, oil, cumin and cilantro.  You really can't go wrong....and when you throw in veggies, grains or beans it can't help but work.

I thought this was just okay.  I didn't particularly like the balsamic, and I usually really like using balsamic in recipes.  I think it overpowered too much.

Very good.  I made a few changes, like adding chopped onion and red pepper.  Also, did not have cilantro on hand.  Although I did make a few changes, I feel this is a great recipe that you can tweak a little to fit your preferences.

What a unique recipe!  It was a little heavy on the balsamic but a nice combo with the spices.  I did not have any cilantro but I know that would have added a freshness to it. I may also add a can of Rotel next time.

This is fantastic.  I used frozen corn (1 cup) and substituted honey for sugar.  Adding diced onion and some fresh lime juice make it a 5 star recipe, in my opinion.  I can take or leave bell peppers.  Overnight is ideal, but I usually make it in the morning and let it marinate all day.  Thanks for sharing.

UPDATE #2: I JUST FINISHED ALL OF THE LEFTOVERS - IN ONE SITTING!!! ABSOLUTELY SUPERB! UPDATE: THIS IS MUCH, MUCH BETTER AFTER MARINATING OVERNIGHT. I COULDN'T RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO TAKE A BITE OF THE LETOVERS THIS MORNING, AND OH MY - TANGY WITH JUST A HINT OF SPICE!!! This was pretty good. Not my favorite salad, but I did enjoy it (my bf didn't though...). Made this as a side to accompany Spicy Turkey Burgers by Food_Diva. The 2 complement ea. other nicely! I was contemplating making Black Bean & Corn Salad II by Jen (since it didn't require 8+ hrs. of marinating), but the marinade for this salad appealed more to me. Since this was a last-min. fix, I let everything marinate in the fridge for only a couple of hrs. (but I am sure it would be better after marinating overnight - there IS a reason the submitter instructs to do so!). My only changes were to use an entire 15.5 oz. can of corn (8.75 oz. is not enough IMHO) & add a sm. chopped red pepper & 2 green onions. I think tomatoes or jalapeno peppers would also be great additions. I also think this would be an excellent salsa paired w/ tortilla chips. Thx. for sharing this summer-fresh salad!

Very good and not too spicy.  I used thawed froozen corn instead of canned.  Even my 15 month old liked it.  I think it would be better with a little crunch like bell pepper, celery or onion.  Update:  I made again with green pepper and thought it was much improved.

I love that this is made with pantry staples.  Next time I will cut the amount of vinegar.  We had it tonight for dinner without letting it sit overnight.  I'm hoping that the leftovers will mellow out.

This was good, but I think it needs some changes to be great.  Next time I will use 1/2 the amount of balsamic vinegar, add red onions, and decrease the sugar by 1/2.  Would also be good with bell peppers.

I made this recipe using a 15oz can of corn and adding a diced red bell pepper. I thought the balsamic seasoning was a little strong, but otherwise was a nice salad.

An instant favorite! It's a great side dish for tacos, but also makes a good dip for tortilla chips.

Loved this - not that I had much ot a taste, my husband ate almost the entire salad in front of the hockey game!! Aidn't use cilantro (didn't have any), added chopped red bell pepper and crumbled feta. Will try to use  a little less balsamic next time as there was a lot left in the bottom of the bowl.

Very good and tasty (and easy) salad to toss together in a matter of minutes! Next time I will make this salad ahead of time and refrigerate it. I added some freshly minced cloves of garlic. I like it as written, but next time I might substitute some lime juice for the balsamic vinegar.

This was amazing! We made it right before our BBQ, so it didn't have a chance to sit for the prescribed amount of time, but it tasted great. Even my 18 month old loved it! So simple and yummy.

It was OK at best for me.  Personally I thought it was too sweet, definitely would NOT add the sugar next time. If I do make this again I would add more of the other spices, definitely more cumin and even some garlic powder.

The dressing is fantastic.  I've made this several times, and prefer to add a little pico de gallo to the mixture to use the the recipe as a bean salsa (a little chopped tomato would work well, too).  It's great served with tortilla chips.

I used (from Trader Joe's) the roasted corn (frozen food section) and the canned Cuban black beans.  I made the dressing but only used the balsamic, oil, salt, pepper, and sugar. Because I used the spiced black beans I didn't really need the cumin & chili powder. I also added fresh lemon juice and some red pepper flakes...and WOW.  This was awesome!  I topped it with chopped fresh tomato and avocado. The roasted corn gives it another zing.  My sister and I polished off the whole batch ourselves. A definite winner.

I'm giving this 4 stars because my husband absolutely loved this salad. I thought the balsamic vinegar was too strong so I wasn't impressed. Because the husband loved it, I will make it again but will scale back on the vinegar and add some bell peppers.

Very, very good. I made a few changes... grilled 2 ears of fresh corn instead of using canned, and also cut up 2 grilled green onions to mix with the beans & corn. (Also used homemade beans, which always helps!) In addition, misread the recipe and stirred the cilantro right into the dressing instead of using as a garnish, but since I was serving it right away instead of refridgerating it didn't matter. Finally, added the zest & juice of one lime to the balsamic mixture, which added a nice depth of flavor. However, the key to this recipe is the spice combination, which is right on... I will be using this dressing a lot!

This is a tasty quick salad to make.  I have made a couple changes to suit our tastes.  I add approx a quarter cup of finely chopped red onion, half a cup of red peper and spice it up by substituting the regular chilli powder for Chipotle Chilli pepper...delicious!

I added a yellow heirloom tomato that I picked up from the farmer's market and a red onion. I don't like fresh cilantro so I left that out. This recipe is very versatile and its not easy to mess up :) The flavor is great!

Great recipe...fast and easy.  I made this as a dip for tortilla chips, but I agree with Jodi T., this would be very good served up in a warm tortilla with some sour cream.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  (Oh, thought I should mention that I forgot the cilantro, it was missed, but it was still delicious.)

I loved this salad.  I did cut back on the balsamic vinegar, even though I love it, and I thought it was perfect.  My husband put it on fajitas, so I did too and really enjoyed it.

This was really good!  I did need to add a bit more salt for my taste.  So easy.  It will now become a BBQ staple at my house.

This is so good.  I can see how some might find the vinegar overwhelming but to me thats what I think a corn/bean salad should taste like.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, added (4)green onions, and omitted the sugar.  It seemed like it needed some color and I was out of red pepper so I added a can of dark red kidney beans and it looks and tastes fantastic.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I made this as a side dish for pulled pork sandwiches and it was even better the next day.  I used an entire back of Trader's Joe's frozen grilled sweet corn, one can of black beans, and a chopped red bell pepper. I kept the dressing amount the same and it was the perfect ratio.  I also added some garlic for extra flavor.

My husband and I loved this!  I added some red pepper and onion, and rolled it up in a flour tortilla.  Make sure to marinate overnight---it's worth the wait!  It would be great as an appetizer served with tortilla chips, too.

I will rate this 4 stars because my recipe is almost identical and it really is a good recipe with a few changes.   The recipe I use calls for 2 cans of beans and 16 ounces of frozen corn per 1/4 cup of vinegar, so that is probably why it was too much for many of you.   I also use balsamic syrup and thin it out with a tiny bit of malt vinegar, omit the sugar because balsmic syrup is sweet, add some chopped green onions, chopped red and green bell peppers and 1 tsp garlic powder.   

This recipe is really good if you make a few changes.   Serve this with Tostido Scoops and Sour Cream........YUMMY.   

Oh and you can also add chopped jalapeno for added zip.   

Recipe can be halved with no problems.

Not a fan, but others were.  Couldn't taste anything other than vinegar, even though I used half the amount suggested.  Probably won't make again.

very good, but next time I would cut back on the vinegar a bit.  Also, it is much better the second and third day!

This is a quick recipe that I was able to put together quickly after finding out I was supposed to bring a salad to a taco-themed work luncheon.  I didn't have any cilantro on hand, added a bit of garlic powder, used frozen corn, and used frozen black beans that I had previously prepared from dry.  I was a little nervous about the dish having never tried it and the lack of cilantro.  However, after marinating over night, the ladies at work LOVED it!  They were particularly impressed with the dressing, ate it all, and requested the recipe.

Great start - I give this 5 STARS with my additions/changes. I wanted this for a dip to serve with Scoops Tostito chips. This is perfect! I used a fresh cilantro blend from Gourmet Garden and cut it back to 2 TBSP (personal preference for less cilantro). I also used a 15 oz. can of corn, added about 2 TBSP of salsa, about 1/4 cup of chopped sweet red pepper and 2-3 TBSP of chopped onion. I haven't let it marinate overnight yet because I mixed it together and tried it with the chips and couldn't stop eating it. Even my picky 5 & 7 year olds like it! Amazing!

This was a big hit at a "Mexican pot luck."  I double the recipe, using three cans of beans and two cans of corn.  I also added one red bell pepper and half a purple onion as others suggested.  Others noted that it was a little sweet, so I eliminated the sugar.  It was yummy!

I'm giving this only four stars as it was a great start. However I used some suggestions from others and added red onion and red bell pepper. These additions made it even better.  This is a great base that lends itself to many variations.

This was fantastic! I added green onion, red pepper, and tomato. But I'm still giving it 5 stars because I think it was the sauce and seasoning that really made it. Delicious alone, as a burrito filling, or served like a salsa with tortilla chips. I think I'll be making this one a lot!!

Great recipe.  Used the mexicali corn and added chopped black olives and onion.
