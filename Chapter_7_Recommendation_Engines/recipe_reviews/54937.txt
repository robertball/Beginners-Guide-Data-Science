Beginner cooks - This is a great, great recipe!  So quick, so easy, and SO DELICIOUS.  I used to bread chicken tenders and fry them, and was never quite happy with how they came out.  This recipe is much healthier, much less messy, and the tenders come out really delicious.  To the crushed cornflakes, I added about a 1/2 a teaspoon of garlic powder, a 1/4 teaspoon of paprika and 1/2 cup of crushed Ritz crackers.  SO YUMMY!

What's not to love, these are great.  I used parchment paper to line my baking pan with.  And I added about 1/3 cup of Parmesan cheese to the cornflake mixture. I also used chicken breast that I cut into strips.   You won't be able to eat just one!

Although I added more seasonings, we really enjoyed this recipe. No one wanted the marinara sauce so I made a honey/mustard/mayo dipping sauce. Good stuff!

This was pretty good -- I didn't drizzle the butter over top of them and they still turned out nicely... very crunchy but it is a nice change for chicken. I also used regular chicken breasts, and cooking them for 20 minutes is perfect. I also added some spices to the crust mixture -- seasoned pepper and cajun spices.

Not your typical greasy chicken tender.  This recipe is a gem even for a foodie like myself!  I was simply looking for a recipe to satisfy my child's picky ways, but surprised the adults with the best homemade chicken nuggets.  Best part...not greasy!  I did slightly adjust the recipe adding freshly grated parmesan to the cereal mix, and used Special K rice cereal (ground to a fine crumb) and 1 T. poultry seasoning, cut up tenders to nugget size, and thinned the egg mixture with milk.  My bite-size nuggets were ready in 10-12 minutes and were just PERFECTLY tender.  This will become a standard recipe in my house.

Oh yum....You know, I was doubtful of these just because I couldn't understand how something that was so easy to whip up, could be good. Low and behold they were fantastic!! I loved that they were pleasantly crunchy and not too spicy, but if you were looking to spice things up a bit, adding your own spices would be easy as pie. Try this recipe, it's a nice change from plain ol' chicken.

This recipe is great!  I like to serve the chicken tenders on a whole wheat bun with cheese and marinara sauce.  These chicken tenders make a wonderful italian chicken sandwich.

Wonderful recipe!  Our kids (ages 6 and 9) kept going back for more even after we had finished eating because they were so good.  I loved how crispy the cornflakes made these chicken strips and the flavor was perfect.  We didn't use any dipping sauce.  I did deviate a little from the recipe and added chili powder to the dry coating mix.  I will definitely make these again.

This is a good basic coating recipe for chicken. I also added garlic salt and paprika for a little more zing

Fabulous!!!!! Everyone devoured these. Simple to prepare and tastes wonderful. The appearance was terrific and loved how they were crisy but not oily. Used chicken breasts cut into tenders and pounded them. Also added some garlic powder.

This was very good and easy.  I added some poultry seasoning just because my kids LOVE that added to most anything.  Everyone thought it was awesome.

I increased the servings to 16 and found that I probably could have gotten by with only doubling the coating - I had a TON left over. These were a huge hit at my family reunion. I was in charge of dinner one night and served these with boxed roasted garlic mashed potatoes and frozen green beans stir fried with red onion and bacon pieces. Everyone raved and it was all so easy. I also made the honey mustard sauce recipe from this site to drizzle on top - whoa! Soooo good.

Excellent recipe!  It's much crispier and is not greasy like fried chicken is.  I cook it all of the time for a quick dinner and my friends and I love it!

I didn't have any chicken tenderloins, so I used cut up chicken breasts.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as it is written.  Very easy to make and my husband (who is not a big chicken fan) really liked it a lot.  I haven't tried it yet.  But it was a simple recipe that my husband loves, so it's already a five star recipe in my opinion.
