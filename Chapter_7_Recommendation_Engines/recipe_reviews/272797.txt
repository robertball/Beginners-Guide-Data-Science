tired of banana bread so I added unsweetened coconut and some drained crushed pineapple for half of the applesauce. Results were spectacular, moist tender bread with a flavorful twist!

This is a great option for those who are baking gluten free and vegan-which can be tricky. I found this took longer to bake and it was still gummy and raw-ish when I cut into it. Back in the oven it went. All better now and good flavor.
