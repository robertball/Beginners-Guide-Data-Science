This was just okay. When I worked for Seattle's Best Coffee, we used to make hot coffee drinks which were a mixture of hot oregon chai, a few pumps of Hershey's chocolate and a shot of coffee. Making it at home is just not the same.

I actually had just tried making something similar to this about 5 minutes before I read this recipe. I used a Lipton Spiced Chai tea bag, Swiss Miss Pick Me Up Hot Chocolate mix (has extra caffeine) and then added some ginger and freshly grated nutmeg then stirred it with a cinnamon stick. Delicious.

Not bad...A little odd at first, but the more I drank, the more I wanted it.

Wow, this was surprisingly good! It was like hot chocolate with a light Christmas spice flavor. I used a Tazo brand decaf chai tea bag and a dark chocolate sugar-free hot chocolate packet. TY

I love this drink!!! I usually buy the tazo chai in the carton and half it with milk (no water) and a packet of nestle topped with whip cream. So warm & comforting with energy to still clean the kitchen lol.

Spice & cocoa?  Yes please!  This was very tasty.  Like hot chocolate with a kick.  I had a loose-leaf Tulsi Chai tea that I used with this; I let it steep slightly longer than 2 mins.  Maybe I will try a ginger tea with chocolate next time.
