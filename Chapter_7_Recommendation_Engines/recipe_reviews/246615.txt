I love this recipe and make it a few times a week for breakfast. I sub a handful of spinach for the kale and leave out the beans.

This was good. I could handle it with no added sweetner, but my husband used 4 Splenda packets. I added 3 ice cubes and used a frozen banana. I used a good handful of chopped kale. I used almond milk in place of water and still added some extra water to thin it down. Thanks!

I honestly thought I would hate this so I made it on a day where I didn't have to rush to work....and fix something else for breakfast! Ha ha! 

Funny thing was, I liked it so much, I made another one to freeze for those rushed days. I plan to make many more green smoothies to freeze for when school re-starts in August (I'm a teacher and am off this month).

Freezing ahead also fixes that "leftover avocado/kale/etc. going bad in the frige" problem.  ??
