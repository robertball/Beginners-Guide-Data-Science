This is a great recipe!  Here is what I did to change it.  I used my favorite pancake mix, and prepared that according to the package.  It called for a cup of the mix, so I measured everything else accordingly.  1 teaspoon of the coaco powder, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp clove, (added a dash of nutmeg), and 2 tbsp molasses. I then spooned in a bit more of the pancake mix until the batter had the correct texture. They turned out so good!!  My boyfriends family always does a Christmas morning pajama breakfast for friends and family.  I think I will whip up the batter and take it over there to cook!!

Although I was excited by the enticing ingredients, the final results did not find favor with me.  The abundance of baking powder caused a volcano-like effct of the batter.  Six extra egg yolks remaining after making pancakes seemed like a waste.  In addition, two of my three kids said they liked the flavor of other pancakes I make much better.  Sorry!

these were really good we had them with fresh whipped cream and sliced bananas. i did modify this recipe a little, we left out the hazelnuts, used 3 whole eggs, instead of 6 whites, upped the cinnamon and cloves to 1 tsp, the ginger to 2 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. after the batter was done i tasted it, uncooked and it just tasted like it needed a litts someting extra, so i added 2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

Rating on the recipe as written, this would not have been pleasant!  6 T baking powder is way too much!!!  I used 1 T, and they turned out great!  I used whole wheat flour and soy milk to make these into yummy pancakes.

I assumed that 6 tablespoons of baking powder was a typo, and so used only 6 teaspoons - it was still a little salty for my tastes. I also used 3 whole eggs instead of the egg whites. I also added cardamom as someone suggested (1/2tsp cloves, 1/2 cardamom). The addition of the hazlenuts was wonderful.

My husband said 'Awesome' just like the other review said. We had it for breakfast. The only problem I had was the molasses that I had such a time getting out. I needed a new jar of molasses.

These were a great idea, and after a lot of modification, they were great-tasting as well!  I think there are a number of typos in the original recipe, so I came up with my own take on it.  Here it is: 2 tbsp baking powder,  3 tbsp cocoa,  2 tsp ginger,  3 eggs,  some extra flour, @1/2 c. to thicken to proper consistency.  Enjoy!

These are pretty tasty, not as tasty as another recipe I've tried and can't find now. I halved the recipe and got 8 medium sized pancakes. I used 1 entire egg and one egg white. I used only 2 tsp of baking powder and they were still super fluffy. I also didn't have cloves or hazelnuts, but I was generous with the cinnamon and added a little bit of nutmeg (careful not more than 1tsp for half a recipe, it's strong). I also added more molasses than called for and a little b. sugar cause I over did the nutmeg. Oh yes, and of course I always add walnuts or something protein-atious to my pancakes!

These were amazingly good. I was looking for a recipe that could compare to the Gingerbread Pancakes I've had at the International House of Pancakes and these are them! Even better than IHOP's version and they make a lot. Warning, they are wonderful enough by themselves, but if you have a sweet tooth, by all means add the syrup - I did.

These were pretty good!  Definetly better than regular pancakes.  Due to rolling with what I had on hand I subsituted allspice for cloves, finely grated bakers chocolate for coco powder and I used a bit of Frangelico for hazelnuts.  Everyone enjoyed the flavor.  I would make them again.  I only gave them 4 stars cause I thought they were alot of work for what they were.  But I also had to grate the chocolate and allspice.

My husband loved these pancakes:)  The kids and I thought they were o.k.   I made them as directed but will definitely double the spices next time.  I served these with butter and regular syrup.

Per other review I only used 2 tablespoons of baking powder and it turned out great.  The kids loved it for breakfast this morning.  It didn't taste as much like gingerbread as they would have liked but they still loved it.

I didn't have molasses so I used a little brownsugar melted in butter. Worked well. Also, didn't have eggs, so I did without. The pancakes weren't as 'cakey' as I would have liked. Next time, remind me to get eggs. :-)

This recipe rocks! Spicey and hearty. These are the pancakes you make to reward people for shoveling snow or some other cold wintertime labor. Make sure to add whipped cream on top to really wow 'em when you serve. :)

we cut the baking powder in half, couldn't get the hazelnuts so we didn't put them in, used 3 eggs instead of 6 egg whites and added a pinch of nutmeg.  they were great with whip cream and the kids loved the red and green sprinkles.  Very tasty.

This recipe is good.  I would double the spices next time though.  We also added chocolate chips and dried cranberries.    Also note that this recipe makes a lot!  I scaled it back to serve 6 and ended up with 18 - 5" pancakes!  Plenty to freeze and pop in the toaster for a fast breakfast!

I must say, normally I really enjoy reading other people's suggestions and tweaking recipes accordingly.  I found with this recipe that it wasn't a case of "add X and it will be even better."  This recipe seems to be a disaster and needs many revisions to make the taste and texture even close to what it should be!  After my MANY revisions, I couldn't even remember how I eventually got to the yummy gingerbread pancakes I ate this morning for breakfast!  This is not a case of "if you can read, you can cook!"

Though the recipe doesn't say it, I believe you ADD THE OIL to the batter. I also added 6 Tbs of sugar for a slightly sweet flavor.

Blueberry syrup is a delicious compliment to these pancakes. I just blended blueberries with my maple syrup in the food processor.

My husban loved them and to me they were just ok to me.  I did not have molasses, used an old trick of 1/3 cup brown sugar with 1/2 teaspoon of Cream of Tartar. Next time I will use cardamom in place of cloves and increase the ginger rom 1 1/2 teaspoons to 2 teaspoons.

These are tasty, but would benefit from the addition of sugar to the batter.  We topped our pancake stacks with whipped cream and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice.

I changed the flour to white whole wheat, used Egg Beaters With a Touch of Yolk (1/2 cup) and think the cloves is a bit much.  I only  made 1/2 a recipe and would suggest only about 1/4 t. cloves.  The pancakes are good, but the cloves taste is too strong.  Still--good.  The kids had fun with chocolate chips and I put maple syrup and some more chopped hazelnuts on mine.  Yum!

Fantastic recipe!  I am not a pancake person but when I tried this recipe I was pleased.  I did add chopped up bananas the second time I made it and thought it was an improvement.

I made this recipe once and I loved it. It turns out that my batter made about 20, which took up the whole pan, and with a family that eats a lot, it was gone in less than 3 days. I applaud this recipe.

Well.... mixed reviews on this one.  Did anyone else notice that the recipe didn't tell you to use the oil in the recipe or save it to oil the pan?  Maybe I was the only one confused.   I agree - the pancakes puffed up almost too much.  What ended up happening with our pancakes is that the insides didn't cook as much as the puffed up outsides.  I hadn't added the oil to the batter for my first 4 pancakes and they were just light "fluff" but once I added a little oil it was much more like a "regular" batter .  My husband, myself and my son liked the pancakes but not my daughter.  Not sure I'll make again until my daughter learns to love the taste of gingerbread!! :)

It was okay.  The pancakes tasted a little bitter and it wasn't as fluffy as I hoped it would be.  Would not make it again.

I like gingerbread, but I find it very rich and filling.  The same is true with these pancakes.  I did have to thin out the batter a bit, and they may not be as "light and fluffy" as you're used to, but I was expecting that.  The thing that I didn't like at all in this recipe are the hazelnuts.  Couldn't really taste them (so why add them?), but mostly, I didn't like what they added to the texture of the pancake.  I read the reviews, and I agree that there are some issues with ingredient amounts in this recipe.  I did reduce the baking powder and oil, increased the spices, and used 3 whole eggs instead of 6 egg whites (had nothing to do with 6 egg yolks).  My rating is based on how these pancakes tasted with some tweaking which ended up being  pretty good.  And as a side comment, the sliced bananas were really good on them!

I got 30 medium-sized pancakes out of this using a 1/4 cup to measure the batter.  I made it as written except I cut the baking powder in half.   Great recipe except for the baking powder.
