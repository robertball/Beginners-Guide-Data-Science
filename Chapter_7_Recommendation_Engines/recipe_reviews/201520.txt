The dish is excellent as is. But please don't make the same mistake I did! I decided to try an "instant" lazana noodle. It requires no boiling, just layer it in with the regular ingredients and in only 20 minutes it is fully cooked. Those noodles are disgusting. If the tuna and sauce combo weren't so good, we would have tossed the whole thing. But since the dish is yummy, we wound up picking the noodles out of it.

There is not enough sauce, it needs to be doubled or maybe almost tripled to prevent the noodles and the entire dish  from being dry.  There is way to much prep time involved in this recipe. I will stick with tuna casserole which is much easier and much more flavorful.

I think this recipe has potential and I like that it doesn't use a can of soup! I made it per the recipe, and I agree with one other reviewer who said that the sauce should be doubled. My suggestions are: - Double the sauce recipe - Put sauce on the pan, then add on top of the tuna mixture for each layer. - If you are feeling like more cheese, add mozzarella cheese with the layers, and add more cheese on top. - I prefer peas and corn for the vegetables, and I usually have those frozen. - Bake covered for 35 minutes. Don't broil (it seems unnecessary in my opinion, and is more to worry about).

My hubby is a tuna casserole fan.  Myself, not so much.  The only complaint that both of had with this recipe is that we thought it was dry.  I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8"x8" dish, cutting the lasagna noodles in half and fitting into the dish.  Half a recipe would have been six servings, but in this house, it was four.  The recipe doesn't say to add sauce between layers. I  did put a little on each layer, but it just wasn't enough. The minced garlic adds fantastic flavor to the sauce.   Nutritionally, this is a superstar, and I know that adding more sauce will change those values a little, but it also will take this from a four to a five star recipe.  We liked it, and I will make it again...with more sauce to make it creamier.

I'm only scoring this recipe 4 stars because I didn't have a couple of the ingredients (like lasagna noodles!) and so therefore I made this into a casserole instead.  As a casserole dish I rate this a 5 star recipe.   I substituted 5 cups mafalda pasta (bite-size lasagna looking noodles) for lasagna noodles.  I'm also allergic to egg white so omitted it, but you wouldn't need the egg if making this into a casserole.   I took other reviewers' advice and doubled the liquid and had no problem with dryness.   I only had two cans of tuna but that was *plenty*.   I mixed everything into the cream sauce, except the crackers and Italian seasoning, and then poured the cream mixture over the cooked pasta and combined before transferring everything to a 9x13 baking dish.  I didn't have crackers to make a topping with, so I topped it with a mixture of Panko and 1/2 tsp of Italian seasoning instead.  I baked as directed above but because I wasn't layering, I saved all the cheese for topping at the end.  Scrumptious!

I made a similar one minus the soda cracker. I used 3 lasagna sheets and a can of tuna in springwater, added bell peppers, carrots and sweet peas and some tomato puree topped with cheddar cheese. It was delicious! Will definitely make it again. :)

In the sauce I added a jar of Alfredo sauce  and topped it with fried soft bread crumbs...but did not use the cracker crumbs..It was yummy.

I should have listened to the people who said it was dry. It was. Darn it. It makes a big dish too and it's dry. I don't know how to fix it and I hate to throw it away.

I cooked this for my mother and sister tonight and we all agree this is  very good. Tuna casserole is one of my favorites.  But this time I thought about using lasagna instead and decided to give someone else's recipe a shot. 
The only thing that we all agreed was that it was a little dry. That very well could have been my fault.  I partially spilled a can of condensed broth and probably didn't get the proportions right  when adding water.
I used a different frozen veggies than I normally do. I used frozen stir fry veggies and I'm really glad I did. 
Next time I'm going to add a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup (not diluted) to this recipe. I also like the way crusty potatoes taste with tuna so instead of the cheesy topping with crackers, try it out the with crumbled potato chips or shoestring potatoes. Everything remains as is.

I give this four stars because I really, really liked the sauce however I made quite a few changes. I decided not to precook the lasagna noodles as a personal preference. Once my finished sauce (which I tripled ) was simmering, I put the 3 cans of tuna into the sauce and stirred it in. I then added finely chopped uncooked broccoli into the sauce and stirred that in. I let it simmer for 5 minutes then went on to layering. I started with a layer of the mixture, sprinkling some grated cheddar cheese before putting a layer of uncooked lasagna noodles. I continued to do this until the dish was full - sprinkling a generous amount of cheese on top, I baked it for 45 minutes and voila - amazing!! So creamy and delicious. Tuna was definitely not dry and the broccoli made you feel better about eating it. So really I just made a broccoli and tuna lasagna but the sauce from this recipe definitely elevated it  and that is the reason for the four stars.
