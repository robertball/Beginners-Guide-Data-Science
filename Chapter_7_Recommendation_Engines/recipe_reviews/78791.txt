To be honest, I used just store bought ranch dressing and horseradish-- it was awesome!!  I didn't have all the ingredients needed but used the idea instead!  It has a huge hit with my family!  Thanks

I found this too be too runny and lacking  any spice it was way too over powered by the tang of the butter milk. try using 1 cup of sour cream a package of dry ranch dressing mix, and follow with the ingrediants. It makes a fantastic dip

I followed the recipe exactly, however using non-fat sour cream and powdered buttermilk mixed with water.  The flavor of the dressing was a little bland.  It missed that distinctive "ranch" taste, perhaps owing to my use of powdered buttermilk.  Nonetheless, I think some additional seasonings would help.

I made the recipe as is (using fat free sour cream, skim milk with lemon juice for the buttermilk), creamy horseradish sauce, tabasco sauce and lots of pepper.  This would rate a 2-3 since it was definitely missing spices.  I added garlic powder, onion powder, Mrs. Dash original, a dried dill mix, chilli powder and crushed rep pepper flakes.  This made a decent veggie dip and was also good in my chicken salad sandwich.  It wasn't runny at all.  You just need to play around with this one to adjust to your own liking.

I'm sorry, as is this wasn't very good. Once I added some homemade dry ranch seasoning, it was much better.

I was really between a 2 and a 3 but went up since this is so easy to tweak to your liking. It really wasn't flavorful enough and the only flavor was horseradish which I'm not sure means "ranch" to me. However, I knew this might be the case and made it knowing I could use it as a base for something else if necessary. That's what I ended up doing, adding some additional seasonings, dijon mustard and using as a dip.

I think it was much too runny and I had to add a lot of spices to get it to the way I liked. (I ground up a beef bolion cube to get the flavor right)
