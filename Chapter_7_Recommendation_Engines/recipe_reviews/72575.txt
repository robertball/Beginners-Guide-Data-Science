I like the idea of butter in a quick bread, but experience has shown me that  you compromise some moistness. Breads made with oil are simply a lot more moist. I used half white and half brown sugar and, because I wasn't keen on the cloves, substituted pumpkin pie spice. I added about 2/3 c. dried cherries (really nice!) and glazed the warm bread with 1 c. powdered sugar and 2 T. half and half. All in all a good bread, and pretty too, but I think next time I might try adding about 2 T. of oil to the batter for additional moistness without sacrificing that great buttery flavor.

I made this recipe twice.  The first time I followed it exactly with white sugar and baked it for the full hour.  My bread was great, but a little burnt on the bottom.  The second time I substituted half of the white sugar with brown sugar and reduced the bake time to 45 minutes.  It was just perfect!!

Loved this recipe.  I did use brown sugar instead of white and shredded my apples instead of chopping.  It turned out simply lovely.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe exactly as directed, except that I made it as muffins to cut bake time for a special Valentine's Day breakfast. Turned out delicious! Just before putting them in the oven, I sprinkled turbinado sugar on top. I baked them for 20 minutes at 375 degrees and they turned out perfect. Made 18 muffins.

I make loaves of bread for my husband's employees every Christmas. We've moved, but I have recieved emails from 10 employees at our old location requesting a couple loaves of this bread, if I happen to be coming to town. It's one of my top requests. The only change I make is to add 1/2 teaspoon on both ginger and nutmeg.

This is very nice!  The only thing I did differently is that I grated the apples and I left out the cloves.  Before I added the apples I tested the batter and found that it needed more cinnamon, so I stirred an additional TSP. into the grated apples then folded them into batter.  The batter is very thick and heavy,almost like a cookie dough! But once it baked up it's nice, light and moist.  Thx.

I made this last week for the first time.  I followed the recipe using 2 Granny Smith apples, and added 3/4 cup of raisins.  I was a bit worried upon putting the bread into the pan, as it seemed rather thick and I was worried the raisins I added might further dry out the bread.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  The bread was moist and delicious and the entire family enjoy it!  I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This is a pretty good apple quick bread.  After going through the reviews, I did half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I used three chopped apples instead of two.  I did use the amount of cloves called for. Unfortunately, this bread did come out a little dry.  Next time, I will add a little oil to the batter and I will substitute nutmeg for the cloves. Otherwise this is a nice apple bread served warm.

This was a very good recipe. I was a little nervous at first becuase before I put the apples in (which I shredded) my batter was like paste. I could hardly get a wooden spoon through it. I grated my apples directly over the bowl and let the juice run in and it made it the perfect consistancy. The bread came out moist and delicious. I will porbably add some nuts and use brown sugar next time, but I will make it again for sure!

I LOVE this recipe! My toddlers and husband love this bread for snacking, so I make sure to always have some on hand. Freezes well! I use brown sugar instead of white, and it turns out mouth-watering every time! Thanks!

So I always read reviews before I make any dish. Going off what others said I made a few alterations to the recipe. I used all brown sugar. Instead of cloves I used nutmeg. I grated 3 apples right into the batter and also added 1/4 cup of oil. Wow! It turned out amazing! Its moist and delicious. Definitely keeping this recipe. My 1 yr old son loves it and using wheat flour makes it much more nutritious for him. Thank you Jennifer for a great recipe!

Fantastic! Used the shredded apple and 1/2 cup of raisins. My son is allergic to eggs, so for no eggs, use 1/2 mashed banana, 1/4 cup milk and 1 powdered egg replacement (or more baking soda). Baked for 1hr, 10mins. Awesome! A little sweet - will cut sugar to 3/4 cup next time (also used half white half brown)and a little less cloves.

This bread is amazing.  I did like some other reviews mentioned and did 1/2c white sugar and 1/2c brown sugar.  I also substituted nutmeg for the cloves because I didn't have any on hand.  My 21 month old son has eaten over half of it, asks for it at breakfast, and my husband wanted to take it his ship and share with his shipmates. Very moist, very delicious.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for.  It was very dry.  I'm talking the kind of dry that you can't eat it without something to wash it down.  The flavor was fairly good, but not great.  I barely taste the apples, but maybe I didn't use enough.  "Two apples" is so vague.  It would help if the quantity was a little more definite, such as one cup of chopped apples or two 3-inch apples or something like that.  The apples I had on hand were Golden Delicious, and they were tiny apples, so I used three of them.  An hour in my oven was a little too long--it was slightly overdone. .........................................UPDATE:  I made a second loaf with the following changes:  Added 2 tbls. of oil, 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 c. raisins, 1/2 c. chopped walnuts.  Oh, and just so I would have a point of reference, I added 1 cup of chopped apples (which happened to be almost exactly the 3 very small apples I used the first time).  This time it came out moist and good.  Sadly, this time I UNDERcooked it because my husband was in a hurry for us to leave so I took it out at 45 min.  Obviously ideal time in my oven is between 45-60 min.  Still couldn't really taste the apples..maybe the cloves overpowered it.  With these alterations I would rate this recipe a 4 star.

Really good! My boyfriend described it as "banana bread with apples" which is a pretty accurate picture. I made a couple changes based on suggestions: half white sugar, half brown, and I replaced the 1/2 cup butter with 1/4 cup butter and 1/8 cup oil. I also probably increased the apples; I used 4 smallish, chopped fine. All together, very good! I might try adding some sort of crumb topping next time.. because I can't leave recipes well enough alone!

I've made this a few times now. As it's written, this is an excellent recipe. I've since adapted it a bit. I don't see the need to peel the apples - it takes time and once they're in the bread, the skins aren't really noticeable. Since this uses such a thick batter, a wire whisk is a BAD choice to use for mixing. A wooded spoon is OK; but a silicon spatula is by-far the best thing to use to mix and transfer this into the pan.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I did take some advice from another member who posted a rating: the 1 cup sugar-I changed to 1/2 cup white 1/2 cup brown.  Added 2 tsp. of vegetable oil and I grated the apples.  Baked at 325 for exactly one hour.  FANTASTIC!!!  Oh, there's a recipe called Apple cake and butter sauce, I made the butter sauce from that recipe to go with this, YUM NUMMY  :)  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

My husband and son loved this bread so much that they've begged me to make it again. The only changes I made were to leave the apples unpeeled and use a 9 x 5 loaf pan (reducing the cook time to 50-55 minutes). Super simple and tasty and a great substitute for bagels or muffins in the morning.

This was very good. I made it while on vacation and didn't have any cooking oil on hand, which i usually use when making quick bread. I did have butter, sugar, flour and apples from Wisconsin though. And this bread was the perfect treat! I made it exactly as directed, except omitting the cloves because I didn't have any. I didn't find it dry at all. It was nice and moist. I used Cortland apples and cut them chunky. I also cut the recipe in half to make two small mini loaves. Would definitely make again.

I liked this recipe as a base, but I deviated from it a bit. Used applesauce and some extra spices, and I used wayyy more apples than it called for; I like chunky breads.

Excellent recipe!  I shredded the apples before adding, used brown sugar instead of white and omitted the cloves since I didn't have any.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Very good.  I substituted 1/2 cup crisco + 3 tbsp water instead of butter. 3/4 cup sugar I used 1 cup ap flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour I used 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie seasoning I shredded apples with the peels.  Moist, tasty, absolutely sweet enough - baked it for 55 min and it could have used the extra 5 min - it was a LITTLE too soft in the very middle. SO GOOD though. I will make it again.

A moist and very delicious sweet bread. The only changes I made was using 1 1/2 tsps pumpkin pie spice, as recommended in some of the postings, in place of the cinnamon and cloves. I don't care for cloves, it's too over powering and that's all I end up tasting in any recipe that calls for it...the pumpkin pie spice flavored it just right for me. I also added more apples, one large and three small chopped into very small pieces. The "crust" on the bread had a marvelous flavor! I will definitely be making this one again! Thanks!

The texture & crust of this bread is similar to that of apple cake, and it is very good bread. The only changes I made were to use only 3/4 cup sugar (1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar),to sub WW for 1/2 cup of the flour, added 1 tablespoon of vanilla and used cardamom instead of cloves. Delicious!

Followed the recipe as written and found the bread tasty but very dry.  I used Granny Smith apples and I don't think my 2 were big enough because the apple flavor is just barely detectable through the cinnamon.    I do plan on making this again in the future with larger/more apples and maybe shortening instead of butter or some applesauce added to make the bread more moist.

(Original Review - 2011) This was excellent!  I used half brown, half white sugar, and I added two tbsp canola oil.  Mine was done in about 50 minutes.  Next time I will double the cinnamon, and maybe add some vanilla extract, as this is a very mild flavored bread.  Great for breakfast or with a cup of tea.

(Updated Review - 2015)  Made this twice in the past month, (thank you apple-picking season!), and followed recipe exactly this time around except adding an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  Outstanding bread!  One recipe made three mini-loaves, baking time was about 40 minutes.  This tastes even better (although I didn't think that was possible) the next day.

Delicious!  I made two batches: the first had half brown sugar and half white sugar, with about half a pound of apples worth of apples.  The second had full white sugar and had almost a pound of apples worth.  I liked the one that did not have brown sugar, but both were equally good.  This one's a keeper!

I love this recipe!!  I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and used half brown sugar but kept the apples diced.  So moist and tasty!  I think I'll have to make this often.  It's also a good thing I read that the mix would be very thick and hard to stir.  I would have given up!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I used whole wheat white flour, cut the sugar back by half and I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of homemade apple pie spice instead of the spices. After chopping my apples, I didn't feel that I had enough so I added one more chopped apple. Very nice! Next time I make this, I might make a crumb topping for the top. I did sprinkle just a touch of brown sugar over the top just to pretty it up. We all thought this was bland. Next time, I'd play around with the spices or add applesauce or something in with it. NOTE: I did toss my apples in a tsp. or so of lemon juice to keep them from browning while I was throwing together this bread. If you use whole wheat white flour, you might need to add a half a cup or so of extra liquid as the whole wheat tends to be a liquid sucker upper.

Yum.  I have made this several times, but this was the first time I was out of cloves.  I decided to subsitute pumpkin pie spice which contains cloves, nutmeg, ginger, and cinnamon, and I think this is my best loaf ever.  I still used the full amount of cinnamon called for in the recipe.  I made it to take to school for second grade Apple Fest.

Great bread!  I made this per recipe with the following changes:  omitted the cloves, doubled the cinnamon, did not bother peeling the apple (used 1 large Granny Smith Apple), and added half a cup of unsweetened applesauce to the wet ingredients.

Easy to make. I subed 1/2 cup brown sugar for 1/2 of the white suger per someones suggestion.  My oven temp has to be upped 10 degrees to bake per recipe directions.  Even doing this I had to bake an hour and ten minutes.  The bread came out nice looking.  It tasted good, but is way to sweet for my liking.  About half a slice is all I could eat.  Probably wouldn't make again, but this is just because of my taste preferences.

I absolutely loved this recipe. Will make again and again. I substituted nutmeg for the ground cloves, added a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil, used half white and half brown sugar and my apple of choice was golden delicious which I shredded. I would also suggest monitoring the baking time, as others mentioned it was ready in less than an hour. Check after 45 minutes.

I made 60 servings of a variation of this bread for my church today and they loved it. I modified the recipe as follows. I blended Wheat flour and unbleached AP flour (50/50), skipped the salt and cloves, spread the dough thin onto quarter sheet pans, and cooked at 375. The higher temp gave a slightly crisp top while the inside was moist. I even had a professional baker ask for the recipe. (:

Good, just needs to be baking at a lower temperature for longer.  Split half white half brown sugar, but the baking time is still about an hour.

A very lovely bread!  I did the suggestions and did 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar.  I also did half whole wheat and white flour.  usually the whole wheat flour will over power the flavour but not this time.  I used a little over a 1/4cup of butter and probably about 1/2 cup of apple sauce only because whole wheat flour can be drying.  I also added extra spice,using nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves and a tinge of ginger.  I added it in the flour as well as the wet mixture.  with the apples I peeled and cored them cut them small and yet left it a bit chunkier.  I did make a crumble topping with a bit of butter, oats, cinnamon and brown sugar.  I had a smaller pan, but it still turned out good.  I baked it for an our and ten minutes and left it in the oven for a bit when I turned it off.  I would LOVE to dress this bread up with a cream cheese frosting drizzled on the top like a cinnamon bun for a treat on a saturday morning.  Thanks for sharing!

I was looking for a quick recipe for breakfast, and found this one.... thank Goodness!  It is delicious!  I used 3/4 brown sugar (no white), and next time I think I will add another apple (I shredded them right in to the batter, so the apples and juice were added).  Also, I checked the batter at 45 min, and the middle was a little soggy, but it only needed another 5 min to complete.  Thank you for the recipe!

I was very pleased with this recipe. I expected more of the apple to "pop out" but I used two golden delicious so it made for just a very nice dence sweet bread. Next time I will use a granny smith in the mix. I didn't like the idea of apple chunks so I did grate the apple and let the juices fall into the batter. OMGosh the batter... I ate most of it before I could even put it in the pan! Next time I will make them into muffins. Very good as is!

I made this recipe following the recommendations for adding 2 Tbs oil and substituting half the butter for applesauce.  It turned out moist and delicious.  I shredded two Bramley apples over the bowl and the juice probably added a bit of moisture, too.  I left out the cloves and doubled the cinnamon.  I baked mine as muffins and it yielded 14 good sized muffins.  Baked up perfectly in about 23 minutes.  I will definitely make it again.

I've never had Apple Breakfast Bread before but think this one tastes pretty good!  Used 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar - added 2 tablespoons of oil - doubled the cinammon and left out the cloves (because I didn't have any).  The batter was super thick and I thought for sure I didn't do something right but it seemed to bake okay.  350 for an hour on the nose.  Seems a bit dry to me so I might be inclined to add 1/4 oil, 1/4 butter next time.  Will make again.

This was very good! I made it as written except I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. I baked this in a 7"x11" pan for 50 minutes.

This bread got rave reviews from all my kids!  It's been hard to get them to eat their breakfast and now that school's in session we've got a morning time crunch so I wanted to find something they would be happy to eat - this recipe fills the bill!  Like other reviewers I grated rather than chopped my apples and used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, then I upped the spices, adding nutmeg and ginger to the mix as well.  I also used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and may use a full cup next time.  This is definitely a keeper!

This bread was okay.  I followed past suggestions and used 1/2c sugar and 1/2c brown sugar.  I thought it needed something, not sure what.  I will make this again, but I'll play around with the ingredients.  Maybe raisins and nuts?

i used 3/4c brown sugar instead of 1c granutaled.  I added raisins and walnuts and added a streussel toping and a bit of caramel sauce after baking.  the flavor was good but it was D-R-Y.  similar recipes searched call for 3/4 to 1 c oil rather than 1/2c butter. maybe that would help.

This was wonderful!  I added 1 t. cinnamon & 1/2 t. cloves for extra flavor & it was well worth it!  Thanks goes to previous reviewers for this advice, as well as shredding some apple & dicing the rest.  Yummy & will definately make again & again!

The batter was extremely thick and I was afraid of moistness, but, I was pleasantly surprised when I cut my first piece!  I have to say, this recipe was very easy!  I think I will add some pecans and raisins the next time to give it a little more texture than it already has.  A keeper!

This recipe was great.  It was a little dry, so next time I might add 1/4 cup applesauce or vegetable oil.  I didn't chop my apples finely, but I liked the chunkiness.  I might try grating them for a different texture.

This recipe won rave reviews when I made it for a carry-in at work!  It was very quick and easy to make.  I also substituted brown sugar for regular sugar.  I think the next time I make it, I will add 1/2 to 1 more apple, and just a dash less of cinnamon....but overall, a good thumbs up!

Wow!  This was great. I added just a little extra canola oil and kept the apples a little chunky. It was so tasty and moist. I am going to make a loaf to take to the office.

This bread was good but not outstanding.  I did add a little more cinnamon, also 3 tablespoons of oil (and it was still a little on the heady side) plus 1/2 cup of dried cherries.  I think it was just too dense, I did think the oil would help, if I was to use this recipe again I would try it with half oil and half butter

I just made the apple breakfast bread and it is delicious. I used all the ingredients it called for and it seriously was the best apple bread I have yet to try. So easy. I noticed some say they left out the cloves, but I thought the cloves added so much flavor and went well with the cinnamon. I plan on making this recipe for gifts during the Holidays.

Wonderful! I took the advice of many and used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white. Used three apples (grated) and then added 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Perfect and not dry at all. Susie

This was very moist. I doubled the recipe, used a variety of apples, pureed the apples in the blender (skin, seeds and all), used half butter/half coconut oil, and half sugar/half honey powder. The family LOVED it!

Smelled great while cooking.  Dry and no recognizable apple taste.  I will try to make it once more with more apples and some oil to improve the apple taste and moistness.  I would not make it again as the recipe is written.

As usual most recipes have too long baking time, this does not take a hour to bake it would be a dry rock in a hour. Check bread at 35 minutes

I used some of the previous suggestions, like adding brown sugar, shredding some apples and decreasing the baking time, but in my opinion this bread is nothing special.  I baked it only until it tested done, and it was still dry.  It needed more apples and more spices.  Overall I found it bland and I won't be making it again.  My pumpkin and banana bread recipes are too good and this one just doesn't measure up.  Definitely disappointing.

I made this when some family came to visit and we snacked on it all day. Very yummy! I think if I make it again I will try everybody else's idea of half brown and half white sugar. And maybe more cinnamon. Some walnuts too :)

I'd definitely make this bread again.  As suggested, I used half brown sugar, half white sugar.  I also doubled the cinnamon and added a half teaspoon of nutmeg.  I put the batter into six mini loaves and six muffins.  I added raisins to three of the muffins and they were good with raisins too.  I might also consider adding a glaze or frosting to make the bread into more of a dessert.

I subbed applesauce for the butter and used half whole wheat flour, then added an extra apple and this bread was fabulous.  What a real treat for a Weight Watcher!

This is the first time I have ever reviewed a recipe. I absolutely loved this dish, especially because it is so easy to tweak, which I did: I love bread with spice (especially holiday-season spices!) and so I added 1/4 to 1/2 tsp nutmeg, ginger, and allspice (each) and I added an extra tsp of cinnamon. As per a suggestion before, I checked the bread at 45 minutes and found it needed a little more time in the oven. In total, I cooked the bread for 50 minutes. I also shredded the apples, which when added to the batter, made the whole thing a little easier to work with. This time around, I am adding an extra apple, which I chopped.

I made this one for my husband and he loved it.  We were going to share the next loaf, but then decided to keep it for ourselves.  Delicious.

I made this bread for a friend at her house.  I trippled the recipe, but only used 1/2 C butter and added 1C of olive oil instead.  I also used 4 C whole wheat flour, 1 C all purpose, and 1 C quick oats.  She only had 2 apples so I added about 1 C shredded carrot, 1/2 C blueberries, and 1/2 C mashed banana.  I used 1/2 of the recommended sugar and added 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp ginger, and a 1 tsp vanilla.  It came out great and the changes made the bread healthier too!  My only regret is not having any pecans or walnuts, because this would have brought it up one more notch.   Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly as I always do the 1st time so I can give it an accurate rating. It turned out really dry. Can barely stand eating a bite with out taking a sip of milk. Some previous reviewers suggested grating the apples instead of simply dicing them. This may help but I'm sceptical that that would make the big difference that was needed. I may try the recipe one more time and try adding some buttermilk.

I thought this was great, just made a few changes! For those that want to make a healthy version:   I made this bread with 1/4 cup canola oil, with just over 1/4 cup applesauce to make up the rest of the fat.  I used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of rolled oats.  I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups with a ratio of 2:1 brown sugar to white sugar.  At the end I thought it was too sweet as the applesauce and the apples I used lended quite a bit of sugar. Next time I will reduce to only  half a cup of brown sugar.  I also grated the apples instead of chopped and added 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts at the end.   I will DEFINITELY make this again. It was moist, chunky, delicious!! You can't tell there's less fat and the whole wheat flour and oats were perfect. yum.

I love this bread. Love this recipe. I made it last night and it was better this morning. Like other reviewers, I too was worried about the mixture being heavy but it really lightened up when it baked. I added about 1/2 cup of dates and I grated my apples with the skin. YUMMMY!!!    I also used egg replacer to equate the eggs. I used 1 cup brown sugar. I thought it a bit too sweet for me so next time I will use 3/4 cup sugar. I will also reduce the baking time to 45 mins. I baked it for the full hour and it was a little burnt but still YUMMY!!!    Enjoy. Thanks for the recipe

Absolutely delicious.  I agree with naples34102, its good with the butter, but be prepared for a drier bread.  I added a few T veg oil to the batter and it was perfect.  I didn't find any need to substitute brown sugar for the white, it turned out great. I buttered the glass pan and even dusted it with a little sugar too.  I used two large granny smith apples and grated them directly into the batter. My kids, friends, husband and myself have devoured this easy, tasty, moist bread time after time, and it makes the house smell absolutely fantastic. Awesome recipe, thanks Jennifer!

I made this twice. The first time I used 1/2 Cup of Sugar, and 1/2 Cup of brown sugar, and graded the Apples. The second time I left out the Cloves, and liked it much better. I will definitely make this again.

With the suggested adjustments, this was awesome.  1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white (or splenda blend), use allspice instead of clove, grate the apples, add 2 tsp oil. Cut back on flour-- 1/2 cup wheat, 1 cup white. Moist and delicious.

Like Brandy, I changed the spices (with similar results) I used 1tsp. cinnnamon + 1 tsp. allspice. I added 1/4 cup + 1 "splash" of buttermilk. The batter was too dry (5 other reviewers agreed).  This was so delicious.  Moist and dense. I used small chunks of apples (I tried my table top apple corer/peeler).  I will make this over and over. I enjoyed seeing my daughter and husband "quibble" over them.

This is my new favorite apple bread.  I used olive oil instead of butter and half brown sugar as suggested by other reviewers suggested.  This is very delicious and moist.

Being relatively new to baking of any sort, especially bread baking, I was surprised at how well this turned out. It was a very dense bread, which some may not like, but we loved! We sliced it up and put just a little spread of butter on it...it was heaven in a bite. My kids want to make this again this weekend. Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved this bread and so did everyone in my family!  I did think the batter was very thick so I added 1/2 c. of applesauce and I'm really glad I did. The flavor came out even more!  Also, in addition to the cinammon, I added 1/4 tsp. ginger, ground cloves,nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  I'm going to use the recipe again for muffins next time.  Thanks for a great bread that will be on our family breakfast table for years to come!

This is one of my favorite recipes!  We usually can't wait the hour, so I make them as muffins.  Adjust the time to just 16 minutes in the oven.

It was good, but not great. The texture was a little sandy, but overall a good flavor. It definately was more "muffin-y" than "bread-y". If I make again I will do as others and use half brown sugar, and half white. I would also add a little oil too, that might help the sandy texture and make it a little more moist, like a banana bread.

I found this recipe while doing a search for a quick breakfast with ingredients I had on hand. I was very surprised at how wonderful it was. Preparation was very quick and easy. I was a little nervous right before putting the apple in because the dough was seemed too dry. Once I added the apples, I didn't think they had mixed very well because of the dryness of the dough, but everything worked perfect. The addition of the apples made the bread very moist and tasty. I did double the amount of cinnamon and cloves so it was very flavorful, but using the amount stated in the original recipe would probably be fine as well. I also had to bake it for an additional 20 minutes, but that could be a result of the oven I was using. Thanks for the great keeper recipe!

Great quick recipe. I used whole wheat, omitted cloves, and added an extra apple. At first the batter seemed a little dry but the end result was great. Nice crisp outside and very moist inside.

This was very easy to make, but the taste didn't "wow" me as I thought it might.  The only change I made was to grate most of the apples instead of chopping (great idea I got from others.)  Maybe some icing on it would have made it better for me? Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe.  I used raw honey instead of sugar & threw in a hand full of raisins together with the apples.  Whipped it up 1/2 prior to anyone getting out of bed. The aroma in the house was great and the bread even better. A must to try for anyone.

My family loved it!  I did use alternatives though. I used smart balance margarine because it's a healthier fat.  I also used 1 cup of agave syrup instead of the white/brown sugar because of it's low glycemic quality.  It is still high in calories, but it's all natural, no chemicals like artificial sugars have. Finally, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup non bleached white flour. I am planning on playing with the recipe a little bit more, but in general - it's a really good recipe. I would like to make my own oatmeal flour and use that in replacement of the white flour, and also crush up a half cup of roasted saltless almonds (although my family is not big on nuts in the bread/cake). This would be a great starter recipe to use if you are trying to teach a child how to cook because it's truly so easy, and hard to mess up. Bon appetito'!

YUM! I made this a few days ago and hubby, our 18 month old and I LOVE it! I tried to call our neighbor to give her half the loaf but she wasn't home. Now I'm glad we kept the whole thing for ourselves! Mine turned out slightly dry but still very tasty. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup organic sugar. I also used natural unbleached flour. I added a bit of ground cardamom and some extra cinnamon. Mmmmmmmm!

This is bread very addictive.  It turned out very dark, probably because I used brown sugar instead of white.  Next time I think I will use half white and half brown.  Also, the kind of apple I used did not break down during cooking, so I was left with some large chunks of apple in the bread.  They're not bad, but next time I think I'll either use a softer kind of apple or cut the pieces a little smaller.

I thought this was a pretty good recipe
 I did read the other reviews and make some changes. I used half white and half brown sugar and did add about a 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.. the only thing I didnt like was the cloves I dont think I will add that much next time.. otherwise a good recipe

This bread is wonderful!! A great alternative to banana bread.  I used 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. brown sugar, I plan on making this again to experiment with the sugar, trying other suggestions from other reviewers.

This was so easy and so tasty.  I did have to bake it quite a bit longer, but it might have been because I used a clay pot type loaf pan.  I will be baking it again, for sure.

This is a very good quick recipe! I am by no means a good cook, but this bread was very easy to make and I had all the ingredients already in the cupboard. My whole family LOVED it! The only thing i would change is, if you only use 1 apple- there is plenty and no need for a 2nd one. Try it! its great

"like bananna bread, but with apples" was the response I got from my very happy husband.  He loved the cloves in the bread.  I didn't use 2 apples, but maybe mine were bigger than others.  I used Crispin apples.  I used between 1
and 1 1/2 apples. Not to sure, because I peeled, cored, adn started chopping, and as I started tossing them into the batter and suddenly realized that there were going to be too many. Delicious all the same!!

I don't think I would ever make this again. Nobody in my family enjoyed it and I think it was because there was less bread and more Apple. It was very lumpy and didn't even look like bread. I guess it had good flavor but I didn't really enjoy the texture.

I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out terrific. It's a dense bread, but not dry in the least. I used 2.5 medium rosa apples since the recipe doesn't specify. I chopped them a bit large and they did fine, but I think next time I will dice them. The batter is very thick, so use a hard wooden or metal spoon to fold in the apples. I also made a caramel drizzle for it, which made it almost a dessert. Next time I make it I will try some of the mods mentioned by other reviewers, in particular the 1/2 brown sugar and adding ginger and/or nutmeg. Plus at least a half teaspoon more cinnamon.

I veganized this recipe replacing the butter with coconut oil, and the eggs with flax eggs.  I reduced the cooking time to 50 minutes and it was delicious!

I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup oil. Half brown half white and shredded four apples over the bowl, 2 ts of cinnamon. Bread was moist but... it doesn't taste apples at all.

I have no idea what went wrong with this recipe.  This was a very dry bread and did not have much taste.  I will admit that I made two changes- I swapped a little brown sugar and shredded the apples but these changes should not have made too much of an impact.  I bake a ton and I have no idea what went wrong.  The batter was SO stiff (like cookie dough) that I had to add some buttermilk to loosen it up; which should have helped with the moistness.  I'm hoping that toasting and liberal amounts of Irish butter will help make it palatable!!

Based on other reviews, I made a few modifications...used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar; rather than 1/2 cup of butter, I used 1/4 cup + 1/2 cup of plain greek yogurt; I used 1 cup all-purpose and 1 cup bread flour; I had 3 small apples, so I grated 2 and chopped 1.  I also added about 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts.  Mine baked for 53 minutes in a 9 x 5 pan.  Delicious! I'll be baking this version from now on!

I made this twice... First followed the recipe as it is and found that it has a slight aftertaste and dry. 2nd time, I omitted the cloves and add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil to the egg batter and a touch of vanilla. I loved this one better. Definitely gonna do this bread again. Ty for sharing :D

This is a great versatile recipe.  I've substituted 2 large bananas for the apples and added 3 1/2 Tbps of sour cream.  Sour cream makes it super moist.  Next I'm going to try substituting grated Fuyu persimmons.

I have made this in disposable mini tins for bake sales and as part of my annual holiday treat boxes.  It is a wonderful bread.  My only substitutions are that I use brown sugar in place of the white and shred my apples instead of chopping them.  My toddlers ask me for the "apple bread" over the chocolate chip banana bread.  Now THAT is high praise!

I will DEFINITELY make this again! First time to make it modifications: added 2 tbsp oil, 1/2 c. crushed walnuts, 1/2 c. crushed pecans, nutmeg instead of cloves, half brown/half white sugar, grated apples, topped with whole walnuts and pecans to make it pretty. Next time, I'll do the same thing, but add 1-2 more grated apples.

I've made this recipe 3x in the last 2 weeks!  My husband and toddler are both big fans. I reduced the amount of cloves used to 1/4 tsp (personal preference) and used half light brown sugar, half white sugar. I shredded the apples and was very pleased with the amount of juice rendered; it helped the stir-ability of the batter considerably!!

I used half white sugar and half brown sugar as suggested by some reviewers.  Shredded the apples instead of chopped.  This smelled so wonderful while baking!  Served warm with Cinnabutter from this site;  I could eat the whole thing myself!!  I may try to use this to make muffins next time.  Thank you Jennifer for sharing!

Excellent sweet bread.  I had 2 apples sitting here looking at me and found this recipe with such simple ingredients but, ohhh, so tasty!  I did use slightly less cloves but otherwise followed the recipe.  I'll surely be making this again.  Thank you Jennifer for such a great little treat.

This is a great recipe, especially when you're looking to use up all of the apples you pick during the fall.  I followed it exactly, perhaps adding a bit more cinnamon, and it was really delicious and moist.  A definite keeper!  Thanks!

I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp of ginger, no cloves, and used just 3/4 cup of brown sugar, a sprinkle of stevia and 2 Tbsp of agave.  Substituted 1/2 cup of wheat flour, added 2 Tbsp of oil and made them into 18 muffins.  Baked for 17 minutes and WOW!  What a delight!  My kids all said I should have made more!

This bread is pretty tasty and perfect for an autumn breakfast. Like the other reviewers I, too, made a couple slight changes. I shredded the apples, left out the cloves, doubled the cinnamon, AND I added a tsp of ground Tahitian vanilla bean (from Williams Sonoma), which really made the bread wonderful. Regular vanilla bean or even some extract would probably work too.

This was great.  Be sure to cut your apples finely for nice even distribution and moisture.  (I even goofed and used b-powder...still great!)

This is a very good recipe. I used a cup of applesauce instead of the oil. My bread came out too dry. So I guess that some oil is needed. I'll use some oil plus apple sauce next time. I also used only half a cup of brown sugar and it was not a good idea. It lacks sweetness now. So use the recipe's amount. I will make this again with more sugar and some oil or butter. Thanks a lot for posting.

This bread is excellent, moist and full of flavour.  I used mixed spice rather than cloves and the smell while baking was lovely! I followed other users by going for a 45 mins bake time but in the end it needed almost the hour anyway.  It is a little hard on the outside but inside very moist. I will be making this again!

Soooo yummy! i really liked this bread it was nice and moist and crumbly with a chewy/crunchy crust! made the house smell wonderful too. I added about 2 tblsp of oil and did 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white and i also grated the granny smith apples to get a more overall apple taste rather than just chunks. I also removed the bread immediately from the pan. if i had left it in it would've burned. would definitely make again and would recommend!

The inside of mine didn't cook (though I think that's just my wacky oven), but what did cook was delicious, and that's coming from someone who doesn't even like her grandmother's apple bread (sorry Grandma!).

This was really a really delicious bread.  I added 2 T. applesauce to the recipe for extra moistness.  I left out the cloves due to personal taste but used a heaping tspful of cinnamon.  Even with the extra liquid, the dough was still a paste, I was really scared to bake it but it came out moist and delicious.  Next time I make this I will also shred the apples instead of chopping them because they do make up 3/4 of the bread.  All in all, a good recipe I will use many times over but with some changes.

I appear to be one of the few reviewers (178, so far) that actually followed the recipe.  Now many of the variations sound wonderful (particularly using brown i/o white sugar) but that's not the recipe.  This makes a very flavorful, moist bread.  Would be five stars with chopped nuts and more cinnamon.

Loved this.  I usually use 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and 1 tsp apple pie spice.  I think it works best to grate the apple into the batter - it released some of the apple's juice, adding just the right amount of liquid to be able to easily stir in the apple.  When I just chopped the apple, the bits mostly sunk to the bottom of the bread, and it didn't cook as evenly.

My bread is baking in the oven and the two apples I chopped up are over-taking the batter to the point that they aren't even covered.  Note to users, any two apples don't work.  Mine are med. sized and it's way too much.  Haven't tasted it yet but it smells amazing!  I topped with a crumble - 2 T brown sugar, 2 T reg sugar, 1/3 cup flour and 2 T butter.  Mix the dry first then smash butter in with your fingers.  Makes a nice Dutch topping!

MM.. tasty, but needs work.  A bit dense for my personal taste.  I will take the suggestions of shredding or pureeing the apples.  I will also add the 2 tsp oil.  Otherwise, good flavor, great baked color and smell.

This tastes fantastic and is easy to make.  I do make 2 changes, though.  1.  I microwave the butter and apples and then run them through the blender.  Then I mix in the sugar and eggs.  2.  I add a lot more cinnamon...but I don't measure it, so I'm not sure how much.    It's a great recipe.

This was an easy recipe. Like others, I substituted 1/2 the white sugar for brown, left out cloves, used allspice and added vanilla.  Very good, if you like apple bread; my kids decided they like banana bread better! Think next time I will make muffins and add a streusel topping.

I followed some suggestions and used oil instead of butter, 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and shredded the apples.  It is very thick like cookie dough, but the shredded apples added a lot of moisture.  The bread is a little dry, but tasty.  I actually like the drier texture!

Very good!  I did use half brown sugar, and 1/3 oil to 2/3 butter to make it more moist.  I think next time I'll use half butter and half oil. Next time I will use Granny Smith apples instead of Braeburns, which is what was on hand - not juicy enough.  Doubled the recipe to fit perfectly into one 9 x 5 loaf pan and one 8 x 4 loaf pan. Baked smaller loaf about 40 min. and larger loaf about 47 min.(in my unpredictable 50+ year old oven). I look forward to adding this recipe to my holiday baking this year!!

This was great! I used half whole wheat flour and half white and substituted  1-1/2 tsp. apple pie spice for cinnamon and cloves.  I think next time I'll shred the apples.

I just had a piece of this bread and it is really good.  After reading the reviews I added 2 tablespoons of olive oil and one teaspoon of allspice in lieu of the clove.   I also used one cup of whole wheat flour mixed with one cup white flour.  This bread is very moist and very tasty, not to mention the wonderful aroma it left in my home.  I will definitly prepare it again.

This was a great recipe. It was easy to make -- I had all the ingredients in my house already (except the apples). Tastes great. I bet you could probably put in other fruit if you don't have apples and it would still taste good. I'm definitely going to keep this recipe around, it seems like a good thing to make if I want to make something good and not need to run out to the store for ingredients.

This was a great morning snack!  I used whole wheat flour. I think the apples I used were Gala's. If I make this again, I'll use Granny Smith.  I didn't change anything else about the recipe. It was good right out of oven.

Absolutely delicious. Made this as a side to a Sunday brunch. Everyone went back for second (or third) slice.

Definately tasty.  The fam scarfed it down.  I did alter the recipe a bit, however.  I doubled the recipe but four cups of flour is alot to mix in to this recipe, so I added 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of instant oatmeal and it turned out more like a thick cake.  I spread it in a 9x13 pan and topped it with a Dutch crumb topping before baking and a swirl of powdered sugar glaze after it was cooled.  I only had "French Vanilla Blend" extract and it gave the cake a very rich flavor.  Also, it definately needs more Cinnamon than called for.

This is a wonderful recipe! Makes a moist bread that is full of flavor. (Although I did add a little more cinnamon and cloves). Before adding the apples, the batter seems very, very dry - but don't panic like I did. Once you add the apples it really does come out perfectly. This recipe is a keeper!

This is a pretty good apple bread. I followed the suggestions from other reviewers, grated the apples, split the sugars, and also used 1/2 oil, 1/2 butter. If I make it again, I will most likely add just a bit more cinnamon, but otherwise, I'm sure I will make it again with the abundance of apples I have to work with this season. Thanks!

Awesome!  I used 3 apples, since mine were quite small.  Next time, I might try replacing some of the sugar with honey.  Just sinful warm and slathered with butter...

I made this last night sort of as a dessert for my kids. I thought it was very good. I am very health conscious so I made this the "healthy" way. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the butter, used egg substitute, did 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and used whole wheat flour instead of white. I also added about 1/2 c chopped pecans. I wanted to add raisins and dried cranberries as well but my kids didn't want it in there. I will definitely make it again and make more additions to it.

perfect.  texture, taste, presentation = all a delight to the senses.  toward the beginning i was skeptical of the thick dough.  Yet, my husband and i enjoyed this recipe from the moment it began rising until the very end.

This is my favorite Apple Bread recipe for breakfast, side dishes, or even a light dessert. I always exchange the white flour with 100% whole wheat pastry flour for that extra nutrient and health value and it still ends up moist. (No even knows the difference!) I also like to be a little liberal on the spices and even add some "pumpkin spice mix" to make it a more seasonal dish. Serve it with regular or spiced, whipped honey butter to get that extra yum factor.  For dessert, top it with a thick cream cheese frosting.

Very easy to make and tasted wonderful. I did do 1/2c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar and baked it for an extra 10 minutes. Other then that it was great.

VERY thick dough but it works.  I subbed in brown sugar for white, used granny smith apples and doubled it.  My kids loved it and it smelled like heaven when it was baking.  Will use this recipe again!

Tastey~ Tastey~ and I am not one who favors apple recipes.

The family took a vote and thinks it was too cake like for breakfast, but we sure did devour it for afternoon snacks and dessert! I did use 1/2 cup each brown & white sugar.  I think next time I will cut 2 tblsp. of the butter out and use it to make a oatmeal crumble topping for the top~

I used two granny smith apples and made some modifications: cut the sugar to about 3/4c(next time I may cut more), subbed one cup whole wheat pastry flour and then added some ground flax seed and wheat germ and topped with more wheat germ. The dough was VERY thick (not pourable), probably due to the added dry ingredients I used. Also, it turned out a little crumbly so next time I may add more moist to compensate. 
I had fun modifying this one and look forward to playing around with it when I make it again, which I definitely will be using this recipe again.
Thanks for sharing, yum :)

This was very good.  I gave it 4 stars because I modified it a little.  I added 2 tsp. of my homemade cinnamon spice blend, which gave it a bolder flavor.  I think this will taste great with pecans or walnuts in it!

Great recipe.  I only used one apple and it seemed perfect (I think two may have been too much).  My whole family loved this and the loaf was gone in a day - that's ok because it is so easy to make.  Thanks!

Definitely follow what other reviewers are saying and add some moisture and reduce baking time!

I added 1/2 cup of old fashioned oats to give the bread a little more oomph with texture and some more complex carbohydrates. I also added approximately 2 tbsp of coconut oil to help keep the moisture. Also used nutmeg instead of cloves (didn't have any on hand) and it is quite delicious!

The bread baked for about 50 minutes, but I think next time I would do 45 (knife didn't come out clean then, but it sets up in the pan a little). I may also add a little more coconut oil (I am sure canola or other baking oils would be fine, but coconut is all I had on hand).

This was very good. The dough was very dry when I mixed it, so much so that I added a splash of milk to allow the apples to blend in well. The end result was a bit dry, but it nonetheless was very tasty.

This recipe was good! However I did make a few changes. I used half dark brown sugar and mixed the apples in it and let them sit.  I added a 1/4 cup of sour cream and about 2 tablespoon of extra flour. I also did not use clove, but a whole tablespoon of cinnimon and a little nutmeg. And baked it for 45 minutes. It was awesome and moist!!

This was amazing recipe.   I was actually able to make it with almond and coconut flour and monk fruit to cut the carbs.  I also only used 1 apple. Otherwise I followed the recipe and everyone loved it and had no idea it was low carb.   I have actually made it 3 times so far and am going to make it again today.  I know people say that I didn't actually make this bread then.  I did, just used different flour and sugar choice.   Thank you for recipe idea.

I made this today. I followed the directions as written. I used 1 extra large Honeycrisp apple, diced. The batter was very thick. I baked it in a metal loaf pan. It was perfect! I like cloves, but I may try nutmeg next time. My bread was much darker in color than the picture posted, but it's so good. Tasty and moist, not dry at all. Thank you, Jennifer!

It came out well, but didn’t stay moist very long. I might increase the sugar and apples.  Great out of the oven.

This is perfect bread, not sweet but flavored with the taste of autumn.  I’m definitely making this for friends and family once the Apple tree has been picked.  Warm with cream cheese is amazing, truly a life of heaven

I made it with a few alterations along the way to make it work. I ended up adding like 3/4 cup milk to moisten it up bc my mixture was too flaky to even properly mix. Also used less clove bc it's too strong for me. I used one apple (it was a decently big one) instead of two also. Only other adaptinon was the time in the oven. Hour and a half maybe in total. Just took forever for the middle to finally cook. 
I wanted some kind of glaze on top so I warmed up some honey with a bit of lemon juice mixed in and sprinkled brown sugar on top. It was delicious and looked pretty.
Very good base for an apple bread

Followed recipe as this was the first time I made this.  Delicious.  My twist:  I melted a tsp of butter in bottom of pan and lay down one layer of very thin apple slices.  When I turned the bread out the top looked pretty.  Sorry, no photo...family didn’t wait...

I will definitely make this again!  The only thing I did different was grate 1 large apple (in addition to the cubed apples and all ingredients) and add that at the very end of folding in all the wet ingredients. It seemed to make it more moist.  But this is a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing it. :)

This is a nice, moist bread that got great feedback from my family.  I made loaves, muffins and mini muffins with this recipe as is... although I always cheated up on the Cinnamon and used the Pampered Chef Cinnamon Spice blend for a few of the batches. ( I had a lot of apples to use up!).  We liked the course chunks of (3)apples visible in the final product, which I mixed into the batter with the second cup of flour using my hand mixer (Cuisinart, almost wire thin blades).  This seemed to blend in some of the apple juices a bit too.

This is a really simple recipe, it was a bit dry so I added 1/2 cup orange juice. Also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and substituted nutmeg for cloves. Also, sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar before baking. Yum!

I’ve made this several times, and it’s delicious. I’ve added walnuts, dried cranberries, and made it a few times with half whole wheat flour. This is the best go-to recipe when you need something super easy, and want to impress. I even substituted pairs for apples. If you try this, cut the sugar a little bit.

I made the changes suggested by some of the other reviewers. Used half white and half brown sugar ; added 2 tbsp oil along with butter ; grated the apples instead of chopping and added some cranberries. I baked at 325 for 70 minuets and it’s come out moist and yummy.

I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla. I would have loved to add a 1/2 tsp ginger, but I was out. Next time, I’ll add ginger. I used butter, not oil, although to make this vegan, I’ll probably use oil next time and replace the eggs with bananas.

Upgraded to three apples, shredded, love it! 

Will definitely make again! (great for breakfast!)

Batter was very thick when I came to the part of folding the apples in. However, the finished product was amazing  and smelled delicious while it was baking. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Made it to have with our breakfast tomorrow but, we couldn't wait to try it as soon as is was cooled off enough.

Very disappointing. Made no changes to the recipe. The batter came out more like sticky cookie dough with a lot of apples. . It took a full 2 hours to bake all the way through and even then I had to put it in a water bath to cook the bottom completely. When I attempted to turn the bread out of the pan, it broke monstrously. 

If I make this again, I will do a yeast prove and only add one apple. 

I give it two stars because it made my house smell so good as I drank coffee and watched the snow come down.

Made a few changes as advised by some of the reviews. Grated the apple, used brown sugar versus white and baked as muffins in parchment cups. My attempt was successful. They were just about the right amount sweet, not for anyone who is hoping for a sugary bread/muffin.

Super moist and tasty.
I didn't have any ground cloves, so I substituted ground ginger.  Wonderful flavor!  And I think it was better that way!

recipe with a couple of changes no butter sub a 1/2 cup of applesauce, added a 1/2 cup of raisins added 1 & 1/2 teaspoon of molasses....and added 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom
The whole house was filled with a wonderful aroma.... also bake it with a bowl of water so that the crust doesn't dried out....The crust was crunchy the bread is really moist and flavorful....the apples and raisins complement each other and go well with the spices...Thanks and Happy Cooking!

Only made change to flour added half wheat and half all purpose flour.  Also added about one cup walnut.  Otherwise followed other suggestions to ensure bread was moist. Very good flavor and texture.  Will make again!

I made this recipe using 2.5 pink lady apples, grated. I also added a 4 oz. single pack of apple sauce as many people complained these were dry.  Mine were very moist; I credit the addition the of the apple sauce.  I made these as muffins. Since there are only 2 of us, a loaf of bread typically goes bad & I can freeze the extra muffins for another time.  I baked the muffins on 375 degrees for 20 minutes.  I thought the clove was overpowering & you didn't get much Apple flavor. I will try making these again without the clove & use more apples in the hope of boosting the apple flavor.

Made it just as written (allowing for the non-stick pan by reducing the temperature by 25 degrees and the time by 5 min.). It was really delicious. NOTE: Have been reading some other reviews and it is very important that if you are using a glass or non-stick pan you reduce the temperature and shorten the baking time to avoid dryness.

Very dissapointed with this recipe. the bread came out dry and fell apart easily. I followed all directions very closely and still got a mediocre bread. I would suggest adding vanilla and a tad bit of water or milk to moisten this recipe a little more. I did this the second time around and got exellent results.

Great recipe. After reading some the other reviews, I changed things up just a tad. I shredded the apple (Granny Smith), and added one ripe banana. I cut the butter in half and added a couple tablespoons of low fat sour  cream. Since I am not a fan of cloves, I used nutmeg instead. I had to coax my picky eater son into trying it but in the end, he loved it. Will definitely make this again.

Considering I had a loaf tin half the height (8 x 2)  this recipe turned out just fine. It was most and tasty and took so little time. I would add less sugar next time around but have added it to my favorites :-).

This was awesome!  I used half white sugar and half brown, perfect.  I am not a fan of cinnamon and usually cut it but the amount called for was not overpowering.  I cut the cook time down to 50 minutes, I think 1 hour would have been too long. A second loaf is in the oven as I type!

This is terrific - and use allrecipes so I can get input and advice from others. So split the sugar to brown and white. Added four apples - 2 on the bigger side, 1 medium, 1 really small. Added in 1/4 cup of Canola oil. Had to cook for 1 hour 15 minutes which was surprising but outside is darker and inside is moist and delicious.

Like others, I used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I also added 1/2 tsp ground ginger.  I've made it twice and the second time I made it as a bundt.  Either way, only bake it for 45 mins at 350 in convection.  Juicy apples are really a must because that's the only liquid for all that flour.  Delicious recipe, especially for autumn.

This is delicious.  My children said they would have liked more cinnamon in it but I thought it was perfect.  

I did make some changes.  The batter was extremely thick - like a yeast dough thick.  My solution:  I added some milk to it.  Some of the reviewers said it was dry (and they thought it was the butter).  I don't think it was dry because of the butter - I think it just needed more moisture.  I chose milk because it usually makes for a moister bread.

And my second change was purely preference.  I used 1/2 a cup of brown sugar in place of the  sugar.  

It was moist and delicious!  I will definitely make again.

Absolutely must do recipe, I added  an extra apple and made it more flavorful with more apples inside. My 3 kids just couldn't stop eating! Excellent breakfast option. I made in small muffin pans, perfect for a one bite taste!!!

I added 3/4 c of of applesauce since people said that it was a little dry. Used chopped apples, increased the cinnamon and use nutmeg since I did not have any cloves. Also I bake it for 55 minutes. I turned out great  definitely will make again.

I made some substations and additions. I used 3 apples and grated them. I used nutmeg and cinnamon. I used 1/2 cup butter softened and 1/2 cup oil. I used 1 c brown sugar and 1 c granulated sugar. This bread came out very moist and delicious!

I found another apple bread recipe on here and tweaked it, and then when I saw your recipe I realized my "tweaking" made it much closer to this one! I like to use butter in quick breads. But I am going to try it with vegetable oil too, just to see...

Great recipe! I opted to make muffins instead of a loaf, It  made 12 in total and baked in 25 minutes. I may try either sprinkling  cinnamon sugar or a crunch topping made w/ granola or just brn. sugar and butter  for  added texture.

I really liked this apple bread recipe. Super simple to make.  I did a double batch and it made 18 mini loafs in 30mins on 350. I made some changes I did half white sugar  half brown sugar and I did 1/4 cupbutter and a 1/4 cup oil. I also did add more apples to mine almost 2 cups full of shredded apples to each batch and I added a teaspoon more cinnamon..

I have changed and added things to this so much that it's almost a different recipe!  This is my favorite thing to make, so I make it for everybody. It's kind of what I'm known for baking. Thank you so much for this recipe! Here are a few changes I have made to the apple bread that I think make it even better:
-1/4 teaspoon of cloves instead of 1/2 teaspoon.
-Added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.
-To make it more of a dessert, I added between 1/2 cup and 1 cup of chocolate chips.

This was delicious!  Besides the spices, which instead of what was written, I put in 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, generous dash of nutmeg and a pinch of all spice.  With 10 minutes to go, I sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of the loaf.   This was very moist and was gone so fast!  Next time I will try using half oil half butter  but only out of curiosity to see if the recommendations to do so are worth it.

I am in the process of baking this.  The batter was so dry that I could make cookie balls out of it....wish I had read the reviews first.  Anyway, I added apple juice to get a creamy consistency so it could be put into a baking pan.    I did not have ground cloves so substituted anise.  This will be a surprise when it is done, we shall see.  Turned out very moist and tasty.

This is really yummy!  I substituted applesauce for the butter, egg beaters for eggs and nutmeg for the cloves and it tastes fantastic!  I shredded the apples this time but will probably chop them next - I think that texture would be better.  Thanks for the recipe!

I tweaked this recipe slightly by using 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar. Instead of butter I used coconut oil. I also added dried cranberries.  This is a regular go-to bread for our household.

I followed other reviewers advise and thought the dough looked a bit dry as well. I added 1/4 cup of applesauce and that helped out a lot. I also used WW flour. Baked for 45 min and it came out fine.

I followed the suggestions of another reviewer and cut the sugar in half and eliminated the oil; instead I added 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  It was very dense, probably due to these changes.  However, we all liked it and enjoyed it heated up in the toaster.   I diced the apples very small; one of our tasters is not fond of cooked fruit, and she liked this quite a bit.

This reminds me of a raw apple cake my mother made in a half sheet pan.  Although the batter is dry, the apples cooking adds liquid and it turns into a moist bread in the center with a nice texture on top.  It is a sweet bread like cake.  I had hoped for a less sweet bread and may try it again with less sugar.

Added a little water probably a couple of tablespoons and baked in muffin tin for 23 minutes. Suggest leaving out the salt if using salted butter. Very tasty.

The recipe was great. I had never made apple bread before and had apples that were going to go bad, so this was the perfect recipe. I did add golden raisins and mini semi dark chocolate chips, so it is more like a dessert bread. I also added a tablespoon of mild to make sure it was going to turn out really moist. My boyfriend loves it! This is a keeper!

We really enjoyed it! But I think next time I will grate the apple like another review did, the chunks made it fall apart.... It was delish though, I also served brown sugar butter on the side.

Instead of all the butter,  I used 1/2 applesauce,  1/2 butter.  I doubled the recipe and made muffins with the other half.  They turned out great :)

Delicious bread, and easy way to use up apples that are "past their prime" for snacking. I used half white and half brown sugar, and subbed pumpkin pie spice for the cloves. I may add just a little oil next time to make it a tiny bit more moist. My oldest daughter asked me if I "can make this bread every day," so it definitely has the family seal of approval.

I followed the recipe with a few small changes and it was delicious and super moist.  Peeled and chopped, the apples measured 3 cups.  I substituted 1 teaspoon of 5-spice powder for the cloves as did not have ground cloves, used half brown and half white sugar, and used half butter and half butter-flavored crisco.  Baked as directed for exactly 1 hour.  Thanks to those that warned the batter would be stiff, almost like cookie dough.  Excellent results and rave reviews from the ladies at the brunch.  We also liked that you could see lots of apple pieces in the bread. Thanks for the recipe and will be making again soon.

Made a double recipe last night.  I used half white and half brown sugar. Also, diced 6 small apples and one large apple which allowed for a wonderful moist bread.  A great way to use those apples that are shriveling a bit.  This is definitely a keeper.  The double made one large loaf 9x4 and 7.5 x 3.5 small loaf.

I replaced half the sugar with Splenda, switched most of the remaining sugar to brown, and used half margarine and half butter instead of all butter.  I always cut the salt in half and I used extra cinnamon.  Gala apples were used. I used 2 smaller loaf pans instead of 1 full size and baked 40 -45 min.  It came out perfect and very delicious!

Left out the cloves and used turbinado instead of white sugar. Used Golden Delicious & Granny Smith and grated the apples - kids don't like the "chunks."  AMAZING!!

Okay, this was delicious. I followed the recipe as is, but if added dried cranberries and walnuts to the batter. I also lost some of my egg (don't ask) so I added 3 tsps of unsweetened organic applesauce. I was afraid it might be too wet of a batter, but it's lovely once it's baked. It took the full hour. A nice change from banana bread! So yummy!

After reading the reviews I made the bread this afternoon.  I used oil instead of butter, 1/2 white sugar 1/2 brown sugar, added a mashed banana and used pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves.  It turned out very moist and the apples were really nice.  I had to cook my bread for an hour and ten min.

This was great.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY using 1 granny smith & i gala apple.  The bread is a bit hard to slice because it's pretty crumbly.  I think the reviewer who claims it's the butters fault may be on to something.  But my family is enjoying it right now...even my daughter who hates baked goods was overwhelmed by the delicious smell and is devouring it.

I did sub oil in place of butter. I also did half brown/half white sugar.  The batter was really dry- I almost couldn't get all the dry ingredients mixed in and my apples weren't very juicy, so they didn't help. When this first came out of the oven it was REALLY dry- However, after sitting overnight, it was moist and delicious the next morning!  I would make this again for sure, keeping the substitution of oil for the butter but wouldn't change anything else. Overall, the bread was tasty after it sat for a while.

Great base recipe. I used safflower oil instead of butter.I initially panicked as I was mixing in the dry ingredients with the wet because it was not moist enough to incorporate all the flour, so I added in another two tbs of oil and some water, little by little until the consistency was to my liking. Turned out awesome and oh so tasty.

Ok! So I have tried the bread....LOVELY and if I cannot improve the texture be any more moist, I am STILL keeping it and making it a constant in this home. Am going to try to try some of the other reviewers ideas for moistness but this bread in no way is a disappointment. FABULOUS new family fall tradition.

I followed the advice of a few of the other commenters below and subbed brown sugar for half the white sugar. The bread is sweet without being overwhelming, moist and very tasty.

Good recipe.  I did use suggestion from others and used half brown and white sugar, half oil half butter, and nutmeg instead of cloves, although I'm not sure how much effect it has.  Might try just as written next time.  I baked in two smaller loaf pans and reduced the time to 45min.  Also thought a crumb top would be good so I mixed a butter, sugar, flour crumb topping and put it on before baking.  Came out great.  Will make again.

Loved it!  I added an extra apple, used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and substituted nutmeg for cloves.  Very delicious and moist.

Enjoyed this apple bread but agree with previous comments that adding part brown sugar would improve it.  As well, I think it needs some vegetable oil or perhaps sour cream to moisten the bread.  I didn't have cloves so used nutmeg instead.  I wish that I had used more cinnamon as well to increase the flavour.

This was delicious! I followed some of the other reviews as well - used just half a stick of butter and 1/4 cup oil. Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and ginger powder.  I was going to add a third apple, but when I went to mix it in, there was plenty with just 2 apples as stated in the recipe.

This is excellent!  I made it as is (with the exception of grating the apples) and it was wonderful.  I made a few changes the second time (added nutmeg, used half brown and half white sugar) and it was even better.  Either way, it's a keeper!

Good bread and moist. Made the following changes as suggested by other reviewers. Changed out cloves for pumpkin pie spice, added 2 tablespoons olive oil and used my cuisinart to dice up the apples. Was a hit at my gathering and a keeper.

This is delicious!  I used 3 apples because they were small, but looking at the picture I probably used more than "normal".  That being said, I LOVED it with lots of apple pieces!  I didn't have clove so I just left it out and it still tasted amazing.  I will definitely be making this recipe again!

My first time baking apple bread and overall an excellent fall bread recipe, especially if you use fresh apples from your local apple farm! I reduced the butter to 1/4 c and added 3/4 c applesauce, reduced the sugar to 1/3 c, added 2 T of brown sugar, reduced the cloves to 1/4 t, added 1/4 t ground ginger, as well, and  I did not peel my apples, and probably used 3 or 4 apples, plus I added 1/2 c fresh walnuts. I would definitely make this again, and the only thing I would change is to roast my walnuts first, and maybe sprinkle some additional ones on top.  Really good!

I've never had apple bread before. I had a few apples that needed to be used so I searched for an apple recipe that only needed 2-3 apples. I told my sister-in-law about this bread and she said she remembered her grandmother making this when she was little. This is very simple to throw together & I was pleasantly surprised with the result. The only problem is that the outer edges finished cooking before the center had cooked through. By the time the center was cooked through the edges were dry. Nothing a glass of cold milk can't fix :) Thanks for sharing.

This bread is delicious, I used Macintosh apples. The only problem I had is that the center did not cook thoroughly after 57 minutes even though the outside was starting to dry and over-brown. I added 1 Tbs canola oil, 1 Tbs lemon juice, 1 tsp vanilla and I substituted the cloves for nutmeg. The flavor was terrific, I just wish it cooked more consistently.

I just made this for the first time and YUM!  I tripled the recipe and didn't have enough butter.  So I used 1 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil instead.  I shredded 7 Rome apples and used a pinch of pumpkin spice.  I put two loaves in the freezer and just ate a warm piece fresh out of the oven of the third loaf.  YUM!!  This is a keeper!

Great recipe!  I made them as muffins baking them at 375º for 15 minutes, but next time I'll bake them at 350º.  I only made one change because I didn't have ground cloves.  I used 1/2 tsp of ginger and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg (as another reviewer suggested).

Very good, dense bread.  I substituted half white and half brown sugar, and I also substituted nutmeg for the cloves since I don't like cloves.  Great flavor and texture.  I left the apples about 1/2" big so the bread has fabulous chunks of apple through it. I also added a few pecans for added texture.

I didn't have a bread pan so I used a muffin tin. I also left out the cloves, because I didn't have any. I made muffins as is and also made some with walnuts and some with chocolate. They turned out great. Next time if I made the muffins, I would mince the apples instead of chopping them. I  made the muffins the night before and ate them for breakfast the next day and they tasted even better in the morning.

The only change I made was half brown sugar and half regular.  Was wonderful, and will make it over and over again.  Thanks Jennifer!

Great recipe.  Like others said, it looks very thick when pouring into the pan.  But it turns out moist and tasty.  I made a few changes for my own taste: 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup oat bran and 1/2 cup flax seed.  Used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  Added raisons and pecans.  Didn't have cloves so I used allspice with my cinnamon. Tasted wonderful and the kids love it.

I followed the recipe exactly, and made a smaller loaf and a few muffins out of the batter and they turned out great! Although next time I make this I will take other peoples suggestions and use half white/ half brown sugar.

I made this and unfortunately cannot taste due to a stuffy nose... but according to my coworkers it is AWESOME!  I did make a few slight changes: added some nutmeg, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown instead of one cup white.   I will definitely be making this again!

I added some extra oil per another raters suggestion. I used granny smith apples. I needed to bake for 10 more min. than suggested. Very moist and yummy!

I've made this recipe a few times now and it never lasts longer than 24 hrs in my house! It's also a great recipe to play with. It's very easily altered. The baking time for me was exact. Try it you won't regret it!

This recipe is quick, pretty easy and the bread turned out great.  I did use the suggestions of other reviewers.  I used half white and half brown sugar, omitted cloves and only baked for about 50 minutes.  My bread was a little overdone on the bottom so next time I will keep the bake time closer to 40-45 mins.  Overall a great recipe to add to the box!

I thought this bread was absolutely delicious! I made it the first time for my boyfriend and he ate it all up.  I made another loaf for work and everyone loved it as well!  I followed some other suggestions and used brown sugar.  The second time I switched one cup of flour for a cup of bisquick.  I liked that because it made it a little more cake like but I thought it was delicious either way.

I really loved this bread! The first time I made it according to the given recipe, the second time I combined suggestions from other reviewers with my own personal preferences. Here is what I came up with: I used brown sugar instead of white, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, added about 2 tbsp honey and 2 tbsp oil, used one finely chopped Fuji apple (my personal favorite), added about 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Then I baked them in a little mini-loaf pan because I gave them as gifts to my teachers. YUMM! They were a hit...I only actually got to eat one mini loaf because my family ate the rest in two days!

Good, but definitely tastes like healthy bread.  Instead of so mch white sugar I used 1/2 C brown, 1/4C white, and 1/4C honey.  The texture was a bit crumbly, almost scone-like.

I just made this bread and it is so good! I added 1 tbs of oil and used about 1 1/2 c apple sauce instead of chopped apples. The bread is very moist but i did find i had to bake about 70 min. Delicious! I think my bread turned out so moist b/c i used applesauce. But it is great.

mmmmmmmmm, so yummy! To the cinnamon and cloves I also added 1/4 tsp. ginger and allspice. The ginger was so good in this bread. It did turn out a bit on the dry side so I think I'll try adding oil as well.

Very moist!  I like spices, so I also added 1/2 tsp allspice (or you could use nutmeg).  And it seems like a lot of apples (be sure to chop into small pieces) when the dough is first made, but it bakes up nicely.  I also made muffins instead of bread loaf which was a little tricky getting batter into muffin cups since it's quite sticky/lumpy and looks like you don't have enough batter for the apples.  But again, it puffs up and fills out when baked.

Made it as is and my family gobbled it up! It came out a little crumbly and I think it's because my apples were really big - so this time I'll decrease the apples by 1 to see if it makes it less crumbly.

I tried this recipe this weekend with some of the apples I had left from apple picking and it turned out pretty good.  I used half ww flour and half white and used 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead of white (my boyfriend won't eat anything made with white sugar).  I also didn't include the cloves and I must say, the end result was quite good.  It's a tad dry which I think is due to the ww flour, or maybe not, thinking next time I may add some applesauce to see if that helps with the moisture.  Definitely a keeper.

I tried this recipe for the first time.  I followed the recipe to the T except for (taking some reviewers' suggestion) substitude 1/2 cup of butter with 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of oil.  I baked it for an hour.  The bread looked done when I inserted a toothpick, but when I took the bread off the pan, bottom part of the bread was wet (too moist), I don't know if this was because I substitude half of butter with oil.  Maybe next time I will try 1/2 cup of butter and 2 tbsp of oil as some other viewers suggested.

This bread is wonderful.  I also did the half brown half reg. sugar.  Turned out fantastic.  I turned the temp down to 325 degrees and added about 15 minutes to the time.  It really is a perfect recipe!

I took the advice of others and added a few tablespoons of oil along with the butter and I used all brown sugar instead of white.  I also added one teaspoon vanilla and cut down the cloves to 1/4 teaspoon.  I stirred in 1/2 cup raisins and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  Although the bread tasted good, it was very dry.  I did not shred or grate the apples because I was lazy so I added them in chopped.  Perhaps if I shredded them, the bread would be moist.  I don't think that I will try this recipe again.  There are other recipes that taste delicious and are very moist.

This was wonderful!  I made 1 1/2 times the recipe , using half white flour and half whole wheat flour.  Other than that, I stayed true to the recipe.  Made one loaf and about 10 muffins.  Came out very moist and totally yummy.  Will definitely make this again.

This was really good.  I didn't have all-purpose flour, so I had to use self-rising, so I didn't have the correct ingredients, but it still turned out wonderful.  I did substitute the clove for allspice as suggested by others.

We loved this loaf!  I reduced the sugar and used brown instead of white and it was great!  I made two loaves and took one to work.  There were no leftovers.

Yowzer!!!!!!!!  I'm a vegetarian that leans toward veganism and am making this recipe tonight.  I used egg replacer and a non-dairy butter spread (omitting the cloves).  It is baking as I type, but I tasted the batter prior to baking and...IT IS GOOD!

I made this for a breakfast brunch prepared for out-of-town guests.  It was a huge hit.  The bread is very moist.  Next time I might add a few nuts and raisins.

Wow! This was awesome. I may have overdone it on spices, as I usually want more than recipes tend to say, but the bread was still great once it cooled. My friends loved it. I added raw slivered almonds on the top before baking.

The cloves was overpowering and ruined my loaf.  Don't get me wrong, I love spice breads and my favorite cookies are gingerbread men, but because of the impact of the cloves I could hardly appreciate the delicate taste of the apples.  I would say 1/8 and maybe up to 1/4 teaspoon.  1/2 was overkill.

I made this recipe before I went to school and layed it out on the counter for my family to eat. It was a huge hit! My mom especially liked it. You could easily substitute the apples for chocolate chips or blueberries. Although if you substituted I wouldn't add the cloves or cinnamon.

Pretty good Apple bread; I did use brown sugar in place of the white, subbed pumpkin pie spice for the cloves and shredded the 2 apples into the batter. Very few quick bread recipes call for just butter, so I added about 2 Tsp of vegetable oil to the batter for extra moist-ness. Bread not quite done at 350 after 55 min and I noticed the crust was already dark so I turned the oven down to 300 and baked for an additional 10 minutes.  Next time I suggest baking the whole loaf at 325 for an hour and then testing.

This has become a huge family, and friend favorite! Everyone loves it. I really took review ideas from the first time I tried it. I split the sugar 1/2 white, 1/2 brown. I added a little oil on top of the butter, and it did make it more moist. I also took the review idea of the muffins, which was great because they only cook for 20 minutes. I doubled and tripled the recipes each time I have made them and have added 1/2 more of the apples. I used small apples that may be a part of why I needed more. So if making only one batch I would use 3 apples. I also cute the apples in wedges and then grated them into the bowl. Thank you for this excellent recipe, and it is so fun to see the other ideas and suggestions.

This bread is SO easy to make and so tasty. I diced the apples the first time, but it was too chunky, so the second time I made it, I used a wide cheese grater to grate the apples before I mixed them in - this lended a much better texture. I used a braeburn and a granny smith apple to give the bread some different flavors.

Delicious bread!  I grate my apples as my children aren't fruit fans and they still love this bread. Also I have substituted Peanut Butter for the Butter and that is also delicious.  I use all brown sugar too and have never had any issues with moistness.  Great as loaves, mini loaves, or muffins. I have tried them all.

I have done this a couple of times, and loved it everytime.  The trick is to not overbake it and then it is very moist.  Once I did not have enough apples on hand, so I used what I had and added applesauce - still great!

really good! My 2 and 4yr. old loved it. It was just the right sweetness. Used pumpkin spice in place of cloves and baked for 50 min. Used red gala apples in my food processer.

I gave this recipe 5 stars.  I'm a beginner, and after I made this, I feel I'm totally expert in baking now!  I followed suggestions from couple of reviewers to shred the apples and used half white half brown sugar.  My 3 year old asked for it many many times that day.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This had a really good flavor, but did not set up in the middle so I had to cook it a LONG time...  I finally gave up and just let it be doughy in the middle because the outside was burning.  I have never had a sweet bread fail on me like this...  I may try it again, but there are other recipes out there I will probably try first.  I would rate this one lower, but as I said, the flavor is really good...  just didn't work out for me as far as looks and texture...

This was a nice change for breakfast.  I added a bit more cinnamon and about 3/4 more apples.  I had to make it 10 minutes longer then stated in the recipe.  But everyone liked this.  I will make it again.  Thanks for the recipe

When I made this I made one loaf and then the rest in cupcakes the cupcake/muffins were very good.  I wrapped the loaf up and put away about 2 days later I cut into it, it was so good better then the muffins I think waiting a couple of days to eat it was what made it so good.

As is we could only give it a 3. Next time we'll try adding either rains, nuts, cranberries, or cranraisins & then it should qualify for a higher rating. As is, it seemed a blah, nothing that any different than another recipe I have. Good, but needed something.

This is pretty good, I used half butter and half applesauce, and it turned out quite moist still. I was short on apples, but it still tastes good and I will probably make it again. It's great for a quick breakfast on the run!

This is a great breakfast alternative and really easy to make!  I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and shredded the apples, added 2/3 cups dried cherries, used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white, and added 2 Tsp vegetable oil for moisture. I also added some ground ginger ad nutmeg but in the end, couldn't taste them, so next time, I'll add a little more. Will definitely make it again!

This bread was wonderful! Moist and very flavorsome! I altered the recipe slightly. I used 3/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup diet brown sugar and baked for 45 minutes, My husband loves it!

There is nothing really wrong with this recipe.  It tastes okay with butter, but I really didn't like the actual flavor.  Kind of bland, and kind of odd for some reason.  I won't make it again.
