Wow... fantastic, indulgent meal!  I used this recipe instead of the other carbonaras because of the pancetta, which I think is a step up from regular bacon- especially in this dish.  The only changes I made were fyring the pancetta first and then cooking 1/2 an onion, 1 large shallot and 2 cloves of garlic in the drippings.  And I omitted the pine nuts just because I don't like nuts in savory-type foods and the salt, as pancetta and parmesan are salty enough already.  Thanks KMOMMYZ... good stuff :)

This is not at all the classic Italian Carbonara. The Real Carbonara is simply 1 whole egg gently beat and added to that 24-36 month aged parmagiano-reggiano until you acheive a thick consistency or how you prefer with a pinch of salt and a twist of fresh ground pepper and of course the smoked pancetta not cooked till its crisp.Then add to that your preffered pasta . We use Tagliatelle egg  pasta.  This is a true recipe from Parma, Italy. But I am sure the other is nice too but is not an original.

WOW! This recipe is fabulous, as is!  This reminded me of a pasta I had while IN Italy!!! As far as the garlic goes...Carbonara traditionally is seasoned only with black pepper, and It was perfect! A++++

This was good. Better on the 2nd day.  I added crushed red pepper and 1.5 cups of peas (cooked), used extra black pepper and nutmeg and linguine.  Should have used a large onion instead of small.  The thing i liked most about this is that there was just the right amount of sauce.  I was worried that it would be too little but it turned out just right.  The night I made it, it seemed a little bland, but when I brought it for lunch the next day, the flavors had had a chance to really meld so it was much tastier.

Disappointed.  I found this when searching for recipes that had ingredients I had on hand. I followed the recipe just as written. I found it to be rich & bland.  Maybe I will give it a try again sometime and take another reviewer suggestion of adding garlic. Sorry.

We had this on a night before a race and expanded the recipe to generously feed eight.  Couldn't have been better.  It was delicious!  I used a mixture of bacon and pancetta and substituted fettucine for the penne.  Also, the pancetta was so salty, I used no additional salt. I did, however, grind out more pepper than the recipe called for.

This was excellent as written - rave reviews from the whole family.  I'll probably throw in some garlic next time around (maybe not a "traditional" seasoning, but how can you go wrong!)...

We really liked this one!  Left out the pine nuts, and added 2 tbsp of minced shallot.  Will probably go a little lighter on the cream next time

Make this all the time! We use it with the Fresh Pasta recipe and my Husband asks for it all the time. We do usually bump up the veggie count a little, adding broccoli, tomatoes, and spinach at the end plus anything else that catches our eye.  Make sure to use the tips about reserving the cheese and eggs until the end, otherwise it's scrambled egg pasta...still good, but not as fantastic. I also add a little bit of nutmeg. YUM!

Yay, this turned out perfectly! I needed a lot of patience to keep stirring the pasta while the sauce heated without turning up the flame, but it was well worth it. Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe. I added chicken in addition to the pancetta to increase the protein. I’ll definitely use the recipe again but may tweek it some.

Excellent.  Followed as written.  Everyone including toddlers gobbled it up.  I added edamame in place of peas for a little extra texture.

Have made this a few times, a few different variations. I've used bacon ( instead of pancetta) and added spinach and mushrooms to the sauté in the beginning and this is just wonderful! Will enjoy this time and again in my collection.

Good.  I substituted bacon for the pancetta, and I omitted the nutmeg and pinenuts because I didn't have them.

This is a simple but great tasting recipe! I don't like pine nuts so I left those out and deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup dry white wine after the pancetta.  I was only cooking for two so made half the recipe and had enough for one lunch the next day.  Would love to find a way to cut the cream so we can eat it more often w/o the guilt.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. I loved it and so did my co-workers.  I've made it several times and it always tastes great.  The last time I made it, I added 1 bunch of asparagus and replaced the pancetta with prosciutto. Yummy.  What do you think of Carbonara with shitake mushrooms, spinach, and veal?  Thanks again for your recipe.

This recipe was quite good. I found the sauce just a teeny bit watery for my liking, so I added more Parmesan. I also added mushrooms with the onions. Will definitely make again and with a few minor tweaks. Thanks for sharing!
