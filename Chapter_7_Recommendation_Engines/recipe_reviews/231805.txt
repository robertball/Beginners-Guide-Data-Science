This was very good, my husband and son really raved about it. I cooked two chicken breast, seasoned with garlic, onion and Mediterranean seasonings in my pressure cooker, then used the seasoned broth as my chicken broth. I probably had about three cups of chicken. This was so creamy good and had a very nice flavor. I do think I'd cut the broth down next time to just five cups for a thicker soup base. I also threw the spinach in the last 7 minutes of cooking to keep it from reducing too much. I'd like to try it with more vegetables, but really it was perfectly wonderful with just the spinach.

Fabulously easy!  I added garlic, since this recipe didn't call for it.  I cooked my chicken in some heavy spices, and then deglazed the pan with white wine...adding that to the stock as well.  I added celery and carrots as well as onions.  I'm the only spinach eater in the house, so I added spinach to my bowl and let the heat from the soup wilt it.  Instead of sour cream, I added about 3oz of cream cheese--simply because that was what I had on hand.  All in all, this worked for us--my extremely picky 8 year old ate 2 bowls of it without complaint.  Thanks!!!!

Nice & buttery! Didn't have enough tortellini but I just added some normal pasta. I also added some carrots with the spinach. I think 13 oz of alfredo & 5 cups of chicken broth makes it even more delicious though. Extremely awesome, easy, and yummy

This recipe is very easy and very delicious! I tweaked it slightly using nonfat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream, a package of frozen chopped spinach in place of fresh and Prego Lite Alfredo sauce.  My family loved it! The Parmesan sprinkled on top really adds to the rich flavor. Serve with bread sticks and you're all set!

SO delicious. I doubled the chicken for a meatier soup and seasoned it with Herbes de Provence and lemon pepper before cooking in extra virgin olive oil, then added all of the juices and meat to the soup. Very filling. A little goes a long way.

I gave this 5 stars because the flavor was good. I did make a change and will make some others to suit my tastes and I don't feel my changes should affect the rating. I added some chopped carrots instead of spinach. Next time I will add come corn and cut back on the amount of tortellini because I would like less pasta. My husband liked the amount it called for. All in all a great recipe to tweak if you want but good as is.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though I intentionally left out one ingredient. I've made this recipe four times and the hubs and I think it's the best tasting yet, every time.  I leave out the sour cream because I think it is delicious and rich enough with the alfredo sauce in it.  Also, I don't put onions in because my husband won't eat them.  I don't do it in the order listed, either.  I saute the garlic in butter, then add the chicken broth and the tortellini.  Once the tortellini is almost cooked, I add the alfredo, the chicken, and the spinach (I use frozen chopped) and cook until just heated through.  Since the chicken is already cooked, I don't see the need to cook it for 10 to 15 minutes more. I sprinkle it with grated romano and it's good to go.

I cut the spinach in half and put 4 extra ounces of pasta in the soup. Definite improvement for my kids.

I was looking for a chicken soup/stew to make on a rainy day when I found this recipe. I only had 1 package of spinach but I had everything else on hand so I tried this recipe. I loved it. I had a garlic alfredo sauce which gave it a little extra flavor. It such a perfect dinner for a cold rainy night. I will definitely make this again....Great easy recipe

This soup is so goooood. This is the 3rd time I have made it so I did tweek it just a little. I added fresh mushrooms to my saute .  Less spinach and more butter.  More tortellini. I used Prego  Parmesan Roasted Garlic Sauce.  I served it with toasted french bread.  This is a hearty  one pan meal soup that you can easily add more meat and tortellini to and make it  a man pleaser!!!!

My boyfriend raved about this soup, so it's a keeper!  I used rotisserie chicken, and also added 1/2 cup oil-packed sun-dried tomato strips, drained, during the simmering process, for added flavor.

Really good, but a little salty. I would recommend holding back on the extra salt for season or getting reduced sodium chicken broth. Overall, easy and good!

There is only one reason I didn't rate this a 5-star, I was out of fresh spinach and subbed frozen chopped broccoli, so I don't know exactly how it would have tasted with the spinach.  That being said, this soup had an excellent flavor. It was easy to put together and is one of those recipes that the ingredients don't have to be measured precisely to come out with fantastic results. The cheesy tortellini and the creaminess of the alfredo sauce made for a great texture and the chicken and veggies provided heartiness. The big guy loved this, so I'm a happy girl!

I made quite a few easier. I added milk instead of cream (because I didn't have any). I also added carrots, and celery and Italian Seasonings.  I liked it without the parmesan cheese, but my friends loved it with the cheese. I will definitely make it again.

This is a wonderful soup.    I used broccoli instead of spinach. and cut back on the  chicken broth (using only 5 cups).   I also seasoned the chicken with a rub while it cooked.   The leftover were fabulous as well (despite forgetting to add the Parmesan cheese when the leftovers were served).  I will definitely make  this again

I was hoping this would be as good as the one from a deli in Minneapolis that I often had for lunch when working. I chose this recipe because I thought it might be slightly lower in calories than one of the recipes with half and half.  While the flavor was good I thought it needed to be a little creamier.  I did add diced zucchini to try to add a little more nutrition without adding carbs & calories. I will be looking at other reviews & recipes to try to find the best way to make it creamier.

Good soup, nice comfort food.  I added Herbs de Provence and used lite Alfredo sauce, lots of pepper and some white wine.  Will make again!  I also added a couple roasted red peppers chopped.

This is a great soup to serve if you're feeling a little fancy but don't have a lot of time.  I like to substitute with light sour cream instead of full fat.  It also turns out fine if you don't have any chicken on hand -- I just add more spinach to bulk it up a bit.

Very rich and tasty. I just put all the ingredients into a large pan, except for the tortellini. Then I boiled frozen tortellini, and added it to the rest of the soup mixture, only simmering it for about 5 minutes to soften the fresh spinach.

I added a little extra chicken,  broth, and sour cream to stretch it.  My kids suggested adding a little chopped carrots and celery and reducing the spinach. Still,  it was a hit just as it is!

This is super easy, but as written is very very bland.  After tossing in generous helpings of pepper, sage, parsley, and oregano, it was incredibly tasty. (Next time I'll measure and add those measurements in.)  I'll definitely make it again!

I made this for the first time tonight and it was delicious! I thought the amount of spinach seemed like too much so I used significantly less because I have very picky eaters, but I will try it with more next time. My 3 year old who is very picky was making num-num-num noises as he ate!

I made this when I was expecting guests. I didn't know at the time that there was a picky eater I'd be serving it to... but it turns out he loved it so much his wife asked me for the recipe! Seriously delicious! Seriously easy!

This is the most amazing soup I've ever made. I've made it a dozen times already. The only modifications I did was to half the spinach and toss out the cubed chicken. I always double the recipe since my extended family comes over and always asks for it. The chicken cubes sink to the bottom of the pot and are an after thought and only eaten when the volume is low. No one missed them. I use chicken and cheese tortellini though.

Tasty stuff! This came out great. I added a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and mixed some of the cheese directly into the soup and it was delicious!

Really great soup.  Made this without the chicken because I didn't have any on hand.  I doubled the spinach and added a few mushrooms that I had in the fridge.  Delicious!  I would suggest adding the sour cream and spinach in the last 5 minutes of cooking, just as the tortellini becomes al dente.  I'm going to try bacon as a garnish next time.  The variations on this will be endless...

LOVE this recipe, I've made it at lease 3 times. This time, with the New Years resolutions in the back of my mind I replaced the chicken broth with a low sodium alternative, the sour cream with plain Greek yogurt, the Alfredo with a light low calorie alternative and used way less cheese then I normally would. Turned out just as awesome, while making it a tad healthier!

Amazing! I don't eat chicken, so I used pork instead, but will probably use shrimp next time. Instead of seasoning with salt and pepper, I used Old Bay. I added carrots, and had to substitute canned spinach for fresh, simple because thats what I had on hand. We could not stop eating it, it is delicious! Will make again and again!

This was SO easy and delicious!! Perfect for a cold day! I added mushrooms to it with the tortellini and waited until the last few minutes to add the spinach. This will be a common dish in our house from now on! (:
