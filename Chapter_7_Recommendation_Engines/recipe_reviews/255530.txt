Just call it a great recipe!  I used only Granny Smith apples.And I cut back on the sugar for the apples by about 1/4cup and added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Then mixed all of the apple slices in a bowl to coat them well.   I cut back about 1/4 cup of the sugar on the topping.  It was made the night before Thanksgiving, I removed the cobbler form the over when the top was light gold so that it wouls not overly brown during the reheating the next day.  350 degrees for 25 minutes.  The top is almost like a cookie, crisp and a great counter to the apples.  There were 5 desserts for the crowd and this one was the big hit.  So much easier than baking  pies, I will make this often.

10.10.16  Flavor is nice, but the apples (and I did use Mcintosh) cooked to almost an applesauce consistency and were dry at 42 minutes.  Followed the recipe to the letter, but I will start checking at 30 minutes next time and also will try slicing my apples a little thicker.

I used milk instead of water in the recipe.  Overall my family liked but all wanted more cobbler and less apples.  We sprinkled cinnamon sugar and poured milk over to eat.

I loved the layer of apples on the bottom with the dough over it. To add a little more flavor I put some whole cranberries on top of the apples before adding the dough. This gives a little tartness to the dish.  It was easy to make and company liked it.

Tried this today. It was neither crumble nor crisp. Very bland. I don't know what I did wrong but I won't try it again.

Easy and delicious. I  mixed  sliced apples, peaches, and blueberries. I used milk in place of water, added walnuts to the batter and added a sprinkle of nutmeg and cloves.
