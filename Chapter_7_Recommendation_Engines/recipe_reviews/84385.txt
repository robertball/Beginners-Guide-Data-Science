Great mashed potatoes. Very light and creamy. I used thyme instead of basil because it went better with the rest of our dinner... And the 10-star reason I chose this recipe - (based on an actual conversation) -- DH: 'Hey, why are these potatoes yellow?" - ME: 'I don't know.' - DH: 'Did you dye them yellow?' - ME: 'Yes.' -  DH: 'Why did you *do* that?’ - ME: 'I didn't *want* to do it, KAYLIVESHERE *told* me to...' - DH: ‘Huh? Who's KAYLIVESHERE?' - ME: 'I don't know.’ - DH: ‘*Why* did she tell you to dye the potatoes yellow??' - ME (smiling): I don't know. She didn't say.' --- Awesome. Thanks for the recipe!

These were AWESOME! They were the hit of my Thanksgiving dinner! I made them just the way your suppose to minus the food coloring, but near then end when they were done I about a half cup of cheese, and about a half a jar of Real bacon bits, and they were to die for! I only like instant, i HATE real mashed potatoes but I did them real this time for Thanksgiving, and I'll never go back to instant now because of this recipe!!

Nice and rich, using half and half. I forewent the food coloring - the yellow butter potaoes I used cast their own nice hue. All in all boiling the potaoes in their own spices lent them nice flavor without obvious add-ins. Good stuff!

These were the best potatos I ever had.  Even my wife (the cook) says these were the best potatos she ever had!  We used some basil that my wife grew...yummy.  She didn't like the yellow food coloring, but I did and so did the kids.  Makes them look buttery.  Oh my...we'll never make another potato recipe.  Thanks!!!!!

I've made these a few times...  The first time I added the food coloring and they were pretty yellow.  I omit the food coloring just because, who needs it?  The potatoes are great and flavorful.  I like that you boil the aromatics with the potatoes just makes prep easier.  Will continue to make.  Thanks!

Good mashed potatoes!  I thought adding the seasonings to the water gave the potatoes a nice taste.  I substituted seasoned salt for regular salt and tripled the amount of garlic.  I left out the food coloring.

These were really good.  I used this recipe for Easter dinner and everyone liked them though I might not use them every night just because they are so rich and after a few dinners of these I won't be able to fit into my Calvin Kleins.  I had leftover which I used for shepherds pie.  I only added 2 drops of food coloring though I think they are fine w/o it too.  Only thing is I added all the half and half at once rather than slowly and so my taters were a little thin but still good.

I made this recipe for Easter dinner, and it was a huge hit. I think my father-in-law had 4 helpings! I made the recipe with only a couple of changes - I didn't have any fresh garlic so I used dehydrated, but I have a sweet basil plant, so I used fresh instead of the dried - also omitted the food coloring. Very tasty, very easy - definitely a keeper.

Added some salt in the end but these are yummy.  First time EVER I have made taters that are not gummy.  Thanks for the tip.

Love Love this.  I wanted to call friends and relatives to pass this method on.  For just two of us, I used 4 medium potatoes and 1 medium onion and have leftovers (YEAH).   I used what I had. I added 1 tsp minced onion and 1 tsp chicken bouillon. I didn't  have sour cream so used about 1T butter and 1T cream cheese. I served with a dollop of butter.    I love gravy and consider it an important food group. But gravy is NOT needed.

Very good! I am a terrible cook, but that didn't stop these potatoes from coming out perfect. I made them exactly as instructed, no deviation. The paired perfectly with my Guinness Beef Stew (also from this site). Thanks!
