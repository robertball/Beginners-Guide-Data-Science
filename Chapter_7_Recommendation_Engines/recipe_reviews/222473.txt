I love this frittata for brunch, or lunch, or even a light weeknight dinner. I added some extra spices, but the most valuable ingredient I chose was a fresh salsa from my supermarket. It incorporates fresh tomato, onion, cilantro, and jalape√±o, so you can cut back in those ingredients, if you like. Among the spices I added are cumin, Mexican oregano, and cayenne.

I really enjoyed this and am kind of surprised since it had no meat in it... most of the time I make these with bacon ham or sausage in them.  I was running low on whole eggs so I made mine with half whole eggs and half egg whites from the carton, Didnt have a jalapeno so I added a but added a bit of crushed red pepper... yum
