Awesome recipe... just used the chicken thighs.  I wished there were a suggested amount of red pepper flakes to add ( I added 1 tbs ) ... too hot for me ... just right for the hubby! All in all... great copy cat recipe for general tsos chicken!  Thanks for the recipe!

Flavor was more sweet than spicy, but definitely had an asian taste :) I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead and added a red pepper cut up into chunks in the last 3 mins of cooking and finished off with sesame seeds for presentation. Good flavor, but lacking something savory in the sauce.

I love this recipe! I also boned the chicken and only used leg & thigh meat as I used to have this recipe from an old Chinese cookbook that I can no longer find, and the white meat seemed to always be too dry. I also used veg oil for frying, added minced garlic along with the ginger, and omitted the red pepper flakes. Thanks for posting!

Sauce is good but spicy!! So if you like heat you will love the sauce. I prepared my chicken in the oven as follows as we try to eliminate fried food when possible: cut chicken into 2 in cubes, place in zip lock bag with 1 cup all purpose flour. Shake to coat evenly. Whip 3 large eggs with 2 tbs of water in a bowl. Pour 3-4 cups of plain Panko bread crumbs in a shallow dish. Dredge the floured chicken through egg wash then into Panko crumbs to coat. Place on parchment paper lined cookie sheet and bake in preheated oven at 425 degrees for 20-25 minutes until golden. Pour sauce over chicken (vs cooking in pan since it is already cooked thoroughly) toss to coat. Serve over rice with steamed broccoli. Enjoy :)

Really great recipe.  I used sliced chicken breasts, chili oil, and added a little extra honey and ginger. I also added some cashew nuts as well. The heat from the chili was just right and the honey just gave it that sticky texture I love. This is definitely going to be a go to recipe for me from now on.

This is awesome, but make sure to use sriracha or another spicy type of chili sauce. I used a sweet Asian chili sauce, and it was still good, but with the honey and the other sweet flavors, I think it would have been better with a spicy sauce!

I didn't care for the sauce- it was sweet ,gooey and overpowered by the chili sauce.
