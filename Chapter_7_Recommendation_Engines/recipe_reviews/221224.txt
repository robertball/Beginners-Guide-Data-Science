Really good... I had to use red salsa in this because when I took the green salsa out of the fridge, well it didn't look like I should use it anymore.. I used a Mexican blend of cheese on the top and really enjoyed these

Definitely making again and giving 5 stars based on my changes to make it more of a vegan meal. I used what i had on hand and tweeked as follows - baked 2 large russet potatoes and while it baked, i simmered a small pot of kidney beans and black beans mixed with salsa. Scooped out potato and mashed in the bean/salsa mixture. Cut up some bits of old cheddar for the top and popped in oven. Sauteed mini bella mushrooms in chicken broth and garlic and served on top of baked potato. Dollop of sour cream and WOW.. AMAZING!!!!

To make this more vegan you would have to eliminate the cheese. 
Vegan means no dairy, no meat or meat broth.
