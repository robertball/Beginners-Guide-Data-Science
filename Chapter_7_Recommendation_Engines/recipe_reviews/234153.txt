very good and fluffy. I prepared a quicker way and didn't roll out the dough, instead I just used a muffin pan and rolled up a couple balls for each and voila! delicious.

These are delicious! I used vanilla yogurt and increased the salt to 1/2 tsp (and added a dash of salt to the icing) and just added all the cinnamon-sugar mix to the crumbly mixture. I also added more raisins. I rolled out a small circle and cut them into 8 wedges which I iced while still warm. They came out like decedent scones, crunch on the outside warm and tender on the inside!

I tried it and it was very good. I didn't use the icing and forgot to put the cinnamon sugar on before I baked them, but when done I brushed the tops with melted butter and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on.  Turned out real well.  Didn't need frosting. My husband loved them.

These were a tasty breakfast treat this morning. I did use Dannon Light & Fit Greek vanilla yogurt, as that is what I had on hand, and it worked great. My only recommendation would be to try to handle the dough as little as possible, to ensure a light and flaky biscuit. My kids frowned at the addition of the raisins, so I will omit the raisins next time, but that's just personal preference. Thanks for sharing these GFG!

It was great. Hubby loves it. I don't do the icing, only put sugar and cinnamon mixture as topping. Sometimes I use 1c wheat flour n 1c white flour. Still tastes great!!!

I thought they were okay, but all of my neighbors raved about them.  I don't have measuring utensils; so I eyeballed the ingredients and ended up with something pretty runny (at least for something that was supposed to be cut).  Since I don't have a biscuit cutter or even a round cookie cutter, I didn't worry too much about the consistency and just plopped it in mounds on a cookie tray.  I regularly bake bread, and everyone who has tried these thinks I should switch to biscuits.  (Not going to happen, but they are now the title-holding champion of "most delicious 'bread' to exit my oven.")

I only gave it 4 stars because I wasn't that impressed personally.

Used glueten free flour, had to add 3 teaspoons of orange juice and cooking time took me 11 minutes.

These were delicious. Very flaky and light they baked to a nice brown. I recommend using other dried fruit cut small for vairiation and changing the spices. I made them smaller than suggested. They were perfect.

I followed the recipe instructions but left out the raisins. I also added a dash of nutmeg with the cinnamon. I used a 2% greek yogurt and I love it! It really does taste like a cross between a cinnamon roll and a biscuit. I might add a teaspoon of vanilla extract next time to the yogurt to enhance the flavor.

Good flavor but a little too much cinnamon for me. Like others, I forgot to sprinkle sugar/cinnamon, so I added it to the icing. I used Greek yogurt & needed about a 1/4 C more to get crumbs to stick together, which lengthened the cooking time.

These tasted good but were very flat...followed the directions exactly so not sure why they didn't rise much.

Perfect!  The texture was great, the taste was great - I have no criticism.  
I can see potential in this recipe... strawberry yoghurt, coffee yoghurt, chocolate yoghurt with chocolate chips... plain yoghurt with feta and cranberries!
It's going to happen.

I added 1 tsp orange juice concentrate to the dough and omitted the frosting.  I also shaped the dough into a big circle.  The kids loved it!  They called it dessert pizza.

They are really good and easy to make. I ended up with left over cinnamon sugar I would make 1/2 the cinnamon sugar next time, I also did not make the glaze.

Very good !  I used just a little bit of the sugar icing and more orange juice and poured it over the last few minutes of baking. 
Thank you

Thanks for the recipe! I didn't make the icing because I didn't have orange juice but still very good and not too sweet. Everyone in the family liked them.
