I make these a lot, on busy mornings. To keep from a huge mess, I use a biscuit cutter in my frying pan to cook the egg in, so it's uniform in shape and fits the bread. I make mine with whole wheat toast and sharp cheddar and lots of Frank's. My kids like theirs with ketchup.

These are a staple in our house and are great for on the go.  I made one this morning for my husband to take to work.  We don't put the mayo on and use whatever cheese we have in the house.  I also add bacon or ham.

Pretty yummy, definitely great with a runny yolk as MOLLE888 said.  The mayo gives it a creaminess but I love a miture of ketchup/frank's red hot sauce for my breakfast egg sandwiches so I may dip in that next time.  I used cheddar cheese but it might be too bland for this - I may stick with the american cheese as written in the recipe later.  Really a quick, filling meal.

This is probably one of my earliest memory, comfort food sandwiches. At my house, we used Miracle Whip, but other than that, this is pretty much the ONLY way my mommy could get me to ingest American Cheese (though I still prefer a sharp cheddar). So good. From ages 2-102, you will LOVE IT! If you're 103, add ham :)

This was pretty good. I used "Veggie Shreds" for the cheese, and omitted the butter to suit my dietary needs. It was an easy, quick dinner, perfect since I was not in the mood to really cook.

I make these quite often.  I use light bread, smart balance and 2% cheese to cut down on the calories.  Quick and easy for breakfast, lunch or dinner.

We make these often.  But when in a real hurry and to make it even quicker we will crack the egg into a microwave safe bowl salt/pepper and microwave it for 45 seconds.  Then the longest part is toasting the bread.  Always a good treat!!

Pretty good, but I prefer my bread untoasted, with just mayo, no butter. I also use freshly sliced cheddar cheese and add it to the top of the egg in the pan so it melts, before adding it to the bread.

I have made these for years and they are always a favorite!  My kid's have yet to develop a love  for "eggwiches" as I have, but I know I will convert them soon.  I usually break my yolk so I won't have yellow goo spurting as I eat and drive, but I also add some zip by adding Texas Pete to my mayo.  I often omit the cheese, love the zip of the Texas pete and egg alone.

An egg sandwich is one of my very favorites.  I liked this sandwich, but I did have to flip the egg for about 30 seconds.  I had to make sure ALL the white was cooked.  I used co-jack cheese rather than American slices.

Very easy and delicious.... I actually used provolone cheese instead of American.  But the best part is a very well known secret... instead of using mayo or butter you just use HP Sauce.  To sum up HP Sauce, it is A1 Steak Sauce x 100.  Do yourself a favor and find out where you can buy it... you'll never have A1 again and you'll find yourself using HP on almost everything possible!!

Ive been meaning to try this for a while but thought it sounded weird. I thought it was pretty good. Next time I would cook it alittle longer and put something else with it like ketchup, hot sauce or even mustard.

I make these all the time except I never use mayo and I switch up the cheese depending on what we have.  I especially love them with a couple slices of tomato.  Sometimes I use spinach, cucumber or even bacon if we have any!  Pretty much works with whatever’s in the fridge.

A good quick meal on the go. I do add more margarine though as I toast my bread light, then grill it the rest of the way. Also great using scrambled egg. Better if the bread is not too fresh/soft before you toast it.

I didn't even realize this recipe was on here until just now, lol. We have been making these forever and they are soooo great! I usually make them just as stated, but sometimes I replace the mayo with whipped cream cheese. Mmmmm, these are definately awesome! :)

Yummy! I loved the mayo on there, although I was a little scared at first. Added a great zip to the sandwich. I was out of American cheese, so I used shredded. I also added some ketchup. I loved how the yolk broke; gooey and delicious! Thank you, this will be a staple!

We eat these frequently, but usually choose to use fresh italian bread in place of the toasted bread.  We don't toast it and leave out the butter.  Very good and quick!
