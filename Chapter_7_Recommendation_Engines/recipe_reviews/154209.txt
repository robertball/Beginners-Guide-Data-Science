This is my kids' favorite way to eat garlic bread. I will usually buy hot dog buns off the reduced bread rack at my local store and use them for this(or you can use this recipe and toast the bread in the oven for about 15 minutes for quick croutons). This is great for making handheld spaghetti sandwiches, too.

This is a great way to use up hot dog buns, I can't believe I never thought about doing this before!! I really liked these not only because they were super easy, but they tasted great too. The only change I made was to use shredded colby-mont. jack cheese. Will make again anytime I need to use up some hot dog buns.

This is great for using up leftover hotdog (or hamburger) buns. It's not as *fancy* as some other garlic bread recipes, but you don't end up wasting leftover buns and it's tasty too, so it works for me! :)

I have also used hot dog and hamburger buns to make pizza for kids & grandkids to use up leftover pizza sauce or spaghetti sauce. they are a quick snack.I put them in the toaster oven for a few minutes to toast  and melt cheese.

OMG! This really gave me a chuckle... LOL! I have been doing this for longer than I care to admit. Also make the pizzas on hamburger buns, mentioned by a previous reviewer. Don't know why I didn't think of this as a recipe, because it really is... and a good one. Being a saltaholic, I use 1/2 garlic powder and 1/2 garlic salt. Never tried basil but will tonight, with spaghetti and meat balls. Thanks KYcooky for bringing this simple, yet tasty, recipe to the attention of others.

Great for last minuet hors d'oeuvres to feed unexpected guest. We  have been doing this for years  with  left over  buns and rolls.  There are  variations you can add as "toppings", such as real Bacon Bits (real,not imitation), sliced mozzarella or cheddar cheese (cut down to size), pepperoni.  
As far as the recipe  goes what we do is use 1/4  to 1/2 stick real butter (softened) and use crushed garlic  and just mix everything  together then spread the mix on the rolls  then add our topping and  bake.

It wasn't bad but I think I will make some changes the next time cuz I didn't find it very tasty... I'll probably use more butter and cheese and try some spices on!

I've been making this for years. I use hamburger buns or sandwich bread, too, whichever is handy. I also use parsley instead of basil. It's such a great idea, fast, and helps use up bread that would otherwise go bad. Thanks for submitting!

Definitely a good way to use up hot dog buns. I had jumbo buns so I ended up cutting them in half to make them shorter and for it to be more like breadsticks - I cut it again down the middle. Used Italian seasoning and ate this dipped in Cheesy Pizza Fondue (also from this site). Quick and easy, thanks!

Great way to use up hot dog buns, or to make garlic bread in a pinch! I only used 2 hot dog buns because there were just the two of us, but I used the same amounts of the basil, cheese and garlic powder.  When hubby came to the table he chuckled at our "hillbilly garlic bread".

I have made this recipe and it is great and economical.  If you want to vary the presentation a little, you can prepare the garlic bread following the same recipe but just before toasting cut the hot dog buns in strips. Viola, you have garlic breaksticks.  After they are cool, I store them in a cute tin on the counter by the stove....they make great quick little snacks.  Good with soups or pasta dishes.  Enjoy.

This is a great way to use up the old hot dog buns.  You really don't have to measure any of the ingredients, just add to your own liking and bake.

Not bad.  I misread the directions, though--I thought it said to mix the butter in with the basil, garlic powder and cheese.  by the time i figured it out, it was too late to correct it.  However, I always make my own garlic bread by mixing the garlic and seasonings with the butter--I think it makes it more flavorful--so it was par for the course in this house.  I also added some fresh garlic to the mix bc I just love garlic.  I used hamburger buns since I had those but no hot dog buns.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were delicious.  I've made this twice.  Only change I made the 2nd time today was:  I used 2 Tbs melted butter, 2 Tbs ghee/clarified butter, and 1 tsp garlic paste to brush on the bread.  The ghee has a higher smoke point, so it kept the whole thing from burning as easily as it has in the past when I used only butter.  It soaked into the bread beautifully, very much like store bought frozen garlic bread.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe that really saved the day for my Italian food themed family get together.  I used sub buns that I had in the freezer, while still frozen I buttered and seasoned them then sliced them in 2 inch sections.  I also used fresh basil which made it really fragrant and beautiful.  I popped them in the oven right before it was time to eat then piled them high on a serving dish.  There was nothing left!  I love this recipe because it reminds us to use what we have available.

5 Stars for re-purposing leftover buns, which is genius (why didn't *I* think of it?), and very tasty. -1 star for the basil, which didn't strike the right note for me. Next time I'll double the butter and use fresh parsley instead. That should elevate this lovely recipe to 5 stars. Still, simply brilliant, KYCooky, thanks!

It is a great, easy idea for garlic bread, I will probaly cut back the basil waaaay back next time. I mixed all ingredients then spread
on the bread, figured it was the easiest way to get the parm to stick to the bread without it getting all over. Thanks for the great idea!

My family loves garlic bread, so I doubled the ingredients (except for the basil).  I still had only enough spread for 4 whole hot dog buns, so I guess I will have to quadruple it!  I must spread it more liberally than some - haha!  My picky kids loved it!

This is the best garlic bread our family has every had!  The only changes we made was to use fresh garlic instead of powdered, and butter instead of margarine.

This is fun. An easy way to use leftover hotdog buns and you can get crazy with the spices. I add a little cayenne to the butter mixture to get a little bite.

This is so easy and good. I always grow way more Basil then I need to so I put some home made Pesto on the buns too then top with some Italian cheese blend or Parmesan whatever I have on hand and bake or broil until golden. yummy.

I have been doing this for years and it works great, I also change it up some by sprinkling hot pepper flakes and shredded mozzarella over top. My husband likes it with his steaks and Beef Stews. Works with different buns and rolls.      Joanfen Woodlawn Va.

I used fresh minced garlic, reduced garlic powder portion and substituted margarine with extra virgin olive oil.  Kids loved it!  This recipe is a keeper!

Good and easy.  Mine got a little too brown and crunchy.  I will watch them more closely next time.

I agree it's a great way to use up hot dog buns.  Could use more butter and a little less Parmesan.

Quick, easy and delicious (according to all in family, including teenager). I used butter instead of margarine, and 1/2 loaf of Italian bread cut into 4 pieces. Yum!

I have been using hot dog buns for years.  Make a garlic butter and after spreading it on the buns and lightly toasting, add a slice of your favorite Italian style cheese.

I've been doing this for years to use up old hot dog/hamburger rolls or bread slices.  I just spread with butter or spreadable margarine and sprinkle with McCormick's Garlic Bread Sprinkle and broil until toasted.

Fine in a pinch, but there's way better ways to do this.
