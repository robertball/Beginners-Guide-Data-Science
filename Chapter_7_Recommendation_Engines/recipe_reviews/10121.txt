This really helped simplify my xmas cookie baking for a pot luck.  From this recipe I made 4 of the cookie types, all were good, I reviewed each seperately.   I had about 8+ dozen cookies in 2 hrs!  I will use this again and tweak the individual recipes to correct some problems.

This dough is DELICIOUS! It is so quick, and it tastes great straight out of the bowl. I used it as the base for the make ahead toffee bars. Exactly what I was looking for to give as holiday gifts! Thank you, Lynn.

This is an old OLD Pillsbury recipe from a magazine that everybody's mom and grandma have been making for years. Then you can look up the TEN holiday cookies you can make from this mix, they are: Chocolate Chip, Almond Butter Sticks, Oatmeal Carmelitas, Oatmeal Raisin, Toffee Bars, Butterballs, Peanut Butter (or with kisses pressed in the middle), and Cut-Out Sugar Cookies.

I have used this recipe for many years and have never been disappointed.  My family always loved the almond butter cookies and cannot wait for Christmas every year to enjoy them.

Very easy to use.  I'm not sure how it fares in the fridge for up to 4 weeks though, as I used the batch I made the same day.  I made several of the other "Make Ahead" recipes, and most of them turned out just great.  Making the mix and then using it for several of the different cookie recipes sure makes it easy to bake a few different types of cookies easily-would be a huge help at the holidays!

The concept is a good one, but without the instructions on how to make the different cookies, I'm at a loss. (It's rated with one star not because it was inedible, but because I literall couldn't eat something I couldn't make.)

This recipe was not to my liking.  Made the basic dough put in frig.  Couple of days later took basi dough added ingredients for "Butter Balls".  Receipes said to roll balls in powder sugar after cooled.  There was no rolling to these balls.  They looked like regular cookies.  What a dissappointment.  Threw everything out and started over.  Don't have time to waste when doing holiday baking.  I've had trouble with other receipes from All Recipes.  Going back to Betty Crocker, Better Homes and Taste of Home.

Sensible way to manage cookie baking for the holidays. I found that the dough after being refrigeratated was clumpy and hard to measure, so I put the dough in a food processor and pulsed to get a fine meal, which made it so much easier to measure and to incorporate into the other recipes.

I've made this and used it for 3 separate batches--2 toffee bars, and one (doubled) jam thumbprints.  Everything has turned out perfectly.  The mix got a bit solid in the fridge, and I spent some extra time breaking up the chunks in my Kitchen Aid, but I'm very satisfied w/ the product overall.
