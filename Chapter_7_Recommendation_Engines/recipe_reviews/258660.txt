This chicken was a huge hit with my family and it's an easy recipe.  I only did a couple of things differently:  I used a teaspoon each of salt and red pepper flakes instead of the tablespoon of each that was called for.  And I added garlic powder to the marinade, probably 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.  Yum.  Definitely a do-again!

I really liked how this marinade worked out; I only did a small batch of chicken thighs, because I wanted to use an indoor grill. After marinating for five hours(wrapped), I grilled it at 375, closed, for twelve minutes, then transferred it to a 375 preheated oven for an additional fifteen. Flavor is excellent, but chargrilled would definitely yield a better flavor!
