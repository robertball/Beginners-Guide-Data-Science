To me, this brown bread is PERFECTION. I love it. I made it exactly as the recipe suggests. I'll never make another version again. (just a note: the directions forget to tell you to add the salt listed in the ingredients)

Very simple. A dense, chewy bread with a deep flavor. My older son helped me make this in the morning before it got too hot. It was simple enough for him to help with with minimal supervision. I did have to cover this with foil about 20 minutes before it came out because it would have scorched if I hadn't. Good contrast against Cha Cha's White Chicken Chili. NOTE: To make your molasses slip easily from your measuring cup, give it a good spritz with your baking spray. Comes clean like whoa.

Really good.  My husband said, "Tastes just like bread out of a can."  (If you're confused, that's a good thing.)  To keep the kitchen cooler, I used the quick-bread setting on my bread machine.  Worked great.  Thanks.

Wonderful! Change nothing, this recipe is perfect except add 2/3 c raisins soaked in 1/4 c apple juice for 15-30 minutes. :)

AMAZING! I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. So moist, just a touch of sweet. I will be making this again and again.

I wasn't sure I liked Boston Brown Bread but decided to give it a try - we loved it!  The loaf barely lasted 24 hours.  The recipe was extremely easy and I liked that there weren't too many ingredients - it took less than 5 minutes to get in the oven.  I made a couple of minor changes - 2 cups white flour & 1 cup wheat and tossed in a handful of raisins before baking.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I thought this bread was delicious!  And, so easy to make, too!  I like the sweetness the brown sugar adds.  It's not too sweet, but a hint of sweet that you don't find in some brown breads. It'a a winner!

I'm not used to baking bread without yeast and I was surprised to see that this really did rise! I also added wheat germ and some bran and it turned out amazingly good. Loved this and thanks!

Great recipes. And easy to make.  My husband is from south of Ireland, and he love it. I sub 2/3 cup of whole  wheat to 7 grains. And reduce sugar to lose 1/2 cup. We don't like it too sweet! I also use 2 smaller tins to bake it. And one can share! It taste like the brown bread we had in Ireland. It goes very well with honey. Thank you.

Very easy and simple to make.  I found I had to bake it longer than an hour, but the letting it sit and cool down to finish cooking is probably very important.  I loved the taste.  It wasn't too sweet, but just right, and the molasses is a very strong flavor.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I had some leftover buttermilk and was looking up recipes to use it in and whole wheat flour. I wasn't sure with the list of ingredients or the fact that it had no yeast, etc. But, it tasted like a mix between pumpernickel and beer bread, and it had a pretty good texture. Mine baked in about 50 minutes. It tasted best though, when it came out of the oven warm, with margarine or butter. I wouldn't call this an everyday kind of bread, as it has such a strong and distinct taste, but it tasted fine for the evening with our meal.

This was so easy to make and a nice change from typical quick breads.  The bread tastes best warm with some butter on it.  The next time I make it, though, I'll probably do 2 cups of white flour and 1 cup of wheat flour.  The wheat flavor was a bit strong (salty/bitter) for me.  My husband said he could eat this for dessert.

This a wonderfully easy bread to make. Was the first time I made bread and will diffently make it again. Tastes wonderful fresh out of oven with butter. Is a wonderful snack bread. Husband and children ate it before I could get a second piece.

This makes tasty bread with good flavor and texture.   I added a half cup of raisins because I’ve never had Boston brown bread without raisins (I think it’s the law) and the raisins add to it.  It’s not the recipe I was looking for but was still very good.

This tastes just like what my Grandmother used to make when I was young! After her passing, nobody seemed to know what happened to her recipies. So I  added 2/3 cups raisins, that I had soaked in boiling water. I also baked the bread in cans. Only because thats how I remember Grandma doing it that way. Never knew why she boiled the raisins or used cans, but thats how I will always make it. Just because thats the way she did. Thank You for the wonderful recipe and the memories :)

This isn't the brown bread that I remember...it's not as dark.  However, it's phenomenal.  I really had to wrap it up and practically hide it from myself.

I am a fan of butter, but this really is so much better with cream cheese.  I can't wait to try it warmed over with some fruit butter in the morning.  I have some cherry butter that will be amazing with it.  

Some reviewers mentioned that it got too done/dry at the full 60 minutes, so I checked it at 45 and it still needed a little more time.  I went 50 and the middle was still a little wet when I pulled it out and let it cool.  But I even like the slightly underdone part - the whole loaf had a great moist texture.  Couldn't have been easier to make, tastes and smells amazing.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

very easy to make and turned out even better than I thought it would - sweet, moist and dense.  Try it with some apple butter spread on top.

This is a pretty good recipe. The only change I may make next time is to either do 1 1/2 cups each of the whole wheat and unbleached flour, or do 2 cups unbleached and 1 cup whole wheat as suggested by another reviewer. Thank you for a yummy recipe! :)

very good. rises to two - three times the volume and is lighter than expected. I used Splenda brown sugar (so used 1/2 the volume) and it was a little sweet for me. Next time I'll reduce. Also, the cooking time was too much. After 30 minutes I reduced the temp to 325 and covered with foil to prevent over-browning. It was done after 45 minutes

This was wonderful! I made it in 3 mini loaves ( baking about 35 minutes at 350°)and added 1 cup of raisins, it came out perfect. We ate up all 3 loaves while it was still warm, and I am baking 3 more this morning for breakfast, and so my daughter can have a loaf to take back to college with her. Just a wonderful cold-morning treat!

Wonderful bread!  I took it out at 45 minutes (it looked very done - was very dark and toasted on the top), but wished I had taken it out at 50 minutes - was a big gooey in the middle.  I think 60 minutes would've been too long, so I'll try 50 minutes next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my word, this is such GOOD brown bread! I particularly like that I can make one loaf. I made it exactly as stated but took it out of the oven after 53 minutes because it looked done (and was). My husband loves it too so this recipe will definitely be a keeper and will be used over and over. Thanks so much paradigmgirl.

Love this! It reminds me of the brown bread (in the can) that I had as a child. I like the original recipe but did end up improving it the next time around by using half rye flour and half cornmeal for the white flour and adding about a cup of raisins. Now it's perfection in my book. Yum!

My family loves this brown bread as is. After making the recipe as written I did get creative. I found that using 1/2 cup rye flour for part of the whole wheat flour works well. I also add 1/2 cup ground flax seed for part of the all-purpose flour. Easy recipe without the steaming required for most brown breads.

Moist, flavorful, and easy. I wouldn't change a thing. Served with a white chilli and it was perfect.

The flavor of the bread was okay though a bit too sweet but the texture was *weird*. It was crumbly and almost grainy. I won't make it again.

Good, but definitely NOT traditional Boston Brown Bread. The traditional bread uses several grains and is steamed, not baked.

I added 1/2 c. softened raisins and two tablespoons of melted shortening to be sure that it was tender and not chewy. We all think it is delicious. Also, my bread pan is a glass Pyrex, at 4.5" x 8.5". I used my extra batter to fill a baby bread pan, too.

This is a good bread, it's a little sweeter than I wanted it to be, but the flavor is still very tasty. Though I'll keep looking for the "perfect" brown bread recipe.

This was the easiest, best tasting bread. The only change I made was to add 3/4 cup raisins. It is moist and slightly sweet. Excellent!!

We live in North Carolina. I am a native, however my wife is born and bred from Mass. She raves about canned brown bread all the time so I decided to try and appease her innerchild a little. She found the texture to be slightly tougher, however the taste was a duplicate of her memories. She was somewhat disappointed because all she can think about is how moist the bread was once it came out of the can, however I explained to her that inside is what matters most because it was being made in a can and the can is what made it moist! Some things can be duplicated, but alas not everything. Pleased overall, but had to throw much of it to the birds who now are diabetic from this extremely sugary bread treat. lol

Just like the stuff from the can, but has a better texture and no worms!!! (I had a bad experience involving worms and canned brown bread and I have never bought it since.) I added some raisins and made it into 4 mini loaves. Delcious, healthy and no complicated and difficult steaming involved. Bravo! 5 stars.

I tried this at home, followed to the letter and it was excellent. I adapted it for a camping trip by placing all the dry ingredients in a gallon sized ziplock freezer bag. I used dry buttermilk and added that to the dry stuff too. The molasses went into a snack sized ziplock and put that inside the dry ingredients bag until we got to our destination. At camp I removed and squeezed the molasses bag out into the dry ingredients bag. Then mixed in 2 c water and baked the bread in a 12" cast iron Dutch Oven over the coals from the campfire. It was perfect with Irish Stew and a pint of Guinness on a chilly night!

A simple and tasty sweet bread!  It took about 5 minutes to mix together and then I baked it for 45 minutes.  It came out moist and delicious!  I added a small box of raisins for extra goodness.  Next time I might also add some chopped walnuts.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely make again!

I've been using this site for six years and this is the first time I've commented on a recipe, that's how good this recipe is. THIS BREAD IS GREAT! It's healthy and it's easy and it tastes incredible. I did it with buttermilk and regular milk with vineger, buttermilk is best. As a Maritimer baked beans and fish cakes are a favorite meal in this home, brown bread is the icing on the cake. Huge hit with the whole family. Thank You.

Very good! I'm from Boston and have had the canned version of brown bread many times...this is just as good. My husband was doubtful when he saw me making it but enjoyed the final product. It's very moist and great with lots of butter!

This bread was very easy to make.  I had it cutomized to serve four and baked it in a smaller loaf pan (7 1/2 by 3 3/4. It turn out great.  It was sweet and  more like a dessert. I will definitely make it again.

This was a very simple recipe and the flavor was nice, but it was NOT even close to the flavor of  the B&M Boston Brown Bread in a can that I was craving.  If that is the flavor you are targeting, then probably go with the Boston Brown Bread I recipe on this sight, as it uses a full cup of molasses instead of 1/4 and no brown sugar (it also calls for raisins, which this recipe does not and IMO is part of what makes this bread so delicious and unique).

We made this easy and tasty bread for a Boston Tea Party school project and inadvertently discovered that it makes a great toddler snack too. It's sweet enough that little ones will eat it readily, but the sugar content isn't bad (and you could probably reduce it a bit if you wished). With whole wheat flour as the main ingredient, it's healthy and filling, certainly a better choice than most crackers. And it's dense enough that it doesn't leave a ton of messy crumbs. This one's a keeper!

Terrific, my Cali bred grandkids love it. I'm from Mass and it was always served with beans and hot dogs. Couldn't find the canned anymore locally and tried another recipe (not right), then this. An added bonus. I have a dog that's on regular medication, this subs well for those expensive "pill pockets" that are sold. Just roll a little around the pill. LOL, you can keep leftover in the freezer and just thaw enough for a week or so. A little sweet, but overall, healthy.

This is super quick, easy, and delicious. A whole wheat bread without yeast!! I had it with Curried Carrot Soup from this site. The second time I made it was with only 1/3 cup of brown sugar, which I preferred as a normal bread, but this would be great as is with raisins added. Thanks for this quick bread recipe! :o)

I never made Boston Brown Bread before and was looking for a recipe to have with my Boston Baked Beans. I found this recipe and made it. BUT I only baked it for 48 minutes. One hour would have ruined it. As it was the crust got too hard. BUT all in all my husband and I thought it was wonderful and I WILL be making it again!

My 15 year old daughter is a huge fan of this bread. I made it to go with a rosemary carrot soup and both loaves were gobbled within 24 hours.  Something to note, I substituted the wheat flour with white flour and the buttermilk with whole milk and it still came out beautifully.

I made this brown bread to go along with my Boston Baked Beans and it was fabulous! So much better than the canned stuff I used to eat when I was a kid. I will be making this one again soon.

This bread was great!  Not quite the taste I remember but very close.  The only thing I would change with the recipe is the cooking time.  An hour was too long in the oven.  The crust was just too chewy.

Very delicious! The perfect combination of sweet with an edge! I also sprinkled a handful of flaxseeds over top for extra nutrient value. Definetly a keeper!

This bread recipe is great. Baking in Central Oregon is always a challenge - I'm at 4200 ft and dry, so I used two smaller pans. The bread came out done in the middle with a nice crust. Also used Bob's Red Mill unbleached white flour & whole wheat pastry flour. Served with Boston Baked Beans made with Canadian bacon - great meal for a snowny Sunday afternoon.

Yummy. Only differences is I added raisins and cooked in 2 slightly smaller loaf pans so I could freeze one.  Cooked in about 30 minutes.   My 1 & 3 year old LOVED too.

So easy to make and really yummy!  Pretty sweet but not overly so.  I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted vinegar and milk for 1/2 of it and plain yogurt for the other 1/2 of it.

I have a strong dislike of molasses so I substituted maple syrup. I also added a cup of raisins because many of the recipes I've seen for Boston Brown Bread include them and I like them. What I didn't count on is that this seems to have caused the batter to spill over the side of the pan as it rose (I'm assuming it was the extra volume of the raisins that was responsible). In addition to the overflow issue it didn't get quite as firm inside as I would have liked and I had to take it out because the crust was starting to burn. It tastes really good though so next time I will either split it into two loaves or make muffins.

This really IS the BEST! If you are a fan of the canned brown bread you find in the store, you'll know what I'm talking about.  It tastes exactly like it, only better since it's homemade.  It baked up nice and high as well.  The only thing I'll continue to do differently is follow the advice of the reviewer who switched the ratios of flour -- so... 2 cups of all purpose flour and 1 cup of ww flour instead of the other way around.  Now, I really wish I had more buttermilk to make another loaf.  I can't say enough good things about this recipe - I'm definitely glad I decided to try this one! Thank you so much for posting it!

So very incredibly yummy, dense, and moist.  It has a strong molasses flavor without being cloyingly sweet.  My husband and I both loved it and I'll be making another loaf tomorrow!

I had problems with this recipe.  It did not turn out as expected and took a lot longer to bake than recipe stated.  When it finally got done, it tasted ok. But it's not something I will make again.

For those New Englanders out there, this is one of the best homemade brown breads out there...I added raisins to mine, and yes, the bread is supposed to be dry if you buy the stuff in the can...this was moist and delicious.  Just what one needs to go along with homemade Boston baked beans and franks!

I just didn't understand this bread.  Is it a sweet bread or one to eat with meals?  It's not that is turned out "bad" per sey, but I struggled to find it's place in our meals.  At first you wanted it to have raisins in it, the your'e like, maybe a bowl of soup.  A little dry as well.  Will not be making this again.

This was pretty good & super easy, but we're originally from New England, and our recipe is a bit more involved.  Also, the bread is always baked in a (clean) metal 1 lb. coffee can, but you can't get that anymore.  (Fortunately, we still have many which we saved).  We still always bake our delicious bread for Thanksgiving & Christmas, and whenever someone needs a little old fashioned comfort.

I am diabetic, so I changed the sugar to an artificial sweetener. Same amount. I also turned down the oven a bit, as it seems as if the sweetener burns quicker than brown sugar. Third time lucky and I had great reviews this afternoon. Even picky eaters loved it. Well worth the (very little) effort.

Very easy to make and very good. I did not have molasses and used maple syrup.
I reduced the sugar to 1/3 of cup.
It is gone and I am planning to make it again tomorrow.

I made this exactly as written (rare for me!), and we love it! The 5 stars are for ease of prep, flavor, small ingredient list, family approval and no yeast (not because of an allergy, only because I never have any on hand). 

I did have to adjust cooking time a little, maybe because I used a dark/non-stick pan? I only cooked it for 50 min at 350, cooled in pan for 10, and then 20 more on rack before I couldn't take it anymore and I had to slice a piece off. Delicious! Thank you for the recipe, I'll be making it again (and again!)

I love this recipe!  It looks great on the dinner table, tastes awesome with a pat of butter.  I made a few changes, but only out of necessity.  I didn't have enough whole wheat flour, so I used 1 1/3 c WW, 1 1/3 cup white flour, and 1/3 cup cornmeal.  I didn't have brown sugar, so I used white and increased the molasses to 1/3 cup, while removing just a bit of the buttermilk.  
Forty minutes in, it looked like it was baking too quickly on the top, so I moved it to the lower rack for the last twenty minutes.  
Crust came out just perfect all around.  This recipe is officially a keeper!

Irresistible is the perfect word. Followed the recipe, baked it for 50 minutes. Served with ham which is so good with dark bread or bread that's a little sweet. This is both.

Probably the easiest bread I've ever made and the tastes was great (big fan of molasses).  I took the advice of a reviewer and put foil over the bread for the final 20 min of cooking time. It came out perfectly and was perfect with butter.

First, let me just say that I LOVED this bread!  But...if you are looking for a bread that is, well, bread like, this is not it.  However, if you are looking for a moist bread that's similar to banana bread, then look no further!  This bread is fantastic warm with some butter or cream cheese on top.  I didn't change anything in the recipe except that I mixed the ingredients by hand and then used my bread machine to bake it (by using the bake only setting at 1 hour 5 minutes) and it turned out perfect!

Made as described except couldn't find my  loaf pan and used muffin tins instead and they came out like the best bran muffins I've ever had. Light, moist, just enough sweet and delicious warm out of the oven with butter or vegetable oil spread. Will make again. So easy and a great eat-on-the-run breakfast food.

My 4yr son would not go to bed without having a slice - I thought the nuttiness of the molasses would be unappealing to him, but he loved it.  Great with cream cheese in the morning.

I made this bread because my sister told me to try it. I am so glad she did. It was easy to make and it tastes so good. I made it yesterday and most of it is gone but I did have a small piece left which I toasted fo breakfast. The only thing I did differently was to use half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour. It is a great recipe!!

Very good, but I have never tasted Boston Brown bread before so I have nothing to compare it to. I have no idea what this "bread in a can" is that so many people refered to. The whole family enjoyed it though, with no left overs.

Upon returning from a vacation in Ireland, I was determined to find a recipe for the "Brown Bread" that was served along with meals at most every pub and restaurant.  This is it!  Thanks so much for bringing back those memories!

will definately make again. My husband and kids loved it and it was so easy. Used treacle rather than molasses as I had to use it up. Pretty much the same thing though.

This bread was loved by our whole family, including my 9 month old! The only change I made was to use half and half white and whole wheat flour, but next time I'll try it exactly as written as I think the molasses will probably cover any bitter taste from the whole wheat flour. The loaf was moist right out of the oven, and got nice and chewy over the next couple of days. Will make this many times again!
