Very good.  I will make this again.  Instead of the pickle relish and prepared mustard, I substituted hot dog relish.

I always think I like Sauerkraut on hot dogs but then it always seems to disappoint; being kind of tart. Make no mistake, this recipe is still sauerkraut but dolled up some making it a little special and less like bitey than plain old sauerkraut. Oops I just realized I didn't rinse and drain the kraut. I wonder if it makes much of a difference. Sauerkraut doesn't usually have much liquid anyway. I used a good brand called "Bavarian style" that already had caraway seeeds in it so I only added 1/2 the caraway called for. Did everything else the same and it was very good. Takes the tart bite off the kraut. Gives it a little sytle. Easy to make especially if you just microwave it to heat.

This is DELICIOUS! I wanted to serve something different than just plain sauerkraut for our hot dogs and kielbasa, and I'm soooo glad I chose this recipe. I made this just as written and feel no changes are needed. It was super simple to prepare and the taste was fantastic! From now on, anytime I make any type of hot dogs/brats/kielbasa, this will be on the menu as well! Thanks for sharing. :)

What a great way to dress up regular sauerkraut! I served this on Seattle Cream Cheese Dogs from this site and it was so good. Didn't change a thing!

WOW!! I had my doubts this but man was it good. I mad a few changes. First change i used a small can of souerkraut then i used just a little less then 1/4 cup of relish. Only because that is whay i had. Then last but not least i used celery seed instead of caraway seed. Once again.. WOW!! We enjoyed this on our BBQ hot dogs.

This was good.  I cant say that I tried this plain.  But I have had this recipe in my recipe box for some time now and thought if I ever made sauerkraut that I would make this version.  We aren't much sauerkraut lovers but this recipe sure seemed to give the sauerkraut a good flavor.  I made this recipe for the kraut and added it all in the crockpot with the recipe on here called Slow Cooker Sauerkraut and Sausage.  Instead of the canned I used the bagged and rinsed it very well.  I ate mine on a hoagie bun slathered with cream cheese, topped with the kraut/sausage mixture and spicy mustard(Seattle Cream Cheese dogs on the site).  When I make kraut again, I will for sure use this recipe!  Even the hubby like it!  Thanks for the recipe!

A nice alternative to the usual mustard or ketchup.  This topping is kind of sweet, so be prepared for that.  My can of sauerkraut was only 14 oz though, so maybe just a little bit less relish or brown sugar would have been called for.  Don't leave out the carraway seeds if you have them -- they really make the relish!

I'm not a sauerkraut fan, but someone suggested this recipe and I am so glad they did. !! This is awesome and really makes a good topping to any hotdog especially the Seattle cream cheese dogs found on this site.  Even my young kids love it.

This was a pleasant surprise!  I did not think I would like sauerkraut on a hotdog but this was pretty tasty!  It doesn't have that strong sauerkraut-y flavor, maybe because it's rinsed and drained first.

We recently  had our fist day that it was nice enough to grill in Ohio.  Made this to put on bratwurst.  It was perfect!  Everyone loved it!  Perfect mix of sweet and tangy. Will definately be making again!

I've made this a couple of times now and it's easy and really good on grilled hot dogs.  It's much better than plain, tart sauerkraut. Got rave reviews from the family and I'll be making it a lot for summer cookouts.

My husband didn't like it at all, he thought it was too sweet & he doesn't like sweet relish(we're a dill relish kinda family). And "why can't I just make regular hot dogs with regular toppings?"(I made this the same night I also made "Seattle Cream Cheese Dogs" from AR:) I, however, DID like it but I do wonder if it would work w/dill?!

I added a little more caraway seeds (probably 1 tsp total) and it's marvelous.   I served this on top of habanero chicken sausages, but can imagine putting it on any "dog" and loving it.

Big hit with the family. My parents like original sauerkraut tart but husband doesn't. This satisfied both. Just the right amount of sweetness. Caraway seeds are great, don't leave them out! I just cut up some Hebrew Nationals in it and it was perfect meal, since we try to stay away from the bread.

Yum! This was surprisingly good. Even my fiance and parents agree. :) Tonight, I invited my parents over for dinner. My fiance grilled brats / Polish sausages and corn and I made potato salad to serve on the side. Not wanting to offer the "usual" condiments (i.e. mustard, onion, plain kraut, etc.), I searched for a homemade sauerkraut / slaw topping. After reading thru only one page of glowing reviews, I decided to give this a try - and am really glad I did! Other than my fiance commenting that he'd like to have tasted more of the sauerkraut flavor (i.e. too sweet), everyone enjoyed this. I would make this again if for nothing other than it being SOOOO easy to prepare and calling for ingredients I usually have on hand, but I will definitely decrease the amount of sugar next time around. Thanks for sharing, Erlerie! :-)

This topping is good hot or cold.  It's on the sweeter side and is great for those who like to put everything on their hot dog.  Sometimes I add onions to the mix.  I always cook it first to dissolve the sugar and then store in the refrigerator.

Mmmm! I put this on a veggie dog with some cream cheese...sooo good! I didn't heat it though, as I was in a hurry. I just ate it cold. Also, I didn't have any caraway seeds so I omitted those.

This was sooo very good. Even those that don't care for sauerkraut liked this one. I did add a few hearty dashes of tabasco, but that is just my personal preference.  However, I didnt use it on a hotdog.  We put it on open-faced broiled beef sandwiches.  Yummy

I was sick of ho-hum ketchup-and-mustard hot dogs so tried this with the Seattle Cream Cheese Dogs from this site, and LOVED it!!  The way the warm cream cheese compliments the sweet and sour flavor is fantastic.  Used a German brockwurst which is pretty mild; I'd bet this would be even better with a thick spicy sausage.  I did add just a tiny bit more brown sugar b/c I didn't think it was quite sweet enough, but then again I'm a sugar fiend :) And I used cumin instead of caraway seeds b/c I didn't have any.  It was wonderful, regardless.  TRY THIS!  You'll never go back.  Thank you so much!!

Ditto what Molle said!  We are kraut eaters but I would think if you had some that weren't, the sweetness in this mixture just might change their mind.  Thanks!

I make this every year for New Year's lunch, follow the recipe to the T. Having  hot dogs w/ kraut on New Year's Day is a family tradition going back several generations. I always hated sauerkraut ...not anymore! I actually look forward to serving this  and always get rave reviews from the family!

Amazing! Im a huge saurkraut fan but wanted something different that the plain old stuff. Highly recommend this! Sweet enough to take the sour bite away.

I didn't have any caraway seeds but it was still delicious! Served over grilled sausage in a hot dog bun!  Yum!

I used dill pickle relish, instead of sweet.  A big hit with the family. Will be making again when we have hot dogs!!

Pretty tasty and very easy to half for two-three servings.  I would use a little more brown sugar to bring up the sweet factor which would complement the saltiness of the hot dog meat.  I would definitely use this again if I were going to make Kraut Dogs

I love sauerkraut and wanted to try this on the Seattle Cream Cheese hot dog (found on this site) I was trying for the first time last night. This was great and I will use this on any hot dog I eat in the future.

I cut back on the brown sugar and caraway seeds. This was really good - a nice change from our usual grilled onions. Thanks!

Awesomely Good!!  My husband LOVED this – said it reminded him of something you could get at a sporting event or the state fair…and he isn’t big on sauerkraut. We had it on hot dog sized smoked sausage links...and wow, was it yummy!!

SOOO GOOOOD! and so EASY.  We heated some little smokies then mixed in the sauerkraut and ingredients..threw in just a little of my homemade chow chow...heated it and it was absolutely the best mix of flavors and textures. Husband and I both ate it straight from the bowl. Great in-a-pinch recipe.  Will definitely make again. Thanks!!!

Excellent what a nice change to a regular hot dog. Will use this again for sure. Also used the hot dog with cream cheese recipe as others did.

Fast and easy! I made this to go along with our hotdogs at a party. Everyone really enjoyed it. It's a wee bit too sweet for my taste, so next time I make it for myself I am going to cut back on the sugar a bit. Thank you for sharing this with us!!
