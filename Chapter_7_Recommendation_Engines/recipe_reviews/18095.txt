WONDERFUL!!!  These cinnamon rolls were very quick and easy, the only changes I had to make were to add more flour (about a cup and a half or two cups) to keep it from being so sticky, and I added some cinnamon to the dough and about 1/4 cup sugar because I noticed the recipe didn't call for any.  Also sugar helps the yeast proof faster.  Since we love cinnamon, I put more into the brown sugar mix than the recipe called for. Also, I put them in the refrigerator overnight and they rose some, but not as much as I wanted so I let them rise in a warm place (the closet) for an hour before I baked them.  The baking time was only 14 minutes for mine, and the cinnamon rolls were so perfect and golden and ENORMOUS!  This recipe made 18 enormous cinnamon rolls.  Seeing as it's only my mom and I, I'm going to give some to neighbors and friends.  I topped them with homemade cream cheese frosting, but I don't think they needed it because they were already so moist and soft and wonderful. I don't think they were cakey or biscuity at all. As good as Cinnabon, just a lot cheaper!  And if you crowd the pan a bit, the middles of the cinnamon rolls will come up just like Cinnabons.  A couple tips:  Warm the buttermilk over the lowest heat setting or it will start to curdle.  Also, once you have your cinnamon roll log, stretch it out a bit if you need to to make it all the same thickness.  And to cut them, get a piece of thread and put it around as much roll as you want to cut off, then pull the

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. It is by far the best and easiest cinnamon bun recipe out there. I follow the dough recipe to the T, then vary the fillings. Mini chocolate chips with toasted pecans and a butter/cinnamon/brown sugar mix was a huge hit at the inn I was pastry chef for; had people driving all the way from Maine to get them. Orange zest and walnuts with a raw sugar/butter filling is divine with a light orange zest infused sugar icing glaze at the end. Make them at night, refrigerate overnight and bake in the morning for something that tastes like you spent hours and hours on it. Oh, and a note. If you warm the buttermilk too much, it curdles, but doesn't wreck it. Just stir with a wisk and dump it into the mixer. No worries!

I followed this recipe exactly and well it came out horrible ! you need at least 8 cups of flour, I kept adding and the dough was so sticky. Then I couldn’t even cut in to it with out it still being so sticky,  I bake a lot so I do know what I am doing . Don’t waste your time on this recipe, or money. Finally I just stuck the big log on a cookie sheet and baked it, looks terrible. I promise you if you do this recipe you’ll be very up set ! just terrible ! I always read the reviews and well it seem like it was going to be great, if so many people loved this recipe why did mine come out so horrible !!!!!!!!  and a complete waste of time !!!! we looked at it and after this thing cooled off we tossed it in the trash :- (

Holy frijoles.....this makes a BIG cinnamon roll. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to work with this recipe. I proofed the yeast with the warm water and an additional quarter cup of sugar (personal choice, as I wanted a sweeter dough) for ten minutes, then added the buttermilk and a half cup of melted butter in place of the vegetable oil while alternating with the dry ingredients. I did not need much more than a couple extra tablespoons of flour. When I made the filling, I upped the cinnamon to two and a half teaspoons of cinnamon and a teaspoon and a half of nutmeg. Again, that's personal preferance. I found this dough very easy to work with, one of the easiest I have worked with. Rose beautifully, was easy to roll out and roll back up and cut. Really just GREAT dough. Honestly. These even baked up really well. And I really liked that the melted butter was mixed with the brown sugar and spices. It really made making these rolls a snap for me. I don't know why I never thought of that before. The only problem I had was not using a deep enough pan. When the filling oozed out of the rolls, it bled all over my oven causing a small fire. Not fun. BUT, that is my fault, not reflective of the recipe. This was the best cinnamon roll recipe I've worked with made even better by personal changes of my own. I plan on frosting them with a homemade cream cheese cinnamon roll icing. Watch the baking time, though. These cook fast and can burn if you aren't watching carefully.

Made night before Christmas to bake in morning.  Wow!  Wonderful recipe with wonderful results. Texture was terrific:  nice & chewy.  Reheated beautifully day after Christmas.  I made four changes.  (1) BREAD flour instead of all purpose.  Better texture because it has more protein, which is worked into tiny strands while  you're kneading, and overnight.  Yum. (2) Added 1/2 cup of white sugar to dry ingredients.  (3) My new jar of "Active Dry" yeast had expired, grrr, arg, so I used "Rapid Rise" packets instead.  Just followed the slightly different directions as given on packets, and dough came out perfectly. (4) No buttermilk, so I put 2 tablespoons white vinegar in milk.  Three comments.  (1) Several reviewers mentioned dough is very soft.  True; you need to work it carefully, but that's the nature of the beast.  Adding too much flour will mess up your texture.  Instead, keep things cold and work surface and pin lightly dusted with flour.  A little perforated-top flour shaker is great.  Kneading & resting are important steps, so don't skip them.  I measured bread flour by dipping cup into bag and leveling with knife -- and found recipe amount was spot on. (2) When applying filling, use stiff pastry or paint brush.  Go all the way to the short edges of your rectangle of dough, but DON'T apply mixture to very edges of the long ends.  Leave 'em bald so log seals better when you roll it up.  (3) Clean knife between every few cuts on log.

These cinnamon rolls are delicious.  They were very easy to make.  I let my bread machine do the mixing and kneading.  I had to add an extra 1/4-1/2 cup of flour, and I added about 1/2 teaspoon of extra cinnamon (I love cinnamon).  I also added raisins, and lightly frosted them with cream cheese frosting.  WOW!!!!!  I will definitely be making these again.

These cinnamon rolls are easy to make with my dough hook in my Kitchenaid Mixer - they are light and fluffy.  I make them into sticky buns by coating the bottom of the pan with molasses/pancake syrup/brown sugar - mixture of anything you would like.  Turn them out immediately upon removing from the oven and they are heavenly.  We have had raves about them.  Thanks for sharing this easy, easy recipe.

This recipe is easy and comes out great every time. I doubled it for Christmas morning breakfast and it was perfect. I add a glaze/frosting. The best part is, you can make them the night before and just stick them in the oven and 30 minutes later you have nice hot homemade cinnamon buns. Don't be scared by the long list of ingredients, it goes together perfectly and quickly.

We tried the recipe twice.  The rolls tasted more like biscuits with a hint of cinnamon.  The next day we added more cinnamon but they turned out kind of the same.  We ended up just adding in extra sugar and cinnamon and turned the recipe into cokkies.  I think I am going to stick with the Betty Crocker Cinnamon Roll Recipe.  Right on, to anyone that gets these rolls to come out right.  Send me a few so that I can try them! : )

I have made these cinnamon rolls several times and have had great success each time. They get rave reviews wherever I take them. I also use a cream cheese glaze, 8oz cream cheese, 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and a little milk. It's the perfect finishing touch.

This was the first time I have ever made cinnamon rolls, and I was very surprised at how easy they were.  I made them the night before and then cooked them in the morning to bring to work.  My co-workers were very impressed.  I would definitely make these again!  By the way, I made one batch with raisins and one with pecans, and both were outstanding.

These were wonderfull.  For everybody who had issues with it not having enough flour add 2 tablespoons of sugar in with the flour.  The sugar is food for the yeast and allows the yeast to expand and do its job.  When I did this it was easy to handle and they turned out delicious.

These are absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe to a tee except for letting it rise the first time for closer to an hour.  Like most others, I added a cream cheese frosting--adding a little to the very hot rolls and then letting it cool down to add the rest.    The dough is very easy to work with.  Very nice recipe!

Mine are in the oven right now so I don't know how they will taste but I can tell you one thing I would do different if I try this recipe again. I wouldn't melt the butter and mix it with the cinnamon and brown sugar. What a mess! 1/2 of it oozed out the side as I was rolling it up! I've made a lot of cinnamon rolls in the past (different recipe) and I just spread soft butter on the dough and sprinkled with cinnamon and brown sugar. Same result but a whole lot less messy.

These were excellent sticky rolls, but I wouldn't call them cinnamon rolls. I doubled the recommended amount of cinnamon, and the rolls still didn't taste cinnamon-y. That didn't keep them from being a huge success, though! They were large and had a nice texture. I suggest placing a sheet of parchment paper between the rolls and the pan to keep the filling from burning when it oozes out.

So yummy! It took me much longer than the estimated time, but was worth it in the end. We don't use buttermilk, so I made my own with 2% milk and cream of tartar - it worked like a charm!

I have been looking for a great cinnamon roll recipe for some time-I did NOT want a Cinnabon style recipe. This was fantastic! Fluffy, sweet and a gooey filling that made a wonderful caramelized bottom. My house still smells wonderful. I ate two of these hot and fresh from the oven! I did add 1/4 cup of sugar to the dough as suggested by another review and used rapid rise yeast.

These rolls are super easy to make and turned out beautifully. I prepared the dough in my Kitchenaid mixer and left it in the mixer bowl to rise before shaping in to rolls. Other reviewers suggested adding some sugar. I added about 1/3 cup white sugar to help out the yeast. Otherwise, no alterations are necessary. I tightly wrapped the leftovers in foil and they were tasty the next day.

I had some buttermilk to use up so I thought I would give this recipe a try. I wanted to like this recipe but I found the dough a little tough and my family just didn't seem to like them. With the Cinnabon recipe I can't keep them in the pan this one I had cinnamon rolls that had to be thrown away at the end of the week.

This was a wonderful recipe for cinnamon rolls. I heated the buttermilk, which I made with lemon juice and whole milk, and it did curdle a bit, but it wasn't bad, and certainly didn't affect the flavor! I found the amount of flour to be sufficient, and in fact, I dusted the dough with a little flour all around before I let it rest, and it rolled out beautifully. After I sliced the roll, I put them into two 9-inch cake pans instead of the 10x14 pan, and they were very chewy and soft! Delicious! Topped them with cream cheese icing, and my kids wouldn't stay away from them!!

Fabulous!  I had never made yeast cinnamon rolls before - the closest thing I ever came to was bisquick with butter spread on it and cinnamon/sugar sprinkled over it.  These are out of this world - the buttermilk definitely makes this recipe!  I did not change a thing.  As soon as they came out of the oven, I drizzled an almond flavored glaze over them.  I made these to share with my friend tomorrow, but I'm not sure any will be left!  Perfect.

This recipe turned out perfectly.  I added a quarter cup of sugar with the buttermilk and tripled the cinnamon, based on other revews.  The only thing I had trouble with was the baking time.  I baked them at 350 for ten minutes.  I didn't feel like making icing but I did add some leftover butterscotch chips.  Very nice!  I'm making more this weekend and I'm adding currants this time.  Once again, awesome recipe!

This recipe does not take 1/2 hour to prepare.  It takes about 1 hour, and you
should definately do it overnight because they cook better.  Definately recommend
making some sort of frosting otherwise they are kind of dry - I used cream cheese
frosting.  I also split it into two pans and made them over two days - that is how I 
know they are better if kept in the ref. overnight.  Good recipe though - would also 
be good with raisins in the dough.

Awesome!  This is definitely a five star recipe, but I made personal changes to make it a 10 star for us!  I added 1/4 cup of sugar and a tablespoon of cinnamon to the dough from another reviewers suggestion.  I cook at lot but am not an experienced baker - I was nervous to make them but they were SO EASY!  The one mistake I made was I melted the butter (it was in a stick in the fridge) and than mixed together the brown sugar and cinnamon with it, then spread it over the dough I had rolled out (about a 10x14 rectangle).  So when I went to roll it up...it squeezed the mixter out to the end of the roll and made a huge mess (my fault!).  I ended up having to scoop up the mixture that squeezed out and spooned it over the top.  Next time I will take the instructions from another cinnamon roll recipe on here and use a pastry brush to brush on the butter, then just sprinkle the brown sugar and cinnamon over it.  the idea to cut it with a string - genius!  I put it in two round cake pans, covered in fridge over night.  Took them out the next morning and let them sit for about an hour and then baked at 375 for 20 minutes.  Great New Years day breakfast!  Awesome!

These taste fine, but 400 degrees F was a big mistake. I didn't even leave them in the whole time; I checked them at 15 minutes, which was too late, because they were scorched. 
ALSO: After rolling up the cinnamon goo inside the dough, I would suggest cooling/freezing the dough before slicing it, to eliminate mess and keep as much cinnamon inside as possible.
The cinnamon can be easily doubled.

These were not bad straight out of the oven, but quickly went stale. I prefer a really soft, tender and 'chewy' cinnamon roll, one that still tastes fresh half a day later. These were more biscuit like overall. In addition, I found the topping to be too heavy on the sugar. Rather than staying syrupy and clinging to the rolls, it all hardened onto the bottom of the pan.

These are simple, amazingly fast and quite good.  I made one-third of a recipe and I got a half dozen rolls.  I substituted melted butter for the oil and added 1 T white sugar and 1/2 t vanilla to the dough. Flour amount was just right for me.  I did use a little more butter and brown sugar in the filling than one-third of the recipe called for...I am glad I did.

Although these were very easy to make and are good to eat, I would not call them gooey.  I got 19 rolls out of this recipe, so I may have rolled the dough a little larger, but I still think the next time I make them I will double the filling.  I will keep the dough recipe just for use as a basic yeast dough for goodies like this, as it is very easy and tastes good.  It also rises VERY fast.  I sat the rolls next to my stove while it preheated, to rise for 30 minutes, just like the recipe said, and they more than doubled.  

I only give it three stars because there needed to be an icing and the filling was not enough, too dry.  Fix that, and they'll be great!

These were delicious!  I did find that 4-1/2 cups of flour didn't seem like enough.  I did use an additional 1/2 cup or so, but I didn't want to spoil the recipe so I worked with it.  It was a little difficult to roll up, but the end result brought raving reviews by my husband & co-workers.  I followed an apple cider cinnamon roll recipe for the filling.  (Taste of Home Fall Baking pg 111).  All in all, the recipe will be making it into my next recipe book :)   Definitely a keeper!

This recipes lacks sugar in the dough to make the yeast work appropriately and the sugar and melted butter is the consistency of a liquid that does not spread on dough-it pours.  This recipes needs corrections!!

I really loved the rolls that came out, but I only have one addition to add.  I live in a high altitude state, and idk maybe it's the altitude but at 17 minutes the gooey mixture was burning and the rolls were definitely done.  I will try this again with a shorter cooking time, but they were still yummy, even nearly burned!

They tasted good but came out more like buicuits with cinnamon. They had a slighly crispy crust with a fluffy buiscuit like texture in the middle. The cinnamon spiral disappeared and it was like a taste of cinnamon. Tasted good but resembled a sugar cookie dough I make so it tasted more like a fluffy sugar cookie than the cinnamon roll I'm used to. Good but going to keep looking for another recipe.

These turned out perfectly. I followed the recipe as written but added an extra half cup of flour. I used my Kitchenaid to do the mixing and kneading. It worked perfectly. These were easy to roll and cut. I let them rise and then refrigerated them to bake first thing on Christmas morning and then smeared some homemade cream cheese frosting on top. Perfect!

These were very tasty!  I modified the recipe, which is why I give it 3 stars as written.  I added about 1/3 cup of sugar (white granulated) and a few generous shakes of cinnamon and a dash of ground cloves into the dough itself.  Without it, I can understand why some reviewers simply called them biscuits. I also added some icing on top (made of powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract), which really finished it off.  I had a really difficult time rolling the dough into a log.  It didn't really "roll", more like "folded".  And as it folded, it pushed all my gooey deliciousness out.  I don't know if it's just me (this is my first time making cinnamon rolls), so maybe I just need practice on that part?  But I was sad that a lot of my cinnamon sugar mixture simply oozed out when I was trying to roll it up. Because my roll was so flat, I also had to kind of fold them in half again as I put them on the pan.  Regardless, after rising, they still looked decent (I left them rise for over an hour) and in the end, they still tasted good (great, with the icing on top).  It only took about 15 minutes to cook, and even then I could have taken them out 1 or 2 minutes earlier. Will make again!

So delicious! The winter day I made these, my daughter and her friend were leaving for work just as they came out of the oven. I quickly iced them, wrapped some in foil and sent both off with a packet of hot rolls. They shared with their co-workers who wanted to know where they could get more, LOL!!

I followed the recipe exactly.i did not have to add any extra flour, those that did must have skipped a step or did not read the recipe completely before making. The rolls turned out bigger than expected, but were delicious.

What a beautiful dough this recipe makes. It smells so delicious, and it's compact, soft, very pliable. I prepared this exact recipe the first time and the rolls came out heavenly. The second time I substitured "Sugar in the Raw" for brown sugar and substituted 1/8 of the oil for 1 egg. The results are awesome!

I LOVE this recipe.  It is an easy dough but it tastes like you've been slaving all day!! You can make it in the evening and put it in the fridge overnight so it's ready to pop in the oven in the morning.  This is an AWESOME recipe!

OMYGOSH!!!!!  Tried this recipe yesterday and it is THE BEST recipe for cinnamon rolls that I have ever made!  And so easy!  My husband devoured 3 of them fresh out of the oven and when I offered one to my son-in-law, he told him he couldn't have any because he wanted them all!  The only thing different I did, was I added 1/2 c. sugar to the buttermilk while I was warming it and I added raisins before rolling them up and cutting them.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them.  They're so easy, a person could make a batch every evening if they wanted to!

This buttermilk cinnamon roll recipie is relatively simple.  I'm not sure why so many people added so much more flour!  I followed the recipie exactly, adding 4 1/2 cups of flour (stirring in one cup at a time), and it turned out perfect, slightly sticky, but that was fine!  I added more cinnamon like mentioned in another review.  These are good!

Prepared the Buttermilk Cinnamon rolls last night. Took them out of the refrigerator about an hour before I baked them. I followed the directions exactly. I did add a cream cheese frosting. I can't imagine how bland they would of been without it. The texture is biscuit like. I should of read more of the former reviews. I will not bake these again as cinnamon rolls but with some changes I think it might make a great dinner roll? Use butter, herbs & some cheeses with a nice garlic butter glaze. If you want a light melt in your mouth cinnamon roll, this isn't it.

This was my first time trying cinnamon rolls. So, other than doubling the cinnamon, I followed recipe exactly.. topped with powder sugar glaze. They were really good.  The dough itself was great and easy to work with, as for it needing extra flour, I put it on a bit more than lightly floured counter and let the kneading get it to the right amount.  The best trick I read in reviews was to slice them with thread, it made it so much easier without smashing them :D  But next time, I think I will partially melt the brown sugar with the butter, to spread easier, and be a bit less rich. Thank you for posting it, I will definitely make this again... next week :D

I love this recipe!  I added 1/4 cup sugar and 1 Tablespoon cinnamon to the flour mixture and then doubled the cinnamon in the filling too.   If you want to make ahead just drop the icing into was paper in small discs and then flash freeze.  Pu them in a baggie in the freezer and then next morning you can just take out and use!!  My family loves this recipe and I know you will too!

This recipe is amazing! I didn't need to change a thing. My husband is a loyal cinnabon 'eater' and he said he prefers this recipe. They are plenty sweet without any kind of frosting on top. The brown sugar gets yummy and crystalized on the bottom of the pan. I ashamed to say these didn't last more than 2 days in our home!!

Yum! I've made these a few times, and they're improved with a little extra sugar (around 1/3 cup). I also needed some more flour to get the right consistency of the dough.

AMAZING...Here are my changes...
Organic whole milk
1/2 cup butter in place of veg. oil
4 1/2 cups whole white wheat flour (same fiber as w.w.)
I added 1/2 cup evaporated cane juice to milk and butter mixture (I zapped in microwave instead of stove)
flowered counter a tad more than "lightly" when I kneaded
Lowered oven temp to 375 (20 mins was perfect)

These rolls were very easy to make, and they are delicious. They rose beautifully, and rose a bit more in the baking process. I did make a few changes.  First, I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the yeast to proof it (and because I do like a sweeter dough).  I also added 1/4 cup of sour cream to the buttermilk.  
I did not ice them--they do not need icing!  
If you are baking them in a 400 degree oven, do not leave them in for longer than 15 minutes, or they will burn.
Excellent recipe, thanks to Amy for sharing!

They were good.  Just not the over the top recipe I thought it was going to be.  I was expecting more of a flaky crust..it was more like bread.  Still a good flavor though.

WOW...these are fantastic.  I did use more butter and brown sugar/cinnamon than the recipe called for however.  The dough is so tender and flaky.  I made the dough in my stand mixer with dough hook and then let it rest about 20 minutes before rolling out.  I then let them rest/rise in the pan about 30 minutes before baking them.  They turned out fantastic.  Will definitely make them again!

I loved these! If you don't have buttermilk you can add about 2 tbs of vinegar to your milk. They need some sort of icing/frosting . (which I did add)

These were GOOOOOOOOD.
I made them on cookie sheets, so they would not stick together.

I also made a cream cheese glaze.
1/2 cup of butter
8 oz of cream cheese
2 cups of powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla

put glaze on as soon as they come out of the oven.
If you have anyleftovers, refridgerate them then heat them in the microwave for about 25sec, when reheating...
I will be makinf these every sunday for my boys.

This was my first attempt at making cinnamon rolls from scratch and they turned out fantastic!! The dough is just perfect - soft and just the right taste. My husband ate about 6 or them at one sitting!! I did double the amount of brown sugar and cinnamon, but not the butter. I thought it would be too runny - I will add a little more next time and plan to roll the dough a little flatter. The only problem that I had was that I only had one 9x13 pan clean and so I put the rest on a flat cookie sheet. They spread out quite a bit when they cooked and the filling ran over the side, but they still tasted good. Next time I will use two 9x13 pans!

Good -curious as to why there's oil in the batter (doesn't unsalted butter make more sense in a sweet yeast pastry?) and why baking soda in a yeast recipe?

Since I love cinnamon rolls and my husband is not the biggest fan of them (especially the cinnabons where he only sees the calories and not the taste) I had to find a good recipe that will convince him to enjoy these goodies every now and then. I read quiet a few reviews on here and also the "least positive" ones and really cannot understand how this recipe could have failed. The yeast dough measurements worked out very good, part of the last half cup I kneaded in when I worked the dough on the surface. I dissolved the yeast in the warm water and let it sit for about 10 minutes until nice and foamy and then added just a little bit of sugar. I take one star down because of the brown sugar mixture. It indeed was too liquidy and once I rolled up my buns I ended up with it leaking everywhere and when I cut it, it even made a bigger mess. It should be thicker, I think. What I did, since I had not poured all of it on there I used the left overs from the bowl and just spread it over the rolls in the pan. They baked out light and fluffy and the taste was really nice. I hope they freeze well, I did them last night and we ended up with 26 medium size rolls, so I baked the big dish last night and let them cool over night in the dish the smaller dish, I covered and put in the fridge over night and baked them this morning. Both worked out great. This will be my cinnamon roll recipe from now on!

These turned out pretty good. I think what was missing for me, though, is the caramel taste from the cinnamon sugar mixture. A few reviews mentioned adding 1/4 cup or so of white sugar to get that caramel taste, which I will do next time. I also wish the recipe was a little more specific in details, such as how big to roll out the dough and into how pieces should the roll be cut into (even if it says a serving for 15 up at the top). I kneaded the dough 20 times, but there were still clumps of flour in the dough (I should have mixed better in the bowl before turning the dough on the surface). After I let the dough rest for 15 minutes, the dough wasn't as sticky and was a lot easier to work with. I was also craving the frosting, so I topped it with marshmallow creme and it did the trick! UPDATE: These kept really well for days at room temperature. I had covered them tightly so they wouldn't dry out. They also heat up really well in the microwave (25-30 seconds). This is a pretty good recipe for being less than an hour to make. Will make again.

ok, i've made this twice now and I was pretty impressed the first time I made these buns but the 2nd time was even better!!!! I can't express how much I love this recipe. I make 8 huge cinnamon buns with this recipe and personally I think the only way you can screw this up is if your yeast is bad.  I used almost 4 1/2 cups of flour but it depends on the humidity where you live.  What I do is use 4 cups for sure and adjust from there, making sure the dough is soft, not sticky. The 2nd time I used a butter milk substitute (1 1/2 tablespoons of white vinegar in the 1 1/2 cups of milk) and I cut the baking soda to a 1/4 teaspoon as someone else suggested to omit it all together to avoid a biscuit texture, worked for me. I also left it to rise for 30 mins 1st rising give or take a few mins and for the 30 mins as the recipe called for the 2nd rising (makes for a softer bun). My family and I thank you so much for the recipe.

My family really enjoyed these ooey and gooey rolls. They were simple and easy to make. I made 2 batches and saved a batch in the refridgerater for the next morning. I did have a problem with the refridgerated batch not rising like the same day batch, but they still tasted good!These will definetly be made again!

This recipe is amazing~I made this Sunday evening and it's all gone by Wed. Very easy to make and taste great..I used white sugar instead of brown, next time I will get some brown sugar and try this again. I also used a cream cheese icing on it...yummy. Thanks for sharing....

Oh yum!  These cinnamon rolls are delicious.  I did find that I had to add quite a bit of extra flour but that could be because of the weather and the location (Santiago, Chile).  Will make these again!

Super Yummy! I made these with 100% whole wheat flour for a healthier treat. Increased cinnamon to 2 1/2 tsp, and would use a full tbsp next time. There will definitely be a next time.

After making these a couple of times, I decided to spread softened butter over the dough rectangle (instead of melting the butter) -- it was much less messy. The dough is very sticky, but if you can manage it, the result is a moister cinnamon roll. My rolls also didn't need as long a baking time as the recipe calls for. Delicious, and makes enough that I can freeze some for another morning.

We have made these twice now.  The first time we doubled the recipe and it was not nearly enough!  We made them to take to Sunday school with us (dad's class, mom's class and we took the rest to mine, college&career age) We made them again and tripled the recipe.  Both times we split the dough into 3 parts and made one regular, one we added 1/4 cup coco powder to the filling, and the third we added chopped apples to the filling.  We used a vanilla frosting on the regular and the apple, and then we made a chocolate frosting for the chocolate ones.  Our youth pastor asked twice if we would make them the second time! :) So we did.  We did have to leave them out of the fidge for 30-40 minutes to rise on saturday night then we baked them and fosted them sunday morning before church!

YUMMMM!! I am so excited about these! I have always used our family recipe. Which is good, but not restaurant good. I also loved that I could make them in the same day, not over night. I did modify a few things. I used half wheat, half white flour. I also cut more than HALF THE FAT by using applesauce instead of oil!! This is a new family favorite!

Oh.  My.  Gosh. These are AMAZING!  I put homemade cream cheese frosting on them about 30 minutes after they came out of the oven, and my husband, a big fan of Cinnabon, said that they're even better than Cinnabon!  I used 1 c bread flour along with 3-1/2 c AP flour, and I used the overnight method...I cannot go on enough about how absolutely fantastic these were...and I chuckle about the review that said it was awful...well, if you put in 8 c of flour, then of course it will be awful - the recipe calls for 4-1/2!

I thought this recipe was excellent. I used a bit more flour for rolling out but it was spot on. I added more cinnamon and butter just because I like them that way. The buttermilk added the perfect flavor to them. I will definitely use this recipe again. It was just like my grandmothers. I also made my cream cheese frosting and frosted them. Everyone loved them.

AMAZING! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added 1/4 c sugar and 1 t cinnamon to the dough. I also covered mine in a caramel glaze when they were done -- deeeeeelicious! This will definitely be my cinnamon roll recipe from now on!

Regretfully, I have to give 3 stars. Actually I had a big expectation on this recipe. And with all good review, I expected a light, moist rolls. But I have to agree with Gosselin that there was a biscuit taste in it. Maybe I have to omit the baking soda. I tried so hard to keep the fluor in 4,5c with so much liquid in it (I reduced the liquid a bit). A bit sticky, but I finally can manage not to add more fluor. That's why I expected a light roll. But what I got was quite far. Sorry..

Easy, fast, and delicious!  This was the first time I've made cinnamon rolls, and they turned out wonderfully!  I followed The Bunny Chef's suggestions of adding 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon to the dough.  Great recipe!

I've always wanted to make homemade cinnamon rolls, but never have until just now.  I made your recipe super late at night for my daughter's birthday breakfast in the morning.  These cinnamon rolls turned out BEAUTIFULLY!  I'm not Julia Child or anything, but I followed your recipe to the letter and they turned out GREAT!  Thumbs up from the whole family!!  Thank you for a recipe that I will cherish as my VERY FIRST homemade cinnamon rolls!  I look forward to making these again & again, and I just know that they'll be a family tradition now!  Thank you!!!

Great recipe.  As we have egg allergies in our family this was the perfect cinnamon roll recipe for us.  I put all ingredients in my breadmaker and set it on dough, then rolled it out and followed instructions from there.  I didn't have buttermilk so used milk with 2 T of lemon juice (let stand for 10min to curdle) and it came out fine.  Fluffy, sweet, soft rolls .... perfect. Be careful not to overcook though. Yummy.

What a fantastic recipe! I added raisens on top of the sugar/spice mix and refrigerated them overnight. By the time my oven had come up to the correct temp the rolls were ready to bake. Frosted them with a less sweet version of cream cheese frosting and chopped nuts. They are "to die for". Next time I may try dried cherries or craisens. Thanks for the recipe.

My first cinnamon rolls ever and I was pleased. They ate them so fast at work, it was amusing. I followed the recipe exactly and found an icing recipe on here with cream cheese,butter and powdered sugar & vanilla extract. Also, I refrigerated them overnight and didn't have time for them to get to "room temperature" so after 20 minutes or so on the counter I put them in the oven anyway. They were fine. Will make again, really easier that I had ever thought they would be.

WONDERFUL!  These are our new favorite back to school breakfast.  My boys loved these.  I used the cream cheese frosting recommendation, added 1/2 cup sugar to the buttermilk, and doubled the brown sugar and cinnamon in the filling. Thanks for all the helpful reviews. YUM!

I made these today and was so pleased with the outcome.  I live in a dry climate so didn’t need to add extra flour as some have suggested.  I made a simple icing with a bit of orange juice rather than the traditional cream cheese icing and they were such a hit. I’ve made a few cinnamon rolls in my time and these are by far one of the best. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Will definitely be making these again and again.

Sweet Pete, what can I say about these? These are THE most amazing cinnamon rolls my privileged taste buds have ever tasted! And trust me, I have tried many very good recipes. Everyone who got one went on and on about how wonderful they were, and I am quite sure I will never try any other recipe again :-) I added a cinnamon glaze, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly, and they were so soft and scrumptious! Thank you so much for this recipe!

This has a biscuit texture but is delicious. I glazed with milk, powder sugar, melted butter, and vanilla mixed together til it had a good consistency. I recommend using some white sugar with the brown - I used 2 parts white and 1 part brown.

I made a few changes to suit my taste.  Added sugar to the dough, about a 1/4 cup.  Also, I added vanilla to the filling but this recipe worked out like a dream.  I did not use a mixer.  Good ol' wooden spoon and a couple large bowls.  Bam.  Done!  They turned out fantastic!  Thanks for the tip regarding watching them while in the oven.  They do have a potential to burn.  Mine went for 24 minutes but I started checking them at 18 mins.

Wooow, followed this recipe, only extra thing done was added flour as I kneaded to keep dough from sticking to my fingers. Dough was so light and fluffy just surprisingly amazing!

I made this last night and set out this morning to rise and bake.  They turned out wonderful.  I did add the 1/4 c sugar and I substituted bread flour, as I prefer it for these recipes.   I didn't need any extra flour. I like more cinnamon like other people so I used 3 tbsp.  then we iced with homemade cream cheese frosting

Made this morning. Added extra 1/2 c flour. 1/4 c sugar. 2 tbsp cinnamon to dry mix. Added nuts and raisins to butte/sugar mixer. The dough is sticky but it is supposed to be and stiffens when kneaded into flour. Made a very solid cinnamon roll.

I've never made cinnamon rolls, and tried this recipe to get rid of some buttermilk.  I halved the recipe and all of the buns fit inside a standard round cake pan.  The only trouble I had was that I melted the butter in the microwave instead of cutting it into the cinnamon and sugar, and this made it a real pain to spread on the dough.  Also, I covered them with the cream cheese frosting from the mock Cinnabun recipe.  A family member of my husbands said it tasted just like those buns you get out of the vending machine.  I'm taking it as a compliment... Those cinnamon buns are dirty little secrets!

Followed the recipe but I warmed the buttermilk in the microwave for a 1-2 mins until it was warm (:The dough was sticky but if u just work in some flour and have plenty of flour on the counter and your rolling pin, u'll be fine (:

I usually make the Clone of a Cinnabon recipe but made this as I had buttermilk to use up.  This recipe reminds me of the Amish buns we once were able to get when I was little.  These are wonderful! Every other recipe I have made before this the dough kind of shrunk in the middle leaving the buns open.  These stayed nicely rolled and tight.  The flavor was delicious and the texture was moist and flaky.  This will be my go to for cinnamon buns from now on.

First of all this recipe is Great. The cinnamon rolls came out perfect. This was my first time working with yeast. The first batch I made I misread the instructions. When I decided to try again  I realized my mistake. I made two batches and took them to work. Everyone loved them and assumed I bought them. I will be making these often.

fantastic recipe.  my first time trying a recipe with yeast.. and it turned out wonderfully.
i added 1/4 cup sugar to the flour and 1/4 cup more flour when kneading to make it less sticky.  i used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk and i had no problems with the end product.
I let the dough rest after cutting it into pieces about 1 hr before baking.  managed to get 2 trays of rolls (tray size 8"x8").
the other tray which i left overnight in the fridge didn't rise well when baked like the one which i baked 1 after after resting it.  the rolls stayed soft till the next day.  i sprinkled chopped pecan before baking and  added cream cheese frosting on top when served them.

Used Half all purpose flour and half bread flour, also used 1/2 cup butter instead of veg oil added 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla to dough. Would add more cinnamon to brown sugar and butter mix next time, they were great but it was hard to taste the cinnamon.

This is a great recipe.  I made a few variations, though.  I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I had to put 1 1/2 cups milk and add in some vinegar, a great substitute for buttermilk.  Also, I used over 8 cups of flour for this recipe, and by the looks of it, you wouldn't be able to touch it with only 4 1/2 cups.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was great.

I only made half of this recipe and taste wise-it turned out awesome. "roll" wise-not so much. Having never worked with dough before I ran into some serious problems making the "log"-my dough was unbelievably sticky, warm, and loose. That being said, I recommend googling how to work with dough before getting to the rolling out and rolling up part. Next time I would let dough sit in cool pan with flour at bottom or straight up in the fridge for those 20-30 minutes. If your log is out of control--just stick the whole thing in the fridge and let it cool down before cutting out the rolls.
I doubled the cinnamon because I love it. 
I had to google how much water to use when "proofing the yeast." Apparently, the trick is dissolving the yeast (.25 oz) in 1/2 cup warm water and waiting for it to rise to the 1 cup level (if it doesnt rise it's not good yeast)--this will take upwards of 20 minutes! 
I also left these puppies in the fridge for 8 hours, and let them sit for 1 hour before baking-that 8 hours really makes a difference, the rolled dough will practically double in size.

I am a little disappointed with these rolls, they came out a little "bready" and on the dry side for me.  I also think they didn't have enough cinnamon in them.  I think I will try another recipe next time.  They looked beautiful though when I baked them, I only wished they tasted better.  Oh well! You never know until you try! :)

AMAZING!  So I like my cinnamon rolls covered in gooey, therefore I nearly doubled the mixture for the inside, and what was left I smeared over the tops before baking and WOW were they delicious!! Excellent recipe, thank you thank you thank you!  I'm off to my hubby's work to surprise him and his co-workers with some incentive to ditch their new years resolutions!

I made these..first time ever making bread from scratch...turned it beautifully!  I used my mixer with the dough hook, then let the dough rise (sat the bowl of dough on a shelf in my pantry) for about an hour before I rolled it out.  They are delicious! In the future I will even up the edges and make the roll tighter.  But not bad for a first try! Thanx for the recipe

Positively perfect cinnamon rolls!  Look and taste better than what you get in the mall.  Secret is to use a breadmaker on dough cycle to get perfectly risen dough- no need to add more flour- used recipe exactly just put all liquid ingredients in first (warmed the buttermilk before putting it in.)

These came out great!! This recipe is everything I've been searching for.  They're SO delicious, came out light and fluffy, don't require hours to rise, and didn't need eggs.  What more could I ask for.
OH - I did make 2 tiny changes though. I added 1 tablespoon of sugar to the yeast and water mixture at the beginning (to help the yeast proof), and I added more cinnamon to the sugar/butter filling.  These changes are minor and should not have a huge effect on the recipe itself :)

I already have a favorite recipe for cinnamon rolls but I had some buttermilk to use up and decide to try this one. I just ate 4 (small ones) fresh out of the oven ... they are quite good. The roll has a  delicate texture and seems perfect to me.  
It took an extra 1/2 c of flour to make the dough workable. I did add about 3 Tbs sugar to the yeast mixture, and I used 3 tsp cinnamon but I think that was too much. Instead of spreading melted butter, I just spread softened butter on the dough before sprinkling on the brown sugar; it's a little less messy that way.  I will certainly make these again. Oh, and I plan to freeze what we don't eat today, I find that homemade breads just don't keep well.

I added about 1/4 cup sugar to yeast mixture, this yielded a nice cinnamon roll, not a biscuit!

Overall, not a bad recipe, especially for a beginner.  The outside edges of the rolls were a bit stiff for me, and next time I will use much more cinnamon to really bring out the flavor. Still, they definately turned out more than edible: delicious!

These came out AMAZING! I added some basic vanilla glaze on top and they were perfect. They were pretty simple. The only thing is that was off was that they are going to take a bit longer than 55 min to make, inlcuding prep and baking. But otherwise recipe is good as it is. :)

Great recipe. I really enjoyed this recipe just the way it is. Next time I will take the advice of other members and place the rolls in a pans, sides touching, so that they rise in the middle.

I am not much of a baker, so I was not sure about this one, but it turned out great!  I read the review of The Bunny chef and it helped out alot.  I added about 1 1/2 cups flour and cinnamon and sugar to the flour mix.  I also added extra cinnamon to the brown sugar and butter mix (we love cinnamon).  I am super excited to share these cinnamon rolls with friends and family.  I decided to make this a snow day memory event for my kids and we also made our own butter milkand butter with whipping cream!! Enjoy!!

Good taste.  I added 1/4 cup sugar and more flour (1 to 1/2 cup) but it turned out like a biscuit with cinnamon on it.  I like fluffy cinnamon rolls that melt in your mouth, this was really filling!

EASY!  This dough was SO easy to work with.  I didn't have to add any additional flour.  I am only rating 4 stars because I felt the roll could have been more tender.  I didn't over work the dough so I am not sure why it wasn't as soft as I would have expected.  I used a cream cheese frosting and will make these again.

Wonderful.  I've been looking for a recipe that produces cinnamon rolls that are similar to the ones that were served at our local cafe many years ago.  This is really close!  And they were so easy!

Perfect! I feel vindicated - I have finally conquered yeast, thanks to this recipe.  The dough is soft and so easy to work with.  It baked up nicely, into a perfectly soft roll, with lots of brown sugar and cinnamon flavor.  Only change was to use two teaspoons of cinnamon.  I did make a glaze for these, but honestly I liked them better without it - they are perfect the way they are.  I like the idea of adding other spices, like nutmeg or a shake of ground cloves.  Thanks, Amy!

I let the cut rolls raise for 1 full hour the second time I made them  - much softer .  I also doubled the cinnamon like other reviewers suggested. Makes a full 15. Thwt freeze well after baked.

This recipe is fantastic! The buttermilk really makes for a nice soft, tender dough.  I made these for my family and they were gone within two days.  Will definitely be my go to recipe for cinnamon rolls from now on.

These cinnamon rolls are full of delicious yumminess. Very simple to put together, I sprinkled mini cinnamon chips to the inside before I rolled and sliced. They added that little extra cinnamon flavor and creamy texture to the center that my family likes.

Not sure why some people had so much trouble.  This is really an easy recipe and only requires that you keep adding flour until you get a nice texture to the dough.  I followed the advice of one reviewer, adding extra cinnamon and some sugar to the dough.  I also brushed melted butter on the dough after rolling it out, then sprinkled a mixture of 1/2 C sugar, 1 C dark brown sugar, 2 t. cinnamon and 1/2 C raisins on top then rolled the dough.  For a topping, I melted butter in the pan, sprinkled it with brown sugar, and placed the cut rolls on top (the rolled dough is easy to cut with an 18" piece of dental floss - just slide it underneath, bring both ends up together and cross them to cut through neatly).  Now if I can figure out a way to use this without the oil, I'll have a real keeper!

These rolls came out perfect for me. I think next time I will add a bit of cinnamon and sugar to the dough as others suggested. I made a cream cheese frosting for the top. Next time I may add a little orange zest and extract for an orange glazed version. Good stuff!

I agree with some other reviewers, the roll itself is bland, it's the filling that does the trick. I have tried other recipes of good cinnamon rolls, but I liked this one for the strong use of buttermilk in it, which is a novelty for me. So I'll keep this.

These are fantastically good. I've been using a different recipe from this site, but decided to try this one to use up some buttermilk and I'm so glad I did. They are perfectly tender, not too sweet, and the sugar/butter filling is perfect. The only thing I changed was to add 1/2 c. of sugar to the dough, since I think it makes a more tender roll. The best thing is they are wonderful the next day. They dont get hard or stale. And after a few seconds in the microwave, I swear they're actually better than fresh baked.   To the complaint about the flour amounts, it seemed spot on to me. Also, the person who said these came out like biscuits, I'm guessing your yeast was bad or your buttermilk was too warm when added and you killed the yeast. Watch your temperatures, they're important on this one.

Not bad for a quick recipe. Cooking time was waaay too long. 10 minutes max or they will be very brown and crunchy. We like chewy cinnamon buns. I did make icing for the top, really seemed too dry without. Will stick with 'clone of a cinnabon' recipe from this site. Thanks anyway.

Holy cow. These were sensational! What an easy recipe to follow, completely dummy-proof. I would recommend that you take the time do to this the night before, then let 'em rise overnight. 90 minutes does not include the time I took to make coffee, yawn a lot and explain to my boyfriend what yeast does. Plus, I made a batch of homemade cream cheese frosting and covered those suckers in creamy goodness. Anyway, here are my (only) change: Next time, I'm going to double the brown sugar mixture, and crumble it on top before I bake. I found that most of the goo melted to the bottom, and I like my roll to have it through-n-through. Otherwise, they were absolutely delicious. Thank you!

Easy recipe that turns out consistently good every time.  The only thing I did differently was let the dough rise to double after kneading and again after rolling and I used a little more brown sugar and much more cinnamon for my family's taste.

This is the easiest cinnamon roll recipe!  When I made these, I had never made any type of yeast bread in my life-and they still turned out perfect!  Like some of the other reviewers, I doubled the filling.  I cut the rolls with unwaxed dental floss as well.  I also used the overnight method and they turned out perfect the next morning!  They taste great with the Cinnamon Bun Icing recipe from this site.

We really didn't like this recipe, for a number of reasons.  I agree with another reviewer who said these taste like biscuits with a hint of cinnamon.  Thinking   ahead, I made sure the dough was fairly thin    so it wasn't overpowering the cinnamon.  The actual dough was quite good, but nowhere near what I had hoped.  I took some reviewers' advice and doubled the butter/cinnamon/sugar combo, but that made it incredibly gooey and messy to roll the log.  To others wanting to try this recipe, I suggest making two small rectangles as opposed to one - it can be very difficult to manoeuver.  Would have liked an icing recipe to accompany it.  Won't be making these again, though.

My family loved these.  I read the other reviews and doubled the filling. They were wonderful but I'm a goo freak.  I also made the cream cheese icing suggested but served it on the side for those who wanted it.  It is great icing.

These turned out delicious!  Thanks to the reviews, I made a couple of changes before I made these.  For one, I did increase the amount of filling, and that worked out very well.  For two, the cinnamon rolls are more attractive if you cook them on several cookie sheets -- about six at a time depending on the size of your cookie sheets.  If you cook them all at one time, in a baking dish, they stick together.

Omigosh!!!  This recipe was fabulous.  I made it the night before and they were ALL THAT.  It is a huge recipe and next time I will divide it into two smaller pans and try freezing one.  Every single roll was eaten -- the last one was eaten two days later, still absolutely delicious.  I think I will not use quite so much sugar the next time.  Actually, I think they would be wonderful with only half the sugar.  I am so glad that I have this recipe.  Thank you Amy.

I'm not lucky at working with yeast dough, so have kinda given up. But came across this recipe and made them and what an easy and quick  roll.
They were excellent. I've added this recipe to my collection and quite sure it will get used alot.
Thank you

Made just as recipe stated so this is an actual true rating. The closest I could get anyway because I did make one change and that was too cook them at 375° not 400°. I also halved the recipe but that doesn't alter the true recipe just the amounts of ingredients used.

I find so many rate recipes with 5 stars but make little to many changes to original recipe. That is not really an accurate rating. If you make a few small changes give it 4  stars. If you make a lot of changes give it 3 stars. 

That being said this is a wonderful recipe. The cinnamon rolls are soft and delicious. I chose to ice them with a cream cheese frosting I made.

This recipe is my definite go to for easy delicious cinnamon rolls!

Really delicious recipe! The dough, when you first mix wet and dry together, is sticky and takes some patience, but it works together brilliantly. The one additional step I took was to add a tablespoon of sugar to the doughs’ dry ingredients to feed the yeast a bit. Will absolutely use this recipe again!

Flavor of yeast cinnamon rolls. Not quite the same texture but quick to make.  Yum, family approved. Took a little over an hour all together and then bake, but I wasn’t in a particular hurry. Used kitchen aid to mix and kneed. Dough was easy to work with. I did use bread flour as someone suggested because I had some to use up.

Recipe was simple and came out great.  I added a little cinnamon to the dough, and I did not allow the rolls to rise a full 30 mins before baking because there were getting big, and they rose even bigger in the oven!  Good recipe though.  Would make again, and everyone at the family gathering I took them to liked them.

These are fluffy and soft and really easy to make! Ive seen people saying it takes a LOT of flour but if you knead I correctly it shouldn't stick
Also before you add the flour, first add three cups to the wet ingredients and beat it and the kneading will be mostly done and the flour will have absorbed the moisture by the time you add your rest of 1-1/2 cups of flour! Hope this helps!

Since it had been many years since I've made homemade cinnamon rolls (they've made those canned ones too easy!) I decided that I would do it again for old time's sake.  I had forgotten how long it takes!  I was unable to find an old recipe, so I tried this one, but was surprised there was no sugar in the recipe, nor was there any icing included.  I added a half cup of sugar and it still didn't seem very sweet, so if I do it again, I will probably do a little more.  Other than that, it rose well and everything else went fine.   I definitely would include sugar in the recipe, however.  I also don't bake as regularly as I did when I was not working, so I had to make my own buttermilk using white vinegar and whole milk, which was also fine for taste.  But this would never have been sweet enough had I not pulled a nice standard recipe for the finishing recipe at the end to put on some beautiful powdered sugar and cream cheese, buttery, vanilla icing on top of it.  After those changes, it definitely made it a lot more tasty.  It made 24 decent sized rolls in my 9X15 pan and my 8x8 pan and each one was a good 3" to 4" wide and about 1 1/2" high.  Good yield but more than it stated in the recipe.  One last thing, if you buy yeast by the jar instead of packets, you will have to use 4.5 teaspoons.

Wonderful recipe!  Like others suggested I changed the oil for butter because it's a personal preference.  I also used the "dough" setting on my bread machine to make an easy recipe even easier.  The dough came out perfectly, not sticky and did not need additional flour as others experienced.  Love mixing melted butter into the sugar/cinnamon mixture -- great tip!  I made these twice because while the dough was wonderful, the cook temp and time were off in my kitchen and the first batch came out over done -- crunchy and dry.  I lowered the temp to 350 and the time to 18 minutes and they are lovely!  Definitely silent auction worthy! Thanks for a great recipe.

Terrible. Baked for 20 minutes- tops looked great but bottoms were burnt. Obviously 400 degrees is too hot for the brown sugar!
Waste of time and money.

Made it for first time yesterday and was nervous as I have never used active yeast. Recipe was clear and easy to follow for novice.  The results were incredible - had family over for birthday brunch and said they were better than Cinnabon! Will make it again for sure!!
*NOTE: recipe doesn't include icing, so used a recipe from Allrecipes.com for frosting that worked really well. Make sure to grab ingredients for both when at the store (as I had to make a 2nd trip).

The dough and filling was wonderful. I added a small jar of pumpkin butter to the cinnamon sugar filling and baked a few extra minutes.  Next time I will try adding applesauce and walnuts to try to replicate the Harry & David cinnamon swirl bread/roll.

I made these at Christmastime a year ago and they were fantastic!  I added 1/4 cup sugar to the yeast mix, doubled the cinnamon (because I like it) and exchanged the oil for melted butter. They were so tender and delicious.  I recently made a different recipe (because I couldn't find this one at the time) and that recipe couldn't hold a candle to these.  I have printed it out for my recipe book and thrown all the rest away.  This is the best cinnamon roll ever!

I used a mixer with a dough hook, so did not knead.  I put a warm towel over to encourage it to rise due to cool house.

I would make them again.

Kids loved them!! And so did the adults!  made a simple icing to drizzle ontop, but i would suggest freezing the roll about 10 minutes prior to cutting rolls so they maintain shape better
Will make again for sure

Super delish! I didn't adjust the flour like most of the reviews said, although my cups might have been generous... I made extra filling and put it over the top instead of icing and it was greaaat. I let it sit out longer for the first few yeast rests, and entirely forgot the last one, but they turned out just fine! I also heated the buttermilk a wee bit much so it didn't quite look right.
Also turns out if you try to put extra filling in the middle it will spill out onto the counter, answering my lifelong question of "why is there never more cinnamon goop?"

So yummy. Light. Easy. I added raisins. And I made extra of the melted butter/sugar/cinnamon mixture and spread it on the bottom of the pan for extra gooeyness.

I followed the receipe exactly, nice and soft. 
I did use a different receipe to make cream cheese icing to put on top!
Delicious, definately will make again.

The dough turned out great, but the melted butter/cinnamon/brown sugar mix was way too loose.  When the rolls baked, all the cinnamon and sugar leaked out of the rolls and burnt on the pan.  The next time we make this, we will just spread room temperature butter on the dough and then sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.

I will definitely make this again.  The only change I made was that I used rapid rise yeast and I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar instead of all brown.  I also added a scattering of walnuts.  I made a vanilla cream cheese powered sugar icing to go on top using two cups powered sugar+2oz cream cheese+  2 TBLs butter+ 1tsp vanilla with enough milk to make it drizzable  :-)   It was a complete success and our 2018 Christmas morning lovin from the oven!

Wanted fresh cinnamon rolls and didn't want to spend have the morning making them. Found this recipe and thought to give it a try. Glad I did. Was quick and easy to make. Tasted delicious. Only change I would make is like some of the other review and add a little more flour. I added about an additional 3/4 cup.

Best recipe ever! So easy and I did agree with The Bunny Chef to add a quarter of a cup of sugar and some cinnamon to the flour mixture. Other than that the recipe worked perfectly! Definitely a keeper. We will be having cinnamon rolls through the holidays for sure.

You can definitely taste the buttermilk,  gives them a nice tangy taste.  Dough was very soft and fluffy, I let them rise overnight in the fridge and they cooked up nicely! 4 stars because I only give the BEST recipes 5 stars.

Very easy recipe. I added sugar to my yeast and water and also added a maple glass using powdered sugar,butter, sweetened condensed  milk and maple flavoring. The rolls came out great. I think I’ll make them with blueberry filling and a lemon glaze next time.

Delish! Added 1/2 cup white sugar to dry ingredients and increased cinnamon to 2-1/2 tsp; otherwise, assembled and cooked as written. (As always, it's important to hard-pack brown sugar when measuring.) Used plain dental floss to cut dough log into 20 1-inch pieces. Smeared cooked warm rolls with icing (blend to desired consistency a cube of butter with powdered sugar, vanilla, half & half).

This dish was delicious!!!!! The rolls didn't exactly turn out the shape I wanted it to, but it was still really good. It was just the right amount of sweet. I didn't add the frosting and I actually think it tastes better that way. I added 2 cups more flour than the recipe calls for and I think it tastes a lot better. You should definitely try this recipe, it was amazing.

Following the recipe these turn out fluffy and tall. I’ve made more than once. Now I follow other reviews and add 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 c sugar to the dry ingredients. I also sprinkle some sugar to the water /yeast mixture to feed the yeast. For the filling I do not use melted butter, softened butter better. I also knead for ten minutes. Pairs nicely with The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing.

I don’t know what some of the reviews are talking about.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not have sticky dough.  Ive never made homemade cinnamon rolls before and I bake a lot but these are excellent . I did add walnuts to the filling because I like them.  I also put vanilla butter glaze over the top. I really like these rolls because they are not overly sweet like so many I’ve eaten in the past. I recommend this recipe to everyone!

Loved it. Being a novice baker, I used our bread maker's dough setting because it's much easier and pretty much foolproof. I added an additional 1/4 cup of buttermilk, which I made using 1/2 & 1/2 and lemon juice, to replace the water. I sprinkled some chopped pecans on top of the cinnamon mixture before rolling, cutting and baking. Checked the first pan at 20 minutes, and they were overdone. Reduced that to 15 minutes afterwards which seemed to be about right. Delicious. Will definitely make these again.

I love this recipe! It is my go to for cinnamon rolls. I usually make it the night before and let it rise in the refrigerator. I like to top of mine with a simple glaze made of whisked powdered sugar, cream, and vanilla. I have found that using fresh buttermilk as opposed to dried and reconstituted buttermilk works much better.

you need waaaaaay more flour if you want a right proper dough-- which i didnt have. the recipe is fine, but if dont want your dough to be so sticky its unusable, then do yourself a favour and put in at least two 1/2 more cups of flour

I am going back and forth with the 4 or 5 star so I am really rating the dough more on this one.  I have been making cinnamon rolls for around 30 years  but I have pretty much always made the same modified recipe that we have adjusted to our liking.  My other recipe doesn't use buttermilk.  I made this recipe because I had to see (for some strange reason it sounded like a challenge) if it really required all that extra flour people were saying it needed and if it really was as bad as the 1 star ratings said it was.  I made it pretty close to what the recipe directed to do and I really like the dough a lot.  I like my dough a little sweeter than this one but I won't fault it for that.  This recipe is so easy to make it is almost fail proof.  I softened the yeast like it said to, I measured out the 4 1/2 cups of flour, baking soda and salt then mixed it in 1 cup at a time with the warmed butter milk, oil and yeast mixture.  The flour mixed in perfect so I don't understand the comments others have made about adding more flour.  I mixed together the butter, sugar, and cinnamon, spread it on top of the rectangle, cut it up with my dental floss, and it rose and baked great.  Light fluffy rolls with a little bit of crisp on the crust.  The only thing I would change about this recipe is I like a sticky bun version.  I usually heat up until the butter melts: 2 T corn syrup, 1/4 c butter, and 2/3 c packed brown sugar and put that in the bottom of the baking pans before I shape and cut

These were the best. We had our Christmas today due to work schedules. I try to make cinnamon rolls for Christmas breakfast- have tried different recipes- and this is by far the best. I made as written- I did not need any more flour, I made them the night before then put them in the fridge overnight. Then let rise this morning for an hour- turned my oven on for 2 minutes then turned it OFF for a warm rising spot. Baked at 375 so I wouldn't burn them for about 20-25 min. I put on a little bit of cream cheese frosting (though doesn't need this.) No filling oozing- except just the right amount in the bottom of the dish to scrape up-- light and flaky and a little moisty texture- 5 stars!!!!! The best! Had one with a cup of coffee then another with a glass of ice cold milk. Can't ask for more.

This is the most amazing thing I have ever tasted. Followed measurements exactly. Made a few minor adjustments for instant yeast vs active dry. 
The solution for the sticky consistency that one user experienced is leaving it in the mixer longer to form stronger gluten bonds.
One other note. If you steam bake at 350 for 20 minutes the texture is better than cinnabon.
Perfect, amazing, I'll soon be 400 lbs because of this. Don't even care.

These turned out great! I let my KitchenAid mixer do all of the work and my dough wasn't sticky at all as some of the other reviewers said theirs was. When I was warming the buttermilk, it started to curdle so I just used a whisk to stir it and it settled right down. The only changes I made was to add a tablespoon of white sugar to the water and yeast and 3 more tablespoons to the flour mixture. I also added an extra 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to the filling. The next time I make them I'm going to just soften the butter and spread it on the dough and then sprinkle with the brown sugar and cinnamon mixture. I had trouble getting the filling spread out to the edge of the dough.

These turned out great the FIRST time, when I covered and let rise 30 minutes before baking. 
My second attempt was covering and refrigerating overnight in  which the yeast did not activate or rise the dough, so I had small, un-puffy rolls.  Definitely let rise and do not refrigerate, or at least let warm up to room temp first.

My first attempt at homemade cinnamon rolls and my family was impressed and enjoyed them very much!  Directions were easy to follow. I used melted butter instead of vegetable oil and added 1 Tbsp sugar to the yeast and water mixture, but no other changes than those.  I mixed these by hand and baked them the same morning I made them, but next time, I want to use my stand mixer and try the night-before method to save time in the morning.    I also iced them with a cream cheese/butter icing recipe found on AR.  Delicious!!

I've been making these for a while and we love them.  I mix the dough in my bread machine. This recipe is great as written and also  easy to tweak. The house favorite is to add a hint of orange peel and juice or lemon peel and a dash of lemon extract in the rolls and a complimentary glaze on top.  I've also found that instead of mixing the filling and melted butter, I melt a half stick of butter and brush it over the dough, then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar and chopped nuts over that.  We've also added Craisins or chopped raw cranberries over the filling.  Have fun and experiment!

Made as written and they were fabulous! Very easy to make and didn't take long either. I did add a basic powdered sugar glaze while still warm. Yum. Will definitely make again, possibly adding chopped pecans.

Excellent. Not "easy" exactly, it's more work than I'd usually call easy, but it was super nice to be able to make them up the night before, throw them in the fridge, and then bake them off in the morning. I mostly followed the recipe as written, though I didn't trust the 1 tsp of salt and halved it--I'm glad I did, next time I'll use even a bit less. I suspect the amount of salt is part of why some reviewers felt these tasted like biscuits. I might add more cinnamon next time, because, I mean. The dough was a bit sticky but a light dusting of flour and some flour on my rolling pin took care of that. It kind of had to be fairly sticky or the rolls would have been stiff and hard, I think. I rolled the dough out on parchment paper and used that to help roll it up, no problems. I didn't have any difficulty with needing to add lots more flour, but I was quite comfortable working with a somewhat sticky dough. I mixed up some powdered sugar icing and put that on, the result was incredibly sweet. I will definitely be making these again.

I made them exactly as written using my KitchenAid mixer dough hook. I didn't need any extra flour and it was perfect, not sticky and very easy to roll out. I've never made yeast sweet rolls that also included baking soda so that must have something to do with the buttermilk? I split them into 2 pans and put one in the refrigerator for the morning. The flavor is great. Very sweet though so I wouldn't add any sugar to the dough! I wish I would have made more filling as I like gooey buns and there wasn't enough cinnamon. They were a little different texture than the usual and didn't get as fluffy but they still had a good flavor.  Super easy and fast. Thanks. It was fun to try something new.

So this is the second time I made these rolls. First time followed recipe exactly and it produced a lovely roll. Not disappointed.  This time was a bit more daring.   I wanted the filling to stay in the the roll without seeping in the roll. I also wanted a lighter sweeter roll.  I reduced the flour by a cup and worked the dough less. I also added 1/2 cup white sugar to the dough. Like alot of people I made buttermilk using viniger and milk  and let it set for about 10-15min after it was warmed. For the filling I added a pinch of nutmeg and a sprinkle of clove since it is Thanksgivin :-) also added 3/4 a tablespoon  of cornstarch to the mixture. The cornstarch kept the filling in place and gave it a perfect gooey texture. Beyond thrilled with the results. Served them warm with whipped cream and was in food heaven!

This was so simple even I could do it! LOL The dough came out perfect. I made a double batch, one with just the regular filling and the other with an apple filling. Both turned out beautifully. This is my new go-to recipe.

I just pulled these out of the oven and ate the first one. Oh man. I don't think I can ever go back to canned cinnamon rolls. Phenomenal. I followed the recipe to the T... ish. Had to use cream of tartar to make my whole milk buttermilk, and I added some sugar to the dough because I saw it in a previous review and thought why not? I actually halted the recipe, afraid to waste ingredients in the case that the rolls were no good. TIP: I used dental floss to cut the cinnamon rolls (wrapped the floss around the log and pulled). Worked perfectly.

I have made these rolls twice. Both worked perfectly per the recipe. I added a simple powdered sugar/milk/vanilla glaze as I prefer a bit of frosting. I used my Kitchen Aid with paddle then dough hook. Flour was perfect but perhaps by hand it doesn’t come together as well. I did not spread the filling to the last edge as in rolling the dough the filling spills out. Also, the time for prep is wrong as the rest/rise time is 45 minutes combined with additional time for mixing, rolling, and baking. Actual time closer to 1:45 total

These were delicious and so easy to make.  I did not have buttermilk in the house, so I substituted 2% milk (it's what I had), and 1-1/2 tablespoons of white vinegar, and they came out perfect!

These are the best cinnamon rolls I've made.  The only change I would make is to spread the butter and rub the cinnamon sugar into the dough.  I made a cream cheese frosting which made these nearly perfect.

Buttermilk flavor adds a nice touch. Easy to make these and boy howdy are they ever yum-licious! I have a habit of checking peoples' comments to work through any surprises when trying out new recipes, glad I did for this one. 

I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the yeast mixture and used the dough hook on my KitchenAid stand mixer. Also, when measuring the flour I thoroughly tapped the cup on the side of the container to settle it down before leveling it off. Did not have to add any flour at all, the dough was just the right consistency after rising. 

Spread softened (did not melt it) unsalted butter over the rolled out dough then sprinkled the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture over that, going right to the edge of the short sides and the inside long edge. 

I rolled it onto a barely floured cold granite surface, dough was really easy to handle.

I live at 6,000 ft. altitude but did not do any altitude adjustments. Rolls were fluffy and light.

Topped with a typical cream cheese frosting, but backed off on the powdered sugar for a little less-sweet version.

It worked well making it the night before and just baking it  in the morning.  My grandchildren loved it. I brushed the dough with melted butter like reviewers suggested but still a lot of the sugar mixture fell out.  Will try using very soft butter next time and serif that helps.

Made the dough exactly like the recipe.  Some people mentioned having to use more flour, but I didn't have to use it all.  The rolls came out very tender and light.  The only thing I would change is to add a little sugar to the dough (just  personal preference). Love that you can make these so quickly!  Put more cinnamon in the filling because I love it.  Didn't measure it, just poured it in and they were yummy. This will be my "go to" recipe from now on.

These are deadly. They just melt in your mouth. I am not good at baking pastries, so wondered if I would have bad luck. Early on my buttermilk curdled a bit and I worried it would ruin the texture or flavour. I followed the recipe exactly except that I don’t have a 10x15 baking dish so I also used a small loaf pan and ended up making 21 rolls. They are plenty sweet even without icing on top. The kids devoured these instantly. Thanks for the recipe!

I refrigerated these overnight - and suspect they need to come to room temp before baking in order to cook throughout.

I just took these out of the oven.  My wife ate two of them before I could glaze or take a picture of them.   HA.  They are outstanding.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did add a tablespoon of sugar to the yeast mixture to help with proofing.  I mixed everything in my Kitchen-aid with the dough hook no kneading.  Then let them rest.

Also I cooked down two cups of Granny Smith apples with some cinnamon and sugar until they were soft.  I lightly mashed them and spread a thin  layer of  that on top of the cinnamon and butter mix.  Then I rolled and cut.  I will definitely be making these again.

These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever made. They bake up so light and airy and you can unroll them and eat them bite by bite to get all of that cinnamon flavor. 
I put cream cheese icing on top of the batches I made and they were delicious! So give them a try, you won't be disappointed.
Thanks for sharing this recipe I enjoyed it immensely!

I was happy to find this recipe, as I am allergic to eggs, and this is one of the few well rated recipes that doesn't include them! I had to make one major change. My Hubby has to eat gluten free, so I used our favorite gluten free flour. With that change, I found that I actually had to add more liquid than the recipe called for, about an extra 1/2 cup  of the buttermilk. My cinnamon rolls didn't rise much, and I'm not sure if that is because of the different type of flour or not. I will add a bit of sugar to " proof " the yeast next time I make these. I did add butter cream frosting when done, however- these rolls are basically sitting in bubbly yummy brown sugar goodness when they come out of the oven. No frosting needed, they are so sweet and rich! I will make these again, and my Hubby is very pleased I have found a gluten free cinnamon roll that works for both of us!

I have to say this is a wonderful recipe. I have made this recipe every year for Christmas morning for four years ever since I discovered it and won my husband's heart with this amazing recipe. He raves about these cinnamon rolls to everyone he meets, and I offer to make some for the office, but he is loathe to share.. He brings cookies and other things that I make but not these.

I added an extra quarter cup of flour as per someone else's suggestion, but ended up having to compensate with adding more water as a result. PERFECT as is. Seriously, I was skeptical about this, but they are light and fluffy. I'm having a hard time not eating them all right now.

Excellent recipe for easy cinnamon rolls.  I needed to add an additional 1 1/2 cups of flour as mentioned in other reviews, and I doubled the cinnamon mixture.  These are big, soft and yummy!  I topped with a simple icing of confectionary sugar, cream and vanilla.  This recipe made enough for  6 rolls that I baked immediately after rising, and another 12 rolls that I put in the refrigerator to rise overnight.  Can't wait for morning!

These cinnamon rolls were delicious without being overpowering w/ sweetness.  I followed the recipes exactly, except that I added more cinnamon per my family's preferences and allowed the dough to rise for ~2-3 hours while I was working on other things.  The dough was light, fluffy and very easy to work with.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to combine softened butter with the brown sugar instead of melting it.  The softened butter mixture tends to spread more easily (for me) than when the butter's melted allowing for a more even coverage of the dough.  This will definitely be a staple around our home from here on.

These awesome!!! I was amazed by how easy it was to roll out the dough! It was literally the only cinnamon roll that when you heat it up it tastes as good as the first day you make it! I agree with Lexan  though when she says that the buttermilk curdles I was so scared that I messed it up but it made no difference. And I didn't have vegetable oil so I used olive oil which worked just fine. This is now my new favorite recipe!

Really liked this relatively-easy-to-make recipe.  I found it by googling "buttermilk [I had 2 cups  left over and was looking to use it] and yeast [left over from my Fastnacht beignets]."  Screwed up at least twice:  overheated the buttermilk, so it almost curdled; couldn't roll into a perfect rectangle, so cut and pasted dough.  Also, I left some lumps in the brown sugar, which was a brick until I pounded it in a plastic zip bag with a meat tenderizer.  Very apprehensive until they came out of the oven (20 minutes, plus 2 minutes after turning off the oven).  I immediately flipped them over--I had 20 of them, following the recipe precisely--so that the goo on their cookie sheet sides could better adhere and make them look less dry.  Next time I'll probably add 1/4 cup of sugar and maybe some raisins and chopped pecans.  P.S.  I'm a 75 year old male who likes to bake but isn't real talented with that hobby.

These were good and easy to make.  The only thing I will change next time is the temperature that I cook them.  400 was too hot.  The outside cooked faster than the inside and the sugar and butter mixture in the centre caramelized too much.  I cooked them for 20 minutes and the temperature of my oven is correct and even.  I'll try 380 next time.

I made it exactly as the recipe described. I did ice them with a powdered sugar glaze. They were delicious. Everyone loved them when I served them to my morning bridge group. I have been trying various cinnamon roll recipes. These were abosolutely the best and the easiest!

AMAZBALLS!!!!!
Holy cow these are the VERY BEST cinnamon rolls that I have ever made and I'm 47 so I've made a few rolls. The only thing that had me concerned for a minute was that they are so moist that if you eat them right out of the oven it almost seems like they may not be done. So I would say just make sure to let them cool. Also a really great thing is that the next day they are still moist and not dried out at all.
My husband said that there are better than "the mall ones"!!!
Thank you for taking the time to share such a great recipe. I'm fixin to make them again right now.

Excellent gooey cinnamon buns! Took suggestion of other reviewers and added 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon  to the dough but otherwise followed recipe  exactly as written. Dough was so easy to work with and I really liked that I could make these the night before and then bake them fresh in the morning.. Ten of us finished off the pan in no time. This will be  a regular at my house.

These cinnamon rolls came out really nice. I made the recipe as is, except for the following small changes: subbed 2 cups of whole wheat white flour for the AP flour, and replaced half of the brown sugar for white sugar. I refrigerated the rolls in the pan overnight and pulled them out about 45 minutes before baking. I baked them for about 23 minutes and they were pretty done (but still very gooey from all the butter). I topped them with the Basic Cream Cheese Frosting from this website (half batch). My workplace loved them!

Followed the directions and they came out very well.  I did feel like the dough could have used some extra flavor next time, cause there will be a next time, I might add come sugar, vanilla, or almond extract to the dough mixture.

These were good, but not great. They needed *something* ... and were better slathered with salted butter. I did drizzle them with an icing made with confectioner's sugar, milk, melted butter and a bit of brewed coffee and maple flavoring, plus a pinch of salt. That helped. Also, they stuck BADLY to the pan, even though it was greased. I highly recommend lining your pan with parchment paper!

This isn't my favorite cinnamon roll recipe, but it was pretty good.  I needed less flour than the recipe calls for.  I also raised the dough until double before rolling it out.  After I cut the rolls, I let them rise again.  I did bake mine at 400 degrees for 20 mins,  but this was too hot.  350 would have been much better.  I also iced my rolls.

I made these rolls twice within the last couple of days.  The first time I followed the recipe as called for with the exception of adding an additional 1/2 to 1 cup of flour as suggested by others.  I thought they were good although a bit heavy.  This last time I left the flour as the recipe stated, but from the last 1/2 cup of flour I left out about 1/4 cup of it  to knead the dough with, and it was perfect.  I also did use my Kitchen Aid mixer and dough hook, which worked very well.  The other tweaks to the recipe that I made were omitting the baking soda and I added 1/2 cup of sugar to the milk, oil and yeast mixture.  I prefer a bit sweeter dough for rolls and thought the first batch was a little blah in that respect.  I also agreed with other comments about mixing the brown sugar, cinnamon and melted butter together.  It was a mess as it squeezed out as I rolled up the dough.  This time I did it as I always did and spread the melted butter on the dough and then sprinkled the brown sugar and cinnamon on top.  It worked out so much better.  I did also decrease the amount of brown sugar to 3/4 c. and added 1/4 c. white sugar and mixed together with 1 tablespoon of cinnamon.  I let the dough rest about a half hour before rolling out, and an hour to raise before I baked them.

will definitely make it again.  The dough was easy to work with and fast for a yeast dough.  Nearly instant gratification!

So this is my second attempt at cinnamon rolls, and this turned out so much better then the first recipe I tried. I tried to follow the recipe to the letter. I didn't have a problem with sticky dough, in fact mine was the opposite.  Maybe because I live in a dry climate. I couldn't use all 4 1/2 cups of flour, so the last 3/4 of a cup went flour the board. My husband and I thought they turned out great and definitely will be making these again.

Yummy! I accidentally used bread flour. It was a great mistake. I did add perfect cinnamon roll icing from this site. Delicious!

These are perfection.   I am SUPER picky about cinnamon rolls.    The only switch I made was using the knead cycle on my bread machine .  Turned out STUNNING.

I made this recipe earlier this week. For some reason the dough would not rise. The taste was incredible but a little disappointed by the fact that they were small and did not rise.

I made these as the 'Cake' for a birthday breakfast. I loved how easy it was in the morning to bake and serve. I followed the directions perfectly and they came out moist on the inside, and slightly crunchy on the top. Not super gooey and messy, but just enough to make you lick your fingers after. And you DO want to lick your fingers. Easy directions, not a million dishes to wash after, and if made the night before a lovely way to wake up for family in the morning. I will be making these again, and I look forward to trying different styles of filling! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is my first attempt at making cinnamon rolls. The recipe was easy to follow and they came out great! I added a little sugar in the dough and more flour than the recipe called for. Overall I was pleased.

Tried this recipe based on positive reviews, but found them to be a flavorless mess. 4.5C was no where near enough flour. Added extra, 1/2C at a time and actually lost count at 6.5C. The dough never came together properly, but I continued with preparation anyway. The dough did rise nicely, but it was far too loose and practically impossible to work with. Melting the butter made it very easy to get it and the cinnamon/sugar on the dough, but the dough was too mushy to roll. Thankfully I rolled it out on a piece of floured plastic wrap and was able to use that to help me form the roll. The log would have been impossible to cut, so I covered and tossed it in the frig overnight hoping that would help firm it up enough to cut. Again, it rose nicely and I was finally able to cut the log into rolls. I baked them for 20 minutes - they browned nicely but over half of the filling bled out leaving a tasteless mess of a cinnamon roll. There was literally no flavor! I made a quick glaze with powdered sugar, a few drops of milk, and a dash of vanilla. My son was finally able to eat one once we glazed them, but they were just not good enough to justify the time involved. Followed instructions to the letter, with the exception of the flour, but this was just off. Won't be making these again. You'll be better off with the kind you pop from a can. If you do decide to try them, I highly recommend using softened butter NOT melted, in order to keep more of the filling inside the roll.

I've made these before and they turned out great! But this time the dough was too fluffy, I had the feeling I had used too much yeast (but used exactly the quantity it called for) Any ideas what might have gone wrong? I couldn't even form the rolls, they came undone and I don't think they'll come out right.

These are delicious.  I used my bread machine for the 1st 1/2 hour, took the dough out after 1/2 hour and spread it out, put the butter/sugar/cinnamon inside and then placed in pan, let rise 1/2 hour.  Quick and very good tasting.  I'll make these again for sure.

I was so happy to find an egg-free cinnamon roll recipe since my son has an egg allergy.  We loved them!  I didn't have buttermilk and used 1/2 c sour cream and 1 scant cup milk plus 1 tablespoon of vinegar as a substitute.  I made cinnamon roll frosting to go over them.  The only issue I had was that in one of the pans they stuck really badly but in the other pan they didn't stick at all.  I will grease the pan more heavily next time.  I used my kitchenaid for all mixing.  These are going to be a tradition for conference weekend!  I might add some chopped nuts next time.

Followed the dough recipe as written and had no problems with the amount of flour or dough consistency (as noted by some other reviewers).  For the filling I substituted applesauce and apple butter for about half of the butter, and I used at least twice as much cinnamon.  The resulting cinnamon rolls were good but not my favorite.

I have tried several cinnamon roll recipes. This one is a lot easier than others I have tried and tastes delicious~! I made a half recipe, which yielded eleven rolls,filling out my entire stoneware pizza pan.  I swapped out one cup of refined flour and used freshly ground whole wheat (white) flour. I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I used soured raw milk instead of buttermilk. My daughter made a glaze with powdered sugar and a splash of almond milk. I am definitely saving this to my recipe file to make again, especially when I have sour milk!

These are fabulous.  I usually make them and let them sit overnight.  As other reviewers suggested I cut the dough in half and spread softened butter on rolled out dough before sprinkling sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I can fill 2 9x13 pans full of cinnamon rolls with just 1 batch.

These are easy, and pretty good, but hubs whined they weren't gooey enough.  He loves cinnamon rolls that have tons of liquid, and these aren't quite it.  I thought they needed a tad more topping too, but the dough is good, so  a thought might be to make the dough with another topping.  Thanks for the recipe!

wont make these again not enough flavor especially after half my filling oozed out while rolling.  im definitely going back to my usual method of using softened butter and spreading it on the rolled out dough and sprinkling with sugar cinnamon ect i will never melt butter again. and ive never had cinnamon rolls stick to the pan and burn the way these do i ended up losing the bottom half of every roll. i tried it with a different dough heres the recipe 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast, 1/4 cup warm water (110° to 115°), 1-1/2 cups warm buttermilk (110° to 115°), 1/2 cup canola oil, 3 tablespoons sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 4-1/2 cups all-purpose flour. its mixed just the same but works better in my opinion and i used softened butter instead of melted much more flavorful and an improvement in cooking.

Next time I would spread softened, not melted, butter onto the rolled out dough and then sprinkle over the sugar and cinnamon in their dry form.  That way there isn't puddling on the bottom of the rolls while they wait to bake. Mother sugary puddles can brown/burn during baking.

Easy recipe to make. Followed the instructions and didn't make any changes. The dough wasn't sticky like some of the others have said. It came out perfect!

I like the recipe and am likely to to use it again.  I am not a baker so it took me longer than an hour to complete it. I think I'll add a bit more cinnamon the next time.

This was an easy recipe and turned out great.  I didn't change a thing.  I added a glaze at the end, but they really didn't need it.  Will definitely make again!

These are fast and easy to make,but I could tell by looking at the recipe that they would be dry. I added 2 eggs before adding the flour mixture and also used 2 tbsp. of cinnamon. They turned out good for a fast easy version,but it you want traditional yeasty moist rolls,I would go with a more complex recipe.

Used this for our Christmas breakfast. The only variation I made was to use half whole wheat and half white flour. It was great!

I usually have trouble with anything that involves yeast, but not for this recipie. I'm a beginner baker, and baking this is my biggest accomplishment! However, in terms of suggestions, I might add that it took me over an hour and a half to make this. Just make sure you schedule enough time.  Again, AMAZING! 10/10!

These rolls are very good. I mad them today. One problem with the recipe, at least if you use organic brown sugar, is that it doesn't work well to melt the butter and add to the sugar and cinammon. Better to just melt your butter, spread it over your dough and then put the sugar and cinnamon on it. Other than that they were fine and everyone loved them. I'll probably be making them again with that one change.

This is a fantastic and EASY recipe!  I was distracted by my two little helpers and forgot the oil, but they still turned out!  Also, I always try and substitute at least 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour, this works great in this recipe.  Can't wait to try these again with the oil and see how yummy they are! ;)

I followed the recipe exactly and was not impressed with the results.  They looked great, were super simple to make,  but the rolls had no real flavor, maybe because there was no sugar in it.  The only real flavor came from the filling.  It was like eating a regular dinner roll with some cinnamon butter smeared on it.  I will keep looking for a really good, light, sweet cinnamon roll.

Great Recipe! I also added 1/2 cup sugar to the dough and increased the amount of brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter.  I cut them, then placed them in a pan and placed them in the fridge and got them out the next morning and let them rise and baked for Christmas morning. Yum

These rolls were delicious. I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, and becouse I had no buttermilk I just put 3 squirts of lemon juice and it worked great.

So good! and SO EASY!!! The kids and family LOVED them. I followed the recipe. Can't say enough about how easy and how good they are. I made them in the evening, baked half for a snack that evening and refrigerated other half over night. Made the other half in the morning. Excellent!

Ive done this recipe several times. ABSOLUTLEY LOVE it. I do add about 1/2c sugar to help it proof faster I make it just the way the recipe calls otherwise,  and wow these rolls have won a few rewards for me and I shared with a local resturant and well its been pretty awesome. I always get lots of compliments on these rolls. A bonus you dont spend 4 hrs making them.I make the doagh and get it all prepared and freeze them. they thaw nicely to bake.

Made these this morning and they were great! As with some other reviewers, I ended up adding an extra 1/2 cup or so of flour to get the dough the right consistency, and I also added about a 1/2 cup of sugar to the dough just because. Also, instead of combining the butter/br. sugar/cinnamon, I spread melted butter on the rolled dough and sprinkled the other two on top. I added about a tsp. more cinnamon, but next time would probably add even more. I topped them off with a cream cheese frosting/glaze and only had to bake them about 18 minutes. Sooo good!!

I made a couple of modifications to the recipe but these are probably the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had!  I used powdered buttermilk instead and had to add more water; I used a bread machine for the initial mixing and rising - and ended up having to add a little more flour to get to the right texture - the dough was so soft - I could tell they were going to be great!  I ground up some pecans and added them to the cinnamon and sugar mix.  I also sprayed the baking pan with cooking spray and sprayed the top of the rolls with a mist of water a couple of times during cooking to keep them soft...  Yum!!!

I tried this recipe and LOVED it!!! This was my first attempt at cinnamon rolls and it was a hit! The only thing I ended up having to do was add about 4 - 5 tsps of flour to the batter to make it form a better dough ball but other than that I followed it to a 't'. They came out perfect and were soooo good! This goes down as a favorite and one I will make over and over again!

Tried this recipe out this morning and my family LOVED them!  The recipe is so easy to follow.  I did, however add quite a bit more cinnamon (at least 2tsp more), the amount in the recipe just wasn't enough for our taste.  I also made a simple glaze using powdered sugar, buttermilk and vanilla & orange extracts and just drizzled it over the top.     One change that I would make to this recipe is the method that the cinn/sug/butter is applied, & go back to a more traditional method.  Brush dough with soft butter, mix cinn/sug together and sprinkle over butter (also am going to try a 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar mixture).    Just a comment to the gal who needed 8cups of flour...you may bake 'all of the time' but you obviously did something wrong, because that much certainly isn't needed.  I would advise that you at least try the recipe one more time.

These cinnamon rolls were good, but I definitely should have made some type of icing to sweeten them up a bit, because, really, who wants a cinnamon roll without the frosting :)

These rolls are so awesome!  Keeping an eye on them in the oven is important, but is worth the effort.

These are great cinnamon rolls!  The dough was very easy to make and had a nice texture.  I did let my dough rise for about an hour an a half before putting them in the oven -- don't know if that made any difference.  I noticed that some other reviewers doubled the amount of cinnamon filling and had very gooey rolls.  I wanted just a little extra goo.  I increased the butter to 3/4 cup, the brown sugar to just shy of 2 cups, and the cinnamon to 2 tsp. and thought it turned out just about perfect.  I usually like a frosted roll, but these tasted great even without it.  I will definitely make again.

I followed this recipe to the EXACT measurements and this was fantastic!!!  I don't know what happened to the previous review as this was super easy with my kitchen aid mixer.  Topped this with a cream cheese glaze and... Oh My goodness!!  The kids devoured them-

I made these this morning and they turned out great!  I followed the recipe, except I increased the cinnamon/sugar mixture by about one third, and used turbinado sugar instead of brown sugar.  I only let them rise for 20 minutes before baking and they were still nice and fluffy.  I iced them with Brown Sugar Cream Cheese Frosting, also from this site, omitting the almond extratct in that recipe.  A excellent, quick rising yeast roll.  Thanks!

This recipe was good, but very sweet. My family likes our cinnamon rolls with frosting and put together with these rolls and they are a little too sweet. They were also not quite as doughy as we like them.

I used the overnight method for these rolls and was disappointed that even tho I let them come to room temperature before baking in the morning, they did not raise.  I am used to larger, fluffier rolls.  May try the bake right away method next time however the filling for these rolls was the best I've ever found.

This was the nicest dough I ever worked with.  Rolls were delish. We put cream cheese icing on them.  Thanks.

I made these this morning for my Sunday School class.  They did take longer than the time allowed but I think that was just me... I was afraid I made too much at first(I got 14 out of the mix) but I only had 2 rolls left.  Perfect! That in itselt is a huge compliment.  I did double the sugar and butter mixture.  Whatever was leftover, I drizzled on top before baking.  Next time I will try adding the sugar to the yeast as recommended.  I did borrow the glaze recipe from the Overnight Cinnamon Rolls I.  It was super simple and tasted great (I was in a big hurry this morning.) I will definitely do these again!!!

Yum,Yum. I added a little sugar to the buttermilk as someone suggested. Very good it made the dough a little sweeter. I also rolled the dough out as thin as I could and added the cinnamon mixture as I went along. If your use to canned cinnamon buns this recipe will make 2 small cans or one of the thick ones. The dough comes together really well. Use a fresh yeast package they have dates. I wouldn't change a thing with this one. It was great.

I tried this recipe on a whim one morning in which I had guests staying.  While it did not yield as many cinnamon rolls as I had read in other reviews, I wish it had!  They were so good and the guests raved about them all afternoon.  I increased the amount of filling--by just adding more brown sugar and cinnamon.  They were perfect without frosting.  They were my first attempt ever at making cinnamon rolls and I will not stray from this excellent recipe! In fact, I've allready given it to three people and I just made them last week!

This is a good recipe....The best way for me to describe it is "it taste like a McDonlads Cinnamon Nut Roll" a bit biscuity, but yeasty...very good would make again..just make sure you add a glaze on top...
