I always use 1 tbs cocoa, 2 tbs splenda, and a cup of milk. I then microwave it for about 1 minute, stir it, then mic it for about 45 sec. Sometimes I even add a 1/2 a tsp of vanilla extract to give it a little kick. I think it tastes great and I don't even feel guilty about drinking it.

My stomach doesn't handle sugar too well (or lactose for that matter), but I LOVE hot chocolate, and have been hard-pressed to give it up. This tastes like real hot chocolate to me! For one mug of skim lactose-free milk, I used 1 tbsp of Fry's cocoa and 3 packets (or 2 tbsp) of Splenda, and microwaved it, taking it out every 30 seconds to stir. Now I can drink all the hot chocolate I want! Ha!

Yum!  One would never know this was made with Splenda.  What a guilt-free treat!

I did like the other reviewer- instead I substituted for  1 cup silk vanilla soy milk and used one packet of splenda with baking coca ( food lion's)-high in fiver, less in carbs. Put the milk and cocoa in the microwave for 1 minute, stirred, then added splenda- can't  tell the difference from regular!!

This is really good when you're in the mood for a little chocolate, but want something that's not full of sugar.

i was looking for a low calorie hot chocolate that did not have the aftertaste of the diet instant hot chocolate packets. i didn't have high hopes but i thought i would give it a shot. it was wonderful. it was full of rich, chocolatey flavor, and if anything, it was a little too sweet, if that is possible, but all in all it was great...and my husband liked it too!!! :)

This was "ok" at best. I felt it had a very strong after taste. I had to doctor it up with a little bit of vanilla extract, a sprinkling of regular sugar, and extra milk. I probably won't be making it again. Thank you for sharing!
