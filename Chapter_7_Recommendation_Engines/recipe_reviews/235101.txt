This reminded me of a loaded fruit coffee cake of sorts because the batter yielded a more cake-like texture.  We liked this a lot, especially topped with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  I added cake spice in lieu of the cinnamon which gave the blueberries a warm spicy flavor.  Very easy and very good.

I've made this recipe two times this week.  The first time I simply replaced the plums with peaches, since that 's what I had.  The second time I used peaches. blackberries, blueberries and strawberries and the family DEVOURED it.  Not overly sweet, either.

We love sweets here and this was good and gone. I did top it with cool whip topping and raspberry syrup. Great with your coffee and tea.

The flavor of the berrries I used was not complemented by the cinnamon. I also doubled the recipe and it didn't turn out well.

I added 1 cup of chopped strawberries and 2 cups of blueberries. It was a hit! I served it with vanilla bean ice cream.
