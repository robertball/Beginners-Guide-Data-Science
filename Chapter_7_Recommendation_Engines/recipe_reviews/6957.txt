I followed this recipe to a T and discovered the dough was more like bread not muffin consistency. I added another 1/4 cup of milk, which helped a lot. And since I really like bananas I added two in the batter and cut up a third to fold in at the end. I also added a tsp of vanilla and cinnamon as the others recommended. With my additions the muffins turned out great!

I made these muffins for breakfast this morning, and they were great!  I think this is a great recipe with tons of potential for tweaking.  I made the following changes:  I added 1 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon, used 3 overripe bananas, substituted applesauce for the oil, and added an extra 1/8 C of milk (because the batter was very thick and dry).  At exactly 20 minutes in the oven these were awesome!  I will be making these again...soon!

This recipe was okay. The muffins looked nice, but the flavor was just not completely there. I even added the vanilla to the recipe. They are a quick solution for a breakfast or brunch though.

I am definitely not much of a baker, but I do find the energy to try sometimes.  These muffins were great and easy to make.  I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips and added pecans. I did find that they did not need to bake as long as the time allowed for.  This was my first recipie from allrecipies.com, and I am sure I will be using this site for a long time. :-)

This was really good. I just put all the ingredients in a bowl and mixed. I also added some vanilla extract and I doubled the chocolate chips.

Cooking at 400 made the tops get too crispy for me.  I am trying at 350 next time - don't know if that was a typo...

Best Homemade muffins I've ever baked. Mini chocolate chips spread the chocolate out for more in every bite.

VERY good muffins.   I used about two-and-a-half overripe bananas and doubled the chocolate chips.  Hubby gives BIG thumbs up.  I whipped them up in about half an hour.  He thinks I'm a genius.  Took less time to cook, maybe 17 minutes.  I used a toothpick to test.  Doubling the choco chips makes these ultra chocolatey.  I would have preferred less, but Hubs is in heaven.

I doubled this recipe but ended up having to almost triple the milk and oil because the batter resembled concrete, however they rose beautifully and were not too heavy.  The end result was delicious!

With a few tweaks, this is a very good muffin.  I followed the basic recipe but used brown sugar in place of half the granulated sugar.  Also, added a tsp of vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon.  I had two large, overripe bananas so probably used more than one cup mashed.  The recipe made exactly 12 perfectly sized muffins.  Bake time was only 18 minutes for me.  Moist, yummy, and sure to be a hit with the kids.  As a bonus, the muffins are quick to mix together.  Thanks!

The texture was weird. Even I added vanilla buti only taste flour rather than banana. I doubled the milk since the dough was too dry.

I added a little vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon.  They turned out pretty good. I baked them at 400 degrees as per the recipe.  
After about 18 minutes, they were quite brown and fully cooked.

I altered this recipe, which I used as my basic guideline.  I substituted wheat germ for some of the flour, and added some Benefiber to the mix as well.  The wheatgerm made them a little drier than I meant for them to be, so next time I will add a little more moisture.

Oops! I forgot to add the vanilla like the previos reviewers recomended. It's OK, I still thought that these muffins were yummy. They were a little hard to make though, because the batter was so thick. But the results were worth the extra effort.

These turned out great! The only changes I made were tripling the recipe, I used a full cup of whole milk and a large bag of mini chocolate chips.

My hubby and I prefer a lighter more cake like muffin. We were a little bummed that this one was so dry.  It was tasty and impressed our friends, but maybe a lighter muffin would be good.

This is a great recipe. I liked it because it required less sugar and oil. I did add a 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 5 tbsp of dessicated coconut powder and 1tbsp of vanilla essence.

Very tasty banana muffins - and lower fat too!  I didn't have enough banana to make 1 cup, so I added apple sauce to compensate, which obviously made the banana flavor very subtle, but that is no fault of the recipe.  Next time I will add the vanilla, though :)

Also, the reviewer that said the consistency of the dough is too thick for muffins, is absolutely wrong. Do NOT add more milk!  It'll only make your batter too thin to keep the chocolate chips spread throughout :)

UPDATE 8/9/2014 - I have used this recipe for a banana upside-down cake, but for this version, omitted the choc. chips and increased the milk to 1/2 cup for a more cakey consistency.  Vanilla is still a must, as well as just a dash of cinnamon, to increase the banana flavor.

didn't have enough baking powder so I used half baking soda and a 1/4 tsp cream of tartar. used 3 bananas, used a little more than 1/2 c chocolat, mixed 60% cocoa and milk chips. 
added the cinnamon and vanilla. and for the extra liquid I used 1/4 c. weak coffee. 

they turned out light fluffy and delicious. giving 3 stars because to be honest, what I made isn't really this recipe

Made these in a pinch for my son and his friends that slept over...  they gobbled them right up!  Simple ingredients, mixed up quickly, and baked up quickly... perfect for hungry impatient boys, lol...   *I added more banana and 1 tsp vanilla per other reviews.

This is soo easy and very tasty! I exchanged applesauce for the oil in equal parts and doubled the milk to try to decrease the fat a bit. My family has stopped eating bananas in the morning so by the weekend I have them to make muffins! lol

Simply delicious. I didn't even use vanilla as others had suggested to do. I did though use 1 1/3 cup chocolate chips instead of 1 cup and that was just the perfect amount. I would suggest taking them out before they get brown on the top, it leaves the inside nice and moist. Thank you for a great recipe!

They had an okay flavor, but not the best I've had.  I'd rather have made my banana bread recipe and just turned it into muffins.  Also, I needed to add extra banana mash to get all the dry ingredients to mix in.  Even without the extra banana, this definitely made more than the 12 muffins it claims.

Really great!  I used butter instead of oil because I often don't like the oily texture that goes with using oil.  They have a really great texture. I also finished mine with chocolate and Cinnamon.

Yummy muffin. 4 stars because I changed a few things based on other reviews. Added 1tsp vanilla and cinnamon. Used 1/2 cup of milk instead of 1/4. Used extra chocolate chips and banana. Next time I may add a little more vanilla but these came out really good and light.

I just made these, and they are great! I did add a little more milk, i think 2 tablespoons or so. They are moist and perfect fresh from the oven! I would recomend not using dak non-stick pans though. I think that is what caused bottoms to be tougher and to dark for my taste. But wow! What a muffin top.
Update- I forget to say I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.

These are really good!  I doubled the milk and chocolate chips, and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I think next time I may substitute applesauce for the oil just to lower the calories.  FYI WW:  6 point plus for each muffin as is.

As is, the batter didn't have enough liquid to combine, plus it just didn't have a ton of flavor. I added another 1/4 cup milk and some vanilla and they were much better.

These are great!  I have made them twice in 2 weeks.  My husband is always in a rush in the morning and doesn't have time for breakfast so he grabs one or two and eats them on the way way to work.  We are trying to lose weight  so I did some substitutions.  I used splenda instead of sugar.  And I used whole wheat flour.  They were still delicious.  Next time I might change out the chocolate for chopped pecans!  YUM!

This recipe was fantastic!  I didn't use extra milk or banana (as others have suggested) and they turned out perfectly moist and delicious.  I did substitute in oat flour (instead of flour) and sweetened carob (instead of chocolate chips), per personal preference.  I also liked someone else's idea of substituting in applesauce for oil -- I'll try that next time!  For now, these are a definite winner!  The versatility is half the fun!

Excellent, loved  these muffins!  I followed some of the other suggestions, and added additional banana, a little more milk, and cinnamon.  My 3 year old couldn't wait for them to cool down!  This is a winner, thank you.

These are really great muffins - moist and not at all crumbly.  They were a hit for snack at preschool!  I followed the previous recommendations regarding the milk and increased it to 1/2 cup.  The amount of banana worked out fine for our tastes, but I can see if you really want a lot of strong banana flavoring that you might want to add more bananas.  Also - I'm not sure if it was my oven, but they were done/brown in less than 20 minutes.

Love these! I used a little over 1/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  Think I'll maybe do 1/2 all purpose, 1/2 wpf next time.  I expected them to be dense because the batter was so thick, but they puffed up so nicely and looked beautiful.  Perfect consistency for a muffin. I used 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. May try to sub applesauce for oil next time for lower fat. I liked these better cool than warm.

I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 brown sugar in lieu of all white sugar.  Also added 2 tsp cinnamon and 2 tsp vanilla...  flavor was outstanding...   I am frustrated however....  only put them in for 18 minutes because 25 seems really long...   I also questioned 400 degrees, but left it...   they all burnt on the bottoms.   grrrrr

Not  what i think of when I think of muffins. Taste is fairly good but the texture is more like coffee cake then a muffin. If you make this be sure to have plenty of milk on hand to wash it down.

This is a terribly difficult recipe to rate.  As written, I believe it worthy of 3 stars.  I subbed buttermilk for the regular milk and added about one half extra 'dead' banana because I simply didn't want to throw it away and I also added one tsp. vanilla extract.  With those changes, the chocolate chips completely dominated the banana flavor.  The muffins weren't bad, but the title is completely deceiving and the bananas were a waste of money, time and trouble.  When I read several reviewers who stated that they added cinnamon to the batter as well, I liked the idea but just not in the muffin itself with everything else I *thought* would be going on--it seemed like one too many ingredients and a real hodge-podge of flavors.  Then it hit me!  I topped the muffins with the crumb topping from "Buttermilk Mango-Berry Crumb Cake" (also on this site) which, with it's addition of cinnamon, single-handedly turned this recipe around.  I filled the cupcake liners half full--which yielded 14 muffins rather than the original 12-- made a double batch of the crumb topping and added about a tablespoon and a half of the topping to each muffin.  They baked up beautifully at the same temperature and time setting as directed in the original muffin recipe.  I  had about a quarter of the crumb topping left, baked it on parchment paper right along with the muffins and am having dreamy visions of vanilla ice cream with cinnamon-y crumb topping!

My 2-year old daughter and I really enjoyed these!  The only change I made was one that I make with virtually every muffin/quick bread recipe I make, which is to use part whole grain instead of all white flour.  (I used 3/4 c. white flour, 1/4 c. oat bran, 1/4 c. wheat germ and 1/2 c. whole wheat pastry flour for those who are interested.)  The muffins were great warm and had a very nice texture later that day too.  I can't imagine why anyone would want more chocolate chips in these--they seemed very rich to me, especially for a muffin recipe.  They are more like a somewhat healthier alternative to chocolate chip cookies than a breakfast item.

I really felt something was missing in this recipe.  They didn't taste bad, just plain.  Perhaps if I make this recipe again I will add more chocolate chips, chopped walnuts & toasted coconut to the top.  I made these muffin using muffin cups, moved baking rack to the middle of the oven, and only baked them for 18 minutes (not the recommended 20 - 25 minutes).  Next time, I would cook them in even less time because these still turned out with darker bottoms which results in a "chewy" or "tough" texture.

These muffins were so delicious and moist!  I did add 1 tsp. vanilla and a few more choc. chips than the recipe stated.  Also, I used 1/4 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup white, because I was almost out of white.  Highly recommended!!

Delicious.  These muffins bake up high with golden brown tops; very appetizing.  I took these to a social gathering and they were consumed very quickly.  The batter did not look like it had enough chips, so I doubled the amount.

I'm giving this one star because it forced me to give at least one star! What a disappointment! I normally use the Best Banana Bread recipe for my muffins, but accidentally used this one instead. It was a mistake I won't make again! They looked exactly like the picture, so I'm positive I did everything correctly. But they were a weird texture, not very attractive looking, and not very flavorful. I hate to give such a harsh review. But, if you are like me, and want to have good results when you spend the time to make a recipe then I would suggest you move on. I have no idea how this recipe received such good reviews to begin with. Try The Best Banana Bread recipe, add chocolate chips, use muffin tins if you want. It will exceed your expectations.

This is a great recipe but I tweaked it a bit.  I wanted more of a cupcake-type muffin so I increased the sugar amount to 1 cup.  I then made a banana-cream cheese icing with a few chocolate chips.  I got a lot of compliments.  For the icing I used 8 ounces of cream cheese; 4 cups confectioners' sugar, 2 tbls milk and banana flavoring.

To make them perfect:
Double chips, milk, and sugar. Use half brown and half white sugar. Bake at 375 for 20 minutes.

These were amazing!

I'm glad I read some other reviews before making these.  I can't imagine the muffins being sweet enough without adding more sugar and chocolate chips!  I doubled the sugar (and used brown), doubled the chips and mashed banana and added 1/2 c. milk insead of 1/4 cup.
The muffins are delicious!  I can never find a banana recipe that has just the right consistency.  This one is it.
Thank you for a great "base" recipe!  My whole family loves this.

I used buttersctoch chips instead though banana chip would work great as well. Used half and half of brown sugar and pure cane. To me anything w/ banana just is not right w/ out the taste of brown sugar. Used Energy Egg replace instead of eggs as well which works just as good if not better than eggs. Sweet but not too much and perfect texture.

A simple basic recipe that is delicious. I read reviews before trying this recipe and it payed off.  I would also recommend what several other reviewers suggested... 1 cup Chocolate chips, 2 cups mashed bananas, brown sugar (instead of white), a bit more milk than the 1/4 cup and I added 1 tsp of cinnamon.

Pretty good, except they were a little 'tough'.  I wonder if I mixed the batter too much.  I'll definitely try again, they remind me of a banana chocolate chip muffin that Starbuck's used to carry.

I would've given 3 and a half for this recipe as is, but with some tweaking it is now my usual recipe for banana muffins. I too doubled the milk, put half white and half brown sugar and added some cinnamon, vanilla and a bit of banana extract. I also went to double the chocolate chips but didn't quite have enough so I also put some butterscotch chips in. Very yummy!

Loved this recipe!  After reading other reviews I added an extra 1/2 cup milk, 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I also used milk chocloate chips and substituted the vegetable oil for unsweetened applesauce(for a reduced fat version).  They were moist & delicious, I will definately make them again!

I made these last night and brought to work today.  The office loved them.  They are the best critics for sure.  Made exactly as written except added some cinammon. I hestitate to give 5 stars (can i give 4.5?)...there was an after taste of salt or baking powder , but that was my opinion not the opinion of my staff at work. Next time I will add a little vanilla and this will help. But so easy to make, have all the stuff on hand...will definately make again.

These turned out really good with a few adjustments. I added 1 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon, and I also upped the milk to 1/2 cup. I used mini chocolate chips, and double the amount to 1 cup. I used the 1 cup of mashed bananas, but next time I will probably do more. I cooked for 18 minutes, and they turned out great!!

These muffins are really dry.  One reviewer said they were like bread rolls--I agree.

I love this because it's easy and quick but I hate using oil in cooking so i used some unsweetened homemade apple sauce instead of oil. 1/4oil is about 2/4 apple sauce. I also cut the sugar in half and added a sprinkle of brown sugar on top before baking they will also cook faster took about 15min. hope someone enjoys this.. Way better snack for kids.

Scrumptious!  I needed a recipe to use up some old bananas that didn't call for baking soda, because I didn't have any.  This was perfect, easy, and so good!

My daughter and I agree this is the best muffin yet. We made a few changes: 1 tsp vanilla, 4 tsp dark chocolate cocoa and 3/4 c. mini chocochips. Baked for 20 min and 400, perfect.

I've made these a few times, the first as wriiten, and they just didn't have the flavor I wanted. I've been playing with this recipe and I have the perfect banana muffins my family loves. 2 cups flour, 1 T. baking powder, 1/2 t. salt, 1/2 cup shortening, 1 cup sugar (1/2 white 1/2 brown), 2 eggs, 1 1/2 cup mashed bananas, 1 t. lemon juice, and 1 cup chocolate chips (or 1 cup nuts). I do the directions the same but I bake at 375 degrees F for 25 minutes.

I've made this recipe for years and the family always enjoys them. To make them more like a muffin rather than a cupcake I cut back flour to 1 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup bran.  I also add vanilla and an extra handful of chocolate chips.  Don't bake them too long (20 mins is long enough) and be sure to lower the oven temp to 350.

I made these today and they turned out fabulous!!  I used bananas that were really soft and something I'd normally use in my banana bread recipe so they came out with a lot of flavor.  I took the advice from previous reviews and added a bit more milk, used olive oil, more chocolate chips (mini ones at that!) and a bit of vanilla for more flavoring and they came out just perfect.  I only baked them for 15 minutes, used the toothpick test and they were a little crunchy on the outside and very moist on the inside.  Looking forward to making these again!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!!

Good, low in oil and sugar, but the oven temp was too high - my muffins came out dark and even burned on the outside (400 degrees, 20 mins). Maybe I baked them too long?  I want them golden on the outside .  Will try again at a lower temp, and check them sooner.  I felt they were more bread than cake-like.

I made this recipe using a lot of the recommendations of others.  I used a half cup of sour cream as well as about 1/4 cup of milk to make them more moist.  I added extra banana, as well as about a teaspoon of cinnamon.  I added about a tablespoon of vanilla (I really like it) and 1/4 cup of butterscotch chips (I was skeptical but it actually added a great flavor).  I also added about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  I give everybody else's advice FIVE stars, but the actual recipe only FOUR since I suppose I didn't really make it.

These muffins are pretty good, except that they are very sticky and stick to the top of your mouth. Overall, these muffins are good, but not the best.

I just made these muffins, and they are yummy!  I doubled the recipe and got 12 regular sized muffins and 24 mini-muffins.  I also used 6 medium sized bananas, 1.5 cups of chocolate chips and a little more than one cup of sugar.

They are very moist, and tasy!  I found that they needed the full 25 minutes to cook for the full sized muffins and only 15 for the minis.

All 4 of my kids loved this, and that is saying alot! I followed some of the suggestions. I used a 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup white and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Turned out great. They even brought the leftovers to a friends so they would have them for a snack.

I added a little more than 1/4 cup applesauce and reduced oil to 1/4 cup.  Added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of cinammon, nutmeg, and cloves.  Also increased milk to 1/2.  Used a little bit more banana and walnuts instead of chocolate chip.  Done in 18 minutes and is quite moist and tasty.

These turned out great! I was a little confused as to why we would need 1 Tablespoon of baking powder so I just used 2 tsps and that worked out fine. Added the additional 1/4 cup milk and added 1 tsp of vanilla. Great recipe and quick to make.

These are very good muffins, however, I did add 1/4 cup more milk and I used frozen bananas which made the batter moist.  Very easy to make, great for kids. I would have given it 5 stars except that I had to change the recipe slightly.

These cooked really well and came out looking nice, however i would add more sugar next time since the 1 tbsp of baking powder made mine a bit bitter.  I put chocolate cream cheese icing on top so that sorted that out! Also added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter as suggested by others.

Did not like. Thought it would be great because of all the high reviews, but I agree with the other reviewer who said the texture was more like bread. Maybe it was because I used whole wheat flour, but I don't usually have that problem when making banana bread. Maybe this recipe just calls for too much flour. Anyway, I would not recommend this recipe.

These were pretty good- they weren't quite as cake-like as I expected, but they had a nice muffin texture.  I made mine in the giant muffin tins, and they cooked through in about 22 minutes.

Really amazing texture - light and fluffy.  I think you have to use really ripe bananas though to get a more intense banana flavor.

I really seem to be off my game with my baking lately. It's either me or my stupid oven. I can't figure it out. I followed this recipe exactly only adding 1/3 c. of pecans and a little more milk to compensate. I must have overmixed because they came out with high tops and twenty minutes was WAY too long for these to bake. I should have checked on them. I'll leave my recipe as is until I can try these again and have a more accurate baking time.

First time with this recipe, I do not have choc chip. So, I put almond instead. Others are same as indicated with 25 mins baking time. It turns out a bit burn and dry.

These are very good. I only had two ripe bananas and most of the other recipes I looked at needed three so I thought I'd try this one. After reading other reviews I decided to double to milk and choc chips and add some vanilla and cinnamon too. As well as a handfull of trail mix with dried cranberries. I just took them out of the oven and am trying one...  so yummy! Will make again.

Great recipe - I took a few of the reviewers suggestion to add vanilla and extra chocolate chipes.  Also had 1-1/2 cups mashed bananas (three small bananas).  That made them very moist.

The more bruised the banana's and over ripe the sweeter they will be hense less sugar having to be used. Also i prefer using SRFlour instead as they become more moist and less like a cupcake.

Very good. I alternated this recipe by putting 1/2 cup of mashed banana and 1/2 cup applesauce. They turned out delicious!

Not banana-y enough for me & a bit too cake-like.  I like my muffins a bit more moist & thick.  But my daughter liked them - she ate 3 in a row as soon as they cooled!

I think 1 tablespoon of baking powder is way too much. I could really taste it in the muffin. I will definitly make again but use less baking powder

After reading several reviews, the ingred. proportions seemed a bit off.  I probably shouldn't even review these, because I made so many changes...but, they ended up coming out really tasty.  These are the changes I made:  increased 2 c. flour, 1 c white sugar, decreased to 2t. baking powder, 1 c. choco chips, 1/2 veg. oil, 1/2 c. buttermilk (instead of milk) & the rest of the ingred. where the same.  Next time I may add 1 more egg.  Baked at 375 for only 15-17min.

I just got into baking, and this recipe was really easy to follow. To make them healthier, I used whole wheat flour and halved the amount of oil. I also added a tsp of vanilla extract and 2 tsp of cinnamon for taste. 20 minutes seemed too long for my muffins, so i baked them for exactly 18 minutes, and they came out slighty moist and delicious! My family loved them; they were gone the next day.

This is an awesome recipe! I did add a tablespoon of vanilla and I at least tripled the amount of chocolate chips. But it is very easy and pretty much fail proof. Don't over stir the batter as with any muffin. I recommend to anyone!

I am giving 4 stars for these as my 2nd batch came out delicious!  Taking the advice of previous reviewers, I upped the milk to 1/2 cup and added more choc chips and I used 2 very ripe bananas.  The timing is key: The 1st batch were regular muffins (I decreased the time to 20 minutes but they still turned out a bit dry.)  The 2nd batch were mini muffins and they cooked only 10 minutes...YUM!  Moist & delicious! I brought them to work and they were a hit! Thanks!

These are absolutely delicious.  Very easy to make.  I was a little afraid after reading some of the reviews but I had no problems.  I just used a regular muffin pan with paper liners.  I freeze these and take them to work in the AM.  A few seconds in the microwave and they're as good as from the oven.  Yummy!  This recipe only makes 9 muffins for me though, not 12.

The only change I made was doubling the amount of chocolate chip. The muffins came out really good. It has crumbly texture that  I really like. The best banana muffins recipe thus far. I highly recommend this recipe to everybody.

So very easy and delicious. I ran out of semisweet choc chips and used milk chocolate and peanut butter chips instead. They turned out beautiful and scrumptious!
The recipe actually yields more than a dozen muffins! ;)

Excellennt recipe!  I doubled the recipe, and the only thing I changed was that I added extra bananas.  I used 5 med-sized over-ripe bananas, and I believe being over-ripe (juicy!) is why my batter wasn't dry.

After making a few recommended changes to the recipe, my muffins turned out fabulously and were delicious. I doubled the milk to half a cup, and added about a teaspoon of vanilla and a few spices, like cinnamon. I will definitely be making this recipe again, but with the changes I used.

Good recipe.  Very dry however, I added probably another 1/4 cup of milk (maybe a little more) to get it wetter, and I took them out at 16 minutes instead of 20-25 and they turned out great.

Lovely little recipe!  So easy and so quick - and the perfect amount of batter for 12 decent sized muffins.  Kids loved them - even my 3 yr old that has food texture issues.  Of course - he'll eat almost anything with chocolate chips in it :)  I was out of applesauce this time - will try substituting with that instead of the oil next time.  Great recipe.

These were great!  I added 1/2 c. milk, 1/2 t. vanilla and a dash of cinnamon as others had suggested.  I also added 1/4 c. more choc. chips  I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil to cut some fat.  My kids love them!

This is my go-to recipe when I have bananas that get too ripe. My family and friends love them. They are great as regular or mini-sized muffins. I have found that they don't always need the full 20 minutes for the regular sized muffins to get done. I have even made them vegan successfully before and they went over really well. To make them vegan, I added an extra banana in place of the egg, used almond milk, and cut up 1/2 a cups worth of a vegan dark chocolate candy bar into pieces in place of the chocolate chips. Every time I make this recipe, it's delicious!

This is the best use for overripe bananas!  Mixes up quickly and makes exactly one dozen if I use my cupcake scoop. The first time I made these they had a strong baking powder flavor so I cut the baking powder in half and they still rose just fine. Also cut the baking time to 18 minutes or they will be overcooked. My family loves these and they are gone fast. Love that there's not much sugar in the recipe. They are moister the second day.

The first time I made these, they tasted bland. The second time I made them though, I made some slight modifications that made them wonderful.

Mods:

Add 1 tablespoon strong coffee.
Add 1 teaspoon vanilla.
Add 1 cup of chocolate chips.
Add 1 teaspoon cinnamon.

--This all brings out the natural banana and chocolate flavor of the muffins. (=

I made this recipe by the book and I thought they turned out nicely. I baked them for 20 minutes and was happy with them. However, they were a little plain. Next time I am definitely going to add the vanilla and cinnamon like so many have suggested!!

I made these today.  I doubled the recipe I made mini muffins baked them at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. The muffins came out perfect.  I doubled the chocolate chips I think next time I will follow the recipe closer next time.  Over all good muffins

These were good.  Next time I'll be sure to add the vanilla as others suggested and more chocolate chips and maybe even some walnuts.  However, my husband thought they were great made exactly to the recipe.

I added 1 teaspoon vanilla, a unmeasured sprinkle of cinnamon and 3/4 cups of mini chocolate chips. You can add to suit your taste.

Great base recipe! They are very cakey! I love them. I will be letting my kids try them for a snack today.

These were good. The only thing I did different was that I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar as well as the 1/2 cup of white sugar, added an extra banana and then I also added some coconut to the batter. Very tasty... my kids loved them!

I made some minor changes-added butter instead of oil and buttermilk instead of regular milk.  They turned out great!  Very moist and yummy.  These are my new favorite muffins.

Very good - nice and moist....the only thing I would change (and this is personal preference so I am still giving 5 stars), is more chocolate chips.  I also made mini muffins for my little ones.  They're enjoying fresh baked muffins as I type this!  Yum!  And the smell in my house is just delish!

This is a nice muffin.  I substituted 3/4 whole wheat flour for a portion of the all-purpose, used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar, 1 t. vanilla and 2 mashed bananas.  Baked in paper cups (made 10 in traditional sized muffin tin).  I have a convection oven, so baked at 350 convection for about 14 minutes (check these with a toothpick, and don't overbake).  My son, who initially said, "I don't want banana muffins" ate 2 immediately.  Terrific warm with a little butter smeared on.

I, too, found this recipe to be missing something. It didn't have that strong banana punch that I was hoping for and when cooked according to directions the tops fluffed beautifully but the bottoms were too dark and chewy. I did use dark bottom pans. I also found it to be a bit dry for my liking. I cooked it at 400 for 20 minutes.

Easyyyyyy and moist.  I like baking with as few dishes to clean up as possible. One measuring cup, one big bowl and one little bowl a spatula and a muffin tin-can't beat that.  The outcome was delish!

These muffins were o.k. They were best right out of the oven but after a day not that good. They were a little dry, maybe they need more oil. They had a nice banana flavor though.

The muffins were okay, but not very flavorful. (I also added vanilla.) The children seemed to enjoy them though, so I'll try it again with more additions. Maybe I'll add some cinnamon, nuts, and banana extract to bring out the banana taste.

I made these exactly as the recipe said and I didn't like the baking powder taste they had.  I double checked while I was making them and thought that 1 tbsp seemed a little much.  My hubby didn't mind them though.

Yummy - like other reviews I doubled the milk and bananas. To lower the sugar, instead of the white sugar I only added I tablespoon of brown sugar and 2/3 of the chocolate chips and added a couple of pinches of cinnamon. Also I made it gluten-free by substituting the flour w: 1/2 cup tapioca flour, 1/2 cup white rice flour, 1/4 cup sorghum flour, 1/4 cup corn starch. Make sure to spray the cups before pouring the batter.

Awesome recipe! Have made this twice now. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and doubled the chocolate chips to be 1 cup total. 3 bananas gave me about a cup. I didn't have any problems with the batter being too dry and thick, and they came out perfectly moist. Baked for 18 minutes

This recipe was good but I modified it a lot. I used 1/4 cup butter instead of oil and whole wheat flour instead of normal flour. I also used almond milk and two big bananas. It was moist enough and texture was more like a muffin! I will be making it more often!

This is one I'm definitely saving to use again. My only problem was between the temperature and time, they started to burn around 15 minutes. I would suggest lowering to 350 or 375 and keeping an eye on them. They didn't come out too dry though, despite being slightly burned. I think what may be causing this for other people is how you measure your flour. It's very important to not scoop it out with your measuring cup. This makes it compact, and results in more than you need. Instead, try spooning it into your measuring cup and level it off with the flat side of a knife or spatula. This will give you exactly the amount you need, and you won't need to add in any extra milk or whatever.

Pretty good, but needs tweaks. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, increased the chocolate chips to 1 cup, and ised 6 tablespoons of milk (instead of 1/4 c). I filled paper-lined cups about 2/3 way up (made 17 for me) and sprinkled the tops with brown sugar. I cooked at 375 instead of 400 and they only needed 17 minutes.

Extremely dry, crusty on top, and the bottoms burned after 5 minutes of baking. Very little flavor even with the addition of vanilla. Will not make again.

These muffins were declicious! They were moist and delicious. Instead of 1/2 cup of chocolate chips I added 1 whole cup, and it turned out perfectly. I didn't have enough vegetable oil and used some melted margarine instead. My entire family enjoyed them. What a  treat!

Very bland, dry, tasteless, even with extra chocolate chips.  Not worth the effort at all.

Okay taste, but very, very dry.  I took the muffins out at 17 minutes, so I surely didn't cook them too long. Wouldn't make this recipe again.

A little dry (maybe because I wasn't watching the oven enough, I don't know) but still a favorite indulgence. I added a few more chocolate chips, and vanilla which really adds flavor. ALSO... to add some more sweetness, I sprinkled white sugar on the tops of the muffins as they cooled for a nice glaze.

These muffins have a great flavor and texture. Best when hot. TIP: Don't use paper muffin liners. Recipe doesn't call for it, but i was trying to save time. They stuck to it like crazy! but still really good!

400 was too high of a temp, bottoms burnt quickly.  Too much flour not enough banana.  Don’t like using oil will use butter next time.  Tasted ok but I’ve made better  muffins. I also added peanut butter chips which added a bit better of taste.  Kids liked them somewhat but preferred my other recipes better.

Absolutely fabulous! I used 3 bananas, 3/4 cup of morsels, and added 1 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon.  Mine got a bit dark on the bottom so next time I will probably put the oven at 375

I doubled the recipe because I had lots of bananas. I substituted a half a cup of flour. So that would be a quarter cup of flour, if you're doing one recipe.
I used almond milk for the milk. I only used 3/4 cup of sugar for the doubled recipe, plus a couple tablespoons of honey.
I added about a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla. 

I loved the texture of the crunchy sweet outside with the cakey soft middle. So much yum.

Good basic muffin. Just plain tasting. I added some cinnamon to make it more flavorful. We have an egg allergy in the family so I had to substitute the egg for 2 tbsp of arrowroot powder and 3 tbsp water mixture  which might have added to the plain taste

I loved this recipe! It was easy to follow and turned out great. The only thing I changed was adding a teaspoon of vanilla for a little flavor and at the end, when you combined the wet and dry ingredients, I added a splash of milk so the batter wouldn’t be so dry. I would make this again!

Heated the milk and dissolved two tablespoons of coffee in it and also reduced the oil by half. Added few extra chips, too.  Put in 4 bananas which made about 1 1/2 cups mashed, too. They were addictive, definitely will make again!!!

I substituted 1/3 Cup honey for the sugar, reduced the milk slightly and added 1/4 tspn of baking soda. I also used ground almonds for half the flour.  I didn’t have enough bananas so I added some blueberries. This altered recipe is amazing (the original is wonderful too!).

I did add a splash more milk, but other than that, stuck to the recipe. These came together quickly, and baked up beautifully. I got exactly 12, nicely domed muffins, baked for 21 minutes. They didn't last long in our house! A little on the dry side, but still good none the less. Thanks for the recipe!

These were awesome!! Only problem is that the consistency was more like a dough so I added an extra 1/3cup of milk as well as adding an extra two bananas.

It's just okay. A little too dry. 20 minutes was too long at this temp. First batch came out over cooked. I'll be adding more banana and maybe a bit more milk next time to add a little more flavour and moisture.

I had some bananas I needed to use and wanted to make banana chocolate chip muffins, but didn't have much butter on hand. I was happy to find this recipe that didn't call for butter! Like other reviewers suggested, I added a splash more milk and a splash more oil, to keep them from turning out too dry. They turned out great! I'll make these again.

These muffins turned out great with a couple small alterations. The mix was a little dry so I added 1/3 cup of sour cream. I also added in some cinnamon. Baked them for only 20 minutes at 200 degrees Celsius and they were delicious!

Very tasty! I added some cinnamon to the batter and sprinkled brown sugar on top and they were perfect! I only had to cook mine for 18 minutes. I found the first batch was starting to burn on the bottom. Definitely will make again.

Great flavor and texture. Disclaimer, I did add vanilla and made slight adjustment in the steps. I used my stand mixer to mix the dry ingredients, then moved them to a bowl to use the mixer for the wet ingredients. I put the banana in, whisked the egg added that, then oil and milk and about 1 t vanilla. Then I added the dry back to the wet ingredients. Turned out perfect.

This is a great recipe.  My kids love these!  I had to bake them a for a little less time than stated (probably my oven was a little hotter than the original poster).  I used mini chocolate chips, because they don't sink to the bottom as quickly.  We make these a few times a year.  It's a definite 'go to' recipe in our house!

Substituted apple sauce for the oil. Mixed as directed but it was very thick as others said. I wound up adding in an extra 1/4c milk as someone recommended.

I used a minimuffin tin and baked for 14 minutes turned out fantastic and kids are already asking for more.

Very good, I followed what @MRSNESBITT3 added 
(additional 1/4 milk, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, total of 3 bananas)  and then I wanted more chocolate chips, so I used the entire 11oz, bag of chocolate chips. And I only baked them for 15 minutes. My weren't dry at all.

I made this with about a cup of mini chocolate chips, 1/2 cup of milk based on others' reviews of it being dry and 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of an egg since I had no eggs.  My family liked it however maybe too much chocolate.  I will try it at a lower temperature next time as the muffin bottom did get crispy which my kids didn't like.

I made this. I started to mix the dry with the wet ingredients. First, I noticed that the recipe was dry and almost like a dough. I didn't add any extra milk like others did. I put them into the oven and they ROSE A LOT. Next time I won't fill them as much. Also, I added some cinnamon sugar to the tops halfway through baking. Halfway through baking they were overflowing but still looked delish! These came out to be a yummy morning breakfast or a midnight snack!

These were very easy to make  but I did use coconut oil instead of veg oil (used about 1/3 cup), three perfectly overripe bananas that I put in the fridge a week ago just for this purpose, almost 1 cup of Nestle  semisweet choc chips and the rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  They are soooo good! Makes  a little over a dozen,  might use mini choc chips next time and do mini muffins just for fun :)

Followed the recipe and must say it was a bit of a let down.  ADD more bananas - these are bland and taste of nothing.  Previous review of cakey texture is accurate-not a moist muffin.

25 minutes is also way too long.  Check at 17 if you decide to make them

Yummy.  I tried to follow the recipe exactly but did have to add another splash of milk, I just eyeballed the amount. After reading other comments I see that was a common thing.  I used 4 very ripe bananas and a dash of cinnamon as well. 

These were dense and moist and my kids loved them.

My 9yo daughter made these with minimal assistance from me. Only change we made was to use gluten free flour (and xanthan gum) instead of all purpose. These came out perfect and our family that was visiting devoured them before I could get a picture!

These muffins are amazing! However, I feel that 20 minute cooking may be too long-maybe take them out after around 18 minutes. Also, the batter was very dry so I added a little more milk. Thanks for sharing this, I will be making it again!

This is a good, fairly basic recipe. I added a tbs of cinnamon, tsp of vanilla extract, and a 1/3 of walnuts, as it seemed like the muffins would be bland without them. When adding the liquids to the large bowl of dry ingredients, I noticed the batter was super thick. I had to add another 1/4 of milk to make it a more muffin-like consistency. I would recommend this recipe, if you make a few minor additions.

I sprinkle oats on top before placing in the oven. I had to make a double batch because I had 5 over-ripe bananas. I've tried almost every banana chocolate chip muffin recipe on here but this one is the family favorite!

First time was pretty good and easy.  Adding more banana, chips and something like vanilla extract is definitely a good idea. I substituted applesauce for the veggie oil and had to add an extra 1/8 cup milk because the batter was more cookie like than muffin like.  All in all not bad.

After reading the reviews, I did tweak the recipe a bit as below & it came out fantastic, all my officemate praised how good & moist they were.

Added 1 whole grated carrot, added 1/3 c. buttermilk instead of  1/4 c. milk, used 2 eggs instead of 1, used 1/3 c. vegetable oil instead of 1/4 c., added 1/4 c. ground flax seeds & added 1 tsp. cinnamon powder.

Try this revised recipe and you won't regret it!

My "cupcakes" did not look as pretty as the picture for these, and the taste was not exactly what I was hoping for. I do admit I've never quite been a fan of banana and chocolate together, and the actual muffin part is good, it's just not much different than what I'm used to, and the chocolate chips killed it for me

Though I had considered playing around with the recipe, I decided to try it as written first. They turned out wonderfully! However, if you are looking for something light and fluffy, I don't recommend this recipe. They are fairly dense, which I love. I added some extra chocolate chips (I don't consider that much of a change. :D) They were super easy to make, and cook quickly. I will be making these again.

I added just a tsp of cinnamon and tsp of vanilla - and they're a hit.  We put a few extra chips on top for fun, but I thought a 1/2 cup of chips was plenty.

These were so tasty! I used mini chocolate chips since that's all I had & I have an oven that runs hotter, so I cooked it at 375* for only 16 minutes & they were cooked perfectly & disappeared very quickly!

We misplaced our favorite recipe and tried this one. Very dry. We will increase the milk, banana, and oil next time. We, too, added vanilla. It was more like a sweetened biscuit than a soft, moist muffin. Very disappointing for a banana muffin -- normally very moist! The temperature is too high as well - should be about 350 F. I'm going with oil and milk up to 1/3 c each and adding another banana. This is not the best recipe -- if you are new to baking, this recipe as written is actually NOT a good recipe!

I made a few changes based on others reviews, and came out with addictive muffins! I used 3 overripe bananas, added a teaspoon of vanilla, used half whole wheat flour and probably 3/4 cups of chocolate chips. Nice and moist, so sweet! I will defiantly use again. My whole family could not get enough. I came out with 16 muffins.  Next time i think i will add walnuts if i have them, just to add a little crunch and maybe with the added protein, I could convince myself they are healthy and not feel so guilty about eating half the batch!

It was an okay recipe. Got me through in a pinch but definitely was a little odd compared to the normal banana chocolate chip muffins I enjoy. Not sure what it is... I even added an extra 1/2 cup of banana and the vanilla and it was still slightly odd.

made these today and they tasted great! substituted the flour with 1 cup sifted whole wheat and 1/2 cup all purpose flour, added 2 tablespoons water. I was afraid it would be really dry considering I was using the whole wheat flour thus I added water. Added vanilla extract too and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. A one bowl recipe with ingredients that are on hand, love it!

I agree with some of the reviewers who mentioned about adding vanilla extract and a little bit more milk, as I found the muffin turned out more cakey and slightly drier than what I like. I also omitted the sugar and added 1/2 cup of apple sauce and 2 tsp of sour cream, which seemed to help moisten it a bit. I had the oven turned to 350 not 400 and the muffins turned out nicely. Overall, this is an easy recipe, but needed more liquid than specified.

I made several subsitutions and thankfully these came out great! Way more airy than I would have thought. I subbed the white sugar for the same amount of brown. Doubled the milk, doubled the chocolate, used three bananas, and added maybe a teaspoon of vanilla. I also baked these at 375 for 20mins.

This is a great recipe but could do with a little adjustment.I read the reviews and decided to play with mine so as not to end up wasting ingredients. I used 1/2 cup yoghurt instead of milk because i prefer to use yoghurt or buttermilk in recipes in place of milk whenever i can. I am not very fond of cinnamon so i used nutmeg instead and also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla paste to the mashed bananas and yoghurt that i mixed together.Muffins turned out so delicious!i'll definitely make again!

Wow! I just made these and the family loves them:). After reading the other reviews I added a teaspoon of vanilla and an extra handful of chocolate chips.  Will be making these again.  Especially for a quick before school breakfast for kids!

My new favorite banana muffin recipe! I used 1 full teaspoon of cinnamon, a pinch of nutmeg and cloves to spice it up a little. I also used white chocolate chips, which I think made then taste better than with regular. Since I love huge muffins that rise up over the pan, I made this into 8 muffins instead of 12. Everyone who tried one loved these! Will definitely make again.
