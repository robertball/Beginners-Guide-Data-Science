Deeeelicious!  We love this style of sandwich, and this one did not disappoint!  We really liked how with this recipe, you put two-thirds the butter-onion mixture in the sandwich rather than all of the mixture on the top. To mince the onion, I just put it in my small chopper and let it do the work. The oven times were spot on for me.  Fifteen minutes covered and 7 minutes uncovered.  Thanks whizgee, for sharing your version of this popular sandwich.  It is a keeper.

I have made this several times with the exception, I  use dried minced onions and omit the poppy seeds. Also, I make ahead of time (at least 3 hours) and refrigerate. This allows the bread to absorb the butter which creates a caramelized bottom bun!!! Always a big hit!!!

I followed the recipe for the most part, but did not use onions or poppy seeds, and made just 4 sandwiches. I used black forest ham and substituted Swiss for Havarti cheese. My husband LOVED this recipe, and described it as "restaurant-quality". This recipe would be easy to make for a larger group, and would be excellent for tailgating or potlucks. This one is a definite winner - thank you!

Have made these soooo many times its ridiculous! It's an addiction I have created amongst family and friends. The only thing I do differently is use way less butter and used dried chopped onion and what really makes it is.....I use a peach or peach-mango preserve on the bottom bun for a sauce and once you heat it OMG....magical party in your mouth lol

Made it for lunch today.  I have a house filled with picky eaters and everyone ate at least one or more.  :)  Did make a few substitutions based on what we had on hand.  I used 1/2 tsp celery seed instead of poppy seeds, and onion powder rather than real onion.  Also, turkey and provolone rather than ham and swiss.  Okay, so I changed a lot since I didn't want to run to the store, but the recipe still turned out great!

I really enjoyed the flavor these sliders offered. It was quick and easy for me to make. Changes I made/will make next time. I added mayo to the bottom layer of bread, will put meat down before adding 2/3 of the butter mixture, I found by putting it directly on the bread it came out a bit soggy for my liking, and lastly I will reduce the amount of butter by just a tad.
Other than that fantastic recipe!

This was delicious.  I left it uncovered to get the bread crispier and the cheese melted better. I like to have fast and easy recipes on hand for busy nights and this one will be added to the list.

The only change I made was using reconstituted dried minced onion. These things are addictive! I've made these several times.  If you separate your rolls rather than leaving them hooked together they turn out better - at least mine did!  Don't skip the step of spreading some of the butter mixture on the rolls before piling on the ham and swiss! There is nothing healthy about these sandwiches so don't even go there.  Just enjoy!

Very good, but a little too much butter.  I used sesame seeds instead of the poppy seeds.  I, too, like the idea of putting the sauce inside the bread and on top too.  I used 2/3's of a loaf of french bread for the bread and they turned out very tasty, except for too much butter.  I'd make this again for sure!

These sandwiches are simply awesome and so easy to put together!  I live in Sweden, so I don't have access to "slider" buns, not to mention Hawaiian Sweet Bread.  So the change I made was to make them on whole wheat rolls -- "regular" size.  Which was also practical because I was serving them for dinner for our family of six.  Other than the bread, I made two of them with smoked ham for my husband and I.  Because our four teenage boys are refugees from Afghanistan and therefore Muslim, I used smoked deli turkey for their sandwiches.  These were a definite hit with everyone, including requests that I make them again!  I served them with a green salad and potato chips.

This may also be a good way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers.  my family always has leftover dinner rolls (dad uses brown and serve type), turkey or ham.  I am going to try a batch of leftover minis this year.  :)

So easy! I made this for a party and they were a hit! Great for leftovers too. My only substitution was to put both sliced ham and turkey on each slider.

This was a super easy recipe and a crowd pleaser!  I spooned all the sauce inside the sandwiches, which made them less messy to eat.

Yummmmmy! I followed all directions but made the following changes:
*didn't have poppy seeds
*used horseradish-mustard blend
*used all of the onion mix on bottom layer
*used leftover spiral spiced honey glazed ham and a lot of it.
*didn't have Swiss, so topped ham with shredded cheddar
*brushed tops of rolls with melted butter and brown sugar

Family loved it! Will definitely make again.

made these tonight but unfortunately I didn't have all the ingredients. I just left out the mustard and whorsteshire sauce. I added onion flakes and they added a big flavor boost. The whole family loved them and I will make again for sure.

Was a huge hit at my family reunion! I made a large lasagna pan of 24 little sliders and it was gone in minutes, so make more than you think you need! Couldn't find King's Hawaiian rolls (maybe not sold in Canada?) so used flaky pull-apart type biscuit rolls and they turned out great. Since I had 24 sandwiches instead of the recipe's 12, but wasn't sure if the size of my rolls were smaller than the King's rolls, I split the difference and increased the sauce ingredients (except onion and Worcestershire sauce) and ham by about 50 percent, and the amount was just right. Just used enough sliced Swiss cheese to cover (12-14 slices). The only things I added were a bit of mayo on the bottom buns under the sauce, and some parsley for colour. You can't really go wrong with these little guys.

These were very good, although we all thought there was too much onion.  I would omit the onion next time.  I don't really think of onion going with/on ham dishes anyway : )

Delicious! My 3-year-old (who is a very picky eater) asks for these at least 3 times a week! He calls them "baby sandwiches". My fiance also gets really excited when he finds out I am making them!

YUM!  These are easy and delicious, perfect for football-watching and especially popular with guys.  Like others, I cut down on the butter a bit (when I doubled the recipe I only used 1 stick and another 6 TBSP of butter).  Covering for the first few minutes is a must.

Easy and delicious. I did cut back slightly on the butter, and used dry mustard as I had no Dijon. I aimed for a half recipe but ended up using 8 rolls. Will definitely make again.

We absolutely loved these little sandwiches.  The only thing different I did was to add more horseradish sauce as we love horseradish.  We had leftovers the next day and ate them cold right out of the refrigerator.  They are excellent cold.  I had a few left, as it is just the two of us, and put them in the freezer.  I am hoping they will taste great when we are ready to eat them.  Highly recommend trying them.  You won’t be disappointed!

Oh that is so good. Left out the poppy seeds. Also works well with honey wheat rolls from the same brand. We used left over Christmas ham and Swiss, but will most definately make this again with deli Virginia ham or Beechwood smoked ham in the future

i used SaraLee Hawaiian rolls, they are too doughy, next time I will hunt for the real rolls. I also added garlic for extra flavor and used honey dijon mustard since I already had that on hand. Very good!!

We love these!  Sometimes I’ll add a little brown sugar and fresh minced garlic to the butter mixture.  We always make them with different meats and cheeses for variety.  Turkey and Swiss, roast beef and cheddar or provolone, ham and American, etc. these are also so very good cold!  Spousal unit likes taking them for lunch and the littles like them cold as well.  Going on a road trip in a few weeks and I plan on making a big batch to take along for a 16 hour two day drive along with cold salads, chips, etc.   the Hawaiian sweet rolls are a must!  If not, a good potato dinner roll will work but the sweet rolls give it that extra pop. Also can be reheated in air fryer 350 for about 3-5 minutes.   These are really good if you let them sit with the butter sauces in fridge for 1-24 hours before baking.

Decent. However, do not save and reheat leftovers. Something caramelized when I did that and turned into a disgustingly sweet flavor, as though it was full of brown sugar, which put me off so much I thought I might vomit. Kind of ruined me on making these ever again.

These were great! I've made a variation of these using a different ratio of ingredients for the butter/mustard mix, but this was my favorite. Perfect for a potluck and they were all gone! I always make some extra for us to have at home as they are good warmed up for lunch. The only thing I did differently was to follow someone else's suggestion of putting some of the sauce on the buns and some on top. Keeping this recipe and will definitely make this again!

I saw this recipe and wanted to make.  I stood in front of the fridge to see what we had...only reason I made changes.  I had/used deli sliced roast with beef.  Sauté onions until soft...mixed sweet/spicy mustard, Worcester sauce and mayo...added to onions and stirred together for couple minutes.   3/4 of this was added to bottom buns, topped with meat, Swiss cheese (shredded), added top bun. Left a small portion of mustard mixture to add on top bun with sprinkle of more cheese.  It was very very good.

Made these for my book club group last night and they were a real hit!  I doubled the recipe and made 8 in an 8' x 8' pan with Turkey and Provolone Cheese and 16 in a 9' x 13' pan with Ham and Swiss Cheese.  Think that I liked the ham better, but they were both wonderful!  I put them together in the morning, covered with foil and put in the fridge  for the day.  The only ingredient that I changed was to use 1/4 cup dried onion flakes (for the doubled recipe) instead of minced fresh onions.  They worked just fine and it was much quicker to put together.  I probably also put less of the topping on the inside of the rolls than the recipe called for.  Just brushed the butter sauce on each roll bottom till they looked well moistened.  I just love how these get kind of crispy on the bottom, got ooey, gooey on the inside, and the topping was so pretty and tasted so good.  Great company casual meal! Thanks, Susan.  I am going to go out to the site and see what other yummy contributions you have made.

I made these as a snack for Super Bowl. My fiancé cannot eat carbs so I felt bad about making them. However, even without the bread, he said the meat, cheese and sauce was delicious. Really loved these and will definitely make these again for a party or pot luck.

delicious!  I didn't have dijon mustard so used honey mustard dressing and it was very good. my kids prefer Colby jack cheese so used that instead of Swiss.  served with seasoned  fries and a salad and felt like we were at Arby's.

These are amazing! I make a triple batch and they last maybe a day. Everyone also loves them at potlucks.

Delicious! Very reliable crowd-pleaser. I halved the recipe with great results. Perfect portion for a family dinner for four. I also brushed half of the butter sauce on the buns before layering on the ham and cheese.

Made this for my daughter's wedding shower. They were such a hit I made them again for a family outing. Everyone loved them and they were super easy to make. Will definitely use this recipe a lot.

We love this recipe tho I cut the butter down a couple of Tbsp, and I also dice half of a small onion to mix into the topping as well. Delish!
