Delicious! The only changes I made were to use grated (rather than shaved) Parmesan cheese (because grated was what I had on hand) and to toast the almonds before tossing them in. I also chilled the salad for a few hours, though I tasted before chilling and it was delicious hot too.

Made it with gluten free pasta, a good option for those with celiac disease. Great recipe to make ahead of time.
