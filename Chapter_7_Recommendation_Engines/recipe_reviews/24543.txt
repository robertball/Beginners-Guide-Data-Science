I used frozen peas and warmed them up in the microwave.  It turned the salad in to the YUMMIEST healthy wilted spinach salad (mmm no bacon grease).  IT WAS SO GOOD!

Very easy. Took suggestions & used less lemon juice & olive oil. We might try adding some bacon in next time for a change.

Very "lemony" and tart. It was a nice change to regular salad dressings.

Very easy to prepare, I think my lemons were extra juicy as it was very tangy. I will make again but with less oil and lemon.

Simple and very easy to fix, but I just don't care for the lemon and olive oil dressing. Not bad. I just like other dressings better. I like the salad ingredients and next time will probably use white balsamic, as another reviewer suggested.

DO NOT USE CANNED PEAS!  Don't know what I was thinking!  Looking forward to trying this with crisp crunchy fresh peas!! --------2nd time around got it right, frozen peas cooked in the micro.  Good salad.

This is a great figure friendly salad.  For a "bigger" meal I add cukes, tomatoes, mushrooms, black olives, steak seasoning and roll it up on a seasoned 12" tortilla.  I use lots of extra virgin oil and squeeze a half lemon over all the freshest flavor.  It'a very addicting.

This was okay.  We usually do this same salad, but use white balsalmic instead of lemon juice - I think that is still my preference, as it gives it a hint of sweetness.

This recipe was fast and easy, but tasted oily and sour.  I needed it right away for a funeral dinner at church, so had to improvise.  I added Italian dressing and it was then fantastic!  I also boiled eggs and sliced them to decorate the dish for serving.  Great use of fresh spinach! Thanks.

Very good...used only 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 lemon.  Added 4 strips of crumbled bacon.  Very light and tasty...will make again!

Nice, refreshing salad; but I use white balsamic vinegar instead of lemon -- also topped my salad with sliced carambola.  My guests had never had carambola before and thought it was very tasty on the salad.  So did I!

I made 1/2 the recipe which was more than sufficient for my small dinner gathering.  At that, 1/2 of the olive oil called for and half of the fresh lemon called for was more than enough.  I would go more sparingly on both next time.   I used frozen peas, cooked in microwave and cooled before adding.   With these modifications, I would definitely make again.  Delicious, lemony and easy.
