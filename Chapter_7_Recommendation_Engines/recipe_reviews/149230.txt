Gave this 4 stars but only because of the cooking times listed.   My chops were dried out and a little tough.  However..the marinade is tasty and flavorful, the panko-parmesan breading is outstanding - but the chops should be cooked for less time at a higher temp  (ala shake & bake)  

I think 15-20 min at 425 degrees would produce juicier more tender chops.  Plan to use this recipe again with these cooking times.

A 5 plus for moistness.  Pork is my favorite food so I'm kind of an expert in preparing it.  This recipe is great for those who overcook pork or say that their chops are too dry.  I used bone in chops and they were very thick (1 1/2 in.)  I followed the cooking time exactly and these were perfect. If you are using thin boneless chops you will need to decrease the time. The marinade did not impart much flavor so many might find it bland.  Thanks submitter.

Crisp coating without the oil. Breaded all 4 pork chops but only made one for myself.  I placed the remaining chops on a pan and put in the freezer. After they were froze I put in individual bags to freeze for a future meal. I could have baked all 4 and then froze them, but microwaves always seem to make coatings soggy.

this recipe needs a rack when cooking. I followed the recipe directions as written. My breading stuck to the pan. A rack would have stopped that. I shortened my cooking time to 25 minutes total and had a perfectly done chop.

Octoberfest beer?  I had Miller Lite on hand and used it.  The chops marinated for about an hour and while I thought the flavor was *great*, I also thought the beer flavor was stronger than I expected.  If you don't like the taste of beer don't marinate an hour like I did.  The main reason I gave only 4 stars was because the coating never crisped, never even browned, actually a little soggy.  Wasn't sure if it was the eggs or maybe pat dry after removing from marinade.  Otherwise, very good.

I think either the temperature or the cooking time was a bit off on this one as the pork chops were a bit dry.

Pretty good. I used a tenderloin cut into medallions. And I grilled it. It was really good. Flavors are subtle. I'll probably tweak it some next time to make the flavors more bold but it is a great recipe. I was a bit surprised. My kids usually drown everything in Ranch or Blue Cheese. They did not put a thing on this. Ate it as is saying it was very good. They did ask that i kick the spice level up a notch next time though. There will be a next time. Thanks.

Only marinated for 30 minutes like recipie said and was recommended.  I then pan fried the pork chops (after dredging them in flour, salt, pepper).  Then put in scarce amount of water and cooked for 1 hour.  Gravy left was DELICIOUS!

we loved the dish.. bf made this.. basically to a T except for adding a bit more pepper per usual.. only had bone in pork chops.. we didn't have the problem most reviewers did with the pork chops coming out dry.. bf cooked it on the top rack away from the heat source for longer.. kind of a "low and slow" way of thinking.. super tasty.. ty for the recipe

These were great!  I loved the different flavor you get, rather than the basic bbq or terriyaki marinades.  I did a German themed dinner with some spaetzle and mushroom gravy.  Everyone loved the chops.  I made the mistake of baking them on a stone cookie sheet.  The panko didn't crisp up at all - but that was my fault, not the recipe's.  I will definately try these again!

We didn't think the marinade went with the panko + parm coating.  And the coating never crisped up in the oven - maybe pan frying would be better?

I'm not sure how other people's ovens work, but after 40 minutes following the recipe exactly, the chops were bone white and mushy. I took them out and pan fried them the rest of the way.  Taste was pretty blah, unfortunately, also. Would not eat again.

5 stars based on my tweaks and there were quite a few. I only used half a bottle of beer (Sierra Nevada Tumbler Autumn Brown). I skipped any additional salt for the marinade, but I did add some cayenne pepper and dried onion. One egg probably would have been sufficient, so Iâ€™ll try that next time. After placing the pork chops on the baking sheet, I added the remaining garlic from the marinade on top. I also adjusted the temp and cook time. 400 degrees for 15 min, turn the pork chops and cook for another 12 min. Make sure to check the internal temp.

Just OK. Prepared as recipe said. Would not make it again. There was a taste I did not care for,  I think the beer.

Nice and juicy, not dried out. Cooked it for 35 minutes at 345-bone in. If I had not turned them over the last few minutes,  they would have been somewhat crunchy on one side.
Not crazy about the beer flavor. I added salt and Season-all to the breading for more flavor.

My boneless pork loin chops were way over cooked with timing suggested. Reducing timing next time but will try again.

This was so tasty! I had to use Sam Boston because I didn't realize I was out of Sam October. Also I followed others advice by cooking these for 20 minutes at 425. Juicy, tender and delicious! Will make again for sure. Oh and I marinated for 3 hours instead of a half hour.

I had it with plain bread crumbs and it probably  detracted from it. Still good but I believe the panto bread crumbs would have put it over the top.

My pork chops came out dry.  I cut back the cooking time as they were very thin boneless chops.  Also, the breading didn't stick to the pork chop and it was kind of soggy.

Very easy and very good. I ran out of panko bread crumbs so I ended up breading some of my pork chops in italian bread crumbs. After reading the reviews I was scared this would come out soggy, but it didn't. This recipe came out very good.

Great flavor--used Sam Adams Oktoberfest beer. But the breading did not crisp up on the bottom of the chops, and when I took them out of the pan, it stayed in the pan, kind of a soggy mess. Followed instructions to a t!

Breading fell off as soon as I went to flip them. Very disappointed. Non stick dish and everything.
