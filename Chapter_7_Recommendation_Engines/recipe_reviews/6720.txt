I submitted this recipe and have made improvements on the original.  I now use 1/3 cup of honey and 1/3 cup of oil instead of the sugar and shortening.  Sometimes I use water that I have drained off potatoes that I have cooked the night before for dinner, no need to actually add the potato to the recipe, only the potato water; it is what helps keep the whole wheat bread lighter. I also now use instant yeast and just mix it in with the flour.  Only need two risings, one initial and then one after you form the loaves and place in the bread pans.  The changes to the recipe make it healthier and faster.  Happy bread baking.

The texture of this bread is wonderful and very tasty. However, I would definately double the salt amount. I also used oil instead of shortening and it worked out perfect. You can halve this recipe and still get 3 loaves. It took me 4 hours but was totally worth it. Yum...

I've been attempting to bake bread for the past 25 years with varying success.  I've tried recipe after recipe and I believe I've finally found gold. No doubt this will be a main stay in our home. The results of my first batch was overwhelmingly successful. I can't even begin to explain how pleased I was.  This recipe is definitely the BEST!

I can see why this is a family favorite! We love it. I needed much more flour and ended up with 8 loaves. Was this my mistake?

This was good bread, just not what I wanted on the day that I made it.  Be warned that you need a huge bowl to allow this dough to rise.  It overflowed the largest bowl in my house.

I love wheat bread, but did not like this one at all.  Granted, it was very moist from the potatoes, but was lacking something.  It took a lot of time and was very disappointed at the end result

A surprisingly light bread for one that uses all wheat flour. The whole family loved it!

The prep time is long (due to the second rise before "loaf-ing" it) but it's easy to put together and the taste is wonderful.

Toasts nicely, too!

What a pleasant surprise.  I didn't know homemade 100% whole wheat bread could be so light and tender.  This one will be a regular around our house.

It's not fast; but this is an excellant recipe.  If you bake more bread than you buy, it's worth a try.

I couldn't believe how light it was for whole wheat bread.  The taste and texture was just superb.  First time I tried it was serving 10 for supper.  Everyone thought it was totally wonderful.

This makes a LOT of bread dough.  Do NOT attempt to use a Kitchen Aid to mix this.  Based on other reviews I was hesitant to use the entire amount of liquid.  Indeed I started out with 4 cups warm milk & 2 cups of potato water - then adjusted the amount of flour to achieve the desired dough consistancy.  Following the suggestion of the recipe submitter and used 1/3 cup honey and 1/3 cup oil.  For a more experienced bread baker this recipe is fine - however the recipe itself is rather poorly written but does produce excellent 100 % Whole Wheat bread.

What a great recipe!!  I've been playing with wholemeal bread and this one is a winner!!!  I halved this and I'm glad I did as it wouldn't have fitted my bowl!!  I used all whey from my soft cheese making and reduced the sugar to 1 tbls.  I also used the whey straight from the fridge and left my dough to prove overnight in my cool scullery.  Fantastic!!!  I made one two pound loaf and two one pound loaves from half the recipe.

I've baked bread for years, and this sounded really good, but it was a sticky mess after adding the flour.  I ended up adding almost 3 more cups of flour before I could even knead it. Won't make it again.

i would love to give this recipe a 5 star rating but i've only been successful with it once. and that was only because i made rolls with all the extra dough. i too, have to add a lot more flour. one of the problems seems to be the potato water. sometimes i have one cup, most times no water at all. it all boils away. what is the secret?

Wow - this makes a lot of bread - way too much - b/c I had such a hard time working with so much dough - and i had to add much more flour than called for  (almost half a kilo) and it took like all day to bake - i have a little oven and I couldn't do all four loaves at once - and my oh my how they were big loaves -- could easily have made 6 regular size loaves... hmm, the taste and texure is mediocre, dense, and not tasty at all... I will definitely not be making this again.

This was excellent. I made half the amount and used a cup of oatmeal and two cups of white flour in place of three cups of the whole wheat. It was wonderful and soft. I will make it often.

This recipe will be easier if you have a left over potato you could use instead of cooking one just for the recipe.  The bread tasted great fresh out of the oven, but then it got so dry and crumbly that I couldn't use it for sandwiches or toast.  I will probably try it one more time just in case I missed something last time.  However, if it turns out the same, I'm going to have to look for a new recipe.

I am not a baker.  This turned out heavy and yeasty.  I measured precisely, couldn't knead the dough because it was so sticky so I added a little more flour.

This is GREAT.  I've been making this for years.  Add Vital Wheat Gluten (can be found in grocery stores) per pkg. directions to get a easier to work with dough and more tender bread.  It makes a LOT and I have to put it into my mixer in batches.  It takes most of a day for me to make this recipe, it's great for gifts, freezes well after it's baked and my family loves it!

This recipe was the best bread that I have ever made. I thought that I needed so much extra flour because I used white instead of whole wheat, but after reading the other reviews, I realized that it is just the recipe. But we didn't mind, we eat home bread faster than store bought. I also took two extra loaves into work, and it was gone by lunchtime. Everyone that has tried it loves it. I havefound my new bread recipe.

This is the best 100% Whole Wheat Bread I have ever made and I've been baking Bread for a long time. For those who think there is not enough salt, read the recipe again salt is added in twice. I say this because I forgot to add the second time once, yuck. Also, I use a tablespoon of plain instant mashed Potatoes mixed with the water.If you need to fool your family try using white whole wheat flour.
