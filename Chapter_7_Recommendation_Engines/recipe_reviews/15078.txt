O.K. gang, I think I solved the "dry dough" problem that many seemed to have. First of all, I MAY have used a little more than two tablespoons of butter, but definitely no more than three. My butter was a little squished from greasing a cake pan so it was hard to tell exactly how much it was. However, the secret is to mix everything in a food processor. My dough came off the sides of the bowl and formed a perfect moist ball and it couldn't have been any easier to work with. I hope this helps. My oldest daughter thought these were fantastic and my hubby and younger daughter thought they were just O.K. I loved them. I used both green and black olives. The black olives were huge, so I stuffed them with a little salami. Will definitely make these again!

I have been making a version of this recipe for years, and it is always a hit at parties.  My recipe calls for 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar, 
1 1/4 cups flour, 1 stick margarine or butter (melted), and about 36 pimiento-stuffed green olives (drain and pat dry with a paper towel; amt. of olives used will vary depending on how much dough you wrap around each).  I don't use any cayenne.  Mix the cheese and flour, then mix in the margarine, working the dough with your hands if it seems dry.  Mold approx. 1 tsp. dough around each olive; refrigerate wrapped olives at least 1 hour before baking.  (I often refrigerate overnight.)  Bake @ 400 20 minutes or until golden.  I promise you, everyone will love these - I have never taken them to a party or shower without requests for the recipe, and people specifically ask me to bring them to events!  They've even converted a few former olive-haters...  :-)

These were a HUGE hit at my holiday gatherings.  I made a DOUBLE BATCH on two seperate occasions and had no leftovers.  I did not have any problem getting my dough to stick together, but I DID use my mixer.  I started with my whisk-style beaters to blend everything, then when the dough started to stick together I put on my dough hook and kept mixing until it was a smooth ball of dough.  I also found if I use a small 1 tablespoon-size scoop (like ice cream scoop) to spoon out the dough, I had nice, even-sized appetizers.  This was the perfect amount of dough to wrap around the larger "Queen" size green olives.  Both times I prepared these in advance and froze them.  When I was ready to bake them, I just took them out of freezer and baked for 1-2 additional minutes, till they were golden.  Oh, one other thing - I served these warm by keeping them in my crockpot with the lid off and they WERE WONDERFUL.

The ingredient list for this recipe is just fine; it's the method that's jacked! I read everyone's really helpful reviews (I love this site) and I made it the following way to total perfection:

First, just double the recipe.  Pulse the 1 cup of flour and 4 tbls COLD butter together in the food processor until it achieves a crumb texture.  Add the cheese and pulse.  Then stream in about a 1/4 cup of ice cold water until it comes together.  It makes a perfect consistency.  

Then, drain your olives very well and toss them with a little flour.  After that, it's a BREEZE to cover the olives. Like someone else mentioned, just make a flat disc of dough and squish it around the olive. 

This is a winner! The dough is basically cheese straw dough!

I've made these so many times I practically have the recipe memorized because we love these!  Like other reviewers, I also had the "dry dough" problem, but my solution was to add some olive juice/brine to the dough.  It makes it moist (without extra butter!) and easy to shape onto the olives.  Just make sure that you don't add too much "juice" or the dough gets slippery.  
These were a hit at a Christmas party and people still talk about them even now!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is for how time consuming these are, but they taste so good!!

These are quick to make and very tasty, but the recipe does need some work. First, you must add more butter, I've made these several times and always end up adding two additional tablespoons of butter. I also melt it, to make mixing easier. Also tasty with a shot of worcestershire sauce.

Very unique flavor - I added a bit of extra virgin olive oil and water to the batter which worked fantastically to hold the mixture to the olive.

This recipe has a lot of potential, but needed tinkering. I had to add butter to bind the dough. Most of my guests left the olive and just ate the dough - I might try cocktail weiners or meatballs for the filling next time.

Really enjoyed these.  Make sure the dough is cold before baking so it doesn't spread as much.  I'll definately make these again.

These olives are really quite good. They're a bit time consuming to make, and if you need to make a lot for a party its tough because they go so fast. The prep of the ingredients isn't bad its getting the dough to stay around the olive and wrapping each one. My guests have always found the effort to be well worth it, and absolutely love them.

I followed the amounts and directions by Ashley except reversed order of mixing to flour and melted butter then added cheese.  Heat from the butter helped the cheese mix right in for a beautiful soft dough.  I froze them and baked several days later.  My dough covered about 50-60 small olives.

I have made this recipe about a gazillion times and they're always a huge hit! I have a couple of suggestions to make it easier"

1 - I treat the dough like I would pie crust. I put the ingredients in my food processor and run it  until the dough pulls off the sides and starts to form a ball. If it's too dry, I add water a tsp at a time. 

2 - I roll out the dough (again, like a pie crust) until it's about 1/8 of an inch thin. Then, I use a shot glass to make tiny circles, then wrap an olive in each circle. Sooo much easier than trying to guess, and they all come out uniform! 

3 - I have a few friends that detest olives, so I also do a batch with little cubes of beef summer sausage, which are delicious too!

Everlastingwhy had the right idea with this: double the dough, lightly flour your olives, and be sure to use a food processor. Additionally, I found it helpful to let the olives drain for a bit on a few layers of paper towel. Removing the excess moisture kept them from getting soggy while cooking.  With some tweaks to the instructions, these were a HUGE hit. I served them a few hours ago at a party and they went over so well that I had to come on here and review them. A labor intensive but absolutely delicious appetizer! Love that you can make them ahead and freeze them.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I read the reviews and there were complaints of the dough being dry. I agree... if not prepared in a food processor then you really have to work the dough in order to make it work. I kneaded the dough into a ball, then rolled it out with a rolling pin. It will take time, but it's worth it. I made this recipe with cocktail olives and green olives stuffed with blue cheese ~both were yummy. Thanks for sharing! I'll be making this again.

I followed some other reviews and added a bit of water to my dough just until it came together (I used about a tablespoon total) I also added a dash of garlic powder and a bit of paprika for some extra flavor. I drained my olives on paper towels and dusted them with flour before wrapping the dough around them, which made them super easy to assemble. My olives were a bit small so I had some left over dough that I made crackers out of, my son really enjoyed those . Overall, these were too salty for me, and I normally love the saltyness of green olives. Maybe I would have enjoyed them more if I had a creamy dip to go with them, to kind of mask some of the saltyness. The dough was pretty good though, nice and flakey. Ill make these again with a different olive (probably black ones, and probably stuffed with something, like a meat or cheese) just because the dough was really nice and was easy to make. Id even make the dough just for crackers or cheese straws, but id add more seasonings if I used it for that alone. Thanks for sharing

This recipe came out well once I took into account a number of reviews.  It is really difficult to get the dough to come together without a food processer, but with the processor you just throw the ingredients in and whizz for about 20 seconds and you are good to go.  I also only got the dough to cover 20 olives.  When I tried to make it go further I had trouble with the dough sticking and not cracking.  The baking was the other problem - they did not turn golden brown, just slightly crispy and this took about 25 minutes to achieve.  Bearing all this in mind, I will be using this recipe again and will try covering other varieties of olive and maybe cocktail sausages.

The ingredients were easy. The prep was easy. The name sounded good. But the recipe itself was TERRIBLE! I don't usually bring a new recipe to a potluck, but I did with this and I was embarrassed. It was dry, tasteless, and literally hard to swallow. Instead of a dough I think it needed a batter, and then a good unusual spicy dipping sauce. Perhaps I will play around with the recipe because I love green olives. What a total disappointment and waste of money on ingredients. I'm about to see if I can pick off the dough to salvage the olives.

When making these, I used large green olives. When I used only 2 tablespoons butter, the mix would not bind, so I added more butter. This helped the dough. I brought them to a party and everyone LOVED them. A keeper! I served them with a ranch dip

This is a party pleaser (if you like green olives and can still eat dairy and gluten).  This recipe uses basic ingredients that you probably have on hand.  It is a great way to use up that open jar of olives in your fridge.  Can be made with black olives as well, although the outcome is not nearly a zesty.  You can freeze them and bake them later for unexpected guests.  Two caveats:  They are labor intensive (but worth it) and I do find I require extra moisture (more butter) to get the dough workable.

Made these for a family holiday dinner.  I added some finely ground pecans and green onions to the dough for added texture and color.  They came out very very well. I turned mine several times during the baking so they would get done more evenly on all sides.  I also used jalapeno stuffed olives and they pack quite a kick!  This dough would be very good for olives stuffed with different things as well as wrapped around dates.  I will make these again.

I followed Everlast's suggestions as to the order of combining ingrediants for this recipe; I had made it many years ago, and this was the closest one to my memories.  I served it as one of the many appetizers at my parent's 50th anniversary party and received rave reviews!  My persnickety uncle stood at the table and kept popping them in his mouth; every single one disappeared as they came out of the oven!  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!

These are the best. As for being to salty, it's best to drain and pat dry the olives.  I added EVOO and a bit of water to the dough.  Didn't use a food processor, but I did run the dough through my pasta press to combine.  Worked great.  Just a note, I've also omitted the butter and just used EVOO for great results.  Make sure your cheese is a low to no moisture cheese to prevent oily snacks.  This dough works great around other things too, stuffed Japalones, Black olives with feta cheese, even used mini sausages.  Have fun!

These were really yummy.  I used a pastry blender to combine 3 tbsps of cold  butter with the flour.  Then I mixed in the cheese using my hands.  The consistency was perfect!  After tasting the dough, I added a little garlic and black pepper to give it a bit more flavour.  I think I'll leave out the pepper next time and just double the paprika. (The black specks weren't very attractive.) It was easy to wrap the olives in the dough. I just grabbed a bit at a time and flattened it between my palms.  I wrapped the dough around the olives and pinched off any extra, then rolled them in my hands to smooth out the shape.  I used big fat meaty green olives from the deli and they were fantastic.  Smaller cocktail olives would make cuter bite-sized treats for a party.  I will definitely make these again!

I've been making this for over 25 years and they are the most requested item for any and all family get togethers - weddings, showers, holiday dinners, etc.  I do add paprika and not so much cayenne pepper, we have little ones that don't like things too spicy.  (Make sure you totally cover the olive with the dough - trust me!) 
I always make these ahead and freeze them on a cookie sheet until frozen then put them in a zip bag and back into the freezer.  You realy don't have to defrost before baking - just add a few extra minutes and keep your eye on it so they don't burn.

I added a tablespoon or 2 or ICE water to make the dough easier to shape around the olives. The dough should be soft and not dry (similar to pie dough) when shaping around olives. Shape each piece of dough into a flat disk, about 1 1/2" diameter, put olive in center and bring ends together at tope of olive.Roll in palms of hands to make round.

This is the first recipe I've not enjoyed from this site. The dough blended very well in the food processor and they shaped up fine. But during baking they flattened and they were very greasy. Either too much butter or cheese. Will not make again.

I like cheese and I like olives so in turn I like this. I will make agian but this time I will use just one T of water instead of two as suggested. Two T's is a little to much and left the dough very sticky/gooey and hard to work with.

This recipe was well received at the party I took them to.  I did as many suggested and added 2 T water to the dough.  Also I refrigerated the olives in dough about 10 minutes.  

If using queen size olives (or larger), you will need to at least double the dough recipe.

I personally don't like olives, but this was a big hit as an appetizer. Even my 6 yr old loved them. Easy to make. I made them ahead, not messy to make(didn't have cayenne pepper so I used some chili powder). I put them on a pan in the freezer just until they were solid enough to not stick together, then bagged them for a couple days until time to bake. I plan to make this recipe as a standard appetizer for all future party meals.

This dough was very dry.  Since it is almost a pie crust dough, I added 2 TBSP of cold water, a teaspoon at a time.  This made a very nice cheesy dough that my husband (who doesn't care for green olives) really enjoyed.  I will use it again.  How would it be wrapped around a third of a cocktail sausage?

These were quite tasty, however I found the dough to be a little dry.  Just add 1-2 tbl. butter to the recipe and you should have no problem.  They also bake up well after being frozen.  I highly recommend this recipe for any cocktail party. Excellent with a martini!!!

I love olives and have had friends make these before, but I wasn't as successful with these.  It took forever because I  had trouble getting the dough to bind even after adding more butter.  I may have to play around with the recipe or find a friends recipe because I love these but this time, wasn't as successful.

Difficult to coat the olives - I ended up being able to make half of what the recipe should have made.  Half of my guests loved them, half hated them - you really have to be an olive fan.  Probably won't make again.

These are pretty good! However, I had a little trouble in trying to "roll" the dough around the olives! But it is worth it. Next time, I think I would make a cheese dip to accompany it. They were very tasty!

This recipe is a guaranteed hit at parties. The things I do differently is replace the cheddar cheese with processed cheese spread and use large garlic or jalapeno stuffed olives. The cheese comes in a little glass jar with a blue lid and makes it less greasy while adding a little spice from the sharpness of the spread. Half a jar for the standard batch.

It's a very different recipe that you should try once.  Make sure to soak the olives in cold water for a bit as they tend to be really salty. Otherwise, a good taste if you like olives.

If I hadn't read other reviews, I would have given this recipe four stars because of the difficulty of getting the dough wrapped around the olive itself.  However, knowing that some sort of additional moisture needed to be added to the dough made it much easier to wrap the olive.  Biggest hit of New Years Eve.

OMG! These were delicious. I did what it said in the comment below and washed off the olives and instead of cheddar cheese I used grated swiss gruyere cheese from Trader Joes! I made mine gluten free because I have celiac, so I used Jules Flour and EVOO instead of butter. I had to add water to get the mixture more moist. But loved the results. If you love olives you'll love these!!!

These were not that tedious to make.  I would expect some time to roll each olive.  Why I did not like this is because, after being baked, the crust is very dry and flaky.  I would like it much more if it was more moist and soft, not flaky.  The taste reminded me of a butter cracker with an olive on it.  Not too bad, but not fantastic either.  I probably will not make these again.

I didn't think these were good enough to warrant the work.  I didn't have any pimento olives so I tried both blue cheese and jalapeno stuffed.  I added about a TB. of butter to make the dough a little easier to work with.

FOR THANKSGIVING OR FALL VERSION:  add orange food color to cheese-butter-flour mixture.  Then after wrapping olives in dough, flatten the walnut sized ball on the bottom, then score the sides of orange ball to resemble pumpkins.  Add a slivered almond to top for a "stem."  Bake as directed at 400 for 15 to 20 minutes on parchment paper covered baking sheet.  Serve on platter with garnish of fresh rosemary or parsley for your "pumpkin patch!"  WONDERFUL for TGiving or fall festive appetizer! - Nancy in Bend, Oregon

If anyone else out there is a college student like me and does not have access to a "beater" here is what I did and it worked very well. I followed the ingredients of the recipe but added about 1/8 a cup of cold water. I used a large spoon and made a dough mixture finishing it off by kneading it a bit. Hope that helps any unfortunate soul like me with a beater.

Amazing! I will definitely make these next time we have guests coming for appetizers. I used Jalapeno stuffed olives because that's what I had on hand. It was a bit tricky getting the dough around the olive, but I squished mini patties of dough in my palm to help shape it around the olive.

I have been making this recipe for YEARS! It is super easy to make and always a huge hit, even with people who say they hate olives! If you are having a hard time wrapping the olive in the dough mixture, add just a LITTLE bit of the olive juice (from the jar)...this makes it a lot easier to wrap. That's my technique! The only problem: I never seem to make enough! They go soooo fast! Oh & I never use a food processor or anything - just mix it with a big spoon & it works everytime!

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used black pepper instead of cayenne. I also blended the "dough" in the food processor because it was extremely crumbly and dry after just stirring. After blending, the dough is very easy to work with. These are very yummy if you like olives. :)

Everyone raved about these. I used large olives stuffed with almonds. I initially had trouble with the dough so added about a tablespoon of olive oil and about 1/4 to 1/2 cup water while the mixer was going till I got a dough consistency. I used the flat beater. Once the dough was formed, I chilled it for over an hour. Then I wrapped the air dried olives and placed them on a cookie sheet in the fridge overnight. I popped them in the oven for 15 min at 400. They were perfect. Great recipe.

I had to add a little more butter & some oil to get this to the right consistancy so it would hold together.  Other than that I thought this was a wanderful recipe.  It was a hit at my office potluck.  I made some with green olives, blk olives & even ham.  The blk olives & the ham went first.  My favorite is the ham.

I added more butter to the recipe - a full stick which caused the dough to spread slightly - but this was still a great recipe.

I also used different olives for a change of pace.  I rolled the jalapeno stuffed olives in poppy seeds to distinguish them from the others and warn potential tastees.

I've been making these to bring for T-giving for the last 6 years and they're always a hit.  Some things I've learned:  You can make them with sour cocktail onions Yum!  Serve them with un-cheesed olives & onions for delicious contrast.  Add the flour slowly to avoid dryness. & Leave some at home so YOU get to eat a few.

I think these are delicious!  You have to like olives to totally appreciate them.  My husband doesn't like olives so I thought I would try this dough on mushrooms or something else next time.

Deliciously addictive but extremely time consuming to make.  I tried varying the recipe to make it less crumbly when assembling but in the end stitch with the original recipe.

You must like plain dough to like this recipe, I just didn't care much for it, I expected to taste cheese more. My friends said it was good, but I could tell they were just being nice (there were several left over at the end of the party). I was glad I added more red pepper, I guess the spice made it a little better. I won't make it again.

My batter was super dry- so dry it didn't turn into a dough at all.  But, that was easily solved with a little extra butter and a splash of milk.  I sprinkled red pepper on top of some of them so there was a little extra kick.  With modifications to the ingredient list (more liquid really is needed) this recipe is a 5-star recipe.

A very yummy lightweight snack!  The dough is a bit dry to work with at first, but the more you work it with your hands the more pliable it gets!  The suggestion of adding one more Tablespoon of butter was a great one  :)

i just made these and using other reviewers suggestions, i had no problem. But, it lacks some punch. The "olive" flavor  kind of overpowered the cheese. A previous reviewer mentioned maybe a dipping sauce,,,i was maybe thinking a jalepeno chedder dipping cheese sauce and not serving the olives for about ten minutes as someone else suggested, but I will have the cheese sauce hot. You know, that jalepeno cheese sauce for taco chips. My olives are frozen right now but i am planning on putting them out on xmas eve. I think i will buy the dip,,, i'll give it a shot and it will give guests a choice...to dip or not to dip

My family went crazy over these.  I made them for Thanksgiving and they didn't last long. I added a bit of garlic powder to the dough too for added flavor.  Also, I added a little bit extra butter (melted) to make them have a slight crisp to them.  I will definatly be making these again.  For Christmas if my family has anything to say about it!

I make this at home alot and take to people's houses as well. It's always a huge hit as long as you like olives. I do tend to add a bit more cheese. They are easy to make and from start to finish, fast on the table.

I saw the reviews about the dough not sticking together enough to wrap the olives in it but decided to try it anyway... and was disappointed.  There was no way the dough could be wrapped around the olives!  I ended up just flattening the dough in a square and pushing in the olives on top, hoping to cut them in squares after baking.  Unfotunately the dough is extrememly flaky and brittle, so this didn't really work well either.

The kids (8 & 9) and I did this recipe for an afternoon snack. After the food processor mixed the dough, we used our hands to finish it. We broke the dough into 24 pieces before we started, and wrapped the flattened dough around each olive. We had to bake for 20 min to get brown. They turned out well. Both kids said they would make it again. The cheese and the strong olive taste is an interesting mix, but it gets addictive. Fun with the kids, but I wouldn't do it for a party - too much work!

These were pretty good.  The only reason I didn't give them five stars was because I did have to add some warm water to the dough to get it the right consistancy.  I love that I can make a ton and freeze them, and they still only take about 15 minutes till they're hot and ready to eat

These were amazing. For people living in dry climates, the dough will generally not have enough moisture to come together properly, even if mixed in a food processor. I added a little bit of the olive brine to bring the dough together into a moist enough ball. I did not need more than a teaspoon or two, and it will depend on just how dry a day it is, but it pulled the dough together without adding extra fat, and with added flavor. Also, I only used half a tablespoon of dough around each olive and that made the amount the recipe said it would, and was the right amount of dough for the olive.

Very good!  I made 2 batches of these and the second one I added 1/4 cup more of flour to make them a little less cheesy.  I also added olive juice to the mixture to make it easier to work with. That worked great!

I love olives, made two batches the day before my housewarming party, baked them the day of the party and only 10 were gone by the end. I followed recipe exactly and also used blender to mix. Balls looked great, no slipping while baking, if they only tasted half as good as they looked.

These have a nice little kick to them and are a great variation from the standard "pop in your mouth" apps we grow used to serving.  Make sure to label them, however, otherwise people pass them by not sure what they are.  Once people realized what was in them, they were a HUGE success.

I love olives and was very eager to try this recipe.  How disappointed I was!  I would say this was average at best.  The breading was really good, but just didn't taste that great w/the olives.  I'm glad I tried this before serving at my party.  The dough was easy to cover the olives though.  Oh well.....

A wonderful quick appetizer. Everyone in my family LOVED it. I had to add a little more butter then what it called for.

This is a delicious appetizer and generally popular. Solved the "dry dough" problem by microwaving the cheese for a few seconds - just enough to soften, not melt it. I've also done a black olive version of this - I put a little cream cheese inside the olives, and use mozzarella or Italian blend shredded cheese in the dough, no cayenne pepper. Some people are very opinionated about the color of their olives, so this is a great alternative for people who hate the green ones!

So good! I have made these more times than I can count. They are my go to for either Christmas or New Years...or both! The trick, which I learned from reading other reviews, is to make the dough in a food processor and add a little oil to make the dough just a more pliable. Also, it helps to dry the olives before wrapping them.

Very interesting tidbits, we thought they were more odd than delicious.  I used Jumbo olives so I only got about 15 of these. Baked in a convection oven they still were perfectly done in 15 minutes (even though they were larger than the recipe olives).  I used a food processor and extra butter but the dough was still just crumbles I had to mash together around the olives then pull off the excess.  I might try this again with smaller olives (the jumbo ones make it very salty and harder to wrap) because the outside "wrap" is delicious and cheesy.    The cayenne really comes through so if you don't like spicy cut it back to just a sprinkle.

I thought I would love these but they were way too salty for me.  The combination of salty olives and cheddar was too much. Be sure you use unsalted butter if you try this recipe.

I followed a review and mixed my stuff up in the food processor.  I had to drizzle in about 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil in order for it to just sorta pull together enough so that I could wrap the olives.  Very time consuming.  I baked them for about 18 minutes and that seems to be just about right.  All in all, I think it was a lot of work for a ho-hum appetizer.  Probably won't be making again.

These were yummy!  I made them for a holiday party where I served a variety of appetizers.  If you don't like olives, you won't enjoy these, but if you're an olive fan (like my mother and I) then you will love them!  My only complaint was that it was a LOT of work to cover the olives in the dough.  But the result was a salty bite of yumminess!

The overall recipe was great. I did use garlic stuffed olives instead of the pimento, and deep fried them until golden brown over baking them. The olives tasted wonderful and everyone raved about them. I will try them baked one day soon.

Surprisingly good!! I used olives stuffed with jalepenos--I like it spicy! The dough at first looks like it isn't moist enough to put around the olives --but you just have to squish it around the olive and press it in your hand and it works just fine.(you'll see what I mean!) So tasty!!...I just have to think of a yummy dipping sauce--any ideas?

These are very easy and good.  The last time I made them I stuck a bowl of cucumber ranch dressing with them since they tend to be a little dry.  They were the biggest hit with the dressing.

These were good, but a touch too floury for my taste. We made a batch with white flour and another with whole-wheat; the whole-wheat was better. Microwaving the flour mixture for about 15-20 seconds made the dough much more manageable. Also, they tasted better about 15 min. out of the oven, with a little Dijon mustard.

These are delicious and super easy but they  must be made in the food processor.  Not sure why everyone has such a hard time with the dough...add butter until the consistency is moist.  I also added a bit of herbed goat cheese to layer flavors.  I used black pepper to taste. They take 20 min...not 15.

I used 3 Tbs of butter and a teaspoon of olive oil.  I ate a few immediately after they came out of the oven and did not like them very much.  After they had set, they were MUCH better.  It was almost like the flavors had to sit and blend.

Delicious!  A unique appetizer.  In my experience the ingredients ultimately have to be pressed together by hand in order for them to combine into a dough.  Also, I couldn't understand how it could make 24 Cheese Olives if you use a tablespoon of dough for each olive.  In that case, it will only make 10!  I did use HUGE olives, but even if I had used the small ones, if I used a tablespoon of dough, I would have only had enough for 10.

This is my first review.  This simple recipe convinced me I needed to share my experiences.  Since New Years I've made these twice for parties, stuck to the recipe except reducing the cayenne.  They are easy and fabulous, what a great combination!

These are wonderful.  I was slightly worried about the taste combination, but they were a big hit with everyone.  The cayenne pepper gave them a great kick.  I put everything into my Kitchen Aid mixer and let it run until the dough was well blended and formed a big moist lump.  It takes a little bit of time to individual wrap every olive, but it's well worth it.

I am giving this only one star because "as is", this recipe is impossible.  It only works with modifications and if you don't read the reviews first, you won't know that they need doctoring.  I did need to add water just to make the dough stick together and then I found them to be very salty and time consuming to prepare.  Only one person at my Christmas party really said anything positive about them.

I have now made these for Thanksgiving and Christmas to the adoration of all my guests.  The first preparation included black olives.  Stick to the giant green olives. They make a much more savory bite.  The black olives get kind of lost in the cheese.  Great original idea

These were just "ok". I had no trouble at all with the dough, and I did find them relatively easy to make. However, they were excessively salty and very, very dry. I would not make them again.

If you use a food processor for this dough, it comes out much more pliable.  I did add 2 teaspoons of cold water as someone else had suggested.  I think that next time I will use smaller olives.  Very Yummy!

I wish I would have read the reviews for this recipe first because I trashed the dough after making it the way the recipe is written.  The dough was WAY TOO crumbly to even coincider wraping the olives I don't even think I will make the effort to try again even with the suggestions.

I would love to know how the author Anita managed this recipe with only 2T's of butter.  I had to add an additional 2T's and they still seem too dry.  Overall, they're OK.  I made them at home first to test them out.  Probably won't go through the effort again though.

Decided to make these for my olive-loving sister and her husband and they loved them.  (I don't like olives.) The only thing is that I didn't have cayenne pepper and I had to add a little milk to the dough so I could wrap the olives.  Would definitely make them again for a party.

I made these for superbowl sunday in 04..They are great! I mixed monterey jack and cheddar cheeses.  Ill try with black olives next time, as green were a little salty.  Add a Tbsp. of olive oil to dough, its a little dry!  Overall, very good appetizer, they were eaten up!

Today I was able to experiment with this recipe.  I not only wrapped green olives but also black olives, black olives stuffed with a fresh sliver of garlic and sliced jalapenos (from a jar).  Even though hard to make a ball using jalapeno slices, these were our favorite.  Our second favorite was the black olives with the sliver of garlic.  They were all delicious but the reason for the four star was they were a smige dry.  Any dipping sause suggestions?  I will be making these for our Christmas functions this year.  Thanks.

I wasn't overly impressed by this appetizer.  The dough was a dry even though I used the extra butter that many of the other reviews recommended.  I will not be making these again, as it was obvious at the gathering I attended that no one else enjoyed them either.

I love this recipe!  I have never had any trouble with it being dry but have shared it with friends who have.  We have found that if all your ingredients are room temp, the recipe works.  The heat from your hands helps the already warm dough melt together.  Also the "cheaper" the brand of cheese, the dryer the dough.  These two things made it work for all of us!  Highly requested recipe for any get together we have.  :)

Great recipe! I've probably made it 50 times! I roll it out like pie crust dough and use a shot glass to cut circles to use for wrapping the olives. The only suggestion I have recipe-wise is to slowly add a little cold water to food processor until you get the right consistency.

I just made these for the first time in my mini prep processor and it worked fine following the instructions exactly. I added a little more cayenne but found the dough very easy to work with just at it was. It did take a few minutes for the dough to come together but be patient. Great to have in the freezer for impromptu guests.

they're good but too greasy and mine melted completely.. I did everything exactly as the recipe states.. I might have used a bit of more butter but some of you did that too and they didn't melt.. Weird... I will be trying this again but with less butter.. See if they stay balls this time.

I love olives!!  But didn't really care for this recipe.  My mixture was hard to work with.  I couldn't get the flour mixture around the olives.  On the other hand my husband loved them...so the problem is probably the chef not the recipe.

I used Crescent Rolls (light) instead of the dough recipe.  Great.  It was hard getting the cheese in though...I put in middle of dough square, but I didn't taste it anyway.  I think I'll skip the cheese next time.

After reading all of the previous "reviews" I began making these amazing appetizers. After mixing the cheese and butter, I went ahead and added a touch of EVOO and water (which I read in the reviews) to find it was perfect for the covering of the olives.  This was amazing and I will definately do this again!

You NEED to use a food processor to get the dough to the right consistancy. The end product is really yummy but very salty!!

The dough was way too dry, even after following the reviewer suggestions of adding extra butter or oil and using the food processor.  I did use Kraft Roasted Red Pepper salad dressing for dip, that was a great combination and I would highly recommend.  I wish these had worked for me, I loved the flavor combination.

I would like to start by saying, I love olives, I eat them right out of the jar....but this recipe, yuck!  I only ate 1, and most of our guests only ate one also.  We did have one guests that thought they were great, but everyone else voted to not have them again.

I loved these, mine also came out dry. I did not have the slippage problem as some, but I think I put to much of the cheese dough around the olive. They were huge, after baking. I also used olive brin to moisten it up a bit, but maybe more would have been better. I will make them again. Thanks for bring this recipe to uor home.

These were really good. We used some olives that were stuffed with blue cheese and some stuffed with habanero peppers.  The dough was a bit dry, so I added a tablespoon of milk to help it a bit, but all in all a good recipe.

These were good, not great.  I added 2 T of water to the dough, and mixed it in a food processor. It was pretty simple, really.  But the dough just never really got crisp.  I had to bake them A LOT longer than it says and they never got brown. They are good, just probably not worth the effort. Those who tasted them liked them, but didn't rave or anything.

I love olives and was really excited to try this recipe, but I was really disappointed.  I had to add more butter to this recipe to make it all stick...the dough was really hard to mess with.  I also added more cayenne pepper than asked for and the end product was still way too dry and blah.  They may have been better with some sort of dip, but still wouldn't have been great.  I will not waste my time making these again.

These were okay... but too salty and the dough was finicky.  I had to add more butter to make it stick together. A fair amount of work and not worth the results in my opinion.

The recipe says nothing about mixing into a dough. It was so crumbly. I added another tablespoon of butter and then really worked the dough. The recipe is time consuming but they tasted good. They are also easy to warm up in the microwave if you have leftovers.
I read the reviews but wish I would have written down some notes from other reviews before making the recipe a week later.

These went so fast!!! My husband who is not a green olive fan tried them and then later in the evening he was complaining because he only got one!!!  I was TOLD I will be making these for New Years as well.  I will use regular green olives, but also, green olives stuffed with peppers, garlic and onions would be FAB!!!!  Thank you!

This was an interesting combination. Many compliments! I found the "dough" to be a bit dry though and added a tablespoon of hot water. That fixed the problem and made it much easier to wrap the olives. They may need to be baked a bit longer due to the extra moisture. Also, adding water reduced the amount of servings, so plan accordingly.

A favorite of ours!  I served these to "Santa" as he was setting up on Christmas Eve... and he is hooked!  Has requested at every gathering we have had since!  I make several batches at one time, then freeze them to have on hand when someone stops by. They work out great!

These went over marginally at the party. (I made another batch with pepper jack in place of cheddar.  Maybe it was the combo of the salty olive with the hot pepper, but they were hardly touched in comparison to the cheddar.) I think if you love olives you'll appreciate this recipe for its ease, freezability, and final presentation. I mixed the ingredients with my hand mixer and added the flour slowly. It WAS crumbly, so I took another reviewer's suggestion to add a bit of olive oil and water and that, along with squishing the crumbly bits together on waxed paper, helped. Covering the olive was easiest when the dough was COLD.  The balls still came out a bit dry, but I don't know if it was the recipe or my baking them too long.  I kept expecting them to puff and brown - of which they did neither.

This was just OK. I had to add extra oil to make the dough workable. Once they were wrapped and cooked they just didn't do much for me. I brought them to a party and there were still some left at the end.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and myself. We both loved them and they were gone in seconds! I found the recipe super easy to make and not that time consuming at all. I did however add a small amount of olive juice to the cheese/flour mix so it was easier to stick around the olives. I also added other spices like paprika. Great recipe!
