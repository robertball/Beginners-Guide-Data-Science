I love to bake and this sounded perfect for my needs.  I mixed the dough as directed floured my surfaces but it was so sticky, I ended up using another recipe. Would love to have a hint as to what I did wrong!

My dough was sticky too, so I put it in the fridge for a couple of hours and then added flour a little at a time. Be careful not to add to much flour, then I rolled them out and used my Christmas cookie cutters. I let them cool and lightly dusted them with powdered sugar. Look how cute they are, and they taste really good, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Next time though I will try butter instead of shortening, I think it will have a little more flavor. I hope you try them too!

Dough was too sticky to roll it out.  My husband and I made it into balls and patted them out on the cookie sheet.  I think I lost most of the batter due to the stickyness of it, as I only ended up with a little over a dozen cookies.  They did taste great, but too messy to do again.
