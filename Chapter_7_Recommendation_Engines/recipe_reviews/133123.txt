AWESOME TREATS!! I changed the pumpkin amount from 1/2 cup to 1 full heaping cup and it did the trick! My dough was PERFECT! I kept the cinnamon (I FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT) I made smaller cookies so I left them in for only 15 minutes. They came out golden brown and smelling YUMMY! My dogs ate them up!

My Patterdale Terrier only plays with treats that he loves the most (throwing them around, hiding them, and most oddly, running around whining with them in his mouth). These definitely passed that test. I found one under my pillow!  I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup and used about 3 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter. Also threw in about 3/4 cup of rolled oats to give them some depth. I rolled them about to about 1/2 inch thickness and cut them out using dog bone and various mini christmas cookie cutters. Baked them for about 35 minutes. Awesome recipe, will make again and again. EDIT: I've been making these for 4 years now and they are loved by my dogs, as well as neighborhood hounds, family members; dogs, and friends' pooches!

My Siberian Husky gives these 2 paws waaay up! He absolutely loves them. I did make a couple of adjustments though. I doubled the peanut butter and pumpkin, and omited the salt. These are awesome and so easy to make.

Two suggestions: (1) don't even TRY to "whisk" these ingredients together, and (2) they should have listed "water" in the ingredients list; it's key.  Treat this recipe as pie dough - put everything but the water in your stand mixer bowl (I hope you have one - it works wonders!) and mix, then add water a TBSP at a time until the dough pulls together and is "workable."  Then, dump the dough out and roll it.  I didn't need to add more pumpkin or peanut butter or anything - this was a very easy recipe.  (I forgot to add the salt, but I don't think the dog minded!)  I cut the dough into tiny Christmas shapes before baking.  I think I need to play around with the baking temps and times, because like my first dog biscuit attempt, I couldn't get these do be totally 100% dry and crunchy.  Mind you, the dog still loved them and treated them like "special treats," taking them to another room to enjoy.

These are so cute! I cut them into miniature gingerbread men shapes. I used about 15 oz of pumpkin, 3 huge tablespoons of peanut butter (my puppies LOVE peanut butter), and I added about 2 tablespoons of molasses, 1/2 cup of instant oats and about 2 tablespoons of ground flax seeds. It ended up making ALOT of puppy treats, so that's what my puppies are giving to their friends for Christmas! Thanks for the recipe!

Healthy biscuits loved by all six dogs!  I didn't want to throw away a partial can of pumpkin, so revised recipe to use the whole 15 oz:  1 can pumpkin, 6 heaping tbsp peanut butter, 4 eggs, 5 cups flour, 1 tsp cinnamon.  I don't put salt in anything, and the dogs didn't miss it.

I used my stand mixer and added small amounts of water, as suggested.  I needed to flour the board well to keep it from sticking, but it otherwise was easy to cut with cookie cutters (WalMart has a nice set in the cake designing section that consists of a dog bone, a dog and a paw print.

They smell awesome, too.  I put two bags in the freezer, where they kept beautifully and came out just as well as the portion I didn't freeze.  Better than anything I've purchased commercially and much cheaper, too.

The dogs loved these! I looked up every ingredient to make sure they were safe for dogs, and sure enough, they were. I added blueberries, (also safe for dogs). I used paw print, bone, and dog shaped cookie cutters. The dogs come running every time they hear the treat jar open now. They can't get enough of these!

I loved making these treats. As a Doxie Mommy it is hard to find treats that will fit her small little mouth. With this i can. However i did have to change it up a bit. The Doughwas to dry. So i added a cup of pumpkin and 3/8 cup peanut butter and it was perfect. If you plan on making them small instead of 40 mins do 15mins and it was perfect.

My puppies LOVE these.  Whenever we have puppy-buddies over for play dates I make them as a special treat.  Giving dogs pumpkin every day keeps them 'regular'.  If you give them a pumpkin cookie before bed time you are guaranteed to have an easy 'walk' first thing in the morning.  There are a few things that I tend to do differently.  I use stone ground whole wheat flour.  I had a bag that I never used because it was too course, but it is great for the dog treats, my dogs prefer it.    Also I open a big can of pumpkin and use half of it in this recipe (a little over a cup) and the other half in human treats (pumpkin-spice cupcakes).  And finally, for training treats, and this takes a little practice, keep adding flour 1/2 cup at a time while blending with your electric beater.  When the batter goes to a popcorn-like consistency pull out the bite size pieces and put on your cookie sheet.  You have to ball up the rest yourself or you can roll it out and cut it like the recipe calls for.  I haven't bought training size treats since I found this recipe!

My dogs loved these cookies. I added more pumpkin and added some water because the dough was too dry. I didn't have whole wheat flour so i just used all purpose.

Pups loved it!  (Pumpkin is supposed to make dogs STOP eating their poop, so i was looking for recipes for our baby who doesn't seem to get the 'drop it and walk away' idea.  She devoured these!)

I have tried this recipe twice - once keeping to the original recipe and once using others suggestions.  Both times, the dough has come out extremely sticky.  Although they taste good, it is very frustrating to work with, I will not be making these again.

What a great little doggie treat! Made 2 batches of these today... one batch turned out & the other one didn't! While I value other reviewer's input, I must say that the most helpful reviews were not that helpful at all. For my 1st batch, I did as many reviewers suggested and doubled up on the pumpkin (I had a lg. can in my pantry). What a COLOSSAL MISTAKE!!! DO NOT DO THIS! Your dough will be WAAY too sticky to roll out (assuming you are cutting your doggie treats into shapes & not rolling into a log / cutting as Kelly's recipe directs...). I had so much trouble, I had to toss everything! Not defeated in the least, I followed Kelly's directions to the letter on my 2nd attempt w/ EXCELLENT results! Many have complained that as is, this dough is too stiff for their mixers. I have a KitchenAid, and even w/o adding H2O (no need), I had no problems at all. Here's the trick (pretty much common sense, IMHO). If your mixer seems to be slowing down or having difficulty mixing, STOP (duh) & knead by hand! Using my new dog bone / Scottie dog cutters (Cmas gifts), I made 24 treats / 12 of ea. shape. My westie, Finn, LOOOOOVED these! I think he was surprised when I gave him a bone, but he happily ate it haha! Finn's usual dog treats are sm. (pellet-sized), so this was a REAL treat for him (and the reason he seemed confused lol). Thanks for sharing your idea, Kelly. Sir Finn thanks you VERY much (and is licking the crumbs from the floor as I write my review!)!!! :-)

My rescued princess labrador who won't eat anything gobbled these up. We increased the pumpkin to 1 cup, added 1/2 cup oats, and increased peanut butter to 3T. Made small shapes. Baked 15 minutes and let cool for 5 minutes on the baking sheet. So easy my 5 year old LOVED making these. Very forgiving recipe.

The dogs went wild over this recipe - but many people have commented on mold problems. Think of these like you would bread - there is a short shelf life. Mold is a result of moisture - commercial dog treats are very dry all the way through and are probably full of preservatives. These treats need to be completely dried out to avoid mold. I turned the oven off and left them to cool in the oven. Even then, they were still a little moist inside, so I put them back in a hot oven, turned it off, and let them sit for another 30 minutes - this dried them out really well - they were totally crispy, and they were fine for a week in zip-lock bags. Think cracker, not cookie. If you live in a damp climate, you might want to freeze or refrigerate them.

I am rating the actual recipe WITHOUT all of the tweaks the other reviewers have suggested. Let me just say right off, I made these twice b/c the first time, I screwed up. Not Kelly (the recipe poster), not the ingredients listed, not my oven but me.  I realized (as I was making the 2nd batch) that I did not put in the correct amount of flour and I also used a 'natural/organic' peanut butter that was very oily, tacky, and sticky so already not having enough flour, that type of PB made things worse.  I saw where another reviewer said hers was sticky as well - maybe she did what I did?  Regardless, I made it exactly the way the recipe called for the 2nd time around and it turned out perfectly.  The dough was "dry and stiff" like Kelly  said it would be; I even added "water as needed" just as Kelly suggested to do; I did everything spot on. These treats look and feel just like regular store bought dog treats do except I know where all the ingredients came from and what's in them.  Most importantly, my dogs love them.  My advice, follow the exact recipe and they'll turn out just fine.  (I will post pics of what the dough should look like before hand & of the treats after baking)

My dog loves these and really enjoyed getting to eat the "cookie batter" while I was making them. I didn't have trouble with the batter being too dry, but that may be because I mixed it by hand at the end.  If you knead like bread it it comes together quite nicely.

This dough is so easy to handle.  I roll it out and score it with a pizza cutter to make small pieces.  Rather than cook at the higher temp, I cook on 250 (convection oven) for about an hour. Then I turn it down to 170 and let them dry out for a couple of hours...kind of like dehydrating.  I love to make them.  My dogs love to eat them.

Still trying to understand those that gave poor reviews for this delicious dog treat because their dogs ended up in vet care. Not because of the ingredients, but because those dogs wolfed them down and they got stuck and required vet care. Aren't they embarrassed by their stupidity? My dogs love these and I too, have one that rarely bothers with chewing when she's delighted by a treat like these. You folks giving low stars because your dog choked or it got stuck or what have you, has NOTHING to do with this recipe and you should rate the recipe accordingly. Either break up your treats more, supervise them more closely, or look into trading your dog(s) in for a pet that allows for such recklessness; say goldfish or a pet rock. I have five AKC Havanese (two pups about to be adopted) and they all LOVE these. I'm going to include some in my puppy packs when the new families come to collect their babies. Honestly, I get so frustrated by people who look elsewhere for blame that lies with them. It's why our country has become so litigious and the courts are choked with frivolous lawsuits. Lol, that was far too much information  Sorry. Fantastic recipe!

For safety reasons please read this review!  I made these for my four dogs that literally range in size from a toy Pomeranian to a Great Dane.  Instead of doing a dog bone shape, I did a medium sized cat shape.  All four dogs loved these treats and went crazy for them...I mean REALLY crazy. In the chaos of getting these treats, my medium sized rescue dog swallowed one of these whole and it got stuck in his esophagus.  He was hospitalized, and our vet bill was $1,000.00.  I wanted to give these five stars because the dogs really loved them, but I want people to be aware of how much they love them!  I would recommend making them small in size or tearing them into smaller bites when feeding them to your furry friends.  It has been over a week and my dog is doing great, but it was really scary.  I just wanted others to be aware that these treats may be too good!

I love these treats - and so does my dog!   I have also substituted Sweet Potato and Squash puree for the pumpkin, whatever is in season and I've had excellent results.  I sometimes add whole oats and/or ground flax seed for extra nutrition and I always get great results and my sweet Bella goes gaga over these; she stands guard in the kitchen when I make them, she intuitively knows I am making something for her.  I only bake them until they are nice and golden brown about 30 - 40 minutes and then I shut off the oven and leave them in so they get nice and crunchy.  I like that these have no milk or milk powder in them as they last much longer without molding.  Also, the dough freezes beautifully (I like to split the dough in half; bake one and freeze the other half).  Thanks for posting this wonderful recipe!

I made these, they turned out fine, but my Tibetan Terrier is picky and i really don't think i will make again.  She wasn't impressed. This is the only reason I gave the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 (due to her pickyness; if she would have liked, I would have given 5 stars.  If you have a big dog that will eat anything and everything, this would be a fun recipe to make to please your pet, or give as Christmas present pet treats for your  friends that have a non-picky dog.  I froze the extra treats for later in hopes to see if she will eat later, or give to one of my friends that has a less picky pooch.  Update: Tried to give her one today...and no change..as I said she is really picky..so now will give to friends.

I made these a few weeks ago and my dog really enjoyed them.  I just rolled them into little balls and squished them down, like thumb print cookies.

Great wholesome treats for the pet-family member.  I upped the pumpkin to a full cup which then made them a little tricky to use as cutout "cookies" - so I just chilled the dough a little bit, rolled them into logs and sliced them.  The dog didn't care one bit what they looked like!  She gobbled them up!

My dogs loved them! I couldn't keep them out of the kitchen while I was making them. I did add1/2 cup oats instead of 1/2 cup of the flour just because I had some.
NOTE: I kept mine in a tupperware container and by the second day they had mold on them and I had to throw them away. I'm not sure why

my dogs love the treats, however, I am wondering how long a shelf life they have.  I am very busy and usually like to bake large batches and store them.  How long are they good for?

The dogs loved them. I did add more peanut butter than the recipe called for. I also used beef broth and some bacon fat to make it extra tasty. I recommend this recipe to all pet parents who want to do something special for their canine friends.

My dogs love these. We make them all the time. They do mold if you keep them out so we cut them all up and store them in the freezer and then take out what we need for a couple days and store in the fridge. It's so great to know just what's going into your treats and they're much cheaper to make than the natural ones you buy at stores.

these turned out pretty well! i made the addition of an extra tablespoon of peanut butter and left out the salt, but otherwise, followed the rest as written. a lot of reviewers wrote about increasing the pumpkin to a cup, but a few wrote about how that made the dough too sticky/difficult to work with. i started out with the recommended half cup and it seemed fine...definitely made a stiff dough, but you need it that consistency if you want to be able to roll it out easily. i used fresh pureed pumpkin, so that may have made the dough easier to work with since it's not as dry as the canned variety...i would suggest starting with the 1/2c and adding more as you go until you get a consistency you like. i whisked everything but the flour together, then used a wooden spoon to incorporate the flour and then my hands to knead it a bit before rolling out. i have 2 little dogs, 1 of which is a slightly picky eater who doesn't typically like biscuits. i was surprised that she ate it, although she didn't seem too excited about it...the other 1 gobbled them up :) i only baked mine for about 1/2 an hour and they didn't come out completely hard (partially because i thought the picky eater wouldn't like them as much if they were hard), so i'm not sure how these will keep...

I can't speak for how these taste to the dogs, but mine ate one happily.  I had a great time making these with my 3 yr. old granddaughter! They are not messy, and very easy to make.  It makes plenty, so I sent her home with half for her doggies to enjoy & she can show daddy what she made. We made little 'peanut butter cookie' ones with the criss-cross design.  Very fun, very easy! Thank you for a nice recipe.

My 2 dogs loved these!  I changed the recipe only slightly.  I added the whole can of pumpkin, and about 1 extra cup of flour to make the consistency correct. I used 3 heaping tablespoons (and I mean a table spoon, no measuring going on with the peanut butter) of peanut butter like another reviewer suggested.   I also added about 2 tablespoons of flax seeds and a drizzle of honey.  This made about 50 or so medium bone shaped treats.  I keep a small bag in the fridge and froze the rest to take out as needed.    For the price paid for store bought treats these are much better, super easy to make and the dogs love 'em.

I've made dog biscuits in the past, but didn't have my recipe handy so I tried this one. This is honestly a GREAT recipe as-is, but is also a perfect "base" recipe for customizing to suit special diets and preferences. I made a batch as directed, then made a 2nd batch with dried parsley sprinkled into the dough. I also sprinkled some ground flax seed on top before baking. Turned out great, and my mom's schnauzer loved them! Next time, I plan to add an extra tablespoon or two of peanut butter. This recipe is a keeper and will replace my old recipe, which was good, but not this good! 

A few tips on mixing: Don't whisk the dough. Instead, stir the dry ingredients together in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs and the rest of the wet ingredients. Then stir the wet into the dry. Knead to thoroughly mix before rolling out. Don't add water except as an absolute last resort, because it'll ruin the crunch factor. You want this to be a very dry dough that can be kneaded, rolled-out and cut without sticking to anything. If it sticks, add more flour. Leftover pieces can be rolled into snake-shapes and cut into small kibbles for snacks and baked on the same sheet as the cut-out "cookies" for 40 minutes.

As another review suggested, I wish I would have used a full cup of canned pumpkin as the dough was very stiff. Did add water as suggested to make dough workable but maybe wouldn't have to with the moisture from more pumpkin puree. I also rolled the dough to 1/4" thick as the 1/2" seemed too thick but watch carefully while baking. Was concerned about the cinnamon & found out (in moderation) the spice is good for dogs. To name just a few benefits; it has antibacterial properties, cleanses microorganisms from stomach & intenses and anti-inflammatory properties. Bottom-line, my dog loves these treats & I love not paying$$$ so much for treats!

I make all my dog, Matthias "Mattie" treats.  He is a Pitbull/Boxer rescue who is allergic to grass, trees, weeds, goldenrod, ragweed, dust and wool to name some of them.  Anyway, I have a recipe similar to this one, but I use rice flour instead of wheat flour.  It is better for the dogs and if you think your dog might have any food allergies, stay away from wheat until you know. I also add organic or raw honey to this recipe, it is excellent for dogs as it is full of antioxidants! Also, just s note, pumpkin is great for dogs when they get loose stool because of all the fiber!  :)

My golden doodle will wait in the kitchen by the oven for these treats to finish baking!  She absolutely loves them!!  I read through a few of the reviews and just as others I made a few adjustments.  I used 3cups of flour, 1 complete can of pumpkin, a couple of extra dabs of PB and finally 1 extra dash of cinnamon.  Annabelle (the doodle) is in love with these!!!  This recipe is super simple and works well with my Kitchenaid mixer.  The dough is tacky, but once you flour your surface, wipe your hands with a touch of oil your then ready to begin rolling your dough.  I found very inexpensive doggie bone cutouts through Amazon...I couldn't be more pleased.  I'm one proud doodle mom with a healthy treat in my recipe box!

First let me say these need to be stored in the fridge.  I just made mine about 4 days ago and stored them in an air-tight container but they are all moldy today.  They were really enjoyed by my little dog while they were good, though.  I think next time I will freeze them and only take out a few at a time.

I doubled this recipe as we have two big dogs, an Akita/German Shepherd cross and a Rottweiler/Pit Bull
cross and keeping them in store bought treats is super expensive.  I used an entire 15 oz can of pumpkin and 4 HEAPING tablespoons of peanut butter.  I rolled the dough, half at a time into a rectangle shape about 1/2 " thick and cut into 1"x1" squares.  After baking for 40 minutes I let the cookies sit in a low 200 degree oven until they were completely  hard.  I ended up with about 100 treats and the dogs love them!

My 3 dogs loved these treat, however I made some changes. I increased the peanut butter to 3 tbs, the pumpkin to 3/4 a cup, and added a 1/2 cup oats. I also added more flour to make them less sticky. I cut them into little bones and only need to bake them for 30 minutes. I will be making these again!

My yorkies love these treats.  One of my dogs is gluten intolerent so I used rice flour instead of wheat.  I also rollled pieces of dough into long tubes (like fat spaghetti) and cut into small bite sized pieces - perfect for my tiny pups.

If your dog is a 'gulper' beware. We made these on Christmas Eve. Our 10 year  westie gulped one and ended up with it lodged in his esophagus.  We had to take him in for an emergency endoscopy. $2400 treat.  The dogs all loved the taste.  He has always gulped his food. I don't know why this treat got stuck.

I put these in my dehydrator after baking and dried them even more. They last longer and my dogs, all three, love them

My boston terrier loves these treats. I made them with the exact measurements listed and they came out perfectly. I mixed all ingredients in my trusty Kirchenaid stand mixer until well combined. I then added a little bit of water and allowed ingredients to mix thoroughly. You really do need to add only a bit( a Tablespoon give or take) if you allow the water to be distributed. Bonus: baking these makes your house smell great!

This was my dog, Valkyrie's, favorite recipe. I used small dog bone shapes. It even won over our older retriever mix who is picky. I changed the pumpkin to one cup and doubled the peanut butter, plus added some molasses. It made them softer. All the dogs went nuts wanting more.

I put all the ingredients into the food processor and pulsed it like you would a tart crust.  Didn't need a bit of water and the dough came together nicely and was a snap to roll out.

My dog loves these! She drools every time I pull one out.  Since I know she doesn't care how the treats are shaped, I usually roll the dough out and then use a pizza cutter to slice it into squares. Takes a fraction of the time it would to use a cookie cutter.

My dog refuses store bought biscuits, but he loves these.  I baked some for holiday gifts, and apparently they came out well, because my dog is obsessing over them.

I had a huge pumpkin that I forgot to carve for Halloween so I cut it up and roasted it til tender. Once it was done I cut the 'skin' off, chopped it up and pureed some of it for this recipe. The rest of the pumpkin is in my freezer to use for future peanut butter & pumpkin dog treats :) This was fun to make for my pup! For some reason I only had 1 cookie cutter...my fur-child is enjoying his peanut butter & pumpkin snowmen :) Thanks for the recipe!!

I made this a while ago for my dog, my mom's dog, and my brother-in-law's two dogs. (3 of them weigh less than 15 lbs and the other is a BIG lab) I doubled the recipe, and while it looked like a lot of treats, it was just the right amount. I made them in the shape of little gingerbread men and the dogs loved them! And I loved that they didn't make my house smell funky! =]

I thought these turned out great! I went to two grocery stores and neither of them had any pumpkin, so I just substituted the pumpkin for bananas. I also doubled the recipe, so I used 3 whole smashed bananas. My dogs loved them! I will definitely be making these again. Will try with pumpkin when I find some!

Modified slightly to be gluten-free. Used oat flour instead of wheat flour (1.5c oat flour for every 1c wheat flour). Also added a quarter cup extra pumpkin and a quarter cup extra peanut butter. I let them bake for approximately 20 minutes longer to ensure crispness throughout, but checked on them every 5 minutes beyond the 40 min to make sure they weren't burning. My little guy loves them and my coworkers dog does too (who up until now would never eat non meat based treats)!  Perfectly tasty, healthy, easy, and affordable dog treat!

This was an amazing recipe! My two dogs absolutely loved them! I have a Rottweiler and Shih Tzu. My Shih Tzu can be picky with treats sometimes and she went crazy when she ate these! I added a whole cup of pumpkin, 3 table spoons of peanut butter and it was a little dry so I just added a tablespoon or so of water. I recommend these treats!

My dogs love this recipe. I made it in small cookie round shape. They go so crazy for them and sit by the stove the whole time they are being made. If you are looking for a healthy recipe this is one. I have 2 Dachshunds and a Morkie, so finding treats that all 3 like and can eat was hard until this recipe.

Made the recipe for my dogs and others for Christmas presents. I know that pumpkin is good for dogs if they have an upset stomach, so I was glad to use it in this recipe. I added a bit more flour as I was kneading the dough just to make it tougher and not stick to my rolling pin. Not sure how thick mine were, but they were perfectly done after about 25 minutes in the oven. Definitely will make again!! After sampling some of the treats once they were cooled from the oven, my dogs followed me around for the rest of the day!

I've made this recipe twice, once using a food processor and once with a stand mixer/dough hook. Definitely easier with the stand mixer and I only need a few tablespoons of water to make it workable.  Like everyone mentioned, use a full cup of pumpkin.  They do not take 40 minutes, more like 30 minutes, but depends on the size of cookie cutter you use.  Small bone shaped cutter bakes quicker than a large bone shaped cutter.  Doggie loves 'em.

An easy-to-prepare treat which puppy loves. when i knead the dough, i use my bare hands to give the treats a little flavor of "me", which helps develop the connection way more than store-bought treats. Excellent for training. Recipe doesn't say, but about 1/4 cup of water added slowly while mixing the ingredients helps form the dough-like consistency during preparation.

Bailey Girl knew she would love these, because she loves, Loves, LOVES pumpkin!  She stood in the kitchen, tail wagging and drooling all over the floor, while I made these for her.  I increased the pumpkin, cinnamon, and peanut butter amounts.  Also, the flour had to be increased to make the batter workable.  The folks who have been able to whisk the ingredients have my admiration.  I couldn't do it.  But, the end product made up for the sticky batter.  Bailey says thank you for posting this recipe.

very easy to make, I did change the recipe a bit. I added peanuts, I used beef boulion instead of water almost a cup, and omitted the pumpkin plus more peanut butter. These were fun to make! We were able to shape the dough into all kinds of shapes like little paw prints. cute!

This is a fantastic recipe, the dogs went nuts over them. I added shredded apple instead of the water for flavor and moisture, as well as the addition of small amount of molasses as advised by another viewer. Made three batches so far for all my friends with canine buddies.

I had some left over canned pumpkin, so I decided to make this recipe so 'everyone' would have something for thanksgiving! Like many, I doubled the pumpkin to one cup and used three heaping tablespoons full of peanutbutter. I also didn't have any whole wheat flour, so I used all-purpose. It turned out great! All of the puppies LOVED them!!! I will definately be making this recipe over and over again! Great all natural treat!!

I do add some water toward the end to help the wheat flour mix better, and usually use 3 medium eggs for moisture also.  I bought doggie bone shaped cookie cutters specifically for this recipe!

My dog is obsessed. I have 3 small poodles and a German shepherd/Aussie mix, and one of my poodles can't get enough of them. He got a small taste of the dough that fell on the floor and has been hooked ever since. He's clawing at the table they're sitting on right now. I definitely agree to add a full cup of pumpkin, 4 tablespoons of peanut butter and get rid of the salt. I could probably train my dogs to do anything with these treats as a reward!

These were easy to make and my dogs loved them. I didn't have any pumpkin so I used chicken broth as a substitute.

Made these with some leftover pumpkin I had. It was about a cup so I had to add more flour. Skipped the salt. Both of my chihuahuas highly approved!

My pug, who is pretty picky about his treats, really loves these. I, too, increased the pb and pumpkin, and I cooked them fewer minutes to make them softer. I also brushed on melted bacon grease a few minutes before they were done.

I gave this recipe to my sister (a beginner cook) to make for her beloved chihuahua. She followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great! She even made enough to share with my 3 dogs (2 dachshunds and a pit bull). They loved them! Thanks! 16 PAWS UP! :)

Suzy & Missy say "WAY TO GO!!".  They love these things.  I did take one reviewer's advice and used my mixer and I'm glad.  A whisk would not have worked.  I probably added 1/4 cup water as well.  The dogs love them and are anxiously waiting to go next door and share with their friends!

Five paws up!  Doubled the peanut butter and pumpkin.  Others were correct in that eventually it is the consistency of pie dough.  Let it sit a bit and it gets firmer.  You could roll this out or drop by spoonfuls.  Thanks for sharing!  A keeper!

My dogs love these cookies. I increased the pumpkin to 3/4 cup and doubled the Peanut Butter. Best way to make them is roll them out on Parchment Paper and cut with a pizza cutter, place on a baking sheet and throw them in the oven. I've been making them every weekend since Halloween. They don't last in my house.

My dog is in love with these things. She loves crunchy stuff and these defiantly are crunchy and hard. I will definitely be making them again although for whatever reason mine took twice as long as the recipe said to cook. Maybe my thickness was off? Will be cooking them thinner next time and think I'll give them out as a Xmas gift to all my friends with puppies

I have a lot of canned pumpkin left over from the holidays and this was a perfect way to use it up. I used a whole can of pumpkin, 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour and quick oats. 2 eggs, 2 Tablespoon of PBS and a shake of cinnamon. It was too soft to roll out. Kinda like a thick oatmeal cookie mix. So I made them like drop cookies. About a half teaspoon (my baby is still a baby) then pressed flat with my fingers. Baked them at 350 for almost 30 min or so. I kept checking to make sure they wouldn't burn but got dry. My little chug Arianna, LIVES them. Everything I go into the kitchen she follows me hoping I will give her another one. LOL I will definitely make these again . Super simple as drop cookies. Very little fuss.

I just made this gluten free for my girls and they turned out great!  I used a 1/2 inch apple corer for the cutter.  I used all purpose GF flour plus a 1/2 cup of oat flour; 1 extra Tbsp peanut butter, 1 cup pumpkin; 4 Tbsp water (to start) and blended it in a food processor until I had a smooth ball the consistency of actual cookie dough.  This recipe made about 300 treats.  Keep in mind, I'm a hack baker.

My babies love these.  I always include 4 Tbsp of liquid Glucosamine, my guys are older.  The pumpkin is perfect for my Boxer who has arthritis in is hips.  He has a sensitive stomach and even with the added meds he is just fine.  I did add about 3 tbsp more pumpkin and I did mix by hand.

This recipe was easy to follow and my dogs LOVED the treats!  I used the suggestions below and added one cup of pumpkin instead of the half cup, along with the rolled oats and a extra tablespoon of peanut butter. I baked them for only fifteen minutes, as I used extremely small cookie cutters. I also outlined them with dog friendly peanut butter frosting for that extra kick of something special after they were cooled.

This recipe was AMAZING!!  the treats are so healthy, that I don't care how many my finicky little Westie has.  I no longer have to shop for treats.

I doubled the recipe and upped the pumpkin and PB.  I used the following proportions:
5 cups of flour (ground an entire can of oatmeal in the food processor)
One entire 15 ounce can of pumpkin
one tsp cinnamon
one tsp salt
half cup or so of PB
4 eggs
Didn't even try to mix it, just squished with my fingers, until color and texture were uniform.  (also have thrown in cooked leftover brown rice)

I rolled it out on 2 cookie sheets (oiled) baked for 30 mins, and cut them with a pizza cutter to 1/2 inch squares.  Baked a little more after cutting,. Then freeze them until ready to use, a handful at a time. 
My westie eats them frozen, or I can nuke them a little.

LOVE!!!!

PS - when my westie has diarrhea, these are the very efficient remedy. And she gladly takes her meds.

My Golden, Katie LOVES these biscuits! I swear she knows when I'm making them! She comes into the kitchen and waits patiently until she can lick the bowl. I switched oat flour for the wheat flour since she can't have wheat because of allergies. Also used a puppy sized dog bone cookie cutter to cut them out so the yield is 85 treats for the one recipe! I will definitely make this recipe again for my girlie!!

These treats were easy enough to make, although the batter tried to creep up the mixer and then was insanely sticky to spoon onto the trays. But even though my dog seemed to like them, I wont be making them again. After they had cooled I stored them in air tight containers...and it's only been 5 days and they're all covered in mold. My dog only ate them at most 3 times.

Upped the pumpkin to 1 cup and needed to add a good bit of extra flour to make the dough workable. Oh well. :) Used the apple slicer to cut out triangle shapes and baked for 25 minutes. Thanks!

Great recipe! Dogs love them. Although, now one dog wont eat their dinner and is demanding treats instead. I changed the recipe a bit to make it healthier. I used flax seed meal instead of flour and doubled the amount of pumpkin and peanut butter. I didn't put salt in it because dogs shouldn't be eating much salt. I also used all organic ingredients.

Easy recipe. My puppy really enjoys them. I am too lazy to roll and cut into shapes, so I just spread it on a jelly roll pan and cut them with a pizza cutter after baking for 25 min for a chewier treat. I did add 1/2 cup rolled oats. This is much cheaper than buying treats!

love this recipe! i actually add 3/4-1 cup pumpkin and 3 tblsp of peanut butter and i never have to add any water. the dough is so workable. i think they r crunchier when i dont cut them the 1/2 in. thick. i do 1/4 to 1/3 and bake same amount of time and they are nice and crunchy. i also use 3 to 4 inch dog bones and can get nearly 40 treats out of the recipe.

These were awesome - my doggie is hooked. I baked for our Italian Greyhound get together and half loved them and half didn't care for them. I think if your dog likes peanut butter, this will work for you. They were easy to bake and I used Christmas cutouts so I can give to our doggie friends. Thanks for sharing this one.

The first time I tried these the dough turned out sticky, but I baked them in a sheet pan and cut them into squares anyway.  My dogs loved them so much that I'm back to try it again, although I still think I'll stick with the sheet pan method rather than the roll and cut out method :)
=====
Tried these again and they still came out sticky :/
I wonder if it's because I'm using white flour instead of wheat - but either way, my dogs are so crazy for these things that I'm going to keep making them!

I left out the cinnamon and salt and used 1 cup of pumpkin and 1/4 cup peanut butter. I used 1/2 cup oats in place of some of the whole wheat flour. My dog Sorcha loved these (a husky/shepherd mix). Definitely a keeper.

It was hard to rate this recipe. I guess my dog seems to like them but I think he'd like anything given to him by either of us. I tasted the cookie to see if it was good. Being a runner this cookie would've been good for a munching snack but it tastes awful!!!! I cant even taste the pumpkin, which I increased to one cup) or the peanut butter.

Learn from my experience! I had 1/2 cup canned organic pumpkin and a few tablespoons of store brand "natural" peanut butter to use up. The dough was very sticky and wet. I eventually added at least one more cup of whole wheat flour to make it pliable enough to roll and use with cookie cutters. My dog friend will try them tonight.

So easy to prepare! I didn't have any difficulty mixing and didn't need to add water. I mixed all ingredients minus 1/2 cup flour. I then turned it onto my countertop and kneaded in the remaining flour. I cut into squares with my pizza cutter. Fantastic recipe!

Love this recipe. Simple and easy. The dough kept its shape nicely for my halloween cookie cutters. I did have to add two extra tablespoons of peanut butter and another 1/2 cup of pumpkin plus a smidge. Did not use the salt and used pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon for a more fall smell. I rolled the dough to 1/8 inch and decreased the cooking time to 30-35 minutes. If you use large cookie cutters pierce them with a fork a couple of times - its keeps them from bubbling.  I made these for my dogs and pet sitting clients. My dogs love them and I'm sure the rest of my canine friends will too :-D !!! LOL

I've had this recipe bookmarked since last year. I have been the favorite human at the dog park since every dog I've met LOVES these cookies! I too double the pumpkin and they smell so much better if you use fresh pumpkin instead of the canned mush! I also use leftover pumpkin puree to top dog food and watch that kibble disappear like never before!

I chose to leave out the spices and I cut the baking time way back (my treats still were burned).  My dog liked them well enough but these treats didn't come close to how excited she gets over Zazz bones.

I made these today after I had planned on making some that contained broth, I read the ingredients and all of the flavors of Broth have onion in them,   My dog loves these treats, we have always given him a treat after he has asked to go out "like a good boy" twice today he went out and just stood by the door a minute then scratched with his paw to come back in, Just for another cookie :-)

Embers couldn't eat this treat fast enough! She absolutely devoured it - I think it's safe to say that this is a five-star recipe! Besides the puppy's approval, I was happy how easy the dough was to work with. I rolled the treats out to about 1/4 inch thickness and ended up with at least 50!

My standard dachshund (pictured!) loves these treats! I've also given them as gifts to friends who have big and little dogs, who reportedly also enjoyed the treats. Don't know if they were just being polite, but one of the great things about making your own treats is that people think it's hard. I've made these 4 times.   I'm trying to keep my wiener dog slim, so I did not add extra peanut butter. I omitted the salt and the cinnamon.  I also used egg whites instead of a whole egg. I did add some flax seeds (about 1/3 cup, ground or whole) and some quick oats, which helped absorb extra water from the mashed pumpkin I used (I steamed mine).   I've also substituted apple sauce for the pumpkin. I had to add more flour to compensate for the extra moisture, but the resulting treats were just as well received. You could probably also use blueberries, spinach, and carrots. Just be careful of baking time, as some fruits have higher sugar content and will brown/burn faster.   Pizza cutter tip was great! I have also used tiny, tiny aspic cutters to create cute shapes for gifting batches.

Even the most discriminating of my for legged friends LOVED these!  I made them into little balls and then smooshed them with a fork...like little PB cookies.  I really didn't measure anything and the dough still came out beautifully...just mix/knead in flour until its the consistency of play-dough.  They baked perfectly on my SPEED bake setting in 20 minutes.  I think the speed setting cuts the bake time down by half or so.

My picky shih tzu gobbled these up. I made another treat for her before which she wouldnt touch, but to my surprise, she really enjoyed these and was willing to eat them. i added double the pumpkin. the only thing is they came out a little hard, but maybe she likes them that way. i kept them in a sealed container and once my bf opened it, not knowing they were dog treats and said they smelled really good, he was tempted to eat one, i said...they're dog treats....hahaha

I must have rolled these too thin - the first batch burned to a crisp! Used mini holiday cookie cutters to make for friends. Easy to make - just throw everything into your stand mixer and let it go! I suggest lowering the oven temp and bake longer at a lower temp to avoid the burning. Also, rotate or flip during baking. My subsequent batches turned out much better using the lower temp/longer bake time method.

Fabulous!  Our dog, Magnolia loves them & so do our friends' dogs.  I ended up rolling out the dough & cutting dog bone shapes out of it & they baked perfectly... however I did have to watch for some burning on the tips.  The water wasn't necessary to  make the dough workable.  They came out great & I will definitely make them again!!!

this was very easy to make, i didnt add any water to it and i only added one egg (only had one on hand).  I have a 2 month old puppy and we are teaching him how to sit and once i made these helike them so much that he learned in no time at all. i also added extra pumpkin, probably the reason for not needing any water

My dogs loved these! I gave them one each earlier in the day before their evening feeding time and decided I would give them one each again after their evening meal. Wow, you should see the way my dogs were jumping when they saw these in my hand! I can tell they really enjoyed them and I like that they were easy to put together. I used homemade pumpkin puree and had no need to add water to the dough. It did seem stiff but I kneaded it till I felt the dough was workable and to my liking - worked perfectly! My dogs are totally happy you posted this recipe and so am I. Thanks!

I made these for my dogs and dog guests for a doggie DNA party.  I upped the pumpkin to 1 cup and the peanut butter to 1/2 cup.  I used no salt or cinnamon.  I rolled them and cut them into various shapes (hearts, dog bones, dog houses, etc.) and baked at 350 degrees for 12 minutes--they would have burnt to a crisp after 40.  They smelled nice (I didn't try them) and the dogs LOVED them.  Six different dogs all tried these, ranging from Chihuahua, Collie, mixed breeds, Lab, and Akita and they ALL loved them.  Not one dog turned them down, even the picky Chihuahua.  100%, I will make these again.  Thanks for sharing this healthy and natural dog treat recipe!

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.  My daughter & g'daughters dogs as well as ours LOVE these treats, so much healthier for them that the type you buy in the store.  I did use 1/2 cup peanut butter and used a full can of pure pumpkin, also added 1/2 cup of applesauce.  These are a definite hit with my Chihuahua; she begs for them and ignores her Yip Yaps now.

This recipe is wonderful.  My dog has always battled a weight issue, so I was looking for a low fat recipe or at least one not calling for lard to be added. Not only does this recipe provide that but it also has pumpkin which provides a natural source of fiber.  I omit the salt to reduce the sodium.  My dog absolutely loves them!

My dog loves these treats! I added some honey and a little water to the dough. Once the dough was a good consistency, I rolled it out and used cookie cutters to make different shapes. My dog definitely prefers these over her store-bought treats.

I’m not the type of person to leave a review, so listen up fellow dog parents!!

My dog is very picky about his food and treats. I’ve had him for almost two years now and I’ve found ONE store bought treat that he enjoys. His treats are almost exclusively pieces of hot dogs now that I can’t find that treat in stores. I found this recipe and figured it’s easy & cheap enough that if he doesn’t like it, it won’t be a huge loss. BUT, he loves it. I have never ever seen him this excited about a treat. I especially love that I know exactly what is in the great!! I keep them in the house at all times and even take them to the dog park for other dogs. I have never met a dog that hasn’t loved this treat. You will not regret making this treat!

this is a great base recipe however I tweak mine a bit.. first I use only 2 cups of flour but use 1/2 cup of whole crushed oats to make up the 2.5 cups. as well I add  roughly 1 cup of pumpkin.  I do NOT add any water.. this dough has to be dry.. I roll mine also to about 1/4 inch not 1/2 and I bake for 42 minutes .. this produces a HARD cookie which is what you want.  I have made this recipe following original directions and cookies never fully get hard, I have cooked professionally for decades so I believe my tweaks are whats needed . I also roll my dough out between 2 pieces of parchment due to the fact as you roll the peanut butter oils will release and make things a bit sticky so rather than use extra flour to dust board an rolling pin I simply use 2 large pieces of parchment. also use a fork to puncture every cookie several times as this will help prevent them from puffing up and becoming hollow.   hope you enjoy.. I know the pups will .. =)

Great Recipe. Some Recommendations:  I made double batch so I used Kitchen Aid mixer with dough hook   at low speed when adding flour. Dough is stiff like bread dough, dough hook worked great, then kneaded extras together after cutting 1st batch out!  Baked ~60-70mins on parchment paper to assure "dry and crunchy"...Bone cookie cutter biscuit ~3.5"x0.75",  rolled to 0.375" thick, they did not burn!  Nicely baked and crunchy!  Dog loved them = 100% seal of approval.

I made this recipe several times, without changing ingredients, and giving out doggie bags to eager taste testers. Lots of tail wagging over this easy treat. I rolled out the dough the first time I made the recipe and used cookie cutters to form treats. Works great, but kind of time consuming. Another time, I just  formed a log in plastic wrap, chilled it in fridge, then sliced and baked in oven—very easy! Great recipe, and dogs love them!!

My dogs (one of which is super picky) loved these. The only changes I made were to double the peanut butter as well as adding a couple of tablespoons of bacon fat I had on hand. These changes are likely why the treats came out a little soft but my dogs gobbled them up. This seems like a good base recipe to experiment a little bit with.

These are great! My dogs love them! I followed the recipe exactly. 
Guys I need to say this. If your giving one star reviews because the dough is TOOOO STICKY then Im sorry but it’s deff YOU and not the recipe. Cuz this dough was the furthest thing from stick it didn’t even stick on my hands or on my rolling pin and not even on the cookie cutter. Eat cut was perfect and it was truly a no fuss recipe!

I LOVE my DOG! And I LOVE baking treats for her. But this recipe as it stands is a "Fail". I followed the recipe exactly but found it not only stiff, but way too much flour. Was I missing the water? No. There is no water listed in the recipe - *very* important!  Secondly, in addition to the ingredients ending up in a stiff, sticky mess, there is *no* way you can "whisk" these ingredient together as directed.  So... I added water. It took 2 T. of water to mix this into a nice, workable ball, but then it was still quite just a sticky goo-mess. But I did manage to get them rolled into little balls. If you take even 2 - 3 minutes to scan the other baker's comments, you'll find a *lot* of changes people made - either because the dough just wasn't the right consistency or because the measurements of the ingredients leaving extra ingredients remaining to be used.  Who uses a ½ cup of pumpkin in a recipe?  Now the extra is sitting in the frig. In the meantime, my pup literally went behind my office desk, heaved a heavy audible sigh, and fell asleep.  Poor Baby Girl!  They turned out okay, but it was not worth the hassle of having to adjust the recipe.  IF YOU WANT A WINNER – bake the PEANUT BUTTER and BANANA DOG BISCUITS RECIPE INSTEAD (and maybe substitute your pumpkin for the banana in those)!  I’ve made them four times, no fails, no hitches!  THOSE TAKE THE TROPHY!

My dogs love these. After making them several times, I've got the recipe where I want it. I double the pumpkin and peanut butter and omit the salt and cinnamon. The dough is quite sticky, but it's easy to roll out between sheets of parchment.

My dog and one of my cats love these treats.  I read other reviews and made modifications.  I used 1 cup of canned  pumpkin and 4 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter, leaving out the salt.  As I'm not a "true" baker and don't have fancy machinery, I just mashed all ingredients together in a large bowl with a fork until basically mixed and then used a hand mixer. The dough turned out soft and pliable so I used plenty of extra flour on my hands and rolling surface.  No water was needed.  Tasty!!

Super easy and quick! (Other than the baking time). I added a little bit of water, whisked it, and then used my hands to finish the mixing process. Made a lot too! My Newfoundland pup loves them.

I double the peanut butter and use a heaping 1/2 c of pumpkin. The dough is pliable and not very wet. I don’t need to add water. My dog LOVES these treats!  She is not like most dogs I’ve had that grab the food ourt of your hands and eat almost anything you offer. But she gets one cookie each morning, cut in fun shapes (bones, squirrel, dog). The cookie gets tucked into the arms of one of her dolls and it’s fun to watch her get excited about the cookie then use her paw to pull it out of the toy’s arms before grabbing it and running off to savor it in the living room.

The dogs go berserk when they know I’m pulling these out.  They even know when I’m making more and hover in the kitchen for a bite of the dough.   I did up the pumpkin and peanut butter.   I use organic natural peanut butter from Aldi (so reasonably priced) so I know they’re not getting anything bad for them.   I omit salt, too, because the peanut butter has a little added already.   I used cute cookie cutters at first but I make these so often now that I just roll them out and cut into squares with my pizza roller.   Also, when I ran out of treats AND whole wheat flour at the same time, I used a cup and a half of all-purpose flour and added a cup of old-fashioned oats I’d ground in my blender.   Worked fine and added some fiber.

I just made this recipe per the instructions - worse recipe I've ever made, and in my 56 yrs of baking I've made thousands+. Just now read the comments and how most everyone added more ingredients to make this recipe work. If they were all honest, they would have rated the recipe as it stands, not on how they had to create new recipes off of it to make something suitable. This is not a good recipe on it's printed merits.

Super easy to make! I made it per recipe and my dogs loved them! My teenage son smelled them baking and wanted to know what kind of dessert I was making. This recipe made (15) 3" bones and (12) 1.5" stars. One of my pups is allergic to poultry, so happy to have an alternative  to boxed dog biscuits for him!

I just finished making these with my 10 year old son... first time ever making dog treats... much easier than I thought. I read through a lot of the reviews and adapted this recipe to what I thought would be really awesome. NOTE:: My 10 year old had 1 condition on making these with me and that is that I allow him to try the treats. (LOL!) ... Sure! Why not? :)

I had a lot of extra pumpkin from last year - so perfect way to use it all up. Initially I thought it didn't sound like it would make very many large dog-bone shaped treats... so I doubled the recipe (I have 3 dogs). I figured I could freeze them to keep them longer, if it made too many. First round made about 70 cookies - which is probably realistically more like 1.5 batches. (I rolled the dough between 1/4 & 1/2 " thick).  Most important note - I was concerned the dough would be sticky and it WAS NOT sticky - not even a little bit. As a matter of fact, it was perfect to work and rework without having a big mess. 

Here are the changes I made (keep in mind I doubled the recipe, so if you adapt any - just split it in half). I used NO water - didn't need to, because I increased the pumpkin and Peanut butter. -- Added 2 cups of instant oats. -- Added 4 TBSP ground flax seed. -- Added an extra 1/4 c. Peanut butter (I doubled the original calling). -- Added 1 extra cup of Pumpkin (I doubled the original calling). -- Added 1 tsp baking powder. -- Added approximately 1/2 cup more Whole Wheat flour to get the dough to be dry

Very easy to make.  I follow recipe and will add just a few drops of water.  I oil my hands to keep the batter from sticking.  The best part- my pup loves them!  I will never buy another store bought treat again.  These smell so great when baking!

Definitely before rolling out the dough add some water. I also added some more peanut butter because my puppy loves it! He loves these treats and I made extra to give to some of his doggy friends! I will try to make this recipe again definitely a hit!

I've made these for my pups several times - they LOVE them.  I have also given them as gifts - the review every time is that their dogs are crazy about them.  Easy recipe - works well with large and smaller treats.  Can't go wrong with this one!

I used 3/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 cup pumpkin. I stirred liquid ingredients together first then added required flour, I hand kneaded the dough as I added in a little additional flour so the dough is not sticky and it won't stick to your roller or cookie cutter/counter. My dog loves them and ate them right up! And they smell good when cooking them!

Took CookinBug's advice and my cockapoos LOVED IT. Made a few adjustments:  used unbleached flour (some dogs are allergic) and to make them extra crunchy. My pups like their biscuits very crunchy-helps to clean their teeth. I rolled out the dough fairly thin and baked for an additional 10 minutes.  Shut off the oven and left them in there for another 5 minutes. Crunch perfection! Making another batch to use as Christmas gifts for the dogs on Santa's list. :)

I doubled the pumpkin and peanut butter. I also substituted wheat flour for Pillsbury gluten free multi purpose flour. My daughter has Celiac disease so most items in our home are gluten free, including dog food. This allows her to feed the dogs.  I have a Lab mix and a Chiweenie. They both LOVE this recipe!! The store bought treats (every brand) give them an upset tummy, I made the treats into a small circle and made thumbprints in the middle. I put a tiny amount of plain yogurt in the thumbprint, before I give it to the dogs. Healthy reward, great for training!! No tummy trouble !!

I doubled the batch and added extra peanut butter approximately 1/2 cup. I added ground flax meal about 1/3 cup which made the dough a little dry so I added water 1 tbsp. at a time instead of an extra egg to moisten the dough. It made approximately 2 -1/2 lbs. of biscuits and my dogs are 3 tails up for this recipe, it was like a feeding frenzy. I will definitely make this recipe again!

After reading a number of the reviews I decided to just go with the original recipe as published.  I used my food processor since I use it for my other dog treat recipe.  The only thing I had to change was I had to add extra moisture to get the dough to come together.  I added extra pumpkin until the dough was workable and it rolled out perfectly.  They baked up beautiful and are nice and crunchy, just like I wanted them.  Maggie, (my 4 year old canine baby) loves them!  I will definitely make them again and again.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made these several times and am now making a bunch as Christmas gifts for all the family dogs.  My dogs LOVE them.  I did increase the pumpkin to 1 C and rolled mine out smaller and it takes around 15-20 minutes to cook.  I have also used cookie cutters to make cute shapes for the dogs and it works out great.

My beagle-yellow lab puppy is grain free. She loves these treats even though they have brown rice flour in them. She doesn't have stomach problems with these. They are worth the time to make. We give them to her 2 times a day. I suggest refrigerating them because when we didn't mild grew on the treats and we had to throw out about 2 dozen treats.

Have made these several times and our dogs love them!  Only thing I change is that I use spelt flour instead of whole wheat.  I also find it's much quicker if I spread the dough out on a cookie sheet, bake it, and then cut it using a pizza cutter.  Not cute like cookie cutter shapes but the dogs don't seem to mind!!

Make these for Max, my labradoodle.  I, as many do, add extra pumpkin and peanut butter and if it's too sticky just add more flour or water as needed.  I also add chia seeds as these are really good for dogs.  Great recipe and Max loves them.  I don't roll them out...just take a small amount into a ball and then press down.  All cookie cutters are packed as we're getting ready to move.  Don't think Max minds not having a shape as long as he gets a treat.

Super easy.  Used my Kitchenaid mixer and started with 1.5 cups flour.  Then added more flour until it was "rolling" consistency.  Rolled to 1/4" and baked 45 minutes.  Turned off the oven and let them sit until they were cool and dry.  They taste like sweet biscuits.  Dogs are happy campers!

Made these for my two furry babies and they loved them.  I will have to make another batch as they are now gone.  Kept the recipe exactly as written and it worked well.  Cut them in bone shapes.  Something a little different with the pumpkin but they loved them and they are also good for them.

2 Paws Up from my lab/hound cross! I decreased the flour to 2 cups and added 3/4 cup of oatmeal, and I used 2 tbsp PB2 (powdered peanut butter) plus 2 tbsp organic coconut oil instead of regular peanut butter.  I only needed about 1/3 cup water to make a soft dough and then rolled out the dough on a floured board.  I cut up the biscuits into 1 inch squares using a pastry wheel, and pricked the top of the biscuits with a fork.  I lined my cookie sheets with parchment paper and rotated them half-way through.  The results are crunchy and doggy-licious! Will definitely make again.

My poor puppy is having a rough time recovering from her recent surgery so I thought I would make her some cookies.  She really likes them!  My husband had accidently opened a 15 oz can of pumpkin that was in the fridge so this was a perfect way to make use of it.  I read other reviews so I opted to increase the peanut butter as well to balance the pumpkin, pb ratio. I added some oats and slowly added more flour until the dough was the right consistency.  I wanted small treats.  After rolling out the dough I used a pizza cutter to quickly make bite size pieces that can be used for training. Baking time was approximately 20 minutes per pan.  I ended up with 236 treats!

Both of my dogs (Terrier-mix and German Shepherd) love this recipe! I took the advice of others and doubled the PB and pumpkin. They liked it better and it smelled more of PB and pumpkin rather than just smelling like dough. I also substitute butternut squash and they still can't get enough of them. I have also tried adding applesauce and bananas in lieu of doubling the ingredients and it worked out wonderfully! Instead of doubling, I followed the 1/2 cup pumpkin and 2 tbsp of PB and added 1/2 cup of applesauce and one banana.

My two schnauzers LOVE these, to the exclusion of store-bought treats.  I doubled the pumpkin and you absolutely will have to add water in small increments to make the dough workable - it can be very sticky. I also sometimes add molasses or honey and flax. I don't cook them to rock hard like the recipe recommends; I leave them somewhat chewy, but beware if you do this that they will not keep as long (maybe 5 days) although my dogs are so spoiled this is rarely an issue. We go thru treats at a ridiculous rate.

When I read the reviews I was skeptical at how much everyone said their docs love them.  I have made 4 batches of these and my dogs cannot get enough!  I originally started making these because we got two new puppies and needed some small training treats.  I use a pizza cutter to cut small little squares and they work beautifully.  I can't imagine how much money I have saved, and even better the dogs are gettings something healthier and that they love.  I am going to try and make them with rice flour which is easier on their stomachs.  But I imagine this recipe will be used many more times.

My dogs absolutely LOVE these, I make a batch every weekend for them to snack on during the week. I have one dog with wheat allergies though so I make his with coconut flour. The only problem is, if you don't keep them in the fridge they seem to mold very quickly.

My 2 year old Min-Pin/Aussie Shep. mix is a HUGE fan of these treats. I had ended up with a small sized pumpkin and nothing really to do with it, so I just cut it into 4ths, scrapped the "goop" out, and put them in a bowl of water and microwaved them for about 7 mins. I scraped out the pumpkin, blended it some to ensure it was smooth. It ended up being a little over a full (1) cup but I used it all anyways. Turned out GREAT. Cooked them half way, flipped them over, and cooked them the rest of the way. Made sure they were cool to eat and O-M-G, My pup had a FIT! Love this recipe!

My dog can't get enough of these tasty treats. I only bake for 30-35 min for a softer texture. My dog training has reached new heights with this delicious and healthy treat as a reward.

I was planning on having to modify this a lot based on the reviews, but it turned out perfect with the recipe as written.  I mixed the wet ingredients (plus cinnamon) then gradually added the flour (kneading by hand) until I got a thick dough and the stickiness was gone.  It ended up needing 2.5 cups.  The dogs loved them (although they are not fussy at all).  The only thing is I only cooked for 25 minutes as they were getting very golden.  They aren't rock solid but they are hard enough.  Thanks!

I followed the ingredients exactly and mixed everything together with a large spoon and then used my hands. I did not need any water. I dropped the dough into tablespoon balls and rolled them with my hands into little logs (30) and then cut those in half. All fit on one cookie sheet which I lined with parchment paper. 2 Paws Up for these treats!

My dogs LOVE this recipe!  I altered the recipe too.  I used a whole small can of pumpkin, 2 hefty spoonfuls of peanut butter, a few shots of cinnamon, 4 eggs and then added flour until I got a rolling dough consistency.  40-50 minutes in the oven and I had the happiest dogs on the block!

Tried three different dog treat recipes. Dogs liked these the best. Not really sure why. I assumed they would have liked the peanut butter or beef/garlic recipes I tried. But they were the most excited and motivated (training) with these.  A cinch to make. Took others' advise and used 1 c pumpkin and 1t cinnamon. I also rolled mine super-thin with a pasta maker and cut them into tiny training-sized treats. Baked 20 minutes. They sort of proofed into a cracker texture. Very affordable, easy, low calorie, and no garlic smell in top of dog breath. :-)

All I can say is that my dogs love these ,and I roll them in a long roll and then slice them because I don't have a cookie-cutter it makes it easier for the little dogs to eat them also and it makes more treats. I also used rice flour instead of wheat. I'mix it in my food processor and it's ready to go into the oven in about 10 minutes!

I made these for my two dogs.  One dog will eat anything, but the other, very picky eater loved these.  My only change was a bit more peanut butter...just because I like peanut butter and I figured they would too.

Our Westie's loved these treats.  We tried them too and thought they tasted a bit bland.  Remember I said our dogs loved them.  Next time, I will add more peanut butter and pumpkin.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper.

Super easy to do and foolproof.  It made exactly 23 dog biscuits and they baked perfectly. I only had about a quarter can of pumpkin left so I added some extra peanut butter.  Also had to add about a tablespoon of water so the mix would make a good Dough.  My dog loves them.  Best part I already had everything in my pantry so I didn't have to go out and buy anything special.  I used regular flour instead of whole wheat flour.  I did my research and it turns out that whole wheat flour is the best nutritional option (obviously) but you can use all-purpose flour for these biscuits if you don't have the healthy stuff on hand.  Overall, great recipe!!!

I love making these for my 5 dogs.  I make it one step easier by pressing the batter into a lined/sprayed cookie sheet and baking it for 30 minutes.  I flip it out immediately and slice with a pizza cutter right away. My variations are: I use the full can of pumpkin, 1/2 C oatmeal, 2T molasses, sometimes I add shredded apple.  I tried to post a photo, sorry it wouldn't load, but my dogs do not care that the treats are in small squares-The are quickly eaten!~!

I made this recipe exactly as directed the first time and it was a bit hard to work with the dough.  The next time, I doubled the pumpkin and then added in as much flour as I could with no water.  I kneaded in remaining flour on a floured board.  super easy to roll out and cut into cute shapes.  My black labs LOVE these!  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe Kelly!

For those who said they had problems with mold.....make sure treats are thoroughly cooled before storing them. If they are warm they will cause condensation in the container hence molding your cookies.  I doubled peanut butter and pumpkin and added oat flour (instead of wheat flour) as I kneaded it to the right consistency. I also added ground pumpkin seeds and chia seeds for added crunch. My 8 month old German Pointer goes as CRAZY or more for these than he does wild rabbit or bacon! I stuff his KONG toy with a couple (they are chewy consistency) and he is good to go.

So easy and my dogs really LOVE them, even our our old lab mix who turns his nose up a milkbones, now when I ask him if he wants a cookie, you can see the excitement from his sparkling eyes to the tip of his waging tail.

Great recipe - thank you for posting. After making several times, I took other reviewers suggestions to double both pumpkin and peanut butter and omit salt. It makes the dough perfect consistency.  I cover dough I am not rolling out with a wet paper towel to keep moist.  Today I poked each biscuit with a fork several times on both sides to keep biscuits from puffing up like a balloon - worked well only after discovering poking had to be on both sides! These are better than store bought!

This was the stickiest, most difficult dough to work with. After many attempts to roll out the dough and cut them into cute shapes, I gave up and just put globs of sticky dough on a tray to bake. My dog liked these, but they were a nightmare to prepare and not worth the trouble. Will be trying a different recipe next time.

add more peanut butter. Store in fridge or they will mold quickly. Freeze half batch. Undercook slightly for a chewy treat.

Followed the directions...but used all purpose (white) flour instead of w/w because I misread lol
I had to add more flour & couldn't understand why... Now I know lol
My dog loved them & they were easy to make.
My 8-year old niece even tried one...she said they were decent hehe

TWO PAWS UP!! I just made this recipe tonight for a Pet Fair my neighborhood is having. I thought I would try it out on my EXTREMELY PICKY Bichon Frise first...She LOVED them and wanted more. I had read the reviews and added 1 cup pumpkin, 1/2 cup oats, 3tbsp of natural chunky peanut butter (I did leave out the salt)!! Great consistency!! Baked for 35 min! I also added "Doggie Icing" 2 tsp corn starch, 2 tsp cold water, food coloring and a dash of vanilla! You bake the "icing" onto the cookie. They Looked Great!! And smelled sooo good! I can't wait to sell them at our Pet Fair, I know they will be a hit and all the proceeds will benefit our local Humane Society!!

So, I forgot to add the eggs and they STILL turned out really great. I baked them for about 30-35 minutes, so they'd be crunchy. The dogs love them.

One of my dogs has wheat allergies, so I used gluten-free flour, and I also wound up using more pumpkin (possibly because of the different flour), but the dogs LOVE these - and so do all their doggie pals.  

Cut smaller (or, baked less and cut up after) they make great training treats, too.

The dog loves them. I've made three batches and they are almost gone. I used a little extra peanut butter the second time around. I made a double batch and frozen some.

Great, easy recipe.  Rudie seems to enjoy these treats.  I thawed out a frozen package of butternut squash and used that instead of pumpkin, only because I didn't have pumpkin.  I also made the dough by just tossing everything in to my giant food processor.  It was very easy!  I didn't have any cookie cutters, so I made circular cookies using a shot glass to cut them out.

I made these for my puppy to take to her doggie day care to celebrate her 1st birthday. The recipe is easy to make, but I did omit the salt (they're dogs, they shouldn't care if there's salt or not). All the dogs seemed to like them, so I have no reason not to give this 5 stars. I cooked them for 20 minutes and mine were solid, but they werent cruchy. That's okay for me since most of her treats arent crunchy!

My puppy LOVES these! So glad I found this recipe so my puppy can be healthy too by avoiding processed treats (and saving me money).  Will use this again as a base and try adding other ingredients that are dog friendly like apples, blueberries, etc.  Rolled dough about 1/4 thick and used a 1/2 tsp metal measuring teaspoon to cut out small circular snack sized treats.  Baked 20 min, then left in oven to 'cool' and get crispy for another 5 min or so.

i too doubled the pumpkin i left out the salt. I don't cook with it for the bipeds in the house so why add it to dog cookies?

all three terriers went nuts for them. 

As others have said, if you make them small cook for a shorter time. 
Thanks for a great dog cookie!

My dogs love it. However I did change the recipe some. I went with 1 cup of pumpkin. mixed with hand held mixer and add water as needed. I DO NOT ROLL IT OUT. Due to my carpal tunnel and other physical limitations that's not possible. SO I spread it out in a 15x11 pan, like you would cornbread. And cooked for 20 mins. Not completely dried out, but a nice consistence for my dogs.  Now to see how long they last. :)

I made these today for my 4 girls & they all loved them!
I have tried pumpkin treat/cookie recipes & they were not well received.  My Corgi has a delicate stomach which contributes to very bad breath.  Pumpkin is supposed to fix, or at least, improve greatly her condition.  None til now have hit the mark with all 4 dogs.
I did add a couple tablespoons of molasses for a little sweetener.
Bon' Appitite Doggies!

great, used 20% WW flour *0% spelt, had a perfect dough wih no water.  Cut on wax paper with a pizza cutter and reduce prep time to 5 minutes.  Girls loved them, even though they were ugly.

All 3 dogs were delighted with these! Only amendment I'd add to the recipe is that the instructions to "whisk" the ingredient are-- taken literally-- over-optimistic for the thickness of the batter. :) Spoon and hands only for this.

Did what it said in the reviews- added in rolled oats, upped the amount of PB & pumpkin. I used gluten-free flour mix since my dogs don't tolerate wheat well. 350 for 30 mins- PERFECT. My dogs love them!

LOVE LOVE LOVE! I can't believe this is the first time i'm leaving a review for these since I have been making them for 3 years. My dogs LOVE these treats, they're healthy, they last forever and they are so cute! My fellow dog lovers LOVE getting these treats from us under their Christmas tree! We will continue to make these for years to come and are so happy we found these here!

This is a fantastic base recipe, but you end up adding a lot more pumpkin and flour to make them work. Plan on doubling the pumpkin from the get go, and if using fresh pumpkin, extra flour due to the extra moisture in the fresh pumpkin.

These smell great and my dog loves them!  I used a small cutout because I have a smallish dog.  This makes enough to freeze and use for a long time. Gave some as a hostess gift to my neighbor and her dog loves them too!

I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers and added a whole cup of pumpkin. I had to add a little more wheat flour so i could roll the dough out to make fun fall shapes with cookie cutters. My Labrador "Harley" loved em! I will definitely make them again!

Wow, with all the good reviews I though I would give this recipe a try.  By not changing the recipe at all the dough is waaaay too stiff- my mixer's motor almost burned out. I must have done something terribly wrong.

Awesome!  Used 1/2 can of pumpkin and a little more peanut butter than called for.  Also used applesauce (about 1 tsp.) for additional liquid to make the dough workable.  Doggie LOVES these.  She wouldn't leave the kitchen when I made the second batch.

I have three dogs so buying dog treats from the store can be very costly. I made these dog treats for them all and they were going crazy while I was making them. They smelled so good. I did use 1 cup of the peanut butter like others recommended, and the texture was perfect. Thanks for the money saving recipe.

This is a great treat recipe!!!  Easy to make and has been a smash hit with two out of three dogs.  The third dog is notriously picky and he didn't LOVE it, but he ate it - slowly.. which means that this treat is delicious for dogs!    I followed the recipe as much as possible, but used 1/2 can of pumpkin and eye-balled the peanut butter.  My treats were rolled about 1/4" thick, cut into small bone shapes and they baked perfectly for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  Next time I am doubling the cinnamon so my house will smell even better when they are baking.     Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!  I made them as xmas gifts for my friends' dogs and they ALL loved them!!  My dog also went crazy for them.  The only thing is the baking temp and time on this recipe was way off for me...I baked them at 300 for only 15 minutes.  My first batch started to burn on the bottoms after just 20 minutes, so just keep a really good eye on them!!

A friend of mine made these recently and her dog loved them!  My dog is allergic to everything and anything!  I worry the flour might be a problem.  Can I replace the flour with anything?  What will it turn out like without the flour?

My dogs love these. I use egg whites and all natural peanut butter to make them a little healthier. I also add just a little extra peanut butter and pumpkin for more flavor.

Doggy approved. Made these for our Great Dane and he loves them =)) I did sub the pumpkin for some acorn squash I had chillin in the fridge, I also used AP flour simply because thats all I had, and I left out the cinnamon because I didn't think Tiny would like it. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and did 1 cup of puree and 3 heaping tbs of PB. Thx so much for the healthy dog treats =))

I loved these and used a pumpkin cookie cutter and made an orange colored egg wash and sold them at a bake sale.  Very cut.  My dogs preferred the beefy flavored treats but still ate these up too!

These are great! I made these and the "Dog Treats I" on the same day, and my pooch greatly prefers these. They took the full amount of time to bake even though I used tiny cookie cutters, but were very easy to cut. Now that I know how easy it is to make dog treats, I'm never buying them again!

This is a great "corn-free" dog treat recipe! By the look of the three dogs staring at me while I make them, I think its safe to say they are a hit! I make treats every two weeks and came across this one to try this time. I'm glad I did. The dough was perfect and easy to work with. I followed recipe as written except left out the salt and brushed with egg before baking.  Fabulous!

My dog loved these. BE SURE TO BUY PUMPKIN NOT PUMPKIN PIE FILLING WHICH HAS SUGAR IN.  I didn't add the salt either.  Thanks for sharing.  Heidi dog says thank you too.

I made these for my pet sitting customers and got rave reviews! Everyone loved them and they even asked for the recipe! One thing I did different was I rolled out the dough and cut it with bone shaped cutters. Then I cooked them for 20 minutes.

I don't know how accurately I can rate these, since I'm not a dog. :o) I made them for our friend's puppy, and he seemed to like them. I omitted the cinnamon. I used small cookie cutters in the shape of a dog bone and a star (for Christmas). I put them in a dog treat jar and tied the cookie cutter and the recipe onto the jar with a ribbon. They were really easy to make and came out looking like professionally-made dog treats. Would definitely recommend.

The dog likes them and they are easy easy to make.  We used cat and house shaped cookie cutters.  Will be giving as gifts.  They seem a little plain but I am happy to have something not based on meat products or bananas as an option.

I added some cheese (very little) and my dog liked them a little better.  He's still not a HUGE fan, but coming around.  I will still make them again.

So easy - and my dogs absolutely love them!  The first time I made them, I didn't cook them long enough, so they were a little rubbery.  But the second time I baked them longer, and they turned out nice and crisp.

The Flash Dog loved these treats.  I did use more pumpkin as other recommended, as well as omited the salt and cinnamon.  I used barley flour since Flash is allergic to wheat.  I needed quite a bit of flour to roll them out with upping the amount of pumpkin.  I think next time I'll use the amount called for, and just add a little extra to get to the consistancy I need to roll them out.  I also cut them smaller, so I only baked for a little over 20 minutes.

What a great recipe.  I have been making p.b. dog treats for our two pitbulls and they love them.  We recently found out that they need more fiber in their diet, so they've been getting canned pumpkin (which gets kind of messy).  This is a perfect recipe for their needs! Thanks so much!

Awesome recipe! I was looking for something easy and quick to make. My pups love pumpkin and peanut butter so this recipe was perfect. When I made it, I whisked together the "wet" ingredients then added the flour gradually. I find that sometimes the full amount of flour is not needed.

I used Almond flour because that is what I had on hand. I used 1 cup of pumpkin because I wanted soft treats.  We have old dogs and one only has 6 teeth.  
I used parchment paper to flatten the dough and line the pans for easy cleanup.  This recipe seems very versatile.

Well I added extra pumpkin and peanut butter but that made it way too sticky, so I had to add more flour.  Just getting them out of oven so have not given them to the taste tester yet. She's not picky so... I used 1c pumpkin, 3 T peanut butter and 2 more cups of flour to dry it out.  They look good so we'll see how they like them.

I made this exactly the way it says. sadly my dogs don't love cinnamon. But they love pumpkin and peanut butter. so I modified it to my dogs picky eater needs and they love it. this is a great recipe and and great starter for any flavor that suits your dog's. you can add blueberries cranberry or banana. It's all up to you. stick with the base that has the pumpkin and add your dogs favorite ingredients. I'm gonna try with liver tomorrow. Thank you for sharing. 
P.S. 
Your dog choking on these is not a good reason to give a 1 star review. if your dog wolf's down stuff then make the treat size to accommodate your dogs eating habits.

https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/133123/peanut-butter-and-pumpkin-dog-treats/ ... "I make these frequently. I don't use a cookie cutter, I roll them out and use a pizza cutter to cut them into 1 inch squares. I bake them for 10 minutes, turn the oven off and leave them there until completely cool. They should last about a week as they are very dry and they do freeze well.  I highly recommend that natural peanut butter be used as some of the off-the-shelf nut butters have xylitol which is toxic to dogs" - Bren  :)

I doubled the recipe and added a half a cup more of flour. I used my KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook. It was the perfect texture. Once cooked the cookies are slightly softer on the inside. I’m ok with that though, having an 11 and 13 year old. My dogs beg for these cookies. And I feel so good about giving in to them. I will be trying the banana and peanut butter cookies next.

I followed one user's advice with 1 cup and used about 3 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter and 3/4 cup of rolled oats. I still baked them for 40 minutes but flipped them over halfway through so they wouldn't get to browned on the bottoms. I spruced them up with a 4 ingredient dog-friendly icing (corn starch, water, honey, and I used beet juice for coloring). I did dog bone shapes and hearts for a Valentine's "party" at doggy daycare. So cute, and they smell great!

I've been looking for a great recipe to make our furry family members homemade treats and this one is awesome.  I tried to stick with the recipe but I did change some things.  I used the whole wheat flour.   I added an extra teaspoon of peanut butter. I used the whole can of pumpkin and added about 3/4 cup of oats.  I also added 2 teaspoons of white sugar. I definitely recommend a heavy duty stand mixer.  I baked them for the 30 minutes then left them in the oven while it was cooling off.   I rolled portions of the dough into logs then cut them into round cookie shapes.  they're really hard and crunchy. the mini schnauzers had no trouble crunching them up but our Chihuahua poodle pound puppy had trouble so I broke his cookie up and he loves them too.  almost forgot that I eliminated the salt as well.

Dog Safety Tip!: some brands of peanut butter are Toxic to dogs as they contain xylitol to keep calorie count low. you can search the internet to find which brands are safe. this is exactly the kind of recipe i was looking for though and I'll definitely be making them for my pups! thanks for the recipe!

The only changes I made was that I used Himalayan pink salt and all purpose flour because that's what I had. Oh, i also didnt roll them out, i made them a little wetter than thw recipe said to, dropped them onto the pan and flattened them down a bit. They came out fine. There weren't any complaints from the dog. Well, unless you count the fact that I didn't give him ALL the cookies and he wanted them.

I used all purpose flour and dried peanut butter and left out the cinnamon. Threw everything in my food processor added a little corn oil until it balled up, floured my board with the dried peanut butter, formed a log, cut rounds and baked on parchment. Couldn't be easier and my little angel loves them.
Thanks for the recipe.

The dogs loved their Xmas cookies and rated them 5 stars. These were so easy to make and any cookie cutter will do. Just depends on how big you want them to be. Definitely a keeper recipe!!

Very good! I did 4 TBSP of peanut butter and a whole can of pumpkin.  I had to add more flour to get the dough in a consistency to roll and not so sticky. My dog LOVES them and they were fairly simple to make. I would adjust the recipe to add more flour though.

I would start with 2 cups of flour and add until dry and doughy

Cooked for 20 mins so us humans could taste...was bland with a slight cinnamon after taste so I knew it wouldn't be too strong for the dogs.  Cooked the rest for the full 40 min total.  All three dogs loved the treats.  I loved how healthy they were while also containing the cinnamon that is supposed to be good for joint issues.

I love these treats for our 6 month old German Shepard. I hold off on the last 1/2 cup flour until the dough is worked together and then just add a spoonful at a time until it is a perfect dough to roll and cut out!

I tweaked the original recipe by adding a full 1 cup of pumpkin and 3tbs of powdered peanut butter. The extra pumpkin gives the mix enough water to bind the dough together nicely and once finished the dough is perfectly malleable! simply lay out parchment paper and throw a little more wheat flour on it to roll out the dough to the depth required for cookie cutters. I hope your fur baby enjoys them!!  **FYI make sure you read every label on the additives because some of these ingredients can have xylitol in it which is deadly toxic to dogs and can result in death!

Our 2 dogs love them! I grind rolled oats to make flour and that's what I use instead of wheat flour. I also have peeled, cored and seeded a apple grated it and put it in the mixture.
I store the in the freezer and at 3pm take 1 out for each of them. They are picky and somewhat SPOILED! LOL

Used the dough hook with the KitchenAid. Worked great. Did need to use a little water. Dough was easy to roll out once I worked it with my hands to warm it up a little.  Made gingerbread people shapes. They puffed up a bit. Not sure why. My second batch is in the oven at a lower temp to see it that changes the outcome. Will make again!

Fantastic dog treats!  Easy to make!  Our Australian Shepherds loved them. I bought a dog bone cookie cutter from Michael's Craft store. It's a perfect size for larger dogs. I also used my Christmas cookie cutters to give them fun shapes for the holiday.

My pups loved it! I did add some coconut milk because the batter was very dry- just enough to have it hold together to roll out. Extra pumpkin or peanut butter would do the trick too- I just had extra coconut milk on hand. Three pups went through 42 biscuits in about 4 days!

I am not sure if  I rolled them too thick.  After baking for 40 minutes, I flipped them over and baked another 10 to get that crunchy effect I thought was right.  My three dogs loved them.  I tripled the recipe and it equated out to a total cost of around $4.  I did not factor in the cinnamon or salt.

This was my first time making dog treats, and these treats were a hit! I followed the recipe as written and my dogs loved them. I determined this since my little dog put her face in my big dogs mouth in an attempt to steal his treat. After reading some other reviews, I might tweak the recipe a little bit to moisten it up a little bit. Great recipe! I will definitely make them again!

All three dogs loved it, from German Shepard to beagle to chihuahua. Even my picky eater enjoyed a couple. My beagle is the biggest fan of these. She's asking for more right now but she's already had 3...?? The dough is so so sticky!! I ended up coating the cutting board in flour and so as my roller...after that it was a bit more workable. I made them into heart shapes.The thinly cut and smaller ones cooked crispy and perfectly, but the thicker ones maintained a breadlike consistency at 390F. The dogs don't care though, as long as it tastes good! I snuck a taste and it seems good to me. Perfect holiday gift for dog owners. I'll probably do this again with some modifications, thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe. Used the stand mixer, which incorporates the ingredients easily into a stiff dough. No liquid needed. The dough was really clean to handle. I rolled it into a cylinder and sliced it. It was so quick and easy.

Couldn't believe how much my terrier liked these.  They didn't taste like much to me.  I did up the peanut butter.  Also tossed in some oatmeal the second time I baked them.  Great recipe that can be tweaked any number of ways, and great for me as I wanted my dog to eat more pumpkin.

Based on other reviews, I reduced to 1 egg a d dough was perfect. Subbed 1 mashed sweet potato for pumpkin and half a banana for peanut butter. Baked at 350 for 29 kind then turned the oven off, let biscuits sit in oven to firm up. Worked perfectly!

Sooo easy to make! The dough was perfect to work with. I did omit the salt and added cinnamon. I used different sized cutters (dog, circle, star) and rolled to about 1/4" thickness. I used all natural peanut butter and a smidge of beef stock (instead of water). It's a keeper!

This is my go to base recipe. I do change it up a bit but keep the measurements the same. I use ground up gluten free oats instead of flour. I use chia seeds instead of eggs (2T chia seeds and 6T of water), I also use organic pumpkin and the peanut butter you grind yourself at the grocery store. I have dog treat molds that I just grab some and squish in the molds super easy and it doesnt matter if it is sticky. I have used the recipe as written a few times and it is perfectly fine. I have not met a dog yet that didnt like these treats.

My picky pups loved these treats! I added an extra half cup of pumpkin and a mashed banana, used a little Hello Kitty cookie cutter for the shape, baked for only 30 minutes to keep them a bit softer, and they turned out perfect! I will definitely be making these again!

While we added additional pumpkin and peanut butter, I'm sure this recipe would be great, as is. We just wanted them a consistency to be able to roll and cut out shapes. Which came out adorable. They've been a hit with our dogs and have a package to give to our local K9 Cop.

I cannot attest to how they taste but my dogs did eat them. At first they were like, “ hey this isnt our usual store bought dog treat,” and were reluctant to try it, but sniffing and licks ensued. In the end they happily scarffed a couple down and am sure they are eagerly looking towards more. I added more peanut butter and 1 cup oats to it. I made 1 sheet big dogbone treats, but then decided since both my dogs are chis to use a small round cutout.

These are our dogs absolute favorite.  Store bought treats don't sit well in their stomachs. Some of them make our dogs vomit.
But, these doggie 'cookies' never make them sick. It actually keeps them regular. I use bone shaped and paw shaped cookie cutters. They turn out so cute.
I must admit, when our tummy's are weird from eating a rich meal, nibbling on these make our stomachs feel better. They taste like crackers with a hint of peanut butter and pumpkin.
We just have to make sure not to nibble one in front of our dogs. They will give us the 'stink eye'. LOL.
To others that complained that the dough was sticky: don't add so much water next time. If it's sticky, all you have to do is add more flour.
Here are the bone shaped 'cookies' I made for our 3 babies.

I made my dough feel more like a noodle dough by using a little less flour. It was very easy to roll out and cut. I also under baked mine by about 10 minutes so they're chewy instead of crunchy. My 3 month old Sheltie puppy LOVES them.  I tasted them and thought they were kind of bland but she goes nuts for them!

My dog's kidneys are compromised & she can't have store bought treats anymore. She loved these & the pumpkin seemed to help with her "poops" since they are a good source of fiber. I did omit the salt but stuck to the rest of the recipe. I will continue to make these for her

My daughter and I made these for our fur babies and they loved it! It was dry initially, so I did end up adding a full cup of pumpkin, and baked for 15 minutes.

We followed the advice to increase pumpkin and peanut butter,  we chose to add extra egg too.  They came out perfectly.  My picky pug loves the taste.

I added 1 1/2 cup water. I like easy, so instead of cookies, I made it as brownies and spread it in a shallow pan and cut into pieces afterwards. Either way works great and Luckie loves them and that’s all that matters.

My dogs loved it! However, they did get a bit too hard on the outside so I had to break it into even smaller pieces for my pups - nonetheless, they very much enjoyed it!

So I made these because all the ingredients are Rat friendly, and my girls absolutely love these treats, I had to make them way smaller so the bake time was cut in half, and I added more pumpkin to make the dough where it should have been, aside from that though these are great for my little furs

Very easy to make, nothing but good ingredients and they love them. 
The hardest part of the whole process is deciding what fun cookie cutter shapes to use.
They would be an excellent home made gift for any occasion too.

I followed the recipe to a tee, omitting just the salt and the treats turned out PERFECT!  I gave them to my friend who has 2 standard poodles and she said they begged for more!  I am passing the recipe on to her so she can make them now.

This was a great recipe and was so easy.  I read the reviews so I  made some changes...added 1 heaping cup of pumpkin and 3 tablespoons of peanut butter and left out the salt.  My dog loves them and so do the neighbor dogs, as well as some dogs in our puppy class.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy to make, dogs loved them, less expensive than buying. One downside is keeping them long term remember to freeze don’t just leave them on the counter.

These are a great treat for my 3 dogs. The recipe is easy to follow and make. I notice some were having problems with adding the flour and mixing, i add the flour to the wet ingredients by 1/4 cup increments. My daughter makes these using the dough hook on the mixer.  Either way, they are easy to make. The hardest part is keeping the dogs out of them! Also i don't get fancy with cutters. I spread it out on a cookie sheet, use a chop stick to indent and bake. Then I just break them apart.

I made these treats twice. I followed the recipe exactly the first time. That batch I gave to my pup and friends pups for Christmas. The second time when I made them I increased the pumpkin to 1-15oz can and increased the peanut butter to 3 heaping TBSP. I added about 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 3/4 cup dried cranberries. I also left the salt out. After mixing my dough was still moist so I kneaded it on a floured surface before rolling out and cutting. The dogs loved them both ways!

I used gluten free flour instead of whole wheat because we are gluten free in our house.  I believe our little granddog June has an easier time digesting them because she doesn't belch as much with these as with the ones from the dog store.  Also, we use organic products.  They need to be baked the full time or they may be a little soft in the middle.

My staffy, Lola, loves these!  I cut them into strips to make them easier to fit into a Kong.  I had to leave the cinnamon out since I didn’t have the Ceylon variety on hand and didn’t want to risk liver damage with the other types.

I've made this recipe several times now. I used a little more pumpkin and a little less flour in my last batch. They turned out great! I also roll the dough out and use cookie cutters to form different shapes and sizes.

My dogs love them!!  They are easy to make. I freeze any extras and take them out as needed.  They will last quite awhile that way and will not get moldy in the freezer.

This recipe was pretty good though I did make changes based on what I had on hand. Instead of wheat flour, I used superfine blanched almond flour, 1 cup of pumpkin and 1 tablespoon of peanut butter. I am admittedly impatient during baking times so I increased the temp to 370 for about 20 minutes and took them out when they were browned and biscuit like. To human taste buds they are extremely bland but to dog taste buds they are amazing. All 3 dogs love them very much.

The dogs love it! And used organic products so it’s even healthier. I love that they went crazy for them. No byproducts or preservatives here! I would say store in airtight container. Good for a week like all baked products. Good for their bellies! ????

I've tried a few dog treat recipes now and this dough was the easiest to work with -- way less sticky than the ones that used almond or coconut flour.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but cooked them at 325 F for 40 minutes and put them back in the oven at 200F for another 30+ minutes until they were completely dry like a few other reviewers recommended.  They have the consistency of a biscuit, and the dogs have been going nuts for them!

To test how they survive at room temperature, I left one sitting on the kitchen counter after I made them (10/31/18) and it never grew moldy.  I just pulled a fresh one out of the freezer this morning (1/13/19) and they look identical.  I offered them both to my very picky eater, and she hesitated a little with the one that's been sitting out, but she scarfed it down after inspecting it for a few seconds.  She definitely liked the freezer-stored one better, and it wasn't as crunchy.  But I think they should do fine at room temp for a couple of weeks in a well-sealed container as long as they're baked till dry.

I made two batches and both times the treats came out burnt. Even after 15 minutes I already had some that burnt. Maybe 350 is a little high? My dog ate them regardless so they must taste good. But the appearance of burnt treats doesn’t look too appealing to me.

I made half of the recipe and was scared that I would mess it up but it turned out great. It was too wet at first because I went to heavy on the water so my stand mixer could work well. To make up for it I just added more flour.  i also added some oats, my dogs loved them. They were easy to make and next time I’ll add more peanut butter.

After reading the other reviews, I ended up using the entire can of pumpkin and generous measurements of peanut butter. Gave them out as treats go all the pups for Christmas. My parents dog LOVED them! My brother’s dog immediately hid hers which is apparently her seal of approval. I’m about to make another batch as they were a huge hit!

I did as Mickey25 suggested and made the recipe as follows -Revised recipe to use the whole 15 oz: 1 can pumpkin, 6 heaping tbsp peanut butter, 4 eggs, 5 cups flour, 1 tsp cinnamon. I did not use salt. I did add a small amount of water to get a good consistency.  I mixed  by hand and it worked great. I rolled it out and cut with cookie cutter. I make these for my parrot and my dogs. They are a big hit!!!

Mikey likes it!  I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the salt because my PB already has some, and I added some bacon because bacon makes everything better.  Dough was easy to work with - no extra water needed, and mixed almost completely with my handheld mixer.  I just kneaded in the little bit of excess flour at the bottom of the bowl along with the bacon, then rolled it out and cut it into dog bones and gingerbread men.  Baked at 325 for 40 mins because I was using convection - came out perfectly!  And my grand-dog Mikey loves them!

Followed directions  as written. Dough was perfect for rolling. After cutting and baking they puffed up and looked like flying saucers.   Had to practically burn them to be crisp  inside and not soft like  a cookie .  Tried this recipe twice. 
 Won't be using this recipe again.

I didn't put the pumpkin in it, as I didn't have any at home, so I replaced it with a bit more peanut butter, but the dogs absolutely loved it! 
The only thing: the "dough" was way too dry, and adding a bit of water made it really sticky.

I make these every couple of weeks.  I use organic yogurt instead of water and I don’t let them bake hard.  Dogs with bad teeth get to enjoy them.   I keep some with me for my patients’s dogs.  They look forward to seeing me.

Of course it is hard to tell if dogs really enjoy it over one taste - but mine were scarfed up by 4 different doggies, happily and taste. Liked how the ingredients handled. Would create again. Healthy for doggies.

Love this recipe just as it is.  Dough was easy to work with using my KitchenAid mixer.  I rolled out the dough and made small sized dog bone, dog, and dog paw shapes.  This will be my go to recipe.  Previous recipes I made were too moist and quickly got moldy, but these were perfect.  The dogs loved them.

My dog went crazy over these!  He wasn't too sure at first, but then sat and watched me make the rest waiting for another!  I made them in small gingerbread men shapes and gave them as gifts to my friends with dogs.

I basically kept to the recipe. Added water and then used whole wheat flour on parchment paper for rolling out the dough and that worked perfectly. Didn't have any sticky issues once the dough was rolled in a little flour. Halfway through baking I flipped the biscuits over because the bottoms were getting hard, but the tops were staying soft, even though the biscuit size is pretty small. This is a good, simple recipe!

I just made these today exactly as the recipe recommended except I used my stand mixer.  My 6 month old puppy LOVED these and they were very crunchy. I’ve never seen him act so excited for a treat before! These will be made again for sure!

Too much flour to pumpkin/peanut butter.  I did not add cinnamon or salt, as my dogs do not need that in their diet.  Next time I will add banana for more flavor.  They just tasted like flour.

My first batch came out horrible, but our second go round went great.  I made my version a little thinner than half an inch thick and baked at 350 for 15, then flipping and baking another 15.  40 minutes seemed to give them a burnt stink, 30 minutes works perfect. You can also adjust your flour to accommodate for a half a cup of natural applesauce.  Gives the treats an even more enticing scent with the pumpkin, cinnamon, and peanut butter.

Very easy to make and our two Goldens loved them.  I used half the salt and added turmeric for its anti-inflammatory benefits.  Use dog and cat cookie cutters.  It made a lot and pups are very happy.

I didn't think my dog would like these since he's not keen on pumpkin but I was wrong.

One recommendation would be to store them in the fridge. Mine were in an airtight container but went moldy after a week and a half. 

Another recommendation would be to make your treats thin if you plan on breaking them into smaller pieces. I know this should be intuitive but I was surprised by how difficult it was to break the ones I made.

Made these as a going away present for one of my dog sitting clients and he ?????????????? them!!!!! His mom said that he fished the bag out of his tote and was trying to open the bag as they were heading down the highway. Also baked some not as long so they were chewy and my 6lb client liked them so much that she asks to go out just so she can have a treat when she comes in. If I could rate this more than 5 ?? I would. Will definitely make these again.

Fairly simple to make. I just added the ingredients in a food processor and made the dough without any issues. Since i was not ready to buy an expensive can of pumpkin puree, being in India, Jugaad or adjustment was the way to go and i made the pumpkin puree myself (also very easy from a recipe found at allrecipes).
Tried the cookies with a few dogs and all of them loved it absolutely. However next time ill try making the same with Oats instead of wheat flower as too many dogs are allergic to flour.
Awesome and super easy. Will definitely make more of these. Save the recipe!! :)

My teething pup loved them.  I took one of the commenter's suggestion and used my stand mixer and treated it like pie dough. I did use a cup of pumpkin instead of half a cup and reduced the salt. I also turned the oven off at 25 min but left the treats in for the full forty minutes. The dough was easy to roll and cut out shapes. Although, I think I could have rolled it a little thinner.

My dogs absolutely love these treats! For laughs I sometimes give them a choice between store bought and these, they ALWAYS choose these cookies. The only change I make to this recipe is instead of water, I add a glob of apple sauce. It’s a winner!

I have made this recipe dozens of times. Now I double the recipe and use garbanzo flour for half the total flour, still using just 2 eggs, though. My dogs goes insane and do tricks for these! They LOVE them!

I read a lot of reviews talking about how sticky this dough was-- I made the recipe as advised, then added 3 strips of cooked, crumbled bacon PLUS 1/4 cup of bacon grease. My dogs LOVE these treats. I rolled them into small balls (about the size of marbles), flattened them slightly before cooking. EXCELLENT! This recipe made 137 small treats.

doubled the pumpkin, doubled the peanut butter, nixed the salt. This may sound weird but my husband and I tried them and they weren't bad tasting for us either. Even though there was no sugar, it was sweetish.  Very nice recipe.

I had trouble getting it to roll so that I could cut it. (possibly because I changed the recipe a bit) But I put it on a baking sheet and flattened it out, then used a vanilla extract cap as a cutter to cut out circle treats. Used alot of flour to help it from not sticking. It worked out.
The puppy treats do not expand too much during cooking, so they can be placed pretty close together.

I made it exactly to the recipe, only added 2 tbsp of water to help the dough pull together. Do NOT bake these for 40 minutes or you will get hockey pucks. About half the time works perfectly. My pups could not eat the 40 minute batch. However my 20 minute batch is going over very well. When baking, the dough does not spread out very much so you can load a tray up.

They are great treats but to make delicious treats all you have to do is put a few spoons of pumpkin in a bowl, mix together a few spoons of peanut butter and a few spoons of rolled oats, mix together and roll it into a small ball, and pop them in the freezer for 24 hours. That’s all it’s super easy and my dogs love it. Just be sure your dog isn’t allergic to wheat or pumpkin

lots of people added water but.. I added about 1/2 a cup more of flour to get it to be workable!
Maybe because I used fresh boiled(softened) pumpkin (rough puree) instead of canned pumpkin.

Anyway, it's just come out of the oven and it smells absolutely lovely.. There was a very small bit of extra dough so I made a very tiny cookie to try myself. Call me crazy but.. hey! I made it, and I'm curious! Came out lovely and nice-smelling.

These are good, my puppies love them,  but I'm not sure that salt is all that good for dogs so I leave it out.
Also, followed some advice from some other reviews and doubled the pumpkin.

Toby and Stanley love these cookies! I use half a can of pumpkin, several shakes of cinnamon, a glob of peanut butter, and about 2 1/2-3 cups of a mix of whole wheat and white flour. It's a very flexible recipe. :) I roll the dough 1/4 " thick, and cut them out with mini cookie cutters. I bake at 300 until they are really dried out. (Maybe an hour, maybe more). Baked this way, you can leave them out, baked as directed, they will get moldy unless you keep them in the fridge. I've got about 12 dozen mini dog cookies in the oven (1 batch) right now

This is the 3rd time I'd made these treats. All the dogs  that I have given to loved them.  I added 3 extra riped bananas & extra peanut butter to the batches(I double the recipe). All my friends are hinting to me today that they are running low on these treats. My puppies are wild when I said "treat time".

I also doubled the pumpkin and put an egg wash on them after first batch had a flour dusting appearance. My 2 100 lb Rhodesian Ridgebacks dont trun down any snack so, of course tgey wolfed down tgese as well. I used smallest bone shaped cutter and had some vegetable cutters that had a goldfish shape , keeping the sizes down to bite size rather than small meal. Ill use this recipe again, very eady and with a little flour, rolled out fine.

All the dogs in my life love these treats.  I doubled the pumpkin and peanut butter as others suggested. Though the dough did get very sticky, I found that mixing the ingredients with a wooden spoon and using extra flour when rolling out the dough which fix any problems.

These aren't "filled with pumpkin and peanut butter"; they are made with pumpkin and peanut butter--no filling, just so we're clear. Now...I  made this exactly as written, sans salt. These made >60 1-1/2" round pieces. In #2, beat the ingredients as stated, but add the flour either last, or a bit at a time to get the best incorporation. Use half (eyeball it) of the 15.5-oz can of pumpkin for perfect consistency. I rolled onto parchment paper (waxed is too weak). I poked holes in the rolled-out dough before cutting (I used my mandolin's spiked produce holder). I used the top of a vitamin bottle's lid that has a flip top, so that I could pop the dough out with  my fingers if needed. I love this recipe--perfect! I needed only 15 minutes' baking time. They're not crunchy, but not super soft. One of my dogs can't eat fowl/beef/pork, so commercially made treats aren't an option. This recipe is fabulous. I'll use it forever. Thanks so much.

I added a whole cup of pumpkin and an aging banana to hopefully make the dough less sticky.  Neither change worked.  I finally dusted the final dough with a lot of flour just to make it workable.  Chilling the dough helps a little too.  The dogs love the treats but it would be great if the dough was less sticky.

Increased pumpkin to 1 cup,  added 1/2 Cup oats,  increased peanut butter to 3T and used 2 1/2 Cups whole wheat flour. The dough is sticky, and you have to keep flouring your hands, work surface and rolling pin. Working in smaller batches makes it more manageable. They smell good enough for us to eat!  Key to crunchiness...after baking, put them all back in the oven when you first turn it off and leave them there till oven is cool.

My chihuahua was a little suspicious at first, but now likes her new treats. I like that they are inexpensive, healthy, and quick and easy. I know she doesn't care about the shape, so I first cut small circles, then plopped  small spoonfuls on the pan, then just realized I could put a larger amount on the pan, pat it down,  cut it into "squares" and push them out over the pan. Since I added a little water the dough didn't hold the shape, but my little 4 lb chi doesn't mind. I did a double batch and will freeze them for use a few at a time.

I followed COOKINBUG’s suggestions and increasing the pumpkin to 1 cup, 3 tablespoons of organic natural peanut butter and 3/4 cup organic rolled oats. I don’t have a mixer so I did it by hand and the batter consistency was perfect! Rolled out to 1/2” thick and seeing as I don’t have cookie cutters, I used my apple slicer and the size of the treats are perfect! I especially love the small round ones for my little guys. My kiddos range from 9 to 70 Lbs. After baking for 35 minutes I turned oven off and let them cool for 10 more minutes in the oven before taking them out to cool the rest of the way. My kiddos enjoy them!

The dogs love these! I consider this to be a good foundation recipe since there are so many tweaks that can be made. In my case I used sweet potato (microwaved for 7 min to get it tender enough) instead of the pumpkin. But I can see using banana, applesauce, and oats in all sorts of combination with this. I mixed everything with the paddle blade first, then changed to the dough hook and starting adding flour 1/2 cup at a time until I had a relatively dry dough. Rolled out perfectly with no sticking. The smell while baking was awesome!

My Dog loves them however my Vet sent me this message 
.Hi! This is Dr. Tobia. The only ingredient that I'm a little concerned about is the cinnamon because it can cause issues in larger amounts. I've been doing some research to see how much would be a problem and I have not been able to find a definitive answer, so I'd recommend omitting it. Otherwise, I don't know if I would consider the treats healthy,

I should say that Pepper and Hailey loved them!  They gave them 5 Woofs.....  

I did make 2 versions of them..... this one and the other  I substituted the peanut butter with 1/2 of a banana ..

They were east to make..... you can cut them out with cute shapes or just a small circles or squares (  not so time consuming ) 

The doggies knew they were in for some good treats when they smelled the bag.

I put them on parchment paper to bake them.... it made them much easier to take off the baking sheet!

I usually use the whole can of pumpkin &  add twice the amount of peanut butter.  You an also substitute canned pureed sweet potatoes.  Instead of all flour I use 1/2 oatmeal. 
 Also it's easier to use your hands to mix, that way you can add extra flour or liquid as needed.  Then to bake I roll in balls & flattened with a glass - no mess rolling & no waste.  My 14 yr old Sadie has the beginnings of kidney disease - these are healthy, easy to make & she LOVES them.

I made these for my grand puppy and they turned out great.  He doesn’t do well with wheat flour so I used 1.5 cups rice flour and 1 cup of oat flour.  He loved them.  Such an easy recipe.

Because I used a bit more pumpkin than the recipe called for, I found I didn’t need to add any water at all to create the dough. It rolled out nicely and was easy to work with. All 6 of my dogs loved the cookies, even picky Lily.

My dogs loved them, but they were incredibly sticky and hard to form . I added more pumpkin, one review said to add more. That helped the stickiness a little bit,  but I want one my son can help create for our pups.

I doubled the recipe, and used my stand mixer to blend them up.  Then rolled out logs and sliced them in half inch rounds. It does take about  45 minutes to dry them out completely. They were a hit with my pack; and I must admit, my husband and I tried a sample...not bad at all!

I have older dogs so I was looking for a softer bisquit. I added 2 tbs canola oil and got a dough with better texture and handling. I rolled them 1/4” thick and cooked them for 20 minutes at 375. Came out well and fussy dogs liked them. Delighted to find a home made alternative for them.

My dogs Loved these!  The only thing I changed was, I used 2 cups whole wheat flour, and one half cup of all purpose flour.  This will make the dough easier to handle.  I got 6 paws up for this one!!! (my six pups)  Happy Baking!!

My spoiled dog loved these cookies, especially warm and fresh out of the oven! The only change I made was using oat flour instead of wheat. (Oat flour is easy to make -- just grind rolled oats in a blender and they quickly turn into powder.) My dough was too sticky to roll out so I just used a ziplock bag to pipe out funny little poop-looking cookies onto a silpat.

Made these and my dogs loved them. I made them at Christmas and had them in boxes for treats as gifts. I left the lids off for a couple of days. Each box had about 4 3" treats in them. When I finally got around to closing up the boxes to take to friends I realized there were several missing from each box. I went to start making more. When I went back to the dining room where the others were I found the cat knocking over the boxes to steal treats. I hadn't even considered the cat  (my roommate's cat - I have the dogs) wanting the treats. They were a huge hit with friends. I did reduce the salt.

I made these dog treats and the dogs couldn't get enough they would sit in front of me starring at me not willing to leave with all their focus on the treats! I added a little bit more peanut butter to them so that the dogs got a taste of both the flavours.

I used normal all-purpose flour, and the recommendation of using a whole cup of pumpkin to avoid adding water.. the dough was so sticky I couldn't even roll it, even after adding another 1/2 cup of flour to it. Ended up rolling them into balls, and baking them, but they only baked 7 minutes before turning brown on the bottom. I had to pull them out early and the centers were doughy still. On the plus side, my dog went crazy for them!

I made these and my two dogs can't get enough of them!  I've made treats before and they've turned their noses up at them which crushes you after baking specialty treats.   I have a finicky eater and one we call "Hoover" because she practically inhales everything and they both equally love these. We recently took the finicky eater to the vet for vomiting.   Pancreatitis.   So no table scraps, low fat and as completely natural and healthy as possible.   These fit the bill!   Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a good recipe, but unfortunately, it calls for Whole wheat flour and even though it's better than regular flour, it is still bad for dogs. I substituted oats instead and the dogs loved it and I am confident that it is good for them with  omitting of the WW Flour.

I mix together the wet ingredients. mix flour in till dry ingredients get more solid. then add a tblsp at a time water till JUST together(about 3 tbsp. in GA. Remove from the bowl and knead a bit by hand.Roll out to1/2 inch thickness on pastry plastic sheet. Cut with a dough cutter 1/2 all the way across. Then into 1/2 in squares. Remove with the cutter to cookie sheet and space 1/4 inch. They all fit on a large sheet. After 30 minutes in the oven. I turn it off and let them sit inside for another 10. Come out perfect. Have made these may times.

This might be the only recipe I've commented on, but these dog treats are perfect! I used ground peanut butter instead of the real fattening peanut butter, but trust me, my fur babies couldn't tell the difference! No need to add any additional pumpkin it will only make the dough too sticky. The dough was super easy to work with and 24 hours later, the bones are still as crunchy as when they came out of the oven. This is the only recipe I will use now! I placed the dough on a wooden cutting board and used dog bone cookie cutters, once cut, I placed a small frosting spatula underneath the bone to transfer to my baking sheet. So easy and super crunchy!

Lets face it, Labs are not picky, but Autumn loved these.  She went to every spot she ate it at afterwards looking for crumbs.  I used silicone molds and the extra i rolled into little bites for small treats. I used one cup of pumpkin like other reviewers suggested.  Autumn is in a cast and a puppy and somewhat bummed out she cannot walk or be around dogs.  These treats totally took her out of her funk and she is a happy pup this morning.  STAPLE!

I just spread it out in a cookie sheet, but not too thin, then baked until they were hard and crunchy, after they cooled, cut them into little squares (dog doesn't care if they are heart shaped or star shaped). He LOVES these!! Always gets super excited when I go to his cabinet for a "treat". Add more peanut butter or more pumpkin if your dog is a PB lover like mine! I make these all of the time!

I made the recipe almost exactly as written, just committed the salt.  I've got a Lab mix and a Golden Retriever that are far from picky eaters so no need for salt or cinnamon.  I also added about a tablespoon of flax seed.  I didn't need any water.  Rolled the dough on floured surface and cut out rounds.  They puffed up a little in the middle so in the future I will prick with a fork before baking.  Only needed 30 minutes for smaller rounds (1")and 35 for larger (2.5") rounds.  My puppy lab mix is a new adoption who has a little diarrhea from changing foods and the pumpkin will be good for that I hope.  They both loved the treats!  Four stars for the puff in the center, otherwise I'd say five stars.

These were easy go make!!  I cut them a little smaller and cooked for 25 min instead.   Came out perfectly.... my dog has horrible allergies and is picky.  Needless to say he inhaled this treat!  Big hit.

Annie seems to enjoy them!! Instead of using water as needed I used more pumpkin, probably about another 1/2 cup. I didn't use the salt as it isn't needed and it isn't healthy. I rolled these out and used a pizza cutter to cut them into 1 X 1 inch squares. Because my treats were smaller I baked them for 10 minutes, turned the oven off and left them there until completely cold. Thanks for sharing.

Added some dried blueberries to one batch and baked to semi-hard instead of crunchy. Dogs all love this one.  We give treats away at the gas station and I feel better that I can make this all organic and wheat free.

Paws Up from Coco! I added an additional heap of peanut butter and used oat flour instead of wheat (some dogs don't do well with wheat). If the dough is too sticky, just add more flour. Bake time is perfect. Even Kitty enjoyed a piece.

My lab loved these treats!.  Super easy to make and I will be making them weekly from now on.  I did have to add some water to get it to a working consistency and rather than roll it out, I just pulled tablespoon size chunks and placed them on a cookie sheet and baked for 40 minutes.  I may try adding more pumpkin next time and less water.  I also will use my stand mixer for the next batch.  Definitely no need to buy dog biscuits ever again...

Our dog loves these! She sits in the kitchen waiting for someone to walk in to give her one! I did use a bit more pumpkin because I store it myself in two cup portions and add a tad more flour. I baked them for 40 mins but because of the added pumpkin they are soft. I also baked the entire dough on a cookie sheet and then broke into pieces.

I made these treats but used rice flour as my little dog is allergic to wheat. I used just under a cup of pumpkin and doubled the peanut butter! My dogs love them! I cut them much smaller too and I get anywhere from 120 - 150 per recipe.

I had the items available on to make it.  The dogs like it, the dough is pretty tough...it stuck to wax paper while I rolled it out... it's easy to make though.  I Do not know if I will make it again....I was surprised at the long baking time but I guess it's needed for the crunch.

I rolled out the dough and used a lil bone cookie cutter...so cute...and gave them out to our fur neighbors for Christmas.  I only baked them for 30 mins.

Is excellent treat for my dogs. They loved them!! The only change I really made was that I did make it in my mixer because it was to hard for me to whisk. Otherwise, all perfect! 
Will be making them again and even put some in the freezer to save for later.

My senior dogs love these treats! However they can't have grains so I substituted organic coconut flour for the wheat flour and added an extra egg to compensate for the dryness of the coconut flour. Doing this minor substitution and following the rest of the recipe exactly led to a sugar/shortbread  cookie dough consistency, perfect for my bone shaped cookie cutter. 
Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

This was my first attempt at making dog treats. I followed the recipe exactly as it's written, (I did put in a bit more peanut butter), with the exception of using a stand mixer versus a whisk. 

I used small cookie cutters to make hearts, stars, circles, and sunbursts. I baked the treats for 40 mins. They came out hard and crunchy. 

I plan on giving them to my golden retriever's furry friends for Christmas. Zoe loved the sample treat she got, once it cooled  enough for her to eat. 

I plan on making these again. I will omit the salt the next time. 

I'll post a picture once they're all done baking!

My dog loves these. She was sitting staring at the oven while they were baking! I added water as directed, and mixed with a rubber spatula then sort of kneaded the dough by hand, rather than whisking.

No changes needed, except I had to bake them a full hour to get them crispy. Maybe I cut them a little thick. I live in a neighborhood where there are lots of dogs, so they will all get a Christmas bag of these yummy treats.

I used this recipe in exactment, and it came out fine. Mixes flaky, you have to knead it. Any more liquid/puree and it'd come out too soft. I like this recipe, I'll use it as base. Dogs dig it too.

My three dogs were waiting patiently for the cooling of the cookies.  Hollister, an older and bit hesitant to try new things, gave it a once over sniff.  Then begged for more.  They all love it!

Easy to make and added more pumpkin and peanut butter as suggested. I mixed the egg, pumpkin, peanut butter and spices first. Then added the flour a bit at a time. Mixed it by hand until I got the dough I wanted. Used a bone cookie cutter and had to remind myself this was not a cookie for me and bake until hard. My dog loves these and  bugged me in the kitchen while baking. These are better then any dog treats I would buy. Cheaper and I know what's in them.  Plan on making them again and I plan on giving them to his dog friends.

These biscuits were awesome!
I tried cutting out shapes, but the dough for mine was too sticky, so the shapes turned out all like blobs! I added 1/2 to 1 cup of oats to make these healthier for my dog. Also, since we were out of whole wheat flour, I used a combination of mostly almond flour, with some all purpose flour. For the pumpkin, my mom made a pumpkin puree, and I added more than it says, same with the peanut butter. My dog adores these, and takes them to another room, then gobbles them up!

These are easy to make, best in small bite size pieces (though a little bigger and they are chewy).  My dogs and my trainer's dogs go crazy for them.

This is a great recipe! So easy!  I added a touch of Allspice.
My dogs are old and have lost many of their teeth so I rolled the dough out and used my mellon baller to cut the dough in small cookies. I also decreased the cooking time to 20 min. They were perfect and stayed a little soft. My dogs are crazy about them.

My girls love these , Shepard and a boxer....  I did add oats,  used the whole can of pumpkin, and extra peanut butter....  left out the salt
if you let the dough rest, it won't be as sticky, plus I roll out between parchment paper

My daughter and her friend made them exactly as written.  My dog loved them.  I will say, the dough was goopy and hard to work with, but we ended up just dropping them by the teaspoon onto the cookie sheet....so although they didn't look cute or pretty, our dog gobbled them up!
Thanks!!

My chihuahua, Firecracker loves them! Only thing  is when I cooked the treats for 40 minutes they turned dark brown and verd hard. I just changed the cooking time to 20 minutes. It might just be my oven though. The treats are so easy to make. I also really liked them because the dough is really easy for me to work with!  I use a bone cookie cutter and they come out so cute!Will defentely be one of my favorites for dog treats!

I followed the recipe and it worked, however, I mixed all but the flour by hand with a whisk.  I then added the flower and used the dough hook attachment for my stand mixer.  3-4 minutes and I had a dough that I rolled out and cut up with cookie cutters.  For those that found it sticky and hard to work with, think of this  as a bread recipe.  Some recipes can be done by hand but others really need the mixer with the dough hook.  This is definitely the latter.  It is a good recipe to make with kiddos because it is simple.  My pack likes them.

My dogs go NUTS when I'm making the dough and they taste tested it for me and they are huge fans! The finished product was a little too hard for them though. Especially my senior citizen pup. I am going to experiment a little, maybe try making them thinner, or adding more pumpkin or cooking them shorter time. In don't know yet but when I figure out the right style, im sure these will be perfect for my pups and the neighborhood dogs!

These are so easy to make!  I made no changes to the recipe.  It only took 5-10 minutes to mix it up, roll out and cut into pieces.  I'm waiting now to take them out of the oven and my dog already knows that the amazing smell coming from the kitchen is all for her -- and she loves these!

My fur babies LOVED this recipe.  I used brown 2 cups of brown rice flour, 3/4 cup canned pumpkin, and 1/4 cup of peanut butter.  The dough was perfect and it took about 45 minutes to cook until they were hard.  I will be making this recipe again and again because my boys LOVED it!

Great simple recipe with most things already found in the kitchen.
I have a hard time finding canned pumpkin without added spices (like nutmeg) which is supposively bad for dogs. I prefer to pick up a bag of sweet potatoes.
Cook the sweet potatoes in the microwave until soft (~5 minutes). Wait until they are cool and then scoop out the inside contents. Combine with all of the other ingredients in the kitchen aid. I tend to put too much sweet potato so I have to greatly increase the flour. just keep going until its not sticky. 
I roll them out a bit thinner than indicated because I like the dog biscuits crunchy and not chewy. When they are chewy/soft, I've had them become moldy.

All the best

I have a puppy black lab and she LOVED these treats I increased the pumpkin amount from 1/2 cup to 1 full cup. And I think it did an excellent job of making the batter thicker. I added half a teaspoon more to the cinnamon to give it a better taste and I cooked them for 10 more minutes. But overall this was one of my favorite home made treat recipes.

My daughter  and I made these for our Labradoodles' birthday.  We followed the recipe exactly.  They took a lot longer to cook than the recipe said but it was no big deal.  I just kept poking on them to see if they were hard.  :)

Our two Labradoodles like them and I will make them again.

I did omit the salt and I substituted the flour with a combo of 2 1/2 cups of coconut flour, rice flour and flax seed meal.  My diabetic dog who is very picky loves it.  I don't make shapes,  just press it onto greased wax paper and cut it with a pizza cutter.  Thank you for the recipe!

Puppy seems to love these as opposed to the ones I bought at the store. The only thing I need to change is the temp. I have dark non-stick and 40 min at 350 overcooked them. Next time I will reduce the heat and time.

My dogs love this cookie! I have a tiny, prissy, picky princess papillon, and a very large, lovable, hungry pitbull. I figured since my big boy loves everything I cook for him, that I could just make a smaller batch just for him--but then I saw my little girl just begging for what her brother was eating! Now I know to make more for next time. Two thumbs way up :)

Dogs love these, but be careful. NEVER use peanut butter with artificial sweetener that can be poisonous to dogs! I use natural peanut butter and make these as described. To save time, I roll out the dough by halves and move each of the two whole sheets onto cookie sheets. Then I score them into squares and poke them with a fork. I bake them until quite dry and brittle, then cool and snap them apart. Fast!! (The pups don't care about fancy shapes for everyday...)

I've made this for years but only recently created an account. It's great for my dog with a sensitive stomach and food allergies! I usually double the recipe and put a full 15oz can of pumpkin in to help with her tummy issues. I'll try to upload a picture to show how much it makes, but making double the recipe and after feeding way more treats than I should've to my parents' two 10 pound dogs, my 10 pound dog, and my sister's 30 pound dog, we had about 9 snack size bags left. I roll the dough out in a cake pan and then cut it into very small pieces with a pizza cutter. I put the leftovers into ziplock bags and freeze them because even if I had followed the recipe, it makes more than these four dogs can eat before it goes bad. I'll pull a ziplock out of the freezer, and they thaw out very quickly. I keep them in the fridge to avoid mold and bacteria growth from spoiling.

An excellent recipe! My dog loves these. I substituted the whole wheat flour for baking flour, it turned out amazingly. A small note: if you have a smaller dog, try cutting them into half - pieces.

Easy to make.  One dog liked it, and one dog turned her nose up at it.  Yet to find a  biscuit like treat that the latter will eat except the One Earth Naturals Brewers Yeast and Garlic.

So easy...my 12-year old daughter made these!  The mix was a bit dry for her to handle so she added a bit more pumpkin.  Our Schnauzer doesn't usually like store bought dry treats - she loves these!  :)

please be careful when using peanutbutter for dogs. I heard a vet say on public radio that peanutbutter with xybitol is seriously worse for dogs than chocholate

Made with small cookie cutters for my Boston Terrier; he loved them. However, you should put them in a closed container in the fridge or they will get moldy pretty quickly!

Didn't make any changes. My dog loves  them. They keep good in a sealed tight container.  They are very easy to make and is nice knowing what they are eating.

My fur baby Dexter has lots of allergies so every treat we look at can't have beef or beef flavor or broth.  He is like a kid when I make these -- he comes over to the cooking racks and sniffs and looks at me like "can I have one please."  This is now the only treats he gets.  I triple the recipe so I don't have to make them as often.  They keep well.  Also, I omit the salt.

Found out about these delicious treat from a friend who made some for my  9 month old chocolate lab.
This recipe is as close to hers as i can find minus the tuna oils she would add as I do not like the odor.
Yes, this is sticky dough and I hand mix it and keep extra flour on my cutting board to avoid sticking to my hands so don't mix it with your motorized devices.
Also, these are more of a chewy biscuit with the pumpkin and peanut butter so Do Not store them in an air tight container or baggy at room temperature as they will mold.
I put them in a large zip lock freezer bag and store them in my fridge.
My lab weighs 75 pounds and foams at the mouth over these (yes, he had his rabies shot) and I use one biscuit per outing and break it up as a whole one at a time is gluttony.
My dog told me so.

I have made these and had to add more water (about 5 T or more, lost count) to make it go into a dough.  After that I treated it like a pie crust.  The dogs (Yorkie and Mini Schnauzer) love them.  I made  strips and balls, and pressed them flat.  I only baked them for 25 minutes.  I made something like these about 2 years ago and baking them for such a long time made them so hard it was difficult for my Yorkie to chew.  Next time, however, I will use the entire can of pumpkin, more peanut butter and hopefully not have to add water.  

Do I have to store these in the fridge or can they just be put in a cookie jar?

My dog stood by patiently as I pulled the treats from the oven and let them cool. She is normally fairly picky about some of her treats, but she loved these! I will definitely make them again. I doubled the batch and cut them out in heart shapes (for Valentine's Day) for the many dogs in our family. They were quite the hit!

I added another egg and another tbsp of peanut butter. My dogs loved them. They would have eaten them all at one time, but they don't need to gain any weight. I have 2 toy poodles, 2 chihuahuas, a min pin & a red nosed Pitt bull dog. I cut them in 3 rds for the little ones.  I did not roll the dough, but patted it into a log 1/2" thick & sliced. I cooked them only 30 mins.

One of my dogs is allergic to most grains, so I used chickpea flour (for the first time). I also added a banana because I only had 1/4 cup of pumpkin. I needed more flour, I used 4 cups + what I needed to roll it out, but whether that was because of the extra moisture the banana added, or if you just need more of the C.P. flour, I don't know. Also, if you choose to try the C.P. flour, watch the oven, lol, I burnt the 1st pan (not that my dogs will care). I cooked them for 20 mins, turned them over  & cooked for 20 mins more. 15 mins on either side was still a little too much without decreasing the temp.

Made this per recipe except with full cup of pumpkin and 3 Tbsp peanut butter. Dough was  very sticky, so I placed it in the fridge for an hour and put more flour down on wax paper I placed out for rolling,( still pretty sticky). Then just cut it into 1/2"X1/2"X1-1/2"  blocks, a few larger, and had some excess so I made a t-rex dog, about 3"- 3" just to see how it would come out. My oven is old and I have to adjust for temperature so I checked it at 20 minutes and let it go  a few minutes longer than suggested but they still weren't hard like a milkbone biscuit but dry enough to pack without moisture build up. So far a big hit between my girl and a couple friends of hers. I tasted one too, shh, don't tell her, it was bland and dry lol but the dogs love them .

I made this recipe exactly as written, except I added a few dashes of turmeric for added health benefit and left out the salt.  I baked mine at 350 degrees for 55 minutes.  My dogs LOVE these cookies.  I rolled them out and cut out shapes then baked.  I will be giving these to the neighbor dogs for Christmas.  Great recipe, and healthy :)

These turned out great. Like others, I added 1 full cup pumpkin and 4 heaping tablespoons peanut butter. I also added about 1/2 cup oats. I baked them between 15-20 mins. Unless you're making large biscuits, any longer will burn the bottoms. Thanks for this recipe, I am giving them to all of dog-owner family members for Christmas this year :)

All the dogs I made these treats for loved them, plan on making more as Christmas stocking stuffers. I also increased the pumpkin to 1 full cup and used oat flour as I didn't have any whole wheat.

My pup's refused eating purchased treats after eating these.  I changed a couple of things, I use rice flour instead of regular or wheat flour because it is ill advised for dogs to have wheat.  I also found when I did that it changed the consistency of the dough which required a lot of unbleached flour on the surface I roll them out on.  I have been asked to ship some to Washington State (from NY) so I guess they made a hit there too!!

I've been making these for years and our dogs love them. My only tip is to make sure you bake them long enough that they are hard like biscuits, as the dogs like the crunch. If you have leftover pumpkin, you can dip the cookies in that before giving them to the dogs too :)

My grand daughters and I have made these the last two years as Christmas presents for the four dogs in our extended families. We have fun and the dogs love the treats. My youngest grand daughter is severely allergic to gluten so we use gluten free flour. dogs don't seem to mind at all!  P.S. Let the kids mix it with their hands. Wonderful, gooey mess!

This is a great and simple recipe. I add bacon bits which takes it a step higher, and God knows French poodles are hard to please!! While it bakes I give the dog a bath and the biscuits are his reward.

Wonderful!  This recipe made enough treats to last my 30 pound dog for 3 weeks (and I gave several goody bags away to some of our neighbor's dogs).  They kept well in a ziploc bag and he loved them!

I doubled the pumpkin and peanut butter. I rolled the dough out and it was easy to cut into shapes. Just watch how much water you add. I didn't add any water at all. I also whipped it all up in my food processor by just putting all of the ingredients at once in the processor and processing until a ball formed. My dogs think that these biscuits the best thing they ever ate! I have a batch in the oven and they are both patiently sitting in front of the oven waiting.

I didn't use the pumpkin, but my sweet little dog couldn't eat them fast enough! This is definitely the thing to make if you want your pup to love you!

Not sure how'll they'll turn out, probably the issue is that I didn't convert it from USA cups to UK.  It was soaking wet, even without water. Impossible to roll.

I made these yesterday, the only change I made was to add a whole cup of the pumpkin...My two little pups are overly picky when it comes to what treats they'll eat, and they absolutely love these...So very easy to make...and nice to know that they are healthy treats...

My dog went crazy over these treats!  She would take the treat, run into the living room to eat it.  And she will play with it, like a cat playing with a mouse, before she eats it.  She has never been so excited about a treat, ever.  And she loves her daily treats!

These are great and easy to make!  I made them by hand mixing everything together and adding the flour last and kneading the dough a bit.  I made a big log and cut it into 1/2" slices then cut some of them in half and others in thirds for smaller bites.  Baked 40 mins and left to dry in oven.  Puppies love them!  Thanks for the recipe.

I saw this recipes and thought I would try it for my dogs. They can be picky with treats. They loved them. I have been making them for almost a year. I have a batch in the oven. I doubled the recipe and freeze the dough. Saving money on treats and no artificial stuff in it.

I make these all the time for my labradoodle.  It's an easy recipe and very forgiving.  I don't measure and add more  pumpkin (usually a whole can as I hate to waste it) a little extra peanut butter and mix wet ingredients with a whisk and then start adding flour and use hands to mix together.  Also, sometimes I'll add applesauce.   Easy to make and can put them together in less than 5 minutes.

Our big mixed breed dog seems to really like these and he's not a big fan of pumpkin.  I added one piece of bacon, crumbled and cooked and left out the salt.  I used a large bone shaped cutter and they came out so cute, I wish I could upload a pic.  The dough came together and was easy to work with.  I will make these again, probably trying different substitutions and additions like grated cheese, yogurt or cooked brown rice.  He loves apples, maybe some unsweetened plain applesauce?  How nice to be able to make something special for our dog who adds so much to our lives and asks for so little in return.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made these for my dog. He seems to like them. I couldn't understand how the recipe would mix together as is so I added water til it would stir (maybe 1/2 cup or less).

This can be easily doubled with NO COMPLICATIONS from much too much of any ingredient. Occasionally, I put in EXTRA PEANUT BUTTER with no problems.

Fun and easy. My dogs love them. I may try to add banana next time if it doesn't mess with the consistency too bad. I love the idea of giving them whole natural treats vs all the chemicals in regular treats. Awesome awesome recipe. Thanks!

I made these cookies today. Before I go any further, I want to say that I am a beyond amateur cook. Fully capable of screwing up even the easiest of recipes. But this one is very easy to make. I did make the mistake of coating it with flour to roll it out. It didn't need it. Some changes I did make, though:

1) I only cooked mine for 20 minutes, which was perfect for my dogs. This way it was chewy and not too hard for my old man dog. 
2) Don't try to whisk it. I used a spoon just enough to start the ingredients together and then just put my hands in the bowl to finish it. You probably don't even need to add any water if you do this. 

The only downside is that they smelled so good that I really wanted one.

We have one do who will eat anything that crosses his path and one very picky little dog that doesn't like much at all.  Needless to say these are a hit with both of them and my biggest problem is making sure we have enough on hand!

These are the BEST!  Nice healthy treat.  My dogs gobble them up and I feel good about feeding them something that I know exactly what's in them.  I changed one thing -- I used brown rice flour (one of my pups is sensitive to wheat).  I also added about 1/4 of honey.  For those who think the dough is too sticky....add more flour until the consistency is workable. It's an easy fix.  Also, wet your hands with water before handling the dough -- it helps a lot. This dog biscuit recipe is my standard, "go to" and my dog-owner friends love it when I give them these as gifts.

I board dogs in my home.  I made these to give to the families when they picked up their pups as a thank you for their business.  Some have complained that these are too dry to work with.  I found that if I mixed all of the wet ingredients together and then added in the dry ingredients this dough was a dream to work!  And the dogs LOVE them!

Very easy to make!!! A lot of reviewers mentioned that they doubled the pumpkin and than others mentioned that when they did that the dough was unworkable so I followed the recipe however I added 3/4 cup of pumpkin and I did not add salt. I don't add salt to my cooking I am not going to put it in my dogs. My dogs love them!!! I also bought some apple filling so I can switch out the pumpkin. Will be making it again especially with all these dog treat recalls!!

Very easy recipe! But most importantly my dogs loved them! I did add more pumpkin to make it a little moist about 1cup instead of 1/2 cup. Thank you for a great treat for my furry friends. I never thought I'd make my dogs snacks. Lol

I have made this recipe umpteen times and my chocolate lab ANDY my husband love them.  My husband goes for those treats for the dog every time even though we might have commercial treats in the house.  I have been using a half can of pumpkin and generous amounts of peanut butter a and they work out fine.  At first I rolled and cut them out but lately just make a log and cut pieces and flatten them out to the sizes I want.
The person who won,t make them again because they're too soft should just add a bit more flour.  I also put them together in my food processor and finish with my hands on a board.  This is a winner!

This was my first attempt at making dog treats.  I read through several comments before beginning and did add some rolled oats and doubled the pumpkin.  These were super easy.  I just dropped them by teaspoon full onto the baking sheet and flattened them a bit.  My dogs absolutely LOVE these!  They get more excited over these than they ever did for a store-bought biscuit.

My dogs and my friends dogs love these so much.  My husband doesn't help in the kitchen unless its feeding the dogs.  He rolls the dough, cookie cuts into little bones and I cook them.  My dogs sit a wait for them  My boxer/ lab loves pumpkin straight out of the oven.  This is a great way to use Halloween pumpkins too.

This recipe was easy. I did have to add quite a bit of water to make the dough come together- it was pretty dry and crumbly. My dog loves them.

Wow, this recipe is awesome.  My dog loved them.  The only change I made was I use organic brown rice flour.  Not to mention, the aroma is nice too!

I make them on baking sheet. usually double the pumpkin to make it easier to work with. this time, put the dough in fridge overnite, worked really well, rolled it out thin and partially baked them, then used pizza cutter to make small squares and then backed to crispy perfection...Max loves them!

The dogs were so excited for these they never left the kitchen while i made them!  First I changed the amount of peanut butter from 1/2 cup to 1 cup.  I didn't have any pumpkin so i substituted pasta sauce in place of it.  Instead of whole wheat flour i used mozzarella cheese.  I used 4 pieces of bread to make peanut butter sandwiches so the 1 cup of peanut butter did not go to waste and the dogs loved watching me eat them.  My dogs don't like salt so i used ground beef and added it to the pasta sauce.  I couldn't bother with the other ingredients so i just used lasagna noodles instead.  I ended up making a lasagna and boy was it delicious!  Wish my dogs could've known the pleasure of just how good it was but I'm no bad dog owner and know better than to feed them human food.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!

I read all reviews and increased the pumpkin to 1 cup and increased the peanut butter to 3 T.  I left out the salt.  I dumped everything into my Kitchen Aid mixer and it was a little sticky (as it should have been with the added pumpkin) I added about 1/3 - 1/2 more whole wheat flour and it mixed up very well.  I rolled out on a very lightly dusted board to 1/2 " and cut into 1 1/2" rounds.  Yield 45. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes.  Perfect!  These have no preservatives so should be frozen.  Now, I don't have a dog as I made these for someone who does.  Doggie review TBA!  :-)

My dogs love these!  They literally wait in the kitchen while biscuits are cooking and whine!  I have one dog who is allergic to almost everything. So, I substitute the wheat flour for rice flour so he can eat them.

Super easy to make and my dogs love them!!! I even have a very picky husky and he goes nuts when he smells this dough. They are simple and healthy and don't include ingredients that are harmful to dogs like some other home recipes.

I do not usually like to rate a recipe if I did't follow it exactly as written (at least the first time), but unfortunately I was not able to follow the recipe as the dough was SOO stiff, I couldn't use as much as was called for.  I doubled the recipe & then followed the recipe exactly, but once my mixed stopped moving after adding only 3 cups of flour out of 5, I dumped the dough out of my mixing bowl & kneaded in approx. another 1/2 cup or so by hand.  Just enough so that the dough was not sticky & could be rolled out- somewhere between the consistency of sugar cookie dough & pizza dough.  Aside from that, the dogs LOVE these & I found that the dough was extremely easy to work with. I even rolled, cut & re-rolled until I used every last bit of it.  I also only baked them for about 30-35 minutes as they were starting to burn- will be making again!!

Our three dogs loved them!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I subbed a half cup of oatmeal for a half cup of flour.  The dough was mixed in a Kitchen Aid mixer and was super easy to roll out and cut into shapes.   After about 30 minutes of baking, I turned the oven off and left the door closed for about an hour longer and they got nice and crisp.   The dough shapes were placed real close together on the baking sheet as they do shrink.  One recipe made a little more than two half-sheet pans (18x13") of dog bone-shaped cookie treats.

I made these and my picky Pekingese appears to like them. My Vet has suggested giving her pumpkin for regularity so this recipe looked like a good way to incorporate this into her diet. I used a whole can of pumpkin (very important to use pure pumpkin)and added an extra spoonful of peanut butter. I think the salt is important due to it being a chemical agent with the flour and not so much a taste factor. I did have trouble manipulating the dough so I rolled it in a log and have it in the freezer. It made a very large amount and I will work on my technique of how to slice these in a better way. The first small batch looks like mini biscuits and I am not too happy with them but Lucy is eating them so that's what's important. Coming from my kitchen and not from China is very important!

This recipe was quite easy to make and follow.  I was very pleased with the smell, look and feel of the dog cookies.  Of course my dogs absolutely love them.  My only question is that some of the dough had bubbles in them making the cookies puffy versus flat.  Is that normal or could I have done something different to avoid this? Thanks!

My husky/lab cross, Mya, LOVES these cookies. They are so easy and inexpensive to make! Instead of whole wheat flour, I used brown rice flour, as it is easier for dogs to digest. I used the suggestions in other reviews and used about 3/4 cup of pumpkin and 3 heaping tablespoons of peanut butter. I started out using my hand mixer, and then kneaded the dough with my hands at the end. I have made the cookies both by rolling them into little tubes (icebox cookie style) and by rolling the dough flat and using cookie cutters to cut out shapes. Both turned out great. I actually found it easier to cut out shapes than to coax the dough into a tube-shape. Those people who have commented about the cookies molding, probably did not bake them long enough. I cooked my cookie cut outs for 40 min and my little icebox cookies for 30 min. These cookies are meant to be hard all the way through, like a store bought Milkbone. I have had mine in a sealed container for almost a week and they still look and smell great! I am putting a combination of cookies into cellophane bags to give to all Mya's doggy friends for Christmas!

I've been making these for a while now, the first time I followed the suggestions of increasing the pumpkin and peanut butter, but it came out way too sticky and was difficult to work with. The second time I made it I used the amounts in the original recipe (but omitted the salt) and they came out perfect. I suggest combining everything but the flour first and then adding in the flour gradually, the dough does become stiff so it is easier to work with your hands, when rolling out flour the surface first and your hands to prevent from sticking.

These treats turned out excellent! Insted of rolling and cutting like a jelly roll, I cut them with dog bone cutters! I also used stocking and gingerbread men to cut cookies for my Westie's stocking. I used dog frosting I found on the internet to decorate these and they were adorable! I used red and green food dye for the frosting I put on the holiday stocking treats! 5 tails up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;)

There were only 2 small changes that I made to this recipe: 1) I subbed 1/2c flour with 1/2c oats. 2) No salt. I rolled them into balls and pressed them with a fork and they came out pretty cute :) My dogs are very picky eaters, and they love 'em! Thanks for sharing!

I made these yesterday and my VERY PICKY 10 year old pup loves them. I wanted to figure out their shelf life though. How long can these last in a cookie jar or zip loc?

EDIT: I also wanted to add that I see some people suggesting to add water. DON'T DO IT!! If you want your treats to last longer, you want LESS moisture, not more

My chocolate lab can't get enough of these tasty treats. :) 
Definitely didn't use a whisk for the dough. I used my hands to mend it together and added a little extra pumpkin instead of water. They turned out perfect!

Love this recipe.  Cut them into 1" squares.  Didn't have Peanut Butter but did have Nutella so I used that. Used Pamela's Biscuit Gluten Free mix instead of the flour because one grand dog is allergic to wheat. Aware that chocolate isn't good for dogs, but didn't think this small amount would hurt. Will do this recipe again with peanut butter next time. Kneaded dough with a bit of GF flaxseed meal on a double vinyl mat from Sweet Wise that's perfect to roll these out. Baked on parchment paper on cookie sheet for only 30 minutes and allowed to cool on sheet.  Perfect!

These are fantastic! Add an additional 1/2 cup pumpkin and a little extra flour for kneeding (you need to hand kneed these) and rolling out and you are good to go. The pup has been pawing at the oven ever since I put this batch in!!!

My Boston loves, loves, loves these treats.  I like to make them a bit thinner so they aren’t as thick because with my experience they separate and are not as dry, but with a Boston’s throat and their tendencies to swallow whole with a narrow throat opening, she would react by bringing it back up.  I make them all the time and she hasn’t gotten tired of them yet.

Although I have no dog myself, I make these treats for the therapy dogs that visit the hospital I volunteer at.  They love these treats.  As soon as the dogs are finished "working" - and they do work, they come to my desk for the treats before leaving.  First time I baked the "cookies" my husband thought they were for him because they smelled so good coming out of the oven.

These are easy to make and my dog loves them! I used a heart-shaped cookie cutter that I already had. I like making them because you know what's in them and they are healthy. I may also make them for my friends and family that have dogs! Highly recommend!

whats nice about this recipe is that you can easily alter it for dogs with allergies...we use organic pumpkin, organic applesauce, brown rice flour, the cinnamon, and homemade peanut butter....my girls just love these, and they keep well in the fridge since they dont have a preservative in them....thanks so much for sharing!!!!!

Great recipe.  Dogs love it and it is so much more healthy than store bought dog treats.  I took suggestion from others and added more pumpkin, more peanut butter and 1 cup of oats.  I used a cookie scoop on a greased cookie sheet.

My two dogs are really fussy and they loved them. I thought all this trouble and they probably won't eat them. But they love them. Will pass this recipe on to friends
I only made 1/2 a recipe didn't change anything. Next time it will be the whole recipe.

These treats have been a HUGE hit with every dog I know. The dough can be a little challenging to work with, but it's worth it. Just add a little extra extra pumpkin or peanut butter if it becomes to dry. The doggies will not object!

I tried them and thought they had no flavor even after doubling the pumpkin, but the dog sure loved them!  As another reviewer commented, treat the dough like pie crust dough: add one tablespoon of water at a time until the dough is workable.

One of our dogs has issues with her anal glands and the vet is always telling us to give her pumpkin - this is a great way to make sure she is still getting what she needs healthwise while feeling like it's a treat, not torture. These turned out so cute! Minimal ingredients and easy to make. For those looking to make them, keep in mind the "Add water as needed"! Otherwise they will never turn out!

I made these as drop cookies, about a Tablespoon each. The dogs knew they were for them, they even liked the raw dough. And after baking, they are sitting there looking at the container, wanting more. I'll make these again!

The dough was extremely sticky; went through an extra 1/2 cup of flour just to keep it from sticking to everything! They are very easy to make and a quick recipe- and my dog loves them! Will definitely be making these again! They came out a nice light orange as well, so I used a maple "dog frosting" mix I had to frost. Perfect fall or Thanksgiving treat!

I showed this recipe to my mom, and she just had to try it, we have 2 large dogs, and a medium dog, and they all love them so much, she can't keep up, but it is a lot better for them than other dog treats, we did substitute rice flour instead though, since dogs shouldn't have wheat or corn flour

Two sets of very large paws up! Both my wolfhounds love them. I found it much easier to work with if I added only 2c of flour then used the other 1/2c to add a little at a time as I was working the dough. Lift the dough and put a little on the bottom, then a little more on top, work it in, repeat as necessary. This helped with the 'sticky' problem and I actually didn't use the whole 1/2c. I made sure to cook them until they were hard and let them dry before putting them in the dogs' cookie jar.

My dog absolutely loves these!!!  So happy to have an alternative to the store bought dog biscuits.  I followed the recipe with the alterations that were suggested of doubling the pumpkin and a little bit more peanut butter.

Our pug loves these. She really likes squash and pumpkin and even prefers these over a liver cookie!  Made the recipe as is but added extra pumpkin instead of water for moisture, 1-2tbsp. Had the kids make the cookies into balls the flatten into small cookies (1") and she loves thm.  Baked till dry, slightly brown.

My tiny furbabies LOVE LOVE LOVE these! Use 1 c pumpkin and 4T of peanut butter and have yet to find a pup that won't eat these up.  So simple to make and I feel so much better knowing what my dogs are eating.

My dogs love these!  I gave them out as holiday gifts, and my friends' dogs loved them too.  I add more pumpkin and more PB.  Way better than store bought treats.

My son and I made these for our Labs for Christmas and they loved them.  Not saying much for Labs, I know, as they will eat pretty-much anything, but they had a nice consistency and they kept very well.

I was a little skeptical of this recipe but it turned out great. My little cocker loved them! One tip: keep a close eye on the oven. Mine were done in around 20 minutes rather than 40 minutes.

My puppies love these!  I add ground flax seed for some of the flour.  I have also used AP flour instead of wheat.  Either way my dogs are happy.

My girl LOVES these   She is older and has GI trouble with some of the meds she is one.  My vet told me Pumpkin which she will eat but I have struggled with HOW to feed it to her.  I have tried several recipes but She LOVES these.  I increased the pumpkin and added a spoonful of brown sugar but otherwise PERFECT!

These were easy to throw together!  I used 1 cup of pumpkin and added a 1/2 cup of quick-cook oats.  I rolled the dough out and cut into various sized squares.  Gave half to my mom and the other half to a friend and their dogs both love them!

These were great!  My extremely finicky Jack Russel loved them--as did her not so picky sister!  I cut them into bone shapes and baked them about 40 minutes (the perfect time for the size I made).  These were so easy, I'll make them for all my friend's dogs for Christmas!

My puppy LOVED these! They were really easy to make, I used my hands to mix everything and knead it together so there wasn't much water used. I baked the FULL 45 minutes so they came out great and crunchy! Will definitely keep making them for my puppy!!

My dogs ate these but were not thrilled about them.  I left out the cinnamon, could it really make that much difference???
