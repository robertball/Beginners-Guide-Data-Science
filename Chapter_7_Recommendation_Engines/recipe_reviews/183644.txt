The children liked this a lot, especially since they could get hands on into the production of these candies/cookies. However, I made 1 inch balls and that was a lot more then 30. I wonder if the cloves are even neccessary so I decided to leave them overnight and see how that effects the taste. As is without the cloves the children went CrAzY for them. I will likely make them again but try another flavor like orange for variety.

These were surprisingly good! After making the balls and rolling them, I had my doubts about what they would be like because it looked like kitty poop lol, but after letting them stand for a couple hours, they were firm enough to pick up and were really tasty.

I did have to add another 1/4 cup of graham cracker crumbs to get it to hold together, but this is definitely going into my recipe box. Next time we'll make them with orange Jell-O and add a touch of nutmeg.

Thanks for the great recipe! More people should try this recipe out :)

These are a fun "sugar plum" treat.  I made them and they are sweet, but they turned out really cute and the kids LOVE them.  My husband being included in the kids.  We did a box of rum balls, old fashioned sugar plum and these and it was a lovely gift. We are going to serve them on Christmas Eve when we do the Night before Christmas story. Thank you for the recipe, it will be a fun treat!

I made these yesterday. They look like uncooked meatballs with sugar on them.  The cloves smell great but I can imagine someone putting the cookie in their mouth without removing the clove.  The cookies are way too sweet.  I will not make these again.

This was a very artificially flavoured (i.e. jello) cookie.  Nobody in my family liked it.  If this is what real sugar plums tastes like I'm sure there were no "visions" of sugar plums dancing in their heads, but rather nightmares.

I took these to one of my wife's concerts last year.  People looked at them, were a tad skeptical, but then tasted.  Soon they were calling others to try them.  They were gone in no time.  In fact, on a tableful of goodies, they were the first one's gone.  This year I'll make more.

I liked the idea of this recipe,but they are SOOOO sticky! my 4 yr old didn't even want to make more then 2 because they where sooo sticky. I ended up using a melon baller and cooking spray so they wouldn't stick. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or not. But they are good, a little too sweet though. maybe they would better with a different flavor. we might try these again when my daughter is a little older.

They were ok.  Easy to make but difficult to work with.  They were easier to roll if you put the "dough" in the fridge for a while.

LOVE THESE!  I made my second batch today:-)  The ingredient list is an odd combination, but it comes together nicely.  The mixture  really does look like raw meat, but they are absolutely adorable once you roll the balls and put the clove in.  I thought about not using the clove, but it makes a huge difference in appearance.  Mine are much smoother than the photo here.  I used the pre-made crumbs in the box.  I don't know if that helps, but they look really smooth.  I was worried they would be squishy, but the jello sets up after a little while and they are plenty firm.  Planning on making these every year!

These cookies were fun to make, although abit sticky.  I had to add more graham cracker to make it easier to form the balls.  I took them to a Cookie Exchange and they were a big hit, especially when no one had ever seen one before.   They are especially great for those who love coconut.  I'm taking them to a Party tomorrow, and again next weekend.

I love this recipe, because it is so easy to make.  Everyone else loves these because no one has even seen a sugar plum.  I hate coconut, so I just replace the coconut with extra graham cracker crumbs.  Also, you can buy graham cracker crumbs or I just put the graham crackers in sandwich bags and let the kids beat them.  I think this is the kids favorite part of making theses.

I think that these are good but definitely an acquired taste. Other reviews mentioned that more graham cracker was required so I added half a cup more based on their reviews. I found that it was perfect and rolled easily. Will make again but next time will try some different touches.

Sugar Plums have been a favorite in my family since well before I was born (I am 47).  I cannot remember a Christmas without them.  Some advice on the preparation... Time is of the essence when making these if you want them to be perfect little plums.  The jello starts to set once you add the liquid ingredients and if you do not form into balls quickly enough, they will start to crumble as you continue to try to form them.  Do not try to make a double batch at once, you will not have time (unless you have at least two speedy helpers).  I make them with Christie Vanilla wafers, crushed into crumbs (I like this better than graham crumbs).  When you are ready to insert the cloves into the balls (they would have been rolled in hello at this point), remove the ball tip from the clove and insert the remaining stem all the way into the plum so that you just see a star on the surface of the plum (kind of looks like what you see on an orange).  Let in plums sit out for an hour or so before putting into any container.  I recommend waiting a day before serving as the clove will flavor the plum (I find they taste the absolute best after a couple days).  Do not forget to tell whoever treats themselves to one of these to remove the stem(the clove) as chewing on this is not pleasant to most people.  For the person that said these are too liquid,  you HAVE to use SWEETENED condensed milk, not the other condensed milk (sweetened condensed milk is very, very thick).

I made these for a cookie giveaway and they were a hit, even with the ppl that don't care for coconut. It did need 1/4c extra crumbs to make them stiff enough to roll.

We thought it was a bit too sweet the first time so we changed out the second Strawberry jello with a cranberry one.  This made the cookies  a darker red, but gave it a good tart flavor.  We also used the ends of dark chocolate Poky sticks instead of the clove  to resemble the stems.  This combo made them disappear much more quickly.

I have made these for years. I use vanilla wafers, or simple cookies blitzed up in place of Graham wafers, and I use blue jello for variation.

Way too liquidy, and I tried really hard to save this, adding more coconut and even a lot of flour to thicken it up but it was still very difficult and messy to work with. Also if you are just using the clove stems as a garnish and not for taste I learned today they are very expensive so would recommend something else as a substitute

Made these for a Christmas office party and they were a HUGE hit.  Sweet-tart and a nice break from the ooey, gooey rich offerings.  There were MANY requests for the recipe.  VERY easy to make.
