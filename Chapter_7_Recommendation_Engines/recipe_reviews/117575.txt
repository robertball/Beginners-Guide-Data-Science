Love it! Tastes amazing! But, just as a side note, if you're a beginner at canning, apples don't set the same way strawberry or other jams set. It won't be solid, even after the cans seal themselves. Apples have too much acid to set solidly. I learned that from my sister-in-law after I questioned her about the texture of this jam. Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was a very easy and flavorful recipe!! I used strawberries instead of apples. I also used my food processor to chop the fruit (I don't like big pieces). I simmered the fruit with only 1 1/2 cups of sugar for about 1 hour instead of 20 minutes. The end result turned out great. I will definitely make this recipe again!

This was truly good.  I tweaked this a bit as I used 4 cups rhubarb and 2 cups apples and it was lovely.  yum.  It made about 6 cups so only about 4 jars of jam.

YUM! I was a little hesitant at first but this recipe is amazing! I followed the recipe to a tee - until I got to the pectin part. I decided it was thick enough for me without the added pectin so I left it out. Fabulous! Thanks for the recipe.

Yummmy!  Tasted like apple pie!  I boiled the fruit, water, and sugar for about 15 minutes...the final product ended up a little thick so I'd recommend making sure the fruit is soft enough before you can it.  Don't forget the cinnamon- it adds a wonderful kick!

DELICIOUS!  But not as expected.  Very apple-y!!  Also had to run it through a food mill at the end, as the apples did not entirely cook down enough.  There were some awkwardly large chunks I wanted to squish in there.
I would go as far as 4c. rhubarb - 2c. apples or even 5 to 1 for a stronger rhubarb flavor!  
Rather sweet; even with granny smith apples to go with the rhubarb.  Tastes like an apple pie jam, really.  Will take it into account for next time!
(Also: after waiting the full 20 minutes hoping the apples would finish cooking down, it had cooked to about half the expected amount!  I have three sadly empty half-pint jars left, lonely on the counter.  Will need to find something else to fill them with. :D )

Changed just one thing: I used chia seeds instead of pectin. General rule i use is 2 T for every 16 oz of fruit. This recipe, I ended up using 6 T. Will likely try it with just 4 T next time since I don't think it needed that much. Turned out quite tasty.  Thx for the recipe!

This Jam reminds me of my absolute favorite pie in the world, apple rhubarb. So easy to make and just the right amount of sweet tart.

Fabulous! Only downside is that if you have Green Victoria rhubarb (instead of red) the jam turns out brown but it still tastes amazing!

I used 4 big cups of rhubarb and the remaining 2 cups a mix of apples and strawberries, and it was delicious.  I kept the sugar to 1.5 cups and used the full tablespoon of cinnamon. Such a wonderful jam.  I've been caught eating it with a spoon! Far healthier than the strawberry freezer jam I made last (4 cups of sugar to 2 cups of berries!). Also, I don't can, so I let it set up for a day and put it in the freezer. Seems to be working wonderfully!

Yummy. Just like others have said, it's a little like apple butter but with a more tartness. I used 3 cups of rhubarb and 2 cups apples and it was perfect.

My daughter calls this "heaven on toast"!  Fabulous recipe.  I used frozen rhubarb from last season so it thickened very quickly.  I suggest dicing the apples fairly small so they'll cook through.

This is a great blend jam that will surely be loved by anyone.  

Adding to the comment from mickey about the texture, my turned out more like a fruit spread than a jam.  Fabulous on biscuits, English Muffins.  Even as a fruit topping would be great.

This jam is amazing. Don’t change anything. If you’re looking for strawberry rhubarb jam, look somewhere else. This is apple rhubarb jam and it is soo good. It’s like having apple pie on top of your toast ?? husband approved! Lol

This recipe makes a very tasty jam! The only thing I would change next time is to leave out the pectin. I like my jam soft, and there is enough pectin in the apples without adding more. Because I don't like the texture of the first batch of jam I made, I have been using it to coat pork roasts before cooking - makes a very tasty and easy dinner!

This recipe is so easy and yummy!!! It has the consistency of apple butter with a tart rhubarb bite.  I thought it was too much cinnamon, but the amount in the recipe is just right.  My Husband loves this on toast.

Very quick and easy recipe.  I did reduce the sugar to 1.5 cups and used half Splenda and half sugar.  Jam still set very well and was still sweet enough for us.  Also did not process.  Really enjoying the jam.  Next summer I will make a double or triple batch!

I agree that the apples will set differently from strawberries, as someone mentioned, but it is the opposite of what was said!

Apples are the source of pectin in the packages you buy, and higher in pectin than any other fruit!!!  

So if you use apples, and boil it longer, no pectin is required. Strawberries are one of the few fruits that do not contain much pectin, so for instance, my mum would always put apples in her strawberry jam so no pectin was required. 

If you use strawberries instead, you may need to boil longer and will need the pectin, because rhubarb is low in it too.

I am making a jam similar to this later, but sorry, I am using wild apples (with skins on), no pectin, and much less (unrefined) sugar. We'll see how it goes : )  I am adding the apples to the rhubarb so that pectin isn't required (otherwise I would make pure rhubarb jam). 

So, I haven't made it and won't make it the same, but gave a five star as folks seem to like it : )

Awesome jam!  My husband, who really only likes strawberry jam, loves it as does my 2 1/2 year old.  I used a little bit less sugar and boiled for a bit longer then recommended, but it works great!

definately a keeper, loved this, made it as written. I only got 4- 8 oz jars.  I did hold back 1/4 cup sugar and mixed that  with pectin before adding.  It set perfectly.

I just used up a batch of rhubarb I had from the garden for this jam, I absolutely loved it, I sure will make this again, really like the sweet & sourness of this jam.

As others stated it tastes like apple pie and is delicious. I was hoping for a rhubarb flavor as well and for me even using 4 cups rhubarb it is totally lost. I seemed to have realized to taste the rhubarb it needs to be pretty much the own ingredient so it doesn’t have any competition.

I made this with apples, leaving both apples and rhubarb in large chunks.  I like it a lot.  It tastes like apple pie!

I followed suggestions by others and changed the ratio to 4 cups rhubarb, 2 cups apple.  I also reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups and kept the cinnamon a 1 Tbsp.  It's still setting but tasting it while it cooked it is delicious.  Just the right amount of tart/sweet.  The cinnamon does change the color of the jam to brown.

Pretty good. I used 5 cups rhubarb and 3 cups apples.  Only 1/2 cup water. Used 1 1/4 cups brown sugar and 1/2 cup white.  I used 1 tbsp of cinnamon but would cut that back next time. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  It still tastes mostly like apple cinnamon. I didn't use the pectin. Made 4 cups total. Will try again.

This was an amazing recipe!!!!  The sweet and slightly tart taste was a great match. I did not use pectin.  I wanted my preserves to be to organic.  I just used 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  Best decision I could have made.  My family loved it.

I made this and it turned out great.  My family liked it much more than the strawberry rhubarb I made which they thought was too sweet.  The only modification I made was that I didn't use the water so that it was a little thicker

This is wonderful! Just made it and I’ve been dirtying a lot of spoons “tasting” this. I do not think the pectin is necessary. When it got time to put it in I decided it didn’t need it. Fast, easy, and tasty!

This has become my favourite jam.  I made it as the recipe but it was just a bit too much cinnamon for me, although very good.  I increased it to 6 cups of rhubarb and five Granny Smith apples leaving everything else the same except reduced the cinnamon to 1.5 tsp and it is just as delicious.  What I love ve about this recipe is how little sugar it takes.  My next experiment was with sour cherries, I used 6 cups rhubarb, 5 cups sour cherry, everything else the same.  Very tart, if you like tart this is very delicious.  I like tart!  Today I am trying blueberry rhubarb with 5 cups blueberries.  Will let me ou know how this turns out.

I actually did the strawberry rhubarb recipe. The only change I made was to use 1/2 a tablespoon of Cinnamon. It was awesome. Everyone loved it.

We made several jams last year but this was the winner. It's a lot like apple pie filling and that's what I love about it. It was easy to make and tasted superb!
