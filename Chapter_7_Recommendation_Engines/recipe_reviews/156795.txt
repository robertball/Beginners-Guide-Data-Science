This dish provided a truly mouth-gasmic experience!! AMAZING! Only thing to put out there.. Anyone who is using Phyllo dough for the first time.. follow the directions on the box first. I had never heard of Phyllo dough and didn't think to read the directions on the box, as most recipes tell you not to follow those. And put a layer of either a cling wrap or aluminum foil down BEFORE the towel. Might sound like a duh thing for most, but for any of the other newbies out there, hope this helps!

This is an interesting dish.  I like the idea, but I'm not sure that the italian seasoning goes with this.  I'm not a huge bbq sauce fan, but bf is, so I thought this would be a good thing for us to try.  I thought it was okay for a bbq sauce laden dish, but bf thought it was a bit weird, and I'm thinking it's the italian seasoning that makes him say that.  I did change it up slightly, as I left out the butter and used Grands flaky biscuits instead of phyllo dough (I tore the biscuits apart--very easy as they flake, and managed three layers of dough that way with one container).  It worked pretty well that way, although I am sure the phyllo makes this lighter so I made a bit of a heavier dish.  I halved the recipe so we wouldn't have weeks of leftovers (it's just the two of us!).  It's quite easy, just takes a few steps.  Overall, this is good; I think we just aren't too sure about the Italian seasoning part.  Thanks for the recipe!

pomplemousse: it was not the italian seasoning that made it taste weird--it was the biscuits. Grand biscuits taste nothing like phyllo dough spread with butter. Please re-try. I am not into cheddar with chicken so I used mozerella. Recipe was very tasty. I think any white cheese would work

Only one change and that was to use ground chicken instead of diced.  This was ok, very much just BBQ chicken with some cheese, almost tasted like sloppy joes.  It was nothing special and certainly not worth the effort and expense of the phyllo.

With a few changes this recipe is AWESOME, only reason its getting a four is because of the changes!!! We didn't have any Phyllo dough, so we used croissants. We cooked the chicken, used three small yellow peppers a small red onion and a bottle of sweet baby rays BBQ sauce (very mild... would be great with some heat if desired).  Only put the croissants on top, put a layer of cheese below and above the croissants (Made it cheesy but not tooo cheesy) was great! Kind of like a lasagna BBQ chicken pot pie...turned out fabulous! !! Will be making again with these changes. After trying with the croissant.. not to anxious to try with the phyllo dough!
