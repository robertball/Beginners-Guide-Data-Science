This recipe was great!  I used milk chocolate chips on top instead of the mint and topped it with walnuts instead of pecans.  I also used a whole stick of butter cut up on top.  When I checked it after it had baked 40 minutes, I noticed that some of the cake mix was still dry and crumbly.  I just put some pats of butter on those spots and baked it about 5 more minutes.  I will definitely be making this wonderful dessert again!!

Wonderful taste but mine just didn't "set" properly. Even for a "mud" cake it stayed too loose.  Maybe it was me?

YUMMY! I have had this before, only it was with a yellow cake mix and I liked it. But wow with the devils food made a huge difference. It was even better. I will be making this again. Thanks.

This has more of a "pudding cake" texture rather than one you could cut/slice into pieces.  I went to two stores, neither of which had mint chocolate chips, so I used what I had on hand, semi-sweet chocolate chips.  Another reviewer mentioned that some of the dry cake mix was still visible on top, so I sliced my butter into 12 slices hoping to get better coverage, but that didn't work either.  Not wanting to add more butter (this dessert is decadent enough), I drizzled a little FF half-and-half (was in the fridge) over those spots, put back in the oven for five minutes, and that helped.  The devils food cake was OK with us, and this cake is very easy to make, but we thought it was W-A-A-A-Y too sweet.  Doubtful I'll make it again.

This was just STRANGE.  I should have bailed on the mint chocolate chips, but I had some extra I wanted to use up, which was why I picked this recipe.  It might have been better with regular chocolate chips, but still too sweet for me.  I had to cook this for 10-15 min longer for it to set.

This was VERY rich and I did not like the pineapple and chocolate together. I did not use the mint chocolate chips, either, thank goodness (used regular semi-chocolate chips instead). I can't imagine the combination of those flavors. When I was eating this, I felt like I was eating cake batter, that's how rich it was and it dissolved in my mouth. 

I had to cook this for another 10 minutes and I think it could have cooked a bit longer, but it was boiling over so I took it out. Afterwards I googled and found this is actually a variation of a dump cake which typically cooks for an hour.   I like rich desserts, but this was just too much. I won't be making this again. My son wouldn't even touch the cake and he usually eats anything. I ended up throwing over half of it away.

This recipe is awesome for people like me who can't bake and who don't have the necessary equipment.  There was no mixing required.  It was nice and moist, which is how I like my cake.  I'm not a huge fan of cherries, so I was worried about them, but they really didn't overpower the cake at all.  It wasn't too sweet or rich.  The only thing I changed was I had to use milk chocolate chips instead of mint ones because I couldn't find any in my grocery store.  It's my turn to bring a cake to work, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to take this one.

I hate to leave bad reviews, but I made this for a Thanksgiving desert and not one liked it, not even the kids. I will not make this again.

This was a very quick easy desert.  It tasted like a rich brownie with a little cherry twiest.  The only think I did differently was used milk chocolate chips because I couldn't find any mint ones at the grocery store.  Will make it again!

This is so simple.  I used semi sweet choc chips and dark sweet cherry pie filling. It was elegant.  When placing the butter on top of the mixture make sure to slice paper thin, covering the entire surface of the pan.  This way there is no cake mix on top that is unmixed.
Serve with ice cream and the guests will talk about it forever.

Oh-so-good. Alabama Mud Cake is a definite five-star. I made no changes in the recipe except for a couple of minor adjustments. Used 2/3 cup milk chocolate morsels and covered entire top with thin-sliced margarine. Cooking time: 43 minutes. Thanks to Sharon for submitting this recipe.

I made this recipe almost according to the recipe. I used crushed pineapple in heavy syrup, I did drain some of the syrup.  I could not find mint chips so I used caramel chips.  I mixed the pecans and caramel in with the cake mix and then spread it on top the cherries.  I then put the rest of the caramel and
pecans on top of the cake mix.  It turned out delicious!!!   Easy to prepare and good for a big group.  The group really enjoyed this!!!!  I will make this again :)
