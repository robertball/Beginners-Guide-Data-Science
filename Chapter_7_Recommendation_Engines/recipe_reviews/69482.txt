HEY I'm the first to rate this! You talk about healthy! I used 2 T. lime juice, 1 1/2 lbs. boneless breasts, chopped the pepper & onion, & cut the tomatoes into wedges. Trying to do the low carb thing & my whole family loved it. Easy, too.

This was good and possibly make it again one day.  I liked the tangy flavor, but not out of this world.

I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so used a can of diced tomatoes, drained. The flavor was good, but didn't notice a huge change from the average "chicken" flavor from the marinade. Sure smelled good while it was marinating though.

The chicken turned out well, but I think I used too much tomato (out of a can).  I mixed it with rice, though, which was a good idea to cut down on the soupyness.

This is very good! It ends up being more of a soup, so you may want to keep the pieces of chicken smaller so you don't have to cut them up while you eat.

Really good and easy to make.  I served it over noodles.  It would also be good over rice.  I used two different colored bell peppers and a large can of diced tomatoes in lieu of fresh tomatoes.  The canned tomatoes are so much tastier.

I thought this was quite tasty. I made this recipe exactly as written, only substituting red and orange peppers for the green one. Next time I would marinate the chicken a bit longer, and add a little more lime juice.
EDIT: I have made this many times now and we love it. If you marinate the chicken all day in the fridge, it really boosts the flavour. I use skinless boneless thighs. I have found it is better with fresh tomatoes and adding the ketchup is a must.

It was very good.  I would marinate it longer next time.  I also added 2 tbsp of cayenne pepper and a 1 tbsp of brown sugar.  Our family loves spicy foods. Overall it was good.

This turned out really good and will be added to my list of recurring dinners! I had to adjust it a little based on what I had...like red wine vinegar instead of white wine, thighs instead of a fryer chicken and added cumin and smoked paprika because why not? I also used a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce (didnâ€™t have fresh tomatoes).I read from other reviews about it being soup like, so I made rice for it to go over and it was perfect! Will definitely make this again!
