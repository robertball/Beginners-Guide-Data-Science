Absolutely LOVE these as a meatless alternative to tacos!  I didn't have any taco seasoning (although I scoured my cabinets) so I used some cumin and other spices for a homemade seasoning. My grocery store only had plain tempeh, but I thought the flavor was great as-is.  We topped ours with avocado, salsa, lettuce, and sour cream and ate them on whole wheat tortillas.  This is already in our weeknight rotation as a go-to dinner.  Super quick, the husband loves it, AND it makes just enough for him to take the leftovers to lunch the next day.  LOVE!

I've made this a few times with several variations . I recommend steaming the tempeh for 10 minutes before cooking. This opens it up to absorb more favors.  I add some tri color peppers and jalapeño and instead of taco season I do some chili powder, cumin, cayenne pepper and may throw  some fresh green onions on top.  It's fun to play with the spices and add fresh veggies to make it a more balanced meal. I definitely recommend topping with salsa and guac or avocado.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the recipe I used the first time I ever attempted cooking tempeh. It came out looking exactly like ground beef! It was delicious and I'm really excited to try other tempeh recipes! Thanks!

Wonderful recipe! I used non-seasoned tempeh and thought that there was plenty of flavor. For the taco seasoning, I used two tablespoons of the Taco Seasoning I recipe on this website. I also threw in an extra clove of garlic, which is par for the course with me. Topped with avocado, pico de gallo, and olives. Thank you for sharing!

I changed a lot of it. Used beef bouillon rather than veg broth, fajita seasoning rather than taco. Kept the onions and garlic but added avocado and greens rather than red pepper. I think you can really play around with this recipe to suit your taste.

Great recipe, simple and easy but healthful and tasty. I made a chipotle lime sauce with sour cream, lime juice and chipotle powder to go with it and served it with green onions and chopped grape tomatoes, and I used flour tortillas for serving but I think next time I'll use corn.

Pleasantly surprised with how well this turned out - at first when I sampled the filling it didn't seem like the tempeh "worked" with the taco seasoning but then after adding cheese, cilantro, and salsa, our whole family thoroughly enjoyed it.  I used one of the taco seasoning recipes on this site, used regular tempeh (found that I can just sort of crumble it in the pan rather than shredding it).  I also diced some Yukon Gold potatoes and sauteed them before adding the tempeh and seasonings.

This was my first try with tempeh, and I found it tasty. I used just one tablespoon of olive oil, found that to be plenty. Also used water instead of vegetable broth and chopped up a fresh jalapeño with the onion. I used a taco seasoning recipe from the website. I will make again for sure!

Delicious! Filled corn tortillas with this tempeh mixture and homemade salsa...sooo good! Would have loved to top with guacamole if I had an avacado.
