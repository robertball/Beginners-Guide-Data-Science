I make these cookies every week. My whole family loves them. The only thing I do differently is make them double in size so I get 2 dozen instead of 4. We eat these cookies for a quick on-the-go breakfast. Edited 11/15/07: I am still making these every week for my family. Sometimes I add chocolate chips and coconut.

LOVE these cookies!  I've been making them for about 5 years & they are a staple around here.
I use mostly apple sauce instead of all the oil (just put a skim on top) & usually add a couple of tablespoons of ground flax seed for more nutrition.
Tonight we ran out of the spelt flour we usually use (wheat allergy), so I used a rye/rice flour combo without the flax seeds.  They are awesome!

These cookies are phenomenal!  I love them because they are so chewy and moist...there's nothing worse than dry oatmeal cookies.  Making a big batch before our final exams is a new tradition for me and my sweetheart, who loves raisins.

I think these are the BEST oatmeal cookies I've ever had!  A few alterations....whole wheat flour, 2 tsp. of cinnamon instead of 1, extra virgin olive oil, and of course 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 tsp. pure stevia powder (I love to cut back on the sugar always).  My kids love these cookies.  I've been making these over and over since I've found this recipe. Thank you!

Yes, they are easy...no, they are not cookies.

I too followed the recipe to a T and they are more like spongy cake. Pretty disappointed.

These cookies were amazing, I didn't put any raisins in them because I don't like them. But even without them they were sooo good my favorite hands down.

This did not turn out like an oatmeal cookie at all. 
I did sub applesauce and a little oil (for the 3/4 c. oil) but other reviewers did so with success.
It turned out much more like an oatmeal cookie-flavored scone! Having said that... with some butter it was actually quite a good scone and I may make them again... AS SCONES! As a cookie NO way.

These cookies are not only delicious but they are incredibly versitile.  We added cherry flavored "Craisins", dried cranberries, chocolate chips and slivered almonds and coconut.  They are always moist and delicious too!  I start with plain for one kid, then beef em up with what the other kids like as I go.  Awesome recipe and a true keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

I love these cookies! I used ingredients I already had on hand, so this was very quick and easy to do. I am about to bake them again as the first batch is all gone from the other day. A keeper :-)

I have never made oatmeal cookies...I hate to make cookies at all but my husband was wanting them so I tried this To the raisens I added hot applejuice instead of water I replaced all the oil for 1/2 and 1/2 with applesauce I added a cup of coconut I suggest if you like a flatter cookie, flatten with the back of a spoon before baking...these do not spread also let the batter sit for about 10 minutes before putting on cookie sheet so that the oats will sbsorb the liquid

So easy, so tasty and the only things I changed was the amount of nutmeg because it has a tendency to be a strong spice and I used golden rasins because that is all I had, minus the nuts. I will use those next time!!

I would've given this three stars, but it was healthier than the usual oatmeal cookie recipe, so I gave it four.  They were definitely tasty, but I'm not sure if I'd make them again.

This recipe was easy, but not very good at all. There wasn't much taste to them at all. Wouldn't make again from this recipe.

Countless batches...eight years after my first review:   I am now baking these gems at 10 minutes and 30 seconds and I am using a round measuring TABLESPOON to scoop them out.  Best results so far.   I recommend using either fresh nutmeg or high-quality jarred nutmeg.  I use a mixture of whole-grain spelt flour and white spelt along with oat flour.   I substituted spoonfuls of these flours with a T of almond flour and a T of rye flour (healthiest).  Results:  Fantastic : D

2008 Review:
I consider myself to be a great cook but at the most a mediocre baker.  That's why I am SO HAPPY with this recipe!  The cookies were scrumptious!

These are the changes I made based on previous reviews and other research on cookie making:

1) Substituted 1/2 cup craisins and 1/2 cup chocolate chips for raisins.

2) Used 1/2 teasp fresh-grated nutmeg and 1 1/2 teasp cinnamon instead of 1+1.

3) Used 1/2 cup oat flour + 1/2 cup whole wheat flour + 1 cup high gluten flour (to promote chewiness) instead of two cups of regular flour.

10 minutes was the perfect baking time.

FINALLY a delicious and easy cookie I can make for my dairy allergic daughter.  Thanks so much for submitting this recipe!  I added an extra tsp. cinnamon and used 1 cup each of whole wheat and all purpose flour.  I didn't have enough nuts so I added wheat germ to make up the difference.  Next time I will add even more wheat germ for even more nutrition.  I also baked these for 20 min. in a 9x13 glass pan for bar cookies.  Turned out great!!

Although everyone thought they were 
tasty, I wouldn't make them again.

I agree 100% with Foodninja -mine too turned out like little sponges.... I used normal oats rather than quick ones and thought that was the problem but after reading other comments, I can see other people used quick oats and theirs turned out like sponges too. I hate to give a recipe 1 star out of 5 but this one was a complete let down.

This was an ok recipe. Like another reviewer I thought these were more like a scone than a cookie. I tried various sizes and like it best when I used my mini muffin pan to bake them. They tasted good but I wanted a more traditional cookie. I omitted the nuts due to allergies.

These taste good.  Following the recipe almost to the letter (omitted raisins because I don't like oatmeal raisin cookies, and subbing almonds for walnuts)there is no way the finished product looks like the picture that accompanies this recipe.  Usually, when it's a drop cookie recipe, the cookies spread on their own.  These stay in the little haystacks you drop from the spoon, and don't get any bigger, either.   Again, they're not bad.  They're cakey, spiced oat cookies that definitely bring a scone more to mind than a traditional cookie.  Those looking for a traditional oatmeal cookie should probably look to another recipe, but these aren't bad cookies, by any means.

This cookie is great. It reminds me of a lovely spice cookie my grandma used to make. I think next time I might use allspice or mace in the cookies to give them even more zing. I used spelt flour for the wheat and honey for the sugar. Although I try to avoid butter in my baking, I think these would be even better with butter instead of oil (everything is better with butter). For the reviewers who thought these weren't cookie-like, I think they just haven't eaten enough variety of cookies. These cookies are cakey in texture, but I have many favorite cookie recipes from childhood that have the same texture.

Made these the low-fat version, substituting oil for apple sauce.  Not bad :)

I was looking for an easier version of oatmeal cookies and found this recipe.  No butter to cream or mixer/beater to use (although I did have to use the chopper for walnuts).  I was pleased with the results, but since I omitted the raisins/water mixture, I found I needed to add maybe 1/4 cup or less of water because the batter was a bit crumbly to make drop cookies.

Great cookies -- hubby loved them too. Very cake-like as others have stated. I substituted apple sauce for oil, didn't add raisins, and instead added a little chocolate chips and there were amazing!

These should be marketed as a "healthy oatmeal cookie alternative." I had a hard time getting the dough to hold together. I added a little milk, and finally added some extra brown sugar (maybe 1/3 c.) and a little more olive oil to get them to stick together and function as a cookie dough. I think there's too much salt in them as well. Not bad.....just not great either

These were really good. They have a great oat flavor. They are a soft, cakey oatmeal cookie, so as long as you are expecting that, you will likely be happy with the recipe. We used chocolate chips, pecans instead of walnuts, apple sauce for the oil, and whole grain pastry flour in place of all of the all purpose flour. This is the perfect sort of recipe to sub whole grain flour without compromising flavor or texture. I also added 1/2 a cup of coconut, and left out the nutmeg.   I suppose with all the changes we made, I cannot write a pure review on the recipe, but I kept all of the original measurements, and used the recommended cooking guidelines. They were quick and easy to make, used ingredients that most people always have on hand, and turned out quite delicious. I do recommend making them if you like a soft texture every now and then.

I thought these came out great.  I didn't use the raisins but did add some of the water that they called for.  I think they need a tough more salt but other than that they were great. I made half with chocolate chips and half without.

No doubt an easy recipie, however, the texture is more cake-like than a cookie.  It maintains its shape while baking which is nice, but it's not what I'm looking for when it comes to finding the perfect oatmeal cookie.

I made these cookies yesterday and I am glad I did. First, I took others advise and I added other goodies to the recipe. By far this is the easiest and best oatmeal cookie recipe. I love my kitchen-aid mixer and I use it a lot, but sometimes it's nice to mix by hand. This is what I did to this recipe.... I added 1/3 c. ground almonds, raisins, cranberries, blueberries, and cherries to equal 1 cup. I added about 1/3 c. MORE brown sugar. I used brandy to soak the fruit. Instead of 3/4 c. oil I used 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/4 c. oil. I added a sprinkle of cloves and ginger, and 3 ounces white chocolate chopped, along with 3 ounces coconut. I could not believe how good they came out and I don't feel guilty about eating them. Thanks for the base recipe Darla.

These are ok, not the best.  I followed the recipe but replaced a 1/2 c of oil with unsweetened applesauce.  Once mixed I found it very wet, and needed to add an extra 1/2 to 3/4 cup of flour a more thicker cookie batter.  They taste ok, a bit bland, maybe a touch more sugar.  I will try again, but tweak it a little bit, may try using craisins.

I did this faithfully, and the cookies came out "cake like". They were too moist, though the taste was good. The cookies also stuck to the baking sheet and came out funny on the bottom.  Sorry; I just didn't work out for me.

Wow, I was surprised at how much I like these!  Soft on the inside, crispy on the outside.  The spices add a really good flavor.  Admittedly, I soaked my raisins in rum, not water...

Well the consistency is a little less than cookie-like...but the taste is great.  I didn't add the raisins but instead did chocolate chips and coconut flakes along with a little extra brown sugar.  I did have to add a bit of water to the mix because it seemed so dry but by a bit I mean a tablespoon maybe.  I think I'll try some other recipes...but will probably make these again anyways.

Veery easy as it says. Great taste! Made with my 4 year old friend, and he loves them as do my own children. Don't care to much for raisins so we changed it up a bit, some raisins, cranberries and cut up apricots, plus 1 cup chocolate chips. (My husband would say more chocolate)Reminds me of a hermit cookie very soft and love the spices.

this recipe is easy and quick to whip together. these cookies are pretty thick (they are oatmeal, after all) and are not like typical flat, round cookies. i made the recipe as listed, except i threw in a generous 1/3 cup of chocolate chips. they were very tasty, sufficiently moist, and not overpoweringly sweet. if you have a major sweet tooth, you might consider throwing in another 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

Fantastic recipe.  I used apple sauce instead of the oil and used 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.  I made these for a play date for 3 two year olds, (2 very picky eaters) and they LOVED them.

I had to hurry and give some away and put the rest in the freezer because they were so good I didn’t want to eat them all.  The dough was sticky and I was worried they would stick to the pan but they didn’t.  These seem healthier so I had some for breakfast with my tea..  I did add some dried dates to the recipe.

I made this and it was YUUUMMMMMYYY. I didn't have any nutmeg so I doubled up on cinnamon. also didn't have any raisins or walnuts so I omitted the walnuts and substituted the reasons for small hucks of fresh apple. OMGN they are SO good. Not too strong and not too weak of a flavour. Perfect.

This recipe as far as a soft oatmeal cookies spot on, however, needs at least 1/2 cup of white or brown to be added to this recipe. If you like a less sweet cookie, this is the recipe for you.

So, I'm a vegan, and I've been toying around with vegan-izing non-vegan recipes. I subbed 2 tablespoons of cornstarch and 4 tablespoons of water for the eggs. I also used 1/2 a cup of cranberries and 1/2 cup of vegan chocolate chips instead of a cup of raisins. Even the house's pickiest eater loved them!

I made these cookies and they came out dry. On top of that it was clearly not enough sugar. I added chocolate chips for extra flavor and that was all I could taste including the nutmeg.

I am a Pastry Chef and was experimenting with new online recipes.. I don't usually write reviews but, please do not attempt this recipe. I followed the recipe to the T.. pastry chef- precise measurements are the key!  I came out with a spongy creamed oatmeal cake-like something. Bad mouth feel, flavor off  and just flat out not good!

This recipe was too spongy. The cookies tasted more like a muffin than cookies. I gave it two stars because my kids ate them nonetheless.

I love these cookies and everyone that tasted it at work loved them. Now, I didn't use all the ingredients exactly. I just used:

- One egg instead of two
- 1 Cup of oats
- 2 Teaspoons of Cinnamon instead of 1, But next time I will use one whole Tablespoon instead.
- 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves (Goes perfect with cinnamon)

You can add just a little little bit of salt more than asked in the recipe, but just a bit more. 

After following the instruction of mixing all the dry ingredients in one big bowl, I accidently poured the 3/4 cup of oil on top of the oatmeal which was the last ingredient I have added. I noticed that the oatmeal started to soak the oil in, so I started to poor the soaked raisins and water over the mix as well as the beaten egg that I had already prepared. I ended up with an oily dough that wasn't too soft, but that I could knead. I took little pieces of the dough and made them into balls and them gave them a flat cookie shape and put them on a large tray. The cookies take more than 13 minutes to cook. It takes probably like 20 min. On my electric oven I turned on the upper section so I could toast them well.

I removed them hot from the tray with a spatula and placed them on another tray over a piece of kitchen towel tissues in order to remove any moisture that could moist the cookies. The cookies seemed soft, but that was because they were still hot. When the cookies cooled down, they were, crunchy, sweet with a salty after taste! Lovely!

Flavor was ok, but I like sweeter cookies. Also they just didn't form right for me at all... They were difficult to work with. Maybe I just messed up somewhere, but it wasn't worth the mess. I won't be using this recipe again...tma

These cookies are awesome!The only thing I did differently is added 3 tablespoons of extra flour and I allowed the raisins to soak with the oatmeal mixture before adding the the dry ingredients.

The flavor of these oatmeal cookies was close to what I was looking for, not too sweet. I found that the recipe didn't have enough nuts or raisins or maybe the amount of nutmeg just overpowered their flavor. I was definitely not a fan of the texture. Too cake like, not chewy the way I like an oatmeal cookie to be. I might try it again, if I needed to make cookies and I was out of butter or shortening, if I could figure out how to improve the texture.

These cookies are very good. They are soft and cakey. I added a half a can of Libby's pumpkin because I love pumpkin oatmeal. The only thing missing from mine are the walnuts and that is because I didn't have any in the house. These would be wonderful if they had the nuts.

I ran out of vegetable oil, so I substituted 2 sticks of butter which worked just fine. I also used whole wheat flour, and these were delicious. A very simple recipe, and I love how it instructs you to mix all the dry stuff first and then add the wet ingredients. Much easier than trying to mix the raisins into a sticky batter at the very end. I highly recommend this recipe and agree with another reviewer who said these are great for a quick breakfast too because they're not too sweet.

These came out a little cake like,but were still yummy! I added semi-sweet mini morsels instead of raisins, only because we were out of raisins. My family liked them, so I may make them again.

I love oatmeal raisin cookies but these didn't have the flavour I was expecting. I have grown up kids and they have kids and my family just didn't like them much. Too dry and excuse me but kindof tasteless.If anyone has a better recipe and would like to share, I would love to try it.

I absolutely love this recipe. I followed teh exact recipe and was very happy with teh results. Then I made it with 1/2 cranberries, 1/2 dark chocolate chips in place of the raisins and they were a huge hit. Inspired by another reviewer's comment of a breakfats cookie- I used applesauce in place of the oil, 1/2 whole wheat flour, an extra half cup of fruit (cranberries and raisins), and baked them about twice as large for about 14 minutes. I was really happy with the results of these. This is a fantastic base recipe and also easily tweaked for a dessert or morning treat. Thanks!

Was too dry for my taste buds. The kids dunked them in milk and liked them. Will not make again. Sorry.

This is the first recipe that I made that did not turn out so good. I know a little bit about baking. I followed the recipe except for the raisins and water. I accomadated for the water but, these cookies were not to good. I had to make a glaze to moisten them. Msybe I cooked them too long. I had two pans in the oven at the same time so I cooked them until they turned brown at the edges.

This recipe was pretty good for what I was trying to achieve. I worked at one of those cookie stands in the mall when I was in high school (100 yrs ago) and used to love to make this cookie as one huge one the size of the baking sheet where it could be cut into squares? well thats what I did w/this recipe. The raisins gave it just the right amount of sweetness. I liked it, and it served its purpose as I plan to take it with me on a trip as a "hold-us-over" snack. I made it as the recipe stated. Thanks for sharing.

I liked these, but there were a few things I would do differently next time. I will add less cinn. and nutmeg. They were REALLY strong. Also, I would add a tad bit more brown sugar. These weren't as sweet as I like. In fact they weren't sweet at all!. But other then that they were very good, and I will make them again (just tweeked) I liked the suggestion of another poster on here about making alot as using a fast breakfast. These would be good for that because they weren't sweet! I will try that. Oh I forgot to add that I didn't add the raisins or nuts. I just kept them plain.

Very good! I replaced the nuts and raisins for chocolate chips and they were a hit.

Everyone enjoyed these cookies.  I made a couple of substitutions based onmy family's tastes.  I substituted chocolate chips instead of the raisins, and also used an extra virgin coconut oil instead of vegetable oil which gave the cookies an added subtle flavor.  Very nice.

These were just ok for me, I found them to be too cakey and even a little dry. But good flavor.

I loved this recipe.  Quick and easy.  It's not as sweet as other cookie recipes but my toddler and hubby loved them. For my teenager, I just added a bit more sugar for the last batch.  I will make these again!

It was a good basic recipe for oatmeal cookies.  Something simple and quick.
