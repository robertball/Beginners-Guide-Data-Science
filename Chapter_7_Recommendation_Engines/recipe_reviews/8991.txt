The ingredients sounded strange, but it was really delicious.  I used regular mayo.  I served it with saffron rice, and some nan bread.

I really liked this dish, I'm a curry lover, so I used twice the amount called for, and it was wonderful.  The mayo makes the chicken very moist, even if it's overcooked, which I usually end up doing with chicken!  Definitely a keeper.

I didn't have curry , so I used garam masala, and the flavor was somewhat different. The mayonnaise made the meat very moist. We enjoyed it!

YUM, YUM, YUM.  I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  I only used the chicken and spices to marinate it (I also doubled the curry powder).  My whole family (including 3 picky boys) loved it.  Next time I think I will use more curry.

Flavorful & Moist!!! I marinated 24 hours. Due to the weather, I had to saute on the stove. The marinate did not look too appealing but the end result tasted very good!! I served with Angel Hair Broccolini.

This was easy and pretty good. I used whole chicken breasts instead of Kabobs. The flavor was not quite as strong as I hoped for. My kids loved it.

WOW!!! This is so good, I love this chicken. Like others suggested I doubled the curry.  Also I used miracle whip instead of mayo. I have made this 3 times, the first time on the grill, the second time in the oven, and then the third time I used chicken tenderloins and just grilled them.  I definiatly think the chix tenders over the fire is the best tasting and easier.  Add some zuchini strips, onion slices, bell peppers, whole mushrooms to the grill brushed with evoo and salt and pepper and wow what a meal! Thanks for a terrific recipe.

This was an absolute easy and delicious marinade on the fly for me! I let the meat marinade for a couple of hours and then skewered the meat. YUM! The sauce was a bit thick, so there was no need to discard the marinade, and I used chicken thigh meat. My guests commented how moist and tasty the meat was, and they weren't curry fans! I did double the curry as others mentioned, so I used 1 t. curry, and kept the other ingredients the same. Did 1/2 of the kabobs in the broiler and the other 1/2 on the charcoal grill. Both were excellent!

Incredible!  I doubled the curry powder as others had recommended.  It was perfect.  The chicken was so moist.  I also grilled some other veggies (tomatoes, zucchini, onion - along with the mushrooms) that I had marinated with another curry marinade that was meant for veggies.  Next time I think I will just double this marinade and put the veggies in along with the chicken.  So amazing - thanks for the great recipe!

Very good and so easy. I doubled the curry and it was not too strong. Using low fat mayo helps cut the fat here. I added green pepper to the skewers too. Thanks for sharing!

Moist and Delicious! Could not be easier! I doubled the curry and substituted 1/2 of the chili powder for cayenne to kick it up a notch! Made chicken strips and broiled them for about 5 minutes on each side...perfection!

I give this only 3 stars because as the flavors were very good, they were extremely subtle. I was expecting an explosion and I didn't even get a pop. That said, I did love the flavor I just need more, next time I'll up the spices considerably.

My family really enjoyed this twist on kabobs & curry... however, I have a hard time following a recipe.  I cut down on the low fat hellmans and added plain yogurt.  I (roughly) doubled the fresh garlic and ginger and added a little more than tsp of liquid honey to the marinade.  I then alternated red onion, chicken, mushrooms, chicken, zucchini, chicken & red pepper repeat until the skewer was full.  I then bbqed the skewers on low, brushing with the extra (set aside) marinade after they had been  on the grill & after I turned them about 5 mins in on both sides!  Like I said, I eyeball my ingredients and go on taste, so I had some extra that I set aside.  I  served over buttery rice it was delicious and my husband requests i make these kabobs again:-)

this was pretty good. marinated 2hrs and did the whole chicken breast rather than cubed pieces. i added some salt, too. decent, yet the bf who's indian said it didn't compare. for ppl like me who don't know the difference i think it's rather good. :D. oh and i did mine on the george foreman grill.

Chicken was very moist!  I doubled the curry & chili powder based on other reviews, but would add even more next time.  We will definitely make again!

Loved, loved, loved these savory & tasty kabobs!  The meat was nice and flavorful and so moist.  Like others I doubled the curry and added some hot curry to boot.  Only negative, a little messy getting these from the zip lock where they marinated onto the skewer.  It was well worth it, though.  I will use this for whole chicken breasts next time, and maybe have a little curry dipping sauce, too.  Thanks for a great tasting and very versitile recipe, Aurie.

I did not use this with Chicken.  I was stationed over in Germany for five years.  Where I was at there was a bratwurst stand that sold currywurst.  I remember them saying that currywurst was just a bratwurst marinade in a curry sauce.  So I tried this recipe and it works.  The taste is not as strong but it's very close.  I had to prick the casing so the seasoning can get to the meat.

These were tasty. A nice, light dish. We served them with grilled onions, and red & green bell peppers brushed with a mixture olive oil and minced garlic, and sprinkled with Garlic & Onion seasoning. It was a great combo.

3.5 Stars and I doubled all of the spices!  The curry could probably had been tripled.  We cooked them as tenders on a grill and the basic flavor was grilled chicken.  They were moist at 5 minutes per side, but def need more curry OR to be served with a strongly-flavored side dish.

This recipe is so delicious and was easy to make healthy enough to contribute to a contest at my local Curves where I workout.  I reduced the mayo to 1/3 cup, using low fat.  I substituted brown rice for the white, and it won 1st place in a Kabob Cook-off contest!  We're having it again tonight for supper.  Thanks saiahsmom.

My kids loved this recipe.  I used pork tenderloin instead of chicken and added a little more curry.  I thought it made plenty of marinade, so I didn't use all of it and brushed the extra on zucchini strips and grilled them too.

Excellent, I too doubled the curry and added a tsp of gram marsala... May add a bit more next time as I like a bolder curry flavor.  Couldn't taste the mayo at all, was great.

This recipe was fantastic!  Even my picky 9 year old and our 1 year old gobbled it up! I was only able to marinate the chicken for 2 hours and it still was sooo tender and moist, even though hubby charred it a little :)  I doubled the curry, and could have tripled it, the flavor was very mild.  Curry smells stronger than it tastes, so you can be more liberal with it than you think.  Will make this again and again!  Thank you!

I made this for my in-laws and kids and everyone loved it.  The only thing that I would add would be a tad bit of salt to the marinade, but other than that this is a recipe I will keep.

This was excellent!  I used hot madras curry powder and didn't have time to let it marinate for as long as the recipe called for, but it still came out delicious!  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good, but it would be better if the rice had some seasoning mixed into it. It definitely needed salt and pepper.

This was quite good.  I gave it four stars instead of five only because, as others have noted, the flavors are not particularly vibrant.  It was tasty and moist though. I’ve made it twice. In both cases I used a mix of mayo and yogurt and added salt. The second time I doubled all the spices (more than doubled the curry) and added a touch of cayenne and some garam masala.  I liked the second better.  Someone suggested adding lemon, and that might be nice.  Oh, and instead of kabobs I made chicken tenderloins and grilled the vegetables (mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, zucchini, and regular onions) separately in a grill wok.

Very tasty grilled chicken with this marinate. I doubled the amount of curry and it wasn't overwhelming. Simple recipe and the mayo was a good ingredient.

The only changes I made were I did not use mushrooms (didn't have) and used regular mayonnaise, not light, upped the spices to 1 teaspoonful each, sprinkled with salt and pepper. I let it marinade in fridge for 2 hours. Somehow I knew this marinade was not going to be good. I asked myself, where is the acidic component? How can this possibly season or tenderize the meat? I think my suspicion was right as the end result was very blah-tasting kabobs. I did not use a grill but instead put the chicken on skewers in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes. Perhaps charcoal grilling would have provided a depth of flavor that was sadly missing. I would not make this again.

This is a real keeper. I did double the curry powder and it was still mild. It was probably in the marinade for 3-4 hrs.  The chicken was wonderful. We tested it out before doing it for company. No worries.

Nice and simple and good!  I made them for Mother's Day and everyone liked them.  Next time I'll probably substitute olive oil and yogurt for the mayonnaise to make them healthier.

I made this curry chicken last night and was very disappointed. I even marinated it for longer than suggested so it could be more flavorful. It tasted nothing like Curry Chicken. The only good thing I can say is it was moist.

Delicious...moist and tender!!  Made them for 4th of July cookout. They were a hit with all ages. Next time think I'll experiment with upping the curry flavor, maybe add cumin and a little salt, but absolutely not necessary. (Would have taken pictures but they didn't stay on the platter long enough.)

This was so delicious.  I only did the chicken portion and marinaded according to the recipe, excluding the ginger since I didn't have any.  I cooked it on the George Foreman since is winter and freezing outside.

Disappointing.  Curry taste just didn't stand out.  Onions and tomatoes on rice seemed like a nice "twist" but was just ok.

This was really good! I used plain yogurt instead of mayo and doubled the curry powder. I cooked it on a grill (similar to a GF grill), not bbq and will make again for sure!

The entire family loved this chicken. I did double the curry, add a splash of lemon juice and my hand slipped a little when I did the chili pwdr, but it was so yummy!
