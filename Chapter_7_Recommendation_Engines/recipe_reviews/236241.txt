The football fans loved these.  I did an assortment of wings including traditional wings and these Korean Wings won hands down.  I did dust the wings with a flour / cornstarch / seasoning coating before frying.   This sauce is great!

Delicious! I prefer to bake the chicken wings, so I combined flour, paprika, garlic powder, black pepper in a plastic bag and coated the wings. Put them on a baking sheet with melted butter and oil - tossed. Baked at 425 for 30 minutes and then turned and cooked for 15 minutes. (They had a perfect crisp to them.) Then I dipped the wings in the savory sauce. Served with extra sauce on the side. They were gone FAST!

Wow, this is sooo good! The sauce is just great, I used the traditional Korean gochujang  fermented red pepper sauce  instead of the surachia .  Try it and you will find you start putting it  in and on everything! The other thing I changed was to bake the wings , I basted the sauce on them, baked for 15 min @ 375 pulled them out and basted top side, cooked 15 min and pulled wings out turned over and basted other side , for a total of 45 min cooking time in all. Beautiful moist ,mahogany wings that are finger licking good,

So good!  Husband also says "so yummy with amazing Korean zing! " (with sauce around his mouth as he says so) Easy!  Used korean kochichang instead of chili-garlic sauce to make it more Korean.  As someone else did, baked chicken (thighs as couldn't find wings) after marinating in ghee, lemon-pepper, black pepper, garlic powder and some penzey's northwoods fire seasoning.  Will take over to son at college for his birthday.  Will keep sauce separate in a sqeeze bottle and put baked chicken in separate containers to freeze and microwave.  Thank you for this recipe!

I absolutely loved this recipe! Instead of using chicken wings I grilled some chicken breasts, then sliced them up into cubes, coated them with the sauce then served it over jasmine rice, carrots and broccoli. This dish came out amazing. I do recommend really listening to the recipe when it comes to low sodium soy sauce. All I had in my pantry was regular soy sauce and after using that it was way to salty so I ended up having to add more sugar and BBQ sauce to offset some of that saltiness, after cooking it down an extra 5 minutes it was perfect! I will definitely be making this again!

We did not like the sauce. It was overpowering in sweetness and the soy sauce.

I make this sauce for my chicken every weekend and I love it! It's not spicy unless you add tons and tons of chili powder like me but I definitely end up licking my fingers everytime I eat these!

This is really good sauce, very tasty. I will admit I added more  hot chili sauce for a little more heat.

Great recipe! The only alteration was I added 2 tsp of honey. I was afraid it was going to be really spicey but in the end it was just a perfect amount of spice. Next time I’ll add a picture.

The men in my family gave it a....meh.  
I baked for an hour at 375C, basting as I went.  The chicken was fabulous, tender and moist, but there wasn't that Korean BBQ hit.

3.22.18  Used the air fryer for cooking the wings, and OMG, that sauce, just can’t say enough good things about it, except FABULOUS!!  Made the sauce in the morning, so this was a really easy dinner this evening cooking in the air fryer.   Bring out plenty of napkins because you’ll need them, but these wings were a total treat tonight.  Definitely will be making these wings again very soon.

I was looking for a new wing recipe and decided to try this one.  I followed the recipe exactly and found that the wings had some flavor, but were not at all spicy.  I am not sure if the title refers to the temperature or not, but don't count on a spicy wing for this recipe.

I experimented with several korean bbq sauce type recipes before we  tried this one and decided it was our favorite.  The ketchup and bbq tamed the intensity of the soy and created a more luscious texture.   I made the sauce according to the directions then we seasoned bone-in skinless chicken thighs with the lemon pepper before putting on the grill and then brushed with sauce as we flipped them.

These were SO GOOD!!!! I made them for my boyfriend and I on Valentine's Day and he LOVED them. I might cut back a little on the brown sugar next time for my personal taste. But other than that, this is my go to recipe for Asian-style wings! YUM!

I grilled my wings instead of frying but otherwise followed the recipe except for the lemon pepper which we tried and didn't like on them.  They are pretty good.  I made these and another batch with my regular Korean marinade and glaze which contains some of the same ingredients with gochujang paste.  The ones with the gochujang were hands down our favorites.  But this is a good recipe that I'll keep for the times when I run out of gochujang and need a Korean wing fix.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!
