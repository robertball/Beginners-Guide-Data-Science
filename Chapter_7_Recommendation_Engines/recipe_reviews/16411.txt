I love pasta salads and all the ingriedients in this salad are things I like,but I did not like it at all. It seemed like there was  too much cheese I would cube some mozzerella instead of the shredded. Also I thought there were too many eggs between the eggs and the cheese it was rather dry for my liking. I put in red bell pepper instead of green to brighten it up.

I've made this salad twice already since 
finding it a few weeks ago.

I recommend adding slightly more pepper
than is called for in the recipe, and
definitely adding the pepperoni, but 
this is a great-tasting salad that's 
easy to make!

We even liked it warm (un-chilled) when 
we were too hungry to wait!

THIS PASTA WAS GREAT. I PUT IN SOME PEPPERONI AND CHICKEN. I DID NOT USE THE EGGS THO. I DO NOT LIKE THEM IN MY PASTA SALAD. PLUS I ADDED A LITTLE BIT OF BBQ SAUCE TO GIVE A LITTLE EXTRA SOMETHING. EVERYONE LOVED IT.

I didn't like the eggs in this, I think it makes it too mooshy. I did like the dressing on it however. You almost need to double the dressing and reserve half for later. The pasta does absorb quite a bit. Hubby loved it. Thanks for the recipe.

When I made it I thought I might have ruined a whole bowl of good food because of the dressing, which smelled way too vinegar-y to me.  But after chilling in the fridge a few hours that totally dissipated and the finished product was great.

I have been making this pasta salad for at least 3 years now. It's always delicious and filling, my kids and husband love it! I will sometimes change the type of cheese I add based on what I have on hand, other than that I don't change anything. I usually add pepperoni, and sometimes grilled chicken breasts. I add 3/4 of the dressing and refrigerate, then add the last 1/4 of dressing before serving.

This is a very tasty pasta salad.  I had some provolone, salami and pepperoni that I wanted to use so I  added that along with the mozzarella.  I did use a little less mozzarella that requested  because I added the provolone.  It came out wonderfully, perfect for any cookout or gathering.

It was pretty dry.  Didn't mind the taste but it wasn't anything special.  I found myself adding more of the mayo mixture and finally threw the remaining servings of the salad away becuase no one wanted to eat it.  Won't be making it again.
