This was excellent. I only made 2 slight changes to the recipe: I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar (instead on 1 cup) and 2 tablespoons crushed pineapple and 2 tablespoons canola oil (instead of 1/4 cup of oil.) My husband will want this again (as will I.)

Very healthy, but not so tasty.  Mine was a little to gooey.
