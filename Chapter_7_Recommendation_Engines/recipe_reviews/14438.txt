If you use 1 cup of bulgar wheat, and 1 cup of boiling water, I've found you won't need to drain any excess water from the wheat.  All of the water will be soaked up by the wheat and be a wonderful consistency!

I would like to suggest some modifications to this recipe: instead of cucumbers u can chop lemon skin into very tiny cubes, add another cup of very finely chopped parsley,and u don't need to soak the borgol with boiling water just rinse them and soak them with the lemons that you're going to use in the dressing.Most important, garlic shouldn't be used.
Try with it on the side fresh cabbages or lettuce.
I'm lebanese and that's the lebanese way of preparing it.
Hope u like this recipe and Bon Appetit!!!

I have now made this recipe a few times to take to a braai (South African barbeque) and it always goes down very well and it goes very well with grilled meat.  I have made it with red and brown onion instead of the spring onion when I have been out of spring onion and I like the red onion best. I have also found that the olive oil should be reduced to 1/4 cup (for my tastes) and that the bulgar should be soaked in less water to save the mess of draining it - about 1 1/4 cups.  This also keeps it kinda crunchy and prevents it going soggy.  This salad must be well mixed again before serving as the dressing settles to the bottom.  All in all a great recipe.

Lastnight was Greek night at our house. How great that every recipe I wanted was on this site! This is particularly good Tabbouleh. I like your version, Katherine. The only thing I did differently was to cut the olive oil to 1/2c (only because everything else on the menu had Oil in it too), added some red onion for color, and added 3/4 cup more parsley. This was sooooo good! Thanks for sharing.Our Greek night was a success because of cooks like you! :0)

The only regrets my husband had about moving from downtown Chicago was that he would miss our butcher and our favorite Mediterranean restaurant for Tabbouleh.  Well I found a new butcher and now (thanks to Katherine), my search for great Tabbouleh is over!  In fact, My husband loves this so much, he ran out to buy me a Cuisinart Mini Prep to eliminate the chopping chore and ease his guilt over wanting double batches!

This was really good and healthy!  I soaked the wheat longer than 30 minutes and it soaked up all of the water and there was nothing to drain.

Very good recipe, although my husband (who loves tabbouleh) couldn't remember ever having any with bulgar in it.  At any rate, he said it was very good; I made Peppy's pitas from this site (excellent) along with Hummus III (the best!!) and this is what I did: I cut the pitas into triangles, lightly toasted them in the oven, and spread each piece ith a bit of hummus and topped with some tabbouleh.  Arrange on a platter and garnish with bits of parsley, red pepper, and green onions, and you've got a presentation worthy of any gourmet restaurant.  Wonderful recipe Katherine!

Made this for my husband's birthday (one of his favorite dishes - i just found out).  He loved it.  Likes to eat it with flat bread.  I also used less oil, 1/2 cup.

For a much healthier version, try using a scant 4 tablespoons of oil. It still tastes delicious and is quite a bit less oily. Also, let the bulgur sit for an hour with about 1 1/8 cup of hot water, it doesn't have to be boiling hot. The bulgur soaks up the water perfectly.

Delicious, refreshing and healthy salad. I think olive oil may be decreased to 1/2 cup. Otherwise, the recipe was perfect, and I did no change. Serves 4 to 6 people as a main dish.

My beautiful grandmother from Syria taught me how to make this wonderful cooling and refreshing, healthy cracked wheat salad - a little differently from how it is often prepared and served here in the USA where it is made too dry, not chopped fine enough. She would fine chop the scallions, parsley, mint, tomato and cucumber - more than shown in the photo above - no garlic. She used lots of fresh fragrant spearmint leaves from her garden and very juicy ripe red tomatoes, dunking the tomatoes quickly into a pot of boiling water, then peeling the skins off before fine-chopping them and reserving all the juice from the tomatoes to use in the Tabbouleh along with lots of fresh squeezed lemon juice. She peeled and then scraped the seeds from the cucumbers before fine-chopping them. Then, she stirred everything together adding a little olive oil, a splash of red wine vinegar, salt and pepper to taste (just a little). She covered and chilled the Tabbouleh in the fridge and at that time, she separated and rinsed a head of Romaine Lettuce, gentling rolling the wet leaves up in kitchen linen towels (or paper towels)to dry. Then, she placed a bowel of chilled Tabbouleh in the center of a plate with enough room to put all the Romaine Leaves around the bowl (like a big flower)showing everyone how to spoon the Tabbouleh into a Romaine leaf and eat it like a taco. Tabbouleh is often served with Shishkebobs and homemade Stuffed Grape Leaves, Homemade Yogurt, and warm buttered Pita Bread.

This is good, but this recipe calls for to much bulgur. Real tabbouleh has more parsley than bulgur.

I can't give this a better rating because while the mixture of ingredients is fine, the proportions are off as you'll see when you read many of the reviews.  First, you have to ask yourself if you like more parsley or more bulgur.  This recipe is heavy on the bulgur for my taste.  I'd suggest doubling the parsley, cutting the olive oil in half, cutting the parsley in half and substituting red onions for the green onion.  Also, grate some fresh lemon peel into the dressing.  As far as I'm concerned, the cucumbers are optional.  And most definitely, match the bulgur to water ratio 1:1 so you don't have to drain.  One other tip: when you wash your parsley, leave it on paper towels or use a salad spinner then let it set in a collander for several hours.  You really want to get the water out of your parsley before running it through the food processor.

My husband loved this. I thought the flavor was good,but it was too watery, maybe because of the cucumbers or the large amount of water used to hydrate the bulgur. Next time I'll try only 1 cucumber and less water.

I love tabbouleh, but I prefer a higher proportion  of grain to veggies than indicatd in this recipe. Also, I don't see the point of adding enough boiling water that you are required to squeeze out the excess. I use equal parts water to grain and it always turns out well. 1 1/2 cups bulgar to 1 1/2 cups water (plus a bit, if necessary) and up to 3/4 cups fresh, finely minced mint, seems to work for me. Also, I love chick peas, and often have chick peas - marinated in balsamic vinegar, olive oil and cumi - in my fridge. They make a great addition to this side dish. even if they may not be traditional. Only the chick peas, not the marinade, are sprinkled on the tabbouleh. And, if you don't mind me saying so, parsely is king, but don't make it overwhelming, as I find in some delicatessens. When buying bulgur consider looking for the rough cut variety - you will never go back! Such texture... Enjoy

It was a huge hit!
However, I did add about 3/4 cup more of the parsley to make the colors more pretty.  It tasted great, too!  Some resaurants' tabbouleh is mostly parsley.  I only added 1/4 C of of the olive oil.  It turned out very fresh tasting without it being overly oily.

My husband and I both really liked this.  It makes quite a bit but I think it was all gone within a couple of days.  I added 3/4 c parsley, as one of my fave trusted reviewers (Maggie) recommended, and I also put in about 1/2 c of crumbled feta, and some whole black olives.  It was really good.  Thank you, Katherine!  (May 2003)

I loved this! My pathetic embarrassment of a local grocery doesn't carry bulgur so I added a cup of barley just for a little something extra.  Passed the kid and husband taste test 100% so it's a definite keeper. Thanks!

I used to make this basic recipe when I was in college and I've been looking for it ever since.  I cut back the olive oil to 1/4 or 1/3 cup, otherwise this recipe is just awesome.  Use fresh lemons and let this salad set for 24 hours.  Be sure to mix before serving.

I have used this or similar recipe or years and sometimes I add different things - black olives, red and/or green pepper for color at Xmas time, celery, chopped water chestnuts, etc.  I also add a teaspoon or two of sugar or a packet of splenda - this takes away from a sour taste that some people don't care for.

Someone brought this to a cookout I went to recently, and I loved it. I'm glad I found this recipe. It's delicious. I left out the oil completely and it wasn't too dry at all. Thanks so much for sharing!

Wow, is this a great recipe!  Very refreshing and healthy.  I only used 1/2 cup very good olive oil just to be healthy, and made sure the water was out of the bulgar.  My husband and mother-in-law are Greek and they could not stop eating it.  Thanks!

Delicious!  I used couscous instead of bulgur, and did not use a full 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice.  I also used 1 medium white onion.  It had a very nice blend of the spice from the onion and lemon juice.  I have only "sampled" it before dinner, and am having a hard time staying away until it is served!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of cooking the bulgur according to package directions, which called for much less water and eliminated the squeezing step. I thought the finished salad was great, and the flavor was pretty close to what I get at the Lebanese deli near my house, except there was a little less parsley in this recipe. Overall, this is a keeper that I will make often during the summer when I can get abundant fresh herbs at the farmer's market. Update: this makes a huge recipe and is usually more than I can eat before it goes bad. Going to start halving it in the future.

This one just didn't do it for me.  It wasn't like the tabbouleh I've had and it also was way too minty for our tastes.  I made it exactly according to the recipe and ended up throwing pretty much the whole thing out.  It did look pretty, though!  I won't be making this one again.

Excellent recipe!  I also cut back a bit on the oil to keep it healthier, but not too much.  We loved the extra moisture that was there... perfect for dipping with some Naan bread!  Served it up the Hummus III recipe found on this site, plus feta chunks, olives and the Naan bread, and made for a fantastic Mediterranean feast.  Thanks!

Great recipe! I and my husband could eat it all day....the kids don't like it all that much even though they will pick out the veggies. I substitute dry mint leaves in place of fresh and it still tastes good.

Excellent recipe and a good way to use up some of those summer veggies and herbs.  The amount of oil can definitely be cut down without a loss of flavor.  I also found it to be a bit salty, so I cut back on the amount of salt as well.

This turned out very authentic. My boyfriend and I are big fans of tabbouleh (ok, we're a little obsessed with greek food in general...), and this was spot-on. Doubled the recipe, omitted the cucumbers (we've never encountered tabbouleh with cucumbers, and i'm greek) and added an additional bunch of parsley. It was actually much better the second day, too. It made a whole gallon ziploc bag's worth, so we ate it for a week. Definitely worth making again.

I can't believe the reviews for this recipe.  I realized most people are altering the recipe.  My rating is for the recipe AS IS.  

The reason I gave it two stars is because I like the ingredient list, however, the lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and garlic portion I think is way off.  Mine tasted like straight lemon juice and was extremely soggy.  

I had to drain the liquid and change the amounts of everything to make it some-what edible.  I will not make this again

Good recipe. Made it as directed first time and it was great. Left out garlic but added 4oz crumbled feta second time. Great to keep in the fridge to grab for a healthy bite any time. Family is loving it.

This was excellent. On a whim I substituted pearl barley (real stuff, not quick cooking) for the bulgur and it was great. Also added 4 oz of feta. This was delish and I will make again. Even the kids ate it.

I gave it 4 stars only because I've never had Tabbouleh so I'm not sure on exactly how it's supposed to taste.
This is absolutely amazing, I truly enjoyed this. As long as I have bulgur I will be making this, as I can eat this every day.
I do agree with another reviewer, 1 cup of bulgur to 1 cup of boiling water. I used 1 1/2 cups and it was a little to wet for me, and that was before I added the dressing.
All in all a great recipe

Loved it!  Per other reviews, I used less water to soak the bulgur- a little over 1 cup. Also, I used less oil and more lemon. I thought this recipe had too much bulgur.  Next time I will just increase the other ingredients to balance it out. This tastes even better the next day. Highly recommend!

Good base to start. I used 3c of parsley and 1/2 mint, I used 1 large seedless cucumber (so no need to throw any thing away, I used 4 Roma tomatoes (less to seed and nice and firm), 3 tbs minced garlic, sea salt, and reduced the olive oil to 3 tbsps. I used lemon to taste and found that if you find it to dry just add lemon no need to add all that fat. *I couldn't find any bulgar so I used Far East brands "Wheat Salad" mix no need to squeeze out water per their directions and it wasn't to wet.

Very good, but did make a few adjustments. Used couscous instead of bulgur and added garbanzo beans and balsamic vinegar. Even tastier the second day!

Thought this was very good, but definitely could have increased the amount of parsley and mint and decreased the amount of oil. I had already decreased the oil to 1/2 cup (as suggested by other reviewers) but found it to be too oily for my tastes still. I also decreased the amount of tomatoes and cucumber because there are several people in my house who don't really care for either, although I love them. Great basic recipe.

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this!  I was just looking for a healthy side dish to make for fathers day.  I thought this would be bland but it was very flavorful, and the combination of flavors is perfect, it is not too lemony or too garlicky.  I did reduce the olive oil to 1/2 cup and added a splash of red wine vinegar.  Other than that I followed exactly.  I was not sure how to squeeze out the bulgar so it came out a bit wet and there was a lot of liquid in the actual salad, but it didn't affect the taste.  Next time I will make sure to drain the ingredients better and pat dry the chopped tomatoes and cucumbers so it doesn't come out so wet.  Thanks for this recipe!

Terrific base! I add lots of fresh seeded/diced cucumbers and fresh radishes. Outstanding! I eat it with a little hummus and pitas or toss with left over heated rice and squeeze some extra lemon on it - Deelish!

This was a good salad, unfortunatly I could not find bulgar anywhere and subsituted couscous. It would be good with a spicy dish as it refreshes the palate.

This is a great recipe - the taste is exactly like our favorite Mediterranean grill.  I like to spread hummus on pita chips and then top with tabbouleh for a great, low-fat snack.  For this use, this recipe has way too much bulgur so I cut it down.  I used 1/4 c. and it was perfect.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was great, just like I remember from my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant!  I forgot to get green onion at the store, but white onions worked just fine.  I also added an extra 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to up the flavor factor.

This is a little hard to rate as I'm not a tabbouleh connoisseur.  I'd say though that you could reduce the amount of oil as it was pretty liquidy.

My grandchildren do not like anything new- but were willing to try this.  Made a delicious and easy side dish to go with the bar-b-qued chicken!

Good recipe - I use a lot more tomato, usually 5-6. Great summer recipe when tomatoes are beautifully ripe, and cukes are in abundance.
No garlic. Others have mentioned 1:1 ratio of Bulgar to boiling water and let it sit until cooled. That always works for me. Also let it sit at room temp for an hour or so.

Made it as directed except I used less water per other users recs. Tasted delicious. The mint added a refreshing flavor. Highly recommended recipe.

I substituted 2 chopped celery sticks in place of cucumber per husband's preference. I also added 4 oz of crumbled feta and served in pita halves. Great flavor.

I am Lebanese and have grown up with Tabbouleh.  I would modify this recipe as follows: Only 1/2 cup of bulgur wheat and rather than soak it, we rinse it until the water runs clear. Use 4 tomatoes, 1 cucumber, 1 green pepper, 1 bunch of green onions, 1 bunch of parsley, the mint (I only have dried mint), no garlic, only 1/2 cup of olive oil, juice from about 2-3 lemons, salt, pepper and allspice to taste.  Let sit for a few hours so that the bulgur softens and the seasonings blend.  We eat it on lettuce leaves.

Fantastic.  Tried it with and without garlic & preferred it with.  I reduced the oil to 1/4c.  and wouldn't have wanted more than that.  Other than that followed recipe pretty closely.  I boiled the lemon juice and oil with the water (which I reduced to 1 1/3c.), as I'd seen on a cooking show.

I agree with someone who says to not add garlic.  It's fresh and great without it.  Also, the salt is a little heavy for my taste.

There are a few things I would change.
I used 4 packs of parsley, chopped them
no mint
sweet onions and green onions
no garlic
no pepper
salt & olive oil (lots)
make sure to clean out the seeds of the cucumbers
good luck

I didn't have bulgur so I tossed in day old brown rice. I eyeballed the quantities but decreased olive oil to 2 tbsp and salt to 1/2 tsp. I can admit that I have never tried tabouleh from a restaurant, but this stuff is SO good. Something very refreshing about the mint, cucumber, parsley....umm, pretty much all the ingredients put together! Perfect side dish for people on the Wild Rose cleanse. Will definitely make  again.

Definitely heavy on the bulger and olive oil for me. I was hoping for something a bit more green than grain. Thankfully I decided to add the olive oil sparingly, half actually. 2/3 cup just seemed way excessive. I added only 1/3 cup and it still seemed like too heavy a texture. In the future I will probably try a higher ratio of veggies to grain and cut down on olive oil even more.

This was good, a little too much olive oil. I decreased the amount a bit. I just wanted to add as well, that Tabbouleh is not a "Greek dish", as I have seen several people mention in the reviews, it actually originates from Lebanon.

Good eating!  It is especially delicious as a sandwich.  I know, but I toasted a pita pocket in the toaster and piled in the Tabbouleh.  Yummy - cool and crisp and satsifying.

I uses more parsley, chives instead of onions (because I had it in the garden), a bit more mint, and about 1/4 c. more lemon juice.  It was fantastic and gone before we knew it!

Never put mint in this salad...it over powers the taste. Also eat it like a taco...take some washed romain lettuce leaves and put the tabbouleh down the centre.

Good!  As others recommended, I only used 1 cup of water with the bulgur and therefore did not have to squeeze out any moisture.  I also added one bouillon cube for a little extra flavour.  I halved the amount of oil and lemon juice called for.  It seemed like a lot of dressing as written and I am really glad I did.  I added 1/2 chopped jalapeno, some cumin and black pepper.  Next time I will add a dash of sumac as well.

I used to eat tabbouleh when I was little, but nobody saved the recipe. This tastes exactly like what I remember eating. I reduced the olive oil to half a cup, and there was still alot of the dressing at the bottom of the bowl, so next time I'll decrease the olive oil and lemon juice a little more.

used quinoa instead of bugler, added a little chopped red pepper for more color and cut back on olive oil.  Really good.  I added more cilantro and parsley since I really like that as well.

I took the advice of another reviewer and soaked in only 1 1/4 c of boiling water. It came out perfect and eliminated the need to drain. I also used a scant amount of oil to my taste. I prepare 1 vegan recipe every Sunday night to take for lunch throughout the week. I don't know if this one will last!

I made it GF by subbing the bulgur wheat with quinoa.  It made no difference in taste (from what I recall from my years of eating it w/ wheat).  I like mine with plenty of parsley - tastes so fresh.  I went without the garlic but did add the fresh mint - it you have it, you should add it as it does make a difference.

A very important fact is to make sure you only use the tips of the curly parsley and not the stems. I have been eating this since a child and my grandmother taught me to never use the stems.  They make the salad bitter.

I made this salad for a party and got several compliments for it. I used couscous (the large-grained Israeli type from Trader Joe's) instead of bulgur because I couldn't find bulgur. I prepared the couscous according to the directions on the package and didn't have any problems with it being too wet like some people did with bulgur. I did remove the seeds from both the tomatoes and the cucumbers, though, so that probably helped, too. I only used 1/2 cup of olive oil and I believe the salad would have still been good had I used even less. 
I agree with some of the other reviewers that the salad was a little bland at first. I ended up using more salt, parsley, and mint than the recipe called for, and I also added black pepper and a tiny bit of jalapeno - not enough to make it spicy but just enough to add some flavor. With these changes, I was really happy with the salad. Goes great with pita bread.

I have been craving this for a few years and after making whole wheat chapati's by COOKLOVE (of course from this site) I was bound to make tabbouleh. They were perfect together. I did decrease the amount of olive oil and increased the amount of lemon juice and parsley.

If we had to live on one food alone, Tabbouleh would be it, and this recipe would be our number one choice! I made it for dinner last night and my husband continuously remarked..."Honey there's nothing you make that isn't GREAT, but this is the best tabbouleh you've ever made! WOW!" I've made lots of tabbouleh, as it is our summer favorite. The bulghar wasn't soaking up the mint tea (I put the mint in the boiling water with the bulghar) as fast as it should, so I put it in the microwave for 3 minutes to speed it up a bit (hubby was on his way home for dinner.)Then I drained of the small bit of excess tea and put the olive oil and fresh lemon juice in, as well as the salt. I stirred it up and tasted it. I have to say, it was hard to wait for him to get home to eat! I added the cold veges and used cilantro instead of parsley and white onion instead of green (I've done this many times because that's what I had.) Oh! And I added 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic... all in all, a "to die for" tabbouleh! #1!

I used this recipe as a base and was glad about the warnings about the oil. I actually used more veggies than the recipe called for and used 2/3's of the oil. More than plenty. Things I changed: Used Whole Wheat cous cous in place of bulgar and added later after the rest of the mixture had been marinating for an hour to soak up the extra juices. I added a higher ratio of lemon for a brighter taste...lemon also cuts the "hotness" of any type of onion or garlic. Used a small shallot instead of garlic & green onion and added 3 large kale leaves chopped really fine to give this salad some sustenance. My family loved it! If you want to use kale, chop this ingredient and the shallots/onion or garlic first and let sit in the lemon. Raw kale is a hearty leaf and takes some time to soften; otherwise it can be a bit chewy. Great accompaniment to replace both veg and starch!

I used this recipe as a good starting point.  I used quinoa instead of bulgar wheat and I just threw the rest in by eyeing it.  Turned out wonderful and so fresh.

Loved the flavors! I chopped all the veggies together and did not drain off excess fluid, so the finished product was a little wetter than I had hoped, but overall, a very good dish!

I used basil instead of parsley,
garlick chives instead of scallons,
1/2 cup grapeseed oil instead of olive 
oil. Juice of 3 lemons and 1 lime.
About 1/2 tsp kosher salt. 
Use less oil and salt next time.
Came out pretty good.

I'm not a Tabbouleh expert, I'd never made this before, but I did not like it. It was way too lemony for me. Next time I would use half the lemon juice (or less), double the bulgur wheat, and use cilantro instead of parsley. Maybe even add some black beans. We had to eat this with tortilla chips, I can't imagine eating it plain.

Nice flavor, but there has to be a better way to prepare the bulgur.  "Drain and squeeze" still left it too wet, and who wants to squeeze bulgur anyway?

This is so delicious -- I made it twice in one week!  This will definitely be a regular salad in our house now.  It is easy to make and healthy.  (I did reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.)  Yummy!

I often make this in the summer and triple the recipe.  Then I have a HUGE bowl in the fridge and we often grab it for snacks, a side with dinner, and often all I'll have for lunch!  My 7 year old son loves it as much as my husband and I.

Except for all the chopping, this was very easy to make and it tasted good, too. I added red onion for a little more color and flavor. Try eating w/ Grilled Chicken, too!

Halved the salt, cukes, and garlic. Upped the parsley and tomato.  It's just like Mom made it so many years ago.

I doubled this recipe for a brunch at church and everybody ate and loved it! I didn't have time to add in the garlic and ran out of green onion,  but it still came out really good! Everybody exclaimed that it was very refreshing. Now I have to send some e-mails to share the recipe.

I used a small food processor to finely chop the mint and parsley, which saved a lot of time.  I used garlic scapes  instead of cloves.  Also, I wish I'd put in less lemon juice..a little too tart for my taste.

Good recipe but... 

A Lebanese grandmother across the street introduced me to middle eastern food when I was growing up. She'd only use  tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, parsley and mint that came fresh from her garden. Everything she made was amazingly delicious. I may be biased but I've always compared other dishes to hers.  

That being said, this recipe was good but a little too wet and had too much bulgar wheat for my tastes. Next time I'll cut the bulgar and olive oil in half.

I forgot to buy bulgur, so I substituted a box of garlic couscous. It came out perfectly and I've been eating it for days. I used less oil and didn't miss it at all. Highly recommend.

I found that one cup of bulgur is a bit too much for my tasting, also I like to let the lemon juice be soaked up by the bulgur so it tastes less watery. otherwise pretty good :)

Loved it. Made just as written. Ive cut it in half with great results. I don't like to eat leftover of this dish. the tomato and cucumber get soggy. I like this freshly made and refrigerated for an hour before serving. I've added crumbled feta and thats good too. Use less salt if you add feta

So wonderful! I've made it twice in the last couple weeks and it has been DEVOURED by my family both times. I added some crumbled feta to a couple bowls I had and would recommend. Also, kalamata olives are a great addition. Such a flexible, easy to make dish!

I make this all the time. I followed 2 other reviewers and only add 4 tablespoons of oil and the other tip is to let the 1 cup of bulgar soak up 1 cup of water. It is perfect that way.
I also use 1 teaspoon of sea salt. More is to salty for my taste.
I toss in garbanzo beans too.

I was looking for a way to use cucumbers from my garden (besides pickling) and stumbled across this recipe. I substituted quinoa for the bulgur that is called for and it turned out great! Saved this recipe for a lot of future use! Delicious!

This is a family favorite and a bit different from my usual recipe.
 I  substituted red onion for the green and  prefer the flavor. I  also found that the olive oil should be reduced to 1/4 cup as it was quite soggy.  Additionally, I also feel the water should be reduced as I have never had to put off excess and  also  it also keeps it  crunchy. Overall, it was really wet and the dressing pooled at the bottom.
My family also likes Kalamata olives in it which adds a nice flavor to it.

I didn't put as many tomatoes in it and added extra mint. That is just because  I didn't want the tomatoes to be too strong but wanted more mint flavor. I love mint.

The recipe is good overall, but 2/3 cup oil is insane! Next time I'll probably follow another reviewer's suggestion to use 4 tablespoons.

I love it!! I am looking forward to sharing with my family tomorrow evening (Christmas eve). Great recipe with just a few changes as per the advice of others. Cut the oil down to 1/2 the required amount, and only used 1 cup of boiling water on the bulgur which was perfect. Thanks so much for sharing:)

I added more parsley. Used couscous, as that's how I've always had it overseas. Decreased garlic to 2 small and used chives ( I have people that think they done like either). I just ate some before I let the flavors mix and chill. Think I'll add more parsley but this is what I do! Oh used grape tomatoes. Much easier to cut and no seed removal. Can't wait to eat more!  Hope my southern men will enjoy, I sure do!

I've used this recipe many times. We love it!  I use 1-1/2 cups of boiling water for the bulgar and let it soak for 1 hour. No need to drain. Thanks for a great recipe!

I cut the lemon in half, forgot the garlic, and used one long English cuke, double the green onion. I also added a big splash of red wine vinegar and feta cheese. I did soak the bulgur in 2 c of water, and after an hour all the water was absorbed and it was fine. Also, a large splash of olive oil was enough - 2/3 c. is way too much!!

I use chopped red onions instead of green, reduce boiling water to equal the amount of bulger, reduce olive oil to 1/4 cup, and use more parsley (Italian variety). Turns out wonderfully each time and has become a family favorite!

This was very good-very crunchy and refreshing.  I felt like it was missing something that I couldn't really put my finger on. I think I must have eaten it with tzatziki sauce in the past.  My husband loved it.

This was good but not sensational. If I were to make it again, I would add more parsley. I measured the parsley before chopping it, so perhaps that was the problem.

This was nice.  I'd prefer to give 3.5 stars as it wasn't quite a 4.  Something was a bit pungent and I can't quite place it.  Maybe too much garlic?  Maybe too much mint?  Not sure.  I reduced the oil to 1/2 C and would reduce even more, like down to 1/3 C. Definitely makes a lot.

Easy to make and very tasty!  The recipe makes A LOT, however, and if you're the only one eating it some may go to waste.

Love this recipe! I did make a few changes I used couscous, added black olives and feta cheese. Next time I'll use less salt.

This came out far too wet for me and the lemon taste was a bit overpowering, at least compared to other tabbouleh I have made.

I have made this dish since i was a little girl with my mom, we like to put chopped macadamia nuts on top. It matches with the flavors very nicely.

I didn't have mint or cucumbers, but I made up for them with extra tomatoes and parsley. It's delicious, and very healthy. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this pretty much as written except cut the olive oil back to about 1T. It was plenty. Very good light meal for summer time. I served this with some cold chicken and a slaw.

Great recipe...however I made a few changes.  I only used 1/2 c wheat bulgar and  used double the amount of parsley.  I highly recommend this recipes.
