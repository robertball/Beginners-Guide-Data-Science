I must say that I STRONGLY disagree with the first review. I made these cookies for a family get together and they loved them so much and my family is rather picky. I will definatly be making much more to take with me to the christmas get together.

Wow this was great! My whole family loved them. I am DEFINETELY making them again. Very good recipe. And concerning the first comment the user MUST have done something wrong because these tasted DELICIOUS!
