6.26.18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/238158/ultimate-gooey-blueberry-pie/ ... I reduced sugar by half & it was enough; not enough cornstarch though.  It was quite runny.  I, personally, didn't like the orange flavor as much as straight pie.  That egg white on top makes a pretty pie.  It browns it nicely.
