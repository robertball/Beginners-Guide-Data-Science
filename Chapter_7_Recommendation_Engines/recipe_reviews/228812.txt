Moist and delicious, easy to add or substitute ingredients like raisins and dried cranberries, even papaya or mango.  Versatile and delicious!

My sister-in-law gave me a huge ripe papaya so I googled a recipe using papaya and found this one.  This is an amazing meal-in-a-muffin!!  I fed it to my 3 grandchildren for lunch one day and smiled to myself that they were eating carrots, zucchini, papaya, whole wheat and oat bran!!  How nutritious can you get!  They are tasty but I felt they needed just a little meeting salt. This is going to be a favorite.

My son loves zucchini bread and carrot muffins so I thought this recipe would be perfect. However no one in my household liked it. They had a spongy consistency and were not sweet enough.

Delicious right out of oven with butter melting all over them. Still good when cool but need to be sweeter. I did add an additional tbsp honey but next time would add a little splenda. I like the texture which is not dry like regular muffins but dense, moist and a bit chewy. Would make again.
