This recipe is awsome!!  And frothy it is.  The only thing I did different was substitute the rum extract for the real thing, I put three Tablespoons in, and it was just enough, and it didnt overkill the recipe.  Great recipe..thanks!

This is a very good eggnog.  My kids love it.  I used pasturized egg substitute in place of the eggs and used Splenda in place of the sugar, using a 1/2 cup instead of the full amount of sugar.  It tastes rich and creamy and we don't have to worry about raw eggs!  YUMMY!

This is exceptional eggnog!  The only change I made was substituting real rum for the extract and increasing it to 1/4 cup.  We started with the tablespoon but felt it could use a little more rum flavor and it was easy to add the extra 1/4 cup after everything was complete, so if you're not sure how strong you want it (1/4 cup isn't very strong) you can always start small and increase later!

I loved this recipe. So much cheaper to make than to purchase pre-made eggnog! I made the recipe as stated, thought it was too thick with the whipped cream. Next time I added the heavy cream at the end but not whipped. Much better.

It was pretty good, but I though it was kind of bland. If I made it again, I would add more sugar.

this was delicious!! i made some slight alterations which made the recipe fatfree!!

I used fat free half and half instead of heavy cream, and since I didn't have nutmeg, i added cinnamon instead. I also left out the salt and rum flavor, and it still turned out delicious!!

Adding cinnamon creamer to it makes it even more sweeter, and still, fat free!! 

I recommend it@!!

A++++

I made this for a Cookie Party. I love cream so I used 7 cup Milk and 7 cup heavy cream and it was even better.

This is a wonderful recipe.  Once you have this basic technique down there are so many fun ways to adapt it to your own taste.  I made half a batch and now I wish I had made more.  My wife actually fell in love with me all over again when she tasted this.

This was AMAZING!!!!  Ours turned out just as thick & creamy as store bought egg nog.  Instead of waiting until just before serving to add the whipped cream, I added the whipped cream right away and let it sit overnight in the fridge.  The flavor and texture were both incredible.  Definitely adding this to our Christmas menu.

I made this for my boyfriend and his family and it was a huge hit! The only subsitution I made was to switch the eggs out for eggbeaters and it tured out fantastic. It wasn't too thick and it tasted just right. Thank you!

I absolutely loved this.  We didn't have the rum flavoring, so I added a bit more vanilla.  My boyfriend said it's a bit more runny than store bought eggnog, but he's happier with that.  I think it's creamier, which is why I'm happy.

Delicious! It reminds me of when my late mother used to make it. I made it without the rum extract be cause I don't have any and it's very good all the same. I will have to try it with the rum. Thank you so much for posting your recipe.

Really good and not as thick as the store bought stuff, I did not make it "frothy" though, I thought that since I used whole raw milk it would be rich enough without the whipped cream, I did add the nutmeg to the mix instead of as a garnish.

I made the same changes as other reviewers, cream in the nog and some real rum. I liked not having to cook it. Have my own farm fresh eggs that I trust more than store bought eggs. I will certainly make thus again!

Just made it right now for thanksgiving and I think it's really good, I have allergies to regular milk so I used goat milk, I am going to let it chill more in the fridge before serving but it's nice to have eggnog that won't make me sick. Thanks for the recipe it's yummy!
