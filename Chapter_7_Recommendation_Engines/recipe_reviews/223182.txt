Love the idea, but even with reducing the honey by 1/3 cup, these are far too sweet. Next time I will use 1/2 cup at most. I used dried blueberries and peanuts instead of almonds, and I did not use the cinnamon. I also added cacao nibs...wish I had added more as they would help with sweetness. I will definitely make them again with some modifications, and this recipe has many possibilities!

These were great as is.  They didn't last long in my house!  I did reduce honey a bit to suit my taste.  Great base recipe with so many possibilities!
