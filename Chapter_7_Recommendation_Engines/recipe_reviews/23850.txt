This is a winner! The sauce is so velvety and delicious. I added a clove of garlic to the mushroom mixture because we love garlic. Also, I used only one skillet for everything. Brown the chicken,remove it; add the mushrooms,  seasonings and wine & reduce it. Then add soup mixture to same skillet. Pour over the chicken and bake. Then you have only one skillet to wash! This recipe is a MUST TRY! You won't be disappointed!!! For the reviewers who thought it was bland, just add more rosemary, thyme & garlic.

This was a good recipe.  This was the first time I made it and I wanted to share some things I did to cut down on the fat and calories.  I used half the amount of butter, reduced fat soups, and fat free half and half (instead of the heavy cream).  My husband and I thought it was very tasty!

My family really enjoyed this. Think this is an adult dish. Really tasted great on a cold fall night. Served it with broccoli and french bread. 
Made ahead in morning and popped it in the oven for 45min. at 300. Served over noodles as suggested.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for over 5 years.  I do not put in the herbs, and I place my meat & sauce atop white rice rather than pasta (it's less messy and the rice absorbs the moisture and flavor so well).  Everyone I've ever shared it with has said that it's simply "TO DIE FOR"!!!

This is a wonderful recipe!!  I'm definitely not a cook and even I pulled this one off.  The chicken was moist and delicious.  I didn't have any rosemary or thyme to use, but it still came out delicious.  My boyfriend even said it was gourmet restaurant quality.  I will definitely be making this dish over and over again.  Thanks Danielle!

We loved it - sauce like velvet.  One serving very satisfying.  Used cream sherry instead of marsala.

I loved this and so did my family, but instead of using the chicken drippings, I used the mushroom pan for the sauce ,1/2 cup chick broth, and didnt have marsala so I subbed with white wine. I served over x-tra wide egg noodles, so yummy. Cant wait for leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

A classic in my book...I've made it several times and its always great.  Don't substitute milk for cream though, it's just not the same!  And using cream of chicken soup "with herbs" added a nice touch.

We did like this recipe.  I dont know if I cared for this recipe over linguine since it was more like a gravy type sauce.  If it was over any noodles, I would do egg noodles.  But I think I would prefer this paired with rice and mashed potatoes.  The sauce would be excellent for mashed taters!  I did add in some sauteed garlic and extra seasonings.  I did not use two separate skillets like the recipe suggests.  I dont think it is needed.  I also added in all the marsala wine at once to reduce down before adding the soups.  This way you reduce all the alcohol out and arent left with a nasty alcohol flavored sauce from more alcohol being added in before baking.  I went ahead and after all the sauce was made up, baked it like suggested. I think adding the chicken back into the skillet and covering it on low would come out just as good and save an extra dish to clean!  Thats always a plus for me to save on dishes :D !  Thanks for the recipe!  I will make again, only serving it with potatoes and rice next time!

I rated this a 4 just because the steps involved are way too many.  I used one pan to make the chicken and sauce to serve over the pasta.  I didn't use heavy cream (none in the house) so just added more Marsala wine.  I also used cream of celery rather than cream of chicken.  I had cooked chicken on hand so used that.  Very tasty served with a garnish of green olives.

I usually have a problem overcooking chicken, due to when I was a child I had Salmonella.  But..let me tell you..this chicken came out MOIST as anything!  I could not believe it!  I didn't have Marsala wine, so I used white wine instead, and even my husband (who was born and raised in the south, and only likes chicken fried), devoured it!  My 4 year old absolutely loved it!  I served it over linguine, and used a french baugette to sop up all the savory "gravy".  This is a definate keeper.  Thanks so much! :D

Loved this recipe!  The only change I made was to add garlic because we are garlic lovers in our house.  I have 4 kids 5 and under and they all loved this!  A keeper for sure!

I have four really picky eaters to feed (my husband and three sons) and they absolutely loved this one (my oldest even asked me to put this in his lunch tomorrow)! I omitted the mushrooms as I am allergic, used sherry since I didn't have marsala on hand and added garlic. Leaving out the mushrooms cut the prep time to about 10 minutes. I will make this again soon and use the marsala, which I think we will like better.

Super Good!  All the kids even liked it, which is quite unusual.  But its not what I'd call "kid food" so its perfect!  I used twice the mushrooms and I liked it better.  I also like it better on baked potatoes than with linguini, just our preference.

This one is a winner. I buy boneless breasts in bulk and butterfly them so that they're thin...so I cut the frying time to 2 or 3 minutes each side, and the baking time to 30 minutes. I used less cream and more wine to lose some of the heavy creamy-soup flavor. Even with thin cutlets, the chicken was moist and the sauce was delicious. Served it over egg noodles...this one's a keeper.

Everyone really liked this! I used "chicken tenders" (pre-sliced chicken breasts) and it turned out great. I thought it was obvious that I used condensed soup, but everyone really loved it, so I guess it didn't matter! Thanks! I'm sure I will make this again!

This was easy to make, and delicious! I used the Homemade Cream of Chicken soup recipe on here for that portion. Didn't have thyme, but this was great! Will make again, for sure!

This was delicious.  I cooked everything in one pan, as well as added garlic and onion before I popped it in the oven.  I used half the amount of butter, then sauteed the mushrooms, garlic, and onions in some flavored olive oil.  Also, half and half works just fine.  The linguine pasta holds the sauce really well, it's perfect.

This was easy and made alot of sauce to bathe noodles in, but it was just ok. The sauce turned out thick and creamy but the Marsala flavor was a little overwhelming. I actually had a can of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken in my cabinet that I was trying to use up, so that was my main reason for trying this recipe. I would not go out of my way to make it again though.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend tonight, and we both really loved it. The recipe was easy to make, and of course, I added a few extra ingredients: 3/4 cups of frozen chopped spinach (thawed and drained) and about 1/2 cup chopped sweet yellow onion. I added the onion with the mushroom mixture to cook through, then added the spinach. I also used half 'n half instead of the heavy cream. I'll make this one again for sure since it turned out great!

I love this recipe! I made it the first time with fat free soups and only 2 tbls of butter to saute the mushrooms; still overly concerned about fat and calories, the second time I substituted fat free half and half and added a bit more marsala. Still came out delicious!

The fussy husband was pleased again!!! I loved this recipe - hardly changed a thing (omitted the wine because I didn'thave any on hand) and I served it over a bed of white rice.  I will definitely try it with the pasta next time because there was so much of that delicious sauce left over!! A definite hit in my house!

My husband who is not the usual cook in the house, suprised me with this delicious meal one evening after work. The aroma of this dish is only to be matched by the delightfully sinful taste. He did supstitute dried herbs for the fresh ones and the result was still wonderful. I definately suggest a French or Italian bread for dipping.

Not sure what I think of this - I made it as is except the button mushrooms (my grocery was out) and it was good, but something tasted off.  I haven't decided yet what to do differently next time.  I do intend to make it again, but something needs to be adjusted a tiny little but.  Consistency was great, very tender....

I read a few reviews stating that it was too sweet. USE DRY MARSALA...marsala comes in either dry or sweet. Use DRY! It will be fantastic and not too sweet!

Good recipe and easy to do. In all honesty, we only did this one because my DD name is Danielle. However, it was good and will do it again. I added a touch of EVOO and garlic/cheese to the linguine before tossing it with the chicken.

After reading all of the fantastic reviews I thought how could I possibly go wrong with this recipe!  I noted a few negative reviews, but disregarded them.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with those reviews.  The preparation time was very lengthy and the meal was barely edible.  I have to assume that this was because I didn't like the overpowering sweetness of the Marsala (even though I added 1/4 cup less than recommended).  Obviously, the flavour is for some and not for others.  If you're not a fan of sweet flavourings in savoury meals than avoid this one.

P.S.  Sorry Danielle :-(

I really liked this.  The trouble I had was the cooking time.  I also added some garlic while cooking because some of the other reviews said it was a bit bland.  I thought the end result turned out really well.  Thank you for the post.

To die for!!  I made mine lowfat by using only 1 Tbl. butter with the chicken, 1 Tbl. butter with the mushrooms, fat-free half and half instead of heavy cream, and 98% fat-free soups.  I read other reviews that mentioned the curdling, but I didn't have that problem.  I stirred the cream in the soups in a separate bowl before adding to the skillet.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great dish; the chicken was nice and moist. I substituted a few things to reduce the salt and fat: one can of cream of chicken soup, one can lo-salt chicken broth, and no cream. I kept the spices the same, and also did the one pot stovetop method. Served it over mashed potatoes... the gravy was so good!! Next time I'll have to make a bigger batch!

Wow...this was so good and simple to make! I used canned mushrooms (16 oz can) and it still turned out great! The sauce is extra yummy and we served it over angel hair pasta. A good recipe to try even if you are just a beginner cook! Thanks so much Danielle, we'll definately use this recipe often!!

I cooked this for the very first time, using corkscrew noodles instead of the linguini. It was a hit! I didn't use any of the wine, so that made the gravy a bit too thick and not enough to go around.Overall, I review this as a GREAT RECIPIE!

I really enjoyed this dish! So did da hubs who is normally a very picky eater and don't like mushrooms. The only thing he had a problem with was the chicken. He said it was a little bland but everything was great to me.

I LOVED this! We are eating a lot healthier now a days though so I changed it a bit. I made my own Cream of Chicken Soup and Cream of Mushroom Soup. I used Fat Free Heavy cream. Also I used all lowfat ing to make the cream soups. I used Best Life butter for the 8tbsp. Also Whole Wheat pasta. All in all this was awesome!

The sauce was good even though I did some tweeking (no mushrooms and instead of sherry i used white wine). The chicken turned out tough I will not cook on the pan the next time or next time i will only cook for 2 minutes instead of 4 minutes. Served with egg noodles. My ten year old loved it my husband loved it also except for the tough chicken.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I did cook mushrooms and soup in same pan... browned chicken in olive oil.   Also,  added more Marsala wine and more of the spices.    Brushed italian bread with olive oil and added chopped rosemary and thyme to complete the meal!!!  Turned out great!!!

This went over really well at my house.  I agree with reviewer Robin, there is no need to use more than one skillet.  Just remove the chicken to the 9 x 13 pan and continue on with the remaining ingredients in the same pan.  I rarely use heavy cream but happened to have some on hand so used 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/4 cup lowfat milk.  I think you could even sub all lowfat milk and get a good result (or maybe a combination of lowfat milk and light sour cream).  I served over sphagetti noodles.  Added garlic with the mushrooms.  Also used olive oil in place of some of the butter.  Thanks!

Very good, and we liked how the marsala wine aded a very nice flavor, (I also thought it helped to cover up the canned soup taste, I was leary about making this, as I try to avoid the cream of "whatever" soup gravy that is used all to often in recipes!) But the wine helped!  I thought the sauce could have been a bit thicker, but overall was very good and I will probably make it again, maybe only using one can of soup and maybe thickening it with a bit of flour instead, it did make A LOT of sauce.

We liked this a lot. I decided to do everything on the stovetop and didn't bother with putting anything in the oven. Also served as it was with no noodles. We thought it was good. I did add some more marsala and used only skim milk as I was out of heavy cream.

Yum! I picked out the recipe and dear hubby prepared this for us. He subbed Italian seasonings for the rosemary and thyme (he refuses to cook with rosemary since that is his ex-wife's name - lol) and subbed egg noodles in. We don't care for mushrooms so we omitted. This is DELICIOUS!

Great recipe! To cut down on fat, I sauteed chicken in 1tbsp butter & 1tbsp olive oil. I used 3 chicken breasts & cut into finger size strips. I deleted the salt as the soups are salty enough. After chicken had browned & removed from pan, I added 1/2C chopped chives to remaining oil & sauteed for approx. 2 mins. I added all the Marsala at this point to deglaze the pan. I then added soups, spices and chicken back into pan, covered, then cooked on low for approx. 20 minutes. I saw no need to transfer to the oven. When the chicken was done, I removed & set aside. To the sauce I turned the heat up to Med. High, then added 1/2C Fat Free 1/2 & 1/2 (yes, there is such a thing!) &  let boil down just enough to coat the back of a spoon. I served this with Rotini pasta so it could hold all the yummy sauce. My husband liked this as did all 3 kids, 10, 8 and 5. Will make again!

I made this dish last weekend and it was EXCELLENT.  I did use more mushrooms and next time will use more chicken breasts as there is definitely enough sauce.  This is a keeper!

Tasted great.  My husband liked this better than the chicken marsala recipe from this site. I made this with 4 chicken breast halves.  It was very saucy so you could really make about 6-8 chicken breast halves.  Next time, I will probably try 1/2 and 1/2 to cut down on fat content and try olive oil to brown the breasts instead of butter.  Great with linguine, but would also be great with rice or mashed potatoes as well.

I love chicken but thought this was okay, however, the rest of my family did not like this.  My husband is not a big chicken fan and said the sauce just tasted too much like chicken.  Everything tasted like chicken. I actually got a tummy ache after eating. Unfortunately, we will not be making this again.

I'm not a huge pasta fan, however my family enjoys it occasionally. The chicken was so moist and tender, and the sauce was to die for.I ate mine without the pasta and was able to savor the wonderful flavors. I added about 4T minced green onion and 2t garlic powder for extra flavor. This is a definite keeper. Thanks Danielle.

This recipe was easy though it took a while to make, but it was definately worth it.  My husband raved about it. We didnt have any linguini, so I used angel hair pasta and it was great.

Very nice recipe, I liked the creaminess of the recipe versus a more traditional marsala chicken.  Sauce clung to noodles much better.  Great company dish.

Just made this tonight, amazing!  I took notes from some of the other reviews. Added a little extra Rosemary to it, I did add the garlic as suggested and made it all in ONE pan! I also added two teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce... This dish is DELICIOUS!! The whole family loved it and we will make again for sure, thanks for sharing!

Besides omitting the button mushrooms (just didn't have any) this recipe came out very well. Was very rich, a bit too rich for an every night dinner. The button mushrooms might have cut that richness just a bit. All of the family liked it (I have mid-older teens).

Fantastic! Only used 6 tbsp butter but think I will cut it down to 4 next time. Used one pan cooking the chicken first then the mushrooms added about 2 cloves of garlic with them, then added the soups and cream. Will definitely be making again and soon

This is very tasty, I only gave it 4 stars b/c I made it all on top of the stove - removing the chicken (I used tenderloins, sliced) after it was browned and then adding the rest, then adding the chicken back in and letting it simmer for a while and it was very tasty. I bet it is even better in the oven as written, when I have more time I'll try it that way!

I agree with one of the other reviewers, I'm surprised this doesn't have more reviews. I also found this recipe several years ago and it has now become our Christmas Dinner tradition. Because of the size of our family and the open house atmosphere at Christmas we make a big pot of pasta and several sauces for the top. This recipe is always there and always goes fast. I've also made it and then put it in the crockpot and taken it to work for a potluck; it was a success there too. Don't change the recipe and you will be very happy!

Maybe closer to 4 1/2 stars. The chicken stayed moist, but it did taste a little on the canned soup side.

This recipe wasn't very good.  It tasted like canned soup, chicken, and noodles.  It makes a lot of sauce and no one was remotely interested in the left-overs.  My boyfriend likened it to cafeteria food.  I definitely will not make this again.

This recipe is NOT worth the time it takes to prepare, the price of the chicken or the fat content. It tastes like canned soup over noodles!  Yuck.  My husband said, "don't make this again."

This was one of the best of the many wonderful recipes I've tried from this site.  The chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful and the sauce was absolutely delicious.  This is one of those rare dinners that my husband and kids all really enjoyed.  Would also be a great dish for company.   Will be making this one often.  Thanks for sharing Danielle!

Really good, the marsala added a lovely sweetness.  I used only cream of mushroom soup as I didn't have cream of chicken.

Absolutely delicious; this recipe is destined for the Hall of Fame!  A couple of people have used the word "velvety" to describe the sauce and that is exactly what it is.  I didn't have any Marsala wine so we used dry white wine and it still tasted heavenly. I seasoned up the chicken breasts well before cooking to add some flavor and added garlic powder and Tony Chachere's to the mushrooms.  Finally, I use cream of chicken with herbs and cream of mushroom with roasted garlic  soups for more flavor.  I used to make this with heavy cream and then went down to half and half and I am now down to fat free half and half and it still tastes fantastic.  Defiantely one of my favorite recipes from this site!

This recipe was delicious!!! I was so sick of fried chicken or grilled chicken and was really looking for something different. I did alter it a little - used olive oil instead of butter, 1/2 cup 2% milk instead of cream, and used 1 cup of wine instead of 3/4 cup.  I used cream of mushroom with garlic soup and cream of chicken with mushrooms (or something like that).  I seasoned my mushrooms with garlic salt while they were cooking to add more flavor. I also used one skillet...when the chicken was done, I put it in the baking dish and I did the mushrooms and then added the wine, soup and milk and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. We had garlic breadsticks as well! Definitely will be doing this again! Thanks Danielle.

This was OK, but there was something missing.  I added some crushed garlic to the chicken while it sauteed but it still turned out rather bland.  I probably won't make it again.

This meal was very good. I did use fat-free half and half and 98% fat free soups to cut down on the fat. Next time I will cut down on the butter and add some garlic. Thanks for the recipe. It is a keeper.

This is such an easy recipe but it tastes like you put much more work into it!  I am a rice lover so have tried this over rice and noodles and both is very enjoyable.  THANKS for sharing this!!!

This is one of my prized receipes.  The first time I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.  The chicken was so moist and tender it just melts in your mouth. I used lots of dry herbs (out of fresh) and it was very flavorful.  Used 1/2 cup extra marsala wine. Served with angel hair pasta and asparagus. Perfect 10!

very good.  I used low fat condensed soups and cut the butter and cream amounts about in half.  The wine gives it a very nice flavor.  Thanks!

Oh my!!!  This was sooo good.  The kids didn't care for the rosemary so will leave out next time.  I will also add more mushrooms. I am tempted to use this for a pot pie filling adding vegies.  I'll let you know how that turns out.  This heated up great too.

Absolutely wonderful recipe -- my husband went nuts for it!  This is definitely a keeper!  I do cut down on the butter (by about half), and I typically add more mushrooms.  I've served this several times for company, and it's always a hit.

Easy and good!  Only four stars because I made changes, as the recipe would have been to "Campbell's Soupy-tasting" for me.  So I cut the soup in half and added cream cheese.  Then, i skipped the heavy cream altogether.  This made for a very smooth cream sauce.   I also used Chardonnay, as I prefer white wine with my chicken dishes. Will make extra sauce next time.  Served over wild rice.  Yum!

I made this tonight and it was fantastic! It was sooooo easy! I didn't spend a lot of time separating the ingredients out per the instructions. I lightly browned the chicken and in the next skilled sauteed the mushrooms and then just added in the spices and soups to this pan after the mushrooms cooked, stirred it all together, put the chicken in the casserole dish and poured this over the top. Baked it for the recommended time and it was perfect! My husband loved it too! It is a very satisfying dish and has such nice light flavors. Thank you!!

Tried this recipe tonight, we used only 2 cloves of garlic, 1 tsp of rosemary and followed the recipe as stated. 
We used white wine also, this turned out quite good but next time I will add more garlic, rosemary and thyme.
I also found this a little time consuming taking 2  hours from start to end of eating. I will definitely make again when I have time to spend in the kitchen, thanks for sharing.

After reading the other ratings, I was really disapointed with this recipe.  My husband and I didn't like it at all.  After spending so much time in the kitchen to make this, we ended up not even eating it.  The sauce was too strong and very salty.  I think I will stick with a basic chicken marsala recipe next time.

I made this for out-of-town company and they thought it was amazing.  My husband and I liked it too - very rich and filling.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because I feel it's a little more time-consuming than other similar chicken marsala recipes.  It's worth the effort occasionally though.

Nice change for me. It still had the Marsala taste but creamier. I thought it turned out great. I made this recipe almost as written. I just added garlic powder when seasoning. Thanks, Danielle!

Very Very Good!  This compares to any chicken marsala recipe out there.  Although 10 times easier!  I like to add more rosemary, thyme, and marsala.

This is a very good and easy chicken dish to make.  The kids liked it too!  I used 5 of the thin sliced breasts from Foster Farms and there was way too much sauce.  I did cut the Marsala wine down by 1/4 cup as some reviewers said and the sauce was the perfect consistency.  Next time I think I will use 1 can of soup (I used a combo of Cream of Chicken and Cream of Mushroom by Campbells - I have never seen the two mixed together)and cut down a bit on the heavy cream.  I wasted alot of the sauce that just went down the drain.  Will definitely make this dish again.

I must say that I'm surprised this recipe doesn't have more reviews.  I found it on here back in 2002 and have been making it ever since.  This is a big kid-pleasing recipe.  All of my picky eaters ask for it, and my husband LOVES it.  I don't really understand the "soup over noodles" comments - maybe they omitted an ingredient or skipped a step.  I love this recipe and will continue making it!  YUM!

A great recipe! My husband said it was restaurant quality. Didn't have Marsala so I used a Cabernet. I love buying the single serving four-pack of wine for cooking and one bottle is perfect for this recipe. My family asked me to log this under Family Favorites.  I used a Chicken Montreal Seasoning blend and it gave it a nice flavor.  This is definitely a keeper!

I'd had this at a restaurant... and then they quit serving it :(  When I decided to find a recipe to make it myself, I was so lucky to have tried this one first.  OMG!  It's so great and so versatile (I made with 2 cans sliced mushrooms, drained and white wine the first time b/c that's all I had and it was still awesome).  Great with Garlic Green Beans

So good. Deffinetly worth the time to prepare. I substitute the wine for chicken broth though and if I don;t want to wait all the time to bake it I cut the chicken breasts into smaller pieces and add them to the sauce which i just simmer on the stove, always a hit at my house.

This was SOOO awesome!!  I sprinkled the chicken with garlic salt before cooking, and added a bit more of each of the seasonings.  Served with homemade sweet white bread, broccoli and salad for Father's Day.  I love the taste of the Marsala, and the sauce was so velvety and smooth.  Thanks!!

I made Chicken Danielle for supper tonight.  The only two sounds I heard were chewing and WOW!  Any meal that makes my family say WOW! is a definite 5 star keeper!  Instead of pasta I served it over Stove Top stuffing,which was very good.  Next time they want to try the pasta.  The chicken was extremely moist and tender.  THank you, Thank you, Thank you!!

This turned out too soupy, it took too long to make, and I thought the marsala wine was too strong.  I won't make it again.

a little bland for my taste.  i agree with the other posters that said it tastes like canned soup poured over noodles.  i thought the wine would give it more flavor than it did.

This just wasn't really for us. Chicken came out a little bit over cooked and as far as the sauce goes, well, personally I thought it tasted too much like canned soup. This also would have been much better served with egg noodles. Lessen cook time and add some sauted onion and garlic. Serve with buttered egg noodles and fresh steamed veggie. Kids enjoyed it.

We thought this was just OK.  If I make this again I will use 1/4 cup wine, 1/2 cup chicken broth, 2% milk instead of cream, add garlic, and Cavender's Greek Seasoning.

I sauteed my chicken in minced garlic, used only cream of chicken (as I halved the recipe) and subbed sour cream for the heavy cream.  It came out great!  Very nice flavor and plenty of sauce.  I served this over rice instead of pasta.  Even the (hard to please) boyfriend liked it.  I will definitely make this again.

We found this to be okay.  The baking time is a little broad.  I ended up baking for 40 minutes because the organic chicken breasts I had were on the plump side.  Even though I only sauteed these for 2 minutes per side, they still were overdone.  I did use an 8 oz package of fresh mushrooms instead of canned and dried herbs.  Also, I think the sauce (which I used a very good marsala) had a distinctly "canned soup flavor".  For the soup I used Campbells Cream of Mushroom and Cream of Chicken Reduced Fat (not reduced sodium).

This was pretty good, although I feel certain that if I stuck to the original recipe, I would probably be rating this recipe higher. I used cream of mushroom and cream of celery soup, canned mushrooms, and dried herbs rather than fresh, and the result was a moist, if somewhat bland chicken. I look forward to making this again with the right ingredients.

Perfectly edible, but I'd have to agree with the reviewer that said it was a bit bland. It did make plenty of sauce (always a plus around here) and it was very easy.

My husband and I really liked this. Since I am pregnant, we didn't add the wine at all. We also left out the rosemary and thyme (I'm not a big fan of either). It was excellent....When we were making it we both said sarcastically, "there really isn't much fat in this dish!!" We will make again.

I followed the recipe as far as ingredients are concerned.  I browned the chicken for 5 minutes on each side.  Then I put in on a plate while I combined the rest of the ingredients in the pan.  I returned the chicken to the pan and cooked it on the stove for minutes on low.  It was very tender.   I'll make this again.

It was my second go at this one. It turned out better than first and first went over really good ! Always cut back on butter portions and augment with olive oil. Added garlic as suggested by others. Pretty much doubled the mushroom component because we love them. Only used cream of mushroom soup. Substituted heavy cream (because its not good for you :) with 3.25 milk and a wee bit of corn starch. MIxed pastas as we didn't have enough of one kind. Used a salad type bowl so you can't see the pasta but it was there. My wife added chili flakes because she likes spice. So all in all it is now one of our favourite chicken dishes and while it is a bit labour intensive, it isn't hard so I will consider making it when we have dinner guests.

I added a little minced garlic while sautéing the mushrooms, and used one pan... other than that, I followed the recipe and it was excellent!  Easy to make, rich creamy sauce.  My teenagers loved it!  I will definitely be making this again soon.

Hubby loved it and so did I! I did cut the chicken breasts horizontally because he doesn't like big pieces of chicken,  and used more mushrooms than called for because we love them. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I would add more chicken for the amount of sauce.
And only make as much linguine as you will eat, too much is a waste. 
I added chopped garlic to mushroom mix.
It came out very well. Will be adding it to cooking book.

I forgot to add to my original review that I felt the herb measurements looked more like for dried herbs. So using the standard conversion  I tripled the herbs. Then I felt it was a little heavy on the rosemary,  so I added about another teaspoon of thyme.

I don't understand how anyone can give 4 and 5 stars to a recipe that utilizes canned soup.  I made this because I had all the ingredients on hand (including the soup), I did cut way down on the marsala, it's flavor is way too distinctive for 3/4 of a cup, I used about 4 TBS. The rest of the family liked this dish and wants it again, canned soup just doesn't do it for me.

I really liked this! I did add fresh garlic and onions. Next time will cut back on the buyer by a couple of tablespoons. I had to use boneless skinless thighs as that was all I had but it made no difference. Perfecto!

This was delicious. I used 6 T. of butter and it was a lot. I cooked the chicken, placed them in casserole, added the mushrooms to the same pan I cooked chicken in to save a pot to have to wash. To the mushrooms, I added the soups, cream and minced garlic. I used half and half instead. I added sliced onions to the mushrooms too. Then I quick cooked a bunch of asparagus. Lastly, I poured the sauce over chicken, then placed the asparagus around the edges of casserole dish, placed the glass lid on my 10x10 casserole and popped it into the oven.  The sauce is a nice, mild sauce. I served it over wide, egg noodles. I will definitely make this again!

I changed so much with this recipe but kept the same ingredients. My family of 4 (kids aged 10 and 12) all raved, which is no easy task.  So excited to add chicken Danielle to my repertoire and know it can be played with.

This was an absolute hit with my family. I didn't have a can of Cream of Chicken so made my own. Only substitutions were Malbec wine instead of Marsala as had an open bottle and a clove of garlic. Chicken was flavorful and very tender. Served with pasta and a side salad. Will definitely make again.

In short, this is a chicken with mushroom cream sauce recipe. Chicken and sauce is delicious! The pasta didn't really pair well. Next time I may try mashed potatoes.

Delicious - I made quite a few changes just due to missing ingredients... here goes:

1. I used a cheap Malbec wine I had instead of Marsala. 
2. Did NOT use heavy cream OR cream of chicken, only used the 1 can of cream of mushroom (and then added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth)
3. Did not use any of the spices except salt and pepper
4. Only used about 3 tbsp butter - cooked the chicken in it, removed chicken, used that same pan for the mushrooms, added the wine, chicken broth, and cream of mushroom to the mushrooms when they were done (instead of using another pan for mushrooms and dividing these steps amongst two pants)

I poured the chicken and mushroom sauce over spaghetti and it was delicious. I served it with asparagus. Super easy cleanup and DELICIOUS meal!

This dish was delish! I used one skillet; and I added some fresh garlic in with the rosemary & thyme. I also only used about a 1/2 cup of the Marsala wine to maintain the consistency of the sauce. Everything came out perfect! Will definitely make again!

This was definantly a keeper but I will either use smaller breasts next time or pound them flat and coat them with bread crumbs next time.  I can also imagine adding sliced squash to the cream sauce before putting it in the oven.  Yumm

I've made this many times, and I have some tips.  If you like mushrooms, it's safe to go ahead and double the amount - it will still turn out! I've also used a variety of different mushrooms in the sauce, portobello being a favorite.   Also, I HIGHLY recommend you go for the famous "brand name" cream soups, and NOT substitute generic.  There is a big difference; believe me.  I've also substituted a lesser amount of dried herbs in lieu of the fresh (to save a few bucks) and enjoyed it just as much.  This is great over spaghetti or linguini, as well as orzo.  I also love asparagus or a garden salad as a side.

Loved the creamy sauce, I did not use the whole mushrooms but I did add some fresh garlic, also I cooked it all in 1 skillet and simmered it on the stove top instead of putting it in the oven.  Turned out awesome! My daughter in law absolutely loved it ?

Wow this was AMAZING!!!
What I did different:
I also cooked everything in one pan. I made the chicken first...then added both soups to the mix.....put that on low heat to simmer. Cooked the mushrooms as directed then added them to the soup/chicken mixture. Used milk instead of cream and the specified spices. Let that simmer on medium heat while the pasta cooked. Came out fabulous. Even my 8 and 12 year old son ate it all up!

I loved this recipe. I am waiting on my husband to come home to eat but I tasted it and.... WOW! I love it. I did cut the butter to only about 4tbsp. and I also only used the one pan to cook everything. Browned the chicken, transferred the chicken, and used that same butter to saute the mushrooms, then I added the soups and wine. I did leave it a little longer in the oven. About 50 min.

I give it 5 stars, but my wife and kid (the more traditional fare eaters in our family) gave it 4, so 4.3 stars overall. both liked it, but their only complaint was that the sauce was a little heavy when made as directed. The chicken came out great! Next time, I'll thin the sauce a little bit which will give us one to add to our regular dinner rotation. Thanks.

I cooked this for dinner today.  My husband says it is a keeper.  I think I enjoyed the consistency of the sauce more than the taste of it.  It is creamy and great with the toast I made from Italian bread.  I used boneless thighs instead of breasts.  Just my preference.

WOW!  So good!  I did reduce the butter, and used half & half.  Added garlic, and just used one pan for the whole thing...not including pasta of course.  Thanks so much for your recipe!

I added minced garlic, Montreal chicken seasoning, and used about 1.5lbs. thin sliced chicken breasts.  Served with steamed broccoli and french bread.  The reason for only three stars is I'm not a fan of the canned soup flavor.

Delicious!  It does require some cleanup, but it is worth it!  I actually used a bit more Marsala and found the sauce wonderful. There was no saude left over here. I will be making this again and again!  It was a delightful meal.

I hate to say it, but add my name to the "canned soup over noodles" list.  For the time it took to make this recipe, plus the high fat content and expectation involved, I was extremely disappointed.  Won't make it again.

My family raves about this--even my teenage sone who hates mushrooms--he's willing to pick them out because he likes the sauce so much.  I've made t his several times--I don't have marsala wine on hand--I just use a little bit of sherry--I don't know if they have the same flavor--but it seems to work for us!

This was excellent.  I "kinda" made it according to the directions.  I give it 8 stars- largely in part, I think, because instead of cream of mushroom soup I used leftovers from the Creamy Mushroom Soup recipe on this site.

Delicious! I did not have a Marsala wine, so I used a red dessert wine that I had on hand. And I accidentally grabbed a can of cream of asparagus instead of cream of mushroom and it still turned out great. One thing to note - make sure you remove the chicken drippings from the heat and wait a few minutes before adding the soups. If not, the grease spatter is terrible! Overall, very good. I will make this again.

Lengthy preparation, but well worth the wait!  Rich and creamy sauce you can add or subtract what you love or what you don't care for.  I always load on the mushrooms. yum!

This recipe was great.  The only reason I rated it a 4 was because I changed a few things before trying the original...then it was a 5!!  I added 2 cloves of fresh garlic and 1/2 chopped onion to butter.  I only used a total of 6 tbs. of butter and used 1 skillet to do everything.  Adding more mushrooms is a GREAT idea.  Then I used angel hair pasta and garnished with freshed chopped parsley before serving along with green beans as well!  Fantastic!!

This is not something I will ever make again. We could not even finish the dinner because the sauce is so thick and heavy! The flavor combination is OK, but it really tastes like soup with wine over noodles. To make matters worse; there is no need for so much butter, or dirtying 2 skillets. I will stick to good old fashion chicken marsala from now on!

This is smooth and subtle, and very pleasing.  I cut the chicken into slices before sauteing it in olive oil (no way I'm putting 8 Tbs of butter in this dish!).  I used merlot instead of Marsala.  Great for the adults, but my three year-old also raved about it.

Everyone in the family liked this dinner, which makes it a definate do again in my book.  The only thing I did differently was that I left the mushrooms out of the finished dish, and served them only on my husband and my chicken, as the kids dont like them.

I substituted fat-free half and half for the cream, to cut down on the fat. It was still delicious, but my chicken was slightly over-done. Next time, I would cut the cooking time by a few minutes.

I have to give this only 3 stars. It was okay but definitely not worth spending 1,000 of my daily calories on. Even with the rosemary and thyme it was still a little bland.

This is a delicious recipe!  My boyfriend cooked this for our Valentine's Day dinner and was surprised at how easy it was (he doesn't cook very often).  I would recommend watching the chicken closely, as ours was cooked in a little less than 30 minutes.  Thanks, Danielle!
