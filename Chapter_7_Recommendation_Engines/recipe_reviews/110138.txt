This is super sweet and just kind of off tasting.  On top of that, you need to open a can of Red Bull (R) for 2 oz...I hate that.  Now I'm off to search for a drink to make to use the remainder of the can, because it won't be another of these.   If you like super sweet, this may be for you.  If not, keep searching.  Note:  the recipe says to use a "tall glass"...w/quite a bit of ice this just filled a highball glass, so prepare accordingly.  Cheers!

I didn't make it for myself, but for a friend who loves sweet tea. She said it was pretty good but we skipped the red bull in favor of lemon lime and topped the whole thing off with a bit of seltzer.
