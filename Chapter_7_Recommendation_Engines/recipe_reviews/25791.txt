My understanding is that these "bars," which really are candy, have been a sentimental favorite since the company began making them in 1918! Cherry Mash even has it's own web site, on which you can either order the necessary cherry baking chips, or they guide you to massive web sites (think Amazon) where they also may be purchased if difficult to find in your area.   In other words, if you REALLY need to make these but can't find the chips, it CAN be done! This recipe is on the package of chips on which they direct you to mix the nuts in with the chocolate/peanut butter mixture. They also suggest refrigerating this for faster setting, which indeed worked nicely. I guess I can see why some people think of these fondly, particularly if they grew up with them and have memories of their childhood. Maybe they're an acquired taste because as  a Cherry Mash newbie I found them ungodly sweet and artificial tasting.  Maybe that's their appeal!  The chocolate/peanut butter/nut layer, however, is a perfect contrast, and if you don't like the cherry part it's good on it's own.  I will say that I can't imagine making these without the nuts - the salty crunch and contrast in texture is a must for this candy and even using chunky peanut butter would not be a similar substitute.  In the final analysis, I'm sure Cherry Mash Bar lovers would rate these five stars, as I'm sure they must be close to the real thing, but without the nostalgia these are not much more than a sugar rush for me.

YUMMY! This candy tastes very close to the candy bar.  
The only change I made was that I put a chocolate layer on both top and bottom. I followed the recipe for the top chocolate layer but omitted the nuts.  I poured this in my 8 x 8 pan first and allowed it to cool before adding the cherry layer and finishing with the top chocolate/nut layer.

Excellent!!!!
i could not find cherry chips. I used about 5 drops cherry candy flavoring found at a local craft store, and white morsels, made it pink with some red food color.  Tasted just like cherry mash my Grandma use to make!!!!

Decadent!  I tried them with the butterscotch chips and wow -- very, very sinful.  It doesn't say in the recipie where to put the peanuts (type-o, I think) -- but I added them into the semi-sweet chocolate layer (just like the candy bar).  My 10-year old daughter and her friends went berserk over them -- a definite hit with kids!  Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  However, I found it impossible to find cherry baking chips so I substituted them with white baking morsels and added strawberry extract to them.  It worked well.

Very good recipe!  I used Milk Chocolate instead of Semi-Sweet chips.  I made 5 different kinds of Christmas Candy and this was everyone's favorite!  Thanks!

Old family recipe that is simple to make yet looks very colorful and delicious to the taste!  

You can find cherry chips at local department/grocery stores and dollar stores, usually shelved with the chocolate chips.  

Have also experienced "loose" pink layer so cook 10 minutes stirring constantly up to and while it boils.  

Per recipe on the chips bag, added half the peanuts with addition of cherry chips and the other half with the chocolate/peanut butter mixture.

This is reminiscent of that old-time candy found in supermarkets ages ago.  My brother-in-law LOVES cherry mash candy, so this was a find!  Also, it didn't say what to do with the peanuts, but I mixed them into the chocolate peanut butter mix and sprinkled a few on top.  Divine!

Very good & very rich. I didn't have peanuts, but I did use chunky peanut butter. I can see where the addition of salted peanuts would help cut the sweetness. We really enjoyed this, but the remainder is going to the office tomorrow!

I have always had confidence in 5/5 star recipes and hardly ever dislike what I make, but this one is just not a keeper for us.  Unless my cherry chips were just bad quality, these flavors are way too sweet and don't mix very well (choc/pb/cherry)  Ended up, dumping the cherry layer out and eating the pb/choc. Also, this recipe doesn't seem to list what to do with the peanuts, even though I used nuts under choc.  Sorry!

This is one of my favorite candies from when I was a kid. Years later, it's still my favorite. I thought the recipe was lost after my grandmother died, as no one outside my family I've talked to has ever heard of it. I'm absolutely delighted to find such a wonderful recipe again.

These are pretty good! Very rich! I could not find cherry chips anywhere locally so I used Hersheys raspberry flavored chocolate chips instead. I doubled the recipe and put in a 15X10 inch pan. The taste is very different. This is more of a candy than a cookie. It tastes sort of like a Mr. Goodbar with a berry twist. You need to work quickly spreading the mixture in the pan. I also would press the peanuts in this mixture next time after spreading, then put the topping on . I think it would be easier.  Thanks Sarah

Wow, I love everything cherry and this fits the bill.  They are very, very sweet so I cut the pieces very small.  I found the cherry chips at Cub Foods.

No cherry chips here...  Substituted cranraisins into cherry bottom with white chocolate chips and followed the recipe.  Also used Dove Dark chocolate and semisweet chocolate stars from the grocery store.  Picky hubby and 18month old loved it!

Thanks for sharing this recipe. Never heard of cherry mash but made these for my cherry loving husband for the holidays.  He loved them.  I'm not sure about the chocolate/peanut butter/cherry combination myself but I will make them again for my mate.

Very good!  I used chunky peanut butter instead of adding peanuts and it is great!  Will make again and will try using butterscotch chips for something different.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a small batch and very thin. I used the recipe for the chocolate and peanut butter (crunchy)portion, but did 1 1/2 times the amount (minus peanuts). I put that in the bottom of a 9X13 pan lined with parchment and cooled. I then doubled the cherry layer and put it on top of the chocolate and cooled that layer. Last, I again used 1 1/2 times the recipe for the chocolate layer and added peanuts and topped all with this layer. Much thicker and more like the real Cherry Mash bars. Enjoy!

I made these to bring to work for a treat day. I, personally, would give them two stars since I thought the cherry layer was too sweet, and the fake cherry flavor was cloying. But, a number of my coworkers seemed to like them, so I bumped up the stars to three. They aren't bad, by any means - it's just a matter of personal taste.
