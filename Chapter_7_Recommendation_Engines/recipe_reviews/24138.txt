Light, fluffy, everything a pancake should be - I cut the sugar down to 2 Tbsp., added 1 tsp. of vanilla, and used 2 Tbsp. of melted butter vs. 1/4 c. of vegetable oil.

These were really, really good! Very light and fluffy and definitely restaurant quality. I was able to made 12 medium size pancakes by upping the flour and buttermilk to 1/2 a cup, but left everything else the same.  I also added a splash of vanilla extract to the batter and used brown sugar.  These really didn't need syrup.  We rolled them up with sausage links and hubby (who's not a breakfast person) had 2 helpings.  I'm so glad I gave these a try.  Highly recommended!  Thanks bunches Amber :)

My family loved, loved, loved, this recipe!  We just finished eating a batch of these yummy pancakes!  They are so light and fluffy!  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I added 2 tbs. of vinegar to regular milk.  It helped give it that delicious buttermilk flavor.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  That seemed to give it a better consistency.   I will definitely be making these again!

These pancakes are good but the recipe calls for to much sugar. Next time I will halve the sugar. I used a 50 percent all purpose flour to 50 percent buckwheat flour.

Be sure to double this recipe. I have three teenage children and could put both batches away in a heart beat. I served with fresh blueberry sauce but my son used real Canadian Maple Syrup. Either way I will make again.

Excellent! I used a mixer b/c I don't have a blender and they were still light and fluffy. Be careful when cooking, they burn easily. Cook on medium heat.

I made these for breakfast this morning and we really enjoyed the sweet, light texture.  My only change would be to add a pinch of salt.  I'll be saving this one in my recipe box and definitely make these again.

I LOVE this recipe!!!  Even my little picky eaters did!  My kids even wanted thirds (which is UNHEARD of!).  Thanks for the recipe!  This will be my normal pancake recipe.  I did try and like the Buttermilk pancakes II, but these are so easy!
Thanks again!

Perfect! Very light, fluffy, and flavorful. These melt in your mouth and taste so good with peaches, butter, and cool whip. This recipe was just what I was searching for. I have tried other highly rated recipes on the site, but they just don't compare to this one. Yummy! My child even compared them to the fabulous resturaunt (not a chain) pancakes I was looking to emulate, and said she liked them as much! Well, kids are perfectly honest! This is going to be a staple in my house. I did make a few changes to make them less fattening, though: I used reduced fat buttermilk, baking splenda for sugar, and light butter instead of oil, and they were still fabulous! I also had to subsitute 1/4 cup of milk for buttermilk since I ran out. I bet they'd be even better with the regular stuff. Great recipe.

NOT REAL PANCAKES. I am sorry to have to do this, but I can't give these a great review. I tried them to make and freeze as a quick to-go snack, though I was confused about the mixing method - THE BLENDER?? Doesn't this go against traditional pancake 'mix until just barely combined' reasoning? OKAY, well it does. They seemed at first to be light and fluffy, LOOKED GREAT but the texture was just too weird. Like gummy, or something. I am still going to make them for myself, alter the recipe and include whole grains, and use them as a carb boost before running. But not ever for morning pancakes.

I just found out (by accident) that if you cut out the oil, it would still taste the same AND you can use the amount of oil you cut out to grease the pan rather than putting it in the pancake itself.

This is the PERFECT pancake recipe! They're exactly like what you get at the popular pancake house! I was concerned that tossing everything in the blender would result in a rubbery pancake, but they were perfect. Plus I love that the blender's pour spout allows me to make perfectly round pancakes. Now I can't wait to have breakfast guests so I can impress them with this recipe! Long live Leema! Your recipe rocks! 5 stars!

These pancakes were pretty good.  I can't pinpoint it but something is bland about them surprisingly enough.  I added 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla which helped.  I honestly have to say I think they are almost too sweet.  Need like a 1/4 tsp of salt or something to break up the straight sugar flavor. Especially once you put syrup on them.  Good but I prefer my old pancakes. Sorry =(

I wanted to update my review.  These fluffy pancakes are my go to recipe!!  I add a tsp of vanilla, a 1/4 tsp of butter flavoring and a pinch of salt.  I now have found a much easier way to cook them.  Preheat oven to 425.  Place pancake batter in a 9x13 pan (with nonstick spray) and bake for 10 minutes.  Cut and serve!  Much easier than standing over a hot stove :). This has seriously changed my life!!

I really liked these pancakes. I doubled the recipe and it was a little thin so I added 1/4 C more flour. I would use just half the amount of sugar next time as I do not care for "sweet".

I used this as base for Whole Wheat Sourdough Pancakes.  Mix WW Flour & Buttermilk night before, cover & set overnight.  Add other ingredients in morning.  Alt: Bumped Flour & Milk to 2 C, added 1/4 tsp Salt, Doubled other ingredients... WONDERFUL!!  Had 6 picky college girls over for breakfast.. scarfed these right down!

Ohhh yum! I had bought buttermilk for a cake that I was baking and had a lot to use up so I made this recipe. I was making it at supper time (I freeze my pancakes so my kids can have them in the mornings) but had something else cookin' for the hubby and myself, but we couldn't keep our hands off these! I bet we ate 4 pancakes prior to supper! Needless to say, we weren't so hungry for our supper! My kids had them for supper and gobbled them right up! I don't think I will make another pancake recipe other than this one! LOVE IT!

too much sugar and I can taste the baking soda.  I'd reduce the baking soda by half and add only a couple of tbls of sugar.

Really yummy fluffy pancakes--have used this recipe a long time now! I never have buttermilk on hand but always have sour cream, so my pancakes are always sour cream cakes rather than butter milk. I just use almost a cup of milk (don't make too runny) and 1/4 cup sour cream. The pancakes melt in your mouth. :o) Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

WOW! This is the best pancake I had. We used wheat flour instead of the white which added some more texture and crunchiness to the pancake. We absolutely loved it. Buttermilk was the magic ingredient. The pancake was fluffy, moist, slightly browned, & slightly sweet. This is a recipe to keep.

my family LUVed these pancakes! they told me they were better than the restaurant kind. At first they were skeptical because it involved using the puree function on the blender, but it turned out good. However, the second time we made this we didn't use the blender and instead hand mixed it. This resulted in crepe like pancakes that broke easily.

4 stars b/c I mistakenly did not follow the recipe, but they came out excellent none the less. I did not look to see that these were supposed to be made in a blender I just mixed the dry ingredients in a bowl and added the wet. I was thinking of decreasing the amount of sugar but instead I accidentally forgot to add it all together ;) it worked out fine because I don't like things too sweet and I do use a little maple syrup. I think if I did add sugar, personally I would use a lot less than called for, maybe use a tablespoon or two. I also ended up using a touch more buttermilk to thin out the batter a tad. My pancakes came out so light and fluffy, really good. For me it ended up making 6 6inch diameter pancakes, so I would maybe double it next time!

No salt, too much sugar, and the blender creates too much gluten which toughens the batter and makes it rubbery. Too much baking soda as well; the baking soda should just be enough to adjust for the lower pH of buttermilk, and the batter should rise with the application of heat, not beforehand. Halve the sugar, halve the baking soda, add 1/4 tsp salt, mix by hand, and now you have a real pancake batter.

I'll never buy a box mix again! These make the most delicious pancakes you'll ever eat. I reduced the sugar by about half and added 1 teaspoon of salt. Be sure to use pure maple syrup!

Pretty good. I wasn't blown away per say but I'm not a huge pancake fan and everyone else said they were tasty. I separated the dry and wet ingredients before mixing together and they came out pretty full and fluffy. I will try to part II recipe and compare.

Good flavor, but really runny. Followed the recipe exactly. We prefer a thicker pancake.

Very tasty pancakes.  Need to be patient while they cook.  Added 1 tsp vanilla.  We doubled the batch to feed 4 - 5 people.

Awesome! I got compliments all around. I used lemon juice to make buttermilk. LOVE doing it in the blender. Oh and I got 8 pancakes out of the batch.

These are the best pancakes I have ever made. I was looking for I-Hop and I found better than I-Hop. They do melt in your mouth.  I used the trick of milk with a little vinegar to substitute for the buttermilk. 1 1/1 c. milk and a tablespoon of plain white vinegar. Out of this world. This is my new pancake recipe. Thank you!

Well this weekend that passed I decided to make these. They were FLAT. I took the advice of others and let it rest in the fridge for about an 1 hr. I added some vanilla but they were flat. I'm disappointed because of that. But I am going to give them a shot again this weekend and im only going to let them rest for about 15 mins and see what happens then.

These are fabulous!  I prefer to whisk them by hand, instead of using the blender.  They turn out spongy when you use the blender.

These have a really great taste, but the batter came out super thin for me and I got a whole bunch of pancakes...then I came back to write this review and realized I completely left out the 1/4 c. of veg. oil!!! Duh! Anyway, they still came out very good and it makes me wonder if I'll put the veg oil in next time...I also added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (cuz I always do, even to box mix) and had to make my own buttermilk (1 T. lemon juice to 1 c. milk, let it sit for 5 min before using). So, I'm gonna PRINT this out and tape it to the inside of my "baking" cupboard, because I think this is way better than, and just as quick as, a pancake mix.

Defintely the best pancakes my family has ever had - we love these.  I add blueberries, bananas and other goodies to them sometimes too.  I have to double the batch easily each time.  It's a definite keeper!

This was great!!  I had spare buttermilk from a previous recipe and decided to make these for my son before school.  He LOVED them!  They are so easy to make and so quick too!  I was going to do what others suggested and add a tsp of vanilla but forgot.  It didn't matter though because they tasted delicious without it.  I also didn't have any oil so used butter instead which worked perfectly. I don't have a blender but the food processor worked just as well. The pancakes are so light and fluffy, perfect.  Thank you.

these are pretty good pancakes. no changes made aside from substituting 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. blending makes these pancakes light plus there's an easy clean up. thanks amber!

We raved about these pancakes - the best recipe so far that I have tried.  I live in Germany, so it's not easy to find similar ingredients here, but this was so simple and turned out great!  I took photos, so I will submit them for you.  This will be my pancake recipe from now on...fluffy and tasty...yum to the MAX!

I had some left over buttermilk and saw this recipe.  These pancakes are so light and fluffy.  I did what some of the reviews recommended and only added a couple of tablespoons of sugar and a dash of salt. So good !!!!

I made this recipe as written and my pancakes turned out light, fluffy and delicious!  In fact, I made a double batch so we could have them all week.  A great recipe that I will be using again.  Topped them with 'Absolute Best Pancake Syrup' from AR - and we all thought the pancakes and the syrup were the best!

Great basic recipe! So easy to make and clean up since all you need is a few measuring spoons and cups, the blender, and a spatula! 10/10 rating! Great with some homemade fruit sauce and maple syrup! I would highly recommend this recipe.

Very good, quick an easy recipe. A little sweet and I reduce the sugar by 1/2.  I don't like to use extra kitchen equipment if not necessary, so I omitted the blender and just whisked a few times by hand.  This way, they come out light and fluffy.  Sometimes I will add a mashed banana into the mix as we love banana pancakes in my house.

My family absolutely loves these pancakes! Even my picky toddler will eat them. I replace the sugar with honey and use spelt flour...they are still delicious and I "feel like" they are a little healthy. :) We freeze the extra batter in Ziploc bags and add fresh fruit or chocolate chips. Yum!!

I found the batter to be runny and the pancakes to be off in taste.  I followed the directions and didn't substitute anything.  They were very filling, however.  I probably won't make these again. Sorry.

I made this when we had guests for lunch, with syrupy strawberries on the side. Some pancakes had a handful of blueberries cooked into them. And squeezable golden syrup for those who preferred their stack with less imagination. It was a treat for everyone.

Rarely do I make pancakes though tried these  and they were delicious.  I used a little less sugar was the only change made based on prior comments.  Cooking for one presents its challenges as in leftovers.  I put the extra pancakes in a plastic sandwich bag and will just warm them in skillet to enjoy again tomorrow.

Excellent. Super fluffy. I would increase the buttermilk to 1/5 cups because my batter was too thick. The sugar in the batter does the trick, but next time I might cut the sugar in half.

great recipe!
i'm in the process of still grilling a few pancakes, but wanted to write this because they're so good! I made a few modifications: used 1.5 C of flour, used brown sugar instead of white. I didn't have a full 1.25 cups of buttermilk, so I substituted with some 2% milk. And finally I added bacon! It was leftover from the salad last night. So good!

I wouldn't buy buttermilk just to make these, but if you have some to use up, they aren't that bad. Thin, not fluffy, and sweet.

This is the latest addition to my "go to" pancake recipes.  Putting the batter in the blender goes against everything I have ever seen or heard about pancake batter, so I couldn't bring myself to do it.  Overmixing is the death of pancake batter so I didn't put this in the blender.  I stirred gently until mixed and it came out  just fine.  I liked the addition of the sugar because otherwise it's a pretty standard pancake recipe... buttermilk, flour, baking soda & salt

OMG..... We enjoyed this recipe! My husband loves to make pancakes every Saturday, so we always keep a box of HJ in the pantry. Well I must say after making these (which was super easy) we will never buy box pancake mix again. The only thing we added was a 1/2 tbl spoon of vanilla. Thanks for the recipe!!

These were the best pancakes! I did not use a blender. I just mixed them by hand, and they turned out wonderful. I had some fresh blueberries and pecans that I sprinkled on top of some of them while they were cooking, and that was especially good. They are sweeter than traditional pancakes, but I really enjoyed them. I just used a little less syrup than I normally would. This will be my go-to pancake recipe from now on!

Very good! Substituted soured milk (milk + 1 t. vinegar, let sit for a few mins to curdle) because it was super early and I didn't have any buttermilk. Very fluffy and made just the right amount of pancakes for two people with average appetites. A keeper for sure!

These pancakes taste great but cook up flat. I was expecting wonderfully fluffy pancakes, so that was disappointing. My baking products are all new and have been "proofed," so I know the problem isn't with my powder or soda.

I agree with the other reviews: Light and Fluffy and restaurant quality recipe.  I did add vanilla (1 tsp.).  i also doubled this recipe for left overs.  They freeze great.  I put either parchment paper or wax paper between each pancake.  I take them directly from the freezer and pop them in the toaster.

Terrific! I had tried other pancake recipes, and there simply seemed to be not enough fluff. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, with a bit less sugar and adding some vanilla and cinnamon, and am eating them as I type! They're wonderfully fluffy, and the texture is amazing. I mixed them in a bowl and let my buttermilk (milk +vinegar) and eggs sit out a bit beforehand.

Needs SALT! I had to throw out the first two pancakes before I realized this. Also, they aren't very thick. I was wanting something a little thicker.

Using the blender for this recipe made it so quick and easy as the batter poured out perfectly without making any additional mess. The pancakes puffed up nicely and were light, fluffy and delicious.

These were amazingly fluffy!  I followed 2 suggestions from other reviewers - 1) I upped the flour & buttermilk to 1&1/2 cups and left the other ingredients the same 2) I let the buttermilk and eggs sit out of the fridge for a couple of hours prior to making the batter.  They were incredibly fluffy and delicious!  I used whole wheat flour and they weren't weighed down at all.

This recipe was delicious! Don't be concerned about how watery the batter looks - they come out just fine.

OMG, I have had so many pancake disasters but this is a foolproof, quick recipe. I made them last Sunday for my four year old niece and she loved them. The only changes I made were the following:
- Didn't have buttermilk so I substituted with 1 1/4 cup milk and just over 1 Tbsp vinegar
- Added 1 tsp vanilla to the liquid mixture
- Added 1/4 tsp salt to the dry mixture

I made a big batch after work today which I'm going to freeze and just heat up in the toaster as needed.
Thanks for a great recipe! :)

I just tried this recipe this morning and it had a very good taste and texture. The only change I made was to add a dash of cinnamon and vanilla flavoring, which I do to all pancake recipes. I followed the advice of another post and used a whisk instead of cranking up the blender. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

My family LOVED these, my 8yo son said I should put this recipe on the internet so other people can make them ;). My daughter who loves sugary foods ate these without syrup. They are that good. 
I did add a pinch of salt and splash of vanilla as recommended by others. The first few pancakes I flipped when they were almost too soft to flip, and those are the ones I liked the best. ENJOY!!

Great pancakes, batter saves well in the fridge for a couple of days.  These are very easy to make and my daughter and husband love them.

After reading the mixed reviews on this recipe I was a bit nervous about their taste.  I make pancakes for my kids once a week before school and they were the judge for taste.  Both kids like them very much.  Their addition to the recipe was butterscotch chips!

We really enjoyed these. The only thing I did differently was the addition of about 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and I didn't bother with the blender, I just whisked wet ingredients into dry and blended really well. My boyfriend commented that 'this is how I like my pancakes.' It made the perfect amount for our family of four.  We will certainly be using this again.  Thank you!

These were GREAT! My DH said they were a million times better than the boxed version. Clean up was simple with the blender. I did have to scrape down the sides of the blender to make sure all the dry parts got mixed in properly..but this could be cause I have an OLD blender. 
I don't think I will ever make boxed pancakes again... amazing!

This is a great recipe. I've made these several times and my wife loves them.  I leave out the sugar, whisking the batter well instead of using a blender, and I use a 1/4 measuring cup to make the pancakes on a non-stick griddle.  I also add about a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla when mixing (but that's just me).  Syrup really could be optional because of the light texture and good flavor.

Yummy taste!  Very light and soft.  Somewhat hard to flip and keep from burning.  Maybe that is due to the high sugar content.  I will try reducing the sugar next time.  The batter was also too thin.  I had to add 1/4 cup more flour.  Next time I might make it a bit thicker.  Overall the taste was great, but the recipe needs to be adjusted a bit.

These are great pancakes with some changes! I substitute the oil for melted butter and add 1/4 cup more flour.  I do like these better than any other pancake recipe on here with these changes done!  They are thick and delicious with my brother in laws own maple syrup! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Amazing, fluffy, light pancakes that are SO easy to make. We followed the recipe exactly, and mix the dry ingredients in advance, so that we just pull out a container of the dry, mix with the liquids in a blender, and stir in fresh blueberries. HUGE rave from me- these never stick around for long at the brunch table!

Wow! These pancakes were wonderful! My family is very picky with pancakes and I've tried sooo many recipes and this is the favorite.  I had been discouraged to try buttermilk pancakes because of the popular buttermilk pancake recipe (I think it's II) on this site.  They are horrible and very eggy tasting.  These were perfect, light, fluffy, nice texture, height, etc.  I did not use my blender, just whisked the ingredients together, also I only used 2 tbsps of sugar.  I will keep this as my pancake recipe!  My only alteration will be to add some vanilla next time.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I've tried numerous pancake recipes before, and they never seem to come out right.  But then I came across this one and it seemed really easy so I gave it a shot.  And lo and behold, it's great!!  I've made it like 5 times in the past couple of weeks!  It's simple and tastes really good.  If I have any leftovers, I just let them cool and put them in a ziploc bag and throw them in the freezer for breakfast at a later date.

This is the best of the two buttermilk recipes on this website.  Very easy to make in the blender.  Put unused portions in the fridge, blender and all, and use the next day.  They make beautiful pancakes that brown evenly on BOTH sides and the flavor is excellent.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks.

We really enjoyed these pancakes.  They have a nice texture and delicious taste.  We like our pancakes a little less sweet so I would reduce the sugar to 2T. next time I make them. Thanks for the recipe Amber.  Sincerely,  Bonnie

I've made these twice now. First time, I followed the recipe exactly. Good consistency, but very bland. that's why the 3 star rating. I thought I'd try again with a couple of tweaks. My husband (a pancake snob) asked me to save the recipe. They were excellent. I used coconut oil (melted) instead of vegetable oil. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (I used Penzey's brand) and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I cooked on a cast iron griddle, heated, with butter. Delicious! Saved this recipe to my favs.

I pretty much followed the recipe but I used some of the other reviewers advice by adding:  a dab of vanilla, salt, and an extra 1/4 cup of flower.  The flower wasn't necessary and I had to add milk to thin it out again.

really nice flavour though - family loved them.  Will definatley make these again.  I loved how easy they were.

I have a different buttermilk pancake recipe from this site that I normally use but when my kids had a school holiday and I went to make them, I discovered that I only had one egg. I frantically searched through other recipes and found this one. They turned out great! I took another reviewers advice and added an extra half cup of buttermilk and flour and a dash of vanilla. Everyone loved them!

These were a little thin for my liking, but tasted great. I loved how easy they came together in the blender.

The best pancakes I've ever made! I used homemade buttermilk and added a teaspoon of vanilla, some ground flax and a pinch of cinnamon.

I added vanilla, salt and replaced the oil with butter to give flavor. It did stick to the pan a little bit, but I was still able to turn the pancake. I could still taste the baking soda a little bit. They did not come out fluffy. The blender made it easy, but I think I find another recipe next time.

Disappointing. Not like a pancake at all more like a crepe. I hoped with the amount of baking powder that they would be really light and fluffy but they were flat, no rise to them at all.

My family loves these. I only change the amount of sugar I add. My husband thinks they are too sweet with what the recipe calls for. So I add a tad less then what recipe asks for.  I also love how we can change the amount of servings cause some mornings there's only five of us and other mornings there's eight!

I made this exactly as instructed and came out perfectly! One of the best homemade pancake recipes! I had to cook them on a lower setting than I usually use for pancakes in order not to burn; it didn't affect the cook time. Next time I will half the sugar, add 1/2 tsp salt and add a little cornmeal, letting it sit 30+mins before cooking. I am trying to duplicate the AMAZING room service buttermilk pancakes I had at Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas when I got married. Sentimental and this recipe is a good start. Moist, yet light and fluffy....Cosmo's were all of that but heavy and filling all the same time.

Fantastic! We had to multiply the recipe. The servings weren't really true to yield for our family. It turned out to be way too much, but still fantastic. I think in the future we'll just use a single batch for the six of us, maybe a double if we have company.

I used some of the tips and suggestions from other reviews. I used 2tablespoons of sugar, omited the oil and used 2tablespoons of melted butter and added 1teaspoon of vanilla. The pancakes came out great, however I found them a little too sweet so next time I will use 1tablespoon of sugar. They were very fluffy thanks!

I made these pancakes for breakfast this morning - after discovering I only had 1 egg and the exact amount of buttermilk needed in this recipe.  (Perhaps fate was involved!)  I was a bit skeptical about mixing all the ingredients in the blender, as most recipes indicate that one should mix until slightly lumpy.  (Over-mixing typically results in a tough pancake.)  However, this recipe, followed precisely as written, produced the BEST, LIGHTEST, and MOST-DELICIOUS pancakes I have ever made!  Slightly sweet, fluffy and delicate...these pancakes were EXACTLY what I've always been searching for in a pancake recipe.  I'm a Family and Consumer Sciences Teacher - think Home Economics meets 21st Century.  I've made many, many, many pancakes through the years and been in charge of thousands of students as they've done the same.  This recipe is now at the top of my list!!!  Thank you for sharing this...it will be THE pancake recipe in my home from now on!!!

I love pancakes and since I was out of mix, I used this recipe to make my own.  I tried to put the mix in my blender and it made a big mess. Next time I will just skip this step and mix by hand.  I added cinnamon and vanilla and they came out almost perfect. I prefer my pancakes a little thinner.  Also they didn't bubble up as much as the mix so I almost burned the first one. Still I think I found the foundation of a recipe I will be using for a long, long time.

Very good basic recipe - I cut the sugar to 2 tablespoons and added 1/4 tsp. salt and about 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest, then by hand, stirred in some blueberries. It made 15, 3" pancakes, which fed three adults, with 1 pancake left over. My dog was thrilled to get that last one! Merry Christmas!

We love these pancakes.  They are so light and fluffy.  They are my favorite and a great way to use up buttermilk. I make  these quite often.

I loved the idea of a blender pancake, but my blender really struggled with this, I had to keep sticking a spatula in to readjust the way the batter sat in the blender.  The blender made pouring evenly sized pancakes very easy, and they puffed up so nicely when I flipped them - but when I took them off the griddle, they sank into a less than ideal texture, although they were cooked the right amount.  I found the batter to be a bit too sweet and really not to have a lot of flavor, certainly not that special flavor I expect from a buttermilk pancake.  They were good enough and my kids enjoyed them with chocolate chips, but I wouldn't make them again.  I followed the recipe exactly, except using coconut oil instead of vegetable oil since it is healthier and tastier.

These pancakes are fantastic!!! I have always made them going exactly by the recipe but I think next time I will reduce the sugar. It's just a little too much after I add syrup for my two small children. The taste, is incredible....the sugar high, not so much!!! Very light and fluffy!

Loved these! I only decided to make them because I was fresh out of milk and too lazy (due with baby any minute) to go to the store. I had powdered buttermilk and made these with that following the recipe exactly! Very yummy :)

This is a very delious recipe the only change I made is that I doubled the recipe and still added just 1/4 cup of sugar everthing else I kept to the recipe. I made some plain & some I sprinkled with crumbled bacon before flipping them.Yummy!Thanks for a great recipe.

Not bad.  I like the fact that the recipe didn't have salt in it but I think it needed a little flavor so I added vanilla to it.  Also they are thin pancakes and I like mine a bit thicker so either cut back on the liquid or add a little more flour.  I also added half the oil.

OMG! I literally just finished preparing and enjoying these pancakes. They were so fluffy and flavorful. Very easy recipe to follow. Next time I will add some blueberries to the batter because blueberry pancakes are my favorite. I needed to get rid of some buttermilk I have in my fridge that I had no idea what to do with and this recipe was the perfect choice. Definitely will make again next time I am in the mood for pancakes.

These are really good, though I did not use a blender, but the add wet to dry method. I did substitute 1/4 cup wheat flour and used Meyer lemon juice to sour the milk (no buttermilk in the house right now).  I like that these pancakes are so light and fluffy. Served with peanut butter, bananas, and maple syrup. SO good!

Made these this past weekend and the only suggestion I have is to DOUBLE THE RECIPE!  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla like others have recommended.  They were delicious, but after 2 boys and a husband were served, I only got one.

I made these with low-fat buttermilk, added a dash of vanilla and cinnamon, and both my husband and I ate more than our share! These were moist and flavorful and will be made again in our home!

I just got this recipe in my email... I dont use buttermilk very often, but I used it 2 days ago for something so had a bit left in the fridge. Im very glad I tried this recipe! I have like 10 different pancakes recipes, but this one is definitely the best one. They were very moist and fluffy and very easy to make. Thank you :)

Excellent! We use fresh buttermilk (not cultured) left over from making butter, and maybe that's the key, but this makes the best pancakes -- great flavor, perfect texture. I've made it twice and it's a winning recipe.

These were pretty darn good. They aren't too fluffy but they do kinda melt in your mouth. I put a little vanilla but still tasted like it was missing something maybe a pinch of salt would have been okay but definately will make again with a pinch of like cinnamon or something.

I've been looking high and low for a good pancake recipe and this one is it.  I didn't use a blender; I used my KitchenAid with the whisk attachment.  As a previous reviewer had done I added an extra 1/4 of both flour and buttermilk along with about a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. salt.  Fantastic and this is now my go-to pancake recipe!

This batter made delicious pancakes!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, and the pancakes were very light and fluffy.  All I had was light buttermilk, and they were still perfect.  Somethings to keep in mind when making them:  -the batter both rises and spreads, so don't overcrowd your griddle. -let the griddle get hot before pouring the batter, but keep it at a medium heat.    I'll definitely be making these again!

This was a hit with my husband and cousin from out of town!  They wanted more and more! Only thing I changed was- I only used 1/2 tsp of salt and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  Aside from that, I kept everything the same. Everyone's family will enjoy these!

These were so good and easy to make!    To lighten them up a bit, I used less than 1/4 of Splenda (instead of sugar), canola oil (instead of veg oil), white whole wheat flour (instead of regular flour) and I sprinkled in a little bit of ground flaxseed and added 1 tsp vanilla.  My kids gobbled them up, saying they were better than IHOP's pancakes!  The pancakes were light and fluffy...perfect!   I think the buttermilk is the key to tasty pancakes!

I have made this recipe several times and am giving up on it.  They're just ok...too spongey without any "chew", they fall apart easily and they're terrible without syrup.  For awesome pancakes, that I couldn't stop eating, even plain, make the Buttermilk Pancakes II recipe.  They are much better.

I made these for dinner today, and they were a hit! Very light and fluffy. The only thing I would change next time (because there will definitely be a next time) is cut the sugar in half, because the pancakes were a little too sweet for my taste.

These were absolutely yummy and tender!  I just don't understand why they turned out so thin.  Would have loved a thick, fluffy pancake.  Not sure what I did wrong.

This was a fabulous base recipe.  I have tried many recipes before and have never had pancakes so light and fluffy!  This morning I woke up with a dire need for banana & chocolate chip pancakes.  But I wanted to start out with this base, so I just altered it a bit.  Here's what I did: substituted 1/4 c whole wheat flour to sneak a little nutrition in there.  Substituted the oil for 1 small mashed banana.  And added a dash of salt and 1/8t vanilla.  Then sprinkled with chocochips.  The result was heaven...on a plate.  Topped with a dallop of earth balance and maple syrup (though honestly, it wasn't really needed, but the kids have a moral obligation to put syrup on pancakes). They were a hit all around and no one would guess there was any whole wheat flour in there ;)

I made these this morning, and they were excellent. I went by the recipe exactly, but used a hand mixer, and it did fine. I think next time will add some blueberries.

Love this recipe.  I did reduce the oil to 2 Tablespoons and used about 1/4 cup of water to thin the batter slightly.  These disappeared fast.  I'll probably be adding buttermilk to my grocery list more regularly!

Way too much sugar for my liking.  I think I'll cut back next time and add a little salt.  Baking soda too maybe better if halved.  All in all a good light fluffy pancake.

Seriously one of the best buttermilk pancake recipes I've ever made Suzy! I doubled the ingredients with the exception of the baking powder, baking soda and oil and used powdered sugar instead of granulated. Extremely light and fluffy and my daughter who's home from college thought they were incredible and sends a personal "thank you!"

I made a large batch of these for the girls from our sleepover. I went with this recipe, so I wouldn't use all my butter. I added in some vanilla and a pinch of salt also. Then I mixed them up in my stand mixer until smooth. I used my 1/4 C to measure them out on the griddle. This batter is runny so they will spread out. I loved that they cut so nicely even after sitting for a bit, not all rubbery like others. The flavor of the baking soda was noticeable though so maybe use less.

These were wonderful!!!  I added some vanilla, and had to do one cup buttermilk, one cup 2% milk, 1/2 cup water, and they turned out perfect!!!  I will definitely be making these from now on.

This is the best from scratch pancake that I've tried, but something is still missing.  I grew up eating pancakes made with Bisquik, and I think that's just what I'm going to continue using.  Every from scratch recipe I've made just seems lacking in flavor.

These were very good, with one change.  I made them as written but they were too thick.  I added more buttermilk-maybe 1/2 cup to what was left of the batter after making 3 pancakes.  The rest were perfect, they melted in your mouth which was exactly what I was looking for.

I added a little salt to the dry ingredients, otherwise I left the recipe the same. These were light and fluffy.
My kids ate them with the Absolute Best Pancake Syrup from this site.

This was perfect for this morning as it
was easy to mix together and it gave me a chance to use up the buttermilk that was about to expire. They were good, but I liked the other buttermilk pancake recipe from this site.

Excellent recipe! Makes a smaller amount of pancakes great for two or three people. I also added a little vanilla and cinnamon and will add even more next time. Used part kamut flour, part all purpose. My batter needed to be thinned a bit, but even the first couple of thick pancakes tasted super!

These are excellent when the directions are followed.  Best pancakes I have ever had from scratch...my hubby is the pancake man so he makes these for me since I cant make them right for some reason.  Definitely needed to add vanilla  to the mix!

We ran low on buttermilk so we used a little buttermilk and skim milk. This substitution made a firmer pancake which I like but it had NO taste. Please do yourself a favor and use buttermilk or a concoction that is the same as using buttermilk.

Super Yummy! These are delicious and they rise up nice and fluffy.  I needed to use up some buttermilk and the kids wanted pancakes, so here I am writing that I have found my newest favorite recipe. The blender makes them easy to prepare, but since I hate cleaning the blender, I may try mixing them by hand next time. Either way, this one's definitely a keeper!  Thank you.

These were really good! I sprinkled wheat germ on one side while they were cooking and then again after they were on the plates just to add some fiber. Fantastic. :)

Excellent recipe!  I used Kefir in place of the buttermilk and used at least half whole wheat pastry flour and they were great.  I found that if you mix all the wet ingredients first, leave the blender running and add the dry ingredients a spoonful at a time it helps make them fluffy (especially if you use the Kefir and whole wheat flour).  My husband and son are hooked and I make these at least once a week.  They send their thanks.

These were the best pancakes I'd ever made from scratch. This WILL be our recipe to follow. I used an unbleached flour, and made the buttermilk out of 1% and a tablespoon of vinegar. Also used olive oil since that was all I had. The flavor was just exceptional! Update: I just made some of these pancakes with equal amounts of unbleached flour, graham flour and whole wheat flour-they needed just a bit lower heat than usual to keep from getting too brown, but they were awesome!

I have also tried the chocolate chip pancakes on this site, which I absolutely loved. Compared to them, these are just a bit more delicious! They litterally melt in your mouth.they are so fluffy. They really are the perfect pancake. I will still make the other recipe whenever I do not have buttermilk, otherwise, I would make this one. Mixed everything by hand with a whisk, and it came out perfect. So easy. No need for the electric mixer at all.

Wonderful, fluffy pancakes that you can be proud to serve to guests!  I added a splash of vanilla and cooked them in a lightly oiled pan.  It took me two attempts with this recipe to not burn them.  I found the secret for me is to heat the pan/oil on medium and then turn it down a notch when I pour the in batter.  I also turn the cakes when a bit sooner than normal - I don't wait for the entire top to bubble as I do with box mix pancakes.  My brother-in-law is huge fan of cast iron cookware and he said pancakes turn out much better in them.  I didn't have my unused cast iron pan seasoned yet so I will try that next time and see if there is a difference.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I loved these pancakes and so did my children. They were very light and fluffy and I really should have doubled the recipe so that I could freeze some for later in the week. I did make a couple of minor changes. I added some vanilla, replaced refined sugar for natural cane sugar, a couple of tablespoons of flax seed meal disguised with just a few chocolate chips for my children. We served with sliced bananas and sugar free syrup. THEY LOVED THEM!!!

This recipe is the very best (and easiest) for buttermilk pancakes. The buttermilk makes them tender and the pancake is light and fluffy.  It reminds me of IHOP pankcakes.  Delicious!

This turned out GREAT!!  I've been on a quest for "perfect" pancakes for several months now, and after a dozen different recipes, I am very happy with this one.  That said, this was my second attempt at this recipe -- made grevious errors the first time.  I did not use a blender, I wisked by hand and ended up with a thicker batter.  (Really don't want to dirty my blender unless its absolutely necessary.)  I also have not tried the other buttermilk pancakes recipe with rave reviews because it just makes too many pancakes for my family right now -- maybe in a few years.

Darn good. I made a few changes; I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 brown sugar and half white, and about a Tablespoon of Vanilla. I don't have a blender so i mixed dry ingredients in a large bowl and wet ingredients in a separate bowl then mixed them together. Other people said they didn't bubble when ready to turn, but I had put batter in the fridge or 5 minutes and didn't stir before pouring into pan and they bubbled just fine.

I think this is the first recipe I've ever felt the need to review... these pancakes couldn't be simpler or more delicious!  I keep a can of buttermilk powder in the cabinet for occasional recipes that call for buttermilk and it worked perfectly.  Goodbye box mix!

Just made these for dinner (Pancake Tuesday) Soooo Good!  Didn't have buttermilk so I added a tbsp of lemon juice to 1 1/4 cup regular milk and let it stand for a few minutes. Also added a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients.  I put the batter in the fridge for 10 minutes for fluffier pancakes.  I actually don't mind the box version (easy and good) but these were just as simple and very delicious!

Used whole wheat flour instead of white.  Halved the sugar.  Added fresh blackberries.  They turned out great.

Very good pancake recipe!  Probably the best I have tried from this site... they tasted almost just like the IHOP version, so I was impressed.  Not sure if the blender was the best way to go, because all the flour ended up getting caught up at the bottom.  Cut down a little on the oil too (maybe 1/8 c. instead of 1/4c.), but otherwise I kept it the same.  Now, if I could just find some butter pecan syrup....  :)

Very light and fluffy.  I made them into silver dollar pancakes.  I poured the batter into a squirt bottle, enlarged the hole in the bottle, and squeezed dollops of batter onto the pan.

These are SO GOOD. My husband and I make them once a week for dinner. I love them because they are not overly fluffly, and are slightly sweet. They don't even need butter and syrup!!

Totally awesome pancakes!  I was nervous about using the blender for pancakes because I've always heard that you should not overmix them.  I'm not sure how all that chemistry stuff works but I do know that these were definitely tasty pancakes!  Our new family favorite!

I used my mixer and they turned out perfectly....I used the beater attachment, started slow and then ran it around 3-4 for about 30 seconds.  YUMMY.

This was an easy great recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup of the flour for whole wheat flour to make it a little healthier. They turned out great.

This is exactly what I was looking for. It's your classic pancake, very fluffy and delicious. I did add about 2 1/2 Tbsp. sugar instead of the 1/4 cup and they were great. I'd definitely recommend!

I just finished making them 5 minutes ago. My B/F loved them. I was looking for a recipe that was easy to make with the ingredients that I had. I also added vanilla extract into the batter, but other than that they are perfect!!!! Thanks a lot for a great recipe!!!!

These were awesome! I only looked up a recipe for pancakes because I didn't have any mix left in the house and everyone wanted pancakes. These were so fluffy and good that I just may have been converted over to making them from scratch from now on! I actually didn't have any buttemilk so I just used regular milk but added some melted butter to the mix. I also added a couple spoonfuls of icing sugar. This recipe made enough for myself, my husband and 2 kids. Everyone was stuffed and loved them!

Oh, these were absolutely delicious!  They were exactly what I was looking for in a pancake: light, fluffy and just a little sweet.  I changed two things: I only used 1 T. sugar, and cut the baking soda to 1/2 t.  Also, I didn't blend the ingredients.  I whisked together the dry, lightly beat together the wet, and then carefully folded them together just before pouring them on the griddle.  Sooooo good!

I'm not really a pancake person at all, but my husband made these one morning and I love them!  I could eat these pancakes all the time.  We add 1 tsp. Vanilla and about 1/8 tsp. Cinnamon to the recipe.  These are awesome!

This is great.  I doubled the recipe, used half WW flour and added some ground ginger, cinnamon, and vanila.  Even w/ the heavier flour they were still light and fluffy.  This will be my standard recipe

Made these this AM for my husband and he enjoyed them.  I did substitute whole milk and 2 tsps. vinegar (to curdle the milk) in lieu of the buttermilk.  They came out thick, but had a great flavor and texture.  Next time I will thin with more milk.  Otherwise, very delicious!  Thanks for an easy recipe.  Made about 10 thick pancakes.

I completely forgot to add the oil and these pancakes still tasted good! Plus, they were healthier. I thought they tasted a tiny bit heavy, now I know why. I will make these the right way next time, but it's good to know if you leave the oil out they're still yummy.

mmmmm.  I printed this recipe about an hour ago, and they're already done and gone.  I doubled the recipe and it fed 4, but we could have used a few more.  I love the bit of sweetness they have, great for the few of us who don't like syrup.

I tried this recipe this morning, and it was wonderful! Followed the recipe extactly, no changes. The texture and taste are just like I went to the local diner! The best part, is that it really is as easy at it seems. Anyone can make these - for fellow kitchen incompetents: Try This!

Even though the buttermilk II got better ratings I tried this one b/c I didn't have enough ingredients for the other one.  I thought these were really good.  Kids gobbled them up.  I did add a splash of Almond extract.  I usually do this to all pancakes and french toast b/c it adds a little bit extra.

I changed the flour to gluten-free, added about 1/2 cup more after mixing because I wanted them thicker. Used coconut oil instead of Vegetable oil. They were wonderful!

In my first experience with this recipe, I found the ratio of wet to dry ingredients  created much too thick of a  batter for uniform pancakes.   I  ended up thinning with milk.   Next time I would cut the sugar in half, much too sweet.  Great tasting pancakes.

Sweet simple, pancakes. I kept all the ingredients the same. The only thing I did differently was mix with a wire whisk. Yes, they are quite sweet. I would half the sugar next time.

Family loved it! I used less sugar / 2 tablespoons and sifted the flour, sugar, baking powder and soda together.  Came out light and fluffy as air. Differently a keeper.

I was shocked that this recipe goes against all “rules” of making buttermilk pancakes and yet turned out delicious cakes. I made this exactly like the recipe. It made just enough pancakes for four. I still prefer The Buttermilk Pancakes II recipe, but I will keep this one for small, fast batches.

Great Recipe - i always find myself adding stuff - like lemon zest (add with sugar so it distributes the oils and incorporates the lemon flavor and doesn’t clump up), lemon extract (a few drops), vanilla, pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg and used coconut oil/pinch of olive oil (really good stuff) and wow - were these pancakes divine

I only cut it in half for two people, though should have cut it into thirds for ease of division and the quantity needed.  Otherwise it is a perfect, simple, unfussy recipe that was fluffy, delicious and will be made again.  I was tired of boxed mixes, and this is just as easy, tastier.  Of course, its real purpose is being a delivery system for Vermont maple syrup.

They were tasty! They weren’t quite as light and fluffy as I would have liked. Per a suggestion in comments, I did sub 2T of melted butter for the oil and cut the sugar to 2T and added 1t of vanilla.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and added fresh blueberries.  They were light and fluffy but a little flavorless.  I might some vanilla or brown sugar next time.

They were very easy but when eating there was a sharp baking powder flavor. It is very close but needs a little tweaking.

These are good. I can't imagine anyone describing them as light or fluffy, which some have here. They're a toothsome, dense pancake, which I'll use again when I'm hungry for pancakes with molasses. Not my family's favorite but a useful one for me to keep in my toolbox.

Reading over this recipe I was a little hesitant to throw in all my ingredients seeing that there was no salt compared to the amount of sugar it called for. But went ahead with it anyways after reading up the reviews. These pancakes were incredibly bland. Had to spruce them up with added salt and vanilla extract and even then they weren't anything savoury.

The batter as instructed was very thick, so the first two pancakes were globs.  After adding more regular milk it was possible to pour the batter into round pancakes.  I agree they burned easily, but the texture was light and fluffy and it soaked up a lot of maple syrup--yummy.

Made the recipe as is. I make a lot of pancakes for my kids and try lots of different recipes. This was average. I also had a hard time getting them to cook through consistently which is a problem I've never had. My kids ate them, but I'll go back to other recipes on this site.

I made this with whole-wheat flour and brown sugar, so that may be why I had to add so much more liquid to mine. Don't be afraid to adjust. They still turned out to be fabulous. I got 12 6-inch pancakes which is a great yield. Next time I'll double the recipe so I can freeze an extra batch for busy school mornings.

These were a huge hit in my house. They are a bit sweet so I serve with sliced berries and powered sugar instead of syrup.

I have made this recipe a few times and have realized that if I don't use real buttermilk instead of milk I sour with vinegar, the pancakes just don't turn it the same. If you make this right, and add a touch of vanilla they are great. I often make silver dollar pancakes and shake cinnamon sugar on them and take them as a snack to soccer games for the kids! They love them.

Here's how I turned these pancakes into dinner:  chop and saute 1/3 of a large zucchini, 1/4 of an orange bell pepper, and a few cloves of garlic until well cooked.  Stir these veggies into the buttermilk pancake mix, add s/p to taste.  Cook pancakes as usual and serve with slices of avocado and salsa...yum!

I have a similar recipe to this that I have used for years and years.  The only difference is that, in addition to the buttermilk, I also add about 1/4 cup regular whole milk.  I made these this morning and remember now why I love and adore this recipe for buttermilk pancakes!

Excellent!!!  I used to use store bought pancake mix, but not anymore! These taste just like Cracker Barrel pancakes!  Only addition I made was a little bit of almond extract. I also doubled the recipe so I would have leftovers.  So glad I found this recipe!

I've made these several times, and my family loves them.  I never read the directions (only ingredients) until today.  I just hand mix them...  Also, I've recently starting substituting half of the flour with whole wheat flour.

Omg loved these pancakes.... Way better than recipe #II.....  Added less than top of lemon juice to allow the citrus blend w mixture as I've read on other reviews. If u let mixture sit omg u will get sum real fluffy pancakes.... I loved it.... I topped it off w a bit of strawberry fruit spread n a bit of syrup.... Delicious... Will continue using this recipe from now on rather than box mix or any other recipe.....

I love this recipe. My husband hates box recipe pancakes and I can only get him to eat these. I did make a few changes. I did not add the oil. Instead I added it to the pan as I cooked them. I also typically make my own buttermilk (one Tbsp of vinegar or lemon juice for ever cup of milk. I did not use a blender; I did not see the point so I mixed it by hand. I added some vanilla extract and they turned out wonderfully!

The only complaint I have is the estimated serving size!  It says "serves 4-5".  The entire batch was easily consumed by a 6-year old, 2-year old, and me.  Guess that's actually a pretty high compliment...

Great pancakes.  We subbed honey for sugar and cut back on the buttermilk a tiny bit to compensate for the liquid, also subbing 3T melted butter for the oil, used a blender to mix as suggested.  Batter very thick and creamy.  Also added a few blueberries to each 'cake once poured in the pan.   Very light and fluffy, and delicious with maple syrup.

Lessen the amount of sugar, possibly add some vanilla, then mix the mixture by hand, rather than puree or blend, and these would be better.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I split the flour 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all-purpose, added a 1/4 tsp of salt and my son, 6, devoured 3 medium sized pancakes alone. Wow!  I think I will try the vanilla or almond extract next time.  One the first time, I think these were the best pancakes I have ever made, and I have been making pancakes for 25 years!  It's simple, and nearly fool-proof.

Great recipe! I added a pinch of salt and a tsp or almond extract (I was out of vanilla or I would have used that) I also added some crumbled bacon and butterscotch chips to the batter which made them incredible!! The kids loved them!

PERFECT PANCAKES! This is the exact recipe for IHOP pancakes except theirs calls for a 'heaping' tsp of baking powder and a 'heaping' tsp of baking soda. Very light and fluffy. I had to turn burner to medium low as they will burn quickly. This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Simple and easy to put together. You can always tell a good pancake recipe when you can eat them plain and they're good :-) I added 1/4 tsp vanilla extract.  We'll be making this my basic recipe from now on. -Em

Easy to make and the Fluffiest, Lightest Pancakes EVER...with a wonderful almost lemony flavor from the buttermilk.  They soak up the maple syrup and butter perfectly, while still dissolving in your mouth deliciously!! I made these for my sister's family yesterday and they were a huge hit!  They love to go out to breakfast, which can be $30-$40, so it's a win to find a recipe that rivals their fave breakfast places for under $5-6 total.  My little nephew said, "These pancakes are HEAVEN! I like them better than [his favorite local diner]!"  I doubled the recipe and saved the leftover batter, which I cooked up this morning.  Pancakes were still delicious, but a bit denser possibly because batter was cold. Next time I will allow leftover batter to come to room temp before cooking.

I followed this recipe exactly but tweaked it a little to add some flavor.  I always add cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to my pancake batters and it has always been a favorite of my family.  However, I have never had pancakes come out so perfect and fluffy like these did!  It was my first time making buttermilk pancakes and I can't believe what a difference it makes versus pancakes without buttermilk.  I highly recommend this recipe, but add some spices to give it a nice, subtle flavor.

Very mediocre.  Flat and not particularly "rich" tasting, despite the buttermilk.  Won't make again.

fast and easy, subbed  brown sugar for white, butter for veg oil and added some vanilla and cinnamon. Sweet enough w/o syrup, but the kids love to dunk them in syrup. Thanks for the recipe.

These were great! i accidently added a TON of vanilla so they tasted like a cupcake...not a bad mistake! = ) and because i thought the sugar was too much i only added half the amount. The buttermilk makes these so light and fluffy!
I love this!

This recipe is so easy that I make it all the time. My 13 yo says I can make them every day if I want to. I don't care for vegetable oil so I melt butter and us that instead and I mix all the dry first then mix all the wet, then blend them together. I'm sure it's easier if I just follow the directions, but my method wasn't broken so I'm not inclined to fix it.

Very filling. I modified a bit because I never have buttermilk on hand. I used 1 cup of plain yogurt and a 1/2 cup of milk with a touch of vanilla and a bit less sugar than indicated.

I made a double batch of this recipe with half of the sugar called for and it was still quite sweet.  They cook up quite fluffy, so I recommend making smaller sized pancakes, as none of us could finish my standard 8" ones except for the ravenous teenager!  I also noticed that these had to be cooked at a lower heat (med-low instead of medium on an electric range) Overall, a great recipe, if you reduce the sugar.  Next time I'd definitely add vanilla as well.  Thanks LEEMA!

Excellent, easy recipe.  I deleted all of the sugar, and used whole wheat flour to "healthy it up" a bit.  And dropped in fresh blueberries, of course.  Very light and delicious!

They were a little to thin for my husband's liking so I added just a tad more flour... but they were excellent!

I can't even say how my much family loved these.  I had leftover buttermilk to use, so I picked out this recipe.  They were so easy to whip up, I will definately be making these again.

I just have to say; this is my go to recipe for buttermilk pancakes.  I think that ultimately I chose this for the ease.  The family LOVED them!!  I used a different recipe today (not sure why) and I wasn't thrilled.  IMO, this is the best!!!!  Thank you for sharing

Over the past few months I have made at least 10 or more pancake recipes, and this one is by far my favorite. It is now my official recipe for pancakes

Light, fluffy, tasty....a win. I just used a fork (like grandma used to do -- in fact, the reviewer whose pancakes went "flat" probably overmixed it -- a danger of blenders). I did the traditional: mix liquids in one bowl, dry in another and then dumped the dry into the liquid. I did it for 1 person, used whole wheat for the extra TBS of flour which gave it a nice texture and look (and made me feel healthier!). Since a single serving called for 1/4 egg, I just turned the rest of the egg mixture into scrambled eggs. Great way for a singleton to get pancakes for breakfast.

Simple and perfect.  I did not alter the ingredients at all, but instead of blending in a traditional blender, I used an immersion blender. This worked perfectly, and it seemed to resolve the issue one reviewer mentioned regarding dry ingredients settling. Also, I noticed that, as other reviewers mentioned, these tried to cook more quickly than I expected. It was easily rectified, though, by simply keeping the heat two notches below medium and by flipping the pancakes after bubbles formed but before the bubbles burst.  This recipe made 8 5-inch pancakes for me.

I was looking for a buttermilk pancake recipe with one egg to spare so I picked this one and I'm glad I did. Very simple recipe but delicious results. Used a wisk. The batter will look thick but go with it because you are in for a treat. These pancakes are what you'd expect at your favorite diner. Thank you for sharing. Perfect!

My WHOLE family loved these pancakes.  We all decided they were better than our two favorite pancake restaurants.  Mine turned out crunchy on the edges - almost candied - with a delicious, perfect center.  I followed the instructions to the letter.  No changes were needed for this to be a 5-star rating.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe as is, except using brown sugar instead of white. I also added some thawed frozen blueberries. Sinful with warm real maple syrup on top.

These were great pancakes!  I thought the batter looked a little thick but when I cooked them the batter really spread out and the pancakes were so light and fluffy.  I didn't use a blender to mix, I just mixed all the ingredients with a whisk in a bowl.  And I folded in some frozen blueberries. Thanks for the great recipe!

lovely, fluffy pancakes, but I'm not sure about mixing all ingredients in a blender. Perhaps if you put the liquid ingredients on the bottom, you would get better results than I had. I ended up with a mess that I had to stir with a spoon in the blender to combine the ingredients smoothly.

These pancakes are the best! Light, fluffy and delicious! I doubled the recipe (extras freeze and reheat beautifully), used a hand mixer in place of a blender to mix, and cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup (was supposed to be 1/2 cup because recipe was doubled) they were perfect!! My husband had 2 great big stacks and deemed this recipe a 'definite keeper!' I do agree with one other review I read, though - cook these on low heat, as they tend to brown quickly. Enjoy!

We thought these were delicious. Very fluffy.  I did use cake flour which may have contributed to the lightness and also added some vanilla and toasted pecans.  I will use this again when my son comes to visit.  He will love them.  Next time I may add bananas or blueberries.

This is a great recipe for pancakes.  I substituted 3/4  cup plain yogurt and 1/2 cup milk mixed together, for the buttermilk, which was a more than acceptable modification (and one I got from a Cook's Illustrated video). I used my hand blender to mix the batter, and then folded in 1/4 cup chopped fresh strawberries, which added a tasty flavour. Thanks for the recipe, Leema.

Excellent!  Light and fluffy, but still strong enough to hold together and not turn crumbly in syrup.  Also quite filling!

Blows Bisquick away!  Kids have eaten them for two straight meals!  Only slght change to the recipe based on family preferences and size.  Increased recipe to 12 servings, added a capful of vanilla, and used a full 32 oz buttermilk to make batter a little thinner.  Best pancakes I have had in a home ever!

Simple recipe produces fluffy textured cakes.  Replacing the oil with butter would taste even better. *Update: Used half butter and half oil; palm full of wheat germ, sprinkle of cinnamon, pinch of salt and drizzle of vanilla...the best!

This is now my go-to pancake recipe.  It's fantastic and the pancakes really are light and fluffy.  I tried leaving out the baking powder once and it changed the flavor and composition too much.  Pour in a bit of batter and shake the griddle to thin them out in the pan and you shouldn't have too much trouble with them cooking all the way through.

Finally homemade pancakes that my kids LOVE! Thank you so much for posting this. Next time I will eliminate baking powder. The pancakes were difficult to cook thru as they would rise so high. The taste, however, is perfection!

I'm not going to lie-- I really didn't like these pancakes. They weren't nearly as good as some of the other basic pancake recipes on this site that use only milk. Convenient when all I had in the house was buttermilk, but I won't be making again.

I have made this as written several times. LOVE IT! We make smaller pancakes, and 1 batch feeds our family of 4 just fine. May need to double when my 6 & * year olds get older, but it works for now! I also have made this with real buttermilk and the "homemade" one with lemon juice and milk. Get real buttermilk. It works with the other, but there is just something about the real buttermilk that makes this soooo good!

These were very good. And they were easy. I was leery* of the blender, but they turned out great. I just waited a minutes or two before I poured the batter on the skillet because it was very bubbly. I made them Easter morning. I hoped for them to be fluffier. But they were still yummy. I did not have buttermilk though, so I had to substitute with skim milk. I used the same amount that it called for the buttermilk -1 1/4 cup. That could have made a difference in the texture. But over all it was really good. I also added a tspn of vanilla. My boyfriend kept going "mmmm" after his bites. So I'm thinking I will be making them again soon. :D Thanks for the recipe.

These pancakes are so fluffy and so good!  They are the first pancakes I have NOT somehow wrestled with or had to adjust in some way to get it to work.  Just follow the recipe and you're good.  I would probably add a pinch of salt, but otherwise, these are a keeper in our kitchen.

I was always taught that pancake ingredients should be gently mixed together, so I was really amazed that the blender method would turn out such wonderful fluffy pancakes.  My favourite pancake recipe from now on.

These pancakes turned out delicious! I followed the recipe ingredients exactly plus added a pinch of salt and dashes of cinnamon and vanilla extract.  I used a 1/4 cup measuring scoop to ladle out my batter and it yielded about 12 pancakes.

Very good, I did add a little bit more sugar and buttermilk, since I like my pancakes sweet. I also don't cook them that long, so that they keep soft...

This is the recipe to try if you want real buttermilk pancakes.  This recipe could rate higher than 5 - no doubt about it!  Fresh buttermilk or the vinegar/milk version will work...just try them - you will not want to use a mix ever again!

Very good pancakes. I have made this recipe with whole wheat flour and another time I made with a blend of both regular flour and whole wheat, and I think that they tasted better when I used both flours. I also added some vanilla extract and used less sugar.

These were so easy to make and so delicious.  Very light and fluffy.  Half way through eating them, my husband (whom doesn't comment on anything I cook) perked up and said "these pancakes are REALLY good!"  That made my day!  Plus, the ease of making them made it so much better.

excellent recipe. was looking for a homemade recipe and tried quite a few since the boxed kind have expiry dates. never knew.  I just added a tsp of salt and a tbsp of milk(just so they spread easier) and let the mix sit for 5 minutes and cook.  they are just like the pancakes at IHOP. thanks for a great recipe and so easy too. yogi

These were great pancakes! And easier than making the boxed pancake mix!  I did not have a blender, so I just whisked the ingredients by hand and they turned out wonderful!  This was my first attempt at homemade pancakes and I will make these again and again-VERY EASY and much more yummy than the boxed mix.  My family was very impressed!

These are super fluffy and delicious.  They remind me of the consistency of a pancake mix, only without the stale, boxy taste.  Plus, they are just as easy.  I love making them in the blender.

My family loves these pancakes! I use much less oil(1/2-1 tsp.) and they come out very fluffy and light. I also use powdered sugar and add vanilla(1 tbsp.) and they just love them! They're great with fruit, and my kids eat whatever might be leftover all by themselves!! They're amazing!

These were pretty good.  I followed another user's recommendation to cut the sugar in half, and add a pinch of salt.  However, I think it would have been better with 2-3 pinches of salt.  I also added a few handfulls of pecans.  Oh, and after the first couple of pancakes, I added a few spoonfuls of flour.  The first 2 tasted just fine, but they were excessively runny when pouring them into the pan.  I had to cut them apart with my spatula before I could flip them.  Overall, a tasty recipe though!

All I can say is that I am SO greatful for this recipe!  We can't buy boxed "baking mix" here, so I was forced to find a recipe like this one.  Even if/when we move back to the states, I will still make my pancakes using this recipe.  Now, if I could only get REAL maple syrup here!!  (Have to use  imitation maple extract and make a "mock" maple syrup!  Oh well, it's better than nothing, right?!!)

I love pancakes but have never been able to make them the way they are at restaurants.  This recipe is great and easy and much better than those I've had at restaurants. I used the recommendtions and added vanilla.  Great.

WOW! So yummy! These seriously taste like something you would get at a breakfast place. Delish. I did add a little extra buttermilk to thin out the batter, but other than that, my stand mixer whipped these babies right up. I will never again buy the stuff from the store.

Very tasty and quite easy.  Made some with chocolate chips and some plain.  Both were excellent.
I used 3/4 plain yogurt and 1/4 milk instead of buttermilk.  They turned out fluffy and sweet.  I will definitely make these again.

I made these pancakes with my EFL class in South Korea - they were great!  I taught them to make buttermilk using vinegar and milk . . . which was totally new to them.  I will use this recipe whenever making pancakes!

This is a really easy recipe to remember and make.  I put the dry and wet ingredients alternately.  And I waited until I saw bubbles to turn the pancake over for a light golden color.

Without a doubt, this recipe is much better than any premixed packaged concoction I have ever tried (and even most homemade varieties too). Light and fluffy, excellent with whipped cream and fresh berries.

These were good but I felt like they could have been fluffier. I added almond extract. My kids loved the sweet taste of the pancakes. The pancakes did make bubbles as they cooked. I let the batter sit on the counter while I prepared the rest of breakfast. I may make again but will look for other recipes.

Excellent!  I was looking for a blueberry pancake recipe and decided to try basic pancake and add the blueberries.  They were delicious.  I did add a little more buttermilk to the batter to get the consistency a little more pourable.  I put a handful of fresh blueberries in the batter and pureed; then added another handful of berries before grilling them.  They were light and very good.

this recipe was yummmy.
I used brown sugar and vanilla
along with a touch of cinnamon and loads of chocolate chips

I don't usually like pancakes because they are too heavy
but these weren't too heavy
they tasted very healthy

I put butter on top
I definitly enjoyed them
and will gladly make these again

maybe it was something I did but for some reason these did not turn out very good for me.... the batter was runny and the cakes turned out very chewy
blender thing DID NOT work out well for me I had to mix it most of the way by hand I even added extra flour to thicken it up some but it did not work 
I will keep playing with it though maybe next time they will turn out better.

These are the best pancakes I have ever made!!  They are so light, they just melt in your mouth.  I wish I could alter the recipe to be a little more figure friendly though.  Oh well, sometimes you just have to splurge!  No more bisquick for me!

These were great!  I had a bit of trouble telling when to turn them...they didn't "bubble" like my old recipe.  Also, I used dehydrated buttermilk and they were good.  I didn't use a blender.  I just mixed by hand til the lumps were gone.

We always add blueberries in season and serve with maple syrup.  I use a cast iron skillet as it seems to add an extra dimension to the flavor.

Followed this recipe exactly except I didn't have baking powder. It didn't matter at all. It still came out absolutely delicious!
Put some butter and warm honey on top and everyone loved this breakfast.
It is a keeper! Thanks Amber!

I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I substituted sour milk. It turned out excellent. I cooked in a non stick pan and didn't have any trouble with them sticking. These were amazing, soooo tasty I'll never use a store bought mix again.

These are awesome pancakes!  I did not have vanilla as some people suggested adding it, but I was worried about using the oil instead of butter. So I used butter flavored extract instead, about a teaspoon and added just a pinch of salt.  My kids loved these and I loved these!  My son doesn't usually like pancakes and he had seconds.

I was looking for a 5 star recipe for pancakes and chose this one because it looked easiest.  I did add another 1/4 cup of flour because the batter was too thin, and I used buttermilk powder instead of buttermilk.  It was just what I was looking for - very, very easy and very light, tender and delicious.

I love these pancakes, very basic but so delicious!  My family is very big on pancakes and I've searched for just the right one...finally it's here!  We all ooo'd and ahhh'd as we ate them!  Perfect!!  I did make the following substitutions : 3/4 c all-purpose flour 1/2 c whole wheat flour, instead of buttermilk - I used skim with 1 TBSP lemon juice, brown sugar instead of white, & butter instead of oil.  Also I didn't use a blender but rather mixed all the dry ingredients then cut in the butter with a pastry blender and added the milk/lemon juice mixture.  Perfect!!!!  Thank you!

We are waffle people, but these were very good pancakes!  I was out of white sugar, so I used brown, but my family likes sweet pancakes anyway.  Thank you for the recipe, we will use it again!

Very good. I did cut back on the sugar as some of the reviewers suggested and added a little vanilla. Husband said these were some of the best pancakes I've made.

Followed the recipe but used 1.5 tablespoons of vinegar added to the milk as a substitute for buttermilk. I also omitted all of the oil -- and it was still fantastic. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the batter is a bit runny, but the pancakes come out very nice and soft, yet firm. Definitely use the blender -- the batter is smooth as a result, versus lumpy when mixed by hand. 

I've tried dozens of recipes and this one is fool-proof!

These pancakes are terrific. They were a bit runny so I added another large tablespoon of flour and that seemed to do the trick. I added blueberries, too. Yummy!

The flavor is great.  The batter is runny...next time I'll try just 1c of buttermilk.  Tip - to make buttermilk put 1tbsp of white vinegar in milk to make 1c.

Yummy and quick and easy to make.  The only change I made was to add a pinch of salt, and I didn't use a blender, just mixed the dry ingredients then added the wet ingredients.  Even my Husband, who is (in his own words) "not a pancake person" (probably due to the fact that when his Sister made them for him as a child they literally ended up being used as frisbees) liked these.

All I can say is AWESOME!!!  This is a keeper, I never have to try another pancake recipe again.  I added some vanilla extract to the recipe, and didn't use a blender to mix.  I just used a whisk to blend.  Great with blueberries too!

I can not say enought good thinks about this recipe! Every pancake I have ever touched at any time on it's way to the pan has ended up a complete disaster. I even ruined my mothers, and she's been making them for years. But this are simply wonderful. I will recommend them to everybody. Try them!

I have tried this recipe twice this week for my 4 year old who was craving pancakes.  She and I both loved them!  The only problem I had was that the batter was too thin both times and I ended up adding about 1/4 cup more flour to thicken it up.  After I did that, these were absolutely wonderful!!  I didn't have any buttemilk so I added 2 teaspoons of white vinegar to the milk and these tasted just like buttermilk pancakes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These pancakes are very easy to prepare, and quite light, with a nice texture. My 3 year old *loved* them.  I thought they were wayyyy too sweet - not bad by themselves, but with syrup, it was major sugar overload!  I will make them again, but just cut way down on the sugar amount.  I doubled the recipe and made 30 pancakes.

these are the best pancake recipies, ever. and i've tried a lot. it's perfectly fluffly and yet not feathery light either. it has just a bit of chewiness (barely, really, but just enough to linger in my mouth a moment longer than just gulping it down) and crispy (i cook it in extra virgin olive oil). when i first tried them, i loved them so much that my husband and i ate it for dinner three nights in a row. seriously addictive, and incredibly easy to boot! up until this recipe, i stuck by nigella lawson's pancake recipe, but amber's has taken the top spot! thanks for sharing your recipe!

Now THOSE were some good pancakes!  I've been unsuccessful with a previous buttermilk pancake recipe, but this one is divine!  They are so, so easy to make - even if you've got a limited amount of time, these really are fast in the blender.  They fluff up wonderfully and really suck up any butter you spread on them!  I added a teaspoon of Madagascar vanilla for a little something extra.  Definitely recommended!

I made these this past weekend for my boyfriend and my roommate and they loved them.  They kept commenting on how light and fluffy they were.  My boyfriend even wanted more for dinner!  The only problem I had with them is that the blending got a little messy and at first things were not blending completely, but I finally got it together and they came out great.

I've searched high and low for years to find a pancake recipe similar to what is served in  restaurants (pancakes are thin, but still fluffy)...this is just what I was looking for.  Thanks for sharing it!

I felt like the amount of sugar in this recipe was great. Because I don't like to drown my pancakes in syrup the sweetness of the pancakes were a nice balance.  Light texture.  Very good.

Nice, light pancakes with a wonderful flavour! DH had them with just butter and for a picky man, he's in heaven. Kids enjoyed them too. I didn't measure how much buttermilk I put in, and doubled the recipe.

The pancakes came out ok, it seem as if was missing something, the taste was a little plain. I will try it again maybe I will add something to it. Thanks for the recipe

My husband & I loved these pancakes.  They are like the ones you get in a restaurant.

Delicious. I'll never use baking mix again for pancakes. Great way to use up buttermilk. I put all ingredients in a big glass measuring cup and blended with a stick blender, and poured onto griddle.

Very good pancakes -- light, fluffy, and tasty.  I didn't know buttermilk made such a difference!  However, doubling the recipe will NOT fit in a blender!  I shouldn't have doubled it.  The original recipe made plenty.
