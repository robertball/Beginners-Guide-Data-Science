It was a split decision- those of us who like squash really liked this casserole, the ones who didn't- not so much.  I think the texture was nice, and the flavor was great.

My whole family loved this casserole even my young grandkids.  I added garlic and extra and onions and some zucchini squash.  I have made this 4X now and the opinion of my family is this is the best casserole of all the squash I have cooked.Also added extra cheddar cheese and whipped it with a mixer. My vote is a 5 star.  SK from Tn.

Decreasing the milk from the original 2/3 can to 1/2 can improved the consistency .
