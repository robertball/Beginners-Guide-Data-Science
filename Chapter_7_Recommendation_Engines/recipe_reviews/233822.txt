Over all this recipe is fantastic!  I didn't have any almond mild so I substituted vodka.  I wasn't sure about the strawberries so I used limes.  I didn't have any honey so I added some gin.  Since I didn't have any chia left I used ice cubes to help it set up quicker.  Boy, once I mixed all the ingredients and poured it over the ice, it was ready to go.  I enjoyed it so much that I took it to the work potluck.  My co=workers could not believe this was chia pudding.  It was a hit!

I really enjoyed this and the versatility to experiment with different fruit and extract combos. I pureed the milk and strawberries first, then added in the rest of the ingredients and gave the blender a quick pulse. After refrigerating for about an hour, I gave the pudding a quick stir to prevent clumping. It set up nicely. I made it in the evening for the following day's breakfast. The only slight deviation from the recipe was to use coconut/almond milk blend.  Very tasty and healthy.

Perfect!  Very easy.  Would not change a thing.  Although, an alternative preparation I have done is to use 1 c almond milk, and 1 c vanilla Greek yogurt.  Great either way.  My daughter loves this, too. She will even choose this over ice cream!!  Also, after preparing this, I like to divide it into pint size jars to sit overnight.  Perfect for grabbing quickly in the morning on my way out the door.  May have to stir a bit when you open and eat.

Some might call this dessert, but I call it breakfast with my probiotics and any fruit handy and fresh.  Excellent!

Have been making chia pudding for some time now and I liked the idea of adding the puréed fruit for a nice change. I didn't add the honey or vanilla because I used the sweetened vanilla almond milk I had on hand. Love to have a bit for breakfast! It's important to stir this a couple times in the first 30-45 minutes or the seeds will settle and you will have a thick base with liquid still sitting on the top. I like to make a big batch in the evening and let it sit over night, it will last a couple days.

This is an easy, delicious way to enjoy chia seeds. I let mine sit overnight, covered in the fridge and it gets even thicker this way. But it will never be the exact consistency of pudding. It has its own unique and wonderful consistency that is more in line with tapioca. I love it!!

Just made this recipe and loved it.  Substituted 1 tbs agave for a lighter sweetening.  Used strawberries and bananas in almond milk~ came out great!  Added fresh cut strawberries to top it off ;)

Super easy to make. I divided it into 16 small dessert cups, and that way it only amounts to 60cal. per cup! Makes a great snack if you are on a diet. thanks for uploading!

Overall, the finished product tastes good - but mine never set and turned out with the consistency of a smoothie, not pudding.  I did use ground chia seeds instead of whole- that could have been the issue.  However, I did research online substituting ground for whole and apparently it should have worked.

This one is a keeper! Reminds me of strawberry soup! Prepared it as shown but added coconut flakes on top.  I used for breakfast but makes a great dessert!

I love this simple and easy recipe. I doubled the amount of chia seeds that I used because it looked as if the results would be too liquidy and I am glad I did.  Amazing breakfast.

This was my first Chia Pudding and I'm hooked!  I'm always looking for good-for-you recipes that taste so good you might crave them and this falls in that category. The only change I made was to use organic unsweetened soy milk, because that is what I had on hand. I'm guessing any form of milk would work.  Thanks for posting, Lucky!

Great way sea I'm experimenting with different berry combos to see if I can get more flavor to come through, maybe I will mix it with the Greek yogurt as someone else suggested. I've found that chia pudding in general isn't very flavorful so I topped mine with some puréed fruit as well and my 6 year old loved it.

Quick and easy. Taste is nice but as others mine didn't set and was more like a smoothie consistency even after been overnight in the fridge. So I decided to add 1tsp of agar agar dissolved in 250ml of hot water, mixed well in the "smoothie" and back in  the fridge to set. Voila. My pudding was done. Next time I will dissolve the agar agar in the milk to keep the flavor stronger.

I'm new to trying to eat healthy.  The first time I made it I mistakingly bought sweetened Almond milk so just didn't add honey. I used ground chia seeds.  As others suggested, I stirred it after an hour and again about 3 hours later.  It had a very good flavor.  Like a thin pudding.

2nd time I made it, I made as directed except added sugar to taste and used whole chia seeds.  I did also stir a couple of time to distribute chia.

Flavor very good.  Easy. Expect a thinner than pudding consistency.

Just like other reviewers stated, this did not set. I was disappointed since I have made a few Chia seed puddings with great results. The taste was ok but it was more like a smoothie than a pudding.

This is really good! I also tried making this with mangoes and coconut milk (coz coconut and mango is a yummy combo) but still followed the measurements. I sweetened the mix with coco sugar and lessened the vanilla. Sooo good! This makes a whole lot so best to half the recipe if you're making it for just yourself.

I made this twice- and it didn't set either time.  I've tried to find something to indicate why this would be but I don't see where I made any mistakes in preparation.  I know it is supposed to be thinner than pudding but this just amounts to a slightly thicker liquid.  While the taste was good, and we eventually used it over ice cream so it wouldn't be wasted, it definitely wasn't the pudding I was hoping for.

I love it! I did use frozen berries instead of fresh, which I won't do next time.  I think the thickness was affected. It came together really well could use a bit more sweetness though. ??

I followed directions exactly as written. Although I think it tastes great and I'll eat it regardless, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't thicker, as it looks in the photo.  I might try a half cup less milk next time to see if that gives it a more "pudding" consistency.  I've tried other chia pudding recipes and it's the same thing, I was hoping this one would be different. I wonder if adding a little gelatin would help?

Made it with almond milk as per recipe, did not care for the almond milk flavor and will try it with another milk in the future. Otherwise, the pudding was good, perfect texture and pleasant strawberry taste.

I made it per the recipe using a berry blend. It was a little bland for me. I think it may have been the berry blend. I will keep it vanilla or strawberry next time.

We enjoyed this. I made it the night before and then we ate it for breakfast. I was actually surprised that my husband enjoyed it also.

This is easy to make, but not as flavorful as I would have liked. I added a whole bunch of extra sliced strawberries on top and pecans, and that kicked it up a notch. Maybe I am just used to more sweetness. Neither of my kids liked it for that same reason.
