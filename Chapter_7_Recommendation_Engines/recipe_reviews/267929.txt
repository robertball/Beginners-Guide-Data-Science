I made the recipe exactly as is.   I did not have trouble with them swimming in  grease or falling apart as another reviewer stated.  They had pretty good flavor, I used a spicy italian sausage.   I rolled the balls in parmesan before I backed them which gave them a a nice thin crispy coating.  Over all this was a good recipe.  I am going to try them on keto pizza with a little diced pepperoni added in.

Very easy to make, super delicious. Follow the recipe to the teeth and because I use a rack the grease drained and they were not oilly or grease at all. I can taste the cheese, and loving it. It can easily be use as a main dish or appetizer. I recommend this recipe.

These are the ugliest sausage balls I have ever made! They were easy to roll but once baked they did not hold their shape very well. They were extremely greasy and when I tried to roll them or blot the top to remove all the grease, they would start falling apart. The parmesan cheese overpowers all other flavors and the cream cheese makes them a bit too creamy. Overall, we really did not care for these.

I made these sausage balls tonight and they were gone fast!  I even had friends asking for the recipe.  I made them with regular Jimmy Dean natural sausage, maybe a bit more than 1/2 c. sharp cheese because I like it so much.  I splurged and bought some really great shredded Parmesan cheese.  They were a little sticky when rolling them into balls.  I think they needed to cook a little longer than 35 minutes, but I live at altitude so I blame some of that on where I live.  
Super yummy!!  I will make these again.

They were very greasy and were lacking in flavor. They weren't horrible but definitely not the star of the show.

Added Italian Seasoning & red pepper flakes, then rolled them in Italian bread crumbs ( not keto)  before baking... disappeared off the table! Double/triple next time.

Oh my word!  These are so good!  The last Keto sausage cheese ball recipe I tried had almond or coconut flour in them which seemed to leave them tasting a little bland.  These are anything but!  Will definitely add these to the recipe rotation!

These were easy and quick. Would make a great appetizer. I used Italian pork sausage and they had a tiny kick. Will make them again.

Followed recipe exactly they came out perfect. Not greasy at all and held the shape. They were delicious, will definitely be making again. I did make ahead and refrigerated them for a couple of hours before baking them on a rack over cookie sheet lined with foil.

A little rich coming right out of the oven. Recommend siding it with something light like celery. 

Very impressed with how they turned out and how easy it was to make even for meatballs.
