Great recipe! Used 1 box cake mix, 1 stick butter and 2 eggs with electric mixer. How easy is that? 1 level tablespoon for each cookie, 10 min. Each one perfect and the same size. Yummy!

I have made these cookies twice, once with devils food cake and once with spice cake.  Both were very yummy but my family and friends liked the ones made with spice cake and cream cheese frosting better.  I will definatly be making them again!

I didn't quite love these.  I think they were just way too sweet and I tend to like things sweet.  If you do make them, I filled a large plastic bag with the frosting and then turned over half of them and lined them up.  I then piped in a large glob of frosting on each and then used the remaining cookies to top them.  I'm sure it saved a ton of time to do it this way and piping the icing was way faster than if I would have tried to scoop it in.

I have been making these cookies for years now and always receive requests for the recipe.  Not only are they so easy to make, they are also so easy to travel with-- especially when frozen first.  In the summer time we will use our favorite flavors of ice cream in lieu of the frosting!

Fabulous cookies.  Everywhere we take these cookies they are the first to disappear.  The cookies don't need very much icing between them to sweeten them up.  These are so easy to make that my oldest daughter (age 10) was able to make them herself for a bake sale fundraiser.  I would guess that they would freeze well, but they never last that long at our house even when I double the recipe.  Also, as a time saver I use prepared cream cheese icing.  One container of icing is sufficient for a double batch of cookies.  Thanks so much to John for the best cookie recipe ever!!  PS  These cookies are even better than oreos.

I took these cookies to our annual "Cookie Day Competition" at work and won the grand prize.  It makes a HUGE batch of cookies.  Don't skimp on the frosting.   Store them in the fridge so the icing stays firm & the cookies stay cold, chewy & wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Excellent & different. I used the cream cheese recipe called for in the cookie recipe and was delighted. I only made about half the cookie batter and froze the rest. It makes a very large batch- good for bake sales!

This recipe is very good.   My family started eating the cookies before they were put together with the filling.  I used a different filling.  I am looking forward to trying this recipe with other flavors of cake mix and fillings.  Oh by the way, I mixed mine with a hand mixer and they turned out great and was easier than the pastry blender.

I made these today with my kids - super easy and super yummy!!  A no fail recipe!!  They would be great with whipped white frosting in a can too.  We will definitely be making these again.  My only advice would be to make sure you make the cookies no bigger than quarter sized.  They spread out a lot.  This makes a lot of cookies!!

This recipe deserves 5 stars because it is so easy and worked just as it was written. I live in Guatemala and haven't seen shortening at any store yet, so I substituted vegetable oil (it is much easier to measure) and added 1/2 cup flour to get the dough to the right consistency. I also flavored my can of frosting with about 2 tbsp. of Kahlua. Now that's a cookie to die for!

definitely soft, just the way I like it. followed the recipe to a T, without making them sandwiches but added the pecans. Because we love nuts, and the cookies are really soft (almost fluffy because of the cake mix), so I might've added more pecans. Love them! thanks!

whoo hoo these were so good and easy, I mixed marshmallows with a little butter-as for rice krispie squares. Melted the marshmallows and spread on one cookie, then put cream cheese on the other -delicious! Second time around I made these adding  sliced almonds and almond flav to the marshmallow filling

These are super easy cookies!  I didn't like them made with devil's food cake mix, but they were really good using spice cake mix.

So tasty!  I've found that the best frosting for these is just fluffy vanilla store-bought frosting!  I made frosting from scratch for these today (didn't have store-bought on hand), and I prefer the store-bought frosting for them.  It tastes more like oreo filling than buttercream frosting does.

Excellent!  I made these for a potluck dinner and they disappeared quickly.  There were none left to take home.  Mine were kind of puffy so as they were cooling I flattened them with a spatula.  I used a peanut butter frosting recipe I found on this site for the filling.

My 2 year old and I went into a sandwich cookie frenzy and tried devil's food, red velvet, and lemon cake mixes. All turned out delicious however, VERY sweet when you add the cream cheese frosting.  They were simple enough to make so that I could get my daughter in on the fun but way too sweet for my liking.

I made the whole batch, thinking the extra would last...they did not!  So good!!!  I did not have shortening, so I used a stick of butter and 2 eggs.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II by Janni on this site, which is nice and creamy and not too sweet.

I thought the cookies were way too dry and crumbly. I was expecting a more chocolate tasting cookie. I really did not care for the frosting because not compliment the bland cookies at all. I was expecting something a lot more sweet than this frosting. May try again with a different filling mixture.

Yummy! Yummy! I used buttercream for the middles and they were perfect! Make sure you follow the directions on the bake time. The cookies will not be done when you take them out of the oven but will continue baking while on the pan.

This recipe is so good.  I used a yellow butter cake mix (cause I didn't have chocolate) and Chocolate Butter Cream II.  They tasted just like Lofthouse cookies.  I would sincerely suggest making the cookies small because they are VERY sweet this way.

I just finished making these cookies: YUM! I mixed the cookies using my food processor-- it took no time at all & no mess! I used 1 pkg of devils food cake & 1 pkg of chocolate fudge cake mix. I cooked the first batch at 350 for 10 minutes & they actually BURNED while sitting on the cookie sheet. So the next round: I turn the oven down to 325 & cooked for 8 minutes & let them sit for 2 minutes on the cookie sheet. This produced PERFECT, moist cookies! I used the whipped DH packaged vanilla frosting. YUM YUM YUM!

Soooo Good! I only made a half batch (only had 1 box), and canned frosting. I made small cookies and put the frosting in a ziploc bag, cut the corner off and put a dab on top of each cookie instead of sandwiches, YUM and easy!

Five stars for ease & taste! So good! I had cake mix and frosting, but cake just wasn't going to cut it. These were SO easy! I halved the recipe, and used a stick of margerine (no butter.. :( )instead of shortening. My cookies baked perfect at 9 minutes - came out so nice and chewy (I was worried they'd be cake-y, but they were perfect). All I had was whipped chocolate frosting, ended up tasting like Little Debbie's Fudge Rounds, but even better! Thanks for this easy recipe. :)

I made this with a carrot cake mix that needed to be used.  I used a tablespoon measure and baked for 10 minutes, which was perfect.  The only issue I had was that my cookies stayed kind of puffy, so perhaps I needed to flatten them slightly?  I can't wait to try this with chocolate cake.

I made these for Christmas. I used devils food cake and spice cake. Didn't change the ingredients (not much to change!) I rolled them in 3/4" balls and flattened just a little with a glass. I used whipped cream cheese frosting for the filling. Out of all the different cookies I made, these had the most rave reviews. The spice cake was a bigger hit than the devil foods. But the devils food was also a hit. Soooo easy!

I loved these cookies! I happen to adore Oreo Cakesters and these hit the spot! They are very rich, however. I could only eat one, but that's perfectly fine because I made the sandwiches, wrapped them individually in plastic wrap, put them in a freezer bag, and popped them in the freezer. Whenever I get a craving, they're right there. They even taste better to me a little cold.

Very good and super easy!  I think these would make excellent ice cream sandwiches, too.  After having success with Devil's Food, I tried to use Red Velvet to make a more fastive looking cookie.  But the dough turned out way too sticky and I had to add lots of flour to form them into their cookie shape.  That resulted in the cookies not flattening out at all which made them too bulky for a sandwich.  I just put the icing on top and they are "ok" but not nearly as delicious (or as easy) as the chocolate variety.

I've been making these cookies for years and they are ALWAYS a hit where ever I go.  I use store bought "white" (not vanilla) frosting in middle.  Sometimes I even get fancy and melt some chocolate, put it in a ziploc bag and drizzle it over the top of the finished cookies...let it cool completely and enjoy!

I use melted butter in place of the shortening, no need to use a pastry blender that way.  Plus butter is better anyways!  I've used other flavor cake mixes with good results as well.

The Devil's food cake was too rich for us. We used butter instead of shortening. We love the softness of the cookie with the icing and will definitely try other flavors of cake mix.

I wasn't crazy about these when we made them, but the next day they were much better.  They were a little too cake like at first, but they firmed up by the next day and reminded me of the little debbie chocolate sandwiches you can buy.

I made these with strawberry cake mix and made the cream cheese frosting II recipe from this site.  I used butter instead of shortening since I don't care for using shortening.  I only baked them 8 minutes and they stayed extremely soft.  I left them on the pan for about five minutes and then transferred to a wire rack.  The flavor is pretty good, but they got mixed reviews at work.  One person said they were too moist and fell apart and got all over them!  I might try them again with dark chocolate cake mix or spice cake mix.

These came out really well for me, and tasted even better !  I used *very* soft unsalted butter instead of shortening, and after having a difficult time with the hand mixer (I don't have a pastry paddle) ended up using my hands to mix the dough.  I used a level tablespoon for each cookie and they spread beautifully, just about the size of a "Little Debbie" Fudge Round or Creme Pie.  I also used store bought frosting, all the "whipped" variety, in strawberry, chocolate, and whip cream flavors.  The whip cream flavor was the best, but the chocolate (I'm a chocolate lover) was a very close second.  I stored mine in tupperware and ziploc bags in the fridge and they kept well for more than 10 days.  It's best to remove from the fridge and let come to room temperature for maximum softness.  This is a VERY sweet cookie, especially with my filling choices, but I thought they tasted great and so did everyone I gave them to.

These are really good, I used a Vanilla cake mix and added pecans and vanilla extract to make a butter pecan cookie, and also as others did I used the butter and 2 eggs instead of shortenting, not a fan of it. Will make again with different cake mixes.

I've a similar recipe, and it is one of my favorites: #1 reason being is convenience, you can go from start to finish in close to an hour.  I keep all the ingredients on hand, just for those quick need 'em times.  I think the taste of the cookie is very good!  I've always had a soft, nice cookie.  You never want to over-bake, and these cookies definitely should be cooled on the cookie sheet completely.  1 box cake mix (my favorite is called Triple Chocolate)  2 eggs  1/2 cup oil  Bake 350F for 8 minutes.  Addins: peanut butter chips (won't take a whole bag)  I have tried a yellow cake mix and rolled them in sugar (like sugar cookies), but I did not like the taste overall.  Other than that, I haven't ventured from my favorite "triple chocolate" mix.  I recently used this recipe, with a cream cheese filling, and rolled the cookie sandwiches in crushed candy cane.  These cookies were find, but I'm hoping to refine and find a better recipe for that kind of cute holiday cookie.

I made this with a dark chocolate cake mix and used butter as reccomended by others.Delicious!! I made a cream cheese frosting and then used different flavoring like Mint,raspberry, chocolate and peanut butter.I give this a 4 because i tried to use white cake and they did not turn out. they were all flat.I highly reccomend this otherwise.

These are delicious!  The dough was a little hard to work with at first, but I just used my hands to work through it, like bread dough and it turned out perfectly!  Makes a lot of cookies and they freeze really well.  Taste great right out of the freezer!  Yum!

Terrific and easy to make.  The only drawback is that the shortening makes them very "heavy", so if you are looking for a light and fluffy cookie, this isn't it, but the cookies are delicious and present very well.

OMG, these are soooo good!  They are way better than oreos!  They are a little time consuming, but so worth it. I just used the ready made canned frosting from the store and they turned out so good.  I am still baking them, but had to put one together just to see how they were!  These deserve more than 5 stars!!

Absolutely sinful!  I used a box of Chocolate Fudge cake mix and a jar of vanilla frosting I had leftover, and they were unbelievable!  To make them all the same size, I used my tablespoon and scraped it up the side of the bowl to make it level, and then I smoothed out the dough into a perfect ball.  Every single one of them was identical in size.  I will definitely be making these again.

Addicting! So soft and yummy. Only problem that I had was mixing a double batch- next time I will just do each batch seperately. The dough keeps in the fridge well- just let it sit out a little to warm up before cooking again so the edges don't get really crispy. Will definately be adding this one to the cookie rotation at our house!

My teenage daughters use this recipe as their trademark "Happy Birthday" gift for their friends.  It has become so popular that their friends make SURE my girls know their birthday is coming up!  They once gave it to a church family for a halloween "you've been ghosted" treat.  (Leave the cookies by the door, ring the bell and run.)  That family called nearly everyone in church to find out who had given them so they could get the recipe from us!

I cut the recipe in half and boy was I sorry I did! Me and the kids are them up! I filled mine with Nutella and some with white frosting. I refrigerated them and they were even better the next day. One of the best things I have ever eaten! I did use butter instead of shortening and the cookies still got great. I rolled my cookie balls bigger so that my cookie sandwiches would be larger. Just a personal preference. I am going to try spice cake next with cream cheese frosting. One of the best recipes yet!! Try them you will not be disappointed!!

Very easy, chewy, and tasty cookie recipe. I halved the recipe and it made 21 sandwiches (42 cookies).  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site, but added more powdered sugar to the recipe and halved it as well.  I also added mini chocolate chips to the frosting to give it a bit of a crunch and they turned out great!

Good recipe, my cookies baked too long and I have to redo them. Bake until they look like they need a few more minutes (underdone). Otherwise once they cool they will be hard and crunchy, I think they are much better soft. Frosting however I am rating seperatly, WAY too gooey for the cookie!!!!!!!!! 1 star

Delightful! I used a cookie scoop to get consistency in the size. They turn out to be about 2 1/2in. cooked. I put the frosting in a ziplock and piped it on for easy. Tastes like the Oreo cakesters. Yum!

I made these cookies for friends and family along with a lot of other cookies. And everyone raved about them. My little brother who is 5 ate all of them and thats telling you something, because he is the pickiest eater I have ever known in my life. I used butter instead of shortening and they turned out amazing. I made my own frosting (2 8 oz packages of cream cheese, 1/2 cup of butter, 3 cups powdered sugar, and a tsp of vanilla extract) lets just say amazing :)

Very yummy.  However, if you don't have a pastry blender, I suggest using butter and eggs instead of shortening.  It will mix much nicer this way.

Love it, love it, love it!! How easy are these cookies?! I put one box spice cake mix, two eggs and 1/2 cup of shortening all in the food processor with the dough mixer. Press the button and the dough is mixed without any effort. Easiest cookies I have ever made and taste great. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Made these for my family and they loved them. I used 1 devils food cake mix, 2 eggs, used a stick of butter as others suggested and filled them with vanilla icing. My kids were eating them as I making them. This is 5 +++++ recipe.

These are way, way WAY better than Oreos. I can't really think of an easier recipe. For the filling I mixed about half a cup of shortening with 2 cups of powdered sugar and 1/2-1 tsp. vanilla. Making again soon!

We liked these alot. Disappeared very quickly. I used a Golden cake mix and chocolate cream cheese frosting to go between then. A definite hit at our house. PS...I used melted margarine for the fat in the recipe, no bad effects.

I made mine with yellow cake mix and the Creamy Chocolate Frosting recipe found on this site.  So they were vanilla-y on the outside and chocolaty on the inside.  The only problem I had was that after baking for nine minutes the cookies were so dark on the bottom that they weren't quite burnt, but dark enough to really intrude on the flavor.  Next time I'll lower the oven temperature and see how they turn out.  Otherwise, really nice recipe, thanks so much!

A nice, easy way to make cookies.  I hate to use crisco - so I substituted 1/2 C butter and two eggs.  Instead of making sandwiches, I just topped each cookie with a little cream cheese frosting (next time I would use s plain white frosting I think).  People are surprised to discover these cookies are made from a cake mix.

My son LOVES these cookies! For easier mixing, I put on latex gloves and squish the dough with my hands. The dough doesn't stick to the gloves. Leave the gloves on while shaping dough into balls - makes for easy clean-up. Also, I make the cookie balls smaller, about the size of a nickel, since a bigger cookie, after being spread with filling and topped with another cookie, is hard for kids to work around.

Very good cookies! My 2-1/2 year old loved the dough, and he usually won't eat the dough. :) I got tired of rolling out the balls, so I used a 1-Tablespoon melon baller instead, and it worked great. The only thing I didn't like was the size of the cookies. After you add the frosting and the other cookie (to make "oreos"), it was SO BIG! Not very easy to eat. I will make smaller cookies next time.

I misplaced my own recipe for these cake box "oreos".  This is a good recipe - great cookie flavor - but I prefer the cookies to flatten as they bake.  These baked up pretty high, but they're still good.

I made this according to the directions but after reading all the comments, this could easily be adjusted to use different cake mixes and frosting combos. I am excited to have these cookies in my arsenal!

These are so good and easy to make. I forgot to buy shortening so we just used butter. It may had changed the texture a bit but the taste was still delicious!

I used 1 box of vanilla cake mix, 1 stick of butter, and two eggs (per other reviewer), and I used Nutella for the filling and they turned out great! Super soft and not too sweet. Easy recipe and would be awesome to make in a time crunch. Definitely will be making again!

Super easy, had leftover cream cheese frosting to use so I made these. They do make for very large desserts though, since each one is two cookies with a frosting middle. But delicious!

The cookies are very easy.  The batter is a little tough to get mixed at first, but just keep working it until it's incorporated and smooth.  Listen to what others have said and make small balls because they do spread a good bit (I only put 11 per cookie sheet, would make them smaller than a quarter next time).  I made homemade cream cheese frosting to go with them.  Other people seemed to really like them, I thought the frosting was the best part and couldn't fully get over the "store-bought taste" of the cookies.  Easy, not bad, probably won't make again.

These cookies were amazing instead of icing in the middle I made icecream sandwiches they were amazing. I used 1 box of cake mix, two eggs and a little less than a stick of butter. They weren't sticky and they held together very well. Will definitely make these again.

Cream cheese icing is better. When craving dark chocolate, I add in a full 1 tbsp black cocoa. I've used cookie dough filling (Sally's baking addiction)and that works awesome for variety. Remember that this is set for the 18 oz box cake mixes, so you might have to add several tbsps of flour. Cook up a couple and see if they don't totally flatten/so you can adjust flour.  I use butter (never shortening) and butter, soft, works very well.   I use a small cookie dough scoop so all are the same size. I add 1 tsp vanilla to cookies as well.  Parchment paper is great as well for cooking these. Re-use the paper several times. Excellent to make this full recipe and then freeze if you think too much (several months just fine if in a freezer bag with wrap dividing the layers unless you freeze on cookie sheet -- then can go in straight up.Freeze absolutely wonderfully and thaw perfect). We love to eat them frozen in the summer!! Have fun and try different cake mixes as well. Pink velvet was on sale and I did the cookie dough icing with it -- fun variety! I've been making these cookies for over 30 years!!

Awesome! I do not own a food processor so tried using my stand mixer instead. Bad idea. Nearly burned it up because the dough was very stiff. I used my small cookie dough scoop and made 6 dozen identical size cookies. My first batch did not spread out like I expected, so I flattened the dough balls in the remainder of the batches to about 1/4 inch and they turned out perfectly. I used buttercream frosting for the filling. Husband and son loved them.

I made this exactly as written but used a spice cake and a carrot cake that is all I had also added raisins. I got 26 filled cookies(which would have been 52 cookies)I made them for church and they were a big hit. Do not taste like cake mix cookies :)

Taste ok. Nothing to write home about. Suggest you use a glass and slightly flatten the cookies before baking because they come out pretty thick. Easier to make sandwich cookies out of them when they are flatter. Haven't decided if I'll make them again. But all in all it's an interesting twist on a cake mix.

I usually halve the recipe and end up with enough cookies to make 12-15 sandwiches.  I fill with ice cream and store them in the freezer.

My kids and I really love making these chocolate cookies.  We've tried it with butter instead of shortening, and it gives it a rich taste.  Be aware, though they were still soft, they were a tad crispier.  I like them like that, though.  On a whim, we tried a batch using cherry chip cake mix.  My kids wouldn't touch them.  They really weren't pleasant, and they kept gumming up and falling apart.  The frosting couldn't even save them.

these are so easy and so yummy. I use dark chocolate cake mix instead of devils food.i use real butter in stead of the shortening.i only use pastry blender for part of it then dig in with my hands. i still use the cream cheese frosting (canned or homemade)but add flavoring to it. we have done mint, peanut butter, carmel, raspberry and banana. these are a favorite of our school's marching band during there 3rd quarter break at football games.

I made these cookies only with yellow cake and peanutbutter instead of the shortining. I also made homemade peanutbutter frosting and put that in the middle. My peanut butter lovers in my family really enjoyed them. They were bit HUGE and too much for the little ones though.

I always make several different cookies at Christmas and am always looking for something new.  I make my cookies from scratch usually and i think that is why I did not care for the taste of this cookie.  I was not impressed with the flavor at all.  I used a good devils food cake mix and followed directions.  The cookie by itself I felt was horrible.  I used cream cheese store bought frosting that I had for the filling and that made the cookies at least edible.  I did have a few people tell me they liked them.  I have been making and giving cookies away during the holiday for years.   ...I was not impressed with the taste of this recipe and will not be making again.  I gave two stars because the flavor slightly improved when made into a sandwich cookie.

Delicious and easy! I did not have devil's food cake mix so I used triple chocolate fudge cake mix instead and it was very tasty. The cookies seem tough almost hard but they might be my own flawed baking method.

4.5 stars!  What a great way to use cake mix to make a quick chocolate cookie!  They were soft and had good consistancy.  They are good that day, but I must say that it decreased in taste in the following days.  I just used store frosting and it was an easy way to make the sandwiches

Recipe was easy and made a ton of cookies. They were really sweet. I made the cream cheese frosting attached but used peppermint extract instead. Everyone really liked them. I thought they were just too sweet

Tasty and kind of fun to make but you don't get a lot of cookies out of the cake mix package.  Recommend you put some oil on your hands before you roll the chocolate glop into balls.  Makes it easier to handle.

Tasted delicious but I think rounding to the size of quarters was too small. They turned out small and didn't flatten real well.

I just made these and I have to say I'm pretty disappointed there is hardly any chocolate flavor ( and I don't even really care for chocolate). And despite others complaining of the cookies spreading alot mine barely spread at all the were very thick because of it. I'm not sure whether this was a result of using the shortening or not. I will try again using butter and report how it turns out.

TOO SWEET!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would recommend using a filling that is not too sweet.  Also, probably better to make them much smaller since they are so sweet.

I give these 5 stars for taste and appeal.  Easy to make, just don't frost them til they are all the way cooled or they will slide around.  These are tasty, chewy, and an easy 'fancy' cookie.

These were wonderful.  I used cream cheese frosting for half of them and marshmallow fluff for the other half and both were fabulous!  The cookies were easy to make and very tender, with a very chocolately taste.  I'll be making them a lot.

I did not have a pastry blender so I used just a regular mixer which was a little messy. The cookies cooked about 16 minutes instead of 10. They turned out very soft. I used store bought cream cheese icing and the sandwiches were very yummy. Got to love sweets to really enjoy these cookies. They are great with a glass of milk.

Easiest recipe ever and its really yummy! The cookies were a little crunchier than I like but it think if i wouldve baked them a minute or two less they wouldve been perfect. My three  yr old can amlost mix this up herself!

I just finished making these for a bake sale.  I wanted something a little different but easy and quick.  Besides being super easy, they taste amazing!! I used the Cream Cheese II recipe to cut down on the overall cream cheese flavor.  If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  Thanks so much for sharing!!

This is an easy, kid friendly recipe. My kids (5 & 8 yrs) loved making and eating them. Delicious in my book too! I used the cream cheese frosting suggested, replacing the vanilla with almond extract which is a must try.

Simply the best cookies I've ever had. They taste just like an oreo, only BETTER. YUMMY. My 5 year old son also loved to help me roll the cookies into balls and spread the frosting. It was a great recipe for the kids.

These came out great and were a hit w/ my husband and son. I made them a little bigger than the recipe said to, so it was a lot to eat when you made the sandwich, so I didnt frost them all and they were still great. I think I am going to make them for a cookie swap and add different chips to them and not put them together, they stayed really soft and chevy, usually cookies get rock hard!  Great Recipe!!

I was disappointed after the great reviews. These just tasted like cake mix and we're worth the fat.
