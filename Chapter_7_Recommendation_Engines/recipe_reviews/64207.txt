Wonderful, I was surprised.  I think next time however, I will add pinapple instead of orange to the couscous for a little sweet flavor and I also added a bit of fresh diced garlic. My family really enjoyed this meal.

This is between 3 and 4 stars. Quite good really except that I find the zucchini rather bland and the orange was a bit distracting.  I added my own roasted garlic oil made from roasting freshly minced garlic in olive oil to give it a better aroma. The next time I will use pineapples (instead of orange) which will certainly complement the couscous and give it a better taste. A half cup of chicken or fish stock will also enhance the flavour. I would use plain couscous the next time.

Pretty good. The flavoured couscous this recipe calls for is unavailable here, so 
I ccoked one clovee of garlic in about 1.5 tbsp. of olive oil before I added the 
white wine and water.

Good recipe. I added some fresh thyme to the chicken while cooking. Had a good flavor. I spaced out while making dinner & I left out the orange. Was still good though.

Very good and easy to prepare.  Wasn't so sure about adding orange, but the citrus flavor really gives it that little something extra.  Will make this again.

This meal grew on us as we ate it but it may have been because we only had crushed tomatoes which, in turn, made it a little overwhelmingly tomatoey.  The simplicity might tempt us to make it again, plus if we can think of some better seasoning for the chicken.

Interesting ... I seasoned the chicken with a spicy chicken seasoning and added some salt and fresh ground black pepper and red pepper to the couscous. I didn't have chopped tomatoes so I used crushed ones ... I think chopped ones would of been better since it is difficult to drain the crushed ones, but it turned out nice. My husband loved it.
