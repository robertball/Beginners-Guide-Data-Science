Fabulous! This was so good and the blend of spices complemented each other perfectly with a nice subtle kick from the cayenne. Definitely a welcome change from so many other pork kabob recipes we've tried to date. I used pork tenderloin that I pierced with a fork before tossing in the marinade. And, while this is essentially a marinde it adheres to the pork and forms a paste. For the marinade I didn't change a thing! While others added cardamom I found that it's quite an expensive ingredient and if you don't have it on hand this is quite good without it. I let the pork marinate for about 6 hours and skewered the veggies separate from the meat as they cook at different rates. This smelled wonderful and tasted even better -even my picky husband loved it! I couldn't resist making a dipping sauce for this: 1 cup of low fat plain yogurt, 1/2 cup Hellman's light mayo, 3 cloves minced garlic, and 1/4 tsp. of salt (set in the fridge for a couple hours). This went great with a side of couscous - a definite keeper!

Used this for pork tenderloins.  It's not really a paste but more a marinade.  Added cardamon and nonfat yogurt to the marinade.  Roasted in 400 degree oven for 25 mins.  Excellent and the kids loved it too.

Wonderful marinade, followed the recipe exactly.  Don't be afraid of the quantities of the spices- looks like a lot, but they are perfect.  The lemon juice did a nice job of tenderizing the meat.  I'm going to try it with boneless chicken breast next time.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I say that with such enthusiasm because I actually didn't change anything about this. If anything my idea of a tsp is a little heavy but that's always the case. The pork was so wonderfully tender and moist and the spices were fantastic. Thanks so much!!! I made it with a side of spicy sweet potatoes. :)

Delicious and easy to make.  To give it a more authentic Indian flavor, I added 1 tbsp of ground cardamom.  Would definitely make again, maybe using chicken.

Made these tonight with terriaki chicken kabobs and rice pilaf (we have a large family).  These were a hit with my, DH and the kids. I usually just marinate pork in italian dressing but these were fantastic!  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I've used this marinade for grilled pork chops and I made wings with it. It was awesome both times!I didn't even have to marinade the wings for a long time and they were so full of flavor. This is going to become a family staple because I can't seem to get enough of it!

Pretty good, but a little salty. I'd suggest cutting the salt in half.

Five stars for this marinade, it's out of this world!  These were very tasty, and I prepared exactly as written.  The pork is a little tough, hard to get it tender even with lots of marinade in a short cooking time on the grill.  Next time I will prepare this recipe with chicken.  Thanks for sharing, NPB!

Excellent marinade.  Used with chicken breast instead of pork.  Served with rice.  Would make again.

These were perfect!  I made a half batch and they were fantastic... my husband said this may be the best thing we've grilled yet!  I made a flavored couscous dish as a side... so many fresh ingredients, it was the perfect meal!

Very good.  Had a little bit of a sweet taste to it. Used tenderloin rather than roast.  Be careful not to overcook or pork becomes dry.

This was great--We loved it.  I would use 1/2 the salt and a bit less cayenne. 
I broiled the vegies separately and basted them with the marinade that I boiled after the meat was under the broiler. vegies took about half the time as the meat.

Amazing recipe!  I didn't have any curry powder, so I used 1 tablespoon of turmeric and added 4 teaspoons of ground ginger.

The masala was wonderful on these. I also substituted chicken for some and they were quite good.

Delicious!  My family doesn't eat much Indian food, but this went over very well.  Only complaint is that it's a little too salty, but that can easily be fixed when preparing the rub.

My BF and I loved these pork kabobs!  I marinaded them for about 8hrs and they turned out wonderful! I didn't change much except, I only added the juice of half of a lemon (it was all i had for lemons!)  and instead of water i used chicken broth.  A nice simple, delicious recipe for the grill!
