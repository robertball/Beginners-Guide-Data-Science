I made this glaze and used as a basting sauce for grilled ham cubes.  It was delicious!  We really enjoyed the light flavor it imparted on the ham.  This would be delicious on a baked ham, as well.  THANKS for the recipe, TEACH724!

Great on our ham for Thanksgiving. Very similar to my mother's pineapple glaze.  I've also used it to coat chicken before breading it with panko then baking it.  Yummy, yummy.  Great on grilled pork chops, too!

I added a little fresh ground pepper to this recipe--I made no other changes. This glaze was AWESOME. Very good.

I used crushed pineapple and simmered cloves in the juice first. Removed cloves, added remaining pineapple, brown sugar, flour and Dijon mustard. It is delectable!!! A yummy ham glaze or dipping sauce for chicken too!!

This was excellent! The only thing I added was a half cup of pineapple tidbits to give it some texture.

I will definitely make this again. I sliced up a precooked ham nugget and browned the slices in a pan and then added the sauce the last 5 minutes. I added half a can of pineapple as well. Next time Iâ€™m going to add a touch of vinegar to cut the sweet just a bit.

Awesome. Added canned pineapple rings too - tasted great. Just used the juice that the pineapples were packed in. I forgot to add the flour, but still good.

I accidentally forgot the free jar of Boars Head sauce when I purchased a ham- had a meltdown until I found this recipe. Easy and it was SO good!

I put this on a spiral ham for Christmas dinner.  Everyone said this was the best ham they ever had.  Delicious!
