I made this Tortillas about a dozen times. I am surprised there not many reviews. Very easy to make, very tasty to eat. Today we will have fish tacos with purple cabbage slow.

1 teaspoon salt is way too much. 1/4 is fine.  Also, they turn out better with a bit less water: between the 1/3 and 1/2 cup lines is perfect. Also, the tortillas need to be flipped twice: put in griddle, in about 30 seconds flip. In about 30 more seconds flip once more, and then it should puff. When they puff, theyâ€™re ready.

I cooked mine about 5 mins longer so they could brown (my oven temp may be off).  Husband loves them and he doesn't usually crave peanut butter cookies.
