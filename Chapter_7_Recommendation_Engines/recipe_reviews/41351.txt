This was very tasty and filling.  My teenage girls thought it was good, but a little too spicy for them.  My husband and I loved it.  Great for a cool fall meal. I served it with cornbread.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Yum! I served with a little bit of instant brown rice (prepared separately), and this is the best jambalaya I've ever made! I browned the polish sausage first and sauteed a little minced garlic w/ the onions instead of using garlic powder. Next time I will only use one pound of sausage and add a pound of shrimp. Deeee-lish!

Very good.  I added some elbow macaroni to the pan at the end. I also used cooked "hot" turkey sausage instead of the keibasa.

My husband and I both thought this was delicious!  I made the recipe exactly as stated and it came out very flavorful.  We divided the leftovers up for lunch tomorrow - Yum!

We left out the stewed tomatoes and diced chiles (neither of us like those things).  There were a few too many beans - we'll probably leave out the great northen beans next time and leave it with just the pinto beans.  Despite that, I really liked it but the boyfriend thought it was fairly indifferent.  I'll probably make it again at some point on a cooler day - the flavors did mix well in my opinion.  Like a previous reviewer suggested, I think I'll serve with cornbread or rice next time.  Both sound like good additions to this mixture.

This was pretty good.  It reminded me of another dish and I finally realized that it tastes just like jambalaya - without the chicken.  Easy and good - but nothing special.

Try it! I always get compliments when I make this. It goes well with the golden Sweet Cornbread recipe from this site.

I thought the flavors in this dish were yummy, and it was healthy and easy, too. I would make it again anyday. My husband, on the other hand, thought it needed to decide what it was: chili? cajun? Italian? I didn't have any Rotel on hand so used a can of diced tomatoes plus a can of green chiles. I also added a few cloves of garlic instead of garlic salt. I served this with white rice. Yum.

We enjoyed this so much that my husband asked for it to go into our regular monthly rotation! If you prefer mild foods to spicy, I'd suggest using a can of mild rotel (instead of regular for the can of diced tomatoes and green chiles) - this is definitely a dish that will clear your sinuses! Otherwise, this was GREAT.

This was ok - since I didn't have every ingredient I had to substitute or go without. Didn't have green pepper or great northern beans so I used 2 cans of pintos. Only had one can of tomatoes and since I didn't have tomato sauce I used a can of spaghetti sauce - and because spaghetti sauce is sweet, it had a real ketchupy taste to it. It was enough to fill the tummy with some corn bread but I don't think I'll make it again.

We thought this was good, especially on a cold night.  It was a little too tomato-y so the second time I made it, I left out the tomato sauce.  As others have said, it is good served over rice.  Leftovers are great.
