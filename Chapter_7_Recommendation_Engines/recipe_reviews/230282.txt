These are so good! I love that the chocolate is in the peanut butter balls. This is so much easier than dipping your balls in chocolate! Just like a buckeye without the extra work! Love it!

OK -- what did I do wrong? Nothing "smooth" once I mixed al ingredients together, just crumbly.

The first time I tried this I forgot the marshmallow and it was horribly crumbly. I tried mixing it in at the end and it made pretty swirls when I rolled them. I think it needs a little extra moisture so adding more marshmallow really helps. Great for chocolate fondue dipping!

I just made these and am going to take them to a show to munch on.  They are really good.  I am sure the family will like them also.

The only thing I added was to roll,in Graham's cracker crumbs to make them somewhat like S'mores.  Yum!

Delicious. The balls were a little plain so my daughter rolled out the fudge and cut it into little stars. So cute!

Didn't have marshmallow fluff so melted some mini marshmallows with the butter. Little crumbly but yummy.
