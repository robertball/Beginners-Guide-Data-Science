My first time eating quinoa. I loved this recipe and served it as an Easter side. I made this recipe exactly as instructed but allowed the garlic to marinade in the olive oil for a long time so the lovely garlic flavor would be better infused throughout the salad.

I made this using the suggestion of other reviews, and cutting the amount of quinoa in half, it turned out to be spot on! I was a little concerned at leaving all the rest of the ingredients the same, but it worked great! The only other adjustment I made was to toast the quinoa in a dry pan for about 10 minutes before cooking it.  This step really brings out the nutty flavor and, IMHO, enhances the whole dish! I also make my own Greek salad dressing, and, in the future, will try adding it in place of the dressing called for, pretty much the same flavor profile anyway.  This was a wonderful salad, both my husband and I loved it, will definitely be making this again!

This salad is great.  I'm gluten free and it is a nice substitute for a macaroni salad.  I added cucumbers (English) that gives it a nice crunch and freshness and made 1.5 the dressing . to keep it moist. Thanks for a great recipe

This is absolutely scrumptious. I did make some modifications and some additions. I  doubled the veggies, feta and dressing amounts but kept the quinoa  to 2 cups. It was a perfect amount as I am taking it to a potluck. I added fresh dill and oregano as I have an over abundance of those and was short on the parsley. I also completely replaced the vinegar with fresh squeezed lemon juice...I juiced three small lemons and added the zest of one.  I rarely write reviews, but thought this one was definitely worth it! So good!!! (One last thing, even if your quinoa is prewashed, it's still good to rinse it thoroughly. I used red quinoa.)

Super excited for supper tonight; this tastes amazing. I followed other reviewers advice and cut the quinoa down to about 1/2 the suggested amount, but kept everything else the same amount. I also added 1 cup of diced cucumbers.

This is the first time my husband and I have tried quinoa. I made it exactly as on the recipe, and it was okay when we ate it the first night. The second day, we liked it much more. The third day we finished up the dish and now I want more! Not sure if letting it sit for a few days made it better, or we just got to like more the more we ate it. Perfect side dish for a Greek dinner, or as a make ahead side salad. The olives, feta & grape tomatoes are a must when you make this dish.

This is the best quinoa salad I've ever made!  Perfect for my lunch!  I chop the garlic and let it marinate in the olive oil for a day and sometimes as much as a week.  It gets better as the week goes on!  Love this!

Exactly what I was hoping it would be. Next time I will add grilled, Greek-seasoned chicken to make it more of a meal as opposed to a side dish.

We really, really enjoyed this recipe.  I do the quinoa the night before so that it is completely cool before adding in the feta.  The first time the feta sort of melted and I just like the feta in more chunks....personal preference.  I also did the tomatoes with olive oil and garlic, to get them to really absorb the flavour and then add it.  Great recipe for a really yummy alternative to a lettuce based Greek salad, making it bit more filling.

Great recipe! It was my first time mincing garlic and cooking quinoa, and it turned out perfectly! I also added cilantro and avocado to it...thanks for the recipe.

wow! Pleased the entire crew with this one.  Followed the recipe to a T except for two things:  I had both cilantro and parsley on hand but went with the cilantro and don't regret it. Such a nice flavor punch it adds! Secondly, I had some nice plantains on hand so I fried those up, chopped them, and threw them in the finished salad. WOW, what a good idea. Adds a subtle sweetness to your bite that couples really well with the pungent red wine vinegar  dressing.

An awesome recipe. I added cucumbers to it and because I didnâ€™t have fresh parsley available, I added chopped spinach.

The salad was delicious! It had more of a delicate flavor than I was expecting. I used my rice cooker, as always, to prepare the quinoa. Using a 1 cup quinoa to 2 cups broth ratio, it gets perfect and fluffy every time. I made it exactly the way the recipe says with only one exception. I happened to have minced white onion on hand, so I used that instead of the red onion. The salad has a delicate Mediterranean allure. I will definitely be making this one again!

It was a great salad. We added some cucumber and red pepper also. The olives are a must but are a little expensive. Will make again.

Delicious recipe as written, didn't change a thing.  Will definitely be making this again but will probably cut the recipe in half as it makes a lot- although it's even better the next day!

This is SO delicious!  I'm a huge fan of quinoa, but I've never had a Greek version before today.  My whole family loves tomatoes, so I added a bit more than what the recipe called for--and it was great!  I will definitely be making this recipe again!  Five stars!

Wow! Great salad.  I also added roasted eggplant, roasted zucchini, peas, scallions, carrots, fresh basil, red pepper.  I added a little Dijon mustard to the dressing and Parmesan cheese instead of feta.

As recommended by others, I used 1/2 the quinoa and it was still a lot of quinoa.  My Bunco guests seemed to enjoy it, but I would not bother making it again.

Delish for sure.  I toasted the quinoa to add a nutty flavor before adding the chicken broth.  I made a small mistake of not letting it cool enough before adding the Feta and it melted in--the flavor was still great.  It made a lot so I shared with a neighbor and we all ate on it for several days.

My new favorite salad. First time cooking quinoa.  Love the lemon in it.  Didn't have parsley, so I added a couple of chopped scallions.  

Loved it. Thanks for sharing.

This is a great basic recipe that can be modified easily to your personal tastes.  I don't care for raw red onions so I substituted green onions.  I am trying to get more colorful vegetables in my diet so I also added shredded carrots, diced cucumbers (peel on) and a variety of colors of sweet peppers.  Because I am adding so much I 1/2 again the wet ingredients - vinegar, oil and lemon juice, as well as extra garlic.  This is a very healthy salad loaded with protein.  I plan to make this regularly and can't wait to have my friends try it at our next potluck!

Wonderful recipe! Super tasty. I used balsamic vinegar instead of the cooking red wine and it was delicious!

A little too tangy for me, next time I will cut back on vinegar and lemon juice. Did add crumbled feta at time of serving added great salty flavor.

Family enjoyed - especially Grant. Good recipe, especially for summer.  Did not use all the quinoa. Next time omit the onions to appeal to entire family.

I was looking at quinoa tabbouleh and Greek quinoa salad recipes and decided to go with this one, though I did modify it a little. I omitted the olives, but added half of a large shredded carrot and half of a large diced cucumber.  I didn't have a lemon on hand, so just used 2 tbsp of lemon juice. Delicious!

This is all gone! I used some homemade vegetable juice I had canned instead of chicken broth. No matter! Turned out better than great!  Took it to a potluck and was lucky that there were only 15 people there or I wouldn't have had any to bring home! Most of the crowd had never tried Quinoa so it was also an education to many.

This is excellent, but you really have to use less quinoa (after experimentation, I like 2/3 the amount).  Do use block feta chopped into small squares rather than crumbled if you can for a little more interesting flavor/texture.  The other thing I like to do is to add diced red pepper and some extra garlic. Iâ€™ve added chicken, but I actually like it significantly better without.

This has become one of my go to easy dinner recipes. It doesn't take long to make and is really packed with flavor. The fresh parsley is really important for the flavor, so make sure you have that! I also usually eliminate the olives because my boyfriend doesn't like them, and it might be better without them even though I am a huge olive fan! I think the olives end up adding too much salt to the dish so I'm happy without them.

After cleaning out my pantry I discovered lots of quinoa to use. I found this recipe and was so happy I did. It was delicious! Will definitely be making this again. I did add some chopped cucumber at the last minute. Gave it a little crunch but the recipe as is is perfect!

This is one of my go to potluck recipes and always a big hit.  I boost the add-ins a little; this is an easy thing to adjust for your preferences.  I also whisk the vinaigrette ingredients to emulsify them and make a dressing rather than pouring them over the salad individually. You can go wrong with this salad!

To much quinoa vs Greek ingredients, I used about 2/3rds of what I made and it was still a little heavy. Also could taste a bit to much red wine vinegar. Will try again with adjustments.

My new favorite quinoa salad! Only made a couple of changes: mistakenly opened beef broth carton, so used beef broth instead of chicken broth, and must say, it was delicious. I used sherry vinegar (out of red wine vinegar), added 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper, and doubled the amount of kalamata olives.  A very tasty, healthy salad!

I used 1/2 the amount of quinoa (! cup in 2 cups water and 1/2 bouillion cube, the same quantity of all of the other ingredients except a little less olive oil, and added 2 cups of chopped fresh lettuce, making a wonderful salad. Perfect

I've had quinoa in my pantry literally for years but never used it - deferring to the more familiar rice every time. I tried this recipe yesterday and I've joined the ranks of quinoa lovers. I love this salad. I left out the olives because my SO hates them but I added them to my portion and they only made it even better. I loosely followed the measurements, added cucumber and several different coloured peppers. I'll definitely make this all summer long.

Tasted great! I think I'd add a little more of the dressing (oil, vinegar, lemon juice) to make it pop a little more.

Quite good. Used fresh basil instead of parsley plus added diced bell peppers which gave it a nice crunch. Lemon is HUGELY important ingredient. My wife and I each had seconds:)
EDIT - I realize I forgot to add the red wine vinegar. Will have to try again:)

Made as written, though added some red and yellow sweet peppers.  Cucumber would be a nice addition too.  I thought the proportions were off a bit- lots and lots of quinoa for the small amount of veggies.

Great salad. Easy to assemble. Didn't have red wine vinegar so used apple cider vinegar. Was delicious. Let sit in the refrig for 4 - 5 hrs and the taste melded in each bite. Thank you for the fast, easy put together recipe.

I just finished making this and so far it's delicious! A hit with my brother and boyfriend which is always the ultimate goal. It needs to chill in the fridge for a while but i am sure it's only going to get better. I did end up however adding more of the dressing and quite a bit more veggies and some artichoke hearts and cucumber as well... I'm not sure but my quinoa to veggie/dressing ratio seemed way off. There was just soo much quinoa! Never a bad thing i suppose. Anyhoo this recipe was great and i will definitely be making it again. Thanks!!

A huge hit at the potluck!  My adjustments: no olives (yuck!lol), quinoa cooked per package instructions (1:2 parts broth), extra TBSP red wine vinegar,  1/2 cup chopped Italian parsley + 1/2 cup chopped fresh mint, 4 diced English snacking cucumbers. It was delicious for days, and I had multiple people bugging me for the recipe.

This my first experience cooking quinoa, but I love Greek flavors.  I worried I had done something wrong cooking the quinoa, it looked like some sort of porridge cooking towards the end. But it turned out fine!  And this recipe makes a lot! I cut in half and it filled my usual salad bowl.  The only other changes I made were the addition of cucumber and a teaspoon of oregano. I forgot to add the lemon juice, but I don't miss it.  It's delicious!

Great Salad!  Substituted cilantro for the parsley, just because I love cilantro!  I was also a little generous on the portions of olives, doubled the tomatoes.  Delicious!

I used Trader Joe's ancient grain mix instead of just quinoa. Added lots of interest. Consider adding chopped cuke for freshness and then using sun dried tomatoes (in oil) instead of grape tomatoes. May need to add more dressing if you make it a day in advance as the grains absorb a lot of it.

i used this recipe as a base for our quinoa side.. i had to sub several things as i wasn't in the mood to run to the store.. but i liked the core concept of what this is supposed to be.. only real difference was doubling the red wine vinegar, lemon, and garlic.. but we love bold flavors.. ty for the recipe

Never was a fan of quinoa until now. This was delicious. Light and refreshing. I had celantro  on hand so used that in place of the parsley and used black olives which are way cheaper. Also used queso fresco cheese because that's what I had on hand. It all worked nicely and even my grandkids loved it. Will definitely make again.

I made the recipe with a couple of exceptions.  My family doesn't care for feta cheese so I didn't use any.  But, I did add 1/2 of a seedless chopped cucumber!  Awesome!

Loved this recipe.  I hate olives, so I left those out, but I followed the recipe otherwise and it was great!  Made a double batch for a potluck and had rave reviews.  Also very easy to make.

This Quinoa Salad is fantastic!!! I can't get enough of it. It makes enough for me to eat off of it for several days, and I'm always craving more once it's gone. The simple fresh flavors in this recipe just can't be beat. Try it, you will love it!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I cut this recipe in half since my husband and I are the only ones who will eat this.
