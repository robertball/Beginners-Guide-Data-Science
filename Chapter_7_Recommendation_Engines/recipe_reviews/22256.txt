What an excellent meal we made with this!  We marinated 2lbs of shrimp in 1/2 cup tequila, 1/2 cup beer, some cilantro, garlic, and lime juice for about a 1/2 hour before saut√©ing with a tbsp of butter and some chopped onions.  We served with black beans, pepper jack cheese, chopped tomatoes and avocados in whole wheat tortillas.  You really can't make a more healthy or delicious meal!

Easy, elegant and delicious (with some changes since tequila I used was way too strong and overpowering).

I made it with 3/4lb. shrimp since I was only making it for my husband and I and here is what I did:  I made it with 1/4 cup tequila, 1/4 light beer, added few shakes of red pepper flakes, and fresh lime juice (almost 1 lime) and it was FANTASTICK!!  Very very easy to make and I served it over pasta.  I find that adding light beer to this recipe was key to increasing the amt of sauce w/out losing too much of the key ingredient - tequila.

Delicious.  I replaced half the tequila with lime juice and water, seasoned with a little margarita salt, and wrapped the cooked shrimp mixture in warm flour tortillas.  My guests--who generally dislike seafood, but love margaritas and tequila--went for seconds.

Very quick, easy, and fun!

We really like this recipe.  I used 1/4 cup of tequila and 1/4 cup of beer (it makes the taste more complex), and added the juice of 1/2 lime.  Very easy.  Serve on warm tortillas with black beans and frozen margaritas for a simple and fantastic meal.

Real good recipe guideline. Squeeze 1/2 a lime over the shrimp when it's done cooking. Also, after adding the tequila you might want to ignite it to reduce the strong taste of alcahol. Great served with chili rellano casserole, and mexican rice with totillas.

This was really good, we had chicken instead of shrimp since my hubby doens't like seafood. He loved it and he's REALLY picky.

Very good, quick meal. Next time I will sub 1/4 c. beer for 1/4 c. tequila, as the tequila flavor was a little strong for my taste.  Added extra garlic and crushed red pepper, which gave it an awesome kick. I served it over rice, maybe next time will try over pasta, or in a wrap, as others have suggested.

Excellent quick and delicious recipe. Don't leave anything out!! I sprinkled the pasta with grated parmasan cheese before serving. I even used pre-cooked small shrimp once and it is still delicious.

This was so easy to make!  

I took the advice of other reviewers and marinated the shrimp in tequila for about a half hour before cooking it.  Therefore, I added less tequila than called for when cooking the shrimp and then I added lime zest for extra flavor.

Next time I plan to make this, I will add some jalapenos in with the garlic.

Made it for the first time as an appetizer and the guests just ate it all up. Definately different from anything we've ever had with shrimp before. Would do it again!

This was a fantastic recipe. I actually added a little olive oil and served it over mixed greens, then squeezed a fresh lime over the whole thing. This made a tasty sald.

We love this recipe! I've used it with Chicken and Beef and usually serve it over rice. We've used it as a marinade on ribs on the BBQ and it is always eaten up!

This is a great recipe! Yum! I added tomato, onion and jalepeno to the sauce. I also used half beer and half tequila, instead of all tequila. Served with a sprinkle of cheese and corn tortillas- it was fantastick!

HUGE Disappointment!  I am beginning to lose faith in this website.  Very bland and boring!  I enjoy cooking healthy/lowfat meals but this was a waste of good shrimp!

This was absolutely fantastic. I used the very convenient herbs-in-a-tube (cilantro), and top shelf tequila, and my husband said it was high-end restaurant quality!

After reading the reviews, I too modified this dish for my wife and I.  A little Cilantro goes a long way, so I reduced it a lot.  I used these ingredients: 2 tbs each butter and olive oil, 1/2 yellow onion-chopped, 4 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp pepper flakes, 1 tbs cilantro, 14oz 61/40 shrimp, 1/4 cup each - Lite beer & white tequila, juice of 1 lime.  Melt butter and oil at med heat, add onion till not quite translucent, add garlic, pepper flakes & cilantro - 2 min, add shrimp - 3 min, add tequila/beer mixture - 1 min.  We only had angel hair pasta to eat it over - trust me, it works.  We will definitely make this again.  Enjoy

It was definitely very easy. Based on some of the comments, I cut back on the tequila and only used a 1/3 cup of it. I also used 1/4 cup or less of dried cilantro because I didn't have 1/2 cup of fresh, but I topped the dish with fresh. Although, my guests really liked it and even asked for the recipe, I found it to be O.K., but I'm not a big shrimp person. I also served it over pasta and I think it might be better over a salad.

I loved that this was so quick and easy, but I found the tequila flavor to be overpowering.  And we like tequila!  Next time I would add the tequila to the butter and saute the shrimp in it so it has time to cook off the alcohol.  The overall flavor was good, just too strong.

I don't know, I think the recipe called for too much tequila. I'm sorry, but I felt like I was taking a shot. Maybe I'll reduce the tequila or try beer.

Smells great while you're cooking it, but overall, it tastes quite bland.  And, I followed the recipe as is - no modifications.

Very tasty! I made 2 pounds of large shrimp. I incorporated the suggestions of others: 3 T of butter, 1/3 cup of tequila and 1/3 cup of light beer, a few shakes of red pepper, a sprinkle of margarita salt, and 1 whole lime. (I used the recommended amount of garlic and cilantro even though I made an extra 1/2 pound of shrimp.) I served it over buttered thin spaghetti along with a green salad.  For appetizers, my guests were served fresh salsa and chips with margarita drinks.  Excellent!  I rated it 4 stars because of the modifications.

This is a great recipe. Only thing I did differently is marinate the shrimp in the tequila, cilantro and some lime juice beforehand. Very yummy!

exceptional flavour. my husband and i loved it. i rated it low on the "kids" portion just because of the tequila. i have also made this recipe with a few additions, i added a couple of minced shallots and some diced tomatoes, so that the sauce was sort of a salsa...yummy. would like to know how to increase the sauce without changing the flavour too much, and without increasing the tequila.

Many of the reviews stated that the taste of Tequila was overpowering.  My family and I felt the taste of cilantro was very overpowering, to the point of not enjoying!  I wonder if the other reviewers even added it to their dish! My teenaged kids ate something else.  A waste of shrimp!  Sorry will not try again.

I loved this recipe! Yes, it was very simple and took very little time to prepare. I did only use a quarter cup of tequila, and that worked out wonderfully. Maybe I'll make this with some margaritas next time!

These had very good flavor!  We cut the tequila down to 1/4 cup, added 1/4 cup beer and the juice of 3/4 a lime.  The only other suggestion I have is do not use fully frozen shrimp.  Doing so, will make a lot (too much) liquid.  We plan to make these often as they are very quick and easy to do.

This is a fun to make recipe with unusual taste. I used previous suggestions and marinated shrimp in half tequila half larger with 3 Tbsp lemon juice and cilantro for 30 mins. I also added a small onion to garlic and in the end I added 2 more Tbsp lemon juice, some red pepper flakes and 1 tsp Thai Red curry paste as it was quite bland. I really liked the result and would eat the whole dish but my friend didn't care for it.

I thought it would have brough more tequila flavor on in. I was also afraid that the shrimp would overpowered by alcohol, but this was not the case all the flavors were very subtle I looked for more kick served over a bed of farafal whole wheat pasta. this dish was VERY well recieved!

This dish was tasty and very presentable, however I felt like it lacked something so I added hot (red) paprika to it and it gave it a kick that I was looking for.  I served it with Spanish rice to which I also added the paprika and the shrimp went very well with it.  Overall I'd say this isn't the most spectacular meal, but it had a different taste and I definitely wasn't disappointed.  I would recommend this dish and give it a B+.

Made the dish as exactly specified in the recipe, and wasn't that fond of it -- basically because the tequila flavor was way too overpowering.  I would definitely try the recipe again, though, with some moderations.

Delicious.  As one reviewer suggested, I marinated first and then cooked in the marinade.  Not the best approach.  Ended up with way too much liquid.  Although tasty, I could tell flavors were diluted.  But it was good enough for me to make again and I'm looking forward to it.

I pretty much didn't follow this recipe at all, however I did use it as inspiration.   I cooked about two ounces of chorizo in a pan then sauteed two cloves of garlic and about half of a large yellow onion with it. I then cooked the shrimp in with this mixture and added in 1/4 C tequila and 1/4 C lime juice with water. Once the tequila cooked down a little I added in about 1.5 C of pico de gallo and 1/2 C cilatntro. I then added a little chili powder, salt and pepper. It came out delicious!

adding in some citrus is an absolute must to give it more of complex flavor...easy and delicious! Also put garlic in a garlic press much quicker....just add when you put the shrimp to avoid burning

This was very simple to make and yet packed full of flavor. I did add cracked pepper and a couple of shakes of Frank's hot sauce to give it some heat but this would be great as written as well.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe. It was very easy to make, healthy, and delicious. The only thing ichanged was that I added a little less tequila because I don't like the alcohol flavor. I served this dish with black beans and Spanish rice.

This recipe was pretty good for a simple quick shrimp dish.  The tequila I used was horribly cheap stuff, but it seemed to work fine and I let it reduce so there wasn't much left in the pan.  I scooped as much garlic and cilantro onto the shrimp as I could while piling it onto my tortillas.  Pretty tasty!

This came out very nice. I substituted mexican beer and only used a bit of tequila, as I don't like the tequila flavor too much. It wasn't too strong, and everyone loved it. I served it with Mexican Rice III.

I really, really liked this recipe!  After reading others' reviews, I also tried adding a little bit of beer to the recipe.  I cooked it slightly longer and spooned some of the mixture over the shrimp so the shrimp had a slight crisp crust to the outer side.  It turned out wonderful.

This was so easy and turned out great! I did make a few changes though. I followed the advice in the reviews and only used half of the tequila that the recipe calls for. I substituted Corona for the other half. I also added the juice of one lime and marinated the shrimp in this mixture for about an hour. I cooked the shrimp and garlic in the butter and then added the marinade with cilantro, salt, pepper, and a good helping of chili powder for the last two minutes of cooking. Wow, it was off the hook! We ate it over garlic buttered pasta and my husband licked the plate :)  This recipe is also good because it gives you an excuse to buy tequila. And beer. We'll definitely do this recipe again the next time we want shrimp!

Delicious! I used pre-cooked shrimp, so I changed the cooking sequence. I sauteed the garlic in 1 TBS. butter then added the tequila, turning the heat to HIGH to boil off the alcohol taste. I added the cooked shrimp last just to heat through. The flavors were perfect!

This was awesome but, I have to admit the other reviewers talked me into some changes. First, I squeezed a full lime into a glass measuring cup, added enough tequila to make a full cup, added a splash of contreau to that and then added maybe 1 tablespoon of cilantro (all left that hadn't died in my garden), 3 green onions, 4 minced garlic cloves & I let it all marinate with the shrimp (and some sea scallops too) for 20 minutes or so. The scallops were a nice addition but not needed. I just like them so I often add them to recipes calling for shrimp.
I served it over angel hair pasta and it was very nice.

Good recipe with potential to be great. I marinated the shrimp in 1/3c tequila, 1/3c beer, juice of 1 lime and some crushed garlic. I followed the rest of the recipe, adding just some red pepper flakes and lighting the pan with a match to burn out some of the alcohol (which I might not do next time because I felt it took away too much flavor). I served it over angel hair pasta, which I tossed with some sauteed garlic and butter (I was worried there wouldn't be enough flavor in the shrimp to cover the pasta - I think I was right). It was a nice, light meal. Next time I'll make some modifications to enhance the flavor- it was a little on the bland side.

This was great! I used 1/4 cup tequila and 1/4 cup beer to 1 pound of shrimp and also added some red pepper flakes, sweet red and yellow peppers, onions and some spinach and diced tomato at the end of cooking it, as a filler. Put in flour tortilla and topped with black beans. I WILL be making this again!

This was fantastic! I made some changes. I used 1/4 cup tequila and 1/4 cup lime juice and put them in with the garlic before the shrimp. When the shrimp was cooked, I mixed 1 tsp cornstarch and 2 tbsp water and added it to thicken up the sauce. I put them in flour tortillas and YUM! They were even awesome as cold leftovers the next day.

The shrimp are so good!  You there is so much sauce, if you are a shrimp lover, you could probably get away with using 2 pounds.  I also only had 1/4 C. of tequila, so in reading the reviews below the recipe, someone had used some lime juice. I didn't feel like going to buy more liquor, either.  I could see where the tequila would have been overpowering had I used 1/2 C.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  However, as I was serving this over rice, I added some flour (Wondra) to the shrimp and sauce which added more body over the rice.

This recipe is pretty classy, easy, and has a good combination-- the tequila was just too much though, maybe I didn't have enough shrimp-- but when balanced (and with lots of garlic!) it was deelish!!  Thanks for a new spin on shrimp =0)

I made this with no change to the recipe,Just squeezed lemon juice over shrimp the last minute of cooking.It had no overpowering tequila taste at all,I asked my guest if he could tell me what taste stands out,He was surprised it was tequila.I believe the key to making this a delicious dish is to Definitely use unsalted  butter,Do not use GOLD tequila,Use a good quality SILVER tequila like Patron.And cook until all liquid is gone and your shrimp is glazed.Yum,I will make again.

I made this for my Christmas party last night and served it as an appetizer. It was delicious! I did use 2 pounds of shrimp, but followed the directions. I have some leftover that I think I'll serve for dinner tonight over pasta.  I don't think the tequila was overpowering as some reviewers stated,

I would have given this 4.5 stars - 5 stars for being quick and easy, but I thought it was a bit too much liquid.  I added the juice of 1/2 a lime and thought the flavors were really good.  I will make this again for a quick dinner.

This is a great shrimp recipe. I sauteed onion with the garlic. Then when adding the cilantro I added small slices of red bell pepper. The red added a great color factor to the shrimp.

The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because my husband is trying to quit drinking so I used margarita mix without the tequila.  DON'T do this.  It is very bland and I got a "don't make again" from my husband.  (Which doesn't happen very often).  I will try it again with tequila just to see if it is any better.

This was great.  I cheated and used boxed shrimp scampi and added the tequila, good tequila is a must!  Skipped the cilantro, hubby is not a fan, but used italian flat leaf parsley instead.

I prepared this tonight for dinner...quick and simple. We all found it to bland.  Could have used more cilantro. I followed the recipe to a tee but added a couple of pinches of red pepper.  We'll have it for dinner again tomorrow but I'll not prepare it again.

nice change.  I used a splash of Cuervo Gold, juiced a few limes, chopped garlic and let the shrimp hang out in the fridge for a while.  The danger here is it can quickly turn to ceviche if you leave it too long and then the shrimp will be rubbery when you get finished cooking them.  I added crushed red pepper flakes, lots of black pepper and a splash of soy.  I ended up pulling them out of the non-stick and throwing them in a HOT regular frying pan to get a crust on them and pull them out of the excess liquid.  
We had them with sauteed green beans and a glass of Reisling.

I'm rating this recipe low, because it was TERRIBLE to me. I was disappointed b/c it received so many positive ratings. I guess it wasn't good to me is because I don't drink. It was too strong! I rinsed my shrimp off and made shrimp alfredo. SORRY, but this recipe did nothing for me, but taught me a lesson.

Great recipe and I made some revisions based on other reviewers comments. I halved the amount of butter, and used 1/4 cup tequila and 1/4 cup domestic beer (it's all I had on hand). I did marinate the shrimp in the liquid for 1/2 hour before cooking. Delicious served over basmati rice. While I did like this recipe with the beer, next time I'll try the lime juice and tequila variation suggested by others. Thanks for the recipe Michael.

This was a nice variation on a basic shrimp recipe, but for me, there just wasn't enough flavor. Next time I think I'll try marinating the shrimp in the tequila a while.

i didn't have fresh cilantro, i think it will be MUCH better with it.  Without, the tequilla kind of takes over.

THIS WAS A TOSS UP BETWEEN 3 AND 4 STARS. IT WAS GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT. I MAY FIX IT AGAIN- BUT NO TIME SOON. I SERVED OVER PASTA.

This was awesome.  We made it as an appetizer, used 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp, and 1/4 cup of tequila.  We would use a bit  more garlic next time, but the taste was fantastic!

I made this as part of a Mexican themed dinner night.  I thought the tequila was still a bit strong, it did not cook out I could still taste it.  And I didn't want to cook longer overcooking the shrimp.  If I make again I would maybe just only use 1/4  cup tequila.

This was pretty good - I took the suggestions of a lot of people and mixed beer and tequila and added the juice of a lime. I also added red pepper and some cubano. I didn't really get the tequila flavor at first, but it came through a little more at the end.

Very good, have never cooked with tequila before had some in the freezer needed a recipe for shrimp and figured I would try this out. I do not care for cilantro at all and did not put any in. I added diced tomatos, red pepper flakes,splash of lemon juice, some mix of seasoning forget what it was called, served over angel hair and it was excellent.

sooo good...a favorite in our house...per other reviews I do 1/4 c. light beer, 1/4 c. taquila. I also add more cilantro, a little extra butter and juice of 2-4 limes depending on size I have and creole seasoning.  We spoon mexican style rice, shrimp and sauce and chunks of avocado in small warmed flour tortillas.  It is so good, a must try!

Eh.  This was okay.  I marinated the shrimp in the liquid mixture and garlic ahead of time, then just cooked in a skillet when it was time to eat - served it in a whole-grain wrap with fresh tomatoes and spinach and a little cheese.  Very healthy and filling but the flavor was lacking.  Next time I will try some red pepper flakes or something else.

Fantastic!  I have made this twice now, the first time I made it over Parmesan couscous, which was delicious!  Tonight I just made it again and just ate it alone.  Neither time I had fresh cilantro (bummer), I bet it would even be better with it.

Boyfriend was super enthusiastic about this recipe. Told me to definitely keep it. I added some red pepper flakes and did half beer half tequila on the chicken. I marinaded for 20 minutes and then cooked it all for about 10-15 minutes in the skillet. That way the alcohol burns off. Threw it over some coconut rice and yum!

I followed the directions. It all seemed bland except for the Tequila. It needed a little something else when you serve it with pasta. If you love the flavor of Tequila you might just like this one though.

I made this for my dad on Fathers Day and he said it was the best shrimp he had ever had!!  We made surf-n-turf tacos with it.  I have to agree with my dad, the flavor was excellent.

This was great!!! I followed others suggestions and did the 1/4 cup beer and 1/4 cup tequila garlic and I also added chili powder and ground red pepper lime and 3 chopped green onions too. Let it sit about 30 min. But when it was almost done it tasted a little bland. So I added more beer and tequila and it was perfect. The next time I would probably not add the beer or not as much it seemed to kill the taste!!!

These shrimp were very tasty, however, we added lime juice to the tequila and would marinate the shrimp for at least a half-hour prior in the future to really give them a taste.

Thought that this recipe was bland.  Needs more kick.  We followed the suggestion of others and used 1/2 of the tequila maybe that was a mistake.  But I was still looking for more flavor.  Served over pasta but I agree that it would probably be better in a tortilla

This was good, and I also followed others ideas and substitued one half the tequila for beer. Used a drker cider. The taste was good, but at the same time a little on the bland side. Will try this again sometime but add some additional spices to see if it can bring the flavor up just a notch.

the shrip was awesome.  Although i would not eat it over pasta as othershave said to.  The pasta is too plain and the shrip is good enough to stand alone.

I followed the advice of some others and cut the tequila and added beer and lime juice.  My husband and I still didn't think this dish was all that great.  Not that it was bad, it just didn't really have much flavor.  Wishing I had added some red pepper flakes, maybe that really helps.

We enjoyed this recipe but to be honest I have other shrimp recipes which are just as easy to make but are more flavorful.  I would make again as part of a theme meal.
