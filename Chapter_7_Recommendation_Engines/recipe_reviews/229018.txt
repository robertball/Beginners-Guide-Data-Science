I wanted to make this a little cheaper, what I did was buy two rolls of ground turkey (on sale for a dollar a piece) and add spices to fake italian sausage (sage, crushed fennel seeds, dried parsley, crushed red pepper flake, onion powder, garlic powder, little brown sugar). I made these into breakfast patties by just making 1/4 cup sized balls, flattening them out and baking them on a greased baking sheet. The whole family loved them. These are good alone as breakfast patties but they also make EXCELLENT breakfast sandwiches!

I really enjoyed these little guys! I grabbed a bulk pack each of Hot Italian sausage & country breakfast sausage from the market. I added a bit more garlic salt, smoked paprika and ground thyme or it could have been oregano. LOL Either which way, these balls turned out Yummy! Hubby was not cra cra about the shape of all things! He likes his sausage, patty style. Sorry, side note TMI:) These are a Keeper in Any shape! Thanks Robert!
