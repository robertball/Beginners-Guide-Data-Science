If you like asparagus you'll like these.  After they are baked the bread turns crispy and flaky.  I don't bother to toast the sesame seeds first, they get lightly toasted during baking.  You can also use different types of cheese to suit your taste.  Very good!

These were easy to make & a great appetizer recipe. Didn't toast the sesame seeds as they toasted just fine when baking.

Took the advice of another and used crescent rolls and prosciutto, they were amazing!  I also used about 2/3 package of cream cheese and did not put any butter on the outside.  Made these for just me and my boyfriend, but would be excellent as an appetizer for a large group!  Definitely will make these again!

These were ok.  I found them to be too cheesy, so much that it over powered the flavour of the asparagus.  I think you could get away with only half the cream cheese.

I omitted the sesame seeds, they weren't really needed. I did however add a slice of prociutto to each roll which made these really good!
