I made this for my kids for brunch. I could not find the 10oz cans of biscuits so I used 2 of the regular16oz cans (adding an extra 2 oz of biscuit dough) otherwise I made this recipe as written. I baked for 35 minutes, allowed to cool 5 minutes and then when I went to invert the pan, I discovered the biscuits were not done yet. I turned the oven back on and baked for an additional 10 minutes, it was better but still doughy but my kids ate it (while complaining of the doughy-ness).

Had to put bread back in the oven as it was not fully baked.  Not much sausage per slice
