Sal needs to take a look at this recipe.  I suspect there is a misprint as the measurements are all wrong.  I started the recipe as directed but after the rice had cooked all I had was dry, sticky rice.  I had to put the rice in a large casserole dis and break up the rice before I could proceed.  I ended up adding another qt. of milk, doubling the maple syrup and adding 4 T. brown sugar.  I then baked it for about 25 minutes and it soaked up all my milk again.  At this point, the flavor is good but I will have to add at least another qt of milk for it to have any creamy texture.  I should have known that 2 1/4 cups of uncooked rice would never work with only 1 qt of milk.  I suspect the recipe called for cooked rice, not uncooked!

I used brown rice for this, so I should have used only 1 cup of rice to make it have a smoother texture.  I loved the maple and citrus flavors together!  The pecans add a wonderful touch of crunch!
