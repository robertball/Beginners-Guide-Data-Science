I used stone ground mustard and black pepper and cayenne pepper. Who would have thought that mustard would taste good on fish? But it tasted succulent and not much like mustard at all.
My wife was skeptical when I told her about the mustard, but she liked it.

This was excellent. I added a little paprika and cayenne pepper to spice it up a little more.

Pretty good...used honey mustard and instead of pepper, used some Old World Central Street Seasoning from the Spice House.

My kids really liked this dish!  I did add some salt and garlic powder to the pepper for more flavor. The mustard didn't bring too much to the party except for a way to make the spices stick, which they would have done regardless. Maybe next time I will use a grainy mustard. Very fast and easy for a 'WHATS FOR DINNER, MOM" night! Thanks Girly this is a keeper :)

This was very easy to make and especially tasty. Paired it with brown rice and Creole Okra (also from this site).

I had never made catfish before so I was a bit nervous but it came out really well.  Instead of pepper I used creole seasoning.  My boyfreind can be a picky eater and he's a great cook and he said that it's the best he ever had!!!!!

i did creole seasoning instead of pepper; fillets- not whole fish; and oil only- no butter. i was surprised that we liked the mustard on the fish! my picky 7 year old wanted more and my hubby loved it too! had a good flavor- to me the mustard really added a lot of *good* flavor, so perhaps i was more generous with it than some other reviewers.

This was fine, but I did not get any "Creole" flavor.  Surprisingly, the mustard was very mild and could not be tasted, either, which is fine.

This is good. I had my doubts but wanted to try it. Delish. I added a little honey to the mustard. I mixed the pepper, mustard and pepper and spread it on the fish.

Husband said no mustard on my fish.  I read him a few reviews and he kinda didn't say anymore.  Well, after his first bite,  he never stopped saying how great it was until he fell asleep.  I did change out the pepper for Cajun seasoning and used filets.  So easy and made husband so happy.  I loved it, too, so now I have another great fish recipe

I added a little cayenne pepper to the cracked pepper. There was heat, but it was well balanced. Response was “awesome”.

This turned out amazing, with some slight changes. I used filets instead of a whole fish, mixed Dijon mustard with some sriracha and brushed it on. I did the cracked pepper on top of that and put a light sprinkling of salt and chili powder on too. Cooked in just a little butter and olive oil and added a few drops of lemon juice during. My fiancé and I both loved it, and I’m certain my picky daughter will too! So easy, definitely a keeper.

This was flippin amazing!!! I would have never thought of putting mustard on fish if it weren’t for this recipe! However, like with all the million other recipes, I had to change at least something LOL!! I despise lots of pepper so in place of pepper, I used “Slap Ya Mama” Cajun seasoning! I just sprinkled a little bit in each filet and BAM!! It was AMAZING!! My teenage boys didn’t even leave me seconds! They devoured it all!!!  Definitely give this a try! You will be glad you did!!!

So, I DO NOT eat fish, but my guys love it, so I try to prepare it for them. I added pink Himalayan sea salt, a little bit of garlic powder, and a creole seasoning to the the fish. I then brushed mustard on top of that and finished with a little black pepper on top of the mustard. I did not use as much butter and oil. I cooked it in my cast iron skillet, which was PERFECT and gave it a nice lightly crisp coat. My husband and sons LOVED this recipe! They loved that the fish was brushed with mustard and then cooked. It was such a quick FIX. It's a keeper for sure. FYI- I did not drench the fish in seasonings; I just seasoned it enough for my crew according to their liking in regards to seasonings. I will add this into the regular meal rotation for them.

I had Cajun seasoning & it worked just fine.  As others said, it's really surprising how great the mustard tasted.  I will keep this as a regular go to recipe.

Delicious! I added some salt, cayenne pepper and smoked paprika to the pepper and used catfish fillets instead of a whole fish.  It was fantastic! I think honey mustard would be a delicious alternative.
