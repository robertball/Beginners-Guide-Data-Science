This cake was a hit!  This is a nice variation of Tarimusu and very easy to make.  I altered the recipe a tiny bit by adding a splash rum to the mascarpone mixture.  (One of my guests had 3 servings!)

This is a quick and easy dessert. I left out the alcohol completely because it was for my kids' and their friends. Thank you for the recipe.
