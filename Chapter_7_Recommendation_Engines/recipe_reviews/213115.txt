The only reason I'm giving this a 4 is because i did change the recipe based on what i had on hand. Instead of plain yogurt I used sour cream. It was very good! I also didn't have cheese, which ended up being just fine, and also used a cilantro and lettuce mix. Would be great with green peppers and tomatoes, will add more veggies next time. This recipe will definitely be used again!!

These were really good. I used about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne in the sauce and corn tortillas. This makes a lot of sauce, I have a big bowl of it leftover. Next time I will serve this with lime wedges.

I made these exactly as written except for pounding the meat, I bought thin sliced meat.   
My husband ate three of them!

Followed the recipe as is.  It was very flavorful and something different than the normal taco versions.  Cooking the filled tortilla added a good texture and taste.  The yogurt sauce was fantastic.  I would not call it spicy but very flavorful.  Will make it again.

I love this sauce! It's so quick and easy, I found that I was making it to top many other dishes (and as a chip dip).

These were amazing!  Heating the tortillas in the pan gave them such great texture and flavor (we used corn tortillas but followed everything else exactly).  This recipe will be made again and again.

I only have this recipe 3 stars because the sauce it was really bland. I added more lime juice and about 3tbs lemon juice. it still needed something so I added a few squirts of siracha and it was delicious!!!! Great base sauce but definitely need to add citrus and spice. I used it on some leftover chicken and steak tacos.

Very tasty recipe! The only addition I made was minced garlic to both the marinade and the sauce. This dish was flavorful and filling. The next time I make it, I will only use 1 cup of yogurt simply because  as the recipe is written, it creates far too much dipping sauce for my family of 4.

When I made these I forgot to pound the meat thin before slicing, which I definitely recommend doing because without it the meat was kind of tough (not the recipe's fault though!).  I was unsure about using dill in the sauce but I did it anyway and it turned out very tasty.  I only made half the amount of yogurt sauce called for and it was plenty for us.  I also swapped out the onion for chopped tomato because that is what we prefer.

My family LOVED this! They said the house smelled like a Mexican restaurant. My 11 year old ate 3 of them so fast he had a stomach ache and my husband ate 6 of them!  I used lettuce instead of cilantro but will try cilantro next time.  Definately a keeper!
