I made this just as written in the recipe.  It was just too sweet for us.  If I were to try it again, I would use 1/8 cup brown sugar.  Or, I would scrap the tortilla and put the rest of the ingredients over lettuce for a nice salad.

Pretty good!  I used a half-cup of sour cream in the meat mix and and am glad I did otherwise they could have been too dry.  I also added a dash of cayenne and Chipotle chili powder to the mix... all fine.  Yes, I would make these again.

I really enjoyed this recipe and I will make it again. The only thing that I would change I will  add less sugar next time. The sweetness almost over powered the dish. I also used freshly cooked black beans . They are so much better than the ones out of a can.
