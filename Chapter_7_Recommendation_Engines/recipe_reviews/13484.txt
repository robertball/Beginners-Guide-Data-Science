I thought that these were okay, I drained them before serving, and they went over well with the true test, "picky girl", she liked them, a lot.  I think that I would 1/2 the soy & Worcestershire sauces next time.  Don't add any salt, as they have plenty as it is.  Thanks Denise ;)

We like green beans, fresh, frozen & canned. I have made this several times using all three types. Each time someone asks me for the recipe. This is great for a pot luck dish. A nice twist for green beans.

just plain beans that taste great! couldn't have said it better myself. I substituted chicken bouillon for beef and used frozen green beans and they turned out great.

These just have a nice different flavor.  The first time I made them I kept thinking I wish more of the flavor went through the beans.  Well, the next time I made them, I put the beans in a shallow container, poured the liquid on, sealed and let them marinate in the refrigerator for several hours.  Great flavor.  One thing I did differently.  I don't use bouillon cubes, so used a teaspoon of beef soup base instead.

I've made this several times now and I LOVE it!!!  The only change I made was using Dale's seasoning instead of Worchestershire sauce.  I've also used this on purple hull peas and it turned out great!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe it will be staple in my home for years to come!  UPDATE:  I use this recipe constantly and wanted to come back to say that if you're reading this you should definitely try it!  It's great!

Tasty! My daughter usually scarfs green beans cooked in soy sauce, but I wanted to change things up a bit to go with our spaghetti... And this was great! I omitted the butter and used a little garlic powder and pepper in place of garlic pepper... Oh, and I added about 1/2 tsp of brown sugar (to entice her, of course!) and it was a hit. The leftovers are very ugly but extra delicious! Thank you so much for sharing!

Very easy to make.  I didn't have any worshcheshire sauce, so I used liquid smoke instead.  Ok, but really salty.  I wouldn't make all of the time, but good for a change every once in a while.

These green beans were okay, but were pretty much just canned green beans in beef broth. I tried to lighten the sodium by using low-sodium green beans and low-sodium soy sauce, but this recipe is definitely not one for someone watching salt in their diet. Was quick to make, anyhow, and I am sure they will get eaten.

These were easy and tasty.  I used fresh green beans just because we like them better than canned.  I put the beans in a pot and put in water to approximate the amount that would have been in a can.  I added the other ingredients and brought to a boil, then covered the pot and "steamed" them.  Very good, a definite keeper.  Even good leftover too.  Kids loved them.

These were decent...but very salty and didn't really keep any of the good green bean flavor.  I think I'll stick to steamed fresh green beans with a dash of salt!

I was hunting for a way to make a can of green beans exciting, and this     didn't really do it for me. They were okay, just not worth the effort compared to just opening a can.

My husband gave these a four star rating, although I would have given them a three.  I used fresh green beans, so I had a little bit of a hard time knowing how much water to put in and how long to cook them.  If I make them again, I think I'll try them with the canned green beans.

This was a very special vegetable I served on Christmas day.  I used 3 cans Italian green beans (to serve 10 people) and added frozen pearl onions.  I did not drain the beans so that I could keep it warm (without drying out) in a crock pot til dinner was ready.  The liquid cooked the onions in two hours with crock pot on low.

I asked my husband to rate these and he answered, "Four and a half stars".  (I didn't eat them due to allergies.)  Since this recipe provided me with a quick and easy way to make my green beans delicious forever more, I'm tempted to give them five.

Easy and a good variation to standard canned green beans. My daughter, who will eat canned green beans, hated it. My son, who hates canned green beans, liked it (story of my life:-)). So, I recommend you give it a try, some picky eaters just might like it:-)

I LOVE this recipe!  I didn't use butter and I used garlic powder instead of garlic pepper.  I also tried it with chicken bouillon.  It's great either way.

Hmmm, maybe I did something wrong, but there really wasn't any additional flavor to these beans.  I used frozen grean beans and a bit of water in place of the reserved juice.  I will try marinating for a couple of hours next time before throwing them in the saucepan....

I use this recipe when I’m low on groceries. It almost fools your buds into thinking there is either bacon somewhere, or, a little bit of smokiness. I don’t fix this often but when I do it will fit the veggie space.

I use this recipe when I’m low on groceries. It almost fools your buds into thinking there is either bacon somewhere, or, a little bit of smokiness. I don’t fix this often but when I do it will fit the veggie space.

Everyone in our family loves this recipe, even the picky kids.  I sometimes add a pinch of onion powder and extra beef bouillon cube

I was looking for an easy green bean recipe for tonight's dinner.  Usually frozen green beans are a pretty tasteless side dish and I was hoping for a recipe that would rate seconds.  This was very easy and very tasty. I used frozen green beans and also used my microwave.  (16 oz. green beans and about 3/4 to one cup of water) As said before, it is a very subtle flavor.  My husband and I both liked this side dish (and had seconds!)and I will be using this recipe often I think.

I make this recipe every time I make green beans,now!  My 10 year old daughter begs me to make green beans.  Thanks for a great blend of seasonings to compliment a plain tasting veggie without adding a lot of fat or calories!

This was great-tasting and easy to prepare.  My young daughter liked it OK, but commented that it was "kind of spicy."  However, since all of us liked it, it will definately be on the menu again!
