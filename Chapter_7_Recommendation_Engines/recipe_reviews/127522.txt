This was good. The left-overs are better. I give it 5-stars because it is an easy and fast recipe. Usually pheasant recipes require too much prep...flour fry and then bake.... Thanks for the recipe.

Any recipe with Catalina dressing should be avoided! This was not good! I didn't know what Catalina dressing is but now that I know I will avoid it!

Turned out GREAT and sooooo easy! I only had one pheasant so I used chicken too. Since I was using boneless meat I thought it would cook quicker but it took the whole hour to get tender. The cranberry sauce I bought was a generic brand but I suggest using a name brand. The generic wasn't very chunky. Next time I'm thinking of using cocktail sauce instead of the Catalina dressing for some kick!

This was a great way to keep the birds from being dried out...plenty of sauce! I had 8 pheasants and I just doubled the recipe put it in a 9x12 pan and it was perfect. I had my in-laws over who don't like game very much and they loved it.

I was looking for a pheasant recipe that didn't have to do with cream of mushroom soup. We loved this!! We will be passing it on to the rest of the family. I didn't have Catalina dressing so I googled it and found a recipe. It turned out great.
