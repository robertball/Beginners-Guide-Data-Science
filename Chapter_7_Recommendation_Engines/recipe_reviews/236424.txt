I made this today to take as an appetizer for Easter. It was a hit! I followed the recipe pretty much as written but only used 3/4 c. of mayo and added about a tsp of Siracha for a little kick. Also, I toasted (under the broiler) one side of the sliced baquette bread and spread the mixture on the other side then baked them. I liked the bit of crunchiness the toasting did. I will definitely make this recipe again!

I have made them exactly as written and also sometimes I mix it up a bit. ALWAYS a hit!  A little less mayo is good.  I also used slivered almonds and even sliced when it's all I had.  Very good with white American cheese too!

My guests loved these! Next time I will sprinkle cheddar cheese over the top before baking to give them a nicer color. Will make these for super bowl!

4 out of 5 stars, could be a 5 with a little tweeking.  These tasted too much like mayonnaise.  I will make again later with a scant 3/4 cup mayo, and add a little Sriracha sauce for added kick.

These little tidbits are quite nice ... a wonderful change from bruschetta.  After reading reviews I did cut down on the mayo to 3/4 cup and added 1 clove of minced garlic and a dash of Frank's hot sauce.  It's great that you can freeze them cooked and take them out at a later time and just warm them up.

I made this to take to a dinner event last night and it was a hit!  The combination is surprising until you taste it!  This will be on my A list for parties and holidays.  Very easy to make and transported easily.  The only alteration I made was the recommendation of sriracha, about half a teaspoon, and I'm not even sure that was necessary.

I agree with reduced mayo. Sirachhia suggestion was great, I made half the batch with it and half without.  People loved both.

It was really good, but just a bit dry. My Sunday school class loved it!
