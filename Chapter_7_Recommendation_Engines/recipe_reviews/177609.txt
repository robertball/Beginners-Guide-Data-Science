Very tasty recipe - and versatile leftovers (great in tacos or tortillas).  The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the cooking directions aren't very good.  The chicken needs about 15 minutes, even when cut into 3 ounce pieces.  The rice should be put in about 5 minutes before the veg so the veggies don't get soggy.  But after tweaking the cooking times, the meal was delicious!

It was quick, easy, and tasty.  A good meal for the family.  The good thing about this one is that you can change it up a bit to suit your tastes.  We added asian mixed veggies instead and used extra garlic.  We'll definitley make this one again.

I am not impressed with this recipe.  I thought it would be quick, easy and good.  The cooking times were way off.  I cooked my rice for at least 20-25 min and it was still not done.  I had to keep adding liquid to it too.  I also had to take my veggies out early or else they would have been too soggy.  I thought for a Campbell's recipe this would have been good.

The rice and veggies part was great.  The chicken turned out dry.  If I made this again I would boil the chicken in the broth.  I made this with fresh veggies.

Not a bad recipe at all, it was actually very easy. I substitued brown rice for the white rice. It took much longer for the rice to cook through, but once it was ready, it was really good.

Just fixed this.  It's easy and quick.  No fancy ingredients, just basic cupboard staples.  It tastes great, just what I was expecting.  The only change I would make is to use a NON stick pan.  I used a regular pan and its going to be a stinker to clean, but other than that, this recipe is a keeper.  I also used a basic mixed veggie mix(corn, carrots, peas and green beans) and it worked fine.  Give it a try, worth the little bit of effort!

The cooking times didn't seem right for this, which made the chicken part of the meal below average when I made it.  The rice part of it was delicious, though!  I will definitely be making it regularly.

I made this with cauliflower rice to keep it keto friendly. Doubled the “rice” and removed an equal amount of liquid. It could’ve used more seasoning but was ready in the time given and I’ll probably tweak it and do it again.

The rice was bangin’...chicken not so much.  It was dry and not well received.  It was reborn as chicken salad with much needed seasoning.  I would make it again with tweaks...meat cooking time and seasoning  adjusted.

Tried it, but instead of bacon, I used sausage. Works well with the rest of the recipe. Yummy :)

Neither my husband nor I cared for this dinner at all. The cooking time was way off and the vegies ended up too mushy. There was no real flavour to it at all despite the two large cloves of garlic that I used.

I made this recipe except I used fresh carrots & broccoli. It came out good except for the chicken...I had to take out the chicken and cook it a little longer. I also added some ground ginger which gave it an “Asian”-y flavor. Next time I'll add frozen stir fry veggies with the ginger! Overall, a good recipe....very versatile.

Chicken was dry, rice was crunchy and veggies were mushy...times were all off..I'll stick to my oven version.
