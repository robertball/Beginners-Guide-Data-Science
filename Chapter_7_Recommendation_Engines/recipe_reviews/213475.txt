This was very easy to make and delicious.  I did chop the raisans into smaller pieces.  The alcohol does change the consistency of the ice cream but it's still very good.  Next time I make this, I may puree the raisans with the rum and then add to the ice cream.

Really an easy and great recipe. My husband is the rum raisin expert and gave this 5 stars. I had never had it before and liked it well enough. I used homemade vanilla ice cream and just added the soaked raisins (I gave them a whirl in my food processor first) and only half the rum with the ice cream during the last five minutes in the churn. After 24 hours in the freezer I left it on the counter for about 5 minutes and it was super soft thanks to the alcohol. Thank you very much for the recipe.
