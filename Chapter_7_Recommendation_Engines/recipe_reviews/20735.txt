This is the easiest recipe.  You can spice it up however you want.  I made 3 variations: 1 with roast beef, mozerella cheese, and mixed the cream cheese w. dry french onion dip (to taste); one with ham, mozerella cheese, lettuce, and mixed c.c. with dry italian (to taste), and lastly turkey, carrots, lettuce and mixed c.c. with ranch to taste.   WERE A HIT.  either refrigerate overnight then cut, or use toothpicks!

This is great appetizer to serve.  I did make some changes to make it a little bit more tasty.  I added the Ranch Seasoning to the cheese as others suggested.  I also omited the carrots and lettuce and instead used shreeded cabbage to make it crispier and diced green onions for a kick.  I also seasoned with salt and pepper.  I also used roma tomatoes and took out the seeds.  It wasnt soggy at all.  And make sure to warm tortillas in microwave.  This way they wont crack when you roll them up.

I used 10 burrito size tortilla shells. Made one batch as the recipe is written. A little bland for my family's taste. Very good if eaten right away so lettuce doesn't wilt and tomato liquid doesn't penetrate tortilla too much. I'm not fond of soggy bread stuffs. The second batch I added 1/3 cup sour cream, 2t garlic powder, 1T chopped chives and 1t dried cilantro to the cream cheese. I used roma tomatoes (used only the meat of the tomato not the seeds and liquid.) These changes made my family happy by adding a tastier flavor to the cream cheese and preventing the tortilla from getting too soggy with the tomato seeds and liquid. I will be making these again with my modifications. Thanks for a great idea, Joan.

Rather than an appetizer I will make these for lunch.  They are great and I will just throw in what I have in the fridge.  If you make as is, they are a little bland.  I would recommend mixing some powdered ranch into the cream cheese.

I made these to serve after church service and those people went crazy for them -- even asked if I had more hidden in the kitchen. Changes I made:  I used prepackaged shredded lettuce, I added a sprinkling of seasoning salt to the cream cheese, and I omitted the tomato.  I also added some finely shredded Mexican cheese blend on top of the shredded lettuce. Delicious, different, portable and easy.  Thanks so much Joan!

I loved the idea!  I have had this type of wrap but never knew the spread.  I used others ideas and added the Ranch dip/dressing seasoning package to the cream cheese!  Excellent!!  I didn't have any trouble rolling them,  I placed all the ingredients to one side and the cream cheese sealed them nicely.  NO Toothpicks needed!  Just be sure to spread the cream cheese mixture over the whole tortilla!  Thanks for sharing a great lunch or party idea!

These are a good finger food for a pot luck.  Other options to add are black or green olives, pepperoncini, or artichoke hearts.

Tasty and easy snack for a small function or lunch. I pretty much echo the comments by fellow reviewers: FRESH tortillas are a must, skip the tomato unless serving immediately, definitely add powdered ranch (far, far too bland without it) and make sure you've plenty of toothpicks at hand.  Using pre-shredded lettuce (as recommended here) makes this a far easier task.  Also, if you want to eat these as more of a meal than a bite-sized snack, use burrito size tortillas and slice into two pieces.  Overall these are pretty tasty and the sky's the limit for ingredients!  Don't forget the powdered ranch though!!

These are very good!!! I took "ErinSutter's" advice and added a little dry ranch dressing to the cream cheese (maybe 1/2 TBLS? I just opened a pkg and added/mixed until the taste was right = you don't want the ranch to get these too salty) and omitted the tomatoes. I didn't want them to get soggy. I did mince some green bell peppers in addition to the grated carrots. Very good! Also make for a great/quick lunch on the go!! Thanks Joan.

Great recipe!  Like so many others, adding ranch dressing mix is a must.  I substituted alfalfa sprouts and avocado for the lettuce and carrots.  And I love tomatoes and did not want to omit them because they make the wrap soggy, so I pulled out my old salad spinner (you remember those don't you?), blew off the dust, tossed my diced tomatoes into it and gave it a spin.  Not only did the spinner pull out ALL the moisture from the tomato, it de-seeded it too!  I added my now dry tomato bits to the wrap and voila, no more soggy wrap!  My family LOVED it.

I'm really not sure what all the hype about these are.  I give it maybe a 2 out of 5.  These didn't wow me at all.  Also, did NOT like the suggestion from the gal rated 'most helpful' to add french onion mix to cream cheese for a roast beef option.  Tasted SUPER processed, not fresh.  Not sure about the one with ham.  Was looking for a really good wrap to bring as a picnic item to Napa Valley, unfortunately did NOT find it with this recipe.  Sorry...  :(

I make these wraps all the time and they're always a huge hit. They make terrific appetisers but we also enjoy them as a lunch: they're so easy to prepare! I always use low fat dill/chives cream cheese and sometimes add alfafa sprouts. This recipe is a winner, both for dieters and gourmets!

This was very good. I was making these for a party so for a little more presentation, instead of using tortillas, I used three different kinds of flat bread. I also used flavored cream cheese, and used different kinds of meat and veggies in each one. The first four that I rolled were spinach flatbread, spread with garden veggie cream cheese, and topped with roast beef, mozzarella cheese, and alfalfa sprouts. The next four were sundried tomato flatbread, spread with sundried tomato and basil cream cheese and topped with turkey, mozzarella cheese and cole slaw. And the last four were Italian flatbread, spread with onion and chive cream cheese and topped with ham, mozzarella cheese, and cole slaw. About six slices of meat overlapping across the flatbread is good, and you want to keep the cheese, sprouts, cabbage, or whatever else you use to just a nice sprinkling or it can be a little overpowering. If I had had time I was going to do an all veggie with a sundried tomato flatbread, garden veggie cream cheese, chopped black and green olives, and cole slaw. Chopped cucumber would have been delicious too, if I had had any. These were a hit at the party, and everyone really enjoyed them. And best of all, my 2 year old was asking for some and I was giving her the very end pieces that are usually kind of ugly when they're cut off. She never would have eaten it as a regular sandwich.

This also makes a great pinwheel appetizer for parties. To make a tastier "spread", I suggest you add a teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder, dill weed, basil and oregano. I like to add chopped red onion, too.

I love these.  So many ways to make.  We are mexican food nuts so I spread with canned refried beans, then maybe lettuce, tomatoes, certainly add'l cheddar and even some cream cheese, or sour cream?  So good. My daughter-in-law loves when I make and freeze (leave out vegies)\.  It gives her something to throw in the kids lunches! Thanks Sal!

Delish! I turned mine into a Turkey BLT kinda, by mixing in crumbled bacon (store bought, Hormel) with the cream cheese!  Used whole wheat tortillas from Trader Joe's too. YUM!

Made these with both ham and turkey, omitted the carrot, and added a dry ranch packet to the cream cheese. They were delicious and a hit at the party I brought them too.

So yummy, and so filling! I don't know why I've never thought of making these kinds of wraps at home, but I'm glad I did.   I changed up the recipe a bit: I used whipped cream cheese for easier spreading, and topped the cream cheese with some yummy garlic pepper seasoning (made by McCormick, it comes in a grinder, and is sometimes carried as a store brand--premixed blend, so good, and no calories, unlike the ranch mix suggested below). I also used romaine lettuce (can't stand iceberg). I omitted the carrots, but chose to add in some extra lettuce and tomatoes instead.   Absolutely delicious, very fast, and very easy to make. My boyfriend even loved them, and he's the pickiest eater I know.

I served these during a bridge game, and everyone seemed to like them.  These are nothing I would make for a fancy event, but they are cheap and filling for a more relaxed night and atmosphere.  There were only four of us, so I used three tortillas, and I had about 4 leftover pieces at the end of the night.  Instead of plain cream cheese, I used Garden Vegetable because I had leftovers of that in my fridge.  I would definitely make them using that again.  I didn't use lettuce because I don't really care for lettuce on sandwiches, but I did use the carrots and tomatoes.  I did small slices of the tomatoes instead of mincing them.  I also used turkey and added Muenster cheese.  These are quick, easy, inexpensive, and tasty.  I would definitely make these again, and you can spruce them up anyway you'd like.  Alter it to your tastes and preferences.

I'm always looking for new ideas for things to pack for Hubs to take to work.  This can be a challenge since he picks and nibbles when he can, never actually taking time out for lunch.  He likes things light, fresh, health-conscious, non-messy (he's been known to dribble on his ties...)  and not heavily spiced.  Pretty and inviting, cut into snack-size portions, this was perfect.

These are delicious!  We couldn't figure out why there wouldn't be some cucumber in the wrap, so we added that (along with a touch of seasoned salt and some pepper) . . . delightful.

The only thing that I think I could have done differently is more cream cheese.  I did not like these, they were soooo plain.  I dipped mine in ranch for some flavor.  Made a quick dinner, but not something I'd probably do again.

Yummy Yum Yum. I made these as an appetizer for a dinner party recently and the adults gobbled them up. I also made these for my daughter's yard party and the kids loved them too. Easy to prepare and fun to eat. I do make some modifications. I add dried packet dressing (like ranch dressing in the packet or italian dressing in the packet or some dry dip mix like onion dip or au jus) to the cream cheese and also add sour cream to the spread. This enhances the flavor a whole lot.

These went over really well at our party, everyone at them. but they don't do all that great as a make a day ahead dish, the lettuce sorta wilts a little and the carrots stained the totilla kind of orange.  But they were still really good.

If you do not like the ingredients in this particular recipe...then "alter" it! You know what your taste buds crave...so, go ahead and put it in your "specialize" wrap. You can even heat them up if you prefer a heated cheesy wrap versus a cold one! For appetizers cut the roll into circles (as seen on deli platters). If you desire a WRAP with substance ADD roast beef or pastrami...cut it thin and roll it up with the rest of your favorite ingredients-assorted cheeses & veggies. If you desire a crunch for "texture" add more carrots, French's crunchy onion strings, radishes, celery, english cucumbers,water chestnut, etc.  If you desire a "softer" WRAP simply add "pre-made" egg, chicken, turkey or tuna salad to your WRAP, along with spinach leaves, arugula or any of your "favorite" power greens. ADD avocado slices, sweet chopped tomatoes! Drizzle w/your favorite salad dressing prior to rolling the wrap. I love salmon...therefore, my wrap is filled with "seasoned" cream cheese, a light sprinkling of dill or rosemary herbs...freshly cracked pepper & baby spinach leaves. I sometimes will add avocado infused with seasalt & olive oil, fresh spring lettuce, Tomato & BACON! It just depends on what I'm craving.  Be CREATIVE...and don't be afraid to GO FOR IT! If you like crab salad...add it to your wrap.  If you want to add your "thanksgiving" leftovers (turkey, stuffing, cranberry, etc.) go ahead it's your masterpiece! If you prefer "all" veggies-mushrooms, chick peas, sprouts. NO RULES!

Excellent idea!  I needed something in a pinch for a football party and these really did the trick.  Made a few different rolls with different veggies-some had green peppers, some had tomato, and some had cheese.  Everyone was pleased and they were easy on my end.  Also added dry ranch mix in per others' suggesstions, great idea!

Very, very good and quick to make.  I omitted the tomato because I plan to make these the day before a big party.  As several other reviewers suggested, I added powdered salad dressing to the cream cheese to give it a little more flavor.  I'm planning to make a set of ham wraps with powdered Italian dressing, a turkey set using powdered ranch, and a roast beed set using powdered French onion dressing.  I also found it useful to spread the cream cheese mix on the entirel tortilla, but only layer the other ingredients on half of the tortilla.  When I rolled it up (beginning with the turkey side) the wrap stayed glued shut.

Very good base recipe for a wrap allowing for as many variations as you can possibly imagine. I love that it uses cream cheese. It makes it overal more filling and holds everything together better than mayo. I used fat-free cream cheese and mixed in a few sprinkles of Hidden Valley Ranch Fiesta Ranch Dip dry mix. Absolutely fabulous and quick. Thank you!

I made this for my son's 1st birthday party.  Everyone raved about them.  My brother even stole a plate full to take home! I also added some dry ranch dressing to the cream cheese.  I used packaged shredded lettuce and our grocery store sell matchstick carrots.  I used those instead of shredding them I was running short on time.  Also added shredded cheese.  I will make this again!

I had a small party of about 10, so I just made a few... they went really fast... my husband (God love him) is one of the pickiest eaters I know... and when I told him what it was he turned up his nose at it...but I made him eat one... a few minutes later he had me bring him another one... I did leave out the carrots..and sliced my tomatoes though. Also I took the advice of adding ranch dressing to the cream cheese!! AWESOME!! I will definately make again!

It was Super!  Used it for my Mom's 90th birthday party.  Would definitely use again.  One secret to the success was using FRESh tortillas, keeping them moist.  Then they don't crack, etc.

I had no idea what to make for a potluck-style Christmas party that was over an hour away!  Had to be something cold, and this was perfect!  Personally, I left out the veggies, and just used the tortillas, with cream cheese, turkey and lettuce.  They were a HUGE hit!  Perfect when you need to "fill" people for cheap!  I divided them into three pieces, with toothpicks, and they looked cute too!  Enjoy!

Makes a great and easy lunch!  As is, I think it needs a little spicing up.  Try using a flavored cream cheese.  I used cream cheese with onion and chives.  I also used a whole wheat tortilla to make it a bit healthier.

I like to add seasonings to my cream cheese depending on what stuffing I use. Cumin for Mexican wraps, oregano for Greek. You can make up endless combinations. Get the pre shredded lettuce and carrots and it is a breeze to whip up a bunch for appetizers.

This is great and easy ! Add ranch packet to the cream cheese. I add two cream cheese one regular and the other half the fat. Then add one ranch packet and stir. I get compliments all the time about it. It's so easy and pretty . Perfect for lunch.

I failed to read the previous reviews but learned for myself that the tomatoes make these really soggy if they have to sit very long, so I'll leave them off next time.  I also like the suggestions of adding flavored cream cheese, because these are pretty bland.  They are, however, really easy, and make a good lunch as well as an appetizer.

Indeed very easy to make! Makes an easy, filling and tasty lunch - I left out the tomatoes so that the tortilla shell wouldn't get soggy. Felt that the wrap could have used a little something to spice it up though -- maybe flavoured cream cheese?

This is a really great basic recipe.  I made a variety - roast beef and cheddar adding horseradish to the cream cheese and microgreens; ham and swiss adding spicy mustard to the cream cheese and cucumber.  I replaced the tomatoes with shredded English cucumber which is more liked by my friends than tomatoes (which can get watery). Cucumbers can too, but I just squeezed them in paper towels to take out the excess.  The all-time favorite was peppered turkey and pepper jack cheese with salsa stirred into the cream cheese and avocado instead of carrots. Yum and very versatile.

Super quick and very versatile. You can make these however you wish. I seasoned my cream cheese with a little ranch mix and dill and spread over the entire surface of a large tortilla. Added ham, turkey, diced tomatoes (that I seeded), diced lettuce and shredded carrot. They were delicious. I had no problem with sogginess (I made them hours early) - but again - I seeded the tomatoes and layered everything else on the tortillas before I sprinkled them with the tomatoes. Even the leftovers the next day were not soggy at all. In fact, I liked the taste better. I think the seasoning in the cream cheese had more time to meld together. I served these with some homemade soup and everyone loved them. I think next time I'll try roast beef. Thanks!

After reading the reviews I changed a few things.  I didn't have flavored cream cheese so I softened the cream cheese I had adding fresh chives, hydrated sun dried tomatoes, and grated sharp cheddar cheese, sprinkled in a little garlic salt and mixted all together with the cream cheese.  This method really gave a lot of flavor to the wrap and they were not messy to roll or to eat.  Very refreshing on a hot day!  Will also be making these for football snacks!

I have made these 3 times since dec. 17th 2005 until today 12-31-05. Everyone loves them. I used dry ranch seasoning in cheese as was sugg. by others. I choose not to use tomatos. I used Bell peppers instead. Great and easy. Also makes a nice light dinner/lunch.

I make this ALL the time. Way before I even read this recipe. I would suggest adding dill to the cream cheese. It kicks up the Cream Cheese a little bit.

the cream cheese sounded plain to me so I used dijon mustard instead.  It gave the wraps a nice little kick.  Perfect for a light lunch.

I thought these were very good. However, I did "dress" them up a little. I added tomatoes, ham (and the turkey) and pickles. Then to hold them together better I used toothpicks. Will definitely make again.

I needed an appitzer at the last minute, and had all these ingredients on hand.  They disappeared quick, even the kids ate them.  I sliced the tomatoes to keep them from falling out.

I will make these again, but will jazz them up like this : add dry ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese, cut small sweet gherkins in half lengthwise and place several down the middle before wrapping, add some thinly sliced red onion, cheese would be good, too. Tasty and easy. OOH - just had a great thought - crisp fried bacon !!

I like the concept, it's a good idea for a light lunch/snack.
But...they are bland! It's best to add a bit of seasoning to the cream cheese to give more flavour. Or use ranch or different types of mustard as others have suggested.

Sooooooo quick and easy, and soooooooo yum that I didn't get a chance to take pictures!!  TONS of possible variations-- I made 'em for a big July 4th party and made them turkey/turkey ham/roast beef.  Also used low fat veggie cream cheese, subbed spinach for the lettuce, and left out the tomatoes (too soggy!).  The regular, wheat, and spinach tortilla rolls chilled in the fridge for a couple of hours, then were sliced up, arranged "festively," and were gone before I knew it!!! YUM!!!

Not a big fan of wraps but this one is pretty good and easy to make. I excluded the carrots and tomatoes but decided to make Ranch Dressing a dipping sauce. It adds great flavor and it's filling. Honey Mustard would be a good alternative as well.

These make a fast and delicious wrap for lunch.  I added provolone and salami as I had it on hand but it would be easy to add any additional ingredients and it would work well.  You can’t go wrong with this wrap.

Made this last night for company.  They were very quick and easy to make and everyone loved them.  For a little more flavor, I would try using a flavored cream cheese (like an herb flavored one).

These were the hit of a party I had recently. After reading the reviews I left out the tomato as they were going to be standing for a while and I didn't want them to be soggy. I also used flavoured cream cheese. They would also make a great lunch. Thanks

I'm sure I followed this recipe to the letter, and it was IMPOSSIBLE to make!  The tortillas cracked because there were too many other ingredients to roll inside them.  From what I could tell, they tasted okay, but nothing special.

Well Lolo I think the idea here is to get children to enjoy their favorite foods in a fun way. I've been eating sandwich wraps for years & would have loved if they were available when I was a kid. No plate to deal with, have them ready in a container in the fridge for a grab n go healthy snack!

I love that this is a very basic recipe that anyone can alter to their liking. I, personally, prefer spinach to lettuce, and enjoy playing with a variety of veggies- bellpeppers, olives, jalapenos, green onions, cucumbers, avocado... the list goes on! Play with different types of cold cuts as well! Or even leftover shredded chicken! Add some mustard! Hot sauce! Whatever you're in the mood for.

They are really good, even with Neufatchel (spl?) low fat cream cheese, but with that I added 3 TBSP of dry ranch dressing, and I also added diced red onion & shredded cheese.  I also made some with turkey, some with ham & some with both meats.  I'm sure roast beef or pastrami would also me good. If the recipe above is bland, try adding the 3 TBSP of ranch & it makes them really tasty.

I love the idea of shredded carrots.  I made up a bunch for an appetizer event in the late afternoon to go with beer and wine. My container came back empty. Compliments to "sal," who contributed this recipe (Thank you!).  However, I experienced panic before my event b/c I had never rolled a wrap before, and honestly, wasn't sure what was the best tasting flour wrap to buy. I felt stupid b/c I'm not a mechanical person, so I watched a video online of how to roll a wrap, but I only tore up my first wrap. I had to call for help on the phone to get someone over to help me figure out how to roll these. We got them rolled our own way, without fancy folds--just simply by rolling.By the way, I did add a package of Ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese. I also found that I had lots of lettuce, carrots, and tomato leftover. I ended up making a big lettuce salad and a separate carrot raisin salad for two.

Very good -- I used some suggestions from other reviewers -- made one version with Italian Roast Beef and Italian 5 cheese combo also added Italian season to the cream cheese -- in my opinion that one was the best version of all that I made.

I make pinwheels with cream cheese and tortillas all the time, and they are really good.  I have never tried turkey before.  This is going to be great for my son's school lunches!

You can do a lot of different things with this recipe.  I used garden cream cheese, sliced turkey and broccoli slaw.  Everyone liked these.

These have become my family's favorite quick supper! I do add a tsp of garlic powder to the cream cheese before I spread it on to give it a quick lift and sometimes I add some ham along with the turkey. Also, I found that using burrito shells works best as they make them larger and give more room to fill. By and by though these are a total favorite!!

I have to say that I loved them.  These wraps are wonderful and at least a bit healthy for the two boys that my boyfriend and I have every other weekend.  The thirteen year old (who eats like a sixteen year old) boy actually enjoyed them and even my boyfriend's other son (who is an extremely picky eater) ate them and seemed to like them as well.

Made this for a birthday party at work.  I arrived at 7:30 am an they were ALL gone by 9am!! Made them again and sprinkled a little Italian salad dressing on the lettuce for some more zing.  Everyone loves them and can't believe how easy they are to make.  This one is a keeper!

These were absolutely fantastic.  I know people hate it when you change a recipe (oh well), but I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese - so I substituted an olive tapenade for same.  So light and refreshing - a perfect luncheon sandwich for a hot summer day.  Thank you for the recipe - will def make again :)

Also good as a vegetarian roll-up!  I made this with just the cream cheese and veggies, and it was fresh tasting and delicious.  It can take many variations of veggie fillings and seasonings - I used lettuce, carrot, celery, snow peas, tomatoes, and scallions (green onions) with seasoned salt and pepper, topped with a little ranch dressing since I didn't have the powdered on hand.  Satisfying, and refreshingly different!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I scaled down the recipe and made a couple of sandwiches for lunches. Only change I made was using cooked cubed turkey and reduced fat cream cheese. I also used Trader Joe's handmade tortillas, only flour tortilla I like. Simple, easy, and like the added nutrition of the vegetables. ty

I am giving 5 stars because of the versatility of this recipe.  So many things you could do!  I mixed a little ranch with my cream cheese and used spinach herb wraps with turkey, lettuce, and tomato.  They were so yummy!  I can't wait to try with some more of everyone's suggestions!

I used the newly available Lavash bread available at Trader Joe's.  It's rectangular shaped making it perfect.  I didn't have tomatoes and thought it would make this too soggy, but I know that tomatoes are a must as it was a bit dry.  I think I will use a bit of Ranch dressing next time for a bit more taste.

This was a big hit with my husband but after my guest left there were quite a bit left.  I found it helpful to let the cream cheese soften up a bit to help with spreading and I removed the carrots from the receipe.  I probably will not make this again because I found it too messy when rolling up.

This is a really great recipe, I used the kind of tortillas that you can cook, which made it seem fresher, I also switched the lettuce with swiss chard and spinach! I LOVED it!

These were good and I thought they made for a nice alternative to a sandwich for lunch. I made sure to only use the meaty part of the tomato so there wasn't extra moisture. I made some with burrito sized tortilla's for others and one for myself in a smaller, corn gluten free tortilla. The corn tortilla was unappealing, so I actually made another one wrapped in lettuce - put the cream cheese right on the lettuce wrap and followed the directions basically the same. That was a lot better than the icky corn tortilla, lol.

This is so simple, good, and you can switch it up to suit your own taste.  I sliced the  tomatoes in half and switched out the carrots for cucumbers and red onion. I made them more of a sandwich and cut each roll in half.  I left the cream cheese plain but with the addition of the onion and smoked turkey there was plenty of flavour.  We will definetly make again in the future! maybe adding avocado or ranch dressing.

Absolutely wonderful! I am glad I did what other reviewers suggested by adding seasoning to the cream cheese. Had I not, the wrap would've been incredibly bland. I will definitely be making these again, and I highly suggest trying different seasoning for the cream cheese :)

Ok. Not a lot of flavor. Sprinkled some leftover Ranch powder. Next time I’ll probably add green onions or dill. Something to give it more flavor.

For simplicity and fast prep time, you can't beat this recipe. I made it for a church fellowship with only 15 minutes to whip it together. I shouldn't have worried as it took only 10! Incredibly fast and easy to make. I did add ranch dressing to the cream cheese for flavor, as some reviewers suggested, and left out the tomatos (I didn't have any on hand). Still came out great and there wasn't a scrap left over on the serving platter!

Great recipe! I didn't have all the ingredients, so for mine I just used cream cheese, lettuce, and ham. It probably would have tasted better if I had all the ingredients, but it was still tasty with what I had!

Awesome recipe!   I did make some substitutions, based on what I already had on hand.  I used ham rather than turkey, spreadable cheese instead of cream cheese, and a bagged shredded salad mix I already had for the veggies.  I also added some shredded cheddar, just because, lol.  They were a perfect lunch on a hot day, thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

I've made these for years. I would serve these as a sandwich lunch but most often I serve as a party food. I use lavish bread, roll up and cover tightly with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator for a few hours. Take them out to serve, cutting into one inch pieces and place on a platter on their sides to make a pin-wheel sandwich snack. They're just right that wY.

Since it was hot and muggy today I chose these for dinner. They were a snap to put together and were refreshing on a day like today.  I used smoked turkey and since I'm a cheese lover I had to add some sliced sharp cheddar and I used ranch dressing because I was too lazy to mess with the cream cheese. If you're feeling a little naughty these would be great with bacon. Very tasty!

Easy to make and tasty but a little bland.  By mixing spice into the cream cheese it tastes better.
