Very easy to make and the recipe was great as written.  I added 4oz. of cubed cheese the second time I made it for another tasty variation.

So easy to make.  This would be perfect for potlucks, picnics or any other gathering. I didn't have cherry tomatoes on hand so I chopped up some romas. A sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes work well with this too.
