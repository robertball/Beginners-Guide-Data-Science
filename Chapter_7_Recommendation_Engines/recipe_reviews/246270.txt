5 stars for any recipe that helps me clean out my fridge! I used black rice and made a couple of substitutions. For starters, prosciutto cotto instead of bacon as well as opted for Sriracha sauce instead of ketchup.  The butter was a bit heavy for me, so I will probably use a light oil next time. Thank you for the recipe.

Given this was considered an omelette recipe for leftovers I decided to use vegetables I already had.  I think salsa as opposed to tomato and ketchup would be a better idea.  I did not add any salt because the bacon is salty enough.

What a great way to use leftovers. It is fair to say that only onion, rice and peppers were my leftovers in my fridge for the rest I had to shop . I added to the recipe a clove of garlic as I think is delicious and goes so well with the vegetables and bacon. It is a very rich omelet but for my husband and my self it was a pleasure to eat and I'm sure I'll make it often.
