Yum!  I used store bought pizza crust and we saut√©ed Portobello mushrooms in garlic and olive oil to give them extra flavor and soften them before baking.  I also threw on some diced tomato and roasted garlic.  I love how easy this was, it's now a weekly favorite at our house.

BEST PIZZA EVER! Just writing this rating is making me drool, lol... Ok but I do have to say I changed the recipe ever so slightly.  First to cut down on time, I used a Boboli pizza crust.  Also, the family likes meat, so to get them to eat the veggies, I had to compromise and put some spicy Italian sausage on it.  Saute'd the onion and garlic with the sausage, skipped the garlic salt.  Putting it together, I just spread the sausage mixture on top, then the spinach, then mushrooms, the feta, the mozzarella and topped it all off with fresh basil ribbons, not dried! SOOO delicious! Try it and I'm sure you'll enjoy! Can't wait to have this again.  
LATER: This has become a regular in our house and no one gets tired of it! It is often requested.  Still as delicious as it was the first time... totally love it and wanted to say, because I forgot to before.... Thank You SOOOO much for sharing this recipe!!!

This was delicious.  Used store-bought crust mix and used some shredded provolone in addition to the mozzarella and feta.  Topped with some crumbled spicy Italian sausage because the boyfriend loves meat on his pizza.  Outstanding!

I had never attempted to make my own pizza until I saw this.  I made this for dinner one night to try something out of the ordinary.  It was delicious!  The crust was perfect- actually the whole pizza came out perfectly and it was really nice to look at.  I liked that there was no tomato sauce involved.  Will make again, and probably will add different ingredients to try something new.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

THIS IS REAAALLY GOOD. I don't even like spinach and I would cross a snake infested jungle for this pizza.  I like mine with black olives, and little parmesan, and a little bit of crumbled seasoned sausage.  Used frozen spinach it was still great!! I was able to freeze the whole pizzas by pre-cooking crust alone for 5 min at 425*, cool all ingredients, add toppings, "flash freeze" on the pan for 20 minutes, then wrap tightly and freeze for weeks... great results just like fresh.  Drizzle with a thinned pesto after it comes out of the oven( 1/4 c. olive oil, pinch of salt, 2 T. parmesan, dash garlic, and plenty of finely chopped basil) and you won't be able to stop eating it!!!

Love, Love, love this pizza. I used premade crust and added roasted red peppers. I doubled the spinach and mushrooms and used fresh basil. I'm on WW so used reduced fat cheeses and love this.  I will be making this often. . . too good to not have regularly! Thanks!

I used tomato basil feta and brushed the crust with a bit of garlic butter along with extra minced garlic.  Tossed on some chopped red bell for color. Wasn't crazy about the crust.  The high yeast to flour ratio gives a fast and puffy rise but because of the speed it ends up lacking in flavor.  An overnight rise in the fridge would greatly improve, at the least use garlic salt in the crust and add the basil there as well.

My review is for the topping and not the crust, since I use my own pizza crust recipe. I did sautee my mushrooms in some olive oil and fresh garlic. I also added some garden cherry tomato halves since my garden is full of them right now. Black olives too. I knew I would like this pizza but was surprised how much my husband liked it...Mr. Meat and sauce lover. I think that next time I'll wilt the spinach a tad with the mushrooms before topping, seemed kind of dry in areas where the tomato or veggies didn't moisten it. Thanks Wilma we enjoyed it.

I thought this tasted pretty good, but it was a little dry though. At the end I ended up spraying it with a little olive oil which did help. I already had a ball of dough from another Allrecipes recipe and just used that. I liked that it had 2 cups of spinach. I did only use about 1/2 of a small red onion, as that was what I had. It seemed to have plenty of onions. I don't like fresh mushrooms on a pizza, as they always seem kind of wet and spongy to me. So, I used a 4oz can of drained mushrooms. After I started eating it, I realized I forgot to add the basil. So, I just sprinkled some on the pizza to taste. Mine also baked in 20 minutes, but it may have been because I used my own pizza crust.

Hello Yummy! We used leftover frozen dough and rolled it out super thin, so it was like flat bread. My husband made the pizza, he used minced garlic, as we didn't have a clove of garlic on hand. He sprinkled a tiny bit of salt and garlic powder and basil. He also used mozzarella and feta. This was absolutely amazing pizza!!! Yummy!!!

I briefly sauteed the mushrooms in garlic and olive oil.  I used two cloves of garlic and my husband complained it was too garlicy.  I didn't add the additional garlic and garlic salt to the pizza, just what was in the mushroom mix.  I also didn't measure any of the toppings.  I used a thin crust boboli. I thought it was delicious.

LOVED IT! We omitted the onions, not big fans of them. Try it on the BBQ! Make the pizza dough, bbq on one side, flip it and put toppings on the cooked side and place the pizza with the uncooked side down to finish. Tastes amazing and keeps the kitchen cool!

I made a super lite version of this recipe and it was excellent. Used a fat free tortilla, sprinkled with garlic powder, add spinach, mushrooms,  red onion, fat free feta and fat free mozzarella. Yum. Bake for about 15 min on 400.

Used store bought crust to save time but the topping is seriously delicious! Basting the crust with olive oil and garlic powder is a must. No mushrooms or onions on hand used extra fresh garlic and fresh tomatoes instead.

This review is for the Toppings only as I bought pizza dough from the deli :) 

Overall review- YUM! I used spinach, 1 roma tomato slices, a white onion, feta, mozzerella and a bunch of spices cause that's what we had at the house. Going in to the over, I was a little unsure but man, it was delicious when I came out all bubbly. I used the AllRecipes garlic butter recipe for the base/sauce subbing feta for parm. This pizza was great, I think I'll start experimenting with it!

It was amazing!!!  Even my skeptical fiance loved it and said it was the best one he's had.  I added some pepperoni and linguica on his half of the pizza but my side followed the recipe to a T.

Great grown up pizza, next time I will double the Spinach and Onion- I like my pizza stacked with veggies.  Great recipe!

I used Ricotta cheese in place of the Feta - I personally don't like Feta. This was good, but I miss the marinara sauce...

This is a great pizza and the flavors meld wonderfully together. I agree, fresh basil is better if you can get it.

Used Flat-Out for the crust.  Added fresh sliced tomatoes.  Sprayed Flat-Out with PAM Olive Oil spray and sprinkled with garlic salt.  Baked @ 400 for 8 1/2 minutes.

by far the best pizza we ever made! I have added grilled chicken to the pizza with great success, but the original recipe is awesome on it's own. We use the store bought thin pizza crust and it comes out amazing! It has become a family favorite!

This pizza is divine. I used the "pizza without the red sauce" recipe by aimee from this website with it using basil pesto. Added tomato, grated onion, and tysons diced chicken and used canned pilsbury thin pizza crust. SOOOO yummy! I'll never make pizza the way I used to again! My husband was dead set on NOT trying this, once he did all he kept saying was "mmmmmm" :) Thanks for sharing!

Amazing!! I used Pillsbury Pizza Dough, spread it out on a greased pan and brushed a bit of olive oil on it. Added toppings (I also added a bit of sausage) and then cooked at 400F for 20 or so minutes. So good!

A wonderful pizza! I rolled the crust out a little thinner then suggested but it crisped up so nicely! And the basil and garlic gave it the perfect amount of flavour. I brushed some olive oil on the crust before adding toppings.  I also added some diced up cooked chicken on top for a bit of protein. I will DEFINATELY be making this again! 

Note: I didn't have a bread machine but making this by hand worked just as well!
