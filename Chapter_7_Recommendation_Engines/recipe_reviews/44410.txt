Very easy and very tasty! This is perfect for a nice summer meal. If you love tacos and you love pizza then this combination is for you! I used "Taco Seasoning II" from this site vs. using a packaged taco mix. I also saved time using a pre-made dough vs. making it homemade. I sauteed about 1/4 cup of onion along with the ground beef for a little extra flavor. After the "pizza" cooled a bit, I topped it with all the typical "taco" toppings to make it nice and pretty: shredded lettuce, chopped de-seeded tomatoes, sliced black olives, thin sliced green onion, and a few well placed dollups of sour cream and homemade guacamole! The leftovers are great too... that is is you have any!

We did these on the grill using tortillas instead of the pizza dough. Brushed the tortillas with a bit of olive oil, browned on one side, flipped them over and then added the toppings. Mexican food heaven!!

We use Tyler Florence's pizza recipe so I can't comment on this one but the idea to mix the refried beans with the salsa was a good one. We browned the beef and chopped onion together, added 1 cup of water and the taco seasoning and cooked it down as directed on the package. We warmed a can of refried beans with enough salsa to make it the right consistency to use as the base sauce. We put the beans down then the crumbled beef and cheese and cooked it in a 500 degree oven. We added chopped tomato and lettuce and piped sour cream over in a sandwich bag with one corner cut off when it came out of the oven. Best taco pizza we've ever had. Thanks for the idea.

A great recipe that is simple, inexpensive, and very tasty.  I don't have a bread maching so I used a store bought pizza crust (Boboli brand).  I also didn't notice that the recipe was for 2 pizzas until I started cooking.  I made 1 pizza using the full 1/2 lb of ground beef, and mixed the other ingredients as stated in the recipe.  While assembling the pizza I used what looked right to me - not necessarily half of everything.

The best thing about this recipe is the crust.  It really did turn out so well.  I will use the crust recipe in the future.  My only complaint with the topping is that the dominant flavor of this dish is the taco seasoning packet which just isn't my favorite.  You must really enjoy the flavor of packaged taco seasoning mix to like the finished product here.  I think it would be far better to follow the recipe and substitute your own spices (chili powder, cumin, garlic, a little oregano, etc.)

If you want a quick shortcut pizza, the toppings for this pizza taste just as good on either refrigerated canned pizza dough or refrigerated canned crescent dough. I like to use homemade taco seasoning, homemade refried beans, ground turkey (saves on your food budget and is a little healthier), sprinkle on some shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes and I cut the cheese back to a cup to cut back on the fat/calories. To make the refried beans easier to spread onto the dough, stirring in a quarter cup of reduced fat or fat free sour cream helps. GREAT for a quick, cheap dinner or even as a snack for parties. HUGE hit with almost anyone!

I love taco pizza! I tried this recipe to see if it tasted different than the recipe I usually use (they're very similar). I used a taco flavored meat sub. instead of ground beef, and also taco sauce instead of tomato paste and water. Tasted just like mine -- Fantastic!!!

Delicious!  I use flour tortillas for the crust as we like it thin, thin, thin.  Also, I mix the salsa with the refried beans for easier spreading.  Need to make this again, soon.

I finally found a taco pizza recipe that's a keeper! I halved the recipe and only made one pizza. I cooked the meat and onion together and skipped the extra taco seasoning with the meat. My only real suggestion is to bake the pizza crust a few minutes before adding the toppings, so the crust doesn't get soggy. I set out tomotoes, shredded lettuce, sour cream and crushed doritos (taco flavored) so we could each choose what to add on top.

Very good pizza!  I must admit that I did use another pizza crust - Jay's Signature Pizza Crust, a recipe from this site, because I only wanted to make one pizza since it is only my husband and I.  I cut the cayenne pepper in half in fear that it may be too much spice for us.  Once I rolled out the dough, I put some olive oil and garlic powder on it and pre-baked it for 5 minutes.  I topped the pizza with lettuce, tomato and crushed Doritos after it was done baking.

When our favorite pizza place stopped serving Taco Pizza, my husband told me I was going to have to come up with my own.  Thanks to you, I don't have to.  This was even better than the Taco Pizza at our favorite pizza place.  Wonderful!  I will make this again (and again, and again) for sure.
I have my own pizza crust recipe, that I got from my grandmother, but the rest of the pizza was divine.

Thank You!

While this is good, we did not like th refried beans.  We cooked the ground beef with, onion,jalapeno, and the taco seasoning, used pizza sauce, and mxed mozzarella, and cheddar cheese.
We also cooked the pizza unitl the cheese was lightly brown.
We did put lettucd, tomatoe and sour cream on top.  Yummy.

Best pizza I have had and the kids LOVED it!  I didn't realize the dough made 2 pizzas so I used all the dough and spread it on a large clay style cookie sheet and loaded it up.  It was deep dish heaven!!  I also took the advice of another and put my sour cream in a ziplock and trimmed the end off and drizzled it over the pizza. Can't wait to make it again.

I added crushed tortilla chips on top of the cheese after I took it out of the oven. Gave it a nice little crunch. Great recipe.

I made my own crust and made just one pizza...I used a little less cheese and added lettuce, tomato and doritos to the top of the pizza once it cooled a little.  My husband liked it though I think I'll try a different taco pizza recipe next time.

5 stars for the toppings 3 1/2 for the dough.  I did do it by hand still using the same ingredients.  This dough should have been pre cooked some.  The edges were VERY crispy but where the toppings were was a soggy mess.  It did not hold up and made it hard to eat.  Loved the idea though and would use these toppings on a different crust recipe maybe.

This was so good, and easy to make.  I don't have a bread machine, so I just made my own version of the crust.  I did the toppings as the recipe stated, and it was great.

So so so so good! Made this for a group dinner and it was GONE! The only suggestion that I got from anyone to make it better was the addition of chips on the side as apparently some people like chips on their taco pizza. Otherwise don't change a thing. It is fantastic!

This was good but I have to say for all the work that went into making it, it didn't taste any better than Jimmy's Mexican Pizza from this site that takes like half the time and uses flour tortillas instead of pizza dough. It was a little bland for me other than salt but I imagine that was from the taco seasoning. The dough was also rather bland so if you have a favorite already I would stick with it. Over all tasty but won't be made here again.

i don't usually rate something unless i'm giving it a good review, but I was so looking forward to this pizza & i was so let down.  The flavor was really kinda blah, & only after topping it with taco sauce,sour cream, gr onions, lettuce & tomatoes did it taste like a taco, & was (just)ok to eat. Perhaps it was the beans;while refried beans do appear in mexican dishes, i've never had them in a taco, & I know now, that i've no desire to.....sorry, but if it were called "mexican pizza" it might not have been so disapointing, but even then, the flavor wasn't very good....

I had never made one of these before, or even heard of it till my boyfriend brought it up one night. I have to admit..this was good. But I cheated and just used the Pillsbury dough in a can. Also we did have lettuce, olives, tomatoes, and sour cream for people to add to their own. Every body loved this recipe! And yea..I cooked the onion with the meat like some people said..worked great. My boyfriend wants to make this again, and put crumbled up tortilla shells on it..but I might try the Doritos..same thing..almost. LOL

We all loved this taco pizza.  I did as other had said and mixed the refried beans and salsa for the base.  Cooked onion with the meat then cooked with the seasoning, added the cheese and baked.  I let everyone finish how they liked it after it was cooked.  With 3 kids, they just put on it what they liked and everyone was happy!  Great alternative to just making tacos!

This pizza is EXCELLENT!  Only thing is it is a bit spicy so I only put 1/2 the amount of the chili powder etc. but my husband loves it!

I used a pre-baked crust & I used a reduced-fat Mexican cheese blend.  I added shredded lettuce, tomatoes & crushed fat-free Doritos on top before serving.  My husband was in hog heaven!

My son told me this was the best pizza I ever made! I used the Quick and Easy Pizza Crust recipe  and the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site. I omitted the chili powder and red pepper, because they're already in the taco seasoning mix, and I used 1 pound of ground beef and 3 cups of cheese. I made one 17-inch pizza instead of two smaller ones. I baked it 20 minutes. Excellent recipe. I will definitely make this again!!

Made our own crust.  Added 3 cloves roasted garlic to crust when adding warm water; added the rest of roasted garlic to bean-salsa mix.  Sauteed the onions when beef was almost done.  Did not add taco seasoning or water to beef and onion mix.  Layered beans, then tomato paste mixture, then beef/onion mix, then low fat 4 Mexican cheese mix and cooked at 500.  Added shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes (Greek yogurt to mine) and served with taco sauce.  DH loved it and it was yummy

This was tasty, although it was VERY spicy for my taste, and I did not add in any of the additional spices beyond the taco seasoning. Also, I used my non-stick pizza pan, but the crust stuck so thoroughly that I ended up prying it off and leaving the bottom of the pizza on the pan and then I had to soak the pan to get it off. Weird!

This was pretty good.  I do think it is necessary to add crushed Doritos, shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and taco sauce to make it four stars.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, DESHL!

I used a pre-made whole wheat crust for this recipe but followed the rest of it pretty close. I mixed the beans with salsa verde and mixed the tomato mixture with the meat b/c I didn't read the directions well. Alsi decreased the cheese to 2 cups which seemed to be just fine. Topped with chopped tomato, green onion, fresh cilantro and sour cream that I pipped on. YUM, thanks for the recipe:)

I made this for dinner last night and everyone - even my picky 3 and 5 year old kids - loved it! I mistakenly added 1 lb of ground beef to one pizza and although it wasn't horrible, it was too much meat. I would use 1/2 lb of meat for 1 pizza though. I also simply spread the beans on the crust and then spread salsa on top of that and finally topped with the meat. I baked it covered mozzarella/cheddar blend for 15 minutes and topped with lettuce, tomato, sour cream and more salsa. The end result was absolutely deliciouos and quick!

We absolutely loved this pizza! I used a black bean and corn salsa, and regular refried beans. I also topped it with lettuce, tomato, and olives, and sour cream at serving time. Delicious! I will definitely make this again!

A huge hit with everyone I've served it to. I used the extra dough to make cheese bread sticks (brushed dough with butter, topped with shredded and parmesan cheeses, baked with pizza) which were also a hit. I'll use this great crust recipe for other pizzas, too!

This was definitely a tasty pizza recipe.  I definitely would make it again.  I, however, made the mistake of trying to warm the lettuce and tomatoes in the oven for the final 5 minutes of baking.  That was probably a bit too much... Aside from that, it was quite good.

SOOOOOOOOO yummy!!! I did add on extra package of taco seasoning just because of personal preference.  I also used a medium salsa which added a bit more flavor.  Topped with tomatoes, lettuce and sour cream.  DELISH!

Love the idea behind this pizza. With a few personal changes this turned out awesome for my taste. First off I used Jays pizza crust. In place of the salsa I used a mild taco sauce. Left off the onion, used way more chili pdr, used ground turkey and used way less cheese. Then I topped with shredded lettuce, green olives and avacado.

Thanks DESHL, this taco pizza just hit the spot.  It is so hot outside, and this was a refreshing meal to have.    I do not have a bread maker so the time was cut in half by using pizza dough in the refridgerator section of the grocery store.    I made a 15 inch round pizza and cooked it on my pizza stone.  I took the advice of others and mixed my beans with 3/4 Cup picante sauce and 3/4 of the taco seasoning for my base and omitted the tomato paste.  Then I chopped 2 roma tomatoes and mixed them with a small can of sliced black olives and sprinkled this over the bean mixture.  Next I saute'd 1/2 white onion with 1/2 lb ground beef and remaining taco season mixture and sprinkled it over the pizza.  Last, I sprinkled 2 Cups Mexican blend cheese.  I forgot the doritos and am sure that would have wow'ed it even more.  My husband and I ate half the pizza.

Very good!  I also used my own pizza crust but the toppings are perfect.   I fried the onions and browned the beef in the onions as my family prefers them that way.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  A keeper for sure!  We also liked it after adding lettuce, sour cream and tomatoes on our pizza slices.

YUM! I can only rate this based on the toppings, as I didn't make the dough using this recipe because I do not have a bread machine. I used Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust off this site and it worked well with this. The only change I made to the toppings was to use ground turkey instead of beef. I baked as directed, then added crushed Doritos for the last few minutes of baking time. After it came out of the oven, I topped with chopped lettuce and a can of drained Rotel (I would have used fresh tomatoes, but was out). My fiance ate his with hot sauce on top and I put sour cream on mine. Really great base recipe that you can build off of to suit your tastes/cravings! Thank you :)

I am usually a stickler at trying a recipe to the letter the first try but I didn't have time to make the dough, so I used a store brand already made crust. And it was delicious!! This will surely be a regular meal in my home from here on out.

Made this for my husband and his friends for guy-night.  They all said it was "good". I sampled it and decided that it had not enough meat, too much beans, and too much red sauce.  Over all the flavor and the spice was "good" but needed something more.  They all agreed, but said I should tweak it and try it again.
I did have bowls of lettuce, more onion, salsa and sour cream, as well as Doritos for them to add, as they liked.

Next time I will use less beans, more meat, use hot taco sauce instead of paste and add more salsa.

I used this as a guide & really like the seasonings in the tomato sauce & salsa in the beans. Add what you like after baking (cilantro, crushed chips, lettuce, etc) and season to your own tastes. (Also made a whole wheat dough to make it better for my family)

My husband loved Taco Pizza.  When I make it for friends they are shocked by the idea but always end up loveing it.  One thing we add to ours is chopped lettuce, tomatos, onions and crushed up taco chips or dorritos.  Add anything that you would like in a taco and you can't go wrong.

excellent recipe.  I added more meat and put cilantro on top of the tomato sauce.  Also I added a little hot sauce and just a smidgin of sour cream to the top after it finished cooking.  Next time I make this I will probably cook the meat as though I was making tacos instead of just slightly seasoning it.  All and all I thought it was awesome.

THIS IS DELICIOUS!! I used refridgerated pre-made crust since I don't have a bread machine, and it was a little soggy because of all the toppings. But other than that it was perfect. We'll definitely be making this one again!

This is better than I remembered! Directions were very easy to follow and timed well.  Mine ended up needing 20-25 minutes to cook.  We topped ours (after cooking)with lots of chopped iceburg lettuce, fresh diced tomatoes, spring onions, sliced black olives, little more cheddar cheese and passed the sour cream and salsa!

I used premade crust. Homemade would probably make it better. I used paprika. I didn't have cayenne. Everything else was really good. I topped it with the usual taco toppings, except black olives.

Growing up, we had a local pizza place make a thin crust taco pizza, this recipe is close to how I remember it. Like the taco pizza from the restaurant, we crush nacho flavored chips, add sour cream and hot sauce on top after it is baked. Oh so good!

Yummy! It's a good thing my two boys went to the neighbors' for dinner, because there wouldn't have been enough for them after the three of us (daughter, hubby and I) ate our fill. :)

I can't comment on the crust I have a trusted recipe I use. Other than that I followed the recipe. Delicious! Topped with olives, diced tomato, lettuce, green onions and avocado.

This was amazing and super easy to put together! I used two packets of taco seasoning and a whole pound of ground beef. I also had to use onion flakes as I didn't have an onion. My husband was blown away! I can't wait to make this again!

I really enjoyed this. Made this with leftover pizza dough I had on hand. Used my own beans and green salsa that I pureed. Used chorizo instead of beef that I simmered in a bit of water with chopped onion & jalapeno. Used a combo of cheeses - mozzarella and cheddar. Turned out great, although got a bit soggy after sitting. Next time I would prebake the crust and not mix the beans and salsa, but put on a layer of each. I did not have any Dorito's on hand, but will add them next time as I can just imagine how they would enhance the dish.

well I'm rating this a two until i try it again ( YES I WILL TRY IT AGAIN) but the only reason why i made this was because i bought some of that refrigerated pizza crust that was on sale, on a hot hot and humid day. brought it into a air conditioned house and it exploded... i needed to use it quick.  the dough didn't seem to cook well. and today i took some off the pan and it was soggy. Maybe i'll just have to bake it longer next time, or try the home made crust that came with it

the flavor was over all prettty good

Was skeptical of this recipe at first, however I went ahead and made it as stated.  It was really good.  Added the lettuce and tomato after it was done cooking and it was perfect.

Dollop yummy. But I used 1 lb of ground beef and baked 5 minutes longer. It was still doughy in the middle. A tip: use a rolling pin to smooth out the dough. Way easier!!

Wow! This was so delicious! I added lettuce, sour cream and a small bag of crushed Doritos to the top. I seriously felt like I could have eaten the whole thing myself it was that good!!! I opted to use a boboli pre-made crust to save on time.

My family LOVED this!!!  Thank you for sharing!!  And it was super easy!  I didn't split the dough up for two pizzas-instead I just made one pizza with the dough because we like our dough a little thicker.  I can't wait to make this again. =)

This pizza was great and very easy to make! I dont have a bread maker, so I used a pillsbury pizza crust instead. I didn't pre-cook the crust before I cooked it this time, but next time I'd pre-cook for 8-10 minutes. I served it with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes (seeds removed), crushed nacho flavored doritos, and a special sauce made of ranch dressing mixed with taco seasoning to taste. My husband loved it - and he's generally a tough food critic! Thanks again for sharing!!

My family loved this recipe, both with and without the additional toppings.  The tomato paste "sauce" was okay yet I think I would need to tweek it a little more to meet our individual needs. I used the "Quick & Easy Pizza Crust" recipe from this website instead of the one listed and didnt have refried beans, nor really like them so I used mashed black beans instead.  Delicious!!!! Thanks Deshl for a great recipe

This was very very good and we'll definitely make it again.  I forgot to defrost the beef so I sauteed half a chicken breast with taco seasoning and the onions iinstead.  Also, used a store bought thin crust and about half the cheese to cut some calories and fat.  One cup of finely shredded cheddar was actually plenty to cover the whole pizza.   I served it with PJ's Fresh Corn Salad from this site and a salad of iceberg topped with salsa and sour cream mixed with jarred jalapenos.  Very very good meal.

I usually don't like to rate recipes if I didn't follow them closely, but this turned out so good that I wanted to share.  I made the crust as-is, cooked the meat mixture following the Daisy Brand Taco Salad recipe that doesn't use taco seasoning mix (from AR), used just plain salsa, and topped with chopped tomatoes, green onions, and olives.  SO GOOD!

i've been making almost this exact with leftover taco meat for years. I also like to set olive and crushed tortilla chips out as toppings. I cut down on time by mixing the beans with salsa and using store bought whole wheat crust.

I am not reviewing the dough, I used a frozen pizza dough, since I didn't have a bread machine (but my mom just bought one from a garage sale, so this dough might be the first thing we make!!) So my review on the rest of this taco pizza goes as : it's perfect don't need to change a thing. I have used a thin picante sauce, the real cheap kind in place of the water and tomato paste. This is one of my favorite pizzas!!!Oh and of course add crushed tortilla chips or doritos on top!

I am thinking that this is a case of user-error.  The recipe sounded great, but I've made this twice now, and both times I've had these problems: The dough doesn't get cooked all the way through, and ends up raw in the middle.  The bean mixture is over-seasoned.  It is sooooo salty.  It's very nearly inedible because of the saltiness.  But, every other reviewer loved it, so I think it may just be me.  I will keep trying this until I get it right, because it sounds delicious!

I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in the dough and mixed everything by hand (let the yeast proof in the water with 1 teaspoon of sugar first). I kept the toppings the same, except used taco sauce instead of the tomato paste/spices. My husband gave it to thumbs up. I thought it was just okay. The crust was so thick and dense, I think it would be better with a thinner/low-carb crust. I'll try that next time!

If I could give it 10 stars I would - excellent recipe and very close to a convenience store's feature taco pizza. Crust came out beautiful in the bread machine too...plan on trying just the crust to make regular pizzas as it was a great recipe with good texture and taste.  I added crushed Nacho Doritos to the top before serving, as the convenience store serves theirs that way and my kids loved it! Way cheaper...and VERY close in taste! Thanks for sharing and God bless you

Took the advice of adding chips (Doritos).  I used spicy nacho cheese Doritos.  Since my boyfriend is a vegetarian, I substituted the meat with morning star farms grilled crumbles.  i cooked the onion with the crumbles and a bit of the taco seasoning.  Used taco sauce instead of the tomato paste.  Added a layer of olives and chips before adding cheese.  Finished off with a layer of chips.   I also oiled the crust before adding tops to give the crust a crisp finish.   I made this last night and will probably make the other pizza tonight!  highly recommend!!!

I thought this was very tasty, the only difference is I used a store bought pizza dough, but made the remaining recipe to the letter.  If I make this again, I will definitely either add chopped jalapeno's or fresh roasted green chiles to the meat and cut way down on the sauce.  While the sauce was tasty since I used the Hot Taco Seasoning, it was just a little overwhelming on the pizza.  I tasted more sauce than meat or beans and would prefer a good balance of all three.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was great!  I did make some changes though that I thought would make the pizza what I was looking for:  Used a store bought crust that you add water to and then it is the perfect dough (make sure to cook the dough for about 6-7 minutes before you put the toppings on it), i sauteed an onion and then used ground turkey (healthier) and then added the taco seasoning to the meat mixture.  When I layered the pizza I put a can of refried beans down, then some salsa, then the meat mixture, then the cheese.  When I took it out of the oven, I added chopped lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream.  The only complaint that I have is that this was really heavy!  Next time I am going to use less turkey meat and less cheese.

Holy cow this was super good! We only put beans on one of the pizza due to some people not liking beans at my house but even they ended up preferring the pizza with the beans. Spicy foods go over well at my house so we also put a layer of jalapenos before we added the meat and cheese. The crust was pretty good, but I recommend put the sauce to the edge because that's the good part. Excellent recipe! Will make again soon.

We both loved this pizza.  I only made one pizza, but I did make the entire amount of dough.  There's plenty of recipes that called for pizza dough, so I just used it for one of those.  I halved all of the other ingredients except the meat, and I didn't really realize that until I was putting the meat on the pizza thinking there was plenty of meat to cover it!  I used mostly what was called for--I used my own taco seasoning (made the Taco Seasoning mix on here) and subbed ground turkey for the ground beef.  I topped after baking with lettuce and tomato as suggested, and bf additionally topped his with sour cream.  Very yummy, thanks!  Oh, and by the way, I love the dough as well.  For any other pizza, I'd probably add italian seasoning but it's perfect for taco pizza.  15 min was perfect to bake it.

I give this recipe 10 stars!  We love love loved it!!  I was full, but I didn't want to stop eating it, and my husband said the same.  The crust was perfect, the sauce was perfect, it was just great all around.  I did try some crushed doritos on one slice, and that was good, too.  But the best was dipping it into guacamole.  YUM!!!  I can't wait to make this for company.

I followed this recipe to a T.. but just did not care for it. I was hoping for a taste similar to the taco pizza I used to eat at Pizza Hut years ago, but it just didn't fit the bill. My boyfriend who normally loves anythign I make, said that he wouldn't mind if I never made this again.

This is a great recipe. I cut the time in half by using pre-made pizza crust. After baking the pizzas I topped them with shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes. I also doubled the hamburger to a pound. It was excellent!

This ended up ok, but I am quite unhappy with the recipe as written. I thought there was way too much refried bean mixture; when I layered on as much as I wanted, there was still a lot left over. I didn't think there was enough meat; I would easily doubled the amount. There was also not enough taco seasoning; again, I would have doubled it. I also thought that it would benefit from some jarred sliced jalapenos (put them on Husband's half). I added more sliced onion to my side.

This pizza is awesome! I've made it several times.  I now use pre-made thin crust, turkey hamburger and serve  lettuce, tomato, black olives and sour cream on the side.  Quick and easy and a big winner at the dinner table!

This was Terrific! Everyone in our family of 6 thought it ought to go on the Favorite Meals list (and it has already received requests to be made for  birthday dinners though birthdays are a long way off at this point). I served it with the shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and sour cream, as suggested. Those really *made* the meal for my husband, oldest child and myself. The younger ones liked it "as is". This will be showing up a lot at our family's table, I can tell you!

This recipe was simple and easy to make and delicious.  We topped ours with lettuce, tomato, onion, and crushed Taco Flavored Doritos.  It was excellent.  My husband doesn't like refried beans but he loved this pizza!

This was so good!  I added green onions to the top before baking.  I didn't have any tortilla chips or tomatoes at the time, but it would be really good with those on top after baking.  I was a little skeptical about this recipe at first, but I am so glad I gave it a chance!!!

AWESOME! I've been looking for a recipe for taco pizza for years since the pizza place we used to get taco pizza from closed, and this is it! I substituted ground turkey or chicken for the beef, and after cooking topped with lettuce, tomatoes, olives, sour cream, and some crumbled up tortilla chips, delicious!

This pizza is wonderful!  I used store bought crust and left out the cayenne pepper since I don't have a bread machine and I was afraid the pepper would be to much for my 5 year old.  It was so good, my daughter ate 3 pieces!  I also topped it with the crushed Doritoes and I don't think it would have been near as good without them.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

We modified the recipe a bit for our tastes by cutting the onions and refried beans, and adding more seasoning to the taco meat.  Since my wife can't eat beef, we also substitute with ground chicken and you can't tell the difference.  This is an awesome taco pizza recipe...the melding of both our favorite foods.

This was excellent! I used pre-made refrigerator dough and pre-baked the crust for about 7 mins. It turned out great!!

Loved this recipe, I used tortillas for the crust but  loved the toppings.  We grilled them & my husband & I both loved them. Topped with sour cream & lettuce.

Purchased a sprouted grain flatbread instead of making dough. Used about 3/4 cup of cheese instead of the 4 cups the recipe states.  Also, as a mistake, added the some of the salsa to the ground beef. Tasty!

I followed the recipie exactly, but after it was cooked, I topped it with some cut up lettuce, tomatoes, crumbled Doritos and a drizzle of taco sauce.  It turned out great and tasted just like the taco pizza my husband grew up on and a popular pizza place in the midwest.

recipe turned out as advertised, but not all that delicious.  Topping combination was good, but the crust is way to much bread for this pizza.  May be much better with a thinner, crispier crust.  Might as well just make tostadas..... less work and better results.

The genius of this recipe is mixing the salsa and beans together and topping it with seasoned tomato sauce. Too many recipes instruct us to spread the beans on, then proceed with salsa and meat, resulting in a heavy layer of dry beans. After trying one, I learned to mix the beans and salsa to form a more saucy base. I tried this recipe, adding the tomato mixture with the seasoning divided between the meat and the tomato as written, but found the seasoning was overpowering. Better to lightly season the sauce with a little chili powder and cumin, mix the entire seasoning packet into a pound of beef, and save the unused beef for another pizza or taco salads. Doing it this way I got a more balanced pie. I used a trusted crust recipe and nixed the onion, opting to use green onion as a garnish along with lettuce and tomato.

This was okay. I mean, it didn't really flow. It tasted like a bunch of taco ingredients on top of a pizza crust. Which, I know it was, but does anyone get what I'm saying? It just didn't work well for me. The flavor was fine, just not on a pizza, I think.

I used the dough recipe from simplyrecipes.com and I wanted to make a taco pie with my leftover dough. 

I came online as I didn't know what to use as a base for the pie and thanks to this recipe, I'm going to make a tomato paste, water, and seasoning mix like suggested but I'm going to add my leftover black beans into the mix and make something like a taco chili to spread on the pie. I'm going to grill the dough one on side before putting the toppings before grilling the other side-I'm sure it will come out great! thanks

This recipe turned out amazingly!! I don't have a bread machine, so I went to Publix and got one of there pre-made dough balls, but otherwise followed it to the letter and was extremely happy with the results. About to give it another go tonight, only we're substituting Chipotle seasoned steak for the ground beef. I cannot stress enough how amazing this recipe was, though. Definitely added to my cooking list

Very easy and very tasty, with lots of opportunity to substitute toppings based on what is available and seasonal.  I did add the taco seasoning to taste, probably about half the package, and additional cayenne pepper.

I admit it.  I skipped making the dough and bought a crust from the store.  I also switched the ground beef out for chicken.  I cheated on that, too, and got the fajita chicken that's already cooked, because I was in a big hurry to eat!!  It was delicious!  When it came out of the oven, I topped it with diced fresh tomatoes, lettuce, crunched up tortilla chips, and a little more salsa.  DELICIOUS!!

I'm not sure if I should even review this recipe, but for the sake of being able to remember which recipes were good.. I will! Used this as a basic plan for taco pizza, however I used a store bought crust. Then I did as another reviewer suggested and used a light layer of taco sauce instead of the tomato paste mixture. Topped with the refried beans/salsa mixture, then morningstar crumbles, then some homemade pico (onion, tomato, lime, cilantro, salt), and Mexican cheese. Baked according to the directions. When the pizza came out we added sour cream, pico de gallo, and crushed dorito chips to our individual slices. Will definitely make this again.

This is a great surprise. I used a pizza crust from my Cuisinart food processor cookbook. Made the tomato sauce - heaping tsp of chili powder, dash of cayenne, taco seasoning, scoop of salsa - cooked in a saucepan to meld the flavors. Then sauteed onion with sliced chicken sausage (2 links) and (half) Trader Joe's turkey kielbasa. Added the rest of the taco seasoning to that mixture. Layered the sauce, dolloped the beans, had corn from left over corn-on-the-cob, sausage and topped with mixed cheese (gouda, colby jack). Had Costana ranchero salsa on side and a cilantro chimichurri from Epicurious. Totally delicious!

Excellent recipe!  My son said, "This is the best pizza I've ever had!".  I don't have a bread machine - so I used Jay's pizza crust recipe from this site.  But these toppings were great.  We covered with fresh lettuce and served sour cream on the side and it was a hit!

I altered this by using whole wheat pitas for the crust, and I omitted the ground beef.  Was very good!  Will definitely make this one again.

I used leftover meat from the "Shredded Beef for Tacos" recipe instead of the ground beef and made one with beans and one without.  Both were very good but the kids preferred the one without the beans. I didn't have any tortilla chips otherwise I would have used them because this dish was lacking something.  Overall a great idea and crust recipe.

Finally something my whole family loved!!  I also put tortilla chip pieces on after the pizzas came out of the oven. I did not use the chili powder or cayenne pepper, because my kids don't like real spicy food.  This will definitely become a regular menu item in our household.

I used a different crust recipe, so I'm only reviewing the toppings.  This was a tasty pizza, but I think it's better with some changes.  It has the advantage of being easy to adjust, which is great because my husband and I have very different tastes.  He doesn't like veggies, so I left out the onion and salsa on his and increased the meat.  I piped sour cream on top of his pizza and topped it with crushed Doritos.  He liked it, but I don't think it's a favorite.  On my pizza, I followed the recipe and then topped it with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, and Doritos.  The spices were a little strong for me, so I'll use less of the tomato paste mixture on my pizza next time.  I'm a veggie-lover, so I thought that the tomatoes and lettuce were crucial ingredients.  However, they kept falling off the pizza!  I don't want to put them under the cheese because I think they're better uncooked, but the pizza is hard to eat with the lettuce and tomato piled on top.

When all the local pizza joints stopped serving taco pizza, I went searching for one I could make myself. This is the 4th recipe I found and tried and the last one I'll ever need. I don't understand reviewers that change everything then leave a rating but I don't have a bread machine or patience so I used store bought pizza crusts on this one and it is still SOOO delicious. It is the perfect combination of flavors. Occassionally I add a little shredded lettuce and diced tomato on top after cooking but the pizza is delicious without it. Great recipe!

Yum! I think this recipe is better than the pizza place! You can adjust how spicy you want it to be by adjusting the amount of taco seasoning, and the type of salsa you use. I've had alot of taco pizzas from the pizza places with some being too spicy, and my kids can't have any.This is a great recipe-very filling!

My husband and I instituted a family tradition of Fridays being Pizza Night to celebrate the coming weekend. As a result we are always looking for fun new pizza recipes and decided to give this one a try for our taco pizza attempt tonight. We both liked it very much and I made it mostly according to the recipe. The changes were that I made my own taco seasoning and omitted the extra chili powder and cayenne pepper, left out the beans (my husband won't eat them), made my own salsa from fresh roma tomatoes, cilantro, onion, lemon juice and salt and added a little sugar to the dough. The dough tasted more like bread than pizzs crust, but it was good. I liked the sauce, which I mixed with the salsa and will probably add a little more of it next time. I also used sliced fresh hot and bell peppers on top, fiesta cheese mix and made it into a big thin crust pizza on a cookie sheet instead of making 2 round pizzas. Very good!

Love this pizza! Used store bought crusts and added black olives and additional onion to the top. Also used a combo of cheddar and salsa jack cheeses. Only complaint was the amount of cayenne made it too spicy for me (yes, I'm a spice wimp). Kids and boyfriend ate it up though. He had 4 pieces and that's the most I've seen him eat in one sitting. Good stuff!

Good recipe.  Next time I will not melt the cheese on top.  I will add it after it is baked and put some shredded lettuce and dollops of sour cream on top.  Overall, a good start!

I thought this was very good. I used store bought crust as well and used enchilada sauce mixed with the taco seasoning. I made one with the crushed Doritos and one without. I had a new BBQ flavor ones and didn't know if they would taste ok or not. The one with the Doritos was definitely more flavorful. Topped it with Taco Bell hot sauce and sour cream. I thought this tasted a lot like Taco Bells encharito which I love. Thanks for sharing.

This was terrific and easy!  My kids aren't crazy about hot things so I decreased the spices and it was fine.  If making it for myself, I would probably leave it as is!  Thanks for a creative recipe that didn't have canned soup as the main ingredient!

Very tasty.  I used Pillsbury Pizza Crust and adjusted the cooking times to those on the can.  I also used refried beans with chipotle, green onions, and some pepperjack cheese.  Very easy to prepare.

This was wonderful. I ran out of refried beans so I just mashed a can of plain pinto beans and added cummin. I have two kids who would not eat this so I used 1/4 of the dough to make them a traditional cheese pizza and then I used the rest of the ingredients to make one large taco pizza. My husband and I along with two children who ate it liked it. Very tasty, I will make this again.

Pretty good.  A little messy with the beans and sauce, and my guests didn't gobble it up like with the bbq chicken pizza.  Oh well, I liked it.

I thought this turned out really good! My family enjoyed it also. Sliced up very nice and kept its form:) The only complaint that I have(along with the rest of the family) is the sauce. There just seemed to be to much tomato paste. Next time I will cut this in half.

I love this recipe. I made this for company and they said that I couldn't make it again unless I was inviting them over. I could have cooked the crust a bit longer, but it was still an excellent recipe.

So yummy! My family loved it. Add some crunched up taco or black pepper jack doritos to the top for a crunch.You also have to have Ortega hot sauce to put on top! That's how they serve it at a pizza place where I grew up.

We just didn't love this recipe.  Seemed like it was missing something, IF I try it again, I might try baking the pizza with the green peppers, onions and tomoatoes on it, instead of adding after cooking.  Adding the sourcream as a topping did help, but just didn't do it for us.  Sorry.

This was so good and tasted similar to a local pizza place's original taco pizza.
I used a pre-baked pizza crust to amazing results and cut the time for preparation.
Top it with crunched-up Salsa flavor Doritos; garnish with taco sauce, sour cream and fresh snipped cilantro. HEAVEN! Thanks for your creation.

This was very good.  The family loved it.  I didn't have refried beans, and it was fine without them.  I used a hot and spicy taco packet, and would have rather used hot salsa, but the kids cramped my style.  Good recipe.  Thanks!

Tasty! Avoiding having to clean my bread machine I opted to use Jay's Signature Pizza Crust (another allrecipe winner) and this pizza was perfect. I took the hint and added shredded lettuce and diced tomato and my family devoured dinner! Thanks so much for sharing.

This is a better taco pizza than I get from a certain national chain pizza place!  Delicious!  We added extra taco seasoning and topped with crushed tortilla chips.  We served it with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and taco sauce and we'll make it many more times.

I tried this last night.  It was a hit!  I did add more taco seasoning to both the meat and the tomato sauce.
