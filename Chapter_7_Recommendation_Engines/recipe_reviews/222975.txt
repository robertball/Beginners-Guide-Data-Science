This was intriguing, because I make a black bean and corn salad from this site, and so I know that we like the combination.  I guess the salad kind of spoiled us, because it is sort of "zingy" from balsamic vinegar.  This recipe was good, and I feel everyone should have some "desperation" dinners they can pull out of the pantry and have ready in a few minutes. However, this was was a little bland for us.  DH actually put some balsamic vinegar on his, and he said he liked it better.  It's a pretty dish, without any heat, but I would add lime instead of lemon, some garlic and a few drops of balsamic vinegar to liven it up a little.

This was delicious. The family loved it. The black bean and corn mixture really made the dish! I plan on using it for other dishes, it could be good just by itself.  This is a keeper!

This is such a fantastic recipe! I often bulk it out a bit by using more onion, a couple of different colored peppers etc; adding a can of pinto beans doesn't hurt either. More often that not I make it more as a stew - dice up the chicken into bite-sized pieces, brown them in olive oil, then throw in the rest of the ingredients (except the avocado, of course) and let it do its thing. Great with regular white rice, and the leftovers are superb in warm flour tortillas. So good!

Great recipe; the only changes I did was to leave out the cilantro (hubby doesn't like it) and I added a can of diced tomatoes.

Haven't found a Goya recipe that has failed me yet! This is full of flavor and full of freshness!  The Goya Black Beans mixed with all the fresh vegetables became a Summer Easy Dinner at it's best. Don't change a thing, don't forget the lemon at the end and like I always say if Green had a flavor it would taste like cilantro. Green things up!

Tried this last night with only minor changes.  Cubed the chicken breast, topped with fresh salsa and served with a side of Mexican rice.  The whole family enjoyed.

Loved this.  Served with a small side salad, made a healthy meal.  Very easy to make.  Will definitely make this again.

We had mixed reviews on this at our house.  I thought it was great, my husband thought it was average.  What can I say?  If we were all alike, it would be a boring world.  I used an orange pepper so it wasn't as  colorful but it was a tasty.

Love this recipe but changed a little, didnt add the cilantro or lemon but added some taco seasoning  to replace it. Tried a similar recipe but hated the tangy taste.

Delicious!  I substituted cumin in place of turmeric in the adobo seasoning, since I was out.  Also I didn't have a red onion, so I used a sweet yellow onion.  It was still a wonderful meal that I will make again with less beans per my hubby's request.

Only gave it four stars because I forgot the lime juice.  Super easy and fantastic taste.  It recommends pairing with salad or cornbread, but think the veggies, fruit and starch are a perfect combo with the chicken.  The only thing I'd add would be a frozen marguerita.  This is going into a chicken recipes and will be a favorite staple.

I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out, but it was surprisingly good! I only used a half avocado, but there was room for more. Pretty easy dish - the longest part is cooking the chicken.

I love this dish! Rather than buying yet another spice blend, I just use whatever "fiesta-style" spices I am in the mood for. Everything blends together for a great overall flavor.
