I'm so glad that you decided to share this recipe. I will never have to look further for another poppy seed cake recipe.  It was absolutely delicious.  This cake is so moist it melts in your mouth.  I did glaze it with a poppy seed glaze.  I used 1 cup of powdered sugar, 2 Tbl spoons milk, a dash of vanilla extract and a tsp of poppy seeds and while the cake was still warm not hot I drizzled the glaze over the cake. Awesome! Natalie

This is a great tasting, moist, easy, and big cake that even my husband (who NEVER cooks) made with much success for his tennis club pot luck supper.I've tried other more complicated "from scratch" poppy seed cakes and this is better in addition to being quick. Already have made it several times.

I add a tsp. of almond extract to the batter, and I glaze the cake with a quick powdered sugar glaze, then press sliced almonds all over the cake.  The combination of orange and almond flavors are soooooo good.

This is the best!  I have made other poppy cakes on this site, but the sour cream and orange juice in this one (and I sneaked in 1 t. almond extract)make this delicious!  I glazed it with some oj, powdered sugar, and almond extract.  Melt in your mouth!  I will make again.  Mine only took 35 minutes to bake.

I took this to work, for a bake sale, and came away with an empty plate.  Everyone loved it, and commented on how moist it was.  I tinkered with the recipe a tad, adding the fresh zest of one orange to the batter.  Also, going on some of the other reviews, I made a simple glaze of powdered sugar and orange juice, with a little orange zest added in, and drizzled that over the cake. Yum!!

This cake is fabulous. I tweaked it a little. I used 1/2 cup orange liquor or rum and 1/4 cup orange juice, added 1/2 cup chopped pecans. Everyone raved over it.

Good with lemon cake mix & lemon pudding, drizzled with a lemon/conf. sugar glaze.  (Gave 4*'s b/c the cake was not as dense as I would have liked, but would make again.)

Wow, this is good, moist cake!  I used canola oil, instead of veg. oil.  I made a glaze for the top, o.j. and conf. sugar.  Kids said "Best cake ever!".  There you have it!

Fantastic!! Moist and flavorful.
I followed the recipe exactly and then decided to add a glaze to the top. 
I mixed 1/4 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp butter flavoring, poked holes in the cake and drizzled it over the top. 
It was SO GOOD!!

Very nice cake that I will make again.  Based on the advice of others, I added a bit of almond extract as well as some orange extract, because I like a strong orange flavor to come through. The next time I make this, I may add some grated orange peel as well.  I also added a little food coloring to make the cake a prettier orange color. I only used 1/8 cup of poppy seeds, which seemed plenty.  I made a glaze of powdered sugar and orange juice to top it all off, and the cake was even better the next day after sitting in a big puddle of the glaze overnight.

This has been a family favorite that my mom used to make!  If you want a little bit of a change, it's also super yummy to "flour" your cake pan with cinnamon/sugar mix.  No glaze needed if you do it this way!  Just an option :)

This was delicious!! So happy I tried it... I added one t. Almond extract -- love to use that flavor ... Everything else was very much by the recipe. I had xtra large eggs, so I may have used slightly more than four regular, but all was good! I also soaked the poppyseeds in milk for a couple hours before adding. I used a springform pan rather than a bundt -- it took about 45 minutes to bake. I was worried it baked too long, but it came out perfect! I made this for my mom's bday and topped it with a cream cheese frosting that turned out perfect! Might make again this week just to use up the leftover frosting I have!! Yum!

I'm making this right now; & I absolutely love the batter (the sour cream eliminates the 'sweet' taste). I didn't have OJ or poppy seeds to add, so I went w/out those.  I did use an 8 oz. container of sour cream-I bought the 'light' by mistake. I also used a package of Duncan Hines Signature Fudge Marble Cake Mix; instead of taking part of the batter to add the chocolate mix to, I added the choc. mix to the whole thing (I know that sounds odd, but then it won't be too chocolatey).
