I skipped the green pepper and used onion instead. Just one jalapeño, seeded.  I felt like this recipe works just fine with about half of the sausage and cheese.  The family, which doesn’t generally eat grits, did eat this.  I will definitely make this again.

Here's one of those reviews that changed much of the recipe, but the flavor . I had left over pesole, saw this recipe, didn't have sausage but had chorizo.  Added mushrooms and spinach.  Ate for breakfast with pancakes and maple syrup.  Awesome blend of sweet with savory and spicy.  Really good any really easy.

Super delish!  I cut back on the green pepper and used about 25% less cheese, plus my jalapeños were small.  My kids loved it.  ...Oh, I used 2% milk plus a pat of butter instead of heavy cream.

I had a similar dish at a potluck recently but couldn't get the recipe so I started searching based on ingredients.  I think this is the one!  Turned out great.  Substituted fat free evaporated milk for the whipping cream.  made one batch with spicy sausage and jalapeños and one batch with mild sausage and mild green chiles.

Every time I do a pot luck the requests for me to make this come flying in for me to bring in the grits!
