Wow!  This recipe sounded good but I didn't realize what an impact it would make at dinner time.  I've known my husband for close to 15 years and have been cooking chicken for him about as long. He said this was the best chicken I've ever made!  I did tweak the recipe  by adding a tablespoon of sugar during cooking, and then adding a 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch mixed in a little soy sauce at the end to thicken the sauce a bit.  Yummy!  I will certainly make this for guests sometime.

We really really liked this alot.. I made a couple changes..I added just a pinch of ground ginger.. after I mixed all the ingredients I threw them all in a Ziploc bag along with some fresh sliced mushrooms and some chopped green onions..I let everything marinate for about 30 minutes in the fridge before I cooked it.. I used boneless,skinless chicken thighs so it only took about 45 minutes to cook.. My husband isnt a big rice fan so I just served it over some green beans and a nice salad.. I think the mushrooms and the onions made all the difference..

I read other reviews & therefore made adjustments to enhance the flavor of this.  I added a little lemon juice to the sauce, and then marinated boneless breasts in it for a half hour before baking.  I baked for 45 minutes and that was plenty of time.  I put the chicken on a rack in the pan & basted frequently.  By then end the rest of the sauce cooks away and would make a mess on the pan if it isn't non-stick.  The chicken comes out quite good, nice for those who like orange.

This is very tasty and flavorful. The sauce is so goopd I would double if you want to serve over rice because there isn't much left after cooking.  Pork cops would be a great meat to try cooking this way.  I have tried both thighs and breast and they were great.  I liked the breast this way because I always find them dry in some recipes.  Bernie

The finished product was just alright - there wasn't a strong orange flavor and the onion soup made it too salty, overtaking the orange.  I probably won't try this again but if I did, I wouldn't use the onion soup.

This is my kind of recipe. Nice and simple, yet really tasty. My husband and I loved it. We doubled the orange juice and the soy sauce. Thanks for a great recipe for a family on the go!

Very tasty; not bland at all or too salty.  Didn't taste like orange, but the OJ (I used fresh-squeezed) made the sauce sweet.  I used 3 teaspoons minced garlic and didn't add extra sugar or cornstarch; the sauce was thick already and almost boiled down to the bottom except I added water halfway through roasting.  I marinated for 1hr 15min beforehand, and used Lipton's Golden Onion soup mix (1 packet is 1.3oz, which might be why the sauce was so thick.)  I also added 3 chopped green onions.  Overall, a hit: will probably make again.

wonderful. I used ginger root and garlic clove crushed and marinaded it for several hours. 
at the last I splashed about 2 tblsp sherry into the gravy. 
thigh meat works best.

Made this for my family and served it over rice - they loved it!  Very, very quick prep time.  After the thighs were done cooking, I thickened the sauce with flour and served it with the chicken.

This was great but if you want to get more orange taste all you need to do is cut some of the orange juice and replace it with the juice of a real orange and add the zest of the peel. Zest makes all the difference folks. The oil from the zest of citrus fruits is some powerful stuff. Anytime you use citrus flavors add some zest to get more flavor.

I made this with fresh OJ, but the dish didn't have any orange flavor.  The onion soup was over powering.  Didn't do anything for the dish other than make it extremely salty.  It was easy, but I will be looking for another Orange Chicken recipe to try.

Yummy!  I read the other reviews and made some adjustments.  I added another cup of orange juice, additional tablespoon of soya sauce and replaced the garlic powder with minced garlic.  I also added a teaspoon of ground ginger and chopped green onions.  Then I marinated the chicken thighs for 1/2 hour and baked for 45 minutes (basting the chicken every 15 minutes).  We had lots of sauce which was great to pour over the rice.  My husband loved this dish!

Fantastic flavor!  My husband loves this and asks for it often.  If I have it on hand, I use orange juice concentrate instead of orange juice and will also add orange zest if I have it.  That really brings out the orange flavor.  The onion & orange flavors are great together.  One of our all-time favorite recipes.

This was good, not great only because we aren't big fans of chicken thighs. Will try again with chicken breast...Very easy though. I did let mine marinate in the juice mixture for several hours. I took the other suggestions and doubled the juice part so we could have a sauce with rice. The orange flavor was a nice change.

My alterations:  I used fresh chopped onions instead of the dry mix (too much MSG and salt) and used thawed orange juice concentrate instead of the OJ.  Made for a much more intense orange flavor.  My husband ate half the recipe! Very easy and I will make it again.

I have to watch my sodium intake so I use Goodman's Low Sodium onion soup mix and lower sodium soy sauce.  I've served it to guests and don't have to apologize...it's salty enough and really delicious!

I made this about 3 months ago for my family, and my dad is still talking about how delicious it was. We loved this recipe! The one mistake I made was using chicken that had the skin still on. Next time I will use tenderloins or skinless chicken breast. Neverthelelss, we all just took the skin off of the chicken and drenched the meat in the sauce. It was absolutely delicious and everyone went back for seconds!

This recipe is so quick and easy and has wonderful flavor and is very, very, moist. However, I did not bake in the oven I used my crock pot. Put chicken in the bottom and seasoned, then poured liquid over the chicken.  Came home from work later that afternoon and the house smelled wonderful.  Had with rice pilaf and green beans.  Will make again!

I was a little worried about this recipe because the sauce mixture had kind of an unpleasant smell when I first put the ingredients together, but WOW! I am so glad I tried it becuase the sauce is PHENOMENAL over rice. Even my boyfriend, who is normally not a "sauce person," commented on how good the sauce was with rice as he gobbled it up. 

The reason I'm giving this recipe 4 instead of 5 stars is because I thought the chicken itself could've been more flavorful. It was pretty good as it was, but I think it would've been even better if the recipe had said to marinade the chicken prior to baking so that it has time to seal in more flavor. 

That said, it was still a great recipe, and I'm definitely going to double the sauce next time. I think I'm also going to try the sauce with salmon some time. 

Thanks for the recipe! 

P.S. I used Sunny D instead of "real" orange juice in my sauce, and it was perfect. Some reviewers had mentioned adding sugar to the sauce mix to make it a little sweeter (I didn't), and I think the amount of sugar in the Sunny D made it just right without adding anything else to the recipe.

SUCH an easy recipe, but it tastes impressive enough for guests. Makes a great sticky sauce and suits chicken perfectly.  Turn chicken in the sauce periodically and don't skimp on the cooking time; the chicken was nearly falling off the bones after an hour and a half.  Beautiful!

This is super and super easy to make. It is great for a night after work when you are tired,  but can wait while it bakes. I make some rice in the rice cooker and wind down while it cooks.

This is a great dish - a different take on chicken. Reading reviews I made a few adjustments – I used one tablespoon of the onion soup mix, doubled the rest of the ingredients – cooked it the first time with chicken thighs, for myself . . . (husband doesn’t do chicken thighs!). Then took the chicken out - with the liquid - following one of the reviewer’s advice – used a cornstarch slurry to thicken the sauce – that made the sauce ‘stick’ so to speak. Very tasty. I am actually making the same dish tonight with chicken breasts (my husband likes) for our dinner tonight! I did everything about the same – added about a teaspoon of honey this time.

So glad I tried this recipe.  I doubled the orange juice and added some cornstarch to thicken gravy when I took out of the oven.  Served over white rice.  Everyone loved it.

Following other reviewers advice I used OJ concentrate instead of juice.  I used 4 boneless cutlets and baked it in an 8x8 baking dish.  This allowed the chicken to be almost totally covered the entire baking time, thus no basting.  Chicken was flavorful and moist (baked it an hour as suggested) and the sauce was thick enough for us without adding any thickening agents.  Easy recipe that will go into the rotation!

Wow! This was so easy to prepare and we loved the flavor! I used skinless boneless chicken breasts and it was great! Definately a keeper in my recipe box! I think next time I'll marinate the chicken breasts for a few hours before cooking. We didn't think it was too salty at all as reviewed earlier. Thanks so much for posting this Janet...it's YUMMMMMY!!!

I did not marinate bc the recipe did not call for it. I was wrong. The chicken needs marinade. I put green beans & mushrooms in the baking dish w/ the chicken. WOW! The vegetables were GREAT! I think the chicken would be that good w/ marinade.
The photo is before cooking.

This was a pretty good recipe. The chicken had good flavor, although it was a mild flavor. Maybe soaking the chicken a few hours before baking would help? I poured off the liquid when the chicken was done, skimmed off the grease, added some brown sugar and thickened with cornstarch. That was pretty good. I served it over rice, and it had a lot of flavor. I may make this again, but will definitely marinate the chicken before baking it.

Very easy to make and tast good.  I ate some chicken too soon.  The sauce wasn't that thick at that time.  I realized that the sauce would get thick if you cook for what the recipe says.  The chicken tasted better the next day.

Certainly not what I expected, but pleasantly surprised.  Now, knowing how salty these onion soup mixes are, I only used 1/2 envelope & that was plenty.  I used 1 small clove of fresh garlic and I also peeled a mandarin orange and added it to the chicken about 10 minutes before removing it from the oven.  Covered bake time for my chicken was 35-40 minutes!  By the way...I used 2 boneless chicken breasts pierced the chicken breasts with a fork and marinated the chicken (in the fridge) in this unique mixture for about 1/2 hour before popping it in the oven.

Ok, first I will say I have very diverse taste buds. I am always willing to try new flavor blends, new recipes etc. The ingredients, for the most part, sound like they would meld beautifully. I did not care for this dish at all. I could find nothing redeeming in any part of this. Following directions of those who used the oj concentrate, ginger, adjusting the soup mix....The taste was strange at best. Sorry folks, just did not understand this dish, nor do I plan to "try again" to give it that second chance.

Made this and it is a real keeper! I used orange juice concentrate, about 2 Tablespoons, added to the orange juice to give it a bit more of an "orange kick" after reading the reviews before me. This worked nicely, and still it didn't have an overwhelming orange blast, just enough to make it nice. I placed my thighs (used 5) into an 11x7 pyrex dish, because that's what I had available. It made a nice amount of drippings. One point: cover with foil for the first bit of cooking, as the little onion bits kind of burnt on top of the thighs as it cooked down. All in all, this is a lovely recipe and I will be doing it more often! --Cakelady

I made this last night for dinner.  It was just OK.  My husband said that it was "different".  The finished product was not pretty enough to serve to guests but baking for 45mins made it very juicy and tender.  I will won't be making this again.

Very good!  After reading other reviews, I omitted onion soup mix but added dried onion and 1/2 tsp salt. Used boneless thighs that I marinated for about 2 hours. Only needed to cook about 1 hour. Husband loved it. Will definitely make again.

After reading many reviews, here are the changes I made to the recipe. First, I made sure to trim as much excess skin from the thighs but leaving enough to cover the meat. Second, I mixed 1 and half cups of OJ, 2 tbsp of soy sauce, 1/2 tsp of ground ginger and 3 smashed cloves of garlic in a measuring cup. I poured mixture over the thighs in a 9x13 glass dish and marinated for 3 hours. Baked chicken as directed. It turned out terrific. The skin was crispy, the meat was tender and flavorful. There was enough marinade to use for spooning over rice, if desired. My husband and I really enjoy the outcome. The recipe is a good basic recipe that's easily adjusted for personal tastes.

I think my fiance and I might be the only one's who weren't wowed by this recipe but to us there was something "off" about it.  On the chicken, the sauce was pretty good, but when we poured it over our rice and broccoli, it just didn't taste right at all.  I think the onion soup mix really overpowered the other flavors in the sauce, even when I added more orange than the recipe called for.  My fiance and I both agreed that this was just okay, but probably not something we'll make again.

It's not that this dish was bad, it's just not what I thought it would be, and that's probably my fault.  I thought that the sauce would come out more like a glaze.  Instead, it's pretty much boiled chicken sitting in very liquid sauce.  It didn't taste bad, but no one was thrilled.

I made this using only 4 bone in skin on thighs. After reading the reviews I decided to marinade the chicken in the orange juice for 40 minutes before baking. I baked it for 40 minutes using convection. It turned out perfect, I did add a little cornstarch to the suace to thicken it. Added green onions the last 15 minutes of cooking. Served it with couscous and green beans. The dish was very pretty. My bf said it looked great and tasted amazing. I'll definately make it again.

I really enjoy this recipe, although I do cut back on the soup mix and only use a half of an envelope. This causes the chicken to be much less salty and allows the orange flavor to come though.

Last night was the second time I cooked this recipe. My husband, mom, & I liked it much better this time around! The chicken was moist (as it was the last time) but I added more to the recipe. I used 3 boneless chicken BREASTS & added 1 1/2 cups of orange juice, 1/2 a packet of dry onion soup mix (as directed), a pinch of garlic salt, a pinch of ginger, & 2 1/2 TABLESPOONS of soy sauce. I marinated the chicken in this mixture for 7 1/2 - 8 hours in the refrigerator, then poured everything into a 9x13 baking dish & baked @ 350 for 35-40 minutes. It came out perfect!! It had a delicious orange flavor & you could taste the tang of the soy sauce. I will definitely be cooking this again!!

Tasty and easy to make.  Recommended adding a little extra orange juice to make the sauce even orangier.  Also, agree with the reviews to cook boneless chicken for only 45 minutes instead of the hour the recipe says.

Well, the onion flavor of the soup is very over powering, I barely could taste the orange.  If I ever make this again I will use just a 1/2 pkg of the onion soup mix.  I had frozen blsl thighs so I put them in a casserole, poured the sauce over and covered and baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  I then uncovered and baked 30 more minutes, the chicken was very tender and juicy, but just not enough flavor.  And.. I don't know what I would add to give it the oomph it needs.. oh well.

This is a great recipe! I followed the recipe to the letter (changing thighs to breasts) and my family loved it! I have made it a second time (at my husband's request :) and the second time I doubles the "sauce" ingredient amounts so there would be extra for the pasta. Thanks for something different!

I followed the advice of others using OJ concentrate rather than regular OJ and since so many commented that it was too salty, I used low sodium soy sauce and only half of a packet of the onion soup mix.  I baked the boneless thighs for 45 minutes without the sauce then I drained the liquid in the pan.  I then topped the chicken with the orange sauce and continued baking for another 15 minutes.  By draining all of that liquid that comes off the chicken thighs, the sauce was thick enough.

WOW!!! I didn't expect such a simple recipe to be so tasty!!  As per other's suggestions, I doubled the o.j. and soy sauce and added  two chopped scallions. Sine I had the time, I placed the eight chicken thighs and about 2/3 of the marinade in a ziploc bag and placed in fridge for 2 hours. Instead of baking in the oven, I placed it on the rack of my slow cooker/roaster oven on 350 and basted every half hour with the extra marinade.Cooked for about one hour and 20 mins. and served over rice Deelicious! Even better the next day after mixing all leftovers together in same tupperware in frdge overnight.This is a keeper!!!! Thanks, Bev!

Very easy to make, but light on flavor.  Next time I will use only orange juice concentrate, and not the juice.  I might use zest and more ginger, soy, and garlic, too.

This recipe was VERY easy and very yummy! I used only 1 cup of OJ for 4 skinless, bone-in thighs, added 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger and it was a great tasting dinner. Also, I only baked it for 1 hour, 15 minutes because I didn't want the chicken to become dry & over-cooked. It turned out just right & I will definitely be making it again!

Simple and delicious. I used crushed garlic instead of powder and added a dash of ginger. The chicken got a bit dried out, I'd cut the baking time to 1 hour and 15 minutes or less.

I enjoyed this meal for the most part but found it a little too salty.  I think next time I will use half as much onion soup mix and possibly cut back on the soya sauce.  My preschoolers loved the chicken and I didn't even have leftovers.  The only reason I didn't give this 4 stars was that I felt it was too salty

We really liked this recipe. My husband raved! I did change it by adding 1/4 cup soy sauce and 2 Tbsp. honey, so it wasn't so orangy and tart. It is definitely something I will make again.

My kids liked this recipe, and my husband thought it was okay.  A good recipe for a basic quick weekday meal, but not sure I would make it for guests.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and thickened it with cornstarch after the chicken was cooked.  I used boneless skinless thighs and cooked for 1 hour....very tender!

Got rave reviews at the dinner table on this one! I altered the dish a bit however. I increased the OJ/Soy sauce to 1.5 cups, 1.5 tbls respectively, and added 1 tbl. honey. Also, I added 4 sliced cloves of garlic to the bake pan. During the last 15-20 min. of cooking I flipped the chicken so that it wouldn't be so crispy on top.

This recipe was very tasty and easy to make and my whole family enjoyed it very much. Even though I used skinless thighs, I didn't have the need to double the sauce. Also I used 6 cloves of garlic instead of the 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and followed Joyce's tweaks by adding a tablespoon of sugar and a tablespoon of cornstarch.

My recommendations: very salty, so use low-sodium soy sauce instead of regular; if you choose to remove the chicken skin to save fat, as I did, double the sauce recipe, baste every 15 minutes and turn the chicken over every 30 minutes.  This was very easy and my husband liked it, though my daughter and I weren't wild about it.

We loved this. Only minor changes. I doubled the juice as suggested and squeezed it myself. I used 2 tbsp minced garlic and doubled the soy sauce. Also I used McCormick orange peel to enhance the orange flavor and used a package of knor onion soup mix. Thinking of chopping an onion and throwing that in as well.

I give this a 5 star...it was a total hit at my house...my husband loved it so much that he got up for a 3rd round...I followed some of the other reviews and added some sliced onions, 1T. chopped garlic and just went by eye with orange zest, freshly squeezed orange juice, soy sauce....although I only added a tad bit of the onion soup so it wouldn't be saltly. Marinated chicken for about an hour and when arranged in dish I drizzled some lemon juice.  This was an awesome recipe served over white rice.

Doubled the sauce recipe, but really didn't need to. There was too much sauce for the chicken and I had to remove the sauce and try to reduce it. Good flavor over rice. Added some chopped ginger and chopped garlic.

I made this tonight because I had a package of boneless chicken thighs and I didn't want to do the usual with them.  To the original recipe, I added ginger, some jarred orange peel, and about a tablespoon of orange marmalade all-fruit.  I cooked them upside down for 20 minutes, flipped them and cooked them for about another 15 minutes.  When they were done, I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch, added another tablespoon of the orange marmalade, and poured it over the chicken and brown rice.  I served broccoli florets (Asian theme) with it.  I will definitely make it again, but I will add fresh orange zest to the sauce before I serve it to up the orange flavor.

This was ok for me. it had good orange flavor to it, but the onion soup mix was a little to much for me. This did not re-heat well either. This is one of the recipes that had ok flavor but i would work with a little if i made again.

Very tasty...I  just used a small onion grated in a cheese grater instead of onion soup mix. then added a little salt to my own taste. Over all a great dish.

I made this with chicken breast and did not like it at all. It was edible, but I won't recommend or make it again. I even followed some tips from other reviews and seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and a pinch of ginger. It was moist and flavorfull, I just did not like the flavor or the texture of the chicken. The only way I see this being a successful recipe is if it was made with dark meat which was marinated in the sauce overnight and then browned in a pan on stove.

I had high hopes for this .... but it came out nothing more than just plain orange marmalade and onions on gourmet boneless, skinless chicken thighs.

You must like chicken thighs (I don't like chicken on the bone, but took a shot).  I didn't find this very orangy and I'd probably add more soy sauce.  Also might want to sweeten with honey.  I didn't follow exactly though.  I used 12 thighs, doubled the soy and OJ to make more sauce as others suggested.  I also took off most of the skin and still found it greasy.  My kids are eating it doused with ketchup right now.  My husband opted for hot sauce.

I marinated this overnight and used boneless skinless breasts.  It was good, but just okay.  There was an odd flavor.  I tasted an Asian flavor, but my husband said it almost tasted like it had a liqueur in the marinade.

Good recipe.  Couldn't be easier.  I would never try this with skinless chicken- afraid it would come out too dry.  It browned the skins really nice and the orange was perfect.  I followed it to a tee.  Was moist.  Will make it again.

This was pretty flavorful and stayed moist a lot better than I expected, but boyfriend found it overwhelmingly onion-y and I was annoyed at the long cook time and having to baste repeatedly. I made it again with two tbs low-sodium soy sauce and just a teaspoon of onion powder, and found it much more palatable (and I used smaller cut pieces of chicken to reduce the cooking time).

Not what I expected.  Didn't taste like orange at all.  The onion soup really overpowered it.  Tasted okay, but disappointed that the orange flavor didn't stand out more.  I used breasts and could see how it tastes better with dark meat.  Too bad.

For the tastiness of this dish it is so easy! I always use boneless chick breasts, basting every 15 min. for 1 hour. This is great served with rice.

For quick, easy, flavorful chicken, this is very good. I agree with others that the onion soup mix is strong and salty. There are many reviews here that suggest ways around this. Next time, I will leave the soup mix out and add 1-2 chopped onions. Some orange zest would pump up the orange flavor. This dish wants rice on the side.

This is a keeper!  After reading a few reviews,  I decided to double the sauce but only use 1 soup envelope and thicken sauce at end with corn starch.  I also kicked up the orange flavor with adding the zest of an orange.  Sooooo yummy.   Next time I'll have more chicken........lol.

I think the onion soup threw this all off.  I found myself scraping the onion off because it was extremely strong and salty tasting.  The chicken does come out moist though.  Maybe if I try again, I'll only put half the packet of onion soup mix in.

This was great! I added just a splash more orange juice than the recipe calls for. I also bought a piece of ginger root and shredded it and added it to the marinade. This was yummy, not too salty like some said. Next time I make this I would make an extra batch of sauce/marinade on the stove so it can be served and poured over rice.

I read the reviews before making this dish. I followed the advice of others using OJ concentrate rather than regular OJ, and in my and my husband's opinion it was a bit too orange tasting. Next time I will stick with regular OJ. I used the low sodium soy sauce, and just a regular packet of the onion soup mix and it did not seem too salty at all.  I baked in an 8x8 dish at 350 for one hour and the chicken was perfect - so moist!

Kids loved it.  Made a couple of changes. First, I used chicken legs because the kids love them.  Second, when I originally made this recipe the chicken didn't have much flavor.  This time I marinated the chicken legs for half an hour.  It really  enhanced the flavor of the meat.  The cooking time for me was about 45 minutes.

LOVED this recipe. Did modify by removing the skin off the thighs, use minced garlic, doubleld the soy sauce, added a tsp. powedered ginger, and a tsp of white pepper. Cook time was less than an hour.

I think this would have been OK had I left out the Onion Soup Mix like other reviewers suggested.  That gave it a weird/fake taste and the bits of dehydrated onions stuck to the chicken and were unappetizing.

Ditto the many others who said this is one great recipe.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and 40 minutes was plenty of time to cook (and also left plenty of sauce for soaking into rice).  I also marinated it for 30 minutes before cooking, which I think helps.  I'd definitely make it again, and I'd also take another reviewer's idea and try pork - bet that's good too.

Nice and light, made with pork instead of chicken, and marinated the whole for about 2.5 hours and used minced garlic.

Tasted great but using dry onion soup mix that is filled with MSG kind of ruined it for me.

Wow, this was very moist and flavorful. I added a couple shakes of ginger powder and salt and peppered the chicken. Besides that I cooked it to specs and it is wonderful, will definitely make again.

I wish I had read some of the reviews before making this -  I think the mushrooms would have been a nice additive.  I removed the skin from the thighs before baking and cut down the soy sauce to 2 t. in fear of the onion soup making it too salty.  Glad I did.  Also, they were done in 50 minutes, so I cannot imagine cooking them for an hour and a half! I'll make it again, but will check out some other suggestions first.

I used cut up chicken breasts b/c I do not chicken on the bone. I made the mistake of adding too much orange concentrate. MEASURE IT. It tasted like I was eating orange juice.

So easy and delicious. The only thing I did differently was to take a slotted spoon and get all the pieces of onion out. We like the flavor but not the chunks.  Cooked my thighs for 40 minutes.

This was okay. It was way too salty even though I cut back on the onion soup mix like others recommended. My husband wasn't a fan so I probably won't be making this again.

I would give this recipe a less than 1 if it was available. I was not a member of all recipes but felt the need to join to communicate just how bad this recipe tastes. I baked this dish to specification and threw the entire contents in the garbage after tasting. It was salty, slimy and disgusting. I wouldn't advise anyone to try it. Perhaps it was my stupidity for trusting any recipe that included instant soup mix.

Thanks Bev.  This is a really useful recipe.  Tweaked a bit...  added several teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce and used dried onions in place of onion soup. I thought the sauce was a bit too runny and reduced it by simmering until it had reached a thicker consistency. 

Serving it to my visiting family tonight.

Very tasty, easy and convenient! I made this the night before according to the instructions (except I substituted minced garlic for the garlic powder), then re-heated it at 350 for an hour when I got home from work the next day. It was so nice to be able to kick back and rest for that time after working a long day, instead of jumping into the kitchen when I least felt like it. Thanks! This one's a keeper!

WOW! After reading reviews, I decided to use 1C OJ concentrate and it gave this chicken a wallop of flavor! Next time I'll use less concentrate, add water, and give it a squirt of honey to cut the tartness.  Great recipe.  Easy, quick, and fabulous leftover.  I served with long grain and wild rice and steamed sugar snap peas for an excellent meal. Thanks!

This sounded really good, and the chicken had really nice texture and color to it, but sad to say, there was no flavor at all.  Salt maybe, but no orange/asian flavor.  I cut the onion soup by 1/2, but I think the only thing missing due to that was salt.  Sorry, won't be making this again.

Slightly disappointed.  With all of the comments about it tasting very orange-like, I was expecting the orange flavor to be a little more prominent, but rather, only a slightly orange tast prevailed over a very onion-soup-mix flavor.  I will not be making this again.

I tried using the crockpot, but couldn't get the sauce thick enough for my liking, so eventually I transfered to a skillet and simmered for about 30 minutes until it was thick.  Good flavor and the orange wasn't too over powering.

We did not care for this chicken recipe. There was an odd aftertaste and and the OJ and onion mix just didnt compliment each other.  There was a pretty color and glaze to it though.

Very good.  I made this just as described, and was delighted with the results.  Even my picky husband gave it an enthusiastic thumbs up!  I am making it again tonight, and will double the marinade as it did cook down completely and it would be yummy over rice.  Thanks Janet.

This was very good. I didn't have onion soup mix so I just added two sliced onions, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper along with 3 cloves of minced garlic. I would make again.

I laid orange slices on top of the thighs to give them extra tanginess.  I also doubled the OJ and Soy Sauce so that I had extra sauce to pour over rice.  Great recipe!

This recipe was wonderful! It was soooo easy and I almost always have all the ingredients in my pantry. I used bone in chicken thighs and cooked it a little longer and lowered the temp for the last part. I just prefer the thighs really well done and tender. It was so good even my kids loved it.

We really enjoyed this!  I used 1 1/2 cups OJ and added 2 cloves of garlic, crushed.  I marinated the chicken about and hour before cooking.  Thickened the sauce and served over rice.  Excellent flavors.  Next time I may try breasts instead of thighs.

This was GREAT!! I was looking for something new to do with thighs and this was it! I pressed 3-4 garlic cloves with the mix. I removed the chicken when done and added 1tbls of cornstarch and 1 Splenda packet and it was an excellent gravy! This one is a keeper.

Very cheap, takes only 5 minutes to prepare, and it tasted great!  We followed the recipe exactly and were very pleased.  Didn't smell very good when we were preparing it but smelled great as it cooked for a while.  Will definitely make this again.

One word - YUM!  Not an 'orange-y' taste, but the juice and soup mix give it a nice tang.  Didn't have soy on hand so used a splash of teriyaki instead and was very tasty.  I think next time I will use a garlic clove instead of powder also.  Sauce was fine for me, but if you were to serve it over pasta I would see the need to thicken it a bit.  Chicken came out crisp skinned and juicy fleshed.  Definately will make again!

This recipe is great!  My husband and son loved
it.  Took another viewer's advice and added
1 tbl sugar during cooking and 1/2 tbl cornstarch
with a little water at the end to make the sauce
thicker.  Definitely will make again.

Made as stated and chicken was moist. But whoa, it just tasted (and smelled) like onions -- none of the other flavored came through. I have to admit, I'm not a huge onion fan (although I love onion dip).  I'll try it one more time and leave out the soup mix to see how it goes....

My family of four had this for dinner tonight and we all enjoyed it.  I made a few changes after reading the reviews .  I added a little more soy sauce (1/2 tbsp more), fresh garlic and fresh ginger.
I will definitely make this again!

This was quite tasty.  The only thing I did different is that I doubled the orange juice and soy sauce. Don't double the soup mix, too salty. I used a low sodium soy sauce too.  It made a lot of liquid at first but it really cooked down into a flavorful sauce.  I kept drizzling the juice over the top of the thighs every 30 minutes or so.  The whole family enjoyed it.

Great recipe made it according to recipe except used chicken breasts.  Would slice the breasts into smaller pieces.  But the sauce was great and light.  Easy great dish.

I really thought this was going to be a great recipe. It was so-so. Sauce was way to thin, even after adding corn starch, and there was hardly any orange flavor. Was better after some red pepper flakes, but I'm still not sure if I will make it again. Disappointed.

This was excellent!  I didn't use the onion soup mix because I was out, and I didn't notice a really orange-y taste, but it was nice.  I added some cornstarch to the orange juice and soy sauce to make a gravy and served it over the chicken and garlic mashed potatoes.  Will make again for sure!

I was in need of a good quick recipe for dinner and tried this out.  I was skeptical once I added the onion soup mix because the onion smelled like it was overpowering the orange.  I cooked the chicken turning it every 30 minutes as the recipe directed.  

while the recipe was good, it wasn't AWESOME!  I don't think I'll be using this recipe again anytime soon.

We LOVED this chicken! I made it exactly as written except for removing the skin and  marinating it overnight. It had a great flavor without being too overpowering of anything. Hubby requested that I make this one again, and I will! Thanks for sharing. :)

Really Good. I served it with Brown Rice and tsp. of sour cream. I used boneless chicken thighs and it cooked in 45 minutes. Next time I will up the seasonings a little more. Overall it was good, and the chicken was juicy.

I made this for dinner the other night but my husband came home late so I had to put it in the fridge. He took a bite and said, "Wow, that's good what's it called?" It was hit even after being in the fridge for several hours, we even had it for lunch the next day! One thing I would suggest is using a fresh squeezed orange juice as I did not and it lacked a very strong orange flavor I was expecting. I also used Onion/Mushroom soup mix that gave it a good flavor. I think next time I will also use fresh garlic instead of the powdered garlic. I used chicken thighs and baked at 45 minutes which was perfect. But all in all it was very good and the chicken was very moist and tender! Thank you for a great recipe to add to my dinner rotation! :)

Very good!  A keeper!  Chicken thighs  are not my favorite type of meat.  This recipes is PERFECT for them!  I did make a few minor changes.  First, I used an electric skillet instead of baking in oven.  It took about an hour.  Next, I doubled the orange juice; kept the soy sauce as written.  I used mushroom-onion soup mix-about a tablespoon.  I sprinkled a generous amount of orange peel (spice-not fresh). About every 15 min. I turned the chicken.  When done, I added about a tablespoon of corn strach and some more oj and made a sauce.  My fairly picky 11 year old and 3 year old ate it up.  My husband loved it.

We didn't find this to be very tasty at all. Cooked up moist but ended up rinsing the sauce off and using the chicken in another dish.

This recipe was just okay in my opinion.  Had a nice mild flavor but nothing spectacular.  I did however double the OJ, soy sauce, and garlic powder but not the dry onion soup mix.  I also marinated it for an hour before baking.  The chicken was juicy (I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts) and baked for an hour (probably could have baked for about 45 minutes).  If I make this again I think I'll cut back on the OJ and add more soy sauce.  Otherwise it was good for a quick and easy dinner.

It definitely needs to be spiced up a bit. I used chicken strips since we don't care for thighs. I marinated them over nite and baked them. They were just 'ok" Next time I will marinate them and then roll them in bread crumbs and bake.

I'll gave this recipe three stars because it was orange chicken but I didn't really get the orange flavor.  All I could really taste was the onion soup mix.  It was good but not what I was expecting.  Next time I think I'll use only a half a package of onion soup mix and use some orange zest just to give it more of an orange-y taste.

This was not orange chicken the way I'm used to it or expected it, but it was a good chicken dish.  I would recommend it if you want to try something new, but I don't think its going to replace your favorite chicken recipe.  But for a change and something a little different, its worth the effort.

Not much orange flavor, nothing like the orange chicken you would find at a chain restaurant.  Probably won't make it again.

I did cut back on the onion soup mix because my roommate and I are trying to be frugal with the sodium lately.  It tasted lovely.  We used the marinade with boneless chicken breast.  It had a distinct orange flavor, it was plenty sweet, no sugar needed.  The soy sauce and onion soup mix did not over power it.  I was very pleased.  The only problem was that the sauce did not thicken up because I had to keep the chicken covered to keep it moist.  It also only had to cook for 40 minutes.  I didn't have any thickeners on hand at her house so I was limited in what I could do.  Despite that the flavor transferred well.  We were both pleased.  I will definitely use this again!

Didn't get a lot of flavour from this. Added a little more soy and garlic which didn't seem to help. Probably won't make it again.

I was thinking of orange chicken with a nore robust orange flavor. Neither I or my kids liked this recipe at all. On the plus side it is a great marinade for keeping the chicken juicy, but didn't care for the flavor.

I found the onion soup mix overpowered the orange so will try a couple of the ideas posted such as marinating before hand, definitely I'll use less onion soup mix and was thinking I'll add some orange zest to the marinade. It was so salty I was up in the night drinking water, I'm blaming that on the onion soup mix.

This was easy but there was little flavor in the chicken (I used legs) & the sauce was very salty. I was hoping it would be as good as cloa chicken but it doesn't make it & I won't make it again.

I made a few changes and it turned our pretty good.  I didn't have any orange juice, so I added 1 tsp of orange extract instead.  I removed the skin from the chicken thighs to reduce the fat.  I also added about 1/4 cup of honey and some ground ginger.  I would make this again.

It was okay... I should have only used about half of the onion soup mix because it really overpowered the rest of the flavors.

This was really good. I followed suggestions of others and added a "good dash' of ginger, garlic, and curry. I doubled the OJ and Soy but used only one package of onion soup mix using four thighs. I thickened the sauce with flour at the end of cooking. I cooked covered and removed cover for last 20-30 minutes. I fixed with broccoli and orzo. We both really liked it a lot. Thanks Bev!

Its one of those dishes that you just need to keep working with it...but definately a keeper. I held back on the lipton soup mix and put in the extra juice as others have recommended, happy I did.

I used orange concentrated instead of OJ and added 1 teaspoon of ginger and omitted the garlic powder. Also I used 3 teaspoon of onion soup mix and marinated the meat for 45 minutes. My boyfriend loved it......was okay for me. Proabably would make it again with some alterations.....extremely orangy

Made this last night for dinner with vegetable soba.  The whole family loved it.  I did take some of the others suggestions and used OJ concentrate over just juice.  I actually allowed it to marinate for about 2 hours, then basted with the marinade. Last 5 minutes I broiled the thighs on high.  Will def be keeping this recipe and can't wait to try it on the grill.

I made this recipe for my family and they really enjoyed it!  It's a great twist on regular baked chicken.  The flavor was great but, the sauce does need to be thickened with corn starch or flour.  I also, added a little more orange juice.  Serve with rice and veggies. Enjoy!

This is so good and so easy!  I needed a quick recipe, had all of the ingredients and my picky toddlers loved it so it gets 5 stars from this family.  Made it as written (skinless, boneless thighs for 1 hour), added fresh sliced carrots the last 20 minutes and served with pene pasta tossed with some of the sauce.  The carrots were delicious.  Definitely a kid friendly meal.

If you don't have time to cook this is a dish for you. It can be thrown together in a couple of minutes. I thought it tastes like a meal you can throw together in a couples of minutes. It's a 3 star meal.

This was OK but a bit of a hassle to make. I think I had my chicken chunks to large, so probably my fault. needed a bit more orange flavor.

This was very tasty. My husband and kids loved it! I did add an extra 1/2 cup of orange juice. Came out juicy and very flavorful. Thank you for the recipe.

Pretty good.  Next time I'll take the skin off the chicken though.  I think the juice would be more useful afterward if it wasn't laden down with the fat from the skin.  I'm chopping this chicken up and making something my family calls "on-top-dinner".  It's rice with chicken, toasted nuts, pineapple, chopped celery, scallions cheddar cheese and soy sauce on top.  You can also be crazy and add coconut or whatever you fancy.  Yum Yum Yum!

This was very good! I added an extra 2/3 c. orange juice, 1/4 t. ground ginger, and replaced the garlic powder with two minced garlic cloves. I used a whole cut up chicken, not too big, and it only needed an hour in the oven at 350. Thickened the juices with cornstarch to make a gravy. Great over rice with a side of veggies!

This was pretty good, but I think it could use some improvement.  It had good flavor, but something was lacking.  I doubled the sauce, based on some of the reviews, and I think I would have liked it better if there was less sauce, and it had boiled down a little.  I also used boneless skinless breasts instead of thighs, so maybe that changed it as well.

My husband and I love this meal. Though I replace the soy sauce with Teriyaki sauce as it is less salty, and use 1 1/2 cups of orange juice to get more sauce at the end.  Chicken breasts are also really good with this recipe.

I made this recipe as is and it didn't quite excite my taste buds enough. I felt it was rather disappointing. Orange chicken to me should have a nice orange flavor to it and this recipe had none. Perhaps I could change the recipe more to my liking if I ever make it again.

Good flavor in the sauce,though a bit too thin for me. I served it over steamed rice and the hubby enjoyed it. Next time will try adding a few sliced oeanges at the end.

This recipe sounded really good, but it was not good at all.  I let it marinate over night and it was still pretty tasteless.  You could barely taste the orange flavor and the onion was over powering.

Orange flavor didn't come through much. Adding ginger was a nice touch. Husband liked it. I thought it was just okay. Marinading might help.

I'm eating this right now, not all that impressed.  Good idea for a sauce, but the chicken just doesn't have much of an orange flavor.  I think next time when I have more time I will make some changes like marinating in orange juice or orange juice concentrate for an hour.  The only thing that saved this chicken was the addition of seasoning the chicken before pouring the sauce over it.

This was really good. It reminded me of orange chicken a little bit. I took a little bit of a different route...I didn't know if my husband would like it, so instead I just boiled the chicken, and then made the marinade and cooked it seperate. So that way we could just pour it over our chicken and rice. I also mixed in a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it. I also thought that it needed to be doubled so I did, which I'm glad I did. Next time I make it though I am going to add a little bit of sugar as someone suggested in the reviews. It needed a little sweetning I thought. I will deffinately make it again.

Easy and fast. Daniel just rubbed all the ingedients on it, and didn't really use any measuring. Some breading would be good. It is easy though, and you can do it all in it's baking pan. Yummy.

This was a fantastic recipe! I have only cooked it once and I followed the recipe exactly; very very good! I am cooking it tonight with breasts instead of thighs- can't wait to see how it turns out. Thank you for this simple and tasty recipe.

This was sooooo easy and smelled WONDERFUL while cooking. I bit into the onions in the onion soup and that was kinda gross, but the chicken was pretty dang good! I will make this again! *update, I made this again and added some diced mushrooms and I did not like it as much this time, not sure if it was the mushrooms or what, but I would not put them in again, personally.

The sauce tastes like slightly tangy onion.  The recipe sounded a lot better than what I actually ate and tasted. It wasn't even Asian-influenced at all, says my friend. I would know, I'm ASIAN.

It may be my own fault it didn't turn out so well. I didn't have onion soup mix so I used fresh chopped onions with a little garlic salt and onion powder. Also used 3 cloves of crushed chopped garlic since we like garlic a lot. This recipe was just OK. I think I would like it better on chicken breasts instead of thighs. I probably won't try it again. I don't think the orange and soy sauce mixed well with the other flavors at all, even if I had used the soup mix.

We loved this recipe and will definitely make it again.  I used some of the other reviewers' suggestions and increased the oj to 1.5 cups, and the soy sauce to 1.5 tablespoons.  I also added a tablespoon of sugar and a splash of lemon juice.  The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I think the name is misleading because the orange flavor is so subtle.  I decided Bev's orangey onion chicken was more accurate, or just Bev's chicken.   It sure is juicy and moist, though!

I used boneless chicken breast.  Then I cut the garic powder and marinaded the breast for 3 hours, puncturing the breast to let the meat absorb the flavor.  Pre-heat to 475.  Put the breat on a rack, and reserve marinade.  When you pout hte chicken in, drop tem to 350.  Bake for 30 min. take marinate, add in 1/2 c oj, and two boullion cubes.  bring to boil and thicken with cornstarc.

I used 1 1/2 cups OJ and 1 1/2 T of soy like another reviewer said.  It was still too bland for me.  We served it on rice using the very watery "sauce" on it.  It just wasn't flavorful enough for us.  If I were to attempt this again I would use some lemon juice and cornstarch to thicken.  And maybe throw in some ginger or other spices.

This is a very easy recipe. Usually have everything on hand to make it. I used Legs and Thighs, bone in, but I skinned them. It only took an hr and 15 mins for 4 of each, legs and thighs. Next time I will use more OJ. This sauce is sooooo good, but there just wasn't enough of it. I will make this again, my family loved it.

The chicken has a good flavor.  Just be sure to watch that you don't use too much onion soup mix.  It easily overpowers the sweetness.

This is my new favorite recipe! The chicken is incredibly tender and has a great flavor. I usually don't make it home in time to cook a "real" dinner (and so I often don't buy fresh chicken), but this marinade works perfectly and is great for those nights when I actually have time to eat at home! For a super-quick total meal, I like to add sides of carrots and Lipton's terriyaki (or sweet and sour) noodles. Thanks for the recipe!

5-1/2 starts! This took LESS than 5 minutes to prepare, had few ingredients, and tasted wonderful! It's also low-carb (except that it was so good I had 2 pieces). That's the only drawback; it says "makes 8 servings," but between two people, we ate 5 out of 8 thighs, leaving enough for about 2 lunches. :-) The sauce would be--for those who are allowed--DELICIOUS over rice. Terrific recipe!

My husband and I loved this!  I let this marinate in the fridge overnight and mistakenly baked it the first 45 minutes with foil on.  I took the foil off the last 45 minutes and my sauce turned out perfect; so, I think I will cook it this way "intentionally" next time.  Very easy.  Very good.

Easy and yummy! Have all ingredients on hand, usually. I used 6 boneless breasts (small) & basted every 20 minutes. The last 20 minutes of baking, the sauce thickens up nicely.

I used more chicken and used 3/4 can of undiluted orange juice and about 1/2 cup water
Also, increased other ingredients just a bit and gave a sprinkle of paprika before putting in the oven. Used chicken breasts. Was excellent, quick and easy!

I definitely will make again but bigger batch!  I didn't even preseason chicken with salt  since soy and dry soup contain enough sodium.  Orange flavor was subtle so next time I  will use fresh orange juice - love oj.

I read the reviews and did as others suggested in doubling the oj and soy sauce cut the soup mix to half the package, used fresh garlic, added some ginger and orange zest.  This just wasnt good.  I will not try it again.

I made this and it was awesome! Based on some of the reviews I read, I doubled the sauce & and used fresh squeezed OJ; also added orange zest. I think it may have been too salty if I had used " regular" soy sauce. There was plenty of the sauce & it was really, really, good! I think the orange flavor was quite pronounced due to the addition of the orange zest. It was served with brown basmati rice & steamed broccoli. I also made a slurry with cornstarch and water  when I removed it from the oven.  I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I made this as a stir fry. I used boneless thighs cut up, and added sno peas, broccoli and carrots because that is what I had on hand. Also, instead of regular rice, I used frozen riced cauliflower. So easy and healthier! It's delicious! The first time, I made it as is. The second time, I used frozen orange juice concentrate because I didn't have regular orange juice. I did add water to the OJ, but less than directed. It upped the orange flavor and the sauce was nice and thick, the more it cooked. I also grated some fresh orange peel into the dish, because I had oranges in the house. Yummy!

Great meal! I doubled the sauce ingredients (OJ, soy) but only used one package of beefy onion soup mix and the same amount of garlic powder. After baking I simmered the OJ sauce in a saucepan and added a cornstarch slurry to thicken it up slightly. For that I used about 1 tsp. cornstarch + one tablespoon cold water. Stir well to combine then whisk into the simmering orange sauce. Served this over sticky rice with a side of broccoli. Delicious! The chicken was super tender and moist, perfectly cooked.

Very flavorful, I would definitely make this again.  Substituted orange-pineapple juice for the OJ, and used leek soup packet, as these were on hand.  I used this on 4 bone-in, skin-on thighs & leftover sauce was delicious over rice.  Next time I would remove the skin prior to cooking, as it did not become crispy.

Hubby loved it. It gave our chicken a nice flavor without any one taste overwhelming it. I made without the skins on for calories and still very good, but I can only imagine how good it would be with them. A keeper!

Doubled the orange juice and the garlic, also covered the chicken for 20 minutes and left uncovered for 35 minutes, came out very moist and flavorful.

Made this tonight with bone-in, skin on, chicken thighs. Didn't change anything about recipe. Not impressed. Just not what I expected. I thought it had a weird smell. I did not like the taste of the chicken skin, and I normally love chicken skin...think it's the best part! Not this time. This dish was also very greasy with the thighs. Was looking forward to this but, oh well, won't be making this again.

This had an ok flavor. Not much orange flavor to it when following recipe as is. Tender, but that may have just been the fact that it was thighs instead of my usual breasts.

Easy and fast.  We liked it.  5-ounce frozen boneless/skinless chicken breasts were DONE in 30 minutes in the convection oven.  Marinated at 15 minutes.  Used a whole orange for juice and added the zest.  It was yummy.  We'll make it again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I marinated the chicken (drumsticks) in the liquid from 9 to 5.  The onion soup mix packet is 2 ounces so be careful to only add half the packet. Even after adding a pinch of ginger the chicken still seemed bland to us.

Great recipe.  We all loved it.  I took suggestions from readers and increased orange juice to 2 cups.  Came out great!  Will use a little ginger next time as well.   Just didn't have any.

This chicken was so fast & easy to make, and tasty also.  The smell was delicious and the sauce was great.  I didn't have dry onion soup mix so I added a couple of tablespoons of dried minced onion, and I added extra orange juice because I wanted the dish "saucy."  A keeper, I'll make again.

This was simple and good, I will be making this again.  I didn't give it 5 starts because I felt the onion soup mix was was a bit to strong of a flavor and didn't have enough citrus flavor.  I think I will put a bit less in next time.  I added 2 fresh garlic cloves instead of the garlic powder and and add lemon zest (I would have used orange zest but I didn't have oranges).  The sauce came out perfect.  After cooking the thighs I put the sauce on the stove top and added 1 1/2 teaspoons corn starch to thicken it and served it with rice and veggies. All in all my husband I were very pleased.

We didn't care for this recipe.  I agree with a few of the other reviewers who said the onion mix was too over-powering.  If you think about the fact that you're only adding a whole packet of salty seasoning to only a cup of oj  (plus 1 TB soy),then you know it's going to be concentrated.

I liked this chicken, but I was hoping for something a little more elegant tasting. I could tell it was orange juice, not some fancy orange glaze or something. It was really easy to make, which was awesome. I let it sit in the marinade for 20-30 minutes, as many suggested. I also added a little lemon and orange zest, something I would recommend. I think I would try another recipe or two before I would make this again, but it is a recipe I will keep.

I have made this several times and it's always a hit.  I do double the indgredients to make more "gravy" and then serve it over rice. I did however try in once in the crock pot and it was very bland...maybe need to double "spice" for that next time around.

My family loved this recipe more than I did, but that may be because I'm more partial to chicken breasts than thighs. I'll try it again, though, with breasts and with some of the suggestions offered by others.

I did it the same as the original recipe, and while good, not really very orange-y. My roommates said it was similar to teriyaki. If i wanted more orange I would probably use more orange juice, or even concentrate, and then some extra orange zest or something of the like. Still a very good recipe for something so simple

I thought the flavor was really good, but because of all the reviews I doubled the organge juice and soy sauce, so my sauce was not thick at all, I think I would of liked it thick better, I did use boneless chicken breast and baked for 45 min it was very juicey, and tender, I will try this recipe again.

This is easy to make and tastes fine but the combination of tastes in this chicken is just a little too weird for me.  I probably won't make this again.

I followed others suggestion about adding more orange juice and soy sauce. Next time I believe I would only use what the recipe called for instead. My husband said it was okay but too orange tasting for him. I aslo use fresh garlic.  I may do this recipe again with some tweaking.

this was very good but didn't taste like orange chicken, I used 2 tsp. cornstarch to thicken the sauce, other than that I left it the same, my husband said it was a little salty, but good. we will make it again most likely!

I made this dish exactly as written. It was really dissapointing.  It was really overpowered by the onion soup, I couldn't really taste much orange. I would not really call this orange chicken. Everyone ate it but no one will ask for it again.

My husband made this recipe tonight, and he followed the directions exactly -but it didn't turn out well. We were able to eat it okay, but I would never call this orange chicken. We won't be making this one again.

Made this last night for the first time, all three of us found it so tasty. I even had some nice thickened onion gravy to but over it. It was so simple and I sure will use the recipe again.

Sauce is great, but both son and I preferred it over chicken cooked separately (sautee'd  or baked) rather than cooked in the sauce.

We really liked this!  I also added a smidge of honey.  I buy onion soup mix in bulk because I use it in bread making and I added maybe half the amount indicated which I augmented with minced dehydrated onion.  DEFINITE keeper of a recipe, very quick, easy and delicious, and we always have these ingredients on hand.

This is so good! I gave it 4 stars because I had to tweak it just a bit.  I added about a tbs. of honey to the mixture to add some sweet, then after I put the chicken in the pan I placed pats of butter all over to help in the browning process.  Yummy! Don't forget to baste during cooking it really helps.  I served this with whipped potatoes and homemade cream style corn.  My very picky husband and 3 year old son ate it up and asked for more in the future!

This was very good.  The orange juice and onion soup complemented each other.  I love boneless thighs and this
cut of meat was just right for this dish.  Very easy and delicious, my kind of meal.  Thanks for the post Janet.

This recipe got good reviews overall, so I gave it a try, but it was awful!  It didn't smell good in the oven and did not taste good.  I followed the advice of other reviews and tweaked it a little, but with or without the adjustments I wouldn'e have liked it.  My husband didn't eat a bite.  The flavor isn't very strong, but you do taste orange and onion and they don't mesh well.  Sorry.

This recipe was just ok.  The chicken came out very moist but it didn't have the orange tangy flavor I was hoping for.   All the flavor kind of gets left on the skin and is barely detectable.  I might try this with skinless chicken breasts and see what happens.

This was very easy and relatively quick.  I used boneless, skinless thighs.  Unfortunately, my family did not like it.  They thought it was "sour" which I interpret as meaning "tangy."  I don't thing I'll be making this again.

wow, this recipe is soooooo good! the flavor is absolutely perfect and the chicken came out with a crispy skin, yet falling-off-the-bone tender on the inside. and it could not have been easier to make. only change i made was to add a dash of ginger to the sauce. try this, you will love it!

I did not care for the flavor of this sauce at all, neither did my family. I marinated the chicken for an hour and a half and used boneless chicken breasts. I did like the moistness of the chicken but I will not be using this recipe again.

I made this for family guest this weekend. Everyone thought it was very good. But I was not too crazy over it. I used boneless breast and basted as called for. But it was to bland for my taste. I think I will add more seasoning next time. Will make again since everyone else in my family enjoyed it.

Great recipe! It wasn't really orange flavored but a sweet yummy flavoring. I didn't have onion soup mix so I used Hidden Valley Rnach Dip Mix and it was great! I'll make this again, for sure.

We enjoyed this.  I was in a hurry so I lightly sauteed boneless thighs before I poured the sauce over and put them in the oven.  As suggested in previous reviews I added a spoonful of sugar to the sauce when mixing and a tbsp. of cornstarch the last 15 min of baking time.  I threw in a few crushed garlic cloves and as I had no onion soup I used a bit of 3 onion dip mix.

Okay, but not great. Did not have the orange flavor I was expecting.

We didn't have pure orange juice on hand so i used 5 alive citrus. I also used roasted garlic instead of powder. It turned out great especially when u leave the chicken in long enough to let the sauce thicken. This is great accompanied with pasta as the sauce goes well with it.  I do think i will add about 1/2 tsp of sugar into the sauce next time just to sweeten it up a bit. Otherwise sooooo easy and very tasty.
