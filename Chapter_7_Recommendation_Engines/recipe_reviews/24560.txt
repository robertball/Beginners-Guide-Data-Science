Here's a variation on the recipe:
1-14 oz pkg caramels
2 1/2 T. Evaporated Milk
2 cups Chopped Pecans
1-24 oz pkg chocolate Bark
Combine caramels & evaporated milk in a microwave safe bowl.  Microwave on high for 2 to 2 1/2 min, stirring frequently.  Add the pecans and mix well.  Drop by teaspoonfuls onto a greased baking sheet.  Freeze for 2 hours.  Melt the chocolate bark in a microwave safe bowl in the microwave for 2 to 2 1/2 min, stirring frequently.  Dip the caramel drops in the melted chocolate bark and place on waxed paper to cool.  Yields 3-4 dozen.
They taste just like Pixies!!

Because I love turtles, I have tried to make them every year.  They have never turned out until this year.  I decided to analyze what I did not like about them.  First, using five pecans made them just way too big, so I used just one pecan.  Then I cut the caramels in half and put them on the pecans.  Second, they were always too hard.  So I  baked them for just 2 to 2 and a half minutes at 300 degrees ... just until they were malable.  Then I smoothed the caramels over the pecans with my fingers and let them cool.  Third the chocolate was always too tacky, it just never firmed up.  So I added one eighth of a bar of parafin to the chocolate and dropped a dollop on the caramel/pecans.  They turned out perfect!  I've made two batches this year so far ... one with dark chocolte chips and one with semi-sweet chocolate chips.  They were both yummy!  Hope this helps others who have had problems with turtles.

should melt at 25o degrees for 10 minutes.  350 is too high of heat.  It makes the caramels "crispy"

Passable, but prefer the following changes: 
1. "turtles" have four legs, so I use four pecan halves. Prefer this size of finished product.
2. I start with melting 1 bag chocolate chips and add 1/4 bar paraffin, for a better handling finished product.
3. On waxed paper, spoon half dollar size circles of melted chocolate; position four pecan halves in the chocolate, then place in freezer for a half hour.
4. Melt caramels, adding one tablespoon of milk or half and half per bag of caramels. Cool caramel mixture until it begins to stiffen again, but still stirrable.
5. Using two teaspoons, spoon a quarter size dot of caramel on the cold chocolate/pecan bases. Return to freezer for a half hour.
6. Spoon chocolate over the caramel dot, making sure the top layer of chocolate completely covers the edges of the caramel and coats the edge of the base chocolate... this way the caramel will not leak out at room temperature.
7. When top chocolate sets up, gently remove from baking sheet and allow to come up to room temperature before serving. They store well in a sealed container at room temperature!

After reading all the other reviews, I came up with a few modiifcations. I left the temperature at 300, but only put them in for 3- 3 1/2 minutes. Then when they came out, I put a little shortening on my finger tips and squished the caramel down with a bit of shortening on my fingers to keep the caramels from sticking. But be careful, because some of them may be pretty hot. And I just drizzled the chocolate over the top and they turned out great!!!!!

This candy taste like the real thing. It was easy to make and I used the microwave to melt both the chocolate and the caramel.Very good.

I should have read the reviews before attempting these at all. I was pretty annoyed last night for wasting so mucb money on the pecans and caramels just to throw it all out. First, tip - for best results - make your OWN caramel to use. If you use hard, storebought caramel - your turtles will be hard. Turtles are supposed to have soft yummy caramel but using the store bought squares just doesn't work. Maybe if you found some good quality soft caramels it would - I don't know - I tried kraft and trust me it doesn't work. At 10 minutes of baking - mine were still retaining their shape so I stupidly let them go 2 more minutes. Of course by trhen they looked perfect but when firmed up they were rock hard.

The recipe tasted okay, but it was rock hard.  I tried one of the reviewer's variation of the recipe and this worked much better.  My family loved them!!!

Yikes!  What happened to mine?  So easy to do, but the caramel in mine became so hard we could barely eat them!  I'm going to try again, but with home made caramel instead of the store bought.  Easy and potentially good, but I need another go.

This is a great starter recipe. I'm giving it 5 stars to boost the rating. The only thing I change is the length of time the caramels are in the oven and how many pecans. Last year I had plenty of pecans and laid them out in pairs, side by side. Making a Y is a hassle. Next, put a whole caramel on top and bake for ONLY 2 minutes or so. 10 minutes will harden them up and break your teeth! 2 minutes makes them soft and you press the caramel into the pecans. Then smother with chocolate and voila! They are big enough around and pretty thick. Give these a try, they are definitely worth the effort!

I followed the directions in Lady Godiva's review. However, I wanted to add three things:
(1) Milk chocolate works just as well as semi-sweet.
(2) I tend to coat the turtles in the chocolate. The first time I made them, I used semi-sweet chocolate chips, as the original recipe calls for. However, if you coat the entire turtle in chocolate, you will need more chocolate than what the recipe calls for.I probably used between 2-3 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips.
(3) Also, after coated them in chocolate, I froze them again for about an hour. Then, I brought them out and layered them in a container, with wax paper in between each layer. I kept them in the fridge until they were gone (which, of course, was not very long!)

I chopped the pecans and also added cranberries with them.  I put some melted vanilla bark on top also, just for color.  Gone before I could get this posted!  Will have to make more!!

do not bake at 350 degrees for 10 minutes!  the caramel will be as hard as rocks.  cook at 200 degrees for maybe 3 minutes.  the caramel will retain its shape but it will be soft enough to be shaped with your fingers.  you can shape them like a turtles shell.

A little messy, but very good. To make caramel and chocolate chips easier to work with, heat them in a bowl with a bit of milk. Just keep adding milk and heat until they get to a workable consistency.

These were pretty good. I agree with another user, who stated that the caramels and pecans should be cooked at 250 instead of 350. Thanks for the great recipe!!

These were so good! The only problem I had was I ate too many to test them! ;)
I used the microwave for the caramel and added a little milk. This made the caramel soft and yummy. Thanks for the recipe even though it has blown my diet! :)

I read all the reviews and modifications before attempting this recipe.  I baked the caramels for 3 minutes, then patted them down so the caramels spread over the pecans and baked for another minute to ensure the caramels softened.  Instead of using chocolate chips, I used almond bark.  The almond bark was easier to melt and spread.  It cut the cooling time down so my family could enjoy the turtles sooner.

I followed this recipe and ended up with extremely hard carmel. I think next time I will melt the carmel's myself and add a little milk to make them softer! Instead of chocolate chips I decided to try using Hersey's candy bars!(I get weak at the knees for Hersey's chocolate!) They turned out great with the Hersey's bars!

My turtles also turned out rock hard - so hard they were inedible!  I agree with the other reviewers that the baking time for the caramel is probably too long.  I am going to try to make my own caramal next time.  Otherwise, this recipe gave me a good base for making turtles, one of my favorite candies!

I thought this recipe would be quick and easy, and make a tasty treat. Although, I found them to be time consuming and a real pain to put together. In the end, nobody ate them.

I guess I should have read all the reviews before trying this recipe, because the recipe failed for me.  Now that I have read the reviews I see why. Maybe I will try again, but all the expense of ingredients went to waste.

This was ok ~ but the messiest thing to make with only such few ingredients!!!  I would definitely use wax paper while making because I had a HARD time getting the dried caramel off my stoneware.  Don't wear your good clothes, either.  I may make again.

Quick and easy! I used melted milk chocolate pieces (used to make candies) instead of semi-sweet chips for my sweet tooth.

I read the other reviews first and followed some of the helpful tips.  I did find that this was very simple to make even though some reviews said it was a bit difficult, but maybe I'm not as much of a perfectionist when it comes to presentation.  Taste was great!

My Junior Girl Scout troop made this recipe.  We forgot to add the shortening to the chocolate and we melted it in the microwave, but otherwise everything turned out great by simply following the directions.  Some of the carmels melted too much, but most were just fine.

I can't figure out what I did wrong. I melted the chocolate but I was unable to get it at a pouring or spreading consistency. Because the chocolate was dough-like, I had to make pecan/carmel filled balls out of them. Despite this problem, the taste was great.

These were very good, but were a little time consuming to make...they were worth it!  Everyone at work loved them.
