I made these for a ladies party I was having.  At first I was hesitant that they would be a bit too "Super Bowl"y, but I'm glad I made them anyway!  I doubled the recipe and 14 women managed to polish them off!  I cooked them ahead of time and kept warm in a crock pot; that was great, because they got better the longer they sat in the Crock Pot!  Had toothpicks available for eating.  Used Turkey Kielbasa.

This was the first thing to go at my get together. The only thing I would change is next time I will add less beer. It had a strong beer taste. (it could be because I used a summer ale, not sure) But it was a big hit.

I will never make kielbasa appetizers any other way from now on.  I halved the recipe to test them out.  I used my favorite dark beer and I used original "Open Pit" BBQ sauce because I figured that using a sweet sauce would make them too sweet with the added brown sugar.  They were perfect. Thanks for this great recipe!

I fixed these in the crock pot, so the sauce thinned out but the last hour or so before our dinner I cracked the lid so some liquid could evaporate off and that worked to some degree.  As far as flavor, they were very good.  There were no leftovers.  One can of beer, 12 oz, was plenty, more than plenty, and I didnt use a full bottle (12 oz I think) of bbq sauce.  I really wanted something with kielbasa and we already had anotoher pork and kraut dish, so rather than a before dinner appetizer, I just served them with dinner as an additional dish.  They were great.

These were so good  and really easy.  I did par boil the kielbasa first to take out most of the fat.  I doubled this recipe to take to a party and there was none left when I went home.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I liked this recipe...didn't love it.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added some crushed red pepper, fresh garlic and a couple spashes of worcestershire.  We found it to be very sweet (on the verge of being too sweet)  I'm thinking it could have been the barbeque sauce (I used KC Masterpiece-Original), or maybe 1/2 cup of brown sugar is too much...maybe 1/4 cup next time.  All in all, great consistency,sauce thickened up really nicely.

This was an ok recipe.  I made it twice, hoping the second time would be better than the first, but it wasn't.  DH and I both love sweets, but we found this a little too sweet for us (didn't think that was possible!).

This was a hit at my family's Thanksgiving! My husband and I were fighting over them the next day. I added cornstarch to thicken the liquid to become more "saucy". Enjoy!

I made this as an appetizer for New Year's Day, but I used Lil Smokies came out great, I only used 1 bottle of beer, I guess that's 12 ounces and I did add Worchester Sauce.  At first I only added 2 Tablespoons worth but decided it needed more after the cooking was done so I added a few more dashes.

I read all the reviews first, about it being too sweet. I decided to add the rest of the ingredients first, then add brown sugar by the tablespoon, taste testing as I went. I wound up only using 2 tbsp  of brown sugar. I didn’t have a full bottle of bbq sauce, so made do with ¾. I also added a couple dashes of Worcestershire sauce.
I cooked down the sauce on med for about half an hour, then put the meat in the slowcooker and poured sauce over top. 
I thought they kind of tasted like canned beans and wieners, but could be the type of bbq sauce I used? Heinz original.  They weren’t bad, but not too popular at the event I made them for.

I served this as an appetizer on New Year's Eve and it was a huge hit!  I am not a beer drinker and so I made it without the beer and it turned out fine.  I also let it cook for a couple of hours in the crock pot.  It was one of the easiest and more popular appetizers I served that night.

Nothing special.  People ate them but it really made for a boring dish.  Good flavor, just not interesting.

Delicious!  Really simple to make and a perfect little appy.  I used sweet baby ray's honey bbq sauce and a honey dijon.  My kielbasa's were elk meat, and they worked great with this recipe.  They were gone in no time!

Fantastic!
This is really so easy to prepare, everyone will think you actually put a lot of work into it though.
I've made this on several different occasions, and it's been a hit.
I do use a 3 pound package of Kielbasa though, as that's what my local grocer offers.
I've only used "cheap" beer as not wanting to waste anything actually worth drinking, but I suppose a good flavorful beer would only help to make this even better.
I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and easy appetizer that is a little different.

This is a delicious recipe and very simple to make.  It also allows for limitless variations.  For example, I added a teaspoon of chopped ginger to add a twist.  It seemed that the recipe, as written, contained a lot of liquid to reduce.  Next time, I am going to try one bottle of beer (12 oz.) and the same amount of BBQ sauce.  While BBQ sauce often comes in 18 oz. containers, it won't be hard to use the remainder in another dish.  Also, if you are bringing this dish to a gathering, making it in a crock pot makes more sense than a frying pan.

These were ok to us.  Had a party and had ALOT leftover... I will stick to my vinegar spicy sweet sauce but maybe try it with kielbasa instead of just hotdogs and meatballs. Thanks though!!!

As far as kielbasa goes this was OK.  I'm sure if you really like kielbasa it would be great!  Liked the sauce it was very good!  The dijon worked super in this.  I think this is something I may make in the summer when I can brown the kielbasa first on the grill.  Will make again - just on the grill.  Thanks!  Also, we used the less fat kielbasa and it was fine.

The sauce was good but the sausage was cooked too long so they were a little hard to chew. Maybe if you boiled down the sauce for a while before adding the kielbasa.

I served this recipe over rice for a family main dish; everyone loved it. I particularly like how the beer adds zing to the dish and it isn't overly sweet; this one's a keeper. Thanks!

This was good and easy, I would make it again. Took it as a Christmas Eve appetizer and everyone went back for multiple servings. As other reviewers mentioned, there was a lot of liquid to reduce and with amount of sugar suggested this would have been unpleasantly sweet. 

Slight changes I made as follows: lightly browned the kielbasa first, doubled the amount of kielbasa (used turkey to make it a little lighter), used 1 1/2  18 oz. bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ instead of 2 that would have been suggested by doubling the meat, used only about 3 tbsp. of brown sugar, added red pepper flakes.

Very happy with the recipe with the small variations, thanks for the recipe.

I downloaded this half an hour ago and thought it sounds nice enough and simple - BUT wow when I got it into the crockpot and tasted it - it was really terrific.  The sauce was not too sweet and I licked my wooden spoon down to a splinter.  Def a keeper and thats before I tasted it!!

Wow! I would have never thought of this on my own, and it was wonderful! I didn't have much time on my hand so I cooked it for over a half hour, and I used ketchup instead of barbecue sauce, and it was great! Thank you so much for this!

I thought these were going to be delicious, based on the recipe, so I think the problem might have been due to the BBQ sauce I used - Diana's Original - because my husband and I both found these overpoweringly sweet.  Maybe if I had reduced the amount of brown sugar they might have been OK. As it was, I kept adding vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, red pepper flakes and a couple of other things to try to get rid of the sweetness.  It worked, but just barely.

I really liked this!! I actually made it as a main course and served it with mashed potatoes and green beans. My hubby said it was "pretty good" which isn't the best compliment from him, but he ate it all... 
I made the following changes: I added some garlic powder, a few shakes of worcestshire sauce, and some crushed red pepper flakes, since we like things a little spicier. 
I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch, but I'll have to feel out my hubby a little bit to see if he'd want me to make it again. (He's pickier than a kid!!)  :)

This is one of those crazy-good recipes that you come across every now and then.  I only had a 12 oz bottle of beer but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  A little less beer didn't make any difference, nor did the fact that it was regular old Busch, not a fancy brand. Five minutes after this started simmering, I was salivating from the aroma and picking pieces out of the skillet.  I was lucky there was enough left at the end.  I could really make a whole meal out of this.  At the party, they went instantly and I had many recipe requests.  Highly recommended!!!

This recipe was so easy and delicious.  I needed a quick appetizer to bring to a cookout and this worked perfectly.  Everyone at the cookout asked for the recipe. I used Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and I also added a few dashes of Tabasco sauce because I wanted to give it a little kick.  I will definately make this again.

This has been a hit at every party I've been too. I like using Baby Ray's Sweet & Spicy BBQ sauce--gives it a nice kick. I make it as directed, and then I throw it into a crockpot about an hour before the party so that the sauce keeps getting thicker. Thanks for an awesome recipe! My mom always served this with mac & cheese and peas, and that's how I serve it to my kids, too.

Make these last night for a family gathering. Other than using chipotle kielbasa, I used the ingredients as outlined but made amount adjustments after reading all reviews. I used a small bottle of Corona beer, I think it's called a Coronita. Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce  and only about 1/8 cup light brown sugar. Mustard as called for. I browned the kielbasa in a skillet drained the fat and placed into a 2qt crock pot. Then combined the other ingredients into a sauce pan, brought to a boil and cooked on the stove top for about 1/2 hour to help reduce the liquid & beer. Topped the kielbasa with the sauce and cooked in the crock pot on high for about two hours. I came home with a clean pot. They were gobbled up. I'm glad I used the chipotle kielbasa. Nice and spicy.

I was looking for something different to do with kielbasa for our Super Bowl party. I had all the ingredients so I tried this. I made it as written, just halved everything because I only had 1lb meat. It was a huge hit! Everyone loved it. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought it was too salty.

I doubled the recipe (good thing they were all gone and people wanted more).  Next time I will triple it.  Easy to make.  I used an IPA and a bud light mixture.  Used Famous Dave's sweet and sassy BBQ sauce.  Cooked them and kept them in a crock pot to keep them warm.

Made these for a party and put everything in to the crockpot.  I wouldn't do it that way again as the sauce never thickened up.  If I make these again, I will put them on the stove first to get nice and thick...I think they will turn out better that way.  I have a lot left over!

I made this and made the following changes.  Added suggested crushed red pepper, garlic and Worcestershire.  Also added onion powder, bacon bits, Tbl. raspberry syrup, Tbl. red wine vinegar.  Seasoned it up nicely.  Final taste is like a bit stronger Carolina sauce.

I modified this with 12 oz gluten free beer. then also cut the BBQ sauce to 6 oz and matched it with 6oz of bourbon.  My guests could not get enough!  Soaked over night and heated in the oven then a heated serving platter.

Made this for my work department for Christmas holiday. Was easy to make  the night before, then put it in crock pot and let it warm up for three hours. Turned out great, sauce thickened up nicely and it tasted great. Will make it again.

I used all beef sausage rather than polish. Maybe that was my mistake.

Needed a 'beer tasting' app and this looked good.  As some mentioned, parboiled the sausage to remove some fat.  Added red pepper flakes, garlic powder and worchesthire with one of the red ales.  Put in the slow cooker for about 6 hrs.  It was still kinda watery  so I added a bit more bbq sauce.  Needs a little less brown sugar.  Everyone loved this dish.  With 8lbs, didn't even fill my slow cooker all the way.  Will use a bit less beer next time for a thicker sauce.

I made this in a covered pot in the oven. No other changes. Very yummy and easy.  Next time will add a can of  pineapple for an extra layer of flavor.

Had a family get together and wanted something new and good.  It turned out great.  I will add to my list for summer pool parties.  They were a great appetizer and then side for the meal.

It would have been better if I just put the kielbasa in BBQ sauce instead of this recipe.

So easy and wonderfully good.  Based on the previous comments, the bottle of barBQ sauce I bought was a hotter brand, and I really like the way they turned out.

This was a hit at a party I took this to recently. I did make a few changes though. My bf freaked out when I went to use one of his "good" beers so I used one of my dry hard ciders instead :) and left out the brown sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet. Used spicy mustard because I was out of dijon and added a few dashes of hot sauce. I also seared the kielbasa for a few minutes on each side to crisp it up some but that is a personal preference of mine. Overall, very tasty recipe.

Great recipe.  There were no leftovers meaning they we ALL eaten.  I added a little worstershire too.  Do not over cook, as the brown sugar added will make them burn.

For those of you who asked if you can make them ahead, the answer is absolutely yes.  I made the sauce and cooked the kielbasa for a little over an hour the night before I planned to serve them.  I put them in a baking dish and refrigerated overnight.  The next day I heated them in a 350 degree oven for about 40-50 minutes and served.  I used 12 oz. of beer and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and also added the worcestershire sauce recommended by some readers.  They were delicious and so easy.

Such a quick recipe to put together! I only used half the beer amount and because I didn't have Dijon mustard I used Honey mustard. The sauce was fairly thick because I used less beer. They were delicious!

Wow! I needed some quick munchies for an impromptu poker game, and these were just the ticket.  I used a Guinness and Sweet Baby Ray's, and when the kielbasa was gone (in minutes!) the guys were scooping up the thick sauce with club crackers.  I made a pound for four of us, and I only got to taste one piece!  Definitely worth a repeat, but I'll keep more kielbasa on hand in the future!!

These were wonderful! Made them for out Super Bowl Party and had nothing left! We doubled the receipe and 17 people wiped it out. I used Killian's beer and added some worchestershire sauce and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I also cooked mine in the crockpot and they only got better as the night went on! Definately a keeper!

Incredible flavor and easy.  People were eating them like a main dish instead of an appetizer.  I used a premium beer and it definitely enhaced the flavor.
