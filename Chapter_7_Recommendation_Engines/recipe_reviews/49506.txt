This is one of the best jello salad's we have eaten.  My family beg for it and always chide me for that zippy ingredient(horseradish).  I take it to church functions and they always ask for the recipe. I first tasted this delicious salad at a tiny cafe in Henrietta, Mo and have since sought the recipe...Thank you June Pelo for sharing.

This is absolutely DELICIOUS! The horseradish is more like a "secret" ingredient.  I've been trying lime jello salads for years trying to find the one my mom use to make.  I think this is it!

Even after cutting back on the mayo and leaving out the nuts, this is still a fabulous salad. Not too sweet and not too savory.

I can't get over how good this is!  You can even make it sugar-free, thanks to Splenda. It's a year 'round favorite at our house! I don't change a thing...

I first had this years and years ago and could have eaten most of it myself. I'm so happy to have found it again. Just try it and I'll bet it will be a favorite for you too.

I like jello salads and was looking for something different.  I thought it sounded a little odd, but with the good reviews decided to give it a chance. Not good!!! The mayo flavor is too strong and the horseradish is just plain gross.  It was not even good enough to suffer through.  I ate one serving and threw it out.  And I won't even tell you what my husband and children said about it 
;-)  Unless you're actually looking for this recipe, don't try it!!

Very tasty.  My children are not fond of any sort of jello salad and would not eat it, so I had it every day for a week until it was gone and I did not tire of it.  I used ground horseradish from the store, not a creamy preparation, and it was not too strong.  In fact no one could guess the mystery ingredient.

Too much mayo, for taste and fat.  Kids wouldn't eat, maybe if it had been sweeter?  Thought I remembered this from childhood, but didn't hit the mark.

Tasty. I was looking for a recipe like my sister has which has layers.  I tried to layer, and it tasted good, but the texture was off.

My mother in law has made this salad for probably 50 plus years.  She adds a small jar of drained pimento peppers to hers when she makes it for Christmas and adds a sour cream dressing on top.  It is one of my all time favorite salads that she makes.

My family calls this Falcon's Nest Salad and it is a tradition to have for Christmas and Thanksgiving.  The ingredients seem strange, but the results are amazing!  The cottage cheese, pineapple and nuts give it a texture that is unlike most jello salads that you think of.  

Side note, when my husband and I were dating he watched me make this and swore he wasn't going to eat it when I added the horseradish - he ended up polishing off the rest within 2 days!

Also, we use miracle whip instead of mayo for an added tang and instead of the unflavored gelatin we just use a package of lemon jello.

This is essentially the same as my momâ€™s recipe for what we call green Jell-O salad. LOL my mom got married in the 50s, so she has a gelatin salad for every holiday. Some of them are not so great, but this one is my favorite! It is usually served with ham, brown rice, asparagus salad, and deviled eggs. Sooo good!

This is so yummy.  I'm not big on jello anything but I gave this a try for summer hot weather cooking  and I am so so glad I did!  Its sweet, savory and the zing the horseradish gives it, well, wow just wow.  Everyone I have given this recipe to all say its addictive.  I did not use the gelatin addition, just the jello and cut the mayo to my taste about half a cup, pinapple chunks and 2 or more heaping  tablespoons of horseradish to your own taste and well....... YUM

January 24, 2015 - After reading some of the other reviews, I used only 3/4 of the amount of mayonnaise called for in this recipe, and found that to be ample.  I loved the taste of this, and will likely make it again, but it will have to be for myself only, as my partner found it too tart for his taste.  I did substitute chopped walnuts for the pecans, as that is what I had on hand. January 10, 2016 - I made this again a few days ago and reduced the mayonnaise even further to perhaps 5/8 of the amount called for in the original recipe. I also substituted 1/4 cup of the drained pineapple juice for an equal amount of the water in the recipe. I liked this version even better.
