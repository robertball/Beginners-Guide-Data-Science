I put these under the broiler instead of doing in the microwave. I also used Aloette instead of plain cream cheese. Added the slightest touch of cayenne. Topped with parmesan before putting in the oven.

This is an excellent stuffed mushroom recipe but needs a TWIST:  instead of filling with plain cream cheese, use aloutte/rondel flavored cheese spread instead.  They have several tasty flavors; I prefer the herb.  Use this in place of cream cheese and the mushrooms will have wonderful flavor.  I ususally place the cheese spread in the freezer for one hour before stuffing the mushrooms.  This way, the mushroom cooks thoroughly without burning the cheese.  The italian sausage on top is perfect!  Enjoy.

I used an 8 oz. cream cheese that I seasoned with minced garlic, oregano, thyme and pepper.  I did not have enough mushrooms, so I did as another suggested and placed it in an oven proof bowl and heated it in a 350Â° oven along with the 'shrooms.  I also topped the 'shrooms and the extra filling with shredded parmesan before baking.  WONDERFUL!!  Will make again and again and again and...well..you get the picture!

These were very good. I did them in the oven instead of the microwave, because I prefer it that way. A keeper, thanks.

These stuffed mushrooms were decent, but not great. The stuffing did not have a lot of flavor and you need to use larger mushrooms in order to fit the stuffing inside it.

Compared to more traditional stuffed mushroom recipes, this one took considerable less time without sacrificing much taste. Next time, I will top mine with a little parmesan for a bit of texture.

These are great!  If there is any stuffing left over I heat in a cassarole dish and serve with crackers or even skip stuffing mushrooms all together and use as a hot dip.  It is always a hit!!!
