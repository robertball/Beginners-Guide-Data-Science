My husband and I dine at Indian/Pakistani restaurants frequently.  I enjoy the cuisine, but my husband is a fanatic.  I finally made this recipe after adding it to my recipe box almost a year ago. It was so easy to prepare...I've avoided making this food at home because most recipes I've seen are very complicated.  I got all the spices needed and a large package af naan at an Indian grocery for only $8.00, much cheaper than a regular supermarket, IF you can even find all of them there.  The only change I made was that I added flour and water  right before serving to improve the consistency because the sauce was very thin.  I also simmered it over medium to medium-low heat rather than low, because it just didn't seem to be cooking. I served it over a bed of steamed basmati rice.  It turned out wonderful...very authentic and unbelievably easy.  My husband couldn't stop raving, and he wants me to make it often. Superb!

most delicious! I would just tell you that you can easily cut way back on the amount of oil suggested and it comes out great.  Would not change another thing!  thanks for the great Pakistani recipe.

I just had to review this again to let Shazia know that my husband loves this dish so much he requested it for his birthday dinner along with my naan.  We're both huge fans of Middle Easter cuisine and this is a wonderful dish.  For the previous reviewer I'd like to offer up a bit of advice as I've made this dish several times myself - it sounds as if you cooked the meat too long.  I find that sometimes, depending upon the cut of meat I use, it takes even less than 25 minutes to cook fully.  I cook only until the meat is just done and it comes out beautifully every time.  Thank you so much, Shazia, I hope to try more of your contributions soon!

This was a great dish. I used a more tender cut of steak, which is just what I had on hand, but the whole family enjoyed it. It is definitely worth trying, and I will be making it again. Thanks.

I made this last night for dinner and it was a hit!  My Mom cooks pasanday's and her recipe was far more complicated and even she commented how much better these were! 
My family loved it even my very fussy boys.

I made this with a pretty cheap cut of beef, so I sliced it extremely thinly while it was thawing. Marinated it overnight - cut back a little on the cloves, and added a lot more ginger/garlic paste. Served it over basmati rice with paratha. Very good! Thanks!

Made this with venison for a potluck dinner today and it was amazing. This is actually a pretty common dish in south-east asia not just in pakistan. I doubled the sauce and added some cubed up potatoes, carrots and beans, which I half fried beforehand. Most of the pasanday recipes  I saw before used whole cloves, cimmamon but marinating the meat with all the powdered spices definite had the best results.

Flavor was nice but meat was tough (even with eye of round simmered for an hour). Would definitely recommend cooking longer. I preferred the taste paired with a fresh lettuce and tomato salad served with extra yogurt like my middle eastern friends generaly serve.

This was truly delicious. I just used beef steak cut into bite size pieces, and cooked some basmati rice to eat on the side. Very easy to make, no hassle at all. My husband really loved it too! Great recipe, thnx a lot for sharing!

This was wonderful!!  I've never cooked beef like this before, but i will most definitely be making it this was again.  I didn't have the crushed red pepper or ginger garlic paste, so instead i used 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. fresh minced garlic, and 1/2 tsp. ground ginger. This had a beautiful flavor and cilantro as garnish only enhanced my taste experience :)

My husband is from Lahore and he thought it was great.  This recipe is a keeper.  I did cook it for a while (more than 25 minutes) as others had suggested.  I also dumped in a bunch of cilantro at the end rather than just using it as a garnish.

I use 2 large onions and after frying them whizz them in the blender with a little water. This helps to thicken the gravy.

This recipe is delicious!  My boyfriend and I make it regularly.  To make the meat even more flavorful when serving, make two batches of the yogurt mixture and serve one over the meat when it is done.

So flavorful!  Next time I will only use 1 tsp. of salt, and I will add 1 Tbsp. flour to thicken the sauce.  Otherwise, it was perfect!

Easy to follow recipe. Beef was still tough after 1 hour on a low flame. I transfered the contents to a slowcooker and continued to cook on high until tender.

This turned out delicious, but to really be fall apart tender it needed to be simmered for much longer than 25 minutes. I used top round and simmered for close to an hour and a half. It could have even been simmered longer, but we were hungry! I also added a little flour to the sauce to thicken it up just a little bit, it definately didn't need any added water, there was plenty of liquid.

Even better the next day!  I will try marinating it longer next time.  Good level of heat and the lemon helps "lift" the flavours a bit.   Just made it this week and the hubby said we need to have again soon!

This was very good.  I used buffalo meat instead of beef, and it took longer to cook to a tender consistency than the recipe indicated, but my husband said it was very authentic, and it had a delightful taste.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but this was just ok for me.  I was really looking forward to it...I don't know if I'm just not an "Indo-Paki" kind of cook but I've had trouble making anything that really tastes like its authentic...or that I would serve to my Paki friend.  I did cook the meat a lot longer because it took some time to tenderize, and I also marinated it overnight in the yogurt mixture.  I didn't think it had enough spice to it.  It was edible, but I wouldn't make again.

Can't imagine what I did wrong, since the recipe is so straightforward but this was a total miss for me. Meat was tough and the sauce was so blah no one wanted more than one helping.

This recipe was great! I've made haleem and nihari before but I've never made pasanday. This recipe was great -- I did not expect to find an authentic Pasanday recipe on allrecipes, and it was so easy too. 
I did make some changes BUT I don't think the original recipe really needed it -- I added 2 tablespoons of vinegar in the marinade and skipped lemon juice at the end. Also added a few more spices to the marinade: added one green cardamom pod, 4 black peppercorns,  1 teaspoon garam masala, 1 very small cinnamon stick, 2 tablespoon chickpea flour (besan), 1/2 teaspoon white cumin. 

Garnished in the end with lemon wedges, cilantro, julienned ginger, and green chili slices. 

Served with naan. Delicious!

Quicker than most curry dishes, but flavorful.  I would probably cook it a little longer next time, for tenderness.

Cut the meat as thin as possible. Could not find black cumin, so used regular cumin.  Served with Naan.

Delicious.

This is a family favorite. I have been making it from this recipe for a long time now and we get cravings for this wonderful recipe! You can add more spice if you do roast, I like to have a roast I marinate it with all the dry spices then add more to the yogurt sauce to taste and we eat it on pita Naan from Allrecipes!

This dish is great!
Be careful to not over cook the meat or keep it very low temperature for a more extended period of time.
The flavor is wonderful. Has been very well enjoyed by both family and guests, and I will absolutely be making this again, frequently, in the future. (plus it's fairly inexpensive and easy, bonus!)

Listening to other users worried about toughness, I tried using cube steak instead of beef cubes or stew meat.   I also added a dash of cardamom to the marinade, and added mixed peppers to the onion.  I suppose you could add a can of beer to the pot liquid.  Not exactly a Pakistani thing but might make a good addition.  The cube steak was still a little tough.  Perhaps cooking in a pressure cooker or marinating overnight might make a difference.   I will try that next time.

This was very good! The only thing I did differently was to cook two green chilies with the onions.  Then, I just added a little cornstarch to thicken the gravy up a little. I would also reduce the oil by about half next time.

Was not a fan. The meat was tough on the outside and chewy not a lot of flavour. Not my thing

My husband is Indian so I'm always on the lookout for an Indian or Pakistani dish that isn't too difficult to make. My husband actually loves this dish!! The only thing I do differently is cook it in a pressure cooker, makes the meat so tender!! Very simple and flavorful dish!

My husband is Pakistani.  His family came over for a visit and I made this for dinner.  They were amazed that I could make such an authentic Pakistani dish and they loved it.  I thought we would have leftovers for lunch but everyone kept going back for more till it was all gone.  So flavorful and the meat was so tender.  I made it with basmati rice.  I will definitely make this again it was delicious!

Too much salt and too much oil even though I cut back on the oil by about 1/4 cup. Not alot of flavor either even though I used fresh garlic and ginger(doubled it). The meat was nice and tender though.
