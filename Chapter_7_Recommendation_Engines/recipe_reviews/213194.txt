Very good recipe!  I made it as stated, but there is so much you can do with this base to personalize to your own liking.  But the cooking directions, perfect... I wouldn't change a thing!  Definately juicy!  Plus the pork/beef combo is excellent!

I had to half the recipe, but it turned out wonderfully. The meat came out moist and tender, perfect for piling on a fresh roll. I will most definitely be making this again!

This was  good but I thought it needed a little bit of sweetener so I added about 1/4 cup of brown sugar to add the oomph we needed. Pot roast is $5 a pound here so I would be inclined to make this with all pork shoulder because the beef didn't seem to make a big difference as far as flavor and texture. Very good with my change. Thanks for sharing!

Threw the whole works into the crockpot on high for six hours.  Let it cool, strained the fat off, shredded the meat and put it back into the juices to reheat.  Everyone agreed that this was fantastic!

I did this with a 7.3lb pork roast in a crock pot. I started it on high for 3 hours then changed to low for an additional 8 hours. I'm not crazy about pork, this was AMAZING!!
