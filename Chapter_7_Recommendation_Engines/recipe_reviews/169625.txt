I don't want to even think about how many of these I ate... The only change I made was to lightly sprinkle the mushrooms with a mixture of breadcrumbs and Parmesan. These were absolutely delicious! Thanks so much, Leslie!

These are the first stuffed mushrooms I've ever eaten. They were very easy to make, but the flavors were very, very strong. The filling by itself was delicious, but it didn't seem to combine with the flavor of the mushroom very well. My mom and I ate them, and liked them to an extent, but no one else in my family cared for these. Thanks for sharing, but I think I will try a different recipe next time.

These are very good. I used shredded parmesan instead of grated because it was what I had today. Next time I would saute the mushroom stems and add them to the filling. Thanks for the recipe!

TASTY! I admit I was skeptical when I was trying out the cream cheese before it baked, but after the mushrooms coming out of the oven I couldnt help myself. I add a sprinke or two of mozerella cheese to the mixture and it came out really well, and I got that nice melted cheese taste to it. I topped the top of the mushrooms with panko bread crumbs to give it an extra crunch with the parm cheese and it was delicious! Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe!! I made a few changes though. I sauteed the mushroom is olive oil and minced garlic before baking. I also added scallions to my cream cheese filling and Italian bread crumbs on top. I have made these twice, once with regular cream cheese and once with low fat cream cheese. I prefer the low fat cream cheese. They seem almost too rich with regular cream cheese, I know that is just a matter of personal preference. I would rate this recipe five stars with low fat cream cheese!

Good, simple recipe. My only addition was green onions to the cream cheese mixture and seasoned bread crumbs mixed with parmesan sprinkled on top. These baked a little longer as well, but it was probably due to the fact that I bought larger mushrooms with big stems (for better stuffing room!).  These are very rich as well, so eat sparingly.

My mom and I have been making this recipe for decades.  It's one of our favorites! Only difference is we don't use any parmesan cheese but we add about 4 Tablespoons of chopped green onion. The onion adds great flavor and complements the cream cheese and bacon. Rather than baking for 40 min., we put them under the broiler for 5-8 min.

Perfect.  I took the advice of other's and sauteed the mushroom stems in the bacon grease and then adding them to the stuffed mixture and they turned out perfect.  I have shared this recipe with others who also love it.

Outstanding, I added some pimentos on top just for the look. See the picture I added. The red under it is just a red silicone pad to rest the hot dish on.

Everyone loved this recipe! Made a couple of changes, sauted stems with bundle of green onions in butter and a touch of the bacon grease. Added a touch of salt. Added bacon crumbles instead of cooking it myself. Basically this is an awesome recipe to build off of. I'm so glad I found it this is the first time I have ever made these and my DH was eating them blazing hot from the oven he loved them so much and this man just doesn't do that. LOL

Delicious addition to our New Year's Eve celebration! I made two simple changes: added shredded Mozarella cheese and the chopped stems to the mixture prior to stuffing the mushroom caps.

Delicious!! I made these for my sister and ended up with so much stuffing left over (I winged the proportion of mushrooms) . I put the left over stuffing on my bagel this morning  and it was AWESOME!

These were wonderful!  Portabellas were on sale this week and we were doing a BBQ, so I decided to grab a couple packages to add as an appetizer.  The only things I did differently was include some of the stems chopped up per other suggestions...and we put them on the grill to cook!  Yum!  It's so simple yet tastes like it took a lot of work!

AWESOME!!!  I have tried several stuffed mushroom recipes and have tried to create my own and they were always good, not great.  These are incredible!!!  The bacon is a very subtle flavor.  I used reduced fat cream cheese, and like I said, they were incredible.  I will no longer by stuffed mushrooms from our local deli nor mess around with other recipes. Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Very rich, but tasted good.  Great start for someone who has never made stuffed mushrooms before.  Now I have a basis for adding my own flare next time.

Very good! Also added chopped up stems and sautéed with garlic. Instead of cooking bacon I took the lazy way out and added real bacon bits...was still good. Topped w/ combo of breadcrumbs and parm. and worked fab!

First time I have ever made stuffed mushrooms.  These were so simple.  They were delicious! After reading other reviews I did chop up the stems and added them to the mix.  These were so good, I almost ate them all.  I can't wait to make them again.

These were great - even the non mushroom eater in my house liked them! I chopped up the mushroom stems and used them in the filling as well. I used 1/3 fat cream cheese and shredded Parmesan cheese. The first time I made them, the filling had a little pesto and sundried tomato mixed in and they were really great!

These were ok, I think the parmesan cheese is a little overwhelming. I would make these again but I wont be adding the parmesan and may try to give it a sweet kick instead.

Very nice.  Easy and quick to prepair.  Used gruyere cheese in half of cheese ingredients (not cream cheese)as needed to use.   Also, used 2 Portobella mushrooms.

I really liked these, but my husband said he thought they were just "okay".  It is very cheesy, so I guess it could used something else mixed in it to give it more texture.  I did use scallions and some bread crumbs, which did help.  I would make them again.

This was so easy and really yummy.  The only thing that I did different was to chop up the stems and add them back to the cream cheese.

Used Cremini caps and made some modifications.  I added smoked cheddar and a little mozzarella.  With the smoked cheddar, I figured I could pass on the bacon.  I had some in the freezer, but didn't want to defrost it.  Once they were on the cookie sheet, I drizzled a little olive oil over them, just to keep them moist as the caps cooked.  So here's my version of the topping: Smoked cheddar, mozzarella, parmesan, cream cheese, bread crumbs, cold butter, onion powder, garlic powder, a pinch each of cayenne and chili powder.  I mixed with my hand until it was crumbly and then added about a teaspoon of olive oil to make it moist.  They came out amazingly flavorful and my house smelled so good with that smoked cheddar.  I highly recommend it.  A little goes a long way.  I'm planning on doing this with portabellos next.

This is a great recipe to use as a foundation. I modified it by dicing the mushroom stems and adding them to the filling. I also added 2 tbsp blue cheese crumbles and a few shakes of cayenne pepper. After baking I sprinkled on a bit more cayenne for color and some extra kick.

These are great!! Make them for every occasion at request. I took advice of other people and added in green onion and used Turkey bacon and light cream cheese. We used the left over filling as  pretzel dip and it was great.

I've tried lots of stuffed mushroom recipes and these are my favorite!  I add Panko breadcrumbs over the top.  It's the perfect crispy texture to go with these savory mushrooms!

VERY good,  I don't like to waste any of the mushroom. I chopped the stems, and sauteed them in a little of the bacon. Very creamy, and Delicious.

I decided to try out this recipe when we had friends over a couple of weeks ago.  My husband and I figured you can't go wrong with cream cheese and bacon.  They were a BIG hit!  Everyone loved them and they were gone almost as quickly as they were served.  I used the "baby bella" mushrooms, and sprinkled on a bit more fresh ground pepper as well as paprika before popping them in the oven - delicious!  Will absolutely make again . . . and again.

This recipe was delish, i made some changes which ended up working out. I put chopped scallions in the mixture and added bacon bits instead of bacon (thats all I had) surprisingly it was still very good.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made this several times.  The only change is that I sometimes use turkey bacon instead of regular bacon.  Always a big hit!

THESE ARE DELICIOUS.
I've made these twice now, and both times my family has devoured them and asked for more. I don't think I would make any changes to this recipe.
Also, if you have any of the filling left over, it tastes amazingggg on toast or bagels.

This recipe was good, but I did make some changes.  In the filling I added sauteed green pepper and the stems and put the slice parmesan instead of grated.  They were delicious!

Made these last night.  Easy and yummy! I added a bit of onion and garlic because I didn't have Worcestershire sauce and needed to add a bit of flavour.

THIS WAS AN AWESOME RECIPE, I did alter it by leaving out the parm and added a 1/4 finley chopped onion and two garlic cloves. Egg washed them,  breaded the mushroom caps before deep frying till golden brown. I did sprinkle grated parm over the top when they came out of the fryer. 
AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!

These were yummy, my daughter really liked the blend of the cream cheese and Worcestershire sauce together.  Of coarse the bacon always makes things good too.  The only reason I gave a 4 instead of a 5 was because I've made 2 others off this site that were  amazing 5's, but these are still worth trying, very simple.

I made these as an appetizer for my Christmas dinner two years ahold, and they were a huge hit! My husband isn't a mushroom fan and he ate them! I chopped up some scallions and the mushroom stems and sautéed them in olive oil and garlic before adding them into the cream cheese mixture. They are quite rich due to the cream cheese, so I highly recommend using low fat cream cheese. I had some leftover cream cheese mixture, and I spread it on a wheat cracker to make a nice snack.

As is, this recipe was good.  They were eaten quickly by everyone.  The second time I made them I changed a few things and wound up liking them a lot better.  I chopped up the mushroom stems and sauteed them in the bacon grease, and added that to the cream cheese/bacon mixture.  I left out the Worcestershire and instead used a teaspoon of hot sauce.  Instead of parmesan cheese I used panko breadcrumbs.  At the end I mixed in about half a tablespoon of chopped chives.  These were amazing.

These are great! I just add a little mixture of panko and bread crumbs. Everytime I make them people ask me to make them for the next get together.

I made them for myself a few days later with fat free cream cheese, but they weren't as good.

On the advice of others i added green onions, garlic, and the chopped stems in the cream cheese mixture.  i also put bread crumbs on top.  Cooking time was almost doubled as well.  They were delicious and  i will definitely make these again. i am only giving it 4 stars though because i had to add so much to give it flavor and texture.

I prepared these mushrooms for Easter, they came out very well, after 35 minutes instead of the posted 30. the mushrooms seemed to be more tender and he filling was cooked through. I also added more bacon for a crispier texture.

Absolutely amazing!  I kept in oven a bit longer...like 40 minutes to get my filling to brown and added a bit more worcestershire (5 drops).  I could have eaten all of these in one sitting!

I checked the other reviews first, so I made some adjustments. Put the stems in the mix, I didn't want to waste them. I also added some fresh parsely and garlic. Turned out great! I also put some breadcrumbs on top and broiled for the last couple of minutes. Everyone loved them. I will be making these again.

These are ok but, for us, need some bite in the flavor. Adding a touch of hot sauce or cayenne to the mix opens the flavors.

Yum!!!  I did embellish a bit though...I add just a touch of crumbled dehydrated minced onion and a dash of garlic powder.  I've also had these made with breakfast sausage.  Both are excellent!

I love these and have made them so many times now! I make a few changes but not much. I like to add a little mozzarella to the filling as well as a handful of 2 of finely chopped spinach (I like to overstuffed the mushrooms so this helps the filling go farther)
I also add panko breadcrumbs to the top and it takes this recipe to a whole new level. I now make these almost every week as either the main course or as a hefty side

These were delicious!  A great savory finger food for a party I was hosting.  Love the crunch of the bacon.

I don’t even like mushrooms, and I LOVED these. I stumbled across the recipe on accident and improvised a little. I used turkey bacon instead of normal bacon, for the health aspect, I added some garlic powder to the stuffing, and I didn’t have any worchestshire sauce, so I added a LITTLE BBQ sauce. I also winged it on the amounts because I only had 4 mushrooms left over. Added chopped chives on top after cooking. Loved it.

These were a great appetizer to serve.  Once the mushrooms sit out for a little bit they get cold and are not as good to eat.  I would recommend serving them as an appetizer to be eaten while other food is finishing.  We will be making this again as a quick and easy appetizer.

I heeded the reviews of others and limited the parm to 1 tbsp in the cream cheese mix (you could still def taste it) and used Mexican melting cheese for the tops.  Also used 4 slices bacon and sauteed mushroom stems in the bacon grease then added to cream cheese mix.   Used crimini's and they were delicious!!

They were absolutely delicious. My husband is not a big mushroom eater, but he was when I made these. 
I made a few changes. First, no bacon & I sauteed them in olive oil just to give them a nice coating. 
I made sure I would have leftovers & boy, they were so much better reheated. My husband is asking,  will I be making them again soon ?

This is a good recipe, however next time I would use low sodium bacon as I found it a bit salty with the bacon and parmesan cheese.

I wasn’t thrilled with the consistancy of the stuffing.  After I Stuffed the mushrooms and baked them I was hoping the cheese would melt and adhere to the mushroom.  That didn’t happen.

No. I pretty much followed to the letter and I just didn’t make enough. My Grandkids said they didn’t care for mushrooms but when I took them out of the oven, I had to fight them off and my husband ate so many that he couldn’t eat his dinner. This ones a keeper

These were very tasty.  It's the  first time I've ever made these.  I followed others advice and added a few green onions and used some of the mushroom stems in the filling as well.  I will be making again I think. Thank you for sharing your recipe

These are great if you change...everything. Made as is there is no flavor and way to much filling. Half the cream cheese,  dice and add the stems sauteed with garlic, add chives, add salt, pepper, garlic salt and a dash of cayenne. Add bread crumbs sprinkled on top. Youre welcome.

I was excited about making these, especially based on the reviews. Unfortunately, they were just ok.  Not enough flavor or consistency to them.  I have another stuffed mushroom recipe that includes bread crumbs,  and the flavor and texture is much better.

These were just so-so; kind of bland taste.  Don't know what I did wrong (if anything) because I followed the recipe, but the mushrooms and filling were just mushy.   will not make again.

This tasted awesome and very easy to make. I had one change, instead of opening a pack of bacon. I finely chopped up some deer sausage that was fried for breakfast this morning. I know I will cook it again and probably wont have deer sausage around so I will cook as directed and know it will be just as good.

I used baby portobellos, and half a package of sausage instead of bacon. I also added a bit of mozzarella. I chopped the stems and added them to the sausage while I was cooking it, and I covered the inside and outsides of the mushrooms in garlic butter and baked them for 10 minutes before stuffing. I added a mixture of Parmesan and oat flour the last 5 minutes of baking. Yummy!!! One day I'll make them as written, because those look delicious, too! :)

If you want to actually fill 1 pound of mushrooms, double the recipe for the filling. This recipe only produces enough filling to stuff 1/2 pound of mushrooms, unless you're just using a little tiny dab in each of them.

Other than that, these are AMAZING! The only thing I changed was: I sprinkled more parmesan over the top when they were almost done cooking. They were a big hit and I'll be making them a go-to when I want to "wow" people!

These were one of the best stuffed mushrooms I have ever made.  It was so simple and quick to put together.  I took these to a covered dish dinner and the double batch I made was the first to go.  I have so many requests for the recipe.  I did make one mistake.  Somehow I read one 8oz cream cheese instead of a half bar.  It just made it creamier and gave me enough filling for 18-20 well filled mushrooms.  I also stuffed portabella mushroom caps and it made a great side dish for a dinner.  Love this recipe.

I thought these just average, but others really liked them.  Very cream cheese tasting and I even followed other reviewers advice and added chopped gr. onions, fresh chives, and some of the stems  from the mushrooms.  I also topped them with panko bread crumbs.  I will make these again but with less creamed cheese, and more onions, stems.....

I made it as per the recipe instructions but was a bit disappointed.  We felt as though it was too predominately cream cheesy. I may alter it but will probably just try a different recipe.

Very creamy and flavorful, but it was more cream cheese than mushroom. Next time I think I'll cut the cream cheese in half and mix in bread crumbs.

I have made this many times. Each time I chop up the stems and sauté them in a little bit of the bacon grease along with some with finely diced onion and garlic. Then i add that to the stuffing mixture. It intensifies the mushroom flavor.

I have no idea what I did wrong with this recipe.  I mean it's a no brainer right?  Well no?

I used large Portobello mushrooms and they collapsed in the oven!  Flattened like a pancake.

They taste nice but look very very wrong.  Now I'm wondering if I should have used some breadcrumbs in the filling to give it some more body?

Eager to hear from others especially if this happened to them.

Just made these. I made 2 test batches - one with pork bacon and one with turkey bacon, since my husband can't eat pork. Both were good - turkey was more mild and gave a cheesier taste while pork definitely had a "meatier" flavor. Other than the turkey alternative, I made the recipe as stated and thought it was delicious. This is the recipe I'm going to make for potlucks at work from now on - it's ridiculously easy with a lot of flavor.

Added garlic, breadcrumbs, and basted in garlic butter. They still needed more bite. More garlic perhaps.

They were absolutely fantastic, wanted to find a recipe without bread crumbs and thought I'de try this, not disappointed. Wife and I loved them. Had a lot of leftover cream cheese, which goes pretty good on a bagel and crackers ;)

I just made these for our pre-dinner appetizer and they are really delicious and easy to make!I didn't change a thing. I make my own version of stuffed mushrooms that are yummy but call for more ingredients and prep time, so these are great when I want something quick and yummy.

Yummy!  I replaced the bacon with bacon bits and omitted the Parmesan cheese sprinkled over.  They were a hit at our table - even with our fussy eater!

I think these mushrooms were good, but not great.  I agree with other reviewers that they need something more in the cream cheese mixture.  Maybe green onion?  Something with some crunch.  They do get 5 stars for ease of preparation though. I will make them again and add my own touches, possibly panko crumbs like others suggested.

As usual, for me at least, I prepare recipes from this site as-written the first time then decide changes I'll make the next time .. otherwise the review, good or bad, is invalid for the original.
This is a really good recipe as is. They came out really good with great flavor and presentation.
NEXT TIME I will add a little garlic powder, bread crumbs, and possibly a bit of diced jalapenos. I will also increase the amount of bacon as I really like the combination of bacon and jalapenos.

Perfect!  Even the kid that hates cheese and said he didn't like the look of them loved them!  Just wish I could add it to my recipe box on Allreceipes.  The button won't work.

This was delicious and was a hit! I added some chives into the cream cheese stuffing and instead of Parmesan cheese, I added mozzarella on top. It was great! I will make this again.

My husband LOVED this recipe!  I substituted the bacon for ground pork. A 1/2 lb will easily stuff a dozen caps.  Definitely a recipe that will be made again!

These were incredible!  Only thing I did different was too cook and add the mushroom stems to the filling as other reviewers suggested.  Everybody wants these for the next holiday!

Yum! These were good! I added two things, but other than that made it just like directed. I added: breadcrumbs to the top of the mushrooms and I sauteed the stems in the bacon grease and added them to the filling. Delicious!

Yum.  After filling, I pressed the tops into a bowl of parmesan instead of sprinkling over the top - it seemed to coat them better that way.  Cooked 30 minutes.
