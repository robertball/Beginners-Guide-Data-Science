I used oatmeal instead of bread, which gave this meal a more meaty feel. Also, instead of oyster sauce, I substituted with hot sauce, which really gave it a nice flavor! Tasty!

Very good! I used steak sauce instead of oyster sauce like someone suggested.  It did fall apart so next time I'm going to try chopping up the mushrooms.  The larger slices seemed to be what made it fall apart.

These are really flavorful and delicious. I used olive oil instead of cooking spray and found that, along with 
hand shaping the burgers, it helped keep them together. A real winner.

I was pleasantly surprised with this! I read other reviews first and IF you do make these changes:
-Chop the mushrooms
-Use 2 eggs
-Fry in 2-3 tbsps of oil
They will act (and even look) like hamburger meat. Awesome.

I recently became a vegetarian and I must say, this is one of my favorite veggie burger recipes. On adding oatmeal the texture did in fact become meat like, very tasty. I used soy instead of oyster sauce. I also baked it for 20 minutes (don't have cooking spray)

This was a great recipe because it allows for great variation as well as lots of veggies! I also love how it's relatively low in calories and fat. It tasted wonderful and I would definitely make it again.

I have thrown away all my other veggie burger recipes (with beans, lentils, garbanzos etc.) and will only make this recipe. I added 1 cup of oatmeal and sprinkled on some ground flaxseed which really binded it together well. Tastes like a real hamburger!

This was an incredible alternative to meat burgers.  Mine fell apart when I tried to cook them in patties, but the made a grat filling for pita!

I let the mixture cool in the fridge for an hour after I added the egg to increase cohesiveness. This worked and the burgers stuck together much better than if I'd tried to form them right away. However, the still needed to be handled with care. I fried them over low heat on the largest burner. We don't eat oysters, so I used 1 TB each of Worshire sauce and soy sauce. I also used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs (instant). The burgers came out very meaty and flavorful. Will definitely make these again!

Oyster sauce is an acquired taste so you may want to try steak sauce or another family favorite.  Also added a little panko flakes to hold the burger together.

The flavor of this is something I really enjoyed, however it didn't stay together.  I'll have to play with it some more since it's a rather decent base product.

This was an excellent recipe. One of my family members accidently grabbed one of my burgers, and the only difference he could tell was that it was a little bit sweeter then normal. The only thing I didnt like was how they kept crumbling, so I put the mushrooms in my chopper until it was almost like a paste and then I added an extra teaspoon of barbecue sauce. It turned out great thanks for posting this recipe.

I absolutely loved this recipe and have made it 4 times since discovering it 3 weeks ago! I've tried mushroom burgers before, but they've never tasted like this! My version is slightly different. I use 2 giant portabella mushroom caps (chopped), 1/2 white onion, 1/2 cup Panko japanese style bread crumbs, 2 tbsp A1 steak sauce and 1 egg and shape into 4 patties. I serve on reduced calorie wheat toast (35 calories per slice). My modified version comes to only 71 calories per patty (or 141 total with the toast) and they're SO delicious! They're terrific served with a light soup or sweet potato fries!

These were pretty good - like most reviewers I had trouble keeping them in patties but had some success by letting them fry on each side longer than I normally would have.  That seemed to glue them together some.  Also, the smaller the 'burger' the better they stayed together.  I wasn't a huge fan of the oyster sauce taste (by the way, look in your asian food section or wherever soy sauce is if you're having trouble finding it) but that's a personal preference.  Next time I may try some steak sauce instead.

Great!  I used olive oil instead of cooking spray, and used soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce in place of oyster sauce.  Grilled on the BBQ, topped with grilled onions, tomato, lettuce and Trader Joe's Greek feta dressing.  YUM!

Wonderful recipe! Even my meat loving hubby enjoyed this burger. Very nice change frrom a beef burger. Made the recipe with Cattleman's Spicy sauce instead of Oyster sauce, used 1/4 cup corn flake crumbs and omitted the salt and pepper. Added two cloves of chopped garlic to the frypan with the mushroom and onion. I let the mixture cool and then shaped in to patties and wrapped with wax paper. I refridgerated them until later in the day and heated them in a skillet on medium heat for 5 minutes a side. I topped them with cheddar slices and placed the pan under the broiler for a couple minutes to melt the cheese. Delicious! Thanks will definitly make this one again!!

These were very good! I took the advice of others and chopped the mushrooms. To the onion-mushroom mixture, I omitted the oyster sauce and added freshly chopped basil, parsley and garlic. I used instant oatmeal instead of bread crumbs. The burgers were moist and held together. I made some burgers in a frying pan and some baked in the oven at 400 for 25 minutes. Both were good!

Adding one more egg to the mixture and frying in oil rather than cooking spray helps firm it up (much like eggs foo yung).  Using toasted whole grain bread crumbs gives it a little more hearty flavor. I added a little garlic and chili powder just because I like the flavor.

I made this the other night.  It was yummy even though I didn't have the oyster sauce.  I can't seem to find it anywhere.  In any case, I ended up having it for dinner and the leftovers for breakfast along with my eggwhites.

I adored this! I heeded previous reviews, though, and added an extra slice of bread and an extra egg, and made sure to slice my mushrooms until they were very small. I also added wheat germ after cooking the mushroom mix to reassure it'd stick, and it did, though I kept the portions small. About the length of my balled fist (though I am a teenage girl, so keep that in mind). Substituted oyster sauce for soy sauce. Very delicious!

So delicious! Definitely chop the mushrooms and use 2 eggs. I used green onions because it's what I had on hand, garlic, and Worcestshire sauce instead of oyster sauce. I also used bread crumbs and wheat germ and eye-balled the amount I needed before and after I added the eggs. Handforming the patties worked really well because if they fell apart I just added more breadcrumbs/wheat germ. Like other reviewers I fried the patties in 2-3 TBS of oil and they kept their form. This is going in my rotation!

Great taste!  I omitted the egg and used a vegetarian oyster sauce to make it vegan; the burgers didn't form patties, but they still made a very flavorful loose sandwich filling.  Definitely a keeper.

Really loved this recipe - used 1/2 bread crumbs (whole wheat) and 1/2 oatmeal with Cattle Boys BBQ Sauce instead of oyster sauce and it was to die for! My husband insisted we make these again the very next night.

these were awesome. my boyfriend engulfed 3 in minutes. I suggest using plenty of seasoned bread crumbs to make these form cakes before placing on skillet. make sure to chop the onion and mushrooms very small, this will also help to keep them in burger form. cooking them long enough on each side helps too. i will try making them vegan in the future. also, i used steak sauce...oyster sauce did not seem like it would match this sandwich to me at all. also, i did not use the olive oil method others have used. i just sprayed the pan with canola oil and it worked perfectly!

Pretty darn good. I made a few changes: soy sauce rather than oyster sauce and bread crumbs rather than bread slices. They were very wet, but I found they held together alright if you made them small enough.

Very bland and messy.  I added some garlic.  The mixture was too loose to form into patties so I wrapped it in the lettuce.

This was pretty darn good. I followed recipe and added caramelized onions. The provolone melted so nicely - yummy! I thought I would miss the meat but I did not at all. I actually felt full and satisfied after eating. I will definitely make again.

I would have given it 5star, found the patty a bit dry.Had no other problem.chopped the mushrooms thin bite size pieces, added 1/2cup oats&1/2cup bread crumbs (as recommended)&bbq sauce insted of oyster. Baked the patties 400f for 25 min. Tasted really good &when layered with burger with few other things it was fine.but the patty on its own was a bit dry . overall good.thanks

I fixed this tonight.  It is very tasty!  However, mine was far too moist and would not "pattie" at all. (I did chop the mushrooms as suggested in the reviews)  Used it kind of like sloppy joes, and it worked out okay.   Think next time I will use a different filler, or as someone else said, a good mixture for pitas, or even for tortillas.   Used lettuce, thin slice of onion and tomato. Very good - my husband had seconds and really liked it.   Will try it again for sure.

I tried some of the recommendations on the reviews, like using olive oil and oatmeal but my mushroom patty still didn't stick together. They were right about the texture and taste though, almost like real meat! I used habanero plus oyster sauce and I loved the taste! It's a great low calorie meal, just easy on the toppings.

Great recipe. for those having problems with it sticking together, the mushrooms must be chopped and I changed the bread to half breadcrumbs and half wheat gluten. I love it chunked up like hamburger and put in a wrap with sauteed onions and peppers plus some vegan cheese for a Philly Cheesesteak wrap.

This was a good basic recipe but I had a problem with them holding their shape.  So I made a few changes.  I did not cook the mushrooms and onions before mixing.  This reduced the amount of liquid but still retained the delicious taste.  Also I substituted dried bread cubes ground (bread crumbs) for the white bread.  I basically mixed everything together and baked in the oven 10 minutes per side.  Wonderful.  And so much less expensive than boca burgers. Yummy!

I gave this recipe a four star rating because it is delicious but I had to do some extra prep, likely because of how it was prepared by me. I chopped my mushrooms and onion in my food processor. The onion came out too finely chopped and somewhat watery- my fault of course- but it affected the cooking. I used worcesteshire and soy sauce to flavor mine and they were delicious. I also used half rolled oats and half bread crumbs, and I added some garlic as well. The mixture was very soft and wet, so I scooped "patties" onto a baking sheet and baked them at 400 for about 12 minutes to set them, then I froze them to eat for lunches throughout the week. They came out very good and even though they were still soft it didn't really matter much to me. I put them on one of those 100 calorie rolls with some veggie cheese and lettuce and they were awesome.

Even though I love mushrooms, I wasn't completely sold on this dish.  I still give it 4-stars though because it wasn't bad.  I didn't really care for the taste of the oyster sauce (which I hadn't used in any dishes before), and like others, I did have trouble getting it to stay together.  Like another reviewer, I would also recommend trying cutting up the mushrooms in smaller pieces to see if that helps hold together better.  And maybe, if I try this again, I'll try a different sauce.  I love the idea of steak sauce, but it might not be thick enough.  We'll see...

I hate mushrooms. Just straight up portobello mushroom burgers are not edible to me, but this was good. I cant really rate the recipe because I didnt cook it as writen. We didnt have normal mushrooms so I had to use one portobello and hope that it was about a pound (and it was far from it) so I added peas as more veggies and used oatmeal to stick it together because adding more bread didnt work- the members of my household refuse to let me make it the way it was written now.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I did chop the mushrooms and it seemed to help keep them in "patties",but I also found that they were a little too wet so I added more bread crumbs than it called for.  Also didn't have oyster sauce, so used veggie broth instead which gave it great flavor!  They are very tasty when served with lettuce tomato onion and cheese and stuck under the broiler.

I gave this a 4 star because I tweeked the recipe.  I used some of the previous suggestions.  I chopped the mushrooms, used A-1, added a handful of parmasan cheese and added bread crumbs a handful or 2.   I would suggest refrigerate an hour or 2 before cooking, to keep them together better.  I couldn't wait.....absolutely delicious with siracha mayo spread, slice of onion and spinach! !!

Like other reviewers, I used old fashioned rolled oats (instead of bread) and soy sauce (instead of oyster sauce). I cooked the mushrooms and onions in olive oil and  even used some frozen mushrooms. I baked them at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, flipping them after 20 minutes. Some patties held together better than others, but I suspect that was partly due to the extra moisture from the frozen mushrooms. My hubby and I both really liked these and he liked them so much he said he'd be happy if I made them every week. Thank you for the recipe!

These turned out better than I anticipated! Mushrooms were on sale and I'm a sucker for a deal...  I'm sure I amended the recipe somehow, but it's been a while.

I skipped the onion and used soy sauce instead of oyster sauce.  They were good.  Mine crumbled in the pan, but I put them in a pita was happy with the result.

I have trouble keeping them together, but when they fall apart I just add some homemade spaghetti sauce and have some really healthy spaghetti.

My husband and I both thought that these were horrible. They fell apart and you could not make it stick into a pattie. They were very bland and nothing would help them. I threw it all out and made something else.
