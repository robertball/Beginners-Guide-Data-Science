I made this recipe vegetarian and it turned out pretty darn good and was so easy to make. I put a little olive oil on the bottom of the pot then put the veggies on first. Then the soy sauce. I used one bag of frozen morningstar farm crumbles and put them on top and cooked for an hour. I will make this again very low in fat and carbs with the veggie crumbles.

I followed the recipe only I simmered it on the stove to cook faster. It was pretty good & tastey for such simple ingredients.

I've been making this for my family for about a year and it is always a hit! Perfect for chilly Spring weather and full of goodness. The only changes I make are to add some minced garlic on top of the hamberger and (in this batch) I used red and yellow bell peppers because they are what I had on hand. The result is a beautiful nourishing meal even my picky eaters are happy to see served.

I couldn't believe you just toss thing on a pot and turn heat on and it turns into a delicious dish but that's what happened! I couldn't fit two heads of cabbage into my stock pot though I suppose I could have waited till verges reduce and add the second head. Not the fanciest but tasty and easy

I made the recipe as written except I used browned stew meat instead of the ground beef. I think it is an excellent stew but have no idea what makes it Hawaiian. I also did not serve it over rice or pasta but as a stew making it much lower in carbs. As a note be aware that it makes a lot. Next time I'll halve it.
