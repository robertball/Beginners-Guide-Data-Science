This dessert was a total hit at both of my Christmas dinners this past year. In fact, I was asked to bring this every year because it was so delicious. The biggest rave was that it was sweet, but not too sweet.

I made this with premade pudding since it was on hand. I dont know if it made much difference but I got alot of comments that this was too sweet for several of the people that sampled it. That may be a consideration if you dont like very sweet desserts. I absolutely loved it though and even had seconds. Next time ill only use one type of preserves, as i dont think the flavors were different enough when eaten together that both are needed.
