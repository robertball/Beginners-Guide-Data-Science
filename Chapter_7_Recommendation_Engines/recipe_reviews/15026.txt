I read the reviews about blandness and also the one who preseasoned the chicken breasts, so I created my own marinate for this easy recipe... 2 T Italian Dressing, 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp black pepper and 1/2 tsp garlic powder, whisked together, then brushed onto chicken breasts before I poured the 1/4 C of salsa on them.  I used frozen chicken breasts so I cooked the packets on 375 for 1 hour.  It came out DELICIOUS and very tasty!!!  Both the potatoes and chicken were very tender and flavorful!  This recipe is a keeper and GREAT when prep time is at a minimum!!!!!

I made these tonight for supper and found them easy to make. Instead of using a whole breast, I diced the chicken up. I also added some shredded cheese. My husband really likes these and thought it was quite tasty. I, on the other hand, didn't like them as well. Anyone wanting to try these in the future should note that it took me longer than an hour to get the potato pieces soft.

Like others I added exta spices (taco seasoning) cheddar cheese to mine, came out great. Was worried about the potatoes still being too hard but I sliced them really thin and they came out wonderful. This is a keeper at our house!!

If it is bland, try seasoning everything! Seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and red pepper and topped with cheese when it came out of the oven. Absolutely delicious. Recipes are a guideline. Use your own ingenuity and it comes out great!

Thanks! I was looking for something quick to make with a few ingredients and this recipe helped! I used fresh refrigerated salsa from the local grocery store and sprinkled some shredded chedder on top before serving.  It was good!  I think that the brand of salsa you use probably makes a big difference in the overall taste.

I followed some other reviewers' advice and seasoned the chicken before putting it in the packet, and I feel like it made a big difference. I used GwenLea's marinade of Italian dressing, chili powder, garlic powder, and pepper and added a little Mrs. Dash. I would also recommend slicing the potatoes quite thin - some of my thicker slices weren't cooked all the way through, but the thinner ones were perfect. Topped with a little shredded cheese and sour cream, and it was amazing!

Super Star for ease of preparation and cleanup, but it's not an amazing dinner option for flavor. Quite bland. My chicken overcooked while the potatoes were a bit firm. (and I used large chicken breasts!) It's one I might try again maybe spicin' it up a bit or adding shredded cheese!

Very easy clean up but chicken was very bland and potatos were sliced VERY thin due to the other comments and still were not fully cooked. I would recommend cooking these two items seperatly...a little more clean up but a better end result.

After reading other reviews, I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic.  I also tossed the potato slices with oil, salt, pepper, and garlic.  I used extra salsa.  The meal was really quite good- quick and easy, using ingredients I already had on hand.

I made this using my fresh salsa and cooked in covered cast iron pan.  Since chicken breasts by themselves are always bland, I always brine my chicken breasts in water with garlic granuales and salt.  while this is garlic salt, I always do it in the 2 seperate ingreidents.  this solves the problem of the chicken being bland and makes them moist.  I ran 50 minutes at 350 with mexican cheese on top.  I would run at 370 or go 60 minutes and add the cheese when I was done.  I served witha side of guagamole made with my fresh salsa on lettuce for presentation.  This was very easy and very interesting.  I used skinned yukon golds and they were not perfectly done.  That is the reason for the higher temp or longer time and from experience lies with my oven.  I will definiatly do this again.

Okay..now I listened to other reviews & seasoned the chicken w/ some cajun seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, & just a sprinkle of salt & pepper before adding the potatoes...very thinly sliced. A tsp. of margarine on top w/the salsa & baked @375 for an hour. Served w/sour cream.. it was to Die For!!! We all loved it!! Thanks So Much for this idea!!!

So incredibly easy and yummy! This is truly a one dish (or packet!) meal. We enjoyed it very much. For an added health punch, try serving it with gaucamole instead of sour cream. Mmmmm :)

Cook this for 60 minutes instead of 45 and you won't have an issue with undercooked potatoes. I seasoned with krazy salt. It was yummy!

I should have read the reviews before I made this recipe.  The potatoes were not cooked and I sliced them VERY thin also.
I don't think I will make this again. I love allrecipes and will look for another recipe.

This was a great starting point for a quick and tasty dinner. I used Mrs. Dash Southwest chipotle seasoning on chicken tenderloins and sliced baby gold potatoes. I will definitely make this again!

Super easy to make and clean up.  I added some Tex Mex seasoning to the chicken and sprinkled some frozen corn over the salsa to add a little crunch.  These changes made this dish really tasty.  The potatoes were a little under cooked even though they were sliced really thin.  I will make this again!

We used fresher Pico and added black beans.  Then served it with shredded cheese and sour cream.  Pretty good.  We also used Guacamole Salsa in some packets and that was pretty good too.

This was very good. I made a few changes as to what I had on hand. I used chicken tenderloins as that was all I had and I also used green chile salsa and a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash fiesta lime. This was a very filling meal and worked out great paired with oven green beans. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

I like this recipe.  It's pretty simple and my husband likes it.  The flavors go really well together. And clean up is a breeze.
