I had to make a dessert for my Spanish class, and it was very easy and quick to make the last minute. I also received a lot of compliments from the class, thanks! =)

These cute little cookies are absolutely delicious!!!  I used mini chocolate chips instead of the regular sized ones.  My family really enjoyed these.  This recipe is a keeper!

So great!  These cookies look great and were really impressive.  As a college student, I impressed all my friends who never cook anything more than macaroni and cheese.  "You made THOSE from scratch????"  I would, however, reduce the amount of cinnamon, because it was slightly overpowering.  thanks for the awesome recipe!

These cookies are beautiful!! However, I will decrease the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp. the next time I prepare them. It was just a bit too much. I did use the mini choc chips, and it worked out great.

These cookies were wonderful!  We had a mexican dinner party, and I served these with the traditional Mexican wedding cakes so we would have a little chocolate.  The cinnamon in them was nice, and I received a lot of compliments.

Beautiful and delicious little cookies.  I used chopped dark chocolate instead of chocolate chips.  Worked really well.  The smell of these cookies even before baking is incredible!

These cookies are a tasty, delicious way to use chocolate morsels: the kids helped roll them and I did the baking, a family affair!

These were very good, and looked great!  Made them exacally as recipe states.  When cutting the tip of the baggie make sure it's a small cut--I made mine too big, and I had too much chocolate coming out.

I love these!  I have made them for several events and for many people...they all love them!  I was just wondering how you know when to take them out of the oven...I've had a little trouble with that!

I made a batch of these on Monday. Today is Saturday and there are only three left. Not impressive? There are only two of us in this house! I didn't have vanilla the first time, and haven't had confectioners sugar either time, but these cookies still turn out great. If you can't drizzle the melted chips on top, just use a knife and slather the chocolate on-- they're not as pretty but taste just as great!
