Let me say, if I'm going to eat ham, I want to taste ham, not clove or pineapple or brown sugar ... just good ham.  This glaze is awesome.  I did not have any almonds, (don't think it would have added anything anyway), I used raspberry vinegar not red wine (what I had) and omitted the corn syrup (what that was for??). If this is too much "tampering" I'm sorry but this will now go on chickens, pork loin ... many things ... can't wait ... Thank you!!

This Glaze recipie is the most wonderful glaze I have ever tasted.  I first used this recipe on Thanksgiving of 2007.  Easy to prepare, and worth the taste.  It will certainly make your ham the talk of the party.

Pretty good, but I made the mistake of getting an uncooked ham and just putting the glaze on the last 15 minutes. The glaze didn't really add to the ham much at all.

Pretty good.  I would like to have try and keep the crust from getting too crisp but the flavor was good anyway.  Not too sweet which my guests enjoyed.

A great recipe, I used Strawberry instead of cherry and I started glazing about 45 minutes before being done.  I really wanted to infuse the ham with the flavor and it was Awesome!

I've been using this glaze on my Christmas ham for the past 2 year and plan to use again this year.  I made a few changes just because of personal preference.  I omit cloves, slivered almonds and nutmeg. I add pineapple slices and maraschino cherries on the outside of the ham.

GORGEOUS.  The cloves really make it.  And you can't screw this up no matter HOW hard you try.

This was the first time that I had ham and the glaze was a nice touch.  A little rich for my taste but the house smell wonderful.  The smell reminded me of the holidays.

Let me start by saying I CANNOT STAND the traditional mustard-brown sugar glaze, not to mention I am mildly allergic to pineapple. The first time I wanted to make this I couldn't find cherry preserves at the store. But I happened to pick up some cherry-raspberry-rhubarb preserves and decided to give it a shot. I nixed the corn syrup, as we are converting to a paleo type diet. Used apple cider vinegar since that is what we had. Also was out of nutmeg and ground cloves, so used a little ginger (just under 1/4 tsp). A lil extra cinnamon and we were good. It came out AMAZING! Tangy sweet, could definitely taste the cherry, with an aftertaste of cinnamon and spice. Will make this again for sure.

A little to much vinegar for my tastle.  I added a little more preserves to mellow it out.  Fantastic recipe.

Very good and very easy. I cooked it over ham in the crock pot. Then removed the ham and thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch.

Great glaze! The sweet balances the salt in the ham. This glaze is perfect for the holidays. I used maple syrup instead but that is all I changed.
