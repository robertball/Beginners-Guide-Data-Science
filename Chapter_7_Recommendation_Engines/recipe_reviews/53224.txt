I tryed this and decided that I liked my moms better. This is very close to my mom's recipe with a few verations. First my mom does not use chic stock, corn, or olives. She cooks bacon in large cast iron skillet. leaves all grease in it and adds onions, grn peppers, fresh minced garlic, and rice to skillet and cooks for about 7-10 minutes. then she puts in two cans of tomotoes, crushed slightly by hand, and juice also and a little water to just cover rice good. brings to a boil, reduces heat to med-low and put lid on for 10 mins. She adds a bit of water as needed and finishes rice without the lid. The rice is fluffy and moist, having absorbed liquids. You do not want to have this too wet. bacon is broken up and mixed in. My mom serves this with fried chicken,and refried beans with melted cheese. Yummy! But I also serve this with shreded pork/or chicken tacos, anything that is mexican!My moms version came from a friend that grew up in Spain.

This was a very good side dish. I followed the recipe except for one thing: I didn't have green peppers, so I did as another reviewer suggested, I used diced green chiles (I put the entire 4 ounce can in). It was great and we decided to always use this one substitution. I had to add a bit more liquid as the rice cooked...ended up using an entire 14 oz can chicken broth and 15 oz can tomato sauce. Had this with Salsa Chicken, also from this site, and it made a great meal. Thank you for the recipe, DivaDee!! We will be making this quite often!

Very good recipe - if you're wondering if you should use the bacon or not, I would recommend you do. The flavor wasn't overpowering, but it is important to make this dish flavorful and smoky.

Fantastic side dish to the 'Chicken Enchiladas V' on this site.  Rice turned out fluffy, not soggy, and had great flavor and color.  I substituted 1/2 can of diced green chiles for the bell pepper because I didn't have a pepper and skipped the olives and corn.  Also chopped the bacon prior to frying to ease preparation. It tasted wonderful!  Will definitely keep this recipe around for years!

This rice was wonderful!!  I didn't change anything I was real impressed how it turned out.  And don't forget, once you put the lid on your rice- don't mess with it until the time is up.

this is a terrific recipe! i used 4 thick slices of slab bacon (draining off about half the grease), jasmine rice, 4 roma tomatoes, 1 large onion & 1 large bell pepper. the kernel corn works very well here & adds bright color to this dish. i love black olives but omitted them in effort not to distract from the other flavors. we served this rice with salsa chicken (also from this website). thanks diva dee!

Wow!  What a delicious dish!  I didn't change anything about the recipe.  It passed the "kid test" but not by a majority (1 of 3 enjoyed it and got 2nds)  The next time I make it, I'll use less of the bacon grease.  Also, to me, it seemed a slightly bit too acidic.  Though that may have been due to the tomatoes (we used produce from our garden)

This was pretty good.  Nice flavor though a little salty.  Definitely don't need to ADD salt to this one...I added some diced chicken to make it a one pot meal.  I liked it with shredded cheese and sour cream on top.  Mmmm...  Oh-- and I used brown rice so it took FOREVER to get done but it came out fine.

The flavors for this recipe are great (tomato, rotel, chicken broth) and remind me of the tex-mex style spanish rice that I have always loved. I did not like the added vegetables (corn, bell peppers, olives) and will leave those out next time.

This is the best Spanish rice I have ever ate, and I don't like the rice you get in Mexican resturants. This will certainly stay in my Recipe box.

I had too many dishes w tomato for this meal so I omitted tomato sauce/tomatos. Ditched the green peppers too as fam doesn't like.  BUT, did the rest and used two cups chix broth.  Fam loved it... the bacon and olives were "sneaky" flavors they really enjoyed. Most def do again.

This is a keeper! I omitted the olives and cut back on the bell pepper. I did need to increase cooking time and add cooking liquid. Next time I will use a slightly smaller skillet, which I think will take care of that problem. All in all, my hubby loved it, so I will definitely be making this again.

Very yummy. I used a can of southwest style chopped tomatoes instead of the plain chopped tomatoes. I also left out the bell peppers and olives because of personal preference. I also added some cumin. I'll probably add some garlic and possibly some diced potatoes next time I make this. Great recipe - thanks!

I love spanish rice. I was curious how bacon would taste in this dish which is why I decided to try this.   I used one green bell pepper, half of an onion, 4 strips of bacon and 1 roma tomato with all other ingredients. I used only a dash of chili powder. I did not need to add much more salt to the rice since there was salt from the bacon. The cooking time was approximate. Very tasty, nothing overpowering, the flavors were balanced. I could tell there were bacon pieces in the rice and I could see the bacon bits but my family said they would have never known it was there if I did not tell them. I was asked to put "a lot" more bacon next time. I think you can certainly play with this dish by adding peas, or omitting bell peppers, etc. This dish can be served with any mexican dish. Tonight I served this with, "Salsa Chicken," also from this site, and they complemented each other very well.

First class.  Hubby is not a rice fan but loved this one.  Had to delete the bell peppers as I cannot eat, but subbed seeded jalapeno's instead.  Excellent!  May try next time with Ancho chili powder for a bit more smokieness...but will be hard to improve on.  Kudos!

Best Spanish Rice dish I have made. I was heavy-handed with the chili powder and I did have to add more chicken broth toward the end of cooking (I believe that has more to do with my pot than the fault of the recipe). I had two Roma tomatoes, but they weren't that good being out of season. Next time I'll just use canned, diced tomatoes. I like things hot and spicy, but it's good a side dish like this is more neutral to show off the main element. If I was making this as a main dish I would add hot peppers and/or hot sauce.  My new favorite Spanish Rice recipe!

This rice is good but needs alot more liquid than stated. I followed the recipe and it was very dry before it was done. I added more broth near the end which made it kind of mushy. If i make this again. i will add alot more liquid at the start.

YUM! I had to scale the recipe back but it turned out super yummy. I omitted the tomatoes as I thought the tomato sauce would be enough, and I forgot to add the corn, but it was still good. I used red bell pepper, not green as green tends to upset my stomach. I added garlic powder, and instead of cooking the veggies in the bacon fat, I used olive oil. Add the veggies and bacon to the rice and let cook for a while longer. My guest loved it and I thought the flavour was great. Thank you, this is a keeper!

This recipe was GREAT.  I made it exactly as the recipe said, adding nothing nor deducting anything.  It was VERY flavorful.  I made this with tacos, and it turned out to be a great meal.  Next time I'm going to use this recipe to make rice and bean burritos. I think this recipe can be used for anything, i.e. Main dish, side dish, burrito filling, etc.

This is great. Make sure to use quality chicken stock (not broth). My son, who only eats plain white rice, declared this his favorite. I served it with my homemade enchiladas and our guest just raved!!

This recipe is really good!  I am not a huge fan of rice, but I love this recipe.  I always make it to go with enchiladas.  Maybe the bacon helps.  =)  I do have problems with the liquid cooking out, which is why I did 4 stars.  After making this a few times, here are the revisions I make:  I use petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, especially if they are out of season, and this adds a bit more liquid to the rice.  I also use a full can of broth, instead of 1 cup.  When I make these changes, I do not have to worry about the rice cooking dry before it is finished.  Before, the rice would be just under done, even after adding more liquid it would take a long time to cook.  Now, I can leave it, and know that it will be done just right, and not be dry.    I do not do the green peppers or olives, but the corn I find adds a good texture.

I quadrupled this recipe for a Cinco de Mayo dinner last night, and unfortunately I didn't have any left over to bring home.  However, for best results, I don't think I would go higher than doubling this the next time, even if I had to make two double batches.  The rice didn't cook as well, and as you can imagine with that much rice, took forever to simmer.

Having said that, this was truly wonderful.  I added the sliced black olives and used frozen corn.  The only change I made was for personal taste, and added some garlic and a small amount of crushed red peppers....then I threw away my old Spanish rice recipe.

This was amazing!  I didn't have fresh tomatoes on hand so I drained a can of chopped tomatoes and added that instead.  I also didn't have any chicken broth in the pantry so I braised some chicken breasts and set them aside and used the liquid in place of the broth.  The rest of the recipe I followed to the "T" only I chopped up the chicken breasts and tossed those in at the end when I added the corn and olives in.  This is an authentic Spanish Rice recipe and I'm sure it's also perfect as written.  Thank you so much, Deed!!

I would suggest 1/2 cup tomato sauce and 1 1/2 cups chicken broth. It does take longer than plain rice to cook.  I used bell peppers, onion and shredded carrots as a saute base.  Didn't want corn or black olives in mine.   Kept is simple.  Very good.

This dish was great. Did not need to tweak too much. Just used 1 onion and 1 green pepper instead of two. Will definitely make this again!

We all really liked this though cook it in a non stick pan. It had a burned taste to it in the cast iron. We used green chillies instead of the green peppers. Omitted the olives and corn and added cheddar cheese. Thank you. Great recipe!

This has great flavor.  I used a cup of diced tomatoes and juice instead of tomato sauce.  I left off the bell pepper and corn. (only b/c this was a last minute throw together and I did not have it on hand).  Tasted wonderful.  I had to add a little more chicken broth.  I think this is b/c of the pot I used.  Wonderful taste!  I will make again for sure!!

I have had better, but this is a tasty dish.  I didn't add the green peppers, but I followed the rest of the recipe to the T...and it was good.  I did add 3/4 cup of water towards the end and ended up with mushy rice.  I will try this one again and see if I can get it more fluffy next time...any suggestions besides omitting the extra water?

Best I have ever made!  I even used instant rice and it still turned out great!  Just the right amount of kick and the texture is fabulous and everything is better with bacon, right? The second time I made it, I added 1 lb. of cooked ground beef and came up with an easy one-pan main dish meal.   Serve it with corn cakes or warm tortillas.  NOM!

Skipped the bacon, using EVOO to sweat the onions, and replaced one of the green peppers with a red one.  Good stuff.

This is really filling! I used chilli sauce instead of tomato sauce, and chicken bullion and water instead of chicken stock. Used more liquid than was stated. Also added some paprika to the dish. Melted some cheddar on top and topped it with sour cream. Left out the olives, but the corn went really well with rice. Tastes even better the next day.

Excellent! I added an extra 1/2 cup of rice and 1 cup of broth to feed a few extra people. (Also, I only used 3/4 of one onion, 1/2 of a green pepper and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies and it turned out wonderful) Everyone raved!

My husband thought this was good.  I didn't exactly follow the recipe.  Instead of 2 diced  tomatos, I used a can of diced tomatos.  Instead of tomato sauce, I used paste.  I also left out the corn. For me, it tasted too "tomato-ee".  Needed lots of salt. Next time---more broth, less tomato sauce!

A great homemade spanish rice. Since my honey doesn't like pepper or diced tomatoes, I couldn't add either. It still came out great. I can't wait to make again when he isn't here, so I can add everything else.

Very tasty! I will be making this again. The only two changes I made to this was adding in some Italian sausage as I wanted some meat with my rice hehe and added a little bit more chili powder than it called for. This made a huge meal. Plenty of left overs for a household of 2 people!

The rice was pretty good, but still not as good as at a restaurant.  All you really taste is the bacon and tomato.  I like it, but I will continue to look for the perfect spanish rice recipe.

Wonderful!! I was so worried about all of the ingredients and wondering how it was really going to be a rice dish,, but it worked perfectly!  I didn't have Chili so I used a Lime Fiesta spice instead.  Whoops. I just realized, I didn't add the black olives or corn.

We made this recipe quiet often by now. It is not hard to fix at all. We do not use the exact amounts of peppers and tomatoes though but the flavor is still amazing.

This was the BIZNESS!!! Admittedly I didn't follow to the T, but close enough. Rather than tom sauce and fresh tomatoe, I used 1 can of cut up whole tomates along w/the juice from that can. I also ended up using all the juice from the other can. I would've used 2 cans of tom, but idk if my kids would have liked all those tom. I was cooking chicken for chicken tacos so just added some of that to the tom juice for the liquid. Again, due to my kids, I only used 1 onion and 1 green pepper. I can't imagine 2 onions, 1 of both was sufficient. I also didn't use corn or olives. Served this with refried beans and chicken tacos. DELICIOUS! Next time, however, I wouldn't use all the bacon grease, I would half it. Will make this again and again.

I made this yesterday to go with cheese enchiladas I prepared for my birthday luncheon. I doubled the recipe as suggested, and made only minor changes. As I didn't want it to be too tomato-ey, I changed the ratio of broth and tomato sauce to 3:1, in accordance with some previous reviews. I also omitted the fresh tomatoes. I used 2 green & 2 red bell peppers, plus one hot light green pepper (instead of the chili powder). I included the corn but not the olives (the enchiladas had some and I didn't want to overdo it). The result was excellent. I made it fairly early in the morning, and reheated it for 3 min. in the microwave just before serving. Oh, and as I had forgotten to add the bacon, I sprinkled it on the top, which gave a nice appearance. Although this recipe was a bit more work than some of the Spanish rice recipes on AR, I think the extra work was well worth it, and will certainly make it again!

This was very delicious. I doubled the recipe. I didn't add the bacon.  We're Jews, we don't eat bacon.  I used brown rice instead of white and didn't change anything and it turned out very well, maybe cooked a little bit longer than called for.

I guess I have to give it a star rating to post this comment, so I give it a four because it tasted good.  I am pretty new to cooking so I think I messed up.  I scaled the recipe down to 3 servings and when I mixed everything together just prior to simmering, the mix seemed a little dry so I added some water - maybe not a good idea?  I simmered for the recommended time but just as I suspected, the rice was not fully cooked.  Any suggestions?  I don't even know if it's possible to reply to this post?

This was okay but no one in my family was crazy about it.  I didn't care for the bacon.  I imagined it being more like something my mom used to make.  I will try it again leaving out the bacon but adding in ground beef.  I think this will be closer to the recipe I'm looking for.

This was really good and I am not a spanish rice person. I made it to go with chicken enchiladas. I didn't use the bacon or black olives, but next time will definitely add the olives. Yum - my 3 year old liked it too and she would have liked it more with the olives!

This is my go-to spanish rice recipe.  It is perfect as written.  I do not add the optional corn or olives - doesn't need it!  Excellent leftover/reheated too.

best spanish rice i've ever made!  Loved the bacon element.  I made a couple changes to suit my tastes.  I only used 2 slices of bacon and drained most of the grease off for health reasons.  It still had a really good smokey flavor that made the dish.  The bacon makes the dish!I also added 1 can chopped green chilis instead of green bell peppers.  I did not use the optional ingredients.  Will be my go to recipe for spanish rice.

This was pretty awesome.  It was my first attempt at a real rice dish and I was extremely pleased that the rice came out as tender as I'd expect from a restaurant.  The bacon flavor was a bit much.  I think next time I will use a bit more tomato and a bit less bacon.  Don't get me wrong though, the flavor was excellent, if not quite what I would have expected from a spanish rice dish.

I have made this several times now and it is always a big hit. One extra thing I like to add is a dash of ancho chili powder to give it a little more of a kick.

This is such a great recipe! I have made this a couple of times  and continue to make it. I pair it up with Taqueria Style Tacos-Carne Asada on this site. I made it just as the recipe calls except for adding corn. I am thinking about taking other reviewers suggestion and add a can of green chilies.

I used brown rice and added vegetable protein to make  a complete meal. I too found it a bit too salty, but otherwise a tasty dish

I made a few changes to this recipe since my intent was to use it to stuff bell peppers with.  I browned the onions and bacon together then added the corn and tomato so the flavors mingled a bit.  I then used chili powder, cumin, salt, and pepper as my seasonings before adding in the chicken stock and rice.  Once the rice was done I stuffed it into the bell peppers, topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked it for 30 min at 375 to cook the bell pepper.  My husband enjoyed it immensely.

I also followed suthernswttatergal's suggestions. It doesn't take 40 minutes for this to cook. I did use the broth and I didn't have any bell peppers so I used 2 cans of Rotel and chile seasoning for my spice. Everybody loved this dish!!

Really tasty!  I did follow some viewers advice, and added a can of green chiles instead of the bell peppers, but that's just preference out here in El Paso.  No bacon either.  Otherwise, followed quite closely and it was yummy.

LOVED IT!  loved the bacon in it, which you didn't notice much except that it was so good.  I doubled the recipe but it still wasn't enough liquid.  Good thing I checked before it burnt to the bottom of the pan but even that was just more tasty bits!  thanks!

Had a good flavor, but I would just leave out the green peppers because it seemed to over power it.  I added a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato juice, but I will probably do both next time.

I thought this was fantastic!  I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I made do with what I had.  I didn't have, so I left out, the bacon.  And I only had red and orange peppers instead of green.  I will make this again.  Plus without the bacon, you have a lot fewer calories and fat!

This was very good! However, I changed it a bit to suit my taste. I doubled the recipe, but only used 6 slices of bacon I chopped the bacon up first, then cooked it, used (1)  28 oz. big can of diced tomatoes with its juice, add 3 gloves of finely chopped fresh garlic, a teaspoon of cumin, and bit more chili powder, and then followed, the reviewer; suthernswttatergal suggestion on her how her mother makes the dish. I still give credit to the orginal submiter of this recipe without DEED330, suthernswttatergal would have never been able to leave a review nor I. So, think you, DEED330 and suthernswttatergal for the recipe! It was awesome, I made it today with Jerk Chicken.

This is very good. We used jasmine rice and the flavor was wonderful. I think I would use more rice or less pepper/tomato next time because I like to taste more rice in each bite. Great recipe!

Very good, reminded me of what my grandmother used to make.  I made it to the recipe the first time without the corn, didn't think the olives did it any favors so left them out the second time and added 1 1/2 pounds of cooked hamburger to it and made it a main a dish, we really like it, ty for the recipe.

Very good. My only issue was that during my 30 min cook time, the rice mixture burnt on the bottom. Next time I will stir occasionally or add a little more chicken broth.

This was a really good recipe. I used one yellow and one red bell pepper instead of the green pepper. I also had to add another 1/2 cup of chicken broth after 30 minutes of cooking the rice to finish cooking the rice. I used 1, 15 oz can od diced tomatoes that I drained because I didn't have any fresh tomatoes in the house. My almost 2 year old daughter loved it as well. Next time I might cook  up some chicken breast and add it for a complete meal.

I sauteed the vegetables in bacon grease, I didn't use bacon because I planned using kielbasa in the rice. I also added a tbsp. of fresh lime juice. Other than that, I made no other changes. This turned out okay. Same as the boxed stuff, pretty much. I served it with Mexican Salad and Honey Cornbread, also from this site. I garnished it with shredded cheese and sour cream. Just as easy as making the boxed stuff. I think it would have been  better with more heat behind it. My kids and I didn't like this at all but my husband ate two large servings. I might make this again but I'd add more heat.

i read the reviews, hence made some changes, so my spanish rice turned out great! i subbed out v-8 juice instead of tomato sauce to avoid the too-tomatoey taste and used 4 slices of bacon to avoid overpowering it as some reviewers mentioned.  i also used blanched poblano peppers instead of bell peppers to give it more kick and added some fresh cilantro and cumin which added to the flavor as well. this was a 5 with the modifactions so i am only rating this as written a 4. thanks everyone!

This was the best spanish rice I have ever had.  I have been on a quest for a good Sp. rice recipe and finally found it.
Discovered I didn't have any tomato sauce so I added 1/2 can of tomato paste to the chicken broth and increased the broth slightly to compensate.  I seldom look forward to leftovers but this time I certainly did.  WONDERFUL!!!

Love the recipe!  I didn't use the bacon, used a bit more chili powder, and added two heaping tablespoons full of chunky salsa for some more zip.  Tasty and colorful dish!

This was my first time making Spanish rice.  I don't usually like it myself, but was making it for a party.  Made it a day ahead of time & had to make a second recipe because we ate it all before the party!  

Used one large onion & green pepper & 1/3 large tomato & that was plenty for the amount of rice.  Was scared about the bacon, but it gives a wonderful flavor.  This will be a staple in my recipes!

I am sorry that I haven't posted a review of this recipe considering how many times I have made it. My family said to me tonight "this is the rice I mean for you to make when I say make that good rice". This rice recipe takes a little bit of effort, but the result is really worth it. It was my daughters 25th birthday today. She requested Southwestern Egg Rolls & Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce, one of her favourites. I made this rice as one side dish. Her first words were "mmm this is good rice. A couple of compliments like these make a 5 star rating in my house.

I always double this recipe and DO NOT add more salt.  There is enough salt from the bacon and the chicken stock.  I was also tempted to add more liquid the first time I made it, but it comes out perfect.  One of our favorite recipes.

This was a good, easy recipe for a hearty, but somewhat healthy meal, though I found the overall taste somewhat wanting.  I did not use the bacon, so instead I fried some boneless chicken breasts and used the pandrippings from that to saute my veg in.  I also added more Chili powder as well as garlic powder and cayenne for the extra bite.  I must say that what made this dish was the texture with the optional black olives and corn.  Without these, it may have just been a three star dish.  Next time I may go with green olives and less tomato sauce.  But overall, not bad; it's definitely a recipe that can be built upon!

This was really tasty.  I used smoked bacon, which made a big difference (one time I did regular bacon - not so good).  Also omitted olives and corn, and used a head of broccoli instead of peppers which my husband doesn't like.  Done it several times now, and will continue!

was overall a good recipe. we didnt have all of the supplies at our house and didnt feel like going to the store so we didnt use the onions or green bell peppers or uncooked rice (used instant rice and did the same only after pouring the tomato and chicken broth in only cooked the 10 mins as the rice would usually do instead of covering and simmering for 30-40mins). Still had a good taste, will definetly make it again.

Very good rice.  Of course just like everyone else, made it my own.  Doubled it and used only 6 slices bacon.  Only one onion. Used a can of rotel instead of the tomatoes and green peppers. Added two chipotles in adobo or a seeded chopped Jalapeno. No salt no pepper, plenty spicy.  Turned out great. Can also use your favorite salsa for the peppers and tomatoes. I also put it all in a greased baking dish and cover with cheese and bake for 10 minutes until the cheese melts. Soooo good!!!

I have been looking for a good Spanish rice recipe and my search is over.  Love the flavor of the bacon.  This rice goes great with Kiki's Borracho (Drunken) Beans (recipe on this site).

I've made this twice and I just love it.  There's plenty of flavor and color, but was very easy to tone down for a spice-sensitive stomach.  It's a hit at my house.

The only change I made was to not include the black olives. I just didn't have them. This is an excellent recipe and I'll try it with the olives on the side, optional.

Used what I had on hand and love recipes that are flexible---this one is!  Used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes along with the the cup of broth and added some liquid smoke, cumin and black beans.  Sprinkled with grated cheese to serve.   I will make this again and vary the vegetables; may try some chopped spinach next time!

Excellent recipe! I doubled the bacon since it was our main dish. I only used 1 onion and 1 green pepper - and that was plenty. (Don't use minute rice - it'll be mushy if you do..) Otherwise, followed the recipe.

Yummy side dish. Served it with chicken enchiladas and refried beans. I liked the mixture of flavors - a nice balance as no particular flavor overpowered. As other reviewers suggested, I doubled the chicken broth and omitted the salt. I might add a bit more chili powder next time.  I don't think you can go wrong making the recipe as written - just personal preference.

It was a very good base. Excellent to add on any preference.  It was sort of plan for us even with the spices so I added salsa to give it a good kick. Very good!

I used some of this recipe along with what I was already doing, and it turned out fantastic. I skipped the bacon and instead sautéed the onion with butter. I used a can of mild rotel instead of diced tomatoes. I also threw in some green chiles. My husband asked me to keep making my own like that instead of using a premixed box..

This was a great recipe. Made exactly by the recipe except I added 2 chopped jalapeño for some kick. Doubled it for a larger group. One 14 oz can sliced olives and only 1 can of corn. Turned out amazing. Used the leftovers in burritos the next day. Will definitley make it again.

Made this as a main course by swapping out the bacon for ground sausage; used onion and a can of diced tomatoes in place of tomato sauce. Used smoked paprika for flavor and both black and green olives as only had five black olives left in jar. Plan to serve with a spinach salad and top the Spanish rive with shredded cheese.

This is a fantastic recipe, I love this!  I have been looking for something like this.  I don't eat pork so I substituted it with smoked beef sausage and added olive oil for the bacon grease.  Never tasted anything like this before.  Thank you very much.  I sent this to a few of my family members to try out. I know they will love it too.

Very good recipe. Basically, I made it as directed except I left out the olives and wasn't sure about the corn so I put it on the side to see if we liked it. The only other thing I did was brown up a pound of ground beef and added that to make it more of a main dish. Thank you!

I made this but made a few changes and it was INCREDIBLE! Okay instead of diced tomatoes and bell peppers I added a can of rotel and a 4 oz can of diced green Chilis. I only did one onion and added some garlic salt to the mix. I personally needed to add a LOT more chicken stock as it kept simmering out and it needed more moisture to cook the rice. Keep an eye on it, keep it moist. This could be a main dish if you threw some chicken into it, we absolutely loved it. I also served the olives on the side and let people add it if they wanted it...

Not bad.  Just not what I was looking for.  Too much of a thick tomato flavor.

I made this twice and both times it was a success. Instead of bacon I used 1/2 lb ground beef and only 1 onion, 1 green bell pepper, 1 tomato. No corn. The black olives were a new addition for me so I tried it and it's very good.  Plan on using this recipe again and again.

I've never made "Spanish" rice with bacon, bell peppers, chili powder, or olives.  I've only used corn to stretch out my rice, but even then I do that rarely. Too greasy and to many ingredients.

I needed a base for Spanish rice to make my sister's special galumpkies or others call cabbage rolls. I followed recipe except no corn or olives. I added ground beef. I didn't have green peppers so I used rotel. Wrapped in cabbage leaves, sauce on top, covered and baked. Family loved it.I will be using again and I will make it as written with no changes.

Thumbs up from my daughter! I did not have tomatoes and peppers (and only one onion), so I subbed in some salsa that I had drained the juicier parts from. Did not have bacon either so I just used olive oil to saute onion and brown rice in. Turned out very good I thought, even with these modifications. I rarely give a recipe five stars. Was a great side for our tacos, thanks for the recipe!

Very good. I did make some changes:
used 2 14 ox cans of fire roasted tomatoes instead of 2 tomatoes.  
1.5 cups of rice.. didn't want to leave a 1/2 cup rice in the package.
omitted the olives and corn ( didn't have them, optional anyway)

This was a big hit.  the rich  flavor is what makes this rice good.  It is not so much a prominent bacon flavor, but a round savory flavor. do not omit.
This will be going into the rotation.  It made quite a lot, but  the 2 year old loved it as well as the hubby so WINNING!

Next time I will add the olives but I am not sure ab0out the corn...

I followed the recipe even though 30-40 minutes for white rice that normally cooks in 15 minutes sounded like it would make the rice soft and gooey.  Well it does! There also doesn't need to be more than 2 total cups of liquid.   If you've heated your liquids, and sauteed the veggies, then it's warm when you put it together, so for heaven's sake check it when it's been on the stove 15 minutes.  I also had to double the chili powder because it was so flavorless from the overcooking and too much liquid.  I used it in a fritatta this morning and the egg and cheese made it edible.

Easy to make and was very tasty.  I did omit the corn because I dont like the flavor of corn over powering the rest of the ingredients, but thats my personal flavor.

Very yummy rice. I will make it again, I want to try roasted tomatoes in the mix and see what that will do for this already delicious side.

This was ok.  It tasted more like pasta in a tomato sauce...not at all like the spanish rice I was expecting.  I will keep looking.  Thanks for sharing!

Added 1 large can whole tomatoes broken up w/ juice & 1/2 cup ckn broth. 1 tsp chili powder, S&P. added bacon. Cooked uncovered till rice cooked. topped with mexican, taco or cheddar cheese and sour cream.

This is delicious! It went great with the steak fajitas I made with it. I used a whole 15 oz can of chicken broth and only one green pepper and one large vidalia onion, and it was perfect! Be careful that your rice doesn't burn when you are simmering it. I had to keep stirring it so the bottom layer of rice wouldn't burn.

Loved it!  It's like the spanish rice that my Mom would make when I was growing up.  I did have to add an extra cup of chicken broth.  I made this with chicken enchiladas and it was a wonderful pairing, but it can go with so many dishes!  Absolutely wonderful!

OMG...........This is the best Spanish rice I have ever eaten.  I am not overly fond of Spanish rice but I had to make some for work so I tried this recipe.  It is fantastic and fun to make.  One little hint that probably goes without saying, cut up all your veggies first before starting.  I also cut the bacon into small pieces before frying.

This is the best recipe I've found for this traditional Mexican rice.  We have a home in Mexico and this tastes like the real deal.  I kept to the recipe exactly but just left out the corn.  Very, very good!!!

This is a good recipe if you want something basic, but it needs some jazzing up. I omitted half the onions (they were pretty big), green bell pepper, corn, and olives out of personal preference. Added one diced and seeded jalapeno pepper (could have gone for two), 3-4 T chili powder, and about 1 t powdered garlic. To make it a complete meal, I browned 1 lb ground beef with the onions, rice, and jalapeno pepper. I agree with other reviewers that the rice could use a little more liquid, as the rice was a bit on the firm side. 3 starts without changes, 4 stars after making some adjustments. Thanks for the recipe!

This was soo good. I made a few changes but mainly stayed with the original recipe. I put only one tomato in and 1/2 bell pepper. (I am not partial to bell pepper.) I had to use almost 30 oz. of chicken broth. The rice absorb like crazy. I also put more tomato sauce than what it called for. And I hate to chopped onions, sensitive eyes and all. So i just added 2 tbsps of minced dried onion. This was amazing, will definaeky make again.

Delicious, I didnt use bacon but did use bacon fat for the oil, I left out the corn and olives and didnt have the green pepper but next time I will add some green pepper for sure. A little spicy which I loved, it was gone really quick :) great recipe and easy too. I did have to add in extra chicken broth as the rice was sticking to the bottom of the pan and it wasnt done yet but it turned out great. I will make it again and again

Great recipe. I made a few changes due to a recent health kick: Skipped the bacon; put a little liquid smoke in w/ the olive oil I used to saute the onion. (worked well, think it added the smokey flavor that a recent rater said it needed). Used El Pato Jalapeno sauce instead of tomato for extra spice (Muey Bueno!). Used veg stock instead of chicken for less sodium and ommitted salt all together. Used 1 bell pep and 3 whole chiles. The big one was the QUINOA sub for the rice. Was a bit worried but turned out great. I have substituted quinoa in all my rice recipes and it is yet to let me down. Just monitor the moisture content as it simmers... Overall this was a very easy and versatile recipe with a good pay off

This was very good. I didn't use olives (don't like them) or the corn, but everyone really liked it. I also chop the green pepper up really finely in my food processor so kids don't know it's in there.

This dish is FABULOUS!!!! My only adjustment was I used red bell pepper instead of green because I don't like green. I also leave out the olives. Other than that the recipe is great just the way it is.  To make it a complete meal I add in some hot sausage that I cook up in another pan and add it in at the end. I have made this rice several times and my husband and family just love it.

This was my first time making "authentic" Spanish rice- it's usually out of the box. I made a vegetarian version- I used vegetable stock and omitted the bacon. It turned out very nice, but needed some salt and I threw in some hot sauce to spice it up a bit. Also, because I didn't have bell pepper, I added peas. Turned out good.

Let's see, this one was a fun recipe.  I used brown rice instead of white due to dietary restrictions. I also omitted the olives, too salty, used a cup of frozen corn instead of the canned (also less sodium)and used 1/2 t Cumin for a bit of smoky flavor.  I think my guests are still licking out the pot I cooked it in!!

YUM.  Used only 1 onion and one green pepper.  You will need more than one cup of stock. The bacon is very important here - unless you can find liquid smoke (for the vegans).  Also, you may want to add some spice if you like it hot.  Maybe cayenne in addition to the chili powder.  It had great flavor, but no heat - if that's what you are into.

I am not a big fan of rice but this was spectacular. Not too spicy yet very flavorful. I used Jasmine rice instead of white rice and it turned out fantastic. I didn't cut down the prtions tho and for 2 it was way too much. Will need to do tht next time I make this dish.

Made this last night.  It was the best spanish rice I've ever made.  I didn't even use tomatoes or green bell peppers.  I only had tomatoes & green chili's in a can and it still tasted great.  This is my new spanish rice recipe.  Very versatile. It can be changed to your own specifications.  But DO use chicken broth and bacon.  It makes the flavor in this dish authentic tasting.

Very good.  Used packaged Hormel Real Crumbled Bacon to cut down on fat and cholesterol, a must for us. Did not use corn or olives; personal preference. My fiance talked about the Spanish rice his mom used to make and we had some green peppers to use.  We like this recipe and will use again.

This was good, but missing something, I added garlic but for our tastes probably need to add more chili powder or maybe even hot peppers instead of green peppers.

REALLY, REALLY good! I changed it a tad, sorry, to make Beefy Spanish Rice. Used beef broth, 5 pieces of bacon instead of 6 because I could only fit 5 in my skillet, onions were chopped instead of diced because I was lazy, no tomatoes (we don't like them), no olives, & a 15 oz can of corn instead of 10 oz (I've never even seen a 10 oz can of corn). I added 1 lb of cooked ground beef after the rice was added. This made a lot! 6-8 servings. Make sure you add the bacon, it gives the dish a nice smoky flavor. My husband LOVED it. I will be adding this to our rotation. BTW, this recipe didn't NEED changes, the changes I made were all personal preferences. Thanks!

I made this last night and it was awesome.  I'm from San Antonio and have had great Spanish rice--and this is one of the best! The bacon grease really makes it, and I like how the recipe calls for chicken stock instead of water.  That adds a lot of flavor. My rice cooked in 20 minutes so keep an eye on it!

This recipe was delicious!  I made this for my husband's birthday and he loved it.  He is a huge bacon fan and the bacon made this dish.  We could taste it in every bite.  I will definitely make this again.

This was okay for me.  It was my first taste of Spanish rice, so I don't have much to compare it to.  I followed the recipe exactly, just used brown rice instead of white.  Oh, and I skipped optional ingredients. I liked it well enough but I'm not itching to have it again.

super great recipe, even with lots of things left out...  my hubby won't eat things with chunks in them, so that meant no onions, peppers, tomatoes, olives, or corn, but it was still GREAT.  I also skipped the bacon.  I did have to add 3 cups of water to get the rice to cook (tomatoes might have solved that problem), but it tasted wonderful.  Thanks so much!

Really good! I was short a tomato so I doubled the tomato sauce. I used frozen corn (dumped in before the final simmer) and it worked well. Takes a while but very yummy.

It's amazing how great this turned out by making a few mistakes!  I used beef boullion in hot water due to a lack of chicken broth.  Substitued shallots for onions, red peppers for green, and accidently added one whole teaspoon of chili powder.  Skipped the cumin and added the corn.

I couldn's stop eating this!

This recipe turned out really well.  I'm a college student, so I use what I have, and in this case that turned out to be 4 slices of turkey bacon, one large onion, squished canned tomatoes instead of sauce, and "seasoning with sazon" instead of chili powder, but it turned out great!  Also, I added diced chicken and used a yellow bell pepper for color and omitted the corn.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks!

We loved it!!  I didnt have the tomato sauce but used 2 cups of water and a can of tomato paste.  (double recipe)  It was great! Lots of flavor!  You could also add a little mexican cheese to the top.  My son loved that.

This was pretty good. I ommittted the olives. I think they overtake the flavor of the rice.

This is a wonderful recipe! My husband is allergic to green peppers so I omitted those, and it was still wonderful. The perfect side dish to any Mexican feast!

Pretty good, but not what I expected for a Spanish Rice recipe.  The bacon taste is on the over-powering side. Maybe if I left the bacon out or used less I would like it better, but I will probably not try the recipe again.

This is the best Spanish rice that I have ever tasted!  My kids even loved it!  They don't care for green peppers, but I just cut them in big enough pieces for them to easily be picked out.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!  This one's a keeper!
