This was a tasty recipe.  I made the mistake of buying the thick bacon though, so it took too long to get crispy.  I think it would taste better with thinner bacon.  I did cook the mushrooms first; however, I ended up throwing them in the pan with the red pepper and onions to heat them back up again at the end. So I would suggest cooking them with the lamb when it's almost done.  It would save a bit of time.

This was fantastic! The only change I made was adding a large onion (sliced) - I sauteed it along with the mushrooms.

The only change I made to the recipe was instead of seasoned salt, I used the Emeril "original essence" stuff (which was all my BF's roommates had in the house), and it was actually REALLY good. I think it gave it that little spice that Caroline seemed to think was missing. All in all, great recipe. I don't make lamb all that often and it was nice to find this, especially since it's so simple.

This was a good combination of flavors but I felt it was missing something, not sure what though. Served it with steamed asparagus, and buttered baby potatoes. Thanks!

Very nice recipe.  I had to substitute pork chops for the lamb as unfortunately, my husband won't touch lamb.  Turned out well.

This was super yummy! I sautéed onions with the mushrooms and added lemon juice and a handful of chopped italian parsley at the end of sautéing. Since it's cold outside, I broiled the blade steaks in my oven, about 6 min per side. Turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!
