To a previous reviewer - When you read the recipe and nutritionional information, you must have realized that it was going to be very salty!  [AllRecipes estimation - Amount Per Serving - Calories: 275; Total Fat: 14.1g; Cholesterol: 0mg; Sodium: 1116mg; Total Carbs: 32.4g; Dietary Fiber: 1.4g; Protein: 3.8g]  My only suggestion is to use only half the package of ranch dressing mix.

These are delicious and sooo easy!  I used twice the amount of oyster crackers (1 whole box) and substituted cajun seasoning mix for the lemon pepper.  This cut the saltiness and added a little spicy kick.  Yum!

I remember my aunt used to make these for our family vacations to appease us kids and I haven't had these since. I made these today and not kidding...they're already gone!! Didn't last the hour (good thing I bought extra ingrediants to make another batch). I added all spices, including the optional ones, and everyone loved these.  My roommate wants me to make some just so he can use them for his lunches at work. Thanks Jackie!!

This recipe is very good.  I did make a few changes to how I prep this though because my family likes them especially zippy. I upped the oil to 1/3 cup,  and raised the dill and lemon pepper to 1 tsp.  Makes some seriously zippy crackers!

I LOVE this recipe! Always a huge hit wherever I take it! For me, the crackers baked too quickly so I shortened the baking time to 5-6 minutes then stirred, and baked 5 -6 minutes more. Turned out great! Will definitely make again and again.

These were great! I made these for the kids today and they loved them! I used the "dry ranch style seasoning for dip or dressing" from here instead of the packet of ranch. Turned out great!

Very nice, standard recipe. I like the garlic powder but not the lemon pepper. Store these in an airtight container. Thank you.

Followed directions to a T, and baked at 280* for 10 minutes per someone's recommendation.  Actually, I preheated oven, put the crackers in, then shut it off. They were gone by the next day!!

We didn't really care for these. They were awfully salty and I think the ranch powder has a weird after taste. Thanks for posting though it's clear lots of others enjoy it.

These crackers were super easy to make and they taste so good! I gave 4 out of 5 stars because I did tweak the recipe a little. I used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/4 tsp of dill weed. I mixed them by shaking them in a covered bowl, and the coating was perfectly even! Thanks so much for sharing this fun and simple recipe!

I used lower sodium crackers and the store brand of the ranch-dressing (as the packet showed it had lower sodium content than the name-brand).  Using all of the optional ingredients, these turned out WONDERFUL!  They are super-easy to make and still had enough saltiness to satisfy a salty craving.

I have been making these for about 3 years now. Never thought about as a side dish. I make them for a football snack. Delious!!! And more healthier than chips or pretzels. But I eat those too. Real easy to  make.

These are good and a bit salty. They are good in tomatoe soup and chili. I have also made this using pretzels. I baked the first batch but haven't baked them since- they don't seem to need it.

Made these a year ago and my boyfriend STILL asks for them.  Need to make them again, alwasy forget how quick this is.  I do remember it being slightly salty though - it's definitely the Ranch dressing mix; might try to find sodium free or something next time.  Definitely cant wait to use on soup.

Very addicting.  I made the homemade version of the ranch dressing packet (from this site) to use on these, and it made it less salty, but every bit as flavorful.

Great for a snack or on soups.  Very tasty. I used olive oil and omitted the lemon pepper.  Still turned out delicous.

Everyone loves these, although I never seem to have dill, but always use the lemon pepper, which really perks the flavor.  Today, the store was actually out of regular HV ranch dry mix, and I substituted Fiesta Ranch for one batch ... definitely a different flavor, although the original was better.  (I'm an oyster cracker "snob" ... the big fat Nabisco ones are much better, IMHO, than the cheaper store brand I've tried.)

For some reason there are two recipes for this exactly the same, submitted by the same person, so I'm rating both.

These crackers are so good!  The recipe is simple and inexpensive.  I made these a few days ago just to snack on and I've decided they're on the list for my next get together.  I left out the dill weed because I don't really care for dill, I also left out the optional lemon pepper because I just can't imagine lemon pepper with ranch dressing, but maybe it's good.  I did add the garlic powder though.  I had an 18 oz package of oyster crackers, so I'm not sure if that was 5 cups or more/less.  I cut back on the oil a tiny bit and it didn't compromise the recipe a bit.

I definitely give this recipe the full 5 stars, which I don't often do!

I love this snack!  We used to eat it as kids, and it's still great.  I never had it with lemon pepper, but I think that was a welcome addition.  Makes it a little tangy and even better.

These were very good although I think they could use maybe a bit more seasonings.  You could adjust this to your own taste.  This is a good recipe to start from though.  Thanks.

it is great!  At first I thought it was too salty, but the more I  ate the more addicted I became.  I want to ttys it with Italian dressing mix.  A 1/4 cup oil is perfect, not too greasy.

I made these without the dillweed, lemon and garlic powder. I made it with oil, crackers and sour cream and onion mix. It's ugly. But it tastes alright.
