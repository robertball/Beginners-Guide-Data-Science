Good basic starter recipe. I added salt and pepper to each layer and poured the milk/egg mixture over each layer rather than pouring all at once over the top. It was easy and quick.

Because it was for 2 people for dinner I cut the servings in half.  I used one package of 16 oz.  It came out very good ! I will make it again.

I didn't use nearly as much cheese as the recipe called for.  I think I would use a little less mustard next time also.  Overall the recipe turned out really good.  I doubled it for a funeral and every bit of it was gone.

Was very disappointing.  The only flavor was cheddar cheese. Will not make again. Makes box make and cheese taste amazing.

Good recipe. Very similar to my grandmothers'. I used 3 kinds of cheese, a hearty pinch of sugar and approximately a 1/8 tsp of ground mustard powder. My family loved it.

I tried it, it was super bland. I'll add salt and bread crumbs next time.
