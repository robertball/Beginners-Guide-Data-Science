It turned out really well considering there is no specified temp to preheat and cook at. So I did 375 for 45 minutes. The cheese was crusty and almost burnt. So I would recommend 350 and checking on it every 10 to 15 minutes. Seeing as how everything is precooked anyway. All you need is for the cheese to get bubbly. 

PS it was a hit. I got two people in the house who are not a fan of bell peppers.  But they loved this dish.

This went over pretty well with my family. I made a homemade version of spice ranch dressing, taco seasoning, as well as the rice. I would definitely add some fresh, hot peppers in the mix next time. Thank you for the recipe.
