I made a huge batch of this for a holiday party. Everyone loved it and were very impressed that I made it. I did not use the amount of fruit the recipe called for but I do think at least some is necessary. The apples lend a nice touch and the craisins create a lovely ruby red color at the bottom of your glass. Cooking the tea mixture also made the house smell really festive.

This would be great if you are looking for a spiced wine.  Unfortunatley I should have realized that as I was adding the spices.  As a Sangria I did not like this and would rate it a 1.  As a mulled wine, I'd rate it a 5.  Hence the mid road review.  Made as written except I used only one apple.  Four would be too much and the dried cranberrries did not do anything in regard to flavor or garnish since they sank to the bottom.  (The reviewer who said Christmas in a glass had it right.)

Wow...this was so perfect.  It is christmas in a cup.  I was unable to find apple brandy, so I used plain (cheap) brandy.  I could only find cranberry-apple tea, so I used that.I made the recipe to try to use up some mediocre homemade wine, and you couldn't even tell the wine was not good.  The spices and tea made such a nice flavor combination.  I let it sit 24 hours for the first batch.  I making batch #2 right now for thanksgiving.  I don't know if my apples were large, but it seemed like you could get away with half the apples.  It is so good- try it!

This sangria is awesome!! I also could not find apple brandy so I used apple liqueur which is sweeter then brandy so I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I used cranberry pomegranate green tea because I could not find just cranberry tea. Very good recipe!!

I made this punch this year for our annual cookie exchange and it was AMAZING!  I doubled the recipe exactly, except for only adding 4 chopped apples.  I also added cranberries and dried blueberries!  The punch was loved by all!

Substituted cherry herbal tea for cranberry tea, as none available in store. Could use wild berry too...

Add 1 cup of frozen cranberies to the simple syrup tea mixture when cooking. then strain per directions after cooling.

Cook another 1cup frozen cranberries in simple syrup (don't allow berries to split open), cool, strain and then add to fruit mix for sangria. Added a lovely pop of color to the fruit. 

Add 1 cup gingerale to sangia before serving.

Delicious! Crowd loved it....Will make again!

This was delicious - though a bit too sweet for some of us. The spices were awesome. Next time, I might reduce the apple brandy to help cut the sweetness or switch to a really dry white wine.

What a great sangria for the Holidays! I looked for cranberry flavored tea at the store, but couldn't find any, so I opted to use a "mixed berry" tea that I had on hand. It worked great! It made the house smell wonderful while the tea and spices were simmering. I am looking forward to making this again when we have guests. Loved it!

I made this for Thanksgiving and had to make a few adjustments due to lack of ingredients. I used 1 1/2 cups cranraspberry juice in place of the tea and water. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. I had frozen cranberries instead of dried. Came out delicious! My family is now telling me that this is what I am bringing to all family functions.

This was the hit of Thanksgiving this year!  I used half the sugar just because a whole cup seemed like a lot ( I usually do that with everything).  I used cranberry apple tea, and two travel sizes (like airplane size) of apple brandy. It came out delicious and everyone liked it, even those that normally don’t drink alcohol.  I will definitely make it again!

I substitute Splenda for white sugar and look for other sugar--free ingredients.  The sugar-free ingredients do not change the taste of the sangria.

This was delicious! I made a double batch for Thanksgiving and there wasn’t a drop left! Like others, I could only find cranberry apple tea, but it worked great. And I also added some whole cranberries during the cooking part. But other than that, I stick to recipe. Will definitely make again for the holidays!

I made this for a work Christmas party at my house.  It was absolutely delicious! I made it 1 day before and followed the instructions, except for adding a little more brandy. the apples really soaked it up, so watch out for that extra kick! Everyone loved it and it was very pretty and festive!
