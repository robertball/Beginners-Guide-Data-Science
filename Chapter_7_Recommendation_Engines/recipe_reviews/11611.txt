Just like Mom used to make at Christmas time!  The kids and the husband ate them all before we could serve them to guests.  Maybe too good a receipt!

this has got to be the best cookie recipe ever!  I get raves every time I make them!  They are really fast to put together and then they just sit patiently in the freezer until you are ready for them.  I made mine for the first time the day after Thanksgiving and didn't bake them until the week of Christmas.

I absolutely love cherries, so I had to try this recipe, and they came out so delicious! I did change a few things though: I reduced the amount of flour to 2 1/4 cup (dough was not as crumbly), and since I didn't have a lemon for zest, I used 1/2 tsp of lemon extract. I also added a drop of red food coloring to the cookie dough to turn them pink. I only chilled the dough for about 2hrs, rolled them into balls and covered them in the red sugar and baked them for 8min. My fiancee loved them and he's not really a cherry person. I think these are going into my tins at Christmas!! Thank you so much for sharing this! :)

These cookies are delicious! I love making them! The red decorator's sugar just makes them adorable. I added a little bit of lemon zest to give the dough a little more of a bite and it really made things interesting. Not a quick or easy recipe, but a fun one!

Delicious!  I followed some suggestions here, adding grated rind of one lemon with the flour and drying the cherries very well before adding them to batter.

I really liked these! I used only 1 cup of pecans and halved the cherries instead of chopping them. I wanted to bite into a big cherry chunk. Yes, this dough is really crumbly and difficult to work with. I made the dough in the morning before work and baked them when I got home later that evening. I didn't roll into logs because I found it cumbersome. I just used a spoon and rolled the dough into small balls and then pressed down with a fork. I ended up baking them for a total of 12 minutes (bake 6 minutes, turn tray around, bake another 6 minutes). Oh and I did throw in some lemon zest.

This was nothing as I had expected.  Even after freezing the logs, still was extremely messy to slice.  The cherries MUST be dried completely before adding to cookie batter.  Another choice of nut might have made this bland tasting cookie worth going through the mess and trouble to bake.  Won't be making these again.

These were time-consuming and a little messy to make but turned out beautifully. Great choice for a cookie platter! I made four smaller logs instead of two big ones for easier handling. The taste is not obvious but a nice, subtle combination of butter and sweet cherries.

Not really what I was looking for.  Dough was quite crumbly before rolling.  Taste was a little flat.  Due to allergies, nuts were left out.  May play a little with the recipe to add some taste.

I love these cookies! I added almond extract because that is how our local bakery makes them and I like the flavor. My family thinks they are a little dry but I think they are perfect :)

this recipe was ok.  i love cherries and thought i would love this cookie but it lacked in flavor.   i decided to cut in in half cause i only had 1 jar of cherries, when i got to the egg i was confused cause you cant cut an egg in half so i used the whole egg.. not sure if that had anything to do with the lack of flavor in the cookie.. i made a drizzle with almond extract, powdered sugar, and milk and drizzled on top of the cookie for more flavor

I made them just as specified and mine didn't look pretty enough for a Xmas cookie exchange.  I'm a cherry lover, they tasted good, but I'd make these for only 'home' use and not for giveaways or company.

sorry, just had too much difficulty with these cookies. followed the recipe to the T, but found the dough too messy to work with. The final product was disappointingly flat in taste.
