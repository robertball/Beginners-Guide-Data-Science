As written, this dish is a little bland. I have made a similar recipe (with the very same name) for more than a decade. It originally was featured in "Winners- Best Of Bridge" cookbook. A few ingredients are missing in this posting that really will make this a fantastic dish:     1) Add 1/4 tsp of thyme to the flour for additional seasoning  2) Add 1/2 tsp of salt to the lemon juice, apple juice and sugar. DO NOT cook it before pouring over the chicken to bake- simply mix the 4 ingredients together, stir to dissolve and pour over the chicken. Much simpler!    By adding salt and thyme, the dish really does become memorable.

This really is yummy chicken! We loved the addition of apple juice, its a great fall recipe. I served this with apple stuffing and steamed veggies.

This recipe yielded a very moist chicken, somewhat bland for our taste, but pretty good otherwise.  I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I would probably add more garlic and maybe a chopped jalapeno for some kick.

Delicious!  I wasn't sure what to expect because all of the ingredients were so simple, but this really was Yummy chicken.  I made some changes based on what our tastes are. I used extra mushrooms, green onions and lots more garlic just because I really like all those things and also doubled the amount of sauce because my chicken breasts were really large and I tend to like lots of sauce.  Also used apple cider because that's what I had on hand.  Turned out so delicously moist and yummy.  I think I will make this next time we have company over.

This dish was tasty, I changed a little, but not much. When I sauteed the mushrooms and garlic I added an extra clove just to taste it up a bit and I also added a splash of Jack Daniels. About ten minutes before the end of the cook i sprinkled some fresh mozzarella cheese on it.

Excellent.  In the flour mix I add some Montreal Chicken seasoning for a little more flavor.  And I added about a quarter cup of wine in with the apple juice.  Cooked it for less time and it was very moist.  Served it with roasted potatoes and a ceasar salad.

The smell while it is cooking really heightens the anticipation and the flavour does not disappoint!  This recipe is now on the "favourites" list. Next time I make it I will try roasting some Panko crumbs on it with a little Parmesan cheese.  I used 4 Portobello Mushroom caps instead of the 1/2 cup the recipe called for.  In this case more IS better!

This chicken dish was very juicy and easy to make. In the future I would add more seasoning and maybe an additional vegetable.

Tip: Use boneless skinless thicken thighs instead.

This recipe comes from the Best of Bridge.  If anyone else here is familiar with Best of Bridge recipes, you'll know they have hundreds of amazing delicious recipes, and this one is no different.

I make this often and it's easy, doesn't require a lot of ingredients and doesn't take very long to prepare either.

As tipped above, I HIGHLY recommend you make this with boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.  The difference is night and day.

I used pounded boneless skinless chicken thighs. I added paprika, Taragon , herbal poultry seasoning along with the salt and pepper. Also I used low sodium chicken broth along with the apple juice. When I served it too my family I added fresh pomegranate seeds. It gave it a great crunchy tang to it. My family loved it . My son and daughter-in -law and 2 yr old grandson loved it. I will make this again. It is a yummy recipe that you can definitely add what you want. I'm going to try pork chops next time. A great fall dinner!

Pretty good. I doubled the mushrooms, garlic, and green onions. Also doubled the sauce. Next time I think I will put in a tablespoon of flour after cooking the veggies and before liquid to thicken the sauce. Served over buttered d egg noodles and side of green beans.

Very delicious!  I added onions and lemon juice as suggested in another review.
