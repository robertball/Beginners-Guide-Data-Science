This is an excellent dessert that I will definitly make again!!  I used a 9X13 pan instead of the jelly roll pan and just baked them an extra 10 minutes.  It is a great thing to make in place of a pumkin pie.

Wow!  These were a hit!  The first time I made them was for a bake-off, and they won 1st place!  I didn't have pound cake mix either so I used yellow cake mix.  Also, I put a layer of cheesecake in between the crust and pumpkin cheesecake mixture, and baked in a 9 x 13 pan.  Incredible!  I had everyone at the bake-off begging for the recipe!  My husband says he wants to make this our new traditional pumpkin pie!  I will definitely make this again and again.

This was delicious, and much easier than I was expecting.  I didn't have a pound cake mix, or a yellow cake for that matter, so I used a carrot cake mix and it tasted fantastic.  I just skipped the pumpkin pie spice since the mix was already spiced.
I was so worried that the mixture wasn't setting that I ended up overcooking it and the crust is a little burned at the edges, but the center is still wonderful.  
I will definitely make this again!  Next time I will cook less and see how it is when you use a pound cake mix...

Very interesting flavor-not exactly like pumpkin pie but tasty! I made it in a 9X13 glass dish. The crust has nice flavor. You don't notice the cream cheese, just makes for a nice texture and richness, so if it's cheesecake your looking for this isn't the recipe for you.

I fixed this for my family xmas eve and they loved it.  Although when I fixed it I took into consideration those thoughts by others and I added something.  I made the recipe exactly as it calls for using the pound cake mix for the crust but added a box of instant cheesecake flavored pudding to the filling and made it that way.  My family loved it.

Ehhh - I was so excited at the prospect of a different pumpkin dessert, but this wasn't that great - pretty easy to make, however I was looking for a more cheesecaky flavor - someone said something about adding a layer of plain cheesecake in the middle - that might be better.  I used yellow butter cake instead of pound cake - was ok.  They take a day of refrigeration to thicken up enough to cut.

This recipe was a hit! I thought the crust would be a little boring so I replaced about one third of the angel food cake with crushed ginger snaps. Since I added the ginger snaps, I did not include the pumpkin spice in the crust. In addition to pecan pieces as a topping, I also drizzled caramel. It's a great dessert for potlucks and holidays!

I love these bars, so easy to make and so delicious. I use spice cake mix instead of pound cake and omit the pumpkin pie spice in the crust. The spice cake mix works so well with the pumpkin-y filling. This is my go-to dessert for any fall get together!

I took these to a supper at church.  Everyone loved them, except me!  I was not impressed with the crust made with the cake mix. It tasted dry and I did not like the flavor from the pumpkin pie spice.  Next time I will try a spice cake mix and use cinnamon, ginger and cloves like I do with a pumpkin pie.  Maybe some extra margarine to make the crust more crumbly.

YUM! These were so good - and a nice change of pace from traditional pumpkin pie with the flaky crust! Plus it was nice to cut small squares to get a taste. That being said, the recipe title is a bit misleading because these do not taste like cheesecake but rather taste more like pumpkin pie. The addition of the cream cheese did make it a little more dense but the whole "cheesecake" taste was lost. If I make these again I might double the amount of cream cheese using one 8 oz. package whipped with a little sugar to swirl it into the batter giving it a marbled effect. I was able to find the pound cake mix and like others I used a 9x13 baking pan that I lined with Reynolds Non-stick foil which made removing these from the pan very easy giving me a flat surface to cut these into squares. Be sure to wipe your knife with a damp cloth after each cut so each things don't get messy. These were perfect topped with a dollop of whipped cream!

This recipe is a crowd pleaser and super easy.  The store was out of pumpkin pie spice, so I used spice cake mix to make the crust instead of pound cake.  I also made it in a 9x13 pan instead of a jelly roll pan (I was worried the mixture was too liquidy to use a jelly roll pan).  I also omitted the pumpkin pie spice from the pumpkin filling.  The first time I made this, it was pretty good without, but the 2nd time, I added 2 T. of sugar to sweeten up the filling a little.  I let it cool uncovered for about an hour, then put it in the fridge overnight and cut it the next day.  perfect.

The pumpkin cheesecake layer came out a bit more like pumpkin pie than the cheesecake texture I was looking for. Otherwise a great recipe.

This is a very good recipe but I substituted Nilla wafers for the pound cake mix.  I just placed the wafers in a foil lined pan, flat bottom down one layer and crumbled some to fill in the spaces.  No batter to mix and way less ingredients for the bottom.  It's very moist but I think I will try 2 pkgs of cream cheese next time.

I had read a lot of the reviews and implemented the changes into the recipe. I also used a 13x9 pan, a yellow cake mix and added a small size of Instant Cheescake pudding to the pumpkin mixture. The change I added was a different crust, mainly by no choice! I made a mistake in my rush and added the cream cheese to the cake mix mixture. Not having another cake mix on hand and not wanting to go to the store at 8:00pm I made a shortbread crust. It was just flour and butter mixed and chopped walnuts push onto the crust. I pre-baked it about 8 minutes, poured the pumpkin mixture over it and baked about 40 minutes. When cooled and ready to serve I spread Cool Whip over the top. It was really good!

These had a nice creamy flavor.  It was a nice bar recipe in the jelly roll pan size.  I would have liked them thicker so next time I will do them in the 9 x 13 pan.  Everyone had seconds and thirds.

I'm not sure that I get the "cheesecake" part of this recipe, as it really does come out just like pumpkin pie, but this is a great way to feed a pumpkin dessert to a bunch of people. I used a carrot cake mix and about 4 T. of butter to get the crust right. I liked the flavors of this combo (carrot cake/pumpkin), and I did decrease the spices (mixed my own cinnamon/nutmeg/clove) to 3 tsp to compensate for the spices in the carrot cake mix. This was very easy to make and cooked up perfectly on my stoneware bar pan.

I'm NOT a fan of pumpkin anything, except for these cheesecake bars.  I follow the recipe exactly as it is and they've come out perfectly every time.  This recipe is always a hit with whoever tries it!  Can't lose with this one.

I made these for the 2nd time...the first time being Thanksgiving 2 years ago. I messed up somehow & they came out way too soft. This year I made them for Christmas & they were AMAZING...just perfect! I took them to work and shared and my coworkers really liked them. This will be a staple for all of my holiday events for year to come. As a side note, I could not find pumpkin spice but all spice works just as well & adds a great flavor! The crust was SO good!

Okay, but I've had better.  I think the review pertaining to a middle layer of real cheesecake and then topping with the pumpkin mixture is on to something.  It needs something more.  I have a favorite pumpkin bar recipe that has a yellow cake mix sprinkled on top.  This one seems to lack something, like a better topping.  The nuts would be better if glazed first.  This recipe just seems plain jane.  Disappointed.

I made this for a church potluck today.  I thought it was delicious. Several people asked for the recipe. I told them I'd email them the URL.

These were very good.  I used a 9x13 and increased the baking time an extra 10 minutes.  I also could only find a yellow cake mix.  Everyone raved.  At a cost of about $8 for the dish, I will make this again.

Made this several times with great reviews.  I've taken it twice to birthday celebrations for a friend in a nursing home and everyone was asking for seconds.  I don't think that I've ever added the nuts, but it is still yummy.  I use the pound cake and bake it in a glass baking dish (slightly larger than 9x13).  I'm not crazy about pumpkin pie, but I love this recipe.

Love these! I have made them quite a few times, and everyone loves them. I add a little bit more cream cheese (about 1/3 of a package more) and use less nuts on top. Other than that, it's perfect!

First place winner!  I, too, entered this recipe in a bake-off and won first place!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I agree that they are not what you want if you are looking for a "cheesecake" taste, but they ARE full of pumpkin flavor, and VERY delicious! The only thing I would change is to have more nuts on top, such as a layer of crushed nuts to enhance the flavor in every bite. I will definitely make this again!

I needed an interesting gluten-free pumpkin pie-like recipe for the holidays when I found this recipe.  All I had to do was use the Simply Organic Gluten-free Carrot Cake Mix for the crust, and reduce the pumpkin pie spice that I added to the mix in order to get a SCRUMPTUOUS pan of pumpkin cheesecake bars.  I also tried this recipe with the added cheesecake-flavored pudding mix, and received rave reviews.  I made these at Thanksgiving and it was requested by non-gluten-intolerant folks that I make several pans again during the December holidays.  This is a keeper.

This is a perfect "Thanksgiving season" recipe to bring to autumn potlucks or turkey day celebrations. My mom and I make these every year using a small, rimmed cookie sheet. The result is thinner bars and lots of 'em. YUM!

These were really good! I made them for an office potluck and they were all eaten up. I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because they were just a tad too sweet for me. Maybe use less condensed milk? Also, I couldn't find pumpkin pie spice, so I used a blend of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves.

This recipe is SO good!! My family loved it. I can see how the crumbly crust can be a problem so next time (and there will be a next time) I may add another Tablespoon of melted butter to the crust. Note: I used yellow cake mix and baked in a 9 x 13 pan

All that pumpkin pie spice is pretty spicy.  Next time I'd use my own mixture of cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger, not so much allspice.

I like pumpkin cheesecake, but I don't like pumpkin pie.  I was hoping this recipe would be a compromise, but it just tasted like pumpkin pie to me.  Everyone else loved it, my brother said he liked the texture better than a regular pie.  Everyone scarfed it down, except for me.  The cream cheese changed the texture but, didn't make this a cheesecake.

Wow..that might not help you select this recipe but it should.  Easy enough to have these ingredients on hand in your cabinet.  Use any type of cake mix. I really love the recipes that call for box mixes.  These can be eaten with a fork and topped with cream, or eaten like a bar in your hand if it is cut into smaller pieces.  Cool pumpkin filling that doesn't taste overly cheesecake-y.  Very nice crust with enough sweetness so it doesn't taste like pastry dough.  You will get rave reviews from your guests.

These things are so good. I took some to work for people to try and everyone loved them. I had alot of people ask for the recipe. I changed the crust a little to add a different flavor. I used white cake mix and instaed of using the pumpkin pie spice in the crust I used cinnamon. It is very good. I am not much of a cook and I found this recipe very easy to follow and each time I have made them they taste great. I am going to make them for my family thanksgiving dinner this week,I am sure everyone will love them.

Over all these were great. I did (as I usually do!) add more spices for flavor. I was somewhat disappointed with the consistency of these. I was hoping they would firm up more, but stayed kind of gooey!

Very good. This a Creamy Nice Pumpkin Bar. I used Yellow cake mix because none of the stores near me had Pound cake mix. I added cinnamon and fresh nutmeg to the mix. Also Only added cinnamon and nutmeg to the pumpkin mix. It came out great. Loved the Nut topping. My Friends said "Awesome Pumpkin Bars".

Easy to make but not a lot of flavor.  It was better if heated up a little before serving.  Needed gluten free so used Pamela's pecan shortbread cookies to make a cookie crust.

My aunt gave me this recipe. I came on her e to make sure it was on All Recipes because it's so easy and a crowd-pleaser! I made it this week for a work breakfast potluck and they were a hit, as usual. My only suggestion is, if you think they are done, give them another 5 minutes, or the center might be a bit more sticky.

I love anything pumpkin. These were wonderful. I made no substitutions. The only thing I will do different is use a different crust. I found the pound cake crust to be dense and pretty tasteless. I will make them again but use a pecan or walnut crust and top them with whipped cream

I used white cake mix and baked a little longer (until a knife inserted came out clean) they came  out wonderful. Will definitely make these again.

Very easy to make. The pound cake works perfectly and didn't stick to the pan at all.

Loved this recipe. I made a few changes that the other reviewers recommended at it was great. I used a 9x13 dish and baked an extra 10 minutes. Also used yellow cake mix and 4 tablespoons of butter. Couldn't find pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Added cheesecake instant pudding to pumpkin mixture. Yum Yum

This was SO good and SO easy to make! I did not put nuts on top and regret that. I think it was missing the crunch. Took it to a party a couple of weeks ago and still have people asking for the recipe. Very good!

These are fantastic! I agree with other reviewers, there is nothing cheesecake about the taste. It pretty much tastes like pumpkin pie (which I love.) The recipe is super easy!

This is a great dish to make for parties or holiday gatherings! I really don't know about the pound cake mix for the crust in the size pan that it calls for in this recipe, that did NOT work for me at all! I had to move down to a smaller pan and luckily it worked out, that is my only complaint.

These were absolutely amazing.  I made these for Thanksgiving this year and have been enjoying the leftovers in the days since.  After reading some of the reviews, I went ahead and made the crust with carrot cake (as it was the only cake mix available to me in a UK grocery store) and left out the spice in the crust.  I used quite a bit more melted butter than called for to get the consistency correct.  I also used a 13x9 pan as I wanted the pumpkin layer a bit thicker.  I left out the nuts as I'm not a fan.  My husband and I absolutely LOVED the bars.  It's a fool proof recipe!!

okay, not bad.  i guess i was expecting something better because it was reviewed so highly.  not as sweet as i would have liked.  next time i would top with a cream cheese frosting, skip the nuts.  thanks!

Very easy to make and everyone seemed to like it. Perfect alternative to pumpkin pie. Next time, I might consider adding a little sugar to the liquid part of the recipe to make it a little sweeter, but that is just me. It was good as-is.

I made these for a thanksgiving dessert. My boyfriend's dad isn't a big sweets eater, but he LOVED them. He end up eating like 8 of them, lol. They were a big hit! And they were SOOO easy to make. Like others said...you do need to let them chill for at least a day before cutting them.

Excellent recipe and very easy to make!  I used a 13x9 pan, instead of the jelly roll pan, and baked for about 35 minutes.  Also, I used pecans for the nuts, and the bars tasted wonderful!  I've already sent this recipe to several friends to make for the holidays.

Made this last night, it was very,very good.  It's a nice variation from traditional pumpkin pie.  Made it w/ a regular butter flavored cake mix, didn't have 15x10 pan so I used an 17x11, turned out excellent.  Will definately make again.

These came out WONDERFUL! I brought in half of the bars to work and gave half to my bf to bring to his work for halloween.  Literally all of them were gone by 10:30 am. Like all the other reviewers said they are really like pumpkin pie not like cheesecake.  Also I had no pumpkin pie spice so I just added a little less than the recipe called for of just cinnamon.  I also made the bars in a 9x13 pan and cooked them for about 10 minutes more.  They came out delicious.  They were also very easy to make.
