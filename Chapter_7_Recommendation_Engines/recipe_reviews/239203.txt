I love these cookies but I change it up a little for my taste. I use organic whole wheat pastry flour and stevia in place of the white sugar. I use almond butter which replaces the peanut butter well and no need to add almond flavoring. I add pieces of nuts and raisons, also.  My family and neighbors love them.

Absolutely fabulous and delicious, easy to make. 4 stars just because we prefer more peanut taste.

The almond extract adds a nice touch. I also added some almonds. None of the ingredients are too overpowering. Beating the sugars and fats until light and fluffy made the cookie turn out...light and fluffy.

This was a great recipe. Just the right amount of peanut butter flavor, just the right amount of sweetness. The almond flavor was a great touch too.
