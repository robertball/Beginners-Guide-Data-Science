I love Red Lobster Biscuits so I was excited to see the great reviews!! I added garlic salt in with the biscuit mix and the melted butter, you definately need to add the garlic to the biscuit itself!! I cooked them on the very top rack and in 10 minutes, had great biscuits to pair with my homemade chicken noodle soup, thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!!!!

I really liked this recipe.  We had them for breakfast this morning and my husband liked them too.  Based on reviews of this and a similar recipe on allrecipes, I added the following to the biscuit batter:

1 tsp. of garlic powdrer
1/4 tsp. onion powder
1/2 tsp. of dried parsley

I baked at 450 degrees (which is what is on the Bisquik box) and at about 9 minutes, I took them out, brushed with the butter mix (to which I added 1/8 teaspoon onion powder and 1/4 teaspoon dried parsley) and put back in for a couple of minutes.  They were great.  We will definitely be having these again!

Thanks for sharing the recipe.

awesome and easy.  did add a couple extra drops of moisture in the form of half and half; about 2 tbsp.  EXCELLENT!  used to work at Red Lobster and these are the closest things to the real deal.  Did not have biscuit mix, so used pancake mix instead, which is pretty much the same thing.

These biscuits are amazing! I added 1 to 2 cups of cheese to really bring out the cheese flavor but this is a great recipe!

Made these today and used 1 cup of old cheddar, 1 teaspoon of crushed garlic and 1/2 teaspoon of oregano...mmmm very yummy! The melted butter and garlic powder on the top makes them even better.

my boyfriend told me his aunt used to make these, so I looked for a recipe after we went to Red lobster one night, and came across this easy lil gem!!  Do need to add garlic to the mix itself tho, and I doubled the amount of shredded cheese!!

The first batch I made were very dry and also kind of bland. For the second batch, I added more cheese, a big pinch of parsley and a lot of garlic salt. Seems to be a very forgiving recipe. I recommend adding regular salt as well as increasing the amount of other seasonings.

A little bit dry but that is easily solved with more milk next time. Over all they were very delicious.

Great recipe!  Make sure not to make them too small, better to err on the side of too large.  Takes only 5 seconds to make this, as a mother of three, I'll be coming back to this recipe often!

Wow!! It didn't taste like R.L cheddar biscuits but , it did come pretty  close. I read a couple of reviews to tweak the recipe a bit.. The biscuits turned out crunchy on the outside and incredibly soft in the center with a hint of sweetness. I highly recommend viewing a couple reviews before attempting to make this recipe to save you disappointment in the end.

Big hit with my husband... served with Balsalmic Glazed Salmon, Honey Almond Green Beans, and Dutch Potatoes.  Used buttermilk instead of milk.  Also used fresh garlic and added parsley. Thank you!  We will have these again.

Tasty, but they turned out pretty small, and they burned a little too. Also, they stuck like crazy to the ungreased cookie sheet.  So my recommendations are: - Spray your cookie sheet - Make the drops about 2x the size that the recipe says - Maybe add a bit of salt

These are amazing - and SO simple!!  I also added the garlic to the dough.  My only other change to the recipe was to add about 2 Tbs more milk - I thought it was a tad too dry.   Delicious - they might all be gone before dinner even starts!

I doubled this and added extra seasoning. Fresh garlic would be a bonus - I plan to try that next. Plus I did grease my cookie sheet, that was a must. Great all around savory biscuit. Thanks!!

These were really good, but the cooking time is long...be careful because the bottoms will burn. Watch every few minutes. Other than that..they were really good!

To make these biscuits really good you MUST brush them with garlic butter. I like to do this before AND after they go in the oven!

OK, rather bland though. I followed recipe exactly. Family ate them but nobody asked for seconds (unusual for them). I would suggest SHARP cheddar maybe for more flavor. I'll try it again like that.

Great- I took the suggestion that somebody put out though, and with the extra added garlic salt IN the mixture, it's totally a 5!!

Easy and excellent.  I doubled the cheese and put the garlic powder in the biscuits and brushed the melted butter and a smaller amount of garlic on top.  Made this with a roast beef--a perfect combo!  I will make these again.  My husband said I should serve these my shis-ka-bobs this summer.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum very good and easy. I added more cheese & garlic. My tops starting burning, before they were ready, so right out of the oven I was afraid they might be raw inside. After cooling they came together quite nicely. I might lower the temp a little next time.

This is always a huge hit at family gatherings.  I do mix it up by adding shredded parmesan in addition to cheddar, but I think you can't go wrong with this no matter how you put it together.

Good basic recipe. First batch, I used as directed. Second batch I use some of the suggestions. ** use 3/4 c water instead of milk** 1 cup of cheese and garlic powder in the batter as well as on top.

I used the Butter-Dipped Biscuit Squares recipe from this site instead of the buttermilk baking mix. It was a total hit with the family.

These bisciuts are really easy and fast!  We enjoyed them.  I think they need to have more cheese.  I will probably be a little more liberal with the cheese, next time.  We will def. use this recipe again!
