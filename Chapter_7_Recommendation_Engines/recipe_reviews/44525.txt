I told the kids to search allrecipes for something with hot dogs - they came up with this.  Now they want to eat it every time my husband and I go out.  It was a big winner!

My husband decided to make this easy recipe for hot dogs and it seemed a different alternative to plain old beans and weenies. My kids were not as crazy about it as was expressed they would be. 2 lbs of hot dogs was just WAAAAAYY too much. In the end noone wanted seconds and it sat in my fridge for a week  until I finally pitched it. I'll stick with plain old beans and weenies.

This is really quite good.
I did modify it a bit.  I only had crushed pineapple, so I used that, and I kind of guessed on the sugar (just used brown, no white)...but probably used about 1/2 cup.
To thicken it, I cooked it on the stove top and let it boil for a good 10-15 min without stirring it.  I always find my beans thicken that way.
I also opened up hot dog buns on the plate, and scooped the mixture over it.  Almost like a sloppy joe.

I made this for my daughter's birthday party. I thought it sounded kind of strange, but it tasted really good. I did NOT add 2 cups of sugar as that would have been WAY too sweet, and no white sugar. Just 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet. As is this recipe would get 2 or 3 stars with that ridiculous amount of sugar... Cookies have less sugar than that! Also it was too thin. The guys and kids loved it and kept going for more... Some of the women were afraid to try it, though! I would make it again for another kids party, not for dinner though!

Everyone really liked this, at first I was weary with the pineapples, but they were great. I would recommend not eating leftovers from the day before, with the sugar in the recipe it became too strong and thick with sweetness.

I made this for my office party potluck. I added a small amount of jalapeno's and some canned diced up green ortega chile and it was a huge hit... Everyone wanted to know what that wonderful smell was in the office as it warmed up. I will for sure make this again.. Super easy.

We just threw this one together for dinner on the stove top, not the crock pot.  I took the advice of previous reviews and cut back the sugar.  As one who lives in Hawaii, I know that adding pineapple to a recipe makes it "Hawaiian" in the eyes of some cooks.  But what Hawaiian really means (tongue in cheek) is "serve over rice."  This recipe was excellent over rice!  It took up all the extra fluids.  And yes, Hawaiians eat rice with everything, breakfast, lunch and dinner!

I gave it 4 stars because it tastes pretty good and is a good budget friendly pot luck option.  For those who had problems with it being too sugary, try using regular pork and beans rather than "baked beans".   I left out the white sugar due to comments about it being too sweet but think I could easily add it in without a problem; other than the pineapples themselves this didn't turn out sweet for me at all.  If the liquid was more like a sauce and less watery this would be a 5.  I have it sitting on low now so maybe some of that liquid will evaporate off.

So Good!  I like spicy stuff (even hot dogs) so i added a schluk of Thai BBQ sauce to this recipe.  The hot and the sweet blended perfectly.  I thought the sauce was a little too loose, so I added some tiny pasta.  Absorbed the excess water and became the perfect thickness!  Will make again!

This was alright.  There was not nearly enough for a meal for me and my daughter and I brought it down to 10 servings.  Then it was just okay and sweet enough with just a half a cup of brown sugar.  Any more and it would have been too sweet.

Yes I was surprised!! I threw in 3 cans of pork and beans 11oz. campbells, large can of pineapples w/ juice, 8 pack of hotdogs, sauted a small onion and few dabs of hot sauce.  I added NO SUGAR. Put in slow coooker on low for 3 hours. I did not stir it and the hotdogs had a nice little brown on them. The pineapples really make this different and I think next time ill wait a half in hour before done to throw them in. This is a cheap and easy meal. I had everything on hand and wasnt expecting to much but this came out good. I think next time I wont even cut the hotdogs and have it on a bun! Yum! thank you:)

Only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet!  I used 1 pkg of litte smokies, 2 cans Maple baked beans, and 2 cans of drained pinapple tidbits.  Was a hit with all of us, but I couldn't imagine using any more sugar.

This was a great tasting recipe. We don't like hotdogs unless they are fried in a pan, so I used Cocktail smokies. It was a bit runny so next time, I will drain the pinapple. I also didn't use the 1 cup of white sugar. Im glad I didn't because it would have made it to sweet. The family liked it and I will make again.

Not too bad! I did not want to go to the store and happened to have everything in the house for this!
I reduced brown sugar to 1 cup, used 1 lb of hot dogs, omitted white sugar, used the juice from the pineapple and bush's baked beans and then I thickened the sauce with instant potatoes! Turned out great!

I sauted one pound of sliced hot dogs in a medium hot pan until they were nicely browned, added a chopped onion and continued to cook until onion was carmalized. I added three cans of beans with pork in tomato sauce and one can of pineapple tidbits with the juice. I didn't add any sugar. I reduced the heat to medium low and cooked it until beans were hot (about 15 minutes) I served it over toasted and buttered english muffins. Entire family thought it was tasty. Lighter tasting than traditional beans and weiners. Is our new go to lazy pantry dinner-in-a-hurry. Thanks for sharing.

I must admit, I'm really happy I found this recipe. I couldn't bring myself to add the full amount of sugar, I don't think my pancreas could take that. After playing with it, we renamed these Hawaiian Pizza Beans. I used 1 pkg of smokies, one drained tin of pineapple chunks (my boyfriend drank the juice), two tins of pork and tomato beans, 3/4 tin of tomato sauce, 1 Tbs oregano and 1 tsp garlic powder. Not the exact recipe, but very tasty. We topped it off with mozzarela cheese for the full effect. This is the new camping food on our list. Yay!

Yummy! I added a can of drained pork and beans, and I only used a cup of brown sugar, (no white sugar).  Big huge hit at our 4th of July celebration.

So the kids loved it but it was not my favorite as the sweetness was overwhelming.  I advise to consider cutting back on sugars. I also expected it to be a little thicker but instead it was more like a soup consistency.

I decided to make a 1/2 batch to test it out.  I took the advice to cut sugar in 1/2, thank goodness I did that because it was still SUPER sweet!  I think next time I will cut it down even a bit more... ;)~  I did also include about 2 tablespoons dijon mustard to help cut the sweet a bit and it seemed to help.    Was so super easy, quick, fun and yummy too!  Not so much a "dinner" type of entree but would be great for potluck, party, kids party, big gathering, etc.    Thanks for posting D Cotton!!  :)

I didnt use all the brown sugar, and I was pleasantly surprised how good this was.  I would not eat it every day, but for those leftover hotdogs it is great!

This was alright...lots of preservatives and lots of sugar! Probably won't make this again. It was alright...definetely a "kid friendly" food, but I probably won't even make it when I have kids since there are so many preservatives and sugar in this!

We didn't make this recipe quite as written - rather we used it as an alternative to plain hot dogs on a bun.  Drain the beans well with a slotted spoon and put them in the bun before the hot dog- delicious!

Only so-so. My kids didn't really eat it, and my husband and I didn't really care for it (and I love all the ingredients). I only added 1 cup of brown sugar and a tablespoon or two of white sugar and it was still plenty sweet. Won't make again.

Really quite good....when trying to slice it though, it fell apart a bit.{I did not use the dried onion.. I cut up a fresh one..to me I think it tastes better than the flakes}.. tooooo crumbly  to make sandwiches the next day...so we just nuked it & it was good!     Thanks! Will put this in my recipe box!

This dish is so great!  It incorporates, nutrition, ease, quickness of prep and cook time, and kid-friendly all in one.  My son and daughter just absolutely LOVE this dish!  It's the only time either one of them will so much as think of eating pineapple!

I tried this recipe a few months back.  I put it over rice.  That's the only thing my family didn't like about it.  So This time I'm going to use egg noodles.  That's the families idea.  They loved it.  And it's so easy.  Instead of using my slow cooker I just threw everything in a pan on top of the stove and simmered it that way.  It was great.

My family really enjoyed this dish, even my very pick 2 year old. However I did find the sauce a little to runny, and would like to find out how to fix it because I plan to make this dish for and upcoming birthday party.

I thought I'd make this dish as a quick fix for our company on Saturday.  It's not what I expected, thought it would be thick like a salsa so I thought the gang can scoop it with taco chips but when it was done I found it too juicy.  The taste was great though so next time I will not add in the pineapple juice to see how it turns out.  GOOD STUFF!

I will definitely make this again because it was so easy and the kids loved it.  It was very sweet though, and I might try to do something about that.
