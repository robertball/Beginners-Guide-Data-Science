Okay I loved this! I was looking for something simple to make last night and my name is Cassie so I thought to myself I have to make this! Also my fiance is in the Navy and I saw a review saying this was a hit with Navy guys so it confirmed it! It was awesome! I think I might try adding marshmallows for Christmas!

This recipe made my hungry Navy guests rave this past Christmas. So so easy, and a flavorful crowd-pleaser. Just make sure you get all the chunks of cream cheese smoothed out!

This was so fast and easy to put together while we all still await the infamous turkey! 
This even tastes great not frozen!
We tried it with a Oreo Cookie pie crust-and Oh My-adds the extra nice addition to this pie!
All the kids love it, as so do us adults.
Kudos to Cassie for this wonderful treat!

Usually cream cheese adds a lot of taste--but this cream cheese made this one of the worst meals I have ever ate....Also cranberry sauce? I thought cranberry sauce was for meals at tahnksgiving???

I made this on a whim last year for something different, and everyone loved it! It is the new "hit" dessert that is requested for holidays now. My husband and I keep the ingredients on hand during the winter months, just to have for ourselves. Definitely will be a staple for years to come.

Awesome and easy, I also did the same thing with candy cherries, milk, and chocolate whipped cream, a little chocolate sauce and I  added a little protein powder for texture. absolutely delicious.    When I made the Cranberry version I made homemade cranberry sauce instead of canned, really added to the flavor.

Yummy and so easy to make! Great starter dessert for my teen son to make. Heâ€™s working on his Cooking MB and making a dessert was one of the requirements. He was proud of himself!!

A former co-worker used to bring this  to our pot lucks. When she left so did her cranberry pie.  She alternated using a pre-made  graham cracker or Oreo cookie crust based on what was on sale. Lastly her pie was garnished with walnuts or pecans. Again, which depended on what she had on hand. She told us it was quick and easy to make but never shared her recipe.  

I came looking for a recipe to replicate her pie. This tastes just the same.  I add nuts before freezing as a garnish and sometimes will mix then into the filling.  The kids like the Oreo version best. I garnish with Oreo cookie crumbs. It makes a great nut free option.  The pie tastes great and is always one of the first desserts to go when served. Love it.
