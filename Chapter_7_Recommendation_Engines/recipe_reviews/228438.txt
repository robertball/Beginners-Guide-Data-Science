The smoke-flavored almonds distinguishes this recipe from the many other pea salad variations. Much like bacon, adding smoke or honey flavored almonds to a salad often makes it better, and unquestionably did so in this case. We separately folded in some mayo with a small amount of pea mixture to do a taste test. It tasted okay but we wanted a healthier and lighter tasting dressing than all mayo. We combined 1 part mayo w/ 1 part Greek low-fat plain yogurt which was mixed w/ a little Pinot Grigio Italian wine vinegar (or white vinegar), Dijon mustard, powdered stevia, and salt/white pepper to taste. We very much enjoyed this lighter version pea salad. Thank you PHILHERB.

I think the chopped smoked almonds is a fantastic idea that I will be adding to other salads as well!  I also added some grated cheddar and a little red wine vinegar and sugar to the mayo.

Thought this combo was delicious!  To those of you wondering about the "white and brown chunks", am sure those are pieces of onion and the chopped almonds.

I really liked this recipe!  I added shredded cheddar as suggested, but used 3/4 c of light Hellman's mayo.  I could have used less onion because even though I used sweet onion, it was very strong.  Thank you for sharing!

This was good but I tend to like a lot of *stuff* in these types of recipes. I made it as is and it was kind of bland for me. I added an aged white cheddar, chopped boiled egg, celery and nuked some turkey bacon for on top. I do really like the almonds in it!

Much better using sour cream with just enough mayo to mello out the sour cream. In addition add a couple chopped green onions, and bacon crumbles. Chopped water chestnuts go very good in this as well.

If you want the bacon flavor without the almonds, simply use salad baco-n-bits or fry some bacon to a crisp.  The white chunks in the salad is probably the onion chunked.  However, I have put chicken chunks in pea salad.  You can also use less mayo than the recipe calls for and if you prefer salad dressing instead, use that.  Reality is, this is a very basic pea salad that has a little twist with the smoked almonds but there is an enormous amount of ways you can create pea salad.  You just need to experiment with what you like.

I was skeptical at first because of the almonds.  But, WOW!!  This will undoubtedly become a new favorite in our home.  Similar to a previous review, I added about 1/2 cup of shredded American cheese.

Isn't this easy peasy! (Get it?) Made as written and it was good. Then I added some grated cheddar and it really rounded out the flavour. The salad holds up well too. It was still good the next day. Great recipe, especially with the brown and white chunks!

My husband who usually hates peas really liked this.  The smoked almonds really added a nice flavor. It tasted better after it chilled for a few hours in the fridge. I think I will try adding some shredded cheese next time.

This is a update of a very old recipe. The original recipe calls for peas (fresh or canned), Spanish peanuts, and small, sweet gherkins, sliced. Mix together and dress with mayonnaise.

I made a half recipe today and wish I had made the whole recipe.  Took it to a friend's house as an extra side dish for lunch ad everyone, including me, really loved it!  The smoked almonds really do give it a bacon-y taste.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I've made this for several potluck meals and frequently get compliments on it.  The smoke-flavored almonds are key to the flavor of salad.   Initially I had a difficult time locating the almonds, but realized many stores sell them in the snack nuts section rather than in the baking nuts section of the store.

Great, and even greater with 4 slices of crisply fried or nuked smokey bacon, crumbled, 1/2 cup grated sharp cheddar, and a tablespoon of fresh snipped chives.

Don't care for the mayo in this recipe.  Have made it with a vinaigrette dressing and it was better.  In the pictures, what are the big white chunks and small brown chunks?  Need a picture that accurately shows the salad.

In place of the mayo I used Greek yogurt and a little mayo.  Also 2 tbs of Apple vinegar.  Gives it zing.

Peas are practically a food group for me. For the most reliable results, I use frozen baby peas instead of mature peas. (When shopping, be sure to squeeze any package of peas gently to determine if the peas are loose inside or frozen into clumps. Avoid the latter. They've been allowed to thaw & re-freeze, usually to the detriment of the peas.) Great additions to pea salads can include: chopped scallions (mostly green parts); shredded chicken breast (not dark meat); diced Hass avocado; diced fresh jalapenos (with seeds & ribs for the brightest flavor); bacon or ham; small cubes of Muenster or cheddar; crumbles of Gorgonzola or Danish blue; sliced (not slivered) almonds; & dried dill weed. For a more substantial meal, add cooked macaroni that's been rinsed in cold water & drained (for a macaroni salad, maybe adding some sliced black olives, too), or cooked white rice (for a warm rice salad). Pea salads can even work as toppings on warm or cold potatoes. For the dressing, I usually combine blue cheese dressing (such as Marie's) & mayo. My macaroni salad dressing: 3/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup cider or rice vinegar, 1 Tbsp. sugar.

Quick and easy recipe for Easter or a picnic.  I would also bring it to a potluck.  I followed the recipe except used a vegan mayonnaise.   It was delicious, cool, and crunchy (due to the nuts, not the peas).  Definitely will make again!

This recipe is a big hit! I changed it so much you might say it's a different recipe but this one was the inspiration. I used red onions because that is what I had. I used regular almonds because I added bacon. I split the mayo with nonfat plain yogurt. Everyone raved about it. Plus making it is so quick and easy, why would you buy it at the deli for 8$ a pound when it is so inexpensive to make?!

This was very tasty and simple.  The only differences I did was half the recipe (for a trial run!) and added just a little bit of crumbled bacon.   I think once it chills even more, it'll be even better.  This is going in my pocket as a go-to for potlucks and such.  Thank you for sharing it!

Fantastic pea salad! However due to my dietary restrictions per doctor ordered... I replaced the mayo with fat free sour cream mixed with fat free plain yogurt.  Probably still not the best thing but heck there's some "greens" in there :-)
