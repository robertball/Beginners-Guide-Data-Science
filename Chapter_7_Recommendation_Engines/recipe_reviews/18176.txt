You can't make a real SacherTorte with boxed cake and boxed icing and some jam!
Real SacherTorte is dense and moist, but NOT sweet.  The "frosting" is more of a chocolate glaze which drizzles down the side of the genoise and buttercream filling with either apricot or raspberry jam.  Try again!

This recipe gets barely 3 stars. It's not a SACHERTORTE, not even close. It's a boxed cake with rum and apricot added to it. Disappointing to say the least. I should have known when it started out with boxed cake!

This is an excellent recipe. An authentic sacher torte is apricot, but I have found that orange marmalade is a super substitute. The chocolate cake I made was altered a bit...instead of using water in the mix, use half and half or buttermilk. This makes the cake more moist and flavorful. Add a little Grand marnier for a special treat.
