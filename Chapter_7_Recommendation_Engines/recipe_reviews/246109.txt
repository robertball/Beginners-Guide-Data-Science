Other than cutting the recipe back to four portions I made this as written.  While I did like the bread on it's own I do think that it would be much better served with soup or stew. Not counting  the resting period this came together very quickly and I will make this again.

I make this often. I wanted to give 4 stars because of the suggestion that you can do without the oil and also use a mixer. I've never been able to make this with a mixer although if you have a mixer that is used to make dough, I suppose it can be done. I did not want to take away stars because I have tried neither suggestion. I fry the bread using oil liberally. It is a good recipe, and the bread is so versatile. The recipe is not as complicated as it seems but there is no way of getting around all the steps. It actually goes quite quickly once you get the hang of it. We eat it with breakfast, snacks, chai, and stews. Yum!
