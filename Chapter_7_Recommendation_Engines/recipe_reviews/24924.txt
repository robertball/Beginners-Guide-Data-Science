Down South we call this Jezebel sauce and it shows up at nearly every party. It is fantastic. We use a 12-oz jar of pineapple preserves a 12-oz jar of apple jelly 2 1/2 oz of horseradish (1/2 sm jar) 2 t dry mustard and 1 T cracked black pepper. It is great on Ritz crackers.

My aunt made this with a jar of apple jelly (apricot works too she said) as well as the pineapple preserves and a few teaspoons of horseradish instead of the jar. She swears by it as a ham sandwich spread too. It's pretty good:)

This was gobbled up at a party we went to! The only thing was I had to buy pineapple ice cream sundae topping b/c there were no preserves in the jelly section. Worked great and extremely easy! YUMMY!

Very good. Nobody can quite place what the combination of flavors is but they like it! Also interesting to try with wasabi "to taste" instead of the jar of prepared horseradish.

I've been making this recipe for years and it's become a family favorite. Only difference is that I also add a jar of apple jelly in as well.

Pineapple and horseradish sounds like such a bizarre combination but I have made this dip on more than one occassion and it's always a party hit. People love trying to figure out what the heck they're tasting but they can rarely figure it out. I totally recommend this recipe. I could eat the whole batch by myself!!!

Got lots of complements both times I brought it. Couldn't find pineapple so went with peach preserves which worked just fine. Also could only find the extra-hot horseradish so only used 1/2 a bottle. Thanks for the recipe..so easy.

I also have been making a sauce a lot like this one for a very long time. Mine calls for a jar of pineapple preserves 1/4 c yellow mustard & 1/4 c prepared horseradish. Very good with chicken nuggets.

I couldn't find Pineapple preserves so I used Apricot instead and only used a couple spoonfuls of the horseradish. It was delic and got rave reviews! No one could believe what was in it and that it was so easy.

i have to say...i have never heard of this. so reading it I scratched my chin and made a mental note of what I had on hand. I had Fresh sliced pineapple whipped cream cheese horseraddish mustard I made a small sample (no measuring) and my golly it was good! i smooshed the pineapple before mixing. it was all made with a paring knife and fork. i WILL be making the recipe as stated above next time.

This was very good! Not having tried this before it's initial taste was surprising. The sweet and creamy went well with the horseradish bite. I tested it with my daughter as well and she loved it too! This will be added as party dip to be different than the other usual party staples that show up.
