I made this as a quick lunch today. I used ground turkey instead of beef, homemade taco seasoning and V-8 in place of the water. I also used homemade salsa and reduced fat sour cream. Because I'm eating low-carb, I skipped the chips on my portion. NO LEFTOVERS.

Definitely easy and tasty!  This does make for a simple weeknight meal.  I used lean ground beef and "Taco Seasoning II" from this site and didn't bother with the water, just seasoned the beef and browned it.  I de-seeded a few plum tomatoes before dicing and used a light Mexican blend cheese. I added some chopped black olives and green onion for a better presentation and cut back on the sour cream and chips using just enough for each salad.  To lighten it up a bit I used light sour cream and baked chips...

I tend to want to layer my taco salads with the lettuce on the bottom unless I am using a large taco shell for the base - that said - this is a fine recipe - the nutritional information was a little scary - I didn't use any where near the amount of sour cream, cheese & chips called for.  Makes for a nice fast dinner.

We liked it.  I used ground chicken instead of beef.  Easy to prepare.  Will make again.

Such an easy salad for a quick dinner on a warm night. Cooked my black beans in with my ground beef and didn't need as much water as called for. For a great dressing try the avocado ranch dressing on this site.

Very good.  I've been making an almost identical taco salad for years that I had adapted from the taco salad that uses Catalina dressing and Doritios.  I usually use a homemade taco seasoning for this.  We layer the tortilla chips on first, crunch them down with our hands, and add whatever toppings we desire-I serve them separately.  We like the black beans better than kidney beans, and I usually have some I've cooked from dried in the freezer.   A nice quick, relatively cool, easy meal during the summer.

It was good, I prefer ranch beans to black beans, but this was good.  My husband loves taco salad so it was a hit for him. Served it with organic blue corn chips.

After traveling a good part of the day to get to Naples, I wanted neither restaurant food nor a make- at-  home dinner that required a good deal of time (hey, I got up at 3:00 this morning!).   Cruising the website while at 37,000 feet led me to this recipe.  A  quick stop at the grocery store for just a few things and less than a half hour in the kitchen, and  a very good and satisfying dinner was served.  I wasn't fond of the layering instructions, so I just put all the goodies out for Hubs and me to build our own  - this way  everyone has it "their way."  Served with an ice cold margarita, this really hit the spot.
