This is a recipe I have used for almost 40 years, however I make it slightly different and a little more healthy. I don't use any butter.  Instead I saute a 1/2 onion, diced, and the mushrooms in 1 tablespoon of Canola oil. In the same pan, I then brown 1 pound of ground beef and add 1 can of Consomme soup.  In a separate bowl, I mix 1 cup of Lite sour cream with 3 tablespoons of flour with salt and pepper to taste, then add to the meat mixture and let simmer until flavors have blended.  I've had so many compliments over the years.  It's a quick, inexpensive way to fix a delicious meal.  I call it "Poor Man's Strogonoff"!

I'm rating this after a second attempt.  The first time I followed the recipe to a T and thought it was bland, but a great starter recipe (3 ***'s then).  I've since made it with the following substitutions.  While cooking veggies and meat I added salt, pepper, minced garlic.  When adding the broth I also added 3 tbspn of red wine.  Instead of using 1/2 cup sour cream, I used 1/4 cup low fat sour cream and 1/4 cup cream of mushroom.  FANTASTIC!!!!!

This is almost identical to the recipe I made last night. It's the best stroganoff I ever had. It has some changes. I used 1 pound sirloin,sliced very thin(almost shaved). Dredge in flour and brown in a couple tablespoons butter. In another pan fry up onion and 8 oz. sliced mushrooms in 2 T butter until golden. When done, deglaze both pans with about 1/2cup white or red wine. I had omitted this process because I didn't have any wine and it was still awesome. Combine all into one pan. Add 2cups beef broth and add 1 cup sour cream. Simmer all for 30 min.or until meat is tender. During cooking the sour cream will separate and some of the butterfat will become visible, don't be alarmed, this is normal, just keep stirring. Season with salt and pepper and can add 1 T worchester sauce if desired. Add 1 more cup sour cream to this just before serving. Serve over cooked noodles. It is basically the same as this recipe, but a bit more pricey because of the meat and more work but so worth it. This version is from a very good chef so don't be afraid to try it. My family went crazy over this version and that is why I gave it 5***! Thanks Colleen!

This was very good. I followed the directions precisely, and it turned out just perfect. There was a nice balance between the flavours of all of the components, and expecially some sweetness from the onions, and great mushroom flavours. The Stroganoff was creamy, and really flavoured each and every noodle. I made enough for 4 portions, so that I can eat more at a later date, and I am glad I did. This is the best tradtional stroganoff I have had to date. Add 1 clove minced garlic to mushroom/onion mixture for enhanced flavours. Thanks Coleen!

GREAT recipe! Very flavorful and very easy to make. I substituted olive oil for butter, beef consomme for beef broth and added 1 tbsp of minced garlic to the onions and mushrooms. Delicious!

Delicious for how easy it is! Made a few changes. Added 1 tsp minced garlic to  the onion and mushrooms; used sliced sirloin steak instead of ground beef and added 1 tsp  dijon mustard to the beef bouillon. Made the dish a little more flavorful and less Hamburger Helper-like.

I was looking for a recipe similar to the Rice-A-Roni stroganoff that was recently discontinued.  With a few modifications, this recipe fit the bill.  I sauted the onion and hamburger together, adding a couple cloves of minced garlic, leaving out the butter.  Just as the hamburger started to brown, I added a can of sliced mushrooms and continued to cook.  Once the hamburger was brown, I deglazed the pan with some dry sherry, then, instead of adding flour, I added the beef broth, brought it to a boil and added 1 cup of minute rice and half the sour cream.  Brought it up to just boiling, covered, reduced heat and simmered 10-15 minutes until the rice was done and it started to thicken.  Right toward the end, I added the rest of the sour cream.  My husband loved it.  It will definitely be made again.

Good starter recipe.  Started out a bit bland but was VERY good after some tweaking.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added Worchestershire sauce, garlic and pepper.  I also added onion salt, plus additional salt.  Still needed a little kick so I added paprika.

I didn't care for this recipe. First, it doesn't state it and I know most cooks do it automatically but DRAIN THE FAT from the ground beef.  It should still be in the instructions because sometimes you want to keep it and sometimes you don't.  This is a don't time.  It can come out greasy and soupy if you don't.

I also recommend not cooking the noodles separate.  Once you've completed the sauce just before the sour cream is added, through the noodles into the dish and let them absorb the sauce.  The noodles come out bland if you don't.

Season very well.  I added a fair amount of salt and pepper and still found it bland.

great starter recipe.  changes i made:
1. add mushrooms when onions are partially cooked.
2. add 3 T red wine & 3 cloves minced garlic while onion/mushroom mixture is cooking.
3. brown onion in only 1 T butter.
4. use lite sour cream, of course.
5. add 3 more T red wine to sauce.
6. let sauce simmer for 15 minutes to allow flavors to blend.
fabulous.

This was yummy with my own additions. 2 garlic cloves, double mushrooms and soy sauce. For the gravy I mixed powdered beef broth, brown gravy mix and the liquid from the mushroom cans along with more water.

This was really good. I read some other reviewers' comments and included some garlic at the end of sauteeing the mushrooms and onions, and also added some worcestershire sauce while cooking the ground beef. I eyeballed the flour and beef broth amounts, and added more of both as I felt was needed. I used low fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream. The sauce had a nice, thick consistency and was really yummy.

This is one of our stand by, go to meals.
I made the following changes.
1. Put salted water on to boil. (should be as salty as the sea).
2. Slice fresh mushrooms, dice 1/2 medium onion, mince a clove or so of fresh garlic.
3. Drop the noodles in the water just after starting the meat.
4. Place meat in skillet.  As the meat just starts to brown and juices begin, add the onion.  Add the garlic a little later on. (You're cooking the onion in the beef fat rather than butter.
5. After the meat is cooked, drain off all but a tablespoon of grease.
6. Return pan with meat to burner.  Sprinkle the ground meat with 3 to 4 tablespoons of flour and cook for a minute or two (the culinary term is singer and it allows the grease (fat) to coat the flour and cooks the flour.
7. Add 1 cup of beef stock/broth and stir.  Add more as necessary to form a nice smoother sauce.
8. Add mushrooms and simmer.  The sauces will thicken as it cooks.  
9. Continue to simmer until mushroom are done.
10. Just prior to service; take it off the heat and stir in the room temperature sour cream.
One pan, quick, fast, and in hurry.  If it is too dry or bland try changing the beef or beef stock/broth

The key is the beef stock/broth.  Scratch made is the best; however I do quite well with beef base or Bouillon.  Lately I've used "Better Than Bouillon" by Superior Touch.

Another key is the ground beef.  I find the 80/20 good.  The 90/10 seems to be too dry.

This was a good/easy recipe for beef stroganoff...but we did make some minor changes.  Following the suggestions of some other reviewers, we did add about 2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and substituted 1/2 of the sour cream for Golden Mushroom soup; it's probably also worth noting that we cut this recipe in half, and it turned out just fine.  DH did enjoy the flavour more than I did...I felt it still lacked something, but I'm not sure what.

EXCELLENT!!  I followed the advice of other people who rated this recipe and added some chopped garlic (two cloves) & red wine (1/2 cup)to brown the beef...along with the butter & later the flour etc. 
A little salt & pepper with just one cup (8 oz) of sour cream added near the end just turned out to be awesome. 
I also used black angus london broil beef; cut very thin across the grain; that was cooked on a gas grill several weeks before (that I usually save & freeze for steak fajitas) instead of the ground beef. 
The beef added a nice slight smoky flavor to the sauce which was served over lightly buttered egg noodles. A huge hit with my friends who easily compared it with similar dishes at 4-star french restaurants. 
A VERY VERY good base recipe for beef stroganof.  Highly recommended!!!

This recipe is a good starter, but needs a few tweaks to bring it from "ho-hum" to something special. I saute chopped onions with a clove of minced garlic in Canola oil until almost done, add fresh sliced mushrooms and continue cooking for a minute or so. Remove from pan.  In same pan, fry thinly sliced round or sirloin steak which has been seasoned with pepper and salt (optional). When done, add flour, 1 T. Worcestershire sauce, 1 T. lemon juice, the beef broth or bouillon, and one bay leaf.  Stir until smooth and add the mushrooms/onion mixture.  When heated through, add sour cream.  Stir until combined, remove from heat and serve on top of the cooked and drained egg noodles.

This was very good, but I used many of the previous reviewers' tips and a few of my own. I added minced garlic to the mushrooms and onions- we love garlic and I think this would have been a bit bland without it. I did not cook my hamburger in butter - who needs the extra fat? I found that the 1 cup of sour cream was not enough, so I added a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and a few dashes of worchestershire and dijon mustard. My boyfriend LOVED this. My one tip to fellow cooks - use a VERY big skillet. By the time you get two pounds of beef,  cups broth, and all the other ingredients in the pan - there's barely any room to stir. And stirring is definitely necessary to blend the ingredients well. Also, I used a 16 oz package of egg noodles and found it to be too many noodles. Definitely pay attention and only use 12 oz. Especially if you're like me and like the noodles mixed in with the beef sauce.

This is one of my kids' favourite dishes and it is so easy that they can help make it too. It is a go-to for busy weeknights. I always use lots of mushrooms, olive oil, lean ground beef, and low-fat sour cream. A few times I used whole-wheat flour and that worked fine too.

I have been making a similar recipe to this for years with one VERY importantant twist. Go ahead and cook your pasta as usual.  I brown the ground beef and when about half done I add the chopped onion. Sautee all until done.  Drain the excess fat from the browned beef.  Add your fresh chopped garlic and sautee just a couple of minutes being careful not to burn the garlic.  This is where I make my secret twist to this recipe.  I have found that when you use flour to thicken the consistency of your sauce and add beef stock or beef bullion, there is an easier and much more delicious twist. I mix 3-4 talespoon of Brown Gravy mix in about a cup of water and dissolve very well. Add the brown Gravy mix and it thickens the sauce and gives it the Flavor Boost needed to keep this recipe from tasting so bland. Add the mushroms and continue to simmer until it thickens. I then add the sourcream before serving and stir slightly so you can see the sour cream and brown gravy slightly mixed together.  Now that's Gooood!!!

This is a fantastic dish! I did however make slight changes: For my beef broth I just added about 3 cups of water to my hamburger while cooking with some garlic powder, salt, pepper, and dried parsley and drained it and set it aside. I also used a 16 ounce container of sour cream rather than just a cup.  I like to sprinkle a little more garlic powder, salt, and pepper in the end.  Wonderful dish! Thank you!

I rarely take the time to write a review or rate some of the recipes on here, which I should do more because I appreciate when people rate and review mine.  I made this recipe as is and I found it to be very flavorful.  I did add Worchestershire sauce which added that little "extra" that it needed.  I also used low sodium beef broth so that I was in control of the sodium content.  I do not agree with the amount of butter used in this recipe and would most certainly not use that much again.  That's the reason it only gets the 4 stars instead of 5.  The ease of this recipe is great.  I know there are many, many ways to make a good stroganoff, but this one is a keeper for me and my family when a quick, but delicious meal is needed on a busy weeknight.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will absolutely make this stroganoff again!!!

Very good and easy!  We made this twice already, once with thinly sliced sirloin steak and the second time with ground beef.  Both times turned out well but kids like it more with sliced sirloin steak.   Would have rated this 5 stars, except we made some changes per the recommendations of others. We replaced 1/2 c sour cream with cream of mushroom soup, added worcestershire sauce and garlic, and omitted the flour as the sauce was thick enough.

Hubby loved it...that's all that matters.  Next time I will add salt as I cook the meat and maybe add garlic for flavor.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe! From start of chopping onions to the table...35 minutes! Thank you!

Easy and tasty.  I did add fresh garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and doubled the mushrooms.  My husband liked this.

We really liked it.  I felt that the sauce need a bit extra beef flavor, so I added some beef base and then it was perfect.  Easy and tasty. Will make again.

I made this recipe the other night, although I made it a little different and it came out GREAT! I don't like beef stroganoff at all, never have, but this was really really good! I used 1 med. onion, 1lb of ground beef. 2 tbsp of flour, 1/2 C sour cream, 1 1/2 C of beef broth and 1 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce along with all the other ingredients this recipe called for. The Worcestershire sauce gives it a really good flavor.

Really good - everyone cleaned their plates.  Used beef stew meat instead of hamburger, and cooked this in the crock pot.  First I coated the beef with flour and browned in batches with a little olive oil.  Once all the beef was browned, I added a mixture of half shallots and half white onion (didn't have enough of either by themselves) and pre-sliced baby Bella mushrooms to the skillet and lightly browned them.  Added mushroom/onion mixture and beef to the crockpot, deglazed the skillet with some of the beef broth, then added all the broth to the crockpot.  I also added some thyme leaves, as I like the flavour they add. When I got home, I mixed about a tablespoon of flour with the sour cream, then mixed the sour cream in the crockpot to finish.  Served over kluski egg noodles.  Great and super easy dinner to come home to.

The only things I changed is that I don't use butter and I added 1/4 cup of red wine.  This time I had 93/7 fat ground beef.  This is my go to meal for quick, delicious meal that makes me look good!

This was great! Followed to a T with the exception of adding salt and pepper according to my own taste and also adding swiss cheese to the sauce. Delicious!

My husband loves Beef Stroganoff. It's not healthy by any means, but you can probably use low fat cream cheese and whole wheat noodles to cut down on the calories and fat.

Excellent.  Based on reviews, I sauted a sliced onion and 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms in salt, pepper, garlic powder & 1 tablespoon of olive oil and removed from pan. In the same pan, I then brown 2 pounds of ground turkey seasoned with salt, pepper and arlic powder and add 1 can of beef broth. In a separate bowl, I mix 1 cup of fat free sour cream with 3 tablespoons of flour with salt and pepper to taste, then add to the meat mixture and let simmer until flavors have blended.

Exactly what I was looking for.  Tasted great!  the only thing I did different was that I added about 4 cloves of garlic to the mushroom/onion when sauteing.  This can easily be modified to be a bit more heart healthy by using ground turkey, omitting the  butter and just using a tablespoon of healthy oil to cook the mushroom/onion/garlic and using a lite sour cream.  YUM!!!

I didn't really follow the recipe but I took another reviwers advice instead and cooked an onion in canola oil, then browned 1 lb. of extra lean ground beef, added one can of consomme soup, then 1 cup of sour cream and 4 tbsp. of flour to the mixture and simmered until thick. I served this over egg noodles, and it was very yummy! thanks for the idea!

This was enjoyable, however I wish I had read the reviews before I attempted this. I made the mistake of using low fat sour cream and it was much too watery and not rich enough. Live for today and use full fat sour cream!! I will try this again though, it was very nice and heated up very well the next day. :) Thanks for the recipe Colleen!

I really thought this was easy to make.  The only time I have ever eaten stroganoff was when I bought the boxed version.  I really liked this and since my husband was late for dinner, it was an easy recipe to hold up for a while.  I did read the reviews before making and took some others ideas by adding some garlic to the meat while browning and a little bit of white wine to the sauce.  It really tasted very good.  I think next time I will try it as it stands and see what the outcome is.  Thanks for posting.

This recipe was super easy to make and super delicious. In the past, I'd only used sliced beef steaks in my Stroganoff. But, after trying this recipe, I'll definitely switch! It's  a bit more tasty and a lot less expensive to make. My husband is not a stroganoff fan. But, after fooling him one night by telling him that it was Hamburger Helper, he now requests it -- very often! The only modification that I made was to add a bit more beef broth, to give it a little more flavor.

I really liked this dish. This will be a regular at my house. In the future, though, I'll drain the mushrooms and onions after sauteeing them. Adding them back in with their juices caused the thickening broth to become way too thin. (Oh ... I did add a splash of sherry with the broth. I couldn't resist!)

Really tasty! I added some minced garlic, though, and some garlic salt and freshly ground black pepper while the meat was cooking. Very easy, and very delicious! It was even tastier reheated the next day.

Liked this recipe because it was quick and easy.  Need to add some extra seasonings to make it taste like true beef stroganoff.  Was a bit bland with only salt and pepper.  Added onion salt, and garlic salt as well as the salt and pepper.  For low sodium diets onion and garlic powders can be substituted.  Also helps to mince some fresh garlic and cook with onion and mushrooms at start of recipe.  Very Yummy!

This is a great Stroganoff -no fuss no mess.  Since there are just two of us at home, I used one pound of beef, 3 Tbs of flour, 1 Tbs Worcestershire sauce and 1 cup of fat free sour cream and the stroganoff still came out terrific.  Since I didn't have egg noodles in my pantry, I used fusili (or rotini) and my husband actually liked them better.  By the way, the left over sauce freezes very well.  Thaw to room temperature then heat and serve.  Great make ahead dinner.

I've been using this exact recipe for years.  I love it. Only I noticed by reading some of the reviews that some people have trouble witht the sour cream breaking/seperating.  You should take the pan off the heat before adding in the sour cream.  Don't let it boil after adding it.  One cup of sour cream at room temp. won't cool the dish down much at all.  I take the sour cream out when I start dicing the onions and mushrooms.

Very quick and simple, but lacking on taste.  It tasted like something was missing.

The basic concept of this recipe is very good. I made a few changes however. I do not use hamburger, if I wanted hamburger helper I would buy it. Therefore, I substituted the hamburger for steak. I then saute fresh mushrooms and and onions, add about 1/4 c more of sour cream and a little milk to thin it a bit. Most everything else is the same. As I said the basic concept is really good. I have made it the way the recipes calls(minus the hamburger) and it turned out very good. Everyone loved it. I have just made a few slight changes to make it a smidgen better. At least i like to think so.

Good flavor.  I used half ground beef and half sausage.  I didn't add as much sour cream and left out the mushrooms altogether.  Will make this again for sure!  Very easy!

A quick recipe for a good family meal, I added some garlic to the mushrooms and onion while they were cooking, definitely a recipe I will make again. More than enough left over for lunch the next day!

It was good except it called for too much onion.  I had even reduced the onion to half a small onion and it was to overpowering of a taste.  Added garlic powder and lawry's seasoning while cooking the meat.  Maybe would suggest a red onion or a sweet vidalia onion for a sweeter flavor.

Very good.  I had some left over trip tip so I just made the sauce and served it over the meat along with steamed white rice (my husband likes this kind of dish better with rice than with noodles.)

This actually turned out pretty good, but I did make a few changes. First of all, I cut the recipe in half because it was only for 2 of us. I used ground turkey, reduced fat sour cream and chicken stock because that is what I had. I also added diced bell peppers and some paprika. I felt it needed more sour cream because it was still a little thin, so I added in about another 1/4 cup. I will definitely make this again because it was yummy, easy, cheap and very filling!

We halved the recipe and used ground turkey in place of the ground beef.  Did not use any butter. Used reduced fat sour cream.  Next time, will add some garlic.  Served with salad and "whole wheat beer bread" from this site.

I love Beef Stroganoff, but this recipe is lacking a little zing.  I use strips of beef, 2-3 cloves of garlic, W-sauce, and my secret ingredient: Dijon mustard.  Def kicked it into high gear.

I like using Campbell's condensed double strength beef broth or one can each of Campbell's beef broth and Campbell's french onion in this recipe to give it an extra umph in flavor. Great over egg noodles, best over garlic mashed potatoes. This is SO good.

very good recipe. Modified it only slightly by using strips of round steak that I had left over. And used just a bit of cream of mushroom along with the sour cream. Makes it quite tasty. Will do this one again.

As a jumping off point this recipe is great. It is quick and easy and kid friendly. My family loves mushrooms so I was able to add more of the things that we love. Also I bumped up the flavor with some crushed garlic and a little red pepper flake.  It completed the flavor to perfection.  My family loved it and I will make it again and again.

My boyfriend really loves stroganoff, and this recipe was perfect. Topped with a little sour cream, it was great. I almost always add extra pepper to things like this, so I think that was the only thing I kinda changed. Great recipe!

Thanks to reviewer "awesome in tummy."  I took the suggestion of thinly slicing sirloin into strips instead of the ground beef.  A bit more time consuming but very much worth the extra effort!  My husband absolutely loved this recipe and so did I.  Read the suggestions by "awesome in tummy" and follow for a great dish.

I added Worcestershire sauce as well as French cut green beans. I skipped the chopped onion and fresh mushrooms and in place of them, used dried onions and canned mushrooms as I was lacking the extra time needed for the fresh ingredients. It all turned out well and my family enjoyed it.

This was absolutely wonderful. Being single, I usually make big meals on Sunday evening so that I'll have something for the rest of the week for left-overs. This is even better the second day.

I didn't really make any changes except for adding garlic to the mix. I just added the ground beef to the onion/mushroom/garlic mixture instead of removing. I mixed the flour in with the broth which did make it easier to mix. Also, just to cut out a step and extra dishes, I doubled the broth and just added the uncooked noodles to the whole mix, covered and let simmer for about a half hour.  Will definitely make again.

I made this dish for dinner last night and was delicious.  The only changes I made were using beef stew meat instead of ground beef and adding a few tablespoons of red wine into the meat and sauce mixture.  Thanks for such an easy recipe.  I'll definately be making this again.

As is, this is ok. 
I left the sliced mushrooms out due to preference and subbed a can of cream of mushroom. To make it healthier, I use olive oil instead of butter. Sauteed some chopped garlic (1/2 - 1 T?) with the onions, and drained it the beef & onions before adding the sauce. 
I only use about two T of flour to balance the taste, and add about a quater of a cup milk to make it saucier. Very easy and quick!
My Ingredients: 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 onion, 2-4 T olive oil, 2 lbs beef, 2 T flour, 1/2 c sour cream, 1/4 c milk

This recipe definitely deserves 5 stars! Easy to make, fast and delicious... It will become a staple at my house. I had never made stroganoff before because I'm not fond of beef but with ground meat, it's a different story! Thank you for posting!

Excellent! I made a few substitutions because of my bare pantry (1 cup water w/beef bullion instead of canned beef broth, onion powder instead of onions) and made some changes due to taste (added 2 tsp. minced garlic to saute pan, used 1/2 of sour cream, added 2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce & added 1 cup cream of mushroom soup), but it was AWESOME and my family loved it. Will try again the "right" way! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was good but I'd much rather make this with steak cut into strips.I used lean hamburger and even after draining the grease off I still found it too greasy.If your going to try this recipe use extra lean hamburger but for the price of it you might as well go with 1 and a half lbs. of steak.

5 stars with changes!  Used ground turkey & worceshire sauce to flavor it.  Also added 2 cloves of garlic to the mushrooms, used RED onion, and added 1 beef bullion cube.

I have been making this for years now, with the addition of a sprinkling of chopped parsley on top as a garnish.  The family loves it, and has christened it Sorta Stroganoff

Very good recipe.  I made this vegetarian with Morning Farm Crumbles instead of beef, and used a vegetable broth instead of beef, but other than that followed the recipe.  Everyone loved it..even the carnivores.  Thank you, great recipe.

I am one to follow a recipe and then add a few of my own touches.  Well I was in a hurry and did'nt bother to add anything extra and that was a mistake.  This recipe was so bland it was hardly touched. I will not make this again, it was terrible.

Excellent with the following modifications.  First, I sauted onions in cooking spray, not butter.  Then browned beef with no butter.  In addition to beef broth, I added 3/4 cup dry red wine and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce and a tbsp of cornstarch.  I then had to boil for about 15 minutes to thicken.  (I skipped the mushrooms).  Finally, I added the onions and sour cream and served over hot buttered egg noodles - delicious and flavorful.  Will make again - thanks!

My family ate this up, kids and adults.  Great recipe. One thing worth noting:  I used lowfat sour cream and it did detract from the flavor.  Next time I will just go full fat.

We did not like this. The sour cream flavor was overpowering. I think it would have been better with half the amount of sour cream and some milk to make the sauce. Hubby wouldn't finish his serving and that is extremely rare.

Made it the first time and followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was for 4 people and found I had made too much because the recipe did not adjust. I also thought it had way too much onion but was a bit on the bland side.

I'm giving this a 4 star rating as it's not completely deserving of a 5 star which should be saved for truly GREAT recipes, but if I could rate this as a "simple and easy weeknight dinner" recipe, I would give it a 5.  This was so easy and really good... I wanted to use the beef consomme as recommended by the #1 reviewer, but I had none and ended up making as directed except I added a mashed up beef bouillon cube.  The flavor was just wonderful and what a treat to serve something so good that did not take long at all (I always have browned ground beef in the freezer so that helped quite a bit.)  Thanks for the recipe and I enjoyed making it!

The first time I made this  recipe, it wasn't very flavorful. My changes were:

Technique: 1) saute' the mushrooms (med/high heat w/ butter) so they leave caramelized bits on the bottom of the pan. Remove mushrooms; 2) add beef to the same pan. Don't crowd the beef. When done, remove to bowl with mushrooms. 3) Add beef broth to skillet, scraping the bottom to get all those bits off the bottom, reduce sauce by half, add sauce to mushroom/beef bowl.  **Browning the items separately one after the other and then deglazing the sauce will give your sauce that wonderful color and superb flavor you need to make this dish work. 4) Turn skillet to medium heat, add butter; when butter foams, add onion, tomato paste, and brown sugar. Cook, stirring frequently, until onion is lightly browned, (6 minutes); stir in flour until incorporated. Gradually whisk in chicken broth and wine; increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, whisking occasionally, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Add all other ingredients.

Added ingredients: 1/2 cup of chicken stock and 1/2 cup of dry white wine (added at the end for flavor)
1 teaspoon of tomato paste (acidity), and 1 teaspoon of brown sugar (adds sweetness & balance). 

*For a lighter dish, I used light sour cream and served it over a combo of mashed cauliflower/red potatoes w/ the skin on (for fiber), I also split the amount of flour in half and used low sodium broth.

This was a great easy & quick recipe. I did make a few additions that made it FANTASTIC. I added 1/2 t. chives & 1/2 C. cream cheese which made it even creamier and yummy. I also used fresh portabello mushrooms. My son & husband devoured it. After making this Beef Stroganoff my husband is not ever going to let me make Hamburger Helper Stroganoff again. LOL

This was a great recipe & I'm thankful to say that I've now made home made beef strog. I"m sure there are easier recipes but this one is so creamy & delicious. It was even better the next day for lunch! I add minced garlic to the beef and onion mixture as well as worchestshire sauce. I also had a some onion & garlic powder :) my fiance loves this recipe and asks for it so often.

I'm giving this a 3 because, when I prepared it as written, it was a bit bland. For the next time through, I'll do what other readers have done and add a few more spices. It was a nice start, much healthier than the boxed, processed items we usually eat. We love beef stroganoff, and this was a good base. Served this with egg noodles, warm corn muffins, and steamed broccoli.

Made this for dinner tonight with a side of country biscuits and although it was okay and we ate full portions, it still needs something to zip it up.  Next time, and I will make it again because it's easy, inexpensive and really did taste okay, I'm going to take some reviewer's suggestions for adding garlic and worchestershire to add some kick. It was just a wee bit bland.  But still goes in my regular rotation so thanks for posting this.

Three and 1/2 stars. Better than OK. Will keep this one.  Turned out pretty darn good except the ground beef needs more seasoning.  Will change that for next time.  Wife still doesn't like mushrooms (cut them big so she could pick them out,) but she liked the rest. She wants to use it on company. Had left-overs the next day and it was still delish!

I made this today for my husband & I and we both loved it! I added minced garlic to the onion/mushroom/butter mixture. I also added a little bit of Worsheshire Sauce to the ground beef. Then when it was all together I added some red wine to give it some depth & richness. Delicious! I added these extras because as I was taste testing each step of the way, it seemed a tad bland for our liking. These extras made it perfect for our tastes.

I've been making almost this EXACT recipe, except for the mushrooms, (which I LOVE but the rest of my family won't eat!) but I use cream cheese instead of sour cream. Just cut it into cubes & add it to the hot beef mixture last. Stir until melted. VERY creamy!!! YUM!!

This is a winner! Stroganoff lovers and even those who havent had it will surely like it! Didnt have egg noodles so I just used the thin spaghetti I have in the pantry. It turned out divine! Will surely make it again and again! Thank you for sharing!

Super delicious as is! But . . . want to make it lighter but still just as delicious? Skip the butter and use 1 Tablespoon olive oil, use low sodium beef broth, low fat sour cream and ground turkey. This version has all the flavor without so much fat and calories!

While the recipe lends itself to a tasty and simple entree, the accompanying picture is really a turn off. The beef looks completely raw and the sauce has a red tint instead of the nice brown beef and gravy that the recipe creates. Please replace this picture with something more representative.

This was pretty good.  I'd probably make it again, however I wouldn't use ground beef, would use real cuts of beef instead, mostly for presentation value I think

This was very easy to make.
I did add a clove of garlic (chopped up) to the sauteed mixture of mushrooms & onions.
There wasn't a lot of strong flavors in this recipe.  The next time I will add more seasoning (ie: salt/pepper, etc.).

This was yummy!  The only changes I made were to add 3 tablespoons red wine and two cloves of garlic to the beef while it was browning.  I also used half an onion instead of a whole onion.  My husband and I will be having this again!

I made this for a group of 26 people and I got rave reviews! I omitted the mushrooms because I don't like them, but I doubt that changed the overall flavor of the recipe that much. Everyone loved it!

Ok, so good! I base my ratings on whether my 2 year old will eat it -- and she ate it! I did use modifications (as usual!), cream of mushroom soup etc. I think that made the difference. Yummers.. Thank you everyone!

Easy, fast and delicious. I used canned mushrooms instead of fresh (because I already had several cans) and just added them in after the ground beef was already cooked. Just great! Thanks Colleen for sharing!

The meal was great, easy, and quick. I made a few changes because I didn't have mushrooms. I added 1/2 cup of mushroom soup and strained the rest to put the mushrooms in the meal. I also added mustard seed seasoning and combined my noodles and stroganoff mixture before serving.

As is, the recipe is 3 stars.  This is a good starter to spruce up a bit.  I cooked the mushrooms (I used more like 8oz) and onion with the ground beef and added some minced garlic, paprika, and Worcestershire sauce.

This was fantastic. The whole family ate it up. I did not have fresh mushrooms, so I added canned at the end it it was super yummy. Other changes were: added garlic, cooked onions and meat together, added fresh Thyme and oregano, and used fat free sour cream. Will totally be making this one again.

Ok so this is a good BASIC recipe but that's exactly what stroganoff usually is. Sure you could spice it up with steak strips, etc. but in my experience it's just not meant to be a gourmet meal.  So if you're lookin for gourmet you best look elsewhere for a more extensive recipe. The usual is good ole ground beef for cryin out loud so with that pretense I thought it was pretty decent for an economical, simple, and "comfort food" style meal. I used arrowroot powder instead of the flour, 1 1/2 lbs meat with less mushrooms, and like others added a nice splash of white wine while cooking the mushrooms. And yes definitely drain the grease before adding the butter. All in all good meal and I'd make it again for something quick and filling!

This is absolutely fabulous and I have been asked for the recipe more than once. Instead of fresh sliced mushrooms, I use a jar of pre-sliced mushrooms in olive oil. I think it gives it a little added magic, because the next time I made it, it wasn't quite as good and that was the only difference.

This was very good and very easy!  Even my mostly vegan daughter ate it up (she is just very picky about what meats she eats).  I also sauteed the onion and garlic with the meat during the last couple of minutes and added the cream of mushroom soup instead of all sour cream.

The only change I made was I added 4 (very small) cloves of minced garlic to the onion/mushroom saute, and this was fabulous, and I don't usually care for stroganoff. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Simple, yet delicious! Followed the recipe exactly but used light sour cream and more mushrooms. Great for those nights when you want a great dinner, but don't have a lot of time. Thanks for sharing!

Really enjoyed it.  I had left over pot roast and used that in place of the ground beef and that worked well too.

Fiance wanted Stroganoff with ground beef (my mum uses cubed) and this was the only recipe that called for fresh mushrooms (my mum uses canned). it was exactly what we were looking for, although i think it could stand to have even more than 6 oz shrooms. did not use lean ground, and with all that broth was worried the sauce would be thin or greasy, but it came out perfectly. used a mere 1/4 tsp S&P, and left each person to season more than that to their liking. normally do not post when there are so many, but felt the simplistic nature of the recipe was being misrepresented as "bland" :)

Great job. Just a couple of mods. I used stew meat for instead of ground beef (still 2 lbs), about .75 of an onion and sauteed with the mushrooms on medium. i nixed the sourcream all together, as heating it on medium for about 15 minutes and stirring occasionally will thicken up just fine and help the lactosally (you get what i mean) challenged. serve with some crescent rolls and you're in business.

I only gave this four stars because I did tweak it to my liking. I cooked the meat individually (along with a clove of minced garlic & pepper) drained and plopped it into my crock pot with the beef broth. Then I sauteed the onions and muchrooms together with pepper and paprika and tossed them into the crock on low. Then about 30 minutes before sertving Inmput the sour cream (mixed with the flour) in and let it thicken up a bit and served over egg noodles. I left out the butter......yummo and healthier!

Made this last night using reviewer recommendations and it was very good.  Cooked onions and mushrooms in reserved bacon grease, added cooked meatballs, 2 cups beef broth and sour cream mix (8 oz sour cream, 1/2 tsp granulated garlic, 1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper, 2 T corn starch, 1/2 tsp salt).  Simmered for 10 minutes and added 1 tsp dried parsley and 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce. Simmered for another 10.  Served over egg noodles with baby peas and steamed broccoli.

I took suggestions from other users but I still feel like this recipe is missing something.  I added a TON of pepper and garlic.  I also added a few splashes of W-sauce.  It was good but not fantastic.  Maybe next time I'll play around with a few more spices. I've also seen versions that add tomatoe paste.  Maybe I'll try that next time.

Very fast and easy and YUMMY to boot! I love that it doesn't use cream of anything soup. I used sliced up round steak instead of ground beef (only because I happened to have some on hand), 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms, low sodium broth, and lowfat sour cream. I also added paprika and I think this really made the dish! My husband and son loved it and I was told not to lose this recipe. :)

Any recipe that is delicious, easy and completely from scratch is a 5-star recipe in my book!  The only change I made was using low-fat sour cream.  Next time I will skip the 2 Tbsp. butter the the beef is cooked in, just to make it a little healthier.  This will definitely be added to my favorites folder!

This brought raves at my house. I scaled this down to the amount of ground beef I had and used beef consomme instead of broth. I added a tiny bit of Kitchen Bouquet browning/gravy sauce for color. I did let the flour cook some before adding the consomme to it. I simmered this for abut twenty minutes so it was ready when my husband came home for his lunch break. Thanks for a great recipe!

This came out good.  It was a little too sour creamy for my taste so next time I will just add less sour cream...maybe like 1/2 a cup.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This was a great recipe.....really easy and tasty!  I put the leftovers with the pasta in a casserole and it's dinner for tomorrow night.  Next time I make it, i may try some additional sour cream or possibly some milk, I may like it a bit creamier.

I was used to using the stroganoff mix but I didn't have any at home so I tried this recipe and now I will never go back to the powder mix. I also added some worsteshire sauce and a little garlic as well. Turned out great!

Made this last night. Super yummy! I substituted beef stock for the broth, just because that is what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious and easy. I took some leftovers to work for lunch, and it was yummy again! This will definitely become a regular meal in my house. Even my picky daughter loved it! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was EXCELLENT... after doing some tweaking. Husband & I thought it was very bland following the recipe exactly so we added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup as well as seasoning salt & garlic powder to taste. We also used beef sirloin instead of ground beef. Also, make sure you mix the broth and flour together first before adding to the mix so it doesnt get lumpy. Have made this a few times and it will stay on our list of favorite meals!

This recipe definitely lives up to the title. It's easy to make, and it's quick. I felt like the sauce was a little runnier than I would have preferred,  but it still had a great taste. I'll make this again.

This is the best beef stroganoff, and so easy and inexpensive to make.  Don't make any changes and it turns out great!!

Very good.  Per some of the other reviewers' suggestions, I added garlic, Worcestershire sauce, and red wine (to deglaze after cooking veg.)  I cut the recipe in half - for 4 servings, and it worked out great.

Pretty good- a little bland though. Next time I will add some garlic powder and more salt and pepper. It was very easy and creamy- the family enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing.

This came out very tasty.  The only change I made was that I added a few drops of worcestershire sauce for added flavor once I read some of the reviews stating that it was a little bland.  Thanks!

I lost my gramma's recipe and this was the closest thing to it. I used Moose backstrap cut thin - cook time is next to nothing - and followed the recipe but added a couple tbsp tomato paste and a touch of ketchup like my grandma used to.
Perfect- thanks!

This was very simple and quick to make, but it was bland. I added some Worcestershire sauce. It needs some color, so maybe next time I will add peas and some fresh parsley to the beef. 
This recipe is great for kids. You could even add cheese - kids love cheese.

This is so quick and easy...everyone who has had this wants the recipe! The only change I make is while I sautee the onions and mushrooms I add fresh garlic to the mix and cut down on the butter. Sometimes I add green onions for a little color.

This was overall a great, easy dish. A couple of tips to make it even easier and tastier - whisk your flour into your beef broth before you pour it in, instead of adding the flour straight to the hot ground beef. This way, you won't end up with lumps of flour. Also, I added about 2 Tbsp of worcestershire sauce and 1 Tbsp of soy sauce, for more flavor. Next time, I will add garlic when I saute my mushrooms and onions. I used mushrooms from a jar since they were handy, and I didn't have fresh mushrooms on hand. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this was delicious, and my family seemed to like it. I did listen to some of the reviews and added garlic in with the mushroom and onions; and I also added worchestershire to the sauce. I thought over all it was a wonderful recipe that only used fresh ingredient, instead of ones out of cans (which can cause major sodium overload)... But it did lack a little flavor (next time I think I will have to add more seasoning). I would would definitely make this recipe again, and hopefully with a few tweaks, make it a 5 star recipe :)

This is a great recipe.  I make a few modifications for my family's taste.  I don't like onions or mushrooms - I substitute onion powder & I leave out the mushrooms.  I add garlic - a must.  I only use 1/2 the butter for the garlic, onion powder & other spices.

Really good.  Quick too.  I thought that it might have needed some worchestershire sauce.  I also add ketchup to mine and it gives it a bit of tang.

I had this type of stroganoff in mind when I came across this recipe, as I had all the ingredients on hand already.  It was so simple, quick, affordable, and really delicious.  It tasted like it took a long time to prepare.  This recipe will become a staple dish for my family. My husband LOVED it, and we're looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.

This recipe is SO good and easy to boot. I will definately make it again and again. :)Reheats very well.I have made this several times and always have better results when I have the leanest hamburger I can get at the store (92%). When I've used 81% lean it is a bit too runny/greasy for my taste. No one in my house is a mushroom or cooked onion fan, so I leave those out, but the crunchy onions (think green bean casserole) are DELISH sprinkled on top with a dollop of sour cream. Thanks for the 5 star recipe!

Out of the recipes available on this site, this is one of the best. It was way easy to make and had the whole kitchen smelling like heaven. The beef was seasoned from the inside out and was plenty tender. Will be made time and time again here.

This was ok.  Not good, but not yucky, either.  I made it almost exactly following the directions, except that I didn't brown the beef in butter, and I did drain the beef after browning it.  I can't imagine how greasy it would be without those changes.  My husband and I both found this too plain.  I think we'll stick with Slow Cooker Beef Stroganoff I (also from this site).  Thanks anyway.

Good recipe but I had to tweek it because it tasted a bit bland.  I threw in about 1tsp parsely, 1 tsp basil, a bit of oregano, and a dash of red pepper.  My boyfriend and I are spice freaks so this was perfect for us.  Our three year old son loved it.

This was very good with some additions.  I added garlic, chile pepper, and lots of black pepper; otherwise it would have been far too bland.  It would be good with a little Worcestershire sauce or wine as well.  Also, next time I will add a little milk with the sour cream or extra broth to make a little more sauce.

Very good recipe.  I took the previous reviewer's suggestions and added 1/2 cup of beef broth (I used bouillon) and decreased the amount of sour cream.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of chili pepper and used leftover steak tips (yum) instead.  My hubby LOVED it and it had just the right spice (we love spicy).

i substituted in tofu and vegetable stock to make this vegetarian and it was loved by meat/non-meat eaters alike. yummy. i did need a little extra flour to thicken up the sauce since the tofu contains more water than beef. thanks for satisfying a flavor craving from my meat eating days!

This was really good.  I added a dash of white cooking wine to bring out some of the flavor.  I also think that this would be best served over fluffy white rice.  Overall, it was good and I enjoyed it enough to make it again.

This was a great recipe - very quick and easy... perfect for a family who loves homecooking but doesn't have much time for it.  And it was tasty, too.  I think I may use a little more sour cream next time and a little more salt.

I used sirloin steak strips instead of ground beef.  Also added a can of cream of mushroom soup and some red wine to make it a little richer.  Excellent and delicious sauce.

This was super!  I substituted beef stew meat, but otherwise followed the recipe as written and my whole family ate it (except the 1-year old who wore it).  It was easy and I also made biscuits and broccoli to go with it.  My husband won't eat anything without meat, and it was a hit with him.  This is going into the permanent file.

We loved this dish, fought over who got to have the leftovers for lunch the next day. I followed the recipe, but added a pound of mushrooms (I LOVE mushrooms) and added extra sour cream (just because I like that too). Dish was easy and quick to prepare even though I used stew-beef rather than ground beef. Also, I added some flour to the sauce to thicken it a bit and it was perfect. We have it on the menu for dinner again this week.

Not very good at all, but luckly I read the reviews before hand so I adapted as I went along.  I added 2tbsp wochester sauce while cooking beef.  I also added 2 tbsp liquid condensed beef bullion, 3/4 C sour cream, and 1/4 C milk at the final step.  Without the milk it is to thick and there is no sauce.  My fiance liked it, but it looked awful!  Might make again when in a bind, but never for anyone other than my fiance, the looks of the dish were to unappealing.  Will say one thing for it though, was able to make it with things we already had, and it was cheep.

I made a few changes to the basic recipe.  I added worcestershire sauce,combined everything, topped it with bread crumbs and parmesian cheese, baked it in the oven for about 15min.  This was a quick after work dish. Just add a salad and biscuits. Very good.

this is really good as a foundation recipe.. something i am always looking for! it is so great. i added things to suit my taste. but i think that if i wanted a quick meal for just me and my son, i would make it plain as is.. but this time i am making it for my hubby too, and he likes things with "finished" flavors. if anything seems missing he isnt happy with it!! giggles

Good, but only with additions. Used 1 whole small onion, two cloves garlic, no mushrooms. Didn't bother removing onions before adding beef to brown. Drained off some of the fat and didn't use the extra butter before adding the flour. I'd leave out the salt too.

When I added the broth, I also added a few shakes of Worsteshire and, surprisingly, maybe a teaspoon or two of soy sauce. It really made it taste more beefy. Because of the broth and soy, I didn't add any salt and it was fine. Went heavy on the pepper and threw in a dash of thyme. Decent stuff.

This recipe was very easy to make.  My husband and I both found it to be very bland though.  We added worcestershire sauce and it helped a little.  If I make it again I will add garlic and a few other things.

This would be very bland using the listed ingredients only.  I took others advise and added a pinch of this and a pinch of that. (garlic, onion, celery seed, Mrs. Dash, Lawry's instead of salt & a couple T. of sour cream)  It's a good base to take it to your own taste.

This was soooo good!  I don't eat red meat so I made 1lb with ground turkey and chicken broth, and the other 1lb of ground beef for my husband.  My husband really loved this meal and kept saying how good it was which is not usual for him since he is very picky. Looking forward to enjoying the left overs. This is a keeper!

A great, simple recipe.  I liked it a lot and so did my young children. I topped it with fresh green onion right before serving for extra flavor.

I love stroganoff, and when I found this recipe I knew it would be my new favorite. I am not a huge fan of ground beef so I used Filet of Beef and man it was so good. THANK YOU SOOO MUCH for your easy beef stroganoff.

As written I gave it 3 stars. I just didn't have enough flavor. I added a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, a teaspoon of ground black pepper and a teaspoon of onion powder. That made it more savory, but I prefer the boxed version better.

I'm a huge fan of beef stroganoff, but all other recipes have been so complicated and expensive I haven't wanted to try them.  The use of plain old ground beef was what really sold this to me.  As for the taste, I didn't think it was the best stroganoff I'd tasted.  However, the ease of preparation MORE than made up for that.  Finally, my husband absolutely loved it, and he normally doesn't like stroganoff at all.  Note added later:  I now make this at least twice a month.

Reheats easily?! This wasn't an option at my house (we scaled it down to 4 servings).  I made this for a very picky fiance and he is still talkng about it a week later.  I had a problem with the onions and mushrooms, I think my mushrooms were too big and my onions were too small.  Next time I'll let the mushrooms cook a little while (or I'll used canned mushrooms) before I add the onions.  This is an excellent recipe and has been added to our permanent rotation!

I made this for myself the other night, and it was wonderful!  It was the first time 
I attempted to make any type of Beef Stroganoff, and I was very pleased with 
the results.  The next time I have company over, this is going to be the dish I'm
going to make!!

So delicious! My grandmother's recipe called for cream of mushroom soup.. not fresh like this one,  and her's called for  a couple tablespoons of shortening.. .reheating  the next day wasn't always successful. This one is much easier and fresh ingredients. My only complaint would be...there was  only  a small bowl left the next day for leftovers because everyone had seconds and thirds.. ??

The recipe is awesome!  I didn’t have any ground beef on hand but used homemade frozen meatballs which I simmered in the gravy.  Will definitely make again.

Super simple to make and super delicious.  Also, easy to half the recipe when there's only two of you.

When it says season to taste, you're probably going to add a lot of pepper, and maybe salt.  Not bad and easy enough to make.

This is one of our favourite meals. It’s so super easy and DELICIOUS!!!! I add a few shakes of Worchestershire sauce and we like lots of pepper. Sometimes I sub in Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and it turns out just as yummy. Definitely a staple in our house!

Will make again! Very easy, at first my son said he didn’t think he’d like it but ended up having 2 servings. The only thing I will change is next time I don’t think I’ll cook the meat in butter.

I made this for the first time (I had left over london broil instead of ground beef) and replaced butter with EVOO - added garlic and ran with it - it was amazing - will make this again for sure.

Like many others suggested, I added 2 cloves garlic and some Worcestershire, and it was a huge hit!  I particularly enjoy how easy and fast it was, and didn't leave a huge mess with lots of dishes to clean up!

This recipe was a very great basic recipe! The only thing I added was fresh garlic and dry mustard.  The key to this recipe is just using high quality ingredients such as grass-fed beef and sweet onion. It was what I was looking for and it did not disappoint! Also I garnished with fresh parsley

This was a very good recipe. Easy yet tasty. I am gluten free, so I used corn starch instead of flour, and it was very good and thickened nicely.

This was good but I made some changes. I used some tomato paste, about a tablespoon. I reduced the broth by half a cup, and I served it on potatoes. This is a really good recipe, that I would be proud to serve to people.

I made this as the recipe states with no changes except that I added peas. I thought that it needed more flavor. I may also really cut down the butter next time. Overall, it’s a heavy dish and the boys in the house liked it.

It was good as a basic beef stroganoff, not too complicated and tasty.  Instead of the ground beef I used beef fondue meat.  Next time I think I would add a little garlic and some red wine to give it a more full bodied taste.   Also I think portobello mushrooms would give it a little extra oomph.

I doubled the meat on this recipe, then added a can of cream of mushroom and cream of onion soup.  Using the broth, and cream soups made the perfect balance of creaminess.

It made a lot and I usually "share" with my neighbor (shut-in) BUT, this was so good I ate it over a 3-day period!  Of course, she won't be putting on the pounds that I will. :-) 
I was so excited that I had all the ingredients - which made it go smoothly.  I used the Large Egg -no yoke -noodles for the first day and white rice later.  Both were delicious!  Oops!  I forgot to take a picture - it was appetizing with noodles or rice.
Thanks so much for this recipe - it's a keeper.

Made this today for Dinner, using the leftover chuck roast from the previous day...It was absolutely delicious. It taste so much better than the boxed kind (it taste like a cardboard box)... I will be making this again...

It was good and very easy! I had to substitute chicken broth (no beef at home), but I think it didn't detract from the taste. We both enjoyed it.

I made it with a 14.5 oz. can of low sodium beef broth, omitted the flour and used a 10 oz. can of Cream of Mushroom soup, and cooked the onion and mushrooms with some minced garlic as another reviewer had done.  I also added 1 tbsp. of Worstershire sauce to the beef as I was browning it.

just finished making this. followed recipe as it is, but then found it extremely bland..even after adding salt and pepper. I then added Worcestershire sauce, based on other people's reviews. also added a touch of garlic powder. it seemed like I had to add a good amount of Worcestershire sauce to make a difference!  the recipe really does require SOMETHING else.  ended up fairly decent, but not as good as I was hoping.  you would think the sour cream would provide that tang, but it's either not enough, or not the right thing! it IS easy to make, though...

I used gluten free elbow noodles and gluten free flour...still tasted great.  Next time I'll either cut the amount of noodles down or increase the sauce, but I think that is because of the kind of noodles I had to use.  Just wish gluten free egg noodles were easier to find.

I made this according to recipe for the first try. After tasting I did add parsley and garlic, and found it to be pretty good. It's missing something, my next attempt I think I'll add a dash of Maggi sauce and I bet that will fill the slight hole! 

Thank you for the simple, quick recipe. I look forward to playing with it.

I thought this was REALLY GOOD! I used 1 pound of ground cooked steak because I had it leftover.  I should have cut the pieces instead of grind it.  I also used broth from my leftover French Onion Soup recipe because that's all I had.  I also added garlic.  I think it gave it a great flavor. My family really liked it so I was thrilled.

I made it.  It was kinda bland.  I added more beef broth, more butter, onion power, salt, pepper and prob could have used some garlic or cheese of some kind.  I served with some diced raw onion and bread/butter.  You will prob have to doctor it up more too.  Hubby said it was good but he won't complain since he didn't cook unless it was really bad.  It's a good base recipe to start with then add your special touches/flavors to your liking.

This may not qualify as a "real" review of the recipe, since I used it as a way to use up some left-over chuck roast I had.  For the sauce, I used the liquid from the roast, along with one cup of beef bouillon.  Other than that, I prepared the recipe as written, and it was tasty.  I think fresh mushrooms would have been better.

This is a great recipe if you just want to make basic stroganoff that you can adjust easily.  The only thing I didn't like was the ground beef.  It seems like they actually wants you to keep the grease and thicken with flour, but not only is it horrible for you, it's going to make a very bland, greasy dish.  I drained the beef, but didn't compensate for the liquid lost, so it came out thicker.  Next time I will drain and add another cup of broth.

Traditional stroganoff calls for freshly ground nutmeg. ADD A BIT OF NUTMEG and you won't regret it! Nutmeg does have a strong flavor so don't use too much. I never really measure and grate right into the dish at the end and taste to liking. It's probably around half a teaspoon.

This was an AWESOME recipe.  Like the other readers, I tweaked according to taste and what I had on hand.  I sauteed everything in coconut oil(the unflavored/unscented variety) and used up leftovers in the fridge.....leftover steak and leftover rice, and added a couple of shakes of Worchestershire sauce.   What a delicious dinner.  My son loved it, as did I.  Normally he won't touch mushrooms, but he gobbled this up. This one is a keeper for the next time we have uneaten cooked steak we need to use up.  Great job, thanks for the recipe!!!!!!

My husband and I thought this was delicious! I didn't use any butter though. I used about a tablespoon of coconut oil to saute  the mushrooms and onions, then  browned and drained the ground beef before proceeding with the recipe.   I also used only about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added a lot more spices, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, beef broth and eventually brown gravy mix to try to add some flavor. Turned out good, but took a lot of extra stuff that the recipe didn't call for.

OK but a little bland.  I am going to look at the other Beef Stroganoff recipes to see if there is a different spice set.

Followed the recipe exactly.  It was terribly bland.  My husband said "lose the recipe" and I agree.

Was good but bland for my taste. Not sure I will make it again. Gave it 3 stars because it was so easy.

Easy recipe.  I made this without mushrooms  (Hubby doesn't like them!) I used ground beef and added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and fresh parsley  . Very tasty. Will make again.

This was a hit with my entire family, including the kids, and it made enough for two dinners.  I used flat iron steak as recommended in the magazine.  This will definitely be added to our regular rotation.

I made half the recipe as it was for one.  It's still enough for three meals.  It was delicious.   I've always used beef cubes in the past but this was excellent.  And no added salt.  I highly recommend it.

For those that say this is bad because they "did not remember to drain the fat", idiots. Do not listen to them. First of all, fat is flavor. If you are afraid of flavor, do not make this recipe. Second, this is a VERY flavorful recipe that will be welcomed in any household. Do not listen to those that have neither taste or any hint of cooking skills. They need to just buy a can of Tapioca pudding and sit in front of the TV until they go to sleep. Again, GREAT recipe, make it.

I don't know why you need 2 T butter to cook the meat. There is plenty of fat already in the meat, unless it's for flavor?? And 2 T butter to cook the onions and mushrooms is to much to me. So in place of butter, I used a little extra virgin olive oil. You should drain the meat once cooked. And it was bland so I added some Worcestershire sauce.

I had to mess with the sauce a bit. I did add the Lea and parin's sauce and misses dash. And some frozen peas. Only used half the butter. Instead of 1c of sour cream I used half of it with 1/2c of cream of mushroom soup roasted garlic. It was definatly filling tho. Most def making this as a weekly meal.

It's ok. I tasted it after I got all the ingredients incorporated, but it was lacking zing, so I added a splash of white wine, a can of cream of mushroom soup, a tsp of smoked paprika, a half tsp ground allspice. Let it simmer for about 30 min. Hit it with a few more grinds of the pepper grinder, 5 Tbls of sour cream, an a package of prepared frozen peas & carrots. It's DELICIOUS!!!

Family loved this.  Made a couple tweaks:  no salt (beef broth has plenty), used 1.5 onions, added 2 cloves fresh minced garlic and approx. 1 tsp. pepper. to hamburger as it browned.  Didn't have fresh mushrooms - 2 small canned mushrooms (drained) worked just fine.  Would suggest allowing the meat/broth mixture to simmer longer until it is thicker before adding sour cream.

Will make again. I cut the calories a bit by using reduced fat sour cream & not cooking the hamburger in the butter. I also strained the grease from the hamburger. It would be smoother with regular sour cream & I would add a bit of garlic powder or minced garlic browned with the onions & mushrooms. A touch of Worstershire would be a good addition.

You can also make the same recipe substituting the steak for burger .  Chicken  as well just use chick stock  in place of the beef   but......  Make sure you DO NOT BRING SOUR CREAM TO BOIL!!   It causes  the cream to separate    just fold it in gently to blend when  sauce is heated n serve.

I made this for dinner tonight. It was really quick and easy and turned out really well! I used low sodium broth, but then had to add a bunch of salt and pepper. I also added an extra tablespoon or two of flour at the end to thicken the sauce a bit more as my daughter and I prefer a thicker sauce. 
Very good! Definitely recommend! I'll for sure be making this again soon!!

Good! Will make again. Some members of my family have a mushroom phobia so omitted the mushrooms but added blended cream of mushroom soup along with the sour cream for flavor. My son will pick out the tiny mushrooms in the cream soup so I bypass that irritation by blending it. I added fresh garlic too which was great!

Made some personal changes for ease and my own taste. Used 1 package precut onions/used baby Bella's chopped very small (boyfriend doesn't like the texture of Shrooms) sautéed with the lean hamburger meat. Added salt/pepper, sage, and thyme while browning. After draining...added 5 tablespoons of flour mixed well. Then  red wine (not measured) and 2.5 cups beef broth. Cook till thickened and add sour cream.

Excellent ratios of butter, flour, and broth to make a perfect gravy!  I made the following changes, which added a lot of depth to the flavors:
--  Saute onion and mushrooms with butter, salt, and pepper until browning bottom of pan, add one cup of red wine.  Reduce on med-high heat.  When almost all the way reduced, add two teaspoons minced fresh rosemary and one teaspoon minced fresh jalepeno.  Remove from pan when starting to brown and stick to bottom.
-- I used thinly sliced sirloin instead of ground beef.  Tends to be leaner, and I think it's a little more flavorful.
-- I only add the sour cream after the sauce has been removed from the heat for 2-5 minutes, so the cream doesn't separate.

MMMMMMMMmmmmMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!

My rating is for the original recipe prepared with the suggestions in Allrecipes magazine: I used 2 lbs of flank steak sliced thin against the grain and added a 1/3 cup of white wine to the broth (I recommend Better Than Boullion). A fairly quick and decidedly decadent weeknight dinner that my whole family enjoyed.

Very Good, Kids loved it.  Followed suggestions added 3 cloves of minced garlic to the onion, mushroom mixture which I sauteed in a little bit of olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper.  Drained beef and used juices (not the fat) with the beef broth.  Also added 2 Tbsp of worchestire sauce.  Added 1/2 sour cream and cooked for 15-20 minutes and added the remainder sour cream before serving.

This is always an appreciated meal at our house!  I use the same ingredients, but use a little more (lite) sour cream and cut out the butter for browning the ground beef.  Sometimes I add 1/2 cup frozen peas right at the end, for color.

It was an easy recipe to follow. It is a little on the bland side...so I added seasoning salt & garlic to taste to the meat itself while cooking. Steamed broccoli on the side. The family loved it. I will be making this dish again.

I like it but changed a few things in it.  Added rib eye instead of hamburger. It made a big difference in taste.  Sauted 1 onion in the juice of the ribeye mixed with butter and the mushrooms too.

Drain the beef.  You don't need the extra liquid. Other than that, fantastic.

Have  been making a version of this for years.  I use stew meat , add red wine and put it in the crock pot.  Cook on low 4-5 hours.  Can add your sour cream when done.

Been looking for a healthier stroganoff recipe that doesn't use condensed soup and this one is delicious! DH said how good he thought it was too. Used coconut oil instead of butter, fat-free sour cream and Gardein beef tips to make it meatless. Definitely worth adding to the menu rotation.

I would actually give this 4.5 stars.  Kids are it which is a huge plus.  This might be the first time my daughter has eaten red meat and she's 7.  Husband liked it too. I thought it needed a little more seasoning.

My family really enjoyed this recipe and I found it fast and easy to make. The only change I made was I also seasoned the ground beef while browning it.  I added Vegeta, red pepper flakes, granulated garlic and ground course black pepper.  It was delicious!

Very simple solution to a quick and delicious meal. I did add 1 tablespoon of garlic ( personal preference) and I used baby bella mushrooms ( a little bit more of a earthy bite) .  I used the recipe as a guide line, I tend to use a little more/ or less of something depending on the amount of servings I'm planning. Will definitely make this again.

Great, easy-to-make recipe! I had never made beef stroganoff from scratch, and found this recipe and decided to give it a shot. We LOVED it! Definitely making this again. I did add a few things. I sauteed the onion and mushroom in vegetable oil, and then added in the beef and remaining ingredients. I seasoned the beef with hamburger seasoning (for grilling, so minimally), garlic seasoning, and salt and pepper. It was not bland at ALL. Delicious!!

Ok, I want to start out by saying WOW!!! What a delicious Stroganoff recipe. I am a beginner cook who is trying to move away from boxed dinners for health reasons. This was a perfect alternative to unhealthy hamburger helper. Made this for me and my boyfriend for dinner and by just the smell alone I couldnt keep him out of the pot! I will comment that this takes about an hour to make including prep, as aposed to the suggested 30mins, but well worth the wait. Ive read several stroganoff recipies and I made the following modidications:
-1LB ground beef
-Cooked beef, onions, and fresh mushrooms all together first then drained fat from the pan
- Added all other ingredients after beef was browned and also added 3 beef bouillon cubes, 1/2 TSP of Dijon mustard, 1/2 TSP salt, 1TBSP of minced garlic from the jar.
- Cooked on low heat 20min until bouillon cubes dissolved.
- Added 1/2 cup sour cream towards the end.
The sauce was thick, meaty, and absolutely divine over whole wheat rotiniti noodles. Mmmmmmmmm!

I followed the recipe except I did add one clove of fresh minced garlic with the onions and mushrooms.  This recipe was a hit at my house. Even my 3 year old ate seconds. I disagree with the ratings saying there isn't enough flavor. The flavor was VERY good.

I like is that this recipe is from scratch with real ingredients and not flavored, processed, gmo-artificial soups can ingredients.
 I used fresh portobello mushrooms, and just about doubled them in the recipe.  I added salt and pepper to taste, and also additional garlic and onion powder to taste.  My family enjoyed it.

This was a great, comforting meal. Gabriel even liked it. I did not use any butter. I cooked the onion and canned mushrooms with the ground beef, and then removed the grease. I whisked the flour into the beef broth, then added it to the beef mixture. Lastly, I added the sour cream. Next time I will add salt and more pepper (I added about 22 cranks while cooking). Alternatively, I may add more beef bouillon while keeping the water to 2 cups to add more beef flavor.

It had absolutely no flavor at all. I refused to waste all this food, so I drowned it with salt and garlic powder. It was then, ok. I added some paprika too it and I could finally say it was good. Not great, but still pretty good. I defiantly recommend adding extra salt and pepper, garlic powder and paprika to give it that kick it is definatly missing. The good thing about this recipe is it's very easy, but it defiantly lacks flavor and you need to give it some extra love.

This was an excellent base recipe!  I did add a lot of my own spices but it still came out a wee bit bland.  Next time I will be trying some of the suggested tweaks in other reviews, such as adding wine.  This will be my "Go To" base recipe for this though!  One of my fav meals :)

I think I am incapable of "following" a recipe...I used Gluten Free pasta, GF flour, and I didn't measure the flour, broth, butter, ground turkey, or mushrooms. Still pretty good. Guess its just one of those things thats hard to mess up!

It as fast and easy. I did omit the mushrooms (due to allergies)and added 4 HUGE cloves of galic and some worcestershire sauce per other reviewers.  Hubby wants it for dinner again this week.

This is so yummy! I thought I had beef broth at home but didn't so I sub'd in chicken bouillon (mixed with water) and added a little sherry wine ;) Kids loved it too and that is the ultimate test! Thank you so much for sharing!

I hate to say something bad, but my husband and I really were disappointed with the recipe. It was tasteless to the point that it seemed like we just had bowls of beef and noodles. Very bland. I would liken it to very poor Hamburger Helper. I won't be making this recipe again.

Easy and good tasting.  Kids loved it so that's a huge plus.  I prefer more traditional Beef Stroganoff so only 4 stars...tasted like hamburger helper to me.

I made the recipe exactly as it was written. It wasn't thick or flavorful enough so I just added a small can of beef gravy. Now it's excellent!

I just tried this...followed the directions and ingredients exactly as provided .....and was extremely disappointed in the unfavorable results. Even my 11 year old son complained about how there was no taste. Such a waste of time and good ingredients.  I've tried many recipes from this site and have most usually  enjoyed the dish, this is the first time I have ever rated or commented on any, I'm sorry this is unfavorable

This was a great meal, followed directions  but eliminated the mushrooms (not a favorite for us). It was easy and quick to prepare. Will definitely make it again.

Very good recipe. I tweaked it by halving the recipe, adding a splash of red wine to the beef stock, added garlic powder while cooking the beef, and adding a cup of frozen peas at the end. I browned my ground beef and set that aside and made the mistake of melting butter and beginning my roux instead of sauteing the onions. But it didn't matter. I just turned down the heat a bit and cooked the onions while the flour and butter mixture was cooking. Hubby and kids said it was good! I think for next time, however, I'll double the sauce (use original recipe amounts) but continue to keep the one pound of ground beef. Definitely a keeper!

Hi! I know people hate it when you review a recipe and then add your own comments but since I am weight conscious I always look at these for ways to make them lighter. This is a great base recipe very similar to the one I use but here is how I change it: I use lean ground turkey rather than beef, I use mostly 2% milk instead of the sour cream, adding in only a T or two of nonfat sour cream at the end. For the veggies I use shallots as opposed to onions and a little garlic. I saute meat, onions, garlic together in a T or two of olive oil and a little pat of butter -- not much. I add in some worchestershire sauce and reduced sugar ketchup at the very end to taste. A tiny pinch paprika as well. As a timesaving tip, I saute the meat and all veggies in large saucepan first as already described and then add water/milk (as much as seems needed) and noodles next. Cover, let simmer until noodles are done, then add W sauce, ketchup and sour cream at the very last. My very picky kids eat this and it's much healthier and lighter this way. And it's good. I never feel deprived. Ladle it over a little lettuce (the crunch is a surprisingly good addition) and you've got yourself a very diet friendly meal.

If you want to lighten it up use fat-free sour cream.  I have also made a similar light version using fat free beef gravy, making meatballs with ground turkey, and Yolk-free noodles.  Still tastes rich and creamy.

I've used this recipe for years although I don't cook the beef in all that butter, I prefer to just brown it in a hot dry skillet. I mostly use about an 80/20 mix of lean beef and ground pork which adds to the flavor. Then I drain the impurities and deglaze the pan with some chicken stock (adds more layers of flavor) and start building the sauce from there. First I add a generous amount of stock, a little bit of organic vegetable bouillon mix and reduce by at least half, seasoning to taste with salt and fresh ground black pepper until I have a very flavorful base.  Then I thicken by toasting the flour and mixing it into a cup of cold water or stock to avoid clumping before stirring it into the sauce and heating to just below boiling. At that point I add the mushrooms and onions (no garlic!) which I sauteed previously separately so as to be able to give the mushrooms the space they need and get good color on them. Sour cream goes in last. (I never use lite.) I often serve over boiled seasoned potatoes instead of egg noodles although the noodles are great too. At the end I top with chopped chives for color and presentation.  This is how my grandmother taught me. I've always loved this recipe. It's great comfort food.

I like this recipe, although I have made some changes. I added garlic and a tablespoon of Dijon Mustard to the recipe. It was great. I also used sirloin that I diced and it came out wonderfully. I also thicken it with a bit of cornstarch and water. It comes out very tasty.

Wow! Delicious  This was the first time I made this and it was absolutely fabulous!  I will be making this again.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned ones and I really enjoyed this.  I added salt and pepper to the end and salted the noodles.  

Thanks Colleen

I chose this recipe for convenience of time.  I found the recipe bland, but with a kick from the cook, It turned out good!  I added a few of my own favorite salts, onion, garlic, and of course the reg salt.  I am a salt lover so I added the salt to the mushrooms and onions, I love to cook these two on a lower than med. heat.  I am a slow cooker. I used 1 Vadellia Onion.  The aroma is cuisine!  I will use the recipe again. Next time I also will add a little bit more thickner!

This was really bland as written.  I had to add two extra beef bouillon cubes, some garlic powder, paprika, a couple teaspoons of wine vinegar (didn't have any wine on hand) and plenty of salt and pepper just to make it palatable.  Also I didn't care for the texture of ground beef in this recipe. I will look for a tastier beef stroganoff recipe.

It was good, very good. I would make one change though and that is to increase the broth by half a cup, it just wasn't creamy enough for my taste. Otherwise, tasty and very easy.

This was delicious and quick! ...with a couple adjustments. I had some fresh thyme so I chopped about 2 teaspoons and tossed it in with 1 1/2 teaspoons chopped garlic, and a few shakes of worcestershire sauce. It didn't need any additional salt or pepper.

yummy! Just what I was looking for.  Followed the suggestions and added garlic powder with the onion and mushrooms; and Worcestershire sauce and a little ketchup with the beef broth and sour cream. (I always eat my stroganoff on rice).

Ok. So I didn't have 1/2 the ingredients on this list (I seriously need to go shopping), but I used this to make the best out of what I had on hand. I think I probably only had the onions, flour, sour cream and salt and pepper (although I didn't use the pepper).  THANK YOU!  LOL.  I did have some ground turkey that I needed to cook.  I used vegetable oil instead of butter, chicken stock instead of beef, and organic penne pasta instead of egg noodles.  Really, really need to go shopping.  ;)

Sauteed half an onion (chopped) and three garlic cloves (minced) in vegetable oil, then added 1/2 lb of the ground turkey (the other 1/2 became a turkey meatloaf).  While the turkey was browning, I mixed 2 tbsp flour with 1/2 c sour cream.  I then added that along with the chicken stock (about 1 1/2 c) to the browned turkey.  I'm trying to watch my salt so I used mostly Mrs. Dash, a little sea salt, some garlic powder, and paprika.  I let it simmer til the flour cooked off and it was slightly thickened (about 5 min).  Added the cooked pasta (cooked for 2 minutes less than package instructions) and let it sit for another 5 minutes.  It turned out really tasty!  I've been looking for an easy recipe.  Thanks so much!  It actually inspired me to join allrecipes and write a first review.  I'll  be looking for more yummy recipes.

Good quick recipe. My kids liked it even with mushrooms. I added a 1/4 cup of dry sherry with the broth to give it a boost of flavor. Sauce was a little too thick for my taste so I added about a 1/2 cup extra broth.

I double the recipe and found it was a bit to creamy which my family didn't like.  Next time will cut back on the cream to keep some of the beefy flavor!

No offense, but I wasn't really impressed.  The taste was okay, but not really flavorful.  It was an easy recipe, but lacked something.  I may play with this one a bit to try to find out how to give it a little pizzazz!  If I can't find a solution, I'll just stick with my pressure cooker stroganoff recipe.

Very good, I added about a teaspoon of prepared horseradish to give it a little more depth of flavor. Fast and easy will make again.

Ok. I've been reading the reviews on this one, and I've done this particular recipe before. I know that if you're working with ground beef, no matter how lean it is, you're still going to end up with a bunch of gross looking oily fat from the meat. So, with that in mind, if you cook the beef first, and drain it, then add the melted butter, it'll come out much better then before. And if you're not too fond of mushrooms, you can always mince them instead of slicing them. Plus they cook a lot better and faster if minced instead of sliced.

My husband loves beef of any kind.  We found this recipe very simple and very delicious just the way it is.  I did make a change however.  I had made some green onion chip dip and used the fat free sour cream.  The dip is horrible with fat free sour cream.  However it was very good in the stroganoff.  Not something I would do everytime I make this but did give it a little twist.  Because of all the other flavorful ingredients, the fat free sour cream is a good way to make this meal more health friendly and not even know your using fat free.  Experiment all you want!  You may find something that is off the wall.

The recipe was okay, but lacked flavor.  I didn't  stick with the recipe entirely, but went off of some other comments and sauteed the mushrooms and only 1/2 onion in garlic and white wine.  I'm glad I only used 1/2 onion because there was a lot, but I'm not a huge onion fan anyway.  The consistency was good, but all of the flavor was in the mushrooms, until I heated it up for lunch the next day, and it had dispersed a little more.  I believe if I do make this again, I'll do a little worcestershire sauce and maybe steal from another recipe and use cream cheese, but hubby wasn't a fan at all, so there might not be a second time.

I just got done eating this with My hubby and I.  I read a couple of the reviews and decided to add a splash of cooking wine to the onions and mushrooms as they were cooking to give them more flavor. However, when it came to making the sauce I was confused about draining the meat juice and butter? or was to leave in, then add the broth? I left it in and it was very oily. not doing that again! Also, in the end it was very bland so I add another splash of cooking wine to the sauce. it tasted good but reminded me of my shrimp scampy sauce.. (just with flour and beef). Good but most likely wont make it again!

Like other reviewers, I found this to be lacking that special "something" in the flavor. It is a decent base recipe which can be used as a starting point, and with some alterations / additions could become a very good stroganoff. I noticed some reviewers added worcestershire sauce; I probably should have done that. I was hoping to recreate a wonderful beef stroganoff that I had in Germany, which had a good depth of flavor and slight tang. My search continues.

Eh.  I made this mostly according to the recipe (doubled amount of mushrooms, added a little worcestershire), and it was just okay.  Certainly edible and filling enough, but very bland.  Tastes like Hamburger Helper.

I used stew meat. The next time I make this I WILL have to tenderize any cheaper cuts of meat that I use. It came out good and kinda eyed everything when it came to adding the ingredients making it my own. My boyfriend liked it and I will defiantly make this again.

Good basic recipe for stroganoff....it was sort of bland though.  I added some celery salt and it ramped it up with some taste.

I added Worcestershire sauce (1 TBS), garlic (4 crushed cloves), some paprika and it was still lacking something. A sprinkle of grated cheddar over the top seemed to redeem the dish.

This was really good. I used leftover pot roast instead of ground beef and I left out the mushrooms since my husband won't eat them. I followed the recipe with everything else and it tasted great. My husband even told me it was better than his moms which is always nice to hear!

I love this recipe!  Easy, cheap and absolutely divine results.  I always make 1.5x the recipe so there is a good amount of leftovers - it's just as good the next day for lunch.

I followed the recipe, but it did need something. I topped it with French's fried onions and it gave it that something that was missing. Very tasty.

Super easy recipe. I used stew beef and Soy Sour Cream, because I can't eat dairy. I recommend adding more spice to the mixture, such as dijon mustard, paprika, and garlic.

Great stroganoff recipe! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 cup of cream of mushroom and 1/2 cup of sour cream instead of the full cup of sour cream.  I also added paprika and some garlic, and left out the mushrooms.  Other than those changes, I followed the recipe exactly and it was just what I was looking for! My boyfriend and I both loved it and we finished it quickly! I also scaled the recipe in half for the two of us, and no additional changes were needed to accommodate that.

This recipe is very good. I added a pinch of cheddar cheese (just a hint of cheese flavor not enough to over power). I also added peas. DH loved and I loved it!

I use strips of a cheap round cut steak instead of ground beef, and sub 1/4 of the water with a Cabernet, and mix in some flour with the water and Cabernet before adding in to thicken it up.  it turns out great!

Very good . . . except that there was approximately 2X as much sauce as necessary.  Next time, I will either double the noodles or halve the sauce.

Great recipe.  I should have checked how many it served before cooking as I have enough for 4 more people.  I did add garlic as another cook suggested, also a little hot sauce.  Will make this again.

My boyfriend told me this recipe is a childhood classic for him. I've never made this before. Different culture and I really loved it. I used some hints from other reviews like, paprika, cream cheese, worcestershire sauce, salt or "adobo". YUMMY even though it doesn't look good.

I normally make my mom's beef stroganoff recipe that bakes for 3 hours and calls for round steak instead of ground beef but I wanted something quick the other night so I made this.  It was wonderful!!!!  Great for week night!

The name says it all.  This recipe is so easy and is soooo good.  My hubby loves Stroganoff night and next day lunch leftovers, and dinner leftovers.  I always keep the things to make it for unexpected guest or a day you need comfort food.  One of our favorite meals!

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I added 1/2 cream of mushroom and 1/2 sour cream instead of just sour cream. I would have given it a five if it had more flavor, but I found it rather bland, next time I will add more seasoning and some garlic. It is very quick and very filling, a great recipe to use when you're in a hurry or on a weeknight. Thanks for sharing!

Yum! I used only 1 lb of ground beef, half an onion and one can of campbel's beef broth, no water. It turned out great, I kept most of the onion mushroom mixture on the side since the rest of my family isn't too crazy about them. I just added a spoonful on top of my plate. Oh and I used minced garlic in with the meat cooking and the veggie cooking. Love it, putting it on my perma-list for dinners!

Good solid, simple recipe for easy beef stroganoff.  I sub sliced beef for ground beef if I have it, and it works very well.  I like serving it over rice.

great recipe! i added 1T of worcestershire sauce, two cloves of garlic, and used thinly sliced tri tip beef instead of ground.  also used half fat sour cream -- it loses some of that oh-my-god amazingness, but i was worried full sour cream might be overwhelming in the richness department. overall awesome!

This was delicious!  I added Worcstershire (sp) sauce and garlic to the meat when I was cooking it, and the second time I made it, I added cream of mushroom soup instead of mushrooms.  The first time, I used egg noodles, but the second time, I used whole grain penne pasta because my family wasn't too fond of the egg noodles.

Loved this recipe.  I added paprika and garlic as suggested. To make it healthier, I used whole wheat egg noodles, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and cooking spray instead of oil.

This turned out pretty well. Reading through the ingredients, I thought it sounded a tad bland. To fix this, I added a clove of garlic (chopped) to the meat while it was browning. When I added the beef broth, I also splashed in about a 1/4 cup of white wine. This gave it a nice boost in flavor. I was out of egg noodles, so I served it over white rice. Tasty and filling, thank you!

Nice easy meal, but I do have to agree it is a little bland as is.  But with a bit of spices to suit your taste it is nice comfort food.  I threw in a bit of salt, pepper, garlic salt, and a dollop of cream cheese.  Nice meal on a chilly night!!

Very easy and satisfying recipe but I could only give it a 4 out of 5 star rating due to the catastrophic caloric damage this meal does to your diet.  If you are not watching your waistline dig in (be sure to add fresh garlic). Otherwise, for the love of God, step away from this recipe!  I know I'm ruined from it -- off to find a healthier version of on the web.

I made this last night and it was really good.  I used another reviewers suggestion and used a can of beef consumme instead of beef stock.....so delicious.  I also added garlic to the onion mixture and used sirloin instead of ground beef.  To make it easy, I had the butcher slice it for me!!

I cut this recipe in half for my husband and I and we still have more than enough. I also leave out the mushrooms and sometimes the onion for my husband and it still tastes pretty good. Quick and easy.

Not a bad recipe, especially when you need to make something fast. I thought it needed some changes though, I added Worcestershire sauce to the browned meat. Also when I browned the meat I sprinkled it with salt, pepper, garlic powder and paprika. After it was done cooking, I thought it still needed something, so I added a packet of no-sodium beef bouillion. I thought it was pretty good. I will make it again.

Very easy basic recipe. I season my ground beef with salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes when browning the meat. I use corn starch to thicken the sauce rather than flour so it isn't chalky. I also add minced garlic to saute with the veggies. Lastly, I add 1/2 can cream of mushroom soup to thicken it.

Very good recipe. It was simple and yummy. Instead of using all onions, I halved the onions and added some garlic. My family loves garlic. So simple for a quick weeknight dinner.

Made a few changes due to lack of ingredients.  Used dry onion soup mixed with 2 cups of water intead of beef broth and fresh onion.  Didn't have mushrooms, so left them out.  Overall, however, the recipe was pretty good.

So I am NOT a fan of mushrooms. I won't touch a dish that has mushrooms in it. I never made beef stroganoff because I didn't think it would taste good if I left the mushrooms out. However, this recipe looked easy enough and thought I'd give it a try. I followed it, except for leaving out the mushrooms. I am pleased to say that it was delicious! I served it over the noodles, which I added some butter too. My husband got home a few hours after I made it & he said he re-heated well. I have plenty of leftovers for lunch today...yummy! Thanks for the great recipe...this one is a keeper for sure!

Ok, my family and I loved this. Instead of just onions, I used a frozen Mirepoix veggie mix (onion, celery and carrot), and otherwise I followed directions exactly, and it was really great! My middle son loves (and I mean LOVES) mushrooms, so anything like that will be a hit. :) Thank you!
2.5 years later, a few more tweaks. . .I add 2 cloves of garlic, use olive oil instead of butter, and usually use this frozen veggie mix with 3 color bell peppers and onion. Makes it a bit healthier, with all those colors, and still very yummy! I just say "Ahhhh. . .Mmmmmmm. . ." every time. :D Thank you! Still 5 stars. . .:D

I used the ingredients as written, but reversed the order just a bit to cut down more on prep time.  I started with the meat browning, and at the same time prepped the onions and mushrooms.  Removed the meat from the pan to drain, cooked the veggies, then went on from there.  It was a good, warm and filling meal that was fast and easy to make, however I do agree with some other posters that it is not incredibly flavorful--if you are used to more spicey food.  Adding garlic and some fresh herbs would round it out nicely.
Overall, I would make this again, with just some seasoning modifications.

Very easy to make and tasted great.  I agree with a few other reviews that it was a little bland, but after I served it, I added a bit of hot sauce to my own plate and it made it even more delicious!

I used ground turkey and chicken broth instead of beef and the recipe turned out great!  Like other users suggested, I added in cream cheese along with the sour cream and I opted to omit the wine altogether. I will definately use this recipe again and again!

I made this just as the recipe is written and found it quite bland. I added tyme and Worcestershire and that helped quite a bit.  I used the leanest ground beef I could buy since the recipe calls for it being browned in butter and not drained. Still, I thought it was very greasy and missing "something".  I ate it, but I think I'll try other stroganoff recipes before revisiting this one.

This recipe is great for families with kids. The kids love it and it is easy to prepare. We use ground turkey and light sour cream.

This was very good.  I actually followed the recipe changes that colleen posted in her review and it came out great!  Hubby says it's the best stroganoff he's ever tasted.  I gave it 4 stars only because I felt it could use a tiny bit more flavor.  I made some changes also, I sliced some beef in thin strips fajita style, I then  added salt/pepper/garlic powder and a little red wine to the beef, dredged it in flour and then browned it.  Put the beef on a plate then sauted onions, and garlic in 2 tablespoons butter.  I then added the beef to the mix and put in 1 and 3/4 cup beef broth and 1/4 cup red wine, 1 cup sour cream and instead of the second cup of sour cream at the end I added 1 can cream of mushroom soup. Let it cook for 20 minutes and that was almost too long, the beef was a little tough. It came out a little runny for my taste so I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons flour and that did the trick.  I will be using this recipe again for sure!

This was a great recipe!  A few changes:  I seasoned the onion and mushroom with garlic salt and black pepper as they cooked and did not remove them to cook the hamburger.    I did as others suggested and added 2T of Worcestershire Sauce and 2 large minced cloves of garlic as I cooked the beef, mushroom and onion.  One thing I thought was strange is that it didn't say to drain the beef mixture?!  Well, I did any way...  I used cornstarch instead of the flour and whisked it into the broth prior to adding to the beef mixture.  I will make this again as a regular meal in our home!

I cooked this for my partner last night and it seemed to go down alright. I thought the sour cream was a little bit over powering so i may use less next time and i also added worstichere sauce with the beef stock and garlic with the onions and mushrooms. Other than the sour cream this was an excelent and easy to prepare meal

My  family asks for this every week!  Definitely a hit.  I do add worcestershire sauce to the sauce, and I also saute fresh  garlic while sauting the mushrooms and onions.  It is so good............making my mouth water right now just thinking about it!

This was a great base but needed some "umf". I'm not into measuring, but I added a heaping teaspoon of chopped garlic with the onions and mushrooms, a can of mushroom soup, a sprinkle of dried oregano, and a couple of "glugs" of chardonnay (probably 1/2 cup). On the beef broth, I used a cube of bouillon but only dissolved it in 1/2 cup water. I didn't have flour so I used a couple of teaspoons of corn starch. It is really YUMMY.

This is a good and easy weeknight dinner.  I do add a bit of garlic and I also use less of the noodles.  If not it tends to be dry and all you can taste is the noodles.

This was okay. I added a little ketchup during the cooking, prior to the sour cream.  My mom's stroganoff is awesome, and she always adds tomato paste.  Maybe I'll just stick to her recipe! This isn't bad, though.

My whole family loved this, but it needed something added to give it a better meaty flavor, the sauce was a little plain.  I like it with a little hot sauce myself.

This was very easy to prepare.  I cooked the ground beef, onions, and mushrooms together at the same time, drained the fat, added the butter, then continued on with the recipe as normal.  The taste was fine, but I like my stroganoff more saucy then this.  I will probably only use 1 lb of ground beef next time. If it is still not saucy enough, I will double up on the flour, butter, beef broth, and sour cream.  All in all very easy to make.  I think with the changes I suggested it will be even better next time.

This recipe was pretty good.  I did add 3 cloves of garlic minced, a teaspoon of thyme and about 1/3 cup of red wine.  It gave the dish a deeper flavor.  There were no leftovers!

I used 1-1/2 pounds of beef stew meat instead of ground beef.  I also used canned mushrooms instead of fresh.  I thought this recipe was pretty good.  Next time I will add more black pepper and a little more salt for some extra kick.

I never give bad reviews, but this was BLAND.  My hubby is allergic to mushrooms so I omitted them and added some whorchestire sauce and paprika for more flavor and it was still incredibly blah.  Will not make again.

I hate to give a bad review, but we just did not like this at all. This recipe may have possibilites if the suggestions of others were followed, I made recipe  as directed with no changes. It was pretty tasteless.

well I made this the other night.  I thought it was well...stroganoff!  I did use all the suggestions. I added 1/2 cream of mushroom, 1/2 sour cream, added worstechire sauce and soy sauce.  It was very good.  Lots of left over sauce.   Will heat up and pour over white rice.  Yumm

Really good basic recipe. I tweaked it with some worcestershire sauce and black pepper, and used steak tips. Good stuff, even great as leftovers.

My 11 year old son made this for dinner and we loved it! He souped up the ground beef with some extra seasoning while he browned it and all the kids had seconds despite claiming to hate mushrooms and onions!

Good recipe.  Favor was dull after I added the Sour Cream, so next time I might try less Sour Cream.  I also used Steak instead of Ground Beef and added a few things people suggested such as garlic, pepper, Worc sauce.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I tried this recipe and was very satisfied with the outcome. I already had most of the ingredients so I didn't have to do alot of shopping, and it only took about 30 minutes to make.

YUM YUM! This recipe is great. I cooked the hamburger meat with some garlic and onion to help out the flavor. My boyfriend & I loved it! It tastes so much better than the boxed kind and takes the same amount of time to make! I did cut the recipe in half though, and it still made plenty!

The ground beef was slighly bland as was the dish as a whole.  Next time, I'll go back to my tried and true recipe using pre-cooked pot roast in gravy and sour cream.

Pretty good.  I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of cream cheese for a richer sauce. I found it a little soupy but maybe next time I'll use a bit more flour.  My husband loved this!

I work in a diner and used this recipe for one of my week-day specials.  It was a big hit.  I served brown gravy over it to make it a bit more saucey.  I plan to make it a once a week special.

This was great, but a bit bland.  I added some extra sour cream, and next time I will have to add some spices.  My husband LOVED it and I will definitly make it again.

Very Good!  Very Easy!  I added more sourcream than it asked for and I had some marsalla wine and added a couple tablespoons of it to the mixture while it was cooking.  This is not a dish to make for company, but it was a great recipe for just my husband I for a Sunday evening dinner.  I also had leftovers which we froze and ate again a few weeks later. Try it, you'll like it!

I am re reviewing this after making it again. This time I followed the directions and found the results much more agreeable. I scaled it down to enough for four people no problem. My only change was to mix the beef broth and flour in a bowl before adding, seasing with garlic salt and tossing in a little worchestire. This went over well.

This recipe was quick and easy.  Difinitely needed additional spices.  I added garlic and a few peppers, along with dropping to 1/2 the butter.

This was great just needs more spices.  One to try, Montreal's steak seasoning, worked great.  Also added more but can't remember.  Also needed more sour cream but very good recipie all in all.

Very easy to make, I added some 1/2 a garlic clove to my onions and some additional seasonings to the beef and it turned out wonderful. Very flavorful and hearty! :)

This was easy and pretty good, but not great. I found it kind of blah, even with additions of worcestershire sauce, garlic, & black pepper. Boyfriend loved it though.

I'd been craving beef strogaoff for a while, and was tired of the Hamburger Helper version...this recipe really satisfied my cravings :)  Very good...I added lots of garlic and used canned mushrooms instead of fresh. I also used a little more sour cream than was called for. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really really great. I took some of the previous advice. I added garlic while sauteing the mushrooms AND while browning the beef. You can never get enough garlic. I also used a little seasoning salt while browning the beef.  I used sirloin strip that was delicious. I added a touch of red wine that really made a difference. I am currently living in Europe where Cremé Fraiche is more common than sour cream. It worked wonderfully with this recipe. My boyfriend loved it and gobbled it up. 

Thanks so much Colleen. I was having a real craving and this was perfect.

This was wonderful! It was easy to make with things that I had in the freezer and pantry and was just what I had in mind for a blustery fall day when I got home late from work. I used 2 cans of mushrooms instead of the fresh, half the butter, and added garlic granules with the salt. I will definitely be making this again.

My husband loved this (and isn't that what's most important?) and so did I. I thought it was nice and mild, certainly very easy! I added another spoonful of sour cream to my bowl, but my husband thought that the flavor was perfect without any more sour cream.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef because it's less expensive and tastes great (not overly beefy). Other than that, I followed the recipe as is (except for cutting it in half). I was surprised how quick and easy it was.  So much better than Hamburger Helper!

Great!  I have been looking for a quick and easy stroganoff that didn't call for a cream soup (I don't really like them).  This recipe was perfect.  I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe was delicious!! Just as good as some more elaborate stroganoff recipes I've made, and twice as fast.  My boyfriend said he could eat this dish 2-3 times a week.  I did add a splash of red wine.
