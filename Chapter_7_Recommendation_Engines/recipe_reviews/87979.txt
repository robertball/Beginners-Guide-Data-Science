I disagree with the other reviewers about the lemon juice.  The lemon juice is necessary not only to prevent browing, but also to prevent the cell walls of the peaches from breaking down when cooking.  The peaches will have much better identity and structure if you add the lemon or lime jiuce.  I placed a colander in a work bowl and added the peaches.  Then I poured lime juice over the peaches and gently tossed the fruit.  This way, the excess lime juice fell to the bottom.  I then tossed the drained peaches with the dry mixture in another bowl.  The pie was perfect and the peaches were firm and not mushy.    It also removed any juices that would have made the pie runny.  The lime jiuce blends much better with the peach flavor.

This is the most delicious peach pie recipe out there, but the trick to push it over the top is to make a homemade pie crust.  Never, ever use store bought!  It will only add a few more minutes to your prep time, and it's SO worth it (search Mom's Pie Crust for a simple, old-fashioned recipe).  I also sometimes make this pie with 3 C peaches, 2 C blueberries, but you can really make it with any fruit combination.  Just make sure to adjust the sugar accordingly if you use something sour. It's a winner, and if you decorate it with a nice lattice top homemade crust, people will beg at your feet for more of this pie.

The reviews and comments were very helpful.  I changed this recipe quite a bit because of what I read in this recipe and a few others- it came out delicious!  I used half the amount of lemon juice and added 1/4 tsp vanilla and tossed the peaches in a coriander letting them drain as others suggested.  I omitted the nutmeg and instead used ginger.  I also used a pinch more cinnamon.  I used half what it called for white sugar and instead substituted that with brown sugar.  I also did the same with the flour - I only used 1/2 what the recipe called for and instead substituted the other 1/2 with cornstarch.  I egg washed the crust and sprinkled with sugar in the raw.  The pie came out delicious.  It was messy to eat while still warm, but my husband had a slice this morning (yes, this morning) out of the refrigerater and it was perfect.  Oh...I also followed the tip for turning off the oven and leaving the pie in for another 10 minutes.

Kudos to the smart cook that suggested dousing the sliced peaches in lime juice in a colander to avoid runny pie.  This pie was fantastic.  I served it just warm with vanilla icecream and my husband's entire family was raving about it.  Oh, and if you haven't used the buttery flaky pie crust recipe from this site, you are totally missing out.

I give this 4 stars.  Don't get me wrong it's a good recipe, but I work at a bakery and we pretty much use the same recipe.  I would suggest adding 2Tbsp of cornstarch and use only 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  When it says to brush with egg, only use the egg whites not the yolk.  We don't brush the bottom crust, we just poor filling directly in add top shell, brush W/egg wash and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mix.  Bake as 45 min on bottom rack at 350, if top crust is not brown and golden, bake until it is.  After finished baking,take out of oven, let it COMPLETELY cool, cover and   Let stand at room temp over night. cut the next day. you will have perfect beautiful slices and it will taste awesome too!!

Tastes great, easy recipe to follow.  I used a homemade crust and the pie looked beautiful.  I had to cook the pie 10 minutes longer than the recipe.  My pie was a little runny, but I think that I should have drained my fresh peaches before mixing in the flour (some liquid left in the bottom of the bowl).  Make sure you cool if for at least 2 hours before cutting.  This will really ensure that the pie stays together.  This will be my new standard summer recipe. You will love it.

This is a good recipe, but I have to agree with other posts about omitting the lemon juice.  It made it way too tangy.  Next time I'll use some "fruit fresh" maybe (I am assuming the added lemon juice is to preserve color?) instead.  Aside from that, makes a great pie.

This pie was decent. I'm not sure I enjoyed the nutmeg in here - I think it covered up the taste of the fresh peaches. I would make it again though and experiment a little.

Great pie!
The easiest way to peal a peach is to blanch it first. Boil a pot of water, then turn off the heat. Insert your peach for about 45 seconds. Take the peach out, and insert into a bowl of ice water (to stop the cooking). The skin will slide right off.

I thought this pie was fabulous!  I modified it a bit as follows:  1) I read the reviews of others and took the advice given to put the peaches in a colander before tossing them in lemon juice.  Note: I used fresh peaches.   2) I also tossed the peaches in 1/4 tsp of pure almond extract. 3) I substituted 1/2 cup of white sugar for 1/2 cup of brown sugar. 4)I also didn't toss the peaches with the flour mixture until I was ready to pour it in the crust.  I feel that's essential because it didn't have time to sit and make a lot of water before being put in the oven. 5) Last modification for me was that I left out the nutmeg.  I don't really care for the taste of nutmeg and it's easy for nutmeg to overpower whatever it touches. I made this with the French Pastry Crust recipe found on this site. All these things together made this a wonderful pie that wasn't runny and looked great.  In future pies, I may increase the amount of almond extract and lessen the amount of cinnamon in my next pie but make no mistake - this pie was a hit!

Pretty good pie. Instead of brushing the bottom crust with egg and still have it be soggy, the trick is to bake your pies on the lowest rack of the oven preferably on a pizza stone. Bake it at 425* for 15 to 20 minutes then reduce the heat to 350* and bake 30 to 40 minutes longer. If the top crust isn't browning as much as you like, bring the pie up to the middle rack and finish the last 10 minutes using a crust ring to keep from over browning the outer edges. Works every time no more soggy bottoms!

DELICIOUS! Everyone I had taste test this was raving about it even those who had never even heard of peach pie before. Easy recipe. I used canned peaches since peaches aren't currently in season. About 2 19oz (peach weight) cans and one of the regular sized cans makes 5 cups. I let the peaches drain in a colander (sprinkled with just a little lemon juice - know these peaches will be sweet so I wasn't too concerned about sourness and don't even know if this step is necessary for canned peaches) while I prepped the pie crust. I let the pie crust sit in the fridge while I mixed the peaches. I read reviews and only modified this way: added about 1 tsp vanilla, decreased nutmeg to about 1/4 tsp, added about 1 tsp more flour, used 1/4c brown sugar in place of the white - decreased total sugar about 1/4 cup (because I used canned peaches that were already soaked in heavy syrup). I made it with a lattice crust and will do that again. I wouldn't dip the fork tines in egg to seal it with again though because I think it made my crust darker in those areas. Did brush the whole crust with an egg wash and poked holes with the fork all over the bottom crust to avoid air bubbles. It came out sooo scrumptious that I am craving a piece right now while I'm writing this! It tasted best as it settled (a couple days) and warmed up as others said, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. HIGHLY recommend using Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe for this (and everything else for that matter). EDIT: DEFINIT

My first time to make a peach pie...was extremely yummy!  Used store bought crust, and followed advice to try using lime juice rather than lemon.  Probably used a tad extra cinnamon cause I'm a big cinnamon lover, plus sprinkled the top lightly with a bit of sugar and cinnamon.  Also drained the peaches as I peeled, and used a bit less than 5 cups of peaches...more like a little over 4 cups.  

This pie is so great, I think it is even bullet proof.  Don't be afraid, just dive right in and give it a shot.

I want to say right off I am not a Peach Pie fan, my husband is, and had purchased a box of 42 Peaches so I thought I would give it a whirl. OMGosh!!! HUBBY LOVED IT AND SO DID I!!!! I followed the recipe exactly and I did make a homemade crust, My hubby started raving before he swallowed the first bite. FLAVOR WAS PERFECT, I was so proud, Thank You for a great recipe.
P.S. I just bought another box of peaches and am going to can this recipe, less the flour which I will add when I am ready to make another pie, MMMM, Fresh Peach Pie all year long... Can't believe I actually like peach pie, Who knew :0

This pie was such a hit in my family that I made 4 more for the local VFW,  I used about 1/2 the lemon juice, just enough to preserve the color of those beautiful fresh picked fruits.  Cutting back on the lemon juice I realized I only needed about 1/2 the sugar as well.  I did the lattice top and brushed with an egg wash sprinkled with sugar.  To prevent over browning on the edge I covered that in aluminum foil and removed it the last 10 min of baking.  This was so easy to assemble, even a novice baker would have a hit on their hands with this pie!

I baked two pies this weekend using this recipe. They each turned out great. I made a couple of changes based on the first try. In the second pie, I used about a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken up the peach juice. I also added a half teaspoon of almond extract. The egg wash on the bottom crust was an idea I'd never tried and it worked perfectly. Peach pie lovers are going to appreciate this one.

I don't get it.  I followed the directions.  This is my first peach pie, but by no means my first rodeo.  I took it out of the oven and cooled it on the counter overnight.  This morning it looks more like peach soup, there is so much liquid under that crust.  I cut a piece and drained at least a cup of liquid out into the sink.  What did I do wrong?  I cut plenty of slits.

This pie was phenomenal!  First things first: make a homemade crust.  It doesn't take that much longer.  Mom's pie crust on All Recipes is great.  A few changes: only use 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Definitely keep the lemon juice - it keeps the peaches firm.  After 45 minutes in the oven - I put the oven on low broil for 90 seconds to brown my lattice crust.  PERFECT!

This was excellent! I did make a few changes - per other people's suggestions - so this rating is for the pie with those modifications. I made my own crust, but I think you will be alright with the store bought kind. MODIFICATIONS: 1. Used half the amount of flour and substituted with corn starch, 2. Used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 3. Omitted the spices (my husband does not like them), 4. I used some egg wash on the bottom of my pie crust before filling it so prevent it from getting mushy, and it worked like a charm!

This pie was very good, but I had a few issues. First, the bottom crust was soggy even though I brushed it with a beaten egg. Next time I intend to brush the bottom crust with the beaten egg, bake for 15 minutes, cool, and then add the filling.  Second, I felt as though there was too much cinnamon. The peaches were sweet and flavorful, but the cinnamon-flavored syrup (apart from the peaches) kept reminding me of an apple pie. Next time I will either use only 1/4 t. of cinnamon, or omit it completely. I will probably add a 1/4 t. of ginger as well to help add to the loss of flavor due to the decrease in cinnamon.  I also found that I needed to bake the pie longer. I baked it at 450 degrees for 10 minutes, covered the edges with foil to prevent over browning, baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, covered the rest of the pie with a sheet of foil (again, to prevent over browning), then continued baking for another 10 minutes.  One last note, was that I did not care for the coloring of the syrup. I believe that the flour made the syrup too white and cloudy (I also think it tasted a bit too floury), and I tend to associate peach pies with a clearer, more translucent color. Again, the white cloudiness reminded me of apple pies. Next time I intend to use only corn starch for that aesthetically pleasing touch.   I used my own pie crust recipe. Before brushing the top crust, I beat in a splash of milk to the remaining egg. I then sprinkled the top with a heaping T. of sugar. Very good!

Great pie! I usually adjust the amount of sugar depending in the sweetness of the peaches. I don't find the cinnamon and nutmeg overpowering as other reviewers have stated. In fact, I use a whole teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. I'll be making this pie all summer long.

This is my first review.  I just had to write something about how great this pie turned out.  I followed directions except I used a Marie Calendars pie crust.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this as directed, except I added about 1 cup more peaches because I was using a deep dish pie plate.  I made my own crust (family recipe) and the pie turned out great!  I served it with a little non sweetened whipped cream so it wouldn't be too sweet.  I probably could have added some sugar to the cream since the pie wasn't over whelmingly sweet. Make sure you have nice ripe peaches so it will juice up, mine were a tad under ripe and it didn't get as juicy as I would have liked.

Pie filling was very good.  The only change I used was to do do the lime juice instead of the lemon, and I did it in a colander to let the extra drain.  None of my guests claimed to be able to taste the lime, but I thought I could - but I could have been flavor searching for it.  Also, despite the calendar and letting it sit a good 30 min after baking, the pie filling still was exceptional runny (unable to get a "slice" out).  The last couple pie's I made didn't have this problem, but it was my first peach pie so I will chalk the runnyness up to inexperience; I believe next time I will try to drain more of the excess liquid off that forms after mixing in the flour\sugar\etc.  Other than that, I thought the pie had a fine flavor.  I look forward to trying to make it again so as to resolve some of the issues I had.  I think that it could be outstanding, if my skills were better and with a couple of miner modifications.    Note:  The star rating is what my fiance assigned it after tasting it.  I concur with it, though.

Okay not sure if it was something I did, or the recipe, but I followed the recipe exactly, even added the lemon juice in a colander to let extra liquid run off, and my pie still didn't set! The pie filling was all over. We let it cool a few hours before slicing so that wasn't the issue either. Not sure. Any way flavor was great though.

Wow! This was really good! Used homegrown peaches a friend gave us & wasn't expecting anything special, just wanted to get rid of the peaches. First peach pie I have ever made & it was great. Followed the directions & also followed advice of another reviewer to use a collander and sprinkle the peaches w/ lemon or lime juice. I used lemon but will try lime next time.

I love this pie, but my crust was still a little soggy the day after and I did drain the peaches and brush with the egg. I also would have preferred it be a little sweet, but overall it was very good.

Delish!  I made this pie with half the sugar (thanks to diabetes!).  The cinnamon and nutmeg enhanced the peach flavor, and with less sugar, the peaches were more "front and center" than other peach pies I've made.  I will make this one again.

AWESOME !!! I didn't follow the recipe measurements exactly I added another cup of fruit and what I did was mix the fruit in a bowl with 2 Tbsp of lemon juice and then put it in a colindar to drain excess juice off. I only used about 3/4 cup sugar to avoid being too sweet and went with about an 1/8 tsp of nutmeg to avoid it from taking over the peach flavor. I followed cooking time exactly and this pie will now be the only peach pie I make......soooo many compliments. I also used a full top crust with lots of air vents and a white wash on it

OMG, this is the best pie I have EVER tasted!!! I did two slight modifications: I used half white sugar and half light brown sugar, and I backed off a bit on the nutmeg. I also poured the peaches into a colander and gently shook it after coating the peaches with lemon juice, to get the extra liquid off. It was PERFECT and worth the hassle of slicing 8 large peaches!

This is a really good recipe but needs a little tweaking in my opinion.  I was unsure about the nutmeg, but used it as written - next time I will omit it because it just tastes too strong for my idea of an old fashioned peach pie.  I think it would be just right with the cinnamon alone.  Also, as some reviews suggested, I used 1/4 c flour and 1/4 c corn starch, but mine was still runny.  Next time I may try 1/2 c flour as well as 1/4 c corn starch.  This is one of the best recipes I've found so far, as most of the others are peaches and cream instead of good old fashioned plain peach! Also, do take the time to make the crust from scratch.  I used a store bought roll out one for the first time today and it definitely leaves something to be desired.  Homemade is totally worth the effort. :-)

I did this exactly as written except for I  did not have enough peaches (the first time) so I added frozen blueberrys to the mix. That made it to runny. The second time I made this I had enough peaches and I used corn stach instead of flour, it came out beautiful, not runny, set up nicely and had a wonderful flavor. I especially like brushing the crust with the egg, I think that makes a world of difference. I will definately be making this again.

I usually like to make recipes without changes the first try in order to give a fair review.  I found the pie did not have much "glaze", making the peaches seem very dense.  The flavor was okay, but could have been a bit sweeter for my taste.  This is a decent recipe, and I do like the double crust, but just wished there would have been a bit more glaze to balance out the denisty of the crust and peaches.

Great recipe with a couple of modifications.  I'm not proud - I used a frozen pie crust. I brushed the bottom crust w/the egg, covered the edge of the crust w/foil & baked it @ 350 for 12 minutes & filled it when cool.  Mixed the sugar/flour/cinn/ nutmeg/salt with the peaches & let the liquid settle out while the bottom crust was baking & cooling then just took the peaches off the top & left the excess liquid in the bowl. Baked the pie 10 min @ 400 & 40 min @ 350 with the pie sitting on an insulated cookie sheet to keep the bottom crust from overbooking. It sliced into perfect wedges after coolingnfor 20 minutes! Also agree that brushing the top crust w/melted butter & dusting it with sugar is an excellent idea!

At my house we rate our meals - my husband rated this pie five stars!  It was very yummy.  I did add 1/2 tsp of almond extract to this pie, I love peach and almond together, it came out perfect and it was delicious...I did do a bit of my famous pie crust decoration to this one!  Loved by all who tried it and made the neighbors jealous!!  Thanks for this superb recipe!

Yummy!  I used fresh peaches from our local farm and it was wonderful.  Everyone loved it and it was so easy to make.  Not to mention, it was made with wholesome ingrediants unlike many of the other recipes on this website.

I love EASY peach pie recipes and this one definitely is- but leave out the majority of the lemon juice- peaches have so much great flavor and the lemon juice kills it.  Otherwise it was easy to make!

This was a great tasting pie!  I'll use this recipe again.  I used a little bit more cinnamon than called for, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  It's not a real sloppy pie and I like that too.

My wonderful mom died two years ago today. As I reminisced with my children, we talked about her best pie of the season...peach.  I looked at the recipes here and found this one to be most like hers.  Home-made crust, of course.  She did not use egg on the top crust, however.  She always brushed it with milk and sprinkled plain sugar over that creating a thin sweet glazed crust on top.  I think I will make one now in her honor!

This is a PERFECT pie, when made with ripe summer peaches.  Here in Colorado, we get some of the very best summer peaches from our Western Slope area.  I followed the directions, but added no nutmeg (that's just a personal taste).  Made the crust from a Betty Crocker cookbook recipe.  This will be my peach pie recipe now.  There's one in the oven now, to take to a friend for her birthday.  Thanks!

Good recipe!  As did others, I adjusted it to my family's tastes.  I omitted the nutmeg, and next time I will use less cinnamon, which seemed to overpower the taste of the peaches.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this pie for a family gathering because peach is my husband's favorite. He liked it but loved it after it had sat in the fridge for a couple of days. Now I make the filling the day before and let it sit.

Perfect in every way! I used fresh ripe peaches and it was so delicious! The only thing I did different was use 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup quick cooking tapioca. I really like tapioca in pies!

This was the first pie I have ever attempted to make a pie, and it was an absolute success!  I am getting married in 8 days and my fiance and I decided to make dinner and desert for my parents and one of his groomsmen. I was in charge of desert, and since we received a really cute pie dish as a gift at one of our showers, I thought it was about time to figure out how to make a really good fruit pie.  After looking through a bunch of online recipes, i chose this one, as it seemed to hit the spot the most for what I was in the mood for...  Like I said, it was a hit! My family loved it! From the first bite onward, I heard "mmmm's" around the room. Even my mom, who is particularly picky about peach pies loved it!  I pretty much stuck to the recipe, and only deviated from it in a slight way by adding 1/8tsp of ground clove in with the other spices called for.

This was my first time making a peach pie and it was great! I used Jiffy Pie Crust Mix for the crust. I modified the recipe a lot based on other reviews. What I did different was I used 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup cornstarch, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and used 1/4 teaspoon ginger instead of nutmeg. I also added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla with the lemon juice, but accidentally added a bit more then I needed and it was just as good. After adding the vanilla and lemon juice to the peaches, I put the peaches in a colander and removed the juice. I would definitely make this again.

I have made this pie twice now. Once with canned peaches and the other with fresh. I preferred the canned peach version over fresh. Same with the kids. They don't like peach cobbler but gobbled this pie up. So from here on out, I will use the canned peaches and add vanilla with a little more sugar. The sugar and vanilla thing is just my personal preference, as I like things sweet and love the vanilla flavoring.

I followed this receipe and the other reviewers' notes. This was my first time ever making a pie. I decided to make it a peach mango pie instead to see what would happen. It tasted magnificent! I used lime juice instead of lemon like one person suggested. Then, I decided to just add a dash of lemon. I used ginger instead of nutmeg like someone suggested. I egg washed the crust with egg and milk and a dash of vanilla just to see how it would work. Everything was great. Next time I will try to make my own crust.

A great pie. I used fresh, ripe peaches and
made my own crust.  I did not use the lemon juice.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and the pie was great.

I was canning peaches and went ahead and made this up and froze it!  For a dinner party, I put the frozen pie in a cold oven, turned over up to 425 degrees for 45 minutes, then down to 350 for 40 minutes. The pie was fantastic, brown and lucious.

I thought this recipe was delicious.  It was, however, a little sweet.  I followed the recipe except I added about one extra cup of peaches.  It is great with vanilla ice cream on top.

I followed some of the advice and switched out the nutmeg for ginger ( very good!) and I upped the cinnamon to 1 t. I LOVED it, and my four year old said "This is the world's best pie mom!" I also did a homemade crust. ( I HATE to actually make them, but they are a necessity when it comes to pies. It really adds so much to the pie. I will make this again.

This was delicious! & the first time I ever made peach pie.  However, I used half dark brown sugar & it reminded me of pecan pie (my favorite).  Very good with fresh peaches - you can still feel the texture of the skin.

This was heaven on a plate...however I made it with mangoes, I live in Mexico and had the mangoes, and my own home-made pastry! I am new to making pie, but I will do this again. My husband said that I can make him pie any time I want it was so good.I did change the cinnamon and nutmeg to ginger, as one reviewer suggested. Served with vanilla yogurt...delicious! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe turned out great and the taste and crust was delicious. The best pie Ive made. My husband loved it. He even took a picture of it, it looked and taste great. I used 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of tapioca instead of 1/2 flour. Great... Never had a pie turn out so good.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I really recommend cutting the lemon juice to just one tablespoon.  I added about 3/4 cups of blueberries as well and I am so glad I did.  Right before sealing the crust I sprinkled a little brown sugar over the fruit and butter.  This one is a real keeper.  I cant wait to make it with fresh peaches this summer( I used frozen peaches and fresh blueberries and it was still fabulous). Try this one you will be so glad you did.

I am only giving this 4 stars because of the recipe called for the use package pastry - and I feel that a fruit pie should always be made with fresh home made pastry, especially as it is entitled "the Old Fashioned Two Crust Way". I made a simple all butter rough puff pastry which takes minutes to put together. Other than that I really did like this recipe - the filling was very good and not overly sickly sweet - I used ginger as I prefer it to the taste of cinnamon and nutmeg. I will definitely be making this again - as previously noted by another reviewer DON'T omit the lemon or lime juice as it is a key part in the cooking process and  prevents the fruit becoming soggy and discoloured.

i have baked this pie numerous times, and it's ALWAYS a hit. I omit the nutmeg and just double the cinnamon, but also dice up about half a stick of butter (instead of the recommended amount). I typically lattice the crust... turns out fantastic!

firmer peaches help give the pie a nice texture. i switched the white sugar for brown sugar to help give the pie a depth in taste it was missing. turned out fantastic!!

I read all of the reviews and took a couple of suggestions.  I cut the 1/4 t. of nutmeg down to 1/8 t, and instead of using 1/2 c. of flour I used 1/4 c. of flour and 1/4 c. of cornstarch.  The pie was still pretty runny, however the taste was OUTSTANDING.  I will use a couple of tablespoons more of cornstarch next time I make this pie.

This is a very easy, old fashioned tasting peach pie. Definately need to use fresh peaches! Do not need to do a thing...although, we all seem to tweak the recipes a bit to suit tastes and make them our own. In my case I added a 1/4 tsp. of ground ginger, cut the lemon juice to 1 tblsp. and added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, using 1/4 cup of dark brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar. Came out perfect, juicy, but not soupy by any means. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was a delicious peach pie.  I used Rosie4Pres's idea of the colander when using the lemon juice and it worked beautifully.  I parboiled the peaches for 2 mins. to make peeling them easier and then baked for a few mins. less.  The peaches were slightly mushy so next time I would parboil for maybe a minute or so, or peel the regular way.  I liked the idea of putting egg on the bottom crust and may use that for other pie recipes.  I would, however, suggest eating this pie up within a couple days or so, I noticed the top crust was starting to get a bit soft by the 3rd day.  The nutmeg is a wonderful touch!

This pie is the best! So simple to make. Everyone devoured it at work! I didn't use the egg and it turned out just fine. Also, I added a little bit of brown sugar, butter, and pecans to the top of the pie in the last 20 min or so. I probably baked a good 10 min more than suggested, but I guess that depends on your oven.

Hands down the best peach pie I've ever had. My boyfriend agreed! So quick and easy! There's a couple elements that you HAVE TO keep in mind in order for this to come out as amazing as it did for me. First, make sure you have ripe peaches that are in season. Second, find a flaky homemade pie crust recipe. PLEASE make your own pie crust and make a lattice design if you have time. I think that's essential for baking a pie more evenly. The pie crust I use is "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" here on Allrecipes. I didn't have to change a thing and it wasn't runny for me or too tangy. A lot of other users added more ingredients, but I don't feel that it needed any. If I have delicious ripe peaches I don't want to hide/mask their flavor!

I have a peach pie in the oven baking as I type this. This is the only recipe for peach pie I will use and I am an avid baker. I make my own crust. I agree that the lemon juice is a must in this recipe. It enhances the peach flavour in my opinion. I don't alter the recipe in any way. I think it's perfect as is.

Here's my variation and it came PERFECT.

I used only 1 tbsp lemon juice.  1/8 tsp nutmeg and just a light dusting of cinnamon (otherwise it tastes too much like apple pie) and added 1 heaping tbsp of corn starch and added the butter and mixed well.   Covered with plastic wrap and let sit room temp for 30 minutes.   I brushed top with milk (not egg) and sprinkled with sugar.  I also let it sit in oven (off) for 10-15 minutes.  Use white sugar....I tried it with 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar....again too much like apple pie.  and too much lemon juice makes it too tart.   I've been searching for the perfect peach pie for my husband and this one is IT!!!

The filling was so watery it made a huge mess and made the bottom crust soggy.  Needs some Knox to firm up the filling.  Reduce the nutmeg by half it is way too overpowering for this recipe.

OMG. This was delicious. I followed the recipe for the most part except that I added some vanilla. Also, I didn't have lemon juice so I used orange juice which i was worried about but it worked fine. I also used a colander to drain the extra juice.  It tastes like something my grandmother would make and goes super with vanilla ice cream.

Wonderful filling recipe!  I made the crust from scratch instead of using store-bought, so I didn't brush with an egg.  Also, since some reviewers said it was a little tart with the lemon juice, I juiced half a fresh lemon over the peaches rather than using bottled stuff.  I didn't put butter on top either - the homemade crust has plenty of butter.  It turned out delicious.  The kidlet says it's "heaven on a plate" and the SO declares it the best pie he's ever eaten.  I agree with both!

Great recipe. Just the right amount of spice. Brushing the crust with egg really made a difference in keeping the crust from getting soggy.

I added about 2 cups of apples to about 3 cups of peaches and used my favorite homemade crust recipe.  After reading comments, I squeezed fresh lime juice over the peaches (in a colander). I made my pie in the evening and let it stand until after dinner the next day.  The consistency was perfect.  My boys (dad, husband and son) all loved it.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing. I'll be sure to use this recipe again.

I made the following modifications with fantastic results:  I made my own pastry, made a lattice top, and used Splenda instead of sugar.  It was perfect!  The lemon juice is needed, so don't be tempted to skip it based on other reviews.

I read all of the reviews prior to baking and used a few suggestions..1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup corn startch..used lime juice in collander instead of lemon, left out nutmeg and doubled cinnamon.  When I ate while warm, it tasted too tangy, but when I had a slice after it completely cooled, the tang was much less noticeable.  This pie was NOT runny at all!  I spooned in my mixture with a slotted spoon instead of poured in the pan.  Maybe that helped prevent runniness?  I think this is a wonderful recipe!

I made this with some fresh peaches and it was fantastic. I did drain the peaches for a while in a colander to drain off the juice. I also omitted the nutmeg and replaced it with ginger. The pie was perfect! The bottom crust was nice and firm and the top was perfect. I will say that having made many pies over the years I have found that the liquid content isn't the only culprit of soggy crust. Many time your oven is the biggest problem in baking. Uneven cooking, wrong temps etc.. It is always best to have a thermometer inside the oven to make sure it is heating as it should.

WOW is all i can say...this pie was gone in a flash!  I didn't feel like sifting through reviews like I sometimes do, so I just made it exactly as written, except that I didn't peel the peaches (when it comes to cooking I go to the wall but I tend to be a lazy baker :p).  Deeeeelicious thanks!  :)

Oh my gosh! This was my first pie ever and it made me a star on Labor Day!  I took the advice of other reviewers and excluded the lemon juice, used firm peaches, and substituted brown for white sugar, while placing a lattice crust for optimal ventilation...absolutely sinful - a MUST TRY!

I made this pie yesterday and it was DELICIOUS!  My first peach pie ever, and my husband loved it!  As some reviewers suggested I used the Butter Flaky Crust from this site, and it complimented the pie very well.  I left out the lemon juice, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly with great results... not too sweet and not runny!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic. I followed it to the letter and it turned out great. I used room temperature butter. It was very easy to make. I will be making this as often as possible while peaches are in season from now on!

I like Pie. A lot. But i had never had a peach pie and a friend of ours said peach was her favorite so i made this one and it was outstanding. Thank You. I didn't change a thing. The crust was my own variety but i used everything in the measures given and it was so good that i don't think it could get any better.

I made this pie yesterday and it was a big hit with my friends.  I used a pillsbury pie crust and used 1/2 cup light brown sugar and 1/2 cup regular sugar.  I used canned peaches (3 13 oz cans!) and drained them well and ommitted the lemon.  I also used a little less flour and about 3tps of cornstarch to avoid the runniness that other reviewers had without diluting the flavor.  My only criticism was that the crust did come out slightly soggy and that the flavor of nutmeg was a bit overwhelming and I happen to love nutmeg.  Next time I will cut it down to 1/8 tsp. That should be perfect.  Everyone that tried this pie loved it though...perhaps I am the toughest critic. With modifications, this will be my go to recipe for peach pie!

I made this for this the other day and my sister said it could have won some prize.  The changes I made were: I made the crust and half brown sugar half white and I added a teaspoon of almond extract.  I forgot the butter and left the pie in the oven after I turned it off.  Thanks  so much for the wonderful recipe!!!!!

Using this recipe is why I'm known as the pie maker in the family. The spices complement the peaches perfectly without overpowering it. Amazing recipe!

Pie was great.  Just a few adjustments.  I moved my oven rack from in the middle down one and that took care of the bottom crust being cooked completely ( this works out well for custard pies as well).  I also used splenda instead of sugar.  My peaches were fresh and really ripe so I used 3/4 cup.  I didn't bush the crust with egg but instead used milk then sprinkled with sugar.  I had to baked it 15 @ 450, then turned it down to 350.  I had to bake it at this temp for nearly 50 min.  So next time I would  let it cook longer at the 450 or on;y tun down the oven to 375 in order to brown the crust.  besides that, it was a great pie !!!

My oh my - this was so good! Made it as written with my own crust and fresh peaches. Only thing I would change next time - drain the juice - it came out very soupy - still good, just didn't hold up even after several hours of cooling. Oh - and I forgot to put the butter on top of the peaches before I put on the top crust but it still came out wonderfully. My husband thinks I'm a genious now - thank you!

This was a great peach pie, my husband, who normally hates pie, had two pieces. That was a great compliment. I did not use the egg and I omitted the nutmeg. It had plenty of flavor with just the cinnamon. I will definitely be making this pie again.

Excellent base recipe. After reading a lot of reviews, I did some tweaking. I made a 10" pie.
Homemade 2 crusts.
I used the 2 of lemon but did drain Peaches in colander.  Next time,  I will use maybe 1/4C more sugar, I could still taste the lemon too much. I used a good dash of cinnamon,  1/4t nutmeg, 1/2 vanilla extract (did not have almond extract) and I added a little freshly grated ginger to the filling. I did bake @ 450 for 10 min., and then 50 min. @ 350.
Excellent pie, more sugar next time. My husband loved it & had another piece for breakfast this morning. Good luck.

Celebrating summer with Georgia peaches!
My local grocery has an enormous crop of wonderful Georgia peaches ready to go, and on sale to boot!
I used the general recipe but made some changes after reading reviews.
I ended up with about 8 cups of sliced peaches after preparing the peaches I had purchased. I squeezed about 2 T lemon juice over the fruit (to help hold their shape and color) but could not imagine ditching all the sublime juices using a strainer, as the juices are half the flavor! Instead, I used the 1/2 C of flour and added about 1 T of fine tapioca as well as approximately 1 T of cornstarch, knowing that this should thicken the juices and prevent peach soup! I did as reviewers suggested and used 1/4 c white sugar with 1/4 c brown, mixed. I also omitted the nutmeg but added a small splash of vanilla and a scoche of almond extract, too, to enhance the peach flavor. All in all it was a very tasty pie which no doubt would have been even better with a homemade crust! I also did leave the pie in the oven an additional 10 minutes after the oven was turned off, as suggested. After cooling the pie for maybe an hour or an hour and a half, I sliced and served a perfectly formed triangle of peach pie, not too soupy, not too dry! Topped with simple vanilla-bean ice cream it was delicious!

This recipe is divine! My husband made it with a homemade crust (pivotal), and it was as good as anything I've had in an expensive restaurant. (Better, actually, because the pie was still warm.) The filling set perfectly, and the taste was and texture were perfect!

THIS is exactly what I was looking for-just a time honored old fashioned peach pie recipe and wow-did this deliver!  Thank you for an awesome recipe that is easy to put together (my 10 year old son did most of the work) and tastes delicious.  I did use frozen peaches and it turned out fabulous.  Thank you again for a winner recipe!

After reading the reviews, I was a little apprehensive about the lemon juice. I splashed some over a bowl of 6 big, sliced peaches. Instead of a cup of white sugar I added a half cup light brown and a half cup white and added just a dash of nutmeg. Used frozen pie crusts from Trader Joe's (they come in a package of two). The consistency came out really well; not runny, but plenty of "glaze" so it wasn't just dry peaches either. Something seems to missing from the flavor of the filling, though. It didn't taste terribly "peachy." Not very sweet. This will probably be a make-once-annually type of thing for me. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe.  Used half brn. and half white sugar.  I did not use lemon juice because I sliced peaches in to water that had fruit fresh in it.  I also left out the nutmeg.  Wonderful pie.

Great recipe! Though I also agree the lemon juice way overpowered the peach flavor. So I'm going to try cutting it in half. Other than that really good.

I am a diabetic so I made a few changes. I used 1/2 cup Splenda Sugar Blend instead of sugar and used 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I used the pre-made crust from the dairy isle, but next time I will look at the health food store for a healthier version. The pie was quite delicious and even the non-diabetics raved about it.

Don't follow the egg-happy instructions. Followed them to a tee and the crust burned in less than 15 minutes.

Tweaked the recipe a bit: omitted the nutmeg altogether, added a half-teaspoon of almond extract, used the (unmeasured) juice of one  whole lemon, and upped flour to a heaping half-cup.  Pie was better than OK (faint praise, huh?), but had a somewaht sour quality (even though peaches were, if anything, overripe).  I suspect  I used too much lemon juice and will omit the almond extract next time.  Texture of filling was near perfect -- not runny at all, withough being pasty or floury.  Pie was in the oven perhaps an additional 10-15 mins.  Used French Pastry Pie Crust (from this site) (see my review there, if you're interested).  All in all ... this is  the peach-pie recipe I will come back to.

This is definitely the best ever peach pie recipe!!  I made a mistake when preparing it and accidentally added ground clove instead of ground nutmeg and to my surprise IT IS AWESOME!!  It would be really good around the holidays...  If you love peach pie try this recipe!

I just made this pie tonight and ate it with my friends!!!  I could not wait to write the review so I am writing the review while my friends play on our guitar hero.  The pie was amazing, but I did follow chizikm review.  Thank you for your changes they were wonderful.  I looked up online for the best premade crust and "Good Housekeeping" said whole foods!  They were totally right.  I have to say my homemade crust is not as good.  Best pie ever!!!  I recommend this recipe with chizikm changes to all AND USE WHOLE FOODS CRUST!!!

great flavor.  Baked well w/o burning or overcooking crust.  Make again.  cover loosely so crust stays firm.

very good pie. I've made this several times and have had requests for it. I use frozen peaches that I thaw, and add 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and another 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. love it!

Way too bitter from the lemon juice. I bought fresh peaches right from the orchard and was so disappointed at how bitter-tasting it was. I would make this again, but cut way back on the lemon juice.

Came out fantastic for me! Was out of lemon juice and sprinkled some orange juice instead. Pieces remained firm after cutting. Was just as good cold the day after. I baked this living in Europe and it made a nice impression with European guests. Peaches were also picked locally.

This was the most delicious peach pie I've ever had! I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour. Also I used 3/4 cups of sugar and since the peaches are so sweet already it didnt make any difference at all. I loved this recipe! I will definatly use it again.

I made this pie with 1/3 C Splenda and 1/2 C Brown Sugar Splenda instead of sugar. It was fabulous! I baked the pie in a heavy 8” round ceramic baker on the lowest oven rack and followed the temperature instructions exactly. The bottom crust was crisp and flaky just like the top and my filling wasn’t runny at all. I too used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site. It’s really worth the little extra effort. Thanks for the perfect peach pie recipe!

Used the lemon juice and allowed peaches to drain in colander as suggested by previous reviews. Pie filling turned out watery consistency and bottom pie crust was soggy. I even left pie in oven an additional 10 minutes at 400 deg. Didn't turn out well. Had to throw the whole pie away. I don't know if maybe baking the pie at 400 deg for a full hour will help, but I'll try it again. I think baking at 350 caused the peaches to simmer in the juices, but not enough heat to evaporate which made the crust soggy. Filling had a "weird" flavor as well - an after taste.

it was very good. I did half the amount of lemon juice and i think it brought out the flavor more. lemon juice is pretty potent and I didnt wanna oer do it. I also made my pie crust from scratch and added some of the peach juice into the mixture witch made it taste amazing. I also did half the amount of nutmeg and substituted it for a little bit of brown sugar. With a dab of whipped cream when it was all cooked. My family really enjoyed it...

I made my husband very happy with this peach cobbler. I used almost 3 lbs of peaches to get 5 cups sliced. This was my first attempt without using the canned peaches. The peaches had a tangy almost tarty but sweet flavor, which was good and it was all very fresh tasting, but maybe next time I'll use half the lemon juice called for. I even forgot the butter and the salt, and it still turned out great! I used an 8x8 dish and had to cook this almost 8 minutes longer. I'll definitely make this again! Thanks, you've made our tastebuds very happy.

This was the first time I have ever tried to make a pie from scratch. Many times I have gotten the canned fillings but never anything like this. I was very pleased with the out come. I did use a purchased crust, which I will not do in the future, but it was good. It was not as sweet as I thought it would be, but still very good. I did *not* use the lemon juice (I didnt have any) and the filling was very thick. I will try this recipe again with the lemon juice and a homemade crust and see how things are. But even as it is, the pie is very yummy!

I doubled this recipe. The pie looked great on top but was not quite cooked. Next time I will add 10 min. when using fresh peaches. I will also use less flour and sugar as it overpowered the peaches and was tooo sweet.

I made this yesteday for supper and it is very good.  I sprinkled some lime juice on the peaches after I cut them up.  I used Red Haven peaches which are sugar sweet right now here in Western New York.  This is peach pie as I remember and love it.  I used my Mom's crust recipe and it was yummy.  Thanks for helping me recreate a great dessert.

Made this pie and it was good. Since I do not eat sweets I have to go on what my family says on this recipe. I only gave it a three because they said it was more like a cobbler than a pie. I personally thought it looked great, so thanks for the recipe!

Very, very good peach pie recipe!! This was the first peach pie I've ever made and I will definitely make this again and again! I followed the advice of another reviewer and tweaked the recipe a bit: began with fresh, but not hard under-ripe peaches, kept them in a colander with the lemon juice, substituted some of the flour with cornstarch (although I probably won't use quite as much in the future, as it caused the pie to set up a little too firm), substituted some of the white sugar with brown sugar, used a dash of ginger instead of nutmeg, and added a 1/2 tsp vanilla. I found that the egg on the top crust wanted to burn but am unsure how to prevent that. Overall, the pie looked beautiful, smelled amazing, and WOWED my husband and son!!! Some other reviewers complained of it being too watery - I don't know what recipe they were using because this was perfect!!! Maybe it was the cornstarch ;) LOVE THIS PIE!!!!!

Great recipe = great pie.  If you don't like the lemon juice, try Meyer Lemons, a sweeter less tart/tangy lemon and same functionality.  For a twist, try lime juice - don't knock it till you tried it.

Very Yummy! I reduced the nutmeg to a pinch because I personally think it's an overwhelming spice. I added the ginger I read in a review. And added a pinch of ground cloves. Despite all the reviews about not using store bought crust I cheesed out and did just that and it didn't detract from the pie at all!!!! Thanks for the recipe!

This was the best peach pie I have ever had! I sprinkle the lemon juice over the peaches in a colander like others suggested to do and added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to the recipe for fears it would be soupy like others complained. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly as written though. I was afraid it would not have enough cooking time but at the 45 minute mark it looked gorgous so I pulled it out of the oven to cool. We ate it a couple hours later and it was perfect. I didn't even need a pie gate to keep the filling in the pie.

Good basic recipe. I blanched the peaches for a minute which made them way easy to peel. I also followed advice and poured lemon juice over peaches in a strainer. I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.

Awesome Peach Pie!  I made this for a summer party a few days ago... First attempt at a peach pie ever.  Received many compliments and the pie was the only dessert completely gone.  Some advice:  I would change the lemon juice to a single table spoon.  Quickly blanching the peaches for 45 seconds and then placing in an ice-water bath is amazing for removing the peach skin.  I did use a refrigerated Pillsbury pie crust.  I recommend using a lattice crust -this really helped with allowing enough moister from the filling to evaporate as to create the perfect pie which was not runny in the least.

We devoured this in my house! I was so upset I didnt have ice cream because that would have made it perfect!.  I made my own pie crust (a flakey texture one). I did half the sugar with brown sugar and used lime instead of lemon (all i had on hand). Next time I will use a colander to strain out some of the extra juice though. I WILL be making this again!

I used about 6 cups of sliced peaches, and brushed the beaten egg on the top crust followed with sprinkled white sugar. Cooked it about 5-10 additional minutes. This was the very BEST Peach Pie I've made, and I've made many! Brushing the egg on the bottom crust was key information! This pie had no soggy crust! Yay!!

This was delicious. I did decrease the white sugar to 1/2 cup and the flour to 1/4 cup. I added two Tbsp of corn starch and strained the peaches in a colander after adding the lemon juice. I also used a lattice top to my pie. My family loved it.

This was my first time making peach pie and me and my fiance loved it.  It was his request and he said it was perfect.  This was easy and I will make it again.  Thank you.

PS:  I left the pie in the oven for 10 minutes with the oven shut off.

Fantastic dessert!  I made this just once and it is already my daughter's favorite pie.  I did make the following changes based on other's reviews: Subbed lime juice for the lemon, 1/2 a/p flour and 1/2 corn starch, 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and subbed ginger for the nutmeg and added some blueberries.  Will definitely make this again and again ~

I have never eaten a piece of peach pie in my life.  I have no idea where I have been but this is the best pie I have ever eaten.  The only thing I did differently was use a homemade crust.  My grandson has a little cafe and I do the baking.  This pie is one of the favorites

wow! great pie!  It didn't even need the extra butter.  I tried to avoid the "soupy" problem by allowing my sliced peaches to chill while drenched in lemon juice.  I rinsed the juices off in a pasta strainer before adding the dry stuff.  I might add a little more flour next time, but otherwise I (and my coworkers) thought this pie was just sweet enough and just tart enough AND it didn't taste too "floury" to me like some other reviewers have commented on.  I used fresh peaches (5 or 6 I found to yield 5 cups of sliced peaches) and cut out the nutmeg because nutmeg always tastes too Holiday-ish.  I used "Mom's Pie Crust".  And I forgot to put the eggwash down before the peach mixture, but I didn't have a soupy problem.  Everyone at work said the "goup" was the best part!

This pie was awesome.  I used the lime juice as recommended.  I cooked it a little bit longer.  I always wait until I see the center of my pie bubbling a little...then I almost never have a runny pie.  The bottom of the oven pays the price sometimes, but its worth it.

Well, not sure what happened with the pie, but it was a bit 'soupy'. I'm rating it 4 stars because the taste was still very good. Followed many people's advice from reviews, but still 'soupy'. Not sure that I will make it again.

Disappointing. It didn't taste like peach pie with all the nutmeg & cinnamon...more like apple pie. Also, way too runny, even after following other reviewers' ideas to minimize liquid. I will try another recipe next time.

I was amazed the peaches held their form so well but I personally don't care for the amount of nutmeg taste so next time I will omit that. I also used half lime half lemon juice and tossed in a strainer. No problem being too juicy since peach pies are supposed to have some goo. I used the french pie crust from this site and after sitting overnight, the pie did not become soggy at all.

I made some changes to prevent the pie from being runny after reading the reviews and it still came out a little runny but has an excellent flavor and we plan on finishing it. I did half flour and half cornstarch, strained the peaches, halfed the lemon juice, added blueberries, half white, half brown sugar, and added 5 min to baking time. I also egg washed the shell inside and out which made it a nice golden brown color. Next time I would add a little more cornstarch to thicken it a little more and increase the baking time to 45 min at 350 after the initial 10 min at 450. Overall it is a very good pie and would make it again.

Not sure what all the excitement is about with this recipe.  I followed the recipe, but my pie turned out runny and was not baked the whole way through.  I don't think 35 minutes was enough time.  I do agree with the reviewer who suggested using Mom's Pie Crust - I really liked the homemade crust.  I may try this again and keep it in the oven longer.

Just made this today with peaches from the flea market. They were not very good peaches, but putting them in this pie made them delicious! Magic.

Very tasty!  I used a never fail pie crust recipe from here as the crust.  Sooo good.  I did add a bit more cinnamon though, because I like it :) No other changes than that.

I used this recipe to make a "peach rhubarb cardamom pie" and it was awesome! I made a homemade crust using the "best ever pie crust" recipe. I replaced about 1-1.5 cups of the peaches with diced rhubarb, boiled in sugar water for 10 minutes and drained. That way I didn't have to add any extra sugar for the sourness. I also doubled the flour because I really don't enjoy runny pie. For the spices, I used cardamom in place of cinnamon and ginger in place of nutmeg, and doubled their amounts. I also left the pie in for 10 minutes after turning off the oven. It has so much flavor!

I just made this pie, and it was soooo good. Only thing I did differently was add a bit of vanilla to the peaches. I will make this one again.

everyone loved this pie , except my mom, who thought it was okay. I'm still giving it 5 stars, because she was comparing it to a peach pie she had from a bakery, that she fell in love with. Now any peach pie that is not the same, is not good to her!

This was good.  I found with all fruit pie recipes you gotta adjust the recipe to the quality of the fruit, depends on how sweet or tart, how ripe and juicy etc.  May or may not need lemon juice or extra liquid, more flour etc. I didn't have a problem with the spices being overbearing or it tasting like apple pie, as a couple of reviews mentioned.  Maybe it will taste like apple pie to some because of the nutmeg.  This could be omitted.  Used homemade pie crust. I did brush the inside with egg as described in this recipe, won't be doing that again, the bottom crust seemed a bit gummy, which never happened before.  Best to skip that step. 
I prefer the Peach a Berry pie recipe on this site a bit more, but this one is still good.

I am a fervent lover of cinnamon, but, as written, I think that the spices would have overpowered the delicate flavor of the peaches in this pie. I used 1/4 tsp. of china cassia cinnamon, 1/8 tsp. Nutmeg, and 1/8 tsp. salt and then did a taste test and thought they were perfect, subtly enhancing the peaches.  I sliced the fruit into a colander as others suggested and tossed it gently with a little over 1 Tbsp. lemon juice.  I thought that the lemon juice was a brilliant touch; the peaches were a gorgeous color in the cut pie and held their texture well.   I will be asked for this pie several times every peach season, I am sure.

This was excellent.  I didn't put a crust on top and it still turned out great.  The only thing I would do differently maybe is add less spices (cinnamon & nutmeg) because I found that they overpowered the taste of the peaches.  It actually tasted a lot like an apple pie.

My First Fresh Peach pie and I wouldn't change a thing about it. Although I would suggest using a flaky butter crust instead of making one out of shortening, it came out wonderfully with the peaches! :)

I am rating this high as the flavours are delicious. A homemade pastry makes this very special. - I keep plugging away. Actually this was the first time I was not cursing while making the crust. Very worth it if you can manage it. I followed the directions as stated. Unfortunately the peaches I used were not the greatest and this lovely pie suffered for it. I will for sure make this again and buy the best quality of peaches I can find. Thanks for this recipe. It's tucked away for the next time.

It was so easy, I have made this recipe twice, the first time it was a but tangy because of the lemon juice. The second time I omitted the lemon juice and ensured that I mixed the peaches and the flour mixture thoroughly since the peaches were nice and juicy. MY FAMILY LOVES THIS PIE!!!

I made this pie for a potluck dinner...It was a major hit!  I actually doubled the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to use 1/2 granulated sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  It was not the last bit runny, and so delicious!  I also used my own pie crust instead of the store bought kind.

I give this recipe 5 stars for the peach filling, This pie was enthusiastically gobbled up by my guests, but I only give it 4 stars overall because I did a homemade crust (Pastry for Double Pie-Crust, also on here), and can't help but think that added to the perfection. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added a 1/4 tsp. of ginger, both based on other reviewers. I also did a lattice top which looked a bit messy as it was my first attempt ever, but everyone was still impressed. I will make again for sure.

This recipe was perfect!  I love to bake, but this was my first peach pie.  Even members of my family who aren't peach fans loved it.  I used fresh peaches, left out the nutmeg, increased the cinnamon, and layered the peaches with the flour mixture directly in the pie shell instead of mixing in a bowl to prevent squishing the peaches. I will make this easy and tasty pie often!!!!

Very good.  I followed reviewers advice and sauted the fruit and removed extra juice.  I also used 1/2 flour 1/2 corn starch.  I added blueberries because I had them handy.

I followed the suggestion for using the colander.  I also added a tablespoon extra flour.  The pie came out great and the crust wasn't soggy at all.  The egg really made the crust look good too.

This is the first dessert pie I've ever made. It was easy, and turned out FANTASTIC! I did use the colander to strain the extra lemon juice from the peach mixture, but I think that some degree of remaining juice is necessary in order to get a good consistency once you add the dry ingredients. This pie was a huge hit, and I will definitely be making more pies in the future!

basically a good recipe although I did alter it. I used my own pastry recipe which has just a tad of sugar in the dough. I pre-bake my bottom crust also which helps to keep it crisp. I did as another reviewer suggested and tossed the peaches with the lemon juice in a colandar. I used only a very small dash of nutmet and a little over a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and also added 1/2 tsp. of a good mexican vanilla. I latticed the top crust and brushed it with egg wash and sprinkled sugar on top and then baked as directed. We like our desserts cold and it was really good after being in the fridge overnight.

Oh My Gosh this was an awesome pie!! I have never tried my hand at peach pie before, but I used some peaches from a tree in front of my apartment. I followed the recipe exactly, except I sprinkled the lemon juice over the peaches in a colander. I admit that I cheated on the crust, I made the bottom but used a roll-out for the top. I don't like pies that are too juicy or too sweet. This was perfect! I'm going to use strawberries next time.

This recipe is definitely going in my favorites, my entire family absolutely loved it. There were no leftovers. Next time it'll have to be 2 pies lol. I only made 1 change. My family loves crumble topping on fruit pies, so I used a basic oatmeal crumble topping with chopped walnuts instead of the traditional crust top. It was Delicious! :0)

Delicious! This was my first time making preparing this recipe. While cooking, it began to brown quickly so I covered it with foil. I had to bake it approximately 20 minutes longer than the recipe directed. Though the top crust cracked & isn't as pretty as I would have liked.... It's delicious!!

I used the lime in the colander trick and thought it added just enough, but not, over powering flavor. I used half a fresh lime and didn't measure if it got to 2 Tbs. i used the butter crust recipe and made a lattice. The lattice really helped to judge when the pie was done (middle bubbling too). I skipped the egg wash and left the crust plain, just my preference. I always cover the edges first and remove it near the end to let the crust brown. The cook time ended up being close to an hour to because I lowered the temp too quickly. I go by bubbles and crust color, so not a problem. The filling solidified very well and when I finally cut it, the pieces were not runny and kept their shape. (Most pies I make don't do that so I was impressed.) The peaches kept their color, flavor, and shape surprisingly well. Overall, a wonderful use of freh peaches.

This was my first attempt at peach pie and I made  three changes to the receip based on the reviews.  I used a colander as suggested to reduce the liquid, swapped out lime for lemon juice and brown for white sugar. It turned out excellent!!!  Peaches are in season so I'll be making this exact receip again and again. Thank you for all the reviews and suggestions.

Pretty great. Could use a little more brightness of flavor - but this may depend on the specific peaches used more than the recipe.

This is a great recipe. I made a few minor adjustments. First I cut the sugar to 3/4 of a cup. I know some said the lemon juice made it tart but I DID use the lemon juice and it was perfect. I DID NOT use a colander as some suggested to drain some liquid and the consistency was perfect ... It would have been too dry I think if I'd drained it this recipe had Just the right amount of flour. However, here is the major difference. The cook time listed was way too short. I lowered the heat after the time listed but it needed much longer to bake  and  get golden. I had to add almost 30 minutes more. Next time I'll bake at higher temp for about 30 minutes and probably another 20 at lower temp. But taste was the best!!

This pie is great! I used fresh peaches and a home made all-butter crust. Turned out awesome! The only thing I didn't different was use heavy cream instead of an egg wash. Thanks for the great recipe! This one is going in the box!

Georgia peaches soon will be gone, so I thought I'd make my "annual" fresh peach pie.  Seriously, I think this is the best peach pie I've ever made.  The only thing different that I did was add a couple Tbsp of Minute Tapioca because my peaches were very ripe, and I didn't want a runny filling.  Simply.the.BEST!

Great recipe! This was my first peach pie and I made them from peaches I just picked from my tree. What a treat. Easy recipe and delicious. I used a mountain of peaches so I had to cook the pie 12 minutes longer.

This pie was absolutely delicious! I had to use canned peaches since it was winter here so no peaches. The only thing for me is i would've liked more peaches so next time all add more! Otherwise it was incredible!

A tasty pie with a few alterations needed.I changed a few things. I used lime juice (only 1 Tbsp) and used a colander to drain them. I added a tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp ginger. I omitted the nutmeg and put a tad more cinnamon. I used brown sugar instead of white. The pie was not runny and quite tasty. Might add a bit more vanilla next time.

One more review. This is everything a old fashioned homemade peach pie should be.
I made a huge 15 inch pie keeping the amount spices and sugar the same. So I can not say I followed the recipe exactly but everyone loved it.

I made this pie yesterday and the only change I made was I omitted the nutmeg since I am not a huge fan. The pie is spectacular, the only thing I might try next time is a slight reduction in the amount of cinnamon. The Vietnamese cinnamon I used did slightly overpower the taste of the peaches. I used the flaky butter crust recipe off this site with a small amount of cake flower instead of using just all-purpose (1 cup AP and 1/4 cup CF per crust). Also, I used some butter flavored shortening in place of 1/3 of the total butter. Crust and pie turned out amazing. I also followed some tips from the reviews here and baked it on the lowest rack in my oven. I moved it up and finished it the last 10 minutes on a higher rack to brown the top crust. It took a total of 10 minutes at 450 and 45 at 350 degrees.

Absolutely wonderful and so easy. I used thawed, homefrozen peaches, but I made sure all of the juice from the peaches was drained off before putting in the crust. Came out beautifully.

Only use a pinch of lemon not as much as the recipe calls for so it tastes much sweeter. I do not use nutmeg either and I use two cans of peaches.

To be honest, I've never made a good peach pie until trying this recipe...it was perfect!  I did not change or add an ingrediant and the pie was firm but soft, with no extra juice making a mess in the pie pan.  I, too, poured the lemon juice over the peaches, gently stirring while the juices drained out of the colander.  I let it drainn while I prepared the flour mixture...worked great!!!

Outstanding!  Used ripe Texas peaches and squeezed one lime (instead of 2 tbs lemon juice) over peaches.  Everything else was the same as printed.  Will make again every year when the Texas peaches ripen in July/August!  Thanks for this recipe.

Easy Peasy!  I followed some of the other suggestions about reducing the amount of sugar by 1/2.  The peaches were already perfect. I also let my sliced peaches "rest a bit" in the lime juice and "bit" of bourbon.  After a few minutes I drained the liquid and added the dry ingredients. One sample taste and I knew this was gonna be good!

I tried this recipe this week - I made my own pie crust but used this filling recipe.  It was the BEST peach pie I have ever made in 40 years of baking.  It was easy and the ingredients let the fresh peach flavor through.  Make it now while peaches are in season - you will not be disappointed.

This is what a pie recipe should be: simple and delicious.  Good cooks know that the quality of the pie is determined by the quality of the fruit.  I was lucky enough to have a bunch of peaches from my parents' peach trees, and they were phenomenal from the start.  They were VERY ripe, however, and rotting before I could eat them.  So I made this recipe.  I made a homemade crust (Martha Stewart's pate brise) and did what others suggested, to douse the peaches with lime juice in a colander.  Many of my peaches were overripe so I wanted to cut down on liquid by draining them, and it worked great.  Also, I HALVED the sugar in the recipe.  My opinion is that if the fruit is nice and sweet, not a ton of sugar is necessary.  1/2 cup of sugar along with the spices called for in the recipe and my pie is amazing!!

Stellar recipe to go by even if you don't follow it exactly. I didn't have enough peaches so I added a few fresh apricots to the 3 cups of peaches I had on hand. Also, I bought a 2-pack of Mrs. Smith brand Deep Dish pie crusts. Oh my goodness it was to die for. No vanilla ice cream needed either!!

I have made this recipe twice. I love, love it! I only had lime juice this time, so that's what I used. I made my own pie crust with wheat flour. The pie was gone by the end of the day. Thanks!

This was super easy with frozen peaches (thawed in microwave) and frozen pie crusts (also thawed).  Who woulda thought that we could have fresh home-baked pie in such a short time.  I will definitely make this again. The kids loved it and want blueberry next time. The only thing I changed was 1. a lot less sugar 2. added some cornstarch 3. Baked longer than 35 minutes.

TOO Watery!! Disappointed!! I made this recipe with high hopes because it looks so good. However it was to watery. When I cut a piece, the whole inside was not set, and had about 2 1/2 inches of liquid. I made my own pie crust, like several reviewers recommended. That turned out good and I will use 'Mom's Pie Crust' recipe again.

I didn't care for this. It was so liquidy that the crust was soaked through after sitting for one day. I had to throw most of it away. What I did eat was ok, but I wasn't crazy about the flavor.  Boyfriend didn't really like it that much either, and he will eat just about anything with sugar in it.

This would have been a perfect pie if the lemon juice would have been left out.  Lemon juice took the sweetness out and was too sour.  I will bake this pie again but without the lemon juice.  It took away the peach taste.  Baked up beautifully!

This was the first pie I've ever made!  I don't know anything about making pies as I am a complete beginner.  I followed the recipe exactly and the pie turned out great!  But I did forget the salt (not sure how important that is) and my pie was kind of runny so I left it in the oven quite a bit longer than the recipe said.  I don't know if the runny consistency was due to the peaches I used (which were fresh, not canned), or forgetting the salt, the lemon juice or just a difference in my oven temp.  Regardless, it still turned out great and I will make it again (and hopefully remember to include the salt next time)!

I just didn't really care for this recipe very much.  It didn't turn out runny, as others have said, but instead seemed to have too much thickening.  I know there is always a difference in the fruit, and maybe my peaches weren't as juicy as others.  I did use fresh peaches bought at a farm produce market.  I also tossed them in the lemon juice and drained them in a colander, as others suggested.  My biggest problem with the pie was the taste.  I just didn't care for the overwhelming nutmeg taste.  I love nutmeg, but it seemed to be a little too much for this pie.  I love a good peach pie, and I think I could use this recipe as a base.  But, next time, I'll omit the nutmeg and use my own judgment in deciding how much flour or cornstarch to add.

Made this recipe basically as stated, but substituted Splenda for the white sugar and omitted the butter.  The pie came out terrific, and I believe part of the reason was because I made a homemade pie crust.  What a difference!

This pie tasted wonderful, but I was disappointed in how it was a bit runny and made the pie crust soggy despite the egg and draining the peaches.  Maybe I just need some practice with it.

Yummy, but a homemade crust is the clincher. I made it with a lattice top (cut strips with a pizza cutter and a clean ruler to keep width equal and strips straight).

I made only half a pie in a small ceramic dish because I live alone.  This recipe halved well, despite the requirement of one egg (I simply skipped sealing with the egg and it was fine).  This was great, I'll make it again!

Great recipe. I did use 1Tbsp lime juice instead of the lemon, and a homemade crust. Other than that, didn't change anything, My peaches were not quite ripe and the pie consistency came out perfect. I could understand ripe peaches juicing too much.

After reading many of the reviews posted here, I was concerned about a runny pie.  As a result, I added a touch of corn starch along with the flour.  I also used half white/half brown sugar as many here suggested.  My pie turned out just fine.  This is the first peach pie I've made, and I'm guessing with peach pie, the kind of peach you use and the degree of ripeness determines the result, both in terms of sweetness and liquid.  My peaches were a little under-ripe. One more note: I didn't bother removing the peach skin, and it didn't seem to matter.

Incredibly delicious...huge hit. I used white peaches and I added a few frozen blueberries for color. It was perfect.

This was my first peach pie. I loved it!!  I did add blueberries as I didn't have quite enough peaches and upped the flour 1/2 tablespoon.  I always cook the bottem crust for about 10 minutes before adding the filling, keeps it from getting soggy.  It turned out just right.

The fresh peach pie was delightful but a bit too wet. I suggest (like other reviewers) to add the lemon to the peaches in a collinder and let some juices drip. Also, drain the peach mixture before adding the dry ingredients so it's not so wet. The fresh, warm peach pie was delicious!!!

I found the taste was VERY floury. I even backed it longer. The crust stayed doughy, not as it was to with the egg brushed on. Maybe a bit less flour next time..?

Wonderful pie,  I used the suggestion of keeping in the oven after done baking, turning the oven off...  it set perfect.  I didn't cut it until the next morning after sitting in the refrigerator-  no runniness.   Also,  I didn't add cinnamon or nutmeg,  but ginger because it seemed that would taste more summer-y,  and it turned out "Yummy!"     My boyfriend really likes this recipe also.   First time peach pie baker  :)     Also, I forgot the lemon juice,  but i think I would have added it, maybe 1 tbspn    if I were going to make it again,  which I will.  Thanks for the recipe!

This makes an awesome pie!  I made this for a summer barbeque and it was so perfect.  Everyone devouered it, there was none left.  I used a collander as others suggested when adding the lemon juice and let it drain out, great idea.  I would go easy on the lemon juice because I could taste it (but I don't think anyone else did).  The filling overall is to die for.  Perfectly sweet and not runny at all.  I don't know if I'll make peach cobler again - this peach pie is too good!

This pie is super easy to make and the flavor is delicious but it is too runny. I made it exactly to the recipe and could only remove soupy pieces, not wedges. Maybe more flour would do it.

Never made or eaten a peach pie before. A friend gave me a bag from his tree and I didn’t want to waste them. An amazing recipe! Have made six pies so far....and have frozen enough peaches for another six. Loved the pies!

I had made the recipe 3 times and it was great. The 4 th time it was runny. I finally realized that I had used whole wheat flour the first 3 times. It made all the difference.

Followed the recipe, and made no changes. The egg wash made the top crust shiny and hard. The filling was okay, but nothing spectacular. I had high hopes for this, but did not meet my expectations. Sorry  :(

Fantastic and very easy, I used fresh frozen, I omitted the lemon juice since lemon juice was used for preservation of peaches  (were from my peach tree and last years crop to make room for this years).  Delicious!

I cooked it the first time at 450 for 10 minutes then turned it down. It didn't turn out properly ( wasn't cooked properly, inside). The next time I made it I cooked it at 425 for 20 minutes before I turned it down to 350.  It was the best peach pie I had ever made. My husband raved about it!

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup granulated sugar, also did half flour and other half cornstarch.  Did the lemon juice in colander as suggested.  The time to cook was a lot longer than the recipe said-I’m pretty sure mine cooked at least 30-40 minutes longer; the pie was consumed within 1 day ....it was so good!

Delicious! I made this pie twice, the first time without the cinnamon and the second time with the cinnamon. The pie with the cinnamon was perfect:) I substituted corn starch for half of the flour and it was perfect when cut...no runny liquid. My husband was thrilled with this pie!

Wonderful pie.  The only change I made was I used 1 teaspoon of white vinegar (googled lemon juice substitutes) since I had no lemon juice and the pie turned out wonderful. Will make it again. Am wondering if I can do the same with fresh blueberries. I used the egg wash and it really made a pretty pie and kept the crust from getting soggy. What a great tip!!! Wish I could have taken a picture. My husband woke me up with his late night snacking and said that pie is great!!! He rarely eats sweets. Ohhh used a toaster oven to bake as my gas oven heats up my kitchen and it still worked great, I just had to watch the pie a little more closely and added 10 mins to the cook time.

Wanted and got some reassurance in making another peach pie. Knowing how, with memories of my South Dakota farmer grandfather's own baking expertise, I was glad to find that here.

Great recipe, but even better if you make a couple adjustments to it.  I made the following adjustments: 1 tablespoon lemon just (instead of 2), 1/4 cup flour+1/4 cup cornstarch (instead of all flour which prevents runny peaches), and most importantly I used homemade pie dough! So good :-)

This is my go to peach pie recipe, and I've adapted it to apple as well.  So easy and turns out perfect!  Well, it tastes perfect, but my crust skills aren't much for looking at, even with the roll out crusts.

The recipe calls for too much flower and corn starch.  The pie was more like a cake than a pie.  I suggest that you decrease the flower and corn starch by at least one half of what the recipe calls for.

Made this peach pie and was not disappointed.  After reading about the lemon issue, I used very little just enough to toss the peaches when I was done citing them.  Then I layered the bottom of the pie crust with the peaches and then the mixture and repeated this and topped with another pie crust... Awesome and perfect served with vanilla ice cream... oh I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.

- I used fresh peaches from the peach truck. The lemon helps cut the super sweetness. I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I did not have nutmeg so I used 1 tsp of cinnamon instead. I had to bake it for about 10 extra minutes until it was bubbly. One of the best pies I ever made. I really believe it was the peaches. Good fresh peaches makes all of the difference. I did not peel them, just sliced off any bruised area and proceeded with the recipe. The flour was enough to keep it from being soupy. I may have added a little extra as it initially looked wet and I am sure I used extra peaches.

Delicious !   Thanks BERNiERONE...this turned out great.  Live in Willamette Valley in Oregon where lots of fruits are grown commercially. Love to pick peaches at farms every summer.  Tried this recipe last year but it turned out runny as mentioned in some other reviews.  This year I tried adjustments that I had scribbled on the recipe last summer.  Used about 4 cups fresh peeled and cut Candor variety peaches. Put 2 Tbsp lemon juice, closed the lid on my tupperware and shook it to mix.  Then just half cup white sugar, fourth tsp salt, 2 Tbsp rum, half tsp cinnamon, fourth tsp ginger, fourth tsp cardamon,and pinch of nutmeg. Instead of flour for thickener I used: 5 Tbsp regular Clearjel mixed together with the sugar and spices. Shook again to mix.  Drained juice off with strainer.  Put peaches in parbaked bottom crust.  Looked kinda dry and lonely so I added back about a half cup of the juice I had just strained off. Still was very worried about having pie soup like last year.   Used a plain floating crust on top of butter dots, with egg wash (1 egg scrambled with fourth cup water). Sprinkled with demerara sugar.  Baked middle shelf in 9" glass pie pan 60 min at 400 F, with foil covering the edges.  Planned to decrease oven down to 350 after first 10 min, but forgot !  Was checking every 5 min toward the end of hour.Your pie can really take the heat.  Cooled at room temp then fridge overnight. Just tried a piece: perfect peachy flavor and color; perfect texture not runny at a

Really turned out great even though i sealed the crust prior to adding the butter. We bought some Campbell, MO peaches and had too many so we decided to try this recipe. Will definitely make it again.

Excellent pie, just like mom used to make.  The prep was incredibly easy and quick (minus peeling and de-stoning those darn peaches, but that comes with peach pie, doesn't it?).  I got nothing but raves and I followed the recipe exactly.  The crust turned out beautifully brown and I had no trouble with burning.  I will end up making this again and again- thanks BERNIERONE!

Great recipe. Much like my mother used to make.  Not sure why they bake at 350 degrees. I bake most pies at least at 400 on up. Ratios of spices and sugar excellent! Yummy!

Delicious! My husband has desired a deep dish peach pie for about 3 to 4 years and we haven’t been able to find one.  So, I decided to just cook him one.   This recipe was easy and exploding with down home flavor which store pie lack.  Momma would be proud : )..

I loved the result. It was so delicious. It was easy to make. It will be my favorite. I did do one thing different..I did not peel the peaches as I felt it would provide more flavor and texture. It was wonderful.

Too much sugar.  I used white peaches that were nicely ripe, and they cooked down to a sludge.  Next time I'll try it with half the sugar and less baking time.

My pie turned out amazing! I did  not use any lemon juice or egg white on the bottom crust. I did bake the pie 5 additional minutes and let it sit for 1 1/2 hours before serving and it was perfect. It held together beautifully and so much flavour to the pie. I was little concerned initially as a few of my peaches were still quite firm when I was preparing them - but turned it regardless.

The cinnamon and nutmeg seasoning made it taste much more like an apple pie, so my kids weren't too thrilled about it.  We'll still eat it, but I wouldn't make it again.

I have made it twice. The first time I forgot to add the sugar to the peaches. I baked it following the directions and the bottom of the crust didnt bake at all. 

The second time I made it: I added not only nutmeg and cinnamon, I also added vanilla bean paste. I also remembered the sugar. I also blind baked the bottom crust. It turned out perfect

I followed some of the suggestions; lime juice over colander, 1/2 the sugar, use butter flake pie crust. 1/2 cup sugar was not enough and the peaches were some of the sweetest I've ever tasted. Maybe it was because of the lime juice. I will try to make it again. Pie crust was a bit dry after cooked, should have used more water.

Wayyy too sour. Next time I would probably use 2 tsp instead of 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Everything else about the pie was great though. I used chef Johns (YouTube foodwishes) method of draining the peach juice after soaking soaking in lemon juice and sugar then reducing it and reintroducing into the peach/dry mixture to ensure a non runny pie. I used Trader Joe’s pie crust which came out amazing and so close to homemade (but so much easier!)

I’ve never given a negative rating on All Recipes but I’ve also never had a pie turn out this horrible. It was more runny when it came out of the oven than when I put it in. Not nearly enough flour  is called for in this recipe, or it would do better to have cornstarch as a thickener. What a waste.

This recipe must be baked at least an hour longer than called for to keep it from being runny! The flavor is great, but the baking time is WAY OFF. Add an hour to bake time and you’ll be ok!

I love this pie! I made 2 of these the first time and gave a piece to a friend and her mama, who is 93. When I next saw the older woman she complimented the pie. She said that she knows she forgets many things but she wouldn’t ever forget how much that pie reminded her of her childhood- it tasted just like her mama’s wonderful pies. My thanks to the person who gave this recipe. It's allowed me to give a true gift to others.

I totally agree with rosieforpres!  This is the best peach pie I have ever had! ???? Very ripe peaches and a homemade scratch pie crust are the keys. ??????????

I used frozen pie crusts from Trader Joe's and they were perfect for this pie.  I actually added some blueberries because I had 6 peaches but it wasn't quite enough so  my husband said "Why don't you add some of the fresh blueberries?" so I did.  It was delicious!!! Took a little longer to cook..I think because the pie crusts were thicker.  I will make it again!!  I did put the lemon juice in but just squeezed the lemon in there..didn't measure 2 tablespoons.

I was nervous to make this recipe as I had super ripe, fresh picked peaches that were quite juicy and I was worried the pie would be soggy. Happily, the pie turned out great and I would make it again

I made this pie for dinner. it is very easy to make. The hardest part is peeling the peaches. For me it was a bit too sweet, but this all just depends on individual taste. Everyone seems to like different levels of sweetness.

For me, next time, I will cut down the amount of sugar to 3/4 of a cup. It is easier to add sugar than take it out. 

Not sure why the controversy on lemon juice. Unless you way over do it, you will never even taste it. Its only there to keep the peaches from browning.

I think next time I will also substitute all, or part of the white sugar with brown sugar. It might give it a bit of a richer flavor. Other then these 2 things, it is very good and I wil make it again

This was very good but a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll add less sugar. Following others advice I skipped the nutmeg as I'm not a big fan and I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the flour. I let cool to room temperature and it sliced beautifully - not runny at all. I also brushed the pie crust with only the egg white. I'm definitely making again.

My husband is the baker and made this pie. It was amazing. We used allspice and cinnamon, and turbinado, white and brown sugar (1/3 cup each) . The lemon juice is essential if you  prefer your pies on the less sweet/ tart side. It's the best peach pie I've ever eaten.

This is a very tasty recipe.  Maybe because of the peaches I used, it was really juicy.  I am going to make it again,  but this time I am going to add a tablespoon of tapioca and  a little cornstarch into the mix.  Also I used a deep dish pie pan and I think the bottom could have been cooked more,  so I will increase the cook time.

Good, simple recipe.  Used flour and corn starch for the filling.
But remember: the crust is as important as the filling...  ; )

Adding the flour made the consistency pasty.. Brushing the bottom crust with an egg wash did not help at all ....even after baking it for an extra 10 minutes.

I made two pies and they turned out just great!  I also kept the lemon juice...it keeps the peaches from turning brown.  A great thing I learned is to cut the slits in the top crust dough when it is folded in half, prior to placing it on top of the pie.  I actually cut 5 Xs with a sharp paring knife through both sides of the folded crust at the same time, making an even pattern on both sides.  After I brushed the top crust dough with egg, I sprinkled sugar over the top!  This is a great recipe!  Also, I used foil around the edges at the beginning (for both the 10 minutes at 450 and then 15 minutes at 350), and took it off for the last 15 minutes.  It's much easier to take foil off quickly when the pie is in a hot oven than to put it on.

I used 4 cups of fruit instead of 5.  The pie was still delicious!  I also used lime juice instead of lemon.  Cooking time was 25 minutes instead of the recommended 30-35.
So good - will make again and again!

This recipe comes out right every time for me!  So easy when you use premade crusts.  Tastes delicious..just the perfect recipe for new cooks and experts.  The only thing I don't do is use the egg wash on the crusts.

I must start by saying that I  am not a baker!
I thought this recipe was very good, even though I forgot to put the dabs of butter in it! 
We used fresh picked peaches which also were a great addition.
It was quite delish

Delicious.  Made changes as per other reviews.  added 2T cornstarch.  I drained 2 large peach cans in a colander, then added only 1T lemon juice, tossed and drained.  I used 1/4 tsp cinnamon and just used egg white for the beaten egg wash.  It was a favourite and was gone in a flash.  Will definitely  make this pie again, actually have requests for tomorrow......

Delicious. I added 1 more cup of peaches and 1 tsp of vanilla just before pouring filling into pie crust. I use the pioneer woman's perfect pie crust--it's my favorite. Instead of pouring the rest of the egg on the top crust at the end, I just brushed more egg wash on. I covered with a piece of foil the last 5-10 mins so the crust was not overly brown. A big hit at my house, and my husband is not big on desserts.

I will make this pie again, however I will cut the lemon juice in half.  I used the concentrated in a bottle and it was too strong.  I will also, increase the sugar by a 1/2 cup.  I left off the nutmeg, because I don't' care for it.

I made this pie recipe exactly as written, including tossing the peaches in lemon juice. I drained the excess liquid before adding the flour mixture.  The pie was not to sweet, and not to tangy-- just perfect.

I purchased a flat (10) peaches and they began to show signs of deteriorating but still not ripe.  I found this recipe searching the internet.  I cut blemishes off.  Halving the peaches to remove the seeds did not work so I cut sections around the seed and sliced the large pieces.  Flesh was hard (not ripe).   I then steamed the slices (6 cups) to partially cook.  Steaming worked great.  Followed the directions to the "T".  Came out perfect.  Best Peach Pie my Wife and I ever tasted.

First time making "peach" pie and it came out great! I wasn't able to find peaches in season so I made it from nectarines. I also added brown sugar and vanilla to the mix and boy is this yummy!!  My nectarines were not ripe so it took a while to cook down. If after the 35 minutes the fruit is still not cooked, place a large piece of foil over pie and cook for another 30 minutes. It didn't burn at all!

The flavor was very good, but I had to strain off some of the liquid before baking it and it was still runny after baking.  Next time I will decrease the sugar, increase the thickening or try to find some way to change the juice in the pie.  We did enjoy the taste and with adjustments I'll make it again.

OHH MY GOODNESS! !!  I have to say,  my very first time using fresh peaches and my peach pie came out AMAZING!  I followed the recipe ,but instead of using store bought pie crust;  I made my own. Was nice and flaky. Couldn't wait to eat it,  so i had a slice warm.  Topped it with French vanilla ice cream to cut the sweetness and boy did it taste good together!  This recipe is a keeper!

I made 2 two pies with this recipe yesterday with fresh peaches off of our back yard tree. It turned out great, just as written, although I didn't use all of the flour sugar mixture. Everyone loved it.

This was okay. 

I used fruit fresh because I didn't have lemon juice and used my own pie crust. Otherwise made as recipe called for. It's good but it's nothing to call home about. Honestly had I used a store bought crust it would have been SO bland. My crust has something sweet in it (store bought crust doesn't, as it needs to be usable for sweet or savory). My yummy crust and some vanilla ice cream saved it. I used local, fresh, ripe peaches. The flavor was blunted. It needed vanilla and probably less nutmeg. Something. Still. Pie is pie. Worth eating. Was not worth all the work.

It was delicious.  I don't know what others are referring to as "runny" as mine was just perfect. I used fresh peaches we had just picked up from the orchard, and I always make my own pie crust. Wouldn't change a thing.

I didn't have a full cup of white sugar, more like 2/3 of a cup so I tossed in a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar, just for good measure. I had no problem with the lemon juice, pie filling had great flavor. I've got a lot of peaches to use up so will be making at least a couple more pies. My only change is to perhaps use a little less flour in the filling as I would have actually liked the pie to have been a bit more juicy but definitely liked it!

This was my first fresh fruit peach pie made with my own home made crust.  I made it exactly like the recipe and it turned out excellent.  I squeezed a fresh lemon for the juice and it did not make the pie tart as I read in some of the other reviews.  The egg wash was something different for me, but I liked how the crust turned out.  My dad, mom and brothers loved it.  I've already cut up more peaches and froze them in the lemon juice for my next pie.  This is now my official peach pie recipe.

I made this peach pie recipe and since I am not a fussy eater I thought  it was good. I  also learned something too besides which i thought was  a good idea and i have not done before  when making pies and that was coating the bottom and sides of the crust with a beaten egg so it does not get soggy later. I am not a fussy eater and the only thing i did different was i only used 1 tablespoon of lemon juice instead of 2 tablespoons. I would make again.

Decreased the amount of Sugar to 3/4C.  I soaked the peaches with the lemon juice, then drained them before adding the dry ingredients. Made my own crust: 2 C almond blend all purpose gluten-free flour, 1 C regular flour, 1 1/2 tsp xanthan gum, 12 Tbsp butter, and 8 Tbsp buttermilk. Next time I'm going to try using all gluten-free flour in the crust. The almond flavor is a nice subtle touch. It was delicious.

Omitted the lemon, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious!  After the first 10 minutes, when I lowered the oven I put a pie crust protector on for the rest of baking 30 minutes (or you could use tin foil), the crust came out perfect!

Easy Prep; Fantastic Taste!! :D
This pie went in one evening - of course there were eight of us (7 adults + 1 toddler!). It was delicious. I use all organic ingredients, so I consider this somewhat of a healthy sweet. I added vanilla to the peach, lemon juice mixture (something my mother taught me) and  nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice were used in the flour mixture. Also, a cup of white sugar seemed a bit too much for sweetening so I used 1/2 cup organic white and 1/2 cup organic brown. I did not make the crust - but I used Immaculate pie crust (organic baking product). You may need to cover the pie after the first 10 minutes at 450 degrees; it browns quickly with the beaten egg spead on top. This is a lovely summer evening desert - with or without whipped cream or ice cream (although some in my family will definitely disagree!). It's fun and easy to make. I will be making this again! :D

I found this to be very good.  I made a homemade crust with a lattice top, which made the pie look extra nice.  I omitted the nutmeg(Just not a fan).  Instead of 1/2 cup of flour, I used 1/4 cup flour with 1/4 cup minute tapioca, the pie was not runny at all when done.  Brushing the bottom of the pie crust with egg before adding the peaches really did prevent the crust from getting mushy.  I have to disagree about the lemon juice, found that the peaches didn't turn brown and just the right amount of sweet and tartness.

This was a good recipe, pie was delicious.  Mine came out a bit too juicy - I misjudged the moisture in the fresh peaches I used and should have used more flour, but the flavor was perfect.

So good! I did drain the excess lemon juice before transferring to the pie plate, and I also omitted nutmeg because I didn't have any on hand. The only problem was the edges burned SO FAST. Once the 10 minutes on the higher heat were over, the edge was almost black. I wrapped them in foil and kept cooking, but I had to cut the edges off before serving. Maybe it would help to cook on the lower heat for an extended time instead of beginning on such a high heat.  Regardless, still a delicious pie.

Definitely a good pie. As it cools juices will tighten up.Used combo of fresh lemon and lime juice. Cut back on spices a tad and added a little extra South Carolina peaches.My husband gave me his "look of love" as he was eating it.

I used this recipe for the filling only.  Used just a little bit of cinnamon as I didn't want it to taste like an apple pie.

I liked this recipe! Admittedly,  I used it as a base and jumping off point, though. I substituted half the sugar with brown sugar and substituted the lemon juice with bourbon. It gave a lovely, rustic and very Southern spin to one of my faves. Being from GA, we take our peach pie very seriously. I had a great time playing around with it!

It was delicious! I used 3 peaches and 2 granny smith apples. I will definitely make it again. Hubby loved it.  We used Shortcrust Pastry which we blind baked for 15 minutes before adding the filling. The result was delicious.

I use a homemade crust.  I substitute orange for the lemon juice.  I thank one of my friends whose family has a small peach grove, as she brings  me peaches every year.  I  prep the peaches and then freeze them.  I make this recipe several times throughout the year.  It always comes out perfect each time.

Make sure peaches are ripe and sweet. Pie will be as good as the fresh peaches you use. Great taste. frozen pie crust worked great. I always keep on hand in freezer for impromptu gatherings. To make cleanup a breeze: Place pie on baking cookie sheet lined with parchment paper to catch any drippings.   Enjoy!!!!

The filling was good and from a good friend I added some almond extract to the filling. The filling was good, the pie itself was super soggy.  Disappointed in Colorado.

Great pie to make with fresh peaches! I left out the nutmeg; added about 1/4 tsp of almond extract (I like almonds and peaches), used a homemade crust and baked it in a stoneware pie pan. This was great except it was a bit runny. I am thinking maybe I need to cook it a bit longer next time. I did add about 1 Tbsp of corn starch to hopefully counteract this but it didn't work very well. Will definitely make this again!

We liked it. The peaches I had were very ripe and sweet. I followed the recipe for the sugar content and the pie was a little tart. We were both surprised at the amount of tartness.I will try it again. It was good just not great.

I loved it! I used a little less lemon after reading the reviews but still wanted some acid so used about half. I added a smidge of ginger and used less of the nutmeg. Overall, it was easy and delicious. LOVE!

This was a great pie, first time that I had tried baking a peach pie. I followed the instructions and the other reviews, the few things that I changed was using 1/2 amount of sugar, lime juice, 1/4 cup of corn starch and 1/4 cup of Kraft minute tapioca, I had no problem with being too runny, it was very firm. I did not drain the liquid from the pie before I baked it. My wife really enjoyed it and I will make again.

First time I made this was for thanksgiving very simple and easy to do! My family loved it !  I decided to make it again just to fulfill my craving for dessert. Absolutely perfect! I will continue to make it this way. However I use canned peaches and put it into a strainer and put the lemon juice over the peaches so the it wouldn't be too much liquid when I pour it in the pie crust! Must try !

I loved this pie and I get rave reviews for it all the time.  For me (a novice baker), it was easy and simple to follow and bake, I also followed the advice of the reviewer who suggested the Colander.  It actually turned out perfect!

This was delicious. I added the lime juice as I sliced the peaches and put them in a bowl. Then I drained it in a colander, put it back in the bowl and added the combined dry ingredients. I liked it this way as there was a lot of juice and the pie would have been very runny. I would add a bit more sugar. Not very sweet. Otherwise, I will make this my go-to peach pie filling when I have fresh peaches on hand.

Everything for this recipe worked out well. My only recommendation is to cut down on the sugar as it was way too sweet for me. I would use 1/2 the amount next time. (My peaches were ripe but not overly sweet so I didn't think cutting the sugar would be necessary.

This was fantastic. Loved it. Used Trader Joe's pie crust about 1/2 the nutmeg  and substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for 1/2 cup of the white sugar.

Pie toooooo juicy.  I'm looking for a recipe that the filling isn't soupy.  I followed the directions except for making my own crust but that wouldn't effect the filling I don't believe.

Definitely do it justice by making your crust! I added 1 more cup of peaches & added a teaspoon of almond extract. Which is what my Southern Mother always does. It is beautiful & delicious conjuring up days gone  by. Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Nothing screams the beginning of autumn in New Mexico like roasting green chilis & hot peach pie.

There was alot of peach juice when I cut into the pie. I followed the recipe just as listed.  What should you add to make it thicken?  I didn't let it bother me as it was more like a cobbler.  Just reheated and added a scoop of icecream.

Made this peach pie today and it was delicious!  This is the first time I ever made peach pie and was so happy in the way it turned out! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect! My kids at it all up and asked for seconds so couldn't have asked for anything better.  Will definitely make this pie again!

This was my first peach pie. After reading reviews I was really concerned about it being runny. However, I followed recipe with very few changes and turned out great. I put peaches in colander and used lime juice instead of lemon. I dumped peaches into pie crust then mixed dry ingredients and poured it on top of peaches without mixing. Brushed bottom and top crust with egg wash. Followed baking instructions exactly. When the pie was finished I pulled it out and set it on top of stove for about three hours (while we took off to swimming pool).  When we came home I cut a small silver and it was perfect! The pie had set up nicely, and because I didn't mix up the dry ingredients it left a semi-crunchy topping just under the crust. Very yummy and so easy.

I thought I was making this pie for my guests. I'm not really a pie person, but the tartness of the lemon really kept it from that cloying sweetness so many pies have. Probably my new favorite desert.

DELICIOUS.  I actually used a mixture of white peaches and yellow peaches (wasn't paying attention in the grocery store), but I think it worked out great, the white peaches are not as sweet as the yellow. This pie was so good... I'm still thinking about it and dinner has been over for at least an hour. My 3 kids had 5 slices between them and have requested that I make this again next week. Did I say this pie is delicious?

My pie turned out pretty well, i followed the advice of other by allowing the peaches to drain ( i used frozen) and I also followed the suggestions of others by increasing the thickener, I used 1/2 starch and 1/2 flour as someone else suggested.  In all I added an extra 3 tablespoons, I added so much because I added 4 tablespoons of rum. Also, once I filled the crust, i realized I needed more peaches and grabbed another 16 oz bag from the freezer (I thought) after they were thawed, I realized they were mango's not peaches, since they were thawed, I threw them in anyway.  I was worried that baked mangos would be slimy and mushy, but I was wrong, it added an extra layer of peachlike flavor to the pie and made it even more yummy.

I just made two (2) pies,using this recipe.  I have tried a slice from one that just came out of the oven, and I have to admit it was a little too warm.....but excellent!  I don't think you can taste the lemon juice at all, and I also didn't peel the peaches, and they came out nice and soft.  Excellent recipe!

Yes.  This recipe was wonderful.  Let the peaches sit in the juice and then used a slotted spoon to place in pie. Added more peaches than recipe calls for too.  Of course, we're using Jersey peaches and they're in season right now. We always add a tsp of cornstarch too.

Didn't use an egg or flour, peaches are so juicy, just need the sugar, lemon juice, and spices, I added nutmeg, ground cloves, and a touch of cardamom. It was such a thick liquidy consistency I didn't need butter either, but only with very fresh and ripe peaches!

Wonderful recipe! It set up perfectly the next day. I had thrown away the recipe after I printed it then came back frantically trying to find it. It is a keeper!

I found this very flourey...and a little too much lemon, even with draining the peaches in the colander. I don't think I'll bother making this again

After reading reviews, used only 1/3 cup of flour and less than 3/4 cup of sugar and still found filling too stodgy and too sweet. Could hardly taste the peaches and therefore would decrease flour and sugar further and hope for perfect balance.  For what I could taste, spices seemed Goldilocks appropriate.  Cooking time was perfect.

This was my first peach pie, and I liked it!  I added some finely diced cystallized ginger, and made a lattice top. I also used lime juice on the peaches.  It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, the filling was thicker that I thought it would be.  But it's great with vanilla ice cream!
