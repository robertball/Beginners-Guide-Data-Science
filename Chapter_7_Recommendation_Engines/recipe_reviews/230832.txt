Made this tonight and really enjoyed it.  I used a red pepper instead of green and didn't add the caraway seed since I didn't have any and it was still very flavorful.  My husband added brown rice to his because he thought it needed some rice or pasta with it, but I thought it was filling and tasty without it.  Also, I just cubed the chicken before I cooked it to save some time instead of taking 20+ minutes to cook the chicken breasts whole and then slice them up.  I'll definitely make this again.

Tasty! BUT, I did not have caraway seed.  I made it the night before and instead of adding canned tomatoes, I topped the dish with cut up fresh tomatoes just a few minutes before serving so they were just warm and it did not make it another tomatoe meal.  Really enjoyed the Paprika flavor.

I used a red pepper instead of green, and I used 1 TBSP Smoked paprika and 1 TBSP sweet paprika. I did add the sour cream. I kept the spaghetti squash separate, so that diners could choose pasta or squash. I prefer it over the pasta but man is the chicken mixture delicious. Even my two boys love it.

Made exactly as recipe states with the exception of Greek yogurt for sour cream. Absolutely delicious, 
The technique for roasting the spaghetti squash is brilliant, yielding
 "al dente" squash, this is the only way to cook spaghetti squash

I thought this was an easy meal to make and had a lot of taste. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to eat a meal with 100% fresh foods. We are always on the look out for non processed foods.

Having never cared for Caraway seeds, I have never made this recipe with them in it.  I also cut down on the amount of chicken, only 2 breast halves instead of 3.  I like the emphasis to be on the spaghetti squash more than the chicken.  Very easy recipe and filling too.

Loved it! Great tasting healthy dinner and easy to make. Cooking the squash whole worked very well making the squash perfectly cooked not too mushy or dry. Only change would be adding tomato paste for thicker sauce.

This was excellent, my wife and I both thought it was delicious.  The caraway seeds added a great unique flavor to this recipe.  However whenever I use spaghetti squash in a recipe I always microwave it to save time and never bake it in the oven.   Simply cut the squash in half  (NOT LENGTHWISE), scoop out the seeds then place half at a time in a bowl with a bit of water.  Microwave 7 or 8 minutes then repeat with the other half!  The squash is ready to use in fifteen minutes and your oven and kitchen are still cool!  Save time by cutting up the other ingredients when microwaving the squash.

Delicious!!! I cheated a bit; I had some precooked grilled chicken I wanted to use up (from Trader Joes). I used a frozen mix of bell peppers and onions too, in addition to a whole onion. Because I had a good size spaghetti squash, I felt it was a little dry and added some extra plain tomato spaghetti sauce for moisture mostly. I love the mix of textures and flavors, and my 7 & 9 yr old boys and hubby LOVED it. And so much healthier than the pasta dish equivalent!! Only about 300-335 calories per serving, very filling and satisfying. Will definitely make again.

I made the recipe as written except for I swapped out the whole tomatoes for diced tomatoes as I didn't have whole on hand. My whole family thought this meal was delicious. Thank you for this healthy meal!

This was very good.   I cut the raw chicken in about 1 inch chunks to make it easier to cook and eat. I also used smoked paprika.  Very good.

Thought this was bland despite using smoked paprika, extra caraway seed and used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. Although it was  first time I made spaghetti squash, both my husband and I didn’t care for it.

I used pre-cooked grilled chicken strips and a can of chopped chilies as I didn’t have a bell pepper.  I also added some crushed red pepper for zing.  It was super easy and really tasty. Hardest part was scooping out the squash. The caraway seeds reminded me of sauerkraut, and I may try adding a little vinegar and brown sugar to enhance that even more next time.

Overall it was good, however there are some changes I will make next time. I think precooking either the squash or the chicken in the oven would be better. Also I think the squash shold be cooked a little more,  no caraway, one tbs of paprika not 2. And finally I added some spiraled zucchini, carrots and some parmesan. Delicious!

I loved this recipe, but because I bought a 4 1/2 pound spaghetti squash, I had to change some things.  Instead of whole tomatoes, I added 2 14.5 ounce cans of diced tomatoes, because when I added the squash, there was no liquid!! I added an additional tablespoon of paprika, and at the end, added an additional 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I also used two breasts of a cooked rotisserie chicken.  My husband and I loved it!! Will definitely be making this again!!!

Ok, needed some more flaver.  Made it again and changed carroway to fennel and added 1 tablespoon of cayanne pepper along with the 2 of paprika.  Next time, if I make it again, will reduce to 1 teaspoon of cayanne and add a little greek or itallian seasoning.

This was really good, teenagers loved it too. I wasn't sure about the quantity on the spaghetti squash so I bought 4.5 lbs. Could have increased it as I would have liked to have had more.  Sour cream pushed it over the top.

Husband and baby loved this! I thought it was pretty good. The sour cream completely changed the dish so I suggest trying it with and without and then deciding whether to add it. It really brings out the taste of the caraway seed, which apparently my ten-month-old loved (he only ate the chicken until I added sour cream and then he devoured everything.) I don’t adore the licorice-like taste of caraway seed so this was a drawback for me - but I did like it creamy. As another reviewer suggested, I sliced up the chicken before cooking it for a quicker version; I felt this was great for coating the chicken in flavor too (I added a touch more oil at that point to better coat.) To make this low sodium, I omitted the salt and used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Definitely tastes better with some salt added but bad for baby. I snuck some garlic salt onto my serving behind Bubs’ back after trying my low sodium version. :) Next time I will double both the onion and the garlic, but we’re sort of crazy about both and probably overdo it for most people’s taste.

Too much paprika. And I love paprika. But this was just too much.

I made a few adjustments to this recipe since I didn't have an onion or a green pepper. I added spinach and used a few smaller peppers of different colors. It turned out amazing.

I was out of paprika so I used tumeric instead. I added some sliced mushroom and diced yellow squash. I layered the spaghetti squash on the bottom of a casserole dish and covered it with the chicken miture. I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. It's a good dish for spaghetti squash and next time I'll use paprika.

Amazing!!! Made as the recipe directed. But I cooked my squash in the microwave because it’s faster that way. And we added mushrooms because we had them. Sooooooo yummy!!!

This was a savory variation on the usual Italian spaghetti squash recipes that I really enjoyed. I grew a lot of squash this year, so I've been trying a lot of recipes. I haven't had a bad one yet. This is one of the best, but I have to say the presentation is a little off putting. The paprika kind of makes everything the same color, but it tastes good.

Great recipe for spaghetti squash. Being the only person in the house on the paleo diet makes dinner interesting sometimes. This one was universal. Everyone really enjoyed the flavors with the squash and would even like it without the chicken. I split the squash in half, scooped out the seeds and coated the inside with olive oil before roasting face down in a 425 degree oven for about 40 minutes. I think it shreds better that way. Also used red pepper instead of green and added more salt and pepper along the way to taste. Fantastic recipe...looking forward to leftovers.

Super delicious. Awesome dish to break out of the normal routine. My husband only eats Mexican or Italian so he really enjoyed this and now I can finally change things up a bit! I used penne instead of the squash because by time I got home from work I just didn't have it in me. I was starving lol. I did use the sour cream I liked it. I probably tripled the rest of the seasonings and I used a half of a yellow red and green pepper.

This is a great recipe.  Even my husband who cringed when I bought the spaghetti squash loved it :) 
I doubled the recipe the grandchildren love spaghetti squash, so added quite a bit more chicken (4 adults, 2 teens, and 2 children). 
Recommended change: I used half reg. paprika and half SMOKED  paprika...really sparked the flavor. Also I added more caraway seeds...wow when they hit the dry skillet they let out such aroma and flavor. 
Would I make it again?  Yes, I can't wait to make it again.

I had to omit the garlic, due to living with a vampire.  I did not have whole tomatoes so used diced.  I apologize for only giving a 4-star rating when I did not follow the recipe exactly, but this recipe is kind of bland (I don't think the garlic would have helped) and I didn't appreciate the method of cooking the squash.  Removing the seeds after the squash was cooked made it a lot harder to separate the "waste" from the meat of the squash.  This was definitely worth making but it does need some modifications.

Really delish!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.  I didn't want the chicken to be dry.  Definitely a keeper.  I do recommend that you make certain you use Hungarian Paprika for the full flavor.

It was on the right track but just didn't quite hit the bar. The flavor was lacking in strength, though maybe leftovers will taste better. We made it as written but next time I think I would cook it without the chicken and serve it as a side dish. It would complement something well but didn't stand out on its own.

I really liked this idea, but not this recipe.  Like many others I found there wasn't nearly enough liquid to "simmer" so I added a cup of chicken broth and didn't drain the tomatoes.  I like caraway seeds, but didn't think they added to this dish.  While enjoyable there is a lot of room for improvement.

Followed all instructions but added a pre-cooked broasted chicken, because of the seasonings it holds. I also added sliced turkey sausage that has cheese in the inside. It turned Out perfect and taste so delicious!

I can't stop making this..although I used zucchini and did the spiral cutting (much faster)..and still as tasty.  I never used caraway seeds before either, but it's a MUST!  I have pasta eater and he loves this, and wants me to make it all the time.

This was delicious!!! Like many others I omitted the caraway seeds. Also, I used red pepper instead of green. And substituted sour cream for plain Greek yogurt. 

My only change would be to roast the squash at a higher temperature, hopefully for shorter overall cooking time as that part really dragged out the process. After cooking per the recipe, it still needed another 10-15 mins of cooking after cut open and it was on the small size (2 lbs).

I didn't care for the flavor or texture at all... it was bland with random bits of caraway seed thrown in.  Also, I found the directions a bit confusing.  There was talk of "simmering" and "boiling", but there wasn't ever enough liquid added to really do either of those things.  With only a bit of olive oil and drained tomatoes, it was pretty dry.

I didn't really care for this.  I think the caraway seed was part of my problem because it tasted a little like licorice.  All of the family was hungry an hour after eating this.

This recipe was great, especially knowing you were eating a healthier vegetable alternative to pasta.  We didnt use caraway seeds, but we did add a bit more salt and the taste was spot on.

Followed the recipe and it is amazing! I kept trying to incorporate spaghetti squash into our diet, but we never enjoyed it. I'm making this tonight for the fourth time in 2 weeks. We all LOVE it-even my picky 3 year old :) thank you, thank you, thank you for this crazy great recipe!

Very good! I am on the Paleo diet and this was one of the best recipes yet. It's very hard to find a spaghetti squash recipe that uses chicken and veggies. It had a great taste to it and kept me full all night. I followed the cooking directions very thoroughly but did change a few things. First I cut the chicken up instead of cutting it diagonal. Secondly I diced up fresh tomatoes instead of using  the can. Lastly, i did not use caraway seeds because I didn't have any on hand. It got a thumbs up from everyone who ate it. I will be using this one again!

This was really good, a nice change from the usual fake spaghetti and sauce I've nearly made myself sick of. 
Like the other reviewer I did not have any caraway seed on hand so I omitted it, I thought it was great, but cannot comment as to if it would be better or worse had it been included. 
Otherwise I followed the recipe as close as possible. I did use red/orange pepper instead of green as that is all I have as DH doesn't like green.
Also I cooked the squash by halving it, scooping the seeds and laying it face down on a cookie sheet. I know it does well microwaving it as well and I don't think it would alter the recipe at all by altering how it was cooked before being mixed into the sauce.
