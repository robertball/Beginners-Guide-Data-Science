I like medium-hot chili while my family prefers milder.  So, I added a red and yellow bell pepper, took out the Habanero and fresh Jalapenos and replace those with 4 oz. of canned jalapenos.  Rather than the 3 cans of chili beans, I used 1 chili beans, 1 kidney beans, and 1 black beans.  Lastly, I also doubled the tomatoe sauce.  This resulted in an medium-hot, hearty, chili that when served over rice was excellent and whole family enjoyed!

This recipe was the best chili I have made in years.  I followed it exactly and was very happy with the level of flavor and spice.  Surprisingly not too hot!!!  Thanks so much.

Great Chili!  I used Miller Chill beer (with lime)...'cause gotta have one for the pot and one for me... Of course, the best way to top this off is with shredded Cougar Gold Cheese!

loved this recipe.  I made a few changes.  I used ground turkey instead and mixed all the spices into the meat before I cooked it.  I then added the onions and veggies and liquid and then simmered for two hours.  I left out the habanero because my hubby thinks they are too hot but the taste was still incredible.  Even my son said this is the best chili.  He loves chili.  I will make this from now on.

This was an AWESOME chili recipe.  I had to make a few adjustment due to lack of ingredients and personal taste. I omitted the green bell pepper (just not in to them).  I also omitted the habanero pepper because I couldn't find any at the local grocery store and insteadused 3 jalapeno peppers. For the beans I used one can of chili beans in hot sauce and two cans of chili beans in medium sauce.  I topped the chili with cheddar cheese, chopped red onions, and avocado.  My boyfriend must have told me he loved this chili more than 20 times this weekend.  It was spicy enough to tingle the taste buds and leave a little burn, but not melt your taste buds hot.  Perfect. Thank you!

You know, I don’t really like chili. I’ve always had to make it, however, because Hubs and my kids liked it.  In fact my grown son, a fine cook in his own right, still says I make the best chili (go figure, I don’t like chili and I never taste when I cook).  That said, this is some of the best chili I don’t like that I’ve ever eaten!  Ok, I changed it up, but I only did so in a big way with the heat factor, cutting back drastically on all things hot because of Hubs’ sensitive innards – but the truth is I don’t enjoy food that makes my throat and lips burn either.   So that meant no cayenne or habanero, and just a teensy bit of jalapeno.  I guess it was essentially “sissy chili” but we loved it.  While I cut back on the heat I increased the beer!  I made half a recipe, which meant I only needed half a beer.  I don’t like beer so I wasn’t about to drink it but I didn’t want it to go to waste either, so it all went in the pot!  I used all beef, no pork, and adjusted the tomatoes, sauce, paste and water to get the consistency I wanted.   I also threw in a can of kidney beans.  Except for the beer and the cornmeal, this isn’t vastly different from how I make my chili, but then I don’t “simmer at least two hours” and “refrigerate overnight” before I serve it.  I can’t put my finger on what it is exactly, but this chili really comes together like no other – not too hot, tomato-y or chili powder-y, just a perfect chili with lots of body and character.  (COULD it be the beer?)

Even though I am a Huskie fan...this chili is great!  I made it for a Superbowl Party we had and everyone raved about it, coming back for seconds and thirds.  It was time consuming to chop the fresh ingredients, but it was worth it.  I prepared the night before and then put it in the crock pot the morning of the game...it was perfect!  Changes..I didn't use a green pepper and I used 2 cans of chili beans and 1 can kidney beans instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

This chili is spectacular!  I made it for the 2010 Apple Cup.  Even though it is fairly labor intensive, the reward is well worth it.  We ate it the day of, and it was still good, but it tastes much better the next day, as it is a lot thicker & heartier.  My Dad, who is an excellent cook, even admitted to liking this & saying how good it was!  This is definitely a keeper.

This is our new family favorite chili recipe!  I've made it a couple of times and thought the beer taste would be too strong for the kids, but it was fine and they loved it!  I used red and green peppers instead and went a little easy on the chili powder and it turned out great.

Made this for a chili contest and we tied for first place.  It was perfect - just the right amount of heat too.  Excellent flavor and it froze beautifully.  Great recipe.

We like a lot of meat, so I added in an extra pound of ground beef. I used red pepper instead of green and because I'm scared of handling real habanero peppers, I eliminated it and used one can of mild green chilies. I know it's not the same, but it's really all I had. I also used all black beans because that's all I had on hand. Because I didn't want it to be too spicy for my kids, I used california chile pepper, which has all the flavor of chili powder without too much heat. (You can find the california chile powder hanging from a j-hook in your "ethnic" section of your grocery store and it costs less than a dollar.) I did not add much more than a pinch of salt. I used all organic ingredients where I could. I threw everything in the crockpot and mixed it and let it sit overnight, then this morning, I've been letting it cook away. I've had a small bowl for lunch without sour cream or cheese and it's tasty, but I think it needs a bit more spices. I really wish I'd not added the cup of water as I think it thinned out the chili a little too much and watered down some of the flavor. If I make this again, I might add beef broth instead. It's a decent chili that adapts well for the crockpot. I think that the longer it sits, the better it gets which is pretty much true for most any chili.  I really like the combination of the pork and the beef in chili. I think that's just a winning combo. And dosen't beer go with just about anything? ;)

This recipe is incredible.  I served it for my group of women and they went crazy over it.  I made it the night before and then reheated in my crockpots... I made 2 batches.  I used jalapenos without the seeds and no habanero so I could have heat but not HOT chili.  It was so good.  It was even better the next day!  Definately a winner and I'll be making it again soon.

I was afraid to put in the amount of chili powder along with the peppers called for in this recipe, but it turned out to have just the right amount of kick.  I served this chili at my superbowl party and I had guests tell me it was the best they've ever had.  So don't be afraid of those jalapenos and habaneros!  Great recipe.

Really good chili recipe. I made it for the superbowl and everyone really enjoyed it. I have a standard chili I always make but figured I would try something new. Definitely worth it. Thanks for the great recipe.

Mmmm, great chili! I made it exactly as stated. Perfect amount of heat! I did feel that something was missing... some layer of flavor that I can't put my finger on. But this was really good nonetheless!

I am loving this!
I think the pork beef combo makes a big difference.
I set this up before work, leave on low in my crokpot for approx 8 - 10hrs.
Makes great leftovers too.

As a Washingtonian, I feel I have the authority to pronounce the "Wazzu (WSU) Tailgate Chili" both authentic and delicious!!!  I wore gloves when working with the Habanero and used my handy chopping mechanism for finely dicing all the onions, peppers and garlic.  The fewer veggies seen in chili, the better.  If you like more meat, add an extra pound of hamburger but don't even think about omitting the ground pork!  Next time I'll double this and freeze half.

I made this for a work party and they did everything but like the bowl clean.  I did change a few things. I used 2 onions, 2 bell peppers, 5 cloves of garlic, 1 can chili beans, 2 cans kidney beans, and 4 jalapenos, no habanero.  It is a staple at any sports gathering or party!

I was only cooking for three so I used just the lb. of beef, no pork. I used two jalapenos, but keep the seeds for heat, no habaneros. Only used two cans of beans (light red kidney). Didn't have cornmeal, was fine without it. I also chopped two stalks of celery. Used Yuengling beer and added a tsp. cocoa. Simmering chili for a couple hours and then waiting till the next day is hard to do, but well worth the great taste.

This is really GREAT chili, but be warned, it is hot.  I didn't use beer, instead substituted 1 can beef broth, otherwise I followed the recipe excactly.  Didn't refrigerate overnight - we ate it the same afternoon (after about 4 hours in a 200 degree oven).  Can't wait to taste the leftovers tomorrow.

Very good and easy even though there are mulitple ingredients.  I've made many times and eveyone always enjoyed it.  The only changes I made was to add a small can of diced green chilies in place of the habanero and jalapeno peppers and I only used one can of beans.  This has become our staple Saturday night dinner.

This was ok. Hubby & I agreed that the pork just throws the flavor a little off. Pretty spicy the first day(too much so for me) but it did mellow a bit by the 2nd day. Not a thick chili-pretty soupy after it simmers a couple of hours.

The meat to veggie ratio is not what I love, but the spice mix was excellent.  The second time I made the recipe, I added a diced pablano, used 4 garlic cloves and added an extra can of tomatoes and an extra can of beans.  I like it hot, so I used an extra habenero too!  Be sure to let it simmer to let the flavors blend!  This was an excellent base recipe to tweak to your liking.

This is a very good recipe for chili but I added about a cup of beef broth which I like in my chili.

I make this chili in the crock pot. I sautee onions and garlic in a pan then throw it in with the rest of the ingredients. Once the onions are in, I use the same pan to brown the meat. Then I just toss the meat in the crock pot with everything else and leave it on low or high. It doesn't matter. I can tell when it is done. The longer it is cooked, the better. Just don't leave it on high for over 8 hours without checking it. It might be fine if you did leave it that long but I have never tried it. 

This is the only chili I make. It was the first recipe I have tried out. I don't want to make another. I actually joined allrecipes just so I could review and rate this Chili even though it already has 5 stars.  

We eat it straight with some sour cream, onion and cheese on top until we get sick of it. The next couple of days we make noodles for chili mac. It is great with or without noodles. Noodles may be a good idea for those reviewers I have read commenting that this recipe was too spicy. Lots of noodles and sour cream can help a chili that's a little too spicy. 

Enjoy!!! I hope everyone that stops by tries it out! It is worth it. The way to a man's heart is through his stomach. (This follows for ladies too- so feed your woman!)

This recipe has won me a Best Overall Chili trophy at my work's Chili Cook Off two years in a row.  I use red kidney beans and black beans in addition to the chili beans, and I often can't find a habanero pepper so I use three jalapeno peppers.  Otherwise I keep it exactly.  Fantastic, wonderful, my go-to chili recipe.  =0)

Outstanding and my entire family loved it.  I cut back on the peppers.  I only used two jalapeños and it still had a small kick.  I mixed up all the ingredients and then put it in the crockpot for about 6 hours.  It was woven better the next day.

We absolutely loved this chilli.  We're in Texas so we added 2 habonero chillis along with the 2 jalapeno.  But the underlying flavor is really really good.
Thanks for the great recipie.

Great chili. I made adjustments to some of the proportions and added a few other spices (I like A LOT of heat) and it turned out perfect. This will be my go to recipe.

I won first place last night amongst a large pool of contestants- is there anything more that needs to be said?  Excellent, people stripped nine quarts of this while leaving others half to almost full- and the reason why is the medley of tastes.  I was highly reluctant to put the peppers listed in, because I was afraid it would be too hot for those who didn't like fire in their food; just the opposite.  I taste-tested it on a hot chili aficionado and one who was adverse to spicy food.  They both loved it, quoting the underlying flavors that were so fantastic.  It has a tiny bite but not enough to make anyone uncomfortable, even children.  Pepper it up more if you want but, as the prize tag said, this is the "most exquisite" chili available!

This recipe is FANTASTIC In Taste without the beans as well. I used course chili meat and ground sirloin. This chili to be used on tamales and other mexican dishes during the Christmas holiday. Real simple prepping. The key is the maranade of all the ingredients and seasonings cooked and then the overnight processed.  Foods always taste BETTER the next day because seasonings have time to marinade and blend.

Enjoy

Good recipe in general but....a TABLESPOON of salt? I read this, thought it must be a mistake, so put in a half tablespoon. That was still too much. With all the added salt in the beans and canned tomato products, I think a teaspoon would have been closer to the right amount.

This was the first chili I've ever made and everyone really liked it. I browned the meet and cooked the onions and peppers in a pan first but then I cooked it all in a slow cooker, came out awesome. I cooked it on low for about 8 hours.

Made this Chili for annual Halloween party.  Not one complaint for guests.  Only thing I changed was not using habenero peppers and used pre-cut jalapeno in the can.   Chili had just enough heat.

Wow!  Fabulous chili!  We all love chili when it's cold outside ... And this recipe was a hit with the entire family. I have made it numerous times now. It is also very forgiving so if you don't have (or like) something that is called for, just substitute something you do like!  I am whipping up a batch right now.  I always make a sweet corn bread to accompany this and the sweet and spicy are fabulous complements.  Thanks for a winner!

I've been trying a lot of chili recipes lately, and this one takes the cake!!  This will be my new recipe even though there's quite a bit more labor involved that most of the other ones I've made.  I omited the habenero pepper, and am glad I did, as it was spicy enough without it, especially for my kids.  GO COUGS!

I think next time I will end up not deseeding the jalapeños as I wanted a tiny bit more heat and ended up adding additional.  Instead of adding the cheese as a garnish, I threw it right into the mix.  Won me "best tradidional chili" at our mini cookoff.  Thanks!

This is a very delicious recipe and I'm looking forward to making it again this weekend!  What I like is that it has lots of good flavor along with the spicy aspect.  We prefer chili with no beans so I added another can of tomatoes, to make it more interesting and I doubled the peppers as we like it spicy.  I'm not one to measure too much but I think I followed it pretty closely....it was delicious!  It also froze well....it was a bit thick after being frozen so I added a small amount of V8 and a bit more jalapeno and it was just awesome.  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent chili.  My main reason for commenting though is I noticed several reviewers mentioned the jalapeno and habanero seeds as adding to the heat.  That is not true, the seeds in peppers have nothing to do with the heat.  Do some research on your own if you wish.  I just wanted to clear up that misconception.

Boise State fans at our tailgate party loved this chili.  But I added sliced and browned brats and used Leinenkugel's Classic Amber (Chippewa Falls, WI) instead of any old "lager-style" brew to jazz it up.  Now it also reflects my families Wisconsin roots.  So our version is called Bronco Tailgate Chili.  Go Broncos! (and Packers!)

I made this over the weekend and we loved it.  Probably the best Chili we have had in a long time.  For those of you that live in AZ and have access to Tortilla Flats Killer Chili Mix use a few tablespoons of this as your spice mix...incredible.

I just won our chili cookoff with this recipe.  I got some amazing reviews with it.  I ended up having to use Serrano peppers for the habanero (because I live on a small island in Alaska), and I did trade one of the cans of chili beans for kidney beans, but I followed it exactly otherwise.  Great recipe!

Very good and very easy to make. The local grocery store didn't have habaneros, so I used 3 jalapenos. I also substituted hot italian sausgae for the pork. Also, ginger ale insted of beer.  It was spicy but not too spicy. I won the best overall chili at my local church ward (out of about 15 chilis). This is definitely a keeper.

I give it 4 stars because it has potential, but it needed more salt and next time I would definitely skip the green bell. The flavor really clashed for me and my hubby. Another type of bell pepper would work better.  It was ok, but I like the flatlander chili better.

I've never had chilli in my life that I liked. I made this one and it was a hit! We kept it in our fridge and as the days went by, the flavor soaked in more and it tasted better.  Thank you for this recipe. I will make it again!

I made this chili for a superbowl party, and it turned out great! I will be using this recipe again and again. Some changes I made: 
1) Omitted habanero pepper, and only used one jalapeno, but added a little extra chili powder (I didn't want it to be too spicy for kids, or people who are sensitive to peppers)
2) Instead of using 3 cans of chili beans with the sauce, I used 2 cans of kidney beans and 1 can of pinto beans, drained and rinsed, and added an extra 3/4 cup of water (I wanted to keep the sodium down, and I like kidney beans in my chili)
3) I used an Amber Ale for the beer
4) I used the leanest ground beef and pork I could find (at least 90% lean) but I did not drain before adding to the pot.
Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious Chili without a seasoning packet. Exactly what I was looking for. I altered the recipe by only using one can of beans, one Jalapeno, and 1 tbs of chili powder. I also ADDED about 2 tbs of liquid smoke. I think the liquid smoke made it very unique and would definitely recommend it! Thanks for the delicious Chili!

Spectacular.  I consider myself an amateur chili connoisseur as I have made many chilis and am quite particular about not only flavor, but texture as well.  This chili nails both!  I cooked it in a crock pot for 24+ hours though, so that the meat really soaked up the flavors and spices.  This will be my signature chili for now; until I find a better one...

This is a good chili recipe! It looks like alot of work, but really it isnt. I used 3 fresh garlic cloves instead of powder. Years ago at a chili cook off people told me cinnamon is a secret ingredient. I put a small dash in and it really brings out the tomato and spice. I've made this recipe several times & have never been disappointed. It works in the crockpot too. Just cook up the meat with the onion & garlic. Throw everything in the pot, cook on low 6 hours. I like to make Jiffy cornbread with buttermilk to go along. The chili is good leftover made into frito pie or burritos.

This was fantastic! I am a Coug Alum, and shared this Chili with a couple other Coug Alumni the other night, everyone enjoyed it and we had a good time talking about our days in Pullman!   Thanks for sharing the recipe, my only advice is to wear gloves when handling the Habanero peppers! My hands were burning for a couple days, despite constant hand-washing!!!  Go Cougs!

Great chili. The only change I made was using ground venison instead of the pork. I don't like spicy foods, but this really isn't. A bit of bite to it, but no lasting burn. I have made it twice now, and will be making it again soon.

This is the best chili that I have ever made! I followed the recipe exactly, used fresh peppers from my garden, both red & green bell peppers as well as 3 jalapenos & 1 habanero. Great recipe, I have saved it here & printed a copy for my file.  Thanks so much for posting.

This is my new go-to chili recipe!  It is fantastic with great layers of flavor! Only changes I made were:  didn't have any fresh or jarred habanero peppers, so I used about double the jalapenos.  Next time, I will make sure I have fresh habaneros on hand because we do like it spicy!  We ate our fill of chili the first night... there was a little leftover, so a few nights later I made... CHILI DOGS!  YUM!  Also, since there are just two of us now, I cut the recipe in half (hubby is a BIG eater) but next time, I may make the full batch and see how it freezes.  Would be a quick and easy reheat for busy nights!  Thanks so much, GStorment!

Great and easy chili recipe. For my batch, I add an extra habanero and a couple serranos. I also replaces the ground pork with ground chorizo. And I don't drink much lagers so I've used other beers as well such as a pale ale or a lightly hopped IPA. Thinking about using a porter next time.

I've made this recipe multiple times. This is an incredible recipe. I made it without the beer and habaneros, and just added more jalapenos—six in total. My chili beans were red kidney beans, mexican chili beans, and garbanzo beans. I used Del Monte Diced Tomatoes, Chili Style. I added 2 cups of water instead of 1. I think that the secret of this recipe is the amount of chili powder and cumin. The cumin adds that special flavor that makes you keep reaching for the ladle to have another bowl, or three. It's got just enough heat to please the spicy fans, and if you want to cut the heat, just put a dollop of sour cream in your bowl. My friend used this recipe in a chili cook-off, and placed second. If you like a hearty, meaty chili, you cannot go wrong. Simply outstanding, and so easy to make. Next time I make it, I will definitely use a pale ale beer instead of 1 cup of water. Five solid stars.

A cool fall day,  football on tv, my husband's birthday, and lots of family and friends coming over : what else to make but chili?  This recipe earned me so many compliments-- and the best one of all was there was not a drop left in either crock pots.  I times 4 ed this recipe,  and instead of 4 lbs of hamburger put in 5 cause I like beef in chili,  and instead of regular ground pork,  I used 2 1/2 lbs of spicy Italian sausage.  Also,  I love beans and used a variety: chilibeans,  black beans,  dark and light and white kidney beans.  And having never used habenero peppers before,  when my husband told me they were so hot they would "change my life for half an hour"  I opted for fresh jalapeño.  Since I was times 4ing I used just four finely diced. I did think this chili was pretty labor intensive-- I was cutting 4 large onions for half an hour alone!  I cooked on the stove and for serving purposes transferred to crock pots the next day.  The chili had a lovely,  lingering heat to it.  It served over 20 and people were all getting seconds.  The little ones said it was too hot but it was a hit.  Delicious chili,  fantastic recipe! I'm glad that I snuck a little pot for my husband and I to have leftovers.

Our favorite! We're not super huge bell pepper fans so we skipped that, and instead of the super spicy habanero we used serrano. With the chili beans we used 1 hot and 2 mild, and instead of tomato paste and water we just used a second can of sauce.. since it's the same thing.. Other than that we stuck to the recipe, and it's always amazing.

AMAZING. I made this with my slow cooker (cooked everything on low all day). I also added green, red and yellow bell peppers and a bit more seasoning (we like our chili spicy). My husband said it was the best chili he's ever had!

This will easily be replacing my old recipe- perfect! I made the recipe as listed but had to substitute some of the peppers due to availability in the UK. It definitely had a kick but wasn't too hot! LOVE this!

This chili is awesome!! I was looking for a good chili recipe for a day of watching football and since I am originally from WA I thought I would try this one. The only change I made was 3 jalapenos because they didnt have habaneros at the store and added some crushed red pepper. It was perfect spicy but not too spicy. My very picky father-in-law LOVED it so I know its good.

It finally got cool enough to have chili. This was very good. I didn't refridgerate it before eating it. I didn't use the habanero. I also used beef broth instead of water. I let it cook for around 4 hours. I'll be making it again!

Only changes were using lean ground turkey & turkey sausage, & chopped fresh tomatoes rather than canned.  Very good; perfect amount of heat.  As is tradition in our family, I served the chili on top of macaroni noodles, then topped w/ the cheese.

My husband liked this more than I did - I would give it 3 stars.  Really didn't like the flavor when first made, but after sitting the fridge for a day, flavors melded and mellowed a bit.

This is an excellent chili recipe.  I do not like it hot so I skip most (and sometimes all) of the habanero & jalapena peppers.

I made this exactly as stated except I put it in the slow cooker to simmer for hours on low. We enjoyed it, it's a good recipe but I probably won't make it again. For a kickin' crazy hot delicious chili I'm gonna stick with the 5 star rated Hellfire Haberno Chili on this site. The flavours are more complex, and the chili is hotter. We liked it better overall. Next I'm going to try the 5 star rated Smokin' Scoville Turkey Chili and see how it compares. It would be nice to have 2 fantastic chili recipes to bounce back and forth with depending on the mood......

Delicious and simple.  Folks this is some REAL chili, not the runny bean soup some people call chili.  I make my own little adjustments to this recipe but for the most part follow it.  I'm not a huge spice lover so I leave some of it out, but the flavor is awesome!  Also, I mix it all together in my crock pot and let it cook in there for a few hours, then either eat or put in the fridge, either way it's perfect!

this is a great chili recipe! Made it last night and am enjoying for lunch today. Next time I make I will cut back on the salt...a little too much for my taste but overall a great recipe - one that I will certainly be using again. Thanks for sharing!!

This chili was excellent!  I was concerned about the spiciness of it as well, so I skipped the habenero and jalapenos and it turned out just right for me.  I also used ground turkey for a healthy substitute instead of beef.  I loved this chili and, most importantly, my husband likes it more than his mother's chili.  :)

This is very good chili. I was worried about the spiciness of the chili so I subbed a Serano pepper for the Habanero. It made a very mild chili that even me and my daughter could eat. I will make this again, next time I'm going to be brave and try it with a Habanero!

best chili ever just made a few changes,    i use only beef, I left out the beer and doubled the cornmeal, if you like it hot leave it the way it is  because its spicy {just the way I like it} , when I make it for my mom I cut  all the peppers in half including the cayenne. other then that it's perfect the way it is, I don't see much of a difference with the beer or the pork, I made it both ways so I just leave them out .  Great Recipe ! THANKS

Excellent chili! I use ground salsiccia instead of the ground pork and I add a can of Rotel.  I also add a can of corn (drained) every once in awhile.

This is going to become my base chili recipe. One thing I will do in the future is not adding the beans until the last 30 min of cooking time so they do not turn to mush.

Made this without the beer and pork.  Used frozen diced peppers & onion.  Makes a very good chili!

This makes a TON of chili with a lot of meat. I'm not used to such a meaty chili but my husband likes it.  I swapped the 1 lb pork with 1 lb lean ground turkey and followed the submitter's suggestion to liberally season the meat while cooking.  To make clean up easier, I drained the meat out of the pan with a spoon into a paper towel lined bowl, then I used the leftover fat and seasonings in the pan to cook the veggies.  I have small kids so I used 1 fresh jalapeno and about 1/4 c. diced pickled jalapeno.  It was still pretty spicy with the cayenne and jalapeno, so I may cut more next time for the kiddos.  I cut the beans to 2 cans instead of 3.  Otherwise followed all directions.  It does have a beer aftertaste that I am not totally sold on.  Next time I may cut the beer in half and add beef broth to make up the lost liquid.  I would also probably add a little more tomato sauce and maybe 1 1/2 lb. meat instead of 2 to get a little more "soup" and a little less meat.  Overall a good chili with good flavor, nothing bland about it.

My family and friends love this recipe!
I do not use habanero  and I use New Castle Beer or a Oregon IPA beer for more flavor.

This is the best chili I've ever had. I made it for football Sunday and it was a huge hit, everyone loved it. I did add more jalapeños and one extra habanero.  Everyone here likes things hot but even still it didn't set your mouth on fire.  Also the longer it's sits the better the flavor!! Awesome is all anyone could say and the pot was emptied!

Great recipe! I only add one or two jalapenos and omit the habanero. Hot sauce can be added per serving to suit ones liking. I also use two cans of chili beans and one can of black beans.

Chili covers a wide variety of possible flavors and dishes. This chili didn't stand out for being unusual in some way, just for being all around excellent as a red chili that is just what you expected, just done very well.

Loved this chili. Didn't have a habanero, so I reconstituted a couple dried pasillas, then used the broth in place of beer and water. Amazing. Spices are perfect. Thanks!

This is a  good chili recipe. One of my top 3 favorites, for sure. Has a hint of sweetness possibly from the beer. Really is better the second day. I like to top mine with shredded cheese, diced onions and sour cream.

Followed the recipe except I left out the pork. The seasoning was perfect for me - spicy without being too mild or or overwhelming - just right with great flavor!

I have made this recipe several times, and it's hands down the best chili I've ever had. I make it exactly as the recipe is written, no need to change anything. I've thrown in an extra jalapeno and habanero or two to kick up the heat. Either way, it's awesome stuff!My buddies have asked for the recipe and they make it and love it as well. GO FOR IT!

We LOVED this chili recipe!  My hubby adores chili and I like to try new recipes each time I make it; this is a definite winner.  I eliminated the habañero and cayenne because I was cooking for my kids too, and the spice level with the jalapeño and chili powder was just enough for us.  I liked the robust, rounded flavor and it was a very warming winter dish.  I also eliminated the water, since we like our chili thicker.  I did not add salt, since canned beans tend to be very salty also.  Thanks for a great recipe--oh, yeah: I browned the meats and then just threw everything into the crock pot for the day--PERFECT and EASY!!

Easy to make and tastes great.  Took this to a chili pot luck and got lots of compliments.  I toned down the spice by replacing the Haberneros with less intesne chili peppers at the grocery store.

I thought this chili was okay. I did change it up a bit. I made it vegetarian and left out the hot peppers. I basically kept everything else the same. What I really didn't care for, though, was the cornmeal in the chili. Even though, I let it simmer it still affected the texture and slightly the taste of the chili. I have put masa in S. American soups, and it worked. However, the cornmeal here was just really different and off to me. It was a little soupy also, but I assume that was from leaving out the meat.

I didn't have tomato paste on hand, so I used two boxes of Pomi - one chopped tomatoes and the other strained.  I used all ground beef.  I wanted to keep the heat down so I used a small can of green chiles, diced, instead of the habanero/jalapeno.  The seasoning mix is spot-on.  This was really good, a hit with the entire family.

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  For those of you that need to have a milder heat chili .  Just clean your peppers and soak them in 7-Up (not diet) from 20-40 min.  The longer you soak the milder they get.  Tip:  DO NOT drink the 7-Up afterward, it will hurt youuuuuuu!  hahaha

This was very good, but very hot - and that was without the habanero pepper! I used the 2 jalapenos and also used only 2 instead of 3 cans of beans which were plenty.  Also used 2 lbs ground beef/no pork.

I love this recipe, I made it exactly how the recipe said except I didn't have cornmeal.  I ground some dry sourdough bread and used that instead.  Also didn't have the hot hot chilies but otherwise the best chili I have ever made.  Thanks

Made a triple batch for a Tailgate party.  I did make a couple of changes due to guest sensitivities.  I substituted beef stock for the beer, halved the amount of jalapeno, and eliminated the habanero and cayenne pepper.   I served chopped jalapenos on the side for those who like more spice.  It was delicious, everyone raved about it.    Definitely make it a day or two ahead of time, it only gets better.   This is now my go-to chili recipe!

Very good recipe. Replaced my original 40 year old chili recipe. Didn’t have the raw jalapeños but thought the tame, jarred ones worked well.

This is my go to chili recipe. Everyone loves it! The only thing I add to the recipe is some Goya chipotle in adobo sauce and omit the cayenne. I like the smoky heat of the chipotle chili’s. This chili is amazing!

I've made this twice.  First time...I left out the habanero, and used less cayenne, and everyone loved it.  I tasted it before adding the beer and then after adding the beer....what an awesome difference it made!  Second time...i made it just like it said, and No One liked it.  It was just so spicy, we coudn't enjoy the actual chili itself. (note: we don't really eat anything spicier than franks hot sauce, and even that, if too much, will just ruin the meal for me.)  So....if you like hot and spicy, make it like it says.  If you like mild chili and are looking for a good taste, make a couple of adjustments and you'll have a great tasting chili!.

Thank you for the recipe, mine was boring and bland, noone liked it when i said chili is for dinner...but now they don't mind at all.

I have made many great chili recipes and I have to agree with the five stars for this one. Prep was easy and the end result is delicious. I've never used ground pork or cornmeal in Chili but both were excellent additions. I also refrigerated overnight and think it has a lot to do to bring the great flavors together. Will be making again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Changed it up a bit. I didn't use cornmeal. I only used beef after reading some comments saying the pork made it a bit off.  Also, recipe should specify lean to fat ratio (I know it's personal preference but good to note). I used 85/15. Chili turned out great!

Excellent recipe, and now my official go-to whenever anyone requests chili. My wife never used to like chili at all, but she loves this one. She usually just refers to it as "your chili," but I only wish I was the one to come up with the recipe! For anyone looking to change the heat, just change the amount or type of hot peppers, it's really pretty versatile, and always tastes great. But as is, it is hands down my favorite recipe (and I mean period, not just for chili!)

Very easy recipe!  It won me 1st place in a chili cook-off this year. I made a few minor tweeks, such as omitting the Habanero pepper, and using double the jalapeno instead. I also used a mix of fresh and canned tomato.

I substituted 14 oz. of Dr. Pepper for the beer!! I know it sounds crazy, but a very popular and much-loved  BBQ place nearby marinates their incredible BBQ in Dr. Pepper, so I thought I'd try it in this chili--and I omitted the beans. I also used a combination of ancho chili powder and southwestern chili powder (Central Market). I won my family's annual chili cook-off!!  Definitely make the day before...awesome chili!!

This recipe won me 2nd place in a chili cook-off (13 entries).  It is delicious!  Followed the recipe as directed.  Even my kids loved it and it wasn't too spicy for them (age 7 and 9).

Awesome. A few tweeks I added from other recipes I liked:  used Guinness, as another cook mentioned I used 1 can black bean, 1 can pinto, 1 can chili in medium sauce making it a "three bean chili ". Added a "pinch" of cinnamon, not sure why , but ANY tomato based anything is improved with a pinch of cinnamon.  And finally, 1/2 cup strong black coffee. Not sure what any of that does but this chilli was hands down the best ever.  The pot did not survive the day and I was ordered to make more. Oh yea, I used buffalo instead of beef but that shouldn't matter too much.

I debated between 4 and 5 stars, so I would probably go with a 4.5 if I could.  I make a lot of chili and have tried several recipes and this one is up there. One thing I've learned is, everyone has their own idea of what makes a good chili...taste is a personal thing. Not to mention, every chili recipe seems to taste different each time I make it...and from day to day. But I digress... I made Wazzu Chili and Boilermaker's Tailgate Chili at the same time, twice and preferred the BT Chili one time, then Wazzu the next. Go figure! In any event, this is an excellent chili and is well worth the effort.  As written, it would be too hot for me, so I did tame it down by using less of the chile peppers. I guess I'm not a very good (native) Texan because I'm a wimp when it comes to spice and I like beans in my chili! ;-) Oh well!  Like all chili, it tastes better on day 2 and 3 after the flavors have a chance to meld. Oh yes...be very careful with the chile's, I washed my hands twice and still got some in my eye. I've started using gloves from the kitchen supply store when I do my prep.

New favorite!  I forgot to wear gloves when dicing the chilies and had a serious case of "hot chili hands" for a couple of days after though  :P  DOH!  I made this with ground turkey and it was delish - I'm sure the pork/beef combo would be tastier but I wanted to make a healthier version and it totally worked.  The kiddo found it a bit too spicy for his taste, so I'll tone down the heat for him next time but I thought the bite was perfect as is.

Why I liked this recipe is because it did not wander too far off the traditional except for the beer and I used good ground beef not any pork.  and used fresh garlic rather than powdered garlic..

This Chile is rich and hearty served over jacket potato and topped with cheddar cheese..I love it the next morning reheated with a fried egg on top  for breakfast !!

This recipe is a great base to start from to modify and create your own recipe. I do mine with 3 minced Serranos, 4 minced jalapenos, 4 chopped jalapenos, one very large chopped poblano, and three minced fresh cayenne peppers to give it heat and pass on the ground cayenne pepper and habanero. I also use diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.

Good flavor despite the sodium.  I added an extra 28 oz. crushed tomato due to the excessive salt. I usually cut all salt at least in half, but didn't go that far this time.  What a mistake!  Now it's time to add some more beer and water!

This is my go-to chili recipe. It's easy to adjust the heat to your liking. When I cook this for my family, I usually use ground turkey instead of ground pork to cut down on fat. Otherwise, I follow the recipe and it turns out great everytime!

We had a bunch of home-grown peppers from a neighbor, so I can't guarantee that I used the peppers that the recipe calls for, but this was a really great chili nonetheless.

Great tasting chili.  My family isn't into real hot spicy things so I only used half a habanero and one jalapena and about half the cayenne pepper.  The pork and beef mixture was just right for this recipe and the beer left a hint of a taste.  The family loved it and it's now in my recipe box.

Delish!  Made this for a family get together and everyone loved it. It was so good I have to make it again today for my daughter's b-day party.  I didn't use a habanero but added an extra jalapeno and extra cayenne. Flavor was excellent and wasn't too hot.  I put hot sauce on the side in case someone wanted to spice theirs up a bit. This recipe is a keeper!

I have made this several times. I like it hot so the recipe is fine for me. Everyone else likes it milder, so I left out the habanero.  I also like chunks of beef so I added a half pound of 1 inch cubed round steak. and last a can of chili beans drained. We like elbow macaroni (the small ones) so I added a half cup, cooked and added at the end, so I can control how much. We will have this for Super Bowl weekend this year

Have to give this a 5!  Didn't change much at all except used ground turkey and ground chicken sausage and no habeneros.  My family loved it and it had pleny of kick even for me who likes stuff spicy (I did add jalapenos per recipe).  Was delish after a few hours and the next day!  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a medium chili, not too hot. I entered this in a contest, got great compliments, but didn't win. My chili was not sitting at a good  spot anyways. But it is still a great recipe. I think to win I would cut down on the beer, and maybe add more meat, like bacon. I also made the mistake of not adding the habanero, adding another pepper instead, thinking it would be too hot for people's taste buds. The winning chili was more meaty, and a little hotter. I guess most people like meaty and hot chili.

Fabulously flavorful! =) I have been home for 2 days cooking my heart away to get through Hurricane Sandy. Thankfully no loss of power! 
For this recipe I skipped the habanero and only used 1 jalapeno & a 1/4 tsp of Cayenne Pepper as I'm not into too much "heat". Used 3/4's green pepper and 3/4's red pepper and also used  light red kidney beans, dark red kidney beans and Canneloni beans to add color to the recipe. I also threw in 4 tablespoons of the Speedy Salsa recipe from this website that I made yesterday. Totally delicious! Excellent the first day and even better the next day after the flavors have congealed.
Great recipe~ Thank you!

GREAT flavor and heat.  Love the addition of the beer.  I would advise "heat-phobic" folks to look at the recipe.  Heat comes in several different places:  habaneros, cayenne pepper, chili powder.  If you don't like it so spicy, sub a milder chili for the habaneros, like a jalapeno.  I also used a black IPA (I like the stronger beers).  Was GREAT.

Very good.  I goofed and used hot It sausage instead of ground pork.  Did not have habanero peppers so I used 3 jalapeno.  Forgot the corn meal and used extra chilli powder.  Boy was this spicy!  We really liked it.  Will make again for a dish to pass at a clambake.
