My family loved this stew!  Must admit I left out the milk used a qt of 1/2 &1/2 & used 2 containers of fresh oysters.   And added a medium potato finely chopped and about a 1/4 of a small sweet onion to the celery mixture!   I was really careful not to let this come to a boil as cream could curdle.   This was a more expensive dinner than I usually make but when a girl wants oysters, then a girl gets oysters.  also bought a $4 bouquet of flowers!  It was a day to smile about!  :)

Superb recipe1 I use half n half in lieu of milk and heavy cream in lieu of half n half. I also add to Blondlady's recipe, one pinch of cayenne and 3 pinches of old bay and lace well with Sherry. I even add some of the Sherry to the stew too!

Instead of milk and half and half, I used almond milk and kefir.  Also add fresh dill.  Quite yummy for those looking for lactose free ingredients.

Excellent recipe.  Haven't had it in years.  I ate the entire batch (over a few days mind you).  It brought back some great memories of my Mom.

This is my basic recipe, nothing more and nothing less, the way I make it for myself two times per year as a feel-good-food. My mama used to make it for me whenever I was sick in bed, so good with the memory. Perfect in the winter.

Loved it!  Don't make the same mistake I did. After adding the oysters, I brought the soup to a boil and as a result I ended up with what looked like broth scum in my soup. I don't think  oysters need a high heat to cook thoroughly anyway, it was just me being paranoid about food poisoning. Just finish them off at medium low for 5 minutes as stated in the instructions.

I doubled this recipe and being from Maryland I had to add one tablespoon of Old Bay to the mix, everything else was kept the same. It was great and easy!

Very simple and tasty recipe. I omitted the parsley as I had none and I doubled the oysters. Make sure you turn down the heat once you add the milk and cream so it does not curdle.

I added chopped carrots to the celery that I zapped in the microwave for two minutes to get them soft quickly. At the end I stirred in cream sherry and would definitely add more flour to make it thicker next time.
