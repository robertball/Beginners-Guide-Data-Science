I hate to be the first to review this and only give it two stars, but I was really disappointed in this recipe.  I found it heavy and bland.  I didn't use nuts as I have an allergy, so maybe others will have better results if they use the nuts.

A bit modified receipe: added more cocoa, a bit more sugar; as I did not have walnuts at the moment, added hazelnuts and a bit less chocolate chips. 
While hot, not so good (more like chocolate bread,  not cake), but when cold  everyone loved

I didn't have powered buttermilk and my bread machine instruction indicated to replace the volume with 1/2 cup of milk. My bread collapsed and I'm assuming it was because of to much liquid. I probably should have left it in the bread case longer too. It was very moist and almost like a brownie instead of bread. I'll try to make it another time  and use powdered buttermilk, add more cocoa powder, less margarine, and less chocolate chips.

It would be a five star if you leave the salt out , if you use salted margarine.
