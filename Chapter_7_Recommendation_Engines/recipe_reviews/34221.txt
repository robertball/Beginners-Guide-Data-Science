this is the best choc chip cookie ever!! besides famous amos of course. according to the previous reviews, i've made a few variations: 1/4 cup butter in total (no shortening needed), 2/3 total amt of sugars added (the choc chips are sufficient to make the cookies sweet!) and a few more drops of vanilla. the outcome? MmMMMmmm.... definitely 5 stars!!

I was looking for a choc chip cookie recipe with less butter than usual. I used butter in place of shortening and margarine (hey, it was still half of most other recipes!). These cookies look a little different - more puffy and they don't spread as much as chocolate chip cookies usually do, but they are a great texture with a wonderful, vanilla/buttery flavour.

My husband enjoyed these very much. Chocolate chip cookies are his favorite and his egg allergy makes finding good cookie recipes a challenge. This came out very similar to my regular eggless chocolate chip cookie recipe (basically the toll house recipe using egg replacers). They came out lighter in color and took a couple more minutes than the baking time in the recipe indicated. The only change I made was using non-fat vanilla yogurt because I didn't have plain. I only used 1 tsp of vanilla extract because of this. Out of the oven, they were delicious -- a little crisp on the surface and soft and chewy inside. They didn't flatten as they cooked and remined domed though they did spread a bit. I look forward to seeing how they taste in a few days (a problem I've had with my eggless cookie recipes is that they fail to stay moist after a couple days).

These were astoundingly delicious, with crispy sides and chewy centres. I made a few changes - 1/3 cup white sugar + 1/3 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup butter + 1 tbsp applesauce, 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips. I had to bake them for about 20minutes though. 

[edit] okay, so I shouldn't have overbaked them.. they became a little rubbery. Stick to the original time and you'll do just fine:) [/edit]

Absolutely yummy.. THANKS! :)

these are the best "healthy" cookie i could find and they taste great too!  This time around i subbed the shortening with better n peanut butter which worked amazingly.  Also used 1/4 c less flour and 1/3 c quick oats to give it some texture.  If you are baking with better n peanut butter grease the cookie sheet bc it sticks

This is a great recipe.  My 3 year old nephew is allergic to almost everything, but eggless cookies was what I was on the hunt for. I did adjust it a little from reading the other reviews.  I used butter instead of margarine and shortening and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  They were really really good.  I under cooked them a little bit so they were soft instead of crispy.  My nephew devoured them and so did everyone else.  It's so hard to find a good recipe that uses something else in place of eggs, but this was definatley it.  Thank you.

the smell of yogurt with choc chips is as if i'm in famous amos shop! its very light (since no eggs!)! i reduced the amount of sugar to a little less then half a cup! the choco chips provides alot of sweetness. i think everyone should experiment plain yogurt cookies with other toppings like almonds etc! it'll turn out hard outside but soft inside even after 20mins baking. good for people who dislike hard/tough cookies!

This recipe was fantastic, thanks.
I added vanilla yoghurt instead of just plain and it brought out the flavour instead of adding extra vanilla to enhance the flavour.

It's not the easiest thing to find egg free recipes that work well - this one was an exception!

I may never go back to my regular chocolate chip cookie recipe. This one fixed the problem with normal ones of flattening out and being to crunch. None of that with this recipe- nice, thick, soft, and delicious cookies! I altered the recipe slightly, decreased the following just slightly : margarine (I used 3/4 stick of margarine and no shortening), and sugar. I slightly increased the following: brown sugar, yogurt, vanilla, and flour.
My cookies also needed a little extra time, but they were still soft and simply perfect.

Perfect for anyone with egg alergies or desire for delicious healthy cookies!

Warning: very addictive.

I wanted to make some cookies and didn't have eggs, and came across this recipe.  I used 1/4 cup of each sugar, came out sweet enough(plus, the choc chips add sweeteness).  I melted the 1/4 cup of butter and did not use the 1/4 cup shortening.  I just used a 6 oz cup of vanilla yogurt and white whole wheat flour, for the all-purpose. Lastly, 1 1/2 cups of choc chips.  Baked at 325 for 13 minutes.  They taste very good once cooled completely. The batter tasted very good too. My brother thought these were the pre-made cookie dough from the store.  I think that is a good compliment!  :)  Very good healthy cookie with half the sugar and fat content with my changes.  Plus, they are whole wheat/whole grain!

Great idea. Always looking for a healthier version of all recipes.  I used room temp 1/4 coconut oil instead of the butter/shortening and added 1/4 c applesauce.  I also used greek yogurt and added crushed walnuts.  Hubby loved them!  this one is a keeper!

Best chocolate chip cookies EVER. I'd up the salt to one teaspoon, I used coconut oil as my shortening (seriously, best stuff to cook and bake with.) and I only put in one cup of chocolate chips. Just be sure not to over-bake them, they're perfect a little soft, and they can dry out quickly if you over-bake them. It's not like you have to worry about salmonella :) Incidentally... I ate so much of this raw, lol. I think I've found my new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe. Yum. I'm off to make another batch....

This is our "go-to" recipe for eggless chocolate chip cookies.  I substitute sour cream for the yogurt since I never have plain yogurt in the house, and then change out the semi-sweet chocolate chips for dark chocolate, or cranberries and white chocolate chips, depending on the occasion and what I have on hand.  Everyone loves these, even without the eggs, which is such a life saver since my youngest boy is allergic to them.  It makes him feel terrific to know that everyone loves them, and that they are not just a sorry replacement compared to cookies made with eggs.  I highly recommend this recipe!

Awesome cookies easily adaptable for allergy-sufferers!  I used a dairy-free margarine and a soy yogurt and made the best chocolate chip cookies we've enjoyed since finding out our kids are allergic to dairy and eggs.  Every now and then I have to add a little extra flour, but other than that, this recipe is perfect every single time!

I am just taking these out of the oven and they look great! I made a few subs to make it even more healthy. 

I used 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour, and 3/4 cup unbleached all-purpose

Used the 1/4 cup butter, then reduced shortening to 3 Tbsp, adding 1Tbsp applesauce

Used 1/2 cup plain greek yogurt (a little more than 1/2 cup actually) 

Also, I decreased choc. chips to 1.5 cups and increased vanilla to 3 teaspoons. I think 1.5 cups choco chips is plenty! 
-----
I just tried one, delicious!! This will be my new standby! I love the less butter of the recipe, and the cookies still taste great. Thanks so much!

Tasty cookie! I didn't have any yogurt so I used sour cream. I also used all butter and added 1/2 c. chopped pecans. I did chill the dough for about an hour. This made 26 small cookies. Eight minutes at 375* was perfect, just done cookies. Great flavor. My husband especially liked these. Next time, I'd double the recipe and add another cup or so of chocolate chips.

A surprisingly good cookie considering it contains NO eggs at all!  I substituted 1/2 cup butter for the margerine and shortening, and I used 1 cup all purpose flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, which makes a the cookie a little better for you (more fiber) and also gives it a nice texture.  It is a crisp and yummy cookie!

Good recipoe - I loosely doubled it the first time I made it - using only 2 cups of mini chocolate chips and not 4 which would have been a crazy too much.  The batter doesn't spread very much so I could get 20 cookies on my 17 x 11 size cookie sheet.  I ended up with about 75 cookies.  These really are very good - I used vanilla yogurt and have none of my usual desire to experiment with any other yogurt flavour.

This recipe (with the one change of 1tsp of vanilla instead of 2) actually came from a cookie cookbook from like 1993. We started making it because they were better for you than most cookie recipes (half the fat of another choc chip cookie recipe on the same page). I have made them for years with great success. I also use vanilla yogurt, and butter flavored crisco adds flavor. I almost always double the recipe, sometimes we even make them just to eat the dough (no chance of salmonella)

Excellent egg-free cookies.  I was worried these would taste different (or weird) but they were absolutely delicious!  I made these as a treat for my students since I have a few egg allergies in my class.

These cookies are alright.  They are light and fluffy; personally, I prefer more dense cookies.  These tasted as though they were filled with air.

I subsituted applesauce for the shortening. I added 1/4 more flour and 1/4 flax seed. I also added about 1 cup of Walnuts. Along with this being an attractive cookie, it's cakelike texture makes it really enjoyable.

I followed this recipe exactly and these may be the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever eaten. I'm pretty sure I won't be making any other recipe again ... ever!

Full disclosure:  I followed other suggestions for modifications and I have a sneaky feeling that's why these didn't turn out.  So...don't use just 2/3 c total sugar and DO add the shortening, and they'll probably turn out as 4/5 star-ish as everyone's saying.

Very good.  I used greek yogurt and I think that is why mine didn't spread out much...will use normal yogurt next time.  Tasted great either way.

These turned out exactly like the picture!  I always seem to not have any eggs when I want to bake, so this was a great alternative, and I always have plain yogurt on hand.  Delicious, chewy, and a perfect amount of sweetness.

I did change 2 things - I used all brown sugar instead of 1/2 brow and 1/2 white.  I also did 1 cup chocolate chips, and 1 cup walnuts.

Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee, and it was PERFECT!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Not like toll house cookies, but the best egg free chocolate chip cookies I've found!  They are a like more cake-like, but springy and good.

Pretty good and I made some changes to make a little healthier.
Only used 3 TBSP butter and 2 TBSP shortening.  Used 1/2 cup splenda instead of white sugar. Used white whole wheat flour.  Added 1 ripe banana and only used 1 cup mini chocolate chips.  Used non-fat vanilla greek yogurt.  Also added 4 tsp Multi Grain Hot cereal (like dry oatmeal) that I ground in a coffee grinder (Hodgson Mill brand).  This stuff is great for baking.
Kids loved them - not a bad way to make a snack - will make again and try using less butter.

Hands down the best cookie I've ever made. It was so good I got rid of the rest of my chocolate chip cookie recipes! But, if you prefer cake-like cookies, you'll probably be lukewarm about this recipe.

Yum yum yum.  And the best part...you can lick the bowl without risking salmonella.  The yogurt adds a tang that compliments the butter and sugar taste.  I used butter for the shortening and they came out better than any other chocolate chip cookies I've ever made, with or without eggs.

Great recipe! I was out of eggs, but my kids wanted to make cookies.  I used plain greek nonfat yogurt and used 1/2 cup butter instead of half butter/half shortening. I also used butterscotch chips and added a 1/4 tsp cinnamon. I don't think I'll make these with eggs ever again! Must more moist this way. Yum!!

This was a great quick recipe for cookies. I didn't have any shortening on hand so I used 1/4 cup margarine and 1/4 cup butter (to replace shortening). I chilled the dough well before putting them in the oven and increased the oven temp by 20 degrees. I found they needed to bake longer than suggested to be cooked all the way through.

Oh My Gosh!!!! These amazing cookies are to die for. I am very picky when it comes to chocolate chip cookies because I'm a freak about them being super gooey and moist. These are neither and I love them! I followed the recipe exactly and didn't make any changes. I definitely recommend these.

These were the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever made hands down.  This was the first time trying this recipe, and only tried it because I happened to have the yogurt in the house.  Am I EVER pleasantly surprised.

I made this as a cookie cake. I didn't have any plain yogurt but had blueberry and used it! Came out great!

Spread on a jelly roll pan and baked for 22 minutes. I did put parchment on the bottom of pan and foil around edges after 10 minutes to prevent burnt edges.

Absolutely delicious! I took the advice of another reviewer and replaced the shortening with butter.  I also used whole wheat flour and low-fat vanilla yogurt.  I put in a pinch of nutmeg and reduced the amount of chocolate chips to one cup. Super yummy.

Not bad but I've had other cookies with more flavor. I didn't like how they baked up after 10 minutes they were still really doughy but 17ish minutes made them rubbery,,,didn't have anymore batches to try anymore times but won't make again to experiment though either.

AMAZING COOKIES!!! these cookies turned out amazing. I wanted to make cookies for my cousins but they don't eat egg and this was a perfect recipe. I was also looking for chocolate chip cookies with not much butter use. As a result, these were the best. I followed the suggestions given in the reviews, thanx for posting em! When i was placing the dough on the cookies sheet, I forgot to greese it, opps... but i made my cookies extra big so there was only 15 cookies! They took a little longer to bake but came out delicious! I would suggest eating them in a few days as they get hard very easily. And if they do go hard then try warming them up in the microwave to 10-15 seconds, they come out soft and delicious!

This recipe makes fabulous cookies !  However, I get much better results if I use 1/3 cup of yogurt (instead of 1/2 cup) and 2 cups of flour (instead of 1.75 cups).  As written, the dough was super sticky and I had to chill it before I could work with it....with the changes I made it is perfect and I can roll balls of it right after mixing it. The cookies are crispy outside, soft inside...perfect ! 

Also our kids are allergic to dairy, so I make these dairy-free by using Earth Balance margarine, Silk soy yogurt, and Enjoy Life chips.

Girlfriend decided to make these and we were tempted to gorge the cookies raw because they were just that good!.We decided to to hand chop the chocolate and the yogurt gives the cookies that certain 'OOMPH' that otherwise would be missing. We substituted maragrine and shortening for butter which was was a grand idea. For anyone who loves their cookies, this is a must do.

These cookies were a huge success in cookie gift boxes I made this year.  Personally, I felt that they tasted very much like a regular chocolate chip cookie, but I had a notable amount of positive response.

They were also easy to make.

Amazing!  My son is allergic to eggs and this was NOT a trade off. We used vanilla yogurt instead and we loved them.  No taste of yogurt at all and so soft!

WoW!!!  I love this recipe!  Easy to make... soft & fluffy!  I followed the others suggestions and used just 3/4 cups of brown sugar.  I used a white spelt flour to avoid wheat...

These were really easy to throw together quickly.  The kids could eat the batter as well which was nice.  They are really moist and really good when cooled completely.  I used 1/2 butter and kept everything else the same. I used a medium size scooper and had about 8-10 cookies per baking sheet. I just kept an eye on them, they took a little longer,  but were done when I could see a little brown around the bottoms.

I did thinks a bit differently to make them really healthy. They turned out puffy, chewy, and soft. I replaced all of the fat with 1/2 cup applesauce, used a little less than 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup all purpose, 1/4 cup rolled oats, 2 T ground flax seeds, and 2 t fiber powder. I also used 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/3 cup Splenda. I found that 1 cup chocolate chips was perfect and I can't imagine being able to fit any more. The best thing about these cookies is that after baking, the chocolate chips stay crunchy on the outside and gooey in the center. Heaven!

I think these are the best cookies I have ever made.  Instead of shortening, I used 1/2 cup butter total.  I almost doubled the yogurt, and used only 1 cup of chocolate chip... I actually only had these swirled caramel/chocolate chips because it was all I had.  And they came out great.  I baked them for 10 minutes. They are definitely a moist cake-like cookie.

I made some changes to this recipe.  I added 1/3 C brown sugar and a little less than 1/3 C white sugar.  For the flour, I used 3/4 C white flour, 3/4 C whole wheat flour and 1/4 C ground flax seed. I used a little more than 1/3 C butter, no shortening.  Vanilla yogurt and 2T vanilla. 1 C mini choc chips.   

I was a little worried that I took out too much of the sugar when I tasted the batter.  It wasn't very sweet, but after they were cooked, they were fabulous.  My DH loves them and wants me to make more tonight.  The cookies did flatten out like I had expected, but that doesn't matter to me if he likes them.  :)  They are very soft and cakelike cookies.

These were excellent cookies. I thought the yogurt might add a slight tangy flavour, but they taste just like good ol' chocolate chip cookies. I only had vanilla flavoured non-fat yogurt, so I reduced the vanilla to 1 tsp. I used a mix of semi-sweet and white chocolate chips, substituted half the flour with whole wheat flour, and used all butter instead of shortening (like previous reviews suggested, and because I didn't have any on hand!). I like that they don't use eggs, as I rarely have them on hand, but always have yogurt hanging around.

Yum!  Nice, thick, and chewy, just the way I like my chocolate chip cookies.  I couldn't find a small container of plain yogurt and so ended up using vanilla yogurt and cutting the vanilla extract in half.

My family and I are vegetarian but also don't eat eggs. We have been able to find different all types of eggless desserts except for great tasting eggless chocolate chips cookies. Thanks to this recipe, we were able to enjoy delicious cookies.  perfect recipe. Thanks again!

These are awesome cookies!  I tried the recipe because I wanted to make Chocolate Chip cookies for a family member with an egg alergy, and I may never make regular chocolate chip cookies again! Very moist and chewy!  Turned out great even though I substituted all butter for the shortening.

I didn't use all the brown sugar and used all butter (no shortening), but they came out well. I also used chocolate chip/ mint chips and added some green food coloring and they were delicious. The only issue I had was finding the right cook time. The first batch was a little underdone.

I haven't tasted the finished product just yet. But I feel like it's a 5 star already! I didn't have plain yogurt so I used vanilla lowfar yogurt. Followed the recipe otherwise. I can't stop eating the dough as I get in on the sheets and wait for it to finish in the oven I peeked in at them and they look nice and thick. Not flattened out at all!

These were good,BUUUTTT still like the regular "toll house" better. Used more vanilla and butter flavored shortening. had to cook for about 20 min at 375,but did make mine a little bigger. There were still some left the next morning and with all my sons(8 of them) cookies usually disappear in an hour.Liked the texture and flavor,but think would be better as a base for a dessert,so WILL use this recipe again for that only.

I love these cookies and so does everyone who tries them! I like to use a combination of white and milk chocolate chips and I only use one tsp of vanilla, vanilla yogurt instead of plain yogurt, and I add about half the salt.

nice recipe.  i live at 9,300 feet and by adding 1/4 cup flour this was a very good high altitude recipe.  the cookies didn't flatten like most recipes do when made at high altitude.  if you are around 5000 feet, try adding 2 Tbsp flour to avoid flat cookies.

these were tasty. But they are not 5 stars. I got a beautiful cookie with a delicate flavor and texture. The batter was pretty good. There is a definite difference in regular choc chip cookie recipes and this one. For purists who love their Tollhouse, this isnt for you.

These were sooo fantastic!  I used vanilla fat-free yogurt so I cut down on the vanilla extract, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  This is definitely my FAVORITE chocolate chip cookie recipe now!  Best part = I can eat the dough without worrying about raw eggs!!!  Thank you so much for this keeper recipe!

Overall pretty tasty.  These are definatly not your normal chocolate chip cookies and in general the comments were "strange" and "very weird" but none of these said in a bad way as all of the cookies disappeared within a day!!  Not sure I'd made again - maybe if I had left over yoghurt to use up or was baking for someone allergic to eggs.

These cookies were lovely.  Emphasis on were....cause they're almost gone!  I used vanilla yogurt, so I cut back a little on each sugar.  I also used a stick of butter instead of the butter/shortening combo.  They turned out great and I'm looking forward to experimenting with them!

Great recipe. After reading the reviews I was hesitant to try this. The cookies turned out so chewy and stayed chewy. Most of the bad reviews came from changing the ingredients and the few that did not change the recipe and had poor reviews said they preferred a little more flavor. So I added 1/4 c more of each sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon. The cinnamon added flavor, but I think you could get away with not using it. My husband and I ate all of these in two days! They are a little different than a regular chocolate chip cookie, but so very soft, and once you get past the preconceived idea of a typical chocolate chip cookie you will really like these.

I tried this recipe because I had yogurt I wanted to use up.  Boy was I surprised...these are great tasting cookies.  I used 1/4c. salted butter and left out the salt.  My husband loves them.  This is a keeper recipe.  Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe!! My daughter is allergic to eggs and milk. I love to find recipes that turn out and taste like the real thing!  I was a little skeptical because often recipes turn out quite different with out eggs, but this one really works!  The only diffrence I made was to use milk-free margarine, milk-free choc. chips and soy yogurt, but they still turned out delicious... even my husband thought they taste good.

These cookies are awesome.  I didn't expect them to be as moist as they were.  The recipe yields very authentic chocolate chip cookies with less fat, calories & guilt!  I added chopped walnuts to mine.  Great that they are eggless too.  Thanks so much for posting!

I had leftover homemade yogurt, and this recipe seemed like a good way to use up some of that.  I followed this recipe  exactly except I used all butter.  The cookies are soft and came out tasty.  They're a little different tasting from typical choco chip cookies, but that might be due to the tartness of my yogurt.  I still prefer the chewy texture of "real" choco chip cookies though.

We recently found out that my son is allergic to eggs so I have been looking for egg-free recipes every since. I took some of the other reviewers suggestions of using just butter, added 1 tbsp of applesauce, used 1 tbsp of vanilla, used 1/3 cup each of brown and white sugar, and substituted half the white flour with whole grain flour. I also used fat-free organic vanilla yogurt and Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips. These cookies came out great and will definitely become a staple in my recipe book.

for a heathy treat, this is number one. i only used 1 c. of flour and then added a little over 1 c. of quick oats. and i used maybe    a spoonful of shortning instead of the whole 1/4 c. i also cut the chocolate chips to 1 cup and added in 1/2 cup shredded coconut and dried cherries. the dough is the tastiest thing in the world. i would eat it uncooked any day!

These cookies are ok.  I didn't have plain yogurt, so I used vanilla.  I cut the vanilla to 1 tsp, since the flavor was in the yogurt.  I also cut the chips to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup M&Ms.  I also cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups b/c others said it was cake like and I like my cookies crisper.  There was plenty of chocolate in each cookie.  The cookies just came out of the oven.  They took a very long time to cook and get brown, about 20 minutes.  They are very soft.  I am glad I cut the flour.  The taste is good, but not the best I ever had.  Maybe they will be better the second day.

Best cookies ever.  Crisp on the outside, tender in the middle!!!!!  You have to make these!  And, as other reviews, you don't need the shortening, and you can reduce the sugar if you prefer!

Love them!  I made them for my egg allergic son, and I love them.  I did cut down on the sugar as suggested in other reviews, and they turned out better than the family favorite.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe.

I had only a cup of semi sweetened chocolate chunks but I found a bar of Lindt Dark Chocolate in the back of the cupboard and broke it into little bits for the other cup.  Tastes delicious!

These are delicious! You definitely wont miss the eggs. As a variation, I used Trader Joes' Greek Style Honey Yogurt. It's not that sweet on its own so you don't have to cut down on the sugar.

My son is allergic to eggs, and this is the first chocolate chip cookie recipe I have found that actually tastes great!  I made it into a "cookie cake" in a large round pizza pan--just had to cook for 25 minutes.  All the kids loved it, and couldn't tell the difference between this cookie & regular cookies!

Absolutely amazing recipe!  I used 1/2 butter (no shortening) and cut down on the sugar like the other reviews recommended. Also added a little ground flax (which can be used to replace eggs in some recipes). Result was soft, delicious, puffy cookies!

Thank you Kim for this fab recipe ! 
I'm a bit of a nature freak so I replaced the sugars for 1 cup of golden cane sugar.  I did use butter but instead of shortening, I used 100ml of unsweetened apple sauce and the all natural yogurt.  Our children loved it! A recipe I will keep ;-)
I forgot my oven heats too much.. so top rack at 350 for 6 min but that's for my oven (it's old hahaha)

This recipe is AMAZING. I have stretched its bounds, adding different ingredients to make strawberry chocolate chip cookies, whole wheat peanut butter cookies, etc! This is such a great base cookie dough. Not too sweet, perfectly soft and chewy!

Quick and easy! Super yummy too. Soft, moist, but a little tough in areas. (I was expecting that without eggs though.)

I used:
all butter
1/4 c fruit syrup sweetener instead of brown sugar
all whole wheat flour
a tiny pinch of baking powder (my cookies tend to flatten out when I use whole wheat flour)

Finally, an egg-free recipe that works.I made this for my niece (allergic to eggs and peanuts)and it has become our standard. I do use all butter and sour cream instead of yogurt, but it is fabulous. Thick and slightly chewy. Perfect

I made this for my 3 year old daughter who has an egg, wheat, and dairy allergy.  I used spelt flour and goat yogurt.  I also added cocoa instead of chocolate chips. They are very good.

Ok... I made these for a friend who does not eat eggs. The cookies tasted pretty good. I Followed the recipe to the word, except that I used butter instead of shortening (don't get that in my town). I am rating these 4 stars because they play the part with how they taste, but fall short with how they look! Turned out pretty flat and thin.

Not crazy about the taste of shortening. There is no way I could have dropped the dough from a spoon, it was very stiff so I rolled it in balls and flattened slightly. Baked 9 minutes, my cookies were quite hard. I would try these again w/all butter or butter/coconut oil combination and perhaps reduce the flour by a few TBSP. I like to have a few eggless recipes around for a nephew who is allergic, most eggless cookies have tons of butter so I do like the idea of yogurt in place of eggs.

These cookies were awesome!!! I had all the ingredients on hand except the shortening.  I was too lazy to go out shopping for just one thing of shortening so I doubled up the butter to 1/2 cup of butter.  These were the most moist, tender, chewy cookies ever.  Nobody would know the difference you didn't add any egg in it if you didn't tell them.  However, the part with mixing the yogurt and butter tho looks gross but when mixed with the flour mixture, it looks just like any other cookie batter.  Don't be turned off by the look of the yogurt mixture.  I think next time I will cut the 1/2 cup of white sugar out and just use the brown sugar.  It was a little bit sweet for me.  Other than that, this recipe is a keeper!!!

We love the consistency of these cookies. I used coconut oil instead of margarine/shortening to make them a bit healthier. I only had vanilla Greek yogurt, so that's what I used (and would again). I also used milk chocolate chips per my hubby's request. Mine needed longer in the oven than listed. I think this is a great base recipe that you could add whatever your heart desires to- peanut butter, butterscotch chips, white chocolate chips, craisins. MmmMmm, the possibilites! Will make again.

These were fantastic and I'm very glad I tried these instead of my usual chocolate chip cookie recipe which has eggs. I made a few changes out of necessity - as I didn't have white sugar and shortening on hand: I used 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup packed brown sugar. No other changes were made. At 190 degrees C, the cookies took exactly 10 minutes to reach a mild golden at the edges whilst remaining soft and chewy at the centre. Tip: It really helps to beat the butter and sugar until it is really really light and fluffy. Thank you for sharing this recipe Kim Chin! :)

When I wanted to bake cookies but was out of eggs, I tried this recipe. It was good. Not as good as a regular chocolate chip cookie but still good. I substituted sour cream for the yogurt.

The recipe could have used more vanilla flavor.  I made a chocolate white chocolate chip version, substituting the chocolate chips and adding 3 TB cocoa.  Very soft and cake like cookie with a delicate butter flavor.  I halved the sugar and left the sweetness enhanced by the chips. Not exactly my type of cookie. Husband loved it.  A bit soft for my taste, but certainly a wonderful way to get rid of old yogurt.

These cookies turned out wonderfully! I did make some changes though, I used dark chocolate chunks and butterscotch chips along with chopped cashews. Since butterscotch chips are rather sweet I took the sugars down to 1/4 cup each. I also used apple sauce instead of the shortening and whole wheat flour insteat of white. Since I used the whole wheat I added about 2 more tablespoons of yogurt to keep them moist. Also added a 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to jazz it up. Cookies came out soft with a crisp edge!! So delicious.

Great cookies! I used a bit less shortening (about 1 TBSP), and used half whole-wheat flour. Also, added 2 TBSP ground flax and 2TBSP oatmeal. Very tasty!

5 stars for an amazingly delish raw dough, 3 stars for the baked cookie=4 stars. I made a double batch & got 64 cookies but we ate a "few" spoonfuls of the dough:) These were thin & crispy on the outside & chewy in the middle but not overly flavorful once baked. I'm def making the dough again & again-my kids also thank you!

I wanted to make a nice treat for us but didn't have eggs so I found this. My wife loves it and so do I! I made modifications similar to others like, 3/4 C Wholesome Sweeteners Sugar, 1 T Wholesome Sweeteners Molasses, 1/3 C soft butter and used an ice cream scoop.

This was a great recipe for a quick and easy cookie!  I did make a few adjustments.   I used 1/4 of applesauce instead of shortening, used fat-free vanilla yogurt instead of plain yogurt and then just omitted the vanilla extract, used Splenda instead of the white sugar, and just used a handful of chocolate chips.  The result was a soft, cake like cookie that is fairly low in fat!  Thanks for the great recipe!

It was pretty good, except that it was wayyyyyyyy too sweet,what with that chocolate chips and all. So I'll definitely be making these cookies recipe again, but with half of the given amount of sugar. It turns out beautifully otherwise!!

i wouldn't say this recipe was terrific, but it wasn't bad. i didn't get much of a yogurt taste and overall only the chocolate chips saved it.  i used a slightly thicker yogurt (which should have given a strong flavor in the cookie but it didn't) and my  batter became quite dry so i added a teaspoon of milk to it. these cookies don't spread so you might want to flatten them a little before popping them into the oven. also, try to brush back "strands" of batter sticking out or they might burn

Great cookie. I used 1/2 c butter (no marg) and white chocolate chips and craisins instead of chocolate chips. My cookies spread but were nice and soft. I'm at altitude and didn't make any high altitude changes, I might try more flour next time.

yum! I excluded the shortening since I didn't have it, upped the vanilla to a TBS cause that's the spoon I had in my hand and YUMMMY! The texture to these are unbeatable! If you know the yogurt is in there, you can almost taste it, if no one tells...everyone stands around wondering what your secret is :)

Amazing! This is one of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes I've ever made. They have a great texture b/c of the yogurt. If vanilla nonfat yogurt is used, they have even better flavor! I cut down on the shortening and used slightly more yogurt in order to make them healthier.

I didn't get crispy cookies, and I baked them about 12 mins because they just didn't seem done. The consistency is odd, unlike a chocolate chip cookie, and the yogurt taste is a bit overbearing. I cut down to 2/3 cup sugar total and used less butter. I think next time I will cut down on the yogurt and add applesauce. The cookies don't expand, keep that in mind, and they are lighter and not as buttery. Worth a try, but experiment a little bit.

YUMMY!  I have a sister in law recently allergic to eggs.  So, I wanted to find a cookie she coule enjoy that will not make her sick.  This is it!  I used only butter, a little extra vanilla, dark chocolate chips, oat flour, and nonfat plain greek yogurt.  very easy to put together.  I read many of the reviews before making.  DO not over cook!  I made the 1st batch at 10 minutes, 2nd 12 and 3rd 14 minutes.  They do look under cooked, but once cooled all the way are PERFECT!  My family does like crispy so 14 minutes was ok.  I have a convection oven so my temp was at 350.  I will make again, but may sub some flax meal for 1/2 the butter to lighten them up a bit.  I was also thinking about adding some mocha pudding mix too.  I have printed this recipe and am mailing some cookies and this recipe to my sister in law to enjoy!

I used all butter (no shortening) and vanilla fat-free yogurt. I substituted the chocolate chips with 1c butterscotch chips and 1c chopped cashews. Flavor-wise, these were out of this world! (I VERY highly recommend the cashew-butterscotch combo, it's delish.) Texture-wise, these were very soft. I prefer some amount of crisp to my cookies, so I wasn't a huge fan of this. But still, they were great-tasting.

Mmmm! I totally had to change things up to use what I had, but sooo worth it! I only had strawberry yogurt (I know, sounds gross, but...) I added brownie mix for more chocolate flavor. I did everything else exactly as posted with these additions...oh yeah and added m&m's (I love the colors with the chocolate cookies!) Turned out GREAT!! Thanks for the "egg-free" recipe!!!!

I happened to have yogurt on hand and no eggs, so decided to try this recipe.  I was pleasantly surprised at the amazing texture and good flavor of these cookies.  Like other reviewers, I used all butter and no shortening to make it easier for me and they turned out great.  Thanks for this recipe....this one's going in the front of my chocolate chip cookie recipes!!

This is a great recipe.  Only change I made was to use 3/4 cup brown sugar, other than that followed recipe exactly.  I'm always on the lookout for egg-free baked goods so my neice can eat them.  These are a keeper.

For a healthier cookie, this is good. It has a cake-like texture. It is a little lacking in flavour though, probably not sweet enough. I would use this recipe again, but with more brown sugar (about 3/4 cup).

I love these cookies; I much prefer soft/cakey cookies over chewy flat ones. These are wonderful and forgiving - I've made them as the recipe states, subbing at various times & combinations butter or margerine for all the fat, sour cream for yogurt, whole wheat for regular flour. My favourite variation is actually 1 cup reese's pieces with 1 cup chips... those also disappear really fast around other people (literally 15 min for an entire batch at work). I do find they tend to brown quickly on the bottom, but I don't feel bad underbaking them as there's no eggs. My oven is also a little variable in terms of temperature, which is probably why this happens.

I have been looking for an eggless cookie recipe since my daughter is allergic to eggs - these cookies are excellent.  I used 1/2 cup of butter flavor Crisco shortening since that is what I had on hand but next time I will try butter and see how they come out.  I also cooked them slightly longer.  Great cookies!

These are great! My sweet-toothed husband said these are the best chocolate chip cookies he’s ever eaten and that’s really saying something! (I had even reduced the total sugar to 2/3 cup as suggested in one review!) I did increase the vanilla to 3 tsp. as suggested in another. I think this cuts down on the twangy taste of the yogurt which is a really helpful solution for me since I substitute yogurt for eggs in a lot of recipes. Just used 2 sticks of cooking margarine instead of using shortening. The cookies disappeared fast!

Great cookies! They turned out perfect! I used margarine not butter and I baked them on cookie sheets lined with parchment paper for 10 minutes.

I just made these. I ran out of eggs and did not have yogurt! So I used regular sour cream. I added a bit more vanilla per other reviewers and this was great! My kids are already diving in! Thank you for saving my 4th of July fest with an awesome recipe!!!

I didn't make any changes, and the cookies are great out of the oven... Reserving the last star for later, once I see how it is received by the barbarian hordes:-) definitely easy to mix up, and handy for vegetarian friends.

We are chocolate chip cookie snobs, and only eat my grandmother's recipe.  Sadly I wanted some, was missing ingredients,  and tried this recipe.  These were addictive.  Going in my favorite pile.

These turned out great, even at high altitude. We live at 9600 feet so cookies are a challenge. I used 6 T butter and 1/2 the recommended sugar. I might go a little heavier on sugar next time. These are delicious - thanks for sharing!

I've made these cookies twice in 1 week! Both times I substituted plain Greek yogurt. The first time I used 1 3/4 cups of semi sweet chips and baked for 13 mins rotating the trays half way through. The second time I used 1 1/4 cups of mini semi sweet chips and baked for 14 mins and turned halfway through. Both times I used slightly more than a tablespoon of dough and it made 40 cookies each time. But spread out more with the mini chips. Great, easy cookies!

These cookies are really good, considerig they don't have eggs! One of my kids has an egg allergy making it difficult to have "go to" sweets the whole family can enjoy. I came across this recipe and she loves them! The texture is a bit different from your typical chocolate chip cookies (more puffy and soft). I used vanilla yogurt (cause that's what was available), only used 1/4 c butter (no shortening), and subbed the granulated sugar with more brown sugar.  For the first batch, I spooned the cookie dough on the cookie sheet and shoved them in the oven (as is typical when baking cookies). Low and behold, the shape did not change. They didn't spread and flatten out as I was used to, so I actually flattened out the rest before putting them in the oven. As I said, my egg-allergic kid loved them and so did her 2 (non allergic) sisters and dad. Great recipe if eggs are not an option!

Did not care for texture or coloring. Too sweet. Burned before it browned at 375. Lowered to 350 on second batch. Will not make again.

These sounded like an ideal solution to a small problem.  I didn't have a full pound of butter, and never have shortening nor margarine on hand, so had to find something with less butter.  The recipe doesn't make a huge amount, but goes together very fast.  Like others, I made a few changes.  I had some sliced almonds to use up and tossed those in, only had peach yogurt on hand so used that, and made the cookies a little smaller than I might otherwise.  The smell while cooking was incredible with the mix of chocolate, really good vanilla and almonds, and the results were great.   I give this 7 out of 5 stars!!

Excellent recipe!  We usually just eat the dough (hey it's eggless!) because it's so good. I never add chocolate chips & always use flavored yogurt.  I also drop the white sugar & butter amount to 1/4 cup. Vanilla yogurt is the best but lemon is also great.  Makes a quick, easy, cheap cookie that all kids like.

The only thing I changed was the flavor of the yogurt.  I only had vanilla yogurt from the big container so I used that.  I absolutely loved these cookies!  They didn't turn out crisp like I read about but what I loved about them is...cookie dough.  I love eating raw cookie dough and this was great.  You don't have to worry about the eggs (not that I ever do) but I thought maybe they wouldn't bake up good because there were no eggs but they turned out great!  This might become my new chocolate chip cookie recipe!  Thanks for the recipe!

Weird texture but tasty cookies. I was hoping for something wi flavor more close to a traditional chocolate chip cookie. This is delicious in its own way, and has the texture of an oatmeal cookie. I used white chocolate chips & semi-sweet chips (because we children love the combo). They turned out well, but again, I was surprised at the flavor and texture.

This is a wonderful 'eggless' chocolate chip cookie.  I made as written, only my bag of chips contained semi-sweet, milk and white chocolate and butterscotch chips.  Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  Just how my family enjoys a cookie.

This was fabulous! I needed to use up some yogurt that was going to expire soon and this recipe fit the bill perfectly! Soft and delicious, these were a surprise for eggless cookies! I doubled the recipe and my only change was that i used vanilla yogurt instead of plain. 
Delish! Will make again!

YUMMY!  I got 3 recipe requests from friends who tasted it.  I had to bake it like 13-14 minutes and it was still soft and delicious.  BEWARE:  adding more flour to the dough than the recipe states makes it hard and dry.

I tried this recipe on a day i had no eggs left and I love it. I warn ppl about the yogurt flavor before they try this cookie, and then they love it too. I made the first batch without any butter but it was too dry (I replaced with oil+apple sauce). They were still good and everyone ate them, but I found them a tad dry. The second batch I used butter and replaced some of the chocolate chips with chopped walnuts. They're a dream! I will be keeping this recipe.

Love this! I use Greek yogurt, a stick of butter (rather than half shortening -- no shortening around or I would compare the two. Last time I used 1/2c margarine and that was really good!), and 1/2c whole wheat flour in place of all white flour. I also add at least half a cup of crunchy peanut butter. I have to bake them for about 12 min.      My boyfriend is paranoid and won't eat any cookie dough that has eggs in it, so the leftover batter is a rare treat for him.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  These were good but next time I will only use 1 cup or 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips.. 2 cups is waaaay  too much. I was a bit worried as the butter and sugars were not as creamy and fluffy as in the usual Tollhouse recipe but it turned out well.

I love this recipe.  I'm allergic to eggs so this is perfect for me.  these always come out to be soft and moist. I like to add a cup of walnuts when I make them and have a tenancy to cut down on the white sugar by 1/8th to 1/4th of a cup depending on the mood of my sweet tooth.

One of the best chocolate chip cookie recipes I've ever used, eggless or no! Actually I wasn't looking for egg-free, I just wanted something more healthy than all that sugar, all that butter, and this definitely fit the bill.  I made the recipe as-is, proportion-wise, but substituted out the shortening for coconut oil (mmm), and less than half of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat. Oh and I omitted half of the brown sugar too. They still baked the same, and both look and taste great! Soft, fluffy, chewy, and sweet. Yum.

I made this recipe to the tea minus the all of the chocolate chips. The taste was excellent but the texture was just too soft almost like a flat muffin. They spread well but looked nothing like the texture on the picture.

Great recipe! I made a few changes to some healthier ingredient options. I replaced the white sugar with apple sauce. I also replaced the shortening with coconut oil. Half the yogurt was substituted with 1 egg. Lastly I replaced 1/2 cup of flour with oats (recon next time I'll add some coconut to the mix too). And I bet you can reduce the choc chips to 1 1/2 cups! Loved it as it was not too greasy (which happened with previous recipes I used). It is an easy and non-fail recipe for kids to help out with!

Per some reviews I used 3/4 of a stick of butter and did not use shortning, I used vanilla Greek yogurt instead of plain. I baked it for 10mn. The result was better then cookies with eggs! The kids finished them all in an afternoon.

These cookies were delicious and I only changed a few things. Instead of all purpose flour I used whole wheat pastry flour and it was so good and I just used low fat natural vanilla yogurt. Delicious! I will defiantly be making more of these cookies!

Fantastic cookies with less fat and empty calories. Used 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup peanut butter, whole wheat flour, and 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips. Replacing shortening with peanut butter adds protein and yummy flavor, which is way better than just adding fat. I also like the eggless aspect of the recipe because we always seem to be out of them. Don't hesitate to try this recipe!

I've been trying to find a chocolate chip cookie recipe that does not have egg as one of the ingredients, but is still soft and tastes good.  My daughter is allergic to egg, and of course she loves cookies.  I used vanilla Greek yogurt, and these cookies turned out great.  I also baked them on a lower temp, 350 degrees, for a longer period of time, 14 minutes, because I want soft cookies, not crisp.  I just hope they stay soft for a few days, as with most egg-less recipes I have tried the food tends to dry out quickly.  As someone else said, these cookies do not spread so I pressed them flat a little bit before putting them in the oven.

These cookies are really good.  I was worried that the next day when not fresh out of the oven they would be hard but no.  I kept them in a covered container and they were nice and soft the next day.  We basically ate them all in 24hrs.  I changed the recipe slightly.  I used butter instead of shortening, a little less white sugar and next time I would only use one cup chocolate chips, 2 were way too much.  I also used regular vanilla yogurt and decreased the vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon.  My son is allergic to eggs and I find using the egg substitute they never turn out right.  This recipe was perfect!

I tried two eggless versions today. I had 6 kids taste both versions. I think the preferred version was not this, rather one made with condensed milk vice yogurt. This cookie was okay, and a good eggless version, but in comparison to the other it was much more "crusty" and sweet. I think this recipe altered with raisins, oats, and chocolate might be very yummy, but this is not as close to a "regular" Chocolate chip cookie as we preferred in either texture or taste. However, this version is much healthier, and thus I might make it again for that reason.

These were great! I used Yoplait's banana cream pie flavored yogurt because that's all I had and it was great! (The end product didn't taste like bananas.) My dad thinks there's too many chocolate chips, but I disagree. My dad also suggested I add coconut next time and I will give that a try. And they are great "dunkers"!

just made these tonight and oh my gosh!! they are so good! though I would recommend that instead of following the recipe in making rounded teaspoon drops, make them a tad bit larger as these cookies don't spread out like other cookies of its kind. And I made a batch with slightly larger cookies and they weren't bite sized and the larger cookie allowed u to really savor the soft, fluffy inside. Still a great recipe this is my new go-to chocolate chip recipe!!! :)

Ohhh myy! These are amazing! I am vegan, so this was the perfect recipe for me. Even my non-vegan friends and boyfriend will love these cookies. When looking for vegan recipes, I always come across all these crazy substitutions and ingredients that I don't normally have. I am a new vegan and these cookies will make a smooth transition for me :) All I had to do was use vegan chocolate chips (which I forgot to do the first time, of course), soy-milk yogurt, and raw sugar, which was so easy! I will definitely try it with other kinds of yogurt (almond-milk, etc.) I made a few mistakes/accidental alterations likeeee using vanilla flavored yogurt. I just used a little less vanilla extract to even out the flavor and they still worked great. I also didn't have shortening and used a full half cup of margarine intead of 1/4. I don't really like using shortening (or vegan shortening) usually and these were great regardless. YAY

Very good! soft and chewy but crisp on the outside! I was worried that it was undercooked because it was so soft so the second batch I cooked a few minutes longer--still delish :) Also, i think it's great that it's eggless in the case that I ever undercook them.
--I didn't have any yogurt so I used sour cream instead, came out wonderful! And I cut the choco chips by using only 1 cup instead of 2, glad I did! Each cookie still had 3-5 chips each so I think if I had used 2 cups it would have been overkill... instead of shortening I used a stick of unsalted butter instead (1/2 cup butter) soooo yummy!!

I love the convenience of these cookies! Mixing everything was a breeze, and they came out perfectly with crispy edges and moist, chewy centers. The texture and taste are great!

So long as you're removing the egg, you can also remove the butter and shortening - substitute one ripe avocado for both.  I tried the recipe with the avocado substitution, and LOVED it.  This will replace our current chocolate chip cookie recipe.

This is a fabulous, classic recipe. Nice switch from regular chocolate chip cookie recipes. No changes. Absolutely perfect. Plus the baked cookies freeze well as does the dough, pre portioned and ready to bake fresh for an afterschool treat.

YEAH!!! at long last an egg free chocolate chip cookie that is as good as the original toll house recipie.  I am very impressed.  I used vanilla yogurt and a smidge less of the liquid vanilla because that was all I had.. I also used all butter and omited the crisco(I only had plain crisco not butter flavor).  They are crispy on the outside and softer on the inside.  I can finaly make a chocolate chip cookie for my 7 year old egg and nut allergic daughter...  It so so GREAT to see her lick a spoon and want to cook with mom.

These cookies were great.  I made them for my daughter's first grade class and they loved them.  Great for anyone with egg allergies, also.  We used m&m's in place of the chips, they were great.

Two days later and these cookies are still soft and fantastic. I only had sour cream on hand and had to use that instead of the yogurt. They turned out great. They didn't flatten out at all-what you spoon out is what you get. I think next time I'll increase vanilla or add more cinnamon to enhance flavor just a bit. Will be making these again.

these cookies disappointed me! I thought the yogurt would make the taste really good however the cookies lacked taste. The texture was okay though, kind of cakey and soft.
