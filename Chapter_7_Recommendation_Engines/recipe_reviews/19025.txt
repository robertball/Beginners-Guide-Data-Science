If I would have reviewed this the night I tried it it would not have gotten 5 stars. I didn't know it but it needs lots of time to set up right. I used double the cookies and put in a pie pan. When I was trying to get rid of leftovers so I could make something else I had some of this again and it was set up properly...wow the flavor was better and I really enjoyed it. I will make again only the night before so it can be in fridge overnight.

I liked this dessert because it reminded of desserts my mom used to make. I can see using crushed Oreo cookies next time!
