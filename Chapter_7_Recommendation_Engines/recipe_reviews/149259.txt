Being a swiss person I just have to say something to this recipe.. It works perfectly without the milk, and do not cover it, or it will become soggy. Use a tiny bit of peanut oil or lard with the butter and fry it on medium heat. the trick with the plate does take a little practice but it is the easiest way to a real crispy, flat roeschti. Melt some more butter and oil/lard in before putting it back into the pan. Try covering it with (Raclette-) cheese (and 4 slices of tomato) and putting it in the oven for another 8-10 minutes on high heat... En Guete! =)

Oh my goodness! I've been searching for a good roesti recipe since moving back from Switzerland where I enjoyed it at restaurants and from the supermarket! Who knew it could be so easy?!  For this recipe I found it important to keep a lid on the frying pan..I did this and found that the potatoes got a lot softer because they boiled a little bit more from the excess steam...I also like to mix it up a little bit so one time I added a little bit of chopped onion and sauted it in the butter before adding the potato..yum yum!  To flip the roesti I simply did what I do with omletes...I waited until a nice crust had developed on the bottom and I could move it around a little bit in the pan if I shook it...I then slid it gently onto a  plate, flipped my frying pan over the roesti that was on the plate while holding the plate and turned the whole thing over while holding the bottom of the plate and the handle of the frying pan in one quick motion so that the top of the roesti was now on the bottom of the frying pan! Easy as can be! :)   I also added some grated cheese to the top of it and stuck the lid back on while the bottom cooked - cheddar of course..mmm! That part definitely isn't Swiss..but I love cheddar..it's the best of both worlds! This has become a very popular and very asked about potato dish in our house!

Very good! I used a mixture of butter and bacon grease. I also added half a chopped sweet onion, chopped bacon and sprinkled cheese over the top at the end of the cooking time. Both my kids and I enjoyed this.

It's possible I overcooked the potatoes, so that could be why it just tasted like mashed potatoes to us.  Not really sure, but it is a lot of effort for mashed potatoes.  Good, and I like the crust, although it was difficult for me to flip on the plate--dindn't really work well for me.  Not sure if that's something that takes practice or what.  I may try again with less cooked potatoes and see if it ends up a little more like I imagined.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe, but, a little bleak on the additives that can be injected into the recipe as well. Also, this works best in a cast iron skillet.

great recipe for extra potatoes. For easy flipping....plate's diameter should be larger then that of the pan's.

Good thing I'm not Swiss...I took some liberties with the recipe. I used half red potatoes, half sweet potatoes (yams, really). I boiled the potatoes only four hours before I needed to cook them, so they didn't get their overnight 'rest' like they were supposed to (why do they need that rest, again?) I cooked them as directed, but didn't add the milk, and flipped it over and crusted the other side as well. It was super yummy, and before it was even gone my husband asked when I was making it again.

2 things you must know about this recipe. First, Swiss food is meant to be rich - this is delicious, but definitely rich (at least with cheese on top).  Second, I think it needs to be stressed that the potatoes should only be boiled ~15 mins (they cook further in the pan afterall) - I overcooked mine and though it was still tasty, it would have been better slightly less soft.

I too cooked this without a lid and without the milk - it's meant to crisp up and brown on both sides.  A great dish to experiment with!  We fried up onions and mushrooms to go with ours.

Delicious potatoes! I used bacon grease instead of butter :) my low was not low enough and I had a pretty dark crust after only ten minutes, so next time I will try the lowest setting for my burner. Thanks for the recipe!

For real Roesti, do not boil.  Shred the potatoes and then squeeze the shreds until all liquid stops running out.  You have to add paprika and garlic powder in addition to ingredients included here.  Also, a butter red wine and onion sauce should be made and poured over Roesti. You could also use button mushrooms in the sauce.

I was amazed at how much difference adding the milk to the potatoes made. Really good dish and not hard to make
