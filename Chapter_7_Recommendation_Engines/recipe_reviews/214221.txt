Was going to make meatloaf tonight, so I decieded to give it a shot.  Did not make the sauce, as I was short on time.  Used favorite canned sauce.  Was worried I wouldn't be able to find Creole seasoning in my Yankee grocery store but low and behold- there it was.  This gives it a very interesting flavor.  Fun to make, and pretty easy.  My husband and I both liked it.  TIP- be sure to mix dry ingredients before you try to mix them into the meat.

The only reason I am not giving this a 5 star rating is because of the time/effort to put the meal together.  It tasted great, but it was just way to time consuming for me.  I might try it again, but next time I will omit the homemade sauce and use a basil marinara from a jar instead ;-)

Tastes great and a very firm loaf so its filling but the amount of work involved was time consuming. This also meant for a lot more dishes to wash :(   Hubby really liked it for sandwiches though since it holds its shape better than most meatloaves. I couldn't find creole seasoning in the grocery store so I used the adobe seasoning I made up, also found on this site. Don't be put off with the amount of sauce it makes because once in the oven it will thicken.

This is good. I made the home made sauce which is an extra step but does have loads of flavor and makes the meatloaf tender. I did not add cheese because I did not have any and this was still really good.  This is a time consuming meatloaf but can be broken into stages to make it easier.  Next time I make it, I will make the sauce a day or two before and store in the fridge until I am ready to make the loaf.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought the sauce was worth the time. I did not have any cheese but it tasted really good without it anyways.

Good flavor, but a bit sloppy in presentation.
