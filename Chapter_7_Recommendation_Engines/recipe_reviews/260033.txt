Um... YUM!!! Thank you for this recipe! I took a chance even without any reviews yet and I'm glad I did!  I've been following another recipe that called for less bananas and was much more dense and kind of dry. This is my new go-to!! I followed it exactly except added a little shaved dark chocolate. I don't even know if that did much though. The muffins are delicious. My kids, husband and I love them.
