A tasty and flavorful restaurant-quality dish.  Don't listen to some of the other 

reviewers: some did things to make a sauce/gravy; this dish isn't supposed to have a 

gravy.  (Look at the picture I submitted.)  But the concerns about drying out the
potatoes and cauliflower are justified.  To solve this, during the times when
one is supposed to cook with the pan covered, make sure there is a little water at 

the bottom of the pan.  Every few minutes uncover and add a little water.  This
makes sure everything stays damp and steams as it cooks.  I found it necessary
to steam for an extra 5-10 minutes to cook the potatoes sufficiently.
Also, I used 50% more spices than listed.  Salt I added to taste *at the end*,
not where recommended in the recipe.  (How would one decide if something tastes
right before the vegetables are done cooking?)  Finally, I forgot about the
cilantro and didn't miss it.

I made this according to the directions, but it seemed so dry... I added a small can of coconut milk and a diced tomatoe at the end of the cook time, and then simmered an additional 8 minutes or so.  The result was delicious!  I think the tomatoe and coconut milk should really be included in the recipe.  Also, I used curry and a small amount of cumin instead of tumeric.

I've made this a couple times and it turns out pretty good. I like this recipe because it's not as involved as recipes for aloo gobi in my Indian cookbooks. What is with the coconut milk though? If you want traditional aloo gobi, stop taking one reviewer's suggestion and don't add coconut milk. It's not part of this dish, and if you add it, you're making something completely different, and most likely, something sweet. Mustard seeds are always a great addition and the more cilantro the better, but if you find that it's too dry, add a 1/2 cup of crushed tomatoes and it will be perfect!

This dish is excellent with a few changes. Note that this recipe has no liquids which will becomes too dry. I followed the recipe up to the adding of the potatoes and seasoning but instead of cooking 5-7 minutes, I put it in my crock-pot with 1/2 cup vegetable broth and a can of stewed tomatoes (because I didn't have diced tomatoes).  Cooked on high for 2 1/2 hours (after the first 30 minutes I added the Cauliflower stirring to saturate with the spices. I added a little more milk (maybe 1/4 cup or less) after 2 hrs and stirred.  The cooking time will depend on how big you cut the potatoes, I cubed them about 1-2" wide. I chose the crock-pot method because I was going to be busy preparing the Chicken Tikka Masala to serve with it.  This turned out delicious!!! my picky teenager loved both dishes.

This is a very basic version of the traditional Aloo Gobi recipe. I did not find it any drier than other versions of this dish. It is supposed to be very dry; not all Indian recipies are intended to have a sauce!!  

I found the flavor however to be fairly bland, though not disagreeable. This is a minimal recipe that would be good to use on a day-to-day basis, not for company. The exclusion of onions is also regrettable, since that eliminates a lot of the traditional flavor. the paprika is a little different from other Aloo Gobi versions I have tried, but I would probably use less of it, and add a little more zing via green chili peppers in my own version.

Although I cook with minimal oil, I will have to say that this recipe requires more than 1 Tbsp as there is quite a lot of cauliflower. A couple of suggestions - cut the potatoes smaller than the cauliflower as they take longer to cook. Cover and cook over slow heat.  Add cilantro after the vegetables have cooked and allow to heat through.  This allows the fresh flavour to remain. Gobi Aloo is meant to be dry - it is not a curry, so pls don't follow other reviews of adding coconut milk.

The recipe is really good but it's missing some things. First off, it was really dry and it should really have some curry to it. I realized that the colour wasn't catching on to all of the cauliflower... just the tops and bottoms. I used half of a big cauliflower which might have been more than a pound. I added tomatoes (which you really should put in) and one cup of water. The water made it lose a bit of flavour and it was still dry. So after reading the other reviews, I added 1/2 can coconut milk and that made a good curry base. Also, I didn't have cilantro, so I used parsley instead, which worked well. In total, I put in twice the amount of spices that the recipe asked for, for the half a cauliflower I used. This makes the curry rich and flavourful. You need to simmer the dish on low for about 20 minutes longer as well. In the end ...it turned out great!

My family and I thought this was delicious.  I added about 1/3 cup half and half like another reviewer, and also 1 can of diced tomatoes and the remainder of a bag of peas.  Tasted great.  The only change I would make would be to add the garam masala just about 5 minutes before it's done cooking, otherwise it makes the dish taste a little bitter.  A little lemon juice can cure the bitterness, though!

This is a nice, basic recipe.  I agree with the reviewer who added tomatoes. It certainly enhanced the taste. I also added more garam masala because I like spicy food.  
To the reviewers who skipped the asafoetida, while asafoetida does not appear to really add anything to the taste, it's a traditional digestive added to Indian recipes.  I find that it is especially helpful when you eat spicy or rich, oily food.  So do add a pinch, even if you don't quite taste anything.

Aloo Gobi is supposed to be dry! DO NOT eat it with rice. It is eaten with bread (roti or naan) so the consistency shouldn't be thin.  I agree with other reviewers that adding coconut milk or extra liquids to make it less dry will make this an entirely different dish. I was surprised this recipe didn't call for onions. Definitely saute some onions with the garlic, cumin seeds and ginger.

I liked this recipe a lot. It is dry, but I think it is supposed to be that way, because youre supposed to eat it with a dahl.

I often make Indian food.  We eat it almost once a week.  This is an excellent recipe.  It is supposed to be a dry curry.  This recipe is a good base if you want to change it a bit also.  I have doubled all the ingredients, added thinly sliced carrots and onion at the same time as the potato.  Then I threw in some left over peas, from dinner the night before.  It was fabulous!  So, make this as shown the first time around, then have fun playing around with it. Again, A very good recipe!

Holy Cow this was good! I went a bit heavier than suggested on the oil and spices and threw in about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.  Make sure you cook long enough for the cauliflower to be just a hair crisper than than the potatoes. Fantastic I say.  I was pressed for time, so I served with purchased pitas intstead of making a naan--brushed with olive oil and heated in the oven.  Served alongside some sliced, August-fresh, local tomatoes and this dish really rocked.

this type of Indian dish is supposed to be dry. The solution is to make this as written, except for the cooking time, which is much to short, and eat it with chutney or raita, an Indian yoghurt dish. In most Indian dishes the salt is added at the end of the cooking period.

As written, the recipe could use some more details/rewriting (some suggestions: total weight of potatoes since "medium" is kind of arbitrary; an approximate size to cut the potatoes and cauliflower, which is a huge factor in how long it takes to cook; I also agree with adding the salt near the end), but as another reviewer said, it's a good base for tweaking to your own tastes. I made it with all of the ingredients listed in the amounts listed except the cilantro because I didn't have it. I cut the potatoes into roughly 1/2" x 1" cubes and the cauliflower into rough pieces about 1 1/2" square, and put them both into the pan when it says to add the potatoes. Adding 3-4 tbsp water every few minutes kept it from burning. All in all, it took about 20 minutes to cook the vegetables (mine were starting to fall apart, which was what I wanted so the small bits would make a kind of paste to stick to the vegetables). I added a diced Roma tomato about 15 minutes in and it broke down nicely. Next time I am going to add some pureed onion with the cumin seed/garlic/ginger for a bit more flavor. It seemed rather bland when it was just finished cooking, but letting it sit to cool a bit made it taste much better. I will definitely make it again.  Another tip that others may find useful: prep and measure out everything before you start cooking - finding and measuring spices is much easier when you don't have a hot pan on the stove :)

I followed this recipe as directed but also added a diced tomato (would rather have used two but I only had one) and some frozen peas near the end.  I added a half cup or so of water every few minutes throughout the cooking process to keep the vegetables from burning and to help the spices seem less powdery.  The recipe made a TON of food- I fed my family one night, had a big lunch of leftovers and I still have a sandwich sized tupperware left.  Unless your servings are huge you will make more than the 4 mentioned.   This was only my second indian (indian style...) recipe and I found it very easy.  It was a big hit and my dad said he could smell it cooking all the way out in the driveway.  It was a very inviting smell.  Will definitely make again, with more tomatoes next time.

I must have made several mistakes with this recipe. In hind site, my main mistake was not doing a trial run.  My potato cubes must have been far too large, as they were rock hard after the given cooking time.  After another half hour had past, I dashed to the computer in a panic to read your reviews.  A few of you had also had this problem, so I followed your advice and starting adding a good splash of water with each periodic stir.  In all, I would have added an extra cup of water over an additional half hour.   But it still tasted so bland.  Not knowing what else to do, I added a good shake of curry powder and then half a cup of cream.  My family ate it, but didn’t comment one way or the other, which was a disappointment after all the time I had invested.  Ah well . . . we all have recipes that beat us.

We enjoyed this.  I tweeked it just a bit by adding an onion to the spices and oil and cooking until translucent and adding about 2 cups of cubed eggplant with the potatoes and cauliflower.  The cooking time was closer to 30 minutes to get the vegetables tender crisp.  I added about 1/2 cup of water to keep them from burning.  The result was the right consistency, not too wet.

Very good, and very easy.  As many other reviewers suggest, adding water to the pan will help the veggies cook thoroughly and keep from burning; I decided to add more oil a little bit at a time though, because I didn't want the cauliflower to get that mushy texture and watered-down taste that comes with steaming.  Also, I used fresh grated ginger, because that was what I already had in the house, and it tasted incredibly fresh and vibrant.  This dish heated up great for leftovers, too.

this was a great recipe, very authentic Indian. I did add twice as much ginger, garlic, & cumin though, also a half an onion. I agree with the other reviews, leave out the coconut milk, it totally changes the recipe. I did boil the potatoes first, then added them to the spices with the cauliflower, also added a chopped tomatoe. it was great!! don't leave out the cilantro!

I really liked this dish even if I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower. I know Gobi Aloo isn't supposed to be saucy but I had a can of cubed tomatoes so that I could serve it on rice.

Remember to turn down the heat when you are cooking the potatoes. They get easily burn. I will have to try making it with coconut milk or adding water next time, cause it does taste dry like another reviewer says.

I made this and found it to be pretty tasty. My only mods were to use smoked paprika, added green peas and did add about a cup of water to help steam as some other reviewer did. As some one else pointed out, best to salt to taste when the dish is done. I will make this again. Healthy and tasty! Might try adding some tomatoes and chilies next time for a little more kick.

Dry? Not mine. Added 1/4 cup of broth; switched the 2 potatoes to a sweet potato (better for you). Even my boys liked it, a very rare occurrence.  Very delicious.

Disappointing- I started out with the recommended amount of spices (the quantity of which I was dubious of) and when I tasted it I found it almost completely flavorless. So I doubled them- still not enough flavor. Tripled most them- still not enough flavor. This recipe only became edible when I added a can of tomatoes. 

Also, do not forget to add water when cooking otherwise you can look forward to burnt Aloo Gobi.

I did like this recipe. But I agree with others it is a bit dry looking. But I didn't  find that a bad thing neccesarily. It did seem a bit overspiced and a little bitter, so I added a large can of stewed plum tomatoes. I also added some chick peas to it at the end and served it with grilled haddock and quinoa.
It was great.
The next few times I made it, I waited until all the other spices were incorporated as directed, EXCEPT
the ground cumin. I discover it's the amount of this that determines if the dish became bitter or not. Too much kills it. I also topped it with the cilantro, and a few fresh grean peas. Was restaurant worthy! Everyone loved it, and my son asked me to make it
when he came home to visit . That's an ultimate compliment from my uber green organic eating son!

Usually I do not have much luck replicating the flavors I get in Indian restaurant dishes. This was the exception! It tasted authentic. The only problem I had with it is that the time in the recipe is not long enough to get the potatoes and cauliflower to cook thoroughly. I had to add time to it and as other reviewers mentioned additional water was necessary so the food would not bun. Next time I would cook or par cook the potatoes first.

Scrumptious! Followed recipe to the "T" except we used bottled ginger garlic paste from our local Indian grocer and increased all spices. Made this as a side dish and seved with mild curry flatfish, nan, and mango lassi.

We had an Indian style buffet and this was my favorite recipe.  I added 1/4 cup of water to simmer the potatoes but followed the recipe otherwise.  Even my cauliflower-hating husband enjoyed it.

I made this to a group of friends who all love Indian food and everyone loved it.  I stayed completely with the receipe but did add a bit of water at the bottom with the potatoes as they cooked.  We'll definitely make this again.

There is a debate here about whether or not this needs a gravy.  the first time I had allo gobi, some friends from the Punjab region of Pakistan made it - and it had a thick rich gravy, so I have adjusted this accordingly.
I add 2/3 c cream and some water to coat the veggies - it helps distribute the spices to all surface area.  then I cook it down until it is a thick, but not plentiful, gravy.  I have also been known to add 2 handfuls of green peas just before serving (my kids like it better this way).

This was a very good recipe, probably better than I've had in a lot of Indian restaurants!  I agree that it is too dry as shown, and I added about 1/2 cup of water and let the ingredients steam cook.  I also had to let it cook about 10 minutes longer then the recipe said.  But it turned out delicious!

This had me worried when it was cooking, but it turned out fantastic!  I added a tiny bit of water and a can of tomatoes to help it hold some moisture and I almost doubled the spices.  I made it with the Easy Shrimp Curry recipe on this site and my boyfriend said that this is his new favorite meal!

Very authentic tasting (just like the restaurants!).  Perfect amount of spices - mild, just as I like it!  I used 1 tsp. salt, then added about 1/4 tsp. when it was finished cooking.  I didn't have ginger paste, so I used about 2 tsp. fresh, chopped.  I used a lot more cilantro - 1/2 of a bunch.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I think that the spices are right but something seems to be missing.  I had a lot of trouble sauteing two potatoes and a cauliflower in onne tbsp oil!! If I didn't add a bit of tomato, it would have stuck to the pot. Also, the cooking time was dramatically longer than the recipe indicates.

The combination of spices in this recipe is heavenly!  The only thing that I did differently was add some plain yogurt and let it simmer to keep it from becoming dry.  A sure favourite!

This dish was simple to make.  My family loved it and I pre-boiled the cauliflower just a little.  Chopped florets and diced potatoes then just followed recipe.  Very tasty and will make again.  LOVED IT!!

This was delicious. You're definitely going to want to add water while the potatoes and cauliflower cooks. I ended up using about a cup and the Gobi Aloo still remained dry in the end. Which is how I've always had it at good Indian restaurants. The stewed tomatoes are also a great addition.

great recipe! it was very simple to make. I actually doubled the spices and added chicken stock to assist in steaming the potatoes. I also added a cup of petite peas (at the end) to have a green veggie and for color contrast. I served it with garlic naan for a wonderful complete dinner. Enjoy.

Not a bad recipe but definitely on the bland side as written.
As another reviewer pointed out, this isn't meant to have a sauce. However, I  had to add at least a half cup of chicken broth to keep it from completely drying out and burning on the bottom. I also increased the spices by 50% and thought this wasn't enough. If I try this again I'll double the spices.

YUM!  Delicious!  Pretty much followed the recipe as written, but I did need to add a splash of chicken stock a couple times to keep the potatoes from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. . .seriously, just a splash, not enough to make a sauce.

I used 4 potatoes, soaked in water for a few minutes to remove some of the starch. Added a can of drained garbanzo beans and two tomatoes about five minutes after the cauliflower.  Eyeballed the spices and used some curry powder in place of the cumin and turmeric.  Needed to cook 30 minutes total for the potatoes to be soft.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe closely and the dish turned out a bit bland. I added in more of the spices and even a bit of tabasco. Maybe it's just a matter of preference. Also the proportions are a bit off (cauliflower vs potato.)

Very good. I will make again. It is supposed to be dry. Aloo Gobi does not have a sauce. Last reviewer had a great suggestion to keep a small amount of water at the bottom of the pan to steam the vegetables.

I enjoyed this very much! I did add some stewed tomatoes as suggested by the submitter, and like other reviewers I added just a bit of water while the vegetables were cooking and added the cilantro at the end of cooking.  Very flavorful and delicious!  I tossed some chickpeas into the leftovers for a little extra protein in my lunch tomorrow.  This will definitely be a repeat - Thank you!

This is a great combination of coking methods and spices, but I had to change it a little.  I doubled the oil, added 1/4 of an onion (thin sliced), used two cloved garlic, 1/2 habanera, doubled the cumin, added 15 diced cherry tomatoes plus 1 tsp paste with 1/4 cup water, and omitted the cilantro (I did not want a South East Asian dish!).  I reccomend sauteeing the garlic, onion, habanera, and ginger first until tender,m then adding the potatoes with all spices except garm masala.  saute until potatoes are almost done, then stir in the cauliflower and tomatoes.  after about 5 minutes, add the paste and water with the garam masala and smother until cooked through.

I give this 4 stars for its versatility and for being a nice base recipe to play with. I made one variation that turned out really yummy (but not for those on low-fat diets!) - I added some tomato sauce to sauteed onions before adding potatoes and cauliflower and then some half-and-half at the end of the cooking time - this makes it more special-occasion fare I think. I also bumped up the spices to taste, including adding some garam masala. The toasted cumin seeds really do add a nice touch and makes your kitchen smell wonderful. One thing I noticed is that the potatoes take a long time to cook, so add them first and wait until they're nearly done before adding the cauliflower. Thanks for sharing this recipe - I'll definitely make it again!

My husband loved this.  He thought it was better than the Gobi Aloo from Whole Foods. I didn't have any garam masala so I used the "Easy Garam Masala" recipe on this website and made my own.

This is a great recipe for gobi aloo. I doubled the spices because thats just how I am. Cook on with lid on and is shouldn't be dry. Add a little butter or extra oil at the end if it seems dry. I love this kind of food. I served with Saffron and Cilatro long grain rice.

I read a lot of reviews before I tried this dish, so I took the advice, doubling the spices and adding mustard seeds, an onion, and a can of diced tomatoes. I also substituted fresh ginger for the paste and curry powder for the garam masala (only because I had run out of the latter). It definitely took longer to cook than the recipe suggested, but that may have been because my potatoes and cauliflower chunks were on the large side (I don't think the recipe specified, so maybe the author cut small dice). Ultimately, my partner and I thought it was very tasty. He took the leftovers to a potluck, and I offer his report: "Everyone loved your curry -- it may have been one of the biggest hits at the potluck.  Even got high compliments from a woman who used to own a restaurant and was a caterer.  It all got eaten, which has never happened with my couscous dish." On a second go-around, I might add fresh or dried chilies (some cayenne, at least). I've never had aloo gobi with tomatoes, so I might try some vegetable broth next time.

Took everyone's advice and kept water in the bottom, which worked well, although it did take much longer than stated. I nearly doubled all spices, as well as garlic and ginger. It tasted great!

This was very good.  I made it exactly as stated.  I myself could use more spice, but for Grumpy's sake I am glad I didn't.  He actually cleaned his portion right up!  I would make this again and wouldn't change a thing!

I made a few minor changes to this recipe, none worth mentioning other than that I finely diced a harabanaro pepper (without the placenta and seeds) and sauted it along with the ginger and garlic, which I doubled.  Wonderful dish, will definately make it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love Gobi Aloo and did add some veggie broth and cream to this dish. The cook time was also much longer than indicated but the end result was fantastic. It is fine to add some broth, milk or other liquid to moisten this up. Tomatoes would have been a good idea too. I also found the spices a little mild (could have been the lack of mustard seed) and definately spruced mine up with extra chili peppers. Be creative with this one.. Love it!

It's so dry! I took the advice of others and added both 1/2 can of coconut milk AND nearly 1/2 cup of vegetable broth, but still it was dry. I didn't have any paprika, so used a little cayenne instead, which made it quite spicy. Also, used nearly 2 tsp of fresh ginger in place of the ginger paste. I don't think I'll bother to make this again, as there are better Indian dishes on this site -- see "Cholay," or "Absolutely Perfect Panak Paneer" or "Curried Chickpeas."

The lady in last review was correct, by adding the coconut milk and tomatoes it gave the dish more taste and prevented it from being dry.  This is a must do recipe.

So i made this. Now saying it would be done in 17 mins is a joke, it took me around a hour to make, it was actually very bland, i added 2 small tomatoes and cayenne pepper and still ended up puting some franks red hot to add some kind of flavour and heat. If i ever made this again i would at least double if not triple the spices.

Great base recipe. I skipped the paprika, as it's not traditional, and added asafoetida.  I missed tomatoes in the recipe, as those are typical. Unfortunately, the cauliflower was still firm & required further cooking. As a result, the potatoes were overdone and the flavors were diluted. Next time, I'd parboil the cauliflower and I think it would be perfect!

Made it and loved it. So easy to prepare. I usually go for a spicier dish, but this had a lovely mild Indian accent. My sister loved it too. I like easy to prepare weekday suppers. This recipe is it! We always have these ingredients on hand. A great side dish or as part of a multi-dish Indian inspired meal. Add Dal, naan, a salad (mango?) and lassi and you are all set.

I don't know what happened, but mine was SO bland! If I were to make this again, I'd need to double or even triple the spices I guess. It smelled great while it was cooking, but the end result was really disappointing.

Sooooooo gooooood but I made it with the addition of a can of coconut milk, diced tomatoes, chickpeas, and some tomato paste.  I used curry paste instead of all the separate spices and this will be in my regular rotation for sure.  I can't comment on the recipe as posted since I made so many changes as others suggested.

Not a huge fan. We found this bland, despite following the recipe as closely as possible. I, like many others, had to add water to keep the potatoes and garlic from sticking. Although, come to think of it: I ended up with far more than 4 servings - more like seven - so it's possible that my proportions were off, which would explain the blandness; except that I used one head of cauliflower and one large potato, which if anything should have left me with fewer vegetables. Oh well, who knows? Thanks anyway!

It was kind-of bland. Even with a whole can of tomatoes, it seemed a little dry, and not enough of a PUNCH of flavors I was expecting.

I agree with Mark P. This dish is not intended to be a masala / gravy dish. I added mustard seeds with the cumin seeds, and up the spices across the board. I added a touch of water each time I stirred to keep the veggies sweating and added 5 minutes to the potatoes, and another 5 minutes with the gobi. I also added a diced fresh tomato toward the end, though not traditionally found in aloo gobi. I would definitely serve to guests with my additions.

Love the spices in this recipe. Did add some diced tomatoes for moisture. Served with Basmati rice. Next time i'm going to try substituting chick peas for potato so as to add a little protein. Delicious recipe though!

Was yummy. I just didn't like how dry it was. I ended up adding a can of tomatoes last minute to add a little moisture. But I liked how well the spices worked together. I doubled them like another reviewer suggested and am glad I did.

I attempted to make this tonight, with the things I had on hand. I had most things, but no ginger paste or cilantro. It was still delicious! Now a staple for this college aged vegan. A side note-this dish really isn't supposed to have a gravy/sauce when made traditionally, so just add small amounts of water as needed for steaming, and you'll still be very happy with the result :)

I went ahead and added the "bit of stewed tomatoes" and substituted dried ingredients for fresh.  Yum!!!  Quite spicy, though.

It was good but not spectacular.  The cauliflower did actually take 30 minutes to make it tender, so adjust your time.

Quite good, except that it's nearly impossible to cook this without the addition of water, it becomes far too dry!  I had to add lots of water throughout the cooking process in order to get the potatoes and cauliflower to a soft consistency.  The final product was dry (not curry-like), and tasted quite good.  I'm going to have to get better garam masala, however!

After the cooking time stated in the recipe the potatoes and cauliflower were still too hard and the pan was very dry.  I added a little water and put it back on the heat until they were tender.  The flavor was very good and I will probably make this again.

i personally thought the recipe was good. even my husband enjoyed it. i did a few things differently but don't think that made a huge difference. firstly, i added a little bit of water but just so the veggies cooked faster and i eventually let the water dry. i also added about a tsp of coriander powder. near completion, i added about 1-1.5 tbsp of tomato puree for taste, maintaining the dryness. o yea, i added peas but only because i wanted to eat peas as well. and lastly, i agree with the users who said to add the cilantro at the end - the taste is better retained. this is a good fast everyday recipe!

Excellent recipe!  I did add about a cup of coconut milk with the potatoes along with one chopped tomato. Without the coconut milk, the potatoes would have stuck to the pan and would have gotten burned, but the coconut milk added great flavor.   I also added some dried red chilies for extra spice and flavor.

I loved this recipe!  I prepared this as a side dish with some curry chicken and it was a big hit.  This is not a very spicy dish and I will likely add additional spices the next time I make it.  I'm not a big cauliflower fan but the potato/cauliflower mix was very pleasant and the texture of this dish was a large part of what I liked about it.

I was very disappointed with this recipe.  After reading all of the reviews I agreed that it wasn't suppose to have a curry such as a masala but I never thought it would be completely dry.  I spent 3 weeks in India and this was one of my favorite dishes there but this recipe was no where near the dish I had while traveling.  After I realized that it was completely dry I added a can of diced tomatoes which helped.  I wouldn't make this again.

I doubled the spices, i may have tripled them.  it was really good but it was still much drier than what i get at indian restaurants. I know it is not supposed to saucy but i've always gotten a little bit of sauce when i order it. I don't think coconut milk is the answer and I tried the water idea but it still wasn't what i wanted.  I didn't have the canned tomato so i'll try that next time.

l loved the recipe..as a dry dish.. but I did add red onions..
 (I live in New Zealand) my measurements probably differ.. but I  used fresh garlic & ginger plus added more cumin seeds & plenty of chopped coriander ( cilantro).. I wld definitely leave it as a dry dish...

Nice dish to have a swift meal, filling and different. I also found it needs extra stuff though, probably I am used to having more veggies and color in my food...so this time I added carrots =) I also made it following the exact recipe.

This was really tasty!  I made it as written except put it all in the crock pot and cooked on low for 3-4 hours.  I should have waited to add the cauliflower because it kind of fell apart towards the end, but the taste was still fantastic.  I served this with Butter Chicken from this site along with Naan bread I purchased.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy, healthy and good. Nice to be able to adjust the spices according to taste - I made mine quite hot. The four stars comes from the fact that it is only a nice SIDE dish, not amazing enough to stand by itself I'd say

I made it according to the instructions and it came out a little blah. It needs more seasoning. 
In all fairness it was good.

In hindsight, i would've blanched the cauliflower first to shorten cooking time & improve flavor. I also felt that something was missing and i added a dash of cinnamon during cooking/tasting. Also added a small semi hot red pepper (whole). The cinnamon really perked up the spice mix. I know this is a dry dish, but to keep potatoes and spices from charring i added not only a lil water but also enough yogurt to moisten. I am happy with the result.

This is a great recipe. I followed it exactly but listened to other reviewers who added moisture as it cooked. I added a little chicken broth but would not do that again - I would add water as someone else suggested.

This is an embarrassing recipe for an Indian dish. And I'm embarrassed I made it hoping it would taste like an Indian dish. I mean, it was ok. But boring. I found this recipe online after I made it and look forward to trying this guy's mother's recipe. It's significantly different! He lists some staples in the recipe and this one lacked quite a few

I left out tumeric and gran marsala because  I  didn't have it in the house.  I added a sweet potato,  some onion and  grape tomatoes, a pinch of  cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I used coconut oil to cook it in.  This was delicious.

I love this recipe! I add a 14.5 oz can of petite diced tomatoes with the juice. It helps steam the veggies.  I also use about 1.5 times the spices.  Delicious!

I didn't make this with potatoes as we are avoiding simple sugars. And because I didn't have cumin seeds, I used mustard seeds instead... Overall, I like the spices that go into this which results in a flavourful cauliflower dish.

I found this recipe a little bland, despite seasoning with a few generous sprinklings of salt at the end.  I added water as needed to help the cooking process but ensured the final product was still quite dry.  I didn't have any cilantro on hand but I think a good handful would have added a nice kick to the dish.

Agree that this was delicious, but also that you need to almost double the spice. I added red chiles too and chopped up a few of the whole canned tomatoes in my cupboard. It's delicious. I'll make this again but with more chiles.

I am only giving this 3 stars as it didn't really work for me. I am sure it is quite authentic, it just didn't suite my palette. I made as instructed (except followed one reviewers advice by adding a bit of water to help steam as I could tell it was going to be very dry.) It's very flavorful and good, but not really main course material. I guess that was my mistake. Still having a lot of fun trying all the various Indian dishes, thank you for the easy recipe.

delicious!  I added a can of crushed tomatoes at the end (my fiance felt it was too dry-- though I like it both ways), and also added two dried chiles for a little extra kick.  We also added some frozen peas, which isn't true to the dish, but was super tasty. I'll be making this again--- I love how healthy it is.

This was pretty good - I made it as a side for a butter chicken dish. I didn't have whole cumin seeds on hand, so I added just under a teaspoon of ground cumin instead (in addition to the other ground cumin called for in the recipe). I also added a can of corn kernels when I added the cauliflower, which was really good. I had to add water during the cooking process to keep it from drying out. The potatoes didn't seem to absorb any flavor - maybe this was because I used baby potatoes. Overall though, very tasty combination of spices!

We really liked this recipe!  A great way to use cauliflower.  We added the stewed tomatoes and thought it worked well.  Like the others have said, adding coconut milk doesn't make any sense at all and it's great as is!

Not quite as good as my favorite Indian restaurant, but it was okay for a weeknight meal.

Just did not like the taste.  The cooking time was wrong.  It took 3x as long and I had to keep adding water as it was cooking.

This recipe tasted delicious but the curry seemed very runny. I think the next time I make this recipe I will try to drain the tomatoes before adding them into the curry. Perhaps this is why those people who used fresh tomatoes had so much more success... Thank you, though, for the curry!

I was disappointed in the way this turned out and my hubby took one bite and said "I don't like it..." which is not the usual reaction I get from him.  I did use a little water as suggested by one reviewer but the flavor was bland and boring.  50% more spice would have helped.  I may try to redeem the leftovers by making a tomato curry and adding it when reheating...but not something I would make again.

This was very tasty indeed.  But I also doubled the spices including the cilantro, ginger and garlic, and added 3/4 cup light coconut milk and 1/3 cup of water to stop it from burning.  I used a wok and found it took about 3 times longer to cook than specified in the recipe.  Very yummy though, thank you very much for taking the time to share this recipe.

Great recipe but be warned, it causes strong aromas to fill the house, not to my hubby's liking.  I was trying to copy the Aloo Gobi from my local indian restaurant, so I added 2 T flour, 2 T butter, and 1/2 cup 2% milk to make a creamier sauce.  Very good!

I followed others' advice, and added half a can of coconut milk and a can of diced tomatoes. I wish I'd omitted the garam masala - there is something in it I don't much like. I will make this again but use a different curry powder.
