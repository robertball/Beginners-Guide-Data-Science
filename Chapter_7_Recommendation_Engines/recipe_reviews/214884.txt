Oh No!  Something went wrong and I'm the one who submitted the recipe.  I made this for my family after picking a few cups of fresh berries and it was a disaster!  My mom said it's due to the humidity we are facing (the temp here has been 29 but 44 with the humidex).  I should have added less butter to the crumble mixture because it made everything a soggy mess.  So please add a bit of butter at a time, just until the mixture holds together.

This is so delicious, quick, and simple! It's a wonderful dessert or breakfast. Mine took a little longer to bake. I'm sure I'll be making this again!

Great recipe, I used butter instead of shortening for the cake. Also added brown sugar to the topping for more flavor. Served with lemon ice cream, so good!!!

Delcious! I one and halfed  (not double, lol) this recipe and baked it in a 13x9 casserole dish.  It was very moist and flavorful and much better then the buckle I tried last year.  It's very much like a blueberry muffin but the cake part is a little more cakey then a muffin.

This was very good this morning for breakfast.  The cake part was light and fluffy.  The only problem I had was that the cake was done and the topping was not.  So the bottom of the cake was a little over done by the time that the top was done.  This may have been my fault because I had to use frozen blueberries.  It still tasted very good and I will try again next season when I have fresh blueberries.

We loved this so much I ade it twice in the same week.  The second time I made one and a half recipe and baked it in a 7 x 11 dish.  The cake part isn't too sweet, but rich and moist and the crumb topping is just perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

As close to my Grandma's as I have been able to find. Very easy and I use a spring-form pan for easy serving. I've made it with both blueberries and strawberries, excellent warm with cream or cold for breakfast.

Made this for my family last night, it was excellent. The only change I made was instead of a 1/3 cup of milk, I used almond milk. Yummy!

I've rarely baked with blueberries, but this recipe might get me to change that.  I made this exactly as described and it turned out just beautifully -- my husband and I finished the whole pan in less than three days.  The texture is more like a coffeecake than a crisp or cobbler, and the leftovers (if there are any) reheat very well.  I'll definitely make this again, probably for a holiday breakfast.

If there were six stars, that's what I'd give this recipe! Other than using butter instead of shortening, and adding about 1/2 cup more blueberries because I had them, I followed the recipe exactly, using a glass 9x9" baking dish. This is the most delicious blueberry dessert I've ever made! I topped my serving with a flourish of whipped light cream -- heaven!

Great recipe!  Easy to make and the kids love it, especially with a little whipped cream on top.  My daughter has made it herself a few times as well.

A new family favorite!! We live in northern New Hampshire and had some nice fresh picked blueberries I wanted to do justice to. This was perfect. I plan to make another tomorrow :) .

This was very good except....the butter in the topping made the top of mine greasy, with puddles of butter.  I've made a note to not use butteer in the topping next time.

Delicious way to use up some leftover fresh blueberries--really easy to make & a great taste. I love mine served warm with a little half/half but my daughers prefer vanilla ice cream.

I baked for an extra 10 minutes or so because even though a toothpick came out clean when inserted after 35 minutes, the topping looked too moist and gooey instead of golden brown.  After setting, it actually was perfectly done.  Next time I may reduce the butter in the topping, as in TrudyNH's review, but even as written I think this is a lovely recipe!  We used fresh blueberries that we had just picked the day before.

Very nice, simple and moist.  I did a 1.5 of the recipe (using two eggs) and it was just the right size for a 9x13.

We mixed the blueberries into the batter, sprinkled some on the top of the batter, and it was delicious, my teenage sons are gulping it down! I did mix some brown sugar into the topping which added to it.

I made this recipe without any changes to take to work, and my co-workers ate almost all of it. It was moist and had just the right amount of blueberries.

This dessert was yummy and I would have given it 5 stars but I thought that the blueberries should have been mixed in with the brown sugar/cinnamon topping as to make the blueberries less "tart".  I added 1/3 cup of sour cream (light) to the cake mixture to give it some added moistness and upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp. instead of 1/2 tsp.  Thanks for the great dessert!!

I followed the recipe but mistakenly put a half stick of butter in the batter part instead of 1/4.  It tasted ok but I'm sure it would have been better without my mistake.  Hubby like this dish, I thought it was just ok.  Prefer a cobbler more.

Love this recipe. I have to triple the cake portion for my family. Also, I added sour cream to the cake portion to make it moist. I used thawed blueberries, and coated them with flour so they weren't too juicy.  Absolutely the best dessert! Served with vanilla ice cream.

Followed the recipe exactly.  I felt it didn't have a lot of flavor.  It was dry and bland.

If I could give this 6 stars I would. I made very few minor adjustments such as: combined 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the flour mixture; substituted  almond milk for regular milk (I didn't have regular milk on hand); added 1 teaspoon vanilla to the batter; and went wild with fresh frozen blueberries --use frozen (enough to generously cover the batter). Absolutely delicious!

I halved this recipe and baked it in a loaf pan. I was disappointed with the cake itself. It lacked flavor and was not sweet enough in my opinion. The topping was good but probably would not use this recipe again

Yum!! I tripled the recipe and made it on a half-sheet pan for a church social.  I followed the directions with two exceptions: (1) I quadrupled the streusel part because you can never have too much streusel, and (2) because it was an extremely humid day, I I cut back a bit on the butter (after reading the review of TrudyNH who said that when she made on a humid day, the streusel all melted together). My streusel turned out golden and delicious, and the cake was moist and FULL of blueberries.  Even though I tripled the recipe and baked in a half-sheet pan, it was done in the time stated in the recipe.  I will definitely make this again.  Its the best blueberry buckle recipe I have tried.

Made it twice in one week with fresh wild blueberries. A definite hit just as written. Had to add 15 min. To cook time for the base

This recipe was easy and the final product was delicious!  It's not overly sweet, but has enough sugar to complement the berries.  I will definitely be adding this dessert to my summer repertoire!

In one word....delicious.  So glad I tried this recipe for my beautiful fresh blueberries.  This is exactly what I wanted it to be, lots of blueberries with a small amount of cake.  Hubby enjoyed his with vanilla ice cream.  The only thing I changed was used butter instead of shortening.  Thanks for sharing your awesome recipe TrudyNH.

I made this recipe exactly as listed. It did take about 45 minutes in the oven, though. Loved it! Not overly sweet. NJ has wonderful blueberries, too! Thanks!

So, I made this recipe exactly as written. I've never made anything like this before, so when my batter turned out sticky and thick, I figured I did something wrong... but I could figure out what. After 40min of baking it still was pretty soggy (after the blueberries burst). I didn't think it was going to make it, but I let it bake longer and kept a close eye on it. I read the one review stating a similar problem, but it's only 5C today... So I don't think humidity is a problem.  After looking "soggy" crumble up on the net, I found out that I shouldn't have softened the butter, but cut it up really small and mixed it that way cold... Well, since I didn't want it to go to waste, i kicked up the temperature to 375F after 55min at 350F. I only baked it for 5 more minutes as the bottom was starting to look too brown.  Hopefully it will taste good with ice cream and you won't be able to tell it's soggy.
Just an update: my boyfriend ended up eating the entire dish in 2 days... So even though it turned out soggy and I cooked it too long, he loved it!

Loved It!  I was worried about there not being much batter but when it baked up, that thought went out the window.  Will make more when blueberries are in season.

Converted this to sugar free and gluten free with healthier fat than shortening - substituted  1.5 scoops of vegan protein powder  + 1 tbsp agave syrup for the sugar;
1/3 cup each of coconut flour and spelt flour instead of all purpose flour; coconut oil instead of shortening/ butter and for the topping I used grated coconut and muesli instead of flour.  I needed to add about 1/4 cup of water because the protein powder made the batter too dry. Turned out great. If you're concerned about gluten and sugar this should work without compromising taste.

Excellent! My husband is not a dessert person, but loved this. Will definitely make again with another batch of wild blueberries.
