My husband is from tunisia and I made this on the first night of ramadan. Delicious! It is just like the soup they make in his home country, the only difference is that they use tomato paste instead of canned tomatoes. The soup was kind of watery so I did the same. Good starter recipe for people like me who is unfamiliar with arabic cuisine.

My husband, guest and I loved it.  I changed some things, though.  I used boneless lamb cubes, added only 6 cups of water, used a whole 26 oz can of tomatoes, which I chopped in the can and added with the juice when I added the water.  I also used only 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon.  I added one whole can of beans, 1 1/2 onions, 3/4 cups bulgur and 4 beef bouillon cubes.  I did not add the mint.  It turned out to be more stew-like, but it was great after the changes.

Meh. . .It was okay.  The bone is CRUCIAL to the flavoring.  An interesting soup.  I could see trying this again.  The lamb was very tender and delicious.

this is OK but i find putting a green pepper in gives lots of flavour. All purpose spice mix found in any store is a must in this soup. People who may not like bulgar wheat can try vermicelli this is a more preffered lybian way. every eastern country changes it slightly. by the way for people who dont know shorba is NOT greek.

Good recipe. I used fresh mint and a spoonful of chilli flakes to give it a bit of a kick. Will definitely make it again.

I can't give it five stars because I changed the cooking method quite a bit, but the flavors are really great.  I did this in my slow cooker with bison stew meat instead of lamb.  I browned the bison in a skillet and then put it in the slow cooker along with all the other ingredients (except the bulgur and fresh parsley).  I cooked it on high for 3 hours and on low for two more, and added the bulgur during the last 30 minutes of cooking time, and I added the parsley right before serving.  It was a tasty rainy day meal.  Next time I'll probably thicken it with tomato paste toward the end.
