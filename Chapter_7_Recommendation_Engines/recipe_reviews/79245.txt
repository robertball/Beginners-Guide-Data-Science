These were very good and very easy.  I baked them as another reviewer suggested and they were perfectly cooked; I made them about 2" and cooked for 25 minutes at 350 then put them in tomato sauce while the pasta cooked.  I don't like dill, so I used oregano, and I used dried parsely, but everything else was the same.

Turned out great, but I made many little changes. First, I didn't have all the herbs/spices this recipe called for, so I used Montreal Stek Spice, dill, garlic, and pepper instead. I didn't have pepperjack cheese, so I used Havarty instead, which was wonderful! Instead of bread crumbs, I put some Ritz crackers in my food processor, with the above spices, and cheese, and pulsed it untill it was fine. Then, I just worked it all together with my fingers, formed it into balls, and placed them in a deep baking dish. I made Sweet and Sour Sacue II, from this site, and poured it over the top. I baked them at 350, for about 30 mins. Finally, I served this over white rice. Great recipe! Loved the addition of cheese in the Meatballs. YUM!!! :)

Awesome! My boyfriend made me these last night. He omitted the dill, added oregano and extra garlic. Instead of pepper jack cheese, he used mozzerella and a few shakes of red pepper flakes, along with some hot sauce. Today, with the leftovers, he made meatball sandwiches which were amazing (the meat was better on day two!).

Made this for 72 people - recipe scales perfectly

Only change I made was to leave out about 1/5 dill as I'm not desperately keen on it

Tips for cooking for that many people (its nearly 300 meatballs!)

Make them up in batches of 20 and then add one more - fry in these batches using your extra one to check when they are cooked. Then place in a massive pot and cover until they're ready to serve.

you need a big (100 litre) pot to mix this  much mixture - don't be afraid of the quantites of herbs etc - it scales perfectly.

I served these with one of the roasted vegetables recipes on here - the meatballs are very juicy but could have done with a tomato sauce or similar.

This recipe was so good I had 3 or 4 vegetarians who 'lapsed' to try them - one of them ended up eating 8 of them!!

I followed recipe, but since I was making meatball sandwiches, I used sliced pepper jack cheese to place on meat just before serving. For years, I have been looking for a recipe that would enhance the flavor of the meat instead of covering it up. The meatballs were flavorful enough that I could have skipped the spaghetti sauce if I had wanted to. This one's a keeper.
Thanks!

I wasn't sure what to expect with this recipe but was pleasantly surprised. I left out the cumin (yuck!), and they were still very tasty. The mustard was a great addition. Meat was easy to work with--not too dry or too meaty. Next time I make them I'll bake them instead (20 min., 350 degrees). I find baking meatballs to be much easier and they cook more evenly.

This is the ONLY meatball recipe I make any more.  I absolutely adore it.  The only changes I make are that I usually use cheddar cheese, add onion powder and skip the sliced onions, and bake them in the oven (at 350), purely for the convenience of not having to stand around at the stove.

I scaled this down to 3.5 servings to equal one pound of meat, but I used ground turkey, not beef. I also subbed garlic powder and dried parsley, and added a touch more mustard than called for (spicy brown). I baked the meatballs in the oven for 25 minutes at 400 degrees and didn't bother with the onion slices. I only did a dash of salt. Instead of pepperjack, I did monteray jack and added 1/2 tsp of crushed red pepper. We ate these with basmati rice and dipped them in BBQ sauce.

I made this tonight for my husband with mashed potatoes, roasted vege and steamed brocolli. Perfect combo and FABULOUS recipe. We will DEFINITELY have this again. I only used a small portion of meat, one egg, and eyeballed the other ingredients on the list, but this turned out amazing. I also baked mine in the oven as suggested. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

These are without doubt the BEST meatballs I have ever tasted! The only change I made was 1/2 the Dill Weed recommended, but note that it with cumin gives them their unusually delicious taste. Plus I baked mine in a 350 degree oven for 25 mins. I will be impressing people for years with these!

There's something weird about the taste, maybe a weird spice combo?
Changes I made:
* No dill weed
* white pepper instead of black
* full teaspoon of salt
* swiss and jarlsburg cheeses

These were really good! I tend to go for more of a kebab style seasoning, so next time I'll add more cumin, more parsley and minced onion. I also put them in the oven but after the first batch, I saw all the fat oozing out... My boyfriend insisted on revving up the Foreman Grill and finished them off there. Delicious!

These were absolutely delicious.  Minor changes I made: We're garlic fanatics so I added about 1.5 more tablespoons of minced garlic, I too baked them in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes, but before I put them in the oven, I lightly sprinkled them with garlic powder.  After 25 minutes, all I can say is yummy!!!

These turned out nice and moist, but lacked a bit of flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, but if I try to make them again, I will add more seasoning.

These are really good!  I had to make some changes based on what I had on hand.  I also missed the mustard on the recipe (cooking three things at once!).

I used ground pork instead of beef, which I think is probably preferrable with the spices.  It was a bit too flavorful, so next time I think I'll cut back on the dill and cumin (which I love!).  I used cream havarti cheese and added a bit of crushed red pepper to make up for not having pepper jack (only had slices I didn't want to use up!).

As other reviewers suggested, I served this over steamed white rice with the Sweet & Sour Sauce II recipe.  It was really great that way!

I also baked them in the toaster oven for 40 min at 350.

Next time I'll try these with BBQ sauce (something sweet) and cook them in the crock pot all day.

Oh, and I had to use crushed Ritz crackers for the crumbs.  That gave it a bit of sweetness, too.

Nice base for meatballs.  A bit too bland for my family, though.  The second time around I added a few shakes of tobasco and 1/3 cup A-1 steak sauce and that amped it up just enough for some awesome meatball subs!

I did a little tweaking to this recipe, too, and it's a neat spin on the everyday meatball! We had them in spaghetti sauce, but I think they'd be better with sweet & sour or BBQ sauce.

My first time making meatballs and they were great.  I did substitute ground turkey for ground beef, ritz crackers for bread crumbs, and cilantro for basil.  I will try them with the original ingredients when I have them on hand.  Quick, easy, and very good. A sauce would make it perfect.

These meatballs are exquisite!  They were probably the best ones I've made thus far.  I left out the dill - because I was not feeling like that type of flavor last night.. and felt that the parsley and basil would carry well on their own.  I used panko instead of bread crumbs.  Also, rather than yellow mustard, used whole grain mustard.  Baked at 400 F for 15 or so minutes (on a greased, foil-lined baking sheet), and then topped my pizza with them!  So, they finished cooking on the pizza, at 375 F for another 15 minutes.  The flavor is addicting!  They were also very tender, didn't fall apart, and I am excited to try them in a marinara sauce soon.  This is going into my recipe binder, permanently! :)  Thank you!

Good Lord the meatballs are good! I followed the recipe exactly the only thing I subbed was swiss cheese for the pepper jack because thats all I had on hand ,used only 1lb of beef and I baked them in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 min My 9 yr old said he can't take it they are so good!!! So with that said these are hands down the best meatballs ever.

these are great!!! i only used 1 lb beef, 1 egg, 4 slices of crumbled pepper jack cheese, & added 1 finely chopped jalapeno. Instead of cooking on the stove, i baked @ 400 for 25 mins. These are soooo delicious & have a ton of flavor.

I love this recipe! I've been making it for years in large batches that I can freeze and thaw out only what I need for a dinner.  The only modifications I made were to dice the onions and mix them into the meatballs, substitute ground turkey and bake them at 350 for 20 minutes instead of cooking in a skillet.  If I don't have pepper jack on hand, I mix in red pepper flakes with regular monterey jack, but be careful not to use too much.  The flavors are awesome and not overpowering at all.  Don't be afraid of the dill or cumin!

I followed the recipe and was very disappointed. There was way too much dill in the meat for me. It just didn't go well together , in my opinion.

These meatballs were delicious! I didn't have any cumin, but I added oregano, and they turned out great. I served them with whipped mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables, and my husband and daughter loved them.

Very good recipe.  I used celery seed because I didn't have the dill weed.  I've already passed this on to a friend.

I took Chelsey E's advice and made the Sweet and Sour Sauce II and baked the meatballs. I also used ground turkey instead of beef.

fantastic recipe.  don't like actual onion but i like the flavor, so i used 1 tsp onion powder mixed in with everything else, didn't have bread crumbs so i used seasoned croutons softened beforehand by soaking in the (beaten) eggs, and didn't have pepperjack cheese so i used cheddar.  all worked well, made for truly delicious meatballs, plain or in spaghetti sauce. very moist, and great flavor. will definitely make again!

this came out tasting very mediterranean/middle eastern/something i cant put my finger on.. i somehow forgot the cheese.. and purposely halved the basil, dill, bread crumbs, and eggs.. i used 1.5 tsp kosher salt but i think it may have been a bit excessive.. used ground turkey instead of beef.. didn't bother with the onion.. and we liked the end result aside from feeling it was kind of heavy on the garlic.. and we do like garlic.. maybe the cheese, extra bread crumbs and egg would have dialed it down? i'll never know.. bf had his in tortillas.. i had mine over some pasta.. ty for something different

I made a double batch and used 2 lbs Ground beef and 1 lb Hot Italian sausage. These were absolutely amazing! Also baked them instead of frying since there were so many Then put them in a crock pot with Spaghetti sauce. Will be making Subs with these as well.

Great recipe. I follow the advice of another and cooked it in BBQ sauce.  Has a nice tangy zip to it.

I tried this recipe out last night.  We ate the whole works.  That's good to know that I have 3 picky eaters in my house that liked the change.  I did change the crumbs to crushed pork rinds to keep it more low carb.  Thanks for the recipe!

I mixed every ingredient together and cooked the meatballs for 15 minutes in a coriander beer then added the sauce and cooked an addition 12 minutes covered while the spaghetti cooked.

Made these last night and I thought they were great.  My 16 year old daughter loved them enough for a second helpings. I did change the recipe by trading 1/2 of ground beef for ground pork. Whatever the recipe- the beef/pork combo tastes better. That said I do not like cumin or dill weed.  But I thought why not give it a try.  Glad I did. You'll be surprised how good the combo is! Cooked in oven. Used a beef/pork gravy with cheese to finish them off. Served with mash potatoes, homemade rolls and asparagus.

The flavor of these meatballs are great!  I didn't have a big enough skillet, so I baked them.  They came out a little dry, but I forgot about them in the over for a while, oops!  I think next time I'll make a brown gravy with complementing spices in it to bake them in.

Yummy little meatballs!  Probably only had about a half teaspoon cumin, but it worked.  Used Monterey instead of Pepperjack.  And baked, covered tightly, at 350 for one hour.  These were a hit!

I loved these meatballs. Although I think they could use a complimenting sauce(any ideas?). I love the Cumin. It gives it a great kick. Would definately make again.

I’m a garlic lover but these were too garlicky for me. Also the cheese melts out quite a bit- I guess you can just scoop it back up and put it in whatever sauce you’re using. I’m sure the extra fat added to the flavor but I think I’ll omit it next time. I baked them at 350 for 25 mins and served over egg noodles with Swedish meatball sauce.

Very good.  I accidentally left out the shredded pepper jack cheese.  Next time I will remember that.  I bought Tzatziki sauce from a local restaurant to accompany these.

Made for a party - mixed ahead of time and then rolled/baked on the day of.  I also put the diced onion in the mix.  Made meatballs approx. 1" in size, baked for 20 minutes in the oven.  Got lots of compliments but would scale back the dill next time - it was almost too strong!  But very good!

They turned out awesome..I made it just the way it said, I had everything I needed. WOW!! Kicken all right.  I loved the Cumin taste in it. I know some people don't but I think that's what made it diffrent. I got 12 good size meatballs out of it.  After  I eat a few I could have keep going.. (;  but!! I have to let my friend and his wife try some. By the way, I recommend a I cold beer.. Dos Equis XX Amber, it goes with it good watching one of your favorit sport...Kicking back.
