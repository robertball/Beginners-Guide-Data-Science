This stuffing smelled and looked great going into the oven...I love all the spices and herbs.  However, I found it was quite heavy and dry...maybe the 2 cups of chicken stock should be 2 cans of chicken stock??? I'll use 2 cans next time...it's definitely worth another try as the flavor and aroma is great!

Great stuffing. Just like my Grandmother use to make. I'm going to try adding 8 more oz. of oysters next time.

I've never made or had oyster stuffing and my husband hasn't had it in years, so this year being the first to do it ourselves, we found this recipe and it was excellent. I never eat much stuffing, not loving it or disliking it really, but I've even gone back for leftovers with this one. Thanks Erika!! I was sooo worried about doing an oyster stuffing and never having made it before. I followed the recipe exactly (so unlike me) and it was easy.

This recipe is a wonderful twist on ordinary stuffing.  I increase the amount of spices since I make a larger amount of cornbread then what is needed. Made the holidays a hit!!!

This is very close to my grandmother's recipe, except I boil the turkey/chicken neck and gizzards and use that as part of the liquid added to stuffing.  I also shred the meat off the neck and add that for extra flavor.

This was a new kind of stuffing for me.  I found that it called for the perfect amount of spices.  I enjoyed it very much!

Everyone said it was good.  I had to use canned oysters and I chopped them up, and fresh sage.  I added 2 T creole spice, it was for some cajun friends.  They ate it all up.

We loved this stuffing! The recipe filled our 21lb turkey and there was still enough for a 9in square baking dish. This will be the only stuffing I ever make!

First time making oyster dressing. First time having it, too! 'Made "Southern Cornbread Oyster Dressing" by Barrett, too.  They are both good.  With this one, the oyster flavor isn't as prominent.  'Still good though. The spices don't overpower it, but lessen the oyster-ness.  :D  I was expecting the dressing to be uniform in moistness before baking, but it wasn't.  I poured it in a 9x13 & crossed my fingers, baking at 350 for half an hour.  It was bubbling still, but it was done.  I had a 12 ounce container of oysters.  'Added the whole thing.  :)  'Think I'd go for a smaller pan next time.  Oh, no turkey giblets.  :)  A nice surprise was that this wasn't very dense as I thought it might be - using all cornbread, nothing else.

Great recipe. If you will bake it in the casserole dish just bake it for 30 minutes only not 1 hr and 20 mins . I should have followed the pepedridge farm recipe on the back .

Just not like I used to make.  Maybe because we can't get Mrs. Cubbins dressing here in Hawaii.  Had to use some different stuffing mix. Did not like the giblets in my dressing.  Should have used 2 containers of oysters.

I've tried several oyster stuffing recipes in the past. Some were too moist, some were too dry...this one was just right!!
