These are pretty simple to make and yummy.  They are not overly sweet which makes them a nice dessert for people who aren't big on sweets.  I think I would cut back on the salt a tad though.  Used [unsalted] butter cut in with a pastry cutter, not shortening, and I had chopped dates on hand so I used those instead of the pitted Medjool dates.  Maybe I will try all apricots next time.
