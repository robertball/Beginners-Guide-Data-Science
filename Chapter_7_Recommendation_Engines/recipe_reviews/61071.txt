This looks like a variation (or the other is a variation of this LOL) of the Perfect Sesame Chicken also posted here on Allrecipes. ANd it's GREAT!  if you want a really wonderful lower fat/carb version, marinate the chicken in the liquids and DUST marinated chicken with onlypart of the cornstarch. Dry fry or use 1tsp at a time of peanut oil in a non stick wok until cooked.  Dump the sugar and use 2/3c sucralose and always use apple cider vinegar. use half the amount of cornstartch to thicken or use arrowroot powder. Traditional sauces (according to my Chinese friends) are a bit thinner than the thick styles.  Just by not deep frying the meat, you can save hube amounts of fat calories and cutting the sugar and the cornstartch removes much of the carb count too.   This recipe is great as it is... but I'm just saying you can low fat-lower carb this dish so even those on special diets can enjoy :)

I'm a vegetarian so I only made the sauce from the second part of the recipe, and it was the best sesame sauce I've ever made -- better than my favorite restaurant's! I made a couple of changes: veggie broth for chicken; bumped the vinegar to 3/8 cup; brown sugar instead of white; red pepper flakes instead of chili paste; 3 cloves of garlic. Instead of boiling the sauce as the recipe suggests, I stir-fried the garlic in the sesame oil then added my fake meat and veggies, then added everything else. I stirred in cornstarch until I was happy with the consistency so I probably used less than called for in the recipe. But the sauce was nice and thick, and a wonderful combination of sweet and tangy. This is one is definitely a keeper!

DELICIOUS recipe.
The only thing I did differently was frying the chicken in a large skillet, when the chicken was browned and ready I poured out the oil. Instead of pouring the sauce on the chicken on a platter, I poured the sauce in the skillet and let it simmer for 3-5 minutes. It gave the chicken more flavor and let the sauce soak into the meat more. Finally served over jasmine rice and it was delicious.

This was spectacular. Didn't take a long time to make. Super great results. My boyfriend who only likes meat, cheese and potatoes loved it :) I would recommend dousing the chicken pieces with cornstarch before putting it in the mixture to refrigerate and fry a tad longer for extra crispiness.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe except for adding chili paste.  I agree with the reviewer who said something was missing.  That special zing you get from real chinese was lacking, but I was glad I could make this dish and know everything that was going into what my family was eating.

Flavor profile is there.  Tastes excellent.  I was looking for slightly crispier chicken but pleasantly surprised. I had my oil too hot so i flash fried the chicken and finished in the oven @375 for 15 minutes.  Perfect! Next time i may try peanut oil instead of canola for frying.

I liked this recipe and my family loved it as well.  I added shrimp to it and added some snow peas and diced red bell pepper.  I would suggest seasoning your chicken prior with salt and pepper prior to adding it to the batter.  For an extra kick, I also added some red chili flakes to the sauce.

Really good. I couldn't get the red chile paste so I substituted ground red pepper. My 3 year daughter even enjoyed it.

We really liked this, even my hubby and he's not the Chinese food fan that I am.  It was quite spicy, I might tone that down a little next time.

Very good.  Really just made the sauce.  I think I'll leave out the water next time for a more intense flavor.  I used 3/4 cup vinegar, red pepper flakes rather than chili paste, brown sugar rather than white sugar and soup base rather than chicken stock.  (Snowed in and had to use what I had on hand!)  Tossed the chicken pieces in seasoned corn starch and sauted in oil.  Turned out really good!

Ok so I have made this many ways. I have followed the exact recipe and fried the chicken but I have also added the sauce to a stir fry. Both ways are amazing. To be a bit healthier I also use pure honey to substitute the cornstarch and sugar.

This is NOT Mr. Lee's Sesame Chicken (Littleton, NH), but seeing as there is no such dish made here in Bolivia, this really hit the spot. My wife kept raving about this dish. I did not have the dry sherry, but I used the chinese wine that is often used in their sauces (sorry, don't remember the name of it). Also, I thought that there was not enough batter, so after frying the chicken I made another batch of 'batter' adding smashed garlic this time and refried the meat. Delicious! As far as the sauce is concerned, I did it according to recipe to see how it would turn out. I felt that it lacked its 'redness', so I took Mr. Lee's advice and squirted in some ketchup and that did the trick. It has been at least 3 years since I had this dish, so this really hit the spot. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Don't let the lack of ratings, fool you. This has to be one of the best Asian recipes on here, and I have tried a good handful. It's just like something you get at PF Changs. If you cut down on the chicken and replace it with some broccoli, you get a nice, balanced meal.

I only used the sauce part of this recipe, but I can tell you that it is amazing! NOTE to self: red pepper paste is NOT the same as red chile paste. Don't substitute.

My family loved this!! I did do 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar and backed off just a bit on it...I marinated the chicken in soy sauce, sesame oil, and sherry only, then sauteed in a bit of canola with white onions to reduce fat.  Then I threw in a bunch of fresh veggies at the very end, poured the sauce on top and served with lo-mein noodles with sauce, and white rice as another option.  My kids even fought over the leftovers!!

This was a great recipe and was a hit with my family and friends.  It was pretty easy to make, the only changes I have made are to marinate my chicken longer than 20 minutes so it has a bit more flavor and also when making the sauce I use only 1 TBLS of sesame oil.  It can be a bit strong.

INCREDIBLE!  Followed the recipe exactly and the family can't get enough of it!  Better than a restaurant.  Will likely slice the chicken thinner next time to work on getting the chicken a bit crispier.

I don't know if I just have some really strong sesame oil or what, but it was TOO sesame flavored. I will make it again but I'll add less sesame oil and more soy sauce.

This recipe does have a lot of ingredients, but is really easy to make.  My husband and kids went nuts over it.  The only changes I made were... 1.  used about 1.5 C sugar instead of 2C.... you could even use less  2.  toasted the sesame seeds on the stove for a minute to really bring out the flavor and 3.  I chopped spring onion (white and green parts) and put it on top with more sesame seeds just before serving.   I will make this over and over again with rice and broccoli it is the perfect dinner and tastes better than most chinese carry outs!!!

this recipes is fantastic!! I marinated the chicken overnight and the pieces came out tender and tasty.  I also substituted some red wine for the sherry since it's what I had in my kitchen.  I tried to make some egg rolls with the meal and they were disgusting so the sesame chicken really saved the meal :)

Absolutely perfect! Completely satisfied my craving for take-out sesame chicken, but it was even better. The only substitutions I made were for lack of listed ingredients: red wine instead of sherry and red pepper flakes instead of red chile paste. Otherwise, I followed the instructions to the T and it came out amazing. The family couldn't believe I made it in less than 30 minutes!

This recipe is much more complex than necessary and results in a bland, colorless, vinegary concoction.  It can easily be transfixed into a much easier, prettier, more healthful and tastier dish.  Eliminate the marinating and all the ridiculous ingredients required.  Trust me, once the chicken is immersed in the sauce you'll never taste the difference.  Eliminate the vinegar all together.  This added a pickled taste and ruined the dish.  Add two or three Tablespoons of oyster sauce to the sauce ingredients.  Stir fry onions (one inch square slices), broccoli, and carrot slices (or any vegetables you like and have on hand) set aside and add to sauce before serving.  Cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  1" is way too large. 3/8" cubes or 1/2x1/2x1/4" slices is much better.  Combine chicken, vegetables and sauce and heat before serving.  Form a "doughnut" shape with the rice and place the ingedients in the middle and sprinkle all with sesame seeds.    Now you've got a decent dish

Overall I really liked it, as did my husband and 3 y/o son.  I felt like the sauce was lacking some saltiness, so I added one additional tablespoon of soy sauce, and this really improved it.  I was also hoping for crispier chicken, but I left it in the hot oil for a little bit longer and this helped.  I also served the chicken dry and placed the sauce and sesame seeds on the table for people to serve themselves, and this helped keep the chicken crispy.  I will definitely make this again, as it is very quick and easy to make!

Awesome!  Only change to suit taste was to cut sesame oil in sauce down a bit.  I will be making this again and again.....and again.

This was good.. Would def. cut back on sesame oil.. would not cut back on the vinegar.. I did not have sherry, so I used shaoxing rice wine.. added broccoli.. probably won't make again.. missin something and have made "sesame chicken" many other ways that suit me better.. Thanks for letting me try your recipe..

Our family loves Sesame Chicken, but we could not even eat this.  My husband went to get take out instead.  I will be looking for another recipe to try again as I would love to make this myself.  I have made many asian dishes that we love but this was way too bland for us.  Others have said something is missing and they are right!

Other then the fact the sauce was more like candy then sauce...this dish was fine.  Husband really loved it.  I thought it was missing something.  Flavors were not as bold as I thought it would be.  It also borders on way too much sugar.  Oh!  Don't forget the sesame seeds!

I felt it was missing something although I didn't have sesame oil or seeds which may have been the problem. I did roll the chicken in flou before frying to make them a bit more crispy. Overall it turned out well. I will make it again.

Very tasty! It wasn't difficult either. Took me a while, and I made quite a mess though :D The sauce was awesome over white rice. I think I'd like to try making it with less sugar next time though.   Thanks!

Just wonderful! I'm new to asian cooking but advanced with other types of food, and this was very easy and I didn't have to run out to the store for ingredients. I doubled the sauce to make sure I would have plenty and had twice as much as I needed - however, I am keeping the leftover sauce for another meal, it is just delicious. I thought the sauce that you marinade the chicken in was going to be too much but it turned out to be perfect after sitting in the fridge for half an hour. This is a dish I will make again and again - yay!!! :)

Uh-nah.  Didn't go for this one.  What I did (1-15-10) 1 1/2c chix b, 2T cornstarch, 1/3c sugr, 3T sesame, 1 cl garlic, 2T sesame seeds.  Seems like a variation of perfect sesame chicken.

Absolutely wonderful! I made the sauce with just water (substituted for the chicken broth) for my vegetarian daughter and it turned out great! There is some kind of magic that happens when the sauce ingredients are combining! Thanks to my Curves buddy for recommending this recipe!

My husband & kids LOVE this recipe! It has become one I serve when guests are visiting too!  I didn't change the recipe at all and usually double it as we love the left overs!  

It isn't super spicy, but has a nice kick to off set the sweetness of the sauce.  Sometimes I serve the chicken separate from the sauce and let each person put as much sauce on their chicken as they want.  My kids discovered that this sauce makes the stir fried veggies I serve taste better too!

Very, very yummy! My family absolutely loved it! I made a few changes: 1. I substituted  sherry for dry white wine in the chicken marinade. 2. I coated the pieces with cornstarch before dumping them in the marinade, and so I ended up with a crispier chicken 3. I coated half of the marinated chicken pieces with sesame seeds before frying and therefore did not add any sesame seeds to the sauce. 4. I substituted distilled vinegar for 1/8 cup white rice vinegar and 1/8 cup dark rice vinegar in the sauce. 5. I did not have the red chili paste, so I used 1/4 tsp. red chili flakes. 6. I only used 2/3 cup of (brown!) sugar in the sauce and it was perfect! There was plenty of sauce to keep as a dip for spring rolls (made from scratch) and dumped the rest over the chicken. I did not have the same trouble as other reviewers with chicken pieces getting soggy. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for posting!

This was tasty, but SO MUCH SUGAR. I actually halved the sugar because the amount of sugar this recipe calls for is tremendous. It was still yummy, but not quite like a chinese restaurant.

I finally am taking a second to rate this recipe. My favorite sesame chicken recipe by far! I have made it with the chicken fried, with it pan seared. I have made it with a dash of ketchup, and also without. Honestly, no matter how you make it, this recipe is amazing. A definite must try!

This was absolutely delicious! My whole family loved it and said at least 1 time a week they want it. I doubled the sauce and served it on the side rather than pour it on the meat so leftovers would not get soggy. There were leftovers since I made it for 10! I have sauce left so now I need to make egg rolls because I can't let that go to waste! Would give 10 stars if I could!

Very, very good! Of course NOT the healthiest dish, but I will make it every now and again because it's SO good and my husband was OOing over it. I used rice wine vinegar (didn't have any white distilled) and used more garlic to get that spicey/sweet thing. Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing!

This was very good, very easy, but it was too sweet. I would cut back on the sugar a bit

This is absolutely delicious.  My whole family loves it.  I couldn't find the red chili paste, so I use 2-3 tbs of red chili sauce.

I omitted the chili paste since my daughter is allergic, but it was still very good. I also used a wok to cook the marinated chicken; however, cooked the sauce in a saucepan as recommended before adding it to the wok. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thank you!

I personally thought this recipe was wonderful! I used 2 TBS. Vinegar (which was the least amout recommended) because I wanted a sweeter sauce. Well... It was a little too sweet for me. Next time I'll use a little more vinegar. But other than my own adjustment, it was great!!

Absolutely amazing. Even my extremely picky husband loved it. Closest approximation to wonderfully-bad-for-you Chinese take-out Sesame Chicken I have ever found. Great recipe!

This was very good.  Very easy to make for an Asian dish. I steamed some broccoli and green onions and added them at the end.  I only had hot sesame oil so I used that in place of both the sesame oil and chili paste.   Worked out fine as far as we could tell.  We thought the sauce was great.  Next time we might add various bell peppers and other vegetables.  It was lick – your - plate good.

I made this thinking it would be a great new recipe for my husband and I. Luckily I tasted the sauce before I put it all over the chicken. The sesame oil ruins the sauce.  Sorry but my family does not beg for this dish.

delicious!  the whole family loved it including my 2 yo, which says a lot.  I am not longer intimidated by "chinese" food.  One thing to note, make sure that you premix the water and corn starch.  I didn't think of it and my sauce was a bit lumpy.  Thanks for the recipe this one is going in the book!

Best sesame chicken ever!  Follow the recipe exactly.  You need that little bit of pepper paste!  Made this bunches of times and had to give recipe out to everyone who has dined with us!  We even had it at our Christmas Chinese dinner!  Delish!!

Tastes almost like Cheese Cake Factories Sesame Chicken.  The only thing I would do differant next time is add more Thai Red Chili paste and maybe a dash of cayenne for some spice.  What a great meal!

This was great but the cornstarch left me with bits throughout the sauce. I whisked it as I added it but it didn't completely dissolve. Idk why as I never had that problem. I wound up throwing out the first batch of sauce and making a second with less 'starch' - you really don't need as much as the recipe calls for. All in all tho, this is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is fantastic and a definite keeper!! We absolutely love Chinese food and this is the only recipe that may family will accept. I usually double or even triple the recipe (the sauce recipe too) so that we have leftovers. Thanks for sharing!

Easy and Excellent, though my son actually thought it was "too sweet" so I guess next time I'll try with less sugar. Perfect with a side of steamed broccoli and cheese sauce.

This recipe got rave reviews from my picky eater!  She even ate the broccoli I added saying that it tasted perfect with the sauce.  So I left out the sherry cuz I forgot to get some, used chili oil instead of paste (I want to try that next time).  Then I didn't deep fry the chicken, instead I put it in a frying pan and cooked for a bit with and without a lid.  Finally I added a bit of water to the pan with broccoli and snap peas and covered to steam briefly then served with rice.  I will certainly double the chicken this recipe next time!  Thanks for a good meal!

This is an great recipe. The only change I made was t not deep frying the chicken. Instead I lightly coated  a skillet with canola oil and fried the chicken this way. The marinade gave each piece a nice crisp golden brown coating. It also helped me not feel so guilty using the 2 cups of sugar in the sauce.

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and the only thing I did different was to add just 1 cup of sugar instead of the two required for doubling. I also didn't have sherry, so I left that out. No one noticed a difference. I also cooked the chicken in just 2 teaspoons of canola oil.

I gotta say...I was a little skeptical after trying a few other chinese dishes on here which turned out awful, but this one was a winner!   Threw in red pepper flakes and also put in a dab of cayanne pepper and chili peppers (spcices) as I like things hot.   Was a perfect mix and not a bit left!

Much better than a restaurant!  I used red pepper flakes instead of chili paste and white wine instead of sherry but I doubt it had any real impact on the quality of this recipe.  Even my picky kids gobbled it down!

This was good-but not great. I am not big on deep fried chicken, so next time I would sautee it in my wok instead. My husband thought it was just pretty good and our adult daughter loved it! so maybe it was the battered and fried part that we just dont care for!

So delicious and not too hard!  I just cooked the chicken in shallow oil in a stir fry sort of pan because I don't have a fryer, but it worked just fine.  My family absolutely loved it.  Served with jasmine rice, steamed broccoli, egg drop soup and hong kong milk tea (recipe on allrecipes).  Can't wait to make this again for company!

This dish was amazing!! Me and my family LOVED it!!
I did make one major change though, I didn't fry the chicken, I just baked it and it still turned out GREAT!! 
I cut the chicken into small bite size nuggets then soaked them in the marinade as directed, but instead of frying them, I bake them at  400 degrees F for about 35 minutes!  Turned out great and will definitely make it again!!

Honest to goodness, the only changes I made were rice vinegar instead of white and Thai chili sauce instead of paste. We LOVED it! And I make a lot of scratch Asian foods so we're pretty picky. I also try to give stars based on the recipe as written and not with a plethora of changes. My only two changes were because of what I had on hand, not in an attempt to intentionally change flavors.

It was so delicious! I will definitely make it again! I didn't have red chile paste so I used green chile paste, and it still tasted really good it just wasn't spicy which is fine. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Excellent! For those of you who rewrite the recipe,  enter your own recipe. I don't even look at reviews that are pages long.  A couple suggestions are a good idea but there are way too many "perfectionist " who want to change the whole recipe. Just my opinion??

This has been a recipe that I have been making the family for a couple years now. It never lasts into left overs. As of late we started creating a trend where we juice an entire orange then use the zest as well as ad two pinches of puree ginger. It's absolutely delicious.

This was really good and sooo easy!  My family ate it all up really quick.  I did reduce the amount of sugar by half in the sauce and it turned out great.

Made this tonight. Only things I changed was using 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in the sauce part, because I feared it would turn out a bit strong. I skipped on the chilie paste (I couldnt find seasame seeds in the store so I went without those also). Other than that I followed the Cook Notes and only used 2 tablespoons of vinegar since I like a sweeter sauce. It turned out really well. I can see why some people might think it bland, it does not have strong flavours, BUT, I really loved it, I loved the subtle flavours. The sauce does end up kinda thick, but it worked. It tasted really good on the chicken and rice (It was great for someone who does not like rice without some kinda sauce or flavouring.) I can say I've only had one chinese food place serve me better sesame chicken than this, but even then there were things about this recipe that were still better!

I have never written a review, but this was soooooo great that I had to!!! The chicken breading is perfect!!! It fried up beautifully! That perfect crisp that only takeout can do! The breading recipe will be used over and over!! The sauce is versatile, awesome as is, or can be modified into general tso's or sweet and sour etc. Never mastered take out until I found this recipe! You may want to half the cornstarch in the sauce, it is quite thick, but dont touch the chicken ;) Thank you Missfavor, you changed chinese nights!!

Absolutely delicious! Easy to make if you have the ingredients on hand. I used Sriracha instead of chili paste and it worked out great. I didn't have sesame seeds to toast but I will definitely stock some for the next time I make this.

Fabulous! I would have followed the recipe exactly but realized I did not have everything when I got home.
I will definately make this again! Hubby and I devoured it. I've been trying asian dishes for a while now and have not been happy until I found this! It's worth making.
This is what I did differently -Grapeseed Oil instead of Seseame Oil (I was out). Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup (1 cup is a lot!), used a Dry White Wine instead of Sherry (I don't have sherry). I also topped with chopped green onion as well as the toasted seseame seeds.  I cooked in the oil for more like 8-9 minutes (they were not cooked thoroughly).

Sesame Chicken or sesame anything is my favorite Chinese dish, but I hardly ever get to eat it because the majority of places that serve this dish use MSG which my hubby is extremely sensitive to.  Gives him a migraine any time he eats MSG.  It is nice to find a recipe that is msg free and tastes excellent!  I too coated the chicken in corn starch before I added it to the batter.  I also added a little minced ginger to the sauce since I love a little ginger in my sesame sauce.  I wanted something green and didn't have any traditional veges to go with this dish.  All I had was some French asparagus.  I cut them into 2 inch pieces, coated them in olive oil, sprinkled with garlic salt and powdered ginger, then coated in corn starch.  I then fried them until they floated to the top of the oil.  My hubby was raving about how good it was.

A bit complex for me.  I thought it turned out fairly well.  Little surprised at how much sugar goes into the sauce.  I like it better then when I eat it at a buffet.

Delicious!! I substituted a few things. I couldn't find red chili paste, so I used 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder instead. I also substituted the white vinegar for rice vinegar, and instead of a clove of garlic I used 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. 
My husband loved the recipe!! He said it is one of his favorite recipes that I make, and definitely wants it again!! I served it with plain white rice seasoned with soy sauce. Very good!!

Made this for my kids, had to make 10 servings and they ate it all. They said it was better than our favorite Chinese restaurant. I did make one small change; I had to substitute the chili paste with dried red pepper flakes (rehydrated in warm water). Taste great, kids want to make it again.

Pretty great recipe. However, I agree with another poster who mentioned that if you add the sauce to the chicken right away it becomes soggy. I put sauce on the side and dipped before eating. Still---it was pretty darn tasty!

I used rice flour instead of regular flour and wheat-free tamari to make the recipe gluten-free.  I cut the sugar in half, and will use even less next time.  I also added steamed broccoli to the dish.  My family really enjoyed the dish but would like the sauce on the side next time.

Loved this!!  Better then the restaurant.  Never had Jasmine rice but decided to try it with the sesame chicken-- very light and delicious!! I also toasted  the seasame seeds.  The chicken wasn't as crispy as I would like but I am sure that is just personal preference.  I think I will cook chicken in peanut oil next time to give it a little more crispiness. I will definitely make this again!!

Marinade and sauce were easy and delish. I halved the sugar and doubled the chili paste for extra kick. After marinating I lightly coated the chicken with a flour/cornstarch mixture, then "fried" in a regular skillet using much less oil than the recipe calls for. This had to be done in several batches, which was time consuming. Each batch cooked for about 8 minutes, and yes, chicken was cut into small pieces. Overall very good and probably much more healthy than getting takeout, but overall I wouldn't call it "easy."

Very good recipe. This was my first attempt at sesame chicken.  I was very impressed.  The sauce wasn't exactly like the Chinese restaurants make, but it was good anyway.  I am sure I will be making this again very soon.  I only made 4 servings and it was eaten quickly.  Next time I will make more!! Great recipe!!!

I LOVED this...and it warms up great in he oven too!  I did not have any chile paste, so I used Red Pepper flakes, as suggested by another user.  I also didnt have any garlic on hand, so I ommitted it, and it was still wonderful.  The ingredien list is a bit overwhelming looking, but it was super easy to make once I had all the ingredients together.  Will def make again and again. Thanks for the great recipe for my collection!!!

Restaurant quality!  I am so pleased (thank you)!  Very easy to put together and cooks up in a snap.  Fantastic flavors.  Definitely serve over/next to rice (I made the mistake of adding stir fry veggies and crispy noodles - - - way too many textures). This, some steamed broccoli, and perhaps a nice soup would be simply perfect.  Will make again (and again, and again).

This recipe was absolutely fantastic.  I didn't change a thing, followed it exactly.  I liked the fact that you could prepare everything (mix the sauce, etc.) and cook it later.  This was NOT a difficult recipe and I will definitely make this again.  Kid friendly too.  My 7 year old loved it.

My family loved it!!! I 2-3x the recipe (made for about 6-10 servings. I added 1/2 white onion, 1 green pepper,  2 celery stems all chopped plus 2 steamed bags of stir fry mix to already cooked chicken and sautéed together with the prepped sauce to mix fully. Served with white steamed rice.

I read a few reviews that said this dish didn't have a more Chinese takeout flavor,  so I made the following revisions, and it turned out so good! Definitely a keeper!  I added 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and just a little squirt of sriracha.  I added about 1/4 teaspoon of ginger powder, but 1 teaspoon of fresh ginger is always a better option.  Also instead of using regular white vinegar, I used rice vinegar, which is traditionally used in Chinese dishes and really brings out flavor!  Also,  I used brown sugar instead of white.  For the sauce I added a slurry at the end to thicken rather then add that much corn starch - after it reduces a bit you don't need so much.  I probably used 2 TB in my slurry, and it was perfect!

The chicken was excellent BEFORE you poured that additional coating on! The coating will congel quickly. We paired with yellow rice mixed with brocolli. very tasty.

Awesome! Wouldn’t change a thing except maybe use less sugar. It was pretty sweet. I might also try with Thai red curry paste instead of red chilie paste. But recipe as written, I tried it out on my husband and he loved it! Great instructions by the way! Deep frying is a stretch for me and I usually don’t enjoy it but I can’t wait to make this again for the entire family!

I followed this recipe to the letter.  My husband is Asian and his mother taught Asian Cooking before she died, so he is picky about his Asian dishes.  He gave this a 5 out of 5.....and he NEVER does that.  The chicken was so tender and the sauce so flavorful.  Thank you for sharing!  I'll be making this again and again!

This was so yummy! I followed the recipe except for a couple of suggestions from other reviewers - cut the sugar and the sauce corn starch in half. My whole family gobbled it up. I also had more than enough sauce left to freeze for the next time so that part is already done.

Made as written, except replaced the red chili paste (which I didn't have) with a shot of sriracha. Wife loved it, but it was a little bit too sweet and greasy for me. Will cut back on the sugar next time; probably use a nonstick wok and a lot less oil, too.

The sauce was delicious, except I wanted to cut down on the fat from deep frying, so I prepared the chicken in my airfryer (using parchment paper in it so the chicken didn't stick). For "crispier" chicken, I used extra baking powder, which will draw out the moisture.   I also marinated the chicken overnight.

I used chicken thighs instead of breast and Splenda instead of sugar. It tastes AWESOME. Sauce is even better than some Chinese restaurant dishes. The chili garlic sauce makes this sing! Don’t leave it out!

Truly addictive! However, I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong with the frying aspect? The coated chicken sticks to the bottom of my skillet and I end up with a major mess. I have to double or triple soak the skillet in dawn with some heavy duty scraping in between, which is the reason I took away one star. The chicken is delicious and worth the cleanup effort. I use three heaping tablespoons of chili paste and throw in a couple of diced jalapeños because we like it spicy.

Although the prep took a bit longer than expected, the results were exceptional.  Very flavorful & holds up well when reheated.  I stuck to the recipe as written & was quite pleased with the results.  I am attributing the prep issues to “first time” jitters & intend to use my experience with the recipe to make this a new addition to my menu rotation.

I forgot to buy sesame oil and used canola oil to substitute and used Sambal Oelek ground fresh chili paste- didn't have the kind with Thai kitchen at the store and I added more than called for to get the spice I wanted. This was delish!

This recipe is absolutely amazing!  I made it tonight for the first time, exactly as instructed, other than the following changes. 


 Instead of 1 quart of canola oil to fry the chicken, I used 1/2 cup ( 4 oz) of canola oil in a frying pan, so there was very little waste.  The chicken came out perfect.  It was plenty to fry the 2 large chicken breasts I used in the recipe.  

I also did not  have chili paste, so I used 2 teaspoons chili powder and one teaspoon red chili flakes.  OMG, I can't believe how good this recipe is!!  I will never order sesame chicken at a Chinese restaurant again, when I can make a  better version of it at home using this recipe!!!

In addition, I am sold on the jasmine rice.  It has a nutty aroma and flavor and absolutely adds to the uniqueness of this recipe.  I would also add that this is one of those dishes that tastes best as soon as you make it.  Leftovers are good, but not as good as the day you make it, because the chicken is hot and crispy right out of the fry pan.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

Delicious. I don’t deep fry so I sautéd instead, I’m sure it’s not as crispy but much easier to clean up. We loved it.

I only made the sauce and added leftover cooked cubed turkey. I cut the sugar to 2/3 cup and it was delicious! Easy and tasty.

Delicious! Sautéed a bunch of veggies and placed in a dish first, then the chicken as per the recipe. There was plenty of sauce. A bit spicy for my daughter so will use less chili paste next time.

Amazing! Taste is a bit spicy but I will reduce that next time. Tastes exactly like a Chinese cuisine, although took a while cause I made more than recommended. Will recommend this to anyone!

Sauce was delicious. I feel like the chicken was lacking flavor. Grated ginger was the missing key in the marinade  to give it a flavor boost.

Absolutely delicious, was hit amongst everyone in my family and the guests that were over. I had to triple the recipe and it still came out great. I have extra sauce I but away to make a quick meal later on. If you have been thinking of making it I would suggest you give it a whirl.

Love this recipe so much. It seems expensive if u don't have the sesame oil, seeds, etc..but, those items keep so well, u can make it numerous times and feel better about the investment for delicious home cooked cuisine!

The cornstarch sauce did not stick to the chicken very well.  When I tried to just pan fry it, what a mess!  And then a deep fried the other half and it was crispier but still not great.  The sauce that went on the end was pretty good.

This is pretty good as is but if you feel its lacking, I add Accent. Its msg just like at the restaurant.  And i didn't have chili paste or sherry. I used a 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and red cooking wine. This was delicious with some white rice.

With the exception of the following substitutions (because I didn't have them) dry sherry with white wine and red chili paste with hot sauce (both recommended substitutions via a "google" search) I followed this recipe exactly. It may seem like a lot of work based on the ingredient list but it's really just 3 simple steps - marinate, make sauce and fry cubed chicken. This is definitely a keeper. If I could make Chinese food as good as this dish was, I'd never have the need to get take-out or eat in a Chinese restaurant - this recipe is that good! Thank you.

I was good. I don't have much to say negative about this recipe. My super picky kid ate this. I was really surprised. He ate rice after I put the sauce from the meat onto the rice. We will make this again.

meh.  I should have know better than to try this. A) fried in oil, what greasy mess. Flavor okay, but relied too much on sugar.  I added a full tablespoon of olek sambal, and it was still very bland. The wet marinade mainly stayed in the bowl and fell off the chicken, so that was a flop. I probably won't try this one again. too much work for too little reward.

Great recipe. The only change that I would make is instead of using sherry use mirin instead. It gave the everything that Asian zing.

I made it for Chinese New Year party for 35 people the first time making it. senior citizens enjoyed it very much and said it was better than in some restaurants. Several want the recipe. I made no changes to the recipe other than multiplying the recipe by 5. The chili paste did not make it spicy but added a nice flavor combination. I cannot handle spicy in the mild form so this was not hot on my mouth.

Made it tonight with white rice and an asparagus and cashew recipe from this site and it was very good! I made only one change and that was to cut the sugar in the sauce In half, just because a cup of sugar made me nervous. I fried the chicken using my cast iron frypan and about an inch and a half of vegetable oil.   A shallow deep fry, lol.   Will definitely make this again.  I may cut down on the cornstarch to make the sauce a bit more fluid next time but it was a hit with the family tonight!

I really liked this and so did my family. I didn’t put the full 2 tbsp of sesame seed oil in the sauce, I thought it was too much. I also used only 1/2 of the hot sauce. I wish I didn’t make so much sauce, because there was way too much left over

Seemed to have a lot of ingredients but glad I tried it. Isn't as intimidating as it looks and was very good. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made it with no dry sherry and only 1/2 tsp chili paste. Everyone's took a taste and said "WOW!"  Used brown rice and stir fried vegetables.  Excellent.  It's a keeper.

Good but not great.  I think the oil needed to be hotter in order to "crisp" the outside more.

Pretty yummy!!!! The whole family enjoyed it. I served it with jasmine rice and asparagus. It wasn't messy to clean up and I didn't deviate much, just added a little ginger to the chicken before frying. I will definitely make this again.

I doubled the chili paste, should have tripled it for a little more kick. The chicken breasts I used were rather large and had to make 1.5 X the marinade/batter. My family loved it and I know will be asking for this again!!!

This Sesame Chicken is amazing. Tastes just like what you get at the restaurant. I did make a few changes though. I added a generous amount of vinegar, salt and peppered the chicken, left out about a 4th of sugar (seemed on the sweeter side for me)  and added a dash of Oyster Sauce. The Oyster sauce really helps bring out the flavors. It is just sweet enough in my opinion, and I don't like overly sweet sauces. My family loved it. I will make again!

The sauce is really good! I do think that it could probably use some pepper flake for heat and maybe less cornstarch to be a bit thinner.  The chicken is crispy and nice but is rather bland considering I let it marinade for two hours. Not sure its worth the ingredients when just salt pepper and cornstarch would probably do the same. The sauce is what really makes this good though so four stars on that!

Amazing! Used sriracha as the chili paste and it turned out great with a mild amount of heat. Will try increasing the amount of sriracha to come up with the perfect increment for a medium-heat dish as well.

I will definitely make this again! Thanks for sharing! I didn't have chili paste, so i mixed up the sauce a little ahead and soaked a dried cayenne pepper in it and left it in during the cooking process. Next time I'll try 2. I was worried the sauce may be too sweet, but it wasn't.  We added snow peas and green onions after adding the sauce, yummy! Serving over white rice didn't do this recipe justice. Next time we'll make veggie fried rice with it.

Definitely plate licking stuff! My family's new favourite dinner. There does seem like a lot of ingredients but it comes together really easily. I didn't have the oil that the recipe asked for but just used ground nut oil and it tastes great. Will definitely be making this on a regular basis now.

Great flavor. My only problem is the chicken wasn't crispy at all. Some reviewers suggested more cornstarch before frying. I'll try next time. The flavor profile is delicious. I omitted the paste. Still great!

It is a delicious dish. Sweet, sticky and some bites were crispy. After every bite, I wanted another... That was until the the sweetness became too much to enjoy. I do plan on making this again, but will cut down on the amount of sugar used.

Very good. Very similar to Panda Express' orange chicken, may try adding orange or lemon next time. Makes way too much sauce though. Cut sauce in half or Leftover would be great with eggrolls or wontons.

Love this.  Hubby made because all the ingredients freaked me out.  He said it wasn't bad because it was for marinade & sauce which you make at different times. He fried the chicken, but next time we're going to deep fry. He did use half the sugar int he sauce which has a bite to it. We did add sugar snap peas & will add mushrooms also next time. Make sure you don't overcook the sauce where it becomes to thick for putting over rice.

My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe. We made 3x the recipe for sauce because, well, we're black and we like it sauce-say lol. Seriously, the additional sauce helped with the re-heating since we don't own a microwave. And it tastes great over Indian basmati rice.

A family favorite now! A keeper! Will be a part of our lives until we go on a diet and can't have fried foods :( Other than that, next time I will use a little less sugar in the sauce, but everyone was like "WOW"!!

Okay this was really good.  I forgot to put on the sesame at the end but didn't make any difference.  The sauce was excellent.  I thought it made a good amount.  After deep frying the chicken in batches, I put in a frying pan like somebody else suggested and then put some of the sauce on and cooked 3-4 minutes.  Put it over rice with crunchy rice noodles.  For the first time I made something oriental  that tasted better than take out.

My 1 year old and 3 year old were asking for seconds. The only thing I did not have was the child paste and I just used chili powder and it was not hot for the kids or I. Will be a staple in the house!

Family loved it! I made the recipe exactly as provided with only one change....I only used 1/3 cup sugar and found that adequate. Any more sugar and it would have been too sweet for us. 
Next time I would double the chili paste! I used the Thai garden red chili paste. 
Served with white sticky rice and fresh bok choy (sautéed quickly in a bit of oil and minced garlic with a pinch of salt).
A bit labor intensive for a week night meal but the family loved it so will make again.....and again...

The taste of this recipe was very good and it earned a lot of appreciative comments from my family members.  I didn't give it a perfect rating for only two reasons: 1) it is extremely time-consuming to make, between all the ingredient assembly and the frying (I'm not sure how that could be streamlined) and 2) it didn't have a whole lot of spicy taste- the sweet was a little overwhelming (that, however, is easy to fix to one's personal taste).  I almost preferred just serving the chicken fried in the batter without any sauce since the crust is very good and light!

This was fantastic, both my husband & I loved it.  Made exactly as written & served over brown rice.  There's a lot of ingredients, but so worth it.  I had to giggle at some of the reviews that skipped the chili paste, but felt that the final product was lacking some zing.  Seriously - don't skip the chili paste, it's needed to cut the sweetness from the sugar.  In fact, I'm considering adding a little extra chili paste next time.  I'm definitely adding this recipe to the rotation - it's awesome!

This was very good. I made it as is with 2 exceptions. I cut the amount of sesame oil in half and i cut up an onion and a green pepper to add at the end.
  I will definitely make this again.

Love this paired with tropical-fruit melomels (fruit meads) such as starfruit or mango.  Especially good is the light-textured, lightly sparkling, food-friendly mango mead from Redstone Meadery in Colorado.

OMG! This chicken is soooooo good!!! The sweetness and kick of the red pepper flakes are out of this world! The only thing I did differently, was add about 1/2 tsp of ginger. My family loved it and I will definitely make it again! Yummers!!

I added about a half teaspoon of accent to the sauce I used chicken thighs, and I dusted the chicken with flour before it went in to the fryer.  Very good flavor.

Very good, pretty easy. Kids loved it. Too much sauce, would reduce it by about 1/3 next time. Cut back sugar by about 1/2, add spice and garlic, rice wine vinegar. Made with rice and an Asian cabbage salad.

We enjoyed it! We don't have a deep fryer, so just pan fried them, and they turned out great!

Chinese chefs would not use breast meat. Thigh meat is readily available boneless and skinless. Thigh meat has much more flavor and is particularly delicious in this dish or General Tso's chicken, another great American invention.

Great but a bit too much starch. Thanks for the recipe! Will make it again but with less starch in the sauce!

Very tasty. My husband went back for seconds. Couldn't find red chile paste locally, so I went with sweet red chile sauce instead. Tasted like a restaurant dish!

The chicken turned out great but the sauce was not what we expected.  Something with the sesame oil, it was SO strong!  I might make this again with a different sauce recipe.

Very delicious and it is easier than it looks from the ingredients. For my taste, there is way too much sugar. I cut it in half, and it was still too sweet for me. I will use 1/4 next time. I think it would benefit from a little ginger, but haven't tried that yet. I will make it again!

I made the recipe just as written.  My husband loved it.  We both thought it could have done with 3/4 to 1/2 cup of sugar instead of the full cup called for.   It really did taste very close to the buffet place we go to.  
The recipe seems involved but the hardest  part was gathering up the ingredients..

The sauce is very good, but I cut down on the sugar.  Otherwise I think it's overpowering.  Really good chicken recipe.  I served this over fried rice with stir fried peppers, onions, and broccoli.  This is making its way into my regular dinner rotation.

We loved this!  Made it a little healthier (and easier, far fewer ingredients) by using baked chicken breasts instead of frying.   Also sautéed one green pepper, one yellow and one red pepper.  I chopped the chicken and tossed the chicken and peppers together with the sauce.  It was perfect, plenty of zing but not too much for my 7 year old.   I also used less sugar, 3/4 cup this time but I'll use even less next time.  Excellent!  The family voted to keep this recipe.

Excellent Sesame Chicken.  Made as written with the exception of adding an additional 1/2tsp Siracha and doubled the Chili Paste.  Very good recipe.

I am pregnant and was craving Chinese food. This is amazing!!!!!!! I used crushed red pepper flakes as a substitute for the red chili paste because I didn't have it. I will totally make this again but I'm getting some chopsticks lol.

I am so glad I got a request to rate this recipe, I forgot to save it and thought it was forever lost!  I made and both my husband and I loved it!  It is a little more calories than I had hoped but worth it.

I made as the recipe as is except I didn't have the sherry so I used rice vinegar.  Next time I will reduce the sugar.  I don't think it would take away from the dish as a whole and a cup seemed like a lot.
The chicken batter was great! Even without the sauce!! I ate a couple of pieces before adding sauce and it was very flavorful.

This is truly addicting! It is much easier than it first appears by looking at the long ingredient list. I liked the very thin coating that the cooking sauce created. 
 I added thinly sliced carrots and broccoli to make it a complete meal. When the chicken was done cooking, I pan fried the vegetables then tossed them in with the cooked chicken. It was lovely and delicious!

Wow.  This was so good.  I was not expecting it.   Better than practically any restaurant.  I did find it to be a lot of work.  I think I may have even said I will not make it again.  Not true - I rarely make things twice, but this is a keeper.  I will just make a larger batch so I can get more mileage from my effort.  I did not deep fry.  Sautéed it in garlic olive oil.  YUM!

This was a little involved but turned out excellent.  The batter didn't seem like much but was perfect in the deep fat fryer.  Will definitely make again.

I followed other reviewers' advice and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, half brown and half white sugar.  Made it in an electric wok. Discarded all but a tablespoon of oil and cooked up some broccoli florets. Served over white rice. Delicious!

Substituted 1/2 cup Splenda for the sugar, was still a little too sweet. Added broccoli and snow peas.

This is a hard recipe for me to rate.  Although the flavors in this dish were, indeed, very good, this was a very time consuming dish to make.  I'm glad I made it once, but I won't be making it again :-(

This is really good! My family loves it. I've made it with tofu and chicken. The sauce is amazing! I served it over rice. I also added some slices of celery and bell pepper to  the tofu version. Yum!

I followed the recipe but omitted the sherry as I didn't have any in the house.  When I make it again I would add red pepper flakes for more heat.  This recipe is a keeper.

Everyone loved it. Only change I made was using water instead of chicken stock (didn't realize I was out of it). And next time, I'll add red pepper flakes to add some spice.

This was a delicious recipe, and actually quite easy to make.  I will definitely make it again, but with a few more changes.  I sauteed the chicken in a small amount of oil, rather than frying it.  I still got a nice crunchy crust to it.  I then removed the chicken, and added 4 cloves  minced garlic,  cubed onion and green pepper, sauteing until  tender crisp.  For the sauce, I reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup (half brown and half white), and increased the vinegar to 1/3 cup.  I added the chicken back in with the vegetables, the poured the thickened sauce over it.  We served it over brown rice, and sprinkled with the toasted sesame seeds.  For our taste, this was still too sweet.  Next time I will reduce the sugar, starting with 1/3, and will probably increase the vinegar, or try using cider vinegar instead.

I followed the recipe pretty  closely.  Not overly impressed, and made quite a mess with the frying. It was okay, but I will not make it again, not worth the amount of work.

Very yummy,  I followed the recipe. Except I didn't have sherry so I used a little rice vinegar. I found the battered chicken really stuck to my pan. So probably better to use a deep fryer like they suggest.  I found that it made a lot of sauce. So I had left overs. I would probably half the sauce next time I make it.   I also sauted some red and yellow peppers to give it some colour. I would make it again.

I've been making this for years - I originally found the recipe on About.com. I make it and everyone who eats it says that it ruins takeout sesame chicken for them for life!
The recipe works for sesame shrimp too - IT'S AWESOME!

I made this the other evening and I have to say it was scrummy, it was a little on the sweet side, so next time I make it I will cut down on the sugar a little and add just a little more chilli.  So I will definitely be making this again.

Made the sauce only to put on some some cut up chicken fingers (frozen) for my kids who were really wanting Chinese food.   Didn't have quite enough soy sauce or sesame oil, had to use apple cider vinegar, and subbed brown sugar for white. Also, didn't toast the sesame seeds HOWEVER it was awesome. Kids loved it so much. FYI it thickens really fast so be sure to keep a watchful eye. Great recipe - thanks!

I did not have chile paste so I used hot pepper flakes mixed with olive oil and minced garlic, and pulverized to a paste. I used two tablespoons and loved the extra spice it gave. was not too hot.

Excellent!  I used a 14 oz. can of chicken broth and skipped the water in the sauce.  I didn't have sherry on hand so just omitted it . Next time I will cut back on the sesame oil a little.  We loved it.

I followed the recipe precisely, and wish I hadn't.  The sauce was too gelatinous and the chicken was too sweet overall.  I would cut down on the cornstarch and flour, and definitely, the sugar.  Chicken itself was good; the mixture it marinated and fried in was good.

I don't usually rate recipes as I tend to make so many changes that it wouldn't be fair!! This recipe, however, was spectacular! Tried to stay to the recipe as much as possible. Only small changes were omitted the sherry (only because I didn't have any)and instead of all the white sugar(I just couldn't use that much!)I used half and half with brown sugar and a big spoonful of honey! A keeper for sure! I would recommend keeping the chicken and the sauce separate as the recipe states and that pouring it over the top! Keeps the chicken crispy and delicious!! Thanks for a great recipe! PS, as saw in a couple reviews, if you don't have sesame oil or seeds, don't make the recipe!!!! Wait until you do as it is kinda the staple of the recipe!

I gotta say, my husband's favorite substance on this planet is Panda Express Orange Chicken. This isn't the same, but he said it's on par. HUGE compliment! We didn't have sherry and left it out, also we had apple cider vinegar and not white, also also we didn't have any chicken broth (ran out of bullion). Other than that we made it the same. We will be making this again!

This is what Sesame Chicken should be. If your wanting to change the servings to 2 ppl, do so. But leave the sauce measurements the same.. WINNER!

This is the first time I have ever attempted sesame chicken....my family is honestly licking the platter clean as I write this.  Everyone agreed it was the best sesame chicken we have ever had... Including from a restaurant!   Although the ingredient list is lengthy and a bit daunting,  it really is simple to make.   Once you have the basic ingredients it will open you up to that whole world of sauces and stir fries.    The one thing I subbed was peach wine for the dry sherry because it was the only thing I had.....it was fantastic!    Thank you for sharing.

I don't measure anything but get kinda close and this was great. I add a large (1X1") cut red bell pepper for color. A regular in my kitchen. Serve over rice with homemade egg rolls (or store for time saving)

My sauce was too liquidy, good flavor, but the chicken made a mess of my fryer.

Made it exactly as instructed and the recipe left a lot to be desired.  Way too sweet and bland.

This was by far the best batter recipe I have tried for sesame chicken.  The only snag I found was with the sauce- made way too much and was way too watery.  Tasted great, though.

This was so amazing!!!!! The only thing I changes was, I added a little bit more sugar, red pepper paste, and soy sauce, it had to much of a nutty taste and needed a little more kick or zing! It was SO AMAZING!!

Amazing recipe! I don't ever fry chicken in oil, so I omitted the corn starch from the marinade, and baked the chicken. Followed the sauce recipe exactly, but used about 3/4c sugar rather than 1c, because it was all I had. Will definitely be making this again!

It tasted pretty good, but the sauce needs some work. I used about 1/2 cup sugar and thought it still a little too sweet. Also did not use the entire amount of cornstarch and am glad I didn't.

Such a fun recipe to make! It's a bit time consuming, but well worth the effort. Seasoning the chicken BEFORE it hits the batter really does make a difference.

My family loved this...I realized when I started cooking that I was out of Soya sauce ( I know duh!) and used Teriyaki instead. Turned out great! Next time I'll get my ingredients in order and hope that it will be even better !

This recipe was good, but I think, the next time I make it, I plan on adding a few changes. The first being, don't make the sauce prior to cooking the chicken if you are making a large batch, because it tends to thicken too much being held on the warming burner. With a family of 8 who eat like a family of 16, we tripled the recipe and came out with no leftovers, but the length of time between cooked chicken and sauce being added was just too great. My second thing, would be to add a little red pepper flakes or perhaps some dried serachi chilis to give it the punch of heat I was desperately wanting it to have, and didn't. Overall, it was a great recipe and the kids enjoyed it and we will be making this one again!

I used a suggestion earlier to cut down on carbs and calories from fat. It worked great, but the sauce was weird tasting, like something was missing. I added honey to sweeten it. Good idea! I added bok choy, green onion, carrots,red bell pepper and water chesnuts. Gotta have veggies. I think toasting the sesame seeds is a good idea. And next time I'll add fresh pineapple to the sauce too. Luckily the family loved it. Using a wok is key to cooking the chicken using 2 tbsp. oil. Way less fat. And I added the veggies after removing the chicken. Very good, and fast! Nice tricks to this dish. Will make again. Missfavor inspired this dish wonderfully. Thank you for all the suggestions from others too.

Definitely as good as in a restaurant! I don't really agree w/ the easier than it looks part though. I wasn't hard to make, but I would not recommend making it on a work night. I think next time I will try baking the chicken instead of deep frying as in the instructions. For some reason I got the impression that it was going to be like Mar Far Chicken, maybe because it said deep fry, but it was just marinated. This could easily be baked for much less calories. Must try and definitely worth it though!!

Absolutely delicious.

Made this on the fly and substituted the white vinegar with ginger infused white vinegar, and left out the toasted sesame seeds as I didn't have any. Still tasted great. Loved the crunchiness! 
Chicken:
For two people, 1 quart of oil was way too much. Filled the wok with an inch of oil to fry the chicken. Make sure the oil is all the way hot, or the batter won't stick to the chicken.
Sauce:
Keep the sauce on Low-Med to Med until AFTER the cornstarch has been stirred in. Mine ended up with some lumps.

This is a keeper, as demanded by the boyfriend. Can't wait to make again.
