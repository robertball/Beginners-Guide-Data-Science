These were quite easy to make. I was a little confused at the rather odd measurement of 1/8 teaspoon baking powder. I simply used a pinch of it, the amount that fits between my finger and thumb. I beat the butter and sugar with a whisk by hand, as my appliance is broken, but then when the flour came into play, I switched to a spoon and then my hands, which worked well.  I rolled the dough on my flour sprinkled counter and cut the cookies with a beer glass and they came out nice and thin.  I must say, I loved the taste of the dough a lot, so I ate some of it. ;)  One problem really is the lack of a time frame, but I went with the regular 12 minutes most thin cookies need and that was fine. This is why I only rate 4 stars – the 1/8 teaspoon (which is technically almost un-measurable in this way), and the missing baking time.  I just burned the lower sheet a little, because it wasn’t evident when looking at them from the top, that they were already done. Next time I will put them onto a higher rack in the oven and I’m sure they will be fine.  They are awesome with milk, and I am sure they are great with coffee, tea, chocolate milk and the like as well. My man immediately loved them.

This cookie was light and tasty.  It reminded us of shortbread but with more flavor.  We also tried putting frosting on them--they were tasty but best left undecorated.  We'll definitely make these again.

Made these this Christmas, but my family did not like them.  I also tried a recipe for Swedish Rye Cookies on another site that contained cream cheese that I thought tasted better.  Should I have used light rye flour?  I used dark because that's what I had on hand.  For my other Christmas cookies I used whole wheat pastry flour and they turned out great (whole wheat chocolate chip cookies, w.w. snickerdoodles).  If I make these again, I will try LIGHT rye flour.

This recipe smells exactly like my grandmothers Swedish Rye Bread baking. A new family favorite! Thank you so much for sharing.

These cookies are strangely addicting!  I was a bit confused though: there is no baking time included in the directions so I'm not sure I baked mine for long enough.

These are fabulous and easy to make.  Despite the low amount of sugar, they still taste like a cookie and not a cracker.  I just cut mine into squares with my pastry cutter instead of cutting circles, and I got 3 dozen 2in. cookies.
