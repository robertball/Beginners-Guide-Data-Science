I made this for the Western Faceless Frenzy July 2012.  Very easy to throw together and the dressing is a little different than most.  Add what you like - I added tomatoes but avocado or some pinto beans would be a good addition.  Thanks!

So good!  The dressing is fabulous.  My whole family loves it and my son, who eats very little due to appetite suppression from medication, went back for seconds!  Suggestion: donâ€™t break the chips and add into the mixture. Instead, try using the chips as scoops for each bite.

Was delish and will be a repeat! I used black beans instead of olives and will add tomatoes next time. The dressing is a little heavy so I would not recommend avocado.

we skipped the garlic & onion, but this was still delicious.
