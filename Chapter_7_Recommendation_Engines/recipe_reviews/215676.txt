I tried this recipe as written. The spice combination was a bit strong.  I expected it to have a sweet but spicie kick.  The cayenne pepper over powered all the brown sugar and other spices.  Might try it again with a little less cayenne pepper.  I also think the blend was a too thin in consistancy to properly coat the broccoli for effective carmaization.  Less lemon juice and olive oil might correct this problem.

Great simple recipe!  I followed the recipe pretty exactly, though I eyed the spices, no measuring. Tastes great! Super simple!  I'm vegan... next time I will throw in some chick peas and serve this over rice... perfect meal!

I followed another review and added chick peas over rice.  Also added roasted red peppers chopped and mixed in the broccoli.  I like the added spices, but think I would leave the oregano out next time.  I think the spices competed, but all in all turned out to be a great meal with a side spinach salad with pear and almond slivers.

I liked this.. I used 24 ounces of broccoli, mixed all the dry ingredients, sprinkled the broccoli with the lemon juice and 1T of oil ( which was plenty) and then sprinkled with the seasoning mix, tossed and baked.  I think I baked a bit longer because I like the browned edges of the broccoli.

This was really good and super easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and the spices were a little strong for me.  But my non-vegetable eating fiance asked for more.  Next time it will try it with out the oregano and thyme.

Loved this!  Cut cayenne, oregano & thyme to 1/4 teaspoon -- also did as other reviewer drizzled with olive oil & lemon first, tossed, then mixed all dry ingredients at measurement indicated, sprinkled on top then cooked.  It was fabulous!

Sweet, but good.  I mixed with roasted potatoes and chickpeas--the three complimented each other nicely.

A friend made this the other night with salmon. The salmon was excellent but this broccoli dish was awesome.  It was like eating candy, sweet and spicy candy.

We really liked this, but only used half the cayenne pepper and it was still really spicy.

I followed the reciped verbatim. The cayenne was way too overpowering and the spice combination was "off". The broccoli had a weird tangy, way too spicy, sweet kind of taste and they did not caramelize at all. I won't be trying this again.

I will try almost anything once, I will not try this again. It was just to "funky" for my taste.  For now I will just have my broccoli raw.

I told my toddler this was "broccoli candy" and had him help me add the brown sugar. He actually ate two florets, a huge leap forward in the hard-fought vegetable campaign I am waging. I left out the cayenne pepper, lemon juice, and garlic powder, but used the thyme and oregano. I also halved the broccoli while leaving the other quantities as is, and was happy with the proportions. My husband and I liked it very much as well!

LOVED IT!!! The only thing I did different was to put the broccoli in a bag, and slowly add oil, shake to coat, add a little more, shake and so on... and then added the spices. I only ended up using a couple of tablespoons of oil and the spices were perfectly distributed. Next time I will cut the cayenne to 1/4 tsp (for the daughter) but I will always go to this recipe to use broccoli!

No clue why this has 3 1/2 stars, this is a great recipe and it punched the bland boiled/steamed broccoli in the ....  Well it tasted great!  I will be making my broccoli like this from now on!

This was a new and unique way of cooking broccoli - baking it.  Have never tried that.  This was a little sweet and a little zippy due to the cayenne pepper.  I did opt to use the dried oregano and thyme.  Good, but not the best way we've eaten broccoli.

Good, but too spicy!  My kids could not eat it.  I would do it again and half the seasonings.  Plus, I would blanch the broccoli first and let it marinade in the dressing awhile before baking.  I will try it again with my changes.

I didn't have garlic powder so I used a combo of minced garlic and onion powder. I didn't make any other modifications, it was delicious! The whole family loved it.

I give this three stars as written -- although I skipped the brown sugar, substituting a tiny bit of honey instead, I found the sweetness distracting, and detracting from the good broccoli flavor.  (I also had to leave out the cayenne and black pepper, due to allergies.)  Otherwise, I think this recipe is a keeper, four- or five stars even.

Next time, I will omit any sweetener, substitute lemon zest for lemon juice (darned allergies), and proceed with the garlic powder, thyme, and oregano.  A great way to prepare broccoli.

Ok, I totally had to improvise since I was out of olive oil (i know, crazy).  The cooking method is what impressed me, I rarely consider the oven when cooking veggies.  It came great, really awesome, I will definitely use this recipe again...I may even follow it exactly when I have some olive oil.

I was surprised to like this as much as we did...instead of lemon juice, I used lime to go with other flavors in our meal. I usually roast broccoli or top it with cheese sauce, but this is a good alternative and I'll be making it often.

Did not care for the mix of lemon and seasonings, I will stick to the basic steamed broccoli with seasoning salt and pepper!

We really enjoyed the tangy sweet flavors on this broccoli.  I didn't measure; I just sprinkled the ingredients on top, tossed and baked.  So simple!  I did bake it for 20 minutes (flipping half way through), as we like our broccoli well roasted.  I will definitely be making this again.

I don't care for this recipe, at all .. and unless you love cayenne, you had better back down on the amount they tell you to use.. I might try again and readjust all the spices.. I'm going to eat it anyway, cause I grew the broccoli..

Was looking for a good side to go with balsamic chicken (also from this site) and happened to have broccoli in the fridge so thought I’d give this recipe a try. While adding brown sugar may not have been the healthiest way to prepare, it actually made broccoli taste yummy! It went really well with my chicken too. I made exactly as written and wouldn’t change a thing. The florets were on the larger size so baked for the full 15 minutes.  I will make again.

350 degrees for 10-15mins is a bit of a joke. After 30mins at 350, with the rest of dinner waiting and getting cold, I cranked it up to 400 and had to cook it for another 20mins before it was soft. Cut out the cayenne and replace it with a tsp of red pepper flakes and a tbsp of fresh minced garlic. Add another 1/4 cup of oil to coat. Seasonings entirely too thin per recipe. Treat this like roasted broccoli, make it your own and go from there.

Don’t read this review! I accidentally grabbed ground ginger instead of garlic and decided to go ahead. Interesting result. Kind of Szechuan. I had 3 lbs broccoli and it was too much to work with. Increased time to 15 minutes and switched pans from top to bottom oven halfway through. Nevertheless I can’t stop snacking! I’m going to freeze this in microwave steamer bags in meal size portions.

This was awful. No one in my family would eat it and everyone likes broccoli. I will not make this again. I used half of the cayenne pepper and it was still too spicy. I wish the description mentioned the it was hot.

This was a great side dish! In fact, several of my guests said it was the best broccoli they ever had and wanted the recipe. I omitted the garlic in case some guests don’t like it, as my main dish had garlic.

This was an interesting recipe for broccoli. I do think it was a bit too sweet. Next time I’ll either cut the brown sugar in half or eliminate completely. I will probably double the cayanne pepper or find something a bit more spicy to replace it.

Quick & easy recipe! I used real brown sugar. The seasonings blend perfectly to create a spicy, sweet broccoli. My husband loved it  so much that he stopped at the grocery store for more broccoli so that I could make some more mid-week.

I found it a little sweet and I increased the cayenne. It definitely had kick but I'd cut the sugar in half next time. Was very good.

This was very good.  I did mix the oil, lemon juice, and brown sugar together in a large plastic bag, and, then, added the broccoli pieces.  I sprinkled the broccoli, after placing on the cookie sheet, with Italian seasoning and the red pepper.

First, let me say "I hate broccoli". Now I've tried it boiled, steamed, smashed, puréed, soufflés, smothered and covered with cheese. No joy. 
Tried this recipe as a last resort because of health issues (need more veggies) I loved it!!  I will make it again. I did have to adjust the seasonings (no salt) but it still came out really well. So now there is one way I will eat broccoli. Thanks!!

This is a quick, healthy recipe and very easy to make. I didn't use the thyme or oregano. The results were delicious. A little spicy for my liking (but I am a wimp with spice) but my husband absolutely loved! I will for sure be making again and I already have shared this yummy recipe.

Amazing!!!  Broccoli is my favourite and this was so good!!!
My husband said it was the best broccoli he's ever had, however it is unhealthy so wouldn't want it this way every time. 
I've made it every time I've had guests over, since I found the recipe.  Every single one of them have commented on the broc first, and it served beside expensive tenderloin. It is the feature of the plate. 
I tweaked it based on my guest as well as based on suggestions from other reviews. 
I used lemon pepper instead of lemon juice and cayenne, for people who like less spice, as cayenne is spicy. 
I've never incl the oregano or thyme. 
I cooked it longer than suggested. Longer gets broc darker and extra tasty.

This is way too easy!  It's a good mix of sweet, tangy, and a hint of spice.  I actually halved the recipe because I was just trying to use up some leftover broccoli.  I highly recommend this for an easy side.

Lemon juice does not go well with broccoli.  All four of us ate it but no one was a fan.  Would had been better off just with some olive oil, salt and pepper.

A great change from steamed broccoli.  I would use less cayenne for my 12 year old son, otherwise my family loved it.  Would make it again.

Sad to say, this was the first time I ever baked my broccoli lol.  What I did different was 1 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Everything else I kept the same. It turned out great! Will have to do it again sometime. I'd recommend it to anyone. Thanks for sharing.

I'm always trying something new for my picky thirteen year old son. Even though everyone else loved this, he thought it was too sweet. I had left out the Cayenne. Next time, I may add it but my fifteen year old daughter doesn't like spicy. This is my life.

Screw baking it, this is awesome used as a dressing for broccoli salad. I left it raw and added sunflower seeds, blueberries and avacado slices. Was amazing. Will make over and over and over again!

This is really good. I skipped the cayenne pepper and thyme.  Came out great sweet but not over powering and a lot of flavor. Broccoli is still a bit crispy would be better if not.

Little too much spice.  My kid didn't want to eat it, he did eat some as it wasn't burning hot but I will reduce cayenne next time.  I did use the oregano and thyme. I also added a bit of fresh shredded Parmesan.  I used a commercial half baking sheet which is almost as big as my oven rack. They had plenty of space to cook.  They cooked fine in approx 15 min.  For some reviewers who said they didn't cook that quick, maybe their pans were too crowded?  My husband enjoyed them.  Will make again, less spicy.  This recipe can easily be tweeted to your taste.  I like the baked broccoli taste.

This was not good. I suppose if i left out the Cayenne and the oregano it would be okay. At 15 minutes it was VERY al dente. I suggest steaming for a few minutes, coat and bake but I won't be making this again.

I have made this recipe several times and I love it!  This time I decided to make a meal out of it, so I made the recipe using broccoli and carrots, and I doubled the marinade ingredients (I leave out the oregano and thyme).  I used tri tip steak and cut it into thin slices with a little salt, pepper, and cayenne, and cooked that in a skillet with a little oil while the vegetables baked. When the vegetables were done and the meat was cooked, I poured the veggies into the meat skillet and cooked it all together for a few minutes, then served it over brown rice. The extra marinade was perfect when the veggies and meat were cooked together providing a nice coating and a lot of flavor.

Way too funky.  The broccoli did not cook in even 15 minutes.  So I let it cook 35 minutes and got the sugar to burn on the pan really well.  Not much sweetness on the broccoli. I could not tell if the cayenne or the under done broccoli that was my least favorite part.  I will search for another recipe entirely.

My husband wont touch broccoli with a 20 foot pole.  He tried a baby size bite and absolutely loved it.  I made this recipe exactly as listed and served it with Bourbon pecan chicken.  My husband is asking for the recipe to be made again. I'm so happy its the first time he has ever tried broccoli and asked for more!

It was a bit too spicy for our liking as written and the flavors never really pulled together. It was just a big mouthful of spicy. We added a bit of parm cheese to cut it a bit but it really didn't seem to help.

Great and easy! I followed the recipe exactly. The spices were great. Only change was to top with parmesan cheese before baking.  Next time I will cook a few minutes longer.  I covered the cookie sheet with foil for easy cleanup.

Very different, but not bad! I love spicy and sweet, this had just enough spice, I thought it was just right for broccoli!  It's a bit too sweet with two tbls of brown sugar, so next time I will go for one with same amount of cayenne, but if my kids eat it I will lessen that also. Also, did not do the oregano & thyme.

'Not a firebreather & I love sweets, but not this.  I had two bites.  I didn't add the oregano or thyme; or the lemon juice.  The brown sugar is the predominant flavor & it's just weird that you're having broccoli with brown sugar.  I like sweeter chinese food & while this isn't chinese, I thought I'd like it - with the cayenne - which I could barely detect.  Again, not a firebreather.  Those that thought it was hot must really be sensitive to spicy foods.  'Think this one is for the kids, not mine; but other kids.  :D

Loved this = served it with sweet chili lime chicken w/couscous also on AR - great dinner - great blend of flavors together - will make again with many other main dishes I am sure!  Might try it with a lo cal sweetener to save calories and maybe less oil next time - but great as is!

I liked the flavors, although I only used a third of the recommended cayenne pepper.  I couldn't imagine it with the whole 1/2 teaspoon.
I'd make this again.

Roasted broccoli is great!  Sauce keeps it moist. Kid approved, but not adored.
