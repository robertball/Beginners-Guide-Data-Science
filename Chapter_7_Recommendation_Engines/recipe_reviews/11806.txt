Another distorted vision of a dish that suppose to be fresh and simple./
This recepie is a mix of "pasta Puttanesca"+"Marinara"and a little of Arrabbiata.
If you ever Serve this dish to an italian (born and rased in italy), please don't call it arrabbiata
thank you very much and sorry.

Though tasty, I have to agree with Pino - this is  not an arrabiata and should not be classified as such.  Also, no true Italian would put cheese on an arrabiata (nor is cheese appropriate with fish and pasta.  Trust me.)

Fantastica! A mix of a Putanesca, Amatriciana and Arrabbiata, this hearty pasta is quite delicious no matter what you call it. A houseful of real Italians (bred, born and raised in Italy) ate this and loved it. I used taggiasca olives and suggest using olives in oil rather than brine for a rustic, authentic flavor. I cooked it the length of time required and was surprised that it cooked down so quickly, so that is a plus too. Lunch was ready in less than 20 minutes. Thanks Marbalet for your recipe.

great recipe, lots of flavor.  make sure you don't buy the tomatos that are already crushed; it makes things a bit too soupy.  don't skimp on the anchovies or other things that give the flavor. they can be overpowered later while simmering with the tomatos. what makes this dish so great is the daring flavor and uniqueness of the anchovies, capers, and olives. do not leave these out!!! takes about an hour including prep time, and was very easy (even for a college student)

I agree with other reviews for this recipe, I don't care of it's a true Arrabbiata, this was fantastic! The flavors are amazing. I did make one change; I used anchovie paste instead of fillets. Mentally, that was much easier for me to work with. This recipe also heats up nicely for leftovers.

I could care less if this is a true "Arrabbiata", it is a fabulous recipe with such depth of flavor!  I took advice from other reviewers and cut back a little on the red pepper, and it was a huge success.  Everyone loved it, and there were no leftovers!  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

We loved this dish. Just heavenly! Next time I will use 1/2 t. crushed red pepper instead of the 1 1/2. Just a bit firey for me but my guests loved it. It can always be added of course. Just depends on your taste for heat. A little anchovy paste is also an easy substitute for the fillets.

Tasty & spicy. Whole wheat penne, kalamata olives and chopped smoked sausage are what I used. Omitted anchovies. Fairly economical if you have some of those pantry basics on hand.

My husband and I love this recipe.  We follow the directions exactly, and enjoy the results time after time. This makes for great left-overs as well.

It was okay. The recipe is more like puttanesca with mushrooms. I used regular bacon b/c that is what I had on hand.

I used kalamata  olives instead of green olives , and the rest of the ingredients I used as directed. Plus 2 tbs. of tomato paste. Although Pino69 feels this should not be called arrabbiata or served to a real Italian he failed to comment on the taste which I found quite interesting with all the flavors although not deserving of 5 stars but not deserving of 1 star. It is closer to a puttenesca sauce but still tasty enough to make again.

We really like this. Next time I'm going to add slightly more anchovies and drop the olives, but it was great as it.
