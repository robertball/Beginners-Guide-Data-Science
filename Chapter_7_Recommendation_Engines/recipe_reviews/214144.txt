By far, the PURPLEST smoothie I have ever had! :) I had about 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple to use up, so I decided to use it in this recipe for a quick breakfast.  I had fresh berries on hand so opted to use those - about a cup total of blueberries and blackberries - and I used a carton of "Toasted Coconut Vanilla" non-fat yogurt, and no ice (personal preference).   The coconut flavor combined with the pineapple gave this a nice tropical flavor.  I enjoyed this quite a bit, and even though I had no syrup from canned berries, the flavored yogurt and pineapple made this plenty sweet as is.  I'll make this one again!

First smoothie I have ever made.  Didn't have crushed pineapple so I added freshly squeezed orange juice.  I also used a mixture of frozen blueberries and blackberries.  Topped with cool whip.  Turned out great!!

I wanted to cut the sugar back quite a bit so I used just the pineapple without the juice and frozen blueberries without sugar. To thin the smoothie out a bit, I used just a bit of fresh squeezed orange juice. Quite good.
