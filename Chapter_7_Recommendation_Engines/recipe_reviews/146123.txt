These were absolutely delicious! I have been looking for a great green bean recipe for a while now and this is perfect! The only change I made which I hate to do was change out chicken stock with soy sauce for the tomatoes and water. My husband hate tomatoes;-(..... but it was absolutely perfect!

2.24.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/146123/daphnes-green-beans/ ... I'm rating this a four considering I used canned green beans.  What I mean by that is, with canned, a three, with fresh/frozen & fresh tomato, a four or five.  Since using canned, I didn't add water & kinda (well, did) put the entire 15oz can tomatoes in (by mistake this time!)  I freeze chipotle peppers by the T so used one of those (equivalent to the pepper & sauce) with the other ingredients except the green beans & lemon juice.  Brought to boiling then added the beans to heat & lemon juice.  'Not too chipotle-y, which can be easy to do.  I tried before & after the lemon juice & liked it better before.  'Doesn't taste lemony, but gives a slight vinegar flavor.  Anyone having a garden with green beans & tomatoes should save this recipe.  :)

Fantastic side dish for any occasion. I used this for Easter and it was perfect with the spiral ham. The only thing I added was a sprinkle 1/2 - 3/4 cup Pepitas. (hulled pumpkin seeds, I toasted them in a skillet) when toasted, they compliment bacon really well. Everyone loved this dish!
