Whatever is ailing you, this smoothie will fix it. It doesn't matter what hurts, this is your cure. I used habanero powder instead of seasoning mix and used Tabasco® Chipotle sauce. I also had to use Angostura® bitters instead of Worcestershire sauce (I'm allergic to fish). I made one with an immersion blender and liked it. I ran another batch through my juicer and preferred it. If you use your juicer, put the pulp into a pot of homemade beans, you will be so, so happy. Thank you very much for this recipe!
