This is a wonderful toast spread. Make sure you really cream the butter first, then add the sugar and cream again, before you add the chopped hydrated cranberries. Make sure the cranberries are cooled, too. I've made this hurriedly and regretted it. The warm cranberries made the butter separate and not look good. When done carefully, this is pretty and scrumptious enough for gift giving with a loaf of fresh bread.

Delicious!  I made this for Thanksgiving, but didn't have a pretty container to serve it out of.  I put the butter in my decorator kit and used the biggest tip to make individual servings.  There is a great balance of tart and sweet to this butter that was wonderful on warm dinner rolls.  Quick and easy to make - and would be great on a scone.  Thanks Booksie B for sharing your recipe.  I'm making up another batch just to have at our house.

This is very tasty. I thought it was going to taste like icing with the powdered sugar, but it really just tastes like a flavored butter. I used leftover orange cranberry sauce. It worked well and I highly recommend. I just made 2 servings to try it first. Going to test it tommorrow on a toasted cranberry oatmeal bagel. ty

This was fantastic; the slightly tart cranberries provided a nice balance to the sweet flavors.  I served it at brunch with scones and muffins and received a lot of compliments. Thanks for sharing Booksie B, I will use this recipe often!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly but something was not right. I used the dried cranberries you can buy from the store.  Since that didn't work the second attempt I used whole fresh cranberries and followed the same directions.   I used a mini food processor type gadget to chop the cranberries which worked well. I did not use as much sugar because I did not want it too sweet. (I figured I could add more sugar after I tasted it.)

When I saw this recipe I immediately sent it to my mom - we're both cranberry lovers.  Her comment:"It is great! After it has been mixed for a day the flavour is really noticeable. Thanks for the recipe - it is a keeper."  She said it's very easy to make and has been putting it on dutch rusk (kind of like dry toast, for those that are unfamiliar with rusk), and says it's wonderful.  Forget just making this in the holiday season - any time is good!

A great Holiday spread! I didn't add any sugar, because the I doubled up on the cranberries and they had enough sweetness already.

Delicious on lots of things! I made a double recipe but didn’t get to bring any home because everyone wanted their take-home supply.   Great on rolls and cranberry bread. Pretty in a fancy bowl!!

I really wanted to like this but it was nothing special. Herbed butters are much more flavorful.

This was made for a Thanksgiving dinner, it is definitely a keeper.   My guests were asking for the recipe because it was so good, it was a real hit!
Some of the things I used to make it easier and one I didn’t pay attention to...
 I left my butter on the counter to make it easier to mix the sugar into.
I added only 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of the 3 (I didn’t read the recipe correctly) but it  was sweet enough for my taste.
I used 1 box of Craisins (sold in package of 6 individual servings) it was the right amount of cranberries called for in the recipe.
Once it was all mixed I placed it in plastic wrap to mold/shape it, then refrigerated until ready to place on a dish.

This was a perfect addition to our Thanksgiving Dinner table. Excellent on rolls but I think it  is best served on bagels. Makes a beautiful presentation.

I like this recipe, but added an extra tablespoon of cranberries and a teaspoon of orange zest
