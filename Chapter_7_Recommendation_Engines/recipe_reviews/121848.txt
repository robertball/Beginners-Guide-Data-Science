Yum.  Easier and quicker than I expected.  And so delicious.  I did add some cornstarch (1 T. in 1/4 cold water) to the sauce at the end of cooking time, just to thicken it a bit.  Next time I think I'll throw in some veggies--broccoli or asparagus go nicely with citrus.  More shrimp next time, too, as the family agreed that one pound just wasn't enough.  Good enough for company, quick and easy enough for anyday.

Awesome recipe. I did add 2/3 cup of dry white wine and really enjoyed the added flavor. I'm cooking this recipe again tonight for the 2nd time in a month!!

I omitted the lemon and orange peel, and used lemon juice from a bottle since I did not have any fresh lemons on hand. Did not miss the peel as the recipe was citrusy enough with out it. Next time I would reduce the olive oil to about 1/4 cup as there was leftover oil on plates after the meal. All in all this was a pretty good dish, very nice flavour.

I thought this dish was just okay, nothing horrible, just not great.  I thought the citrus flavor was much too strong and perhaps I might try it again, cutting down on the zest and juice.

Very Easy and Tasty!! Added cornstarch at the end of cooking to thicken a little and then added brocolli.  My picky eater wouldn't eat but my husband wants it put on monthly rotation! Thanks.

Wow!  I submitted this recipe to Taste of Home over 6 years ago for a contest. (I didn't win) I was amazed to find it on this site.  It has now been published in Quick Cooking magazine, the Quick Cooking Annual cookbook, the new big Taste of Home cookbook, and now on this site.  I'm thrilled!  Try it, you might like it!

Not to our taste. VERY odd. I will stick with normal clam sauce with my linguini.

This was great!!  I changed the recipe to 2 servings and the sauce was perfect.  Although, I did add a little coarse ground garlic salt to season. New Year's resolution was to learn to cook and this is easy enough for anyone!!  Thanks so much

This recipe was very easy and delicious. I decreased the oil by half and it was still yummy and healthy! My husband and two kids gobbled it up!

I made it without the lemon, which it needed for the more tart flavor, but I thought this was delicous. 

We can't eat gluten so I served it over coconut rice, yum!

Super easy and quick to do- my husband actually made it this evening. I would follow previous posters' advice to thicken up the sauce a bit and add in something green like broccoli or even parsley. Possibly some red bell for added color. Who doesn't love a pretty dish? Oh, and I didn't do any of the zests. Would also cut down on the oil I think a bit. Double the garlic(for our tastes). Great base!

Awesome recipe. I modified by adding 1/2 cup of white wine, omitted the lemon & orange peels, but kept the lemon juice.  Decreased the oil by about half, used about 4 garlic cloves, and added 1 teaspoon cornstarch at the end of cooking to thicken slightly. Not sure this really yields 6 servings, more like 3 or 4.

Fairly easy to prepare. I enjoyed this dish a lot. I really enjoyed the citrus flavors. I never really had a pasta and shrimp dish like this before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. This is a good dish to serve in the Spring with a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

We liked the tangy citrusy taste - it was different than other shrimp dishes we're used to - but felt as though the dish was missing something to make it complete. Next time, I may add in asparagus, as someone else recommended. I left out the zest, and it was a good acidity. Used about 12 oz. of linguine, and added in the cornstarch as recommended by the top reviewer. Will make again. Thanks!

This is a nice light and tasty supper.  I have a few suggestions that I used from other reviewers.  I didn't add grated orange or lemon peel, although it might have intensified the flavours.   Also, I used 1/4 cup oil and minced the garlic before putting in the blender.  I also added a bit of cornstarch to the final sauce to thicken.  I also briefly microwaved broccoli and yellow pepper and added this to the pasta before poring in the sauce.  Hope this helps

Just tried this recipe tonight and my husband and I are very disappointed.  I did not modify any ingrediants.  The sauce was too watery and the flavor was not to our liking.

I also added some cornstarch since the sauce seemed too thin for my liking.  And instead of lemons, I used fresh pink grapefruit juice. I also added mixed frozen vegetables. It was delicious.  Loved the citrus flavor.

My family loved this recipe! It reminded me of a meal I had at the Olive Garden once. So I added to it ; some diced red peppers and sliced black olives. The citrus was perfect in this recipe. YUM! I am thinking of making it for a Christmas party I am having the day after Christmas. Thanks Diane for a great recipe, I even send this to my cafemom friends on occasion.

I made this with slightly less citrus (in each ingredient), and my whole family loved it, including guests and small children! Serve with a really good crusty bread.

I didn't care for this.  The citrus was overwhelming for us and we both enjoy citrus!  Also, aside from the flavors, I thought it lacked variety of texture, color and veggies.  Sort of boring on your plate.  Maybe snow peas?? I may actually try using the liquid as a marinade for a shrimp BBQ.  That may be better for my taste.

I love this recipe.  I followed the suggestion to add broccoli.  My wife and I agreed that the broccoli seemed a little out of place.  Next time I will leave it out.  I might try adding a little white wine next time.  I will be making this one again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe wasn't bad, but the prep time was way off. It takes a long time to peel and devein a pound of medium shrimp (and I doubled it to 2  pounds, which was a better ratio). Also, I had to modify it according to the other comments (way less citrus), and add salt, and butter, and red pepper, and asparagus. It was pretty good but I still felt it was missing an element or a taste or a texture that would make it truly delicious. More red pepper? Muscles? I would like to use the lemon sauce for a veal cutlet though.
