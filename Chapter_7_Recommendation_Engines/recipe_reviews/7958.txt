I also thought muffins came out rather bland so I made a few alterations.  I would recommend substituting the white sugar with packed light brown sugar; increasing the spices to 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp ground ginger, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg (I did not have any pumpkin spice or ground cloves); and increasing the pumpkin puree to 1 cup.  These changes produced more flavorful muffins.

I made these and they were a big hit!! The people at the party I took them to claimed I had put an addictive substance in them :-)  

I used packed dark brown sugar instead of white, I used 1 cup of pumpkin instead of 3/4 cup, and I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg.

I also made them into mini muffins, so I used mini chocolate chips.  cooking the minis for 15 minutes worked well.

This was a great recipe although me and some of my taste testers thought there was too much chocolate chip.  I think I will try mini chocolate chips or chocolate shavings next time.  Also, I "wetted" the chips then put them in with the flour mixture before mixing in with the wet.  This coated them and helped to prevent the chocolate from falling to the bottom. These muffings are also wonderful with homemade cream cheese frosting!
oops one more thing, I found 400 was too high and burned the outside.  375 for 20 minutes was perfect.

I doubled this recipe to make 2 dozen muffins.  I made the following changes to the recipe: applesauce in place of the oil, I used the entire can of pumpkin and the whole bag of chocolate chips.  I also just used PAM spray rather than liners or shortening + flour in the pans.  I followed the other reviews and only set the oven to 350.  They were done in 20 minutes and tasted fabulous!

I love these muffins!  I make them two different ways: exactly as in the recipe (except maybe with a little more pumpkin) and with cream cheese.  Put half the normal amount of batter in each muffin cup, then add a dollop of cream cheese with a little bit of sugar added and finally put the rest of the batter on top.  Bake as the recipe states.  The muffins come out with a little surprise in the middle!

I just finished making a batch of these and they turned out fantastic.  I did, however, make some modifications.  Instead of oil, I used apple sauce to cut down on the fat (you can't even tell there's no added fat!).  I also added about 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  I would definately make these again!

I read many of the reviews before I made these...seems like everyone re-wrote the recipe before they rated it! The comments about it being too dry/dense/moist really bother me, when the reviewer made substitutions that drastically alter the batter proportions. So I made these muffins exactly according to the recipe. They're moist and tasty. 5 stars.

These are very tasty.  Suggest doubling the recipe, since a can of pumpkin contains at least 1 1/2 cups- that way, you're not wasting the pumpkin. Replaced oil for apple sauce and are very moist! Always a request from my husband and co-workers.

Incredible muffins!  Used mini muffin tins to make bite sized morsels and they turned out beautifully *and* they were so easy!  Reduced baking time to 15 minutes for the minis.  I also substituted mini chocolate chips.  Great flavor - and as others have said - a wonderful surprise!

I am so glad that I used 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 1/2 cup. I really liked these muffins and so did my husband. He does not like pumpkin but found the pumpkin to be so mild he didn't notice. (I only added 1/2 cup pumpkin instead of 3/4). Also, I substituted apple sauce for oil, used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and brown sugar instead of white; and the muffins came out great! I will certainly make these muffins again!

This recipe is great!  I made about 4 batches yesterday varying the spices per the other reviews and found the best batch was with the following changes to the original recipe:  1 cup pumpkin (used fresh), omitted the salt & cloves (didn't have any), substituted brown sugar for white, 1 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. nutmeg, 1/2 t. ground ginger and replaced the white flour with whole-wheat white.  I also found baking at 375-degrees for 20 minutes was perfect!  I gave these out as treats for my neighbors and everyone asked for the recipe...

These were very tasty! I doubled the recipe to make 24 muffins. Subbed 3 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice for the cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg. It was perfect! Also, I dusted the chocolate chips with a little bit of flour before mixing them in. This helps them stay suspended in the batter better, and not sink to the bottom of the muffins. Worked out great! :-)

These are easy and come out good every time. I did make some changes to suit my family. But, even as is they are really good.  If the review says it's bland it's because the spices are old. Spices loose their flavor after a month or so on the shelf. My spices were fresh and doubling it was too spicey. This comes from an Indian family, so we eat lots of spicy curries and this was too much doubled. Perfect as is.  I added, 1/4 c sour cream, added 1/2 teaspoonn vanilla, and subbed milk for the water, increased pumpkin to 1 cup and baked at 350 (took 5-10 min longer). 375 at 20 minutes made them rise really well in a dark pan.  One cup of choc chips was plenty. Two was way too much. Even as wrote the easiest and best muffins I've made, this comes from a woman who has her own baking business! Thanks for sharing!

Very good! I used applesauce in place of oil and used whole wheat flour. Came out a tad dry but thats probably because of the flour? Still getting ate up though!

I made these last night to start off the new month of October and these are a true tinge of Autumn!  I used 2 Tsp. of Pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices and found it to be perfect! LOVE the pumpkin/chocolate combination. I think 1/2 Cup of chocolate chips is just right, anymore would be overkill.  Very nice moist muffin.  THX.

These are very tasty. I used a bit less sugar and chocolate chips than the recipe called for and still turned out delicious. Cover and refrigerate / freeze within a few days, otherwise you'll be left with hard muffins.

These were good. Four stars as written and a solid recipe. However, I can tell just by the measurements on the cinnamon and cloves that these wouldn't have been spicy enough for us. I doubled all the spices and ended up using 1 cup of butternut squash I needed to get rid of (squash is interchangeable as far as I'm concerned).  I also subbed applesauce for the oil and replaced 1/2 cup of flour with whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup with ground wheat germ. I sneak fiber and protein in on my daughter every chance I get!

This is a good standard recipe but I added applesauce in place of the water---or could use sour cream if you like. I like a bit more cinnamon so I increased the amount to 3/4 tsp. The chocolate is a nice addition but some walnuts or pecans would be nice as well.

I always feel the need to tinker with a recipe so here goes: Increased pumpkin to 1 cup. Reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, added 1/4 cup of buttermilk in place of water and then spices as follows:2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves, eliminated allspice. Added 1/2 cup walnuts and 1/4 cup golden raisins.Didn't use the choc. chips as my husband wasn't home and he could'nt make me. He would put them in everything, a confirmed chocoholic:)Used paper muffin tin liners and preheated oven to 350 degrees and cooked the muffins for 18-20 minutes til my bakery poker came out clean. All the rest of the ingredients I used as in the recipe.House smelled spicey good.

After reading the reviews, I think I'd like to say first that these are PUMPKIN MUFFINS.  If you're looking for a sweet roll, look elsewhere.  I made this exactly as is.  The pumpkin and spices are subtle, yes, I agree on that.  If the chocolate chips weren't in there, I probably would say they're too bland, but the chips, while being subtle also, give them just enough of an extra something to really "make" them.  They are easy, and moist.  I personally thought they were better after a day or two.  I gave some to two ladies at work who *loved* them.  Next time I may try applesauce instead of oil to cut some fat.  But then, not all fat is bad.

I made these with high hopes, since the Downeast Maine Pumpkin Bread is one of my favorite AR recipes. At first I was a bit disappointed because I thought they could have been better. However, after a day or two they got even more flavor and went from four stars to five. I'd recommend making it a day or two ahead of time so the flavors can sink in.

These were fantastic!! I was making pumpkin pie and I had left over pumpkin, so I thought I'd try this recipe and boy am I glad I did. Everyone loved them! The only thing I did different was to substitute some of the water for evaporated milk that I have left over from making the pie. I think it made it even better and next time will use all evaporated milk instead of water. These muffins were moist and filling and I highly recommend them.(even my husband that hates pumpkin loved them)

Should have read the reviews and alternations before trying them. This is a great start to a recipe but it needs more flavor. My second attempt at baking these I used 1/8 c oil and 1/8 cup apple sauce. Then 1 heaping cup of pumpkin and 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. If you don't have that try doubling the nutmeg and cinnamon and a pinch more of cloves. Everything else was perfect! With these alterations I give it a 5 star.

Did the typical substitutions that people suggested - dark brown sugar instead of white, whole wheat instead of all-purpose, more spices.  Split the batter in two - with half I added semi-sweet and white chocolate chips with vanilla - the other half I added raisins, almonds and orange extract.  YUM!

I loved the Muffins. I liked that it had less sugar than most of muffins out there. I used applesauce instead of oil and the muffins came out great. I will use this recipe again. Thanks

Delicious!  Great colour and texture, not too sweet, and pumpkin is a nice delicate flavour which went really well with dark chocolate.  Used fresh steamed pumpkin instead of tinned, dark chocolate chips, and omitted ground cloves as I didn't have any.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making again.

The were very easy to make and they had a great flavor.  I doubled the recipe and I was short about an 1/8 of a cup of pumpkin, and I did not want to open another can, so I substituted apple sauce instead.  They turned out great.

I am giving these a three as the recipe stands.  I spruced them up a bit and they still came out bland, so I can't imagine how bland the original recipe must be.  I used 1 c. pumpkin, doubled the spices, and a cup of chocolate chips.  They came out flavorful spice and chocolate wise, but they weren't sweet enough at all.  Next time, I would either take the brown sugar suggestions some people talked about or I would increase the white sugar to a cup.  The muffins are very moist and flavorful once you up the amount of spices, but it's missing the sweetness which would help to bring all of the flavors together.  I think I am going to make a powdered sugar glaze to put over the top of them to help add some sweetness to them.

Excellent!  Very dense, almost cupcake like consistency.  I made the following modifications, based on previous reviews:  subbed brown sugar for white, doubled spices, added 1 cup pumpkin, extra chocolate chips.  Perfect.

The first time I made this recipe I thought they were kind of bland, but in all fairness, I didn't have ground cloves, which would make a difference.  After reading the other reviews, I made these again as a double batch so in addition to doubling the ingredients, I used brown sugar instead of white, 2 cups of pumpkin, cinnamon applesauce in place of the oil and increased all the spices (including ground cloves this time) by at least 1/4 tsp (I didn't carefully measure my increases, I just added some) plus I added 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  Wow!  This recipe started of good, but a little bland, but with the changes, the muffins are delicious!  Thanks to all who commented on changes in their reviews!  Update - I made these again yesterday using my changes above and using canned sweet potato casserole (Glory brand) because I couldn't find pumpkin and they were still delicious - you can't tell the difference....Yummy!

Really good!!  I used a few suggestions of other comments...used applesauce instead of oil, brown sugar instead of white sugar and added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  The flavor was great, although they weren't as moist as I had hoped, so next time I think I'll just use the oil instead.  I also baked at 375 for about 23 minutes.

I have a daughter who is allergic to dairy, eggs whites and peanuts, and I alter every recipe i can for her. With a couple small changes, these turned out to be a great treat for her. I use a 3:1 tablespoon ratio of water:ground flax seed to replace EACH egg and i use dairy-free semi sweet mini chips. I kept everything else the same, however, I might try replacing the oil with the applesauce for added fiber and lower fat. These were a hit among all three of my children!

Just made these with my daycare kids.  We loved them.  I added more pumpkin and no water. Used 1/2 whole wheat flour.  Delicious. Wish I didn't have to send them home with the kids.  :-)

I give it 5 stars, my daughter gives it 4 stars. She says they aren't sweet enough, but I prefer muffins with just a touch of sweet.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I used mini semi sweet chips.

These are really yummy!  I made quite a few changes - I used light brown sugar instead of white sugar; I used 1 cup of pumpkin; I used fat-free milk instead of water; I used 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/4 teaspoon allspice (I'm out of nutmeg); and I used about 3/4 cup chocolate chips.  I did not use liners and filled the tins a bit over 3/4 full and got exactly 12 muffins.  I baked them at 350F for 20 minutes and they came out with big rounded tops and are so moist and yummy!

With modifications this is a 5 star for sure: I did 1.5 the recipe (to use a whole small can of pumpkin) I used brown sugar instead of white I used half oil and half applesauce I used buttermilk instead of water I used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the listed spices And I used 1 cup chocolate chips.  The way I made it, it made 12 big muffins and 12 mini ones. So fluffy and spicy. Tastes like fall!

I wasn't too sure about the marriage of pumpkin and chocolate, but it worked out great.  Unless you have other plans for that other half can of pumpkin, you might as well double up this recipe.  You'll want the extra anyway.  I didn't have clove, so I used Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove.  Needed more than called for, so I used 3 teaspoons for a double batch.  Personal preferences, brown sugar instead of white, and 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips for a double batch.  Any more than 20 minutes in my oven would have over-cooked them.

I doubled the recipe and I couldn't believe how quickly my family had devoured these! They loved them. I went ahead and doubled the spices. Oh, and just for the heck of it I threw in a little vanilla and almond extract. Thanks for the "just what I was looking for" recipe Donna.

These were delicious! The best muffins I've ever made. I used 3/4 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/4 cup ground flax seed. Then I reduced the sugar to 1/2 and used dark chocolate chips. Unless you're making these for dessert, you wont miss the sugar. 

WANING! The muffins disappear quickly. I suggest making a double batch.

Delish! I took the advice of another member and used brown sugar instead of white. I also used 15 oz. canned pumpkin and doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg. I think next time I will only double the cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of semisweet choc. chips was more than enough for mini-muffins. I baked them at 375 for 15 min. and they were perfect!!!
Made these again. Doubled the recipe and used applesauce in place of the oil. Used 1 cup of white whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour. Baked for 20 minutes. Made 24 huge muffins. Delish!

These are ok nothing too special. I did add 1 cup of pumpkin, but that didnt really do much more for the flavor. I actually added about 3/4 cup of choc. chips, and the muffin tasted more like choc. chips then pumpkin. Other than that, they are really quick and easy. But I did not get the pumpkin taste I was looking for.

Wow these are great.  They are nice and moist with a great pumpkin flavor.  I used mini chocolate chips and whipped up some pumpkin spice butter (butter, ppspice, and a little canned pumpkin) to spread on the hot muffins mmmm : )

These muffins are pretty good, but didn't have as much flavor as I expected them to. They are very moist, and the taste that they do have is good, but they need a little more pumpkin and spice flavor.

Perfect for the holidays or any other time of the year! I'm a sucker for anything pumpkin and anything cinnamon. I doubled the spices to my own liking and put a little less chocolate chips than called for because I didn't want the chocolate to overcome the pumpkin flavor. Another reviewer mentioned "wetting" the chocolate chips and putting them in the dry mixture before adding the wet, so I did that but the chips still sank to the bottom. But it tasted great so I guess it's not really a problem! I would definitely recommend everybody to try these :)

I followed the directions exactly and they were mediocre at best. Many people were happy with this recipe when they added extra spices. Let your taste buds be your guide. You, like the obvious majority, may love them. This is a lower fat muffin. If you are counting Weight Watcher points this is for you (2 pts without the chips).

Made these for breakfast today and they were great!!  I made 3 minor changes to the recipe: used melted butter instead of oil, added 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual measures of the other spices and increased the chocolate chips to 1 cup (can't ever have too much chocolate!).  These were just the right amount of sweet and went great with scrambled eggs and bacon.  This recipe is a keeper and will be making them again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

I used 2 tsp. cinnamon and doubled the nutmeg.  Also used a full cup of pumpkin.  It made 15  muffins that were delicious!  I also baked at 375 for about 2or 22 minutes.  400 would have been too hot, for sure.  Will surely do again!

Yummy!  I've been on a 20 year search for muffins that taste like a long ago closed bakery used to make, and I finally found them.  For convenience, I made them in a mini muffin pan (baked for 9 minutes at 350 rather than 400).  The only change I made was to double the spices as others have recommended.  I also followed the advice to coat the chocolate chips in flour before adding to the mixture to ensure they didn't fall to the bottom of the muffin and they were perfect!

So good! A huge hit everywhere I take them, extremely moist. I do not bake them as long as the recipe says, just go with my oven (it's temperamental).

The first time I made these they were very moist and yummy.  The second time I made it I doubled the chocolate chips and the cinnamon and thought they tasted even better.  If I was to alter it further I would maybe do half brown sugar and half white sugar.  They cooked great at 380 degrees for 20 minutes and my whole family loves them.  Thanks!

I haven't made these yet, but I looked at the list of ingredients and was shocked to see it takes 3 cups of white sugar and 8 eggs, 6 cups of flour.  This is going to yield more than 12 muffins.  I just want to make 12 muffins.

Very, very good!  Rich - more of a dessert muffin or late afternoon snack than a heavy, first thing in the morning muffin.

I followed previous reviewer's recommendations and changed to brown sugar, doubled spices and used 1 cup of semisweet and white chocolate chip, plus reduced oven temp to 375 degrees (which worked out well since I had a casserole in the oven already at this temp) and muffins came out well. I found that trying to get the paper muffin cup off the muffin when it's still warm was very difficult - a substantial amount of the muffin bottom remained on the paper. Next time I'll make them in advance so I don't have to worry about them sticking to the paper.

These were very good. I used 1 cup of pumpkin,  dark brown sugar, 1/4 cup apple sauce instead of vegetable oil, doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg and added 1/2 tsp ginger, and lastly, used 1/2 white flour, 1/2 whole wheat. Had a somewhat chewy texture which I liked. Overall very good!

Excellent!!!  I substitued applesauce for oil. Used 1/2 cup of brown and 1/4 cup of white sugar. 1 full cup of pumpkin, doubled the cinammon, nutmeg and chocolate.  I might use 1/8 tsp of cloves next time, a little too much cloves for my taste. And DEFINETELY use pam and NOT cupcake liners.

I made this slightly different since I was trying to use up the Libby's pumpkin pie mix that I buy every year by accident lol. I used one cup pie mix, substituted applesauce for the oil, added a tsp of pumpkin pie spice, 1/8 of cinnamon, 1/4 cup white sugar, and 1/2 brown sugar. These are delicious!!

Quite good -  I always tweek a little according to what's on hand -  used only whole wheat four, 1 heaping cup pumpkin, 1 T. pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 t. cinnamon as spices and omitted water because I added 2 mashed bananas that needed to be used.  VERY moist and dense and both kids and husband love them.  Thanks!

I used pumpkin pie filling instead on canned pumpkin by accident. I didn't realize it intill I already put them in the oven. That means I also added the spice. I was worried they would come out to "spicy", but thank goodness they still came out tasting great. Next time I will have to read the can more carefully.

Yummy yum yum! On a snowy day in Denver I made these little treats. I did the recipe as written--but used mini chocolate chips. This actually yielded 14 muffins for me, not 12. Delicious!

This is the first time I made muffins and they were moist and great tasting and much better the next day.I added more chocolate chips, but don't try and do this because it makes them cook weird with pockets of air. Also - *make sure you have good quality cupcake papers or else the muffin will stick to the paper*... That is what happened to me. Add vanilla extract for better flavor!

We're actually rating these 4 1/2 stars.  We doubled the pumpkin and spices, and used brown sugar but other than that, everything stayed the same.  Great flavour!

Bake these muffins a day ahead of time and seal them in a plastic container. They have virtually no flavor the first day, and then all of a sudden they get moist and heavenly the next day!!!  FOR SINKING CHOCOLATE CHIPS: Coat chips with 1 teaspoon of flour before pouring into the mix. This works!!!  I used a whole cup of pumpkin, 2 cups of choco. cups of choco chips, doubled all of the spices, omitted the water and added a little milk. 22 minutes at 350 did the trick.

This is one of the best muffins I have ever eaten! Wonderful for fall with the spicy pumpkin and the semi sweet chips keep this from being overly sweet. This is a really great tasting muffin and thye aren't too heavy and dense either. Thnaks, I'm definitely going to make these for the upcoming winter holiday events. These are good enough for special occas.

So I am starting my second batch today because the one I made this morning is almost gone.  People that dropped by could not stop at just one.  Omitted water and used 1 cup pumpkin and added (LOTS) more chips.  Made exactly 12.

I made the mistake of making the recipe "as is" instead of taking the suggestions of other reviewers.  The muffins were very bland--they didn't taste pumkin-y or spicy.  Anything I bring to work is usually gobbled up within 5 minutes, but when I took a batch of these to work, there were still some left at the end of the day.  Maybe the muffins are good if you add more pumpkin, increase the amount of spice, and use brown sugar instead of white sugar.  They're not good if you make them as the recipe tells you to.

I made this as bread instead of muffins and it turned out great.  Made a double recipe and cooked it in a 9x13 pan at 350 for around an hour.  I didn't have ground cloves so I used allspice instead.

I'm sorry but these really didn't turn out very well. The texture and consistency were unlike anything I look for in a muffin. They came out so strangely that I convinced a friend to try the recipe the next day just to make sure it wasn't just me. She produced the same rather disapointing results. Sorry! It seems like a great base, I think it just needs some tweaking.

This is a nice recipe for fall and my family thought they were yummy. I substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose and added one TBL ground flaxseed and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of bran buds, letting them soak up some of the moisture of the wet ingredients before mixing it all together. It's pretty hard to mess up a muffin recipe!

Made with white chocolate chips (doubled) - YUM!  Subbed applesauce for 1/2 the oil and you'd never know it.  Great recipe to satisfy my October first-freeze-of-the-year-night craving!  My house smells awesome - thanks for sharing!

Excellent--did lots of substitutions, as recommended for more health-conscious recipe.  Loved how light and fluffy they are.  Excellent for kids snacks!

these were just delicious! i followed the recipe without making any major changes, but added 1 cup instead of 3/4cup of mashed butternut pumpkin (as in australia we don't have canned pumpkin!) and just a tad more chocolate bits than the recipe called for (hehehe!), and they came out very tasty and moist. however, there is only a very subtle pumpkin taste, but i'm not sure if it's due to the kind of pumpkin i used or not. either way i would definitely make these again. i recommend this recipe!

These are just so good!  The first time I made them my husband said he couldn't taste the spice.  I doubled the spices and used Splenda sugar blend.  Took them to work today and I'm being asked for the recipe!  One student came down and ate 2 while he sat here chatting w/ me!  This is just the best muffin recipe.  I also use dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

VERY GOOD!! I made a few changes as I am trying to eat healthier and thought this would give a less guilty chocolate fix than some things do!!  :) Used 1/2c. splenda..1/4c. brown sugar.. applesauce instead of oil, whole wheat flour, and didn't really measure the pumpkin pie spice..just poured some in! And  more like 1 c. of choco chips..and 1c. of pumpkin..these are soooooooooooo good..very moist and right amount of flavor!! A new fave of mine!!

Loved these!  A few suggestions, though:  instead of all flour, I added 3/4 cup flour and 3/4 cup Quaker oats to make healthier and heartier (the oats make the texture a bit more firmer, which we liked).  Also used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white.  Added a bit more spice than recipe called for and added the mini chocolate chips so as not to overwhelm the pumpkin flavor.

Quick, easy and delicious.  No creaming of butter, you don't even need to mix with electric mixer.  I used mini muffin tins and got 24 easy.  Very moist.  Better the next day.  I also used mini choc chips and the kids loved them!  Not to mention Mom.....   A great Halloween treat for school parties.

I was looking for something other then regular pumpkin pie or cookies to do with the can of pumpkin that I had, and I found this.  I wasn't disappointed!  My muffin tins weren't available, so I used a loaf pan instead and baked it for 30 minutes.  Came out great!

Made modifications, delicious muffin recipe! Swapped half the sugar for honey, added 1 whole banana and almost full can of pumpkin and vanilla extract. Used milk instead of water. For the flours, I used 1/2 c whole wheat, 1/4 cup rolled oats and 3/4 cup unbleached all purpose. Added a heaping 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. Baked at 350 for 23-25 minutes, so moist and delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I made these tonight.  I also thought they were very bland.  The texture was fine.  Even with chocolate chips, they just didn't have much flavor.  I'll stick with the Downeast Main Pumpkin Bread recipe here.

I make this exactly as written  no changes or modifications.  Perfect.  I have been making these for years.  My friend who has cancer and doesn't like to eat requests these all of the time.  I happily make them,  double the batch, 1 for her and one for me. I can't say enough positive things.  YUM

Tried this recipe with the suggested changes:  packed brown sugar instead of white sugar, 1 cup pumpkin, and double the spices.  They are delicious!  My kids love them and are already begging me to make more.  They smell fantastic when they are cooking too!  This is definitely going to be a new favorite in my house.

Made these the other day...a big hit!!! But the recipe calls for 3/4 can of pumpkin....Canned pumpkin comes in different size cans. I used the 15oz but I think I should have used the larger can.

These are awesome. I followed another review and used light packed brown sugar instead of white, a full can of pumpkin and opted for dark chocolate chips. 18 minutes in the oven and they were perfect.

This recipe is amazing!!!! A definite do-again, though I followed what other people like used brown sugar instead of white and more pumpkin and cinnamon. I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned so it's a bit watery so I reduced the water in this recipe as well.

I was looking for pumkinbread but these muffins were sooo much better. The family was home and I made them for Thanksgiving morning. My sisters, who are much better cooks than I, told me to make them for Christmas too.

Not bad but not great. I did use olive oil, doubled the spices and added some walnuts. I don't think I'll be repeating this one.

I followed the recipe exact (except substituting 1/2 oil with with applesauce).  They turned out really dry.  I think I will add milk instead of water next time, but not sure how much that will help!

Very delish. I even made mine without oil and it still turned out well! The pumpkin flavor and spices are not overpowering, and it has a pleasant aroma. The chocolate is a must for kids and works well as a complemet to the subtle pumpkin taste. I'd imagine it would also be great with walnuts, dried fruit...yumyumyum

Awesome recipe! Although as most other reviews reccommend I made a few substitutions...I used brown sugar instead of white, applesauce in place of the oil, used 1cup of fresh pumpkin puree, used less water and added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. baked for 20 min @ 350 degrees, it made 12 large muffins...delicious!

These just came out of the oven!  Very good!  I used mashed acorn squash (1C) instead of canned pumpkin.  Did add more cinnamon and used mini chocolate chips.  Will make again - I think you can use any kind of winter squash or canned pumpkin.  Next time, I think I will add 1 tsp of vanilla. They are not very sweet - which we like.

Great muffins.  I made them without making any modifications to the recipe (not sure if that is allowed on here ;).  Yes, do double the recipe, otherwise you will be wasting a half can of pumpkin.  I've made them 3-4 times already, and the kids love them.

I guess I'm more of a purist, but I prefer pumpkin baked goods just plain, maybe some nuts.  So while the chocolate chips were ok, I like it better plain.  My kids devoured them however and said they like them better with chocolate chips.  It's a good muffin recipe tho.

I'm a sucker for pumpkin...and chocolate, so pumpkin and chocolate is a match made in heaven.  Substituted applesauce for the oil but kept everything else the same.  Next time might try half chocolate chips, half chopped pecans.

My extremely picky niece liked these!  I followed other reviewer's suggestions, and substituted applesauce for oil, upped the pumpkin (used one 16 oz can for a double batch), and lowered the oven temp to 350 and adjusted the baking time accordingly (used the toothpick test for doneness).  I also used mini milk chocolate chips-they seem to disperse better in the batter, instead of dropping to the bottom. They came out moist and yummy!  Remember that if you don't use any oil, the muffins will stick to cupcake liners, so you may want to spray the tins instead.  The recipe as written is fairly healthy (for a dessert), but eliminating the oil may tweak it just enough to make it truly a good-for-you snack (3 grams of fat per 100 calories)!  Definitely will make it again!

What's not to love?!  Made these to bring with me on a Sunday morning for church and they were gobbled up by everyone.  I definitely had a few myself, and can personally say that the texture and sweetness were perfect for this muffin.  Very moist (even though I left them in the oven to long and the bottoms were a little overdone) and overall a great snack.  I usually use mini chocolate chips because I prefer a little less chocolate in each bite, but was out when I made these.  Still delicious, and not overwhelmingly chocolatey.  Will make again for sure!

I REALLY wanted to like these! It's the middle of summer and I was craving pumpkin...what a let down. As I made these, I was surprised by how little fat was in these. Well, that comes with a lack of good flavor and tenderness. These fell very flat. More pumpkin and moisture. Also, the baking time is WAY off for the temp. I checked these at 17 minutes and, while they looked beautiful, the bottoms were a tad burnt. As an avid, experienced baker (and eater!) this recipe needs some serious tweaking. The only saving grace were the morsels of chocolate...

Really great and easy recipe!   After reading a few of the reviews I did half brown and half white sugar.   I'm sure any combo would work great.    The pumpkin is mild enough even for those who aren't big fans of it.

These turned out delicious. I made some changes as suggested by other reviews. I used brown sugar instead of white, milk instead of water, 1 cup of pumpkin,  and doubled all the spices. I used mini choc chips and sprinkled them on the top instead of mixing them in. Very good!

When I think of a pumkin Muffin I think of a heavy flavorful muffin with a nice kick of spice. This recipe is cake like with a very light taste of pumpkin. It needs more of a wow factor for me.

Delicious muffins!  Like others, I substituted applesauce for the oil and used light brown sugar.  Very moist!  Next time I might turn down oven to 375.  I used a dark pan and although they weren't burned, they turned out a bit dark on the bottom.

I just made this last night.  Theses are what I did different based on other from reviewers...exchanged white sugar for 1c brown sugar, increased pumpkin to 1c, used 1c chocolate chips, substituted orange juice instead of water,  then added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin spice. Topped each muffin with a half walnut for dec.  Used muffin liners lightly sprayed with butter spray, baked at 375 for 20min.  Came out moist, with just enough sweetness.  These were yummy straight out the oven and even had one for breakfast this am and were even better.

used brown for 1/4 cup of the sugar and sifted dry ingredients straight into wet. Came out soft, moist and delicious. I wish theywould rise a bit more though. NOT bland if you use fresh spices!Thank you for the delicious easy recipe!

Good muffin recipe.  These were a big hit with my toddler.  I doubled the recipe to use up my entire can of pumpkin.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 3 cups white whole wheat flour.  I used vanilla soy milk in place of water.  In place of oil, I used applesauce.  I didn't have any cloves so used some allspice.

I made the same changes as Liz (from Nov '10).  1 cup sugar (instead of 3/4 cup) 1 cup fresh pumpkin puree (instead of 3/4 cup canned) 1 and 1/2 tsp water, 1 tsp All Spice but also added 1 tsp cinnamon. 3/4 cup chocolate chips. Bake at 375 for 15 minutes. I made them as a dessert and added homemade cream cheese frosting. Kids and adults love them!

These were really good. I made half with chips and half without.  I used mini chips and made mini muffins.  I would bake at 350 next time.  400 burned the first batch.  For mini muffins, only bake 12-15 minutes.  I also left out the cloves b/c I didn't have any.  I doubled the recipe so I could use the whole can of pumpkin.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing.  My kids love them.

i followed some of the modified recipes--doubled the nutmeg, cinnamon, increased the puree, and the chocolate chips, reduced the heat. they came out nicely looks wise, and ok taste wise.   my complaints are:  1. even with the papers liners, the muffins stuck badly to them 2. they weren't very sweet, but the chocolate chips helped 3. i wish i hadn't increased the chips, they were a little messy--too many choc. chips per muffin. 4. i had leftover batter and had to make 2 more than 12

Made these as mini-muffins, which took 12 minutes to bake.  To health it up a bit, I used applesauce rather than oil, egg whites only & whole wheat flour.  Since many reviews described these as bland, I did keep in the sugar, but used brown rather than white.  Also to boost flavor, I subbed orange juice rather than water & doubled the spices.  I used mini-chocolate chips which did not "sink" at all.  These were a delicious little treat - the kids gobbled them up!

I put melted butter instead of oil, and I used fresh pumpkin, they were good, they were a little sticky at the bottom, but the flavor was fantastic, I think next time I'll use honey instead and double the spices.My boyfriend was reluctant because he is italian and they don't eat a lot of Pumpkin here, but he eat 3 in a row

I used "real" pumpkin and upped the spices a bit, and still found these very bland.  If it weren't for the chocolate chips, they'd be pretty awful.  They weren't dry, but they were a bit tough around the bottom.  And they were 12 puny muffins, not regular size.

I tripled the recipe (using the allrecipe function) they were VERY dry compared to the pumpkin recipes I am used to. For the last batch I added 1/4 c. of applesauce trying to salvage them and they turned out better.

So good!!  I used 1/4 c brown sugar, 1/2 c white and then split the flour between all-purpose and whole wheat.  And since I didn't have any ground cloves, I used a sprinkle of all spice.  Upped the mini morsels to 3/4 c.  These were wonderful.  Made about 44 mini-cupcakes and I baked for 12 minutes.  Yum!

I won't bother trying any more pumpkin muffin recipes now that I've found this one! Using light brown sugar, applesauce and mini semi-sweet chocolate chips were great suggestions, they smell great, taste great and are not too sweet. This was also fun for my toddler to help out with. I'll be making at least three batches (doubling the recipe, too) of these to share at various get-togethers over the next month. Thanks for a great fall baked treat!

Used brown sugar instead of white and increased spices for more flavor. These are awesome muffins.  I serve them as a side dish for dinner all of the time. Wonderful warm with butter.

YUMMY!  Like some others, I substituted brown sugar and threw in a full cup of pumpkin - makes it so moist.  I also doubled all the spices because I like a full taste.  The mini chips gave it a nice little surprise inside and my kids gobbled them all up.

I made sure to read through most of the highest rated reviews before I tried this recipe....quite helpful. I took chibi chef's advice and used brown sugar instead of white and I cut it down to 1/3 of a cup. I used a full cup of organic pumpkin puree, 1 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and whole wheat flour. Pretty simple to throw together with pantry items I wanted to use up. Next time, I might try to play with it a little more, maybe use applesauce instead of water/oil and cut back the sugar even more.

Yum! I doubled the recipe, and used a cup of brown sugar and a half cup white. I also didn't have all the individual spices (except cinnamon) so I used Allspice and a 1/4 tsp more cinnamon. I also added 1 tsp vanilla. Turned out YUMMY!   I got 15 large muffins out of the doubled recipe.

These are good...they're not the best pumpkin muffins I've had because they're a little bland, but they're still worth making because it's a really fast and easy recipe to throw together.  They are moist, though, and I'm sure the flavor would be pretty easy to spruce up.

I actually found this muffin to be a bit bland - granted I didn't have any ginger - but if I were to try this again I would use a whole can of pumpkin as some other readers suggest, and I would add the recommended spices or try pumpkin spice and I would also try replacing the white sugar for brown as others suggested.

The recipe was good, but I agree with others that it needs to have either mini cholocate chips or shavings. The regular chocolate chips take away from the wonderful flavor of the muffin. My husband wants me to make them without the chocolate chips the next time and I think that will make them great as well.

I substituted sweet potatoes for the pumpkin and applesauce for the oil. Also did half brown sugar, half white and half whole wheat flour, half white. Also went a very slight bit heavy with the spices and added ginger to the list about 1/4 tsp.  The kids loved them, Tylar ate 4 in one day and begged for more! I filled the cups really full and only got 19/24

These are soooo good! I took the advice of previous reviewers by making the following changes: Brown Sugar instead of the granulated, doubled the cinnamon &  nutmeg, used mini chocolate chips & frosted with a homemade cream cheese frosting.  Will make these again and again!

I followed this recipe to the "T" and it turned out wonderful. My adult and picky son turned his nose up when I told him what was in it but then I caught him eating one. Those muffins went so quick! He even told me that I can make these instead of cookies...he's so spoiled!

These muffins were delicious. I love the taste of pumpkin so was very pleased with the taste. I gave it a four because the chocolate chips are unnecessary. I did add extra seasonings.

My family loves these muffins!  I use whole wheat flour and white flour (1:3 ratio). I also added 1 cup of flaked coconut and 1 cup of chopped walnuts to make a heartier muffin.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.   I substitued brown sugar for white and only used 1/2 cup.  I also used applesauce instead of oil, the entire can of pumpkin, 1 Cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 Cup white, mini chocolate chips and doubled the cinnamon.  I normally don't like it when people change the recipe, but I wanted to make it healthier for my two babies.  I also used a mini-muffin pan and it made 3 dozen!

I made this recipe this week, but realized I loaned my cupcake/muffin pans out - so I made it in a loaf pan.  Turned out awesome!  I did use brown sugar in place of white, and added more chocolate chips and a full cup of the pumpkin but other than that followed the recipe - I baked it for 40 min.  DELISH!

These were the best!  I increased the spices to 1/2 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp of cinnamon and increased the pumpkin to 1 cup.  They were super moist and the chocolate really complimented the pumpkin! Will be making these again for sure!

I was looking for a basic pumpkin muffin and this one worked well. I added extra cinnamon and allspice after reading the "too bland" reviews.  I have made this with the chocolate chips which is good, and also tried with chopped walnut instead.  When made with the chopped walnut, I sprinkled some brown sugar and crushed walnut on top. Delicious either way.

These were excellent.  Used a full 15 oz. can of pumpkin and replaced oil with applesauce. Baked for 12 mins at 400.

i had no more vegetable oil, so i used some applesauce instead. other than that i didn't change anything and they turned out so yummy! they got gobbled up, so i don't have a picture to show just how gorgeous they are (which they really really are). this was a good way to use up leftover pumpkin.

Love the texture and they look really great.  Not very good warm- wonderful after they've cooled!  I lined the muffin pans with cooking spray and a little cinnamon and sugar.  YUMMY!  Will definitely make again and again.

Excellent!  I used 1/2 c. of white sugar and 1/4 c. of brown sugar (instead of all white sugar), substituted applesauce for the oil, used 1 c. pumpkin, 3/4 c. of chocolate chips and was generous with the  spices.  They turned out great...had a slight problem with the muffins sticking to their liners but I'll use more cooking spray next time.

Made a few changes, and they turned out great! I doubled the recipe, used 1/4 c. oil and 1/4 c. applesauce. Used 15oz can of pumpkin and no water. Also, noticed the first batch was cooking too quickly, so I reduced the temp to 350 degrees. Also added a bit of vanilla. YUM!

I tried this after reading all of the reviews and had great results.  I added ginger, fresh pumpkin  and used part brown sugar.  The best change I made, however, was using cinnamon chips.  Everyone loved these.  I have already given the recipe to two people and my first attepmt at these was yesterday.

These muffins weren't pretty (they didn't rise well) but were moist and delicious. I substituted vegan egg replacer for the eggs, carob chips for the chocolate,  and used canola oil. I will be making again! Thanks! :)

They turned out wonderful for me! I quadrupled the recipe and used 3 cups of whole grain spelt flour and 3 cups of white spelt flour, used 6 instead of 8 eggs, used 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil, used 2 cups of raw sugar and 1 cup of splenda, and sprinkled the muffins with some raw sugar before cooking them in the oven. I reduced the amount of eggs because I was afraid they would be too eggy tasting. I also used Hershey's special dark chocolate chips.  yummy!!!  I made so many because I wanted to give some away to my family.

loved these- I added a bit more chocolate and that was a bad idea-  Overshadows the pumpkin.  I'll stick with the original recipe next time.  Very good.

Excellent muffins.  Moist, flavorful and very easy.  I am extremely picky about baked goods and know a quality product when I taste one.  For inexperienced bakers, just make sure that you mix the dry and wet ingredients JUST until combined (or they will be tough and peak when baked)

This combination is surprisingly tasty.  Go ahead and double the recipe, because they will disappear quickly!  

The muffins stuck to the paper wrappers, so I recommend spraying the pan instead.  I altered the recipe to make it even more healthy by using applesauce instead of the oil, using just one-half cup sugar, substiting whole wheat flour for one-third of the regular flour, and adding three tablespoons of gluten flour to help the muffins be fluffy.  I found that I liked the spices to be a little milder, so I used half as much nutmeg and cloves.  

These muffins are really easy to make, healthy, and delicious!

Since we are a family of 8 and I'm watching two of my grandsons today, I tripled this recipe. I didn't have any cloves so added some allspice instead. I also didn't add as much nutmeg and threw in an extra handful of chocolate chips. I used milk chocolate chips. They turned out great!! Even the kids love them. They are a keeper!!

If you dont have true pumpkin fans, I would not try this on them.  It is good, but a wee bit bland.  The chocolate is a must in this recipe. 
It turns out well enough - but best served hot!

YUMMY!  Someone I knew made these at Christmas time last year, and I loved them.  So this time I had to try making them for myself.  I brought them to work and they cleared out quick.  I used mini-chocolate chips and those were just as fun as the big ones.

One word: yummy! I used 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the spices and sprinkled chopped walnuts on the top of each before baking. Normally I double the chocolate chips in recipes but I didn't in this one. I think it's fine with 1/2 cup!

I spiced to taste with cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves instead of the called for spice.

These were AH-MAZING!!! I took a few tips from other reviewers and used brown sugar instead of white, and doubled up on the spices, as well as using 1 full cup of pumpkin...and they came out PERFECT! They were moist and perfectly spiced. Instead of chocolate chips, though, I used pecan pieces. Next time I'll try the chocolate chips. *UPDATE: Made a double batch of the batter, and poured half of it into a loaf pan. Baked at 350 degrees for 55 mins. Wonderful Pumpkin Loaf!

As written I would not give this recipe 5 stars. It is only because I knew from experience with many baking recipes to heap the spices that these muffins ended up having real flavor. Sometimes spices have to even be doubled in some recipes, depending on the spice. Very worth a try though. I will make them again as everyone loved them.

My daughter and her friend made these for a playdate today.  They were pretty good.  I wish I would have read the reviews first and tried subbing the white for brown sugar.  I baked a fresh sugar pumpkin and made the puree  -- super easy if haven't done it before and I'm not much of a baker.  I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and we added a teaspoon of vanilla.  With the brown sugar I think They would have been perfect.  Dark chocolate a must.  We used mini dark chocolate chips.  We'll be using this recipe again.

I made these with the recommended changes of applesauce instead of oil and will say that it made them a bit too spongey/rubbery. Next time I'd use half oil/half applesauce. I slightly increased the chocolate chips but thought after that it was unnecessary. The addition of pumpkin pie spice was delicious and I slightly increased the pumpkin. I baked at 350 for 21 minutes and they were perfect. Also, I decided to try squares of parchment instead of baking cups and it gave the muffins a bakery look - great idea if you don't have liners too!

These were really overdone after 20 minutes--some of the chocolate even seemed burnt.  We could also barely taste the pumpkin.  I'm sure it could be tweaked, but then it would be a different recipe...so a different recipe is exactly what I'll look for next time we want pumpkin chocolate chip muffins.

This was a great recipe. It made 16 muffins instead of 12. Like other reviewers I added more spice. Also a little vanilla. And more chips. Would definitely make it again.

Ive made this one three times. The first time,  they were bland and I burnt them at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. 15 minutes probably would have been fine. 
The second time, I made them more flavorful, with double the spices called for, and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes.  PERFECT.

This recipe worked out pretty well for my purposes, and my friends gobbled it up pretty well.  However, one thing that I did notice was that it wasn't very pumpkin spicey, and that ended up being something that I didn't like.  I would suggest adding a little bit more pumpkin than it calls for, and 1/4 tsp. more of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.

Thought they were bland. Added 1/4 cup sugar.  Increased eggs from 2 to 2.5. Used 1 cup of flour and replaced the other 1/2 cup with cocoa. Increased chocolate chips to 3/4 cup in order to have some in the mix as well as sprinkling over the top before baking in oven. Came out very moist and delicious.

These muffins are so moist and delicious!  I made one modification:  I mashed up a ripe banana to add to them and combined it with the pumpkin before the step where the pumpkin goes into the mix.  Altogether, I added a cup of my pumpkin/banana mixture.  It adds really nice flavor!

My little girls and I have made this recipe several times over the last few years! We love it! However, I did make just a few minor changes. I use whole wheat for half of the flour and I use coconut oil instead of veg oil (its healthier). I also cut the sugar in about half and use a whole can of pumpkin. LOVE! And they dont last long. :)

Easy recipe that was quick to make.  I chose this recipe because it had the least amount of oil.  I used all organic ingredients except the oil and they came out very nicely.  Some reviewers stated that they were bland.  I do not like muffins to be sweet; they are not supposed to be cupcakes.  I liked the flavor, and did not find them bland at all; rather they had a level of flavor I would expect from a muffin.  I am not a fan of chocolate, so I would have preferred them without the chocolate.  I made them for other people, so the chocolate had to stay.  I would make them again, only with walnuts for myself.

The only difference I made to this recipe is I split a third of a 29 ounce can of pumpkin. It tastes great with just the right texture. Next time I may use less cloves or just omit it all together.

Yum! This is such a perfect start for holiday baking! Very easy and full of spices. It taste like a pumpkin pie but in a muffin. I made this twice. Once with the chocolate chips and once without. It tasted great both times!

I made these for thanksgiving breakfast with chocolate chips, and then made it again without chocolate chips. I do like chocolate, but it made the muffins ultra rich. I'll make them again, but not in the very near future.

I'm really pleased with how these turned out. I did make some slight modifications. I used 1 cup pumpkin puree (trying to use up what I had open,) and I was out of cinnamon so I only used Pumpkin Pie spice. Additionally, since I used extra puree, I used 3/4 teaspoons additional spice than what is listed in the recipe. Finally, I used brown sugar and also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. They were simple to make and bake quickly.

This turned out great....was unsure at first with the chocolate and pumpkin mix.  I did add 3/4 cup chocolate chips, instead of 1/2 cup and a full tsp of cinnamon, instead of 1/2 tsp to dance with the chocolate chips.  Am already making my 2nd batch !  Thanks !

This recipe was fabulous. I altered the recipe so my grandson, who cannot have dairy or wheat, was able to eat it, and he loved it. I used dairy-free chocolate chips and non-gluten flour plus 3/4 tsp of xanthum gum, plus an extra 1/4 tsp baking powder, and everything was terrific!

I doubled the recipe which made 3 loaves instead of muffins. I found the heat too high though.  With the loaves I baked 250 for about 40 minutes.  The last 15 I covered lightly with aluminum foil so stop browning too much. Great taste!

Awesome!  I always try to stick to the original recipe whenever I'm trying it for the first time.  But I admit, I did sub water with buttermilk like another viewer suggested.  I also did half chocolate chips and half cinnamon chips (Hershey).  I made toppings for mine too because the tops weren't very moist when they were done baking.  Please check out my facebook page with photos of the finished product.  www.facebook.com/curvycupcakes.  This recipe is easy and the finished product is yummilicious!

These are so easy and delicious!! We made them according to the recipe, other than a few extra chocolate chips (they spilled from the bag). We'll definitely make them again.

Loved the muffins!  I made two batches and with the first I used the paper cups.  The muffins stuck to them so the second batch I greased and floured the muffin pan and they came out beautifully.

I thought these were easy, tasty and were nice and moist. After reading other reviews I added more pumpkin and spice and they turned out great.  My 5 & 6 year old's loved them.

My boys LOVED these.  We subbed dark chocolate for the semi-sweet.  The only comment/change would be to add a little more pumpkin because the pumpkin flavor was a little weak.  That being said, my little guys each ate 3 in one sitting.  That says a lot! ;o)  Enjoy!

I added the extra pumpkin and upped the spices just like chibi chef did and the flavor turned out great. I also tossed in some chopped walnuts and some extra chocolate chips. 
Also, 400 degrees at 20 minutes was far too much. The bottoms are nearly burnt and the chocolate near the bottom did burn. The centers taste good though.

4 stars only because I changed it a little - good basic recipe. Changes - 1.5tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices as above; 3/4 cup packed brown sugar (as other reviewers suggested - thanks!) instead of white sugar; 1 cup canned pumpkin instead of 3/4 cup. I made 7 plain muffins (with powdered sugar icing), and 5 chocolate chip muffins, which I will make more of next time. Yield 12 muffins. Yummy!

My preschooler had a huge craving for pumpkin muffins this morning and was on a mission to get them made. Luckily I had some pumpkin! I used coconut oil instead of veg oil and gluten free flour instead of all purpose flour. I didn't add any chocolate chips either, since my preschooler had pumpkin muffins at school yesterday without the chips and liked it. I also didn't have a full cup of pumpkin, so I added a bit of sweet potato puree to make it one cup. Turned out good!

Love this muffin!  I did exchange the white sugar for brown sugar.  I reserved a few chocolate chips to drop on the top of the muffins before baking.  This way I had chocolate chips on top, and not all falling down into the batter.  Yummy!

I rated this only 3 stars because I did not find the batter flavorful enough, so I made some adjustments.  I doubled the batch and used half brown sugar; I used 2-1/2 cups flour and 1 cup of oatmeal, which created a wonderful texture and added fiber; I used generous measures of spices.  It still wasn't quite right, so I added 1/4 cup of molasses to the batter and then it tasted great.  I then baked at 375 for 25 minutes (probably would have been better at 22 or 23 minutes).  Good recipe base, but better when altered.

Oh My These are so good. The only change i made was to use a little more pumpkin and replace oil with apple sauce and used 1/2 cup of king arthur white whole wheat flour. Delicious. Next time i will double the recipe because i had to make them 3 times in 1 week.

These muffins are delicious!! I have made them a couple of times now... the first time I followed the recipe exactly and the second time I didn't have semisweet chocolate chips so I used white chocolate chips instead... they were actually really good! My husband said he preferred them with the white chocolate chips. If I eat a muffin after it's cooled then I like to heat it in the microwave for about 5-10 seconds to melt the chocolate and moisten the muffin.

Great recipe, although I think the flavors are better suited for white chocolate chips or caramel toffee bits. I upped the spices and decreased the oil. They were perfect!

As others have said, this recipe is a bit bland and could stand a few substitutions but it's a keeper once you find out how you best like it!  It's definitely an EASY and fast recipe and makes the house smell wonderful!  As for substitutions, I, too recommend using brown sugar instead of white, applesauce instead of oil and perhaps some vanilla extract and more spices, more pumpkin.  This is actually great with a little cream cheese on top and  a cup of coffee on the side.  (By the way, I used mini choco chips and found that they were just big enough!)  Happy Baking!

Very good recipe! I add pumpkin pie spice instead of all the spices separately and it comes out great. One suggestion that I would make is to use mini chocolate chips instead of the normal sized ones, it comes out better.

I made this muffins for the first time today, and my husband loved them. We just had one with a cup of coffee, but I'm freezing the rest to take out during the holidays. AS recommended by other reviews, I used brown sugar instead of white. I thought the combination of spices was perfect, giving the muffins are very "autumn" flavor. I got 16 muffins out of the batch. Next time I'll try peanut butter morsels instead of choc. ones.

These were so yummy! Only changes I made were using around 1 cup of chocolate chips and replaced 1 cup of the AP flour with whole wheat flour. I also made these into mini muffins. We loved them.

This is a great recipe! I substituted the canned pumpkin for 1 cup of fresh pumpkin which I cooked in the micro for 15 min on high. I used the blender and a bit of water to make a purée and strained it through cloth. I also added a little cube of cream cheese in the middle. They turned out really moist.

The muffins were good, but for me I would have liked a little more pumpkin spice. They tasted really good when they were warm with a little butter. YUM. Thanks for submitting the recipe.

These are by far the best muffins I have ever made. Perfect texture and flavor.  Double the recipe to make two dozen...you can freeze them (but probably won't need to!). I used cinnamon burst chips instead of chocolate chip, because that's what I had on hand, but also because my husband doesn't love chocolate. Also, I used 2 cups of fresh pumpkin puree (for the double recipe) and did NOT use any extra water. They came out moist and dense...perfect!I added a dash of ginger and I also used 1 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup light brown...I always feel a little brown sugar works well with these spicy kinds of recipes. Thanks for sharing...there were so many recipes on here and I am SO glad I chose this one!

5+ stars. My co-workers loved them. I did use 1/2 cup brown and 1/4 white sugar. Instead of water, I used Vanilla Silk Pure Coconutmilk. I make my own Pumpkin Pie Spice which has cardamom, I think that gives it just the extra kick of flavor. I didn't have enough semisweet so I threw in some walnuts. For the flour I used 1 cup of WW Pastry & 1/2 all purpose. I also think they would have been overcooked at the specified time/temp so I cooked at 375 for about 18 minutes. Loved them! Even better straight out of the fridge the next morning.

I loved the texture of these muffins....  I made them in mini-muffin cups for an easy grab and go snack for the kiddos...  Baked at 375 for 13 minutes and they were perfect.  I also substitued cranberries for the chocolate chips.  Delicious.  Will make again!

Something's missing!  I followed the recipe exactly but was disappointed that these are not very "pumpkin-y" and sort of bland.  The texture though is perfect.  If you just want a very mild pumpkin muffin, this is a good one for you. I think I'm just going to find a good pumpkin bread recipe and put it in a muffin tin.

These were quite bland for my family's tastes-but we tend to like quite a bit of spice.  We didn't care for the chocolate/pumpkin flavor combination either (but again- that's just us). 

Next time I'd use brown sugar instead of white, use walnuts instead of chocolate chips, double the spices and maybe add in some cardamom or ginger...but then I guess they'd have to be called, "Spiced Pumpkin Nut Muffins"-not "Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins."  :)

I substituted quite a few ingredients to reflect my pantry.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat pastry flour, 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and 1/2 cup of wheat germ in place of the white flour.  I used brown sugar instead of white and added a little ground ginger for extra spice since I was low on cinnamon.  I also had no chocolate chips so I sprinkled the tops with dried cranberries and toasted slivered almonds.  They came out really well!  I can only assume that this recipe is excellent as written.  Thank you for sharing!

I also altered the recipe using a jar of pumpkin butter instead of canned pumpkin. I lessened the sugar to 1/3 cup and added 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice with 1 tsp of vanilla. Came out very tasty. Great after school snack!

Good muffins, overall. Made them exactly as called for except mini chips instead of regular. They looked beautiful and were done all the way through at 23 minutes. Hubby loved them, but I thought they needed more spice. Will try doubling the nutmeg and cinnamon next time. Also interested to try the applesauce version.

So good..even to my picky 4 and 2 year olds.  They even helped to make...applesauce instead of oil, increased to 1 C of pumpkin, used mini chips and pumkin spice instead of nutmeg and cloves.  Made mini muffins cooked at 275 for only about 10 minutes.  Great adaptation suggestions from others!

Great muffins! I used fresh pumpkin and didn't add the water because my pumpkin was a little watery anyway. I took the advice of others and upped the amount of spices and pumpkin. I used golden raisins instead of chocolate chips and they turned out delicious! Would definitely make again!

Really Good! I eat clean but with a couple of substitutions it was perfect. I used 3/8c agave syrup, and applesauce in place of the oil, whole wheat pastry flour and No Water. The agave syrup is all you need. I also added a pinch of Ginger it was really good and a health treat.

I made these low fat and sugar free by substituting the sugar with Splenda and the 1/4 cup of oil for 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce...also only used one egg plus 2 egg whites...very moist and flavorful ...careful not to over cook them as they will dry out easily...17-18 min in my oven was plenty.

These turned out PERFECT! So yummy!!!! So fluffy and moist!  Here are the changes I made: I used 1 cup brown sugar instead of the 3/4 white sugar. I used 1 cup pumpkin instead of 3/4 cup. I mixed the chocoloate chips in with the dry ingrediants (it helps all of the chips to not sink to the bottom). I added 1/4 tbs pumpkin pie seasoning. I liberally sprayed the tins with Pam, and they literally slid right out after they baked, nothing stuck! I also sprinkled a little ground cinnamon on top before I baked them, then I cooked it at 370* for 20 min and they are literally perfect! I topped each one off with a chocolate chip!

Delicious! I love this combination of the spicy pumpkin with just a bit of chocolate.  These muffins stirred up fast and came out moist, with a little bit of a crunch to the muffin tops, which we enjoy.

Ok, so here's what I did, after reading everyone's reviews: I used unsweetened applesauce in place of oil, which I definitely recommend. I used the whole can of pumpkin and all the spices as written, adding 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice. I "wet down" the chocolate chips before adding them, and I did *not* use paper liners. Finally, I baked the muffins at 375 degrees for exactly 20 minutes. I've already made 6 batches of these for upcoming T-giving events-- love them! They're moist with a great texture.

Very good recipe. Made slight changes as recommended in the reviews; Used homemade pumpkin puree, 1 C sugar (although I think 3/4 C would have been good since the chocolate chips add sweetness), 1/8 tsp ground cloves and added 1/8 tsp ground ginger. Will use more chocolate chips (3/4 C - 1 C) next time.

Very good starter recipe! Here are the changes I ended up making to fit my taste:  1 cup sugar (instead of 3/4 cup)  1 cup fresh pumpkin puree (instead of 3/4 cup canned)  1 and 1/2 tsp water (fresh pumpkin naturally has a high water content)  1 tsp All Spice (and nothing else)  A touch more chocolate chips, but not quite 3/4 cup  Bake at 375 instead of 400 for 15 minutes    With those changes, they turned out perfect for me. The first batch I tried, I made with the recommended changes from Chibi Chef - bad move (for us anyway). talk about over powering spices! Mine and my husband's tongues were numb from the insane amounts of nutmeg and clove. I should have known better because nutmeg and clove are strong spices on    their own. So anyway, I do not recommend altering the spices to that extent. It's way too extreme and totally takes away from the pumpkin. You end up with Chocolate Chip Clove muffins! Anyway, this is a really good recipe. Maybe next time I'll try white chocolate chips or cranberries and walnuts - YUM!

What great muffins! I made these for my Brownie troop and the girls LOVED them. I followed the advice of other reviews and lowered the oven temp to 350', & increased the amount of pumpkin and substituted brown sugar for the white. I substituted some whole wheat flour in an attempt to make it healthier. This was a very popular treat and yet was totally new compared to our usual snacks. I'll definitely be making this again...and again...and again!

Very good recipe, especially for those weeks before Halloween! I took tips from previous reviews, such as substituting brown for white sugar, and doubling the 3 spices. Instead of mixing choc chips in with the mix, i added a few to the tops of the muffins just before baking them (alternating with chopped walnuts too).

Good muffins, but nothing earthshaking. I used more pumpkin than the recipe called for for added flavour and moisture. Recipe is also good without the chocolate chips, but with a cream cheese icing on the top instead.

These are wonderful, and I even used applesauce instead of the oil.  They are moist, and the kids love the chocolate chip addition.  I used mini chips, so there is a little bit of chocolate in every bite.  Great as an after school snack anytime of the year!

Very bland even though I added additional pumpkin pie spice on top of the spices called for in the recipe.  I would recommend 1 tsp or more of pumpkin pie spice.  These definitely have potential and the texture is great.

did what others said by adding extra pumpkin & spices and brown sugar to replace white.  Still came out bland so I frosted with cream cheese frosting from "clone of cinnabon" recipe.  This added enough extra flavor it was fantastic!

I liked the flavor of these.  I used a whole can of packed pumpkin (because I didn't know what to do with the extra).  They could have rised a bit more for my taste.  I also doubled the chocolate chips. My kids told me FIVE STARS.

Wow! These are great! I ran out of white sugar while measuring so I used 1/2 cup white sugar + 1/4 cup light brown sugar. I added about a palmful extra chocolate chips. They are so fluffy and moist with a subtle (but definitely noticeable) pumpkin flavor. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved these, I did double the pumpkin and added a bit of allspice and I think I ate almost all of these by myself. Not overly sweet which was really nice.

These muffins were perfect when it comes to moisture. They were sweet, but not too sweet, which is why they became such a big hit for my family. They were perfect to eat anytime! Plan to use recipe every year around the holidays

I made this for coffee after thanksgiving dinner. They were wonderful! They tasted professionally made and baked simply perfect. They lasted even the week after and tastes fresh out of the oven when we just reheated them in the microwave. One of my new go to recipes.

These taste great for a muffin.  Not too sweet, just right.  I did use the brown sugar instead of white sugar like some recommended.  I also used 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice like someone noted.  Not bland at all.  I am going to make some cream cheese glaze for the top.

These were okay. the chocolate chips didn't seem to belong. I made half with, half without. I substituted applesauce for the oil like other members. I wish I didn't do that. They turned out a bit chewy.

Everyone loves these. I definitely would make these again.  The recipe was pretty simple.   I didn't have nutmeg on hand, so I substituted Ginger which made them spicy and I used milk instead of water.  I made little muffins so that people would not feel bad for reaching for another one.

Made two batches this weekend- one for a party and the other for my husband and I.  Came out great both times, and I'm not even a huge pumpkin fan!  My husband just told me that this may be his favorite thing I've ever made (granted, we haven't been married for 6 months yet, but still!)

Very good! I made the recipe mostly as stated, just substituted brown sugar for white, increased the spices about 50% and baked at 375 for 20 minutes. Also did the trick from another reviewer of moistening the chocolate chips and throwing them in with the dry mixture to keep them from sinking to the bottom.

Delicious!  I did tweak it with the suggestions that others had made (applesauce instead of oil, more pumpkin and more spices), and used mini chocolate chips.  My kids loved them too.  Thanks!

These were really good muffins but I added about 3/4 of a bag of chocolate chips and that was way too much. I will go with 1 cup next time. I also added 1 cup of pumpkin and extra cinnamon and nutmeg. They came out moist and delicious. Overall, great recipe, very easy to make. Yummy!

Really good recipe, I didn't have all the spices on hand, but had the Pumpkin Pie Spice, substituted brown sugar for the white sugar, and increased the pumpkin to 1 cup!  I also doubled the batch and did a test.  I made half plain and the other half with a big handful of cocunut!  WOW- delicious dessert muffin that would pair nicely with a warm cup of coffee in front of the fire place with a good book!

I made these exactly as called for and they were perfect. Moist just the right amount of pumpkin the only thing I might change is add a little more pumpkin and a little less chocolate chip but either way they were amazing and I got nothing but good reviews on them! Definitely will be making these again

Very tasty muffins, my only issue is that they are sticking to the papers when I try to unwrap them! Good pumpkin flavor and good ratio of chocolate chips. I cut back a little on the cloves and nutmeg because I tend to find them overpowering, used more like 1/8 tsp. instead of 1/4. I also used mini chocolate chips and made mini muffins, baking for 13-14 minutes. Will definitely make these again.

These were pretty good. Not the best I've ever had. I feel like they needed to be a little sweeter, and a little less dense.  I'm not really sure how to achieve that though.    These are the changes I made: a full cup of pumpkin, a heaping tsp of pumpkin pie seasoning instead of all the spices, substituted light brown sugar for white, substituted half a cup of whole wheat flour for half cup of the all purpose flour, and used about 3/4 cup of mini choc chips.  Perhaps I'll try to make this as written next time to see if I get a fluffier muffin.

Pretty darn good. I did end up doubling the cinnamon, and using a full cup of pumpkin. I also used 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips, which I feel are perfect and don't overpower the pumpkin flavor.

THis recipe is very good. All of my children love it! The first time I made them I did exactly what the recipe said and they were good. The second time I added more pumpkin (1/2 cup) and doubled the spices. They came out better...more fluffier and moister. This recipe is a keeper.

Love these muffins! I did make a few changes as per other reviews. I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup and the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I also added more chocolate chips. Cooked at 375 for 20 minutes and they came out perfect! I think 400 would be too hot to cook for 20 minutes.

Very yummy and quite easy. Needs a little more spice, next time I will add more cinnamon & nutmeg. This recipe made about 40 mini muffins, baked for 15 minutes.

I'm a muffin baking momma this month, and I think I just found my favorite muffin.  I love these!  My only substitution was using pumpkin pie spice in lieu of the individually called for spices.  Just delicious!

I modified the recipe since I'm a chocolate addict (sorry!). I use 1c sugar, 1/2c unsweetened cocoa, no spices and no choc chips. The result.. Whoaaa..I'm in heaven..very chocolate-y. Just use pumpkin for moistness. I don't know what went wrong but the muffin was a bit fudgy at the top but a bit dry at the bottom. Overall, yummy!!

At work, they called these my crack muffins, because they were addictive. And the first one is free, and you can't eat just one. I recommend doubling or tripling the recipe so you can bring some to work or give some away and amaze your friends.

WOW! This was delicious and a favorite with the whole family. I did use whole wheat flour and made mini muffins using mini chocolate chip morsels. It turned out so moist and adding the cream cheese frosting is a must.

Awesome!!!!!  I made changes suggested by someone on this site.  I used a cup of pumpkin and brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I increased the spices and omitted cloves.  My husband doesn't even care for muffins and he couldn't stay away from them.  Great recipe...thanks.

These muffins were amazing! They are especially good if you add 1/4 cup butterscotch chips to them They do rise a lot in the oven, so only fill the tins 2/3 the way full Will definitely make again

These muffins were awesome! I took all the previous suggestions (brown sugar, more pumpkin and spices, bake at 350 etc) and they were fabulously moist and super tasty. I will make these again for sure!

Reviewers are right, the pumpkin taste is way too subtle.  I used white chocolate chips to add a bit more sweetness to the muffins but it still didn't help much.  Next time, I will have to add more pumpkin and try some of the other reviewers' suggestions.

These are pretty good, with a few modifications.  Based on several reviews, I used brown sugar instead of white, increased the pumpkin to 1 cup, and doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also dusted the chocolate chips with flour prior to mixing them in and they stayed distributed throughout the muffins very nicely.  The muffins were very moist and tasted pretty good, but still the tiniest bit bland.  I think next time I'll increase the cinnamon and nutmeg to 3 times the amount called for.  Overall a good recipe with just the tiniest bit of tweaking!

Very delicious muffins. I followed others' suggestions and used brown sugar instead of white, increased spices, and used 1 cup pumpkin. Also used dark chocolate chips. Next time I will use less chocolate but overall a tasty fall treat.

I adjusted this recipe to make it gluten free.   (I used rice, potato and garbanzo flour and added 2 tsp xanthum gum) everything else I kept as.  They were fantastic...my husband did not even know they were gluten free when he raved about them.

After reading everyone's reviews, I made the following changes for a more healthful and flavorful muffin: 1/4 cup white Splenda, 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar (will use brown Splenda next time); applesauce instead of oil; 1 cup pumpkin; omit water; 1 cup wheat flour, 1/2 cup all-purpose flour; 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice; 1 cup mini choc. chips. Made exactly 12. Shape is kind of lumpy. Delicious, moist, and flavorful! Gone in 2 days by 2 people!

These were really good. The pumpkin and chocolate mix was actually quite interesting. My brother is allergic to wheat, so I used gluten-free all purpose baking flour. I also used brown sugar, and lots of vanilla. I topped them with "Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" and chopped walnuts! Yum Yum

Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!  These are really good!!  I added about a cup of chocolate chips, so they were pretty chocolately, but yummy nonetheless!  I didn't have ground cloves, so I added extra cinnamon.

Pretty good!  I tripled the recipe.  I used 3/4c. white sugar and 1 1/2c. brown sugar, 1/4c. vegetable oil and 1/2c. applesauce, and a 29oz. can of pumpkin.  I didn't use any cloves.  I used 2t. of cinnamon, 1/2t. of nutmeg, and 1t. pumpkin pie spice.  I also added 2t. of vanilla.  I did not use chocolate chips, but next time I will try cinnamon chips.  I used a cookie dough scoop to fill the muffin cups.  I used 1 scoop for the mini muffins and 2 1/2 scoops for the regular.  I sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar.  The batch made 24 mini muffins (baked for 11 min.) and 24 regular muffins (baked for 20min).  We are still eating them warm with butter!  Very nice!

These came out great! I did follow some of the other reviewers advice and tried 1 cup pumpkin puree and substitued light brown sugar instead of the white.  I also upped the spices to 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and ground cloves. They turned out really moist and everyone loved them!

I made these muffins with some of the changes other people recommended -- light brown sugar for the sugar and doubled the cinnamin and ground nutmeg and left out the ground cloves.  I made them into mini muffins for 12 minutes and it made 6 dozen!  My husband and kids loved them!  I would definitely make these again!

I just used this recipe yesterday, and it turned out fantastic!  I did take the advice of previous reviews and substituted 1/2 the white sguar content for brown sugar, and also used 1 Cup of Pumpkin rather than 3/4.  I made full size muffins, and they turned out perfect and moist at 20 minutes in the center of the oven.  Thank you for the great recipe!

These were great! I also changed the recipe, but found it a super simple base from which to get creative. Changes: fresh pumpkin strained and pureed, no chocolate but adding cranberry compote and orange juice (left out half the sugar as well) plus freshly toasted and crumbled walnuts. I guess this changes the recipe more than I realized hmm... hope I can recreate it since it was a huge hit! Cheers from a Texan gal living in Holland

These are amazing.  I did follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and used a full cup of pumpkin and brown sugar in lieu of white.  I added 3/4 cup of milk chocolate chips and have made them as full size and mini.  The mini only took 10 minutes to cook and are the perfect size for little ones.

This recipe is a winner!

Delicious!  The pumpkin flavor is not overwhelming.  My kids even liked them.  I used regular chocolate chips and they sunk to the bottom, so miniature chips would probably work better the next time I make them.

Used the applesauce and extra spices as others suggested.  I freeze my chocolate chips so they remain more chiplike.  Made them for Halloween and they smelled and tasted great!

These muffins were great, I will be making them again. I used a mini muffin tin and added frosting (1/2 cup butter, 8oz. cream cheese, 3 cups powdered sugar 1/2 teaspoon almond extract, and 1/4 cup heavy cream). They didn't even last the night, wow.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  The muffins lacked the super-moist texture I expect from pumpkin muffins and the flavor of the pumpkin really didn't come through either.  My picky toddler liked them though and my husband said they were fine. They are fine as far as muffins go, but they didn't really taste like a pumpkin muffin to me.

I really loved these Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins. I always try to reduce the fat and sugar content, and it was easy with this recipe. I gave some to my family and they, took realllly liked them  !!!  Pumpkin is so good for you, too, so it will be my "healthy" muffins in the future !!  I used the mini chips the first time, but one can also use the dark chocolate chips, also, I bet !!  You can use applesauce for the oil and "egg substitute" for the eggs. It works !!!

These were awesome!  I made them for my MOMS group and they disapeared, I'm glad I made 2 dozen!  The moms and kids just loved them!  I used whole wheat flour, and half brown sugar and left out the nutmeg.  But they are wonderful, I will be making them again and again!  My 8 year old son said "Mom, these are the BEST muffins ever!  They might be my new favorite food!"

I thought that the original recipe was pretty good but the second time I modified it and liked it alot more (plus it was healthier).

I substituted white sugar for brown sugar,  I used whole wheat flour instead of white,  I used an egg substitute instead of the eggs (2 T flax seeds blended with 6 T water for 3 minutes)  I also added some walnuts.  I also made both muffins and bread out of each batch and the bread was excellent!

Wow! These are delicious! My ten month old daughter and I absolutely loved them. The texture is great-very moist, and the spices are just right. I did take the suggestion to bake at 350 degrees rather than 400. And, I just added half a can of pumpkin, instead of measuring it out. Worth the time to make!

The rating among the seven of us ranged from 3 to 5. I would, if I were you, try the recipe as written before adjusting, since some family members thought it was too spicy and some not spicy enough. We made mini-muffins with mini-chips and baked to perfection for 10 minutes. Moistness was fine as written. Tasty way to use up the pumpkin puree in the freezer from Thanksgiving! Recipe yielded nearly 24 mini-muffins. Recipe prepared by supervised 6-year-old.

These were really great, very moist.  Although they taste great w/ the chocolate chips, I think I might make them again w/out the chips.  I used applesauce instead of oil, & brown sugar instead of white.  And I was also very generous when adding the pumpkin, added alittle more then i was supossed to.

Very good and tasty, I used chopped white chocolate and the result was very moist and elegant looking. I also followed the recommendation to use evaporated milk instead of water and I think the next time I will use water, they were a little too sticky at first, six hours later they were ok.

These were simply scrumptious.  I doubled the recipe and I added an entire 15 oz can of pumpkin.  Once cooled, I topped them with cream cheese frosting. Very good and simple to bake.

These muffins were okay.  I made them exactly as the recipe states except I left out the nutmeg (we don't like it).  Most of the flavor came from the chocolate chips, otherwise they were a bit bland.  The consistency was fine and once they cooled completely, they came out of the muffin papers nicely.  I've made many muffin recipes and this is one of my least favorites when it comes to taste.  If I make them again, I'd probably add more sugar and more cinnamon to see if that helps the flavor.

These are wonderful.  I used pumpkin pie spice because that is what I had on hand.  I used mini chips so the chocolate wasn't over powering.  My children loved them as did the neighbors.  They are great the next day split open, toasted with some margarine.  Yum!!

These are excellent.  With the full cup of chips, they are moist and rich.  My seven-year-old saw my muffin pan and asked when I was going to make chocolate chip muffins.  He then informed me that second-graders really liked them.  I hadn't realized I had been so neglectful.  So, I went in search of a good recipe.  My son hung around in the kitchen until the muffins came out and dug in as soon as they were cool enough.  After his first one, I asked how he liked them.  he gave me a chocolate-faced grin and two thumbs up.

Wonderful muffins, I used more ground cinnamon(2tsp)  and instead of white flour I used whole wheat flour, and also, in place of the eggs, I used ener-g egg , a egg replacer and because of this increased the liquid content by 1/4 of a cup . Very tasty and moist.Thank's for sharing! :)

Made these for my husband as I am not a pumpkin fan.  They actually aren't bad.  I tripled the recipe as I make my own canned pumpkin and had 3 cups worth and used it all.  I substituted 2c brown sugar for white (didn't have any) 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp each clove and nutmeg as we both like a lot of spice.  Half I made with chocolate chips and other half without.  Good both ways for those calorie counters.  Filled muffins tins to top and it made 23 muffins.

Great muffins! They are very moist and taste even better the next day.  It's a good idea to double the recipe because they will go fast, but also to keep from throwing away the extra half can of pumpkin.

Great recipe.  I was looking for a pumpkin recipe so I could substitute some butternut sqush.  I had way too much left over from veggie co op.  So, I used Butternut squash instead of pumpkin and threw in extra chocolate chips (love chocolate).  Oh, I also used Splenda instead of sugar.  They did stick to the paper muffin cups, next time will just spray the muffin tin.
Kids loved them!

These were very good...My MIL LOVED them and wanted the recipe and now she always says that is the best muffin she has ever tasted. I followed the recipe except added pumpkin pie spice as well. Will make again. Thanks!

The first time I made these, I thought they were okay. I didn't care for the pumpkin/chocolate combination; it was a little odd. I decided to make them again and this time I substituted white chocolate chips for the semi-sweet and added some chopped walnuts. I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the other spices. These came out fantastic this time around! Everyone loves them! This is a great recipe and easy to play with to suit your taste.

This is definitely not my family's favorite muffin recipe.  I picked it because it was rated so high, but was very disappointed with the results.  5 stars = "the best" ... this is not the best!

These muffins were delicious!  I used mini chocolate chips, 1/2 cup, but that's the only change I made.  I didn't tell my picky 8 year old what was in them, and he actually ate one, requested one for school, then had one as a snack!  It's a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe.

i'm not a fan of pumpkin pie, but i love these muffins!  i substituted apple sauce for the oil, used 1/2c brown sugar and a 1/4c white sugar, and doubled the cinnamon and chocolate chips.  i bought a can of pumpkin and used half of it for the recipe, wondering if i would like it.  fifteen minutes after these came out of the oven, i used the other half of the can making another batch!!!  i'm so glad to have an autumnal recipe that makes our house smell like pumpkin pie (which my husband loves) and i can still enjoy eating the treats!

These muffins are wonderful. I hemmed and hawed about the chocolate chips, and wondered about substituting raisins or walnuts but I am so glad I didn't. The chocolate chip - pumpkin combo is excellent.

I just made these the other night and could not believe how good these were! The combination is a bit strange and hard to imagine what it might taste like, but it works! The only change I made was that I had "Guittard"(the best chocolate chips) milk chocolate chips on hand instead of semisweet. It was so good! Thank you Donna for the unusual but wonderful recipe!

Without realizing it I used canned pumpkin pie mix (already has spices,eggs,etc. in it) instead of just pumpkin. Doubled the recipe, used brown sugar instead of white, bumped up spices a bit and an extra handful of chocolate chips. These were wonderful and this recipe is definitely a "keeper". Thanks,Donna!

These were amazing! Indeed they were "moist and delicious muffins."  I'm going to make another batch tonight.  We used fresh pureed pumpkin, not canned.  They were sweet enough and had lots of flavour without having to add lots of chocolate chips.

These muffins were good, but not as light as I expected them to be.  I doubled the recipe and used coconut oil instead of veg. oil and I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  I am glad I made the double batch because they are being eaten quickly.  The only thing I wish is that the pumpkin flavor was stronger.

Really wonderful! My dad and boyfriend couldn't stop eating them and I couldn't eat less than three in one sitting. I added more spices, and I used Ener-G egg replacer instead of eggs. I also completely substituted the wheat flour for spelt flour and it was just as good, if not better!

Make this one! It feels like Autumn now!

Thse muffins are quite tasty, but I don't think they're as spectacular as everyone else has made them out to be. Maybe my mom just had a really good recipe for these when I was younger.

Everyone thought I was weird when I told them I made pumpkin chocolate chip muffins ("what a bizarre combination" they told me). Yet strangely, they got eaten up in no time. The only tip I have to give is if you are using paper liners for your muffins, wait until they are completely cooled before eating them otherwise they stick to the liners and you lose half the muffin.

These ROCK!!!!
I only had one egg, and decided to give it a go anyway.  We didn't even miss that egg!  Absolutely fabulous.  Ended up with 12 small/medium sized muffins plus 12 mini muffins.
I skipped the nutmeg and cloves to keep the flavor mild for the kids, and sprinkled sliced almonds over the batter in the muffin cups before baking--gives it a nice decorative touch, and a bit of crunch to keep it interesting!

I replaced the flour with whole wheat and for a vegan option, used ground-flax seeds instead of eggs.  With a little extra baking powder, they rose perfectly and tasted great.  I would definitely make these again.

I love this recipe.It is one of my "standards" and I have made it many many times since I discovered it here in November.  The chocolate chips add just enough "uumph".   The muffins stay moist for several days;beyond that it doesn't matter because they have been gobbled up. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

These were okay, but my family found them to be rather dull and bland.  I agree with the others that their just isn't enough pumpkin flavor, and I thought they could use more spice flavor.  Merely mediocre muffin.

I just made these muffins tonight and thought they were excellent!!  I used about 1 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice as other reviewers had suggested in place of the other spices.  I will definitely be making these again soon!

I made three batches last night trying to perfect this recipe. I first tried substituting applesauce for the vegetable oil, but the final texture was spongy and weird. It also didn't have enough spice for me. Next batch I used vegetable oil and added more cinnamon and nutmeg. Yummy flavor and better texture. The final batch, I used brown sugar instead of white. Perfect! I'm going to make more -- gotta finish that huge can of pumpkin.

Love this recipe!  I use applesauce and EggBeaters in place of the oil and eggs to make it lower fat and it is wonderful!  I also use Pumpkin Pie Spice in place of the cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  Yummy- a favorite by everyone in my family!

I was really dissapointed with these.  They weren't bad, but they were just lacking somehow.  There was definitely not enough pumpkin flavor, and I wish I had just stuck with pumpkin pie spice.  I would not try this recipe again.

I could not have found this recipe at a more perfect time!! While on a VERY late-night baking spree to make muffins for selling at the farmer's market the next morning, I was browsing for a normal chocloate chip muffin recipe to try. Instead, I found this, and the idea of using pumpkin seemed perfect. Earlier in the day, a can of pumpkin had rolled from my cabinet as I put away groceries... an omen? The weather had been unseasonably cool here in Tennessee (in the 70s instead of in the 90s as it usually is in August), and it feels just like October. The thought of offering pumpkin muffins in the cool of the morning during the farmer's market was very appealing. 

And eating one warm from the oven was wonderful... perfect, even. I actually spoke aloud to myself (at 1:30 am, mind you), "Wow, these are terrific." The only change that I made was adding more spices, because I love the smell and taste of a very nutmeggy, cinnamony, clovey pumpkin product. 

I sold several at the market, and they did seem to appeal to those who also felt the tinge of autumn. In fact, I sold more pumpkin chocolate chip muffins than I did of the other two flavors, blueberry and apple-cinnamon. And as I gave the remaining two to my mother ans sister afterward, I could see their tangible joy at taking a bite of fall in August. 

Thanks for the great recipe!

My guests really liked these, but I thought that they could use more spice. I made 24 mini-muffins and baked them for 19 minutes. These were very easy to make though.

These muffins are very tasty...however, I thought the chocolate chips overpowered the pumpkin taste. Next time I will decrease the amount of chocolate. Good recipe!

Wow!  These muffins are so yummy!  I left out the nutmeg, because my husband strongly dislikes it.  I found that milk chocolate chips work just as well as semi-sweet chocolate chips, and I had no trouble using liquid egg substitute in place of eggs.  I will definitely make these again and again!

Absolutely wonderful.  They have that special pumpkin flavor I've been looking for...sweet, spicy, moist.  The chocolate chips are the perfect match.  These are great!

This muffin is full of pumpkin flavor, the spices and the chocolate chips make it a favorite in my house. I agree, it is a very moist muffin, best eaten hot out of the oven. My 3 year old son asks to make these delicious muffins every week!

These are my favorite go-to pancakes for family and guests. Converted them to Gluten-free by substituting flour with coconut flour. Quick tip I was able to buy coconut flour in the bulk foods at Sprouts rather than having to by a whole bag  of gluten-free flour which can be pricey.  Top with cinnamon apples.  Yummmmm.!!!

These were just ok IMO. I didn’t have any chocolate chips and probably should have increased sugar to compensate.

Added extra pumpkin, salt, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, flour for high altitude,  swapped white for dark brown sugar, added vanilla, and swapped semisweet chips for a mixture of chopped bittersweet, semisweet, and milk chocolate. Fancier and more delicious.

I left out the chocolate chips and it was delicious. Perfect as is with coffee for us, or extra sweet with a buttercream frosting for the littles. I loved this recipe. I always indulge in extra spices, so I’m sure I did here too. Clove, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla, nutmeg, cardamom. Vanilla & cinnamon create a wonderful autumn aroma with the pumpkin.

This is a good recipe. Good flavors. I need to make sure I add more batter to the muffin liners. Just fell shy of what would be a more full muffin. That's on me, not the recipe. I will make these again..

My new favorite pumpkin recipe. Quicker to make than pumpkin bread!  Was a big hit!
Changes I think improved it:
- Upped it to 1 cup of pumpkin
- Didn't add the water 
- I sprinkle chocolate chips only on the top once batter is already in muffin tin. Makes a nice bite of chocolate followed by pumpkin flavor vs mixing chips into the batter. 
- Baked at lower temp. 375° F for 18 minutes comes out perfectly in my oven. Moist! I think 400° dries them out.

I made this and per other’s suggestions, added more pumpkin and spices. I doubled the recipe and also did brown sugar instead of white sugar, added an extra 1/4c pumpkin, and added an extra 1/2tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg. I would recommend adding more! The batter will smell flavorful but it comes out tasting flat. I also used regular chocolate chips and think mini would’ve been much better.

Extremely good recipe. One batch makes about 12 muffins (depends on tray). I'd advise swapping out the white sugar for brown sugar (equal proportions) and bake for about 25 minutes. Instead of the oil, I used butter, and being the idiot that I am, instead of using cups for the pumpkin, I did it by the can. Turned out VERY well and with a few more chocolate chips was the best muffin that I have ever had! Overall, a family favorite!

Followed other reviewers suggestions and the muffins came out SO perfectly. Subbed brown sugar instead of white, olive oil instead of vegetable oil and used a 1 cup of pumpkin... for spices, used 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp ginger and 3/4 tsp nutmeg.  Used mini chocolate chips and rolled them in flour before adding. Baked at 375 instead of 400 for 20 minutes.

I added a bit of ground flax-seed and baked them at 375 instead of at 400. Quite good.

These are really delicious. I have to admit I ate 4 before they had even completely cooled. I made some of the changes people suggested. I replaced the white sugar with 3/4 cup packed brown sugar, increased the pumpkin to 1 cup, doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg, and baked them at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. When I mixed them up they seemed a bit dry so I added a few tablespoons of apple sauce. Yummy!

Baked at 375 for 20 minutes. Muffins were over baked and stuck badly to the liners. I’ve always replaced apple sauce for oil but these muffins were dry as a bone, not recommended in this case

Made for a church event. To amp up the chocolate flavor I subbed 1/2 cup of the flour for cocoa powder and added 1 tsp of vanilla. Came out chocolatey with a hint of pumpkin. Yum!

I had the wet ingredients mixed when I read the recommendation for brown sugar.  Since I’d already added the white sugar, I just added a couple tablespoons of molasses. Came out fine. I agree with the reviewers who recommended adding more spices.

These were so good! I ended up making them again the next day :D. I followed some of the other reviews suggestions and changed the pumpkin to a full cup, doubling the spices (I just love it with extra flavor), and using brown sugar in place of regular sugar.

I had a recipe for pumpkin chocolate-chip muffins a couple years ago that I loved, and I have misplaced it .  I thought this might have been the same recipe, but it is not.  These were OK -- a bit drier than I would have liked, and the flavor was just so-so.  Not terrible, but nothing that would inspire me to make these again.

This Pumpkin muffin recipe outbeats others I've tried.  I increased the flour by 1/4th cup because I used the whole can of Pumpkin, I used 2 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of all the separate spices, cut back the sugar to 1/4 cup white sugar & 1/4 cup Brown sugar and finally added walnuts and raisins. Fantastic...excited to make this again.

Really enjoyed these. Used an entire cup of pumpkin, orange juice  in place of water, and for the spices: 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp each nutmeg and ginger. 400 for 20 minutes was perfect! thanks for the awesome recipe!

I've been making these for many years and was surprised that I hadn't left a review.  I do sub brown sugar for the white; use 1 cup of pumpkin; up the cinnamon to 1-1/4 tsp.; salt to 1/2 tsp.;   I use 1/2 tsp. ginger in place of nutmeg; and always use mini chocolate chips.  While I have made adjustments, the base recipe is a good one!  Thanks, Donna, for this wonderful recipe!

I am going to make these again once I buy nutmeg had to borrow some from kind neighbors. I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and did not add enough could not taste it. Also could not really taste the pumpkin. Lastly, I didn't use the cloves didn't have any and don't like them.

I read all the reviews and made one change, I did a double batch and I used 3/4 white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar. I did heap the spices since some people said it wasn't enough. They turned out moist and light and very delicious. I also used mini chocolate chips. the pumpkin flavor still came thru.

These were delicious. I added a little bit extra spice because someone said they were a bit bland. I used brown sugar instead of the white. Baking time 20 minutes at 400 degrees was right on. I will definitely make these again. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

I think it really could have used some more moisture. I'm thinking of maybe adding applesauce next time. I did add extra spices to it as a lot of the comments recommended and I think that helped a lot!

Love these! I did 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4. I used pumpkin pie spice since I didn’t have cloves and added cinnamon and nutmeg to taste, i like a lot of spice so I kept adding till the batter tasted how I wanted. I did a few with a salted sugar crumb topping and I wish I did this on all of them! So delicious! Definitely give these a try!

I used 1 cup pumpkin, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and instead of 3/4 cup white sugar, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. 

They turned out really well. I overmixed the wet and dry ingredients so they were kind of holey so I would watch out for that. They were also done at 18 minutes, and probably should have come out sooner so I would check them early and often. 

I'll definitely make them again! They were a big hit with everyone.

Easy, delicious, have turned out perfectly every time I've made them.  I double the recipe with no issues. These muffins stay fresh for days, and have been a family favorite for years.  Highly recommend!

Turned out great! Added twice as much pumpkin,a little more flour, and a pinch more spices. I also made them in mini form as to cut down the carbs. As a Type 1 diabetic, I’m always looking for lower carb treats...especially pumpkin!

I doubled the recipe to be able to use a full can of pumpkin. I used brown sugar as others recommended. I put in 2 loaf pans and baked at 350 for about 50 min.  My kids' eyes doubled in size as they ate it and we downed one loaf before it  had even cooled. My husband thought there weren't enough chocolate chips. I thought there were too many.  I have a new seasonal  favorite.

These were so good! I didn’t have all of the spices, so I used pumpkin pie spice instead, subbed light brown sugar for white sugar and increased the pumpkin to 1 cup. My kids loved them!

So. Flipping. Good. Go make them. Right now. Based on suggestions from other reviewers and my own personal preferences, I made the following swaps and minor tweaks: I swapped the white sugar for brown sugar, substituted half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce (1/8 c. of each), added 1/2 t. of vanilla, swapped half of the AP flour for whole wheat flour, used soy milk in place of the water, and doubled the amount of spice. I may reduce the sugar just a bit next time, just to further the illusion that these are somehow healthy.

I made a few adjustments to the original recipe. I doubled the number of spices and salt and added roughly 1 cup of the pumpkin puree. Came out great! However, I used paper liners and the muffins got stuck to them--just let them cool off completely and they shouldn't stick if you wanna use some. Probably will skip them next time around.

These are YUMMY! Easy recipe to double. I did follow some reviews and used brown sugar instead of white; increased pumpkin to 1 cup;  doubled cinnamon and nutmeg; and decreased the baking temp to 350 for 20 minutes. I made them to share with my son's mountain bike team at a race tomorrow,  but I don't think they will make it because my family is eating them all!

Used pumpkin pie filling instead of regular pumpkin. Skipped the nutmeg and cloves because I didnt have any and the pumpkin pie filling already had spices in it. Doubled the cinnamon and used half a tsp of allspice. Used a full cup of chocolate chips.  I have a house full of teenagers and they loved them!

Man were these good!! Per others' helpful suggestions, I used: brown sugar (1/2 cup dark brown packed, 1/4 white), 1 cup of pumpkin, and 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Plus added a little vanilla. Baked 400 degrees for 15-16 mins, came out perfect, delicious and moist with a great pumpkin flavor. Will be making again this fall!

Followed others suggestions of using 1 cup pumpkin, brown sugar, mini chocolate chips and double spices.  Also baked at 375 for 20 minutes. They were great!  I hate wasting so mixed the extra canned pumpkin into my dog's dry food which she loved. So good for her coat!

My girls eat these for breakfast every morning! They freeze perfectly and warm up quickly on the microwave. I make four dozen at once with a few minor adjustments. I add two teaspoons (for four times the recipe) of vanilla extract, use half oil/half applesauce, and substitute half whole wheat flour. This is a staple in our house!

Great recipe, they turned out quite nicely the very first time.  Since I love chocolate, I added the amount the recipe indicated.  But I found that the chocolate took over from the other more delicate flavours. So the next time I omitted the chocolate, increased the spices by half again, and added finely chopped crystallized ginger. Superb!

I added extra chocolate chips (maybe used 3/4 cup), and used mini-chocolate-chips instead of regular size. They were delicious! A hit with the kids, too!

These are good muffins.  I made the recipe as written minus the chocolate chips which is probably a good thing since I found them to be a bit on the sweet side.  I think these will be even better tomorrow.  I will make these again.

I followed this recipe to the T and once more while omitting the chocolate chips - these came out delicious both ways. A small bit of batter was left and baked using a donut pan with excellent results as well.

Like others I changed the recipe and increased that pumpkin and spices. I also changed to brown sugar. Since I had leftover fresh pumpkin from Halloween I used that and not canned. The muffin isn't a high rising muffin but it is nice and moist. Also the pumpkin flavour is very pronounced.

I give it 5 stars with the alterations:

Substituting apple sauce for oil, the white sugar with packed brown sugar; 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup ww flour, increasing the spices to 1 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp ground ginger, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg; 1/2 tsp ground cloves

Followed the recipe, but made a few changes according to other reviews.  I used milk instead of water, doubled the amount of spices, used brown sugar instead of white and also added 1/4 teasp. of pumpkin pie spice.  I also used dark chocolate chips instead (my preference). These got wonderful reviews...I will definitely make these again!

I have made this recipe five times in the last month. The reviews saying to decrease temp of oven were helpful; as were the ones saying to increase to 1 C pumpkin and double spices.
My own alterations on top of these were to use milk instead of water, use orange zest, and ginger. Then for optimal texture I halved the flour, and used the other half amount in toasted old fashioned oats that I put in the food processor for 5 minutes. Absolute perfect muffins.

This recipe was amazing! I always double the batch so our family will have enough for the week! I put a half teaspoon more of each of the spices and my family loves it. If you want to try a new recipe,  this is certainly the one to try!

These did not come out well at all....I made it according to the recipe and they were so dense and almost burnt, and stuck to the liners.

2nd batch, I Changed  temp to 375 degrees and cook for half the time and they still came out dense and blah 

Won't make again

I made according to the recipe, using coconut oil as my vegetable oil (which I always do when baking).  These were a huge hit with my teenagers!  I only baked for 15 minutes and they were perfect.  They did stick to the muffin papers a bit, so when I made them again I sprayed the bottoms of my mufffin papers with oil.  Not sure if that was due to the muffin papers or the muffins, but they didn't stick the second time.  I might  try making with brown sugar next time as some of the other reviews suggested to see the difference.  Some reviewers thought these were bland, but I liked that they weren't too sweet or overpowering on the pumpkin.

Perfectly delicious. I made it to the tee, only using 1/2C brown sugar + 1/4C white instead of 3/4C white sugar Everything else the same, and they were wonderful! A keeper!

So delicious! They came out a little tough, but I think that was just a mistake on my part. I’d never made muffins before and I didn’t know I wasn’t supposed to mix them to death. I’m planning to make them again, so hopefully I can get it right this time!

My family loved these muffins!  Per other reviews, I subbed apple sauce for the oil and whole wheat flour for AP flour.  I also decreased the oven temp to 375.  They are so good!  Making another batch now

Used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, substituted a third of the flour with whole wheat flour, and reduced the amount of white sugar. I also followed chibi chef's recommendations for increased spices, and used 1/3 cup semisweet chocolate chips and 1/3 cup cinnamon chips. As written I think this recipe is probably anout 4 stars. With these changes, a definite 5-star recipe.

Very bland and lacking in that delectable slightly dense and richly moist one usually associates with pumpkin muffins. Tasted like stale cake that had been sitting out after just cooling on the rack for 20 mins.

The chocolate chips make these feel more like a dessert than a healthy snack, but the kids had no complaints - the batch hardly had time to cool before they were gone. To make them feel slightly more healthy I used half all-purpose and half whole-wheat flour. Also, instead of 3/4 cup of canned pumpkin and 1/4  cup water, I used 1 cup of roasted pie pumpkin puree which worked out very well.

Very yummy!  The only thing I did differently was to use brown sugar instead of white.  I just doubled everything else for more muffins and they turned out delicious.  I made them for my daughter's softball team before the game this evening and couldn't keep my husband from stealing them!

This is a great recipe that's always a hit for my family. My only recommendation is to double it so you can use an entire can of pumpkin (1.5 cups) instead of just half, and then you'd have to find something to do with it. They'll all get eaten!

doubled the recipe, like many subbed applesauce for oil and added some extra chips and a couple tbsp. of ground flax seed. Could use a bit more spice, but overall tasty recipe. Just used Pam on my silicone muffin cups.

Used brown sugar instead of white
Used applesauce instead of oil
Use room temp eggs
Used one 15 oz can of pumpkin purée 
Used mini chocolate chips dipped in a little flour before mixing with batter. 
Doubled ingredients but instead of cinnamon ,cloves and nutmeg-I used six teaspoons of speculaas spice mix for enough  flavor 
Turned out phenomenal

With these additions I would rate this a five star muffin!  I used coconut palm sugar (which tastes like brown sugar) less glycemic index, didn't have applesauce so I used apple butter, a whole cup of pumpkin puree, and a whole cup of mini chocolate chips, plus I upped the spices to 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of allspice and 1/2 tsp of cloves. These were so moist and flavorful that we ate them all in a few days :)

Update: if you want fluffy muffins, substitute softened butter for the oil and cream it with the sugar. Also, if you're lazy like me, you can double the recipe and pour the batter into a loaf pan. Bake at 350F for about 45 min to an hour and you get a loaf with a beautiful crust on top. I had to cover mine with foil after 45 min because I didn't want the outside to get too hard.

I used whole wheat flour. Took the suggestion of others and doubled the cinnamon, used 1/2 t. all spice instead of cloves, used almond milk in place of water, and increased pumpkin to 1 cup. My family loved them. Definitely a keeper.

I wanted to love these muffins, but as written I think they are bland and dry. I made them twice. The first time I made them just as written. I had to take mine out of the oven 5 minutes early and they were still dry. My oven is calibrated perfectly; I check often. They didn't have any pop. The second time that I made them they were better, but I made these changes: subbed brown sugar for the white, added 1 T molasses, doubled the cinnamon, and I added 1/4 cup of applesauce to the recipe. The applesauce and molasses add moisture, but no additional fat. The molasses serves to develop the flavor a little more, and something about molasses  keeps things nice and moist. I lowered the oven temp to 375 and got 12 muffins out of the recipe. With those changes-- they are delectable!

I tweaked the recipe using healthier choices. Brown sugar and whole wheat flour. I used 1 cup of pumpkin. The rest remained the same. They were enjoyed by all.

I used gluten - free flour (Cup for Cup) and the results were very good. I also substituted dark brown sugar and used only 1/2 cup.  I have made the recipe 3 times in the past week, adding sunflower and pumpkin seeds for a little extra nutrition and nutty flavour.

Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes and they  looked overbaked.  My oven usually takes longer to bake than most recipes so I was surprised when I checked them at 20 and saw that they were a bit too brown.  Substituted brown sugar for the white and added more cinnamon like most suggested.  I would definitely leave out the cloves next time because they seemed to stand out more than the cinnamon.  Will try again and reduce time and cloves.

interesting recipe as far as quantity of items go. Preferring whole\even numbers, i rounded almost everything up (in
incl a full can of pumpkin, a bag of semi-sweet choc chips, and 2 full cups of sugar-half white\splenda and half brown). I made about 48 small, bite-sized muffins.

Made these a million times!  Our go to muffin.  Don't put in the water. We savor dark chocolate chips in them.  Also can be made allergen free by using coconut oil, gf flours, and vegan chocolate chips.  Super great recipe!  Many thanks!

Very good muffins, but they stuck to the paper liners.  I reduced the sugar by 1/2.  They are not sweet that way.  I would keep the sugar as specified in the recipe if you prefer sweet muffins.

These muffins were a little bland, but there is a great amount of chocolate chips. I turned the oven temperature down to 350, because the tops of the muffins got a little crusty.

Divided the mixture in half. Added 1/4 chocolate chips to half the mixture and 1 Apple chopped to the other half of the mixture. Also, made my own puréed pumpkin, used brown sugar, doubled the amount of cinnamon. Think I could have doubled the other spices as it was a bit bland, but my friends liked it. I would make this again every fall, but my husband and I are not huge pumpkin fans.

Turned out great! I did replace the oil with apple butter and used half white sugar and half brown sugar. The other change I did was 1/2 all purpose flour and 1/2 whole white wheat flour. They had great texture and my kids gobbled them up!!! Great recipe!!

We substituted GF King Flour for regular flour, and these came out yummy and delicious!  We used 1/2 cup maple syrup instead (100% maple syrup, not table syrup) and we've done it with regular sugar, also.  AMAZING!

Good base recipe. This first time I made it I felt like it was too bland and the flavors lacking. I upped the pumpkin to 1 cup,  used light brown sugar instead of white. I almost doubled all the spices and added in 1/2 tsp each of ginger and allspice with. We like chocolate so we used 1 cup semi-sweet chips. Much better after the adjustments.

These are delicious. I love the pumpkin-chocolate combo. Like others, I made a few changes - I doubled the recipe and made mini-muffins, so I used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar instead of white, doubled the cinnamon, and used a whole can of pumpkin. 15 minutes baked at 350 and they came out perfect. Made 2 batches plus 4 extras. These were mainly for my 1-year old, otherwise I would have put walnut pieces in them too.

Followed some of the reviewers by doubling the spices, using the full can of pumpkin.  Used applesauce in place of oil, 1/2 c ww flour, wheat germ, flax seed.  Threw in some crushed-up Total cereal.  Baked in greased pans at 350 25 minutes.  Came out light and great tasting.

Followed other suggestions and doubled recipe.  Used a whole can of pumpkin, doubled spices and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Very good and not as sweet as you would think.  I made 48 mini muffins with mini semi-sweet chips and baked for 10 min, one pan at a time.  Will make again and often.

I made this and shared them with two different neighbors that raved about them.  I made a double batch and used 3/4 cup of packed brown sugar and 3/4 cup of white sugar.  I increased the pumpkin to 2 cups,  was generous while measuring the spices and used a whole bag of 12 oz. chocolate chips.  I made them in my large muffin tins.  They turned out great!  I'll definitely make them again.

They have become a family staple but also made a few substitutions namely brown sugar in place of white sugar and apple sauce in place of vegetable oil. Quick and easy!

I followed some of the same changes as others, used a whole can of pumpkin and doubled cinnamon & nutmeg. Although the muffins tasted great, they don't come out of the cupcake liners. You lose half the muffin to the wrapper.

Excellent.   Made some changes based on reviews:  doubled the recipe,  used 1 can of pumpkin and 3tsp pumpkin pie spice in place of the individual spices.  Cooked at 375 in a pampered chef stone muffin pan for 20-23 minutes (first batch was a little full and cooked for 23 min, 2nd batch less full and stone was warm cooked for 20 min) until toothpick came out clean.  Made 2 doz.

Really happy with this recipe. I reduced the sugar a tiny bit, but otherwise made them exactly as written. Mine were done in 18 minutes. I'll definitely make this again! Great way to get veggie-averse kids to eat pumpkin.

I added an extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and I thought it tasted a lot better!!! My mom doesn't like pumpkin or spices, but when she tried one she thought that it was very mild and really enjoyed them. I wish I had read down on the comments to substitute white with brown sugar, but they still turned out very well. (:

Excellent muffins! My teenage boy ate 3 of them right out of the oven. To make them more moist I took the suggestion of using 1 cup of pumpkin and subbed 1.5 tsp pumpkin pie spice for time saving purposes. It's a keeper!

I really like this recipe because it is not sickeningly sweet as some are.  I added about 1/4 c more of pumpkin and about 1/4 c more of chocolate chips.  It's a good recipe that doesn't sit in your stomach.  I like the fact that there is only 1/4c oil (I used canola) too.    Can't give it a five star rating because I tweaked it a little!

I made the recipe exactly as written. The flavor of these muffins was good, but they were on the dry side.
If I make them again, I will double the vegetable oil and eliminate the water. That should make them more moist.

I liked these muffins. While I agree with the other reviews that the muffins were a bit bland, I thought that the texture was wonderful! Personally I will double the spices next time but otherwise, very good recipe!

I read a few reviews and opted with the applesauce switch for oil.  I swiched to dark brown sugar.    I used a combination of butterscotch chips and chocolate chips.   And I  upped the spices .  I also used a large 6 cup muffin pan as these will be breakfast fare.    They smell fantastic,  are very dense and the combo chips work well.  The recipe is so easy to make  too.  I liked how everything went together easily.

I used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin spice instead of the other spices. Also did half white and half brown sugar. Topped it with mini chocolate chips.  Delicious!
Next time I'll try 1.5 teaspoons of pumpkin spice.

Made these muffins using the suggestions of others- increased the pumpkin puree to 1 cup, increased all the spices and used brown sugar instead of granulated sugar.  They were delicious!  They definitely taste best when eaten the same day after they're baked, they were a little hard the next day.

Very good and easy.  I always sub applesauce for oil when baking and I used white whole wheat flour. I just used pumpkin pie spice in place of the individual spices.  Made mini muffins and they were done in 14 minutes.

I love this Recipe.  The Pumpkin is Subtle and it really works with the Chocolate Chips.  Next time I'm going to make it with Dried Cranberries instead of the chocolate chips.  I cut the recipe in half and made the following changes.

These are so yummy with the following changes:
1 Cup of All Purpose flour
1/2 Cup Whole Wheat Flour
1/2 Cup Brown Sugar
1 Cup Sprouts Organic Canned Pumpkin
1/4 cup Sprouts Original Unsweetened Almond Milk 
2 tsp. Pumpkin Pie Spice
1/2 Cup chopped English Walnuts.

Baked for :30 minutes at 350 F oven with a tray underneath.

These were good. I used a whole can of pumpkin and kept the remaining ingredients the same. I did add a bit more cinnamon. I also added 1/2 C butterscotch chips with the choc chips.

Very easy to make and amenable to changes depending on your preference.  I made it with walnuts (2 handfuls), choco chips (again 2 handfuls), used egg beaters instead of real eggs, and a whole can of pumpkin (the normal size, not the gigantic ones).  I sprinkled them with powdered sugar when serving.  They aren't too sweet which is perfect.  The only thing I would change is decreasing the amount of nutmeg by 1/2 but that's just me.  My kids just loved them.  I think you could add some zucchini to this to hide more veggies for kids and would taste just as good.

Added ginger spice (3/4 tsp);
Added vanilla (1/4 tsp);
Increased cinnamon (1 1/4 tsp);

Lovely results, moist and delicious. I will definitely make it again and I highly recommend trying this easy recipe!

Perfect recipe as is, but I added 2-3 tbs chia seeds for texture. It made 8 regular sized muffins, the rest I baked in a loaf pan, cut diagonally and turned into biscotti. Delicious!

I followed everyone's advice and added more pumpkin (1 1/2 cups),  substituted brown sugar, and added tons of spices. I like to use a lot of cinnamon while baking so I probably used 1 Tbsp. The end results were delicious and moist. The chocolate chips were not overpowering and balanced the muffins perfectly. My co-workers could not get enough.

I've been having this recipe for years. It's great as it but after trying yogurt in another muffin recipe I replaced the water for 1/4c whole milk greek yogurt & found the texture even better. Can't go wrong either way though, it's a great recipe & a staple in our house!

I doubled the recipe, using a whole can of pumpkin. I used all the ingredients and tried to double the pumpkin spice since many reviews says it needed more. I still feel it needs more spice and pumpkin. I used a 1/4 cup to scoop the batter and they came out perfectly plump! I also wish I would have baked for them 21-22 minutes instead of 23. But all in all, super recipe!

Overall, this is a good recipe.  I used the recommendations of others and increased the pumpkin to 1 cup.  Next time I will try adding even more pumpkin.  I also used more chocolate chips than the recipe called for.  I baked them 18 mins and they were a little overdone.  I will need to watch them closer the next time I make them.  I will make them again though!!

I followed the recommendation to use brown (light) sugar in place of white. I also doubled cinnimon and nutmeg (too much nutmeg). I increased pumpkin to 1 cup and still didn't get much of the pumpkin flavor I was looking for. I tried out whole wheat flour for the first time and reduced flour to 1 1/4 cup. Baked 400 for 20 min. Yummy, but strong nutmeg flavor. Next time I'll leave the nutmeg as is and maybe add more pumpkin. Moist and delicious either way.

Nice recipe but time should err on less minutes. I set timer for 20 minutes and could smell them burning.  They came out very brown, not burnt but would have been better with 15-18 minute time frame so could check on them sooner.

I have made This recepie several times and am always happy with the results! Changes I regularly make now are, use 1/3 of flour as whole wheat, 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of the white, increase pumpkin to 1 cup, double the spices and applesauce instead of oil.  My daughter loves them even though she is generally picky!

Delicious! I used brown instead of white sugar, added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 1.5 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the individual spices. A keeper!

Great recipe. We used our own homemade pumpkin puree. I would recommend increasing the amount of spices. They were a little bland. They were also just barely on the dry side so we baked them for about 17 minutes at 380 degrees instead of the recommended 20 mind at 400.

I have used this recipe for YEARS. They are best if you let the flavors develop overnight, and if you use foil disposable baking cups, not the paper cups. Use EVOO.  I always bake 2 batches: the first one gets devoured on baking day - with a few left over for the next day.  The rest go into a ziplock bag and into the freezer for Black Friday.  Pop the ziplock bag straight into your car as you leave the house, and by the time Starbucks /fave coffee shop opens early  you can have your fave coffee or tea and a delicious homemade muffin to get you on to the next store.  :)

Making my second batch of these right now,  just as the recipe is written.  They are wonderful!   My 14 year old daughter who doesn't like anything, absolutely loves these.  I have added this recipe to my favorites!

Since we tried these the first time I have had to make them at least six more times. My whole family loves them. I did follow some review suggestions and swapped out the white sugar for brown sugar and increased the pumpkin to one cup. I also omitted the nutmeg and cloves and increased the cinnamon since my kids don't like either spice. The last time I made them I had planned to swap the oil for applesauce to make them a bit healthier and forgot all together and they still came out great! Thanks for the recipe its become a staple around my house.

I followed the recipe exactly.  They taste great!  Next time I'm going to use melted butter in place of the oil, just to cut out some omega sixes.  But even as the recipe reads, they are absolutely delicious.  Thanks Donna for the delicious recipe.

Yum! I followed other reviews and used 1 cup of pumpkin and doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg. Everyone loved them, including my picky boys. The only problem you're going to have is  eating the batter!

Terrific! I bake in a pan instead of muffin tin.  Sprinkle with a little bit of white sugar on top before baking to give a 'crinkle' look.  A standard for our family.  You can change it up too, by adding your favorite chopped nut and/or cranberries or raisins.

Just okay. Would not make again. Not as moist or flavorful as some of the other pumpkin recipes I've made. Downeast Maine Pumpkin bread comes to mind. Next time I want pumpkin chocolate chip muffins, I think I'll use one of those recipes and add chocolate chips.

I followed this recipe to a T and thought they were pretty good. Very moist. However, they definitely need more spice. The total amount of spices is 1 teaspoon so doubling or tripling it might work better. Or just add a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice. Also, These didn't rise hardly like I wanted them to. I reccomend filling the muffins almost al the way full.

These muffins turned out deeeelicious! however I chose to follow one of the reviews and use packed brown sugar instead of white, 1 cup of pumpkin, and doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg. Also, I took a risk in substituting the oil with apple sauce, and used whole wheat flour to add fibre. And as a finishing touch I candied up some pecans with honey and cayenne to bake on top. After 20 mins at 375 this recipe yielded 15 standard size muffins:)

I doubled this batch, omitted the chocolate chips, added golden raisins and chopped walnuts instead! Used extra canned pumpkin for flavor and moisture. Didn't have oil so I used butter (same qty). My husband LOVED them! Next time I am going to use the walnuts and use dried cranberries instead of raisins!

I wanted to use up some of our dry ingredients, I decided to make these muffins (in the dead of summer). I thought they were pretty good -- I doubled the recipe to use up a whole 15 oz can of pumpkin. This is 1/4 cup more pumpkin than the recipe calls for, so I used half the oil. I didn't have cloves, so I added a bit more cinnamon. All other measurements were true to the recipe. I'd bake at 375 next time, as the outsides got just a little more done than I like. I highly recommend the extra pumpkin and spice, as others have suggested - I did it out of practicality, but the muffins are still just a little bit bland. 

Having worked in a bakery, I can say that muffins and cake breads really develop their flavor over a day. We baked pumpkin choco-chip muffins and they definitely tasted more "developed" after a day, so I'm sure that tomorrow morning, the muffins will have more flavor.

Really good, although I made a lot of tweaks to my taste. I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown, closer to 1 cup pumpkin, subbed applesauce for the oil, added 1/4 tsp ground ginger, and used fewer choc chips. I also added a spoonful of cream cheese sweetened with sugar in the middle of each muffin, mostly because I needed to use the cream cheese, and that was fantastic (put some batter into the muffin cup, add the cream cheese, spoon more batter over the top, bake as normal).

These muffins were amazing! I did what most of the comments said and used brown sugar instead of white sugar and added more canned pumpkin and spice. I will definitely make these again!

I put in raisins for 1/2 of the recipe, because I prefer then, while my daughter prefers chocolate chips! I also used 1/3 c whole wheat flour in place of some of the all purpose flour and they were great!

These are really delicious weather you use caned or even a regular jack-o-lantern pumpkin. The only thing I would do differently from the recipe is simple check them at 15 minutes instead of 20-25. In my oven 15 mins at 400 f is perfect.

I loved these muffins! I just made a few alterations. I used a whole can of pumpkin instead of just 3/4 cup. Also, I use half white sugar and half brown. These two changes make the muffins more moist. Though other than that I thought the muffins were perfectly delightful!

My family loves these muffins.  I make them every fall and winter.  I use paper liners and inevitably a lot of muffin sticks to them.  I need to remember not to use the paper liners next time.  I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the vegetable oil. I traded out half of the white flour for whole wheat flour.  I left out the cloves and the salt.  I doubled the recipe (yielding 24 muffins) and used one 15-1/2 ounce can of pumpkin and one 12 ounce bag of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I think next time I will use more cinnamon and nutmeg.  They baked up nicely in about 15-17 minutes.  Delicious!

I'm usually a decent muffin baker, but these did not work for me at all.  They came out dense and heavy.  Don't think I'll give this recipe a second chance....  OK, I just added back in a star.  After these sit for a few hours, the taste improves dramatically. I still don't love the texture, but I can't rule out problems with my ingredients.

By just following the recipe these muffins were anywhere but fantastic. However after reading the other comments for changes, I will definitely make them again. Less pumpkin, more spice is what I found will need changing in my next batch.

Not what I was expecting. I followed some of the suggestions and used more pumpkin (1 cup), but they were still bland.  They tasted like plain muffins, some people could not even tell they were supposed to be pumpkin muffins.

Made the recipe as is and gave it 4 stars.  Made it again with the following changes:  1 Cup of Pumpkin, used mini-chocolate chips, about 1/2 cup, used 3 tsp pumpkin pie spice, topped with Streusel, and sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top.  Baked at 375 for 19 minutes.  Good muffin, not too sweet.  May use brown sugar next time as suggested by other reviewers.

Just finished making (and eating) these muffins.  They were simple to prepare and the texture came out beautiful!  I was super impressed with these.  I gave 4 stars "Like it" instead of "Love it" because I thought they needed a bit more spice.  They are kind of bland, but that counters the sweet chocolate chips.  I don't think they need to be sweeter, but could use more spice.  I might make these again.

Good starter recipe,  need atleast one cup of pumpkin and double the seasoning.  I didn't have chocolate chips so I added a few tablespoons of Nutella and added cream cheese frosting (half a cup of powered sugar and 4oz of soften cream chesse).  They are delicious!

I made these with 1/2 cup quick oats, 1 cup flour, brown sugar instead of white, cinnamon applesauce instead of oil, 3/4 small can pumpkin, 1 egg and added vanilla extract and allspice and mini choc chips.  I changed a lot to make it a bit more healthy and to work with what I had but it turned out really good:)

These muffins are scrumptious, pumpkin plus chocolate equals amazing! Brown sugar is the way to go. If you taste the batter raw, it tastes just like pumpkin pie but better!

These were excellent. I followed the recipe exactly and was surprised how yummy these muffins were. My other half gave them two thumbs up also.

Love this recipe. I altered it a bit though. I substituted the two eggs by adding 1/3 cup more pumpkin (fresh, cooked pumpkin not canned) and 1/4 cup more oil. I steamed the pumpkin (don't boil as it will retain to much water). Added more spices and chocolate bits than indicated. Came out super moist and delicious!

I’ve made this a number of times and love them. I do use brown sugar rather than white. I double the amount of cinnamon and nutmeg and sub pumpkin pie spice as needed. Because I had issues with the muffin sticking to the muffin cups, I’ve increased the oil to 1/3 cup.

I followed other users suggestions and used Brown sugar instead of white, 1 cup of pumpkin, I like lots of flavor so I added a ton of pumpkin pie spice. I also used half white flour half whole wheat pastry flour, and applesauce instead of oil. I changed a ton about this recipe which is why it doesn't have 5 stars, but a lot of the changes are to just make it personalized to my tastes. Turned out delicious! My mother said it was the best muffin she ever had :)

Good, but kind of hard.  I didn't add the water because it seems it had enough liquid from my squash.  Next time I will try the water and see if it makes the differance.  Children Liked them.

These are sooooo good.  My kids and I all love them.  I now crave these more often than I do chocolate chip cookies, and that's saying something!!  Double the batch to use up one full can of pumpkin.  No worries, they'll get eaten!!

These are wonderful! I add a little bit of extra chocolate chips to the top of each muffin; it's yummy and makes them look even better.

I've made these muffins exactly as described 5 times, and they're moist and delicious every time. I use Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips and bake in a convection oven at a slightly lower temperature and 5 minutes less. Perfect!

Doubled the recipe so that I could use a whole (15 oz) can of pumpkin.  Also used much more of all the spices than the recipe called for.

I've been making these for a few years now and my kids LOVE them. They are quick to make and freeze well. I use 1/2 cup whole wheat flour + 1 cup regular flour and apple sauce instead of oil to heathen them up a bit. Kids can tell the difference. You can also use brown sugar instead of regular.

Great recipe, only a few things I found from making them a couple times. Adding a little more pumpkin is better. I replace one egg with more pumpkin. Also, 375* for abt 20 min is way better than 400* for my oven.  very yummy though and simple. I've tried other recipes that use apple sauce or yogurt or sour cream instead of oil...but these are just delicious.

My sister in low has given me a huge organic pumpkin. I have never done sweets with pumpkin. So I wanted to give it a try. I increased the amount of pumpkin. Used brown sugar and more spices like some reviewers suggested but less sugar than the recipe called for, because my pumpkin was already very sweet. Added a 1/2 cup of walnuts. And it was very very delicious. Thank you for this great recipe and for sure I will make it again and again.

Pretty good. I will say that 20 minutes baking time was more than enough. I would probably cook them a little less next time as they were a bit overdone.

These were pretty good. They didn't have a whole lot of flavor but I also didn't want them to have as much spice as pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread. They are unique tasting. I made a caramel icing for them and that really made these muffins shine, without it it would have been kind of bland. I probably used a cup or so of pumpkin. They had a fabulous texture! My family enjoyed them so that makes it worth it, I don't think I'll be making these too often though.

Oh my GOD. These muffins are out of this world. The best muffins I've ever had, bar none. I love pumpkin (and chocolate!), but every pumpkin-themed baked good I've tried is just a little dry. But when I saw the great reviews for these I thought I'd give it a shot. I didn't change the recipe at all, save for the suggested 1 cup of chocolate chips, and erring on the side of a little extra pumpkin. I used muffin cups and baked them at 380 degrees for 20 minutes, because overdone=too dry! 

I was SHOCKED that I had made these when I took the first bite. They are incredibly moist, the pumpkin and spice are delicious but not overwhelming and the chocolate is...well, chocolate. I got countless compliments from my housemates and friends. 

One tiny note: I filled the baking cups just a little more than 2/3 full--maybe 3/4--and that gave me a really nice rounded top! It meant making 24 muffins with a doubled recipe--perfect.

I followed another viewer suggestion & doubled the cinnamon & nutmeg, used 1 cup pumpkin, & brown sugar instead of white. I used a little less chocolate chips & added some raisins.   Soooooo good & moist.  I will make these all year round.

After reading some reviews, I altered the recipe a bit, using a 15oz can of pumpkin & adding 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  Next time I make these, I will use brown sugar instead.  They were a big hit at work when I brought them in.

Not amazing but good. I upped the spices and I still thought they were a tad bland. But good because they aren't too sweet.

These were sooo good! I made them with my friends and we ate them up really quickly. However, they could've used some more pumpkin AND chocolate chips. I highly recommend these to everyone.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I used 1 cup of fresh pumpkin, upped the spices a little bit, used 1/2 cup white sugar with a 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and decreased the flour to 1 cup white flour and 1/4 cup white whole wheat flour. This will be my go to recipe, so good!

After reading a few of the reviews I decided to use 1 cup pumpkin, apple sauce instead of oil, and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. They were great! The only thing was I used paper liners and the muffins stuck to the liners. I think that was because of no oil. So maybe if you use apple sauce just grease the pan.

I thought these came out a bit on the bland side. I even added extra pumpkin, sugar and cinnamon. They were ok but I don't think they will make it the thanksgiving dinner table.

These were really good. I made my own pumpkin by steaming chunks of it in a pan on the stove with cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger, cloves, allspice and vanilla. I subbed brown sugar for the white and 1/4 cup coconut flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I used 1 cup of pumpkin and added extra spices that I previously listed.

Tried this this morning and made the usual substitutions to make it a little healthier: used applesauce instead of the oil, brown sugar instead of white (and cut back to 1/2 cup), and used 3/4c all purpose and 3/4c whole wheat flour.  Also bumped up the spices and used a 1 tsp baking powder.  Turned out ok, but still a little bland.  My 2 year old ate them tho, so I probably won't up the sugar.   Thanks for posting!

This is a great recipe to start with and to make some changes that suit your tastes.  I used brown sugar instead of white, apple sauce instead of oil, and increased the pumpkin & spices.  A great place to start and a very easy recipe to make!

A lot of people seemed to write in their reviews that there was too much chocolate chips and I thought "how could there EVER be too many chocolate chips?" But now I actually agree with them, because the chocolate taste was a little to overpowering and you didn't really get enough pumpkin taste in the muffin. I actually used more pupkin than called for and double the cinnamon and nutmeg. Next time, less chocolate chips and maybe even more pumpkin? I had no cloves and could've used allspice. I'll try it with the allspice next time too.

Delicious! We just made these- they did stick a bit to the wrappers, but we didn't really let them cool. We used mini chocolate chips, and I didn't measure the pumpkin well, so it might have been more than 3/4 cup. We also were out of nutmeg, but I added more cinnamon.

I decided to try this pumpkin chip muffin instead of my usual because of the high rating. Although these are good they are not as good as my normal recipe. I found the muffin to have a little too much nutmeg which sort of overtook the pumpkin taste.

Great!  I used 1 c of white flour and 1/2 c of wheat.  Also took the advice of another and doubled the nutmeg and cinnamon. Used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I had some chopped pecans left over so threw those in too; about 1/4 c.  I also used mini chocolote chips.  I had some left over streussel topping from another batch of muffins so put that on top before baking.  This consisted of 3/4 c sugar, 1/2 flour, 1/4 c margarine and 2 tsp of cinnamon; mix all with a fork and then spoon on muffins with a tablespoon...you will have quite a bit of topping left over or could use for 2 batches. Will  definitely make again.

Came out moist. Only complaint - perhaps too many chocolate chips. My modifications:Used 1/2 cup almond meal + 1 cup flour. Used applesauce instead of oil. instead of white sugar, used 1/2 cup light brown sugar. Used a little less than 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips - but think next time will only used 1/4 cup. As far as spices, I used 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Cooked at 350 for 15 minutes (for mini muffins) and for about 25 minutes for the full size muffins.

These muffins are delicous.  I like my pumpkin spicy.  I didn't have nutmeg or cloves so I used about a Tbs of Cinnamon and Pumpkin Pie Spice and these were perfect.  I also used the whole can of pumpkin.  These were perfect on a day you were wishing fall was here.  My house smelled wonderful :)

Love this recipe! I make it a bit healthier by using whole-wheat flour, applesauce instead of oil (I still use a TBSP of oil so it's not dry). I usually double this batch to use a whole can of pumpkin puree and do half with chocolate chips and half without. These freeze really well and will thaw out in just a couple hours. One of my go-tos for sure!

These were good but seemed to be missing something. It killed me to add water. Seems like milk or juice would enhance the flavor, but it was my first time making them. Next time I'll be experimenting.

Wonderful muffins! I took some of these to work and they were a hit. I like how moist they are and the spices give them such a warm flavor with the pumpkin and chocolate.

Even with all the mods, this was still a little dry. Makes 18 muffins, not 12. Not bad though. Would likely make again.

Very good recipe. 23 minutes was too long. The tops were slightly burned. Maybe 18 minutes next time, and more chocolate chips! This is a tweak to your own taste muffin. Thank you

These are very easy to make and super delicious!  I didn't have pumpkin puree so I used pumpkin pie filling and just added an extra tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg instead- I also took another reviewer's tip and substituted the white sugar for brown and my family LOVED them!!

I just made these and they turned out great.  I added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice as suggested in another review.  My kids loved them.  I will definitely be baking these again.

This recipe I found FANTASTIC! Reminded me of something you would get from Starbucks or some fancy little coffee shop. Thought the spices were the perfect blend and balance. Found they have a very nice soft texture too. Will make these again and again. My husband almost had them all gone by morning : )

I made a few little changes to these and they were awesome, I was very impressed! 
   Like alot of reviewers I used 1 cup of pumpkin, instead of 3/4 cup. I also put in 1 tsp of salt instead of 1/4, and I added 1 tsp vanilla. I upped the baking powder to 1 1/4 tsp. I put a simple struesel topping on them and baked them in jumbo muffin tins at 375 degrees for 25 minutes. Perfection!

Awesome recipe!  I use unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil and added 1/8 tsp ground ginger.  I use 1/2 (15oz) can of pumpkin to measure easily or just double the recipe and use a full can!  I use mini chocolate chips and it makes great mini muffins.  I use this recipe all the time...love it!

Delicious!  Perfect for little kids.  I made this for my son's preschool class and the kids thought they were the best.  I did end up doubling the spices as suggested by the other reviewers.  Next time I think I will cut the sugar to just a 1/2 cup to lesson the sweetness.

Absolutely fabulous! I doubled the recipe but made just a few small changes. I only used 3 eggs instead of 4. Because I didn't have any ground cloves I used 2 teaspoons of Cinnamon. Will definitely make these again!

These muffins are a huge hit at our weekly bake sale.  People come week after week asking for the pumpkin muffins!!  Everyone raves how moist and delicious they are.  I'm always a little generous with the chocolate chips....

As is this recipe is a 4.  I made some changes to the second batch I made though, and this bumps it to a 5.  Following some of the other reviews I turned the temp down to 375.  This helped with the over-browning.  Second they were lacking in pumpkin flavor so I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup.  The second batch turned out delicious, very moist, and pumpkiny.

Made a few changes...used WW flour and Ghiradelli milk choc chips (our fave). Next time I will use 1 C of chips though, didn't seem to be enough. Followed first reviewer and added 1 cup pumpkin, replaced white sugar with brown sugar and increased spices. I also added 1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice. They turned out delish! ...keeper

Very good!  The only change I made was to use brown sugar.  I usually make muffins with vanilla (not plain) yogurt instead of oil, but that was the only flavor missing from the fridge (thanks, kids).  Turned out great and light even with the oil!

Awesome!  I used gluten free flour (1 c white, 1/2 c gluten free) and doubled the chips.  They stuck to cupcake holders (not sure why, maybe wrapper quality/paper), but they tasted yummy!  Ate them warm.  Hope to try with full gluten free flour next time.

I used real pumpkin that I cooked up & froze in the fall.  I didn't add any water to the recipe.  I used about 1 cup of pumpkin (I'm one of those cooks that doesn't measure but goes by looks!)  I measured everything else.  I used mini choc chips.  Very good!!

I found these muffins bland, even after I substituted brown sugar for white, increased pumpkin to 1 c., and doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg. I'll try a different recipe next time. To each her own I guess...

My kids chose this recipe for home-ec today. The muffins turned out great!! My house smells awesome now:) The only change they made was to use canola oil, rather than vegetable oil. Next time they make these, I might have them add either a glaze or streusel topping. Thanks for sharing!

I use a mini-muffin pan, that has been sprayed with Pam and bake muffins for 14 minutes at 400. The mini-muffins were excellent and slip right out of the muffin cups after waiting for 5 minutes. These taste great and freeze very well! Excellent recipe!

These wear okay tasting but stuck to the paper cups terrible so we are basically left with 1/2 muffin. I made the changes in the 1st review.  Wonder if with 3/4 cup of pumpkin they would have not done that.

Super tasty.  I left out the cloves, and added a little extra cinnamon, and also added extra pumpkin, grated carrots, raisins, and shredded coconut.  Next time I'll leave out the chocolate chips, too, just to make them a little healthier.  My very picky 5-year-old and husband love them for both breakfast and dessert.

I liked the taste of these muffins, but I did follow other user reviews and doubled all spices and used brown sugar. My muffins stuck really bad to the liners and didn't rise very much.

I doubled the recipe and used Swans Down Cake Flour and sifted it. Used 1/8 cup more flour and 1/4 cup less sugar. Used Ghirardelli Milk Chocolate Chips. ALL Loved it! The neighborhood kids loved them and the mommies and daddys too! Kept coming back for more! Used Betty Crocker Chocolate Cookie Icing (fine tip to allow just a bit of decorative icing and placed 1 chocolate chip on top) Extra Fancy!

Great recipe! I substituted apple sauce for oil and reduced the clove and nutmeg slightly and baked for 22 minutes. My only issue is that the muffins stuck to the muffin liners and I am not sure why. Delicious muffins!

I tried these, and not only wouldn't they come out of the paper cups, but they got very tough and chewy by the second day. I question whether you should really put in both baking soda and powder. I think that is what made them tough.

Had to modify due to allergies (dairy, eggs, & nuts) but these still turned out great!  I used 1/4 C. Earth Fare's organic cinnamon applesauce per egg.  I used EVOO also instead of veg. oil.  The older children kept asking if they could have another.  These were a big hit in our house.

Forgot salt... opps.  Anywho, for my first try I changed up the recipe so I have no way of knowing if doing this improved it or not: added 1/4 t ginger, doubled cloves and nutmeg. Cut chips to a bit more than a 1/3 c. Changed sugar to 1/2 c white 1/4 c brown. Moved temp down to 375 since my oven runs super hot. And the result is...  Not good. They're really quite bland, with quite a spongey texture. I questioned combining chocolate and pumpkin, and perhaps they fundamentally don't belong together? Or perhaps I should've simply followed the recipe to the T - especially for my first whack at it.  Either way, there likely won't be a second whack.

I made these twice in a week they were so good. I can't give it five stars because I took suggestions from other reviewers, but this is definitely going in my recipe box.

I would give the version I made 5 stars...I was afraid they would be bland. So, I put in a cup of white sugar, cup of brown sugar, 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, 1/2 stick of butter.  The first batch I put in 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I think that is too much, so the 2nd batch had 1/2 cup.  With these changes, I thought they were amazing.

This muffin recipe was not very good. I read that many felt it was bland, so i added extra cinammon and even a little ginger. It was still so bland when it came out, though the texture was good. Probably won't make this again

I woke up to a chilly morning in the South suburbs of Chicago this morning and decided to make these for my whole house.  I substituted the apple sauce for the oil, used a sugar substitute for 1/2 c & used un packed 1/4 c  dark brown sugar.  I used a whole cup of pumpkin, one egg & used two whites.  Lastly, I used 1 c of white & 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, & 1 tsp of cinnamon.  My whole house loved them.  My sister hates pumpkin even ate one because I just said they were chocolate chip ones.  Plus, my dad (he hates everything semi healthy) raved about them.  I will be making them again.  :)  Thanks much!

My kids loved these.  I used brown sugar instead of white and a pinch of cloves instead of 1/4 tsp. as I knew too much spice and my children wouldn't like it.  Kids ate them up.  I will use mini chocolate chips next time.

Absolutely delicious and I am not a huge pumpkin muffin fan. I made one batch following the recipe exactly and one batch using applesauce as a sub for the oil. Both batches were so good. I did turn the oven done to 375 per other reviewers' suggestions.

I'm not sure how to rate this.  I think it probably could be 4-5 stars, but I may have made it bad.  I doubled the recipe, and only substituted applesauce for the oil.  They are spongy and the whole bottom half of the muffin sticks to the liner.  Could that substitution be why?  The recipe has the taste potential to be wonderful.

These were amazing. I made small ones and big ones, the small ones were better than the big ones for some reason. My husband took a few to share with his coworkers and they got rave reviews. Thank you so much for such an impressive muffin recipe!

Pretty yummy!  I upped the spices a little due to other reviews, and also made it a bit healthier with the applesauce/whole wheat flour tips suggested by many others.  Used about 3/4 c. mini chocolate morsels, and will probably cut it back to the original 1/2 c. next time.  Felt that it kind of overwhelmed the pumpkin in some of the muffins, but that's my own fault for adding more than the recipe called for.  Since you're making muffins, make sure to use the paper liners (if you choose the liner route) so that you can heat in the microwave in the mornings, if you choose.  Great fall recipe!

These were awesome! I followed the recipe pretty much as written. I doubled the recipe and used slightly more canned pumpkin. I used half apple sauce and half oil and also added some pumpkin pie spice. Next time I'd add more chocolate chips because there weren't quite enough for this chocolate lover. :) They are so delicious though! Very moist. This recipe is a keeper! Thanks Donna.

First time messing with pumpkins, lol. My family and friends love the muffins with or without the chocolate chips, they prefer both. I actually used a fresh pumpkin puree; cut, gutted, baked, and scraped the meat of the pumpkin for this recipe. Just gives it great flavor. I'll definitely be sticking with this recipe. I did add just a tad bit more puree, that's it.

Wonderful! I used only 1/2 cup sugar, substituted applesauce for the oil and used a combination of white and wheat flour. I skipped the cloves because we didn't have any. It works well with mini-chocolate chips.

Just made these tonight. Used quarter cup light brown sugar and half cup white sugar. Turned out really well. Added some melted butter to the batter as well which added moisture and flavor. Will make again.

My family of 6 loved it...I used pumpkin pie filling rather than plain pumpkin filling and then I didn't need to add any spices separately...just left them out and saved a bunch of time...next time, I'll use nuts rather than choc. chips, I bet it will be yummy!

I have made this recipe EXACTLY as written several times and they turn out beautifully! Great texture, very moist, with subtle flavors. I use mini chocolate chips as a matter of preference. Just made a batch last night, brought them into work this morning and within the first hour have had 4 emails requesting the recipe. Thanks so much!

I substituted 1/2 cup of all purpose flour for wheat and as suggested increased the canned pumpkin to 1 cup.  These taste wonderful.  I will make them again.

I made some of the changes other reviewers suggested, such as using applesauce, and using brown sugar instead of white, and I was very disappointed in the muffins. But I have been on a bad muffin streak all summer long! They came out heavy and dense...

These sounded so good one night and I really wanted to make some. But, I didn't have all the ingredients.  I didn't have eggs, oil or applesauce so I used apple butter and a banana for the eggs and oil. I also substituted the sugar for organic Sucranat sugar and the flour to whole wheat flour. I also added allspice, a hint of ginger and a pinch of cardamom.  With these changes, I made the recipe vegan and they were awesome!!! No one knew the difference!

I did not follow the original recipe.  I added apple sauce for the oil, a cup of fresh garden pumpkin, ginger and doubled all the spices.  I was out of cloves and really miss it in the taste of this muffin.  I still agree, these tend to be on the bland side~ The texture is really nice.  When I make these again I will be adding vanilla.  I think that may make a nice difference.

My husband and kids loved them! I tried to make them a little healthier by doing the following:  I added the whole can of pumpkin and 1/4 cup of flax seed. I added one whole egg and one egg white. I also substituted the white sugar with brown sugar. I added 1/4 cup of buttermilk to add some extra moisture.  The texture is great and the taste is good too.

Delicious! This is a great, simple recipe. The muffins come out moist and fluffy. I changed the recipe by substituting applesauce for the oil, doubling the seasonings, increasing chocolate chips to 3/4 cup, and using brown sugar instead of white.

My boys (9 and 7) loved these muffins. I actually offered these with chocolate chip muffins made from a package, and didn't even touch the others.  I did double the recipe because i had a large can of pumkin that needed to be used.  I used 3/4 C of white sugar and 3/4 C of brown sugar and half a bag of choc. chips.  Also used pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon. They turned out perfect.

Great Fall muffin. Even enjoyed by my 6y/o since he thought that the chocolate chips were the bomb (I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips) but I liked the fact that there was pumpkin "hidden" for extra nutrition! These even went over well at his Kindergarten "Harvest/Thanksgiving feast". I followed the recipe as written.

Great recipe! My only change is I'd recommend using mini chocolate chips, and maybe only 1/3 cup. But that really depends on how chocolatey you want them to be. I added a small drizzle of cream cheese frosting as well. I like the Cream Cheese Frostin II recipe also from this site. Delicious!

I thought these were pretty great.  I also followed suggestions from previous reviewers and doubled some of the spices, and I also used brown sugar instead of white.  I made these the night before and heated each one up for a good 15-20 seconds in the microwave the next morning.  Cut them in two and put a little cream cheese on 'em...Mmmm!

These muffins turned out fantastic.  I read the reviews before making, and made some alterations to the recipe.  I used brown sugar instead of white, applesauce instead of oil and used a lot more spice than called for (2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin spice instead of the cloves).  Since I'm a chocolate lover, I used mini chocolate chips and added a bunch more chips than the recipe.  I'm at a higher elevation (5000+) so I baked them at 350 for 19 minutes and they came out perfect.  Great recipe!

Great recipe, got lots of compliments from gals at work.  I used a little less sugar and it was still sweet.  I also added extra spices because I love that fall taste the spices give!

Great recipe! I followed many of the other recommendations from the other reviews. One thing I did change was instead of pumpkin, I used sweet potatoe. It worked out great!!!

I love this recipe! I add a Spice Glaze on top. It is 1 cup of powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons of water and 1/4 teaspoon of mace.  Make sure to wait until the muffins are cooled then drizzle on top! Adds a little something!

not a hit at my house.  i think maybe if i tried walnuts or pecans instead of the choc chips it may work better, but not as is.

These were fabulous.  I switched to 2/3 cup sugar and used 2 duck eggs instead of 2 chicken eggs, and they rose beautifully.  I also switched to bittersweet chocolate chips. I loved the spicy taste.

I can't seem to make these fast enough.  People at my work place are raving about them.  I make mine with whole wheat flour and dark chocolate chips for the added health benefits.  The cinnamon helps to regulate blood sugar, the high fiber in the pumpkin is part of a colon healthy diet, and the dark chocolate adds an antioxidant punch as well as being a smooth muscle relaxant which helps with pain.  AND they taste mighty good.

Great recipe, but I believe that had I stuck to the recipe word for word, it would have been a little bland...I doubled the recipe, (used 3 eggs, not 4 though), added a dash of vanilla extract, and a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice. I made these for my husband's co-workers. Unfortnately, I only got to keep 2 for myself! :)

I doubled it and it was really good. I added a little more cinnamon and sugar to the second batch and that was better. I also used about 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Will make again, maybe add more choco. chips. I also like the idea of no chocolate chips, but instead doing cream cheese frosting. **update: All my friend love love love these and have asked for them multiple times

I thought these muffins were great! I would add more cinnamon and more pumpkin mix the next time I make them. I also made half chocolate chip and half plain. I enjoyed it just plain.

It was a great recipe... I too increased the pumpkin,and with the packed brown sugar instead of the white. I made mini muffins, using mini chocolate chips, added cinnamon, nut meg, cloves, and pumpkin spice. baked for 15 minutes on 375... they were great. by far the best pumpkin muffins I've ever had!!

This is a great recipe! I used about 1& 1/4 cup of fresh pureed pumpkin and omitted the water. Like other reviews I used brown sugar and added more cinnamon for extra spice. I baked at 350 for 20 min, and turned out perfect! I added walnuts and chocolate chips to the top of the muffins only, turtle style. They are soooo yummy! My family and I can't keep our hands off them!

These muffins were ok, but I was expecting them to be out of this world with all of the reviews.  Even with double the spices as many reviewers said, they were only so-so.  Sadly dissappointed..

This is a really good recipe.  I felt like the muffin needed a bit more pumpkin in it though.  I will definitely make this again, and use a whole cup of pumpkin.  Also, I didn't have any ground cloves on hand so I used pumpkin pie spice and extra cinnamon.  Yum!

Very moist.  I added a little more pumpkin and chocolate for extra flavor and they turned out great.  I used fresh pumpkin because I can't get canned pumpkin where I am and the kids loved helping me mash the pumpkin.  Excellent recipe!

I made a few modifications as well:  I used a whole cup of pumpkin instead of .75 c and also added a lot more spices.  I also made them 1/3 whole wheat, but no more, so that they were still fluffy.  I also doubled the recipe and used half of the batter to add apple chunks and streusel on top.  I got that idea from the other highest rated pumpkin muffin recipe on here called "Pumpkin Apple Streusel Muffins," but I sort of made them, "Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Apple Streusel Muffins," ha.  They were AWESOME, I would recommend that to anyone who likes this recipe as well.

I made these per the recipe.  Though the muffin itself was good, I didn't like the chocolate chips.  If I do make these again, I'll use walnuts or pecans instead.

The recipe as it is was a little bland. I took some of the advice from other reviewers and made a few substitutions. I used whole wheat flour, brown sugar and a whole cup of pumpkin. I almost doubled the amount of spices. I didn't have any cloves so I added some pumpkin pie spice instead. I also added about a tsp of vanilla extract. They turned out fantastic! They don't taste alot like pumpkin but I love how spicy and chocolatey they are. I've made these 3 times now and they always get devoured way too quickly lol =)

This recipe is quick and easy and the results are fantastic.  I made mini muffins instead of full size so I used mini chocolate chips.  Great for a snack and my 2 year old loves them for breakfast.

This recipe produces some of the best muffins I have ever tasted. They're moist and fluffy and so good! I love chocolate so I put in a lot but that's what I like. I definitely recommend it if you wanted a nice muffin that's soft. I've made it twice in the last three days, and I'm the only one in my family that eats muffins with chocolate in them. So good, you have to try this one.

Loved this recipe!  I picked up a few good tips from fellow raters (used applesauce instead of oil, added a bit more chocolate and cinamon, and cooked at the lower temp) and they turned out fantastic!  My boyfriend couldn't believe they were made with applesauce :)

I have really enjoyed this recipe even though I converted it to a Gluten Free recipe by substituting a GF flour 1-1.  The spice mix is perfect with the chocolate.  Semi-sweet is definitely the right touch.  I bake this recipe in a 8x8 or 9x9 stoneware dish and they come out great as a cake.

Made it according to recipe.  I may try spraying the cupcake cups next time.  The family LOVED them!  Much better than our local coffee shop and much less expensive.  Perfect to bring to brunches.

My kids liked these but It thought they were sort of dry. Maybe its because I make a pumpkin bread that is very moist and was expecting something like that.

My daughters loved the muffin however the men of the family could get passed the tar taste of pumpkin which we have never had. although I double up on some of the ingredient it was not pleasing to them at all. Next time I will used sweet potatoes not pumpkins mix.

With changes, this is a fairly good muffin.  I followed the advice of numerous users and substituted light brown sugar for white, increased the pumpkin to one cup, and doubled the spices.  I also added a teaspoon of ginger, since I love it so much, and used 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips.  I might decrease the amount next time, though, as I think the chocolate overpowered the pumpkin taste.  We really liked these, though!  They made the whole house smell great, and they taste good the next day, too.  Will make again.

I made these for Thanksgiving and everyone liked them. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added some extra spice, and I used mini chocolate chips. I did not frost these muffins, as I felt they were sweet enough already with the chocolate chips. I will make these again.

Followed the changes others suggested: 1 c. pumpkin, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, rest follows recipe. Will probably try to add some ginger next time. They are a little on the dense side.

I'm sorry, but I didn't like these like other people did.  They tasted kinda bland.  I did use applesauce intead of oil like other suggested.  I usually do this on recipes that call for oil.  I only had wheat flour so I used that so maybe that's why they didn't taste to good.  Also, when you bake them watch them.  Mine didn't even cook for 20 min. and were done.  My kids did like them, so I may try them again with regular flour.

Moist, yummy and not too sweet. I made these as tiny cupcakes with chocolate icing for my oldest's birthday at daycare and despite the fact that I'd made enough to feed two classrooms' worth, none were left when my husband picked up the boys from daycare. The other reason these were a hit: NO ALLERGENS! My son's teacher raved about them and asked me for the recipe!

YUM!!!  All in one word!  I, too, added another 1/4 cup of pumpkin as it was what I had leftover and wanted to keep the moisture.  I also added a splash of real maple syrup.  I thought this might add some flavor because I'd had no dried spices left, other than cinnamon.  It did add a bit of flavor and moisture.  The cooking time went MUCH faster than listed too...just keep an eye on that.  I used these at a bake fair this morning and heard many compliments!  Would recommend these and this is a "keeper" at my house!

AWESOME muffins.  Followed directions exactly.  They were plenty "spiced" for our taste.  I did use mini choc chips, and they didn't sink to the bottom, were perfectly distributed.  I had some leftover canned pumpkin from Thankgiving and this was the perfect use for it.  Will be making these again and again.  Oh, mine only baked for 20 minutes and were perfect.

Fabulous muffins!!  I LOVE chocolate but in this, less is more.  I found the chocolate chips overpowered the muffins a little.  I used minis and in my 3rd batch cut out about 1/3 of the total amount called for.  They were perfect.  A little chocolate in every bite, but not too much.  All 48 muffins I made on Thursday are gone Monday!

These were a huge hit with my kids!  I made mini muffins out of them, frosted them with cream cheese frosting, and put some sprinkles on top.  My kids couldn't get enough of them. I also used fresh pumpkin instead of canned. Will make again and again.

Really good. I doubled the recipe and added one small can of pumpkin -- more would have been fine. Baked up beautiful and moist.

I really liked these. I think next time I will omit the chocolate chips and use nuts. I made several changes to this. I used brown sugar instead of white and orange juice instead of water which made it taste better.

They came out a little bland but they still tasted good. I read some reviews of others and will try some of their suggestions like using applesauce instead of vegetable oil and using more spices and pumpkin.

Really delicious. I've also made this without chocolate chips. It's easy to double the recipe so you can use a whole can of pumpkin. A great winter breakfast!

Following reviewers advice, I increased the pumpkin to 1 cup.  Instead of using all those different spices, which I dont have cloves anyway.  I just used a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice.  Used applesauce in place of oil and butterscotch chips instead of chocolate. They were delicious!  I would definately make these again.  So moist!

Okay, so I thought,hmmmm, if applesauce is my usual substitute for oil, how rockin' would my(ahem)HOMEMADE APPLE BUTTER(supreme apple butter from this sight, yeah, I know I'm bragging)be? It worked beautifully. I doubled the recipe, used mini chips, and extra pumpkin. Next time I might try the cinnamon chip, or even leave the chips out. I think the pumpkin flavor is really hidden, even with the extra I added. Great recipe!

This tasted really yummy. I took other reviewers' advice and upped the spices a little and substituted applesauce for oil. I think I cooked them a little too long (just over 15 minutes for mini muffins) so next time I'll bake them for less time. I might add a little more applesauce too, to make them a little more moist. Thanks for a great recipe!

My 4-yr old and I really enjoyed these!
.
As other's suggested:  I used 1 cup pumpkin, brown sugar instead of white, and doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also used whole wheat flour - so all in all these came out to be pretty healthy and tasty muffins.
.
4 stars because my toddler didn't eat it.

Delicious!  I substituted applesauce for the oil and added about 2 tbls of ground flax.  I also substituted dark brown sugar for the white.  I used the entire can of pumpkin - what was I going to do with a little bit?  They turned out great!  I also used about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips and "wetted" them as another reviewer suggested and then coated them in the flour mixture so they didn't sink.  I also doubled the cinnamon and the nutmeg.  Before baking, I sprinkled them with raw sugar for a little crunch on top.  I baked them for 22 minutes at 375 and I live at ~5000 feet.  They are moist and delicious.  They are heavy from all of the pumpkin, but not dense.  Very nutritious!  I will make again and send the recipe to friends.

These muffins are really good! I also made a few substitutions to make the treats a bit healthier: whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose and double the applesauce instead of vegetable oil. I used a whole cup of pumpkin and since I didn't have any cloves I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg. The muffins were great right out of the oven and I can't wait to try them after they've had a chance to mellow! Next time I will use brown sugar in place of white for a deeper flavor. :)

I've made this twice now.  I really wanted to like them based on all the rave reviews, but I am just not a big fan of pumpkin.  I give the recipe 5 stars for rising well, being moist and having a good density.  Also, my husband really liked them.  The only change I made was to use brown sugar instead of white.  If you like pumpkin, you will love these muffins.

Wonderful.  Made these like written except added 1 cup dark chocolate chips.  Will decrease the nutmeg next time, a little too much for us. Try eating them warmed up, they're great on a crisp fall day.

Made these with friends and they were tasty. Increased the spices except for the nutmeg and added ginger, rice milk instead of the water, vanilla, brown sugar, and for 1/2 of the flour we used spelt. Nice texture, puffy and not overly dense.

I made these for a for a school fundraiser. I did not use the traditional muffin pan.  I used the muffin top pan to make the muffins.  I lowered the temp. to 350 and baked for 12 min.  They turned out perfect.  I doubled the recipe, it made 16 muffin tops. Perfect. I hope they sell!!!  Thank you for the recipe Donna!!

I used pumpkin pie spice, 2 heaping teaspoons.  I also threw in some white chocolate chips I had in the cabinet in addition to chocolate chips.  I made these as mini muffins.  I doubled the recipe and brought about 50 mini muffins to my son's Boy Scout meeting.  There were only about 10 kids plus parents and the muffins were GONE in less than 10 minutes.  Great recipe!!!

Yummy!  I've been wanting to try these ever since sampling one at a Starbucks.  Of course I can't follow a recipe to save my life, so I made the following modifications based on what I had on hand: 1 c. whole wheat, 1/2 c. white flour; applesauce instead of oil, 1/2 cup sugar; doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg; omitted the cloves; added 1 t. ground ginger; added an extra big dollop of canned pumpkin; used 2 broken-up organic expresso dark chocolate bars, making chunks more than chips.  They made 6 jumbo muffins.  My only disappointment was they didn't taste "pumpkiny" enough.  So I'm thinking next time I'll use pumpkin pie puree or get the spice instead to add.

A very nice sweet morning treat!  I made some adjustments to suit our needs and the muffins still turned out very well.  I used 1/2 c. turbinado sugar, white whole wheat flour in place of the all purpose flour, and pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves (as it was what I had on hand.)  I will try brown sugar next time as other have suggested.  My boys (1 & 3) loved them!  I also used Enjoy Life chocolate chips (they are mini ones.)  And I baked them in a mini muffin tin for about 14 minutes.  Will definitely keep this recipe.  Thanks!

I never considered the combination of chocolate and pumpkin until I saw it. It's great.  Easy to make, fairly quick, and a great fall treat.  My whole family has given this recipe their approval to add to our collection.

This is a great recipe that turns out moist and beautiful. I've made them a couple times and must say that they are much better without the choc. chips. You must know that I am a total chocoholic, but the chocolate overpowers the fabulous pumpkin flavor. These muffins taste best with chopped pecans instead, everything else, follow as directed. They're great!

Addictive! These are SO good; we just love them. I did use packed brown sugar in place of the white sugar and I also realized I was out of nutmeg. I threw some pumpkin pie spice in instead and it worked great. I used mini chocolate chips, as that I made mostly mini muffins. The only thing I would chage next time would be to double the recipe because these go fast! Thanks!

These muffins were very good.  They did lack a bit of flavor so I will probably add more spices next time. I did double the cinnamon and nutmeg though. I didn't use chocolate chips for preference, if I had they might have had more flavor.

I thought these were OK.  They did have a lot of pumpkin flavor which was fine but I definetley did not like the chochlate chips in them.

I also used brown sugar instead of white and added coconut (1/4 cup) to make these tasty treats even more delightful!

This was an okay recipe. It would have been better without the chocolate chips. Maybe replace the chips with raisins or pecans.

Added 1 tsp of pumpkin spice for a little extra kick and special dark chocolate to compliment the deep flavors.  This is a sensational fall recipe!

I was so excited to try this recipe, and chose it after looking at other similar recipes on this site.  I thought the combo of pumpkin and chocolate would be great.  Unfortunately, these just didn't do it for me, they were too bland (even after adding additional spices as others suggested).  I tried to pawn them off to my parents, but they ended up tossing them.  Next time maybe I will try the recipe that uses applesauce.

These were ok.  I made them like the recipe said except used whole wheat flour instead of white flour and I found that they were not real moist, like I would expect pumpkin muffins to be.  They have good flavor, I am just not thrilled with the texture. I think I will keep searching for moister recipe.

Really good, but I must agree with "craftlady" in that they were a bit chewy. Not a bad thing, but just different from what I'm used to in a muffin. Took other reviewers advice and added a whole cup of chips. My baby girl who's home from college this weekend and our older daughter loved them and truthfully, that's all I care about. Thank you Donna!

These muffins had a great spice-taste, but they were a little chewy. I used applesauce instead of oil and brown sugar instead of white sugar. I used about 2/3rds cup of mini-choclate chips and a whole cup of pumpkin. 
I also baked them at 350 degrees for 18 mins and the recipe made 33 mini muffins.
I'm taking these into work tomorrow - I hope they like them!

These were very good.  I used fresh pumpkin and doubled the batch.  They were gone in less then 2 days.  I will add a bit more pumpkin and spices next time as I thought they could have been a bit more flavorful.  The kids however thought they were perfect.

Soo good...they look like coffee shop!  I used 1 cup pumpkin, 2 1/4 Watkin's pumpkin pie spice, and baked the batter in jumbo muffin tins (increased the time by 5 min.) at 350.  Making more as I write!

delicious! I used ghiradelli chocolate and added a bit more cinnamon and chocolate and they just melted in my mouth.  My mom thought I put too much chocolate in them, but I love them and I know my boyfriend is going to devour them! Thanks!

I made these today, using whole wheat flour, pumpkin pie spice, mini chips, etc.  I made them with oil this time, will try applesauce the next time I make them.  They came out perfect - very nice flavor, and are moist.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made these with and without the chocolate chips and they turn out wonderful.  I also substitute applesauce for the oil to make it a lower fat version.  I usually make 12 mini muffins and 9 large.  These would probably taste good with a glaze like other recipes list.

These muffins came out perfect and tasted yummy.  I sent some to a party with my son and all the boys ate them right up and the Mother asked for the recipe.  It's a great way to get pumpkin in the kids too.

They were great; I took the advice of others and increased the amount of spices. I used extra light olive oil in place of the vegetable oil (I didn't have any veg. oil on hand), and they still turned out great. I might increase the amount of pumpkin to 1 cup next time, as the pumpkin taste was really subtle.

This one's a keeper.  All I had to for my non-chocolate eating husband was substitute the chocolate chips with bluebarries and he was converted.  I've tried different size loaves and with a slight veriation in baking time all have come out successfully.  When I want to make some for me and my husband, I simply sprinkle on the chips or berries after dividing the batter and gently fold them in with a small rubber spatula.

These are good, but kind of strange... I'm not sure I like the pumpkin/nutmeg/clove taste combined with the chocolate. They turn out very attractive (dark orange) and have a perfect texture, but the taste combo just doesn't do it for me. I probably won't make these again.

These turned out very moist and flavorful. Everyone loved them when I gave them out around Halloween. I'm very glad I made a double batch, because all of them were gone by the end of the day.

I made these this morning with my 3 year old son; less than 12 hours later, there are only 3 of them left.  Everyone here just loves them!  The only alteration we made to the recipe was putting in a full cup of chocolate chips.  The next time I make these, I will definitely be doubling the recipe (or maybe even quadrupling it, since I buy big cans of pumpkin from E.D. Smith).  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

These muffins were very tasty with or without butter added.  Wonder if adding walnuts would throw the taste off too much?

I also substituted brown for the white sugar. They were tasty, but not really the texture I was looking for. Although moist when you bit into them, they we’re a little “rubbery” on the outside… but with that said, everyone still seemed to love them and I received many compliments. I would try them again but perhaps experiment with oven temperate?

Great, easy recipe.  Made mini muffins to take to work - so substituted mini chocolate chips (not quite the 1/2 cup it calls for) and it made about 30.  The mini muffins took less than 10 minutes to bake.  Cute and delicious!

I made them according to the recipe and absolutely LOVE them! Even my 15 year old likes them although he doesn't like pumpkin! Next time I will use a little less nutmeg, was a bit to much for my taste but otherwise they ROCK! Moist and chocolatey!

Excellent! They turned out great - firm and moist, and I loved the chocolate chips! The second time I made them, however they were pretty dry. I might change it up a nit.

I took the advice of others and doubled the recipe - and I'm very glad I did because veryone really liked these. I might play with the spices, substitute some oil with applesauce, and include some whole wheat flour to make them healthier...but the original recipe is very tasty.

This is one of my children's favorite muffins.  The flavor combination sounded strange at first, but now they are hooked and request these more often than any other kind of muffin I make.  These are also delicious without the chocolate chips.  I use frozen fresh pumpkin which I process myself and they always turn out perfectly.

These muffins were great!  They were nice and moist, and they fell right out of my muffin tin instead of sticking (yeah!).  I will definitely make these again.  I agree that it would be a good idea to double the receipe and make 24 muffins because I threw away about half a can of pumpklin.

These are quite nice.  I added a dash of ginger to the recipe.  I'm not sure if it added a lot but it certainly didn't detract.  The spicy pumpkin is an interesting contrast to the choc chips.  At first I wasn't sure I liked it but after two-or-three (I made mini-muffins) I was hooked.  Best of all, my two and four year old LOVED them!  That's saying something.

I made these muffins last night and shared them with friends.  They were very moist due to the pumpkin and contained very little oil.  Thanks Donna!!

Great, easy recipe.  Sweet enough that my picky four-year old will eat them, but not overpowering.  I omitted the cloves, and these muffins still taste like a great traditional spiced-Autumn treat.  Not too dense, but hearty enough to be used for Thanksgiving brunch or anytime!

I used whole-wheat flour instead of all-purpose and they were still excellent! Also added about 1/4 c of canned pumpkin and used Splenda in place of sugar and Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet. Yum.

Very moist and very good.  I did add about 1/4 cup more pumpkin, used Splenda for the sugar and didn't add cloves, but added pumpkin pie spice instead.  I also added one chopped apple. Can I still give it five stars if I changed it?  I did notice that the muffins stuck to the paper liners a bit, even after they cooled. Maybe a spray of Pam next time would work. Thanks for sharing, Donna.

Very YUMMY!!!  I used Pampered Chef Cinnamon Plus instead of the spices.  This recipe is a keeper!

EDIT: I made these for the 3rd time with Nestle Swirls Chip with chocolate and caramel.  Even better!!!

This is a perfect pumpkin muffin recipe. I left out the chocolate chips and added chopped walnuts and raisins.  I am going to experiment with this recipe tomorrow and use egg whites in place of whole eggs, and applesauce in the oil's place. I follow Weight Watchers and if that works out, it will take the muffins from 4 points each to 2 points each. Also, I thought cloves were a little strong so I will try using pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices.

Everyone loves these muffins no matter when I make them.  They are moist and delicious especially if you pop them in the microwave and heat them slightly.  This is a real winner of a recipe.

Mmmm!  These turned out GREAT, I made half with chocolate chips and half without.  I didn't have cloves so I threw in 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  Very interesting recipe.  If you don't think pumpkin and chocolate go together, you really need to try this.  It will change your mind!

A little bland but I used mint chocolate chips and they addded some 'kick'. I'd add more spices next time too, I think.

I added more of the spices to have an extra kick and threw a little ginger in there too.   I had so much pumpkin I made three batches over the course of the week and still had some extra from that big can!  Very good recipe, the people at work devoured these and they were easy to make.   Cooking time for me only took 20 minutes on the money.

Good and moist.  Added 1 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. Baked in a dark muffin pan so decreased temp to 350 degrees!  Great recipe batter is not too sweet!

I loved this recipe.  I lowered the temperature to 375, and used cinnamon baking chips instead of the chocolate.  I also used 1 tsp. of Pumpkin Pie mixed spice instead of the individual spices.  I took 2 dozen of these to a Girl Guide camp and the girls prefered these over the store-bought muffins!  I will make another batch tomorrow...they're perfect for rainy autumn weather.

These were so good!  I took the suggestion of using cinnamon chips instead of choc - wonderful!  What a great way to get pumpkin (an amazingly healthy food!) into your diet!  My kids love them!

Very good muffins. I made mine with cinnamon chips instead of chocolate chips. The nice thing about these is they come out nice and fluffy compared to most pumpkin muffins which I find a bit dence. I also added 1 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice in place of the seperate spices. These will be wonderful on a chilly Autumn day with a cup of hot mulled cider!

This recipe was pretty good overall.  I don't know what changes I would make, but the pumpkin is a little too heavy for muffins.  If anyone has any suggestions, I'd appreciate hearing them because I like this but it's just not quite right for muffins.
