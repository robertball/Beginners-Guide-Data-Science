Made this tonight with venison round steaks. Yummy, but spicy!  Honestly, this recipe is one of the best I've tried for that particular cut of meat.  It covered the gamey taste, for sure.  I couldn't find ancho chile powder at the store, so used chipotle powder instead, in the same proportions.  I do believe that was too much heat.  I will definitely make this again, using much less chile powder.

Hands down, this made the best venison dish I have ever had. The lime-cilantro butter was amazing and the chili rub gave it just the right amount of heat. I added a little fresh chopped garlic to the butter just because I love garlic. YUM!

I used beef steaks, but I am always searching for new ways to make it as it is a highly requested meal in my home.  I loved the ancho chili powder idea.  It is one of my favorite spices.  All the flavors combined well for a delicious steak!

Loved the simplicity and flavor of this recipe.  The "steak seasoning" that I used contained WAY too much salt for my taste, so next time I will be more careful to choose a seasoning with less salt.  Grilled on the Big Green Egg to medium rare perfection.

Delicious!! I used spicy Montreal Steak Seasoning and with the Ancho chili it worked out excellent.   The recipe makes a tonnnn of butter, that is very strong lime/cilantro flavored.  Tastes great but could def cut down the serving a bit, I still have a lot left. Thank you very much.

real good. not alot of fuss, easy to prepare. the ancho, and the butter mix put this baby over the top. works with beef steak as well as deer. be sure to use ancho chile powder, you cant use to much of this stuff. if you like cilantro use extra, its some tough stuff. a keeper.

Made this with some mule deer backstrap. I cleaned as much membrane/silver skin off as I could, then soaked the venison in milk for a couple of hours before cooking. 

The rub alone was great.  I had to powderize some ancho pods as I couldn't locate powdered Ancho at any stores.  

I added a little garlic powder to the butter.  The butter is what put this over the top.  

Everyone who had it commented that it was some of the best steak (from any animal) they have ever eaten.  I agree!
