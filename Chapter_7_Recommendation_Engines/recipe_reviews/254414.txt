My husband wanted me to find a no-bake cheesecake recipe that has late mother used to make for him as a child. I'm happy to say that this was it! I made it exactly as the recipe states and topped it off with a can of cherry pie filling. I set the cheesecake up in a springform pan but will likely put it in a pie plate next time as it is a bit on the soft side.
