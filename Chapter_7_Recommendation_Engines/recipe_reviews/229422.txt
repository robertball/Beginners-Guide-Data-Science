Oh man. This one was well named. It was quite ugly... but super delicious! My family of three went crazy over it! Even the picky toddler! Six very enthusiastic thumbs up! 
My blue cheese was homemade, and we prefer sweet onions over pearl. Only two things that I did differently. I'll be making this again, and again, and again.....

Perfect as is!!  Check after an hour though - I used a 3 pound roast and was a bit over done at 90 minutes.  GREAT recipe.

I made this in the crockpot and it turned out wonderfully. My husband and my parents loved it. I cut back on the cayenne pepper.
