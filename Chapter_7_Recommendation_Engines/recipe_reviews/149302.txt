I wasn't too sure about this, but I had some baguettes I made that I wasn't pleased with, so I figured what the heck.  It sounded good, just worried about me not liking the sogginess of the bread.  Well, I don't mind it at all!  Very tomato-y, and it could probably benefit from longer simmering, but very yummy.  I used dried herbs because I was too impatient to wait until I went to the store.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this soup as a base.  You can create many more flavorful soups out of it.  I, personally, do not like mushy bread so I omit the bread in the soup.  Instead, I get a nice loaf of italian or french bread and slice it up, put butter and parmesan cheese on it and toast it.  I use beef broth in place of the chicken broth and I also add two cans of fire roaasted tomatoes.  I cook some elbow pasta and add that to my soup.  I then top it all off in the bowl with the parmesan cheese and serve it with the toasted bread.

My best friend and I had tomato bread soup when we were traveling in Florence, Italy, and it was amazing. We've been looking for a way to recreate it ever since. This recipe comes pretty close. I don't think the bread I used was stale enough, as the consistency was a little too soggy for me. My boyfriend, however, loved it! Will definitely be making this one again!

Really tasty and easy to make.  I added more parsley (because I had it), and a little less stock (thicker seemed better).

I made this soup yesterday using basil right out of my garden - kept having to add more and more since I didn't measure well.  And I used dried parsley and no cheese.  The bread was only partially stale - with some soft pieces.   This is a wonderful soup if you chop the bread small enough. My wife said they were like dumplings - will dice smaller next time.   And I will be using this for our Soup Kitchen for the needy with sausage or other meat.   Thank you so much for the recipe.

This was so good.  I followed the recipe exactly and I loved it.  Next time I will try this soup without the bread and add chicken and pasta instead.  This soup is a great base to try other things.

I just made this and had to come back to review.  A+ for quick and delish!  So easy.  I didn't have any fresh garlic and it was fine without.  Did a 4 c of water instead of 6  of veggie broth to have a bit more tomato flavor based on our preference.  Veggie broth as we are meatless here.

I thought this was very very tasty and if you're looking for a tomato soup without added sugar and cream this is perfect! I only gave it four stars because the bread came out very very soggy and very dumpling-ish. I like the idea of serving the toasted bread on top after the soup is done. The olive oil toasted bread cubes are so yummy.

I made this almost exactly. I too am not fond of soggy bread, so I toasted 4 slices of French bread, cubed it & put it in to boil in the pot. I figured as it softened it would thicken the broth. It did. But I cubed & toasted my stale baguette with the olive oil plus salt & pepper. These I used to stir into each bowl as I served it. I did add 1/2C of parmesan, plus salt&pepper to taste. Other than that, it was Delish! I think more garlic would be nice. Each time I got a little bit of the sauteed garlic, it was so yummy, I just thought it would have been nice to have it in each bite. And an addition of browned sausage chunks would send it over the top.

I have been making this soup for a few year - it is wonderful!  I don't even mess with the recipe, except to add salt and pepper.  Delicious!

This is a really nice base. I felt like it was missing something for a full meal, so I added two and a half sweet Italian chicken sausages, and it was a nice weekday dinner.

Frankly, I love this recipe.  I’m not exactly a cook let alone a “chef” so anytime I can find something that is easy, but unique and flavorful it’s exciting.  I had a left over Italian baguette which I hated throwing out and found this recipe.  Mostly, I followed it to the letter except added extra tomato, broth, cheese and basil.  I copied someone’s else’s suggestion to use a combo of cheese so I added Romano and Parmesan.  This is really good.  It’s best if you steep it longer and to let all of the flavors combine thoroughly. For any of you at the novice cook level – go ahead and try it you will be pleased
