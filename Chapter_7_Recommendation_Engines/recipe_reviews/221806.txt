This would be much better with real homemade fries... The sauce wasn't right either, nothing like a real Quebec poutine.

Loved it! I could not find cheese curds anywhere, so I did use the suggested mozzarella instead. The gravy came together very easily and tasted great. The family devoured these! I will be keeping my eyes opened for the curds, as I would love to try them. This is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I couldn't get the consistency right for this, however, it was still delicious. We all thoroughly enjoyed it with the mozzarella cheese. Looked for cheese curds but have had no luck so far. Will keep looking though!

Nice short cut to the gravy. But use Beef Stock to make a true version of the the Canadian Gravy. It is thicker and delicious.

Couldn't find cheese curds so we used bleu cheese crumbles in one batch & feta in another, with crisp bacon crumbles & shredded parmesan to top the gravy. We loved it!

Great recipe, even with the fry shortcut. I've tried it with baked fries, and it works well with you spray them with a bit of olive or coconut oil to get that tender crisp texture needed to make the poutine authentic. The gravy is excellent. I am from Eastern Ontario but live in Missouri now and I agree that fresh curd is near impossible to find. If you splurge on some fresh mozzarella in a package with the liquid it is pretty good, but try asking your grocer if he's willing to order some curd, it's so worth it!
