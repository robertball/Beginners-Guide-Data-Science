Hummus was the only thing that I made, I didn't mean to revamp the recipe, but the main ingredient is so expensive at 8.00 a jar, so I used already made garlic hummus. I added it to the food processor along with 1 full bunch of cilantro and about 1/4 teaspoon chipole powder and 1/2 teaspoon onion powder and a pinch of salt and mixed. It was so simple and tasted just like Panera's . My son loves it, saids it taste better!

Found the hummus to be a far too salty. Had to add tahini, oil, lemon juice to cut it. I like the idea, though.

This was rather bland hummus. I added more cilantro and paprika, but it still was salty and otherwise tasteless.

Yummy! Great fillng lunch! I did leave the tahini and feta cheese off, to make a lower fat version. Plus I am not a big fan of how tahinni paste changes the flavor of hummus. Added less fresh cilantro so as not to over power the whole sandwich; glad I did. Plus I didn't notice until too late the hummus spread called for minced garlic, and garlic powder. Would have added more minced and no garlic powder. Other than those small tweaks, I loved this recipe!

Very reminiscent of "p-bread". I didn't really change anything, except I did the marinated veggies called for + avocado slices. And I added only half of the salt called for in the hummus. This one is a keeper, great weeknight dinner.

I make just the hummus and always have some on hand around our house. We eat it on a rgular basis with toasted pita points. It makes a great snack for my 2-year-old.

The sandwich is great, though I used a little less red wine vinegar for the dressing (just my preference--I find it too strong). The hummus is very yummy itself, though I added more oil, garlic, and cilantro for taste.

I only made the hummus but it was wonderful!  Better than the cilantro hummus I buy at Whole Foods.  I used the liquid from the chick peas to thin it out a bit.  I served this at a party this last weekend and everyone loved it.

Delicious and just like my favorite sandwich at Panera Bread.  I used salt to taste in the hummus so I didn't measure 1 tsp.  I found this to be flavorful and filling.  Great for a summer time lunch.

This was amazing and identical to that famous bakery!  It made quite a bit of hummus which was great as I was able to pop it in the fridge and use it in another recipe!  Yum!  We made ours on a piecie of fresh Naan and folded it over.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe hit the spot!!  We love this sandwich from a coffee shop.  I did include sweet peppers as well.  I also put a little tomato pesto on the bread because I couldn't find the Tomato Basil Bread.  We used a Foccacia instead.  Lastly, my Tahini was out of date but I had store bought hummus and processed the cilantro in that!

This sure was messy! I feel like mine needed to go into a pita pocket. 
I changed it to suit my tastes which excluded the tomato, subbed zucchini for the cucumber, used sweet onion, and added diced celery and avocado slices. And it was yummy!!

I didn't make the sandwich but I made the Hummus, Boy was it a hit, even with those who didn't know what hummus was and were afraid of the strong scent of the Cilantro. Everyone who tried it really enjoyed it and I didn't change a thing...THIS IS AWESOME

This is the best hummus I have tasted, and I have tried a lot of them. What it needs is a tsp. of olive oil in the end.Loved the sandwich too......5 stars all the way!

This IS really really good.  I was a little skeptical with the strong sesame oil and cilantro.  I marinated the veggies overnight in the liquid.  I did change the hummus recipe and followed my favourite (hummus III from this site), and added cilantro to the batch.  I also served it with sprouts on a whole grain pita.  Really Great!  I will make this again and again.  VERY refreshing, perfect for spring/summer veggies.
