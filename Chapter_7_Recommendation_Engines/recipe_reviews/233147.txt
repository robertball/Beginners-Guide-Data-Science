Need to tweak the recipe a bit.  Even out almond flour and shredded coconut to 1 cup each and cut coconut oil to 4 tablespoons.  Substitute 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder in place of the almond extract and you get chocolate coconut goodness!

I found these to be very sweet! I don't have a food processor, so I put the ingredients in my Vitamix on speed 5 and processed them with the tamper about 20-25 seconds. I don't care for almond extract, so I reduced it to 1/4 tsp. However, I actually thought the mixture tasted much better before adding it. The almond meal gave it enough "natural" almond flavor, which I prefer. I used a cookie scoop, and they kept their shape. However, they never seemed to dry out after baking or holding them in the oven for 8 hours. I had to finally freeze them to get them to hold shape. I thought they were okay, but others found the almond extract flavor also too strong even though it was reduced. I got 18 total, but most unfortunately most did go to waste.

I had a gluten-free friend who is also dairy-free come to dinner, so I made these. They were tasty, but they did not dry out. Another Allrecipe reply suggested that they be refrigerated, so that's what I did. They firmed up enough to eat, but by the end of dessert, they had softened up. It is a recipe I'm glad I tried, but I will not make these again.
