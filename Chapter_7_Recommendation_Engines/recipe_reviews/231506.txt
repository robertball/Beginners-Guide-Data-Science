I made this delicious pie for my dad’s birthday.  I made this as written using a Pillsbury® Pie Crust.  It does need to be made AT LEAST an hour before serving so that the cream layer can set up.  Otherwise, your pieces will not cut nicely.  My pie set for an hour and a half and I could not get a pretty piece of pie.  After the pie was in the refrigerator all night, the cream cheese layer had time to set properly and the pieces cut and served very nicely.  With strawberries just starting to appear in our groceries, I know I will be making this one again.  I will plan on making early in the morning, or refrigerate overnight before serving.

I selected this recipe because I sent someone to the store and instead of getting brick cream cheese, they got strawberry cream cheese spread, in a tub. I needed to regroup and could not make the cheesecake I had planned to make. So, this recipe looked like something that I could adapt using the spread. It worked. I used 2 tubs (8 oz) of the strawberry cream cheese spread, added all the other ingredients, except the vanilla and the cinnamon (I added a TBSP of Chambord) and made my own crust and glaze. All I can say is this recipe is a keeper.  Even though I changed this recipe out of necessity, I bet the original is delicious too. Thanks for the recipe Paniece.

Excellent! Of course, I'm always a sucker for fresh strawberry pie. I made my own crust b/c the store bought ones taste just like grocery store pie. Hmmm... imagine that! I also made my own glaze and let it be a bit chunky. As a result, the strawberry topping turned out not quite as firm as I'd hoped, but that was no fault of this recipe. I'll just add a bit more cornstarch next time. The cream filling was divine, and as the name of the recipe indicates, this pie truly is "to die for". I'm making another tomorrow to take to a benefit dinner!

I really wanted to like this pie but the cinnamon completely overwhelmed the flavor.  My husband agreed with me.  I don't think this pie even needs cinnamon in it.  Next time I will omit it all together and try it again.
**update 3/25/16 - I've made this dessert many times now without the cinnamon and it is perfect!!!

Always weight watching and frequently short on time, I bought sugarfree strawberry glaze in the produce department, used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and picked up a Keebler shortbread crust - mentioned by someone as a tasty alternative to homemade. I halved the cinnamon and used about half of the glaze. The pie was finished in a flash. It traveled well to a Memorial Day picnic and cut cleanly after only a couple of hours of chilling. Most importantly, everyone's reaction was the same - "amazing dessert." Amazing, quick, and pretty healthy!! Thanks for sharing this delicous recipe, Paniece.

Made 2 of these pies for 4th of July! Very easy, my only tip is to mix the cream cheese & cinnamon mixture really well before incorporating into the whipped cream. If not, you'll have little cinnamon explosions when you eat it.

I did make some changes to this delicious recipe. I couldn't bring myself to using packaged glaze so I made my own.  After reading the reviews and the unintentional change in cream cheese, I purposely uses strawberry cream cheese to further enhance the strawberry flavor. My six-yr old son is in love with the cream cheese layer!  The homemade glaze was a marriage made in Heaven with the sliced berries. Simply delicious!!

This pie was delicious! Everyone in my family loved it and was upset that I had only made one. The filling is what made this a special treat. I agree with another review, you need to let this pie sit in the refrigerator for longer than an hour. Will defintely make again and again.

I only give this 4 stars because I think a graham cracker crust would've been tastier.  I followed the recipe exactly and liked everything except the crust.  I needed more sweet and I think the graham cracker crust would've made the difference.  THANK YOU so much for sharing!!!!  Definitely one of my husbands favorites, but with graham cracker.

Simply delicious. This recipe is a keeper. I did make one small addition. When my pie crust cooled, I spread a layer of melted chocolate over the whole crust to keep it crispy for the cream cheese filling and strawberry topping. I also made my own glaze. Fantastic recipe.

This pie is delicious! Wonderful! I made my own glaze instead of buying it at the store but other than that made it as stated. I did hesitate to add the cinnamon but did use it and I am glad I did. I used fresh strawberries and sliced them. I will definitely make it again.

The store bought glaze was flavorless and the cream was over powering. You couldn't taste the strawberries. My family did not like it. I had to throw it out. This is the first Allrecipe that I didn't like.

I made this exactly as the recipe directed and it is fabulous. My husband said it was right up there with my pecan pie and may be even better. I used delicious strawberries we bought at the farmers market. This will become one of my favorite recipes. Thanks!

Delicious! My neighbor brought me a bucket of strawberries and I've always wanted to make a strawberry pie. I used a graham cracker crust because I didn't want to use my oven. The cream is light not heavy considering the cream cheese and I didn't mind the cinnamon. Maybe next time I might use a little lemon zest to give it a zing instead. I let my pie sit 4 hours before serving and it didn't hold together when I served it. I didn't mind still tastes good! oh yes if you are looking for strawberry glaze it should be in the produce section next to the strawberries I did look everywhere else first.

Excellent.  Only change I made was to double pie filling as I did not feel the first batch satisfactorily filled shell.  I did not find cinnamon to be over powering as other viewers had commented.  In fact I could barely detect it.  Very mild.

Thank you Paniece! We all loved it and have added it to our recipe box. This is sure to become a family legend favorite recipe. It has the perfect combination of sweetness with the cream cheese and the crunch of the baked crust.

Great recipe, although next time I’ll make it in a 10” shell. 9” was a bit too small for the filling and berries.

Very easy to make. I didn't have strawberry glaze mix, so I just used the strawberry glaze recipe from Allrecipes. The strawberry glaze recipe said to crush strawberries using a potato masher, but I just placed the strawberries in my nutribullet for a few seconds to mash them up. I used frozen crust from Marie Calendar's and it was just the right size and flavor.

Made my own crust and halved the strawberry glaze. Next time I will make my own strawberry glaze. The store bought glaze is awful. I'm sure it will be a 5 star with homemade glaze!

Yum! Yum!
I doubled the recipe with the exception of the glaze and cinnamon.  One tub of glaze is very generous. I was unsure if the cinnamon was going to overwhelm.  It didn’t so next time I will use the full amount.  I also used a 10” graham cracker crust. I prefer it for this type of pie. 
So EASY!!! I sliced the strawberries in half or thirds.   I made sure the whipped cream was a little more than “just starting to get thick”.  I also piped a swirl of the cream filling in the center of the finished pie and put a strawberry dipped in the glaze in the center of it.   I put it in the refer over night and it cut beautifully. Took it for dessert to a “Moving” party. It was a huge hit! Thank you for such an easy and very delicious treat!

Delicious pie! I think next time I will leave off the cinnamon or maybe cut it in half, I will definitely be making again.

This pie is really delicious. I made only slight changes. I used only an eighth tsp. of cinnamon because cinnamon is not my favorite thing. Also, I made my own glaze. Because I was doing a lot of cooking today, I bought a pie shell, but next time I will make my own. You can't go wrong with this pie - it's yummy.

People love when I make this piece. I made changes no cinnamon, extra sugar and vanilla, I use strawberry pie filling instead of glaze. I also use graham cracker crust not the recipe one. Also it does better overnight in refrigerator. Mercy.

This pie is amazing. I made the mistake of using a 8 oz brick of cream cheese, but it didn't affect the outcome at all. I also didn't have a glaze packet so I made my own, and as per other reviews I just put a dash of cinnamon in. Everyone loved it, will be a new staple recipe for strawberry season.

Nearly 4 stars.  I added the chocolate layer to the crust bottom (suggested by other reviewers), and I'm sorry that I did.  It sounded like a good suggestion but, it was very hard after the pie was refrigerated which made it difficult to cut and work through with a fork while eating.  Not to mention that the chocolate was predominate.  If you are looking for a creamy, strawberry pie...make the recipe as directed.  I will add that the creamy layer could use more flavor...maybe a bit more vanilla extract and/or lemon zest?  I probably won't make this one again...I will try another recipe.

Fantastic pie! I used a graham cracker crust because I had one on hand already. Super delicious and pretty easy! I'll make it again!
