These are just awful. I'm looking for any good low-fat cookie recipes but not succeeding at all. They spread out too much and smell terrible while they're baking. Maybe I just don't like the Cocoa Puffs. Hopefully the grandkids will eat them.

These were better than I expected. I little hint of a vanilla in blend with the chocolate form the cocoa puffs. These are unusual cookies and that is what I really like about them.
