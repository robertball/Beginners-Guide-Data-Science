Normally I follow these recipes to a "T" before I rate it.  I was a little afraid to do so on this one though.  Not a big sugar lover.  I halved the recipe and used a blender because I was afraid there wouldn't be enough cantaloup flavor otherwise.  It's really good.  Next time I'll not use the blender and probably still half the sugar, not sure.  Def. can see this being nice to sip on the front porch during the summer.  Right now it's making the winter not seem so cold. :)

Yummy! I grew up drinking this but my mom would use those filipino melon scraper/juicer to make long strings, which, also enhaced the melon flavor. I don't have them, so I used a melon zester instead. The difference is the thickness. This may be a weird drink to those that haven't seen such thing before like my hubs lol, but it is resfreshing. If doing it this way, use a fork to take out the cantaloupe strings to eat..

Wow this is yummy!
We live in Italy and the cantaloupe is like a dessert it's so sweet.  We have to eat it the day we buy it or it gets stinky and mushy.  I added only one cup of sugar and it was plenty.
