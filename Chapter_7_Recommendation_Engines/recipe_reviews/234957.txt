This recipe is a good starting place but as written I can only give it a 3 star rating. Originally the only thing I changed is that I added some fresh zucchini to give it more color and nutrition. I kept adding salt but that wasn't working so I added a dash of Worcestershire and some hot pepper sauce which made it better but it was still lacking in something. I will play around with this more but I definitely think some fresh herbs are in order. That and some shredded parm as a garnish. Thanks for sharing!
