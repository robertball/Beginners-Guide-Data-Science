Keep in mind this recipe best serves 2 rather than 4. I gave it 5 stars because it is the best banana peanut butter smoothie I have ever tasted. I have tried several and this has the best balance of peanut butter and banana. I skipped the sugar since yogurt is already sweet. Thanks for sharing this great smoothie - it is my new favorite!

Yummy recipe! I used the whole small container of light vanilla yogurt but otherwise followed the directions. The only problem this definitely doesn't serve 4 more like 1 or 2. Enjoyed very much.

I thought this was pretty good. I rate it between 4-5. My only issue was I thought it had a slight tart bite to it from the yogurt. However I had to use plain Greek yogurt and a splash of vanilla due to not having the vanilla yogurt. I used brown sugar and 3 ice cubes instead of 5 because my bananas were frozen. I was looking for a high protein low calorie treat and chose this. After I made it I realized it was 4 servings and not 2. I poured it into 2 glasses and was lucky to get 1 cup each. I still would make it again but probably save it for morning. ty

A big hit with my 4 year old! I substituted the peanut butter with organic chocolate coconut peanut butter. Very yummy! I will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

I cut back on the ice and used really ripe frozen bananas. I didn't add the sugar and mine was sweet enough for me. I agree with others that the servings are off on this. My bananas were a little small and I drank the whole thing myself!

This is a great recipe. However I don t ever add sugar to any of my smoothies because I feel that the fruit is already sweet enough for my tastes. Even without the sugar this was a great recipe!

So easy for a quick snack! We replaced sugar with a few strands of honey and added a small handful of dark chocolate chips. Yum!

Was delicious but it wasn't enough for 4 servings! It made just this one glass!
