Pretty good!  Just be sure to shred your own cheese.  Almost all store bought shredded cheese contains gluten.  It's what keeps it from sticking together.  Those with a strong gluten sensitivity or allergy may be getting "glutenized" by using the store bought shredded cheese

Thank you for sharing this! Always looking for gluten free recipes. This was a tried and true "go-to" recipe I used often when my kids were growing up. So I made the same but added fresh chopped tomatoes, creole seasoning,  and Monterey Jack cheese mixed with cheddar. Served on bed of chopped lettuce with tomatoes and ranch dressing drizzled on top of pie. Keeper!

This has been my "go-to" recipe lately. I season the meat with Stubb's Beef Seasoning, add more/different cheeses and it comes out amazing. It has been a hit with everyone who has tried it.

Good but slightly bland.  Do add extra herbs/spices.  Was very quick and easy to make.

My family enjoyed this new gluten free meal.  I think I would like to work on the flavor though.  Just a little bland.

Seasoned the beef how I season hamburgers: with Greek seasoning, garlic salt and pepper. Garnished with fresh cut tomatoes.  DH suggested using a muffin tin to make individual servings.

Relatively easy to make and tasty. Based on other reviews, I added a couple cloves of garlic and extra salt and pepper. We ate it with sour cream. My 16 year old son volunteered, "This is pretty good."

Always looking for good gluten free recipes. This recipe was good, but the meat needed more salt than what the recipe called for.

More cheeses is better and it's better if you can press the meat together a bit so the crust mix stays more on top instead of soaking in. Just my families option.  Good over all.

Delicious; not too sure it tastes like a cheese burger, but a great meal none the less; it mostly disappeared in one meal sitting.  Followed the directions and had no problems.  Great receipt, thank you.

Made as described except eggs since it doesn't add flavor and husband is allergic. Was truly bland for my family. Next time will add some peppers, spices and maybe different cheese.

I made this recipe tonight and my husband adores it! I only added a little extra seasoning in the form of Trader Joe's 21 seasoning salute, as it is my favorite seasoning blend. This is a delicious recipe and no one would ever know that it's gluten free.

Super yummy and very easy to make! I used regular bisquick. Would be great as a breakfast dish too if you subbed sausage for the ground beef.  The kids loved it too and didn't even notice the onions.
