The basics of this sauce recipe are there but needed a little tweaking. I doubled the amount of lemon juice and initially left out the water and only added it little by little until i got to the correct consistency. Ended up being delicious!

I think there is a misprint on the amount of water needed. I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with Tahini soup. I would go with 1/4 cup of water next time.

Delicious! I used this over a Mediterranean inspired grilled chicken salad and used some just to dip pita in. I didn't have any fresh parsley so I used some dried which you can't see in the pic. I will def be making this with falafel as I think it will be great with that! A keeper for sure YUM!!! Thanks for sharing.:)
