Delicious! To make this a bit healthier, I opted to used light butter and fat free half and half in place of the heavy cream. The whole family enjoyed this easy side dish. I will be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is delicious, I will definitely be making this again.  I didn't have the heavy whipping cream but after some quick searching online found that a decent substitute is using half the amount of cream cheese so instead of 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream I used 1/4 cup cream cheese.  I also used two 40oz cans of yams which when cooked on the stovetop until softened and mashed with the mixer yielded almost exactly 6 cups.  It was a big hit all around and we will definitely be making it again.  Thanks for the recipe!

The flavor is good but the sweet potato mixture needs to be thicker.

This was so good! It doesn't seem to make a lot of strudel, but if there was any more for my 11x13 pan of sweet potato, I think it would have been too much. These were a big hit!

I'm so excited to finally try this dish myself. I've had it made for me for many years and was yearning for it lately. Thanks for the recipe!
