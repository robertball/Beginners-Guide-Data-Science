Outstanding. Had to make Pasillas chilli myself and had to goto a Mexican grocer you do so. But very good!

I did not like this recipe. With all of the fruit you include it was way too sweet. I wonâ€™t be making it again.

Followed the recipe without any adjustments. It was excellent! My only mistake was filling my tortillas too much. One was a meal! lol. I will definitely make this again.
