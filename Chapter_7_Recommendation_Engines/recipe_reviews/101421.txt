We grew up in eastern NC and this should be considered the official state sandwich. To make it spicier, add more hot sauce or make the vinegar and red pepper flakes in advance of preparing the pork, which makes it hotter, or add more hot sauce. The pork is excellent and topped with cole slaw brings back a lot of memories!

I needed something quick to put over my pulled pork. This was good but I would prefer a little more zip.

This is now my go-to recipe when making a batch of pork. The vinegar is too strong for me (and we are from NC) so I usually cut down by a quarter or half and and add the amount back with bottled BBQ. It doesn't really change the consistency or flavor except to make it less tart. I don't skimp on the crushed peppers as that is what makes the dish (that special little zing) in my opinion. I know it's somewhat of a crime to not put the pork over smoking chips, but I usually make this recipe in a slow cooker. (I don't have a smoker, nor do I have the time to fuss with it.) I've used all kinds of cuts, but roast loins or loin chops are usually my pick (less fat). Thanks for a great recipe.

I loved the flavor of this, but it wasn't very spicy. I added a TON of red pepper to kick it up.
