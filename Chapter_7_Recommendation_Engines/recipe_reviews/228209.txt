Great side dish that very easy to throw together!  I cut the recipe in half and saved on time by using a steam in bag of baby carrots.  This eliminated the water and all I did was combine the rest of the ingredients and poured over the carrots, tossing them to coat.

As this recipe is, I don't think it is for me. The honey and the sweetness of the carrots for me was very sweet. I added some Cajun seasoning to it to counter balance the sweetness and then I did like it

Cut recipe in half for just two people, used ingredients as suggested. I did keep the carrots covered to simmer longer on the stove top about 8 to 10 minutes instead of the 4 minutes in the recipe. Simple, sweet and delicious. Was perfect with a chicken breast. Thanks for the recipe!

I also made this by baking, on parchment paper. I did have to turn over to prevent over browning on the bottom. Next time I may try closer to the actual recipe, but use steamed carrots.

this was awesome!  Only I baked it without any water.  I just sprayed a casserole dish and added a little butter along with all the other ingredients.  Delicious!

Yummy! I boiled the carrots in the microwave to save time and added a teaspoon of orange marmalade. Gramma says they are her new fav.

This recipe is delicious! The only thing I did differently was steaming the carrots(which eliminated the need for the water) before adding the glaze.
