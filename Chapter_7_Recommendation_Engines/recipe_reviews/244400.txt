Yummy. My stalks were a little thick so we cooked it for 11 minutes in the convection oven. Also we only did it as one big packet. Turned out great and will definitely do again. Thanks for the change!

Always looking for veggies we can grill with the meat. This was good, and could be great next time. Had it with friends over for casual BBQ , just passed out the packets so everyone could unwrap theirs. Kind of like camping food, but classy. Will have again for sure.

I made this for my parents while visiting for dinner and I needed a quick and simple recipe for any sort of veggie. I had just happened to get a gift of several jars of honey from someone and stumbled across this recipe while trying to think of how to use it all. This was awesome!! It was so fast and I honestly think I needed to leave it all in the oven for only maybe three minutes and they would have been perfect. My father actually said it was the best asparagus he had ever had in his life! This recipe needs to be seen by more people haha! ^^

I made this at Easter and the family loved it.  The only adjustment was I did not have fresh garlic so used garlic from jar.  It was still excellent.

I followed the recipe and tried the oven method.  It was a unique take on asparagus; we really liked it.  Don't skip the feta, it adds a lot of flavor.  I had forgotten it at first and the asparagus was good but a little sweet. The feta really helps to cut the sweetness and add another depth of flavor.  I had to cook my asparagus a little longer than recommended, even though they were very thin. I baked it for 10 minutes in the oven and it was just the way we like it.
