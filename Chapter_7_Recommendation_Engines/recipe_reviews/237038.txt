Mmm-MM!  Loved these!  A little sweet, a little salty, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  I did, however, make a couple of modifications.  In looking over the recipe I thought it could use a little more sugar (can't believe I said that!), and specifically white sugar.  So in addition to the 1 cup brown sugar, I added 1/2 cup of granulated sugar as well.  Good call - perfectly sweet.  As for the cinnamon chips, I used the whole darn bag, essentially doubling what the recipe directed.  I was pleased with that too. Great cookie!

They tast very good. Since I like a crispy cookie I prefer to flatten them with a glass bottom dipped in cinnamon sugar, rather than just drop them.

These are great cookies! I followed the recipe exactly! It didn't say to grease the cookie sheets, so I didn't and they were fine. I baked for 12 minutes on my light colored cookie sheets and 11 minutes on my dark. I let the cookies cool for three minutes on the cookie sheet and then put them on a wire rack. It made 3 dozen.

These cookies are delicious. I was disappointed that I could not find cinnamon chips at two different grocery stores that I searched.  I divided the dough in half and added butterscotch chips to half and regular chocolate chips to the other half.  Both came out very good. I will keep my eye out for the cinnamon chips cause I would really like to try them.

I scaled to 40 servings to use my 10 ounces bag of cinnamon chips. I doubled the cinnamon and would double the vanilla next time, and maybe a little extra salt too as I used unsalted butter. With my pink scoop it made 92 cookies that baked in 14 minutes. Great recipe for a crowd.

It is better with a ts of cinammon and another of vanilla extract, The smell was awesome trust me. TRY TO FLATTEN IT OUT MORE AS THE OATS DIDNT LET IT FLATTEN AS I SHAPED THE COOKIES INTO BALLS. IT IS OKAY IF THE BATTER WAS A BIT STICKY, ENDED UP IRRESISTABLE

I live at 8660 ft OSL and this kind of cookies are very difficult to make, but I must say this recipe is awesome... with minor adjustments they turn out great without spreading all over the tray, chewy and crispy and delicious: I used half the baking soda the recipe call, add white sugar as suggested by some reviewer, but because of the altitude I used only half a cup and 2 TBS less butter. I used a scoop to make the cookies, the dough never flattened in the oven so I pressed each ball with a fork before bake them... Thanks for sharing ;)

I added chocolate chips and peanut butter chip  because that's what I had on hand. I also added walnuts and raisins. The cookies were great. I will add a bit more cinnamon and sugar next time. Just my personal taste. My husband gave them his "SAVE THE RECIPE" rating.

Easy and so delicious! I used cinnamon/apple/spice oatmeal and sprinkled a little cinnamon-sugar on top before baking. Yum!

Sooo good. I made these by the recipe and give them an A. I was craving them again but didn't have what I needed so. I used self rising flour and 3 Tbsp cinnamon with creamy white chips, for the last pan I added coconut too...still got an A from hubby. Thank you for posting this recipe I will use it over and over and love that it is flexible to what I have on hand.
