These are definitely for the chocolate lovers.  Very fudgy!  I did have trouble with the bake time.  At 30 minutes, it was still really jiggly, and at 35 minutes, my knife came out totally batter coated.  I ended up baking them for about 45 minutes.  The insides were very moist, but the top and sides came out very hard and as a result, crumbled when I cut them.  Nevertheless, they tasted great and the kids loved them.

This recipe is amazing they do not taste like they are for passover, I made these into cupcake's and they were to die for! I whipped the sugar and butter until it was very pale to incorporate more air to make it fluffy. as well as the ganache topping i whipped until it was cold making it like a piped icing

I'm not Jewish, but I got this same recipe from a dear Jewish friend of mine.  This brownie recipe is our family's favorite.    We load up on the Manischewitz Cake Meal during Passover and make these INCREDIBLE brownies all year long!!  We use Nestle semi sweet chocolate chips instead of the semi sweet squares.  We use about 1/2 to 2/3 of the Nestle bag, depending on how rich you want them.  Every time comes out perfect...never too sweet.  YUM!

Don't tell my mom I think these are better than her recipe. Enjoy these with a glass of cold milk and life is very, very good. A couple of good brownie techniques also make these a standout: 1. Toast the walnuts first. 2. Add in about 1/2 tsp salt and maybe 1 tsp espresso powder/instant coffee to pick up the flavor. (This may also help the person who thought they were too sweet.)  A DEFINITE make-again.

Way too rich and sweet (and I usually like things sweet).  Tasted like you were eating frosting from a tub you purchased at the supermarket.

I thought these were the best Passover brownies I have ever had.  I made no adjustments, with the exception of lowering the temp 25 degrees because I have a convection oven, and the cook time was perfect. My family loved them.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!  It waas so rich and chocolately!  My whole family thinks that it is the greatest Passover item that they have ever tasted.  These are one of the best brownies I ever made.  I made them before Passover to try them and everyone wanted to eat them before Passover!!

Good, but since this recipe calls for butter it must be served only at a dairy meal. If you use oil you could serve with meat or dairy.

I was so pleasantly surprised with this recipe! I made them for our sedar and I got RAVE reviews! Guests who were invited who weren't even Jewish thought they were the best brownies ever! I did make them the day before with the icing and all. They were moist and delish!

Not only were these the most delicious passover brownies but these were the best brownies ever!! They were such a great hit with family.  By not adding the flour you create a chocolate lovers dream..all chocolate!!

These are excelent brownies!  Because of the comments about them being so rich I only used 1.5 cups of sugar-where the original calls for 2 cups. (I also left the frosting off.) This still provided a super rich amazingly chocolaty brownie!

These were absolutely fantastic.  Tasted like a gourmet restaurant chocolate desert and the kids loved them too.  Did not find them too sweet  They are soft, not like a cakelike brownie and tended to fall apart when serving - but who cared?  They tasted great.

These brownies are insane!!! Definately for the chocolate lover...very fudgey! The only thing I would change is the baking time. 40 minutes cooks them through. The recipe doesn't state that you should test them just like any cake you would bake. I would follow the directions..check at 30 minutes. If more bake time is needed do so at 5 minute increments until done. This recipe is a keeper for Passover!!!

These are amazing, I even got compliments from a pastry chef! I did cut back the sugar by a 1/4 cup and added a 1/2 tsp of salt as someone suggested. I omitted the chocolate on top and just added a dash of powdered sugar. For my oven I increased the temperature just a few degrees and added 5 minutes and they come out perfect every time. Excellent and Easy recipe!

These were very delicious and easy to make, but they seemed to fall apart as soon as you unwrap the cupcake paper- I tried to make a few without the paper in larger muffin pans, and they crumbled as you tried to get them out of the pan.

I just made these brownies/cupcakes.  As always, had an Easter event during Passover, so I found this recipe hoping no one would notice they were 'different.'
I omitted the frosting for the top and just used confectioners sugar.  I skipped the walnuts and added in chocolate chips to the batter which were a nice bonus.  I think I won't buy the box stuff again!!  Thank you!!!

These were awesome! They almost taste like the box mix, which I actually prefer to pretty much all bakery or home made brownies. Chocolatey with the perfect texture.

*****Changes I made:

1. substituted veg. oil for butter to make it K for P since we had meat for dinner.

2. Reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup.*****

I also whipped the sugar and oil until fluffy and then mixed the eggs in well one at a time.

Since I made these into cupcakes, I made a frosting by mixing 1 cup of veg. shortening with 2.5 cups of powdered sugar, a teaspoon of vanilla and a bar of melted semi-sweet chocolate (but I would have used 1/3 cup of cocoa instead if I didn't run out). Mini cupcakes with liners took about 24 minutes in the oven. 

Next time I'll try with butter... I'm sure it will taste even better.

I made this recipe and it was a huge hit.  I followed it and baked for 30 minutes, when completely cooled I frosted using a dark semi sweet baking chocolate.  They are very chocolatey and moist... Thought maybe they could have been cooked longer, yet the texture was so gooey and moist, not like typical Passover baked goods.  I will be making this again!!!
