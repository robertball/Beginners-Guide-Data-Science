LOVED IT! I did have to omit the tomatoes, as I didn't have any on hand, but followed the recipe otherwise (besides making a smaller amount). GREAT combo of flavors and I really loved the sweet mango combined with the smokey heat of the chipotle. This is a definite keeper~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)
