This was excellent. Probably one of the best quiches I've ever made.  I substituted a number of ingredients so didn't give it a full 5 stars.  Instead of using surimi, I substituted sliced pieces of ham.  I also roasted the red pepper myself which took almost no time at all.  Also tried cutting the fat a bit by using 1/3 cup cream and 1/3 cup milk.  The baking time of the actual quiche took longer than 20 min but it was worth the wait.  I'll probably start using this as my main quiche recipe.  Thanks!

Delish, pretty, and so easy!  I used real crab meat and fresh spinach, since that was what I had on hand, but otherwise followed the recipe.  The only thing I would change next time is to skip the salt-the final dish was just a bit salty for my taste.

This was delicious!  The only thing I changed was I had to sub cooked chopped bacon for the crab meat, because I didn't have any.  I'll bet it would be even better with the crab meat!  I love the zip that the hot sauce gives to the recipe!  And I didn't find it to be too salty like another reviewer stated.... wonder if she might have used garlic salt instead of garlic powder?  I baked the quiche for 30 minutes and let it sit in the oven for 20 and it was perfectly done!  Very easy to prep too!  Recommend!

This was easy and fantastic! I used 4 green onions (7 seemed like a lot), a pouch of real crab meat, and whole milk instead of heavy cream. It was a little runny/needed to cook longer, (probably because of substituting milk for cream). But it still turned out delicious... a definite for company and holidays! Thank you!

Absolutely wonderful, simple recipe and dish that was appreciated by everyone at a dinner potluck. I used minced ham instead of crab and omitted parmesan - it was still delicious! I cooked it for about 35 minutes and then let it sit in the oven for an additional 30. Perfect!

This recipe came out very delicious. I followed almost exactly, but had a blend of cheddar, jack, parm, and gruyere- instead of exclusively cheddar/parm. I am giving it 5 stars just because the surimi and hot pepper really made it delicious. It did take longer than 20 minutes to cook for me. I would leave it more time with the oven on and off next time.

This is my mostest favorite Quiche! The only thing I changed was the pie crust. I used Chef John's Easy Pie Crust recipe because it is so much better than boxed pie crust. I even shared it on Face Book so my friends could be jealous. LOL It is a meal in its self. I'm planning a luncheon and will be serving this quiche.

This was excellent. I recently made crab stuffed mushrooms and was looking to use the leftover crab I had in fridge. The only substitution I made was I fresh bell pepper for the roasted. I sauteed the pepper with red onion and shallot to soften and used that instead of roasted red pepper and I also added some gruyere I had from a previous dish. But this was very flavorful and easy. I did have to increase the cooking time to 35 minutes for the egg to set completely though.

This recipe was so good and so easy!.  I love mushrooms and added them.  I also used fresh crab in the recipe.  My husband is not a quiche fan and he and I almost ate the entire quiche ourselves!

Made it exactly as written. I didn't have ready made pie crust, so I made the Quick n Easy Quiche Crust on food.com. I had to bake it 25 minutes with 30 minutes in turned off oven. Delish!

It came out delicious and very colorful! I skipped the surimi/crab to make the dish veggie-friendly, substituted fresh sauteed red and green peppers, and used a bit of cayenne instead of the hot pepper sauce.

I baked the quiche for about 40 minutes and let it set in the oven for 20. A couple of quick notes:

I had never "blind baked" a crust before, and the instructions did not mention it, so my pie crust slid down the sides of the plate in the oven. I improvised by creating a bottom-only crust, but I would make a note about it for anyone who hasn't done this before.

As another reviewer mentioned, my dish came out too salty. It might have been because I used extra sharp cheddar and was quite liberal with the cheese in general, so just be careful of that.

Otherwise, a huge hit! Next time I will blind bake the crust with weights and skip the salt.

Mega hit in my house this morning.  I didnt change much, just what I had too because of what I had on hand.  I used fat free milk, and added a few different kinds of cheese, then used a red onion.  Very good recipe, thanks for sharing.  Even the kids ate it!!

This is an excellent quiche,and quite rich.  I substituted 5 oz. of real crab for the 8 oz. of surimi and that was plenty.  Yes, it makes it more expensive, but I can't bring myself to buy fake crab.  As other reviewers have stated, it took longer to cook than the recipe states....but it turned out wonderfully and I will definitely make it again.
