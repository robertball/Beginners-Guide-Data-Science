I made this recipe for a small dinner party.  Everyone loved it, even the kids!  There wasn't a whole lot left.  I made it as written but left out the salt and pepper thinking the dressing would be better.  It definitely needs the salt.  The dressing is delicious!  Next time I make it I will make it exactly as written with no changes.

I made this salad for myself as the recipe said and the flavors were just not to my liking. The mint, especially, just didn't go pair well with the flavors of the mustard and vinegar at all. I don't think I would make it again without making a lot of changes--I think that maybe green apples would work better than strawberries and if I used the mint, then I would leave out the mustard and use a different type of vinegar.

This was refreshing and delicious! Lots of different flavors working great together YUM. The toasted almonds really add great flavor and crunch. I doubled the dressing and added extra balsamic and dijon for a little more tang and put it on a large bed of spring mix  I added extra mint (because I love it) Toped it with some grilled chicken and made it a meal FANTASTIC!! This will be a new healthy staple in my home. Thanks for sharing!!! (=

I did this recipe for a spring pot luck and it was delicious.  I made some extra dressing for people to use on the bed of chopped lettuce.

I liked the idea, but the reality was underwhelming.

the dressing for this salad is great!  i made a few changes: cilantro instead of mint, added grilled chicken and roasted peanuts instead of almonds.  i also added fresh purple grapes and nixed the cucumber, but that would have been good too.

This was a really good fresh treat that I will definitely make again! I made it exactly as listed (except I didn't have english cucumbers, so I used regular ones)

The toasted almonds are really a nice touch of crunch and flavor. I think I may add a little more next time. I might tweak the dressing a little just to see if I can find perfection, but all in all, this is a great healthy salad. I like the idea of adding grilled chicken on top to make it more of a main dish as opposed to a side. Thanks for sharing!

Loved it. A great combination of flavors. Very easy to make, healthy and refreshing. It's hard to imagine a more summery dish than a strawberry, cucumber, mint salad. Perfect for a picnic or lunch on a hot day. I think the dressing is nicely balanced but it does need salt.

I don't think I would make this again. the flavors were okay--but the appearence was not like the photo online. I brought it to a party and it didn't look appetizing once it was all tossed together. eh. Too sweet for me too.

Delicious and refreshing. I doubled the dressing ingredients to have enough to coat a good amount of lettuce. I used regular cucumbers and added grape tomatoes, too. I also used two large basil leaves cut chiffonade, instead of the mint. Will make this all through the CNY strawberry season!
