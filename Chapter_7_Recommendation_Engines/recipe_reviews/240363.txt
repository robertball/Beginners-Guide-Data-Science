I made this with one can of tomato soup and one can of tomato sauce and added some stock plus Adobo and oregano, also reduced the chili powder slightly to suit my S.O. It came out great, anything I cooked out much longer than 10 minutes.

The chilli was savory and spicy. Had to reduce the salt a bit though.
