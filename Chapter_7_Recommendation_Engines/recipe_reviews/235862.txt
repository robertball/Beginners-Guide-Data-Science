This soup recipe was very delicious and easy.  I followed it to a T but added leftover roasted chicken the last few minutes.  My hubby loved it, we will make it again.

I made this for the first time last night. It was delicious. The only changes that I would possibly make are to double up on the solids. Another idea is to maybe substitute shrimp  for the chicken, adding more cumin and perhaps some cayenne pepper.

I use leftover ham instead of the chicken and I add 2 jalapeños and 1 tsp of cayenne powder pepper. If you like it hot, this is for you.

I'm only giving this a three star because, with the spices stated, it is pretty bland. I triple the spices, add quite a bit of hot sauce and this soup is spot on. Very good base but, for us, just needed the spices kicked up some and, next time, I think I will also add another can of hominy.

This soup was so good and it’s so cold outside!
I made my own broth by boiling the chicken thighs in water with salt, pepper, a few slices of white onion and poultry seasoning. 
I also have picky eaters who don’t like “chunky tomatoes” in their soup so I blended the can of tomatoes in my blender. 
I just added all the ingredients to the broth once the thighs were done, brought to a boil and then simmered. Added the meat back in, once it was cooled and shredded.

Topped the bowls with cheese, cilantro and tortilla strips. 

*I also added a can of sweet corn that I roasted over the stove, and it’s juice. I did NOT include the juice from the hominy. I only had white hominy, if I had yellow I wouldn’t have added the corn.

This was delicious!!!! I served with side of pico de gallo, shredded cheese, and corn bread. The fresh pico really brought out the good flavor!!! Will definitely be making it another cold and snowy day!
