This was just way too cheesey for me and I like cheese.  I probably had twice the broccoli this called for and it was still too much cheese.  It was a simple recipe but I'll only use half the cheese the next time and thin it with some milk or half and half next time

I totally screwed this up.  I was trying to cut the recipe in half and also have it slightly less "cheesy" (though cheesy is good).  I put almost 2 produce bundles of fresh, cut up, broccoli in a square pyrex dish (after lightly cooking the broccoli), that was the perfect amount.  But for the cheese sauce (slighted melted in a pan prior to mixing with broccoli), I only put maybe 1/4 of a loaf of Velveta, some small amount of random left over shredded cheeses, and a WHOLE FREAKING 8 oz container (the little small one) of sour cream.  WAY too much sour cream, not enough cheese flavor.  I put French's fried onions (1/2 of the big can mixed with 1/3 stick melted butter) on top, that was good.  I wish I would have put a whole can!

This is very good.  however, there is way too much cheese.  I halved the recipe and used 1/4 less cheese.  I'd recommend using half if not a 1/4 of the cheese called for.  I didn't use the cracker topping bc I didn't have ritz.  I'm sure I'd like it that way, though. Thanks!

Made this for Easter dinner and it was a big hit!  I used fresh broccoli and halfed all ingredients for a smaller batch.  This will definitely be a regular on our holiday tables.

I don't normally cook anything with a cheese sauce but had some Velveeta I bought and had to use up so thought I would give this a try. Wow this was delicious. The sour-cream gave this a different texture and taste. Thanks for sharing this simple and delicious recipe it goes in my rotation.

I used double the amount of broccoli and there was still plenty of cheese.  Tasted great.

Tweaked a bit and added a few of my own ingredients, and was a hit at Christmas dinner! 
Also left over portion was just as good when warmed up 2 and 3 days later!

The Family was upset I didn't make more! My husband requested this and I made it for the first time with ease. I chose to make a SMALLER than recommended portion for my family of 5 and here's what I did:

-Chopped about 25-30 FRESH mini florets of broccoli and boiled as instructed for 3 minutes COVERED 

-Seperately I boiled 1/2 Cup Country Crock Margarine and 3 adult handfuls of shredded Cheddar Cheese until all was melted

-Removed from Heat and added approximately 1 to 1 1/2 cups of Sour Cream to Cheese Sauce

-Placed in a 1.4 Quart Dish and Placed in Oven for same suggested time of 25 Minutes 

**Note: I took comfort that only a TINY bit of grease remained at bottom of dish when finished.

I liked the flavor and so did my family but the cheese was really runny.  I'll make it again but with adjustments.

My husband made this, just for us, so we used about one fifth of this recipe. One bag broccoli, 4 ounces of Velveeta, 2 to 3 tablespoons of butter and 1/4 cup of sour cream. We were nonplussed at first because the cheese and butter was so lumpy. Then he added the sour cream and it smoothed right out. And tasted divine!!

Great receipt. After reading other reviews, I added more broccoli  to make up for too much cheese. It will certainly be my favorite casserole from now on.

I used fresh broccoli and 1/3 the listed ingredients-substituted the margarine with butter and Cheezit crackers instead of round ones. Cooked in a smaller, deeper glass meatloaf dish and it came out great!

This is a really good recipe. Some people think it's too cheesy, but it's great for me. Then again, I do like to drown my broccoli in cheese. The sour cream is a nice touch. It's good with or without the Ritz topping; I (somewhat) prefer it that way, but my BF scrapes it off. Thanks.

Not so good, my family only had one helping and there was more than half the pan left over that never got touched :(
