I haven't made this yet, although, I have made chili similar to this. The recipe sounds delicious & I plan to give it a try.  My comment shall be more directed at Mr. "Poppycock's" comment. You, sir,  are rude & narrow minded. The recipe states that it is TURKEY chili, or didn't you catch that part?  If you prefer beef chili, then move on but don't be rude. Chili is something that is made in a wide variety of ways according to ingredients & region & some people enjoy trying new twists on things. And, addressing your anti-grain, pro-fat rant... How's that diet working for your colon health??? A good , healthy diet should be whole food ingredients and mostly plants. There's nothing wrong with meat or dairy but neither should be the largest portion on the plate & should be eaten in moderation. Grains are not "poison", not if they are whole grains AND, once again, eaten in moderation. The real culprit to diabetes and obesity is processed food & too much sugar. Perhaps you have a secret jealous streak because you, as a firehouse cook didn't promote your cooking style & someone else did? Grow up!!

Firehouse Station 2 Healthy Chili Haiku: "Didn't put in corn; we don't like it in chilis. Had to half it too." Whew glad that I scrutinized the ingredient list b4 opening cans b/c that would've made ALOT! Course, if I had a firehouse station full of fireman to make this for, I would gladly double or triple the recipe, but that's beside the point. A very good chili, very thick, nice flavor, perfect spice that didn't necessarily require a heavy squirt of hot sauce, and I liked the addition of BBQ sauce, which I'm sure depending on the brand you use could be a hit or a miss. (We're partial to Sweet Baby Ray's.)

Pay attention to the servings, This recipe makes TONS! Just scale it down and you should be good. This is some of the best chile I have ever had! I love the different taste of the turkey and sausage instead of beef. Me and the husband both ate more than we should have. I made it by the book (only simmered it a bit longer) and it was so per. I definitely recommend!

Got rave reviews at church Sunday lunch. Used original Rotel diced tomatoes.  Used one less can Rotel and only one can chopped green chili peppers in a recipe for 30 servings. Add back only if you want the heat.

This was excellent!  I doubled the bbq sauce in it, added onions, cayenne, and garlic powder.  Also threw in some chunks of cheddar and served it with oyster crackers.  Big hit!

I didn't use the 2 cans of chili beans.  I used 1 can of green Chile's, 3 cans of diced tomatoes (1 was low sodium), low sodium black beans (rinsed), added diced red onions and freshly diced green and yellow bell peppers.  Even added 1pound of ground chicken.  Topped it off with shredded Mexican cheese.   Poured it over a slice of cornbread.  I also used regular sausage links diced and lastly, I used about 2tbsp of dried parsley

Absolutely delicious! I did make modifications by using mild italian sausage and reducing jalapenos to 1/2 what was syggested. Also used the beans in mild chili sauce. It was perfect.

This is now my go-to chili recipe. I love the flavor the sausage gives it. We don't like corn in our chili so that's the only thing I left out. I used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of sausage and halved the other  ingredients except the chili powder and black beans, and it made a lot.

A little spicy so for my weaklings I'll have to do a little less chili powder and no tomatoes with chilies. I halved everything except I did 2 pounds of meat. That much filled my biggest crock pot.

Any good chili recipe gets tweaks as it goes along. This was no different; but it is a great starting point. A few more serrano, jalape√±os and chipotles. I was lucky enough to find a fabulous tri-tip roast and great ground chuck at HEB. I  typically add less beans and add them later, after the meats are nearly done. I also am a fan of adding a healthy spoon of unsweetened cocoa. Will I make it again? Well,  heck YES!

I have made it multiple times.  I reduce the amount of chili powder in half, and use sweet sausage rather than spicy sausage.  I make this is double batches and then freeze it in meal size portions to use on busy weeknights.

Excellent chili and super easy to make! I made it with ground beef and  hot Italian sausage and it was delicious. Otherwise I followed the recipe but left out the green chili so my kids would try it. My youngest loved it with cheese and sour cream (and some milk to drink). It's spicy and delicious. This one is a keeper!

Made it exactly as written except for the red pepper flakes, (not everyone in my house likes it hot.)  At first I wasn't very impressed with it...just average bowl of chili.  The next day, after the flavors had more time to blend, it was SO delicious!  I will be using this recipe again.

Thought it was wonderful. I anticipated some family  members not liking the spiciness so i halved the chili powder. Next time I'll halve the canned green chiles, too.

This is amazing chili and I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. 
Next time I will try  a sauteed onion and  a little garlic powder on the suggestion of some other reviewers. I added a dollop of shredded cheese on top, but it's not necessary.
Since I love it extra hot, I put  a few drops of Tabasco Habanera sauce in my bowl!   
I also served it with soft potato rolls. It was AMAZING! I will be making this a lot, you can be sure.
This makes a ton of servings and if you are a family of 4 or so, I would halve it. Or, just make the whole thing and serve portions for busy nights!

This chili was fantastic! I used ground venison instead of turkey, and chipotle chili pepper (as that's what I had on hand). Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. We'll definitely make this again.

I made this recipe, however, I added additional spice that heated it up!  My family went head over heals for it and said it was the best ever! I was even told to enter it into a contest. So, I guess we will have to see how it stands up to others.  I'll come back and let you know.  Thanks FH2!

I made a half recipe with a few minor changes. I used 1 pound ground turkey, 1 pound Johnsonville mild Italian sausage. Browned the meat with 1 green pepper, 1 red pepper, 1 chopped large yellow onion . While this browned I put the rest of the ingredients in the crockpot with the addition of 3 crushed garlic cloves and 2 bay leaves. When the meat and vegetables were cooked I drained off the fat and added to the crock pot and simmered on low 6 hours. Even using mild sausage and mild chili beans this chili was plenty spicy! Even making a half of the recipe it made a lot.  I served it on top of white rice, oh my... delicious

This is a simple and delicious recipe.  I am glad that's previous post reminded others to check the number of servings. Even cut in half, we had plenty.  I had a leftover chipotles pepper in adobe sauce so I added that.  I will definitely make this again.

This was delicious. Probably some of the best chili I have ever had. The recipe is huge though. I cut it in half and it still made enough for about 6-7 people. This was a quick and easy recipe. Definitely going to make it again.

Awesome recipe. Only change I made was I used 3/4 of the chili powder and the spice was at a perfect level for my family. I know they don't like super spicy and for them it was the perfect balance. Easy to make and delicious.

Didn't use chili beans (because I forgot to get them at the store). Only used 1 green pepper & replaced the red pepper with onion. Also didn't use any chili powder because my dad is super sensitive to hot flavor. It was still amazing!

This is a fabulous recipe.  I browned my sausage and peppers and then dumped everything in the slow cooker. I used paleo chicken thighs cut up instead of ground turkey.  Served with cheese and a dollop of sour cream.

I've made this several times and find that each time I tweak it based on who will be eating it.  Husband and son love spicy, daughter not so much.  I agree with other reviewers who said it's a great "base" recipe and you should add/delete based on your taste.  Tomorrow I will be using chorizo instead of Italian sausage, onion and some jalape√±o.  Personally, I do not put corn in chili (it's a crime :)).  I really appreciate the other reviewers' suggestions and will be serving it with oyster crackers this time around.

Made it exactly as written and OMG!  Best chili I've ever had.  I'm not a big fan of spicy, but this had a robust, rich flavor that the heat complimented beautifully.  So quick and easy to make, and the next day it's even better.  Will definitely make again.  And again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family asks for this chili every week. It's always good even if I sometimes use all beef and sausage or make it exactly as it is written. I sometimes use less beans. They eat it more as a dip on chips because it is so thick and delicious.

This is now my go to recipe for chili.  I like it because it seems healthier and not so heavy as other chilis.  The only thing I changed was adding only half of the red pepper flakes because I don't like it too hot.  Also added some salt.  For those of  you that put this recipe down because it's not "real chili", it doesn't really matter if it's as good recipe and you enjoy eating it. Thanks for sharing Zamzow.

This chili is absolutely delicious. I didn't realize the recipe made 15 servings initially, so I had plenty to share with friends. I ended up cutting the recipe in half and serving it with some mozzarella cheese on top.
