Fabulous recipe. Can't say anything really bad, other then 1. I don't carry pine nuts in my house 2. it's just as well about the pine nuts, I don't like them anyway, so I needed that crunch so I replaced the the nuts with slivered almonds. Worked well. Flavor was great, recipe was simple, in the end my family was happy too. TY

I really just eyeballed all measurements and made myself one serving of this for a light dinner.  I thought it was very light and refreshing and good!  I used walnuts instead of pine nuts since I don't have any pine nuts.  Thanks!

This is a great fruit salad! Do NOT skimp out on the Pine Nuts! They have a unique flavor and crunch that makes this recipe. -- I roasted mine at 300 degrees for about 10min. before adding them to the salad (once they'd cooled) I made this for "Teacher Day" at school and they gobbled it up. -- Tip: don't add the bananas or pine nuts until you're just about to serve this. Even though there's lime juice, the bananas still go a bit mushy and take on some of the red from the strawberries. An you want the pine nuts to cool before adding them to the fruit. --- still really yummy and happily different than your run of the mill fruit salad. Enjoy!

So simple, yet so delicious! Easy to put together and tastes great. Not only is it a nice combination of colors and flavors but it's good for you too. Great for breakfast or a light snack. You can easily sub sliced almonds for the pine nuts.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times it was perfect.  Pine nuts are too expensive, so one time I made this with almonds and then the other time walnuts.  Its super easy, refreshing and healthy.

I made this with the fruit I had on hand: bananas, papaya, pineapple and strawberries. I added a little mint and some coconut since it felt tropical to me! So good. Love the honey lime dressing.

I went in search of a fruit salad that really concentrated on fruit rather than whipped cream! This one delivers not only the focus on fruit, but the flavor combination is outstanding! It's refreshing, flavorful, and I don't feel bad about serving it to my 4 year old. I didn't have pine nuts on hand (not a fan) so I went with slivered almonds, and I went with an Organic NW Clover Honey (almost espresso in color). I can't say enough good things about this recipe. Thanks for submitting it.

Very tasty, very easy to make and a nice twist on basic fruit salad with the lime & honey. Didn't have pine nuts, so I used slivered almonds which worked well and added a delicious crunch to this. Will make again for sure.

It's winter here, so fresh fruit is not available or too expensive (we live in Sweden).  So, I used (in cans) mandarin oranges, peaches and pineapple.  I added frozen blueberries and strawberries that I cut up.  It was delicious and everyone asked for the recipe.  I'm sure all fresh ingredients would have been better, but this was really good as well.  The dressing and pine nuts is what brings it all together.  It's nice to take as a dessert.

This recipe was a huge hit at our family 4th of July BBQ yesterday with adults and kids.  The honey adds a subtle sweetness, the lime keeps the salad fresh and the pine nuts are the delicious finishing touch - these are a must to make the salad complete.  This is the best fruit salad I have ever tasted and may be the only one I make from now on.  This is my first review and rating of a recipe on Allrecipes - I usually don't bother with rating things but this salad deserves to be rated! Pine nuts keep well in the freezer.  I suggest buying a large bag at Costco or Trader Joe's so you have them on hand.  Buying in the larger quantity is a great idea because in small quantities at the regular grocery store they are quite expensive. Nad you never know when you might need them for pesto or a fruit salad.

Delicious! Adds a nice glossy finish to a fruit salad. I used coconut flakes and mint leaves instead of pine nuts. Definitely does not keep well as left overs after sitting in the extra juice but beautiful day of. Good way to change up the usual fruit salad.

This was very, very good. I didn't think I'd love the pine nuts as much as I did. The lime was very mild--I used the green squeezy plastic things for the juice--and gave it the perfect aftertaste. I tried a bunch of different fruits with the dressing, and my favorites turned out to be pear and cantaloupe. The mildly sweet crunch with the creamy crunch of the pine nuts was just beautiful. Thanks so much for sharing!

Love the honey and lime.  It gives the fruit an unexpected, but pleasant bite.  Definitely a keeper and one that I will be making often.

I liked this. It was so simple to make too. My lime may have been large, so I added about an additional 1/2 Tblsp of honey. I wanted it more sweet than tart. Pine nuts are kind of expensive, but they really made this different. I liked their texture. Definitely don't leave them out. I may consider this, if I do a Memorial bbq with the red, white, and blue colors. Thanks

Very delicious and refreshing.  I made it with Sweet and Spicy Salmon.  Very nice pair.  The only change I made was using peptitas instead of pine nuts.  They were handy at the time.

Made with almond slices instead of the pine nuts. Still gave it a nice soft crunch. Might have liked it a tad sweeter. Next time I will taste the glaze before I add the fruit  and adjust to taste.

I've made this several times, sometimes strictly by the recipe, sometimes just with fruit I have on hand along with some fresh mint, always with good results.  It's really the lime honey dressing that makes!

The lime made all the difference! I have also tried adding the pine nut "crunch" by using broken up (unsweetened) shredded wheat or coconut flakes.

For such a simple recipe this was outstanding!  I used mango instead of blueberries as that is what I had.  I did not have pine nuts and it was great without- anxious to try with the nuts but either way I will be making this again and again.

This is so refreshing. The lime juice keeps the fruit from browning and it will stay fresh looking in the refrigerator for a couple of days. So easy and people will ask you what makes this dish so tasty.

In addition to the fruits called for in this recipe, I used nectarines, cantaloupe and added some lime zest.  This is a simple, classic, and fresh fruit salad with just the right amount of sweetness from the lime-honey dressing.

This was delicious!  The only thing I didn't add was pine nuts since I didn't have any in stock.  I used pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries.  The honey and lime juice added just the right amount of sweet and tartness.  Everyone liked it!  I'll make this again.  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious fruit salad! I thought the honey would make the fruit seem to sweet, but with the lime it's so good! I really like the balance of the lime and honey with the fruit. I just used what I had on hand (cantaloupe, strawberries, bananas, and pineapple). I'll definitely make this recipe again throughout the summer. Thanks for the recipe!

This was SO easy and refreshing! I made it exactly as written and everyone loved it! I honestly wasn't sure about adding pine nuts, but I'm so glad I did. They are very mild and gave it a little crunch. I made it because it was 4th of July and I was going for red, white and blue. So yummy!

Used some different fruits we had on hand, and no pine nuts. The sauce was really good.

Refreshing. The lime and honey brought out the taste of the fruit. I didn’t have pine nuts so I used a tbsp of chia seeds.

The whole fam loved it. We’re all big fans of fruit salad in this house.  The lime zest made a huge difference!

I used random fruit I had around the house. I thoroughly coated my banana slices with lemon juice to prevent browning before I threw them in.  I also mixed the left over lemon juice with the lime juice for the dressing and used minimal honey.  I think fruit salad can stand on it's own merit without sweeteners or whip cream.  I used walnuts instead of pine nuts.  
 Enjoy the fruits of your labor!

Fast and easy. I didn’t measure anything, just used a good eye. Also left out the pine nuts just because I didn’t have any.  You could substitute something else like chopped walnuts. Will make this many more times!

Can’t go wrong with lime and honey. Works well with any fruit.

Delicious! I made this for a large family gathering, so I tripled most of the recipe--with the exception of the blueberries. I used 2 dry pints of berries and it was plenty. I didn't have any pine nuts, so I substituted unsalted, shelled sunflower seeds.  Only problem I had was the seeds didn't hold up well as leftovers, so next time I will serve them on the side, to be added as needed.

This fruit salad was delicious. Perfect for the hot weather that just won't go away. Substituted walnuts since no pine nuts were in my cupboard. Will definitely make again!
