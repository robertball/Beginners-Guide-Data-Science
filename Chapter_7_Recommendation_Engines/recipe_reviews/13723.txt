This just did not taste like coleslaw at all, taste like a salad with cabbage instead of lettuce.  Easy but a flop as far as coleslaw goes.

I have never added green pepper or onion to my coleslaw, so, I thought I would give it a try.   It was definitely a nice change from my basic slaw recipe.   I personally did not care for the green pepper, but, everyone else that tried it liked both the green pepper and green onion, so, I consider that a hit.   I was unsure if "creamy salad dressing" meant miracle whip or a creamy slaw dressing, so, I went with a homeade creamy slaw dressing.  I would definitely make again.

This is not bad. Next time try a tsp. of creamy horseradish mixed with the 1 c. salad dressing. Adds a little zip.
