This is a really easy and tasty recipe.  I absolutely loved it and plan on making it again.  You may have to use toothpicks too keep the breast together though after stuffing it as i did.  The next time i make it i am going to marinate it for a few hours in the fridge after stuffing it.  I thought this was an excellent recipe and so easy!!

I usually don't leave reviews but this was so good, I just had to. I made this last night and was impressed with how easy it was. I followed the recipe exactly, other than using private selection basil in olive oil 3tbs,all I had on hand) and since I couldn't find the can tomato it called for, I used diced tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano (drained) and added about 2tbsp olive oil. I basted the chicken with dressingat start and again half way through cooking. Tastes like you spent much longer preparing than you did. Enoy!

So quick and easy to make and everyone loved it.  We made a slight variation to the recipe because we couldn't find the Red Pepper Parmesan dressing.  Instead we used Ranch dressing and sprinkled Parmesan cheese over top before baking.  Everyone loved it.  We will make this again for sure!!

My biggest difficulty was locating the ingredients, especially the diced tomatoes "with garlic in olive oil." There seem to be about a million different versions of diced tomatoes, but that particular combo was tough.  However, it was well worth the search.  My husband wouldn't shut up about it for a week, and wants this dish served for pretty much any dinner with guests, because it's yummy, easy, and looks like you spent hours preparing it!

LOVE this recipe! The last time I made it I marinated the chicken breasts in the dressing for a few hours after pounding them out - it made them SO moist and flavorful! And fresh basil really makes a difference. Make sure when you pound the chicken it is skin side DOWN - it keeps them from falling apart.

Delicious and so easy! I used a different dressing to top it with because I didn't have the roasted pepper one. I will definitely keep this one!

This is the best easy to make food I have ever made. Didn't change a think except used thin sliced chicken breast for easy and used diced tomatoes with roasted garlic in rich juices since I couldn't find the olive oil kind. Served next to whole grain pasta with red sauce. yummy!

It was alright, the flavor of the stuffing took away from the rest of the meal. It dulled the typical POP you get when you have Bruschetta. I recommend losing the stuffing and making a more true representation of Bruschetta.

This turned out great, I gave it 4 stars because I had to make changes.  I used petite diced tomatos with garlic, oregano, & basil.  I used stoufers stuffing mix.  I put the tomatoes in my mini prep and blended them with a 1/2 tsp garlic.  I mixed the blended tomatos/garlic, stuffing mix, cheese, and a little parm as my mixture to put into the chicken.  I didn't have the salad dressing called for so I used the remainder of the canned tomatos, 1/4 cup of parm, 1/4 cup ranch and blended again in the mini prep and coated the chicken rolls.  The last 10 minutes I added additional motz cheese and melted.  next time though I will pound the chicken closer to the 1/4 inch as this time I only got it to 1/2 inch thick.  It was wonderful, everyone liked it.

Super simple to put together. Tasted great! Keep an eye on the chicken right around 40 minutes, so that it turns out moist. I had trouble finding that dressing, so I used Kraft's Raspberry Vinaigrette to drizzle lightly on top, as well as for a dipping sauce. That tasted great with it.

I would definitely make this again - pretty tasty, and the chicken didn't come out dry.  I took another reviewer's suggestion to use the canned tomatoes with garlic and onion, drained, and then I added some olive oil to replace the liquid.

I was really disappointed with this. It was very one note. The center stuffing was very mushy & too acidic. It lacked texture, flavor & balance. One of my kids liked it & my husband are it. I don't think I would make this again.

These were a lot easier to make than I thought they would be. The most work was pounding the chicken so I could roll it. The final result was delicious. I received many rave reviews from my guests. And I had lots for freezing. Loved this recipe!

P.S. I might consider slitting open the breasts and stuffing them next time. It might be easier than pounding them.
