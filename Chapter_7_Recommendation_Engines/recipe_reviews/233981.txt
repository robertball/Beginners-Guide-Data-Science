Simple and delicious! Plus it not only tastes good but it's good for you too! These are perfect for breakfast or a really nice "guilt free" snack. I opted to use fat free greek vanilla yogurt and threw in a few blackberries as well. This is a great base for whatever add-in's you like and no matter what kind of fruit you have on hand it's bound to be tasty!

Very good. Also works well with partially thawed frozen berries.
