I added 2 large garlic cloves. Also I used kosher salt with ground pepper and put it on top vs inside and it made a nice looking topping after baked. Delicious!

Fantastic! No changes this time. My wife said it was the best meatball she’s ever had and even the kids like them!

I was afraid the blue cheese was going to be overpowering...but it wasn’t, it was amazing. It cooked thoroughly in 30 minutes for an average size meatball. These would make a great appetizer of you make them smaller and adjust the cooking time.

Great meatball but a little dry ( might be because I used 93-7 ground beef) Made a mushroom gravy to serve over and it was delicious!

This is amazing!  I accidentally used 1/2 ground venison sausage and 1/2 ground venison, but it was still great! The only change I made was adding a little garlic.  I served with blue cheese cream sauce, over mashed potatoes, and it was out of this world!  I usually hate the blandness of meatballs, but these were so good!

If you like blue cheese, you will LOVE these! They were perfect consistency, and just enough blue cheese to really pack a hit.  The only suggestion I have is to use green onions. Otherwise, fantastic exactly as written.  We enjoyed these on top of smashed red potatoes with a blue cheese gravy.
