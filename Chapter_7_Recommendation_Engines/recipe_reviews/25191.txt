It was tastier than I thought it would be.  I used diced tomato/chile mixture.  VERY simple.  We didn't care for the celery, so next time, we'll leave them out.

This was a really good recipe. I used chicken instead of turkey, and sprinkled some herb chicken seasoning and rosemary on top of it.

This was good...I added a can of drained sweet corn which I highly recommend. Cilantro would also be a nice addition to this dish if you're a fan!!

I was searchng for a recipe for dinner last night and I had all these ingredients so tried the recipe and this will be a staple. I used ground turkey which I added to skillet after browning the onions and cooked until no longer pink, then added diced tomato because I didn't have stewed tomatoes. I also added: dried oregano, dried basil, garlic powder, red pepper flakes fresh ground black pepper, and garnished with diced fresh Italian parsley and fresh basil. Served it over brown rice. This is a great basic recipe that you can use in a variety of ways. Quick and easy.

This was very tasty. I used a couple tablespoons of oil and it was fine. I also added salt and pepper. Sheila - Fountain Valley, CA

Went strictly by the recipe, and thought it was pretty good.  Didn't necessarily care for the celery, so I might try with corn instead next time.

Was ok, nothing spectacular, but good for a quick night. I spiced it up by chopping up a jalapeno and adding it. Didn't use the celery.

I used leftover turkery tenderloin, and added some basil, rosemary,pepper and salt.  Other than that I followed the directions given and we enjoyed it.

Very bland, tasteless.  I wish I had read the reviews because I went by the high rating.  This recipe needs so much more of something,to make it good.  I feel like I wasted a lot of good ingredients.

It was pretty good, nothing special...next time I'm going to add a little garlic and fresh basil.  Oh, and I cut the recipe in half (it's just my husband and I) and we like a lot of rice so if you're like us I would suggest not decreasing the amount of rice.

Good flavor! I cooked the rice in chicken stock. I used left-over BBQ chicken, instead of turkey, and added garlic, black pepper, and a shake of dried chiles. We're not big celery fans, but didn't mind it in this recipe.

This is a quick and easy meal to put together. As written, it is bland - to say the least. However, as written, it allows you to turn this into anything you want. Adding whatever herbs and spices you prefer, you can go Tex-Mex, Indian, Mediterranean...literally, go anywhere in the World. So, kudos for that. Certainly this is a recipe to keep in mind when you've got little time to get dinner on the table and need something healthy. Thank you for the recipe.

Quick, tasty and lower in calories than your standard cream-based turkey leftover recipe. I left off the celery and added corn, and also added a tsp of ground chipotle chili pepper to provide a little southwestern zing.

It's quick, it's easy, but that's where it ends. 
Didn't much care for the celery and it needs a lot of "doctoring up". Added Italian stewed tomatoes(thus making it two 14oz cans), salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, rosemary, garlic, basil, sage, marjoram. It makes a lot. Might try it with eggplant and zucchini instead of celery next time, but then that's a whole different recipe, isn't it?
