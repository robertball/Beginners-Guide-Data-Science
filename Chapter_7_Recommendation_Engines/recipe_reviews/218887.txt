Great after school snack for kiddos....and so much better than a Sonic slushy! I used regular lemonade mix, and they loved it.

OMGosh!!! this was the best summertime drink this season ;-) I had soo much leftover watermelon from the 4th of July, that I didn't want not one piece to go to waste!! Froze up a cup to a cup & a 1/4th in individual baggies and waited ;-) Had to make my own drink mix with unsweetened drink mix and sugar and followed the recipe like stated. I ended up adding a TBSP more because I believe the pre-made stuff is more concentrated then mine...but however, it took all of a couple of minutes to pull things to one stop and whip in a matter of seconds...TY TY TY this was the best, now I can make it with a moments notice on the fly! YUM!!!!!

Pretty tasty I would recommend freezing the watermelon for over 45 mins and adding ice as there wasn't much slush to it.

I decided to try this when I saw it posted recently. I was surprised at how much water was in the drink. I just knew it would be completely thin even with the frozen fruit. The flavor isn't bad, just a bit lemony. I make a similar drink with real watermelon, strawberries, and fresh lemon juice. It is as thick as a slurpy. I will have to post it some time. The flavor of this was decent, though, and I liked the calorie count. Just a bit too much water texture wise for my taste.

Love it. I use lemon aid mix or sometimes a squeezed lemon and my frozen 
watermelon. I serve it to company and they are amazed with the taste and the idea of using frozen watermelon. Big hit!!

Made this today for my son who loves watermelon and strawberry lemonade.  So simple but so incredibly easy and very good.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this, but I added a 1/4 cup vodka and only used 1 cup of water.  I think if I make this again, I will use 1 cup ice instead of water.  It's a little watery.

This drink was great I made it for a group of my friends and they loved it. It was a last minute idea though so since I didn't have time to freeze the watermelon I decided to sub the water for ice and it turned it great

I only rated this three stars because it was too bland/simple. I had to add some frozen lime juice, crushed ice and Tequila! Awesome!
