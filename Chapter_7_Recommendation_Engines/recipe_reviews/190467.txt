I'm native Vermonter. This is called sugar on snow and always served with crisp dill pickles and homemade donuts.  It's a Vermont sugar season tradition.

My husband and I and our 4 daughters live in Northern Ontario Canada and each winter our friends bring us maple syrup from Quebec.  My husband made wooden molds for us to pack the snow in and we make these with the kids....What a hit....Great way to make the winter fun! Enjoy everyone

Haven't made it in 60 years, but back in the '50s we would press our hands into the snow and use the handprint as the mould. Our grandmother would bring the pan and hot syrup out and pour it in the mould. That was the Northern Illinois tradition. Will do it again when we get some fresh snow.

In NY state, on the Canadian border, we often made this tasty treat with "fake" maple syrup.  We had heavy snow fall nearly every winter, so it was a familiar treat for my family.  Brings back some great memories!

We were served this at a sugarshack in Quebec on a school trip. I can't wait to try it again when it starts snowing.

I had a lot of fun making this with the grandkids on our first "snow day"! I didn't have pure maple syrup, I have some maple flavored agave and it came out fine! I think I cooked the syrup just a little too long because it came out more like hard candy. I drizzled it on thew snow and they just picked up the pieces. Great success!
