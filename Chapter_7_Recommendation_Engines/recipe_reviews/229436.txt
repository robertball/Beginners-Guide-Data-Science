This is so good! I have been trying for years to find a recipe that tastes like the rice puddings at the Greek restaurants and this is it! Only thing they do is garnish it with sprayed whipped cream and cinnamon. Rice pudding really is a formula recipe like baking. Follow this recipe verbatim. I used golden raisins, my preference, and 2% milk as my only minor deviations. Do not use non fat milk, artificial sweeteners, or regular rice, and expect this to turn out thick and creamy. I made sure not to boil it at the end, as stated, so it did not separate. It stayed pudding like with that suggestion. Unless one eats large desserts, I would say this is probably closer to 5 servings. This one is being saved in the recipe box, for future rice pudding cravings. ty

I like the taste but I like more cinnamon, just a preference thing.
it turned out creamy like it should. I used a 0 calorie sweetener.
I can see eating some for dessert, snack, or even breakfast. Hot or cold. thanks, and Happy cooking!

The taste is amazing but I took a star away bc the tempering of the eggs was waaaay off. You must add enough hot mixture to the eggs to bring them up in temp to add to the rest of the pudding or else the eggs cook! The instructions just say "add a small amount of hot mixture" and that just doesn't cut it. I would like to spare someone else from the same mistake if possible. I also added a little extra sugar and no raisins and it is amazing. I've made it every day for a week now.

Love it! I can't stand raisins so I subbed with rough chopped walnuts. I followed the directions to a T, but ended up cooking the egg a tiny bit when I added it, BUT that's because I'm impatient and hungry and it smelled SOOOO good I NEEDED it! Sooner rather than later so... Yeah it's gone now. Taste like yum. ^-^

I loved it! Been searching for the right price pudding recipe for years so glad I found this one. It's always a hit. I sometimes use less raisins. And I use 1/2 c sugar. I've only had med size eggs before and used 2 turned out just the same. Great recipe and super quick and easy!

My mom used to make this when I was young. So glad I found the actual recipe because I tried to do it from memory, and while it was close...it wasn't quite right. Now, it will be perfect.

Super easy and good. I wanted to make this for a quick treat late night. Ran out of vanilla so I used almond extract and coconut extracts. Wanted more custardy so used two eggs and an extra yolk. Perfect and satisfying.

It took a while to thicken up. I think they suggested too much milk. The rice was not crunchy, but it was not soft either. Otherwise, it tasted good! If I choose to make this again, I would use less milk.

This turned out very good! I used the recipe as a guide since I made a few changes. I used leftover cooked Minute Rice and two cups of milk. The consistency was just right for my family.

Pretty good. I'd put 1/2 cup of raisins and use half a day half instead of milk next time and add Cinnamon up front.  Otherwise food recipe.

I have tried so many rice pudding recipes and been disappointed, but this one is awesome! It took me a few times to get it perfect, best advise, go slow, even though it’s a quick recipe, I just give it time.  I cooked the rice till it was done then added the sugar, the sugar seems to change the cook on the rice.  I doubled it,  but went down to just one egg, and put twoTBSP brown sugar & two tbsp butter in with the egg.  I wanted it more creamy, less custard’y, and I like sweet, but I also taste it to make sure it’s rite for me first.

We're Greek and we were raised on rice pudding but it is so cumbersome to make the old fashioned way! This is quick, easy and tastes just like my Yiayia (Grandma) used to make!

I reduced the milk to 2.5 cup. So it resulted in more creamy and thick pudding. Also  I reduced the amount of sugar to half of it, it is healthier and less sweat. I like this recipe! Perfect !

This was incredible! I will definitely make it again.  I was never a fan of Rice Pudding but this is the creamiest, sweetest Rice Pudding ever!! I did simmer it longer than the 6 minutes it stated just to thicken it up. You'll know its done while your stirring it often.   When adding the egg/vanilla mixture you HAVE to stir it in quickly to turn it into a custard like consistency .  This was the most delicious rice pudding I've ever had.

My first time making rice pudding, came out great! I omitted the cinnamon and raisins, and it's perfect with just the sweet vanilla flavour.

I've made this several times. The only change I make is to move some cinnamon in right at the beginning.

This rice pudding turned out with the rice still pretty hard and not pudding-like. I'm not sure where I went wrong with this recipe as I followed it to a T (except for the raisins because I don't care for them). In fact I cooked the rice for a little more than the recommended 6 minutes as I could tell it wasn't done. After I was done adding the egg, the rice still didn't look quite done but I thought it might soften up while it stood for 30 minutes - nope. When I came back after 30 minutes, the rice pudding had formed into a hard ball-like shape in the pot. To try to salvage it, I added another cup of milk and stirred, and more milk afterwards too. Still on the hunt for the perfect rice pudding recipe...

Mostly followed it, making my own changes and replacements and it turned out great! I used cashew milk instead of regular milk, added the raisins but also shredded coconut, mixed the vanilla in with the rest of the ingredients and skipped the eggs because I'm stick to a mainly vegan diet and quite frankly I think it's just added calories as mine thickened without it - to each their own :) . 
Awesome receipe and step by step!

Delicious and simple!  I substituted 1C. of unsweetened vanilla almond milk for 1 of the cups of milk, used half raisins, half craisins (it's all I had on hand), used half brown, half white sugar, and added a dash of nutmeg. This was easy and oh, so good!  Be patient with the eggs! I added mine too quickly and a tiny bit of the whites cooked.  It didn't affect the flavor or texture, but it wasn't as pretty.  Thanks for this recipe!!

I gave it five stars due to the ease of the recipe and the enormous amount of flavor these simple ingredients created. Followed it almost to the tee but added a dash of nutmeg and cooled it prior to serving. Sprinkled cinnamon and sugar after I scooped it in the bowls. The family thought it was great.

Made this recipe tonight. It tasted really good rice a little chewy gonna try to add more milk next time. The only thing I changed was I added the cinnamon and vanilla at the end when it started to thicken up.
