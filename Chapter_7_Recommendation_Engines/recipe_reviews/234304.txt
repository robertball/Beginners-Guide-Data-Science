I've been making this for years to give as gifts. Very fast and inexpensive. I sprinkle a little colored sugar (red and green) on the mixture once it's spread onto the wax paper before it cools completely; gives it a little more festive color.

Did no one else think the proportions of this recipe were completely off?  No one has a bowl big enough for these ingredients.  What a mess.

Very addictive. Quick and easy. Makes a lot -- I had to split it up into two large bowls. I used a little bit more white chocolate than called for ... but too much can be overwhelming.

Very good, easy and makes quite a lot.  Some of the amounts listed didn't jive with ingredients i purchased, but didn't seem to be a problem.  Makes nice gifts for friends and family.

The second time I made it, I accidentally bought rice Chex instead of corn--just as good!  I also added more bark: 36 oz total and a few more m&ms.  It stuck together better.  I think you could make as many variations as you want! Quick and easy!

This is a huge hit with kids big and small.  It’s particularly nice because you can tweak ingredients - I added M&Ms this time, I’ve also used coarsely crushed peppermint candy.
One caveat - I used the biggest bowl I own and still pushed cereal over the side.  Next time I’ll make this in two batches.  Less mess and more evenly incorporated white chocolate.

Fun way to interact with the kids and pull them away from themselves for awhile.   We found that using powdered sugar helped with final coating.

I made this recipe tonight, it makes a huge amount. Could have used more white chocolate. Next time I will either cut the recipe in half, or use 2 large bowls, as it was very difficult to mix thoroughly before the chocolate hardened. But very tasty

Yummy! I think I will be putting this in jars as gifts! I used gluten free pretzels and voila! We have a gluten free recipe. I also used rice and corn Chex.

Super easy to make and really versatile!  I've made it several times using different colored candies for different events.  Fruity Pebbles make it really festive an yummy too!

We made this with the kids for Christmas Eve.  Super easy to make but the kids had a hard time mixing it fast enough before the chocolate started to get hard.   I split it into two big bowls and probably could have used a third bowl. I would make it again but maybe only a half batch.  It made so much I ran out of containers to put it in.
