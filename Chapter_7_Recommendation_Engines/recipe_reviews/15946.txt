This recipe was delicious; not too sweet, not too tart.  I think I did something wrong because mine was very, very liquid after the suggested cooking time (plus some), but even then it tasted magnificent.  A couple of days later it had solidified a lot and was even better.
Does anyone know what could have gone wrong? The cranberries just seemed to meld with the liquid mixture and create a soup-like filling...

I normally don't like pecan pie because it's too sweet, but I made it because my husband likes it and the cranberries make it festive.  The cranberries also add a tiny bit of tartness to the pie which was nice.  It also added a little bit of color peaking out from between the pecans.  Very pretty!

I made this pie last year (2000) for Thanksgiving and got raves from almost 20 guests.  Also many requests from the recipe.  I can't wait to sink my teeth into it again this year.  It has definitely become a part of our family Thanksgiving tradition.

************************************************
This is a wonderful recipe. Its a new way to add cranberries to the holidays. My family calls me a "pie snob" because I bake a lot of pies and I am very picky. I think the cranberries are a perfect compliment to the pecan pie. I have made this recipe 3 times and everyone that I served it to gave it rave reviews. This pie will be one I make for every holiday. I will also make it for myself!! I AM picky and I would give this pie 10 stars if I could. Carolyn, Bless your heart for sharing this recipe with us.

Delicious! The cranberries were tart to balance the sweet, which is what we like.  The pie was soft and warm even after one hour. I don't know if it takes longer to cool than others as I haven't done a pecan pie in a few decades.  I didn't know if the term "mix" when combining the sugars, eggs, butter, and all, was with a mixer or by hand.  I used the mixer until it was blended. I hope I didn't overblend it and that's why it was soft. I'll have to do some research on pecan pies before I bake this again.  Hubby said he would like more cranberries, too.

I really wanted to like this pie, because I'm not a huge Pecan Pie fan, but my husband is. Neither of us were impressed  by this pie. I because the flavor of the Mace was overwhelming, him because he felt like I ruined a perfectly good Pecan Pie with the cranberries. This pie wasn't a "quick sell" in my house.

I made this pie with very high hopes, but alas, I didn't like it at all.  The combination of flavors just isn't to my taste.  I love pecans, and I love cranberry, but not together.

I'm giving this 5 stars even though next time I will change a little. The taste is incredible (I did cut the mace down to 1/8 tsp.). My husband and I both loved it. My issue is that the pie doesn't set up like it should. Next time I will try 4 eggs instead of 3 and if that doesn't do it, I will try dusting the cranberries with a little flour before putting in pie crust. Wonderfully delicious pie. Update on 11/25/18...I made this pie 2 more times. I stirred 1 tbsp. of all-purpose flour into the cranberries before placing them into the pie plate. Turned out perfect both times. Delicious pie, everyone loves it.

Cranberry pecan pie turned out really well!  The cranberry bits bubble up as the pie is baked, creating a festive red color.  Everyone at our Christmas dinner really enjoyed it and thought the cranberries added a layer of complexity, while taking off the overly sweet edge of a traditional pecan pie.

Adding the cranberries made the pie not be as sweet as a traditional pecan pie.  Which made my dad happy as he is not really into sweet things. Also I used splenda instead of sugar, and made splenda corn syrup (1 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar and 1/4 cup hot liquid (water or liquid in recipe) mix together to make 1 cup dark corn syrup substitute). The pie did perfect so my grandma was able to eat it with us.

Made this for Thanksgiving, and again for Christmas after the rave reviews I got from the family. This is such a delicious pie. The only addition I made is I sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on the crust before I filled it, and some over the pecans once I topped it.  This will probably be my signature dish to make for family gatherings!

The local cafe makes a version of this with white corn syrup and it is my favorite.  So happy to have the recipe.  I made it as written, but baked for 1 hr 10 minutes as it did not want to set.  Even though I wiatied until completely cooled it still was slightly liquid.  I may put a teaspoon for cornstarch in there next time.

This pie came out pretty but did not fill my pie pan. It was a nice change from your normal pecan pie. The cranberry really helps cut the sweetness of a traditional pecan pie. It was well received but I don't think I would make it again.
