I liked this, but I really missed the lime flavor that you find in a traditional margarita.  I know that lemon complements raspberries very well (perhaps better than lime), but if I were to make this again, I'd tried substituting lime juice for the lemon.  I guess what I'm saying is that although this was good, I wouldn't call it a margarita, rather a frozen raspberry cocktail.    I followed this recipe to the letter, but had to add a bunch of ice cubes to reach a "frozen" consistency.

I used black raspberries instead of red, but otherwise followed the recipe. Very tasty and refreshing on a hot Summer evening.

I didn’t have superfine sugar, so I put regular sugar in the blender first and gave it a buzz to make it superfine then added the remainder of the ingredients.  This was a refreshing and tasty margarita, a nice change of flavor from my usual strawberry margaritas.  If you like raspberries, you’ll love this drink.
