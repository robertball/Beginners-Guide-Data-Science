These were absolutely wonderful. I used Sarah's Applesauce recipe with Sweetango apples. No sugar added to applesauce. Did I mention that we thought these were wonderful? Yum.Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Easy, healthy, yummy...what more can you ask for? My kids loved them and thought they were regular pancakes. Score! The only mod I made was that I didn't add any water. It had a great consistency already.

This recipe was easy to follow and cooked up similar to wheat flour based pancakes.  They are not dense like many other paleo recipes and the texture is pretty close.  I used a pureed peach instead of applesauce (because it's what I had on hand) and I did not need to add any extra water.  I served this with a peach-blueberry compote and it was delicious.

I am addicted to these pancakes!  I use a combination of almond flour and coconut flour instead of the all-almond flour component, and they are not too grainy/nutty then.

I added some nutmeg and  a touch of clove to serve with saut√©ed apples and walnuts. This was by far the best paleo pancake recipe we've made  so far. The batter raised nicely and had the texture of a wheat pancake.

This is an easy go-to recipe for our on-the-go family.  I streamline the steps...I simply put all the ingredients in a personal sized blender (like a nutri-bullet or ninja), and give it a whir.  While it is resting (which I absolutely recommend...don't skip this step), the kids get dressed and ready for the day.   I pour the batter right out of the blender onto the griddle, and the family comes to the table as the pancakes are coming hot off the griddle.  These pancakes don't have either the look or feel of a paleo pancake, so the kids don't turn up their noses.  They gobble them down and ask for more.

Great consistency, very much like regular pancakes.  I added our usual chopped walnuts and blueberries to the recipe, and it came out tasting like our wheat based pancakes.

I made the pancakes exactly as the recipe.  It was delicious!  The pancakes formed like a wheat pancake and was not too sweet.  I added butter as I turned the them and ate without syrup.  Thanks for sharing

I have made countless paleo pancakes and these are now my favorite. Easy, consistent and soooo good. I take these to work as a snack and heat in the toaster. I like them plain or with blueberries but i put chocolate chips in for my kids.

I make this recipe all the time and my family just loves it!  The only thing I don't add is the 3 tbsp of water since the consistency is perfect as is. Other than that, you don't have to change anything else! Comes out perfect every time!

Made this for my daughter that wants pancakes every single morning of her life, and the rest of the family visiting. I personally hate pancakes. All loved these!  Even me!

I've made this recipe twice in a week and we always gobble it up instantaneously. They are amazing with maple syrup and also with fruit preserves. Just immense. I'll be making these again and again!!

My changes were out of necessity: one egg, buttermilk instead of water.
