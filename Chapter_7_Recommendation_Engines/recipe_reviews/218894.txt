Yum! Easy to make and the kids loved it! I used 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 cream so it wasn't so heavy and it turned out great!

I gave it four stars for the following reasons:
1. I've never had Swedish Meatballs before and don't know what it's supposed to taste like.  
2. When I was finished with the recipe, I had to add a dollup of sour cream - the soy sauce flavor was very strong.  Husband said this helped a ton! DH loved it - DS, who is picky, didn't let a drop hit the floor (and he doesn't like red meat!).

I used the video tutorial from Allrecipes.com to make the Swedish meatballs to complement the sauce. It is fast and easy. The overall taste was good. I may continue to research other sauces.

This is a good starter sauce for you to customize to your own tastes. I started with my favorite brown gravy mix (Southeastern Mills - very good!). When it was thickened to my liking, I added a concentrated beef stock, 1 can of cream of chicken soup, soy sauce & worcestershire. A little bit of sour cream for tang & a splash of red wine to thin it a bit. I added the sauce to already warmed meatballs and let it finish in the oven. Served over butter noodels - very good!

I love the simplicity of this recipe. I am legally blind, so in order to make things even easier,I have made up several seasoning blends from this site. In this dish I used my own Swedish Seasoning Blend.. It consists of 2 tsp Sea salt; 1 tsp each: allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg & fresh cracked black pepper. I use 1 tsp for 4 servings in a recipe replacing all other seasonings. and with that change this was a 5 star for us.  Bobbi

I tried this recipe and substituted the beef broth with french onion soup and the soy sauce with Worchesire sauce.  It was great.

This was wonderful. Try adding a splash of sherry, 1/2 tablespoon of Dale's steak seasoning and a small can of mushroom slices for a different, and awesome alternative.  We served these at a wine tasting and they were a huge hit!

I used homemade chicken broth in place of beef stock.  I also switched out the cup of cream with 1/2 c half&half and a 1/2c sour cream.  It was really good.

I made these for a Christmas buffet.  They were easy and very tasty.  I Kept them warm in a crock pot which seemed to enhance their flavor even more.  Everyone enjoyed them.

My 7 and 9 year olds loved this!  I added a dash of allspice to the sauce and used Wondra to thicken it up a bit.  It was smooth and creamy with great flavor!

Great and easy base recipe- I like that the beef broth makes it less over the top creamy. But there must be a typo because 1t of pepper was WAY TOO MUCH!! I also liked adding a bit of allspice and cloves to make it more like my Gramma's.

This recipe on its own isn't very good, but its a good start to the sauce!! I had to mix garlic, paprika, more flour, and butter to give it flavor and body.  After adding the extra spices it tasted very delicious!! Its a fast easy sauce and this is my second time making it *I didn't use the rosemary because I don't care for that spice*

Super easy, and very tasty. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that my husband said he didn't like the soy sauce in it. I thought it was delicious! The only change I made was to use much less pepper than called for, as other reviewers recommended. I just did a few twists from the pepper mill. My 2 and 4 year olds gobbled this up too. I'll definitely be making this again!

Very good and satisfied everyone.  Only made a couple of tweaks based on the reviews and what I had on hand.  I had  1  1/2 cups beef broth to use which I mixed with 3/4 cup milk (it looked like the right color that way, and  I wanted more broth than milk).  I added 1 T Worcestershire sauce, 1 t rosemary, 1 t seasoned salt, and a few grinds of black pepper.  Instead of the flour I thickened with 2 T cornstarch.  At the end I added 2 T sour cream.  I highly recommend the extra Worcestershire sauce, seasoned salt and sour cream for their extra flavor.

Delicious!! My family loved it:) I used homemade meatballs and served it all over steamed white rice. The only changes I made were to use chicken broth in place of beef, and omit the rosemary since we had none. Turned out perfect!! I am sure it would be even better with the rosemary. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!! Will be using it often:)

I loved the base of this recipe, but we really love spices, so I added a 1 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, 2 tsp. dried basil, a tsp. of cracked pepper, and a tsp. of spanish thyme.  Its definitely a keeper!

Bland. Boring. It got too thick.  I did not use the pepper as directed because it's just too much pepper. Used my own homemade meatballs.

As per previous suggestions: It requires sour cream and a packet of onion soup mix. I find powdered skim mixed extra-strong (or to taste) makes a great substitute for cream without added fat - my picky eaters can never tell!

I admit, I strayed from the original recipe so take this review for what it's worth. I subbed a can of turkey gravy I had in the fridge for the longest time ever for the beef broth, used half-and-half instead of heavy cream, omitted flour since the sauce was think enough already, and didn't include rosemary either. I also increased the soy sauce to 1/2 tablespoon and decreased pepper to only 1/4 teaspoon, and the sause was peppery enough! Oh, and I threw in about 2 tablespoons of sour cream. Served it with turkey meatballs... delicious! The sause tasted a lot like the one they sell at IKEA to go with their meatballs. I almost wanted to drink it, lol.

I really like how easy this recipe it. It needs a lot more soy sauce for taste, so I added about 1-2 TBSP of soy sauce. Rosemary can be a little strong, I might try using dill instead next time. I also used a crockpot to keep the meatballs warm at a potluck party, and the flavors were even better the longer it was in the crockpot.

I used vegetable stock and sour cream instead of beef and heavy cream. I added mushrooms. I made with frozen turkey meatballs and it was amazing.

We doubled the recipe, and it is the best by far! We substituted the soy sauce with Worcestershire, which is used in traditional recipes. This was the best we have ever made, and we have many different types. My children loved it, and they’re a tough crowd to please.

This had a nice flavor but was on the salty side.  Next time I will use beef broth from a roast.  I don't care for rosemary so I used nutmeg and a little garlic and complete seasoning.  The sauce didn't thicken but I used a crock pot and that is probably why.  I will try again.

Great recipe.  I made it non-dairy by using cashew cream instead of heavy cream.  I also made it vegan by using vegetable broth and added no beef bullion.  I also added 1/2 tbsp of minced garlic and 1 tbsp of sherry. Instead of meatballs, I used Beyond Meat Swedish meatballs.  Served it over brown rice - it was a hit! I will definitely make it again.

I'll try this again.  It called for  too much pepper for me and my family, next time I'll cut it in half.  I didn't have heavy cream so I used evaporated milk and a little extra flour.  I also used an Italian Seasoning blend in place of the  Rosemary. The little changes turned out well.

This is a great sauce to start with if you have never made this dish before and are trying to do it on a budget. Vety sumple and easy to season to your own taste. I would suggest adding a dollop of sour cream and a dashbof salt as the original recipe tends to come out a little bland even eith the soy sauce.

I doubled the recipe with no trouble and used a full bag of frozen meatballs. I also added just a dash of worcestershire sauce in addition to the soy. Very satisfying and easy dinner.

I accidentally doubled the rosemary. Yikes! Anyway, we loved this dish, but next time I'll add more soy because for us, it wasn't salty for us. Maybe some salt instead. I think I will try sage next time too.  Thank you for this great recipe, and I know wroth a few tweaks for my family's tastes, it will be a 5 star meal!

Fantastic sauce recipe! I doubled the recipe and I added 1 teaspoon dill weed and 1/4 cup white wine. I used less pepper and less rosemary than the recipe calls for. I made my own meatballs from Chef John's Swedish Meatballs on this site. After browning the meatballs for about 15 minutes I put them in the sauce to simmer for 20 minutes. It was great with mashed potatoes and even better with noodles for the next day leftovers! Not at all bland and the sauce was just the right consistency.

I made this tonight. Have a bigger family so basically I just doubled all ingredients. It was too peppery so then I added a little bit more Soy sauce to add a little bit more salty flavor.

The sauce was easy to make but once I the the frozen meatballs in in took quite a bit more time to get the sauce and meatballs all hot enough to serve. So I would say unless you defrost your meatballs first expect it to take longer than 5 min.

I served this over noodles. I was excited about it. I would say I enjoyed it very much. However, my family did not. They said it smelled horrible and turned their noses. Apparently, it was the Rosemary they did not like. Since that is the only thing that really had an aroma. Oh well. So if Rosemary is not your thing, either don't use it or use much less than I did. Like I said before I doubled the whole recipe.

The best thing about this recipe is the ease of assembly.  Everything into one pot and it comes out really creamy and rich.  I sauteed a small amount of finely chopped onion and some fresh mushrooms in some butter and deglazed with white wine before adding the  broth mixture.  Turned out great.  The pepper tastes really wonderful.   Reminisant of green peppercorn sauce for steak.

1 tsp of pepper way too much for this recipe. I then followed a reply that said to add Nutmeg, Cinnamon and allspice.  1 Tsp each.  This ruined it for my kids.

Great sauce for my Ikea meatballs.  I thought the teaspoon of black pepper was too much though.  I would only add about 1/2 that.  I also had no heavy cream so I used 2% milk and thickened it with more additional Wondra flour.  Will definitely make again (with the cream!)

Doesn't seem to need quite so much flour, maybe half. It was way too thick. I ended up adding an entire can of beef broth to thin it out some. On the other hand, it needs more soy sauce, maybe 3 tbsp. Nonetheless, very flavorful, and husband really liked.

This was amazing. I made it exactly how the recipe states but I added a quarter block of cream cheese to the recipe and that added some creaminess to the sauce.

Didn't have the Swedish meatball taste.  I added dried minced onions and lots of garlic powder to give it some flavor.  It was a hit at the party so the flavor of the frozen Swedish meatballs came through.

Very good and super easy!  I had to use chicken broth since I was out of beef broth, but it was still tasty.  This recipe makes a lot of sauce, which is great when serving over egg noodles.  Can't wait to try it with beef broth to see the difference in taste but I am sure it will be great!

I made this according to the recipe. It wasn't enough for the noodles so I doubled it. The sauce tastes like it's missing something. After reading quite a few reviews, I added a dash (literally a dash): all spice, paprika, nutmeg, sage, garlic powder and thyme. I let the sauce cook with the meatballs for about an hour and it came out amazing. My three year old devoured this. Thank you for this recipe and thank you all for adding your review.

This sauce was exactly what I needed to go with my egg noodles & Costco meatballs. So simple to whip this up, I can't believe I don't make swedish meatballs as a meal more often. Thank you for the straightforward and good base recipe. Keeping this in my favorites as I'll likely resource it plenty of times to come.

I made this last Saturday and everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe except that I used only 5 (instead of 6) tablespoons of flour). The only change I made was to add a half cup of cooking sherry.

My son said it was not bad. I did have to make this Gluten free so it could of been the gluten free products that I substituted. It came out a little bit sweet which may have added to his response. Not use to a sweet sweetish meatball sauce. I used potatoes flour and, 2 beef bouillon cubes and gluten free soy sauce and heavy whipping cream with some pepper.

Did a DNA test and it came back 17% Swedish.  My wife said, "No wonder you make such good meatballs!"

...do I dare tell her I got it here?   They're ALWAYS a big hit wherever I serve them.

Very good recipe, though my serving size was increased to 16 instead of 4, and some changes were made, mostly to prevent overkill with certain ingredients.  

I quadrupled the original recipe, though had some extra changes.  
I did not have any heavy cream, so it was replaced with 2-2/3 cups of milk mixed with 1-1/3 cups of melted margarine/butter.  
I did not add as much soya sauce as the recipe suggested (this was just for personal health reasons)
I only added about 1tsp of rosemary 
 Some salt was sprinkled on at the end.  
Very good when served over rice.  
Was a huge hit with the family.  10/10 will make again.

I would have made the recipe exactly as written if I'd had all the ingredients. As it was, I subbed chicken gravy mix for the beef broth, 1/2 cup 2% milk and 1/2 cup sour cream for the heavy cream and I used 1 tsp soy and 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce. I also added a decent slug of cooking sherry, a 1/2 tsp of onion powder and a can of sliced mushrooms. It was tasty but salty. Next time I'll cut back on the Worcestershire sauce and omit the rosemary. I did not care for it in this dish. I'll use parsley.

Super easy! I've made this twice now. The 1st time I used the full tsp of black pepper and it way a little too much for my taste buds. Last night I made it again using only 3/4th tsp of black pepper. It was still enough to have the peppery taste, but not too much. I also replaced some of the cream with 2% milk to make it a tiny bit healthier. While I wouldn't add this to a weekly routine because of the richness, we will be having it as a treat a few times a year.

I doubled the recipe in doing so I found the rosemary and the pepper overpowering. I loved the texture of the sauce though. I will make it again but being more aware of the spiciness of the pepper, and strength of the Rosemary. 
I also 1/2 cup less cream and more broth as I didn’t want it so heavy and I found it was perfect consistency.

Love it. Made it exactly according to recipe, twice. The first time I used frozen (thawed) meatballs, and the second freshly made. I recommend if you make them put them in the freezer for at least a while. I ended up cooking the meatballs for more than five minutes and the sauce nearly separated. Anyway, thank you for the recipe! My family loves it.

Added sour cream, less pepper, garlic & basil.  It is great after those adjustments and cooking on low for at least an hour after adding the meatballs.  I think mushrooms would be another good addition.  Had it over egg noodles and had to have another helping!

REALLLLLY good (and much better than any premade or packaged version I’ve found). For dinner plus plenty of leftovers for lunches etc, I doubled the recipe, used 2 x 14oz packages of frozen meatballs and 1 standard size bag of egg noodles. I was out of dried Rosemary but replaced with Simply Oragnic’s garlic herb seasoning blend (I added by “feel” & smell... but probably 1-2 tsps). Anyway, add some steamed veggies on the side and it makes an incredible, filling, quick meal for 4 plus always useful leftovers)

I loved this sauce.  In the future, I'll probably add mushrooms and onions to it.

Very good, very easy.  After making it tonight, I will read more reviews and try others ideas to expand it.  My first  test revision would be to add sour cream.  I also will try the Worcestershire  because that sounds good.    We love IKEA meatballs, and this is an easy sauce to make a quick dinner.

I made this sauce tonight as written. My only exception was that I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted 3/4 cup milk and 4 tbsp of butter. I thought it was delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I really enjoy this recipe- and all of my kids do too. I made a couple changes: increased the soy sauce (we love soy sauce), used fresh rosemary and then ground it with a pestle and mortar, and used Italian sausage meatballs. Awesomesauce!

Fabulous! I did need to lighten the pepper by adding more fat-free half and half , so I will be less heavy-handed with it.  I also used the half and half instead of cream to save fat and calories. A little nutmeg rounded it out. Lovely dinner served over egg noodles and sprinkled with fresh chopped parsley.

This sauce is great, except one thing. Way too much black pepper. I had to double everything else to cut it.. great flavor otherwise.

I expected more but was still very satisfied.  My husband does not like pasta so I served with baby golden potatoes.  Added extra beef bouillon (because of potatoes), a bit of celery salt, fresh thyme, a bit of onion salt and a bit of salt.  I would have added more flour to thicken more.  Overall a nice dish.  With pasta I would have liked it a lot more.  A rich dish that needs to be served with pasta in spite of the hubby.

I reduced the flour content to 1 tablespoon and it was thick enough dried rosemary has little flavour compared to fresh, crushed, so that is what I used. Very good but I think the sauce was still a little thick I will add a little water next time. 3.5 stars from me.

This sauce is easy and delicious. I did add a dash of nutmeg which really brings out that “authentic” Swedish meatball flavor that Americans are so fond of.  I added some homemade meatballs and it was a delicious dish. I will definitely be adding this recipe to the meal rotation.

Delicious, but to be honest we added more salt at the end to taste. It was easy to make. 
My boyfriend loved it and so did I. We are both extremely stuffed. 
We made it with turkey meatballs too, that were frozen. We needed a change up!

This is a great basic recipe!  We enjoyed it very much, even the picky 6-year-old gobbled it up.  I took others' advice adding the onion soup mix as well as the sour cream.  I will be putting this in our dinner rotation beginning next month!  Thanks for such a great recipe.

really tasty... and hubby said he liked it better than his moms recipe!   I used this recipe and basically just doubled some of the ingredients and threw it all in a crockpot. I threw my frozen meatballs, Worcestershire sauce, beef stock, and rosemary all in a crockpot on high for 3 hours. I sprayed the crock with a non-stick spray first. I stirred about once an hour. Then I added to the meatballs in the crock another 1/2 cup beef stock, 3 more tsp Worcestershire sauce, pepper to taste, garlic salt (a pinch), another 1/2 tsp rosemary.  I mixed together 2 cups cream and 6 tbsp flour and poured that in the crock. I let all that cook on high for another hour. It thickened up really nice.

The recipe is okay but needs tweaking.  For one thing, I cut the cream amount in half and added milk instead.  I also added tomato paste (a couple of level tablespoons) and Sriracha for some kick because I found it too bland and anodyne otherwise.

Made this along with Swedish Meatballs for company and got raves.  I followed the instructions but added sour cream at the very end.   My Aunt used to make this and the flavors in this recipe reminded me of hers.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

It was super easy and had a great flavor.  I didn't have heavy cream so used half & half and the only other change was worcestershire in lieu of soy sauce.  My husband says it is a keeper!

Very good . I made it dairy free with cashew milk and gluten free flour. I did not care for the frozen meatballs and will try making my own.

I doubled the recipe because we can never have enough sauce. I used store bought Swedish Meatballs and egg noodles. My 11 year old son went back for thirds and my husband seconds.

So uh. I kinda followed the recipe. I didn't have any beef stock so I used a packet of beef flavored ramen. Put it in a cup of hot water with some flour and heavy cream. It came out really good hahaha

- doubled the recipe
- microwaved approx. 15 meatballs for about 2 minutes before adding them into the sauce, then heated for about 5 minutes before adding in full package of noodles
- used 2 beef bouillon squares, 1 cube to 1/2 cup of water
- added in about 1/2 cup of sour cream plus a few dashes of worcester sauce
- absolutely delicious; hiding in the back of the fridge away from my family

I have made this several times already. Very easy, quick and very, very good. After making it the first time I doubled all of the ingredients to make more gravy/sauce for the meatballs and to ensure leftovers.

Not that great.  Followed the recipe.  OK sauce if doing quick sauce for meatballs.  Really does not taste anything like sweatshirt meatballs though.

Great sauce but I had to majorly tone down the pepper.  My kids didn't enjoy it because they thought it was too hot. I think next time I will use 1/4 teaspoon instead.

I didn't have rosemary, which didn't seem to affect the taste much. However, I found that it was rather spicy/too peppery, so next time I would try halving the pepper.
It was really quick and easy to do overall, and since I hadn't thawed out the meatballs in advance, I cooked them in a lidded skillet for about 15 minutes, then added them for the last five minutes of cooking the sauce, which worked out really well.

This was pretty good. I did find the sauce got way too thick, so I probably wouldn't use 3tbsp again, but other than that, the flavour was pretty good. I did start off with some butter, onion, and garlic as a base because who doesn't love that?! 
I would definitely make again, but this time I would make it less thick. If it's less thick it may not be too bad for over noodles, but because it was so thick this time, having it over noodles was weird. Also, I used 1% milk instead of cream, because that's all I had in the house.
Next time I could see just doing meatballs with a really  nice caesar salad on the side.
I would definitely make this again.

Read the reviews and followed some of the advice. Cut the pepper to 1/2 tsp and cooked them in the crock pot on high for 4 hours. Husband gave it 5 stars. I plan to use this gravy recipe for sausage gravy with biscuits and chip beef gravy.

Very pleased with this recipe.  I wanted to make something quick and Swedish meatballs sounded good, but I already had some frozen meatballs and didn't want a recipe for the meatballs.  I have to say that  I almost never cook anything without adding onions and fresh garlic, so I sauteed onions and garlic then proceeded to follow the recipe exactly after that.  Personally, I like the addition of the onions and garlic.  I just think it added to the flavor.  The flavor was pretty good.  I will definitely be saving this recipe and using it again in the future.

Pretty good!  I like that this recipe does not use butter.  I did sauté an onion to add to sauce and used 1/2 1% milk 1/2 1/2&1/2.  It still tasted rich and creamy and thickened up nicely.  This would be yummy with mushrooms!

I followed the directions exactly but cut in half for portion size(single serving) My son loved it. He had Swedish Meatballs at IKEA a couple of weeks ago and asked me if I can make them.   Got it! Thanks for the recipe - I didn't have a clue how to this!

Worst swedish meatballs I've ever had! Not sure how  everyone else seemed to enjoy it but for those of you reading the reviews before making , cut the pepper in half! This had so much pepper that my tongue was numb after the first few bites and I nearly got sick. Not at all impressed.

There was way too much black pepper and rosemary.  We threw it away.  I think this recipe has potential.  Next time I'll omit both ingredients and add some seasoning salt.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for and thought it was a great basic sauce recipe.  I liked the peppery taste to it but felt like it was missing something.  I think next time I'm going to add a bit of sour cream to it.

First time I made it exactly as recipe calls for. It was a little too much black pepper. My daughter does not like to "taste" too much pepper. Next time I cut the pepper in half and it was perfect. I serve it over bowtie noodles. My family can't get enough of it. So easy to make compared to other recipes that call for a lot of ingredients.

Tasted good when we first had it, left overs were not very good. Sauce was absorbed by the noodles. I should have kept the noddles separate. Live and learn,

Very good sauce..Made a few adjustments, added 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon thyme  instead of rosemary to the mix and followed the same directions as written.  
Will make again

Sauce was a bit on the more creamy side rather than like a beef gravy style, I think if I make it again I will only do 3/4 cup of cream or maybe use a different recipe also the flavor profile was a bit bland so I added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning as well as half a chopped onion and a small can of mushrooms drained. I also used home made turkey meatballs

I added a bunch of salt as it was bland and I'm not even a salt person. and added butter to the noodles before I poured the sauce on but we all loved it. My picky four year old loved it, I loved it, boyfriend ate two huge plates. It was so good. Great way to dress up frozen meatballs. A million times better than store bought sauce.

Personally,  this had too much rosemary for my liking.  I'm not big on herbs when cooking.  Otherwise,  it was really easy to make. I made this over rice.  I uses a 28oz bag of frozen beef meatballs (not a turkey fan) and doubled the sauce recipe.

Our family had mixed reviews, half of them preferred other recipes I had used over this one. This one was quite creamy however, next time I would spice it up a bit.

I used chicken stock and whole milk instead of beef/cream. I added a bit of gravy master for color/flavor. It worked out really well.

I took a user's advice and added a sprinkle of allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg.  My kids love it.  It's a keeper.  I omitted the rosemary because my kids don't like it.

This was so easy and yummy!  Even my 5-year-old scarfed it down!  I used chicken stock because that's what I had on hand and a sauteed onion.   I ended up using a whole 20-ounce bag of meatballs because there was plenty of sauce and I wanted leftovers.  Loved this simple delicious recipe!

There's little to no flavor in this sauce. I had a feeling something was wrong when I saw to use beef broth and not gravy.  It was runny and never thickend.

Made this for my super picky husband and he loved it!  I made a few adjustments because the bag of frozen meatballs I purchased was 32 oz., so I used a cup and a half of stock and a cup and a half of cream.  I found this to be quite heavy, though so next time I plan to use half skim milk and half heavy cream.  I also added a splash of worchestire sauce and sherry along with two heaping table spoons of sour cream. Without those additions the sauce was rather bland. I found the sauce was easy to thicken and because I let the meatballs defrost a bit, they heated up quickly.  It was a fast meal that came across as rather gourmet.

This was great! I did add stuff like others did: paprika and nutmeg and garlic too. I also added extra soy sauce because mine was lite and didn't have much salt, and I added sour cream too. Next time I will add some mushrooms, yum!

Very fast and easy! I'm not a big Swedish meatball fan, but my boyfriend loves them and we always make them when we host parties. I had to make this last minute with a house full of ppl. Everyone loved it! I added jelly because I've always heard that's what your supposed to do. It was great!

Tried to find something different for the meatballs and this was good.  However, I really altered according to reviews so don't know what the original tastes like.  I subbed thyme for rosemary, cornstarch for flour, cut way back on the pepper and added splashes of soy sauce, worcestershire, nutmeg, and a couple of pinches of sugar.  Will make again and try to duplicate.

Great recipe, but I did add some worchestire sauce, about 1 tablespoon. I also had to triple the recipe and only added 1 tablespoon of rosemary. Turn out perfect.

LOVED LOVED LOVED this.  Super-easy, and exactly what I was craving.  I always add nutmeg to any swedish meatballs recipe (I even add it to variations of meatloaf), and the nutmeg just kicked it up to 6 stars.  We did serve it over egg noodles, with a side of steamed asparagus.  Doubled the recipes for family, and not one meatball or drop of sauce was left!!!!!

I made this receipe with a few tweeks from some of the other raters. The receipe is for a serving of 8. I used 8oz of sour cream and 1 cup of whole milk because I had no other creams in the home.  I scaled back on the rosemary and black pepper.  It was great.  I also made homemade meatballs to go with it.

My family loves this. I've never had Swedish meatballs before this recipe, so I can't say it's authentic. However, it's really good. I gave it 4 stars because it isn't perfect, especially because I had to tweak it. I didn't use frozen meatballs; I used unfrozen turkey meatballs. I sautéd them in a pan with a little olive oil and sprinkled a dash of allspice on them. Make the sauce like it says and add the tablespoon of sour cream in the end like a previous user had said. Beware, the rosemary is tough, I enjoy the texture, but the kids don't. If you like the all spice taste sprinkle a little more in the sauce. It's delicious! ***You can make your own allspice, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Shake it up, and save the extra for future use.***

WAY WAY too much pepper - kids did not care for it. Try maybe a TSP instead of a TBSP. Added sour cream which helped a bit.

this was so easy and delicious. I keep a bag of homemade meatballs in the freezer for a quick dinner like sandwiches or pasta but wanted something different. This fit the bill perfectly. The sauce and meatballs were done before the nooodles. thanks for sharing.

I have made this recipe a couple times now, and it is absolutely delicious.  My only complaint is that my sauce separates...so it looks kinda icky if you didn't just stir it often.  Maybe I have been doing something wrong...I really wish I knew what to do to prevent that from happening.

I halved it because I was cooking for one. I didn't want to bring it down too low. However, I didn't have heavy cream I had half and half. I like my sauce thicker so I added more flour. 

I was hesitant with the soy sauce but so glad I chose this recipe. It was delicious! It's got a slight sweetness that really compliments lingonberry jam!

Just bought a bag of the pre-cooked Swedish meatballs at Ikea and needed a sauce. After reading some of the reviews here and relying on my memory of the ones my mother  made I came up with these additions: 1 can of Consomme (instead of beef broth) and 1 can of water, 1 can of heavy cream, 1 teaspoon of Onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon each of Nutmeg and Allspice and 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt. Follow the directions on the basic recipe above including the soy sauce. It was PERFECT! I served it over wide egg noodles......AMAZING!

I purchased premade meatballs and was looking for an easy sauce for those days when I need a quick meal. I substituted lowfat  milk for the heavy cream and it turned out okay. I thought the amount of pepper the recipe called for was alittle heavy for my kids taste.I personally liked it, but the kids said it was spicy ;)

So wonderful--I'm making it again tonight, and I just made it last week! I added less cream and more flour and milk for a thickener. Not because I'm diet-conscious, but because it's less expensive, and that way I have some cream for the mashed potatoes I serve it on. Yum! :)

My family loved this. I put in 1/2 the soy sauce (just due to sodium), and 2/3 the black pepper because of the kids. Next time, I'll do 1/2 black pepper and let the family add more at the dinner table. But this was SUPER easy to make and tasted great. This will definitely become a regular at my table!

I love this recipe as a starting base. I then go along and add a ton of ground stuff like basil, garlic, minced onion, few tbs of sour cream instead of heavy cream,etc.

It turns out well each time, thank u for this recipe inspiration!

This is a nice basic sauce. You can flavor it any way to adapt to your taste. I didn't use that much pepper, used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy, and added a bit of sugar...it came out great!

I have made this sauce several times without altering the recipe a bit, and you can't beat the flavor and simplicity! I serve it over egg noodles and everyone in the family from my husband and my parents down to my toddler daughter loves it.

This is really tasty. I gave it 4 stars only because mushrooms and a bit of salt is a must. I sauteed' the mushrooms first with some garlic grapeseed oil and pure butter til al dente. do not drain. Then add mushrooms to other ingredients and wisk. The bit of flavor that adds makes all the difference!

This did not taste like swedish meatballs! My husband has been craving swedish meatballs for awhile-I am not a experienced cook by any means. I figured if no one will show me i will teach myself. Well I went wrong with this recipe. I followed it exactly and the sauce tastes more like "biscuits and gravy" gravy-not swedish meatballs. It is edible but not what i expected. I read some other reviews that said the pepper was too much....well  i liked the pepper-especially since without it you wouldn't have much of a taste at all.disappointed

Sorry to say, but the McCormick Swedish Meatballs packet has more flavor.  All I could taste with this recipe was the black pepper.  Will stick with the packet.

Very simple swedish meatballs. You can change this up to your liking. We don't like the sour cream version. Will definitely make this again dressed up the way we like.

I made this for supper tonight, and with the exception of using half and half instead of cream, I followed the recipe exactly. I love black pepper, but next time I'll cut that in half. Other than that, I loved it and will make it again.  I'll try it with dill next time, too.

Very easy.  I'm a big sauce lover and I am always using butter and cream based ideas (however, trying to minimize cost and keep flavor, I use half and half most of the time).  I didn't have rosemary, and it is fine without it.  I made meatballs earlier in the day as the market had the ground beef on sale, so I figured I'd use some in a tomato based sauce and some with this sauce.  I froze half of my meatballs, and since this sauce is so easy AND CUSTOMIZABLE (I'm thinking pesto next time to be added in), keeping meatballs handy is great.
Thanks for giving me fresh ideas.

This was extremely bland as written.  I made it and tasted it and was not at all impressed.  The only way I could save it was to add sour cream and a packet of onion soup mix.  If I could give it no stars I would.

Even though it seems like a lot of pepper to add, it gives the sauce just enough kick for those that can take the heat.
