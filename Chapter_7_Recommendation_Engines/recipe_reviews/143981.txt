This is a really good (and unique) marinade. Super easy to make with ingredients most of us already have in our pantry. I made beef and veggie kabobs on the bbq using this marinade. They turned out very well nice robust flavour. I was only able to marinade for about 7 hrs but the meat was still tender. The molasses flavour really dominates so if you like molasses you will probably like this recipe.

The beef was tender sweet and tasty. The tips were a hit at a family gathering. I highly recommend this recipe!

A thick and tasty marinade. I followed the recipe but quartered the onion rings. I only had three steaks to grill on the BBQ so I could have just halved the recipe and there would have been enough. Will definitely make again.

I am making this tonight. Have made it before and used flank steak. Love it! My fiance is not big on beef but was disappointed when we ate all the steak because he loved it so much. Said he would eat it every day forever if I made it that often!

WAY too much ketchup taste in the final product and the taste of beef which isn't strong in a London Broil anyway was completely covered by the ketchup/molasses combination. I wouldn't recommend this for use on any but the absolute (!!!!!!!!) least expensive cuts of beef.

This does not qualify as a marinade in my book. It is more like a ketchup sauce that overpowers the meat and leaves the eater with an awful lot of a mdiocre taste. Would not use again for any cut of meat. There are too many "good" marinades out there that do more to tenderize meat and make it more interesting.

Tried this last night. My family gave me mixed reviews on it. Some said too sweet and myself and another member said it's fine. I guess it depends on what you like. Very easy to make!

This is now our Family favourite for a marinade! After pulling out the roast I add left over juices to the slices for extra flavour.
