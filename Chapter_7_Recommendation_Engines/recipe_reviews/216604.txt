Im giving this a 5 star but only because I took others advice before making and made these changes.  I used 1/2 sweet Italian sausage, 1/2 ground beef.  I added 1/2 onion and 1 tbl spoon garlic to the meat.  I also used pasta sauce with green pepper.  I added some oregano about 1/2 tsp to the cheese mixture.  This came out awesome and great flavor.  Take advice and add some more flavor of your choice

This was a decent starter recipe, but definitely needs some changes.  I agree that you should mix in some italian sausage because the beef just gets waaay too dry otherwise.  Conversely, you could brown the beef but not too much, just enough to make it manageable, and then let it finish cooking in the slow cooker (but adding fully cooked beef and cooking four hours is not a good idea!)  I used a half cup of water to avoid it getting soggy but to allow for moisture enough to cook the noodles.  Also increased the amount of sauce to allow for more moisture, esp since i reduced the water amount.  Used more cheese too cuz i like it cheesy.  Honestly the appeal of this recipe is the joy of having lasagne without having to stick it in the over and wait an hour or more to eat it after a full days' work, however prep-wise it's just as easy to make a real lasagne, and you can get those ready to use noodles so you don't have to cook them in advance.  I recommend this recipe for working families who want a lasagne but don't want to have to wait til after you've popped on in the oven.  Also you'll want to pam your slow cooker to avoid sticking, and do NOT do anything higher than low or it'll burn baby burn.  Oh yeah, and of course you need more spices.  I used basil, oregano, and garlic.

This lasagna turned out surprisingly well in the slow cooker. I only gave it four stars because I feel that, while it is a good base lasagna, it needs a little bit more pizazz. Next time I make it I might do one or more of the following: Substitute bulk italian sausage for the ground beef, add garlic and/or italian seasoning & fennel to the meat as it's cooking, add a vegetable such as spinach or zucchini to one of the layers, don't go cheap on the pasta sauce, and add more cheese on top. I cooked this lasagna for a little over 4 hours and it was starting to get a little bit charred on the bottom. 6 hours definitely would have been disastrous, though I suppose it depends on your slow cooker. Lastly, I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta and no one noticed a difference and I used dried parsley since that was what I had on hand. I will definitely be making this recipe again; it was delicious to come home to the smell of lasagna!

Wasn't sure how this would turn out but it was fantastic! Used low fat cottage cheese instead of ricotta and couldn't tell the difference. Added 2 links of italian sausage , squeezed out of the casing and broken up in the pan and 1 T minced garlic. Actually used about 8 noodles and used the full cup of water, cooked on low for 3.5 hours, topped with remaining cheese and cooked another 30 minutes. It was perfect.

Great meal to have ready for you at home after working all day.  Made it with garlic bread and salad.  I used ground turkey because we don't eat red meat in our house - turned out great!  Will make this again!

This is a tasty lasagne.  However, I've made it twice in the slow cooker and both times it came out soggy.  The noodles that is.  I'll continue to cook this, however, I won't cook it all day long.  Even 2 hrs on low was too long.  I will also skip the water.  I found it added to the sogginess.  Good though, so that's why I'm still eating it and gave it a good rating :D

This tasted to me like something out of a can.  And, I doctored it up with Italian sausage and green pepper.  I think that the lasagne noodles were just way too soft for my taste and it was just bland in general.  I don't think you can really make lasagne in a slow-cooker...

If you have a low, wide cooker it works even better than with a taller cooker. But regardless of the crockpot used, the smell will drive you wild with anticipation.

This was such an easy recipe.  It turned out great for being a basic recipe.  I will definitely be using this from now on.  I can't wait to try new things to jazz it up a bit.  I suggest added some of your own herbs and spices to the sauce and/or meat.  Maybe a little meat tenderizer while browning the meat.  I think next time I will use an italian sausage and beef mixture to add a little more flavor.  Great starter recipe, thank you for sharing :)

Added red, green, yellow, orange peppers, & red onions to meat mix of chicken Italian sausage, turkey meat, and ground beef which totaled 1lb and seasoned to my liking. Omit water, and sprayed stone cookware with canola oil. The use of peppers & onions in meat provided enough juices to cook noodles. Reduced cooking time to 3 hrs on low setting. This is the amount of time it took for juices to absorb. Lasagne turned out great and was delicious. :)

I used half Italian sausage and half ground beef.
chopped onion, green bell pepper and sliced mushrooms.  Used dried parsley...and oregano.  Made these changes from reading reviews.  Noodles were not cooked previously and it came out very tasty.  Will use again now that summer heat is coming.

My first time making slow cooker lasagna and so glad I used this quick, easy and delicious recipe. I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted as good or better than oven baked. My husband and 3 y.o. liked it, too. We were able to get three layers in our crock. I mixed everything the night before and it was fast to put together the next day. I set the slow cooker on 2.5 for a little over 4 hrs. and it was perfect! Great recipe!

This recipe was very easy to make. While cooking the hamburger I added some Italian Seasoning. Instead of adding parsley to the cheeses I added Italian seasoning. It only took 3 hours to get done set on low in my slow cooker. The sides started to get very dry. I think 4+ hours of cooking time is way too long!

Definitely easy, but needs WAY more seasoning. I added a little already from reading the past reviews, but after tasting the finished product, I will definitely add more next time I make it.

Just the thought of Lasagna in a slow cooker sounded criminal to me.  I love Lasagna and thought I would have to give it a try.  I doubled all the ingredients, used a mixture of Parmesan, Mozarella and pepper jack cheese.  I added onion and garlic also to the beef when cooking.  and 1 cup of half and half to the cheese mixture as it looked way to thick.  The Lasagna cooked well in the slow cooker and actually looked appealing even though it didn't have the usual golden melted cheese crust!  I actually did not actually like the texture it just seemed to dry.  I am not sure I will be making this again, if so I will do some research to see what else I can do to make it taste more like my usual oven lasagna.  Glad I experimented!

I love my slow cooker and am looking for more ideas.  Love this idea but miss having the melted/burned cheese on top that you can achieve in the oven.  Also, I seasoned the ground beef heavily (Italian seasoning, crushed fennel seed, salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, oregano).  The cheese mixture was good but needed more seasoning (maybe salt, pepper, dried basil and oregano).  The big mistake I made was using cheap sauce.  I always make homemade sauces so I don't know much about jars of sauce and what to buy.  I figured I would go with the well known brand that starts with an R....since I knew there wouldn't be tomato chunks that my young kids would not like.  That sauce is too bland for me.  Next time, I'll hopefully find something better or just use my own, frozen, homemade sauce.  I think it could use more noodles (maybe add another layer in there??).  I think the addition of Italian sausage would be a good one!  I just wasn't willing to spend the money on a dish I wasn't sure we'd like.  I will definitely make this again, because I just LOVE having dinner complete at the end of a day but I will modify it next time.  Lastly, I cooked it on low for 2 hrs and on high for 2.  Not anywhere near burned.  It could even go a couple of more hours.

I am not a cook by any stretch of an imgaination. Just a single dad trying to fill up his 14 year old son. This recipe did it perfectly! No cooking noodles. No fuss. No mess. But, a delicious end result!!!! I would recommend using something rather than an "original" pasta sauce. I did and felt the recipe could have used an extra "punch" that other sauces could provide. This is delicious, perfect and most of all easy to make!!!!

I did this in my 7 qt slow cooker using the recipe exactly. After 2 hours (thankfully, I was home) I smelled the burning smell of the sauce. When these recipes are written the size of the slow cooker is relevant. It appears the large size of my slow cooker made the two layers too thin to cook in the time instructed. I removed the inside liner immediately and am waiting to see if this is a big waste of time and money. Further instruction designating cooker size would have been helpful, afterall, this site is not for professionals but amatures and beginners. Not happy.

Tastes good but when finished it was just a pot of mush. I cooked some additional pasta and mixed with it so I wouldn't waste it.

This is a good base recipe, but after reading the ingredients list, I decided to doctor it up a bit.  I sauteed some chopped onion and minced garlic with the ground beef and added Italian seasoning.  I also used a bit more ricotta and added a pinch of ground nutmeg.  I got side-tracked while the lasagna hit the 4 hour mark, and actually let it cook for 6 hours.  The result was tasty but a bit mushy, the lasagna noodles left with not much texture at all.  So, I would definitely recommend cooking it for only the 4 hours.

Very good.  I made it in my 6 quart Hamilton Beach Set-N-Forget, and there was a lot of empty space in the pot.  Next time I might try doubling the recipe and repeating the layering, so it's twice as deep.

I cooked for 4 hours on low, and it was getting pretty crispy around the edges.  I'm thinking 3 hours may have even been the right amount of time, or perhaps cooking on Warm (this cooker has three settings . . . Warm, Low, and High).

I made this recipe as written and it was very good. I considered using Italian sausage instead of beef (since that's how you make REAL lasagna, IMO), but the Italian sausage was too expensive so I used beef. The lasagna still turned out very  tasty and would, I think, be even better with bulk Italian sausage. The pasta sauce I had on hand had green peppers and onions so that worked well. This recipe was also a good way to use up the few leftover lasagna noodles I always have after making regular lasagna. The only problem I had with the recipe is that it's not a good slow cooker recipe for someone who works full time, which is kind of the point of slow cookers. I had to make it on the weekend because I can't run home to set up and plug in the slow cooker at lunch. I cooked this on low for 5 hours, but much longer would have meant burnt lasagna. For many slow cooker recipes, you can let them go for 8-10 hours at a time which = plug in, leave for work, come home, eat. Can't do that with this one so, in the end, prepping a regular lasagna (about the same amount of prep as this recipe) over the weekend, freezing it, thawing later in the fridge while you're at work, and popping in the oven when you get home is less time intensive. No need to sit around the house for 4-6 hours on a weekend while it cooks. But if you can run home and turn on your slow cooker halfway thru the day, this is a great recipe. And it is a great way to use up those extra lasagna noodles. Makes a lot too!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous! We love Lasagna at my house, but the traditional way of cooking it takes SO long! Discovering this recipe was wonderful, its amazing that it never occurred to me to do this and to leave the noodles uncooked.

It tasted great.  I substitued the ground beef with sausage.  I did not have ricotta cheese, so I used cottage cheese.  I do not suggest cooking it longer than 4 1/2 hours, because my noodles were overcooked.

I substituted spicy Italian sausage for the beef and there was no blandness here.  Was ready at around 3 hours.  Very good and I will make this again.

Review from my husband: a lasagne lover, "I would give it 3.5 stars.  Surprisingly good lasagne for coming from a crock pot. I just like my cheese more crispy-brown."  I did add the extras that others suggested - easy to make, nice to come home to something other than a pot roast in the crock pot.

This is the best lasagne I have ever tasted!  My family loved it!  Even my picky 3yr old.  I read some of the reviews and took thier advice.  I didnt add the water and mine was done in 3hrs.  I added pepperoni and I used a little more sauce.  I will make this again!  Next time I will add some chopped black olives and chopped mushrooms.  The pepperoni makes it a little greasy, but it makes it pop!

I used sausage instead of beef and mixed cottage cheese w/ the ricotta to make it easier to spread.  3 hrs plus warming time in the slow cooker was enough.  With the jar of sauce, the water wasn't necessary. Easy enough to make it again. The more you add, such as onions or peppers to the meat, the tastier it will be.

This recipe was very simple to follow. It came out surprisingly well. Everyone, including the kids, loved it. I checked on the lasagna after only 3 hours and 15 minutes (on low) and found the noodles were already tender and the sides were starting to crisp. Next time I will add my variations such as spinach to the cheese mixture and 1/2 beef and 1/2 mild Italian sausage.

We've made this dish numerous times, sometimes I will change up the cheese and/or meat just for something new. Our favorite pairing is following this but using pepper jack cheese and chorizo sausage in place of ground beef and Italiano cheese.

This was so easy and delicious!! I followed other's suggestions and added a bit of seasoning (whatever I had on hand that mixed well) and used half ricotta and half cottage cheese. I am not a huge fan of lasagna so I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this as much as I did! I will use this recipe again!!

I think this recipe is great for those of us on the go with a family.  I subtitued Morning Star ground soy meat for the ground beef becuase my daughter is vegitarian.  I also used low fat cottage cheese instead of the ricotta and added mushrooms.  It was hit with all of us in the family even us meat lovers!

Lasagne in a crockpot??  Oh yea! I did make a few changes.  I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta.  I combine in a bowl the cottage cheese, fresh Parmesan cheese and mozzarella and 1 egg and use for my layers.  I also add 2 large links of Italian sausage to the hamburger meat along with a chopped onion as I'm frying up that part of the recipe.  Drain the grease and add my sauce, that's another layer.  Layer in the crockpot all ingredients and end up with the sauce mixture.  The smell as its cooking thru my house was wonderful.  Everyone enjoyed it and couldn't believe it came from the crockpot!

It's a good idea and looks great but trust me add more seasonings....maybe cook onion and garlic with the meat and add some salt and Italian seasonings.  It needs more flavor.

This was easy, but not great. I added a little nutmeg to the cheese mixture, and also added garlic onion, bell pepper and zucchini to the meat and it still seemed kinda bland. I think if I ever do it again I will do Italian sausage instead of ground beef, and add some mozzarella.
