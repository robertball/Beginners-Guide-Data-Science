This recipe is so unbelievable good!  My husband and I were in heaven!  The recipe didn't specify what kind of bread to use, so we got a fresh baked italian loaf sliced and used that. This sandwich is great just the way it is.  Next time we might add some fresh spinach to the sandwich, but it certainly doesn't need it.

First there is the 5 star crispy-cheesy grilled romano on the bread. Then there is the creamy-tomatoey stuff inside. THEN there are the hundreds of variations you can do with this recipe. We did some with fresh herbs, some with pesto, one with colby-jack & blue cheese. The one in the picture is as written on sourdough. Yum. Thanks for the recipe(s)!!!

Very good, but it could have been more flavorful.  I do love a good gourmet grilled cheese sandwich!

excellent! i did it a little different for taste. i used fresh shredded mozz cheese, skipped the egg step and  fried in @2 tbls butter, added fresh basil, chopped and dry italian seasonings as well as fresh ground sea salt and black pepper. this sandwich screams for some bacon or ham. great with veggie soup on a cool evening. a true gourmet cheese sandwich! update... i ADDED mozz cheese to this and now some pepperjack cheese. excellent!

I made a few using the egg dip method, but didn't like how it really didn't crisp up enough. So I used butter instead then dipped in the cheese. So much better.  So many ways to make this your own creation. The kids like fontina better than goat.

If I were to make this again I would use less goat cheese.  It was very rich, but it tasted pretty good with tomato soup.

This definitely takes regular 'ol grilled cheese to the "gourmet" level.  I used a combination of Romano and Asiago cheeses and Italian bread.  The goat cheese and tomato combination was delicious and paired perfectly with the cripsy, cheesy outer "coating". Perfect with homemade tomato soup or a garden salad!

Simple and delicious! I used shaved Parmesan on the outside and sprinkled the tomato with dried basil. I may not make an old fashioned grilled cheese ever again, these are too good.

This was really good with tomato soup. The egg and cheese on the outside wasn't as exciting as I expected. I added pesto inside and cooked it on the foreman grill.

I loved this! I added a little pesto and used egg substitute and some good freshly grated parmesan.  To a goat cheese fan like me, this was just heavenly! Thank you!

Awesome - Even my picky kids gobbled these down.  I did have to add some good salami for the hubby, but he has to have meat!  The only thing I would do different next time is use some good quality bread from the bakery!  I did add a dash of garlic to the adult sandwiches.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I love goat cheese, but when it comes to grilled cheese, I prefer how the traditional cheeses melt.  This was nice for something different, however will not make again.

This sandwich was so good! I added some basil and that gave an extra kick of flavor. You may want to add some seasoning. But even without it it is amazing!
