Ok recipe.  Followed the directions exactly except I added peas, in order to have more vegetables. If I make it again, I will put it in a long dish versus the round one that was suggested.

Good recipe, easy to follow.  Has good flavor, I made it exactly how the recipe is listed.  Next time I make it, I made add some garlic and pimentos....seemed like it was missing something but it was still good.

It was a pretty good meal. I added onion and garlic before I realized it wasn't in the recipe, but I think it added extra flavor. It was a little bitter but I think that my mushrooms were the culprit because it was good until I added them. I added salt and pepper to my family's taste and some Italian seasonings in hope to cut some of the bitternes. I will definately make this again, just have to check the mushrooms a little better.
