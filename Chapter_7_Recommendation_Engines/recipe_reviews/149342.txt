This is really nice. Tried this with these spectacular red-purple crabapples that I had and I substituted about a third of the apple for pear. Made a great "hedgerow" type of thing superb flavor and texture and the red crabapples turned it an amazing shade of pink! Next time I will try spicing it which will probably put this one over the top. Nice to see someone using their crabapples!
