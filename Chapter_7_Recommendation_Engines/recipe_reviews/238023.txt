Goulash (or often called chili macs in my house) is something that I typically throw together without a recipe, since I've made it so many times.  The addition of the bay leaves, worcestershire sauce, and sofrito (I made my own and always have this in the freezer) were several ingredients that I typically don't include, but I liked the new layers of flavor that they bring.  I followed the recipe with the exception of scaling back the seasoned salt.  One thing in particular I like about this recipe is that you cook your macaroni in the goulash mixture, so you're saving yourself one more pan to wash.  Just watch your time on this step, as the macaroni will absorb the liquid pretty quickly, and you may need to add a little more water (I did).  The one seasoning I missed was chili powder, but that's my own personal taste that I know many don't include in goulash.   This is just good old-fashioned comfort food.  Thanks Dawn Bohler.

This was really good. And YES, easy! I couldn't find sofrito sauce, so it was left out. What I did do was use Italian seasoned diced tomatoes, and in lieu of 2 lbs hamburger I used just 1 pound, and subbed 1 pound ground Sweet Italian sausage. Really kicked it up a notch!  Made a batch last night, and taking a batch to a friend tonight who had a family medical emergency. :)

This recipe calls for 3 cups of water, however the directions don't  say when or how to use the water.   Next time I will cook the macaroni before adding it to the meat mix.  This recipe says to add macaroni to the meat mixture until tender.  It sucks up all of the liquid and doesn't cook correctly when adding it uncooked.  That part was very confusing.

I didn't have sofrito, so I chopped up some green pepper and added some pepper, cumin, salt, avocado oil and a dash of chile pepper. Used gluten free pasta. Husband said it's the best goulash he's ever had!

Super easy and it was a hit with my family. The only change I made was using diced tomatoes with onion and garlic rather than chopping garlic and onions.

My prep time was longer than advertised, but the end result was well worth it. I made a half recipe and it was plenty for 2 adults 2 kids. I couldn't find the sofrito, so added some chopped green peppers instead and it was still a great dish.

Although the flavor was terrific, as an Italian cook, I canâ€™t abide soft pasta.  My only change in the future would be to cook pasta separately and add right before serving.

Made this but only used half of the recipe. It was easy and fast. You can not mess this up. I did however add a tablespoon of sugar. It was just a preference of mine. This recipe is very old school and definitely a keeper. Family was happy and I saved leftover for lunch tomorrow.

Doubled everything and fed a crowd. They all raved! I made my own Italian seasoning  (using Italian seasoning II from this site). Had no problem finding the sofrito  sauce in the Mexican aisle of my local store.

Cook with green peppers instead of that soufla or whatever it is. If you look it up it's just spices cooked with olive oil. This is great comfort food and great leftovers, like one person said you want to watch the water after you put the noodles in really, you should put more water in than stated in the beginning and maybe more tomato sauce. However very good and easy to make.

Great recipe.  Perfect proportions. Due to personal preferences, I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced and added bell peppers. Entire pot disappeared. Whole family loved it.

I halved the recipe for just the 2 of us. Next time I make it I will make the entire recipe.
I did not precook the macaroni. I just added it to the meat & veggie  mixture. Letting it simmer for about 20-25 minutes. The macaroni was tender & the goulash had thickened just right.
I did add about 1/4 cup each of chopped red bell pepper and celery to the onion & garlic before adding to the ground beef. 
The goulash a salad & garlic bread made a great meal.
I will definitely make this again.
Thank you for sharing your recipe.

Easy to make and great flavor! I cut recipe in half, this still served 3 people and I put 3 servings in freezer for quick meals! Will definitely make this again, it's very good, even after frozen! Especially good with little dollops of Ricotta on the top!

This was amazing. The sofrito really added to the recipe and I probably used a little more than listed. The picky mom and hub both liked it. Will definitely go in the regular rotation.

The family ate it up.....as other commenters have mentioned this recipe  makes a ton of food, will half the recipe next time. Also  the  macaroni does soak up most of the liquid, I'll cook it  in a separate pot next time. As for the sofrito sauce, I used a simple recipe from spruce eats, easy and tasty.

The only thing I did different was I par boiled my pasta and added I cup less water. I also think a green pepper would have added a nice touch.
But all and all this was a very nice dish and quick to prepare.
I served it with a French bread on the side. Great for dipping or just on the side.

I made it exactly as the recipe described.  It was fantastic.  My 2-year-old son ate it all!  I need to have a low carb meal, so I simply kept some of the mixture aside before adding the noodles, and that was a healthy and tasty option for me.

I omitted the sofrito sauce when I made this it turned out well nonetheless and I had no complaints. The Worcestershire sauce added a good flavor and complimented the dish well.

I will make this again. Because of my sensitivity, I used gluten-free elbow macaroni. It held up well for the first meal, but the pasta lost its shape into bits and pieces in the leftover containers. I used 99% fat free ground turkey breast for the meat, saving some calories. For tomato puree I used plain tomato sauce. I added a diced green bell pepper to the vegetables to saute. The canned tomatoes I used had garlic, basil and oregano in them. I added more salt and pepper for my taste.

Always a hit ! Make sure you add sofrito bay leaves worchestire sauce. Otherwise if you do not use onions and garlic use tomatoes w/ them .. definitely simmer for a while and then add macaroni. Have made a few times no complaints .

I did exactly what the recipe said, except for the Sofrito.  Didn't have any.  This is so good!  Even my extremely picky 13 year-old loved it!

1. If you try this recipe let me know where you found the Sofrito sauce because Ethan and I scoured the aisles of Walmart and couldn't find it

2. I underestimated how much food this recipe would make so if you try this recipe make sure you have a GIANT pot/skillet to use because currently my skillet is millimeters from overflowing 

3. Bon Appetite!

Love this but had to make some substitutions based on what I had. 1 14 oz can each of fire roasted diced tomatoes and tomato sauce and 2 cups of v8 juice. 1/2 cup each of green and red bell pepper, didn't have sofrito.

Great recipe and easily adaptable to what you have on hand. I used steak sauce instead of worcestershire sauce and glutenfree pasta. I also didn't have sofrito sauce but diced up some peppers and zucchini and extra spices. Really anything goes in this recipe.

I used Rotel diced tomatoes and green chilis for a little spice. Came out delicious.

Tastes great, I always add kidney beans when I add the noodles though. It's delicious.

A family favorite without any tweaking!  Super easy too! And now the grocery store that carried the sofrito is no longer in business and I can't find it anywhere. ??  I'm going to try substituting manwhich for it since it has mostly the same ingredients.... I'll update after.

Easy prep and tasty. I think we're going to try it with some chips for a different twist.

I couldn't find sofrito sauce at two grocery stores, so I used tomato paste and water. It came out rather sweet, so maybe next time I'll add a little taco seasoning to give it the Latin taste of sofrito sauce. I added green peppers and used ground turkey instead of beef. This was really good! Looking forward to making it more often.
