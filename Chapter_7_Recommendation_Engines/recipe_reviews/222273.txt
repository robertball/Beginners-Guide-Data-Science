I did not have vanilla yogurt on hand, I used a half cup nonfat greek yogurt and added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. I also did not add the food coloring. One of the best smoothies I've had in a long time.

I was pleasantly surprised.  My husband really likes rhubarb and so I keep trying things with it.  Made just like the recipe except the red food coloring and added a few frozen strawberries.  Thanks for this recipe, it is a great different way to use all the rhubarb that my husband is growing.

This was really good. I didn't have cranberry juice so I used orange juice instead. I also didn't have any food coloring, so it turned out a light peach color instead of red. Thanks Sarah-May!

5 stars because even my picky middle child devoured this without noticing the banana!!!
I only made a couple of changes usisng what i had on hand, 
a fzn banana and OJ instead of apple juice.
We love smoothies and this is most definately a keeper for us!
I made 2 batches and used my freezable smoothie cups to freeze leftovers :)

Thanks for the recipe. I had never tried rhubarb before but bought some frozen and this recipe was a great first into. The only reason i didnâ€™t do 5 stars was cuz a cup of juice made it a lil too runny for me. Otherwise awesome.

Made it using 1 banana, 1 cup fresh rhubarb, 1 cup almond milk 2 tablespoons ground flax and one cup Apple cranberry juice.  It was great!  Going out to the garden today and freezing the rest of the rhubarb!!!!  Did not use vanilla or food colouring though.

Had this for lunch today with my littlest munchkin, she loved it! I did increase yogurt to 1 cup, and used a greek yogurt, also used cherry juice.
