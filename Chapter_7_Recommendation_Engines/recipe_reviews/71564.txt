I love turkey legs, but this recipe is too low on cooking times. Following it my turkey legs did not brown, and the meat thermometer barely reached 160 degrees. I suggest leaving the turkey legs in the pressure cooker for at least 15 minutes instead of 5 minutes. Then broil them for at least 45 minutes instead of 15 minutes. They just never cooked fully using the recipe times.

I can't give an actual rating for this recipe since I didn't follow the instructions, but the site won't let me submit a review without a rating, hence the three stars.  I made the colossal mistake of following the previous reviewers suggestions and pressure cooked the legs for 15 minutes instead of 5.  My legs were stewed to the point of falling off the bone, and the skin was waterlogged and flabby, and slipped off when I removed the turkey from the cooking water.  Had I further followed the instructions and broiled for 45 minutes, my legs would have turned into jerky.  I salvaged what I could, added the barbecue sauce, and broiled for 5 minutes to heat through.  I might try again but please heed my advice, and follow the recipe!

I think the comment about increasing the cooking times may have been from someone who didn't realize the legs are already pre-smoked, thus partially cooked already.  Maybe they were using raw legs?  In this recipe, I omitted the bouillon, since the legs are salty already.  yummy!
