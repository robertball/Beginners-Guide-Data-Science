I LOVE this recipe! It's very easy to make. It's costly at $14 a batch. I made a double batch since I'm taking them to a cookie exchange today. My husband loves them.  I'm not a big chocolate fan but these are super yummy. The nuts and cherries along with the choc chunks make it a flavor packed cookie. This is a keeper and I'll be making them again!!
