I used a homemade vanilla frozen yogurt instead of vanilla ice cream. My kids thought this was the best drink ever.

I've never had butter beer, so I don't know what it's 'supposed' to taste like, but we thought this was great! I would suggest using cold seltzer water, so the drink is icy cold. I didn't measure anything, so I am sure I used more than 2 tbsps. butterscotch topping, lol. Reminded me of a rootbeer float, except, of course, it was butterscotch...loved it! Thanks for sharing. :)

Perfect! Love how you can adjust the sweetness to your taste by adding more or less soda. My kids LOVED it!!
