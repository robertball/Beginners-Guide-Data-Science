I added a little bit of sugar to mine and it was awesome!!!  I made it for a bunch of people at a barbecue and they all LOVED it especially the kids, they said it tasted better than the ones from restaurants.

The recipe was scaled for four (it was just me drinking it, but i swear i have friends!) and it didnt quite fit well in my blender. It tasted very well though and definitely adds spice to any meal or occasion. I cut a slice in one of the strawberries and placed it on the slide of the glass. It was quite the decoration!

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  My family thought that the strawberries tasted a little too watery. The store was out of sweetned frozen strawberries.  I used unsweetened strawberries.  Next time I might add a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

I used sprite with it. I'll probably try the real thing next time!:-) But for a cool, refreshing drink, it turned out pretty good.

I only had a frozen, sugar-added 16oz strawberry package, so I should have added more ice/water to compensate for how sweet it came out...otherwise, a great, simple recipe.

this didn't work out well for me... found it kinda bland, and it was more of a thick slush then a liquid drink. Guess its all in your blender and what you use in it.

This was really yummy and so easy to make!   I didn't use any ice because using the frozen strawberries made it the perfect consistency.  I used light sweetened frozen strawberries and diet lemon lime soda.  My husband added a scoop of low fat vanilla ice cream to his and blended and it was also very good!

I used unsweetened frozen strawberries, added a touch of sugar and left out the ice altogether. I can't compare to a "real" daiquiri, but it was so easy and delicious! Strawberry flavor was perfect. No need for the extra ice!

Love this drink, it's like a strawberry icee but healthier since you are using real strawberries. My kids like this with ginger ale while I like it with lemonade. I usually scale this down to one serving and add a whole fresh squeezed lime. Various berries can also be added with the same great result.

I went over my best friend's house just to return his clothes because he had to stay at my house because his parents went on a cruise. He gave me this cause he probably thought i was thirsty. OMG!!! this is a really yummy drink. then i asked him for the recipe since he used it for his culinary project and showed me this recipe. i had some left and i gave it to my mom when i came home and she loved it too. 
If u are throwing a party with people under 21, or hosting a barbecue make this drink. It is a fantastic drink for the summer because of it looks like a slurpee from 711.
