This made four large servings without adding rice. Couldn't find fresh cayenne pepper so used serrano. I think next time, I'd go with extra firm tofu (at least of the brand I used), as it fell apart. Husband would have preferred rice or a noodle with this. Even with giving the squash a good rinse, it was a little salty for our tastes, so next time I'll probably use a different veggie and save the salt cured squash for another dish (nice trick though). All in all, a very good week night meal that ticks the buttons for easy, healthy, and not too expensive.

Really quick, easy and delicious! Thanks Chef John!

I accidentally forgot the peppers, but it still had a nice kick to it (and I added a bit of cayenne powder too).  Also, make sure to give the zucchini a REALLY good rinse. I just gave it a quick rinse and it was definitely a tad salty

Good but soooo salty. I doubled the sauce because I wanted to have it over rice but it was too much. Maybe next time I will do just 50% more. Also I liked the texture of the zucchini from the salting technique but it was much too salty even after a thorough rinsing. I think it will be much improved next time without all the salt.

Very good!  Actually better after the tofu has sat overnight to absorb all the flavors.
