This sounded easy, fast, and tasty.  I tried it with penne, since the store was out of rotini.  The earlier review said to add more sauce, I added a half cup more, could have done a bit more, but I have to remember, this is a casserole.  I doubled the reciped, and added 2 tablespoons of italian seasoning.  My friends loved it so much, that they begged for the recipe.  I'll do it again, but next time I want to add cheese on top for that nice crispy topping.  Ooh, I started out with the Wasabi Secret Salad, which was a HUGE hit with this dish!

This was good!  I used 16 oz of meat from a chicken breast that I cooked beforehand.  Also, I added 2 tps of Italian spices, 2.5 cups of sauce, and 1 cup bread crumbs on top.

I did use spaghetti noodles instead of rotini.  This dish tasted like it was missing something.  If I was going to make it again I would use more sauce (2 1/2 cups) and less chicken (9ozs.)  The bread crums did get crunchy like parm. breading does.

Wow amazing!!!! I did change a lot but this is a great base. I used normal noodles, real chicken breaded in bread crumbs and parm, cooked in a skillet, and added some parm to the bread crumb topping and WOW! thats some awesome flavor! Add a little more sauce about a half a cup and PERFECT!

Loved this recipe very easy.  I made with 2 chicken breasts cut up and cooked in a bit of olive oil and seasoning.  FAmily all loved it.  Used a bit of extra sauce as suggested in the comments.

This was ok.  It seemed very dry and sort of bland.  I think more sauce/less noodles and some salt and pepper would help.  With some modification I would make again.

This was good, especially for a large crowd. I followed the suggestions of the previous raters and doubled the sauce and that made worked great! I also added some spices (basil, oregano) and sliced fresh mozzarella on top with the bread crumbs. Everyone liked it.

This was a tasty casserole, although I made many modifications.  Based on other reviews, I included a whole jar of Newman's marinara sauce.  I also added 2/3 cup of diced raw red peppers (the crunch was really tasty in this dish), 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning, 1/2 cup of pureed carrots, 1 small can of V-8 vegetable juice (5.5 fluid ounces) and two tablespoons of wheat germ (to add extra vitamins and minerals) and I used 1 1/2 cups of steamed chicken rather than using canned chicken.  I also added extra mozzarella cheese on top and then topped it with the bread crumbs.  This was a big hit with my preschooler son!

This was OK.  My kids loved it, but it's kind of bland.  It's a great quick and easy meal.  I agree with others that some seasonings or something should be added.  I followed the advice of adding more sauce.  Two cups is definitely not enough!  I'll probably make it again, but I'll definitely add some basil, oregano or Italian seasoning.

I like this dish because it has few ingredients and it's so simple! I added  extra sauce, Italian seasoning and some parmesan cheese mixed with the bread crumbs. Next time I will add some salt and pepper.

Family loved it! I didnt read the recipe all the wa through and in ended up mixing the marinara with the chicken and noodles and putting the cheese on top with the breading over it... Still turned out great though. Next time I will make it the 'right' way :) Thanks!

This was okay, I felt it was a bit bland. It's a great use of leftovers though. Make sure you're using a quality marinara sauce though, it does make a huge difference

I made a bunch of improvements and it still tasted generic. I used real chicken breast and breaded it before baking. I added italian seasoning used parmesan cheese with the breadcrumbs.

Used 2 chicken breasts cut up.  Made the "Best Marinara Sauce Yet" from this site.  This needed spices and more sauce.  Won't be making this one again.

Turned out dry.   I should have listened to the other reviewers and added more sauce.  I also used a thicker marinara, so that didn't help.  Probably won't make this one again.  If I ever did make it again, I would mix the sauce into the chicken/noodle/cheese mixture before baking, and I would try to find a runnier marinara.  Could be a good base recipe, but I would not make it as is again.

I loved this dish because it is kid friendly.  I didn't give it a 5 only because it needed more seasoning. Layering flavors in casseroles is the key in my opinion.  I added garlic to the pasta water, used skinless chicken breast cooked over stove with a bit of water (so it didn't fry/grill), and seasoned with salt, pepper, onion powder, (smidge of garlic powder) & italian seasoning.  I also layered cheese inside the layers as well as on top.  I used the seasoned bread crumbs but next time I use my preferred panko bread crumbs.  Great dish!

Great easy dish! Made it the way the recipe stated the first time but changed some things the second time:  1) I used Perdue frozen breaded chicken strips (cooked first then cut up for casserole) instead of canned chicken to give it less of a tuna taste/texture 2) use ALOT more of the sauce and distribute throughout the casserole or it dries out

This recipe was good, but it didn't really give the taste of chicken parmesan. My family loved it, but it was more like chicken ziti. It is a great base recipe, though.

Quick, easy and tasty.  I used boiled chicken breasts cut into small pieces instead of canned chicken.  Plenty of food for our family of three with leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  I will use this recipe again!

Yummy! Very easy, too. Of course I made changes: stirred in a can of diced tomatoes with the noodles, also Italian seasoning, then poured marinara sauce on top. I also sprinkled shredded parmesan with the bread crumbs on top. For the chicken I cut up a couple breaded chicken patties. Tastes delish!

Pretty good- I did follow some advise and added garlic and basil to the sauce, also a can of Italian diced tomatoes.  I used shredded parmesan cheese along with the mozzarella, and added some over the bread crumbs for the last 5 minutes.

Simple and tasty! Like several other reviewers, I increased the marinara sauce to 2-1/2 cups and added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. For the topping, I used 1/4 cup of Panko Italian style bread crumbs mixed with 1/4 cup of grated parmesan cheese. I will definitely make this again.

I added twice the amount of cheese, because CHEESE! :)
Also added about 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and about 1 tsp of Italian seasoning.  Yummy! Would definitely make again.

This was so easy and so good.  Everyone loved it.  I did add 2 tsp of Italian seasoning and Italian Panko breadcrumbs.  It would have been too bland for me without it.   Also, used a garlic Marinara.

This was really easy to make!  I used a little left over chicken breast that I cooked earlier, in addition to the canned chicken (I only had a 10 oz can).  I added parm cheese and basilto the bread crumbs; it seemed odd the recipe called "Chicken PARMESAN Casserole" didn't have parmesan cheese in it. I used an entire can of spaghetti sauce and it seemed plenty.  Did the entire recipe for just my fiance and me; freezing 1/3 and putting the other 1/3 we didn't eat in the fridge for later in the week.  I will make this again for sure!

I changed one thing: instead of mixing the cheese in with the chicken and pasta, I mixed the marinara sauce in then topped with cheese and breadcrumbs, it made a big difference.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was a hit.  I used spaghetti noodles and Ragu spaghetti sauce that was already seasoned (2c).  I also added some Season All Crusting Blends to my plain breadcrumbs. Next time I might try mixing some melted butter in the breadcrumbs and baking it uncovered so they get a bit crispier.  I will save this to make again. Great  flavor and a lot easier than traditional chicken parmesan.

Super easy to make. I always have chicken breast on hand so I substituted fresh cooked chicken for the canned version.

We enjoyed this recipe, and made it as is except for we doubled the sauce as we saw many times mentioned in previous reviews.  It came out perfect.

I did exactly as the recipe said, personally I wanted more cheese & chicken!! I cook for 4, (one teen, is not a fan of red sauce but even she liked it!). My youngest and husband also asked for more chicken. For me it was so quick and easy for yummy the taste, an easy new go-to meal!

Instead of the canned chicken I cubed and cooked 4 chicken breasts with some oil, salt, pepper, garlic power, half an onion and some Italian seasoning right at the end.  Also eyeballed the cheese and bread crumbs.  Great recipe and my kids loved it

SO YUMMY!!! I added twice the cheese and a cup more sauce, I also added Parmesan. It was more like spaghetti casserole than chicken Parmesan casserole, so maybe I’d add more chicken next time, but my husband was obsessed!

This was pretty good! I added 1/2 cup more sauce and only 10 oz of chicken and 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. My kids didn’t care much for it, but they are extremely picky.

I doubled the recipe. Cooked a package of boneless chicken thighs in my instant pot while boiling the pasta, then shredded it and mixed in the cheese, sauce, and noodles. I added Italian seasoning and garlic salt and baked.  I liked the flavor, but would  increase the amount of spaghetti sauce - 1 1/2 times or 2 times the amount called for. But will definitely make it again!

Made this for the first time today. I did tweak the recipe a little did not use the can chicken it asked for. Instead I used pieces of chicken cutlets freshly cut into chucks. Seasoned to my liking and cooked till it was done. Added everything together and Omg it was delicious. Next time I will add more cheese since the hubby and boys love it cheesy. All and All I will make it again. Thank you for sharing your recipe with me and others.

I would make it as directed with added seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, basil).   I tried it with some of the suggestions and decided that I would scrap the whole recipe and start over.  I am going to mix everything together including some cheese and then top with more mozzarella.  I didn't like the bread crumb topping.  It was soggy and blah.

This is a great recipe for a quick easy dinner during the week.  I didn't use canned chicken, I used leftover chicken I had cooked in the crockpot over the weeeknd.  I used an Italian sausage sauce instead of marinara for more flavor.  It was fast, easy and delicious.  I did actually double the cheese, but that wasn't necessary, I just love cheese.  :)

I have made this for my family at least 4 times already. I precook chicken breasts cut in cubes and add it instead of canned chicken. I use either penne pasta or rotini. I also add garlic powder and I pour over after everything is in place.  I make garlic bread and that tastes good with it. I will be using a better sauce this time I make it. I love that I have get at least 3 or 4 meals out of this.

I totally cheated.  Well, maybe just a little bit.  I had some leftover Johnsonville Mild Ground Sausage that needed to be used, and this recipe came up because of the other ingredients I needed to use up.  Very good indeed!  I do think that this recipe can adapt to any leftover protein that you happen to have, so USE it!  Yum!  Thank you so much, morgens_aunt!

This recipe was really good...I didn't try it exactly though.  I did have to use quite a bit more spaghetti sauce.  If you want something fabulous...add bacon.  I cooked bacon in the microwave and then cut it up into pieces.  Everyone in our family was devouring this. :)  Bacon makes everything better.

I just think it needed some other type of liquid, Morgens_Aunt...that's why I added the rest of my spaghetti sauce to it, and then added water to the rest of the sauce in the jar and poured it on top of the pasta...I also used Italian seasoning, as I only have plain breadcrumbs.  Like someone else said, it seemed really dry.  I added the seasoning to the noodles, chicken and cheese before I put the sauce on it...then I put the rest of the mozzarelli cheese on top of the breadcrumbs.

This was pretty good. An easy dinner, wasn't as tasty as I thought it was gonna be. But, with a little tweaking would be very yummy!
