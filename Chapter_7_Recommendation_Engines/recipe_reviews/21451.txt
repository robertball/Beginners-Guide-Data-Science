My husband and I really like this dish with a few alterations.  I do not rinse the cabbage in boiling water, and I do not use brown sugar.  I use 1 cup of wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth to cook the cabbage, and I add about 1 T Worcestershire sauce, 2 T dijon mustard, and about 1/2 t garlic salt.  The first time I made it, I almost omitted the 30 minutes of cook time because polish sausage is pre-cooked, but cooking the sausage with the cabbage infuses a fantastic flavor!

This tasted REALLY GOOD, and my fiancee loved it too, even though he's not crazy about cabbage.  A word of warning - my cabbage burned while it simmered for 45 minutes, there wasn't enough oil or liquid to prevent it.  I would add some beef broth in addition to the wine next time...

We really enjoyed this! It is extremely easy but takes a while to cook so you have to start it early enough!

This recipe is GREAT !!!
The only advice I have is to make sure you give yourself plenty of time and not make it at the last minute.  Simmer it slowly and make sure that after you add the cornstarch and brown sugar mixture to watch it closely, as there is not much liquid and could burn easily.  I simmered it real low and watched it closely.  I used Alice White Merlot and it was excellent.  I think that by pouring the boiling water over it would soften it a bit and reduce the cooking time.  I skipped this step and it turned out excellent.  Also, the color is wonderful.  Definitely a keeper of a recipe.  Enjoy !!!

This was absolutely delicious and really cost effective...my favorite combination!  The only changes that I made are that I added about 1/2 cup of water after the cornstarch and brown sugar mixture because it just didn't look like there was enough liquid.  Also, I skipped the first step where you poured the boiling water over the cabbage since it just seemed like a pain and I didn't want to wash those extra dishes ;)  Since you have the cabbage covered for most of the cooking time it sort of steams itself and my cabbage was perfectly soft by the end.  I will be making this again!

I prepared this recipe exactly as stated except using cooking wine instead of drinking wine.  I thought that the texture was very odd due to the cornstarch.  It was creamy which was a strange mix with the cabbage. I'd give it 3 *'s but my daughter actually liked it alot.  I would prefer it- I think without the cornstarch but I don't know if it would be worth it.

Made this vegan with veggie sausage and margarine.  The cabbage was AWESOME!  It would be a perfect side dish without the meat too. Totally worth it to take the time cooking it.

This is an interesting recipe..  I will make it as written again, sometime, especially if red cabbage happens to be on sale.   It did, however, give me all kinds of ideas for revisions.  I plan to try it with green cabbage, skip the boiling water step (I'm really not sure what that is all about!), add onion, garlic, bell pepper, carrot and use cider vinegar instead of the brown sugar.  A whole new recipe!

Definitely a keeper recipe.  I substituted beef broth for the wine and it turned out great.  Even better the next day for leftovers.

After reading the reviews, I skipped the boiling water part, used a meyer lemon for juice, the 1/2 cup of merlot plus 1 cup of beef broth (made from bouillon and water), and added some Worcestershire sauce too. Did not add dijon as the pepper and garlicky spices from the turkey kielbasa were enough. I used the sugar but skipped the cornstarch and served with mashed potatoes. I even cooked it 15 minutes less than indicated and it was fine so if it's getting late and you are hungry, don't worry about the total cook time. Maybe I will try the cornstarch next time. Hubby really enjoyed this and he comes from an East European family, so that means something! Thanks.

Gave this four stars since I knew my Polish husband would not even taste the cabbage.  He loved the sausage (even though there was "cabbage sauce" all over the kielbasa).

Excellent flavor, consistency & basically ease of preparation.  Next time I make this I may add some thinly sliced onion (not too much) to the cabbage.  Maybe some carraway seed to the mixture (in memory of my Grandma's version).

Wonderful! I used Red Cream Concord wine which is very sweet so I did not need to add any sugar. I rinsed my cabbage w/ boiling water and simmered it on low and had no trouble with burning. It tastes so sweet and fruity. Definately a KEEPER!!

I make this recipe every 2 weeks or so. I do not rinse the cabbage in boiling water. I use 1 cup of wine, omit the cornstarch, and just slice the sausage instead of dice. Yes, its a long cooking time but worth it. I often save the left over sauce and add it to the water that I boil rice/grains with. Creates a beautiful color and unbelievable flavour.

Good combination of flavors. I suppose it may depend on how large a head of red cabbage is used, but there wasn't enough liquid to simmer for over an hour total. I added a little more wine and some water with beef boullion and that provided enough simmering liquid. Next time I'm going to add some sliced onion to this - seems like it would go well with the flavors.

great....didnt take nearly as long as the psoting said it would.  I think we were eating about an hour after starting.  We put french fried onions over the top.  Sounds weird but it actually added a great taste!

Delicious. I added a couple diced scallions and had it with side of hot mustard for dipping. I also found that cooking the cabbage for half an hour was plenty of time.

I like this recipe and have used Polish Sausage.  For a variation I have used Linguisa.  I cut the Linguisa up in small pieces (1" discs) and add 1/2 cup Balsamic Vinegar.

This was a very good dish. I skipped the first step like some of the reviewers suggested and it turned out fine. I didn't use the red cabbage I used the regular green kind and it was still good. Thank you.

This is hard to rate because I tweaked it quite a bit.    I used cider vinegar which worked really well and I put some of my fave spices in there including lemon pepper.   I also used smoked sausage  that I cooked with the cabbage.   I enhanced the sweetness with some canned Cranberry sauce.  Still not quite as distinctive as I would have liked but but I think I will make it again

Skipped the boiling water, not really necessary. I did add 1 cup chopped sweet onion and 1  tbsp chopped garlic. I also used 1/2 cup beef broth and the 1 cup wine (Pinot). I added 1 tbsp Worcestershire as another poster suggested and did felt it was to much so ended up adding 2 tbsp of brown sugar to tone it down. I substituted smoked beef sausage (what I had on hand). To me, it had to much liquid to simmer down (I like my cabbage a little crunchier). Next time I'll reduce lemon juice to 2tbsp ( it helps cabbage retain its colorful red appearance), and use 1/4 cup beef broth and 1/2 cup wine, also omit the Worcestershire. Great easy dish that can be easily personalized!
