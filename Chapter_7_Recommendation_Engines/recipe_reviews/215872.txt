I left out the egg, as the bread crumbs and spaghetti sauce were plenty of binding agent.  Soooo good!

Delicious! a half an hour for roasting my egg plant was a little too long. i would try twenty mins next and check. i had a hard time scooping out the eggplant because of this, ended up just being the skin in some areas, and sort of went flat. 
but great flavour! will make again!

I used turkey sausage, added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and Italian Seasoning. I also used Italian bread crumbs as well. Added a little bit more cheese then called for and made a side dish of whole wheat spaghetti. Tasty.

This was not an easy dish to prep and although tasty, it was way too difficult to make and I would not make it the same way again.  I would instead prepare the ingredients and bake in a greased casserole dish instead of the eggplant shell and maybe serve with a small side of spaghetti.

After roasting the eggplant halves at 400, there was no way the innards could be chopped. The whole thing was mush, and I wound up spooning it out in globs. It was a challenge keeping the blobs from disappearing completely when I mixed the stuffing. There's something wrong with the temperature, time, or eggplant.

My original plan, before I found this recipe, was to remove the insides of the eggplant while it was raw. I planned to use a melon baller to remove the flesh, dredge it in seasoned flour, and brown it lightly.

I might try that next time.
