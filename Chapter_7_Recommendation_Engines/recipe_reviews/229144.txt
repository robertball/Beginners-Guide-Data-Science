Bakes up crispier baking at 275 for 20 minutes and then at 425 for the remainder(maybe another 20 min). To get it actually really crispy outside fry though for about 4-5 minutes. Good with brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and sugar too.

Very good recipe. Baked in a glass baking tray and came out very good. Not greasy and very tasty. Will make this a keeper.

These were pretty good, but next time, I'll cut the potatoes thicker (personal preference) and probably add a little more fresh rosemary.

awesome flavor, however, they were a little mushy. I have attempted to make sweet potato fries several times, and have never got them to turn out right. They are either mushy or burnt. I will say that I did bake these in a 13x9 glass baking dish instead of a cookie sheet and got a better result than in the past. I followed the instructions to a T and had to bake them for about 45 minutes. Near the end of baking time, I increased the temp to 475 for a few minutes to crisp them up. I will use this recipe again until I get it right!

These were delicious but I changed the recipe a little. Although Olive Oil is good for you, it's best in very small amounts. I have a pumper spray filled with EVOO (not a pressurized can because it leaves a residue on your pans) I toss the cut fries with the spray and seasionings at  the same time and use a convection oven at 425 which made them very crisp and delicious. Heart Healthy!

Delish! I will definitely make this again. I cut thicker fries. Cooked for 20 minutes at 425 then lowered the temp to 375 for 10 minutes. They came out crunching on the outside and soft on the inside. I served it with a ranch dipping sauce. Kids and Hubby loved it.

My wife and I thought these were great. I did not have fresh rosemary so I used dried and chopped them up a bit in the coffee grinder. Also I used a yam because that was sitting on the counter and judging by the color I think that is what you get in resturants and store bought sweet potato fries anyways. Again very good, will make again!

Delicious! Mine did not get crispy either, and I left them in longer than called for, turning them 1/2 way through. It didn't matter, we still loved them. I also added some onion and garlic powders to them, and that was a great addition. These are a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is so delicious.  It's worth baking until the potatoes are translucent and crispy, even if they get a bit burnt around the edges.  We have used fresh rosemary and dried; it's great either way.  We slightly prefer the dried, but we dry out the herbs ourselves, so it was very fresh.

Best recipe for baked sweet potato fries for time and temperature.  They cooked beautifully.  I personally didn't care for the rosemary as I prefer just the salt but hubby devoured them.

Really easy to make! I did find that the fries came out a little too moist, the next time I cook them a little longer and flip them over.

SUPER EASY! Will make them again. I used dried rosemary instead, and also added a sprinkle of garlic powder (since I do that for all my fries). I'll try cutting them into bigger pieces next time, as a few others suggested.

I made the “Savory Sweet Potato Fries” as the recipe recommended. They were absolutely delicious. I used fresh Rosemary from my herb garden and the olive oil as called for. This will become one of my favorite recipes for sweet potatoes. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite.

We really liked these.  I found drizzling the oil over the sweet potatoes worked better than tossing them in a bowl.

I love sweet potatoes, so I wasn't surprised that I enjoyed this recipe. My husband isn't as much of a fan of sweet potatoes, but he really liked these! I followed the recipe exactly and -- as several other reviewers have noted -- they did end up being a little moist, but I didn't mind that.

I made these and they required more time but weren't crispy. Some got burnt because they weren't all a uniform size. I added garlic powder to half of them. Enjoyed the taste but I've got to work on the correct temperature for my oven. Thanks for posting.

I don't like the salty version as much. I prefer the sweeter side of of these potatoes.  I used your idea. I sliced the potatoes as fries. Then, buttered them with honey butter and sprinkled with cinnamon.  However, the butter kept setting my smoke alarm off.  Next time I will just roast eh potatoes with just a little salt. saving the honey butter and the cinnamon for a dip.  Yummy.

These were great. Deliciously sweet and salty, and very easy to make. I didn’t have an Rosemary so I just used whatever herbs I had in my cabinet. Although I didn’t flavor it the same the texture was still tender and the slightly burned outside made it crisper.

This was a very simple recipe which was the first thing that attracted me to it.  I am not a fan of rosemary so I substituted it for paprika.  I just sprinkled some on as I tossed everything together.  The fries were not crispy but very yummy.  I'll be making this recipe again very soon!

I have never been able to get crisp sweet potatoe fries in the past.  I used my mandolin and cut 3 sweet potatoes into 1/4" circles, followed the recipe as written except for the shape of the potatoes.   They came out nicely!  Not as crispy as if they were fried (which none of us need) but certainly closer to being in a fryer!

this was pretty good for an oven fry.. i used erin.wilcox's suggestion of 20@275 and then another 20@425.. next time i'll try 15@425 as the ends of my fries started to burn.. i put everything into a ziplock bag and tossed.. i ground up my dried rosemary in my mortar & pestle to get more even coverage.. also added a few grinds of a sea salt/chili flake/garlic blend.. this was very nice.. ty for the recipe ~~UPDATE: these really were good! bf was asking me what happened to the sweet potato we had picked up b/c he thought i had bought some pre-made pack for these fries.. bf said they were so good he couldn't believe they were homemade.. ty again for the recipe!

Flavor wise, they were good. I added more flavor to it than just rosemary but they came out too soft. I was hoping for a crispy fry texture. I even tried leaving it in longer for a bit but wasn't any useful.

I cut my fries thicker, more like steak fries, and they came out great. I used dried rosemary, and I liked one of the reviewers' tips of using a coffee grinder to grind it up a bit.....it worked great!  I baked them in the oven at 425deg for 20 min, gave them a stir (some were scorching on the bottom, so that was good to do), and then raised the temp to ~450 and baked another 5 min. I love sweet potatoes, and it's a bonus that they're so good for you! These were wonderful with a dipping sauce I made. Keeper recipe!

Sadly, even following other reviewers suggestions on cooking time and temp, the fries were mushy and not crispy.

20 minutes always does it perfect. Sometimes I leave out the rosemary and go different routes like cumin, garlic, onion powder, etc. Our favorite use of sweet potato is baked FRIES!!

Tossed mine in a little olive oil, added garlic powder and Tony's (my husband likes a little spice with his, and the contrast in flavors is nice), a little dried rosemary since I didn't have fresh, and baked in a glass cake pan (9x13) for about 45 minutes, turning midway. They weren't crispy, but that's to be expected with sweet potatoes. They also weren't mushy, and they were delicious. Will definitely make again.

Quick, easy and the kids love them. If you don't have any fresh rosemary you can use dried rosemary, add a little water and mix. I do this for all herbs if I'm out of fresh ones. While not ideal it'll do in a pinch.

I did not care for the rosemary with the sweet potato, though I used dry and used way too much.  I will try one more time.

I used 2 tsp dried rosemary, a little pepper along with some garlic and onion powder.  They tasted OK, but were mushy on some, undercooked crunchy on some, burned on others, and perfect on some.  I used a stoneware pan.  I would make again, but try to figure out exactly what made the perfect ones perfect! I cut them all about the same size
