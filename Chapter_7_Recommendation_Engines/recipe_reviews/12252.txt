I made this for Thanksgiving (nobody in my family likes Pumpkin pie) and it was a hit-- gone in a matter of minutes!  I added more coffee (3-4 teaspoons total) since I was serving the pie to a bunch of coffee lovers.  Also, instead of garnishing it with chocolate sprinkles, I used ground up chocolate chips and whole coffee beans.

This was a very good pie and considering how easy it was, I'll definitely make this again.

I love chocolate and mocha that's why when I saw this I was excited to try it. But when I scan the ingredients I got turned off when I saw this "instant mix thing". I hate instant mixes because we don't know what food additives, flavorings, flavor enhancers and preservatives they put in there. The reason  we bake our own is because we don't want those "mass produced" that they sell in a retail store or supermarkets. it's nice to make our own... from mixing to baking. it's safe and healthy. I don't try to influence you guys... anyway this is just my opinion. Anyway your recipe sounds ok.

Wonderful! Although I did double the coffee but only because we love chocolate and coffee flavors together. Made it the first time with the whipped topping mix, made it a second time using "cool whip." I liked the shortcut of the cool whip so will continue making it that way.

Try coffee in pudding only. Don't mix pudding with whipped cream. Add peppermint extract to whipped cream, and top with mint chips. Add green food coloring to whipped cream also.
