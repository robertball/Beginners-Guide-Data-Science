I used a pork loin with a bag of kraut, some onion, sliced apple and a little brown sugar--and some caraway.  Next time a little more apple and brown sugar!  Great with mashed poatoes and white gravy!  YUM!!

I tried this with a pork roast I bought on sale, and wow!! In my opinion, this is the BEST and EASIEST way to prepare a pork roast.  It was absolutely delicious.  I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.
The meat was tender, the juices were so tasty.  The sauerkraut didn't overwhelm the dish, in fact, most of my family were suprised there was kraut in it at all. They could see it, but it just didn't have that "in your face and up your nose" kick that they expected.  I had to guard the leftovers! ;)  This will be on my standard list of recipes.  Thank you for sharing it!

Easy and very good. It tasted delicious served with potato pancakes topped with sour cream and apples cooked in brown sugar and butter. I shredded the leftover pork the next day, heated it up with some barbeque sauce, and served it open-faced on top thickly sliced and toasted French bread. Yummy!

This was delicious and sooooo easy! I sprinkled about one tablespoon of brown sugar on top of the pork roast. I will make this again and again!

This is the exact recipe I use except we slice the roast (or a loin) and lay it flat in a casserole dish,pour kraut over it and cook for a LONG time. When it is done we put rolls on top and bake until they are done. (They do get soft on bottom, YUM.) My family LOVES this

This is a perfect lazy, freezing-cold Saturday night dinner.  I used 16 ozs of bagged sauerkraut and added 1/3 cup raisins and 1/3 cup sliced apples to it and stuffed it all into the middle of the roast.  The meat was moist, flavorful, and my toddler daughter scraped her plate.  Will definitely add to my favs.

This was delicious!  Smelled so good in the slow cooker, came out moist and tasty.  I did follow other reviewer's advice - added 1 apple, 1 onion (both cut up) and 1 tbsp. brown sugar.Will definitely make this again!

Excellent, and easy.  I added a few onions and left it in the crock pot longer than directed.  It was so tender.  Everyone raved.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was absolutely wonderful!  My whole family enjoyed it.  I served it with BarbiAnn's "Aunt Kate's Green Beans in Tomatoes" (from this site) and Apples sauteed in butter, orange juice and cinnamon.  Great Meal!

So so so easy and good! I added a cup of applesauce on top of everythign.  Also, I used a lot more sauerkraut than called for so as to have leftovers. The next day I put the kraut back in the crock with a few boneless pork chops & got another meal out of it. Stuffing the pork loin with the kraut makes it so moist! The second time I made it I used my new rectangular slow cooker. It cooked a little faster but was better due to all of it cooking in the same amount of liquid.  I also added for apples cut in wedges instead of applesauce and sprinkled 1/4 cup brown sugar over all. These were great tweaks! The second day, I reheated it in my mini crock and added 1/2 cup apple cider. My husband said it was better the second day! LOVE this recipe!

great, easy recipe - added extra sauerkraut (20 oz jar- undrained) in crockpot, as we love the stuff and were serving more people. Did not drain the can of sauerkraut to make sure of plenty of liquid -the pork came out delicious and not dry at all. Will make again.

I used a pork loin rather than a roast, chopped an onion and added it to the bottom of the crock pot prior to putting in the loin, and added 3/4 bottle of beer. This was absolutely delicious!! The meat was so tender and flavorful. Will definiely add this to the rotation!!

Wonderful recipe but definately needs some help.  I diced up a large onion and also shredded a med. carrot.  Added about 20 whole peppercorns, 1/4 tsp. of fennel seeds and a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar.  I placed these ingredients on the bottome of slow cooker.  Instead of a roast, I browned portioned pork ribs in a very high temp. oven for 20 minutes.  Then i placed them over the onion/carrot mixture and then i poured the sauerkraut over that with extra water.  This is so delish......and easy and its worth it to put the extra effort into it.

I LOVE pork and sauerkraut AND I love my crockpot, but I won't do this again.  The flavor wasn't too bad, but the pork dried out horribly. Now, keep in mind that I didn't turn the pork over because it was stuffed and mounded up so nicely... So, I'm not opposed to taking the blame here.  Just wanted to share my experience/mistakes!

The roast was really delicious. I usually just put the kraut all around the roast, but then the kraut loses a lot of its flavor. Never though to cut it dow the center. It kept the roast moist and very flavorful.

i made this last night and it was really good. it was so moist and tender. i let it cook for about 8 1/2-9 hrs. my husband actually shut it off when he got home from the field. i did add about 1/2 a can(6ozs) of beer.i think next time though i will let the kraut and roast sit over night together and let the roast absorb some of the flavor from the kraut.

My whole family disliked this recipe.  I'm a slow cooker fan and use it a lot.  I was a little cautious when the recipe didn't call for some sort of broth (or even water) to cover the pork, because it came out so dry and tasteless.  I was really disappointed with this one....

I was a little worried about how simple this was.  9 hours later while sitting at the dinner table with my family saying "Mom this is sooo good!" and the "Can I have more please?" I knew it was a hit! The meat just fell apart and the kraut was so mild and wonderful.  We will make this often! Thank you!

I just returned from the midwest with a "real" pork roast, and was looking for a good recipe for it.  I tried this one.  I love sauerkraut, husband does not.  He didn't even know it was in there.  I followed recommendations of some others, including a whole onion, some liquid (broth), caraway seeds, and liquid smoke added.  I thought that really helped.  I agree with another reviewer that the cook time is way to long, although I also think my crock pot is super hot.  The taste was ok, but the pork was a little tough, due to over-cooking, even though I cooked it less than recommended. Trying to up the taste level, I added a can of succotash I had on hand, as well as frozen corn.  I served it over brown rice.  Husband loved it.  It wasn't spectacular, but good, healthy comfort food. Mixed it all together for lunch the next day, and put it pita bread.  It was almost Turkish!  Still have a ton of leftovers (there are only two of us), so I am going to try the suggestion of using gravy on it.  Should be good.  I am  a Scandinavian, so didn't grew up with a lot of spice, and this would have fit right in.  I love spice now, but don't mind a nice simple recipe reminding me of childhood now and then.  Thank you.

This was a great dish. My wife and I love sauekraut so we used more than the recipe called for and did not drain or rinse it. After it was done we browned a butter and flour mixture and mad a gravy with the juice that was left. We sometimes mix the sauerkraut in with the gravy and serve over mashed potatoes. We will be making this meal again and again.

This was great, even my kids liked it. I shredded the meat and served it on buns. I used sweet bavarian style sauerkraut and cut up a few apples in it, they cooked away but added good flavor.  I served this with homemade applesauce.

It turned out great. I shredded up a medium apple 1/2 an idaho potato, and mixed that along with 1 tblsp brown sugar, and a heaping teas of caraway  seed to the drained sourkraut. What great comfort food. Potato pancakes go well with this meal.

Really great recipe! We all loved it, even the kids who won't normally eat sauerkraut or cabbage. I only cook it about 7 hrs in my crock pot on low. Also, I always use bagged sauerkraut rather than canned, and drain and rinse it thoroughly. Sometimes I pour a can of beer and a 1/4 C brown sugar over it. I have also made it w/a can of cola (coke or pepsi) poured over it instead of the beer/brown sugar. I always serve it w/mashed potatos and there are rarely leftovers!

The flavor was amazing but the ratio was terrible.  I used fresh kraut from our local butcher and a little over 3 pound pork loin.  There wasn't nearly enough sauer kraut for 6 people.  Imagine dividing a 14 ounce can of green beans between 6 people...........9 hours on high in a crock pot is way over cooked.  I did 6 on medium and it was falling apart tender.  That could be a crock pot issue, but I think 9 hours on high in a crock pot is too much for anything unless you're cooking and entire pig.

Tasted good, but was very dry.  Would like tips on how to make this and not have it turn out so dry. I did serve it with homemade applesauce and sour cream. Hubs only issue was the dryness. Will try again.

This was definitly very very tasty and not too overpowering with the sauerkraut. I was surprised. The only thing was I kept it in for 9 hours on low, maybe I should've only done 8. Next time I'll probably shred it at 7 hours, and put it back in (shredded) on low for another hour so it soaks up the juices, because leaving it in straight through that long made it a little dry. Delicious, though, and I will definitly make it again!

Simple and tasty!  This is my husband's favorite crock pot pork meal.  I use two cans of sauerkraut because we like a lot!  I took the advice of other reviewers and sprinkled 2 tablespoons of brown sugar over the sauerkraut.  I serve with applesauce and pan sauteed pierogies with sliced onion.  Quick and easy weekday meal!

I followed the recipe and added this.
I used 2 cans of sauerkraut,  what kraut I did'nt use after I stuffed the roast I surrounded around the roast in the crock pot.  Then poured a bottle of my fav BBQ sauce over the roast and kraut and added about a half can of beer ,  I suppose broth or water would do or just BBQ sauce only.  Cooked 8-9 hrs.  Fabulous!! Served as a main dish.  A couple of days later warmed the left overs and served on toasted kaiser rolls, even better!!  The kraut BBQ sauce combo very flavorful with pork. Thumbs way up !!

Delicious! My husband was thrilled with this recipe, as he is a big fan of sauerkraut. I added apples and a sprinkling of brown sugar to the recipe, and it gave the sauerkraut a tart sweetness. Very good... definitely a keeper. Thanks!

It had a very good taste. We cooked it with a bit of caraway, brown sugar, potato, and apple as others reviewers have suggested. I found that the sauerkraut taste didn't really carry through as strongly as I would like. Perhaps it was the brand we used, but it became very mellow (a little too mellow for me) after cooking.

It is a nice recipe, but a bit too bland for our taste.  I will use it again, but next time I will probably play around with spices to add a bit more flavor.

This was tasty but not an out of the world recipe.  I cooked mine overnight in the  pot and it was very juicy and tender.  However, I felt like the flavors were a bit too bland for me. I might make again just because it was so easy to prepare.

So easy.  When I was working in the yard, I'd get a whiff of the sauerkraut but it didn't bother me...just made me hungry.  My pork roast didn't need to cook as long, about 5 hours, maybe it was a smaller roast.  It had one of those pop-up thingys so I knew it was done and I was glad because I'd been smelling it all day.

After reading the rave reviews on this simple dish, I was wary but thought I would give it a try.  I was very unimpressed.  I assumed the strong flavor of the sauerkraut would flavor the pork while still remaining flavorful itself just less pungent.  My pork turned out to be somewhat bland, and the sauerkraut seemed to be drained of any flavor it may have started out with.  I like these two ingredients, but together alone for hours in my slow cooker they seemed to have lost all their appeal.  I left it as 3 stars only because the idea of such a simple meal is so tantalizing...it just didn't work for me.

This was pretty good.  I only had purple cabbage and it was fine. it smelled great while cooking.
