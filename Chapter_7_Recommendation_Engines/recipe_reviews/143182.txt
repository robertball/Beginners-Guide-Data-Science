Made this last night and So Glad I did!! Delicious! I let the chicken breasts soak in the mai tai and sweet sour mix for 2 hours, then followed recipe. I also added maraschino cherries to the pineapple mixture then baked it. It was so moist and juicy, what a great taste!! Definitely will make this again!!
