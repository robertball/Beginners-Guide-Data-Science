You should be ashamed of yourself. Family recipes are suppose to be just that, kept in the family. But I'm fo sho glad you shared this one. This is what gumbo is suppose to be.Just the right amount of kick but not to spicy. This will now be passed on down to my family. Thanks Doc!!!

I was looking for an authentic gumbo recipe and I found it.  I've cooked for a long time and try to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it.  As is, this is a great recipe!  I did add a little more Cajun seasoning and cayenne pepper the next day since we like things with "heat".  My wife said that I outdid myself.  Thank you dailyrecipedoctor and your mother and grandmother.

My family's favorite gumbo.  It's fabulous over rice, but if you add two or three cups of water you've got the best thick soup type gumbo you'll ever taste.

5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!  But I must say this the roux is the KEY, if you don't make this right you can hang it up. 

1st things 1st, to get the roux the deep brown that's authentic to New Orleans style it take WAAAAAAAAAAY longer than 20-30 minutes. Lets double it, it takes 1 hour & using a wisk & constantly stirring on medium low heat. I did adjust the heat to high when starting but was stir quickly like a madman then reduce heat to medium low.  A new orleans native told me the darker you get that roux the better. 

2nd - YOU MUST USE FILE POWDER .... it really brings in the flavor and authenticity of New Orleans  Creole taste. Now it was hard to find but you can get it at any health food store some say (Whole Foods) but I got mine down street at Sevenanda health food store. 

Yes this recipe is THE BOMB!! and it does take 3 hours & 40 minutes... almost 4 hours depending on how long you stir your roux, I did at least an hour & 10 minutes.

Now after adding the seafood, you can remove the whole pot from the eye because the Gumbo will be so hot it will cook your shrimp, scallops, & crab meat. I didn't add my seafood till the last 5 minutes while on the stove then I removed it from the stove. Let it cooled down naturally , then put in the fridge served it w/ rice & corn muffins... EVERYONE LOVE IT!! I made a huge pot of it in my 8 quart Dutch Oven. 

I'm so proud this came out so perfect since it was my 1st attempt to making gumbo.

Great recipe!  I'm from the South and my family always makes gumbo without tomatoes.  I was looking for a different recipe and am glad I found this one.  It's delicious!  A note about making a roux - stop working so hard!  You can make it in the oven and it is perfection - thanks Alton Brown.  Whisk 4 oz all purpose flour and 4 oz veg oil in a cast iron skillet, place in a 350 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours, stirring every half hour.  It comes out nice and dark and DOES NOT BURN!!!  Once you remove the roux from the oven, follow the recipe directions by adding the celery, bell pepper, etc. and continue with the recipe.  You're welcome.  ;~)  Oh, and those who are shaming the person who submitted the recipe for giving away a family recipe, get over yourselves!  The submitter never says it was a secret family recipe, just that it was never written down.  We all share recipes our families love, and I am thankful this gumbo recipe was shared!

Ok. I am a 27 year old straight male that does little to no cooking. I recently got engaged so i wanted to learn a few dishes and  this was my first. When i tell you that everyone LOVED this gumbo i mean EVERYONE. I now have been asked to make it for a superbowl party. The recipt was simple and very easy to make.  I made a couple very small changes but that was my choice. I didnt use the bacon drippings because i burn the first roix i tryed to make ( not much a suprise) and i didnt feel like going to get more bacon so i used butter worked great and got it right the first time. The store was sold out of andouille so i went with the next best thing for texans Earl Camble hot links. Honestly Liked it better then andouille and no one noticed the change. I added shredded chicken breast and used crab legs instead of the lumb crab meat presentation just looks better with the crab legs hanging out the pot and bowls . Other then that followed it to the T and it was the BEST GUMBO I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!! Thanks for sharing this one. And you should be ashamed of yourself for giving away that secret, But im sure glad you did.!!!!!!

THis is one of the best gumbo's I've ever had and my family is from the south so that is saying a lot, just dont tell my mother or grandmother. I added shrimp, sausage, chicken and crab meat. I doubled the recipe and brought over to my inlaws for a family dinner and they all loved it... This will be our gumbo recipe for years to come..

I know  little about Creole cooking and this is the real deal.  I had to add a teaspoon of cayenne simply to add a bit more heat and I used 1 cup of bacon drippings vice 3/4 cup.  I doubled the garlic as well.

I was going up against my hubby's gumbo and didn't think I could compare with his.  HA!  Lawd have mercy, ya'll have come up with a total winner!  The step about cooking the okra first in a bit of bacon grease and vinegar was new and different (did it anyway)!  Loved the guy who likes to see the crab legs hanging over the edge of the bowls!  This kind of comment is what makes Allrecipes the premier site for sharing recipes.

There are a few differences - sugar, vinegar in the okra.... both sound like good ideas... it is so very similar to the way I was taught by my Louisiana mother-in-law... Got to be good! I'll be checking on these changes and let you know if I change my mind about them.

I have cooked this recipe several times and followed the steps to the best of my abilities. As a genuine southern coastie Florida and South Alabama I really enjoy good food that is well prepared. I have read through more than a hundred of the reviews of this excellent recipe. Realizing that all ingredients are not available in all areas that one would like to cook this work of art I am puzzled by those who seem to underrate it after modifying the ingredients or cooking procedures.  This procedure is akin to taking a picture of a sunset at noon and then criticizing the outcome.
I'm not sure that this isn't the highest rated recipe on the web. It is certainly the best gumbo that I have ever tasted when made exactly as directed. I applaud the cooks that offered this to the world we owe you our thanks.

I made this for New Year Day and used the largest pot I have [my turkey brining  pot] and followed the recipe almost to the letter with a few riffs.Was under added pressure to produce in that my Father in Law is from Mississippi and over half of my wife's extended family are from Louisiana.Was some head scratching when it was decide the guy from Pennsylvania[ME] was in charge of Gumbo.After extensive research I chose this recipe a fateful choice because it was a TOUCHDOWN!The only significant adjustment worth noting was I used Portuguese Sausage mainly because the price of andouille in absolute terms cost more than the Snow Crab legs[happened to be on sale].Don't know why andouille cost so much in Los Angeles.Also added finely chopped carrots;as said before mostly minor riffs;poached my chicken in broth,etc
The Roux was critical all my Southern "Cousins" were amazed and let me know if the Roux is wrong color it's wrong :-0 but it was beyond even my inflated opion of my skills,like you my mother was such a talented cook.
Chef thank you very much for sharing your family recipe more like a family treasure..
Warmest Regards "Brother Hungry"

Excellent.  To the last reviewer, file powder is Sassafras leaves... you might find it at a gourmet food shop, or even your local grocer.  Look for Sassafras leaves if you cant find file.  Or use this link:  http://www.thespicehouse.com/spices/gumbo-file-powder-powdered-sassafras-leaves

This is a very good recipe.  My personal preference, though, is using a good homemade stock instead of bouillon.  I tried it both ways, and the stock makes a noticeable difference.

For those of you that like chicken in their gumbo, like I do, here is a tip. Brown your boneless skinless chicken thighs in olive oil, butter and minced garlic first.  Then add to the pot after cutting them into thick strips.  It keep them so juicy and alot more flavor.  This recipe is the real deal.  Don't forget the file gumbo at the very end, it makes a big difference.  Sorry to hear that so many can't find file gumbo & okra.  Not having access to okra is a felony in most states and a mortal sin in all the rest.  You will know when the roux is done when it has the color of a Hershey's milk chocolate bar.  My mother told me about roux; she said, when I say to myself, ' I think it should be ready in a couple more min', take it off the heat and add the veggies.  That way you will never burn your roux and have to start all over.

Unbelievably delicious!  Glad one reviewer said it took 70 mins to get the roux the right color -- mine took 60mins,and then did continue to darken for another 10 mins.  It was perfect.  My advice, before you start your roux get comfy, a cold beverage, turn on some music and be prepared to stand in one spot stirring for an hour -- uninterrupted.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a tee (which pained me because I never follow recipes or measure), but given the rave reviews I figured I'd try "as is" first and then monkey with it next time.  Pulsing the vegs in the food processor was a good step that I almost skipped because I actually like chopping and I only pull out the food processor for big projects -- glad I used it because it made the vegs a perfect size and consistency.  I used a spicy andouille plus all of the tabasco and the heat was perfect -- didn't steal from the flavors at all.  This was absolutely delicious and I'll definitely make it again!!

From a Cajun's point of view.... This is the real FIVE STAR GUMBO!! This is the best recipe that I've found. I know how to make gumbo but when someone ask for my recipe I can't give it because I measure nothing at all. Thank you very much.

This is an excellent, authentic New Orleans gumbo. I've lived in Louisiana all my life and spent many years just outside of New Orleans, I've eaten almost every kind of gumbo and invented a few myself. My wife and daughter have Celiac disease and can't have anything with flower, so I substituted Gluten free Bisquick for the flour and you can't tell the difference. HUGE kudos on letting the secret out, you've made a ton of people very happy. Don't change the recipe unless it's servings, you can't ask for a better seafood gumbo. The time and money are SOOO worth it. Add cayenne to individual bowls if ya like a little more spice, I personally thought it was spot on. I used Jack Millers Cajun spice instead of Tony's, just my preference.

This is a good basic recipe, however it should be made with a seafood stock rather than all the water and beef boullion cubes. Just take your shrimp shells and legs (I save them from other recipes also and freeze them so that I have a lot on hand), quarter an onion or 2, cut 3 stalks celery in thirds and add 4 quarts water. Simmer this for as long as possible (8 hours is best). Do it the day before and you will be ready to go. Also, do not add the shrimp and crab until the last 5 mins or so of cooking or they will be tough.

outstanding recipe!!  a little time consuming, but well worth the effort!  might be a little thin, I added a 1-1/2 cups of flour for roux.  other than that about as authentic as you can get!  will definitely make this again.

I cut the recipe in half, eliminated the file (don't know what it is and couldn't find it) and added 1 1/3 C rice at the end.  The consistency was perfect!  I also didn't use the okra, but instead added a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch.  Used a can of crabmeat.  Yum!

My husband is a big cajun food fan and asked me to make Gumbo for him.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted chicken for the seafood.  He loved it so much that he is now eating thirds and is smirking like a goon the whole time and flashing his eyebrows at me!  Good stuff!  Watch the roux like a hawk though - I burned mine the first time through!

THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!  I followed directions, EXCEPT:  1. 60 min of whisking roux to get deep rich color.  2. at the point between adding veggies and adding the seafood I cooled it and kept in fridge for the next day. Next day prior to dinner, I re-heated the gumbo and resumed with the recipe. 4. Lastly, i separated gumbo prior to adding seafood for a son with shellfish allergies. His had the sausage and added dark turkey meat.  Re: cajun spice and Tabasco-added only 1/2 the amt of the spice and put Tabasco on table for individual taste adjustments. My superbowl crowd came back for seconds and thirds. IF you have leftovers, it IS better the next day.  This gumbo was as good as Brennan's or Antoine's. Laissez les bons temps rouler!

I've had a boatload of trouble making roux in the past. I've burned it, didn't cook it long enough, you name it, I've done it.  This time, I used Alton Brown's baked roux and it came out great.  Like others, I added more seasoning and hot sauce to kick it up a notch or two.  GREAT recipe.  

I've been a member of this website for a long time and this is my first review, because this recipe is that good.  Thanks for posting it.

I was unimpressed. The took a lot of time and effort and had an overwhelming sausage flavor. I wouldn't make this again.

This was my very first time making gumbo and my guests who had come over for a King Party loved it!  Some of these guests were born and raised Louisianans and they gave their approval as well!  The flavor and consistency were very good, HOWEVER:  I disagree that the roux should be added to HOT broth--it should be added to room temp. broth instead.  Hot should never be added to hot--it will have trouble mixing together which is what happened the first time around--the roux just floated on top and never consolidated with the broth.  (Yes--I made this 2 times before the event!)  I also cooked the roux until just a moderate caramel color, NOT DARK!  The veggies were added and stirred in, NOT sauteed b/c of the danger of burning the roux w/ continued cooking.  On my stove, it took a minimum of 40-50 minutes to safely get to the color I wanted for the roux.  Next time w/ these precautions, maybe I can make it just ONCE!

Good heavens above!!  This recipe was awesome!!  I halved the recipe and it was PLENTY for us (it was just 3 of us and we have leftovers for tonight's dinner).  This is not cheap to make and it is time consuming but well, WELL worth it.  I did make rice to go with it but left it on the side so we could add as little or as much as we wanted.  When I first read this recipe, I did not have bacon grease and I wondered if it was necessary.  Let me go ahead and say YES it is necessary.  Don't skip this step.  Do not change a thing...whatever you do will not do this recipe justice.  I can't say enough about it.  AWESOME!

Made this recipe the first time a few weeks ago and it was AWESOME!The wife is not much into shrimp but once she pucked them out (more for me) she too thought it was a keeper. Being a New Yorker living in Texas and cooking this Gumbo is unheard of. But when it came to serving it to family and friends I had to fend them off from the pot to keep them from licking it. (licking their bowls was acceptable because they were served in to go plastic bowls). The only flaw is too bad I can't rate this a 10! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is far and away the best gumbo recipe that I have tried!  Gumbo is a great dish to serve for those cold fall parties or tailgaters.  I have tried a few different recipes over the years but nothing has really hit the mark.

For our annual Halloween Party this recipe turned out to be just perfect!  Everyone commented how authentic it tasted.  And it was relatively easy to make.  I've tried recipes that require so many more steps and ingrediants.  This one was fairly simple though it did take quite some time to make.

Luckily I still have the recipe and will be making this throughout the winter to keep us warm.

Awesome recipe!   First review ever, but this was so good I feel I have to express how delicious it was.  It wasn't quite as thick as I was expecting it to be but I'm glad.  I used beef broth from a smoked brisket, probably added some good flavor.  Also baked the roux in the oven to make it easier.  Never tried this method, takes a bit longer, but worked wonders!  No burning.

Amazingly delish!! My first time making gumbo. So so good!  I substituted olive oil for the bacon fat to make the roux. But then I added 8 small strips of precooked bacon (w/ fat cooked off) chopped up, to the gumbo for flavor. :)   I also added three half chicken breasts cut in thirds to the big pot of broth after the roux was added....then shredded them after cooking on low, uncovered, for almost 2 hrs.  Also, based on recommendations from others, I decreased the amount of water to 2 qts. Added in the okra, shrimp, and only 1 can of crab meat at the end.  Yummmm.  Will definitely make this again!

I am from the Gulf Coast (Pensacola) and love gumbo, but have never made it.  I did the research to find a recipe with a high rating and decided on this one to be my first.  This recipe was wonderful!!!!!  I did make a few substitutions and additions, though.  Rather than 3 QTs water and beef bullion cubes I used 1 quart each of seafood and vegetable stock and 2 quarts of water.  I needed more than the 3 quarts suggested because I added 3 diced chicken breasts (pan seared and then diced), 1 pound of lump crab meat, 1 pound of shrimp (peeled and deveined) and I doubled the sausage.  My husband loves very hearty, meaty gumbo - so he absolutely LOVED this!!  Thank you so much!  I can't wait to make it again! :)

Oh boy!  This is like heaven in a bowl.  THIS is the kind of gumbo I dream of and crave and wait all year to get when we go NOLA.  I did not change a thing in this recipe and it turned out absolutely perfect!  

Thick and rich and full of flavor.  The flavors are intense and subtle all at the same time.   I made it last night for our church supper tonight and it was better this morning for breakfast than when I made it last night.  By dinner tonight it will be over the top!

What a GREAT recipe! Thanks for the tip on making the roux...otherwise i may have burned it. I stirred constantly til it got nice and dark. It makes a big batch, but you'll need it. Everyone LOVED it...even my picky eaters. I topped it off with a scoop of rice and served it with a Hurricane in an LSU cup. (see picture) I will FOR SURE be making this again! Thanks so much for sharing such a family treasure! : )

Beyond amazing! I used chicken thighs & crawfish tails in addition to the shrimp & andouille & in place of crab meat. I also baked my roux! Yes, baked! Alton Brown is a genious & his method SERIOUSLY helps with time management. Equal parts oil/fat & flour in the oven at 350 for 1.5hrs, whisking every 30 min. Comes out a perfect, chocolatey color every time! Thank you so much for this recipe. This is the 3rd time I've made this recipe & gumbo in general, I've ate tons, however, and I'm so thankful to have "my own" recipe now! Thank you, thank you! Will upload pix.....

This was absolutely fabulous!  The best gumbo I have ever tasted.  My grandfather was a cook on a huge ship that traveled the world.  Everytime he came home we celebrated with a big pot of gumbo.  Our family loves it. Unfortunately, we never took down his recipie.  I was looking for something that would be as good as his and I must say, this was even better (sorry grandpa).  The flavors were perfect.  We did the recipe to the T and I would not change a thing!  Thank you so much for sharing your family recipie, it will now live on in our family for a long time to come.  :)

Great recipe!  I cut the recipe in half.  Only changes I made was I used about 1 lb chicken thighs in place of the lump crab meat (didn't want to pay what they wanted to charge for the crab meat).  Also, I like to freeze soups and stews in individual servings to take to work.

I haven't been to New Orleans in so long, I don't recall what their gumbo was like, but this is by far better than anything they have around the Clearwater, Fl area.

This freezes well and tastes as good, if not better, after frozen.  I will no longer be looking for a good gumbo recipe - this one is all I need.  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Yes, this did take three hours. I was hoping to finish it all by two hours, but at the three hour mark the richness of the gumbo just infused the entire pot. My family went back for thirds. This recipe was way better than most of the gumbos that we tried in New Orleans. THIS is gumbo. I will be keeping this recipe around for a very long time. Thank you!

Better than awesome! followed everything to the tee, added 3 minced cloves of garlic, tossed fresh shrimp into a steamer pan and dipped it into the brew for 1 minute to cook. removed and let each person dish their rice, crab meat and shrimp into their bowl before spooning gumbo onto the pile. this way the rice and seafood never overcooked!

Goodness, this is a great recipe! I mean lawdy lawd! I made this gumbo last night for my family of 3. I was thinking that I would have too much gumbo left over since this recipe makes a good amount, so I planned to freeze some, but there was no need because GOOD GUMBO doesn't last long, no matter what. Well, at least not around my family. This was MY VERY FIRST TIME making gumbo, and this recipe is the reason I was able to make a masterpiece work of art! I gave some to my mom, grandma, my brother and sister-in-law, mother-in-law, and best friend. And guess what? After my husband, daughter, and I all had our helpings, there isn't much left at all. It's A SHAME this gumbo is so good. Now my family is requesting that I make gumbo again for Thanksgiving or Christmas, and maybe even New Years. Oh by the way, my husband was hesitant on me making gumbo since it was my first time. I sure did shut down his doubts with this recipe!

I did not add okra, vinegar, or Worcestershire sauce. And the flavor was still outstanding. I also added a 14.5 ounce can of tomato sauce instead of 6 ounce, and this caused for a red gumbo bursting with flavor! This recipe is simple as long as you are patient with making the roux. I am very pleased that older women in my family were quite impressed.

One of the best recipes I've ever found online in any category. I used real butter instead of bacon grease for the roux, and halved the shrimp and substituted chicken (which I briefly sauteed before adding to the soup at the same time as the sausage). Other than that, I followed the recipe pretty much verbatim, save for doing the herbs and spices more to my taste. It takes time to make, but it is so worth the wait! My son and my girlfriend, who have a limited tolerance for spicy foods, both loved it, and adding a little extra hot sauce to mine put it right where I like it without overpowering the other flavors. Kudos to you for the fantastic recipe! I will definitely be making this one again!!

This is the best gumbo I have ever made, and probably the best I have ever eaten.  Only thing I did different was make a stock out of my shrimp shells which ended up being 2 quarts, and that is all the liquid I used.  Just added the bouillon to the shrimp stock.  Thanks for sharing!!

We LOVE this recipe!!!  This gumbo is truly better than the gumbo at the Gumbo Shop in New Orleans.  I pretty much followed the recipe except I added clams, scallops, shrimp,& a seafood mix.  Turned out wonderfully.  It's true what everyone says, this is really about the roux and the file powder.  Take the time and do the roux right.  It is worth it in the end.  A big thank you to daily recipe doctor for sharing this fabulous recipe.  We really enjoyed it!

Very very good!  I made the roux as directed and it did take almost an hour to darken nicely.  Meanwhile I brought 4 C of homemade chix stock + 2C water with the 3 tsps Jamisons beef paste to boil.  Added the roux/sausage/veggie mix and then added all the other veggies once the roux was heated through.  Served this luscious concoction over white rice to rave reviews!  Also always make my own Cajun seasoning and added an extra tsp of Thyme. So Good!!

I made this recipe for Nashville's Queen of The Blue, Marion James, birthday, she loved it!!! First time I made Gumbo, and people were asking if I was from Louisiana, I love the south but I was born in California. If you follow this recipe to the core, it absolutely rocks!

Reminds me of my Mima (grandma) who was Acadienne/Cajun. Sadly, we cannot find Okra or Gumbo File Powder in Quebec. I would love to know what can be use as a probably "poor" substitute! Thank you very much!

Ok, I hardly ever write a review but I had to on this one. I wanted to make gumbo for my mother in law for mothers day. I found this recipe and made it a day in advance. Everyone Loved it! They go to New Orleans and said this was the best Gumbo they have ever had! I'll be hanging on to this recipe, thank you so much for sharing it!

Awesome! Took about 3 hours but worth it. I did not have crabmeat, okra, can of tom. or tom. juice. Substituted ketchup and did not add sugar. 2 roma tomatoes. Used half the hot sauce. Put in catfish in place of crabmeat. Yum!

Made this for my family today and it was a complete hit.  Well worth the prep time.  I too have experimented with several Gumbo recipes and this one tops them all.  The best lesson learned is cooking the Okra with the vinegar; no slimy texture, very nice!  I am looking forward to making this again for Mardi Gras!  May even slip it in again before then.

Great recipe. My family loved it. I added more heat as we like a little spice. I thought it would be a great keeper and my family wants it more often than I am willing to make.

Great recipe!  I didn't have the recommended time allotment for this recipe but was dying to try it anyway and it was still fantastic!  I simply shortcut the later simmer stages.  The roux I obviously had to make time to complete but all in all, I only simmered less than an hour.  Makes enough to freeze leftover-----and it froze great, too!  We've eaten the frozen portion and it was just as tasty.
Update: still loving this recipe! I do want to add my two cents regarding the roux. I found the mahogany stage takes wayyyyy longer if I use my heavier (calphhalon-like)stockpot. Like hours it seems! If I use my basic, lighter weight pot, the heat comes through faster. But of course take care not to cook it too fast as it can burn easily in ANY pan! I did just give it a go in my Dutch oven and that went well despite its heavy bottom- presumably because cast iron heats so well.

Fantastic recipe!!!! I made this a day ahead so the flavors could mellow as others suggested and served over rice. I used fresh Andouille Sausage ( not smoked ) and chicken; no shrinp or crab. Homemade chicken stock instead of beef bullion.I didn't precook the okra, just thawed and added to the gumbo. I have also used smoked sausage but it is best with Andouille ( but a bit more pricey.)Love the flavor the bacon grease gives this,I will always make my roux this way from now on.I took a double batch made with smoked sausage and chicken to a meeting at work and everyone raved about it. My pot came home empty which is always a good sign.I purchase chicken leg quarters in a 10 lb. bag at WallMart ( $5.90 ) and boil then with some onion, celery and carrots. I had enough stock and chicken for this dish, chicken and dumplings, a small pot of chicken noodle soup and one chicken salad sandwich. Your family and friends will love this!!!! Thank you for sharing your recipe!oh, I served crusty bread and pecan pie with this for an unforgettable meal.

Lived in cajun country for over 15years, love the food, have made gumbo myself for 20+ years.  Tried this recipe (except I used olive oil instead of bacon grease) Best gumbo I've ever made.  Exactly what it tastes like in my favorite Louisiana dives, this is a keeper!  Very authentic.  Would probably be better with the bacon grease, but I was fresh out of bacon...

Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing. I've been home sick and dying for some Gumbo. Can't get quality cajun or southern food in Chicago. I made this recipe today and let me tell you, it's so good make you wanna slap ya mama :) Speaking of...I used slap ya mama cajun seasoning in my gumbo and replaced the crab meat with chicken. YUMMYYYYYY!!!!!!

The reviews were dead on for this recipe.  I made this for a large Packer tailgate this past weekend and had to create a long list of folks to forward this recipe on to.  I didn't have access to great crab meat and ran out of prep time so I left it out. I may add some cubed chicken thighs next time for additional texture and flavor. Thank you for sharing! Hint... it is not a quick meal, so be prepared to designate the right amount of time to be sure it tastes as good as it should.

This was the first time I had ever made gumbo. It is a bit time consuming but it is SO WORTH IT! We have saying in our house if something is good we call it "slap ya mama good" this gumbo was "slap ya granmama good" I can't brag on it enough!! The only thing I added was chicken and stone crab legs!

Delicious!! My boyfriend and I thought this wasn't going to be that great. Then we sat down to eat and we were blow away. He even gave it a 10 and both my kids ate it without complaining (after picking out the shrimp of course). The only thing I would do different is have EVERYTHING prepared before you start.

Good recipe but the roux always sucks to make. I looked at a better way and found out that if you bake at 350 for 90 minutes it gives you the same roux. MUCH easier. I also used more sausage, added some chicken, no crab and be careful pulsing the veges. I turned them into dust and would only lightly chop next time. I also added a Serrano pepper to spicy it up. This makes a huge amount so be ready for that and last, my wife’s not a big shrimp eater so reduced it to 1 pound BUT and trust me on this, I had A leftover rotisserie chicken from Publix, so I remove the skin as much as I could and plopped  in whole. Then Just took the bones out and cut up the chicken at the end. The fact that the chicken bones cooked for a couple hours made the soup amazing. I also forgot to mention I cooked the okra longer, slimy okra is nasty.

OMG, this was delicious.  I used the Tony Chachere's with extra kick. I put the bacon drippings and flour, stirred together, in an uncovered dutch oven in an oven set to 350 degrees.  i took it out every 20 minutes and stirred it--took a little over 2 hours to get nice and dark red brown.
Next time I will put the okra in with the other vegetables, as I prefer it to fall completely apart and just thicken the stew.  Tastes great and we will make this again.

This is some mean gumbo! I added in some chicken quarters, tossed in the entire legs and chunks of thigh meat. Added those bad boys in to cook when I tossed in the sausage. This was a great cold Sunday night dinner! A big bowl with white rice, gumbo on top, a piece of corn bread and a hunk of boiled corn to the side. Definitely a recipe to make again, next time to invite some friends over to share with!

This is a good recipie to use. I modified it by doing the following:

1) I'm not wasting bacon to make this, so all the bacon drippings it calls for I simply replaced with butter- just as effective.

2) the extra tomato paste I just plain threw out, the stewed tomatoes are enough

3) the crab meat isn't totally necessary. It's kind-of hit or miss depending on the audience.

4) it tastes better and less tomato-y if you cook the roux longer until it's really dark brown.

This is fabulous!  It was my first attempt at gumbo, and after 4 YouTube videos on making the roux I was ready for the time it took. But each of those suggested 1 to 1 oil and flour so I did that. DON'T.  This recipe is correct. By personal preference I spooned off floating fat that the sausage gave up, so was sorry to have also used more fat for the roux. (My fat was a mixture of bacon grease and Crisco.) Also, the fish market didn't have crab so I used shrimp only.  Was fab.  I served this with a scoop of stone ground grits that were cooked in a crock pot with chicken stock and a little heavy cream.  Salad of orange/lettuce/fennel with light orange dressing (found it on AllRecipes).

We have made this twice and love it, first of all, it makes a lot.  We ate some, had leftovers the next day and froze some. It freezes well. We called it our $50 gumbo because crab meat, andouille and catfish (which we added) all are expensive. It's worth it though, tastes great,

Yum!!! I'm from New Orleans currently living out of state, so I was looking for the best gumbo recipe to remind me of home and I hit the jackpot with this one! It took me much longer than 4 hours to make, but man was it worth it! I also substituted the crab for (boiled and pulled)chicken, because my favorite gumbo is chicken, adouille and shrimp. I double the recipe and made this for 30+ people and everyone loved it!

Yes, I don't know how old your grandma & mother are. But I am sure the bacon fat they used, was not from the same pork we buy today. Also I am sure as true cajuns, they would have made their own stock. Not beef bullion cubes. Although it is a fantastic recipe, I think making your own stock would only improve the taste. Thanks for sharing.

I ended up trying 3/4 c bacon drippings and had to add another cup of flour.  I was following another poster's suggestion to cook roux to very dark color and it ended up bitter :(  Glad I did not add the expensive ingredients.  Disappointed in time spent, but I will try again with 1/4 c bacon drippings tomorrow and research cooking roux.

This was the best gumbo ever. We attended the Seafood Festival in Biloxy, Mississippi in 2012 and tried the gumbo contest with 24 vendors and the first one we tasted was really good but this recipe was the best. I used artificial crab instead of crab meat but everything else was used according to the recipe. I thought I would have a problem finding the gumbo file powder but we found it at our local Publix. This makes a ton and perfect for Super Bowl Sunday.

Never had gumbo before (I've had canned "gumbo", which isn't very good), and I made this because I wanted to try real gumbo. WOW!!!  Is all me and my husband had to say!  It is so  tasty!!!  He didn't mind the spice at all, and he hates spicy food!  Only note is that, I hadn't realize just how much this makes!!!  Someone said they double this recipe...  Yikes!  Without doubling it, the recipe completely filled my soup pot which is a good 10quarts!  Ate it everyday for a week and still had some to freeze!  That's not a complaint, just realize this is meant to be made to serve a lot of people, not just a couple.  :)

God Bless ~Amy

So, I have been looking for a great authentic gumbo recipe for years. I have tried many and none of them took me back to when I lived down south. I have found it!!! I made this recipe last night and am now convinced that I have some creole in me! It is soooo delicious! The kids loved it. Winner! If you have some time (3 hours)..try this one! I used cajun seasoned chicken sausage instead of the andouille.

I went cheap and prepared it without any meat/seafood (still used bacon grease) and it  turned out great. My boyfriend is allergic to shellfish but one day I'm gonna cook this again with the andouille.

Excellent gumbo! Everyone loved it! It is not very spicy which is the way I like it! If you like more of a kick, increase the cajun seasoning. It was perfect for us as is!

Definitely not New Orleans Creole gumbo. First place, no self respecting Creole would use both file and okra, nor would they use bullion cubes or Cajun seasoning as called for in your recipe. I could go on, but I'll simply say, as an avid fan of your site,  I'm disappointed in this posting. I gave one star because I  fear without it you would exclude my comments.

Okay, first off,  the flavor(ingredient) profile worked. As for method-no- so adding the trinity without sauteing cuts the flavor; I sauteed the veg, added my spices, then added the flour to make the roux. 

I used a method from another recipe that made sense; sauteed the shrimp shells in butter/oil, added stock, simmer for 15 min. Strained, I added this to my veg, and liquid ingredients, uncovered, in a wok, with the chicken for about a half hour, uncovered. 

Finally, THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THIS RECIPE IS A TYPO-YOU DO NOT COOK SHRIMP FOR 45 MINUTES, OR AS PAUL PROUDOME SAID, YOU DON'T COOK SHRIMP, YOU HEAT THEM.

I made this gumbo using alligator, chorizo sausage,  shrimp, and crab meat. Also used gluten free flour for the roux.  Seriously, the best gumbo I have ever eaten in my entire life. I was hesitant using the gluten-free flour, but the roux turned out perfectly. Will definitely make this again. Well worth the effort!!

Very good recipe. Quite tasty. But, I read the reviews and they said it had too much bacon grease. So, I eliminated the last of the grease. And the roux should be equal parts of grease and flour. Also, I didn't want to use the Orka so I didn't use it as well as the vinegar.

Holeeee cow this was amazing!!!!!!! Cannot rate this recipe high enough. Made this recipe EXACTLY as stated. It came out phenomenal. Don't venture away from this recipe, don't start subbing your own ideas in here. This was outstanding.

I used a cast iron skillet to make my roux. Keep the heat low and stir constantly. It took an hour but my roux came out a nice dark brown color. That is the key in making this dish!!!

You could not convince me after eating (way too much) gumbo yesterday that it would have been better on Monday for lunch..... I completely underestimated how good it would be.... the video told the absolute truth.  Best dang gumbo I have eaten and proud to have made it.  I used another chef's technique (initials AB on the other network) to make the roux, I put in a pot of the bacon drippings and flour in the oven at 350 for 1 and 1/2 hours.  Gave me plenty of time to peel shrimp and cut veggies.  Worked perfectly!!  Crab was a bit pricey but well work it.  Fortunately we harvest shrimp out of the lagoon in the back yard so the sweet shrimp were a nice complement of flavor.  Thank you for the recipe!  Definitely in my allrecipe.com recipe box!

Too much bacon taste.  Bacon drippings take the taste away from the seafood.....Otherwise good.  I also didn't use beef bouillon cubes.

This is my first time giving a review...I felt obligated to give one. First let me say THANK YOU! Your awesome, authentic & very easy to follow Gumbo recipe saved my Christmas dinner. I wouldn't change anything about the recipe, my only suggestions...BEFORE BEGINNING...READ UP ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROUX (it is crucial). I did add chunks of Costco Roasted Chicken (where i also bought my snow crab and hot links:) 30 min before done, fried okra in a separate pan & then add some of the soup to it to serve it up separately since some of my guests didn't not like okra. 

Now for those interested, my story...It took YEARS to get gradually (bit by bit) a gumbo recipe from my husband's Great Aunt Willa. I FINALLY achieved in what I thought to be a complete recipe after 13 years and had tweeked the recipe to my liking the last 7 years. I went to pull out the recipe card just to discover that either I misplaced it or one of my 6 children borrowed it without me knowing. So in my desperation I went to allrecipes.com and found this recipe that looked as close to Aunt Willas. I could get shunned for saying this but you should know...your recipe is BETTER! In Aunt Willa's defense, she never actually made it with me, she just described the details AND she probably explained the Roux part but didn't know the term so I never knew the color importance. I have to say, I'm glad I couldn't find my recipe card!

So, this summer, I went to Louisiana and had gumbo for the first time, and it was a revelation. This gumbo is just like that.

This recipe is amazing.  I made some tweaks (omitted file powder, used crawfish tails instead of shrimp, omitted tomato sauce and bay leaves), but this always turns out amazing.  The only think you have to watch is the roux (bacon fat heats differently than oil).  Delish!  My husband requests this monthly.  Well worth the effort.

Looking for a great gumbo recipe? Stop looking and start cooking. I have made this several times now and every time I get rave reviews.  One thing though be sure you have a really big pot as this will easily fill an 8 quart dutch oven to the brim.  If you don't want to mess with tending the roux search the internet for "oven roux" and let your oven do the work for you.

I have never rated a recipe before but this recipe deserve more than 5 stars.  I lived in New Orleans for 2 years and I have been searching for a gumbo recipe that was as authentic as a  what I tasted there.  This is it.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Tried this recipe to celebrate New Year's (bringing in 2014).  One word, EXCELLENT!!!  I am from a family that has Louisiana roots.  I am no stranger to gumbo as my mom makes one that is also excellent.  However, I enjoy trying different versions.  I am so glad I tried this one!!  Everyone in my family enjoyed it - including my mother!!  This is for sure a keeper!! Thanks for sharing.

I live in New Orleans and I wanted to cook gumbo like I should know how to cook because I live in NOLA.  This was perfect.  I used brown rice instead of regular flour to make it gluten free.  Everyone I served it to absolutely loved it.

Amazing! Only changes were cutting it in half, adding a little more water since our stove is really hot, and adding a little more shrimp instead of crabmeat. The shrimp melted like well cooked lobster, not at all tough like I thought 45 minutes of cooking would make them. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've eaten a lot of gumbo over the years and this is the best recipe I've ever tried. I plan on adding more shrimp next time but that is the only change I would make.

This is delicious.  I used chicken breast and sausage for the proteins, and after I made the roux I threw it all in the slow cooker for a total of 9 hours.  Yum!

Oh my, oh my. This was SO AMAZING! I followed the recipe as much as I could. The only things different that I did: I didn't put any gumbo file powder (couldn't find it anywhere) and I put chicken thighs instead of crab meat. Seriously, it was so good, I can't believe I've never thought about making this before.
Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

Omg, I can't believe you shared a family secret recipe online! How horrible for you but so good for me! I almost feel ashamed of myself for using it, but my taste buds are loving it. I subsituted the fat used for the rouz. I used a mix of the cooked sausage, chicken, some evoo and some butter for the roux and caramalized the onions in the final minutes of making the roux. That is all I did differently besides timing. Although I wish I hadn't used the food processor on the veggies. It seems like I am not eating any veggies. but other than that the soup is really good and has great texture.

This is a winner with everyone. I skipped the worcetershire sauce and I'm sure it wasnt missed. Chicken base instead of the beef bouillon(all I had) and smoked polish sausage in place of andouille (couldnt find). Crab meat was 15.99 lb so I skipped but I kept everything else the same. The roux took about an hour but I was chopping veggies and stirring it in between so it wasnt bad but I'm sure it made the difference. I used frozen okra so I skipped the step where you cook seperate in vinegar. I just threw it in near the end. Added shrimp at the very end. I had to use a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes cause I didnt have any other and I really thought the whole thing was great. Couldnt find file powder, I have no idea how it would have made this any better.

This recipe is certainly worth the effort. Just enough heat and abounds in flavor! I used crabmeat but didn't spend the extra $$ for lump crab :(. Next time, I would certainly use a striper or swordfish to replace the crabmeat. Thanks for sharing your family recipe.

I just made this rescipe for the second time.  I made the roux using olive oil rather than bacon fat and had a perfect, somewhat more healthy result.  I lived in New Orleans for 7 years and this gumbo tops them all!

This was unbelievably good. First time to make anything this involved and it came out amazing. 

The tips about the roux were really helpful...it took a good 15 minutes to get it cooked to dark brown, but everything else was really straightforward. 

Added a little bit of extra worcestershire and black pepper at the end just to taste, but really you can't go wrong with this. Delicious and made a ton of it to serve many many people.

I don't follow this recipe exactly (no crab meat, even though I love it, just due to price), but this is my base recipe. It turns out so amazing, and we eat it for a couple of days. I'm making it again tonight. Thanks for sharing, it's the BEST!

This was a lot of work but truly worth it!  We used smoked sausage instead of andouille (as per our taste preference) and also added some chicken.  The results were just delicious!  I believe it is the cooking of the roux for the appropriate amount of time that makes this recipe so much better than others.  We also added some cooked rice when serving.  It is even better after it sits.

This gumbo is amazing.  It took me about four hours to complete but it was oh so worth it.  It had been ab out four months since we had left New Orleans and my wife and I were craving the food.  This did the job.

I'm not going to comment on how gumbo is made in different houses but vinegar and sugar has never been an ingredient in gumbo in New Orleans. If it's to make the okra less stringy, all you have to do is cook it out. As for the file' n the gumbo, don't do it. Okra is a thickener and file' s a thickener. You'll end up with a sloppy mess that will spoil the entire pot. File' s added per serving.

good gumbo. I added a teaspoon of cayenne because I like a little heat. Only used 2 lbs of shrimp instead of 3, but cooked my roux for over an hour. The darker the better New Orleans chefs say!

Beef bouillon cubes!!!  Are you kidding and tomatoes. This is Not Cajun gumbo. Good chicken stock should be used along with adding the vegetables to the roux until they are cooked down then add the broth and spices. If you want a 5 star gumbo look up Emerils recipe.

Great gumbo recipe and I have experimented with dozens.   Cooking the okra with the vinegar before going into gumbo is key!  Keeps the okra from becoming mush. Great flavor profile

i consider myself an avid cook. certainly not a chef but i cook a lot and all our friends know they are getting a good meal of they come to our house.   i doubled this recipe but followed it to the letter.   it was my first time making Gumbo.   my wife and friends all said it was the best they have ever had. im very critical of my own cooking but i Agree.    this recipe is amazing.

Coming from Midwestern and Mountain backgrounds, Cajun isn’t something we ever have opportunity to try. But then my son and husband went to New Orleans and fell in love with the food, so I had to try this recipe. After the challenge of hunting down all authentic ingredients (we’re in barbecue country), I made this delicious gumbo, exactly as written, but cut the recipe in half because it feeds 20! It was delightfully different for our taste buds! However, as much as we enjoyed it, the project was time intensive so it won’t become a regular on our dinner table. Thank you for sharing, it was fun trying something new!

This was very good.  Certainly not a "throw together" recipe.  It took a lot of time.  Browning the roux, mincing the veggies (I don't have a food processor).  Cooking and cooking.  The results were worth it.  Was perfect for a cold, lazy Sunday-- having a pot of something delicious simmering on the stove. Great idea cooking the okra with the vinegar for 15 minutes.  That got rid of a lot of the slime.  All the flavors blended nicely.  I did make some minor adjustments.  I like more heat.  I added 1t. cayenne which kicked it up slightly.  Could have used more.  The grocery only had fresh okra, not frozen, so no big deal to substitute.  Also, I used 2lbs shrimp (1lb less that called for) but added  4 boneless chicken thighs, diced.  It was great.  The crab didn't hold up but it almost "melted" into the broth, lending a smooth but consistent flavor.  Please don't leave this out.  And of course you must add the gumbo file!  File is a sassafras root powder, the same flavor as rootbeer.  It sounds strange but gives the gumbo that familiar tang but is not overpowering. If this gumbo had more of a spicy "kick" I would have given it a higher star rating.  4.5 is what I'd really give if I could.  It should freeze well, so I'm happy about that.

Excellent recipe. Very easy to follow directions. Going to be making this again and this time for my northerner Dad. Can't wait. My children loved it and they are begging me to make this again. In laws loved it as well. I cooked the sausage out of the main soup so that it isn't hot for the kids. Just love this recipe. Even got an account on this site just to rate it. Thank you.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, but without tomatoes.  I used the Alton Brown technique to make the roux (which took forever,  I wish I had just spent a half hour over the stove). I was impressed with the depth of the flavor and overall dish. My issue was that adding the shrimp 45 minutes before the gumbo was done cooking left the shrimp small and the tails disintegrated into the stew and we found small unappetizing shards as we ate. I may have been reading the recipe wrong, but I think it would have been better to add the shrimp just a few minutes before turning off the heat with the filé powder.

Used Alton Brown’s method to make roux.  Baked in oven 350, for 1.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes.  Easy.  Followed the recipe for the rest and it was delicious!

Read the reviews where the Roux needs cooked longer - at least an HOUR on low/med heat watching heat closely and constantly whisking with a wire brush.  This gumbo is NOT easy but OMG so worth it.  I used left over turkey from Thanksgiving and sausage.  Threw in the shrimp the last 10 . minutes.  REALLY great true Cajun gumbo.  The secret is the roux, do NOT substitute or cook just 20 minutes..the darker the roux without being burnt (ruined) the better the gumbo

Wow!  This is the best Gumbo I have ever made, hands down. I changed a few things but when making gumbo that is expected.  No file and I added smoked pulled pork, andouille sausage and shrimp-- so good.  3 tbs of cajun season cuz I likes my gumbo spicy and lots of tobasco.  I did not use worcestershire...because I forgot.  You got to get the roux right that is the key to good gumbo mine took about an hour and a half at low heat  yep low and slow and never stop whisking.   "STIR THE ROUX!!!!"

8-18-2017  ~This is the second time I’ve made this.   I first made it some months ago, but my review somehow mysteriously disappeared. In my first review I remarked how out of this world good this was, even though I took some necessary shortcuts to the recipe in the interest of saving time.  As lengthy as the preparation of this recipe is, I decided that this time there would be no shortcuts, that I would prepare it as the recipe directed.  The main deviation I did make, however,  was that once the shrimp and crab were added, I did NOT cook this another 45 minutes – not advisable in my opinion, as this is about 40 minutes more cooking time than the shrimp needs.  I have to say that my first stab at this recipe was no less delicious than the second, and required a lot less muss, fuss and time.  Whether you make this the “short” way or the “long” way, just make it.  It is a true delight, a real taste sensation.

This was fabulous, but since I tweaked the recipe I rated it 4 stars (5 as tweaked). Modifications: cut the proportions down to 5 servings; skipped the water and bouillon cubes in favor of stock I'd made and frozen (Half chicken stock, half beef stock); used a yellow bell pepper instead of green, and added some fresh poblano pepper instead of the chili sauce; also added some chicken thigh meat that had been "marinated" in Cajun spice mix for several hours. Finally, let the whole thing sit in the fridge overnight to let all the flavored  blend, and served over rice. Thanks for posting!

A wonderful recipe with great depth of flavour, of course I changed things slightly if I didn't have them (as you do!) but FUNDAMENTALLY I followed it. 

Good instructions, too. I just add: if your family dislikes okra, try roasting it in the oven first and it's not so slimy.

Bon appetite!

Having lived in New Orleans off and on over the years, I'm not a newby to good gumbo. I think this recipe is pretty good, but it didn't blow me away. Perhaps it's me having limited access to all fresh ingredients that puts me at a disadvantage, but I thought it was a little bland. I also like my gumbo consistency a bit thicker. I'm going to let it meld for a few days, and if the flavors improve (like they usually do), I'll revisit this review. 
Update: After a few days in the fridge, the flavor is indeed much improved.

Absolutely loved it - made this for game day and did not disappoint!  The only thing I changed was replaced crab with chicken and water with chicken stock - absolutely delicious and should've made a double batch!  This is so good people will eat it all quick!!

To those people whom criticized this recipe definitely did not follow through the process! This is so much better than a restaurant and oh my god our home smelled so good right from the start! Best Gumbo ever!  Don't listen to those who can't follow directions, they may just be horrible cooks! My husband made this for me, I helped with prep. 
We thank you for sharing!!! We are keeping this one in our book!  Thanks again Yvonne & Jason

Wow that was awesome!!! I used vegetable oil instead of bacon fat and it worked perfectly.. Also i added extra seasonings for a bit more heat. Next time i will add the shrimp to it very last like maybe 10 to 15 minutes. Other than that i followed recipe as written and it took around 4 hours to make.. It was well worth the wait!! Will make again for sure

I think the only thing I would change is add the shrimp a couple of  minutes before serving so they are not rubbery!  Probably the crab too :)

I used this recipe to make gumbo for the first time...My husfriend absolutely loved it...He is very particular about his food and his response was "This is good as f#ck"... I did substitute the water for chicken broth...diced a pound of boneless. . Skinless  chicken breast and added a dash of cayenne. ..Thank you for sharing...I usually don't do reviews but this was warranted

This was the best gumbo it tasted just like my grandma use to make. I did change some things  first I couldn't find file powder but I think I didn't miss it. Also I used 1pd of crab legs, 1pd of chicken (I already had a whole chicken boiled) 1pd of shrimp and 1pd of hot Louisiana sausage (couldn't find andouille) and just weighed my losses on the pound of meat missing. I ended up pureeing the oni mix so it was like a smooothie. I didn't cook the sausage in the mix because I really didn't want to burn my "slushy" mix. Even with my little hiccups it still was amazing and my wife loved it.

This was good. I decided to use just sausage and chicken instead of seafood for my first go-around because I didn't want to drop $50 on seafood and mess it up. While I'm not a "chef" and I've never made gumbo before,  I do follow directions well and have made many recipes from allrecipes.com.
Two things....I spent over an hour on med-low heat to be careful not to burn the roux. Someone please tell me how you simmer veggies and sausage in a roux for 10-15 minutes with no liqui. Especially when it's imperative not to "burn" the roux. That made no sense to me, so I just mixed them well and set aside until the bullion was ready.
Also....While making the roux, I was very careful not to apply to much heat and never left it sitting, but it still omitted a burnt smell. Is this normal because of using bacon drippings? I know I didn't "burn it" per-se. 
I will make again and thank you for the recipe. Just a bit confused.

I wish I could give this 10 stars!!!! It was delicious! My family loved it. Of course I added  cyanne and some creole seasoning. And served over rice. I found the file powder at my local walmart right next to the shrimp. Didn't even need to search for it. Thank you so much for this recipe.

Really good and with a very few modification this will be a go to recipe. I would have given 5 stars but the seasonings definitely had to be amped up to achieve that authentic gumbo flavor. Also the cook time is a bit longer than it has to be.

I made this following the recipe closely to RAVE reviews!
Before adding the seafood! I refrigerated the entire cast iron Dutch oven for 1.5 hours allowing the fat to rise.  I was able to skim almost all of the fat used in the roux before reheating and adding the seafood, making this not such a dietary splurge.  Trust me, the wonderful flavor was not diminished! I also added a bit more water as it seemed somewhat thick for my taste. This was the best gumbo I have ever eaten. GREAT recipe!!!

I have never made gumbo before so I followed this recipe to the letter. OH MY This may be the best recipe I have made from allrecipes so far! Everyone in my family LOVED this! We are already talking about making it our annual New Year's Day dinner adding shredded chicken and whole crab legs like another reviewer had suggested. I ordered my file powder online and it wasn't hard to find at all. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!!

I took my time and made the roux with the bacon fat, stirring for like an hour. It was well worth it. People who don't even like seafood ate it and said this was so good! My friend from Louisiana even said it tasted good and he's picky about his gumbo. It took me forever and will only make this on very special occasions. It's also pretty expensive even though I cut the recipe in half (about $50). Made it just how it says but without the file and less Worcestershire sauce. Excellent!

This recipe is nothing short of amazing! As others have posted, I would recommend using more than 3/4 of a cup of bacon drippings when making the roux. 

We skipped simmering the veggies for 15 minutes because they were so dry after being added to the roux. 

Still came out wonderful! 

As for those saying you need to cook the roux for an hour, they must not be using cast iron pans. Ours was perfect after 30 minutes.

Love this recipe!!! My family said it's definitely a keeper! I did make a couple of changes based on personal taste. First, I omitted the salt & used a 16oz bag of okra vs 2-10oz bags (I detest okra, it's a texture thing!) & cut back the shrimp by 1lb & added 1lb of scallops. Lastly, I used 2 Tbsp of Kitchen Bouquet for added flavor. I have a friend who was born & raised in New Orleans & makes every meal from scratch.(She even grows her own veggies & herbs!) She keeps Kitchen Bouquet on hand. She says it's one of her must have ingredients to boost flavor! It's awesome over Jasmine Rice!!!

Great recipe for a first timer!  The roux is the trickiest part, not hard but time consuming so once you get that the rest comes together great!  We made this exactly like the recipe and it was great.

I have made this delicious gumbo twice, with very minor changes: beef broth instead of bouillon cubes and water, addition of about a cup of chopped rotisserie chicken, red and orange pepper instead of green, and I left all the vegetables on the coarser side vs. finely chopped. I had to add a little butter to the bacon grease in the roux since I didn't have quite enough of the grease. However, the bacon grease is extremely important for authentic flavor, so be sure not to skip it altogether. Also, have a loaf of French bread on the table so everyone can soak up every last tasty drop. Best gumbo ever!

Fantastic! Added shrimp and crab at last minute like some suggested. Didn't use file powder and supplemented butter flavored crisco when I ran out of bacon fat.  Used chicken broth and a bay leaf to cook rice like Emeril suggests for rice.

Very good! I used butter instead of bacon drippings, mainly because I'm too lazy to make bacon drippings. It worked fine. I also used chicken instead of crab, just because it sounded good and it's cheaper. Everything else I did the same and it was amazing. The shrimp and the Andouille sausage were worth the expense. They gave the gumbo a great aroma and taste. When making your roux, I highly suggest you cook it on medium low and whisk nonstop for an hour. Then whisk another 15 off the burner. Any hotter than medium low and you'll be sorry.

I've made this about 3 times & it's AMAZING. I do andouille, chicken, & shrimp instead. Follow the recipe to the tee & get your roux right & you won't regret it. I'm from Chicago but my bf is from New Orleans & he told me I should sell my gumbo is how delicious it is. Take your time making it & enjoy! Thank you a million to whomever posted this. I'm indebted!

I created an account to review this recipe. Phenomenal. This is some of the best gumbo I've ever had. Add some cayenne if you like. I threw the okra directly into the gumbo without cooking it in vinegar--I don't mind the extra thick viscosity at all.

This is a good recipe, I love spicy foods and this recipe hit the spot. The only things I did differently was used only 1/4 of bacon drippings and used Canola oil for the rest,(I like my LDL levels low) I added Cayenne pepper and only used Shrimp and Andouille sausage. I took my time with the roux and cooked it under a medium heat, saw some reviews where they burned the roux. This allowed me time to prepare the other ingredients.  It went great with rice and everyone loved it!! Thanks for sharing

This is a great recipe, make sure to take your time on the roux on medium low heat do not let it smoke, whisk until you get that deep brown color, it is crucial. I used 1 red and 1 yellow pepper and added a datil pepper in the mix and doubled up on the garlic. Serve with rice ,cornbread or straight up I used Louisiana hot sauce,Trappey's and sriracha, still not that spicy.

I made this recipe tonight for dinner and it was a hit. I had to omit the hot sauce (although I added it later to my serving) due to a family member intolerance of spicy foods. Also , I didnt have bacon grease on hand, so I substituted butter with pork flavor seasoning mixed in. I was unsure about that , but it came out wonderful!

This is the best gumbo I've ever had. I like to make large batches for guests and everyone has always been impressed. Often, they'll tell me later that they ordered gumbo at a restaurant and were disappointed because it wasn't half as good as mine. ;) When I make it, I use a couple alterations to suit my needs and tastes. Firstly, I make the roux with 1/2 cup cornstarch instead of 1 cup flour. I do this to make the recipe gluten-free, since I have Celiac disease. (Note for other Celiacs: make sure the Cajun seasoning you use is gluten-free.) If I don't have bacon drippings on hand, I substitute with butter, which is also delicious. I also always use fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned ones -- a personal preference. Other than these exceptions, I follow the recipe to a T and it's amazing! Try it; you'll be so, so glad you did.

This gumbo was fantastic! There are some ingredients in here that are a bit difficult to come by depending on your region... No bacon fat, so I fried up a few strips of bacon and used melted butter to fill in the rest of the volume. No okra, so I threw in about a half a can of Southern-Style green beans during the last 20 minutes or so of simmering. By choice I also used smoked andouille rather than fresh, and that I also threw in during the last 20 minutes or so. I stored in the refrigerator overnight and reheated the following night for a quick Mardi Gras dinner!

Best gumbo I've ever had.  Made it as is but with chicken, sausage, and shrimp.  Makes a large pot, so half the recipe if just a couple of ya or freeze the leftovers to enjoy later.  Thanks for sharing!

This was many time consuming steps, but worth every one! I was trying to duplicate a local dining rooms recipe and this was it!  Can't believe it took me so long to find this one!

I was able to cut an hour off the simmering time by cooking the okra longer in the skillet and putting it in earlier.  Don't change the rue!  Work up a sweat and just do it.  I make a stock with turkey carcass or ham bone then put the shrimp shells in there.  Kicks it up a notch.  Substitute stock for water but still add beef bouillon.  Don't forget to make rice and serve with French Bread.

We have made this several times and love it. I boil a chicken, then use the broth instead of bouillon and shredded chicken in place of crab meat since we are not crab fans. Otherwise, we make it as directed. Love!

This is a fantastic recipe but it is a bit time consuming, so I changed the cooking method to make it quicker since I am extremely busy!  I made the roux until it was light caremel color, then added some beef broth, garlic onions and seasonings.  You keep wisking continously until you have a thick looking gravy.  I poured the mixture in the crockpot and added more liquid and the rest of the ingredients.  I used hot smoked sausage and whole skinless/bonelss chicken breasts uncooked.  I cooked it for about 4 hours on high, removed the chicken breasts and shredded the chicken, and added it back to the pot.  I could not find file powder but used the rest of the spices listed.  It was excellent!  I cut the recipe in half and filled a 6 qt crockpot to the top!  Everyone raved about it and it did nto take too long to make.  Note: Don't skimp on the roux, you have to make the roux on the stove top then you can add to crockpot.  It only took about 15 minutes to make the roux. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is the BOMB!  I did not pre-cook the okra, did not add crabmeat or file.  Added a cup of white wine to the recipe and it was out of this world.  I have found THE gumbo recipe!  Thank you!

5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!! This was absolutely delicious and even better the second day after the flavors had more time to meld.  The roux turned out perfect and took 27 minutes to prepare.  I followed the recipe exactly and don't think I would change a thing. Thank you dailyrecipedoctor for sharing a family secret.  This has become a fav for my family.

This was my first attempt at making gumbo, everyone I asked was too scared to make it. Let me say, IT WAS AMAZING. The hardest part was making the roux. You have to really keep whisking almost 50 mins to 1 hour. My roux was really "tight" at first so I kept adding butter until it was the right (creamy) consistency. I only used one bag of frozen okra and added a whole lot more tobacco and Cajun seasoning (to taste). It's worth the time, money, and effort to have the right ingredients so don't try and skimp on the sausage or file powder! Give the recipe a try, you'll love it!

This might be the best thing I've ever eaten.  Definitely worth the care and time to create it.  The only thing I do differently is instead of bacon drippings I use vegetable oil.  Turns out fabulous! Thanks for sharing this.

Good Gumbo recipe. My husband loved it. I halved the recipe since it's just the two of us. Since the ingredient list is extensive and expensive to buy in one trip to the grocery store, I bought a few things on each shopping trip over the course of a few weeks. Thank you for the recipe, I will make it again.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!! This is why I love love love allrecipes because there is no way I would have know how to cook gumbo this good. It comes out with the perfect amount of smoky, spicy, deliciousness. With the exception of being able to use butter instead on bacon grease, follow the recipe to the T the first time you make it. THEN see if you want to tweak anything to your family liking. Trust me ya won't be disappointed. Next time I make mine, I think I will leave out the salt and tabasco until the very end because the sausage I used was quite spicy on it's own. But my DH adored this and I'm eating a bowl now so, no complaints. Also, use the andouille sausages, they are a MUST! Thank you so much for sharing your family recipe, it will be a staple recipe of mine forever now!

Great recipe with the roux from scratch! I used half the bacon drippings and added the canola oil to compensate. Turned out great! Making my second one tonight with crawfish and some crabs we brought back from Maryland!

I made this for the first time for a big crawfish boil that I was hosting.  We didn't change a thing.  Our party guests loved it.  Many said it was the best gumbo they had ever eaten.  Others, who were hesitant due to their fears of seafood and/or spicy foods, eventually did and also loved it.

I tried this recipe last night, it was definitely a success. I usually like a more of a seasoned taste, but it was still ideal for a various group of people (diabetics included). I did turn up the heat to cook it a little faster & I used crab-legs, but this is a great recipe. Its was soooo much better the next day.

Amazing! Thanks so much for sharing your family's recipe! The roux did take me closer to an hour to make but perhaps I didn't have the heat high enough in fear of burning it, as it was my first roux.

I'm making this for my daughter and son-in-law when they come visit, she went to culinary school, he is a chef at a french bistro, I have no doubt that I will impress them both.  Everyone should try this with a dollop of potato salad...for some reason, the combination works.  Thanks for sharing your family's recipe.  It's really great!

My whole family loved it. Not too spicy for me and easily spiced up with extra Cajun seasoning & hot sauce for my son and hubby who love it hot! The only changes I made were to add chicken and omit gumbo file powder because I could not find it at my local grocer. Thank you so much!

I'm from North LA but lived in South LA for over 5 years. I will definately use this recipe again...Add some potato salad to serve it over and voila! Perfect gumbo. Reminds me of Lafayette. Good job!!

Man, this was fan-freaking-tastic. I used chicken in mine (put it in at the same time as the sausage.) Definitely spicy, which is the way I like it, but you may want to reduce the Tobasco or use milder sausage if that's not your thing. Pardon me while I roll myself down the hall, I'm completely stuffed from devouring this.

I have made this gumbo once a year every year since I discovered a few years ago.  Everyone that has ever tried it absolutely loves it, and they look forward to the day when I make it..  Amazing recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this recipe exactly as it reads, except I used fresh herbs from my garden, and I had to make without "filer" because I couldn't find any. It came out absolutely delicous! I gave some to some friends of mine, and now they want the recipe too. It is labor intensive, at least to this sixty-six year old, anyway. However, it sure is worth the effort. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I put mine over white rice, perfect combo!

I made this but without seafood. Just chicken and sausage. Boiled a whole chicken (cut into parts) in 12 cups of liquid, but of that 1 bottle of sauvignon black was the liquid. Added orange and yellow bell peppers to the liquid and garlic and salt along with the bay leaves. Boiled until done. Used the liquid from the chicken in the gumbo recipe. It turned out great.

This is the real deal here. A few notes: 

to save on time I was told you can buy the roux depending on your area. 

Most people don't have bacon drippings just laying around the kitchen. I did fry bacon to get the juice but I didn't have enough bacon and ended up using chicken broth to cover the rest (1/4 c).

I wanted my gumbo to be a little spicer than what the recipes calles for. So I added 3 T of the Cajun seasoning blend and 4T of hot sauce. Now this was hot enough to make you warm but not hot enough to make you sweat.

I've made this recipe twice now. The 1st time I followed it exactly (minus the gumbo-file because I couldn't find any). And the 2nd time I threw everything together after making the roux because I was in a rush. It was delicious both times! Serve it with cornbread on the side. Mmmmm! :)

I've been in search for a great gumbo recipe and this is IT! We gobbled this up and i wished i had made more. I added a little clam juice and left out the salt, but it would have been just as excellent without that.

The is the absoluely best Gumbo I've ever had!  I love Gumbo and order it in restaurants quite frequently.  This recipe definitely tops any restaurant Gumbo I've ordered.  There's plenty of meat and a rich, delicious flavor.  I substituted the crab with chicken because a local restauranteur serves it with chicken instead of crab and it's quite good.  It turned out superb with the chicken!  I grilled three chicken breasts, chopped them up and threw them into the roux with the sausage to soak up the flavor...besides that, I refuse to cook with immitation crab and let's face it...crab's not getting any cheaper these days.  An amazing recipe well worth the effort!

This gumbo is fantastic!!! I made a few mods: replaced beef broth with homemade shrimp stock and left out the crab. The spice level was perfect to a bit spicy for my taste buds. I will definitely make this again.

Loved it!!  Started with the bacon grease but added a little butter to make 3/4 cup, also used butter to cook okra.  (Used frozen).  Used 1.5# of shrimp & 2# of scallops.  Could use anything, any seafood, this recipe tasted amazing. Otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Hang in there to get the roux just right.  Took me closer to 30 minutes & started with hot bacon grease.Thank you for sharing!!!

I was so excited about how the gumbo  turned out for me.  
I decided on this recipe after searching for more than a week because of the reviews. 
I am not a gumbo eater but the flavor seemed good and the people that I prepared for; loved it!
The roux took about 50 min to brown. I added Chicken and crab claws to my gumbo.
I would highly recommend this recipe and so happy that it was shared.

Delicious! Used more Cajun spice and Tabasco, personal preference. Also used beef broth instead of water/bouillon. Time consuming to make but worth it. Thanks for sharing this family recipe.

We follow the recipe as is and it was exquisite. We love Gumbo and this is as authentic in flavor as the ones we have had while in New Orleans.  Delicious!

I have made this recipe many times over the last several years & it never disappoints!  This gumbo is so good that my family won't even have rice with the first serving - all they want is to devour the soup as soon as it's ready!

I will advise everyone to NOT skip the last set of instructions on the okra as this will cook out the slime before adding to the soup.

After making this exactly as written several times, I began to modify it for my family's tastes.  I go heavy on the seafood & sausage while going light on the okra.  I also substitute homemade shrimp stock in place of the beef bouillon & water.  I wish I had photos to post, but it disappears too quickly!

So good!  I didn't have gumbo file powder so I mixed two tsp of corn starch with 2 tsp of root beer.  Sounds crazy but it worked.  I looked into substitutions for it and corn starch can be used but it didn't have the "root beer" flavor.

Being a northern girl I don’t know what authentic gumbo should taste like. I can say for sure that this is absolutely delicious. The roux seemed intimidating but it was kind of like a work of art watching it progress. 
This recipe is a keeper!!

This took almost all day to make, as the roux takes about 2 hours instead of 20-30 minutes to get it that dark brown color without burning it.  I took another reviewers advice & did it in the oven, which worked well.  The finished product was definitely worth the hours spent to make it, however!  I used crawfish tales instead of lump crab & added a bit more Tabasco & Cajun seasoning, but other than that, I stuck to the recipe.  It had great flavor & my family loved it.  Thank you for sharing your mom & grandma’s recipe!!

This is my 3rd time making this for New Year's Eve!  Everyone loves it.  I think this time tastes the best...even though I cheated a little and used the frozen cajun veggies (celery, onions and bell peppers) from Kroger.  I also put some Old Bay on my shrimp and let it marinate until I was ready to put it in the gumbo.  Superb!! Happy New Year!!!

very good.  I dont know if the sugar really makes a difference but I added it just because the recipe called fir it.  Add water a little at a time until its the consistency that you like.  I didnt use quite 3 qts.  Will make again.

THIS is incredible. I made it for a Christmas Eve dinner and the crowd went wild. So incredibly worth the wild whisking effort and time. I used butter instead of bacon fat and forgot to add the last two teaspoons of File and it was still something  I will be thinking about for years to come. DEFINITELY added to the best of.

I have made this gumbo about half a dozen times now for my daughter over the past two years and she absolutely loves it.  She loves it so much so that she has actually requested that I make it this year for Christmas Day when she comes to my house.  I follow the recipe religiously only deviating by adding scallops and oysters (Chesapeake Bay oysters).  I always make this with file powder (sassafras) which I can only find locally at Harris Teeter (here in Central Virginia).  My daughter and I are Virginia natives but we have adopted this gumbo recipe as a family favorite.

While this recipe might look complicated on paper, it is actually very simple if you assemble your things ahead of time.  Other than making the roux, everything else cooks on it's own... my family comes from Louisiana so they know what good Gumbo is.  Their unanimous decision is this dish tops any that they have been making all their lives!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.

I made this gumbo a few times and it is wonderful!  One time I substituted some chicken andouille sausage for the pork andouille...Don't do that!  I found that the pork adds so much more flavor.  Great recipe.

Being from the bayou,  living in cajun country most of my life.  I moved to another state a couple years ago. I wanted to make a gumbo, like what I was raised on. Depending on where you live some ingredients may be hard to come by, or a bit pricey. Believe me I had to get family to send some from Louisiana to me. But this recipe is spot on.

Yep, 70 minutes for the roux is right almost to the minute. Use at least an 8 quart stock pot to fit everything. I used canned crab (claw meat) that I found in the refrigerated seafood section at an asian market. Delicious.

This was so flavorful. I wish I could figure out how to make the shrimp more tender but don't think that'll ever be possible in a stew. Took pretty much the whole afternoon to cook, and I'm sure  the flavors will be better tomorrow!

Ive made this recipe 3 times now, currently simmering on the stove, and it is my family's favorite. I can never get the roux dark enough even after stirring for over an hour but i get it a nice light skinned brown which is good enough for me. I add day old roasted chicken instead of crab meat but other than that i follow the recipe. I live in the midwest and never have had the priviledge of eating some good down south cooking so this will have to do for now. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

It does take a while but it's soooo good! Didn't have crab meat but just added a bit more sausage and shrimp. Would be great, I think, with any meat you had on hand. Will definitely make again.

I had a bunch of okra from the farmers market and came across this recipe. We're vegetarian, so I used veggie broth and vegetarian sausages. I also used Alton Brown's method of oven roux, which turned out a deep, dark brown. This was so delicious. Thank you!

Super tasty. Beware though, I cut the ingredients in half and still ended up with a big 6 quart pot full.  I couldn't find gumbo filet so I substituted corn starch and water and added More Spice creole seasoning..  I'll make this again.

Delicious!!!  I substituted chicken for the crab due to availability and loved it. My husband,  who never eats the same thing two days in a row, gobbled this up 3 nights straight.

while I am from the South, this is my first time making gumbo! The roux did take about 45 min to get that deep dark color, I nursed it on high simmer in my Instant Pot; once I realized I was over doing the baby sitting and realized I could prep the rest of the ingredients while the roux was going it made life a lot easier. definitely will make again 110%! family loved it! I browned the meat separately and added it once the broth was incorporated into the roux and had simmered for a moment. The smells are wonderful! The spice is amazing, thank you for sharing and Thank You and a high Thanks to your Mother and Grandmother. 
I would like to say one thing, sure family recipes are supposed to stay in the family, but sharing the love is always appreciated. My Grandfather was a baker, really well known in the community and he refused to write down anything. When he passed everything was lost, and it broke our hearts. Your recipe will be cherished in my family.

I am from New Orleans. And I’m ashamed to say the money that I have wasted over the years trying to make a good seafood gumbo. Not this time!! This is the real deal. As good as I’ve gotten in New Orleans restaurants. It’s a lifetime keeper

Ive made this five times now. 1st time, followed the directions to a T. Did some research on roux's and started making it with a dark chocolate colored roux and wont go back. Added meats of different varieties, little bit more of this, little less of that but always stayed pretty true to this recipe. Once I thought I had it how I like it, made some for a work function and it was gone in minutes! Good recipe. Thank you for posting.

Edit: My sister told me: "Someone made gumbo for work. I took one bite and said, this isn't as good as my brother's." And there you have it!

WARNING! Eat this on day two. I was extremely disappointed with this recipe on day one. I didn't understand how it received such great reviews however, I refused to toss it because I spent money on shrimp and crab. I made us eat this for lunch on day 2 and OMG, completely different gumbo. the flavors were amazing! Thank you so much.  I will make individual serving bags for days I don't feel like cooking.

Super cold and rainy today combined with the craving for something comforting led me to this recipe. Followed the steps/ingredients almost exactly with the exception of using some butter for the roux (I didn’t have quite enough bacon fat) and subbing chicken for the crab meat. It took some time, but it was totally worth the effort!

This is one of the best gumbo's I have ever tried. The recipe is so simple and thorough that it can make any beginner in gumbo making an immediate pro. It is a little spicy for my kiddos, so I'll be reducing the hot pepper sauce a little next time. All in all though... Ooooueeee was it good!

I will definitely make this again.  Minor changes were just for dietary considerations. . . my son can't eat pork so I used a beef sausage instead of the traditional andouille but added some smoky paprika to compensate.  And I didn't add any additional salt. . . it was perfect without  it.   I used Alton Brown's roux method   so much more reliable   And I want to comment on the Okra.  Usually I push it around the plate and give it to my dogs.   but cooking it  separately and in the vinegar completely changed the taste and texture!  Dogs didn't get any!  Delicious!

My boyfriend requested this. I had never tried gumbo before and definitely hadn’t made it. He said it was the best he’d had before and I think it was delicious. I didn’t have the file powder and it still turned out phenomenal!!

Just the recipe I was looking for! Wanted a tasty gumbo recipe so I gave this a try. Since I wanted to make it low carb, I ended up using xantham gum as a thickener instead of making a roux: sautéed the veggies and sausage and sprinkled with xantham gum during that step. Other than that and using cauliflower “rice,” I made the recipe exactly as written. It was so delicious!

I'm giving 4 stars because I left out shrimp and added chicken. I also did not use file because it's not available in area. This is very similar to cajun gumbo recipe so I know is going to be good!

This recipe is ridiculously good. I used shredded chicken breast instead of crab meat. The base is so good I’m pretty sure you could do anything with the protein. Thank you for sharing.

Used Italian sausage (I know, I know)  to keep it mild for the kiddies.  Excellent recipe! There were many happy faces around the table.  I added frozen cleaned crawfish tails for a little something extra.   Next time I will try to find some andouille and compare.

Made southern gumbo for years. Like others never used tomatoes or tomato sauce and Worcestershire. But wanted to try a different version.  DELICIOUS! My husband said it's a keeper.

Made it for my husband for Father’s day. He loves seafood and I don’t. I have never eaten seafood. Not even fish sticks. He was so happy and mentioned its the best gumbo he has ever eaten. I followed the recipe as is because I did not plan on tasting it. He really can’t stop raving about it.. He loved it very much. Thank your sharing your recipe!

Delicious, we barely had leftovers. I made the roux in the oven with a whisk from flour and grapeseed oil. Used chicken breast, sausage and shrimp. The crab was costly, so I left it out.

I will definitely will make this again. I added frozen pack of seafood-mussels, shrimp, scallops, calamari. I also bought fresh crab legs and put the crab in. Added a can of amber beer.  My roux turned out great which makes a good foundation for gumbo. Your family recipe is awesome and I would let you adopt me at dinner time any time.  Thank you, Kathie

This is an awesome gumbo recipe!  Mine turned out wonderfully, reminding me of some really great gumbos I've had in that region.  As everyone is saying, making the roux is a process you don't want to rush or stray away from.  Mine took close to 30 minutes.  The color went from "is this ever going to turn dark?" to "Holy smokes, I'm about to ruin this." in about 30 seconds.  My only changes to the recipe were to use thawed frozen shrimp and to omit the lump crab which was too expensive and only available canned where I live.  For those who complained about the andouille dominating the flavor of the gumbo, I think that a change of brand would fix that problem as I didn't see that as an issue with the sausage I used.   I will definitely make this gumbo again!  Thank you  for sharing your family's recipe.

My husband LOVED this gumbo recipe.  I "Keto-ized" it--almond flour instead of regular flour, and no sugar.  Left out the okra--darn it!! Because my husband does not like it.  I added xanthan gum to thicken a little at the end.  We ate it as a soup and not over rice.  Even my lower carb version was AWSOME! Thank you dailyrecipedoctor!

I made this for part of the Easter Dinner. It went over really good for my first time. It all starts with the Bacon Drippings and patience to make a good roux...the base that all other ingredients are built on!

I thought the reviews were too good to be true until I made it.  My family RAVED about this gumbo.  As suggested by others, I cooked the roux in the oven and used 1/2 chicken stock and 1/2 water. I added scallops and white fish when I put in the shrimp and crabmeat and cooked the seafood for only about  5-7 minutes. Again, this is a winner. Thanks for posting.

Great recipe.  It's my first time eating a gumbo like this.  4 stars because I have nothing to compare it to.  Flavor was good but it did not blow me away.

Loved it! I made mine with two slight variations. First, I used three shredded baked chicken breasts  in place of the crab meat, and secondly, used 1 lb. of crawdads and 2 lbs. of shrimp. It turned out beautifully. Next time I'm going to try using duck fat in place of bacon drippings. Fingers crossed.

Made exactly to recipe. Used twice the base amount of cajun and Tabasco because we like spicy food around here. It was absolutely perfect. Before you go changing the ingredients, try it exact once. You won't be disappointed. My one critique is that, like many others, my roux took MUCH longer than the recipe stated. About 75 minutes. But cooking times vary between stove tops and levels of experience, so who knows.

This was phenomenal! Only changes made were due to not having bacon grease. Used butter for the roux and cooked the okra in olive oil instead. B/f scarfed it down and said I had outdone myself.

My husband and his family are from Louisiana & I love their cooking. I try to have a Mardi Gras dinner every yr for them & this gumbo recipe was a hit!
I added chicken & crawfish, instead of crabmeat and it was still delicious. I served it w cornbread, corn on the cob, sweet tea & kings cake.
Couldn’t find any gumbo file seasoning here, but next year I will be more prepared thanks to Amazon.
Thank you for sharing this recipe! Maybe someday I’ll have to post some of my mother in laws recipes too, but it’s the same problem you have with most family recipes: a pinch of this a dash of that lol

I’ve made this twice now, first time, I had to fudge a few items but it was still great.  This time I did it to the letter and let me tell you, this is an awesome recipe.  My husband and I are big on pleasing the taste buds and this one does it.  Plus it’s authentic.  :). Enjoy!!

This was perfect. This method of making gumbo works perfectly and taste exactly like what I grew up with in New Orleans. This is as authentic as it gets. Thanks for sharing.

Tasted amazing.  I could not find file powder, substituted cornstarch dissolved in root beer and could not tell a difference.  Did add in some boiled chicken and used the broth instead of the water.  Five stars from everyone!

I live in Louisiana all my life and I hate the food here, but I did love this recipe. I just added beef sausages and left out the crab and okra while doubling the amount of the shrimps. It was so good that way.

This was a great basic (yet tasty) gumbo recipe. I was born and raised here in Louisiana, so I grew up without the measurements and without a real recipe, so I thought I’d give this one a try. I didn’t have crab meat or 3 pounds of shrimp, so I did a 12-oz bag of medium shrimp, 2.5 pounds of chicken thighs, and 1 pound of andouille. I also only added half of the filé because I know not everyone loves it, so people could add the rest to taste as they are. I thought the recipe was great, just maybe a bit more Tony’s. If you choose to do it the way I did, I added the raw chicken (cut up) when I added the sausage and let it simmer with the sausage. Breast meat would get dry and tough, so be careful. I added the shrimp about 15 minutes before it was done so they didn’t get rubbery and they were perfect. Tasted great!

It might be helpful to be mentioned, butter can be substituted for bacon fat, but should you choose to use butter the roux will not darken.  Great recipe, thank you!!

Turned out great!  First time making gumbo.  I live in California, but have been to New Orleans, and have had some fantastic gumbo there.  I made this recipe nearly exactly as stated in the recipe*.

i made this gumbo this morning, and first taste, I was impressed, so I invited some friends over to try it while watching the superbowl.  Everyone loved it.  Even the little kids couldn't get enough of it!  It was certainly a hit, and I will definitely be making it again!  This one is saved as a favorite for sure! 

Some even commented that this is the best gumbo they've had outside of New Orleans!   So glad i stumbled on this recipe! 

*changes made: 
I used homemade cajun seasoning.
I replaced half of the bacon drippings with butter, since i didn't have enough bacon drippings.
I didn't add crab meat.
Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

Amazing. I added some partial bags of frozen veggies that I had accumulated with okra. I did not cook the extra vegetables before adding and it was perfect. The sweet corn was an amazing balance to the spicy nature.

This was the recipe I used to make my first gumbo. I brought some to my friend from New Orleans who is an amazing cajun cook, and asked for a critique.  She loved it as much as I did. If I could give it 6 stars I would.  I keep some frozen at all times for those days I dont have hours to spend in the kitchen. At my husband's request I add smoked sausage and  corn.

I like everything about this recipe except that it was too soupy. I only omitted the okra so I'm not sure if this perhaps had something to do with it or not. Even when I refrigerated it, the next day it was still soupy. However, the taste was really good!

Delicious gumbo!  Only a few changes:  I only had 2 Tbl. of bacon grease, so I used it for frying the okra and I used butter for the roux.  I used canned crab instead of lump because I'm cheap.  I only had 2 pounds of shrimp on hand, so I added a pound of chicken.  Rave reviews by all!

Will def make it again. Even though it's a bit time consuming, its very much worth it. I didn't have any Gumbo File powder and couldn't find it at any of our markets. Regardless it still turned out amazing.  Quickly ordered some File Powder so when I do remake this its fully legit.

I played around with the proteins. We roasted a chicken a couple days before making this, so I made a nice chicken stock from the leftover carcass.  We used the leftover meat from the roasted chicken rather than crab meat.  We also used fresh chicken stock + the Beef Bullion stock. About 50/50. The flavor was exceptional.  My wife doesn't care much for Okra, so I kinda halved that portion of the recipe. Added it for the flavor, and kept the rest of the cooked Okra and spooned it in myself to my liking.  We also added the shrimp, which was just great. Can't wait to try some leftovers tonight. I'm sure the flavors have melted together even more.

I'd say, however you modify this, don't skip the bacon fat as your cooking oil. That Roux was the star of the show. Enjoy.

I've never made gumbo before and I searched for an authentic recipe. Found this and tried it based on the reviews. It was absolutely delicious and tasted like Lousiana in a bowl! My family loved it and we all indulged in seconds. I followed the recipe to the T, and served with white rice and biscuits. Thank you for sharing!

This is definitely a 5 star recipe. Thought about knocking off a star because the roux needs to cook WAY longer than the recipe suggests, more like 2-3 hours, but it tasted so good I have to give it a 5. I made the roux the night before and refrigerated it, really helped on the timing. The taste was perfect. Had to substitute smoked chicken for the lump crab and catfish for the shrimp. Horribly unfortunate shellfish allergy these days. But even with the changes everyone absolutely loved it.

I used grape seed oil instead of bacon drippings, because I don’t save my bacon drippings.  (I should).  I also cooked the shrimp separately with crab boil.  I saved the shrimp and crab boil stock and used that as my base.  I didn’t use tomato paste, but I did use rotel stewed tomatoes. I slow cooked it all night then added the crab and shrimp the next day and cooked a little longer. I I also used a half and half andouille and hickory smoked sausage. I was extremely happy with the results.

Amazing. Very easy to follow. Time consuming but worth it

 I made a few changes for myself, using chicken breast instead of crab meat (I sauteed it in the pan just after removing the roux mixture) and used homemade seafood stock in place of the water/bouillon. 

I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find filé locally but I got it at Fresh Market. It's really worth grabbing some even if you only make gumbo once in a while.

Growing up in Houston and frequently in New Orleans affords one gumbo made by various N’awlins big mamas and will render anyone a gumbo snob. This was my first time making gumbo and it was a hit!  The roux is the most important part and reviewers suggested AB’s oven roux. After years of successful Good Eats recipes I trust Alton explicitly and tried the roux his way. O. M. G. Yaaasss! I made the roux in my cast iron pot in the oven and it was a deep caramel cover like big mamas sans stirring oneself into carpal tunnel syndrome. Also, added more shrimp flavor to the stock by adding dried shrimp. I did add a variety of Cajun seasoning when it was done to suit my taste but the recipe as written is good. Thank you for sharing!

Wow! Thank you for the recipe! This is the real deal!! I cooked the roux longer (almost an hour) until chocolate brown... will smell like burnt popcorn.. this is a good thing. I tripled the Louisiana because we like it spicy, and added a bit of cayenne. This recipe is perfection!

This is just about the perfect recipe to start with.  I serve it with Tony's, cayenne, and hot sauce available on the table.  I'll usually add a dash of cayenne to my bowl.  Everyone who's tried it says it's the best gumbo they've ever had.

I created an account just to review this gumbo recipe. My husband rediscovered his love for gumbo on a recent trip to NOLA and I promised I'd make it for him this winter. It was my first time making it and I followed this recipe exactly. It. was. so. good. I cook a lot and I can honestly say this is one of my favorite things I've ever made. Will definitely be making again.

I’ve always been intimidated by making gumbo but decided to finally give it a try. This recipe is so easy to follow! It’s just two adults and one toddler so I cut the measurements in half and it worked out perfectly. I also added drumsticks to my dish. The gumbo was well balanced with flavor, my husband loved it! Thanks for sharing.

I like to make this recipe new years day! I make a milder version with 1/4 tsp of Cajun seasoning and  just a couple shakes of Tabasco sauce . I also like add some cubed chicken a pre cook in some butter and a  dash of Cajun seasoning. I add it when the okra goes in. It is definitely a favorite in my household with my family. Happy New Year!

This is the real deal. We moved to SE Louisiana when I was a kid and I had gumbo many times. Moving their from out of state, we never had a "family recipe," but just enjoyed what everyone else made. Later in my adult life when I went searching for a good recipe I found this one. I've tried others, but this one is the one that brings back memories and tastes as authentic as you can get. Don't hesitate to give this one a try!

We cheaped out and bought cans of "fancy" crab meat, which dispersed itself into the broth, and once all the shrimp and sausage were taken out through the multiple days worth of going back for leftovers, we were left with a delicious crab broth soup. But, next time we will get real crab chunks! DELICIOUS, and time-consuming, but SO worth it!

I followed the recipe except for the Gumbo File powder. I could not find this in the 4 grocery stores nearby. This is a winner! First time gumbo cook, it was delicious. I served it over brown rice cooked in beef broth, with jalapeño cheddar cheese cornbread on the side. This will be a family get together favorite! I can’t wait to make this at the beach.

Very time consuming but worth it.
Rick Deep Flavors, Delicious.


Adjustments made
Used Duck Fat as I did not have Bacon Fat - worked well
Used 1.5 Onion, Green Pepper and 1.5 Cups Celery as opposed to 1 each
Used 4 Cloves of Garlic as opposed to 2
Used only 2 quarts of Broth and it was nice and thick - 3 Cups would be very watery in my opinion
Used Beef Bone Broth as opposed to Cubes
Used 1.5 lbs Sausage as opposed to 1 lb - great move
Used Strained 100% tomatoes
Crab Meat - used the 1 lb but next time will only use 1/2 lb. The crab was far too pronounced at 1 lb.
Final Cooking stage - after placing Shrimp and Crab anly cooked for 25 Minutes so as not to overcook them. Using only 2 quarts as opposed to three alowed for quicker thickening with lower cook time.

Will absolutely make again

This is a great recipe!  I did opt for the unsalted Swanson's chicken broth instead of the water.  I also added 3 blue crabs and 2 clusters of snow crabs instead of the lump crabmeat.  However, I have made this before with just the crabmeat, but being from the south, my family expects to see and likes to 1 crack crab claws and legs when they eat gumbo.  Lastly, I added the 2 tablespoons of  McCormick's Vegetable seasoning so I didn't have to use too much salt. I will add photos soon.

Taste great! Followed the directions best I could. Used fresh Thyme instead of dry and chicken broth in place of the water. Served on rice with File powder and Tabasco sauce  on the side. Will be making this many more times, but in a bigger pot next time as it filled my 6 quart dutch over to the the brim. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

This is definitely a delicious, spicy, flavorful gumbo, reminding me of my roots in PA, Texas! The bay  & thyme leaves takes it to a whole other level! I love the aroma that fills the house while this cooks all day- soul food. I will be making this again!

I made it with chicken thighs vs shrimp and it was a hit. I boiled the chicken in the water and used the same water for the gumbo.

Yes,  I used avocado oil instead of bacon drippings as I didn’t have any on hand, and also less gumbo file as I ran out.  I’ve used this recipe before and changed the meats as well.  I’ve substituted boneless, skinless chicken breast and ground duck for the shrimp.  It’s a great base recipe and easy to add different proteins.

Expensive but you get what you pay for. My neighbors liked it so much that they are pitching in money for me to make it again. It’s so good, it’s addictive.

It was very good. I stead of okra, I added gumbo vegetables (my hubby is diabetic and don't do rice or salt ).  It was delicious and still thick enough to add over rice as well. (I usually I add  Alaskan and king crab legs and cut lobster tails. )

I absolutely loved this recipe!!! I tried using the cast iron skillet with  1/2 cup of vegetable oil  and 1 cup of flour to make the roux and placed in the oven on 350 degrees for an hour and a half and it turned out GREAT!!! Every other part of the recipe I followed and this was the best gumbo I've  EVER HAD!! My husband and best friend loved it! I will definitely use this recipe EVERY time I cook gumbo!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

Time-consuming, but worth every minute! The only major change I made was to add about 4 chicken breasts, cooked and shredded, in place of the seafood for a chicken and sausage gumbo. This has replaced the recipe I've been using for the past 15 years...it has such a deep, rich flavor, and it makes a HUGE pot. Absolutely delicious!

Made this as is - quite tasty!  Might try a mix of butter and bacon fat next time ... felt just a little greasy at times, but otherwise I would make it again.  Also switched the meats - used 2 lbs shrimp, 2 lbs chicken, and 1 lb andouille.

I made this as written with one exception. I substituted bacon drippings for butter. The flavor was right on, and it tasted even better the next day.  I loved it except for a couple of small things - mostly personal taste: 
1) I thought it was too liquidy. I prefer thicker gumbo. So I   thickened it a bit more with corn starch. Next time, I'll up the flour a bit and  2) I also prefer more coarsely chopped onion, celery etc. and more okra so next time I'll skip the step with the food processor and add more okra and see how it'll come out. Overall, the dish had a great flavor and was very good.  Thanks for sharing.

This is, BY FAR, the BEST gumbo I've ever made.  OMG it's sooooooo good.  I should have used my HUGE soup pot because my large stove pot was filled to the brim and nearly running over.  I added double the garlic and Creole spice, some extra cayenne, and a little Accent because my husband likes things garlicky and spicy.  I used 1 pound of sausage, 1 pound of crab meat, 1.5 pounds of chicken, and 1/2 pound of shrimp because that's what I had on hand.  I'll definitely be saving this to hand down to my kids and grandkids.  Wow!  Just Wow!

Loved this recipe. It was a labor of love but at the end it was a perfect gumbo. I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great. I would recommend a little more hot sauce.

My son said it was "better than good".  It was my first dish of this nature but the video helped a great deal.  I didn't have the bacon grease but substituted with butter.  I am going to start saving baking grease because if this was this good with butter, I can't wait to taste it with the bacon drippings.  Also, I couldn't find the Gumbo seasoning so I used creole seasoning and it still came out great. Will make again.

I usually cheat when it comes to gumbo and use prepackaged mixes that are no where near authentic. My family raves about this recipe. My husband travels to Louisiana frequently for work and said it’s one of the best gumbos he’s tried.

I made this for my husband who is a huge fan of Cajun and Creole foods.  He raved about it and even my son who has a very limited palate (he doesn’t like anything) enjoyed it and asked to take a container to work for dinner tomorrow.
I didn't have bacon grease so I used butter like several other recipes suggested.  It took at least an hour to get the roux a good peanut butter color.  I followed the recipes except that my husband asked me not to make it too spicy so i cut the Tabasco down to 1 T. and I also shredded a roasted chicken and added that to the gumbo.  This recipe is a definite keeper and the recipe I will use whenever my husband gets a craving for some gumbo.  Thanks you for this recipe.

This was wonderful! The only change I made was making it without the celery and the crab meat. I know, I know...You can't make anything cajun/creole without the holy "trinity" but I just was not going to the grocery store one more time this week. So, I risked it, and it still turned out amazing. 

Great recipe! Will be making again and again.

This is a great recipe. I added 3 small boneless skinless chicken thighs that I seasoned with Tony's and boiled in 3.5 quarts of water along with the beef bouillon. I also accidentally used 6oz can of tomato PASTE instead of sauce so it was a bit  on the tomato-y side, and that masked alot of the roux flavor and color so I called it a "stew" to cover up my mistake. Lol....there was none leftover so I guess that went over well! Can't wait to try it again the correct way!

I made this with a gluten free roux (I used coconut flour) Although it tasted great, the coconut was a bit gritty. I'd use rice flour like others have said in the future. (its what I had in the cupboard) However, over rice you couldn't tell and it was absolutely delicious. I used red bell pepper instead of green and added lightly browned chicken breast tenders instead of crab meat. Also added the shrimp shells in the broth in a bag that I could easily grab out and toss. So so so so so SO flavorful!!!

This is my favorite gumbo recipe! I like the finely diced holy trinity : the bacon grease, sugar are two ingredients that set this recipe apart from many others !!!

I was a little short on shrimp. It needed more. Little too thin for me. Leave out some water next time. Tasted great

This was amazing!!!! The only thing I did different is added more gumbo file powder. I halved the recipe and it made plenty for my teenage son and myself. Takes some time,but worth it.

Just wanted to add that when making this I threw in some crawfish which made it divine! Not that this recipe isn’t already to die for, and it certainly doesn’t require one single adjustment! Fantastic recipe.

I am not a huge fan of gumbo, but my husband loves it.  So naturally I have to make the best.  Boy did this deliver.  I really liked the oven roux, but in Vegas it gets to hot for ovens.  I found a pre-made roux and it worked out great.  I did chicken, shrimp and sausage lot of fresh veggies and beef stock.  This is now my favorite to impressing the guests.

It was delicious!!! Made double recipe so I could freeze some for lazy days. I am so glad this recipe has you make your own roux because it was impossible to find here in Alabama. Finding file was a challenge too but I did find some. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!!!

I added 2 chicken breasts with the sausage.  It all barely fit in a 12qt Dutch oven. I made sure to boil off a decent amount of water in the first hour and was worried it all wouldn't  fit.  3 lb of shrimp is a  lot!  I doubled the Cajun powder. It ended up lightly spicy, but also a little sweeter than any gumbo I've ever had. Maybe the crab meat?  I'm super happy about it. It took me about 5 hrs, but I'm a hack at cooking.  Thanks for the recipe!  Also,it cost me $100 for the ingredients.  I couldn't find gumbo file, but read you can substitute root beer for some of the water. I put in 3 12oz root beers in place of 36 oz of the water. Maybe that's where the sweetness came in...??

Don't screw around!  This is your Gumbo recipe.  I made as specified and had a Louisiana  native tell me this is the best Gumbo ever.  Don't skim on the meats,  add pheasant instead of chicken.  Get ready to impress!

I could hug you! I've been cooking for 40 plus years and always wanted to learn how to cook gumbo, but was also very intimidated by it! We travel to Louisiana at least once a year on what we call an eating tour...I LOVE creole/Cajun food. I make a 'stand up and shout' jambalaya and figured if I was ever going to learn, now is the time. 

I made this for dinner tonight, doubling everything since I was cooking for 10. Let me tell you, the house smelled so good, I had to practically post a guard at the door to keep everyone from flocking in. Lol. 

Come time to eat, the only sound I heard coming from the table was the clicking of spoons and "Mmmm".


Five stars and 10 thumbs up!

I made the roux from butter instead of bacon grease.

Fantastic recipe. Amazed everyone who tried it. Cooked the roux for about a half hour, fairly low, to prevent the bacon fat oil from burning. It was delicious.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  It turned out perfectly and I couldn’t be more pleased with the results.  I added andouille sausage, crab, shrimp, and crawfish for my proteins and made it step my step as written.

This recipe is great. File powder is not something I could find in my area so I had to leave it out, and I added crawfish (a MUST for gumbo in my house) and overall this thing was a hit.
We ate some of it and froze a bunch to eat later.
Fantastic stuff right here!
Easy to make, a lot of fun for an all-day cooking project, and the finished product is superb.

I don't know what I did wrong. I didn't have gumbo file and i didn't have enough bacon fat so I substituted butter. It came out sweet with a little aftertaste...

This is the best ever homemade gumbo.  It took my son a total of 5 hours to complete, so plan an afternoon.  We replaced the bacon grease with demi glace to save my gall bladder.  Still yummy and filling

I made this and it came out awesome! I used homemade stock instead of the bullion and added some blackened chicken. Came out Bomber! I’ll make this again.

Made it just like the recipe said, only thing I added was some red drum chunks. Along with the lump crab and shrimp and anduie sausage. It came out so good with so much flavor. The key is to get the roux just right..after that it's just a matter of puting it together, it takes a little effort but it is well worth it.

This is definitely my go-to gumbo recipe and I stay pretty close to it as written because it's amazing (except I usually don't include the crab meat). The two main changes I make are in the preparation. Rather than bullion cubes and water, I prefer to make  broth from the veggie scraps as well as extra veggie cuttings and leftover bones I have frozen (chicken, ham/pork, beef, and/or shrimp heads/shells).  Also before I start the roux, I like to sear the sliced sausage in some of the bacon dripping and then also give a quick sear to the shrimp in the same pan (then remove and set each aside until it's time to add them individually to the gumbo). These just add an extra depth of flavor.

I loved this! The roux was a bit labor intensive but like most things in life a little extra work really made the difference. We will be enjoying this on Fat Tuesday with a Hurricane!

Good recipe though I would not use beef bouillon cubes but stick with seafood stock, preferably homemade.  I would also use fresh crabmeat if possible and up the roux a bit for more thickness.  I would also up the okra.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I was missing my Meme's gumbo this year so this was my first attempt at cooking it on my own and it was better than what most restaurants have! I only had enough bacon on hand for 1/2 c. of drippings, so I subbed butter and alittle bit of veggie oil for the rest. I wanted super dark roux so I wisked it for 2-3 hours, which was well worth it! We splurged on organic veggies and Dungeness crab meat (about 1 3/4 pounds to make the gumbo really thick), and local gulf shrimp (the listed amount). I may have added a little extra garlic, used mostly spices from the World Spice Merchant at Pike's Place Market: bay leaves, file powder, white pepper (in addition to black),  herbs de provence. It's a little labor of love, but well worth it for authenic gumbo! I look forward to making it again and using more bacon!

I really liked the recipe.  Since I'm not 100% sure what a Creole gumbo should taste like, I don't really have a reference for the flavor.  I guess over 2000 other people think it's pretty great because it's 5 star rated right now.  If I were to make this again, I'd probably add a bit more cajun seasoning and maybe spice it up a little bit, too.  Overall, however, I was pleased with the outcome.  I'll be eating gumbo for days.

Excellent Gumbo.

I followed another reviewers suggestion to bake the roux, because it requires less attention. Game changer!

I think everyone adjusts seasonings to taste. We like spicy, so used more Red Hot, and some cayenne. Still giving 5 stars because most cooks do this anyway.

Pic attached of baked roux.

This recipe is great and I did minimal modifications.  I used 2.5 lbs of crab, 3 lobster tails, 3 lbs of shrimp and a lb of andouille sausage.  I added more file powder and fresh garlic.  I feel that there was just enough meat in this dish that you got some in every bite.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is my first time making gumbo.  We used to buy the canned base but there is so too much salt in it.  I did not change a thing except to add a little more broth at the end because it needed more cooking time and adding gumbo vegetables because my husband bought them.  It sure didn't need the extra vegetables though.  Thank you dailyrecipedoctor for a phenomenal recipe.

This was my first time ever making gumbo. Making it  is expensive and time consuming  but well worth the time and  effort after  following this recipe.  The only changes I made were to follow a recipe for making a foolproof roux in the oven instead of stove top, using butter and vegetable oil instead of bacon drippings, used turkey andouille sausage , added  a pound of chicken thighs that I browned, added a tad bit more hot sauce than called for and used 2.5 qts of water instead of 3. This turned out AMAZING! I shared mine with  friends who are great cooks, foodies and  natives of Louisiana. They ALL said it was delicious. Their only complaints were that I left the tails on the shrimp ( I bought them the day that I made the gumbo and 3lbs was too much to not prepare in advance) . The next time I make this, in addition to the lump crab, I will add crab legs/claws  and use only 2qts water

All this is missing is a tablespoon of creole seasoning & a little bit more kick!! This makes a big pot of gumbo, so I double the sausage & the crab meat too. What a winner!!! Thanks for sharing!

excellent.. only change I made was using home-made chicken stock and canned crab (fresh was not available here in my remote area of Montana).  I made rice separately and just at serving time but a scoop in a bowl and then put the stew on top.  best I've ever made.

Perfection! I tweaked it along the way, but the recipe is a perfect baseline. Loved it, loved it, loved it!!! I used 6 baked chicken legs & 8 chicken necks (baked hard at 425), boiled chicken breasts (cubed and the stock water reused for the recipe),  1 lb of Tennessee sausage, and 2 lbs. of Argentine Red Shrimp. Perfection! That is all!!

We cook it  just like the recipe.  The only thing different we did was to double the ingredients so that we could freeze to eat later.  We have done this in the past and it tastes as good as it did the first day.  Man we are glad you shared with us this great gumbo recipe.

This was the best, substituted hot turkey sausages,  no okra or tomato sauce and it still has that NOLA  flavor.  The true key is the roux, gotta brown that flour to bring out the nutty flavor  get it as dark as you can.

This is a pretty easy to follow recipe. I gave it 4 stars for ease of completing and it wasn't a bad tasting recipe.  We didn't feel like it had enough flavor or kick. 

The recipe I use is very similar. I use 2 bags of frozen seasoning blend, 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chilies and seafood broth and chicken broth instead of water. I also add more filé powder and an extra clove of garlic.

Best gumbo recipe that I have found.  It reminds of my visit to New Orleans, and is worth all the effort to make.  It is difficult to find these old recipes, and I am happy that you shared yours.

I added scallops...just because.  I am not sure if I did the roux correctly.  It turned a dark tan, but not mahogany (I stopped at 20-25 minutes).  I didn't have a food processor, so I  used the blender which may have been a mistake.  When I added the glob of veggies into the roux it turned into a pasty cookie dough almost and never  sautéed out.  I just ignored it and proceeded with the recipe and added the glob to the boiling water and it still dissolved okay (all that bacon grease?).  Also I refused to cook more than 1 pound of bacon to yield the drippings so I had to work with about 1/2 cup and fill in the gap with vegetable oil.  Next time I will add chicken and a little more sausage.  I though it was seasoned just fine, but my mother added salt to her bowl. Just the right amount of spice/kick for me, but there is room to take it up a notch.

I actually used a jarred roux to save time and effort and it was amazing!  Everything else I followed exactly (except I only use shrimp and sausage) and I have made this several times.  I even made a version with chicken and sausage!  Everyone loves it so much I have to double the batch when I make it!

Fantastic recipe, easy to make and better the next day. I did 2 lbs shrimp and 1 pound of chicken with the sausage and crab meat. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing your family recipe!

Wonderful recipe! A little time consuming to prepare but absolutely worth it. Also, Gumbo file is hard to find in NH so I had to make it without. Still delicious but can’t wait to order the spice online and try the recipe again.

Outstanding recipe. I skipped the okra but added a touch of vinegar to the gumbo to get the acidity. This is one of only a few on here that I've saved - I'll make this one again. Tip to new gumbo cooks - it all begins and ends with the roux. Make sure you cook it low and slow and get it nice and dark.

I used kielbasa instead of andouille sausage as I am not fond of it.  I went to 4 stores and could not fine the file powder so I made it without.  It turned out wonderfully!  That is a fantastic recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing.

i made it, taking my time on the roux, which took me nearly 2 hours...didn't have crabmeat and don't like okra, so i omitted those two ingredients...should have omitted the worchestershire sauce, too, as it's all i could smell when opening the pot and it took awhile to kill that overpowering flavor, too...but very flavorful gumbo! i made it with slightly less sausage and threw in some shrimp and some extra onions and spices...would make this again with adjustments and speed up my roux time a bit :)

Thank you so much for sharing your family’s recipe. It came out perfectly. I followed the recipe excluding the Okra and vinegar. I’ve made other recipes even from a very famous NOLA chef and this out did all of them. Instructions were easy to follow. I added pan seared chicken tenders that simmered with the gumbo until it fell apart.

My husband said it the best "best gumbo I've ever had."  We make our weekday meals on the weekend and rarely make anything that's too involved, but this was well worth it!  So delicious ! I made it exactly as the recipe said.

Loved it. Made it with andouille, shrimp and crabmeat. The video really helped me learn how to make a proper roux. I recommend watching if you need help with that. Only change I would make is too add a little more heat next time. Probably add ground cayenne. It does make a lot.

We've made so many meals from recipes online that are great and I think to myself that I should review it, but never seem to follow through.  The recipe has become such a Fall staple in our house that I had to come heap praise.   It's probably the best online recipe we've ever used.  This gumbo is layered and complete.  Just enough kick and heat but not overwhelming.  It's a crowd-pleaser every time.  The few modifications we've made-  We use Alton Brown's roux recipe done in the oven.  The purists may be rolling their eyes but with kids and a busy schedule it makes this doable.  4 liquid ounces vegetable oil, 4 ounces flour, whisk in a dutch oven, put in at 350 without the top.  For a really nice mahogany roux it takes about 2 hours, a little more.   We add a little more andouille and we get claw meat for the crab.  It breaks apart to strings and is just as tasty at about a third of the price.  Give this one a try, you will not be disappointed!  It also freezes well and is even better the next day!

This was hands down the best version I have made! Delicious! The only substitution  that I made was cooked and shredded chicken in place of the crab meat. I also added a little cayenne as suggested from other reviews. I cooked the roux for over an hour to get it as dark as possible. It was perfect.

Oh my goodness this was amazing! If I closed my eyes I could have been at the Gumbo Shop in the French Quater. The only sub I made was for butter instead of bacon drippings which I did not have. I was told by my friend who took leftovers to her mom that she was dancing in the kitchen it was so good! 

Oh I also added a whole Dungeness crab into the gumbo from the beginning so it was simmering and getting extra juices. Yummy!

"OMG! "was the reaction I got when I made this dish. Yes , it was very time consuming  but so worth it. If you want to serve it for dinner, you need to start early in the day. This dish is so delicious and legit. It is true LA gumbo. Along with adding the bacon grease, I added some bacon bits which made for  a treat while eating it. I did leave out the crab because I didn't have any and so i just put the sausage and shrimp in it and it was still great. I also served it over white rice and made corn bread on the side. Thank you to the person that submitted the recipe! this is a GOD send!!

I went with seafood (shrimp, scallops, crabmeat, catfish fillets cut into cubes) and added them within minutes before serving.  Also, one of the reviewers suggested cooking your roux in the oven at 350 for 1.5 hours, stiring every 20 mins, best suggestion ever.  My roux didn't burn and I got it nice and dark and yes, I did use bacon grease.  Two packets of HEB thick cut Maple smoked bacon produced 1.5 cups of grease.  It turned out fantastic! Love Love Love it! Will do the Sausage next time around.  (as soon as I finish eating all this bacon, haaa)

For some reason, even with all of the spices added, mine tasted watery. Thus, I had to use my imagination and add  more to it in order to eliminate the watery taste.  I enjoy  more shrimp, therefore I added more than called for along with a pkg. of craw-fish tails.  l was over all pretty pleased with the recipe but it takes a long time to prepare.  It took me longer than stated.

I replaced a few ingredients, swapped out crab and put in scallops, instead of okra we used potato and corn (family is not fond of okra). Turned out splendid! very flavorful and a great base to start with if you are adventurous.

-Edit- I forgot one thing! I also swapped out bacon grease for butter, but that was due to convenience. I just didn't have enough time to cook the bacon, render the fat, etc. Still turned out delicious.

Perfect flavor, perfect consistency...an absolute perfect recipe for gumbo! On a side note, since I didn't have bacon drippings I used 1/4 c. melted butter and 1/2 c. canola for the roux and it seemed to work fine, and since I had a can of chopped tomatoes with green chili I used that instead of stewed tomatoes...I also added a pound of crawfish meat and 4 king crab legs broken into thirds...it was deliciously spectacular! 
I now have a fool-proof  "family" recipe for gumbo that I can pass down. My husband is already asking me to make this again :)

I made this today as my first time ever making a gumbo. I used crawfish, Andouille sausage and lump crab. It was excellent! We all loved it.

My mom was from the Gulf Coast so I was raised on gumbo.  I've had so many bowls made by so many different cooks but I have to say this recipe included something that I've never had in any authentic gumbo before...tomatoes.  It's only my opinion, but tomatoes just don't go in gumbo.  Other than that, this recipe is pretty darn good...especially the okra.  Gumbo is based on okra as it's crowning ingredient, the origin of the word itself, so recipes without it make no sense!

Cooked the roux to mahogany/chocolate color.
Excellent recipe. Left out the crab. Thought it would be too fishy for my tastes.

The flavors in this are great, but under no circumstances should you be simmering shrimp or crab, or really ANY seafood for 45 minutes. When I make gumbo like this I cook everything else, then the very last step is to put the seafood in, bring to a simmer for about 5-7 minutes, then turn off the heat. You can definitely let it sit for a while to blend in the flavors, but please turn off the heat source.

Made this and took it to work. I was worried because I had some New Orleans natives that are very picky and protective of Cajun cuisine. Let me just say, although it was my first attempt, everyone raved about this gumbo. The only change I would change is adding more gumbo and more sausage and maybe a little less shrimp. All in all, fantastic! Side note: I didn't have Tabasco sauce so I used Sriracha instead.

Excellent authentic gumbo. It looked short on vegetables compared to all the other gumbos I've had in the past so I tripled the tomatoes, doubled green pepper, and onion and used 5 large cloves of garlic. The rest I made exactly as written. The okra proportion was good. Really was superb.  This will now be my go to gumbo. I made it 2 days in advance to let the flavored cure and used the oven method to  making a nice easy dark roux.

THE BEST gumbo I've made or eaten!  I followed the recipe to the T, with the only exception being I blackened chicken to replace the lump crab meat.  The blackening spices in the skillet I added to the stock pot.  AWESOME.  Well worth the time invested and I promise your family/friends will drool when you serve it.  Thank you for sharing this family recipe.

Outstanding recipe!  My minor modifications:  I didn't use the bacon drippings because I didn't have any, and I used 1 lb of ocra because I didn't want to buy two packages.  I also used another's recommendation of making the roux in the oven in a cast iron skillet and wow how easy is that?  Last time I did it the stovetop way and stirred for way to long.  

After we ate all the good stuff out the gumbo and packed leftover lunches I kept and froze the rest of the "broth" which I will add to at a later date without having to make the roux, etc.  Thank you for this great recipe!

This Gumbo tasted great. Made it with some minor variations for a party. I started with a different roux, from another online recipe called Easy Dark Oven Roux which gave rich flavour and dark colour. Also used fresh okra and substituted a different sausage due to local unavailability. This I will make again soon.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is my go-to gumbo recipe. I have substituted the shrimp and crab for stewed chicken meat and it works well. You can also purchase premade, jarred roux to make this much easier. I make roux with flour and vegetable oil instead of bacon drippings (which reduces the sausage-smoked pork flavor one commenter disliked).

Absolutely unbelievable Gumbo.   I shared with neighbors and friends and received texts from all within the hour raving about the recipe.  I've made it a few times and have found that Alton Brown's oven roux makes this much less time intensive.  It's 4 oz vegetable oil, 4 oz flour, mix in a dutch oven, put in the oven at 350 degrees with the lid off for 90 minutes, stir a few times.  This roux will come out a perfect mahogany without standing stove top stirring the whole time and is the perfect base to proceed.  The only other change is rather than get jumbo lump which can be $30+ a pound, I found that using claw meat is just as good and much cheaper.  The crab basically gets broken down to strands in the cooking process anyway so there's no taste difference but a big cost difference.  Finally, as hard as it is to believe, this gumbo is even better the next day.  I've made it a day in advance and reheated it and the flavors meld so much more.  Highly recommend this gumbo!

First time ever making Gumbo.  Don't think I let it cook down long enough...but I couldn't wait any longer.  The deliciously tempting aroma wafting around my home was driving me crazy after 4 hrs.  When all was said and done...most DEEEELicious Gumbo I've had in quite a while, let alone made.  Found the Gumbo File in a clearance cart and that's what set this all into motion.  Thank you for the great recipe.  I subbed smoked sausage for the andoullie.  But still great!

Great Flavor and easy to follow. The only reason I gave for stars is because the roux too much more than 30 mins.... more like 1.5 hours. It was worth it in flavor though.

Absolutely outstanding!!! I'm not very experienced when it comes to Cajun cooking but I am when it comes to eating it. This was a fabulous recipe. I made it for my family for Sunday dinner and everyone was raving. It isn't complicated but it is time consuming. Like one reviewer said, the roux takes waaaayyyy longer if you want to get it to the rich mahogany brown. It took me over an hour but it was completely worth it. Just think of a roux as a long meditation! I would also say if you're not wanting to shell out funds for 3 pounds of shrimp as the recipe calls for, 2 pounds would be fine. But I am not complaining! Thanks so much for sharing. It's going to be a family classic for years now.

This was the QUINTESSENTIAL gumbo flavor. A bit tasking to create but well worth it!!! Ingredients make 10-12 servings, I went half on everything and still had plenty for a small group. Great recipe.

Is was very good but my chicken disintegrated by the Tim it was done.  When I make it again, and I will for sure, I will add it in precooked an hour or so before the whole pot is done. Tasty!

It was delicious, though I used 6 cloves of garlic (3 of them roasted), chorizo, and used king prawns instead of shrimp/crab meat. I added the king prawns 5 minutes before serving. With the roux and the okra it ended up being pretty thick, though i differed again by soaking the okra for half an hour in vinegar/water then frying it up with the rest of the veg in the roux.  Also fired in a bit more chili to my taste. Served with basmati rice. Definitely can recommend.

Fantastic!  as other reviewers stated...takes forever for roux to get to proper color and at that point I swore I'd never make it again.  Well.... it is so good I will definitely make it again.  A big hit and it was even better the next day.

I've always wondered how it was done. Many times I have attempted to duplicate the gumbo made in little kitchens all around the quarter. 

Thanks to this recipe, i have a pot of it in my kitchen in Texas. Many thanks!

This was a huge hit! I wanted something special and this was it! I personally am not a big gumbo fan...and don't think I've ever had  gumbo...but it was a request from my father in law.  So I found this recipe and truly believe its as good as it gets. I made chicken stock instead of water also using the chicken instead of crab. I didn't take the extra step in cooking the okra in vinegar so I just used thawed. This will be a very time consuming dish but if you do well on the roux it will be amazing!

Great recipe!!! I made a few tweaks, instead of 3 quartz of water I did 10 cups of water and 3 cups of beef stock, I still used the 6 bouillon cubes, I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and and half of cub of stewed tomatoes, and I didn't use the juice from the stewed tomatoes and 5 bay leaves. Once again great recipe!

The recipe is awesome! This was my first time making gumbo, and it came out PERFECT! Thanks so much for sharing! 


Made a few adjustments:  Kicked up the spices, added more garlic, added 1 can of stewed tomatoes, added Old Bay Seasoning, used bacon fat & vegetable oil to equal 3/4 cup as opposed to just purely bacon fat, used two types of sausage ( andouille sausage & chicken sausage ) and used two extra tbsp's of sugar.

This was absolutely amazing. Made a huge pot of it for class and everyone loved it! :)  I substituted butter for bacon grease and my roue turned out fine! (Had to eyeball the ingredients for it though). I also added canned oysters, clams, and crayfish meat, as well as a bit more spices and hot sauce, but that's just my preference. :) This makes MANY servings, enough for the whole class, plus the leftovers that are currently in my freezer!

The meal was a home run with the family. It's a keeper. I followed the steps and ingredients except the crab meat. I used chicken breast. Turned out fine and added a little cayenne. This recipe is is flavor and the key is to take your time, from the start, don't rush it.

Excellent recipe.  The first two times I made it very close to how it is written but then decreased the amount of bacon grease  - still had bacon flavor but less greasy.  Also used beef stock rather than the boulion to decrease the salt amount.

Lordt have mercy. I made this recipe for New Years Day and it is perfection. I was nervous too because this was my first attempt making gumbo and I was sharing it with the family food critic-Aunt Shirley and she loved it so I know it was good. I remembered growing up seeing crab legs in the gumbo I ate so I did add those, but otherwise I followed this recipe to the letter. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe. I'm pretty sure I'll be making this one again and again.

This was unbelievably delicious and worth the effort/money. I made this for my NYE New Orleans themed dinner. 

Some major things to note:

- I live in Los Angeles, CA and went to Bristol Farms to get my seafood. This might have been my own mistake but I wanted to get high quality seafood since I was going to be spending so much time on this. 3 lbs of shrimp cost me $75, 1 lb of crab meat cost me $55. Andouille sausage was cheap in comparison, but I just want to relay that this was an expensive dish to make! 

- There isn't much here on the details of the importance/technicality of making a roux, so in my research I wanted to just say a couple things. 1) DO NOT LEAVE ROUX UNATTENDED or it might burn and you'll have to start over. 2) constantly whisk it! It will go from a pale yellow, to a chunkier brown, to a deep, shiny, smooth, brown consistency. 3) if it starts to smoke, even if it doesn't look like it's burning, turn the heat down. 

- I accidentally put my roux in the bigger pot and the beef stock in the smaller pot. There was NO way the roux was going to fit in the smaller pot with the stock so I figured I could just pour the stock into the roux. I think this is what might have caused my roux to break a bit, because the grease was floating to the top when I added everything together. I skimmed a bit off the top and after hours of simmering, it seemed to reincorporate. It did not separate again, even after refrigeration.

- This makes a massive amount and I had to use 2

I've never made gumbo before (and I cook a lot), simply out intimidation. Also it can be a costly dish ( money and time). Antywho, after researching several recipes, I chose this one because it is closest to how my mom made it. I am Sooo glad that I did, because it was Fabulously Delicious!! Of course I always have to throw my personal alterations in every recipe, so I did add a few pan seared chicken thighs shortly after adding the roux and the result was just as I had hoped for and more! Thank you so much for sharing!

I followed the recipe to a "T". 
The only additional thing I did was added more seafood (which I seasoned and cooked separately before adding it to the Gumbo) and some Ol Bay seasoning. I also crushed my bacon (that was fried for the bacon drippings) and added parsley for a topping at serving. With a white rice, toppings and a sprinkle of Tabasco- the Gumbo was an ABSOLUTE hit for my NYE party!!!! People are asking when I am going to make more! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Made it as listed except I used butter instead of bacon grease (because my dear husband threw mine out) and with the  addition of a few jalapeños, chicken, fish, and lump crab meat....DELICIOUS! My husband is a gumbo snob (his family comes from Louisiana) and tries any time he sees it on a menu. He said this was the best gumbo he's ever had.

I made it today and plan to make another pot tomorrow.  I made a shrimp stock with the shrimp shells and substituted it for one of the quarts of beef broth.  However, I think using the beef broth turned out better than anticipated; a pleasant surprise.

Tasted GREAT until I added the tomato sauce. I actually used margarine instead of butter, which is a big roux NO-NO, but I added some kosher salt with the veggies and that seemed fine. Otherwise, I really feel that the tomato sauce added acidity that wasn't really necessary and was distracting to the flavor. Good start gumbo tho.

This recipe is absolutely FABULOUS!! The only thing I did differently is omit the okra. (Yeah I know blasphemy right?!) Family doesn't like the okra. Anyway, all in all the flavor and consistency was very good. Family loved it. Thx for sharing the secret!

Intensive but worth it.  I know nothing about authenticity but it's gotten rave reviews at my house.  Only change I make is using chicken instead of crabmeat.

I've never had gumbo so i made it exactly! Only difference was i used chicken in place of the crab and at the end after tasting it i added 2 tbsp more of Cajun seasoning because we like spicy food.  Thank you for sharing.

My Australian partner made this exactly to recipe for a small dinner party with Cajun food as the theme... inspired by  our recent trip to New Orleans.  It was absolutely delicious!  He didn't change a thing (except he halved it) and it was a winner!

We loved this! I doubled it (froze half) and followed the recipe the best I could. I had never put any tomato in my gumbo. I was a bit worried, but it was excellent!! Can't wait to thaw the rest out!

This was my first shot at making gumbo. It turned out fantastic and I'll be making it again. I'd agree it took a little longer to get the roux to a dark mahogany color but I may have been over-cautious with the heat to avoid burning it. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Added lots of extra veggies and skipped the crabmeat. Used some chicken sausage. Would consider adding chicken, but there was plenty of meat in the gumbo. Will make again!

This was an amazing recipe. I did make a few tweaks based on what I had available. Reduced shrimp to 2 lbs and the crab meat to .5 lb of claw meat (for affordability) and added two or three snow crab clusters broken at the joints. I also substituted oregano for the bay leaves since I didn't have  any, and used crushed fire roasted tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes and omitted the tomato sauce. I don't think these changes were substantial enough to change the real feel and taste of the recipe.  It was warm and satisfying and a perfect fall dinner that even the kids loved.

Oh man this was so good!  My family loved it.  My son said that usually he has to add a lot of tabasco for gumbo to have flavor for him.  But this recipe really has depth of flavor.

My mom doesn't like the tomato's so much, so I only added a small can of tomatoes. Turned out awesome! Will ABSOLUTELY make this again, and for company. Very labor intensive though. Not for new cooks.

Mmmm!!! I grew up an hour away from Shreveport, and my grandma would always make gumbo on Sunday's. Lost her recipe during a move, but this one looked familiar. 
I did leave out the dried herbs, onions and bell peppers, because the sweetness of the crabmeat tends to intensify with those added in. 
I used sriacha hot sauce, about a teaspoon for the whole pot (lazy mom yep lol) 
But it still came out amazing. 
My husband, who grew up as North as you can get, absolutely loved it. He had never even heard of gumbo.. I was tickled to death when he went for thirds, but was too stuffed.
I made honey cornbread with and had sweet tea.
Brings back good memories!! 
Thank you!!

I made it exactly as stated, except used butter instead of bacon grease.  And, I spent almost an hour on the roux and it got a brown color.  This recipe is amazing.  The broth has such depth and flavor.  My husband hates okra, yet he ate very bite of okra in his bowl.  So good!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good. I made the recipe as written, which I usually do the first time.  Next time I will add a little more okra and  spices, but it is good as written.

Thank you.  Thank you for sharing your grandmother's wonderful recipe.
 Love should always be shared. I'm sure she's pleased that many around the world are enjoying her creation. 
The only snag I personally encountered was the rendering of the Grease from the Bacon. 
First I bought Canadian Bacon. Simply because we are a very healthy eating/living  family and that's what I normally buy. 
Then I quickly realised I needed the fatty kind of bacon.  DUH!! 
Once I got the grease required, thanks again to google. We were OFF:)) 
One of the more useful comments from Muscle Jock Chef wrote.  The Roux is the most important (not verbatim). His comment stuck with me.
 He was absolutely correct. 
The Roux is Queen. 
I'm not sure My Roux was what you described. However, I will prefect my Roux making skills and make you and your Gran proud. 

Kind Regards
A Family of Many Bloodlines

This was my first time eating true gumbo, let alone making it. I'm White, and my boyfriend is Black. His family is from Louisiana, I'm from California, and our guests, both Black and White, are from New Jersey. We ALL loved this! We made Jiffy cornbread to go with it, too. I will be making this again whenever I have the time. 

I did not use a food processor, I simply chopped the veggies somewhat finely. I honestly like my vegetables kinda chunky anyway. I used 8 ounces of tomato sauce, while the recipe calls for 6 . I wonder if it's supposed to say tomato "paste" instead of "sauce", because tomato paste comes in 6 -ounce cans.

Next time, I will cut the recipe in half because I had to use two pots!

Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Definitely a recipe worth trying. I followed the recipe with only a few minor alterations... I added a teaspoon of cayenne, garlic and onion powder for a little extra kick along with a pound of gumbo crabs and a stick of butter for an even richer flavor. This is for sure a labor of love but was a for sure hit with the entire family.

I used white rice flour for the roux instead of wheat flour, due to an allergy, in the same proportions.  It worked great.  Everyone in our family of 6 liked this, even our fussy eater.  I didn't have enough time to let it cook as long as recommended, but it didn't matter; it was still delicious. We just returned from a vacation in New Orleans and everyone agreed that this was as good or better than what we ate there.

I made this gumbo exactly as the recipe states. I like to always do it by the book the first time. That way I can review it fairly, and then make changes as needed. 

Seriously, this recipe is DIVINE. I mean, wow. So phenomenal. 

The only change I MIGHT change is to use less okra or maybe even try leaving out the okra, but that's only because my kids and husband don't like it. But honestly, I think the flavor is worth it, and the thickening property is important, so I might just make them keep picking them out. I might also add more spice, but I like spicy food. This isn't a "hot" gumbo at all. Good for kids! 

Next time I'll double it so I can freeze some, because it went FAST, and it made a whole stock pot worth! 

I'll make this over an over. It's in the recipe book, for sure (I'm making a hand written cook book for my kids to have one day)! 

I'll also be checking out this recipe donator's other recipes! 

Thank you, thank you, thank you!

I followed the recipe almost exactly as stated and the gumbo turned out perfect! I never thought I'd be able to make my own gumbo. Instead of sausage, I used shrimp, crab, oysters, and crawfish. We don't like heat, so I left out the cajun seasoning. The recipe makes a HUGE pot, so I'll be freezing some for later. Thanks for sharing!

This was the best gumbo I have ever eaten!  Thank you so much for sharing!  I made it exactly like it was written except that I didn't have any thyme.  Didn't hurt it one bit.  It was exceptionally delicious!!

We currently have a Lousiana born person living with our family.  I'm finding it hard to cook in a way that she likes.  So today I printed this recipe, went shopping, and made gumbo.  It was delicious.  I confess, I couldn't afford quite so much shrimp. so I cut back to a pound, and added some browned chicken legs, and some corn on the cob, but otherwise went pretty much by the recipe.  She said it was pretty good for my first time.  :-)  I thought it was wonderful and will definitely make it again.

As with any recipe I've tweaked this one slightly to suit my own tastes but it is not necessary.  This gumbo is real.  I drool in anticipation for my trips to New Orleans where I can have their authentic cuisine but now I make it at home.  I've won over some serious taste buds with this one!  Thank you for sharing!

I do often make mine with chicken and andouille leaving out the seafood.  I cook the chicken breasts and thighs with the bacon I am rendering for the roux then remove it, let it cool and shred it to add with the okra.

I'll be honest, after several skeptical reviews I myself was a bit war about making this dish seeing how much time it would take and the ingredients required, but I was undaunted in my quest for a true NO style gumbo, and will be completely honest, this dish was incredible. I actually screwed up a bit and put a bit too much tyhme, which I thought may overpower the other flavors, but after adding the shrimp  and crab meat everything balanced out. I served this over some delicious rice, and lord knows it didn't stand a chance. Not to mention I had plenty of leftovers after serving 3. Thank you for the education! I will build off of this in my everlasting culinary journey.

Made this a few months ago for a group.  Everyone loved it.  Making again this weekend.  Super glad I found the recipe again.  Couple things I did different: used langostinos that I found at Costco instead of shrimp, and because I live in the PNW, I used dungeness crab.  Fantastic!

My husband and I went to New Orleans for the first time in January. We had some gumbo the was to die for. We were on a mission to find a recipe that was as good as the one that we had there. This is my first time making gumbo and I was looking for a highly rated recipe. My husband said he loves it and my 19 year old son said it was "wonderful". A positive response from a 19 year old is one thing, but wonderful is above and beyond. I love this recipe, it's my new go to for gumbo! Thank you for sharing.

I've made this recipe twice as is and love it.  It is time consuming but totally worth the wait.  There is a good balance of seafood flavors as well as rich meaty flavors from the bacon and sausage.  Brings me back to my trip to New Orleans with every bite!

This was my first time making gumbo.  I made it for my husband's 35th birthday and it was amazing!!  Everyone loved it. 

I will say that I would probably skip the lump crab meat next time.  It's delicious, but expensive and not as noticeable as the shrimp.  I'd probably just get an extra pound of shrimp for half the price instead.

Followed to a T the first time and was very impressed. Tweaked it a little the next 2 times with a little more garlic, sugar, and thyme leaves,  and a little less okra and celery, as they are not liked very well by my family, and now it is one of their favorites. Will definitely be fixing again and often! Delicious!!!!

The broth was fantastic. I used 2 tablespoons of Cajun spice because we like it hot. I would advise using a big soup pan. It makes a lot. I'm sure It will go fast.

I've always wanted to "tackle" gumbo and really enjoyed this challenge and recipe! It made a large pot and of course I shared with the family. Rave reviews all around. It was so delicious. I had a hard time finding the file powder but eventually spotted it in the seafood section at walmart. I was short a little shrimp so I cut up a few chicken breast tenderloins. Scrum-delum. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is awesome! I used it as a base and added a few other ingredients; chicken breast, some frozen mixed veggies and a few diced potatoes. I served the gumbo over some lime & cilantro rice and it was a winner for everyone in my family (even my 2 picky kids loved it)

Time consuming but worth it!  Substituted chicken for shrimp, - good swap for picky eaters.  My kitchen smelled like New Orleans!

It was wonderful! It is definitely time consuming, but makes a lot and so worth it
The only changes I made were
1. Made the roux in the oven.
2. I used salad shrimp instead of regular shrimp.

My husband is from New Orleans and he misses the Cajun cooking since we live several states away now.  He loved it! Thanks to this authentic recipe I was able to bring a little home cuisine to him!  Highly recommend!!

I used boneless chicken breasts instead of crab meat and only about half the amount of sausage.  I didn't have bacon fat, so I substituted a combo of canola and olive oils.  After cutting up the chicken,  I seasoned it with salt, pepper, & a bit of cayenne and let rest about 30 minutes while I cut up the veggies. Then I floured and browned the chicken.  The oil and browned bits in the pot were used when making my roux. My husband is from New Orleans and he said this was the best gumbo he has ever had (it was my first time making one) and it is definitely a recipe to keep! If I could give it 6 stars, I would.

I have already made this recipe two times and it just keeps getting better. My husband loves it and brags to all his Southern friends about it. Today is going to be my third time. It is easy and worth the time. I use the claw crab meat because it doesn't fall apart after reheating. I also added chicken. One tip is to pre-cook any sausage before you add it as it can make it greasy. It didn't spoil the taste though. This recipe yielded 8 quarts for me.  Thank you for sharing this with all of us. YUM.

Turned out awesome. Made a double recipe for a get together. I put one and a half bottles of habanero hot sauce it and it was just the right amount of heat. Also I only used the regular amount of okra and it was great. Make sure you don't burn the roux. I sat in a chair for 45 minutes constantly whisking to prevent any disasters. Also used a little extra flour to stiffen it up. It took a while to cook but it was all worth the effort.

This is an amazing recipe!!!  I did cut the hot sauce to half the called-for amount as we don't like fiery-hot foods.  This made it just kick in' right, and more could be added individually.

Great gumbo!!!  Thank you!!!

At the point where you cook the chopped veggies in the roux, there was not enough fluid to "simmer" so I used some of the broth from the 3 quarts needed in the next step. Also, I cut the hot sauce to one  table spoon since we had some folks who can handle  the heat.  It was terrific and we had more hot sauce on hand for those that wanted it. Will definitely make this again, and again, and again....

Before I added the  crab I loved it; after I hated it and removed it from the dish. 

I also made a roasted chicken and I added the chicken instead and increased the seasoning. 

So it became a Chicken and Sausage gumbo. 

I did make this Gluten Free, but overall I followed this recipe.  I used my own seasonings, my own flour mix, and browned my sausage first and roasted my own chicken. I learned I never want to eat lump crab ever again.  And I really do love crab!

I didn't have quite enough bacon drippings, so I just used a slice of bacon to add to the okra, but I did not add it to the big pot. This recipe was a bit tedious, but absolutely worth every minute.

I have made gumbo for years and was looking for an authentic Cajun/Creole recipe..and I found it here. This recipe is the best I have ever made . All who ate it were happy too. Delicious New Orleans flavor. I did not put the crab meat in it and it was still fine. Made the okra as directed, very tender. Thank you. This IS  now my recipe I will hand down to my family.

Made this for the first time last Sunday but it definitely won't be the last! I used the suggestion for making the roux in the oven. This took the sweat out of the job. I also used King Crabs. Caught a great sale! Guests didn't give me a chance to take a picture !

I have been trying to make gumbo for 10 years.  It always tasted like a good soup, not gumbo. Now with your recipe, my family always want me to make Gumbo.  Thank you so much. The only change that I made is that I coarsely chop my vegetables and I add chicken and shrimp

This gumbo is terrific! I've made it twice for a bunch of southerners (including myself!) and everyone loved it. The only thing that I would change in the recipe above is that both times I had to add some vegetable oil and water to the roux. One cup of bacon drippings just wasn't enough liquid to keep the flour from turning into dry flour balls. This is especially true when you add the veggies.

I love gumbo and this recipe is delicious, if i didn't have children i would have added ground cayenne pepper to spice it up, i did however add crab legs at the last 30 minutes of cooking which gives the crab legs a nice taste. I will definitely make this again  every once in a blue moon because the ingredients are pricey.

I LOVE the gumbo at the Station Casino's in Vegas. Small pot, cooked to order, large servings; costs an arm and a leg. This is just as good, if not better!! And stands with the gumbo I get in NOLA as well. Outstanding. Thank you!!

Superb. My first try and it was excellent.  I did modify this just a tiny bit. I made my roux in the oven following Alton Brown's method. I decreased the amount of liquid to 2 quarts based on the reviews saying the gumbo was a bit soupy. I didn't add crab meat. Instead I pan seared boneless skinless chicken thighs in butter and evoo with a bit of salt and garlic powder, then sliced it into large chunks and added it to the pot. It was fabulous. Other than that I followed the recipe. When I make this again, and I will,  I'm going to add the shrimp during the last few minutes of cooking. They weren't bad, however having tender succulent shrimp in such a beautiful slow simmered broth would add just the right touch. Thank you for sharing. It was a pleasure to make and eat.

This is it.  I've been looking for this exact taste/preparation for the past 15 years.  Tried a few recipe's here and there that were ok and satisfying but this is the one true gumbo recipe with all the essential flavors.  Many thanks for sharing

Hands down the best! It's  a lot of work but well worth it! So I usually make a whole day of it and measure and prepare everything before the cooking starts. The best part is sharing it with family and watching them enjoy it.

This was time intensive but well worth it! My husband loved it. We couldn't get the lump crab so we got the crab claw clusters and put them in which added to the presentation. Will definitely make it again but I will start earlier in the day. The roux actually took me a good hour to get it to the right color. We had a lot left over since it's just the two of us but I'm looking forward to eating it tomorrow!

I made this gumbo for Christmas and it was delicious. My grandchildren even enjoyed it (ages 3 & 7)!  I am sharing this recipe with my Mom and friends. I did use the sausage in the recipe AND Lil Smokies as well. Also, I added shredded chicken breast, and used the chicken stock from boiling instead of water. The flavor was incredible. I recommend this recipe for anyone who loves the real deal gumbo-Mickey

This was EPIC!!!!!!  A few thing I changed: I made this at my parents' so  I omitted okra since my mom hates it and and added extra shrimp. My mom got the crab for me but bought leg clusters by accident but it worked and I added cayenne because I like it spicy ;). My Dad whose from Lousiana said it was the best he's ever had. This recipe is stellar, thank you for sharing this wonderful family dish with us!!!!

My first time making Gumbo. I used this recipe. I followed it to a "T". It was very flavorful, had just the right amount of kick to it, so it was not too spicy for the kids. It was a hit with my family. I will definitely be using this recipe from now on.

Doubled the recipe for a work party and it turned out to be the best gumbo I've made. I did not use the okra though. That's just a personal preference of mine.

I've made this twice now. The first time was my first attempt at making a gumbo for just me and my SO. It turned out great. For thanksgiving j made it again for my family who has a gumbo recipe and everyone very impressed. Super easy. We added some additional spiced and meats, but no complaints!!

I just finished making this. Followed all directions even though I felt like I wanted to deviate. THIS IS SOOOOOO GOOD!! Best ever gumbo recipe EVER!!!  Well I guess I did make some changes. I used 3lbs cleaned and deveined and shelled jumbo shrimp, 1lb Dungeness crab clusters and 1lb snow clan clusters. Oh and I only used 1 bag of okra. The vinegar trick worked! No slimy okra in the gumbo!! Thank u thank u thank u THANK U!!!

BF is from MS, his ex is from LA, I am a Brit living in NC, he was craving gumbo, I didn't even know what it was. This recipe made me a star (although tracking down some of the ingredients were an adventure as I wasn't even sure what some of them were! I did sub the shrimp for crab and salmon and the Okra for Brussels also increased the spices, otherwise made as is. Absolutely amazing, thanks for sharing, definitely a keeper!

Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.  I've only tried gumbo once while visiting New Orleans back in 2007. Since then I  have been craving this dish.  This satisfied my craving.  For my meat choice I added 3 pounds of chicken breast,  diced up along with smoked hot sausage.  My husband now wants me to add shrimp to the mix and I agreed.  I've never made Roux, so I was surprised to cook with the 3/4 bacon drippings, thank goodness I keep drippings in the refrigerator. I'm really not sure what  the File' does, because the drippings and the flour really thickened the  dish. I also added Knolls beef bullion and bullion.   I didn't  a and fun to make. I didn't add salt because of the bullion.  I also made my own Cajun spice from a recipe here on this website. Wonderful dish.  I has the right amount of everything. Would make a great Christmas dish. My husband is from Tennessee and he agreed.

We have made this twice and we love it!  The only changes were adding crawfish tales. Didn't have enough crab meat. And added a few diced carrots cause I like them. 
The flavor is wonderful. I think it's from the roux, nothing else I've cooked has it. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Very scrumptious, everyone who ate it raved.  I put thin strips of chicken in it instead of crab meat but otherwise followed the recipe.  The roux was totally worth the time.  Thank you so much, this is a keeper.

The reviews are all right. This is a really delicious recipe. I cheated & used Tony's Chacere's instant roux mix & significantly cut the cooking time down without sacrificing in flavor. I'm not sure I'd make the roux from scratch as the first time I did that years ago, in college, it was a total fail. Plus, I'm impatient when it comes to making food. I like a quick meal when hungry.Thanks for delicious recipe!

I've been searching for a recipe that matches the flavor of a gumbo I ate a few years back. I've searched hi and low and finally ...I found it! This is absolutely delicious! I used 3lbs of shrimp, 2lbs of crab legs, 1lb of chicken andouille sausage from Trader Joes, 1lb bag of L'agostino tails from TJ's, ...and followed the rest of the recipe to a "T". I also made my roux with 1 cup of flour and 1 cup of bacon grease. Plan this meal around a houseful of good friends. They will talk about it for a long time!

I've been making/tweaking this recipe for 4 years now and this is awesome Gumbo. 

I usually make this recipe to fill a 16qt Cast iron Dutch oven and it's got great flavor and is, like most soup type dishes, much better the next day. 

Recent changes are adding a pound or 2 of bay scallops at the end.  My wife likes it with extra meat so I nearly double the sausage and add a few pounds of Chicken Thighs.   Also making a pound of fried okra for topping it once bowled is great.  As far as the roux goes, I do both ways, oven or stove top, oven is by far easier but I prefer the stove top as far as flavor.  For oven roux google "good eats roux", Alton Brown has all the nice little tricks.   I do rice on the side the first day but then add it to the Gumbo after that.  Put some Slap Ya Mama seasoning on it after bowling it up and serve with a crusty bread. 

Once maple syrup season begins I'm going to try over the campfire gumbo at maple camp.  I'm sure the smoky flavor will be a great addition. 

For me, my gumbo, chili, and chicken and dumplings are always getting requested at get-togethers for me to bring.  Only good thing about winter is it's time for hot bowls of this and other good food.

OH MY GOODNESS!  I can't shovel it in my mouth fast enough!  I grew up on gumbo in La. when I was very young and never found a recipe that satisfied that "this is exactly how it tasted when I was young" feeling.  This recipe may even be better than that feeling!  My entire family loves it and this one will go in my recipe book to pass down for years to come!  THANK YOU for sharing this special recipe.

Wonderful recipe! I'm not a gumbo gal, but was having a Cowboys/Saints watching party and thought it would be fun to make chili and gumbo. I stayed true to the recipe other than substituting chicken for the crab. I found Gumbo File at Penzy's. Now, as far as making it...what an undertaking! I thought the roux would never darken/thicken (used a cast iron skillet). I spent over an hour, constantly stirring on medium heat (gas stove), until I decided it was ready.  I was very afraid of burning it after reading several reviews, and left the skillet maybe 4 times for a max of 20 seconds each time.  Thought my arm was gonna fall off! I was paranoid I'd burned it because, even though it looked "right",  it smelled burned.  All I could think about was if it was burned, it would ruin the whole pot of gumbo, which by that point I'd invested a lot of time and money in.  I went through a couple packs of bacon to get 3/4 c bacon grease and wasn't about to go through that again if I had to start over because of burned roux. Thankfully, the roux was fine (after consulting with a Cajun friend via text photos and descriptions) and the end result was just wonderful. WHEW!  The 4 Louisianan's  assured me it was delicious and happily took home all the leftovers, which told me they weren't just whistling Dixie about how good it was.  So...based on the reaction of the gumbo snobs, I am going with 5 stars.  If there is ever cause to make gumbo again, I'd certainly use this recipe.

I've used this recipe several times with great results. I substitute lard for the bacon drippings, however. It's important to get the roux looking about the color of peanut butter for the best flavor. Takes awhile but worth it! I use a flat wooden spoon and it works great.

Update:  I have made this a few times now, (after my boys demanded it)i was wondering about the bacon...the recipes never says what to do with it.   

This was my first time making gumbo, and I am so glad that I  decided to use this recipe!  I changed just a couple of things.  I skipped the okra  for fear of ruining the gumbo (never had it , I want to try some before I serve it) I also added, mussels ,  and scallops. It was a HUGE hit with my family.  I did expect it to be thicker though, it was like soup!

I am so glad I found this recipe.  My husband and I love Gumbo, but it has to be good.  This was my first attempt to make gumbo, thanks for sharing.  I will have a hard time ordering from anywhere, knowing that my Gumbo, as my husband said, I made some fye  Gumbo....

This is the best thing I've ever made. Ever.
It takes a long time, but it's worth it, I keep portions in my freezer and it's just as delicious later.
I significantly reduced the amount of crab as it's hard to find and expensive here, next time I'd probably skip it.  I also had to skip the ocra as it was too difficult to find (Calgary AB). I love ocra but it's delicious without.

Our family enjoyed this.  We added one 3.5" stylus to the pot 30 minutes before serving (cook until the foam tip is dissolved). 

When we make it again, we will used a little less sausage and substitute ghee for the bacon drippings.  That undertone, while authentic, is not our fave.

Great recipe. The crab over chicken was a very nice touch. Added a lot more flavor. I added minute rice in the last 10 minutes before serving and it was a nice touch. Didn't thicken it too much either. On top of the franks extra hot I used I added another tbsp of Sriracha for a little more kick. All in all one of if not the best gumbo I've had!

This is my second time making gumbo and it's my most successful! I was able to get my roux a milk choc color but next time I will be more patient in order to get that deep mahogany.
I followed the recipe to the T except I eliminated the okra because I didn't have any on hand but I didn't miss it at all. Great flavors and its not hard if you take your time.
This is definitely going to be a new staple in my recipe box.  
Thanks for sharing.

I halved the recipe because there are only two of us, but it still made enough for 3 meals of 2 generous servings each. It was expensive, and not for those in a hurry, but we found it well worth the time and expense. I agree that the roux makes the dish, and it requires full attention from the cook. I will make this again! Oh, and I did substitute Kielbasa, but it was still delicious.

I like spicy food so I rounded up the amount of Cajun spice. Big mistake that I won't do again. Did not want to pay for crab but did add tsp of Old Bay Seasoning. Great comfort food!,,

This was my first time making Gumbo I used fresh okra and followed the recipe closely. It turned out great!!!! I served it with rice and a side of potato salad and from what I have been reading onthe internet that is how it is served in Louisiana.    Give a man a fish and you can feed him for a day.  Teach a man how to fish and you can feed him for a lifetime.      That is how I feel about you sharing this recipe.  Thank you!!

This recipe makes delicious gravy. Seriously, this gumbo is like gravy soup, and it's amazing. I fudged it:
-coconut oil and margarine instead of bacon grease
-no file powder or tomato sauce
-only cooked roux for 30 minutes because i ran out of time
-final cooking only 30 minutes, not 1 1/2 hours
AND IT WAS STILL WONDERFUL, I definitely recommend this recipe. Just throw whatever meat/veg you have in, too, it'll be great ;)

Perfect. Authentic flavor. I use a "store-bought" roux, authentically made in Broussard, Louisiana. If you can find some, it saves a whopping hour to an hour and a half!  I put in 2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts,cut into bite-size chunks, Andouille sausage, blue crab chunks, and shrimp, of course.
So-o-o-o good served in a bowl on a bed of brown rice with rustic, crusty bread.

Fantastic!  I followed the recipe pretty close, and it was so good!  I have one person that cannot handle much heat, so I avoided the Andouille and used smoked sausage instead.  I also used chicken instead of the crab meat to make it more economical.  The broth was to die for!  I sampled a bit before adding the okra and I just had to keep going back for more! I had a hard time finding the file powder, but finally found it at one of the local grocery stores.  I will definitely make this again!  Thank you so much for sharing this great family recipe!

This is now MY family gumbo too! I have a big family and this pleases everyone!!!! We love it and we thank you so much for sharing! Although, I must admit, I add deep fried crunchy okra to the top before serving.

Wonderful recipe! I'm a Texan but my husband is from Louisiana and he loved it. I sliced boiled eggs and put them on top of each bowl of gumbo. Cooked roux longer and used a tad more Tony Chachere. Used fresh okra from my garden. Thanks for sharing!

I made this tonight with smoked kielbasa, 1 1/2 lbs chicken and 1 1/2 lbs shrimp. This made it a little more pocket friendly. I omitted the Worcestershire sauce only because I can't stand it. It still came out very yummy. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for the 2013 Mardi Gras season for the first time and will make it again this year.  It was one of the best gumbos I have ever made.  Thanks for sharing.

Thanks a million, truly a great recipe. I have cooked many many gumbo recipes.  This one is one of the best I have followed. I did incorporate a few others in with this one.  First,  it took about an hour to make the roux at a lower heat in order to make a medium dark. Second,when adding the sausage, I added about a half a cup of home made tasso.  I cut the Tabasco in half, because the extra spice in the tasso. Third,  I cooked 2.5 lbs of snow crab in the 3 quarts of water, discarded only one quart and added 1 quart fresh     water. Then followed with bullion. Authentic taste, one. .. If not the best I've made

I have ate gumbo many times but never tried to make it myself. Watching the video made it seem very easy so I tried it, this was the best decision I made all week on things to cook.My family and friends loved it and can't wait until I make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe! I recently had some gumbo cooked from a friend's mother and it was so flavorful (very good!), so I searched online for a recipe. Sure enough, I came across yours and I love, love, love it! My company loved it too! Thank you for sharing!

Wow, just wow. This is an absolutely incredible recipe. The depth of flavour is amazing. Very authentic. Serve with Crystal hot sauce if you can find it.

Great recipe! Used butter, didn't have any bacon drippings. I used a can of Rotel tomatoes instead of stewed to kick up the heat.The roux makes this! Skipped the crab and substituted shredded chicken. Delicious, thanks for sharing!

This recipe is outstanding. Made a bit change. When boiling the water and bouillon i also added squared pieces of chicken breast. I allowed the chicken to boil with the roux and seasonin n herbs. I followed the timing and all as on recipe except the chicken part. Did also add a bit of italian seasoning since it invludes thyme rosemary n so forth and kept the bay leaves as on recipe. It was delicious. I bought a mix seafood bag at walmart w scalobs octopus shtimp musles and added extra shrimp and crab legs. Omg!!!! Delicious. My husband who is from Louisiana born n raised said it was beyond good. My first GUMBO was just a outstanding success... Thank you and i just love to experiment a bit here n der to add a pinch of flavor. To all, enjoy!
