Amazing!!! I opted to go vegetarian on this dish and omitted the beef and beef broth. I made a veggie broth instead, creating 3 1/2 cups of broth and 1 cup of water. I sauteed the veggies for 20 min and boiled them for 10. I don't like any crunch in m soups. I used 3/4 cups of elbow pasta and I cubed 2 potatoes and a cup of quatered cherry tomatoes added at the end.  You do not miss the meat at all. Rave reviews from everyone.

My whole family loved this recipe! My husband normally doesn't care for vegetable soup but he said this one is a keeper. I used a little more tomato sauce, 24 ounces total and a cup more water, then cooked the soup down to a stew right before I added the pasta. I also added a cup of chopped fresh mushrooms and half of a small chopped onion. Yum!

Best Ratatouille i've ever had, but if your veggitarien, subsituted the beef for beans (any kind), and subsituted the beef broth for water.

I made this with ground turkey and chicken broth to be more health conscious, but next time I will try it with beef. The turkey just seemed off with what I wanted to be a hearty soup. The other flavors went well together!

This was a very hearty soup that I really enjoyed. I added some red pepper flakes to my bowl as a previous review suggested, and it gave the meal a nice little kick. Try it out, you might add this one to your recipe list like me.

very tasty,and so quick and simple to make,I added a couple of dashes of salt while cooking to give it a little seasoning and I loaded mine with lots of eggplant and zucchini and instead of elbow macaroni I made it with egg noodles,next time I make this,I'll add some pearl onions to it.

Excellent soup!  I made this for lunch today with a friend and she took some home for her husband!  We'll eat the rest for supper tonight.  I followed the recipe other than adding an onion (with the beef) and I used beef broth and no extra water. Great recipe.

Having never tried Ratatouille Soup before, we weren't sure what to expect.  What a wonderful surprise!  We all loved it.  I had most of the ingredients on hand but I did have to make a few changes.  I doubled the recipe and because I had no beef broth I used a Tablespoon of instant beef bullion and 3 Cups of water.  I had only one green pepper, so I used a red bell pepper along with the green, I had an off brand spaghetti sauce on hand (45 oz.) and used that, the only other change I made was a generous sprinkle of garlic pepper to the soup.  I only wish I'd found this recipe at the beginning of summer harvest so I could continue to take advantage of our fresh picked eggplant (we grow and prefer white eggplant, so good!) zucchini, and green peppers.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  I served the souped with Jo's Rosemary Bread from this site.  Mmmm mmm mmm

I prepared this soup with ground bison instead of ground beef and it tastes soooo delicious. This was my first time cooking this type meat and like other reviews have stated, the taste is better than ground beef. I read that someone cooked ground turkey instead of beef and did not like the results. I am glad to have this information as I generally only use ground turkey in lieu of ground beef. Again, this recipe is a keeper and substituting beef bouillon instead of the condensed beef soup worked well also.

This recipe is pretty good. The spaghetti sauce  taste fades into a very good tomato based soup. It didn't take long at all.  Now, if I could get the kids to eat it!

VERY good!! This was such an easy recipe, and it was a great way to use sopme of the zucchini and eggplant my mother-in-law gave me! I think I added more veggies than what it called for, but it was great! It is more like a stew than a soup. You could even make it vegetarian by omitting the hamburger and using veggie stock instead of the beef broth and water. Defintely a must try!

Yummy!!  My 7-year old said it was the best soup he'd ever tasted!  ;-)  Seriously, though, it is really easy and really good.  Use low-salt beef broth for a healthier option.

This was amazing!!  I did follow some other ratings and added a few things.  Added sauted onion and garlic in olive oil, added herbs de Provence, dried thyme and dried parsley.  I also removed the skin of the zucchini and eggplant.  Also did a trick I know with eggplant to get out the bitterness.  Cut large slices, generously salted both sides and layered in a collander and covered with a wet paper towel for 15 minutes, then rinsed and cut into cubes.  This will be a staple in my kitchen!!

Fantastic!  Easy, delicious, and healthy.  We used a smaller pearl-sized pasta but otherwise did exactly as listed and loved it.  The next time we did a full cup of pasta to make it more stew-like; also excellent.

This is one of my favorite soups. I've made this without changes and it's excellent and I've made it with a few changes.  Sometimes I'll add more veggies such as zucchini, bell peppers and 1/2 pound of hot Jimmy Dean sausage in addition to the hamburger.  I also like to add a couple of hot peppers.... Just make without changes first, then next time add all the extra things you think will add to the flavor.... I've made this many, many times and I've never been disappointed!

This was the best thing I've made in a while!  I made some changes to the recipe:  ground turkey instead of beef, 1/4 cup chopped onion, 2 cloves crushed garlic, 1 cup macaroni, garnished with freshly grated asiago cheese.  Delish!

'Not too impressed with this one, but I had all the ingredients so it saved a grocery store trip.  Lacking in flavor eventhough I added red pepper.  'Won't be making again.

For as quickly as the soup comes together, it is surprisingly good!  I didn't have ground beef, so subbed diced turkey kielbasa and used small pasta shells.  Seems like it would adapt to other subs as well--might try a chicken sausage next time.

Delicious! I have never really been a fan of eggplant but decided to give it a try. I am definitely adding this one to my recipe box.  I will try adding some tomatoes or cauliflower next time as well...I think this is a great recipe.  Thanks!

Best thing about this recipe is how versatile it is. I made it the first time with everything originally listed plus I added fresh minced garlic, chopped onion, fresh parsley, cayenne pepper, and chopped jalepeno. (We like spicy) I accidentally put too much pasta which made it look more like a chile but it tasted really good. This time around I didn't have zucchini or green pepper so I tried to improvise with other flavors by adding real bacon pieces and a little bit of chopped summer beef sausage. The taste was very different but it was still really good. We ate it with a side of plain white rice to help mellow out the spice a little bit.

Haven't tried it yet but it smells good! Instead of cooking it on the stove I added all ingredients except the pasta and put it in the crockpot and will cook on low until 8:30ish... I also added olives and spinach. So I'll post a review after it's done :)
