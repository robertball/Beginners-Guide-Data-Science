I came here to get a recipe for what we know as Date Squares (didn't realize it was a Canadian thing!).  I do have a tried & true recipe but I was too lazy to dig it out.  I have made it enough times to remember that  this crust was the ingredients I liked. Some pointers from a Canadian:  I always find the filling too sweet in these recipes.  What I am used to is just the dates and the water(reduce to half a cup) and LEMON JUICE (extract is the best).  This makes the date flavour smooth.  Cook on the stove & mash with a fork until it becomes a paste. I like to use an 11 x 7 pan, spraying it with PAM.  Use 3/5 of the crumb mix for the base and press it down tightly.  I don't put it up the sides because the PAM prevents sticking and I get nicer squares.The date filling I take small scoops with the fork and start in corners to flatten it, then the middle, and use the remaining to fill it it.  This prevents the bottom from coming up when you are trying to spread it.  For the top I usually use my hand to crumble it evenly over the top, then press down firmly.  When I take it out of the oven I quickly cut it (4 squares across & 6 down the top) and let it cool in the pan.  Then when you are ready to serve them you recut.  Freeze beautifully(however, I never seem to have enough left to freeze).  Just some tips!

I first made these as a new bride from a Betty Crocker cookbook in 1970.  I love this recipe just as much, especially with the orange zest and spices.  The only thing I changed was eliminating the sugar in the date mixture, as I felt it was sweet enough, and I substituted coconut oil for butter (if you're not familiar with its health benefits, google it, or Dr Mary Enig).  The coconut oil stays solid at room temp so it is no different to cut in than butter.  I also added about 1/2 cup walnuts to the date mixture.  I used an 8x12 pan, which seemed to be the perfect size to keep the proportion of date and oat right.  Yummy and healthy!

This recipe, especially the crust, is wonderful. For those in a hurry, you can also use Solo Brand date filling. I did and I got great reviews from my family. Though date filling from scratch is preferred, Solo is a quality pastry filling and it worked very well with this recipe.

These are excellent bars.  I used an 8X8 pan instead of the 9X9 and added about 5 minutes to the bake time.  The finished bars are some of the best I have had.

I followed the recipe as written. The flavor is quite nice and I especially like the orange undertones. I was hoping for a crunchier texture which I think could be achieved by adding finely chopped walnuts to the filling. I used my food processor to mix the crust.

REALLY GOOD! I dislike cloves and allspice - so took those out and added more cinnamon. Crust/topping are wonderful and go perfect with the date filling!

These were tasty, but not the flavor I was looking for.  The allspice and orange zest flavors came through too powerfully for what I was looking for.

Since my husband is allergic to cloves and allspice I replaced those spices with extra cinnamon. I also used orange extract instead of the orange zest. The bars turned out great and I could have eaten 1/2 of the pan.

Very flavourful. However the oat mixture was quite dry. I would personally add some chopped walnuts just to take away the excessive pastiness of the dates. Thanks for posting!

Excellent!  Made exactly as written.  Next time I may add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts in date mixture after cooking it.  Loved the spice in the mix.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

These were good, but not fabulous. The main reason is that we felt there was too much crust in proportion to the date filling. I even upped the chopped dates to 2 full cups instead of 1-1/2 and still felt the crust overwhelmed the filling. Perhaps tinkering with the crust ingredients by calculating with a couple fewer servings, while adding a couple of servings to the filling might work. Tasty, however.

This is the best date bar recipe I’ve ever had!  I added a layer of chopped pecans on top of the date mixture, then added the rest of the crumb topping. It was excellent!

These were really good. I admit they were very sweet, but still tasty. For some reason I had bought a large bag of dates that were in the freezer. I found this recipe and it worked great. Only tweak I made was using 2 tablespoons of fresh squeezed oj for the rind and subbed apple pie spice for cloves and allspice. I would recommend to save time to small chop dates in a high speed blender or food processor. I baked mine on the bottom rack and lightly greased it with PAM spray. It took 30 minutes. I cut it into the 20 servings suggested and the bars are not much bigger than 2x2. Fine for breakfast or lunch size. ty

I brought these as a treat to work and they were very popular.  I love clove but even I would probally cut it back a bit and I used fresh orange juice instead of lemon juice.

Every time I've made and served these to friends they've raved over the spicy date filling.  I do add about 1/3 cup chopped walnuts to the reserved crumb topping. What a delicious treat!

Yummy! Re: Donna's review - 1/4 cup brown sugar in the filling, 1/2 cup in the crust. If you read the directions, it's very clear.

Delicious!  The flavor of the orange zest and spices sets this apart from other date bar recipes.

The flavors in this are exceptional, so five stars even though I made changes.

Doubled the spices, halved the sugar and used almond flour in lieu of regular flour.

Delicious.

Due to gluten and dairy issues in our home, I had to change it a little- I used GF flour and instead of butter I used coconut oil. Otherwise, followed exactly. They were delicious! My husband and 9 yr old son LOVED them!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  Thought they were delicious myself but I'm crazy for dates.  Friends and family that tried them mostly said they coulda been sweeter so next time I make em, perhaps I'll add a little brown sugar to the filling.

I made this recipe as written and everyone loved it. Brought them into work for a 'cook-off' and my contribution was the first to be gobbled up. I spread the 'crust' on the bottom and top as thin as possible and as a result did not use all the topping mixture. I will double the date mixture to increase the ratio of dates to topping when I make again for Christmas. But as written it is absolutely delicious.

This turns out with that feel from the 1950's.  It was especially liked by all.  Serving this was a surprise to everyone, they expected the date bread all mixed together.    This is a classic and IMPRESSES whenever I have made it.  Tammy

This was a simple and delicious recipe. The subtle spiced flavour is so yummy along with the hint of orange zest! We are a vegan family, so I substituted the butter with vegan margarine (Earth Balance) and it turned out great.

It was ok. Looking for a reasonable recipe to duplicate the box mix from years ago. This ain't it.  Hard to review when your mouth is set for one taste and your cooking results in something different. Rest of family liked it. 
Cloves/allspice seemed to overpower everything. May give this a few tries with some changes. If I conjur up something, will post back with url to recipe.

These were a huge hit at work! The only change I made was substituting the spices with equal amount of pumpkin spice, and using about 8 Tbsp of water instead of 2 Tbsp to hold better. Absolutely delicious; can't wait to make it again!
