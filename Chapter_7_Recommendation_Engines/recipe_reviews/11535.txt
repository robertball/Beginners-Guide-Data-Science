These aren't very good.  Light brown & basically tasteless.  Well to each his own, sorry Kirsten :)

Theese weren't awful.  There more like a fudgie cake than a brownie though.  I did 3/4 of a cup of each of the sugars ( I only made one batch)  and added half a cup of brown sugar to the mix, so this may have made them less bland.  Also use a 9x13 pan not a 9x9 or else they will be Very thick!  All in all I would make these again.

Sweet and succulent! Mine turned out yummy. It's perhaps a little too much caramel, though. Next time I'll decrease the caramel for a little more brownie taste. Thanks for the recipe!
