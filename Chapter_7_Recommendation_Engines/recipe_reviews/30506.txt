This is such a great recipe!  I make what I like to call Portobello Pizza "Burgers" from this.  I substitute pizza sauce for the marinara, and place each grilled mushroom filled with the mozzarella and pepper mixture in a foil packet back over the grill for a few minutes until all is melted stem side up inside.  I then serve each mushroom on either foccacia bread or Italian roll.  I also offer a store bought gardinera relish. This has been a definite hit with young and old - and a "sneeky" way to get kids to eat something besides a regular burger at a cookout.  This is a defintie keeper!  Thanks, Valerie!

Very tasty...I just grilled them on the stovetop first, and used fresh mozzarella. I put the whole thing on a roll for a sandwich, and it turned out great. I'll make these again.

Hubby makes these a lot during the summer months on our grill. He adds grilled sliced tomatoes and provolone cheese and pops them on toasted crusty rolls. We then top with the marinara sauce. Portobello's are so meaty you hardly miss the burger. Delicious Valerie!

Absolutely fabulous recipe! I didn't heat the marinara sauce but wish that I had because the different layers ended up being different temperatures. Also, I may heat up the roasted red peppers and then add them. Really a great recipe and very filling. I don't think this would work for an appetizer because it is so hearty.

This was good but something was overly sweet about it.  I don't know if I marinated it too long or with too much Italian dressing, if I used too much sauce (I had spaghetti sauce on hand) or if it was the peppers.  It just didn't taste quite right to me.  But my husband really liked them a lot so I will make again with some slight alterations.  Probably, I should follow the recipe to the letter.

I'm new to cooking and usually stick to recipes with lots of stars and user comments, but for some reason this one seemed worth trying - and I'm so glad I did!  I followed the recipe exactly and they were sooo good.

This is a great recipe.  We had it as a main dish.  I did make a slight change, because of ingredients I had on hand.  I used fresh red bell peppers, diced & chopped up the mushroom stems, then added both to the marinara sauce.  The bell peppers were slightly crunchy which added another dimension to the dish.

Absolutely delicioius!  I used fresh mozzarella which melted just right under the broiler.  I thought this might not be filling enough as a main dish, but with a green salad and some fresh bread to dip into the marinara sauce, one and a half portobello caps per person was more than enough.  This will be a summer staple at our house.

Simple and good, but I'm not big on the italian dressing part, so I also made a simple marinade using olive oil, vinegar, and some spices.  Also, dried herbs are similar in taste to sawdust, use fresh.

Wow, this was surprisingly yummy and also filling.  My husband, who's not a big bell pepper fan, really enjoyed this as well.  I chopped the roasted red peppers, instead of slicing them, which I think made it easier to eat.  I also omitted the oregano & basil due to family preference, & sprinkled some garlic & dried parsley on top of the peppers before adding part skim milk mozzarella.  This is good enough & different enough to serve to company.  Oh & I forgot to add that, due to the cold weather, I baked this in the oven at 350 degrees, covered with aluminum foil, until the mushrooms were soft.

So yummy.  I served this as an appetizer at a grilling party.  Several people ended up having them as the main course.  I made my own Italian dressing from scratch as the flavor is much better and the mushrooms definely deserved the extra love.  Fantastic and I will be serving these much more often!

Delicious!  Only change we made was to use fresh basil instead of dried and we melted the cheese on the grill instead of switching to the broiler.

This is terrific meatless recipe.  I took some of the suggestions and used the Italian dressing you mix yourself and also fresh mozzarella for melting on top of the mushrooms.  I made some focaccia bread and made sandwiches with the finished mushrooms.  My vegetarian boyfriend raved about them for days!

This was delicious.  I baked the portobellos according to another recipe, but then followed everything else.  I used fresh mozzerella and made a burger - it was absolutely delicious.

FABULOUS recipe!  Absolutely melt-in-your-mouth good! Will be making this again...and again...!  I added some sliced black olives along with the red peppers.  On top of the mozzarella I sprinkled some dried oregano & grated parmesan cheese.  The broiler then gave it a great light brown crunch on top!   Thanks!!

This was delicious--almost exactly like appetizers I've had in gourmet Italian restaurants. I don't like Italian dressing, so I used white wine vinegar with olive oil, basil, garlic, and a touch of rosemary; next time, I'll use balsamic, which I think would be a much better complement to the flavors. I used fresh herbs, which I sprinkled on the marinara, fresh mozzarella, and homemade marinara "imported" from our favorite Jersey deli. I also roasted my own peppers. A definite keeper--and so easy!

This dish was really good, my whole family loved it.  I didn't have access to a grill that day, so I pan-roasted the mushroom caps.  I'm sure the taste would have been even better had I followed instructions exactly.

Served this dish as appetizer to impress my best friend's date, needless to say it was a huge success.  This will be a summer staple at all of our homes.  Very easy and delicious.

My parents are on the nutrisystem diet so I always try to make a nice veggie to go with their freeze dry little dinners...and I have to say they didn't even touch their entree b/c they loved these so much! Both of them raved about them and while I couldn't grill the mushroom (it was pouring rain) I sauteed them on the stove which didn't seem to hurt at all. They smelled wonderful while cooking, I will definitely make these again!

Amazing! I roasted my own red peppers using a separate recipe. This turned out delicious!!! I, however, used shredded mozzarella.

I made it as an appetizer, and everyone Loved it. It just got kinda cold fast. Dont think I would make it again as an appetizer. Maybe for a part of dinner.

Wow!!  I served these because I was having a vegetarian friend over for dinner and I wasn't sure if I'd like them or not--these are perfect.  I didn't change a thing.  I will be serving them again and again--my friends now think I'm a gourmet chef.

Wow oh wow! This might seem strange but it makes the best meal. Several notes after making this a number of times. We place the mushroom upside down and pour the dressing into the vanes of the cap -- the marinade soaks up much better and is less of a mess because you just pour out the excess before cooking. The more flavor you want the longer you marinade. We have used both the grill and the broiler which is different but work fine. Under the broiler you can brown the top of the cap first, turn it over, add the cheese to the underside then brown the rest of the way. We finish off with marinara sauce heated in the microwave. This is a really different and really easy recipe.

Definitely enjoyed this.  Made with grill pan inside, I can see where it would be much better with the smokiness of a grill.

Loved this, and we will make it again.  We only had two portabellas so we had to eyeball some of the measurements, but they turned out delicious!  We used shredded cheese instead of slices because we didn't have slices, but it got the job done.  I also added a little bit of freshly ground black pepper and garlic powder, but they still would've been good without that.  I served them with whole wheat cheese tortellini.  I was going to take a picture of them so that there could be a picture for this recipe, but we literally could think of nothing else but eating them immediately when they came out of the oven LOL.  Oh well.

Use fresh red bell peppers. Dice & chop the mushroom stems, then add both to the marinara/pasta sauce. The bell peppers remain slightly crunchy, adding another dimension to the dish.
