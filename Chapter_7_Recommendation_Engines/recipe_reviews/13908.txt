Really good but the rice and lentils needed to be cooked a lot longer. You could try this in peppers too! Will make again I'll just do it a little different.

I topped the tomatoes with feta.  They had an excellent taste and were very easy to prepare.

Delicious.  I too added feta and pine nuts.  About the only other thing I would add would be some cumin in the rice/lentil mixture.  Yum.

Very good! I recommend cooking the lentils/rice for 15 minutes on the stovetop so they aren't crunchy, but not more or they will be mushy. Firm tomatoes made scooping out the middles easy, and the cilanto substitution was quite good. Additionally, I added Goat Cheese and Pine Nuts, tented with foil except for last 3 minutes to brown nuts and slightly melt cheese, and left the "caps" off. Yummy, nutty flavor with the mildness of the cheese made this an elegant side dish for the fish I served it with! Would be a good main dish, but Hubby generally likes more than veggies for supper. :)

It was a great hit with my family.My daughter is vegetarian and she loved it.Also my husband loved it who is not a vegetarian.I advise it to anyone who loves tomatoes.Also I did not use the mint but,I did add feta cheese to the rice and I laid a slice of provlone over the top of the tomato under its hat.And I added sliced fresh mushrooms to the tomato sauce you use from the insides of the tomatoes.I also found if you use firm tomatoes it is easier.Enjoy as my family did.!

This was ok but nothing outstanding. I used green lentils - the store didn't have red - and I added a little bit of garlic to the stuffing as it was a rather bland. I don't think the mint was a good addition - it didn't complement the other flavors terribly well.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish although we both felt it was a little bland as written.  I cooked the dried lentils in vegetable broth, used brown rice, and added more minced garlic and some balsamic vinegar to the tomato mixture that went in the bottom of the baking dish.  I served this over raw baby spinach so the sauce and heat from the tomato wilted the spinach quite nicely.  Next time, I'd probably add some spice to kick it up a bit (garam marsala, probably, or chili powder).   Thanks for a healthy, tasty dish, Sue.

This was delicious.  I substituted barley instead of rice, used vegetable broth instead of water, and topped with feta.  Heavenly.

I topped this with feta and it made a very refreshing, 'bright' tasting summer entr√©e. I will definitely make this again, though next time I'll add a small amount of lamb and maybe some pine nuts.

I was not so pleased with this recipe.  I go to this website for good, accurate recipes...and this was neither of the two.  The instructions were way off (the lentils and rice should be cooked separately, as they require different cooking times).  Also, the recipe is pretty bland...no suggestions on spices?  Wasn't impressed overall.

LOVE it!  boyfriend liked it too.  I cooked the lentils and rice in veggie broth, added garlic in with the onions, cumin, garlic salt instead of salt, red pepper flakes and feta cheese.  awesome.

I also cooked the lentils and rice for 15 minutes instead of 10 as others suggested - but some of the rice burned to the bottom of my pot.  next time I'll use 1 and 1/4 cups veggie broth to avoid this.

Great flavor!!!    I used green lentils instead of red.  Used olive oil instead of veg. oil. The lentils, however were crunchy....definately need cooked thoroughly before stuffing the tomatoes. I will try making these again with adjustments.   maybe baking them longer at a lower temp.

This was really delicious! It's great served with warm pita wedges. I did have to cook the lentils a bit longer, and I left the caps off the tomatoes and poured the reserved tomato mixture over the top and around the stuffed tomatoes. SO GOOD!

This was just okay, the lentils have to be cooked completely before stuffing which takes a lot longer then rice, maybe 20 minutes, I would also use more.  I used oil instead of butter, the reason it says generously season with salt and pepper is because it's missing spices, I'll have to experiment more with it next time but salt and pepper alone doesn't do it for me.

YUM. I added garam masala as well, and feta cheese, and cooked the lentils/rice longer than 10 minutes. These were even better the first day. The leftover tomato got put on some wheat toast with mozzarella cheese for bruschetta. MM, mm.

I really liked the idea of this recipe, but the final product was bland. Granted, I tend to prefer pretty spicy foods, but it seemed to lack flavor. Being Indian, I added some garam masala  (a traditional seasoning) and crushed red pepper flakes, but next time I will try feta as suggested by some other reviewers (perhaps flavored feta!). I substituted cilantro for mint and liked the change. Overall, I think it's a good recipe with some modification.

Outstanding! We simmered lentils & rice in vegetarian broth rather than water. Had to cook the rice and lentils longer than 10 minutes.  This is a do again, and again and again!

I added 2 shikaki  mushrooms chopped and a little yellow bell pepper chopped to the sauteed onion.I also added feta, Parmesan  and shredded cheese when I blended the mixture before placing into the tomato,I also left the top off  and cooked it open face. It all turned out very delicious.Thanks for the idea!

Yum!  This was so good, we will definitely be making it again.  I hate the taste/texture of cooked tomatoes, but these came out perfectly.  Not mushy at all, and so delicious!!  We did make one change as I forgot the lentils when I went shopping (oops!) we used black beans instead.

This could have been good but like previous people have said, the rice and the lentils need more stovetop time as they weren't done after baking.

What a great dish!  I made minor modifications... I doubled the stuffing recipe.  I used brown rice and cooked it for 15 minutes before adding the lentils.  I prepared the entire dish in the morning then pulled it out in the evening to bake (took longer since it was cold from the fridge).  I served it as a main dish with steamed cabbage on the side and it was a huge hit.

Deeeelicious!  We removed the mint and added basil.  Also, couldn't resist adding some goat cheese -the entree would not be the same without it.

Very good.  I used quinoa instead of rice, scaled the recipe down to 2 servings with 1 tomato (essentially double stuffing, half tomato), and baked in toaster oven minus the "hat".  Love the mint, it goes wonderfully with the ingredients.  What I didn't like was the tomato middles/garlic  "sauce".  Just toss the tomato insides and drizzle a tiny amount of oil on top of the stuffed tomato before baking.  Use quinoa! It makes recipe is so much better than boring (not healthy) white rice.

Like someone suggested before, I replaced the mint with cilantro and added some cumin to the stuffing. Both my husband and I enjoy it and we eat it pretty regularly now!

This was very good and easy to prepare. I used quinoa instead of rice; I cooked it with the lentils for 15 minutes, and the texture was perfect. The stuffing was slightly sweet, balancing the acidity of the tomatoes perfectly. I used extra garlic in the chopped tomatoes, and I put a spoonful over the stuffing before baking. Although stuffing the tomatoes makes a nice presentation, next time, I'll chop them and mix everything together, and I'll make some extra stuffing, just because it was so delicious.

Excellent Recipe!  It's easy to modify (size wise- if you want a 'single' serving) and oh-wow does it taste good.  Perfect for my vegetarian friends. A++

Very good but I substituted cilanto for the mint and brown rice for the white rice.  Also, I used olive oil instead of butter/margarine and vegetable oil.  I cooked the rice/lentils longer like the other reviewers suggested but the lentils were mushy after 25 minutes.  All in all very tasty.

This was tasty, but I agree that the filling needs more cooking. It was a little crunchy prepared this way. I topped with feta and pine nuts, and spooned a little of the chopped tomato middles mixture over the top. Will tent with foil next time, as my pine nuts wanted to burn. A good lentil dish.

I have cooked this recipe several times, first for myself and then for my carnivorous boyfriend. We love it! We like to have a few vegetarian dinners each week for health reasons, and this one makes a relatively easy weeknight meal. I have to say, though, that the 5 stars are for the outcome with these few changes that I make with the recipe, as per previous comments and my own experimentation as follows: Instead of 8 baked tomatoes, use 4 for stuffing and 1 more for the sauce. I substituted 1 pouch of madras lentils from Taste Bite (instead of the 1/2 cup of red lentils), and cooked the rice by itself first. I omit the fresh mint, and substitute with a bunch of chopped mushrooms, red pepper flakes, and a clove of pressed garlic to the rice/lentil mixture. There will be leftover rice/lentil filling, so set aside and keep slightly warm until you are ready to serve. In step four, where the reserved tomato middles are chopped, I add fresh basil and oregano, substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Top with feta cheese and some chopped kalamata olives, I sprinkle around with tops off tomatoes and the sauce too. Add the tops and bake a bit longer, more like 20 to 25 minutes, until the sauce is bubbly. I serve the remaining rice/lentil mixture as a side to the stuffed tomato in a shallow bowl and top with the remaining sauce from the baking dish. Yum, thanks Sue!

This recipe was only so-so for me. It wasn't anything to write home about. If you enjoy the tangy flavor of slightly raw tomatoes, then follow the instructions. If you prefer the tomatoes to be fully cooked, maybe leave them in the oven for about 20 minutes or so.
There is a possibility that I may try this recipe again just to see if I can make any improvements, but I probably won't save it to my recipe box. Good luck!

This was very good, I never thought of stuffing a tomato with anything other than rice or meat.  The only change I made was I could not find red lentils and I used regular but it was still yummy...

Good!  You can pretty much add anything to this.  Make sure to just cook the rice and lentils according to their package; brands vary their cooking times a lot so the recipe's instructions may not be suitable.

The rice and lentil mixture turned out undercooked and chewy. Otherwise, the dish was just OK--not awful but just kind of boring. Will not make this again.

Very tasty dish.  My husband and I loved it.  

It's a little time consuming - but other than that it's excellent.
