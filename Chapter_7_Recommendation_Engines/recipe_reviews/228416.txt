Thought this would be a fun pizza for our weekly pizza night~super easy to put together, even with making my own crust.  Looked really 'fun'~added hot dogs to ours~but unfortunately, it pretty much tasted like lots of cheese-covered starch.  I was afraid of that, but thought we'd give it a try, anyway.  While our family didn't care for it and won't be making it again, I'm still glad you shared this recipe.  It gave us something different to try~thanks for sharing this with us!

Healthy it is NOT.  But my kids (who i have a hard time getting them to eat anything) LOVED it.  The neighborhood kids also loved it.  Lets put it this way, this will not be a awesome romatic dinner for me and my husband but it was quick, easy and kids loved it.  My husband also enjoyed it.  FYI - i used about4 plus oz of milk.

I made this for a family with young kids and then for my friends who are in their 20s and 30s. For the young kids, I just made the recipe as-is, and I just dropped it off, so I don't know if they liked it as much as we did. For my friends, I added a chopped fresh jalepeno, sliced mushrooms, and quartered cherry tomatoes. WE LOVED IT! It was great for a football get together, highly recommended :-)

I made this just as the recipe read.  I used whole wheat pizza dough, which I would opt for one more flavorful next time.  Also, while it isn't anything surprising, velveeta isn't the most flavorful cheese either.  I will make it again, but definitely up the ante next time around.

Every year me and my sis have a cook off. Different "theme" every year-- this year was pizza. We both made 4 or 5 and had a big party and everyone could come eat and vote. We didn't say which pizza was who's so it was all fair voting. And this pizza WON! I wanted to do something wayyyy off the wall and found this recipe. Followed it to a T. Very good! It's not MY personal favorite as I like a lot a veggies but I could see why everyone liked this. :)

Loved this! Closest thing to the mac and cheese pizza from Cici's that my family could get because there's not one any where near where we're currently residing. Thanks for the share! Love it.

I honestly think my crust detracted from it, the Mac n cheese was so good! Honestly not a word was uttered at dinner, the only issue is I had to guess how much milk because there isnâ€™t a measurement.

This was surprisingly tasty! I did make my own dough. My son helped make this and it was really easy to put together. We will be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I was wishing this had a specific measurement for the milk. I used 1 cup and it turned out the right consistency. I added White Cheddar Popcorn Seasoning to the cheese mix to give it more flavor. Since I made this just for my 9 year old boy,  I left everything else the same. He LOVED it.

Grandkids and I added sausage, pepperoni, pineapple and picante.  We thought it was good enough to make it again.
