Big hit at our luau!!  We had about 40 guests (and 8-10 of those not drinking alcohol or only drinking beer or mixed drinks) and we ended up starting out with a double batch, making a quadruple batch and then another quadruple batch.  Granted, we did end up with leftovers... the last batch was extra strong and at the end of the evening, but I'd say we would have been perfect with 8 batches for 30 people on a summer night.  Heeding other reviewers' suggestions, we thought the recipe would not be strong enough so we added coconut rum (same quantity as the regular rum).  Definitely will make this again.

Used coconut rum and club soda (rather than water) turned out to be the hit of our party.  One of the best punches I've ever had.

Yeah! I tried 3 different drinks from this site and this was BY FAR the best. *Using spiced rum is the key*. Thank you to previous reviewers for that suggestion! I skipped the banana liqueur--was better without it. Also, based on another reviewers suggestion, I diluted my concentrates with 50% water/50% lemon-lime soda. The punch is orange, which coordinates nicely with a fall party.

I made this punch for a Christmas Eve party and it was the hit of the evening! The punch is wonderful! It was fruity and didn't have a really strong alcohol flavor, it was just the right balance. I have saved this recipe and wouldn't hesitate to make it again. I would just warn people to double or even triple this recipe, especially if you have a large punch bowl!

Tasted great-but note that if you use 6 oz. cans and follow directions for adding water-you won't make a gallon.  I switched to twelve oz. cans and added a little more alcohol-it was great-everyone loved it!

YUMMY! rave reviews at my Bunco party. i used CLUB SODA in place of the water!!! and used half coconut rum/half regular rum. i also mixed up a can of orange/pineapple/apple concentrate and froze it in small,deep tupperware dishes to make floating ice --didn't' want it to dilute w/ plain ice ring. YUM!!!

This punch went over very well, we doubled the recipe and probably could have quadrupled it and still been short.  I didn't think there was enough alcohol in it, so we remedied that by adding about 1/4 cup more per gallon, and that did the trick!  I also added fresh pineapple to the floaters and thought that gave it a good kick.  I did have trouble finding frozen pineapple concentrate so used pineapple/orange/apple juice and it was great!

I made this fruity rum punch for Fathers' Day and it was a big hit!  The chunks of fruit floating around made it even more inviting.  Used spiced rum for one batch and malibu rum for the other.
Both were gone in no time!  Thanks!

This is by far the best punch I have ever tasted.  I used coconut rum, instead of plain rum and club soda, instead of water.  Some of the men at the party thought it was too sweet, but the women all loved it.

A crowd pleaser.  Next time I will choose the smallest oranges, limes and lemons around.  People liked the fruit in their cups however the oranges were too big. This was a success at this new Year's party.  I converted the recipe to 72 and it was all gone.  Next time I will freeze some of the punch and add it to the rest of the punch before serving.  Ice cubes melt and the drink waters down.

I also had a hard time finding frozen pineapple concentrate in typical Florida stores like Publix, Albertsons, etc. Every one liked it, I also added some kiwi liqueur too.

Excellent punch. I had doubled the recipe and it was all gone. I thought people were going to start licking the punch bowl to get more. Very strong, too. Everyone was having a good time after that punch.

Anyone who doesn't really like the taste of alcohol, this is your punch.  It was great, I didn't add the banana liquer, but it was just as good thanks.

Made this for a bar-b-que and should have made six times as much. Everyone just loved it and I spent most of the evening making another batch, again and again.Used spiced rum and it was awesome! Thanks so much for sharing.

Excellent recipe.  I couldn't find a 6oz can of frozen pineapple juice anywhere - I checked at least 6 different grocery stores here in Atlanta.  I substituted two 10 oz cans - TOO MUCH pineapple juice.  I also tried it with 2 1/2 6oz cans of Dole, and that seemed about right.  

I also like to cheat and give the fruit slices a gentle squeeze before I toss them in.  Yum!

Seriously good stuff. :) I double the recipe and leave out some of the water; then I freeze it.  I just fill up a glass with the frozen concoction and top it off with lemon-lime soda when I want fruity drink.  Works like a charm. Don't forget the paper umbrellas!

This was a huge hit at my Halloween party!!! I left out the banana liquour, and made four batches. (I have a five gallon punch bowl. Good thing!) I used spiced rum; but I think that Malibu rum would have tasted better. (The coconut flavor would probably blend w/ the pineapple juice nicely.) I also used seltzer water for the juices, that worked great. Thanks Jeff!!

This punch was a huge hit at my party!  I substituted seltzer for the water in the juice concentrate and used apple orange pineapple juice, which worked out great.  Only problem was running out after two batches!  Great recipe.

This punch disappears from the bowl quickly at all my parties.  I have to make about 3 batches for every party.  A must try for someone who doesn't want to take the time to keep mixing drinks.

Made this for our Halloween Bunko party and had to make 4 servings!!  It was a HUGE HIT!!  No body could even tell it was spiked!  We did take other reader comments, and forgo the Banana Liquour and Grenidene.  We used Club Soda for the first two batches instead of water, and water for the second two batches (cause I ran out of club soda) and it was MUCH MUCH better with club soda.  WE used Captian Morgan's SPice Rum and the Malibu Coconut Rum instead of just rum.  I ran out of the Coconut Rum, and we used some Jamaican Appleton Rum, and it was yummy too.  If you have a Medium sized punch bowl, you could easily make two batches at the same time.  I added Eyeballs, and festive ice cubes and even when the ice cubes were in, it still tasted YUMMY!  It wasn't too sweet at all!    Thing is, I don't think you can screw this up!!

Excellent spiked punch!  Followed directions exactly with great results.  Good to freeze juice into ice cubes before party as to not dilute the punch with watery ice cubes.  Also, stir every so often, as it tends to seperate.  Thanks, I will use again and again.

THE BEST!   Everyone raved about it...there was none left by the end of the party!  I followed others suggestions and used club soda in place of the water for the concentrated juice, it was excellent.  My grocery store didn't have concentrated pineapple juice, so I skipped it and did just the OJ instead.  I did add a small pineapple/banana juice that I got from the fruits and veggie section of my store.  I also used Malibu coconut rum and added some maraschino cherries with the juice.

FANTASTIC!  Everyone at my pirate themed party loved this punch and we had to go to the store to make more!!!! I bought the wrong sized frozen concentrate, 12oz instead of 6oz so I doubled the recipe but I'm really glad I did because we drank this up very quickly.  From reading previous comments, I added both regular spiced Rum (Captain Morgan) and coconut Rum (Malibu), skipped the banana liqueur, and mixed the juices together with lemon-lime soda instead of water. Even my friends that aren't big fans of alcohol loved this recipe!

JEFF: You da man! This stuff is incredible and I wish I could hug you for help making my party such a success. I had everyone telling me that this tasted like the Orange Dream Machine at Jamba Juice. It's so good, you don't know there is alcohol in it. UMMMMMMMMM!
Tips for other recipe users: Try different kinds of rum for alterations in flavor. I.e. pineapple rum, mango rum, spiced rum, dark rum, coconut rum, etc. Help your guests achieve a relaxed buzz while satisfying thier taste buds: MAKE THIS PUNCH!

I made this for New Years Eve and everyone loved it!!  I used coconut rum for one batch & Captain
Morgan for the other but I did skip on the banana
liquer.  Both batches were excellent!!!  Would 
definitely make again.

Very Yummy.  I used the Orange/Pineapple combo juice concentrate. I used seltzer water for mixing with juice to give it a sparkly taste. I also used Malibu coconut rum. I then individually froze them in cups and set them in trays in my extra freezer overnight-When the guest came I brought them out and let them add 50/50 or Jolly Good which is a lemon/lime soda. The drinks were a success!

This was easy enough to make and people really liked it.  I used vanilla banana rum since I had this on hand along with banana liquer.  I don't really like sweet drinks but as I said, others seemed to enjoy it.  Personally, I think you could go a bit heavier with the rum to make it a more potent punch.

I followed others advice and left out the banana liqueur, used half coconut rum, have dark rum and instead of granadine, used a splash of triple sec. I made four batches for my bunco group (12 women) and it disappeared. Everyone was feeling very happy at the end of the night. This one goes down easy, and then woosh....your gone!

This punch was a definite hit at Thanksgiving dinner. I followed another member's suggestion and used club soda instead of water and half regular rum and half coconut rum.  I doubled the recipe and it was gone quickly!  From now on, I will quadruple.

I made this for a Girls Night Gathering at my house, and we ended up going to the store for more rum! I made it with Sprite instead of water, and Pineapple and Orange Rum instead of regular. (A little extra rum was needed for this gathering!) AWESOME PUNCH! They all took the recipe!

I made this punch for a group of adults and it was a hit.  I added some things mentioned in similar recipes on this site such as the frozen strawberries from the Punch II recipe and did not use the Banana Liquer because my husband doesn't like bananas.  It was hugely successfull.  Would make a great brunch beverage.  I am making a nonalcoholic version for a family party.  Looked very pretty and apetizing in the bowl as well.

I have made this punch on several occasions, usually doubling the batch, and every time I've run out early. My friends call it "dangerous", because it's just so sweet and fruity and easy to drink that you tend to forget about all the rum. :) A friend of mine liked it so much, he asked for the recipe to use at his wedding reception. I don't think it's really possible to screw this one up, even if you're following the directions loosely. I recommend Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum in this mix.

This was wonderful. I made several batches for a party and it was gulped down. I used half regular Bacardi and half coconut Bacardi, skipped the banana liquer and used Sprite Zero instead  of water -- it makes it nice and fizzy but doesn't add any calories. For reference ... one batch fills a standard pitcher. My punch bowl easily held four batches at a time.

I made this recipe last night for a group of girlfriends over.  It was so yummy!  I did as others suggested and used club soda instead of water. (Then switched to sprite when club soda was gone!)  I also did not add the banana liquer.  It was really fruity and everybody loved it.  I had to make 4 batches and there were only 7 of us.  I also used Malibu Rum for coconut flavor.

The punch was awesome.  I had about fifteen people over and I ran out.  From reading previous comments, I used 12 oz. oj and 12 oz. pineapple juice inorder to make a gallon.  Also I used all seltzer water for the mixer for the juice to give it a sparkly taste.  I also used Malibu rum which gives it a coconut flavor.

I have made this many times and my favorite combination is done with 1/2 coconut rum and 1/2 spiced rum. When I mix the juice, I use 1/2 water and 1/2 club soda. I always leave out the banana liquer because I don't like that strong banana taste. I also like to freeze some of it to make it slushy. Everyone always asks for the recipe!

Thanks Jeff, We have made this recipe 3 times so far. It is always a hit, we double or triple the recipe and freeze the leftovers. It's great on a hot day!
The coconut run makes it!

I looooved this punch. I did a few things other suggested- I used club soda instead of water when making the juice, and I cut up the fruit, and mashed it a bit with a spoon to get the flavors out. Was a very easy to sip drink on a hot night.

This punch is wonderful.  I searched the web for a festive punch for my Christmas party and found this one, it worked very well.  We made 120 servings using the Customize tool at the bottom and it came out yummy.  Although we ended up adding a bunch of Hawaiian punch and Sprite to add more luquid.

Had the same effect as the rum punch served on the cruise ship excursions.  Never knew I was drinking an alcoholic beverage, but then it hit me pretty hard.  I added a lot more rum than what is called for in the recipe and still did not taste any alcohol.

I doubled the recipe to make this for a super bowl party.  It was gone by the second quarter!  Very good stuff...I used half malibu rum and half dark rum.  It was a little strong, but everyone really enjoyed it.  The floating orange, lemon, and lime made for a very nice presentation.

Was not happy with this punch.  I followed directions exactly and found it was much too strong.  (Plus it did not look enought to serve the amount stated). I added 2 cans of ginger ale, 2 cans of Hawaiian punch and it was much more delicious this way!  I definitely would recommend adding your own ideas and I bet champagne would be good too.

This was a huge hit! Left the  rum on the side and used 1/3 lemon lime soda 2/3 water when mixing the juice.  Kids and adults alike let bed it!  I will probably double it next time, we ran out completely.

Very good!  You will need to add more than just a dash of grenadine if you want a pinker color.  My friends and I enjoyed it!

I use club soda instead of water, no banana, coconut rum and a splash of pineapple vodka if you are really feeling frisky ;) You can't go wrong with these flavors, even adding more or less of any of the ingredients to taste. but be careful, it doesn't taste as dangerous as it is!! Great recipe, it's my go to for pool side parties!

This was good. I didn't use the banana liquer and used coconut rum. Everyone loved it. It is a bit heavy to drink more than 2 of them.

This was such a hit!  So yummy and it really sneaks up on you.  I had trouble finding the right concentrate juices in the store, so I went over to the juice aisle and bought Simply Orange with pineapple (bottled).  I mixed that with some Sprite and coconut rum (a must!).  I didn't do any measuring; I just poured a little of this and a little of that and kept taste testing.  The sliced fruit floating on top made it look so pretty.  I'll definitely make this again and be sure to make more this time!!

I used lemon-lime soda with the frozen juices, and that made it so easy to drink. Also, I left out the banana liquor and grenadine. There was plenty of flavor just from the juices and soda. It was delicious though.

This was a great recipe! I just used a orange/pinapple juice from tropicana instead of the frozen stuff. and added a little more of the banana liquer and the rum. This also refrigerated well and I had some the day after as well. My boyfriends mother who never drinks had 5 cups of punch. I would definitely make again! In fact I'm back here to get the recipe for someone else.

I thought this would be a great punch to make for a party because of all the great reviews.  I tripled the serving size, and I used malibu rum like the others suggested.  Most of my guests left their glasses behind full. The complaint was toooooooooo sweet.

I served this at a party and even though I tripled the batch I still ran out early. Everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe.  I didn't use the banana liquer and did use Malibu Rum.  Very good!!

I was looking for a quick, easy punch for my Christmas party and came across this recipe.  Wow, I'm glad I did!  It's delicious.  I wound up making 3 batches and there were only 8 people drinking it!  Definitely will be making it again.  I floated a fruited ice-ring in it to make it more festive.

This was a pretty good drink. It was very sweet, so we added some vodka to it. We were all dying the next morning. If you dont want a bad hangover the next day, dont drink this - way too much mixed liquor!

I had a hard time finding pineapple juice by itself so what I ended up doing was getting bottles of fresh pineapple OJ (Dole, Simply Orange, got a few 59 oz bottles of each- basically bought every bottle in the store so we could make a ton for our party) and didn't have banana liqueur at supermarket so just bought a 1.75L bottle of Malibu and a 750 mL bottle of Bacardi dragonberry (strawberry/dragon fruit) rum, and a couple of 750 mL bottles of Kracken spiced rum. We did a few variations- everyone LOVED all of them but what ended up being the winner hands down was:

2 x 59 oz bottles of pineapple OJ
1 x 750 mL bottle of Kracken
1 x 750 mL bottle of Bacardi dragonberry(other variation used about 750 mL of Malibu, which was amazing too!)
Pour enough grenadine to turn it a pinky punch color

Now put that all in your punch dispenser and stir it up! 

3 rounds of that destroyed a party of 30 people with strong livers! It's so easy too so when the dispenser runs out, just dump it all together again, no need to measure out anything! genius! Thanks for the idea!

Made this for my party last year.  I am adding more rum to it, but it was really great.  I used have coconut rum and half regular rum.  I also used the banana liquer. It was great.  I'm making it again this year!
