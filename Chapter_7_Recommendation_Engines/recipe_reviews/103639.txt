I have been drinking this drink for years and mine has no cream or Frangelico. Mine is simply: Baileys, Vodka and Kalua. Very smooth and only need one.

Try it with Hazelnut liqueur (Frangelico) instead of Almond (Amaretto).  It's even better!

My sister introduced this drink to me.  She said that it was the white russian (ie. 2 oz. vodka, 1 oz. kahlua and 1 oz. light cream)  with 1 shot each of amaretto and frangelico.  I find this veriation refreshing.

Delicious--I used half ounces of each instead and subbed 2% milk for cream. I also topped it off with a little coca cola as well.

Loved it. Even added a picture of it. Definitely a more dessert style drink or casual drink. Reminds me of a classy Mexican Mudslide haha :) I added a little more cream, not too much more, though.

Wow you definitely only need one of these. Very good, but I found the vodka overpowered the other flavours. Next time I will cut it down to 1/2 an ounce.

Very good if you like sweet drinks. This is the perfect 'after dinner drink'.
