I found this recipe here about 3 years ago. I came here looking for an inexpensive substitute for the $4 a pound salad I used to get at a large chain grocery store. While I loved that store bought salad, it seemed a bit pricey. This was just what I was looking for. I've made this dish many times. I usually make it exactly as written. I've also made it with pecans instead of walnuts and it was just as fabulous. It has become an expected holiday dish in my family. Not only is it delicious, but it also looks very festive on my holiday table.
