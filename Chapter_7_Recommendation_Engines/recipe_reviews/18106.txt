I have been making this for years and the porportions are all wrong! 1-8 oz. block of cream cheese, at room temp 1-8 oz container of low fat sour cream 1 small pkg Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix. Whip em all up and you'll see! The directions for the crescent rolls are good, but use two instead of one. Also, DO NOT steam or cook veggies!! This one is best eaten raw!

I have been making this veggie pizza for years and it is always a requested dish at the company potluck and is always the first item gone! For the cream cheese/mayo mixture, I also add onion salt to taste along with the dillweed. I use a variety of veggies, such as broc, caulif, shredded carrots, red onion, black olives, peppers, radishes, etc.  I make it very colorful!
It can be a little tedious to cut up all these veggies, but it's very good!

This is great! I also added some shredded cheese, cut up red and green bell peppers, and a packet of dry ranch dressing. These little extra's make a big difference!!

I have made this for years, I like to add ranch dressing mix to the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.  Kinda "kick it up a knotch"!

Perhaps it was the lowfat options, but this didn't turn out nearly as well as other recipes I've tried.  Took it to a party, and noticed most people took one bite and tossed the rest.

I made this as written and it was so bland. It just had no flavor. Thank you for the recipe though.

This recipe was fabulous, although I found that I didn't need to use as much sour cream/cream cheese mixture.  Also, if you don't like the texture of plain old dill weed, try the crushed kind-- same taste, no pine-needle texture!

This was a great recipe but there was way too much cream chz/sour cream mixture. I had to bake another roll of crescent roll dough to make it work.
