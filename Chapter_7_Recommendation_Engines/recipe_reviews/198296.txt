Nice! I love pears and blue cheese together. My pears were a bit under-ripe, so I did have to grill both sides of them to get them to the texture I wanted. I used Louisiana Hot Sauce and it gave a nice little kick. I served them on mixed greens with citrus vinaigrette and toasted pecans. Lovely! Thanks for the recipe!

These were so good. Not too overpowered from the cheese and they had that extra bite from the hot sauce. I just cooked mine slowly on the BBQ with the lid down and they were cooked perfectly after 15 minutes.

Wonderful!  I didn't add the butter to the bleu cheese.  I just brushed each pear half with the hot suace/oil mixture and added the bleu cheee to the cavity.  I broiled them in my oven for about 15 minutes about 6 inches from the heat.  Genius idea, Beth - Thanks

I do not think the hot sauce infuses or adds to the pear. They seem disjoint.

Did not use butter.  Coated the whole pear.  Added added 1/4 inch of dark brown sugar to top, and cooked slowly on outer area of grill.  Wonderful!  Thanks!

This was good.  I served it with grilled shrimp.  There was something lacking, but probably not due to the recipe.  My pears were not very sweet, will try a sweeter variety next time. (and there will be a next time) Also, the skin charred but the pear didn't soften as much as I would've liked. Maybe my heat was too high? and maybe brush oil or mixture on the skin as well.

A very interesting dish. Very surprising, simple and delicious!!! I did them under the broiler. I used blue cheese but they would be amazing with goat cheese too!

delicious!  my pears didn't get quite as soft as I would have liked but I think the heat was too high on the grill.  It was very yummy and not spicey (which I was afraid of since I don't like spicey foods)

Wow!  What a plesant surprise of flavors.  I don't usually like pears.  I joined a co-op and received pears that needed to be addressed immediately.  I found this recipe and tried it out.  It's fantastic!

These turned out great!!

Did it a second time and put the blue cheese on right away, made sure they stayed level, and cooked them on the grill covered until he skin turned crispy and the Blue cheese was completely melted and changed the flavor - yummy

I am a fan of neither pears nor blue cheese, but this is amazing! I use Madam Janette's papaya pepper sauce. My husband is the grill meister.

I love pears and blue cheese, but all I could taste was a grill flavor and the blue cheese.  The pears seemed to get totally lost.

I liked these better than my husband but I have to agree with him that there is something needed to bring the flavors together.  It seemed I was simply eating a pear following a hot wing.  The flavors need a common denominator like ....bacon bits?  Caramelized onion?  Not sure what I would add but I will continue experimenting

Very good. I don't feel the hot sauce added anything. I also don't feel mixing the blue cheese with butter was necessary, I won't bother next time. Thanks for the recipe.
