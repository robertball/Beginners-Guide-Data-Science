This was so easy and so delicious.  I only made a couple of changes.  Instead of using an orange & a lemon, I used 1/4 cup lemon juice...and used Splenda instead of Equal.  I peeled the apples (I'm sure any cooking apples will do), mixed them with the other ingredients, put them in the oven and went for a long walk.  When I came back, my house smelled wonderful and the dish was almost done.  After stirring in the sweetener, I tasted the applesauce while warm -- and MMMMMMMMMM!!!!!  So good!  The best I've tasted.  Our younger daughter especially loves it too.  A keeper!!!!!!!
