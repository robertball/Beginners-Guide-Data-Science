Easy recipe, no time at all to put together and tastes fantastic. Probably the best tasting egg salad ever.  My friend loves it and asked for it again. This is my second time making it, and since I've got pesto frozen, it's a cinch to put together.  I'm off dairy like the other reviewer, so there's no parm in my pesto. Don't even miss it since my ingredients are fresh from my garden and so tasty. Thanks t-licious for this recipe!

This is a refreshing change from the usual egg salad. I cut the recipe in half because Hubs doesn't care for egg salad. Since milk products and I don't get along, I used a non-dairy substitute for the parm. Will definitely make it again
