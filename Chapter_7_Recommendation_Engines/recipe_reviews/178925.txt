Really good! I used fresh spinach, about 3 cups or so (the amount of basil you'd use in a typical recipe) and used less liquid (about 1/2 the amounts, eyeballed it) since the fresh spinach has a good amount of moisture. I added a tbsp of dried basil, and salt and pepper to taste. If you've had pesto before, you know how you like it. :) This pesto is so good, and I love that I didn't have to spend a ton on fresh basil. I'll definitely make this again.

Outrageously good. Made a batch left out the cheese and froze in ice cube trays and then bagged in the freezer.  Add the cheese and thinned a bit with water before serving.  Tossed w/shrimpand pasta

Awesome pesto recipe. I had no idea pesto could taste this good without basil. I didn't have any almonds in the house, so I substituted toasted pecans. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing and the pesto came out great.

I made this and absolutely loved it. I cooked the spinach myself so I used a bit of cooking water instead of the broth(less sodium!). Added a bit of nutritional yeast, and about a cup of silken tofu because I like creamy sauces!!

The recipe made a LOT of the pesto, too much. And it was like eating pureed spinach. Did not taste the almonds or (expensive) pine nuts.

I substitute pine nuts with roasted walnuts but followed the recipe exactly. Absolutely love the subtle creamy texture of the pesto! I'll definately make it again. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best recipe!  I'm a vegetarian so I had to use vegetable stock instead and I think I added maybe 2 or 3 times as much as called for to make it less thick.  The only 2 things I can add to the instructions is to make it ahead of time due to having to prep some of the items and to make a double or triple batch so that you have plenty left over to freeze!  Man this was good!

I loved this recipe! I just made tiny changes--used a 10 oz bag of fresh spinach, a whole lemon's worth of juice (I love lemon), salt & pepper, and served with with roasted cherry tomatoes and sauteed chicken over flax seed spaghetti. It was a huge hit, VERY easy and quick, and made a large amount. Freezes well, we will definitely be adding this into the rotation!

My whole family loved this! It does make a whole lot of pesto though and it needed extra broth and oil as it was too dry to begin with. The flavor was great though!

Delicious! Had a large bag of fresh spinach to use before it went bad, gave this pesto lovely body. I didn't have lemon juice so I skipped it. Will make this a go-to recipe for sure. I used it with whole wheat spiral pasta

Loved this pesto! I also subbed roasted walnuts for pine nuts, fresh spinach for frozen, and added onion powder, salt, pepper, and extra roasted garlic. I eyeballed all of the amounts, but it came out great! Thanks for the recipe!

HaI thought this recipe was bland and tasteless.  Maybe I didn't roast the garlic enough.  I added extra cloves and a bunch of spices, including pepper flakes to try to fix it.
