Great recipe! I substituted 2 TBS of plain Greek yogurt for the oil - turned out nice and moist.

Yummy recipe, my wife, four kids and I loved it. I used the blender to make oat flour and used half oat flour and half regular flour. Next time I am going to cut the brown sugar in half and likely use whole wheat flour and oat flour with no chocolate chips or whipped cream and it should be a pretty healthy pancake recipe.
