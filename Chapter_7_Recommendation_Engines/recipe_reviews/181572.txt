I made this recipe with leftover holiday turkey. It was incredible! Definately not bland but not too spicy either... even my kids loved it!

Just made this with turkey leftovers. I prepared with all ingredients. The peppers are not too much! Delicious!

This was pretty good.  I wasn't convinced that I should add 2 whole jalepenos and that was a mistake.  Next time I will follow that.  I did add just a little more broth but otherwise this was a really good recipe.  I don't like turkey much and I ate a huge serving.

This was fabulous!  I had to modify a bit because I didn't have peppers or jack cheese.  I just added crushed red pepper at the end and I grated extra sharp white cheddar directly into my bowl.  This is my NEW favorite chili!

Delicious! I needed a recipe to give me something to do with the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I used the leftover meat, which was mostly dark meat, and less than choice cuts, and this recipe had enough flavor to bring life back to even the week old pieces of picked over turkey. The only thing I didn't do in this recipe were the beans, because my husband hates them.  I definitely think it would have made the recipe even better, but it was hearty and flavorful without it.

Didn't have lime juice but really liked it anyway! Dumped everything in the crockpot and used up the last of our Thanksgiving turkey. Also tore our no-longer-so-fresh biscuits up and added them in...awesome :)

This was excellent and such a change of pace for the Thanksgiving left-over turkey.  I had "Fire and Ice" white wine with jalepeno on hand.  Yummy!  I forgot to add the lime juice but it was awesome just the same.

I've made this several times and it's always very popular.  When no left over turkey is available, I saute ground turkey and toss in the last 10 minutes.  I've also added a can of Rotel for variety.  Very uncomplicated, quick recipe with wonderful flavors.

I made this recipe with chicken, and probably had too high of expectations since I was hoping to copy a soup that won our town's annual soup contest.  But I found this soup a little bland (and yes I know white chillis tend to be a bit on the bland side).  

I tried to improve it by adding cilantro, some crushed red pepper & chilli powder, and more lime.  It improved the soup, but it still wasn't quite what I was hoping for.  It is pretty good, just not a blue ribbon winner.

Very tasty.  We recommend stirring in fresh salsa when serving for some contrasting textures.  Also, I only included about half of the jalapeno seeds (but all of the actual pepper flesh) and it was still quite spicy, especially the next day after the flavors had a chance to develop.

I thought it had too much onion...next time I will use just a half of a med. onion.  I also added a small can of green chiles and about 6 oz. corn b/c I thought it was just a tad bit bland for us, but great recipe for the kids...just add the chiles and jalapenos after serving the kids.  I also cooked it in a slow cooker on low for a few hours.  I always like chili in the slow cooker.

Delicious.  I've made this many times, I don't use wine so I doubled the broth and it worked well.  I also use pepper jack cheese for an extra kick.  We love it and this recipe has become an after holiday favorite at our house.  I even used it for a freezer exchange group,  followed the directions up to the cheese.  Had my friends heat it and add their cheese and lime juice and it was fantastic.  We always double it as well.

So fantastic! The flavor is very full and well rounded. I made it just the way it was written and it was delicious. You could also add pretty much any veggies you want. I'm going to make another batch and freeze it for later.

It was good. I added a drained and rinsed can of green chilies.  I didn't have an lime juice, but I'm sure it would have helped the flavor.  I cut the onions to 1 cup because I was worried 1 1/2 cups would be a problem. I should have used all the onions.

Always a good recipe. I use fresh white beans (available in season here in Taiwan) instead of the canned kind, and lemon juice instead of lime juice. It's my go-to chicken chili recipe.

Delicious, but I made some changes. I cooked a lb of ground turkey separately. In the pot w EVOO I added a diced bell pepper in with the onions & garlic, then deglazed that with 1 cup white wine; to which I added the seasonings the recipe called for and:  1 small tomato paste, 1 small tomato sauce, a can of diced tomatoes, a can of partially drained chili beans,  3/4 c of chili powder, & then increased the broth to about 2 cups. After simmering 5 min I stirred in the turkey & cooked it on med low for about 20 min. or more. Super flavor served with cheese at the table, cilantro & hot rolls or tortillas. Thanks!

Great for leftover turkey.  Made 2 substitutions due to what I had on hand.  Vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and topped with white cheddar in place of Monterey Jack.  Tasted great without the cheese too.

I made this with no changes, using leftover deep-fried turkey, and it was awesome!  I used 1 can (about 1-3/4 cups) of no-salt-added beans to let the more subtle flavors of lime and spices come through.  The second time I made this, I used leftover rotisserie chicken -- awesome again!  (I WILL wear rubber gloves next time I clean and chop my jalapenos though... ouch!)

I used Northern  white beans, 3 slices of swiss cheese that I cut into pieces, along with the cheddar cheese. This is a great recipe for people on a Southbeach diet.

I didn't have jalapenos on hand so for the kick I used Pepper Jack cheese instead of regular Monterey jack cheese. I also added about 2c broth instead of 1/2 cup, which seemed too little for a 6-serving recipe. This is a quick dish with a lot of flavor. I'll return to this one frequently - FANTASTIC!

Really good. Made it without the jalapenos and cheese and still delicious.

Just made this and my picky vegetarian daughter and my super picky hubby LOVED it. I did leave out the turkey and subbed the chicken broth for vegetable stock. I also didn't have the jalapenos so I added a pinch of Badia Curry Powder and a pinch of Cayenne and a dash of celery salt too. I reduced the cheese too to a half block of cheese and shredded some for garnish along with fresh cilantro leaves. 2nd round: subbed sherry for white wine. Added 1 extra can of beans 1/2 red bell pepper 1/4 cup chick broth 1/2 cup red onion.  Hubby loved.

This was very good.  I used ground turkey.  I didn't have fresh jalapenos on hand, so I just used part of a small can as I didn't want it too spicy for my kids.  Everyone loved it.

I made some changes....I know that the white chili can be bland and several reviews mentioned that. Outside of the ingredients, I used ground turkey, extra cumin, three jalapeños and a splash of white balsamic...that was the little extra zing that really made this recipe for us.  It was spicy and flavorful. That made this a five star keeper. The next morning I a bit of green chili salsa and eggs......yum!

I wasn't expecting to like this recipe so much. I used ground turkey, omitted the cheese for dietary reasons, added a large roma tomato and cilantro.... Perfect!

I made the following substitutions/eliminations based on what was available in my kitchen :)
Skipped cumin and bay leaf because we didn't have any. 
Skipped white wine and instead added 2 cans of chicken broth. 
Used lemon juice instead of lime. 
Used mild cheddar instead of Monterrey jack. 
And used regular kidney beans instead of white.
It was AMAZING! Used up the rest of the Thanksgiving turkey and had dinner and lunch for the next day. Definitely recommend!

A bit bland...I had to doctor this up quite a bit.  I will be returning to my tried and true chili recipes.

Best white chili I have ever made.  I doubled the redipe and used ground chicken with the turkey.
