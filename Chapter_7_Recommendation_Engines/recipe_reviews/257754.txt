You talk about quick and simple! These were good. The cook time is perfect for the alcohol to cook off but because of the way it is cooked you really only get the flavor in the veggies. Next time  I make this I'll let the shrimp sit in a little tequila and lime for those 5 minutes the onions are cooking . This is a good recipe though and one I will make again.

I always go with steak fajitas, but WOW this was amazing! I enjoyed how easy it was to cook! Included red bell peppers, shredded cheese, and sour cream on a tortilla roll and used Jose Cuervo Especial as the tequila! Muy Caliente!
