This is as good as it sounds, delivering a deliciously spicy and creamy mac â€˜n cheese. The bacon and the chipotle pepper are a beautiful couple. The bell pepper is a very nice addition. Thank you for the recipe.

Easy dish to make during the week and also to freeze which comes in handy for us when we get busy. Can't go wrong with bacon, cheese and chipotle. Will make again!

We made a couple of changes. We used fresh roasted peppers,  rotini pasta, and left out the bacon.  It was  really good with the fresh peppers.  My husband loved it and we will definitely be making it again.  I  only  gave it four stars because it uses heavy cream and in the future  I would figure out a good alternative to the heavy cream.  Otherwise it was very tasty.

I made this for visiting family and everyone really enjoyed the flavor but the feedback from everyone was that the texture of the sauce wasn't quite right.    I think next time I'd leave out the flour portion and add a little velveeta for that classic, thick and creamy Mac and cheese texture.    I used two chipotle peppers and the flavor was spot on!
