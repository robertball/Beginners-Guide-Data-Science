This is my favorite "traditional" potato salad recipe.  I love all the stuff in it, and the dressing is a bit lower in fat ;)  My only complaint is that it takes me longer than 45 min of cook/prep time and I use drained sweet pickle relish instead of chopping the sweet pickles.  It makes a large amount, more than the recipe says it serves, but can be cut in half for a family of four with leftovers the next day.

I was looking for a Mustard-type potato salad and this is the "first" one that I came across.  I added a bit more mustard for taste and for ease of preparing, i julienned the potato on a Pampered Chef slicer.  The taters had a bit less texture to them, but boiled a lot faster.  

All in all, I was very pleased with this recipe, but you will probably need to add salt at the table.  Slim down on the celery if the majority of your family isn't celery lovers.

This recipe actually feeds more than what it says - i have half a bowl left over.  Also, if you have the time and the room, make this dish 2 days before to make sure all the flavors blends.  I made this 24 hours ahead of time, but it was even better Monday!

I didn't make 12 servings because I only had 4 potatoes. I kind of guessed at the proportions. Very tasty. I still like mom's potato salad made with onions and cucumbers but hubby is from the South and he grew up on this sort of relish/ mustard type of potato salad. He loved it. Much better than the store bought versions. Sweet (and dill) pickle salad cubes are sold in the South commonly alongside of the relish and used in salads often. Don't overdo the pickle cubes I thought the proportion in the recipe was a bit much. You can leave out the sugar too, sweet enough without it.

Great recipe!  We don't like celery or sweet pickles, so I used dill pickle relish and dill weed instead.  Also added sliced black olives and green onions.  Disappeared right quick, it did!

I made this recipe for a camping trip.  I needed to add much more mayonaise to cover the potatoes.  I used about an entire small jar of mayo. Instead of relish I used bread-n-butter pickes that I chopped and also used the same pickle juice.  I also substituted a red bell pepper instead of the green pepper.  After much doctoring and adding more sugar and mustard the end result was a wonderful creation!!  Everyone loved it!!  I now have a great recipe of my own thanks to using this one as a guide.

This wasn't a hit with our family.  We prefer a more creamy potato salad and it had a little too much relish/pickle for our liking.  I won't make it again.

A tasty recipe that had everyone going back for seconds both times I've made it.  People were surprised to hear that relish (I used relish instead of cubes) provided most of the flavor.  Will make again.  Thanks, Ellen!

This is just like the salad I make except that I add sliced green olives and diced cucumbers and omit the green peppers, and I add a little more mayo.

If there were 10 stars, that is what I would rate this potato salad.  I will forevermore make my red potato salad this way.... the only changes I made were that I used my homemade sweet relish (pint) and a tbs of horseradish... I am taking it to our family gathering this p.m. and I want to thank Rianeyjr for sharing this inspirational recipe...

This was the first time I made a potato salad and I thought it was great. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and doubled the sauce. I also added some paprika. I think next time I will add some other spices to perk it up a bit, but I was glad I chose this recipe for my first attempt...thanks!

This was too bland for my tastes, but it had all the major ingredients for potato salad, so we added spices to make it more to our taste.

Somebody got a little too crazy with the pickles!!!  You don't even need half of them!  You DO need a couple more chopped eggs, a little Miracle Whip and about a tablespoon of dill weed.  I don't put pickles in my potato salad at all, but for you who like them, go ahead.  I'd rather put them on the burger.

Very bland if made exactly according to directions.  Add more mustard for taste than it's fine.

Thought this was very good. I agree the pickle (I used pickle relish) added to the flavor.I also added a tsp. of vinegar. Have been making potato salad for years and this was the best batch! Don't you just love it when people practically make over the recipe then review it ? Wish they would get a clue! Dah!

This is exactky how my mom made hers. Dice the veggies instead of chopped. Some say it's bland you can use garlic wine vinegar and dill pickles. I personnally don't like my potato salad too mayo and 3/4 cup is plenty for me. Oh, try using vidailla onions.

I made this potato salad for a large gathering at our church and had soooo many compliments on it.   One guy even told me he usually HATES potato salad, but put some on his plate anyway...he ended up asking me for the recipe!   Love, love, love this version.

Ok, I forgot to get the pickles, but I still don't think this would have helped out. I mean, it was OK, no one complained however for the amount of labor involved, I expected this to be a WOW. Would not make again.

Everyone raved about this potato salad.  I did add more mayo and mustard than called for to make it creamier.  Will definitely make this one again. The pickles add a great taste to it as well.

This was a big hit with my elderly residents, reminding them of an old favorite.  I used regular potatoes that were on sale instead of the red ones.

A great beginning to make your own custom potato salad.  I added bacon, used dill pickles instead of sweet relish.  I also left out the green pepper & used half the amount of onion.

A very good salad.  Many people were coming back for seconds.  My changes... more sauce, dill rather than sweet pickles, and I added dill pickle juice to the sauce.  Thanks for giving me a place to start!

Needs a few tweaks to rate a 5 but not bad for a substitute to grocery store potato salad.

I used a 3 lb. bag of potatoes, so reduced the ingredients accordingly. I used only about 3 baby dills as I don't care for sweet pickles, and added a little sprinkle of dill along with a splash of the dill pickle juice. Absolutely fantastic! Thank you Ellen!

YUMMY!!!  I followed the directions exact and also added olives and an extra egg.  I ended up adding a little more mustard and a dash more of mayo, but we like it a little runny, I think it was actually perfect the way it was written!!! Thanks for this summertime staple!

excellent! As a newlywed and new cook, I am always looking for new recipes that are easy AND tasty - this is one of them! Got rave reviews from my husband and friends, and is nearly foolproof! I definately recommend this potato salad!

I just used this for a college social party. I made one recipe
and it was absolutely huge. I couldn't even mix it in one bowl
bec it was so big. I had to add more mayonnaise to make it work....I'm not sure if the relish made it more watery at first  or if I didn't drain the potatos enough. I would say that I had upwards of 22 servings. My fiance really liked it.
He thought it looked strange bec I diced the potatos rather fine . It was easier to serve and eat with smaller potato
cubes.

I only changed this recipe slightly.  I did not have any sweet pickles on hand so I used chopped dill pickles instead.  I also didn't have any celery and added extra red bell pepper to go along with the green.  The sauce overall was bland to me.  I added some finely chopped garlic and a little dill seasoning.  This turned out quite good!

Of course I added the spices I like and Miracle Whip for half the Mayonnaise.  Everyone loved it but mom, who likes a more dry traditional potatoe salad.

This tastes just like the Costco Potato Salad which is my favorite. I added paprika and celery salt at the end and I added only 3 tablespoons of relish. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is something like my potato salad but I add sour cream.  No pickles.  Also garlic wine vinegar.  Celery seed also.  I have people begging me for the recipe.

I didn't care for this potato salad recipe at all.  It was a bit too tangy for me - and my potatoes were "mushy".  I prefer a more "classic" recipe made with chopped egg, sweet or dill pickles, celery, fresh herbs, a little mustard and mayonnaise.  I halved the recipe and it STILL made a lot.  I don't think I'll be making this one again...  Sorry!

I usually prefer my potato salad plain (with just mayo, mustard, & pickles) but I was serving this to company and didn't want it to be bland.  I sauteed my onions, bell pepper, and celery because I don't care for the flavor of raw onion.  I left out the sweet pickle and added dill pickle...Sprinkled with paprika and walla! instant hit!

A nice, basic potato salad. I used red pepper instead of green and found that i needed to add some pickle juice before I served it in order to moisten it.

a simple, classic potato salad - I skipped the relish and mustard (personal preference) and added extra salt.  It was fabulous - nothing fancy , just classic.  perfect.

I made boiled potatoes for dinner last night & boiled the whole 5 lb bag.  I found this today.  Our standard pot. salad has mustard, miracle whip and eggs w/celery seed.  These reviews were encouraging so I tried it.  Hubby is not much of a pot salad man, but he did say this is probably the best pot salad he's ever tasted.  I added everything in moderation.  I had about 3 lbs of pot, added 2 eggs (I looked up mrbreakfast.com for proper egg cooking instructions lol)1/4 of a lg red onion, 2 kitchen tspns of sweet pickle relish, and the bottom 1/3 of a huge green bell pepper.  I added 2 or 3 rubber spatula sized dollups of miracle whip and just squeezed enough mustard in until it looked "right".  It's all really what your tastes are.  I had no celery, so didn't add any.  No sugar needed.  Used my egg slicer to cut up my eggs - just manuvered them as I went.  Not as long as the Ready In time said for me :0)  I will put this in the cookbok!  Thanks

This actually came out pretty good!  I was a bit skeptical because of all the ingredients that went into this.  I'm use to good old fashion potato salad and never had any with peppers or sweet pickles.  I used 3 celery stalks instead of 4 (we're not big fans of celery) but I actually didn't even taste it in the potato salad.  I also increased the mustard to 2 tablespoons and increased the mayo to 2 cups - we like mayo :)  I only used 1/2 onion because it was a sweet onion and was a fairly large one.  Lastly, I used 2 tsp white sugar.  It was really good.  I think the sweet pickles and mustard made a huge difference in this salad.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for a great recipe Ellen!

Great recipe! I had to add A LOT more Mayo and Mustard to make it the way I like it=creamy :)

I also didn't add the green pepper....that would be way too crunchy for us.

Definitely worth a try and tweak it to your tastes.

This was really good.  I added a few more eggs and used dill pickles and a little dill in the dressing.  I doubled the dressing and put 1/2 on when first made and added more at serving time.  That way it really picks up the flavor and it is creamy when you serve it.

Red potatos are perfect for this. The little tiny ones you can half or quarter. I leave out the mustard and add sour cream and chopped green olives. Adding a little olive juice gives it another layer of flavor too.

excellent start. proportions a little bit off so I tweaked them a little. I also am not a fan of sweet pickles so I omitted those, added a mish mash of my favorite spices and it was excellent.

Made this for a potluck affair. Made about 7 lbs of spuds so had to tweek recipe. Thought 16oz. sweet pickle sounded like too much so I used appx 6oz "DILL" relish. I doubled the mustard and added more mayo as needed. This was the first empty tray on the table. Also add crumbled bacon if you can. Thanx

I was so excited to try this recipe!  With 84 reviews and 4.5 stars, I figured I couldn't go wrong...but I did!

This is really a very B-L-A-N-D potato salad!  I followed the recipe as instructed, except I used sweet pickle relish rather than cubed sweet pickles.  It looked too dry, so I added more mayonnaise and then tasted it.  It was SO bland!  So, I added a little more black pepper, and a healthy amount of celery seed and paprika.  I still found it just "missing something," so I added a little more mustard.  No dice.  Finally, because someone here mentioned she had done so, I put a little red wine vinegar in it.  That gave it a little kick, but this still is missing that "twang" I think a good potato salad should have.  Maybe it needs some DILL pickles - maybe that is what is missing.  Sadly, I won't make this recipe again.  :o(  SORRY!

Very good.  I added a dash of vinegar, less pickles and more mayo.  Make sure you let it refreigerate for a few hours before serving.

This was absolutely delicious.  It did take a long time to make, longer than I thought it would.  I would definitely make it again when I had a bit more time.  I did add some chopped fresh dill and parsley.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

red peppers instead.

A good basic recipe which is easy to modify to personel taste.  I diced up baby dill pickles and used green onions instead as well as adding a little red wine vineger to the still hot potato's.  It was very enjoyable!

This was good when you got a bite of celery & peppers with the potatoes, but otherwise the dressing was a little bland.  Pretty easy to put together,though.

This is a great recipe!!!!!!  My family loved it so much I had to promise to send a web address link to them so they could make it.  Good job!
I substituted 1 - 8oz jar of sweet relish for the 16oz of cubed sweet pickles

Very good.  I did add use dill pickles instead of sweet and red peppers instead of green (personal prefence).  Great recipe though next time I will cut down on onions.  You could taist them for a while after. :-)

I have many potato salad recipes, but I really did enjoy finding this one.  I did however use a red pepper instead of green (I just happen to like red peppers), although I am sure the green has a better flavor.

This is a really good recipe, however, I think it needs more mayo. I used the 3/4 cup called for and it wasn't enough, so I added another 1/2 cup. It tasted great, and my sister in law went back for thirds, but everyone agreed it could use a bit more mayo. Best potato salad I've tasted in a long time (and I don't like potato salad).

It's my first time to make potato salad.  The creamy texture is exactly what I love.

This is a great potato salad.  My kids like dill pickles, so I substituted the sweet pickle relish for dill pickle relish and it was still great!

Excellent.  I couldn't find the pickle cubes, so I bought sweet pickles and diced them.  I also substituted red peppers for the green ones and it was great.

This is what Potato Salad should taste like.  Also,  the instruction given on the order to make it,  very well done.  The only thing I changed was, I diced the onions, Bell Pepper's & Celery vs. "Chopped".  Just personal preference.

Just what I was looking for!  A sweet, creamy classic Potato Salad.  VERY GOOD!  Was easy to make, too.  100% better than the store bought deli stuff!  This salad will go great with my barbecue tomorrow!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My family likes "plain" potato salad.  All I use is potatoes, eggs, pickles chopped fine and according to your taste, and salad dressing instead of mayonnaise.  Salt and pepper to taste. I always get favorable comments.

I really love red potatoes, and this recipe is awesome.  I made a few changes such as adding a jalapeno (to taste), a 1/2 can of red beans,and a red bellpepper (delicious, and adds sweet instead of the sugar!).  I also had to up the mayo a little but halved the amt with miracle whip and mayo.  Other additions...oregano, paprika.  Just have fun with it! You can put anything in it, and it will always taste wonderful. ;)

One of the best Potato Salad recipes that I'v tried. My husband perfers less pickles- Not the whole pound jar.  Other than too many pickles it was among the best I've ever tried.

Very traditional.  To save time - I used a jar of relish and egg lands best boiled/peeled eggs.  We can't eat onion and it's full of enough flavors you don't miss it. Makes a beautiful presentation for a covered dish.

Tasty Southern style potato salad!   I didn't use quite as much relish as listed in the recipe and just added to taste.  I also didn't add sugar, but, used a mixture of mayonnaise and miracle whip for sweetness instead.   Thanks for the recipe! UPDATED: 7/6/17 I remade the recipe using making as the recipe stated with all the relish and just mayo.   I think I like it better sticking to the recipe.   I did use a red pepper because it was what I had in the house.
