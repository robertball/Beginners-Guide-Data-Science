These are to DIE for!  So rich and lovely!  I have made these twice now, and have given out the recipe many times.  People love them!  They look impressive, too - someone asked me if I had gone to a bakery to get them.  They do take a VERY long time to make because of having to wait for things to set and chill, so make sure that you make these a day or 2 ahead of when you need them - they are not something you can whip up the morning before a party.  Just a tip - I had some trouble getting the chocolate to melt to a consistency where it would drizzle prettily.  My solution - I heated a pan of water to almost boiling and then turned off the heat.  I put the white and semisweet chocolates in different Ziploc bags and placed them in the water to melt.  Once they were all melted, I cut off one corner of the bag and voila!  Chocolate drizzle!

I switched things up a bit ;o), I didn't use all the sweetened condensed milk....I used 2/3 of the can maybe 3/4. It was plenty sweet & still set up well. I used lime marmalade instead of raspberry jam & grated the zest from a lime over top. Omitted the semi-sweet chocolate & almost upped the white chocolate to compensate but didn't....was glad because it really didn't need any more. I also used chopped, toasted hazlenuts instead of walnuts. My son has declared these the best cookies I have EVER made & is begging me to make more. Although I can see how they may be too sweet w/out the tartness of the lime to counteract it. Thansk for the recipe!

These are delicious. While they're easy to make, they are a bit time consuming (do a step, wait. do another step, wait) but worth it. I took these to a friend's house this weekend and had to run home after the recipe for her aunt. My four year-old has been very helpful finishing the pan.

Take the time to toast the walnuts. It makes a difference and lends crunch. I used seedless black raspberry jam. Try them with hot or iced tea.

These are extremely sweet, but VERY good!  I lined the pan with parchment paper to make it easier to handle them when cooled.

This was good, but not great. The combination of chocolate and raspberry is A+, but I think the base could be improved upon. Next time I make this, I will make a lemon or lime pie base by mixing fruit juice in with the sweetened condensed milk so that there are interesting flavors in the base rather than a boring, overwhelming sweetness.

I have made these for a family reunion and my son's graduation open house and have had many requests for the recipe. I never have any left over.  These bars are "to die for" is what I have heard from several people.  I use seedless raspberry jam and have used chopped pecans in place of the walnuts.

These bars are very good, however, I thought they were too sweet, and I have the biggest sweet tooth ever! I made them a second time and I used a little less jam (I don't know exactly how much, I just used the rest of the jar from the first time I made these) and I mixed it with a bag of (thawed) frozen raspberries that were slightly mashed but there were still some whole pieces. It was much better! Not overly sweet yet not very tart. It was also nice having some real fruit in there, but it did made the bars a little bit messier.

Very good and nice presentation.  I thought it was good but my husband and co-workers loved it.  My only tip would be to melt the butter in the baking pan then sprinkle the graham cracker crumbs on top.   This adds ease to making and had no problems removing from pan.

This was an easy yet very impressive treat.  I'm always looking for nice looking bars and this one will go in my favorite recipe collection. It was delicious with the raspberry jam and would also be nice with an apricot jam.

These are very good and easy to make!  Will be adding these to my list of Christmas baking.  Used seedless raspberry preserves, as the seeds seemed like they would just get in the way...just a personal preference. Not having my oven on more than 20 minutes was also a plus.  We live in Florida and even though it's December 1st, the air conditioner is still crankin'!

These good but not great.  I think a 9x13 pan is too big.  The bars were very thin.  I used blackberry jam which tasted good.  I melted semi-sweet chocolate on the stove top and it was way too thick to drizzle so I tried thinning with cream.  It was better but when I took the whisk to drizzle the chocolate it just fell on the top in clumps.  I wish I would have read about the ziploc.  Maybe that would have worked better.

You'd have to be off your rocker not to expect these to be sweet, considering all the ingredients contain sugar, but holy pig choking fire hazard batman, I think I need a dentist. I'm sure if I was 5 I would be all about these, but the sweetness is just too much. I didn't think the flavors complimented each other too well either.

Very delicious and super sweet.  Though, there weren't enough graham crackers to cover the bottom of the pan, so I increased the crackers and butter to twice the amount.  I would recommend using a little less butter than graham cracker, as it somewhat overpowered the graham cracker taste.  Also, I didn't use any roasted walnuts because I had none, but the bars came out great anyway!!  Everyone enjoyed them.

Extremely sweet and extremely rich, so I'm glad I didn't use an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13 (which I often do to make cookies thicker).  These do have a lot of steps, but it's more about having the refrigerator space than the time, I guess, bc the first step is the longest and you don't have to start each step at the exact moment the recipe states.   Although I thought I had white chocolate, apparently I don't, so I just topped with melted chocolate and chocolate chips.  The chocolate chips make it a bit harder to cut, but oh well.  I cut these after the chocolate hardened but before chilling so hopefully that will address the difficulty of cutting the bars.  Thanks for the recipe!

I skipped the nuts (because I don't like them) but still quite good.  Very sweet so small servings are good.  I had problem with melting & drizzling chocolate but figured it out eventually (I melted and put into a sandwich bag with a corner cut off).  The total prep time takes a while but as long as you have time to wait between steps it's not bad.

Got many complements when I took them to a potluck, and only managed to actually snag a very tiny piece for myself at the last minute!  Extremely sweet, but okay in very small portions (what I had was enough for me).  Although good, didn't make enough of an impression on me that I would spend the time to make them again.

All the ingredients in this were good, but it didn't come together for us in taste the way it did for so many others. It tasted like each flavor was resting on top of the other. People ate it, but didn't go nuts for it. I was disappointed.

This was a hit. I doubled the amount of graham cracker crumbs and toasted the coconut. After making the coconut crust and chilling it. I added a layer of cheesecake then chilled it over night. Then continued with the next step of the recipe. Also, I used Lindt dark chocolate truffle and Lindt white chocolate truffle and melted it to pour on top. I also added dark chocolate chips. People were raving about it.

As written, the recipe is " really good!" 
Next time i make this i will double the coconut, walnuts and chocolates. I will also use parchment paper in baking pan so i have to the  out of my pan again to get the bars out at the edges. I would also add the nuts right after i place the preserves so they settle into them and don't scatter as much. These are really good though.  I'm taking them over to my mother-in-law tomorrow for mothers day.

Of course I can never just follow the recipe. I added about a cup more jam, which actually turned out to be too much. Lesson learned: stick with the recommended amount of jam. Very good, but very rich too. Be sure to grab a glass of milk with these.

I thought this was prett good but everyone who has tried it has LOVED it. The only thing I changed was that I drizzled more chocolate and white chocolate than it called for.  Be sure to pack the graham cracker mixture well into pan or its very crumbly but very easy to make.

I made these bars last night and they were great! I recommend greasing the bottom of the pan to make it easier to get the graham cracker bottom out. The raspberry preserves adds a great taste to this bar!

Snaps for Diane! This is so wonderfully sweet and chewy and chocolatly. One of the best bars I've made,it was so easy to make. I did use a high quality semisweet and white chocolate which always helps. Also, it helps to run the knife under hot water after each slice so nothing sticks to it and the rows will be much neater and easier to lift. Great recipe.

These are wonderful.  I have never had so many people ask me for a recipe.

This recipe is a nice combination of flavor, but I found the drizzled chocolate cracked up when I was slicing them.  I think if I make them again I'd drizzle chocolate butter icing instead of pure chocolate.  They wouldn't be so messy to serve.  Less raspberry filling might help too.

Although I love chocolate, coconut and raspberry, this was only 3 1/2 stars for me.  The raspberry jam seemed to overpower the bar, as well as make it too sweet and a bit messy.  These need to be cut VERY small because they are rich.  I, too, melted the chocolate in a Ziploc bag in the microwave, but I also added a tiny bit of vegetable oil, as otherwise the chocolate doesn't drizzle well.  I like the suggestion to add fresh raspberries, and I think with less jam and fresh fruit I would like these better.  I will definitely make them again and tweak the recipe, maybe trying different flavors of jam.  I had no problem with the crust, although do be sure to grease the pan.

these are lovely to look at and better to eat. Is anyone interested in getting a recipe list/book together for bars for church/community functions that ARE NOT BROWN?? I used loads of fresh raspberries the first time and put some thick jello on top. It didn't really set the fruit but it was a sensation at a funeral lunch for a church member. The 2 nd time I used jam but found it too sweet, mind you nobody else!!

Very yummy! It could probably use one more tablespoon of butter to keep the crust together. I made this in an 8x8 pan and came out with about 16 nice thick bars. I used 2/3 cup seedless strawberry jam instead of the raspberry and drizzled with a thick dark chocolate ganache to cut the sweetness that others have mentioned, and it was perfect! These are pretty gooey, but they hold together well enough to be eaten with your hands. The bars need to be chilled to get a cleaner cut, but the flavors are more prominent at room temperature, so I recommend leaving them out of the fridge before serving. Easy, impressive-looking dessert to take to a get-together.

They were so good, I could not get them off my mind for the next couple of weeks!!  The combination of raspberry, coconut and graham cracker just does something incredible to my taste buds and whatever that special something is...it makes my mouth do a happy dance like no tomorrow.

Absolutely delicious and beautiful. Simple to make yet time consuming because of all the steps. I used seedless raspberry jam and melted white chocolate chips since I had no bars. These bars were definitely a huge hit.

Excellent taste, easy to make.  My kids gobbled them up even though they insist they do not like coconut.  Added green food coloring to one of the white chocolate squares and it looks very festive.  Yummy!!

I have been making this for years.  I found the recipe in an old cookbook.  Glad to see it on Allrecipes.

Yummy, but very sweet. I used all white chocolate, no brown chocolate due to allergies. It was really good. I did use fresh berries instead of raspberry preserves. I mashed them, mixed in sugar and simmered them down. I thought the tartness was a good balance with the sweet.

OMG!!!!  Fantastic, wonderful, dangerously good....  I tried this recipe, took some over to my mom's house to share, her freind came and they had some.  Before my mom had a chance to tell me, her friend was calling me for the recipe.  That says it all.  Very simple to make also.

I made this last night but left off the semi sweet chocolate and opted to only use white chocolate.  It was easy to make and very pretty.  It was extremely rich though, a tad too much for my taste. I think the preserves I used were to blame though, will try again with different toppings.

This was not good.  It tasted liked jam smeared on top of coconut.  Maybe if I cooked it again after putting on the jam and chocolate it would be better.  I have had similiar bars without the jam and they were a lot better.

Awesome recipe! I didn't have the walnuts so I skipped them.  Still a terrific recipe.  Brought them to a church function and they disappeared.  Thanks! I'll use this again.

Made these and took them to a diner party,
not a single crumb was left!  These 
were great.
