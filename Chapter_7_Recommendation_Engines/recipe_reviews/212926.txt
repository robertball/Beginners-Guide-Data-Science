I sent my message to soon before I was able to complete it about the Corn Soup. I used Cubed Sirloin Steak cuts cut for me from Fresh Market Meat Department instead of using Pork. I used fresh SpInach and it all tasted healthy and great. Yummy

this is a great base recipe, but i wound up making a few changes to it since i'm not a fan of spinach. i used panchetta instead of pork, added black beans and diced tomatoes for a little extra flavor. otherwise, delish!

I increased the liquid to 6 cups and gave it an Asian twist by adding fish sauce, soy sauce, and some red pepper flakes.

For this recipe I used panchetta instead of pork, skipped the prawns and added in orzo. I also added a bit of smoked paprika. It was delish!
