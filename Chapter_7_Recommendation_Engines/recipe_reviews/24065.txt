These tasted just like the flavored popcorn balls I had as a child. I doubled the batch because I only had the larger size jello box. I think next time I will add another 2 cups of popcorn because I like a little more popcorn to syrup ratio. 
I found it was easiest to cover the corn with the syrup if I put the corn in a square baking pan and poured the syrup over it. The syrup goes straight to the bottom and in a regular bowl it's hard to get the stuff from the bottom to coat the top.
I used spray crisco to coat my hands so the syrup wouldn't stick to me and it was just fine.

Deeeelicious with lime jell-o!  I didn't put in the peanuts but in the future I may mix in some Fruity Pebbles cereal.  I had planned to "test drive" three popcorn ball recipes tonight(the first had melted marshmallows and I didn't like it), but I like this one so much that I'm going to go ahead and make the last batch the same but with grape.  I didn't have any problems with the balls not sticking together, you just have to spray your hands with no stick spray first.  I think around Christmas I'll try the same recipe but melt red hot cinnamon candies in with the sugars!

Omitted the peanuts out of preference, but these taste amazing, and there are so many options with the Jell-O!

I added m&m's. I kept having to oil my hands so it wouldn't stick to my gloves. I'll make them again.

it was hard to get them to stick together at first but I figured out if you let them cool and put butter on your hands it helps. I love love the way they turned out and they taste great!
