I used Splenda brown sugar blend in this recipe and pecans instead of walnuts. Once I took it out of the oven, I let it cool and then tossed in a heaping cup of organic raisins. Nice granola recipe--I was worried about using Splenda but really, it turned out just like any other granola recipe.

Nice combination of sweet and slightly salty! This was a simple recipe to throw together and it was much lower in fat than most due to it's lack of oil. I used a combination of walnuts and almonds and upped the vanilla a bit.  This was good with raisins and dried cranberries.  Delicious all by itself, but a great topper for oatmeal and yogurt!

This is my recipe, I just wanted to note that unfortunatly the salty was supposed to come from peanuts, which some how got left out of the recipe when edited. I usually use all differnt types of nuts, which didn't get included so maybe try that! :)

This was my first experience making granola and I am very happy with the results! I did make some changes based on some ideas I got from other granola recipes I read on this site. I liked the recipe because the ingredient list is short and sweet... a perfect starter recipe and most (if not all) of the ingredients can be found in many kitchens! So here's my changes: I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of maple syrup (in place of the 1/4 cup brown sugar I omitted), I used quick oats, I substituted about 1/2 cup pecans for all the walnuts since that's all I had, and viola!!! I did have to bake quite a bit longer. I checked and stirred the granola on a baking sheet every 15 minutes for about 45-60 minutes. It was chewy still when I finally took it out but it was golden brown. I left it on the counter top in the pan to cool for several hours and it got crispier and crispier. Finally I put it in a Tupperware container before I went to bed and by then it was very crispy, perfect granola!

Excellent basic granola recipe - and I love that it doesn't use oil!  I added a cup of chopped pecans to give a little variety, and used about 1 1/2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice plus 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon instead of a full two teaspoons of cinnamon.  I had trouble getting the oats to clump together, but didn't mind because the taste was so great!  Next time I make this, I might make a little more of the liquid mixture to really coat everything more thoroughly and hopefully get it to clump a little better.  My boyfriend couldn't stop eating this, and said it got rave reviews when he took it into the office!  I highly recommend this simple and relatively-healthy granola recipe!

This granola lives up to its name, as it is very sweet, and somewhat salty. I found it to be just a tad too sweet, though. I used about 2/3 cup of walnuts, and added some raisins as well. Next time, though, I am going to add all of the walnuts, because they got coated with the brown sugary coating, and toasted in the oven...so yummy! They made the granola worth eating! I don't think that I over-baked mine, but it did turn out very hard, almost too hard. The cinnamon and vanilla flavors are very strong...and I only used 1 tsp. of vanilla! All in all, this is a good recipe that I will probably make again. Thanks!

Mine turned out super sticky but to be fair I spread it WAY too thick!  It does taste awesome though.  But I would next time cut down the sugar and cinnamon.  I think it's worth a try for everyone.

This was pretty good. I like that the salty part wasn't too noticable.

This was a tough one. I really liked the flavor. Although the recipe says sweet and salty, I would not call it salty at all. I liked the combination of cinnamon with the walnuts. My main complaint was the oats are super chewy. I think it has to do with the fact there is no oil in this recipe at all. But that makes it healthier, so it is a toss up for me. Hence, the 3 stars. If I were to make it again I would add 1/2 cup oil, 1 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and less sugar. I'll have to update after these changes are made. Until, then I will still enjoy this tasty, chewy granola that is not salty.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I make some minor changes and turn this recipe into granola bars.  It's easier to grab on the go.

For starters I use a 9"x13" glass pan and use nonstick cooking spray instead of wax paper.  I'm not a fan of walnuts, so I omit those.  I use two tablespoons of honey instead of one.
After I microwave the brown sugar and water, I add all the ingredients except the rolled oats to the brown sugar-water and MIX WELL with a fork for at least two minutes , THEN add the rolled oats.  This makes it much easier to get a consistent mix.  Pour into prepared pan.  Press firmly and evenly with fork ensuring the mix gets to all corners.
After baking for 20 minutes I use a pizza cutter and cut into bars (instead of stirring) then bake for the remainder 25 minutes.
Use the pizza cutter again to make sure the bars are nicely separated and let cool completely in pan.  The bars should easily pop out with a spatula.  Be gentle not to brake the bars and put each bar in a zip-lock. For an easy "grab and go" later.

I needed something fairly healthy, crunchy, salty and sweet.  This fits the bill to a tee!  Love it!   Easy to make and tastes great, thank you so much!

I added chopped 3/4 C pecans, 1/4 C sliced almonds and 1/2 C sunflower seeds.  The quantity can be adjusted to taste.  I make it every two weeks and have it every morning for breakfast. Great in yogurt or with fruit.

I really didn't like the texture of this. It was chewy/stale because of the water versus the usual oil. The flavor was nothing to brag about either.
