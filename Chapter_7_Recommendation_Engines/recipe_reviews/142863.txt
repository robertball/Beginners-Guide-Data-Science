Sweet but not too sweet!  I love the cinnamon-lime combination.  The crunch of the coconut mingles nicely with the sticky syrup!  I'll be making this again!

I have been trying to find a recipe my grandmother had which was for coconut candies.  This was the closest I could find.  It was not the same as what she used to make but it was still very good.  We ended up eating all of them in one sitting!  BTW, I did not need a cup of water.  About a half-cup worked.

I increased the amount of cinnamon but otherwise this recipe is delicious. I had gotten a coconut just to drink the milk but I didn't want to waste the meat and this recipe was perfect, next time I buy a coconut it will be for this recipe!!!! Love it.
