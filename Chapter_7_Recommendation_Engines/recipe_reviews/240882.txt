Absolute buttery-apricot deliciousness!  I didn't use paper liners, but did butter the mini muffin cups, and they came out beautifully, no sticking whatever.  Wouldn't change a single thing. Scaled this down to 12, and these will be gone SHORTLY!   Thanks for sharing!

As far as flavor these are buttery and very sweet. Too sweet for me in fact.  A word of warning - when it says fill 3/4 full it means it.  I did do this according to the directions and still feel like I over filled them.  They boiled all over the cupcake pans and into the oven.  I would also check them at 15 and 20 minutes as this may have contributed to the problem.  I did not remove stars from the recipe for what I feel may be my error.

The result is excellent.  I have made many new friends who love these little treats.  BUT the proportions of the recipe are all wrong.  There is always just barely enough crust, and often I run out of  topping before the stated 'number of servings'.
