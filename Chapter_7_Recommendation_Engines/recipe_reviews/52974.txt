I used whole wheat flour instead of white,
3 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of 1
I replaced the molasses with equal parts of honey
and I used vanilla soy milk and they turned out great :)

I ran 5 or 6 carrots through a juicer and took the soft pulp that was left of them and used that for the carrots in this recipe. I used more spices than called for and added ginger, as well as subbed applesauce for the oil. The muffins actually are pretty good, but there's no way you get 36 out of this recipe. I only got 16 normal sized muffins, which means the calorie count is nowhere near the 87/muffin like the nutrition information claims.

This is yummy!  Not too sweet, and the carrots keep it moist.  I love that the calories are so low!!  I have used sugar twin to also, and it was still very yummy!  A keeper!

This is definitely one of the best carrot muffin recipes that I've ever made.  They were moist without being dense, even though there isn't much fat!  I would suggest upping the spices though.  Highly recommended!

I cut this recipe in half. I agree with one of the other reviewers that this needs more of pretty much everything. I kept the bare bones of the recipe the same, only using whole wheat flour, upping the baking soda to a full teaspoon and adding a teaspoon of baking powder. I used one teaspoon of SD's pumpkin pie spice and organic honey instead of molasses (I just happened to be out at the moment). I did use lowfat buttermilk, an organic egg and organic carrots and raisins. I started out with the original amount of carrots, raisins and nuts and ended up increasing the chopped carrot to 3/4 of a cup and the raisins and pecans to a half cup FOR A HALF RECIPE. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla. We don't like walnuts in this house so I used pecans. Right before baking, I sprinkled the muffins with a slight amount of sugar. These turned out almost like carrot cake. I think as a base recipe this is really great but it really does need the extra added stuff. I think had I not increased the additions, it would not have turned out as good. NOTE: For a half recipe, I got 12 medium sized muffins, not 18. 350* for 15 minutes was perfect baking time.

I was not too happy with this recipe.  The good thing about it is that it is very healthy.  It needs a little more sweetness, and a little more spice.  They are moist which I like, but not sweet enough for me.

I loved this recipe.  I put the brown over the carrots and let it bring the juice out of the carrots. This made thr muffins super moist and I do this when I make a carrot cake as well. I have no complaints on this recipe. I followed it except for the carrot soak in brown sugar...everyone love them.

This is a great recipe and a great muffin full of flavor. It's not intended to please those people who are looking for candy but rather those looking for something a bit more healthy. It is too bad those people gave it few stars because this muffin is moist and terrific. You don't have to feel bad (for those that do) when you eat it.

these were great...i made these to personal tastes by changing little things without changing the essential recipe and they were a hit even with my pickiest eater.  wrap these up individually in plastic wrap and throw em into the freezer!  microwave them until thawed or put in the fridge the night before for a quick breakfast on the run!

I agree with some reviews that this recipe needs a little bit more sugar and spice. I reduced 1 cup of flour (i used whole wheat instead of all-purpose flour) and added more sugar, cinnamon, ground ginger... and also added some chocolate chips to this recipe!

These did not have the spicy taste that I was expecting, and were of course, not very sweet at all because of the lack of sugar. Maybe they needed a few more raisins or spices to jazz up the flavor a little. I think the nuts saved the day, and I used pecans instead of walnuts.

not enough cinnamon so I added a couple more teaspoons.  I didn't have any nutmeg so I added ground cloves and some ginger.  Upped the carrots.  Otherwise they turned out fine.

Substituted whole wheat flour, 1/2 to 1/2 unbleached because I had no bran.  Also added some ginger.  A robust, moist muffin that would be great with apple or pumpkin butter - not too sweet otherwise, which I personally like.

Not crazy about them. High in fiber, so that was good, But no taste.  My husband, who is pre-diabetic, can eat them.

I bumped up the cinnamon and nutmeg a bit and am quite happy with them.  Only got 18 muffins so they would be very small if you wanted the 36.
