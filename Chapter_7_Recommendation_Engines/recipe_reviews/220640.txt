We really enjoyed this dish. I made one similar a couple of years ago and liked this one better. Next time I will reserve a bit of the cheese to sprinkle on top. Thank you for the recipe.

Every once and a while, I try to teach my Yankee roommates about the wonder of grits.  So when I came across this recipe today with a huge amount of leftover ham, it was time for another lesson!  This was really excellent and I can't think of anything to add to it as written.  Nice and creamy and delicious.  But what could be bad about cheese grits?  With ham!

This was an easy recipe.  I really like garlic flavor so I doubled the garlic powder.  It wasn't too powerful.  Great way to use leftover ham.  Smelled so good while baking in the oven.  Definitely use the green onions as it adds color as well as important flavor.

Made this recipe exactly as written for a dinner entre, it was a hit. Very good and filling, I baked mine in an iron skillet, it turned out perfectly.

Quick & easy & oh-so-tasty!   Lacking the grease4 that I get from my tater-tot hotdish though; so I added 1/4 cup margarine to 6 servings and it helped with the pot-sticking too.

We loved this recipe. So creamy and good. I added a full teaspoon of garlic powder because we love garlic, and it wasn’t too much. In addition to the green onion, I also added a little chopped green and red bell pepper just for color. I’ll make this again.

The recipe, as is, is just okay in my opinion.  UPDATE: I reheated a slice of this casserole by melting some butter in a microwave-safe dish, setting the slice of casserole in the melted butter and then heating until hot throughout. I then topped it with an over-easy egg. It was much better than alone. I will keep the recipe and try it with cooked, crumbled breakfast sausage with some added sage and more cheese and I'll be back to update at a later date.

This is a great way to use up leftover ham. I like it for dinner with a salad.

This grits bake was wonderful. I was looking for one that was quick, easy and tasty, and this is it! Most other recipes took over an hour to bake but this one's ready in less than a half hour. Will definitely make again. We used half turkey and half ham which worked just fine.
