I made it as soup and it's absolutely delicious!  My kids loved it!  I didn't use the slow cooker so we could eat sooner.  The noodles were so easy, the batter was a bit sticky but I kept adding flour until it was just right.  And they cooked up beautifully, didn't fall apart even on leftovers. I used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  Another option is to buy a rotisserie chicken, so it's already cooked, then pull the meat off and add it in the last step when putting everything together.    I recommend this soup - absolutely delicious. Yum!

This is the closest recipe I've seen to my mother's standard chicken and noodles ever. The only difference when I prepare it myself is to add a little more basil, some thyme and a bay leaf to the slow cooking chicken. This is the ultimate comfort food, and much heartier than your plain ol' chicken noodle soup. In my family, we serve it up nice and thick, over buttery mashed potatoes. Mmmm...I'm hungry for it just thinking about it.

Delicious!  The only change I made was that I used store-bought noodles instead of making my own since I was short on time.  This will be a family favorite.

I made one modification to this wonderful recipe, which is similar to one of our "old" family favorites.  Rather than use a whole chicken, which must be de-boned, I use boneless and skinless chicken breasts and thighs.  If you are in a hurry, you may partially freeze them and then easily cut them prior to cooking.

I loved this because it was so easy.  Added canned mushrooms and frozen peas during while the noodles boiled, used store-bought egg noodles and the addition of lots of spices at the end made it delicious!

I made this thinking it was going to be similar to the my traditional beef and noodles that I enjoyed as a child.  It turned out to be more like a soup than Chicken and Noodles.  It was very good but not what I anticpated.  I'll be reducing the fluids next time or cutting the onion a bit differently.

This is delicious!  I cook it whenever a family member or friend is sick and they love it.  I did have to add a little more chicken broth to make it more soupy.

This was a great recipe. I used pheasant instead of chicken. We now have a favorite after the boys go hunting. I do think that there should have been more noodles. T think that I will double the noodle recipe next time. I also used more flour and need to lay them out separately after I cut them. They all stuck together while they were drying. Still a new family favorite.

One of THE best chicken noodle soups I've ever had. I was light on the salt, only because I'm not keen on overly salty foods. I also added double the carrots and celery called for in the recipe. This was the first time I made real noodles by myself! I laugh over my hesitation to do it--it really was cake. And I'll tell you, it made the soup even better! It soaked up all the lovely flavors from the soup and just was.......so heart-healing and comforting. I'm so tickled over this recipe. This will now be my new "sick soup". Thank you, Aunt Nina! NOTE: I also used my own homemade broth. I did double the broth (at least, I didn't really measure) only because I knew the noodles would soak up a bit and I wanted a souper-soup, not just noodles and chicken.

I used dried noodles, because making my own sounds like too much hard work, what with 5 kiddies to cook for! But I have to agree with another review that the end result was quite bland, and we had to pep it up with salt/seasoning. I will stick with my good old favourite chicken & vegetable noodle soup recipe, and won't make this again. Sorry.

HUGE HIT - all 4 of my kids loved this, which almost never happens!  I added a couple of garlic cloves and bay leaves, and we are veggie lovers so I would put more carrots in it next time.  But it was wonderful to come home from work to that yummy smell and only have to boil the nooodles (used pre-made) and voila! dinner's done.  Made gravy from the broth and had plenty of chicken to have open face chicken sandwiches the next night with mashed potatoes and peas and carrots. Also had cold chicken sandwiches in the kids lunches the third day which they loved!  This was the first time I'd cooked a chicken in the crock pot and I was worried it would come out less than appetizing looking, but the skin was browned in places, and I will definately be making this again and again...

I didn't use a slow cooker.  My husband asked me to make some soup that he could bring to feed his hunting buddies.  I used a large stock pot and sauted the carrots, celery and onion until they were tender.  I added lots of garlic power, parsley, poultry seasoning and thyme to the vegies.  Then I poured in 2 quarts of chicken stock and added 4 more cups of water with 4 bouillon cubes.  I used 2 rotisserie chickens from the store.  I did make the homemade noodles, and they really made the difference.  My family loved it!  My husband made us hold back so he could bring the rest up north.  The guys all asked for the recipe to bring home!

I have been making this for years, it is comforting and takes time to make. My dear husband now gets upset when I try to short cut with dried egg noodles!  He has become quite partial to the noodles from this recipe. I use 2 cups of flour and canola oil instead of shortening.  Also, BLSL chicken breasts have proven a little more kid friendly over the years.  Do not skip the white wine and add 1 TB of rubbed sage, you won't be sorry!
I hope this recipe adds comfort to your family in the same way it comforts mine.
Thank you Diana (and Great Aunt Nina!)

This was good and I loved making homemade noodles (I've never done that before).  I also enjoyed using the whole chicken.  That gives such nice flavor.  I think I would probably not make this again.  It was quite a bit a work for the end product.  Like I said, it was good but really just not worth the effort.

This is a great recipe but as I wanted this as a soup I did make a few changes.  I used fresh vegetables (Celery, Onion, Carrots and Haricot Verts) Sauteed these for about 10 minutes with garlic and black pepper until just softened. I did not make the noodles due to lack of time so used mini pasta which I added to the crock-pot uncooked 2 hours before serving. Also used 6 chicken breasts and 6 cups of stock which I added to the crock pot right at the start of cooking along with 1 teaspoon basil and two bay leaves.  Needed to add plenty of ground black pepper for my families tastes but this was so good and incredibly easy to make.  Will certainly be using this recipe again.

I did stick as close to this recipe as possible-making the homemade noodles (they really aren't that hard and taste so good!) but-I did sub chicken bouillion and water for the white wine and used 4 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts for the whole chicken.  After the chicken cooked, I just shredded it, added it back to the crock pot with a large can of creme of chicken soup since my kids like it creamy.  I also added a cup of peas because we like them. It was AWESOME fixed this way and my kids were just happy to come home and find this soup in the crock pot everytime I made it this winter-which was at least every other week.  Thanks for the keeper recipe.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe considering all the glowing reviews. I found it to be a very bland, hearty chicken soup. After I had cooked the noodles (I used packaged egg noodles as opposed to making my own), and added the veggies and chicken, I tasted it and found it very lacking.  I added more salt and pepper, garlic powder and thyme. These additions helped, but not enough. I think the recipe needs more veggies too.  If I made it again, I'd double the carrots.  I added about 1 c. of peas when I added the chicken to the broth. We have plenty of leftover which I'm sure we'll eat, but I'm not sure I'd need to make this dish again.

This was really fantastic!  I've tried several chicken and noodle recipes, but this beat them all.  I think the wine really enhanced the flavor, and I was worried that it would be greasy but it wasn't at all.  I used only one onion and made my noodles with just 2 eggs and a cup of flour, but otherwise followed the recipe and it was fabulous!  Thanks for sharing!

My family really liked this (we too did not make the noodles). This is a really good crock pot meal when there are so few. We used frozen chicken breasts and extra chicken broth in place of the wine.

Absolutely divine!!  My picky children loved this too.  I had never made homemade noodles before and I'm sorry I did not start sooner.  I did use a different noodle recipe, though.  I wonder if the Great Aunt recipe has a mistake in the flour measurements for the noodle part.  Other than that, the rest of the recipe worked like a charm.  This is a keeper!  Delicious, stick-to-your-ribs yummy.  Worth the effort.

I've made this several times & it's divine. To simplify things I substituted boneless skinless chicken breasts for the whole chicken (I hate the mess of removing the chicken from the slow cooker & picking it off the bones). This was also my first attempt at homemade noodles, they were easier to make than expected, they turned out great & they are very much worth the effort. I tried it once using some good quality packaged noodles but they couldn't compare so I went back to making the noodles as called for in this recipe.

This is delish, my family asks for it all the time (hubby and three kids).  I think it's important to use a pinot grigio. I also used store bought noodles but I definately want to make my own when I have more time.  I am not a fan of cooked carrots so I left all the veggies big, while shredding the chicken, I didn't return the veggies and it was GOOD!!! I think you NEED to use a whole chicken since the bones add more flavor. I usually start it in the morning before I go to work and just cook the noodles when I get home, great home cooked meal on a work night.

used a differnt homemade noodle recipe, but the process being the same. Additions: since I didn't keep the seasoned skin in my soup, I did add extra salt/pepper to the broth when putting together the finished product. Also added a few shakes of tarragon to the chickn in the slow cooker. My chicken was in the cooker at 1pm on low, and by 5pm, I was able to take out my 6lb chicken, fully cooked, to finish the recipe. So even if you're low on time, or get started late, this can be ready by 6.

Used frozen chicken breast and store bought egg noodles that I already had in the pantry. I missed the part that said to add more broth for soup, so I thought it needed more liquid. Could also use more carrots and less celery. Good for a chilly autumn day.

This recipe is excellent and very easy. I used a whole chicken and removed the meat from the bones while I was cooking my noodles (I cheated and used dried egg noodles). It really didn't take much longer to do it this way, and it's cheaper too. I also added peas per another review, as well as an extra carrot. Next time I will reduce the number of onions and maybe add a bay leaf to the crockpot. Otherwise, this recipe is spot on. My husband loved it!

I followed the recipe until I got to adding the broth when I found out I only had 1/2 the amount needed.  Then I halved the noodle recipe.  I like my soup thicker so I added some flour/water mixture just to thicken up the broth.  I saved out half the chicken and made chicken salad.  Win win all around!

This was very yummy!! I made boxed noodles because of time.  This will be our new chicken noodle recipe.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast that were partially defrosted and 8 hours in the crockpot and it was all cooked to perfection.

I just loved the noodles!  I used to buy the frozen ones at the store, but am trying to make as much at home as possible.  I always thought noodles were difficult to make, but these were fairly simple.  They taste better than store bought, too.  This will definitely be one of our new comfort foods.

This was good. I followed the recipe exactly. Since it's not "soupy" it almost has a creamy texture the next day. So I think it will replace my previous creamy chicken noodle soup recipe because this one is healthier since it doesn't include whole milk. It was salty though, next time I won't add salt since the broth has so much.

Good. Very similar to Pennsylvania Dutch Chicken Pot Pie. I made the noodles, but found that needed more flour. One cup (as per recipe) only yielded a batter consistency, so added approx.2 more cups of flour and got really good noodles. In fact, I liked the noodles best!

This is an easy, forgiving, and delicious recipe. My husband and I loved it!  The broth is very tasty and simple. I forgot to make the noodles ahead of time(really, they're dumplings), but they were fine. I used butter to grease the cutting board.  I had to add a lot more flour than called for, but just kept adding till the dough it was workable. Maybe because eggs are bigger these days than in Aunt Nina's.

'My best soup ever' from my 11 year old & husband.

I cooked it on high for 4 & low for 3. Added a slash more wine at the beginning. I used store bought noodles.  
I only had 4 small cans of stock....it could have used more.

Excellent recipe!  I followed exactly with the exception of adding a garlic clove.  I had trouble making the noodles as directed and had to keep adding flour.  (It was my 1st time making noodles.)  Next time I'll know to use lots more flour and roll them out on a floured board.  Thank you for the recipe Diana!

This was delicious and so easy! I changed it by using chicken tenders and breasts and I diced the vegetables and used chicken broth instead of white wine. Also I cooked it on High for about 4 hours instead, as I didn't have 8 hours and was using boneless chicken. It was fabulous! My hubby loved it too. I will be making this again.

This was excellent!  I found it was plenty done in about 6 hrs.  The chicken was falling apart.  First time I have ever made any kind of noodles.  It was fun!  Everyone loved it! I definitely will make it again!

This was great - my 5-year old had fun helping with the noodles and we enjoyed their hearty, almost dumpling-like size.  I used half whole-wheat flour for the noodles.  If I make it again I will probably leave out the wine as it didn't seem to add much (cheep,old wine in the fridge could have been the problem).  Also, I used breasts and thighs I had on hand but can't wait to make another batch with a whole chicken.  Very hearty and good. I added enough water to make it a soup.

Unbelievably down-home good. The chicken stew recipe I have always sought. The only slight change I made was to add a bit of Wondra flour to thicken the end product because that was a preference I have, but otherwise, this was great. A filling, satisfying, INEXPENSIVE meal. Plenty of leftovers!

This is a great winter treat.  I didn't change a thing, a rarity for me, and I won't in the future.  I brought this to work with me for a ladies luncheon.  I wish I had a camera rolling when people took that first spoonful-priceless.

This recipe was phenomenal! I've never made homemade soup before, and not only was this incredibly easy but my house smelled great all day. I made it on a stormy night and the combo of shredded chicken and thick noodles warmed us right up and had the PERFECT flavor. So delicious-can't wait to make it on the next rainy evening!

I was very impressed with this dish...and with myself.  I actually made the homemade noodles and they were wonderful.  I expected them to fall apart when I cooked them but they didn't.  My entire family loved this soup -- it was wonderful!! Definately will be cooking this again.

My 16 year old who is extremely picky reluntantly tried and loved it.  The noodles were what really enticed him. I did have to use quite a bit more flour than recipe called for (almost 2x).  And, I waited until only about 1 hour prior to eating to make noodles so I put them in the oven on warm for about 20 minutes, flipped them and another 20 minutes and they were sufficiently dried out to cook. Delicious.

I used more carrots, less chicken, and rice rather than noodles. You might think I didn't even use the recipe at all, but I think I got an idea of how the recipe is supposed to taste. The family liked but didn't love the chicken and rice, and I will probably make this again. Thanks!

The chicken turned out beautifully, I will do that again without diluting it at the end with so much broth. My noodles came out very doughy and I ended up fishing them all out of the dish before serving it. Maybe I didn't roll the dough thin enough? A nice dish that I will try (parts of) again.

Excellent - I made it in the crock pot with chicken breasts and it was my first time making egg noodles.  Simple recipe and a big hit!

Very yummy! Abundant. Good leftovers, too. I use packaged noodles and it was still good.

I didn't use a whole chicken and added a bay leaf.  I also didn't do homemade noodles as I didn't have the extra time but loved the fact this was an easy slow cooker meal.

This recipe has been in my family for years. If your not making the noodles on your own then you are missing out.  And we remove the skin from the chicken before we cook it and we also add a onion cut in half and a couple chicken bouillon cubes and of course salt and pepper.  They way we serve them is on homemade mashed potatoes.

So simple and great flavor!  This is my new chicken noodle soup recipe.  The only change I made was that I didn't have a whole chicken so I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead.  Turned out delicious and even makes good leftovers!

This was a great recipe. It was easy to make so I made two batches of this soup so that I would have plenty to freeze for the winter. One batch I made in my very large soup pot and the other batch I put onto my slow-cooker. Both cooking methods work and they freeze well. My grandchildren are thrilled when I
serve them this soup and they always want it available to them in their freezer. So glad that I tried this recipe. Peggy

I made as directed.  Not impressed.  Lacked flavor.  Cutting the chicken up after it has been cooked with the veggies was a pain.  I wonâ€™t make again, sorry.

Noodles were hard for me to make- I made a real mess rolling out , cutting and letting dry. I gave up, rolled it all back in a ball, and went to another recipe that divided the dough in 4 sections, then rolled it, then pinched off chick pea sized pieces to cook. That was easier for me.

I must have done something wrong.  I know I'm new at this, but I thought I followed the directions to a T.  The chick was so dry and after pulverizing it in the food processor, it was just like eating sandpaper.  As I said, I must have done something wrong because the only thing that would make this soup half-way palatable would be.....perhaps......abject starvation!

I didn't have the time to do the noodles. I used a bag. ,4 pounds of chicken was too much. BUT the soup was great!!! I needed to add more broth. Will I make it again, oh yes! The taste was great.

I found this a bit bland when prepared as directed. My boyfriend really liked it. I added quite a bit of other seasoning to make it more tasty.  I probably won't make it agin, because the payoff wasn't worth the effort. Sorry. I will decfinetly try making my own noodles again though.

This was very good and easy to make!  I tossed in package noodles instead to make it even easier.  I wouldn't do that next time as the noodles suck up all the broth.  I would add it as needed next time.

Thank you for a great recipe!  I had to substitute chicken broth for the wine but it was terrific!  I have also made it with frozen chicken breasts on high for 5 hours and it was just as good.

Instead of using the homemade noodles (no time for that!), I cooked egg noodles in the leftover broth + 2 quarts of chicken broth.  If you cook the noodles in water, they will most definitely be bland, so use the chicken broth!  Considering how few ingredients are actually used in this dish, it was surprisingly good!  I would definitely add more veggies though!   One side note:  this is great as leftovers; however, the noodles seem to soak up a lot of the liquid.  When I reheated it the next day, I poured a little bit of chicken broth in it just to give it some moisture.  Tasted just like it did the night before!
