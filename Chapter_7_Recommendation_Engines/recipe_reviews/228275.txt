This was delicious, but we did a few variations. We used different cheese and also a few other veggies mixed in, as well as homemade pie crust. Great way to use Swiss chard or kale!

The flavors were fine, but 2 bunches of chard was far too much filling for one crust.  Also, a crucial step is missing in the directions.  The chard absolutely MUST be sauteed and drained before adding to the egg mixture.  Otherwise you end up with an enormous pile of leafy material that will never fit in the crust.  The filling still seeped out all over, so I'd also recommend baking this over a sheet pan.  The cooking times were accurate.  I don't think I'll be returning to this recipe.

This is my go-to quiche recipe.  It's simple ingredient list and delicious taste is a favorite at our house.  Sometimes I'll substitute fresh spinach for the Swiss chard, depending on what I have available.  I'll also use mozzarella as the cheese, again, depending on what is in my fridge at the time.  So glad I found this on All Recipes!

Made it with a combo of Swiss Chard, kale and spinach, fresh from my garden.  So easy...I didn't have Jarlsburg cheese, but I did have medium sharp and extra sharp cheddar cheese.  I used a deep dish frozen pie crust...what mixture I had left over, I was able to put  into ramekins (no crust).  Very tasty.  I'll be making this again and freezing the results/rewards to pull out of my freezer for fast dinners.

This was delicious! I only used 1 bunch of chard and also added a cup of spinach. 5 large eggs was sufficient-2 minced garlic cloves would also be nice as you saut√© the onions. I chopped both the Swiss chard and spinach- I noticed the directions did not mention to chop. I added a photo so ya'll can see how wonderful it looks.
