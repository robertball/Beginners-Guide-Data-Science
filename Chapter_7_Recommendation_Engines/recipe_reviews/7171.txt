I loved these rolls!  I used a little extra flour, and they were still light and flavorful.  Will definately use again.

I am new to Sourdough Starter, this is the first time I had my starter work so I wanted to get going with something easy, and this recipe was all that. Thanks  to the reviewer who mentioned bringing the starter to room temp first. I made only 8 rolls, covered them with oiled saran wrap, stuck in the laundry room out of drafts, and let them sit for 45 minutes. Then I baked them in a lightly oiled cast iron skillet! Look at my purty photo! We tore into these babies like wild hounds. My friend who was here at the time ate three of them loaded with cold butter and preserves, apologizing that she simply couldn't stop. Thanks Debbie!

These rolls had a very good flavor, but I was not crazy about the texture.  They were a little to heavy for my taste.  When I buttered them, they became very doughy.  Will not make again.

Easy to make with starter, but didn't like the texture. Seemed more like a biscuit than a dinner roll.

Excellent, tender and light.  But I did bake them longer than the recipe indicated -- just till they got brown.

Fantastic recipe.  Only thing I did different is to let the herman sourdough come to room temp before adding the rest of the ingredients.

4.5 stars. I did use my own established starter (made with WW flour) which I let come to room temp. Starters have yeast so I only added 1/2 tsp add't.  Because Herman starter uses sugar I added 1 T of honey to compensate. Subbed 1C of the AP flour with bread flour. For veg oil I used 2T olive oil & 2T melted butter. I did add a tsp of Natures Seasoning instead of a mere pinch of salt. The dough came together real nice but I let it rise once on its own until doubled, then shaped and let rise again. I used a cast iron skillet to bake them (thanks for the idea Ellie May). I did weigh each pc of dough and fit 14 (little over 1 ounce ea.) in lightly oiled skillet and divided remaining dough into 6 - 2oz rolls and froze those in a smaller pan to thaw and rise some other time. I needed to brush tops with melted butter a couple times as they were baking up rather pale looking. Mine took a bit longer to fully bake and I think I'll go with 375 oven next time. Rolls had great light texture but seemed something was lacking flavor-wise. I'll go with buttermilk vs water next time and see if that does the trick. Otherwise very good and the dough was a dream to work with. Thanks.

I let these rise twice, as another reviewer suggested (mostly because the dough was so sticky and there was no shaping it, so I thought maybe it would firm up a little, it did, a little). They were good warm out of the oven (what homemade bread isn't?), but I have to say I don't love the texture, it's very coarse, not soft like I'd like rolls to be. And I doubt I'll have any takers for the 3 that are leftover.

We had to add a bit more flour as it was otherwise way too sticky. These rolls are wonderfully fast, easy, and delicious. Thanks for the recipe.

This did not turn out at all. First, the dough was such an oozy glob that I had to add about a cup more of flour just to be able to pick it up and form it. Then, when I took it out of the oven after the 20 minutes, I found that it was raw in the middle. On top of that, the taste was way off because of not enough salt. The recipe calls for a dash of salt but really needed a tablespoon. Most frustrating recipe I have come across!
