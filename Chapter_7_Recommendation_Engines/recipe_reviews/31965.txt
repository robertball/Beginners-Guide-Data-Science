My family thought this recipe was wonderful.  We'll definitely have it, again & again.  I used fat-free sour cream, low fat mozzarella and ground sirloin.  I was concerned that the outcome would be bland because tomato sauce, spinach and sour cream don't have much taste.  As a result, I flavored the hamburger with Accent, garlic salt and onion powder as it browned.  That's the only change that I made.  I served it with salad and garlic bread.  Thanks, KDB for a great recipe!

I followed many of the reviewers' suggestions, and used 24 oz of tomato sauce, added dashes of garlic salt, Italian seasonings, and ground black pepper. It still tasted sort of bland, and I think that is because I used unseasoned tomato sauce. I then added some oregano and about 1/4 cup of chianti, and I really liked the taste. I blended all the ingredients and then topped with the cheese. I used a mixture of equal parts mozzarella, cheddar jack and crumbled feta. Everyone in the family loved it, but my husband thought it needed a bit more zing, and he suggested adding some sliced black olives and perhaps some diced tomatoes. I'm not so sure about the tomatoes, but I think the olives would give it the perfect taste. I'll try that next time!

I really liked this recipe.  I chose it because I wanted to get rid of some stuff in the fridge.  I ended up using spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, quesadilla cheese and cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella, and I even used canned spinach (well drained)instead of frozen because that is what I had.  I used more than a cup of cheese because I love cheese.  It ended up being a real comfort food, not fancy but warm and cheesy.  I  really liked it and my fiance did also.

I made this a 2nd time last night (forgot to review after the first time) and it came out awesome. I modified it just a little - I browned onion & garlic with the ground beef.  For seasoning I used 1tbsp Italian seasoning instead of the thyme. In addition to the sauce I added a can of diced tomato. I did use the sour cream. I used fresh spinach (matter of preference, shouldn't change the flavor) and I put that in with the beef & sauce before adding to the oven pan. I used a mix of mozzarella & cheddar to use up open packages of each. Used shells (can't find w.w.bow tie pasta). We loved it with these modifications, we found it dry & bland otherwise.  Hope you like it :)

I thought this was a great & easy recipe (my husband even approved). I did make some minor adjustments.  I added italian seasoning instead of the tyme along with salt & pepper.  I also added some crumbled feta cheese along with the mozzarella which gave it a great flavor.  Finally, I cooked it the entire time with tin foil on top to prevent it from drying out.  The only thing I would change would be to add at least 1/2 can more of tomato sauce to give you a little something to dip your garlic bread in!

I totally revamped this recipe following many of the other suggestions.  I added onion, garlic, mushrooms, a jar of pasta sauce, black olives, basil, oregano, black pepper.  I left out the sour cream, although would like to try it next time and I cut down the amount of pasta.  I mixed all ingredients together except for 1 cup of cheese, which I placed on top.  I baked this for 25 minutes.  This was a saucy and delicious recipe that could handle almost any kind of variation.

This is definitely comfort food.  I added a little more tomato sauce, some onions, garlic, and Italian seasoning based on the other reviews.  It was still a little underseasoned for our tastes, but I can adjust that when I make it again.

This is the first time I've ever cooked with frozen spinach. I changed the tomato sauce to a thick, chunk spaghetti sauce. I'm makin a conscience effort to include more vegetables into our dinners. This did the trick and everyone loved it!

I made this on the stove-top because I don't have an oven, so it didn't look as good as the pic but it was delicious and sooo easy! Great for a weeknight.

I doubled up on this recipe and gave 1 pan to a friend... and we were surprised at how good it was! I used low fat yogurt instead of sour cream, and grated nacho cheese blend instead of mozzerella... but it was absolutely amazing! I'd suggest mixing all the ingredients except the cheese together too... then pour it in a dish sprinkle the cheese on and bake until the cheese is pretty =)

Rita's Spinach Casserole Haiku: "Won't make this again. Can't salvage the leftovers. Thought it'd be better." I halved the recipe (glad that I did) and used spirals instead of bowties, and even added onion, garlic and bell pepper to the beef, and additional Italian Seasoning, per every review calling this bland. The most unappealing thing was the putrid shade of pink that the sour cream gave to the tomato sauce/meat mixture, not to mention the fact that it was still low on the flavor meter. Perhaps mixing everything together, rather than layering the plain noodles and plain spinach around the only flavorful ingredients would've helped, but as written, this recipe's a dud.

OOOOOOO! Yummy! Love it. I am low carbing it a bit so I shredded cabbage, boiled for 5 minutes and substituted it for the pasta. AND, I thought I had spinach in my freezer BUT it was broccoli, so I used broccoli instead. Wonderful!! I will definitely make this recipe again.

If you r kids don't like spinach, don't put the layer of spinach on top.  Mix it in with the sauce! Harder to spot the "green stuff" that way!  :-)

My 8 year old said spinach is "Awesome!" so we'll definitely be making this again. But tomato sauce is rather bland and 15 oz. of tomato sauce is not enough sauce, so next time I'll use spaghetti sauce and turkey sausage instead of basic ground beef to kick it up a bit. Also, I might mix the spinach in with the tomato/meat mixture for better distribution.

Use spicy Italian sausage instead of beef and add a lot more Italian spices!  Try adding more sauce next time.  Then it is good.

Mix the cheese into the pasta instead of on top.

It would be much too bland otherwise.

I was excited to make this, but then reading all the reviews about how bland it was, I almost changed my mind.  I don't want to be yelled at for changing the recipe, but I always work it a little to make it better.  First, I added chopped garlic and onion (always add that if the recipe doesn't call for it) dried basil and orgegano in addition to the thyme.  Then I added the pasta to the beef mixture, but a fresh spinach and arugula mix on top (cooked it down first), then the cheese and baked for 20 minutes.  It was fantastic!

I agree to reviewer's comments such as adding onion, garlic, more Italian seasoning, etc.  I used 1 1/4 C. sour cream along with 1 small can of tomato sauce and 1 can undiluted tomato soup.  Not dry out at all.  I mixed the pasta, ground turkey, sauce, soup, seasoning and half of the spinach.  Love the green color on top w/ the cheese with some spinach mixed in.    Totally tasteful and makes a lot!  Thank you sooooo much.  My husband rated it a "14".  It IS comfort food.

I was looking for a way to use up the rest of the 4th of July hamburger -- this was really good!  Simple, straightforward ingredients.  I would add garlic & onion, perhaps tomatoes w/green chilies for some extra punch, but it was great as-is, and is going in "the book" at my house!

Very good! I added a 15 oz can of chopped tomatoes with green chilies to the tomatoe sauce to give it more flavor, and used a one pound box of rotini pasta because that is what I had. My children even liked this -- what a great way to incorporate spinach into their diet. :-)

A delicious recepie! It really does disguise the spinach flavor. It's very easy to throw together at the last minute, and the casserole could even be prepared in advance, then thrown in the over for 20 minutes more. I browned the meat with salt, pepper, and garlic, then added just the sour cream and sauce. I used a full jar of Ragu sauce, and it wasn't too much, at least for our tastes. A delicious and very customizable meal - Thanks!

I also did some major modifications. I used ground turkey breast (seasoned with garlic / onion powder, basil, oregano, thyme) instead of ground beef, and fresh spinach. Instead of sour cream, (even reduced /fat free sour cream would be prefered), I used low fat part skim ricotta cheese and mixed chopped fresh spinach into it, then spread it over the meat.

What a HIT! I know my husband loves a dish when he says "You can make this any time!" And he said just that -- over and over! The only change I made was using ground turkey instead of beef. 
Hubby said this reminded him of lasagna. mmmm

Great base for a recipe. Followed this but made some great changes. Used ground turkey instead of beef. Also caramelized some onions on the side and then added them to the cooked ground turkey along with fresh minced garlic. I doubled the tomato sauce like someone said and added some Italian seasoning and it was perfect. I ended up mixing all of the ingredients together including the spinach and pasta before I put it in the baking dish then sprinkled the cheese on top. Completely forgot the sour cream but in the end it was perfect without it. My boyfriend loved it and put some Parmesan cheese on his dish which added to the flavor! Will definitely make again.

My family thought this was really good.
I did a few things different. I used a 28oz can of tomato sauce instead. I added (about a tsp of each)  basil, oregeno, & italian seasoning and about a half tsp of garlic powder, pepper and red pepper flakes. I would definately make this again.

This recipe has a great framework for customizing to your taste. Instead of using the tomato sauce and sour cream I finished up things I had in the fridge. I added about a cup of mild salsa and 3/4s of a jar of cheesy ragu. I used probably a little less than a cup of plain yogurt and a 1lb. bag of fresh spinach, added about 1/3 at a time. I just let it simmer on the stove for a while and then sprinkled mozzarella on the individual servings.

This was pretty good. I left out the sour cream. I did add parmesan to the mixture and I mixed everything together. I browned the meat with an onion for more flavor too. Turned out so good. Oh and I only left it in the oven for 20 minutes since everything was already hot and the last 5 minutes I had it on broil to brown up the mozzarella.

This is great and even better with a few changes. After making it a few times as written I started using Italian sausage instead of ground beef which made a huge difference. Not bland at all. I  use pasta sauce instead of plain tomato sauce and fresh spinach which I wilt in the sausage/pasta sauce. I spread a layer of cream cheese and sour cream over the pasta, dot the top of that with black olive halves and top with the sausage/pasta mix, then add the cheese on top. Delicious! Thanks for an excellent recipe!

Loved this !  Based on reviews, I used Classico Spicy Tomato and Basil  spaghetti sauce in place of plain tomato sauce and it gave it the perfect zing.  Also added mushrooms, just because we love them.  Will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing !

Really delicious, quick recipe for dinner.  Family loved it.  I used a garden spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce for a little more veggies and flavor.

Made this last night but, doctored it up A lot. I sauteed some onions & garlic in olive oil then added & browned & drained hamburger. I then added jar of our fav spaghetti sauce...I always add some "Pampered Chef" Italian seasoning, dash of garlic salt. I then mixed in a Lg bowl hamburger mixture with sauce, 8oz sour cream, thawed chopped spinach & cooked bow-tie pasta. Poured half mixture in 13x9 glass dish then added 1/2 cheese on top and repeated. Baked as for time stated. Served with salad & garlic bread. This was an entire family pleasure and I have the pickiest eater in the world at my house...lol The original version is just too bland for my family...we like more flava :)

This was good! I made this with no salt added tomato sauce. Next time I will try regular tomato sauce and maybe a little extra hot sauce.

I followed the advise of others and added onions, garlic , garlic salt and italion seasoning while the beef was cooking and it turned out great. I'll add more cheese next time 'cuz we're cheezy people. Great recipe for a quick dinner. Only baked it for about 10mins to melt the cheese.

My husband really liked this, but I thought it was only okay.  I think it could use some additions, such as onions or garlic.  I used Ricotta Parmesean Pasta Sauce and I can't decide if that helped or hindered the recipe.  I also used fresh spinach instead of frozen, so I don't know if that made a difference.  I did like the combination of pasta sauce and sour cream, though.

Unless I'm following a recipe for baked goods, I use most recipes as guidelines and not absolutes. I made this dish for dinner tonight and made a couple of modifications to suite my taste.  Turned out delicious!  I cooked 1/2 lb. ground beef, 1/4 lb. Johnsonville Spicy Italian Sausage, a small diced onion, and about 4 cloves of garlic in a pan.  Seasoned with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning.m Turned off heat and melted in 8 oz. of whole milk Ricotta cheese.  Stirred in a jar of Classico Traditional Sweet Basil spaghetti sauce.  Turned heat to low and in batches, added most of a 10 oz. bag of pre washed baby Spinach until wilted.  Tasted it to make sure it didn't need more salt and pepper.  Cooked my bow tie pasta to al dente, drained and added the meat sauce to that.   Poured in a 9x11 casserole dish and topped with shredded Parmagiano Reggiano and Mozzarella cheeses.  Baked with foil 15 minutes and then without foil for 10 minutes more.  Delicious!  Thanks for the inspiration!

I made this last night but decided to change a few things. For one, I used ground turkey and sweet turkey Italian sausage. Then I added in some red, green and orange bell peppers (diced), basil, thyme, salt and pepper. I forgot to add in diced onions but the rest of the flavors went together perfectly, so onion was a luxury not needed in this case. I did not use sour cream this time, I would try it the next time I make it however, I added a little sugar to my tomato sauce to give it a little extra sweetness to coincide with the salt, I've always loved the combination of  a little salt and sugar.

I used medium shell pasta (because that's what I had on hand), I also replaced the thyme with half a package of taco seasoning, and last I used fresh spinach instead of frozen. It was delicious!!! I will definitely make it again. My husband loved it.

Pretty good... I used Italian herb seasoning and fresh garlic and added fat free feta to the mozzarella per other suggestions... The spinach came up to the top after baking so you may need more cheese if you are trying to hide the spinach from a loved one :)

I made this for the Super Bowl but made the following changes: substituted Italian sausage for ground beef, a jar of pasta sauce for the tomato sauce, mixed the spinach in the sauce, used Italian seasoning and added Parmesan cheese to the top. It was really good with those changes

I used less spinach (my family doesn't love spinach). It worked out to be approx 1/2 C once defrosted. I added 1/2pkg sliced mushrooms and cooked them with the ground beef, along with a dash of salt and pepper and dehydrated onion. Also, I mixed the spinach in the sauce right before putting it in the casserole pan to "hide" some of the spinach.

I just finished making this casserole to take to a church supper tomorrow noon.  I'm not sure that I will take it as it looks nothing like the photo and the meat sauce was bland.  Where does the red come from in the photo?  The tomato sauce mixed with the sour cream gave it a disgusting pink sauce - NO RED AT ALL. I just hope that the combination of the sauce, spinach and cheese will improve the taste.  I also doubled the recipe and ended up having to drain about a cup of the sauce off of the meat because it was very soupy. I should have read the reviews first!

Except for the thyme overpowering the flavors, it was kind of bland. Maybe adding more sauce and omitting the thyme would make it taste better?

I was searching here for something with spinach and spaghetti sauce and this fit the bill! I followed closely to the recipe, except I stirred the pasta, spinach & my homemade sauce together then sprinkled with mozzarella and  grated Parmesan cheese. I forgot to add the sour cream, but it didn't really need it.. This was really good and my spicy spaghetti sauce helped make it a flavorful dish.

Just made this and wow - it was amazing! SO easy, inexpensive, and combines all the things I love. The changes I made were because I had time to spare, but I would make this exact to the recipe if I wanted a quick meal!
I used 1 lb ground chicken and 1 1/2 cups light sour cream and 2 cups light mozzarella cheese to cut down on fat. I also used a whole box of pasta (6 cups), a 32 oz jar of 'sausage and peppers' pasta sauce, and added 4 oz of fresh sliced button mushrooms (sauteed with the chicken). To the chicken I added 3 cloves fresh crushed sliced garlic, an italian blend seasoning that has marjoram, thyme, rosemary, sage, oregano and basil. I sauteed a big bag of fresh chopped spinach and then mixed everything together, putting the cheese on top.

Lots of substitutions to use what was on hand, but came out very good. Used fresh spinach from the garden which I added to the skillet the last couple of minutes to just barely wilt. Didn't have sauce so I used stewed tomatoes and added onion, garlic, and Italian seasoning. The pasta was rotini and the cheese provolone.

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe to a T.  It was good but seemed to be lacking something.  The second time I made it I used fresh spinach, Italian sausage, and added a can of Italian diced Tomatoes.  And when I assembled it I stirred all the ingredients together but cheese.  Put the cheese on top and baked.  I also added the fresh spinach to the meet and tomato mixture to cook it down some.  Even though I made changes to the original recipe I would still give it 5 stars.

Simple recipe however, seasoning the ground meat with garlic salt, oregano & basil is a must.  Otherwise, It may be too bland.

With a few changes this was very good but would be way too dry with only 15 oz. of sauce. I used 28 oz. and it needed more. I added chopped onion & garlic while browning the ground beef. When I added the sauce I added Italian seasoning & black pepper along with the thyme. Sour cream really makes the sauce very good and different. I may use a can of mushroom soup sometime. I used 2 cups of cheese. I love the spinich! I made this the night before so it was already to pop in the oven when I got home from work. Will be making this again. Thanks.

Used a herb and spice tomato paste, added green peppers, used Italian seasoning instead of thyme, added garlic and black pepper and used tex mex cheese. Very good, could have used cheese in the actual mixture, not just on top, and a bit spice to the mixture.

Im giving this 3 stars because although it is a great base recipe, made as is it is very bland.  I used one 8ounce can of seasoned tomato sauce and one 14ounce can of diced tomatoes.   And you should never cook ground beef without seasoning, as it adds a great amount of flavor to the dish.  I also used two 6 ounce bags of fresh spinach(personal preference)

Hm I had high hopes for this one because my fridge was kind of bare but I had all the ingredients for this.  I hate to say but it was kind of bland.  It was also not very attractive and gloopy.  Are the people who said it was great using pasta sauce instead of plain tomatoe sauce?

Another reviewer described this as "comfort food," and I completely agree.  I substituted Italian sausage for the ground beef and used plenty of mixed Italian seasonings in place of the thyme, all of which gave it a bit of a kick.  A very good base recipe.

I added some extra ground beef (spiced with garlic, basil, thyme and oregano) and used whole wheat pasta.  The spinach does wonders for presentation and my mom topped hers with sliced cherry tomatoes.

To make it more "Italian" I subsituted Italian sausage and seasoning for the hamburger and thyme.  Came out really good!

I made this with more of a mexican spin because of what I had on hand..it actually turned out super tasty!! My husband is picky and loved it!  I really was in the mood to try something different with hamburger but was limited on what I had on hand.  Here goes...chopped up red onion cooked in olive oil until soft then added hamburger..added plenty of garlic salt, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic salt...cooked until hamburger was done..drained grease..put back in pan added 1 can mild green chilis, one can tomato sauce, one can mild rotelle tomatos, stirred and cooked all through..did not add any thyme or any other spice...I only had egg style noodles but they were great and will use them again..I olive oiled a 9 x 11 gIass dish, spread cooked noodles out evenly in dish, stirred in one package uncooked fresh spinach into the hamburger mixture then poured/spread all evenly over the noodles, and spread a package and half of mozzarella cheese evenly over it all...cooked on center rack in oven for 30 min at 350 and honestly it really turned out so pretty! I should have shared a pic!  Made a Cesar salad to go with it, with olives, Parmesan, croutons and a few tiny tomato's..It was a nice combo...hope this is helpful just thought my spin was a little different than what I had seen so thought I'd share =)

I gave this a 4 because the meat sauce mixture definitely needed seasoning. I added a small onion, 1/2 tsp of onion and garlic powder and reduced the thyme by half. Thyme has a very powerful flavor and even by reducing it it was still present and tasted great.  I also salted the meat pretty generously. I used fresh baby spinach- on the bottom of the pan and on top of the sauce. I thought with the added spices it was very good.  I didn’t think adding spaghetti sauce and fresh garlic would enhance the savory creaminess of the thyme and sour cream.  I’m glad I didn’t use those.

Based on the many 5 star reviews I made this for dinner last night.  I should have heeded the description "quick and delicious way to get kids to eat spinach!" more closely.  It was bland and uninspired and I will not make it again.

Good way to use up some spinach and ground beef! Kinda like making your own sauce. I found that the recipe made more than enough for a 9x9 pan, you probably could split it between 2 pans.

My family liked this alot and I will make it again.  I changed it up a bit.    I used fresh spinach   I added chopped onion and garlic   and for the pasta I used the tiny Orecchiette type.My family really likes that because it adds pasta without taking away from all the other flavors.

Sorry! This is one of the worst tasting dishes I have ever made.  Not one ingredient had any flavor. Nothing had any seasoning, not the meat or the spinach. Frozen spinach needs a little help. The canned tomato sauce was so bland and boring, so artificial. Might be because I grew up with home made sauces. I did not care for the taste of the thyme in this dish either. I guess I am more a "totally from scratch" kind of person. I was very disappointed.

I don't like to make substitutions or additions until I try a recipe. This was good, but there is only my husband and myself. The next time I would cut cut back on the pasta by a cup, and replace the tomato sauce with pasta sauce.

Will definitely make this again. Minor changes..in a large skillet I browned ground beef & I added 1-15ozcan of basil ,garlic,& oregano diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, Italian seasoning instead of the Thyme, sour cream , spinach & 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. Simmered long enough to heat all ingredients then gently mixed in bow tie pasta & poured into a lightly buttered 13x9 baking dish. Topped with mozzarella and baked in 350 degree oven to melt cheese

This was something different.  I added celery and onion to the meat and used orzo.  I recommend a little less thyme.

This is yum but I agree with others, maybe less noodles and mix the sauce in. Otherwise it seems unproportionate with all the plain noodles on the bottom layer.

Very easy and great to get rid ofleft overs.  Used penne for pasta, left over home made spag sauce and left over brie, feta cheese mixed with the mozzarella.  I also spiced it up a bit with garlic n cayenne pepper!! My hub loved it

I made this recipe. I and my husband both liked it. But I didn't like the colour after adding the sour cream. Will try without it once again. Great way to sneak in spinach though ;). Thanks!

Loved it as it was, but also made it a different way that we like even better!! I substituted ground Italian sausage (Johnsonville) for the ground beef and it is wonderful!  I also use fresh spinach instead of frozen.  This is a new family favorite!!

Very good, easy dinner.  Definitely needs more sauce.  And I mixed in all the sauce instead of layering like the recipe suggested.  Next time I will mix in the spinach too so it doesn't dry out so much sitting on top.  But will definitely make again.

Surprisingly good.  I didn't think I'd like it with the sour cream in it but it was really tasty, however next time I'd only add 4oz.  I added italian seasoning instead of thyme - If I make it again I'll mix the pasta in with the meat/spinach mixture.

I made this exactly as described and found it to be bland. I thought my young kids (ages 6 and 4) would go for the bland flavor but they complained about the spinach. I'm not likely to try this again.

Would only repeat the recipe if I used lowfat Italian Sausage instead of ground beef.  The meat filling was pretty bland, even with added spices.

This was a hit with the hubby and 2 kids. I do think that the pasta was a little dry and next time I will mix the pasta in with the hamburger mixture then top with cheese. I also added a little parm reggiano to the dish. I used fresh spinach too!

This was the firt time to make.  Found it very easy and followed the direction but hubby would like more spices next time around as it was bland.  Will certainly take other advices as suggested in the reviews but will definately try again even for company.

I made as directed only as advised in reviews, I used the tomatoes with chilis, and I did season the meat with Cajun seasoning. It turned out great. Will definitely keep in rotation.

This was so easy to make and it was delicious. I did add garlic, onion and extra sauce. I also added the spinach to the meat mixture at the end of the cooking time. The spinach then looks like parsley, kids might like it better that way. Mixed the meat mixture  with the noodles then poured it in a casserole dish. I will be making this again.

This recipe is a keeper! Super easy, good & simple, and what I especially love about it is that most of the ingredients are things you can keep on hand. I 86'd the sour cream because we were out and I was too lazy to go to the store! :) I did cook some onions and garlic in a little olive oil right before browning the beef (in the same skillet). It's just a habit, what I always do when making ground meat for a recipe like this. Brilliant recipe, thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe as it is posted on the site. We didn't enjoy it and I doubt that I will make it again. If you want to try it, use the suggestion of others to make more sauce. Also, add some of the other traditional Italian herbs. Sadly, while I made it because I loved the idea of including spinach in a baked pasta casserole, the spinach detracted rather than added. There are many better baked pasta recipes.

This was a great recipe. My family really enjoyed it. I used fresh chopped spinach instead since I don't like frozen spinach. It still turned out great. The combo of the sour cream and tomato sauce was great!

I thought this recipe was okay but my boys did not like it.  I thought it needed more pasta and the spinach was too crunchy.  Next time I may mix everything instead of layering it.

Kind of bland, definitely needed some spicing up!  I would also add a little more tomato sauce.  Otherwise, not a bad recipe.  I figure if my husband ate spinach, it can't be too bad.

This recipe was easy and very tasty! I added italian seasoning and garlic salt in place of the thyme. I also used two cups of cheese. I thought that the recommended 3.5 cups of noodles was too much though. I will definitely make this again.
