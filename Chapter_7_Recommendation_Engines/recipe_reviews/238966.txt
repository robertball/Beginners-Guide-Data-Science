This was great, just needed a little oomph at the end so added a pinch of salt, fresh lime juice and chopped fresh cilantro. I didn't have chile oil so heated a tsp of coconut oil and 1/4 tsp of chile flakes (smelled wonderful). This is good warm or cold.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe although I had to use substitutions because of what I had in my cupboard. Easy to do, does not take long. I sub'd black beans for cannellini and olive oil with a tsp. of Sriracha, chicken broth instead of vegetable.
