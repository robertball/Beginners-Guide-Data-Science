We had invited 7 people for Thanksgiving dinner and I made this Spiced Cranberry Chutney. Everyone just loved it and I had to write out the recipe a couple of times.  Since then, I have made this recipe twice and I can say this is a "no-fault" recipe.  Try it -- you'll love it!

I cut the sugar in half, but this is AWESOME and a total keeper. While it cooked on the stove, the whole house smelled like Christmas.

I took your advice and cut the sugar in half - it was delicious, also left out the pecans to make it lower in fat.

Nice change of pace!  I followed others' advice with cutting the sugar in half.  It was plenty sweet enough.

So delish - followed others suggestion and cut the sugar in half and it was still really sweet.  Tried it with a pork tenderloin and the flavors complimented each other nicely.  The next day I found my husband with a spoon in one hand and the bowl of leftovers in his other hand...a true sign that this is a 'keeper'.

Excellent sweet chutney. Almost finished cooking now, house smells amazing! Instead of cutting down sugar if you dont want it as sweet, simply add a little cranberry juice, or to be more like a true chutney add small amounts of apple cider vinegar towards the end of cooking to your preference. I add 1/4 cup red onion and a clove of garlic, also a little oriental 5 spice and cinnamon. about 4 or 5 good size oranges will give you the cup of juice and zest.  Fresh ginger if possible. This is a delicious chutney recipe good for many uses, be creative! Going over brie stuffed chicken with prosciutto and wilted greens,  yum!

For Christmas, I put this on top of my baked brie appetizer with a little shaved cocoanut sprinkled on top to give it a festive snowflake flair. My family raved about it, and said it was delicious. Of course I had plenty left over to serve as a side dish. There was none left at the end of the meal. Thanks for sharing.

We use this on everything - sandwiches, roasted chicken, turkey.  It is so much better than any other cranberry relish I have tried.  It's not quite as sweet as most and it has a much more intense flavor.

This was good but would have been so much better without the orange zest and I wouldn't use 1/4 tsp of clove either (maybe half that) as both of these overpowered the flavor.  It's like that was all you could taste and the flavor of the cranberries was very much down played.  I would make this again with these changes and would add a can of mandarine oranges chopped in half then it would be perfect !!

Loved all the spicy flavor of this dish! I did follow others reviewers and cut the sugar in half. For me, it was perfectly sweet enough. My daughter could't get enough of this and she doesn't usually eat cranberry relish! This is excellent cold as well.

This is delicious!  I didn't want to waste anything so we used the whole bag of fresh cranberries and used bottled OJ and it still turned out great.  A keeper!  Oh, I also reduced the amount of sugar...  Thank you for sharing!

I have been looking for a good cranberry recipe for years and this is definitely it!  I made it last Thanksgiving and got two requests to make it again this year. I added cinnamon to really give it a Christmas taste and smell.

I decreased the sugar by 1/2 C . Be sure to increase this recipe by 1/2 or double it; everyone loved it!

Loved this!!!  Not everyone in my family like cranberries and I ended up with leftovers.  I made this and WOW!!!  it was fantastic!  I ended up using as a sauce for pork and chicken.  I also replaced my red pepper jelly with it and it was amazing with brie and crackers!

People that don’t like cranberries will love this!  I use it to do a stuffed pork tenderloin for Christmas dinner turned out fabulous!  The aroma it makes in your kitchen while preparing it makes your mouth water.  Thanks for sharing ???

This was perfect on baked brie! I made it last year for a party and am about to make it this year. Yummy! Keep it all the same if you do it on brie.

I have made this chutney many times. Due to my family being diabetics  I have experimented quite a lot. I use 6 leaves of   stevia instead of sugar and use the top 50 Orange juice. 
I have a plant ,if you use the powder its about a 1/2 cup. Depending on how sweet you like it

Made this as my "try it" recipe for Thanksgiving dinner, asking for opinions.  Everyone agreed it is a Keeper and it was one of the first to be requested for Christmas dinner.  I took the advice to use only one cup sugar. Otherwise, I followed the original recipe.  Thank you!

I doubled the recipe for a large group but did not double the sugar based on other reviewers' comments.  Also, I'm diabetic so used stevia along with a little Truvia brown sugar to sweeten, which worked well.  It was delicious!  I'll be making this again, thank you for the recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and EVERYONE loved it.  In fact I am making it again today for Christmas dinner by request.  I used about half of the sugar as well and it turned out not overly sweet but not overly tart.  I will probably make this every holiday now.  Thank you for listing this recipe!

I'm testing some recipes for this years feast.......WOW is this good.  I did cut the sugar in half and didn't have any OJ in the house so substituted Tange.  

I can't wait to have this with some smoked turkey and stuffing
