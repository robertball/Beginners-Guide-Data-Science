I used fat free half-n-half in this recipe, I made no other changes. The BEST pina colada I've ever had.

Used fat free half and half as well and the amber rum was actually spiced rum.  These were great

The only Pina colada recipe I have found in 20 years that actually taste amazing! I did add frozen pineapple and only a little ice. Now if only I was sitting in the white sand at the beach! Thanks for this recipe.

Amazing recipe! So easy to put together and the splash of dark rum on top is reminiscent of our trip to Hawaii. Tastes perfect

I have tried several recipes and this one is by far the best.  Served it to 5 people and all said it was the best they've ever had. I used bacardi silver and bacardi gold for the 2 different rums and added a splash of the gold in each serving after pour!!

I followed the recipe exactly. mine were non-alcoholic and super delicious!! Don’t count calories with this bad boy but it’s worth every sip! I used a regular non-fancy/high-end blender and it worked great.
