This is a summer mainstay in my house.  I do marinate for 2-4 hours, though.  I also add green peppers and pineapple and brush with extra marinade while on the grill.  It doesn't get any easier than this!

Another fantastic recipe.  I did marinate the pork for about 3 hours and ended up broiling them instead of putting them on the grill and they were still fantastic.  Thanks Lindsay.

Simple and delicious - I did marinate the meat for a few hours along with the pinneapples, red peppers, onions and cherry tomatoes that I added to the skewers.  Thanks Lindsay.

I've made these several times and they are very good.
Last time I cut up the pork tenderloin in chunks and put it in the marinade and put it in the freezer.  Thawed it a few weeks later in the fridge and grilled.  Excellent!

This is delicious!  I was really impressed with how much flavor it had.  I didn't think the recipe called for enough ingredients for the marinade/basting sauce though as it is.  I put just that amount in to toss with the pork and there wasn't any left to baste the kabobs with when they were on the grill so I had to mix up more of that.  You need at least double the recipe I think for the marinade part.  I let the pork pieces sit in marinade about 2 hours before grilling.  I also only used about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes because my 10 year old doesn't like things overly spicy.  Everyone really liked the kabobs and said make it again.  I served this with the Florentine Pasta Salad recipe that is on this site also.  Someone had mentioned the marinade wasn't thick enough, I bought a teriyaki marinade/GLAZE rather than the teriyaki marinade sauce and I didn't have any problems with it not sticking to the meat at all.

These were so good.  I didn't change a thing, and let them marinate for about 6 hours.  A perfect combination of sweet and hot.

I often broil these in the oven, if we are not in the grill mode.  To our taste, we use 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes.  The kids either eat it -- or they don't, that's up to them.  We've never encouraged, or labeled, anyone as a "pickey eater". There are always plenty of other things for them to choose from.

How often do you find a fabulous entree that has only five ingredients other than the meat???  I very often put the pork cubes in the marinade in the morning for an easy evening meal.  If you thread some chucks of onion and red bell pepper (and fresh pineapple if I have it) onto the skewer, you then have your side dish as well.   Usually serve with rice and steamed pea pods.  This is a Go-To recipe if ever there was one.

My husband loved the sweet and spicy taste to this. I loved how fast it was to make! Great recipe! I doubled the marinade like some of the others. I also made two versions, one without red peppers for my son and I and one with for my husband.

My husband, the big pork lover, really liked these.  I did them on skewers in the broiler.  I speared onion chunks in between each piece of meat, which helped the flavor quite a bit.  Next time I'd marinate them for a while in the sauce first.

Delicious! Had over 2 pounds of pork tenderloin so I tripled the marinade, keeping the red pepper flakes at 1/2 teaspoon. Added fresh grated garlic and ginger, green onions, a couple dashes of sesame oil and Worcestershire sauce to the marinade. I marinated for about 5 hrs. Skewered with red onion and canned pineapple chunks (I didn't marinate these). If you have wooden skewers, don't forget to soak them in water for at least 30 minutes  , so they don't burn on the grill. I saved half the marinade in a separate container to baste with while grilling. I served them with Rachel Ray's Special Fried Rice and egg rolls. Yummy dinner and my son and hubby thought so too! Will make again for sure! For the teriyaki sauce, I used Kikkoman's teriyaki marinade and sauce. It's thinner then the baste and glaze, but it doesn't burn as easily. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

This is a very flavorful recipe.  I made a few changes to suit my needs.  First, I used whole pork chops, instead of skewering pieces.  And second, I made it on the stove in a frying pan instead of on the grill.  In the pan, I used the extra sauce at the very end to give the pork chops a carmelized layer of sauce, which definitely sears in the flavors.  
Very easy recipe to make, and one that I would definitely recommend.  Just the right flavors- not too sweet or spicy.

We very much enjoy this recipe.  I marinate the pork for the kids without the red pepper flakes, and add extra red pepper flakes for my husband and I as we like spicy food.  Often my husband and I have these in pita pockets with some onion, lettuce, and tomato.

Had a kabob party - made a honey chicken, a beef tenderloin (!) and this pork recipe and believe it or not, people asked for the pork to take home and left the beef tenderloin (that by the way was also delicious). Someone even said - "next time let's just make the pork ones". Wow - very good!

Best marinade I have ever found on this site!  I was able to marinate over night and they turned out soooo good.  I added a clove of garlic and used olive oil for the vegetable oil.  Yum.

I followed the recipe except I tripled the marinade. Marinated in the refrigerator for about 4 hours. Very tasty but I think overnight would be better.  I grilled them and poured the marinade over them on the first turn. Served it with veggie kabobs, onion, red pepper and zucchini.

I used this on a whole pork tenderloin, rather than make the skewers (lazy, I guess) and we both liked this a lot!  I marinated it for about 24 hours before grilling.  Next time I will make extra marinade to use as a dipping sauce.  YUM!

I cubed mostly frozen tenderloin and marinated for two days. The marinade was good and flavored the meat, but we did not get any "fiery" flavor.

Prepared as written. Marinated overnight. Next time I will follow other poster's suggestion and double or triple the sauce. I also would like more heat, so will add more pepper flakes.

We like really spicy food so we used spicy teriyaki sauce instead of regular and added a couple dashes of ground ginger. We also put green and red pepper pieces, fresh pineapple chunks and some quartered Vidalia onions on the skewers. These were excellent and we plan to make them often. Thank you Lindsay.

This is one of the best pork recipes we have tried.  It is definitely different tasting, which is what we were looking for.  We have made it about 5 times in the last 6 months. If you want something that is different and delicious, try this one.

We love this recipe. I always marinate the pork overnight, and after grilling, it just melts in your mouth. A perfect blend of spicy and sweet. I agree with others that the flavors really go well with kabobs made with fresh pineapple chunks and green pepper chunks. I double the marinade to brush on the kabob before grilling. It makes the grilled pineapple taste amazing! I serve over a parmesan rice recipe I hope to submit to this site soon. Thank you for an awesome summer grilling recipe!

Not bad, but a little bland. Thought they could have used more brown sugar. Might try 1/4 cup of orange juice next time too.

Super Good.  Used Cayenne pepper in place of red pepper flakes.  Put over hibachi rice and added some yellow squash.  We will have this again many times.  Thanks Lindsay

Very tasty and tender, added garlic to the marinade and due to circumstance left it marinating for over 48 hours.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I didn't change anything for the marinade/glaze however when the number of dinner guest grew at the last minute I increased the food by adding some skewers of shrimp.  Everyone like the pork, but the general consensus was that the shrimp was even better.

Very flavorful, quick and easy.  Even my one year old ate these!  I doubled the marinade and let the meat sit in the marinade for several hours.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was okay.  I marinated the pork all day and it had a nice flavor but it is probably not something I would make again.

I have nothing bad to say about this recipe, but I also don't have anything great to say about it.  Probably won't make it again, but it is an easy, tasty, simple recipe.

I made these a few times over the summer, The only thing I did different was use a pork loin roast cut up instead of tenedrloin. When you are feeding a Family of 5 with 3 of them being 6'3"+ and 200lbs+ tenderloin isn't in the budget. I marinated over night, couldn't believe how tender and tasty they were. Thought I would put in my review since I was looking up the recipe for an up coming tailgate party. We will be making these along with Haitian Voodoo Sticks, and Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs both from this site. I may even take the sugestion of a couple of other reviewers and try some shrimp.

The were delicious.  Made a few changes of my own.
I used red wine as I did not have the red wine vinegar.  Also I add 2 cloves of chopped garlic and 1 tsp. of fresh grated ginger. Will try this recipe with chicken breast next time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent.  I did add some minced garlic and would consider about a teaspoon of green onion as well, but this marinade is excellent.  I also added a decent amount of cayenne pepper, and I used seasoned salt rather than plain table salt.  The amount of marinade was just enough, so if you do want to baste skewers while grilling, you'll need bump up the measurements.  For best food handling practice, you should save a portion of the marinade for basting before placing the pork in it.  Also keep in mind that this is a very sugary marinade, so it can burn if left unattended.

DELICIOUS!!!  I followed the recipe as written, but used black pepper instead (1/8 tsp, because I don't like much heat).  I used thicker cut pork chops, and I marinated for about 2 hours.  And I added pineapple in between each piece of pork.  Served over rice.  This is definately a keeper!!!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this recipe earlier.  I've made it many times.  I had given up making pretty much any pork recipe because I dried it out every time.  This comes out moist and delicious.  I always make about 2 pounds of pork so we have leftovers.  Great recipe!

Great recipe. The only thing I changed is that I made a double recipe of marinade. Then I marinated the cubed meat for the afternoon before I skewered and grilled it. The whole family liked these.

The end result was amazing. I just could not see, however, how simply basting the pork with the sauce while grilling would impart as much flavor as letting them soak. I decided to marinated the pieces in the sauce for an hour before hand and then followed the grilling instructions. Tender and very flavorful. Basting while grilling did produce a nice glaze. I would marinated even longer if I made these again.

YUM! Made them just as written except for doubling the marinade and allowing them to marinate overnight. We loved the sweet/heat flavor of these. I will definately be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love this recipe!! I have made it many, many times. It is so easy to prepare even though threading meat on a skewer is not my favorite thing to do. It is very tender and has a little bite. Children might find it a bit too spicy, but it is perfect for adults without being too hot.

This is by far one of the greatest recipies that I have tried from this site. My Husband and son loved it. Spicy yet sweet. We cooked them on broil since we could not use the grill still turned out excellent. We also added cherries, peppers and pineapple to the kabobs.

This was a big hit in our house and has become a regular staple for a quick weeknight meal.   If you're in a hurry & don't have time to grill, its also good sauteed.

Had a bit of doubt that I would really like it cause of the teriyaki sauce smell being strong but it was actually really great with pork tenderloin when marinating it for 6 hrs. Had to make another batch of  the sauce to baste the kabob since the original recipe left me with hardly any. I also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder to the marinade.

*My review is based on my modification that I later regretted!* The recipe would have been perfect but I added about a half tablespoon of hot chili paste for more heat.  I wouldn't add the chili paste if you don't want your pork to taste a lot like the chili paste -- mine sure did! I was kind of disappointed because I tried to keep the amount of chili I added low so that it wouldn't overpower the recipe but it did.  So, there's a review on what happens if you add hot chili paste :) I used Sriacha. This recipe would have been perfect without the paste and I would have been better off adding more red pepper flakes for the spiciness I desired.  I will use this recipe again, though, but make it as-is! I marinated the pork in the mixture for about 4 hours.  **Another idea: I re-heated the marinade to a low boil and added about 1/4 cup of peanut butter and some water to thin it and made a DELICIOUS spicy peanut sauce for dipping! Again, this was with the Sriacha paste so that may affect the flavor! In any case, it was soooo good! I suggest trying it!

Yum, I loved this. I wasn't able to grill these, so I made something similar to a stir-fry. I let my tenderloin marinate while I chopped a bell pepper, onion and mushrooms. I also added pineapple chunks and some minced garlic. It was very good, I'll make this for my husband when he redeploys.

This tasted great both times I made these. I used my grill pan and they still came tender and juicy.

I use the this recipe to slow cook pork for Cuban sandwiches. Just gives it a little added "zing". I need to try it on chicken in the crockpot too.

Fabulous! I used pork loin chops cut off the bone and cut up as it was on sale. Marinated overnight and grilled in slotted pan. Not a single piece leftover.


3/12/10  Grill was out of gas so I baked these in a roasting pan for 30 mins with all of the marinade which I tripled. Took the meat out and added 2 TB flour to the juices to make a spicy gravy. Awesome!

I love this recipe.  Like some other users, I too add peppers, onions, (really whatever I have around) to the skewers.  I made this once - at the last minute - with no time to marinade the pork.  I just place the pork and veggies in a bowl with the sauce and then skewered them and put them right on the grill, Marinading while cooking.  Guess what?  No difference in taste!  Thanks for the recipe

This was okay, but I wouldn't call it "fiery."  Had adequate sauce for basting.  Make sure you turn often so they don't burn!

I rarely write a review but have to on this delicious recipe.  I sliced my pork across the grain and put in marinade.  I put veggies in a grill basket and put some marinade on them.  Grilled the pork and threw some pineapple tidbits in the veggies at the end just to warm them.  Served with rice.  Yumola.  I think I'll double the marinade next time.  Thanks for a KEEPER.

This was delicious. It is not "Fiery" at all. I put the marinade in a gallon sized zip baggie and "squished" it to mix well and then added the pork. I used a huge pork tenderloin (Costco) that I cut up into medallions about 1/2 inch thick. Tripled the marinade. Marinaded in the refridge for almost 3 hours. Could easily marinade all day. BBQ'd the medallions instead of making skewers. The BBQ MUST be on low or the sugar will cause the pork to burn. Hubby loved this. Said; "I will eat this for dinner tomorrow night too!" That folks, is five stars! Made it with Chinese Veggies and Penrose plain white rice! Thanks for the recipe!

I am usually the one posting after I have cooked. This time my better half cooked. So I am reviewing from a different perspective. This things tasted GREAT!! Seemed like a very simple marinade with lots of flavor. No complaints on this end. Go for it and give it a try. Was just told only 1/2 of the red pepper flakes were added so this thing definitely has a kick. Yummmmeee

It seems like I don't agree with a lot of reviews but I do on this one!  Very tasty - nice combo of teriyaki and a little heat but not too much.  I did as previous reviewers and marinaded overnight.

I did not add the red pepper flakes, as I wanted my two children to eat dinner (!).  It was wonderful anyway!  I also marinated the cubes for the day in the fridge.  Served with jasmine rice and a veggie.

My husband raved about this marinade! I used it on a pork chop I had and baked it in the oven after marinating for about 4-5 hours. Aside from the method of cooking I made the marinade to the letter and apparently it was delicious!

I decided to make this the other day following the Black Thai Pork debacle. Marinated the pork over night, and upped the amount of red pepper flakes. Cooked it on the Foreman grill, and it turned out great. Thanks, Lindsay!

Spicy food seeking hubby loved this recipe.  We did not use skewers but thin pork chops, marinated them for 24 hours and then grilled them.  A bit of a bite for me but he was in heaven!

Not much flavor, even though I marinated them overnight. I didn't taste much of the spice, nor the teriyaki sauce. I might give these another try, because they *sound* good... hm.

My husband gave this 4/5 stars but I give it 1/2 stars so we compromised. He says the meat was very tender. I couldn't stand the taste of it in my mouth. I won't make this again unless my husband specifically asks for it by name.

I made this recipe with a boneless pork loin rib roast which is very tender.  I added just a little extra red pepper seeds and marinaded the meat about one hour.  We loved it.

I did not make any changes and found this to be boring and tasteless.  I will probably not make it again.

This one is a keeper!  I can see this being a go to dish often.  We followed other's  advice and doubled the sauce, and also grilled with pineapple, green peppers, onion and cherry tomatoes, and served over rice.  Yum!

Very easy to make and great to do on the grill on a hot day.  I found dipping the pieces in hoisin sauce put it over the top.

This was so easy and so tasty!  My grandsons asked for seconds, my hubby liked it, and I liked the taste and ease of cooking it.  I did alter the recipe a bit though.  To use the sauce for dipping, I doubled the recipe but also added about a half teaspoon of garlic powder & onion powder, then after cooking the meat, I added a tablespoon of starch to thicken the liquid.  I will definitely make this again.

Was not bad just did not have the zing I thought it might. I ended up after the fact using some garlic / chili  sauce as a dip and served over rice. I had even added more red pepper flakes to the marinade.

Very disappointing! After reading all the reviews, I used sirloin strips for stir fry to save time. After browning the meat I put everything but the peppers in the crock pot and cooked for 2 1/2 hrs. I added the pepper s and cooked for another 30 minutes. Meat was tough and tasteless. I added more seasonings but that didn’t not help.  I hate wasting ingredients! Out it goes. It gets 1 Star for how easy it was to make

04-20-16 ~ A different way to serve pork and it is loaded with flavor. I have a lot of 1# pork tenderloins in the freezer, so I will be using this recipe again. I used 'Mom's Teriyaki Sauce Marinade' that I had leftover in the fridge. The recipe had just a little hint of heat but the flavors came through nicely. Along with the skewers we had 'Parmesan Roasted Acorn Squash' a salad and 'Blueberry Boy Bait' for dessert. All were AR recipes.

The whole family loves this and that includes the picky 12 year old! We don't use the sun dried tomatoes as I don't love them and I don't think they're missed. My favorite way to make pork tenderloin.

This had so much flavor, and was such a quick and easy fix.  We were rained out of our cookout, so I sauteed with a little olive oil and serverd over rice.  It made a fanatastic pan sauce that was perfect for the rice.

I can't wait to try it on the grill, but I'll definitely keep this one in the recipe box!

This was well-liked by my whole family. I marinaded it for about 4 hours. I didn't have skewers, so I just stir fried it on the stove top. It made a lovely sweet/spicy glaze and I think next time I will serve it with rice and broccoli.  It had just the right amount of kick to it for us.

Simple to create but still rather tasty. If I could have redone the day I cooked these, I would have marinated the pork for a longer period of time. Constantly brushing them while they are on a grill helps, but they can still come out a little bit dry despite all of the attention lavished upon them. I would definitely use this recipe again.

I tripled the sauce for this recipe and marinated overnight in a ziplock bag. Skewered with onions. It was very tasty - a good balance of sweet and spicy. Served with side of canned corn. This was my third time making this dish and will make it again.

I added green peppers and cherry tomatoes (from our garden!) to the skewers. My husband really liked this pork. I would give it five stars but it's not "fiery" enough. It wasn't really spicy at all. I will add more crushed red pepper next time, perhaps during grilling as well as in the marinade. I would recommend doubling the marinade for vegetables to add to the skewers.

Wow! the whole family loved this recipe. Like others I made 3x's as much marinade. When I skewered them I alternated (cut up) red/yellow/green bell peppers, red/white/yellow onions and I microwaved two russet potates till almost cooked through cut up and rotated them onto the skewers too. Husband used extra marinade to baste the whole skewer during grilling.  So yummy..the family gave it 5 stars.

These were very good.  The first time I had tried grilled pork like this and the meat was very tender.  Next time I might try to add a little "orange" to the marinade flavoring...

I tripled the sauce and marinaded these all afternoon.  They were great, but not spicy enough!  I will add a little chile paste next time.  Definately worth a second try!

These were OK. A little bland, but palatable. I was looking for a pork tenderloin recipe (I had thawed a 1 lb. tenderloin days ago and had to use it up). This one caught my eye because I had most of the ingredients in my pantry and I could prepare it rather quickly. I pretty much followed Lindsay's directions to a T except for doing the following: a) as I mentioned, I used a 1 lb. pork tenderloin, b) doubled the marinade ingredients, c) marinated my pork for aobut 3.5 hours, d) used 1.5 times the amount of red pepper called for, e) added green bell pepper, a vidalia onion and pineapple chunks to the skewers (I did not marinate these items) and f) broiled for about 3-4 minutes per side. Served with steamed white rice, this was a very filling meal. I probably won't repeat this recipe because I thought it lacked flavor, but for a quick weeknight meal, I can't complain. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe deserves a 5 star rating for the amazing flavor and tenderness of the meat! I tripled the sauce and used just over a pound of pork tenderloin and it was plenty for 4 people.  I marinated in the sauce overnight and cooked these on the bbq...also added chunks of yellow onion to the skewers...perfect balance of flavors...I will make more sauce next time to put on the side for dipping(with some fresh garlic added to it)...this was very tasty!

This was REALLY good! I only marinated for about 4 hrs and it still had alot of flavor(basting liberally during grilling helped to) I doubled the sugar and red pepper flakes,substituted veg.oil for sesame oil and it was perfect. I will be making this again really soon!

I have made this a few times, and really enjoy it with pineapple and red onion chunks. Sometimes I use Yoshida's Gourmet sauce instead of the terryaki.

My husband and I LOVE these!!  They were so good that I made them two nights in a row and if I had enough of the ingredients I would have made them again that week.  I followed the recipe as is (only adding some red bell pepper to my skewers) and they turned out perfect.  My only suggestion is that you use more meat.  I found that only using 3/4lb of the pork chop was barely enough for two people.  So in the future, I would probably double the recipe so that we could have some leftovers.

These pork skewers are EXCELLENT! I marinated mine about 6 hours before grilling.  The meat was just the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. Grilled pineapple and couscous are the perfect compliments to the dish.  Thank you for sharing!!

I, like many others, marinated the pork for a few hours.  I also made some extra sauce to baste with while grilling.  It was a very good meal.  I will make this again.

Very tasty! Like others, I did let the meat marinade for 3-4 hours. I like the zip added by the crushed red pepper.

This was the hit of the party!  Did make a few changes - I doubled the dressing and let my cubed pork marinate for 2 hours.  Added pineapple and red bell peppers to the kabobs too. So pretty!  They were gone as soon as they came off the grill.  Next time I'll add even more pepper flakes and I'll baste with additional marinade.

We used chicken and made it for 35 people for our Hawaiian party. It was a great hit. I had been looking forward to left overs....no such luck.

This is an awesome recipe!  I forgot to buy red wine vinegar so I used a 50/50 mixture of apple cider vinegar and rice wine vinegar.  We like the fire of the pepper flakes but they could be lessened or eliminated for sensitive tastebuds and still have a great marinade.

Quite honestly this recipe is very bland. I didn't think it had alot of flavor. 
And I used the best ingredients: Kikkoman Teriyaki and marinated for about 5 hours.
Just OK.

Yum! Yum! Yum! What more can I say? I am not a fan of pork but decided to give this a try. I doubled the sauce and because we like spicy, added more red pepper flakes. I let it marinade overnight. When I put the pork on the skewers I also added red onion and red and green pepper. The sauce was so good that I am going to try it on chicken and steak. Fire up the grill and enjoy!!! Great recipe!
