Altered it a bit and my family liked it better.  They thought it was too thin and light before.    Instead of 2 cups of white sugar, use one cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar.  I mixed all ingredients and let it come to a boil, then removed it from the heat.  It made it thicker.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of butter flavoring.  Gave it kind of a "Mrs. Butterworth" flavor.

I usually buy the aunt jemima type table syrup for many of my housemates as they prefer it over real maple syrup...This is an excellent substitute and much healthier considering there is no crazy chemicals in it or additives! I use 3/4cup dark brown and 1cup white sugar and real vanilla extract (i dont like artificial flavorings). I let the water come to a boil in the pot, then add the sugars and simmer gently for about 5 mins. I check the consistency with a metal spoon and let it cool to see if it has the appropriate 'feeling' to it before removing it from the heat and adding a 1/4cup of honey and then transferring it to a glass jar. I keep mine in the fridge and have never had a problem with it crystalizing. I warm up the syrup before serving if it has been in the fridge and use it for waffles and pancakes. I will be experimenting with other types of extracts and using it for smoothies/ice cream etc... in the future. Will try with splenda as well. :) VERY cheap to make compared to storebought!

This was a great recipe!  Thank you.  I've made this several times, and no longer buy pancake syrup in the store.  I did alter the recipe a bit.  Like the others, I use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I also double the maple flavoring and add some butter flavoring as well.  Also, I add 1/4 c of corn syrup.  This thickens it up a bit and adds a store-bought consistency to the syrup.  When I cook the syrup, I have it on medium heat and I allow it to boil lightly for 10 minutes or so.  Then, I remove from heat and allow it to thicken up.

Fan-freakin-tastic!!! I'm currently living overseas and the country I live in doesn't use maple syrup, despite the fact that they sell real American pancake mix, go figure. Recently we wanted pancakes, so I prayed to the culinary gods in hopes of finding a recipe on here and was soooo happy to find this. The only downside was it's need for maple extract (yep, can't get that either!) so I thought maybe using vanilla would be okay, but I was still worried. I was THRILLED to see so many others saying they used vanilla instead! Indeed, using the vanilla was great! I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar (didn't have any dark brown sugar) and I also added about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of real butter. Yes, it's true; the end result will not lead to a thick syrupy texture that many are used to, but I don't know of many normal people who drink the left over syrup off their plates anyway. I cannot thank you enough for this recipe, it's allowed me to hang on to a few of my comforting American foods.

This recipe was very easy to make.. I would agree with some of the other reviews that it is way to runny. I used 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar and it made it the brown color that store bought syrup is. The taste was awesome, I may have put just a little more maple flavor in because I didn't have the right measuring spoon. To thicken it I used 1-2 ounces of corn starch/water mixture, threw it in the freezer for about a half an hour and then to the fridge. This morning it is about the right consistancy. Thanks for sharing.

This is without a doubt one of the best syrup recipes I have ever tasted.  Not even name brand syrups are as good as this in my opinion.  I did alter it a bit by adding vanilla instead of maple extract, substituting one cup of brown sugar for the white and added about 2 Tbls of butter at the end. This is so simple but so good and it doesn't have all of the junk in it that store bought syrup has. I am forever greatful Kristy!

I made this recipe this morning and everyone loved it. They wanted waffles and we were out of syrup so we tried it. They were a little skeptical at first but once they tried it they were hooked. I used half brown sugar and half white so it would get a little thicker and have the right color. It was excellent. We will use this all the time.

We loved this syrup, and it now sits in place of the store bought stuff!  It tastes much better than any of those!  Very quick to make too!

It was okay, but too watery.  I found my old recipe and remade it for our pancakes. 1-1/2 c light corn syrup, 1/4 c light brown sugar,2 TBS water and 1 tsp ea. Pure Vanilla Extract and Maple Flavor, it turned out perfect. Just bring to boil to corn syrup, water and sugar, remove from heat and add flavorings, mixing well. let cool and serve.  And  it keeps well in the refrigerator.

I grew up in VT and we made our own REAL maple syrup.  I came up empty one day but I had the extract so I decided to make this.  It was so disappointing,  it tasted like the watery store-bought stuff in the plastic bottle.  Not even close to a true maple flavor.

This turned out wonderfully - thank you!  I read some of the other reviewers comments and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  I boiled it for about 7 minutes and then added a pinch of cream of tartar to keep it from granulating.  I boiled it for another 2 minutes and then added about one and a half tablespoons of butter, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon maple extract after removing it from the heat.  It tastes wonderful and is the perfect consistency!

My husband's mother used to make this all the time when he was growing up.  Maybe I am a maple syrup snob, but I can't imagine using anything but the REAL thing.  Tried this and did not like it.  I guess it depends on what your are used to and what is available in your area.  Even though we live in Maine, it is still a bit pricey but to me, it is worth it.  You can't beat the taste or real maple syrup!

This was a huge hit with my family and they are all quite snobby about their syrup! I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup water, and 3/4 tsp of imatation maple flavoring. I believe the trick to getting the syrup a thicker consistency even when serving hot is to let it simmer and reduce until desired thickness. It does just wind up maple-flavored sugar water if you don't cook it down a bit. Lovely, and cost efficient. Thank you!

Thank you for the super quick and easy recipe!  I'd made maple syrup in the past but I think it had corn syrup in it.  Found myself dangerously low on real maple syrup this morning... and it was pancake morning!  A quick interwebz search turned up this page and the morning was saved ;-)

For those of you unhappy with the color/consistancy there are a couple fixes:  1) use organic sugar.  It already has some of it's molasses left in it.  2) use all white sugar, but add a teaspoon or two of molasses.  3) bring the mixture to a full blown boil (without stirring) for 2-3 minutes.  Once the syrup cools, it will be the perfect syrup-y consistancy without added ingredients.

All I have on hand is organic sugar so I used that and boiled for about 2.5 minutes.  We used it warm and runny, but cooled it is a rich brown color with a consistancy a bit thicker than real maple syrup.  All in all a keeper for the ease and speed that it can be made!

Once the changes were made it is 5 stars! I used 1 cup dark brown sugar, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup water and boiled for 7 mins, for the last min I added 1 TBSP butter, then I removed it from the heat and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp maple extract

This recipe is almost exactly the same as the one that's been in my family for generations.  I suppose I'm used to it, but I like it runny.  That's the way it always was when I was growing up.  The only thing different in my recipe is the addition of 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract.  Try it.  It really adds something to the syrup.

I also live in a country where you can't buy syrup, and i made this for my pancakes and it tasted just right! I used brown sugar and white sugar like other suggested, with the maple flavor extract i luckily got passed on from another American, and it honestly tasted just like syrup should! Yes, it was thinner than I'm used to, but not too thin in my opinion. Very easy to make!!

I'll never buy it from the store again this is too easy and kids couldn't tell the the difference. I let mine boil a little to thicken it and did use 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar as suggested by others.

1 c white, 1 c brown sugar.  1/4+ c corn syrup for thickness. corn starch for thickness (add as much as you want, just make sure to dissolve it in water before).   1/2 tsp butter+ to taste.  didn't have maple extract so I used about 1 tbsp maple syrup and 1 tsp vanilla extract

Wow!  I can't believe this is so good and so easy!   I halved the recipe and per the reviews used 1/2 brown sugar instead of all white sugar.  Also, per reviews, added butter at the end.  So delicious!  1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, 1/2 cup hot water, 1/4 tsp maple extract, brought to boil and whisked often for appx 5 min.  I then whisked in 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter.  Yummy!  My husband grew up on store bought syrup and I grew up eating honey on pancakes.  I hate to buy him syrup 'cause the ingredients are so bad.  He finds the real Maple Syrup - such as from Trader Joe's  - too rich and thick.  I'll be making this recipe from now on!  Thanks so much!

Hey, it is what it is.  No, it doesn't taste like real maple syrup from VT. But it isn't claiming to be, either. No chemicals,nothing artificial. I let mine boil down a little to thinken it up a bit and when it was finished I added 2 TBS real butter. I made it with all white sugar. It's a keeper in my book.

This has been the recipe I have always used for syrup.  It is much better than the store-bought kind, and is so easy and inexpensive to make!  I have never changed anything about the recipe, like some of the others have mentioned.  I do store mine in the refrigerator, and it gets thicker when cool.  My family loves this syrup!

Great alternative.  Used 1 C brown & 1 C white suger as other reviewers suggested.  Tasted very sweet just out of the jar, but was really good on our waffles I think partially because it is thinner you don't use as much.  Trying to get away from corn syrup and other additives like we are?  Give this a try.

Gave it only 4 stars because, like many reviewers, I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!  My husband loved it, and my daughter didn't complain about the change.  I didn't mind the thinner consistency, but will probably try reducing it next time to make it a bit thicker.  I will also try adding 1/2 teaspoon vanilla besides the maple extract and also a tablespoon or 2 of butter as some suggested.  So easy to make.  I agree - no more store-bought syrup for my family!

It definitely needed color and thickness. The suggested 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar worked better for color and boiling the syrup for a few minutes helped it get thicker. Also good with vanilla extract in place of the maple syrup for a nice twist.

wow this is really good, I did make changes like some had stated like using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white, i also added 2 tbls butter and melted in and cooked for a bit to thicken it, so I will store in fridge. I added both vanilla and maple flavoring, and its delicious. I like that it doesnt have the high fructose corn syrup in it, cause Im trying to avoid that stuff. I would use real maple syrup but some dont like it(baffles me but). So this is what I will make from now on, its really yummy.

This is so good (brings back childhood memories).  I also used half brown half white sugar since so many reviewers did that and 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp maple flavoring.  I added the corn syrup too (1/4 cup).  Its still very thin, but the taste is great.  I dont think I'll be buying Mrs Butterworths anymore.

I halved the recipe, used corn syrup instead of sugar, and doubled the maple flavor.  Boiled gently for about five minutes, took off the heat and added 3 T. butter...my family raved over this and my husband said no more store bought syrup!!

Easy and quick recipe; works great as a base recipe for any type of syrup.  Just don't forget to let it cool a bit, as that is where it thickens.

I made this with 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar.It was a bit runny for my taste but did not have corn flour or corn syrup to thicken it.Even then it was quite good.I did not even know that making home made syrup for pancakes/ waffles could be so easy.Thankyou for a wonderful recipe.Next time will experiment thickening it and then will re-revioew the recipe.

Who knew sugar water could be so tasty! I also subsituted half brown sugar (dark) and vanilla extract. My mom used to make something like this when I was a kid and has since lost the recipe. So glad I have found one (especially because it is SO easy!).

This was pretty good.  I did use 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar and used vanilla instead of maple flavoring.  My husband thought it wasn't as sweet as maple, so he liked it.  I make some fried sweet potatoes around the holidays and the syrup was exactly the same as what the sweet potatoes are cooked in.

I used my mothers recipe man times so i know how to make syrup but i lost my moms recipe and didnt want to call considering the time difference. So i used this one and was extremely disappointed. I did not care for the taste and it was too thin. I would have thought i did it wrong if the top would have crystallized but it didnt. no matter how old it became.

One star, because it had to be. It's maple flavored water!! I even added a coupl tbsp of corn starch to try and thicken it. I don't know how it got such good reviews!?? Maybe it's a yankie thing but we like our syrup thick and velvety!!

So glad I found this recipe!  My family and I love it!  It's hard for me to eat store bought syrup because my mom always made her own.  Tastes just like my mom's homemade syrup, but the only difference is she uses one cup brown sugar and one cup white sugar and will add a little vanilla as well as maple flavoring.

So easy and good!  As suggested by other reviewers, I used 1 cup white sugar and  cup brown sugar.  I didn't have maple flavoring, so I used vanilla.  I will be buying some maple flavoring now though!  It is a little runny, so next time I'll probably thicken the syrup with corn starch.

I've now made this twice using half regular Splenda and half Splenda brown sugar blend. I did bump up the maple flavoring to a full teaspoon. Turned out great. No problems. Heck of a lot cheaper than buying bottled sugar free syrup from the store.

I used half brown sugar and half white and used pure vanilla instead of maple because that's what I had.  The flavor is wonderful.  I will never buy the high fructose corn syrups at the store again.  This is so much better for your digestive system.

amazing!!  after i used the last of my maple flavouring i didn't want to buy more( pricey) so when i need to make more i make sure that i haven't used all of the batch and use the remaining as the flavouring for the next batch...this is great and the kids don't even know the difference!  i am happy to make a syrup without salt!! and it is great in coffee and no extra sugar is needed!!

This was great.  Did substitute a cup of brown sugar for the white which added flavor and color--AWESOME.  Also, do cook this longer than the recipes states--5-10 minutes.  This will help with thickness, as will an overnight in the refrigerator.

okay, I just tried it right now for breakfast.  BUT.... and this is the only reason why I put three stars because I chose to do it a little differently.  I read some of the other reviews and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  I didn't have maple flavoring so I used 1 teaspon of vanilla and I thought it was way too sweet....and I LOVE sweets!   Next time I'll try 3/4 cup brown sugar and go out and buy maple flavoring.  I didn't mind that it was thin and the color was very nice, but I should've gone out and bought maple flavoring or next time use only 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

The syrup turns out thin but good.  I doubled the amount of extract for more flavor.  I tried to add the corn starch as a previous reviewer suggested.  It did thicken the syrup but it appears cloudy now and that is less desirable. Fun and easy recipe.

Thought this recipe was pretty good for those of us who buy store bought maple syrup-I do not purchase pure maple syrup and I'm sure if I did I would recognize the difference.  I used 1 1/2cups of white sugar but may even cut back more next time mixing brown sugar in with the white.  I also used 1/2 teaspoon of Pure vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon of maple flavor.  I keep mine in the fridge and warm it up when I need it....made this for the oatmeal pancakes II on this site...tasty breakfast.  Thank you for sharing!

Great recipe! I used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of light brown and added 1/4 tsp of butter extract. It was a little runny but overnight in the fridge fixed that. Thanks!

This was really easy to make!  The syrup is kind of runny and I'm not sure how to thicken it up...but it tastes good!

My family loves this recipe!  It is so simple, too.  This is what I did:  I used C & H Baker's sugar (which is super, super fine and dissolves really well), and I increased the maple extract to 1 full teaspoon, as we really like a strong maple flavor.  Since I used so much maple extract, the syrup was darker in color than it would have been with the 1/4 teaspoon of the maple flavoring.  I added all the ingredients at once, and stirred the mixture until it came to a full boil.  Then, I took it off the heat and let it cool a little while I finished cooking my french toast.  Turned out perfect, and my eight year old daughter said it tasted better than the kind from the store.  I'll be making this from now on.

This is the best and easiest syrup recipe I have ever made. I do add about 1\4 cup brown sugar to the other 2 cups of white sugar to give it a bolder taste and thicken it a bit. I have also tried, as others have said, to add corn syrup to thicken it a bit more. Perfect! I love how you can alter it to anyones taste and it is still perfect. Thank you!

I made this recipe with some doubt, however, after tasting it, I must admit it is a real winner.  I may never buy Maple syrup again.

fantastic base recipe. i am currently living in belgium, where maple syrup is not sold, but i was raised in north america and miss my classic pancakes and syrup! vanilla and other extracts make nice substitutes for maple ... i also follow the advice of other reviewers and use brown sugar and butter.

I agree that it is too runny and not dark enough. I looked on the Watkin's site (where I got my maple syrup extract). The recipe is the same ingredients BUT it says SIMMER FOR 15 MINUTES then add the extract. Now this makes sense!!

I made it the first time according to the recipe and it was very thin and light. I would give it a 3. With the suggested modifications 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar it was amazing! I will average it out at 4 stars.

We love this and use it now rather than buying the extremely overpriced brand name stuff. We took some advice from other reviewers and simplified it: 2 cups brown sugar to 1 cup water, and let simmer for 5-10 minutes (it's fine if you don't want to simmer longer, it's just nicer if you do).

This recipe is great, but the instructions could use more detail. For those who commented that it is runny, it is the cooking time that needs to be changed.  It needs to boil a while before it thickens. I cooked it to near the soft ball stage the first time and that worked fine.

My mom used to make homemade syrup all the time. When I realized I was out of syrup this morning, I found his recipe. I read several reviews before I started because that's where the "real" cooking takes place. Like several others, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown. I added 1/2 tsp. butter flavor, but I think next time I will just add a few tablespoons of real butter at the end. I also added 1/2 cup dark brown corn syrup. I let it simmer for 10 minutes or so while I started the french toast. As it cooled, it thickened considerably. My kids are hooked and I don't think they'll ever go back to the store bought stuff. 

I'm only giving it three stars because the recipe as written may not be the best, but if you alter it, it will turn out great.

This was an excellent recipe.  Since I didn't have maple flavored extract, I used vanilla, like the other commenters.  Also, I only use raw sugar, and this recipe worked great with it.

I also live abroad, and I really missed Maple Syrup, so I thought I'd look on here for a recipe, and it turned out great! I did what other users did and substituted one cup of white sugar for light brown sugar and used vanilla extract instead of maple, because I can't find it over here, and also added a bit of melted butter. It tastes great and even though it is quite liquidey, I actually prefer it that way.   5 stars, thanks so much for the great recipe!

Love this recipe, but I gave it 4 stars because I too have done 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white, 1 cup water, 1/2 tsp maple flavor, and added 1 tsp real vanilla extract.  I bring all ingrediants to a boil and then reduce to a simmer until desired consistancy.  My family likes it more thick and this helps.  Love it!

This was so easy and SO TASTY! I used butter vanilla flavoring (can't find maple in the area I'm in), 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. It was delicious; my husband LOVED it. I'll definitely make again.

This is exactly what I've grown up with my whole life.  My mom always made our syrup and we never had store bought syrup growing up.  When I would have friends stay the night, they would always be so surprised my mom made our pancake syrup.

Following some other suggestions, I changed some things in this recipe.  I used 1 c. white sugar and 3/4 c. brown sugar and boiled for about five minutes.  I think next time I'll cook it longer to make it more syrupy.  After I took it off the heat, I added vanilla extract and 1/4 c. honey.  It really tastes good and, surprisingly, DH really likes it!  It's not store-bought syrup, but it is good.  Very nice if you are trying to avoid corn syrup!

Very easy to make, and good flavor.  I did use 1/2 cup of brown sugar in place of 1/2 cup of the white.  I also used 1 tsp. maple flavoring.  This is the way my parents always make "maple syrup".  I prefer the real stuff but I'm out of it.  This was a good sub, thanks!

This was so simple and very good. I followed the others advice and used half white and half brown sugar and doubled the maple flavoring. I brought the sugar and water to a boil and then added the maple. I thought the consistency was right on with a heated syrup.

It couldn't get much easier than this and it tasted very nice. The hot syrup over waffles was very good. I did use half brown and half white sugar. I added a glug of corn syrup as suggested, some vanilla (didn't have maple flavouring) and a couple of tblsp. of butter. I did boil it for a couple of minutes and did not have a problem with it crystalizing (we ate it all before it had a chance).

I never knew how simple it was to make maple syrup. And so quick. I'll never purchase the pre-made stuff again.

Thanks, Kristy!  This is a really nice recipe. It is very simple and quick.  I read the other reviews and changed it slightly the second time I made it. (I add a tablespoon or so of corn syrup to thicken it.)  It's my oldest daughter's favorite syrup!

Very good syrup! I added a little bit more maple flavoring, some butter and did the half white sugar half brown sugar. It made so much, I will be putting the leftovers into the fridge. Very tasty!!

This syrup is the best! I took the advice of others and did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown. It turned out great. I wasn't watching it that good on the stove and it started to boiled, but I think that helped with the consistency. I stored it in a salad dressing tupperware. I will use this from now on and never buy store-bought maple syrup again! Thanks for the great recipe!

we're moving internationally & trying to use up extra stuff, so I used Vanilla extract in place of the maple, 1 cup white sugar, and 1 cup brown sugar.  We're out of corn starch, but if I had it, I think it would have made this recipe even better.  This recipe is great, and one I remember my mother using when I was small.  I recommend using the Vanilla extract for something different.

This is exactly how I've made syrup since 1971.  Have always loved it but McCormick's Maple Extract doesn't make that nice rich brown color, any more, but the flavor is still great.  It's not too sweet and the consistency is perfect.

It was good. I did boil it down to a thick syrup. Then added a could drops of butter extract in addition to the maple.

Made with white sugar and water as per instructions. Like others, can't find maple extract so used vanilla and a pat of butter. It was delicious! Not too watery at all. I let it boil for a few minutes so maybe that thickened it?  Can't believe it took such little effort and everyone thought it was just as good as pancake syrup.

I made this recipe for my family exactly as written except that I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 coconut palm sugar. We liked it as well as any maple syrup from the store. It is a little on the thin side when it is first made, but it thickens as it cools. We won't be buying maple syrup from the store again.

Amazing! probably the best syrup I ever made!(not that I make that much syrup, mostly just use store bought.) One change though: I put blueberry juice in with the maple flavoring, and it tasted A-MAZING!!! i definitely recommend it!

Quick & simple to make. It's cooling now, hubby is happy w/it, & I made it for him, so I'm happy, too. Used 1 cup of dark brown sugar for one of the whites, and put in some Vanilla extract, also. He pours on a ton of syrup, doesn't pick it up w/the pancake, so more than half goes down the drain, so just need something to make him happy.

I'm sorry, but I felt that the consistency of this wasn't right to consider it true maple syrup. Maybe if you don't maple syrup readily available it would be good.

I used to buy starbucks syrup to go in my coffee every morning...I now use this recipe with a little vanilla extract and almond extract instead of maple and it is just like the syrup I was buying for $13 a bottle at Starbucks.  It is awesome in coffee this way!

I had no idea one could make their own maple syrup, but now that I do, I will never buy it at the store again! Not only is this more delicious, but it's also cheaper and (dare I say) healthier. I stumbled upon this recipe this holiday season when I was gifting people pre-made dry pancake mix as well as some mix-ins and spatulas. Perfect thing to tie it all together- a small jar of this homemade syrup! It was a hit.

We've made this several times and have enjoyed it.  It is a lot more watery then the syrup that can be bought in the store.  We don't mind though!  We read other reviewers who said that they used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  We tried this and did not like the flavor at all.  The syrup was thicker but the taste was funny and we ended up throwing that batch out.  We'll stick to the recipe from now on.

What a wonderful recipe!  I was tired of paying high prices in the store so I thought about making my own.  I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar and imitation maple flavoring (that was all my store had for maple flavoring).  I did let it set up in the fridge overnight and it was great!  I will be making again.

My family has always been skeptical about homemade syrup.  But I made this, with the same additions (brown sugar, corn syrup) and they don't want the store bought stuff anymore!  This is simple and tastes great.

I like the suggestion to use brown sugar and vanilla.  It tasted fine but it is very thin.  My husband loved it.

Yikes!! I wanted to make the recipe without other peoples' two-cents, but it turned out like maple water!! It tasted fine, but don't think I'll be making any syrups soon.

I made the "good old fashioned pancakes" recipe from here and had no syrup so I made this really quick and it turned out great. I will use this from now on and not bother to buy it in the store. This is super easy, thanks so much.

I followed the advice of other reviewers to use some brown sugar, more maple flavoring, corn syrup and butter.  I don't think it would pass for genuine from-the-tree maple syrup but it is a very good pancake syrup.

Great! I only had vanilla extract and it still tasted wonderful. Better than store brand stuff with all the preservatives.

This syrup was awesome!! I just used it on an Apple-Raisin French Toast Casserole recipe that I got on this website and it tasted great. My boyfriend and I had it for our day after Christmas breakfast and he loved it as well. Do NOT let the thinness of the syrup put you off. It's the best I've ever tasted.

I agree that this is a bit runny, but I still love it!  I works great on certain types of pancakes.  My fiance loves it.  If even used different types of extracts.
