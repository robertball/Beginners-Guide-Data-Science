My "day" starts at 0500 dark and my job is very physical so I am always looking for a breakfast that is easy to transport (just can't eat right after waking (0200))that is also packed with protein. I tried this as written the first time and thought it was dry and lacking.  I followed the original recipe but made a few changes to my taste.  I used turkey sausage; I did not thaw or drained the frozen spinach (extra liquid is needed); used low-fat cream cheese, not Neufchatel; added about 1/3 cup of diced onion; diced a small (6.5 oz) can of mushroom pieces and stems; chopped one (8 oz) can of sliced water chestnuts; added one egg and did my usual generous sprinkling of crushed red pepper flakes.  With the added ingredients it makes a lot and could easily fill 4 cans of crescent rolls, however, evenly divide the remainder and freeze. I had eaten 2 of these biscuits before we started our work leaving one for our 7 AM break. A co-worker was hungry at 0700 and I offered my remaining biscuit of which she savored and then talked about it the rest of the day..:)).  I had no issues of leakage and cooked on parchment paper on a pizza pan. This is terrific right out of the oven or cold and any way it is looked at great for those on the go mornings and much better tasting than any drive-thru!  I gave this 4 stars as a base recipe then adjust to what you like.  Enjoy!!

Wow, these were absolutely fantastic!  The only slight change I made was to use sage sausage, which I do for every single breakfast sausage recipe, it just adds so much more flavor.  I would also recommend checking if they are done baking at 20 minutes.  I used two different ovens both at exactly 25 minutes, one was just at the good side of being nicely browned but not burned, the other was pretty burned on the bottom.  Also, I found the quantity of stuffing was far more than the crescent rolls could handle, I would estimate one recipe makes about 16-20.

Colleagues raved about them, I was tempted to quit my job so I could just hoard them, thank goodness there is extra stuffing at home :-)

Delicious! I used a full bag of frozen spinach and two rolls of crescents and there was enough filling for all of it.

I made these for my freezer meal exchange group.  My husband loved them and I appreciated there was no pre-planning when making them frome the freezer to the table.taking

I made it as per the instructions and I really enjoyed it.  Be SURE to mix the pepper flakes well throughout the entire mixture!  I got one really hot biscuit!  Still, very tasty, relatively easy to make, and a welcome treat in the cold weather.

Thanks for submitting this recipe, Kristi!
