We very much enjoyed this bread & it's versatility. The only thing I'd change is the seasoning. It made so much bread, the proportions for the seasoning just weren't enough for us. I'd probably double the Italian herb seasoning (I imagine for those who like more subtle flavors, the current measurements would be perfect.) Can't wait to use it for sandwich bread tomorrow!

This is delicious but I agree with the other review in saying that additional spice is needed, I also added 1 additional large egg as the dough seemed too dry when mixing. I also used double the amount of cheese specified. This bread has a nice crispness on the top and the bacon adds great flavor. Fun and unique! I will be taking it to my Christmas Eve gathering.

Really enjoyed it, dipping it in olive oil with additional Italian spices.  But alone, I found it a bit dry.  However I may have over-baked it a bit.

I doubled the italian herb seasoning and garlic.  Was just right!
