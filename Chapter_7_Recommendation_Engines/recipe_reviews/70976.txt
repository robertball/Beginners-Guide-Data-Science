1 tablespoon allspice
2 teaspoons mace
1 teaspoon ground cloves

Don't panic! The mixture amost filled my baking tin, and I was worried it would spill over during cooking, but it stayed in the pan. I cooked it for the time given but the top was a little over-done although the middle was just right, so next time I placed a piece of baking parchment with a small hole in the centre loosely over the top of the cake for the first hour of cooking, removing it for the last 30 minutes, and this gave a much better result. This is a great cake and already a firm favourite.

This is probably one of the better boiled fruit cakes that have come out of Ireland.  I like it exactly the way it is printed and it is very good spread with real butter.   Thanks again for a great simple recipe.

I hate fruit cake, but I wanted to make one for my Grandma, who loves it, so I chose this recipe since it has connections to my Irish ancestry :)  I used dried fruit instead of the candied kind - dried blueberries, cranberries & cherries, along with a box of golden raisins.  Also a tablespoon or two of Bourbon :)  The other alteration was half water, half milk.  This recipe was so good I was eating it warm, fresh from the oven.  Will make this again.

Very good recipe. I chose to make it with the traditional black tea in place of the cup of water. I will make this again.

I made this last night and it was not very good at all. Maybe it's just because it's fruit cake?

Excellent! Not rich like most other fruitcakes. I didn't have the candied fruit, so I substituted 1 cup reg. raisins, 1 cup white raisins, 1 cup cranberries,and 1 cup blueberries. Also used brown sugar instead of white sugar.all else remained the same. Very good!

Great recipe! My mother used to make this for us (all eight of us!). Her recipe came from Ireland with my great-great grandmother.
My mom always used mincemeat (without suet) and walnuts. It is still my favorite recipe-great toasted and served with tea.

This recipe was super easy! I had never made a fruit cake before, so I was a little nervous about it. But it turned out perfect. My husband and I don't like fruit cake, but it was made for his boss, who loved it!

I have made this six times and it turns out well every time. I use a cup of cold tea for the water and use half wholemeal flour. Any dried fruit will do. Make sure the fruit mixture has cooled down somewhat before putting in the eggs as they can cook before incorporated into the mix. Just so easy to prepare !!!

Love this.  I only had pumpkin pie spice mix which is what my grandma used.  It tasted exactly like hers and I have to say it was a bitter sweet moment for me.  Thanks for the great recipe

Make this every year since 2010.   I make it just after Thanksgiving in small loaves.  Then each week I lace it with a liquor (about 2 tbs).  Whiskey being the best.  BUT any dark liquor will do.  My grandmother would make fruit cake every Christmas holiday.  This recipe comes closes to how she would make this cake.

Oh yum! I made it for an event now I'm not sure I want to share. The only adjustments I made were: black tea instead of water (seemed more Irish)and I used a mix of dried fruit (cranberries, golden raisins, raisins and cherries.). I also made my own mixed spice as a reviewer recommended. ( 1 Tbsp. cinnamon; 1 Tbsp. nutmeg; 1 Tbsp. all spice; 2 tsp. mace and 1 tsp. cloves)

I misjudged how early to make my Grandmas so I tried this one.I already had soaked the dried fruit in amber rum for Grandmas.I followed this but only boiled the candied ginger I had.The rest went in as is and it was amazing! I didn't soak it in rum after but a few days later I did top it with molasses & heated for 30 sec...even better!
