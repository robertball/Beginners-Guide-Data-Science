Recipe was a good foundation, and then I added extra lump crab meat, some well cooked bacon bits, parsley, the juice of one whole lemon and a handful of both mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  I served the dip with sea salt bagel chips.  It was a huge hit!

Oh my god.  This is the best crab dip ever.  I used the imitation crabmeat and it is wonderful.  I took it to work one day and everybody loved it.  My boyfriend keeps asking me to make it like every other day.  DELICIOUS !!

I made this for my yearly 4th of July party!  I didn't find Old Bay Seasoning but added Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning and some garlic and extra crab.  It gave it a little kick and was a huge hit at the party!!!

I fixed this crab spread for Christmas eve as an appetizer & it was great, servered it on crackers. I used fresh crab claw, called Phillips crab found in refrigerated section of seafood department. Not cheap, about $8.00 but worth it & I only used half as I was making this for only 2 people but still had leftovers that warmed great in the microwave. Will definately serve this again.

Wonderful recipe!  I used canned crab meat and it was great!  Using a mixer was kinda messy though.  Next time I will try to just "blend it well".  Was a hit at Thanksgiving!  Even my mother-in-law loved it!  And the little bit that was left over tasted great the next day!  I just reheated it in the microwave.  DEFINITELY a keeper!!  Sharon

I took this to a family holiday gathering and it went over wonderfully! Very good dip with crackers or sourdough bread triangles. I used canned crab, but think it would be better with fresh.

This was a huge hit at a party; I used backfin crabmeat which costs a lot but was worth it; I also used the smallest artichoke hearts available (in a can). The dish was elegant; I used a fancy pie plate and toasted pita chips (found at the supermarket) for the dipping "utensils", garlic or plain bagel chips would also do well.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because I felt it needed more flavor. I'd only give my change a 4 star. First of all, I agree you MUST double the crabmeat. I also added cheese like another reviewer suggested, put in some scallions and increased my seasonings. Personally, I like my dips with a bit of zing. I would make this again, but next time I'd add a small can of green chiles to spice it up and maybe some jalapeno monterary jack instead of the mozza and cheddar that I used. Good recipe, just needs some tweaking, it lacks flavor.

Loved by all! Easy to make. For presentation I hollowed out a loaf of Italian bread & served the dip in it; and used the "discarded" bread, as well as specialty crackers.

This Dip was a great success at my party. I changed it a little by using imitation crab because it was cheaper. I also added some fresh chopped dill and chives.  Everyone loved it and asked me to make it again.  I served with home baked pita pieces that I garnished with sea salt.

One of the best crab dips, I tweaked the recipe a little by sauteeing some onion and red bell peppers to it.  Next time I won't be putting in so many artichokes, maybe half of what recipe calls for.

This was a super easy recipe.  My husband and friends keep telling me how great of a cook I am, if they only knew.  I didn't have Old Bay seasoning so I just substituted an everyday seasoning salt, didn't seem to make a difference.

I used 2 cans of crab meat. Leave out the Old Bay, use 2 tsp. grated lemon peel and 1 cup finely chopped red peppers and 1/2 c chives from the garden. Bake it in a quiche pan for a lovely presentation. Dont forget your serving fork. Because this is not "dip like". Company loved it on Wheat Thins.

Tried this recipe. It was very tasty but a bit bland. Definately needs more crab (at least doubled) and more spices.

Yummy-  Definitely better with lump crab meat rather than canned.  I often add in some jalapenos to give it a bit of a kick and melt a little cheese over the top.

Too much cream cheese. That's all I could taste. Maybe it needs more seasoning or crab?

This was pretty good but could use a little more zip.  Very easy to prepare.  I used canned crabmeat but I'll use lump meat the next time.  I liked it a lot.

This is fantastic.  Simple, basic and thrown together at the last minute.  I used canned crab as it was sitting in the pantry beside the artichokes.

I didn't have Monterey cheese, so I used triple cheddar that I had as well as Parmesan/Romano. Aside from a lot of oil, which I think was from mayo, it was delicious. I ate it w/ homemade pita chips & toasted French bread.

Very, very good dip recipe. I added in some bacon, parsley , lemon juice, and a handful of mozzarella and cheddar like someone else suggested. Turned out wonderfully. This dip is great for parties or just to serve at home and give the family a little something different. The artichoke and crab meat work so well together for some reason. I will definitely be adding this to my recipe book. Thanks so much for sharing.
