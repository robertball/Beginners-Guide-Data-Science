I'm not sure how to rate this because while I like it well enough, it is a heavy and very filling dish, and this makes a lot!  I think I'd like some veggies in this thing, but I don't know if torta's usually do, so for all I know they are all heavy.  The pastry is very easy, but it does turn out pretty sticky so be prepared to use a lot of flour when rolling out.  The directions are on target, and mine was done in the time frame.  I really am not a fan of the eggs in this, though.  They look pretty but they taste dry to me so I'd leave them out next time.  This is definitely a dish you want to serve with something light, like a salad, as one slice is definitely plenty. Bf loved this--probably bc of all the meat in it! Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is very similar to one I had in my folder.  
I needed to search as the original recipe became wet and oh well you know water and ink are ;-)  

Though this recipe isn't exactly like the one I had, I was able to substitute the ingredients.  I like using low fat to fat free ricotta and mozzarella.  I also added fresh tomatoes, spinach, lean turkey sausage and I did use prosciutto, thinly sliced salami.  You really can substitute ingredients for lower fat, sodium, etc., even use egg whites instead of whole eggs.  It comes out a much lighter dish and not heavy at all and very delicious.  It has pleased many I have served it too.
