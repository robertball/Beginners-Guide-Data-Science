This recipe may have been a bit bland without adding a few things.  I added a dash of ground cayenne pepper & fresh grated ginger.  I didn't have any apple juice on hand so instead I used orange juice.  I think the orange flavor is a little more "Asian" anyway.  So...with the additions and substitution it was very good.

Oh, and I used Sugar Free Syrup and light OJ to cut the sugar and it was still GREAT.

followed to the T and family wasn't too impressed.  we eat salmon at least once a week so i try alot of different marinades. we thot it was too sweet and not enough real flavor.  you could add ginger, red pepper flakes, sesame oil, any one of these or all would add some oomph!  allrecipes has other better offerings. bon appetit!

this recipe is DELICIOUS! From a user suggestion, I added a bit of grated ginger and a tablespoon of honey. My kids (ages 5 and 3) asked for seconds AND thirds!!!!!

I made this, adding fresh ginger, and as a marinade it was still pretty subtle. Not the fullest flavour for the buck. HOWEVER once the salmon was grilling I boiled the marinade for about 10 minutes or so and served it as a sauce at the table. The sauce was a hit. The boiling brought out and concentrated the flavours, so I would recommend serving it that way. Everyone had seconds.

Very Good.  I added fresh ginger and a couple of extra cloves of garlic.  I baked and added the extra marinade to the dish as it cooked.

This is a wonderful marinade!  I usually won't eat fish, but we found a pre-marninated salmon at a store and fell in love and then of course, the store stopped carrying it!  This recipe produces almost the exact same flavor!  Instead of grilling it though, I put it under the broiler to let it brown. Then if it still needs some time to reach ideal temp, I crank the oven to 450 to let it finish off.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Found this recipe in a hurry for a Friday Night Salmon Special at my restaurant.  I followed to a t, and should've read some of the user suggestions, but it sold out and people were raving!

Delicious. I used green onions and included it in the marinade and also marinated for longer than 3 hours. Extra garlic (I tend to do this anyways) gives more flavor. The maple syrup I think is what makes this recipe really special. I used 100 percent pure maple syrup and it wasn't overpowering or too sweet. I'll be making this again soon!

This is easily one of the better salmon marinades I have used. I placed the fillets on a vegetable grill plate and grilled over indirect coals for about 20 minutes. I do this so I do not have to flip the salmon. I also placed some cherry wood chips that I soaked over the coals for added flavor. Thank you for such a great and simple recipe!

Thanks for the recipe Suzanne - it tastes similar to a maple salmon I can buy at the local grocery store (although your recipe is way better). The marinade is easy to prepare, low fat and very tasty. I made it just as indicated - only I used chopped green onion, and next time, will add some chopped fresh ginger just for a different flavour. Can't wait to try it on chicken.

This was good.  I like the combination of maple and salmon very much.  I used my g.f.grill which is new, and cooked it a hair too long.  But the flavors came through well.  I'll fix it again.

Our favourite salmon recipe until now has been "Maple Salmon" (submitter is STARFLOWER) from AR (that one is now second favourite!). We liked that that the sauce wasn't overly teriyaki-y (I used only 1 TBsp. each of dark soy sauce & Mama Sita's BBQ marinade) and let the flavour of the fish come through. We did this on the stove-top as grilling season has ended here (there's snow outside!). This would pair great with a rice and veggie side, but since were a little rushed for dinner we had it with a green salad. Even our 3 year old son gobbled this down. Definitely a keeper!

Splendid flavor! If you have never liked salmon, I urge you to try it again with this marinade. I used fresh-pressed garlic too which makes such a big difference in any recipe calling for garlic. If you have natural maple syrup from the tree (like the northwoods where I live!) that is a bonus too! Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

Made this recipe tonight for my family (who are all home from college).  Everyone loved it!  I bought a beautiful salmon filet for 6 followed the recipe to a tee... except I added fresh ginger left over from our sushi last night.  I highly recommend the ginger it added and extra dimension and such extra flavor.  I also boiled the left over marinade added a bit more soy and maple syrup and drizzled over the salmon it was restaurant quality.

The marinade was delicious. It got my husband to eat salmon, a fish he has never been fed of having. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good.  I didn't grill it because of the weather, but cooked it in the oven.  I was hoping for a thicker glaze for the top of the fish.  Nice flavor just would've liked to have the crusting from a "sugared" glaze.

This was an easy marinade/sauce to make.  After reading some of the comments, I did put a small amount of ginger in the sauce.    Because I used an electric grill, I did not baste the salmon with the sauce during grilling.  Instead, I cooked the sauce down in a small pot for almost 10 minutes and then served it over the salmon.  It was very good and I will definitely make it again.
