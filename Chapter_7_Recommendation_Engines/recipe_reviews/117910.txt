Eggcellent! Just the way my family likes them. If you find white wine vinegar a little overpowering, try rice wine vinegar for a more mellow flavor.

I made this recipe with a few changes:  I substituted balsamic vinegar for the white wine vinegar (I didn't have any) and I used Lawry's seasoning salt instead of the regular salt, just for fun.  I made a double batch since they were for a party, and they disappeared quite quickly.  I had several people asking me for the recipe!  They were excellent.

I thought all deviled eggs were the same until I tried this recipe - yum!  I used rice vinegar for a softer taste and, as others noted, needed an additional 2 Tbsp. mayo.  I also did not think it needed any salt added at all, but overall, this is a keeper!

very good--used the rice vinegar and forgot the dill weed but otherwise followed exact--whipped up the yokes with a blender to get smooth and put in a zip lock baggy --cut the corner and squeezed out into the white--no clean up-throw out the empty zip baggy

5 Stars! I have made deviled eggs all my life, but wanted something a little different. It had never occured to me to add dill weed!  Also, the mild, slightly sweet rice wine vinegar (suggested by another reviewer) was a HUGE improvement, in my opinion.  Thanks for sharing!

Wow!  I just made these for a cook out and had to try one!  These are really great and will definately be a nice change from normal deviled eggs.  I used Sushi Vinegar and omitted the salt based on other reviews.  I was hesitant to try something new (and possibly ruin a dozen eggs) but I would definately try this if you're on the fence.

Good, solid, basic recipe.  I used light mayo and doubled the recipe.  I didn't double the vinegar though; did add a tad extra mayo (used light).  Dijon is salty already, so I put in a little less salt.  My kids made these with me and loved them!

This was my contribution for a wedding shower. After mixing, piping and adding garnish these didn't sit very long before they were to be on the appetizer table. I sampled one and began to worry at the lack of taste but at this point I had not other choice but to bring them anyway. Fortunately by the time the ladies sat down for a bite the flavours had a chance to blend together. I think that the instructions should include this step.

Now I don't EVEN pretend to be a real aficionado when it comes to what makes a really good deviled egg as I only recently even tasted one.  I made these as part of our football game snacks while Hubs was out running errands.  I tasted one and just as I was about to leave a review calling these average at best, too tangy at worst, he walked in the door, popped one in his mouth and, before I even solicited his opinion,  he remarked, “These are very, very good!”  When I asked him what made them so good, he said because they didn’t have a lot of “stuff” in them, that some are “Deviled God Knows What.”  So never mind my opinion.

Very simple and yummy. Even people who claim to dislike mayo and mustard enjoyed the eggs, and I loved the dill. Will make again, thanks for sharing!

Loved it!  I got so sick of my standard mayo, relish, S&P variety.  I took the pointers of rice wine vinegar, doubled the garlic powder, removed the salt, and dashed the egg whites with pepper before filling.  The dill and vinegar made the recipe!

Used 1/4 of a dill pickle chip as a garnish and added 3/4 t of horseradish for more kick-- also made as is-- taste tested with a group of friends and each got great reviews.  Definitely a keeper!

This is one of my favorite recipes I have ever gotten on this web-site.  To make it a little healthier (because we eat it so often) I started making it with 12 eggs instead of 6, but only using 6 of the egg yolks and the amount of the other ingredients the recipe calls for with 6 eggs.  I also use low fat mayo.  They are not as full, but still have plenty of flavor and less fat.

I followed the directions, but it was too salty, so I boiled 4 more eggs and mixed the yolk with my other finished yolk to take the saltiness away.  It helped a little.  Next time I will leave the salt out, otherwise good texture.

Awesome!!!  I just used plain white vinegar instead of the wine vinegar. 
I also added 1/2 tsp horseradish with 1/2tsp of the horseradish juice (in a double batch)--- sooo good!

The dill weed and vinegar gave these deviled eggs a pleasantly distinct twang.  Everyone at the gathering really enjoyed them.

These remind me of my mom's deviled eggs. She put paprika on top of hers, though, as do I. These were easy and tasty!

Eh. I thought it was just me, but the family, and our 4th of July guests pretty much all felt the same way. These were simply "just okay." It wasn't bad, just didn't taste like the flavors were meant for each other.

These were good, but too "dilly" for my taste.  This recipe wasn't quite as traditional as I expected.  Next time I'll cut down on the dill.

AMAZING!!! I wanted some kick to my typical deviled eggs and this did it. My husband finished what was left in the bowl and ate a few of the eggs before the party we went to. Very easy and Yummy. Keeping this recipe in my recipe box.

These were awesome and I loved the dill on top instead of the eye sore of paprika.  I just cut up the fresh dill and sprinkled on top.  I will defintely make these again and again.

I'm very persnickity when it comes to deviled eggs, that said, these were close to the best ones I've had.  I did use apple cider vinegar (that's what I had on hand), still came out perfect!  Thanks for sharing with us!

I took the suggestion from other readers and used Rice Wine Vinegar.  I was looking for something different than my usual recipe.  This is fantastic.  I actually used this to make Egg Salad.

This was an excellent recipe, but I admit it was a bit salty for us and we are big sodium users. Next time I'll probably leave out the salt and taste it before stuffing the whites to see how it works. (I also used the zip lock bag method for filling and liked it really well.) Thanks for the recipe!

The dill adds so much! Although I didn't quite put in the pull 1/2 tsp b/c that seemed like a lot to me.  I added a couple more Tbsp mayo and used rice vinegar and regular mustard. I mixed everything together in a bowl and then put it into a plastic baggie. Cut a small snip off the corner and voila!  Also, when cutting the eggs, I looked for a darker spot where the yolk was close to the outside.  Then I made sure not to cut on that spot, b/c the wall would be too thin. These were so good that I really don't want to share them!!

Yummm! Followed reviewer suggestions and skipped salt and used rice vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. Good low carb recipe.

Great, but nobody cared for the garnish. I used paprika instead of the dill spring on top (left the dill in the mixture) and replaced the white vinegar with rice vinegar and it's great.

I have never made Deviled Eggs before and had trouble peeling them so I mashed up the entire egg - used this exact recipe - and said it was Egg Salad. Everyone said it was the best they had ever had.

I was afraid the dill weed might be too strong so I only added 1/4 teapoon. I will use as directed next time.I also used regular yellow mustard because I didn't have Dijon.  I prepared these eggs the night before the party the flavors blended better the next day. Excellent I will make again.

WOW! These were absolutely amazing. Hands down the best deviled eggs I've ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, except I garnished with a sprinkle of dill weed as I didn't have dill sprigs. Not only are they delicious, but they're pretty too!

Very good deviled eggs!  My only change in the future would be to halve or even eliminate the salt.  I found them too salty, but my guests still devoured them.

This was good.  However, the next time we make this, we will put in 1/2 the dill.  It was a little over-powering.

This is a fantastic recipe! The dill and vinegar give the deviled eggs a wonderful taste! My whole family loves them and asked for the recipe. I used homemade polish mustard I purchased at a polish store instead of Dijon mustard, but the dill is what makes this recipe. Thanks again!

Excellent recipe!  I did use the balsamic vinegar like someone else suggested (just b/c I REALLY like balsamic).  I also put the yolk mixture into a plastic bag, cut the tip off and piped it into the white half instead of spooning it in- very pretty. The entire doubled recipe was gone in less than 5 minutes after my family got to them.  :)

This is very nice break from the traditional sweet deviled eggs.  But, because I'm traditional I still had to have paprika. I used smoked paprika to top them off and it complimented the eggs perfectly.  (just a little goes a long way)

These were the first deviled eggs I've ever made. They were delicious and very easy to prepare.  I didn't use Dijon mustard cause I didn't have any. I used 1/2 tsp. of yellow mustard and it was still very good.

I thought these were OK at best.  I used 12 eggs and doubled the recipe.  The taste of vinegar was strong and the dill was on the verge of overpowering.

I love deviled eggs, but I'd never made them myself. This was a good recipe, but I changed it slightly. Instead of using dill, I added a tsp of sweet relish. And a deviled egg isn't a deviled egg without a sprinkle of paprika on the top!

Eggs deviled and chillin in the fridge....the only thing I did different because I did not have mayo was used Greek Yogurt and a splash of half/half to get the creaminess and added white pepper, sweet relish and topped with fresh chives. Now, how to keep the hubby from eating them ALL before the family Easter dinner tomorrow????  Delish!

I've only made deviled eggs once before, years ago but now that I've found this recipe, I'll be making them more often. Used white balsamic vinegar and added a tablespoon of diced jalapeno's. Left out the dill because I'm not a fan of the spice (but love the "real" thing"). Gone before half time!

Just ok for us.  I didn't love the strong dill flavor.  Some left in the fridge on the 2nd day- very unusual for this family.  Will not make again.

This was my first attempt at Deviled Eggs, and they went over very well.  I increased the recipe by 2.5, and loosely followed the amounts, based on the texture.  I didn't have any Dijon, and I was afraid a spicy brown or regular would make them too strong, so I used dry mustard (~1 tsp for 15 eggs).  I used Rice vinegar as someone else had suggested.  I garnished with diced chives.  The result: lots of compliments and no left overs.

Ok, next time I would likely use more mustard and mayo.

this is my favorite version so far. I took the advice of others and used rice wine vinegar instead and it was more mellow.

I absolutely adore this recipe!  The vinegar gives it a little bite taking these deviled eggs to the next level.  I made the recipe as is and will continue to do so.  This new momma to be can't get enough of these!

I've never been able to make a deviled egg I liked, but this recipe is really good!  I will made a mistake and used garlic salt instead of powder, so it came out too salty.  I bet it will be perfect when I do it right!

Very Good Recipe! My family is used to the traditional mayo, mustard only combination, so I was afraid they'd balk at chunks in their deviled eggs so left out the celery and the onions this time. One other change is that I always use Miracle whip in my eggs because we like the sweetness it adds.

I made these exactly as the original, except I added three extra egg yolks to the mixture and increased the other ingredients by 50% so the eggs were extra full. They are very tangy, which I loved, and the dill was nice. I will make these again.

I have never cared for deviled eggs, but this recipe, with the addition of a few tablespoons of feta cheese, was outstanding.  the feta really made them special, and everyone in my family loved them.  they are wonderful with a simple green salad dressed with a light vinaigrette!

Very Good. The dill added some color but I still sprinkled them with paprika. I did use the white wine vinegar and I didn't think it was too strong.

I increased the serving size to 40 for a group of friends.  As expected they were gone within 30 minutes!  I recommend always using the fresh dill because the flavor helps cut the richness of the other ingredients.

I love these.  I did use rice vinegar like some of the other reviews.  I will caution that the filling was SALTY but I realized that after it sat overnight the saltiness was gone and the flavor was wonderful.  I have been cutting on the salt.  other than that it is a wonderful recipe.

I hate leaving negative reviews, but I didn't like this recipe at all. My husband made it yesterday, and it just had an awful taste. Maybe it's the vinegar? Maybe too much dill weed? I'm not sure.

These are the BEST deviled eggs I have ever eaten!!  I made some for a party this past weekend and they were a huge hit!  Everyone was raving about them.  I was still craving them, so I made them again today ;).  Used advice I read and used rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  Will be making these often!

I was looking for a different deviled egg recipe than the normal mustard, mayo and relish kind and this is it!  Everyone loved them!! I actually wanted to try them the way the recipe reads before changing but to make 12 eggs, it was 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and that seemed a lot since I knew kids would be eating them.  And then after taste testing, I decided to add about 1/2 tsp. of the white wine vinegar and 1 Tbsp. of mayo.  They turned out awesome... this is a keeper!!  Even my picky 4 yr old said "Mommy, I loved those eggs!"  Hooray!!  :o)    Thank you for posting!

LOVE these. I wasn't paying attention and used regular white vinegar and ended up having to add more (I like zip!). Love the combo of dill/vinegar and dijon. Very good.

This is a stunning, very tasty deviled eggs recipe!  I followed the instructions as mentioned, other than replacing the white wine vinegar with red wine vinegar, and it turned out great!  There's a great 'explosion' of taste about 10 seconds biting into the egg! I believe it has to do with the Dijon mustard / wine vinegar combination!  I'll definitely be doing this recipe again.  Kudos to the creator of this great recipe!

I don't like dill so didn't have any, but these deviled eggs were delicious even without it. I always use this recipe now (minus the dill weed).

I thought these were very good. I wasn't crazy about the dill, so I'll leave that out next time. I added a bit of cayenne, and that gave it a nice punch.

I am a huge deviled egg fan - it was the one thing I always begged my grandmother to bring to every and any Holiday dinner. This recipe was good, but not great.  The vinegar was NOT too much - it gave them a nice punch, which I like.   I added 1/4 t. onion salt to the mix, and sprinkled each finished egg with a dash of paprika to give them color. Perhaps I will try them with minced onion and/or minced celery next time, or with a teaspoon or two of sweet relish, as I tend to like lots of texture in my foods.

These were good, but I do think the vinegar was over powering.  I did use the white wine vinegar.  People ate them, but they didn't disappear like deviled eggs normally do.  They were good, but I'll probably keep looking for an alternative to the usual.

This is now my go to recipe for deviled eggs.  I make them exactly as the recipe calls for and they do not disappoint.  I have also made them with fresh dill weed substituting in for the dry dill and they are also delicious!

These were really good, the dill adds a surprising touch.  I wouldn't want all of my deviled eggs to have the dill flavor but it would be good once in awhile.

I just figured out that I do not like garlic in deviled eggs.  I am sure many do, so please ignore if you think you will like.  If not, here is what I did for scrumptious eggs:  I substituted red wine vinegar for white wine, used regular mustard instead of dijon (did not have any) and used twice as much mustard.  The most important is I substituted a mix of purple shallots, chives, tarragon, and dill weed for the dill.  And I used 1&1/2 teaspoon instead of 1 teaspoon of dill weed.  Finally, I sprinkled sweet hungarian pepper sprinkled on the top.  My guests loved them.

This REALLY impressed my family. Granted, they tend to love things that have vinegar and dill; but this is still mild enough for picky people. I would recommend making these a day before so the flavors adjust, though.

I boiled a dozen eggs to make deviled eggs with  Easter dinner.  Was skimming through recipes and tried this one.  The 24 halves were GONE in no time.  Wonderful recipe!  I would have never thought to try dill.  Thank you!

These were delicious!  I was out of regular mustard so I was searching for a recipe that called for Dijon mustard and I found this one.  Because I was making the chicks for Easter, I left out the dill.  They were loved by everyone (even the one that doesn't like mustard).  No leftovers here and I made over a dozen.  Thank you for sharing.

Wow! Very good recipe! My mother-in-law had told me she just used mustard and mayonaise in her deviled eggs, so for 20 years now that's all I've used to make deviled eggs. Today, I thought maybe there's something else I could add to give a subtle kick. I did a quick search and found this recipe and knew it was be just what I was looking for to give this comfort food and extra boost. I used rice vinegar like a reviewer said, and otherwise kept overwise kept everything else the same.  My husband said they were the best deviled eggs he ever had.  Just what I was looking for!!  Delicious and savory!!

I didn't have white wine vinegar so I substituted plain vinegar and 1 tsp splenda. I used 1/8 cup of miracle whip instead of 1/4 cup mayo, and added 1 tbs of water to make the filling more creamy. They came out perfect! (and lower fat/calorie/carb)

We really like these eggs. The dill is mellow, and pleasing. They have a nice tang to them without hitting that pucker point.

Delicious!  I´ve followed the recipe to a T before....perfect every time!  One time I made it low-fat (substituted the mayo for light, and then another time with low fat unsweetened yogurt)....good also! :-)  A definite party favorite.

These are great. I made them exactly as stated but topped 1/2 of them with bacon and the other 1/2 with sliced black olives. This is the deviled egg recipe I remember when I was growing up. Just zippy enough without too much zip.

We used this recipe to make a deviled egg salad. We used the recipe exactly and then added a little sweet relish and chopped up the egg whites. This was hands down the best egg salad I've ever had.   But without the sweet relish, I felt that the deviled egg filling was a little heavy on the dill.

Very basic, but delicious. I found rice wine vinegar is a bit smoother than white wine. Thanks, Carrie.

Really good, the dill weed adds a good flavor. Instead of putting the dill on top also I topped with paprika.

AWESOME! I made these for my family on Easter & was told it was the best I ever made. My husband has demanded I make more! The only changes I made: used 1/2 tsp rice wine vinegar (i was scared to use more) for 12 eggs & sprinkled w paprika instead of dill. thanks!

Very good eggs.  I used regular mustard instead of dijon, since I don't like dijon.  I also omiited the dill weed.  They were awesome this way.

Great recipe! The vinegar adds a great taste. I think the secret to any deviled egg recipe is the mayo, which I unfortunately learned tonight as I used a cheap brand and they didn't taste as good as they had in the past. I'll be sure not to skimp next time and spend the extra cents!

I was looking for a recipe for Deviled eggs that called for Vinegar, and this one seemed like a great fit. I was excited about the dill.  Unfortunately I do think that it came out a little bit strong. I think in the future I would reduce the dill to 1/4 tsp.  I am also interested to try the substitution of rice vinegar that others have suggested, as I could hardly taste the white vinegar in this recipe.  Overall, though, it did make a tasty treat and I think the leftovers will be great chopped up as egg salad tomorrow!

I was looking for a deviled egg recipe that used dijon mustard. I'd never made them before but I thought dijon would be a nice change. With dill and dijon, this recipe was exactly what I was looking for! I do add pepper and sprinkle paprika on the top. It's the new go-to recipe for family gatherings. I even use it for egg salad sandwiches!

Great deviled eggs! I used rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because that's what I had and ground some coarse pepper on the top. I can't eat eggs without pepper. This was a great way to use up some left over Easter eggs.

I was looking for an updated version of deviled eggs to serve at a retro party.  These were a huge hit!  I chose this recipe because I don't like mustard, and this had less than many recipes.  These eggs ran out quickly at my party and I got lots of great comments about them.  I was just sorry I didn't make more!

I had always used my mother's recipe for deviled eggs until I came across this one. The dill in the filling is genius- the perfect flavor compliment to the eggs. These are always the first to go at get-togethers and church functions now. Thanks!

Very tasty.  Only 2 small changes/additions.  I used rice vinegar and I also added salt to taste.  Has a nice 'zippy' taste thanks to the Dijon and vinegar, but not overpowering at all.  I am excited about tasting them again tomorrow, as this should give the dill time to release its flavor.

Best deviled egg recipe ever!! Savory is definitely the word to describe them. I trash half a yolk to slightly reduce the overflow of filling. I also add an 1/8 teaspoon of pickle juice to make the dill flavor stronger.

Very simple recipe made even faster with store-bought peeled hard boiled eggs and then using a ziploc bag with a hole cut in corner to squeeze the filling back into eggs.

These were great! I made them just for me. They tasted so good, that I regretted not sharing them. I didn't' have any dill but My taste buds sure didn't miss it. I never write reviews but these were just so yummy.....

I'm personally not a big fan of deviled eggs, but these got rave reviews when I made them for a bridal shower. Making them again, but this time will sprinkle the tops with bacon bits as well.

With so many raving over this I thought it would be a good choice for a graduation party. Made them exactly as the recipe called. Was pretty disappointed, found them to be rather bland. Won't make them again.

Start the eggs in water with no salt. Make sure the water is 1inch above the eggs. Put burner on high until a rolling boil. Take off heat and cover for EXACTLY 17 minutes for large eggs and 20 minutes for Jumbo.

This was my first attempt at deviled eggs, and they turned out perfect.  I was afraid that the celery and onions would be too crunchy, but I cute them really small, and it was great.  I did use a suggestion and added 1 tsp of dijon mustard.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used rice vinegar as another reviewer suggested, and these eggs were just WAY too tangy and salty....I can't even imagine why you would add salt as an ingredient...If I ever make these again I will use much less, if any vinegar.  I had to throw away a dozen eggs.

I didn't have any dijon mustard or dill weed so I used regular prepared mustard and dill seed and the deviled eggs were DELICIOUS!  Also added fresh ground pepper to the recipe. Mighty, mighty tasty!

Delicious!! I didn't change a thing and it was exactly the taste I want for a deviled egg. The dill is not overpowering but adds a nice hint of flavor.

Very nice.  Be careful when scaling recipe though - I tried the recipe with just one egg and didn't realize that 1/8 tsp is as small as it gets and is way too much for 1 egg!  Much better the second time I made them according to the recipe.

Taste of vinegar seems too strong even after replacing with rice wine vinegar as suggested.  Dull taste perhaps due to only dill as the spice.

This was my first time ever making deviled eggs. I made these for my husband. He said regular deviled eggs are much better. He gave this recipe a 3. I didnt try them since I dont eat deviled eggs. First time ever he said something wasnt a 5 from this site:(

I thought this recipe was great.  I used balsamic vinegar like one other user suggested and i didnt have dill so i skipped that part.  To give it a little more flavor i added finely chopped onion, an idea i got from another egg recipe.  The final result was delicious !!!

This recipe was pretty tasty. I thought it could use a bit more dill flavor so I added a smidgen of dill pickle "juice" and it perked it up a bit. Hopefully my family enjoys them tomorrow on Easter!

Pretty good - I normally like dill but I think I prefer the more traditional deviled egg recipe.  They were pretty salty so next time I would omit the salt.

Best devilled eggs I have ever had.  I didn't change anything, but didn't really measure either--just added until it tasted good.

Very very good.  I was a little worried that these would be "too different" for a traditional thanksgiving dinner but these were just perfect.  Just a little change from the traditional, everyone enjoyed them.  Thank for the recipe!!

I am only giving this 3 stars because I liked the recipe but my husband didn't like the galic powder taste. I don't think the added ingredients made it any better (as I hoped for) just different. I think I will stick to the traditional.
