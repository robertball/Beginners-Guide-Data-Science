My mother is of Amish descent & made a similar slaw.  But, she used water in place of the oil.  It was much better that way.  The oily taste just isn't right.

Nice flavor, but a bit too oily for me.  Served it at a family gathering & people didn't really take any.

Very simple, yet delicious.  I used 1/2 t. dry mustard in lieu of prepared mustard and it worked as well.

Great with a couple of tweaks. Reduce oil to 1/3 cup and pour the HOT dressing over the vegis and then chill for a crisper result. Very good and the Splenda worked great with this! Thanks for sharing!

It was a very good recipe. The only change I made was that I used half the amount of splenda.

\The receipe is solid, but waaay too sweet for me. Also, the oil is a bit much. All that said, the taste (when adjusted) is great. Thank you.

I made a half batch.  I used Xylitol granules (natural sweetener)- only half a teaspoon- instead of the Splenda and the dry mustard... and only 1/4 cup of Extra Virgin Cold-pressed olive oil and still found the slaw too oily.  But otherwise this was a VERY nice slaw.  I also used apple cider vinegar with the mother and added a little bit of chopped mint- about half a teaspoon.  I think it would be great with wine vinegar, teriyaki sauce and a broccoli slaw mix, too, with some sliced almonds chicken and sesame seeds for texture and proteins.

Delicious!  Used blue agave since I didn't have any Splenda in the house. (Just halved the listed amounts since its sweeter and I didn't want too sweet) Also, heeded the advice about the oil and halved it.  Love the spicy flavors  of celery seed and mustard with the vinegar and sweetness. Winner!!
Will try again adding green pepper and carrot and further reducing sweetness.
