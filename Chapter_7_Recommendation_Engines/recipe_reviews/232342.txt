This is a great cake but needs just a bit more information for me.  The batter is very much more soupy than most cake battters and there is a lot of it.  You must cook in three 9" layer pans and carefully divide the batter equally.  Also, the cake needs to be completely cooked or it will fall apart when removing from the pan. Make sure that a toothpick comes out clean to assure the cake is done. But ..........once done and cooled........this cake is fantastic!!! It got raves from my "cake snob " son and that takes a lot!  Thank you for sharing this!

I made this exactly as written. Like others have said, the batter is very thin but it turned out great. I greased my pans very well and sprinkled with cocoa powder as the recipe called for and had no trouble with the cake sticking to the pan. The recipe called for using a 9x13 pan but it fit perfectly in two 9 inch round pans. It's the most moist cake I've made and it will definitely be my new go to cake recipe. The only thing I might do differently next time is to use hot coffee and mix it with the cocoa powder before mixing it in to the batter. This method is used in other cake recipes to boost the chocolate flavor.

This was so incredibly moist and delicious! Followed this recipe exactly, no changes made. I made a 3 layer cake with 9 in round cake pans. This will be my new go to chocolate cake recipe.

I've made this recipe many times and if you wast a very rich, moist and delicious chocolate cake this is the recipe you have been looking for.   Yes the batter is soupy BUT that's the way is needs to be. When I want a show stopper dessert I use 3-8" round pans and use a measuring cup to ladle the batter equally.  Over the holidays I used 2-8" pans then made 8 cupcakes with the extra batter (gave the cake to my granddaughter) and kept the cupcakes!

As good as I hoped!  I used Valrhona Cocoa Powder for restaurant quality chocolate flavor and did mine in a pair of 9" round pans with a layer of homemade blackberry jam between them and a nice creamy chocolate frosting.

Have made this several times since and it is "the chocolate cake" by which all others are judged.

This cake is amazing!!!  No changes were made. I have never had cake this moist. No frosting is needed, it's that good!  I was a bit nervous as the batter seemed very runny but all came out well. ThankYou for this fantastic recipe!

Cake was excellent....moist and chocolatey!  To make it healthier, I subbed greek yogurt for the sour cream, 1/2 applesauce+1/2 coconut oil for the veg oil, and reduced sugar to 1.5 cups, made my own cake flour (1 C flour, remove 2 tablespoons of flour, then add 2 tablespoons cornstarch.  Sift 4-5 times).  Will definitely make this again.

Best chocolate cake recipe I have made! SUPER Moist, even though I substituted no fat greek yogurt for sour cream, and I used 1 cup of splenda and 1 cup of brown sugar rather than 2 cups of sugar. 

Rookie mistake.....does NOT fit in a bundt pan...so make a few cupcakes or something on the side, or you will have a mess!

This chocolate cake is perfection!! Be sure to grease/powder your pans really well if you're making a layer cake - I skimped a little on this step and the layers got a little stuck. This recipe is my new go-to!

This chocolate cake was extremely moist. I was skeptical about using coffee because I didn't want a strong coffee flavor on my cake, but I did not taste the coffee at all, which was perfect. I used chocolate jello pudding for the frosting and, oh my gosh, it was sooo good!!! Love this recipe! Thank you

Best chocolate cake ever!!!  Very moist!!!  Batter is thin.  Do not be concerned. It will turn out.  I did not understand how it's a layer cake calling for a pan in the directions though. But either way....best cake ever.

BEST CAKE EVER!!! My family ALWAYS requests me to make it! This cake is moist and delicious but make sure you mix the sour cream well! I ended up with small clumps of sour cream in the cake. Sour cream is thick so you really have to mix it well. Despite the clumps my family and I LOVED  it!

I made this with Splenda instead of sugar for my diabetic daughter. Chocolate mousse with orange extract between the layers was a hit. It came out great. I will make it again with sugar for the next birthday. Be sure to have the sour cream at room temperature so that it incorporates well into the batter.

Smells great, but fell in the middle, I think too much bicarbonate, every flour and oven is different, so when cooking we just have to judge. Will try again with 1/2 the bc.

Turned out fantastic!  Made a couple small tweaks that worked beautifully.  Cut down sugar by half a cup, and did 50/50 canola and coconut oil combo.  Made a whipped chocolate cream cheese frosting with raspberries and a ganache striping.  First scratch cake and turned out to be one of the best chocolate cakes I’ve ever had.  The friends agreed.

Love it!  Came out fine the first time - I added some mini chocolate chips and decreased the coffee the 2nd time.  It's very versatile.

Oh, man! This is the most delicious chocolate cake I’ve ever had. I grew up with a cake-baking mom, so I’m picky on cakes and loathe dry ones. This one is super moist (heavy!) and really chocolatey. I made it just like the recipe says. 

I baked it in two 8”x8” pans to layer it, but I forgot about evening out the tops, so they didn’t stack flat and the top one cracked in two. Oh well - it was just for our family. I added a layer of chocolate pudding between them, but it didn’t need it. 

The moistness is even yummier with some refrigeration!

I Loved this Recipe so much, but to make it better I added creamy chocolate moose in the middle of the layers and frosted it with a creamy dark chocolate frosting we gave some of the cake to the neighbors and they said it was better then any chocolate cake they ever had and that included all the professional cakes! The only problem was that we had put the cake batter in a spring fold  pan and well...
the batter kind of leaked out of the pan in to our oven and well lets just say burnt cake does NOT smell good.  Good thing we saw this before any more than a half a cup of batter leaked out(: Over all I think this cake needs to be in the big book of world records under "best moist chocolate cake ever made in the history of moist chocolate cakes"

This cake is delicious! I had to make my own cake flour. This was moist and delicious! I baked in a 9' x 13' glass pan. I baked for over an hour! not sure why that happened. I will try this again with store bought cake flour.

I made this cake  and it was the best moist cake I have ever had. Read the reviews and it's runny like they said but baked up just fine. Will be using this for my chocolate cake in the future. Happy as a turtle on a escalator I am.

It was truly awesome!!! I was a little concerned about how thin the batter was but it turned out awesome :)
If you are making this in a springform pan just make sure to put something underneath if you are worried about leaking.  Also, the top came out almost completely flat, which is great because the frosting does not leak away if you put it on while the cake was just a little bit too hot (like I did) :)
Thank you

Absolutely amazing recipe but I needed to reduce the sugar and oil so that we could all enjoy due to dietary concerns.  I cut the oil to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup apple sauce to compensate.  I used 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of Splenda.   I also used top quality cocoa powder.  Like others stated, it's a very thin batter, but it bakes up proper. The cake was moist, the crumb was super tender and the chocolate flavor was outstanding.  I used a glass 13"x9" pan and at 325 degrees, it took about 50 minutes to cook through.  Just keep testing it with a toothpick in the middle to get it baked right through.

This was the best chocolate cake ever!  I used regular flour because I didn't have cake flour and I wanted a solid texture.  I also added chocolate chips to the batter in the pans and mixed it but not so deep that they were at the bottom.

This was wonderful!  The entire family loved it!  Very east to make - batter is thin but I think that is what really made this cake moist!  It is saved as a favorite and I will be making this again!

I'm an American currently living in Spain where chocolate cakes are typically too dense for me.  I wanted a classic moist cake and this recipe did it for me. I had to substitute "queso batido" (whipped cheese) for sour cream, as this is the closest thing to it in my region. I also had only a wand style mixer but that didn't matter. This cake turned out to be exactly what I craved and I will definitely use it again and again.

I made my own cake flour by removing 4 tablespoons of the flour and replacing the 4 tablespoons with corn starch.  The cake turned out moist and very delicious! I used a bundt style pan (cupcake shape) and it was perfect.  Thank you!

this cake was so gorgeous and moist. I made just one cake without the layers but I will make it again with layers as I expect it will be even nicer if that's at all possible

I was looking for a sour milk chocolate cake recipe like my mother used to make.  I used this recipe with 2 cups of sour milk instead of the cups of milk & sour cream.  It was moist and delicious!

I liked the cake. But don't go by the picture it isn't a layer cake it's a 9x11 sheet pan.  I made a layer cake and had to bake it a little longer than the  9xx11.  I didn't read the directions well enough before baking.  I wanted a layer cake.

This is the first chocolate cake I've made from scratch and all I can say is that it is Wonderful. I normally don't care for chocolate cake but this was so yummy and moist and very good. I doubled the recipe because I was making more than one cake. And I didn't make this frosting.
I will make this cake as many times as I can. I don't need to find any other  chocolate cake recipes  for a very long time.

I added an extra tsp of vanilla and used plain, sugar free Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. This is a fantastic, very moist cake that I'll definitely make again. No frosting is needed. Mmmmm.

Used applesauce in place of oil to make them a bet healthier.. Used mocha coffee but felt it needed a deeper chocolate flavor so may try adding more coco next time

Moist, light, and flavorful! My go-to chocolate cake recipe. (Oh, I didn’t blend the sour cream enough at the end and it came out with yucky white lumps in it. Instead of “stirring” the sour cream in at the end, go ahead and mix it in with the mixer!)

Had a huge craving for chocolate cake and made this one first thing this morning. My daughter and I love a good cake by are not fans of frosting. This cake came out perfect! Followed the directions as listed - made one big 9x13 cake - took about 55 minutes to fully cook. We cut it in half and ate some warm. YUM! And made a poke cake topped with instant chocolate pudding with the other half  - it was divine!

This cake was delicious! I cut back slightly on the oil (used 3/4 cup) and it was perfect. I made in 3 round cake pans. They cooked much faster than time listed in recipe. I frosted with a homemade chocolate buttercream & it was a major hit! I made for my mom's birthday. She does not like coffee, so she was a little skeptical...until she tasted the cake! Not even a hint of coffee flavor. The coffee just deepens the chocolate flavor. Will definitely make again!

Fabulous cake!  I made it in two 9 inch pans, and it took almost an hour to bake.  I frosted it with a whipped buttercream frosting and then drizzled a chocolate ganache on top.  Beautiful and delicious!

Hands down the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever tried! I made this for my daughter's birthday. Followed the recipe to the letter (used Dutch processed cocoa for richer chocolate flavor, however). It was so moist and delicious! Frosted it with a homemade cocoa whipped cream frosting. Perfection! My new go-to chocolate cake recipe!

Moist and delicious.  Made a three layer cake,with chocolate filling for my son's 19th birthday.  Not too sweet.  The batter is runny, as noted by others, and bakes up beautifully.

Yummm! I halved the recipe & made cupcakes! I baked them for 18 mins & they came out moist, fluffy, & delicious. As others have mentioned, you really need to mix that sour cream in well otherwise you'll end up with streaks! Also, make sure you use a good quality cocoa powder!

Love love love this recipe! It takes almost like brownies!
I do, however, live 6,062 ft above sea level so I had a major falling issue. I halved the baking soda and it came out perfectly.

Made this without the coffee, came out absolutely perfect! Though i was a tad short on sour cream, it still worked out great. 10/10 would make again. Maybe with the coffee next time ;) !!!

Yummy chocolate cake and easy to make. For those who don't like coffee, don't skip it because there is no coffee taste....just yumminess. I did have to bake 10 minutes longer. Surprising since my oven runs hot. Will make again.

I made twice it in a Bundt pan. Since I frequently make angel food cake in the same pan, I mistakenly thought I should cool this cake upside down. I couldn't be more wrong. The cake completely fell apart. It was a delicious mess. Second time, I cooled it completely before carefully turning it out of the pan.  I used coconut oil instead of canola oil, almond milk instead of regular milk and Hershey's Cocoa -Special Dark.

Amazingly moist and delicious. Our three teens, who can be ridiculously picky, all said it was one of the best cakes I ever made. Followed the recipe as written except that I halved it and baked in a 9" round pan. Will definitely make this again.

Amazing! I used this recipe for cupcakes and got soooo many compliments!!! Very moist and delicious. Worth the time it takes. I blended the sour cream in with the mixer. Planning to make them again very soon and add mini chips. YUM!!! My husband is VERY picky with his chocolate cupcakes and he couldn't stop talking about these.

I put half a cup of apple sauce and half a cup of oil. My family loved it, it was gone within a couple days. I made a guitar cake.

So good. It got raves from everyone who ate it. I substituted gluten free flour and1/3 cup apple sauce for 1/3 of the oil. Will make it again for sure.

So delicious. So glad I tried this recipe!! Moist, light, heavenly... Will now be my go to. I used decaf coffee and made my own cake flour following directions online. It all worked out marvelously.

I made this using gluten free flour and it turned out great!  Very light and moist!  Made a butter cream frosting to top it off, although a variety of different frostings or glazes would work well on this cake.  Cake was a big hit with the birthday boy and guests.

Best chocolate cake I've ever made, but next time I will mix in the sour cream a little better. I had white streaks through the cake of sour cream. They weren't bad, they just didn't look pretty.

This has got to be the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  Crazy moist and delicious!  I made it as a bundt cake because I didn't feel like taking all the time to frost layers and stuff.  I just used a nice chocolate frosting/glaze to go over it.  It came out perfect but remember if you make it as a bundt cake you can still bake it at 325 Degrees but you will need to do so for 1 hour & 20 minutes instead of the normal 40 minutes.
