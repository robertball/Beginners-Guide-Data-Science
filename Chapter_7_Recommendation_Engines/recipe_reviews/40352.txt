This is the best pork chop recipe I have ever tried!  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and did not have a problem with it overpowering the dish.  I used boneless pork chops and it only took about 25 minutes to cook.  I baked the chops in the marinade and it was absolutely wonderful!  Made brown rice and fresh green beans with it and it turned out to be a very delicious and healthy meal.  I can't wait to have it again!

I cut the soy sauce in 1/2 and marinated it over night... baked in glass pan with marinade-- basted 3 times, and it was Excellent!! I am not a big meat eater, but we loved it, even passed the recipe along to friends.

Excellent recipe.  The best part about this recipe is how easy it is to prepare.  My friends gave me many compliments on this main dish.  I used 3 fairly thick boneless pork chops and recommend cooking for around 30 minutes.  This was a bit too salty, use reduced-sodium soy sauce.  Overall, I highly recommend this recipe.

This is so easy and the chops are succulent!  To get around the salt issue, I use 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1/4 cup of water, and squeeze a little extra lemon juice in.  Bake them in all the marinade,and voila!  My family just loves them!

I happen to love salt, but had a hunch that I too, would find these too salty. For this reason, I played it safe and used 1/4 soy sauce and 1/4 water. Along with that minor tweak, I also let the chops marinate for about 4 hours. I found them to be quite nice and very easy. I think what I liked the most out of this dish was not even the end result, but just the fact that the only ingredient I had to buy was the pork chops. Next time I think I'm going to throw in some onion slices and fresh mushrooms in the dish and let them cook with the chops. Too counteract the saltiness of the pork chops, I paired them with sauteed apples and a light pasta.

We had these pork chops for dinner last night and they were lovely to look at and easy to prepare. The temperature recommended was a tad too high and the timing too long....I will cook them again next time using a 325 degrees for only 20-25 mins. Very good.

This recipe was much too salty. I suggest cutting the soy sauce in half and marinating for only about 30 minutes to an hour. Otherwise, I liked the combination of ingredients.

Excellent recipe;I will defenitely make this again. I marinated the pork chops for 4 hours and also added a small can of sliced mushroom with the juice on top. I baked just as described while in marinade. Meat was perfectly cooked, juicy, and flavorful!

Really enjoyed this.  Reduced the soy sauce to 2 Tbsp and used olive oil.  I marinated for 30 minutes.  Reserved the marinade and pan fried boneless pork loin chops (4 oz each) for 1 minute per side, then put them in a 375 degree oven for about 7 minutes.  While they were baking, I added 1/2 cup fat-free chicken broth and the reserved marinade to the skillet.  Deglazed and brought it to a simmer and reduced it to use as a sauce.  Delicious.  Thanks, Sherlock.  (Just a food safety note, if you want to use the marinade for basting after the first 10 minutes or so of cooking as the recipe suggests, you would need to boil it first.  Otherwise you are putting the raw pork juices in the marinade back on the cooked meat.)

Too salty.  I don't know of any way to help that out either.  You might try using low sodium soy sauce.  I also marinaded over night, so you may try not leaving them in so long.  Even though my husband said they were good, I will not make this recipe again.  The taste was not bad, but the salt just over powered everything.  I grilled mine on an indoor grill and did not baste with the marinade at all.

I have made many recipes from allrecipes.com but this is the first one I have reviewed. I thought they were yummy, but my husband said they were the BEST pork chops he has ever had. I followed the recipe exactly,  except I lowered to temp. to 300 for a slow bake for about an hour. I kept them warm in the oven for 2 hours and they were still yummy. In fact, that was when the husband ate them.

I followed the recipe exactly and was amazed at the results. The ingredients are so simple but the taste is so complex and delicious. I made 6 servings, and the recipe calculator worked phenomanally! I marinated the chops for 4.5 hrs and baked them in a glass dish for 40 min lined with foil, with enough foil left over to cover the meat. I also poured all of the marinade in the dish as well. NO BASTING NEEDED. I have a difficult time making porkchops that aren't dry, but these were absolutely fabulous! So juicy and tender! Trust me, y'all! Use foil!

I used fresh lemon juice, added about a teaspoon of honey, and marinated in a ziploc bag for an hour before baking the pork chops in the marinade.  I basted them every 15 minutes and cooked a bit longer than called for, since we were watching a movie that was almost over.  I figured that, with the marinade, the worst that could happen is that they'd be more tender--and that's what happened!  Easy, moist, tender, and delicious.  My family had happy/startled faces when they took the first bite and asked what I did to the pork chops! LOL!  This recipe is a keeper.

As suggested by others, I replaced half the soy sauce called for with water.  Glad I did so because otherwise it would have been way too salty (and I am a saltaholic!).  Next time I will add in a little more lemon juice because I felt like that got lost in the other flavors.  I used bone-in center cut pork chops and marinated them about 4 hours and then baked the chops in the marinade for 40 minutes.  The chops came out tender and flavorful.  Will make this again.

These turned out to be the most tender pork chops I've ever had. Great taste... although a little salty, even using the low sodium soy sauce... but I served them with the suggested mashed potatoes, and that sweetened the meat.
I'm keeping this recipe on file. Thanks, Sherlock.

My husband loved these. They turned out like nice little steaks. I did make a few changes to the marinade. I used 1/4 C soy sauce, 1/8 C orange juice and the juice of 1 1/2 lemons and the zest of one lemon. I kept all the other ingredients the same. Also, I used boneless pork chops, so I only cooked them for 15-20 minutes. Thanks for a good recipe!

To me, this tasted like bitter, burnt, salty, soy sauce; but it was not really burned at all. The chops were moist and fine (marinated 2 hours)but this sauce was awful. The only thing I changed was using low-sodium soy sauce (due to reviews that said it was too salty. I don't think I did anything wrong;I just think we did not like. Try the "Baked Teriyaki Chicken's sauce (recipe from this site) it is much better and similar.

Great marinade. I like to shock the taste buds so I added a 1 1/2 teaspoons of brown sugar to cut the salt and a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for a lil salty sweet heat trio. Then I used sliced mushrooms, a 1/2 cup of the marinated, 1/3 cup of white wine, pinch of corn starch for thickening, to make a a nice mushroom sauce for the chops.

Very tasty. I marinated the pork for 5 hrs. and I took the suggestion of other reviewers by cutting cut back a bit on the amount of soya sauce, topping up with water. I also added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, and baked it slower at 350 degrees until a meat thermometer read 170 degrees, which took about 50 min.  The lemon juice was not very discernable, so next time I'll add a bit more.  The pork was moist and delicious, and I'll make it again.

This is very good!  I marinated for 3 hours and baked for 30 mins.  Reduced the soy sauce by a 1/4 and used EVOO instead of vegetable oil. Super easy to prepare.

This is a great, easy recipe. Was out of garlic (and not a big fan anyway), so I left that out. Used low sodium soy and didn't find it too salty. Baked in glass pan at 350 for 25 minutes. Tender and full of flavor! Will make again!

I was in a rush so I only marinated the pork chops for about 20 minutes. When I put the chops in the oven, I put an extra tablespoon of the marinade on top of the chops about every 10-15 minutes. I flipped the chops halfway through and added the extra marinade as I had been doing. The chops were still moist and delicious! Great recipe!

This dish was incredibly delicious!  It was so easy to throw together the marinade.  I added 1-1/2 tsp. honey and we cooked it on the grill instead of baking it.  My family LOVED it.  We are going to enjoy this recipe again and again.

Ok, I took a departure from the recipe.  I have tight budget, so I looked at what I had in my pantry and made the following substitutions: 1/4 c soy sauce, Pinch of granulated garlic, and 1 teaspoon red chili sesame oil. I omitted the black pepper because of the sesame oil.  I let them marinate for an hour and then cooked the four "thin" pork chops for 35 minutes. I paired it with brown rice and a bag of "Birds-eye" asparagus stir-fry I had in the freezer. Everything turned out great. My husband and I loved it. Thanks for a flexible recipe!

From reading other reviews, I thought I would also find it too salty, so I used 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce and 1/4 cup water.  Actually, the end result ended up not salty enough, so I recommend using 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce.

I made this for my whole family. My husband who usually will not touch pork chops, loved this recipe and eat several of them. Thanks for giving me a new recipe that even my husband loves!! I left the meat in the sauce instead of basting them with the sauce. It made the pork chops tender and full of flavor.

Maybe I used the wrong type Pork Chops (didn't specify cut in recipe) but it came out dry and a little too salty. I used thinner cut.. Maybe if they had more fat on them it would have tasted better. Sorry

This was another great recipe.

I used pork tenderloin cut into medallions.

I also used 1/4 low sodium soy sauce and 1/4 up water.

3 TBSP lemon juice.

Don't forget to add sliced onion.  It adds great flavor and is excellent with the meat.

I marinated the meat and then put it all into a 12x12 cassarole dish.

This is basically braised meat with all the juices but it made a great meal with potatoes.

Good recipe, my tweak is to add a spoon of sugar , bit more lemon juice (lime works fine too) and lots of fresh grated ginger. The extra stuff balances the salt of the soy

Didn't have time to marinate these, but bakes on low for the first 30 minutes while basting every 10 minutes or so - poured off the pan drippings and juice that had accumulated and saved to make sauce. I then baked chops on high (425) for next 20 minutes and let them get nice and brown. For the last 10 minutes, I added the pan drippings back in the pan with the chops and added 1/4 cup of white wine. This was very good. Served with stuffed mushrooms and rice.

Easy and tasty! I used boneless thin chops and let them marinate for about 5hrs. They were NOT overly salty.

These were some of the best pork chops especially when you consider how effortless they are to make.  I marinated 3 decent sized chops overnight, using 3/4 soy sauce and 1/4 water... liberal w/the lemon juice and added powdered ginger as another reviewer recommended.  Cooked ;'em in the marinade at 375 for 35 minutes and they were moist, flavorful, and delish!  I spooned some of the leftover marinade over brown rice and sauteed mushrooms and onion in Worchester sauce and served on top of the chops.

These have so much flavor - love it! Just be careful not to overcook; they won't brown much, so it's easy to do. I had everything else mixed before I realized I'd already used all my lemons... so I made do with bottled lime juice (I know, I KNOW - so scandalous). It was still delicious, so I can't wait to do this one properly! I used reduced sodium soy sauce, and I would recommend it. I might even try Ponzu sauce next time, since it's vaguely citrus-y anyway. The resulting sauce in the pan is SO great - make sure you serve something that you could spoon a little right onto (rice or noodles, maybe quinoa or couscous). Oh, and PLEASE do not baste with the marinade straight from the raw pork!! Please oh please either add it to the roasting pan and baste from there, or boil the marinade for a few minutes before basting. So much potential for cross-contamination!

I have found through experience, that when a recipe says to marinate in a soy sauce marinade, do NOT over-marinate - that only allows the salty soy to further permiate the meat, thus making it more salty than if you had marinated for the specific time (such as 1 hour, or perhaps a little longer). I used lite soy, and marinated for 1 hour 15 minutes, and it came out just fine - not too salty. This will go on my rotation dinner file.

This was anothere awesome recipe.  When I was making the marinade it seemed a bit strong, but after I cooked the pork chops,(for about an hour because I like my meats cooked well done), it tasted great.  The sauce was mixture was perfect.

These were pretty good.  Almost too salty though, and I cut the soy sauce in half (used reduced-sodium soy) and used half the W. sauce too.  I liked the lemon and garlic in this though.  I used half olive oil/half toasted sesame oil for the veggie oil.  The pork remained a little chewy, but I think that's just the nature of pork chops.  I baked them in the marinade, and turned them over a few times.  The great thing about this recipe was that is was so easy to prepare!  It took about 5 minutes to throw together.  Served with brown rice and fresh steamed broccoli.

I thought with all the great reviews that this would be a great recipe but it wasn't. They were dried out and not very favorful. I marinated them for 2 hours and even covered the pan with foil to try to keep the moisture in to no advail. The marinade smelled wonderful but that's it. Not a recipe that I would recommend to anyone.

Very good and easy to make. I might use low sodium soy sauce the next time as I let it marinate for 4 hrs and it was a bit salty for me but my husband and kids loved it. I'm not a big fan of porkchops but this was really good. I might try the marinade with chicken soon too! SO GOOD! Thanks Sherlock!

My husband and I really enjoyed these scrumptious pork chops!  I think this recipe could also work well for chicken breast; which I plan on trying out in the near future.  I'll definately be making these porkchops again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe. I have prepared it at least 6 times since I got it a few months ago. I especially love it with pork loin, too. I made it exactly as written. My whole family loves this, & I served it to guests last week & have been asked for the recipe.  Awesome flavor!

4 1/2 for sure, I loved this meal and so did my family.  I chose to grill them rather than bake them and it only added to the taste.  I think this will go well in the fall as the ambient temp starts to fall.  I added a side dish of shredded Brussel sprouts cooked in butter and  Celtic grey salt and fresh ground pepper.

We loved it! Even using 1/4 c. of soy sauce, we thought it was a bit salty. Maybe next time I will use low-sodium soy sauce. We also thought that it was a little dry. It's all good though.

These were very good! I use a tamari premium soy sauce and I find it more flavorful than certain brands that may be cheaper and have more salty taste.  My whole family liked these, even the kids. I just have to find a way to make pork chops stay moist- I only cooked them 35 minutes, they came out great except for being a bit dry.

This was great! I loved the lemon flavor. I did use less soy & it was low sodium. I used granulated garlic - I was being lazy. We really liked it, thanks! We did grill them, too hot in Texas to use the oven :)

I'm not a  big fan of pork chops, I make them because my husband likes them but this recipe was really good! I did 1/4 soy sauce and 1/4 water and they were still a bit salty but not too salty. My 2 year old also ate these up so that's gotta count for something!

boyfriend loved them, but they were way to salty for my taste. I'll try them again and take the suggestion of cutting the soy sauce in halving the soy sauce and adding some water.

This recipe was very simple, and all of the ingredients are things I usually keep on-hand. I didn't feel that the pork chops had a whole lot of flavor, I could taste the soy sauce more than anything else. Not bad, but could be better.

Best homemade pork chops I have ever had! I cut the soy sauce down to 1/4 cup and added some water and extra lemon juice instead. Marinated them for about 90 minutes. I used boneless chops and they were done in 25-30 minutes. I basted them 3-4 times while they were cooking. So juicy and full of flavor! Served with brown rice and stir fry vegetables. I will definitely make this again.

This is one of the best recipes I've tried on Allrecipes.com! It was wonderful! Since I only made this for 2, the amount of soy sauce was perfect. But I could tell that if I made this for 4 that it would be extremely salty. I marinated the pork chops in the mixture for 5 hours in a zip lock bag and it was perfect. I also cooked them for 30 minutes instead of 40. Perfect!

Wonderful flavor!  I only got to marinate these for about 30 minutes and I think that was good enough.  Pork chops turned out very moist.  Next time I'm going to try these out on the grill!

I did not think it was too salty. I scaled the recipe down to 2 porkchops and still used 1/4 cup of reduced sodium soy. Also added 1 tsp of ginger per another reviewer. Great, easy dinner! (Didn't have time to marinate for more than 15 minutes...next time I'll make on my lunch break so it can sit all afternoon.)

This recipe is great! I added a tsp of honey and took the advice of other tasters by diluting the soy sauce by 1/2 with water. I had quite a bit of marinade left over, so I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and a splash of red wine vinegar, reduced it till thick and drizzled it over roasted asparagus. I even used it as a salad dressing for the green salad. WONDERFULL! The chops I used were very thick, so I seared them on both sides in and oven proof skillet first and then finished them in the oven. The moist, moist flavorfull chops I have ever had!

Very, very good.  I marinated the pork overnight and the next day realized I was not going to be home to cook them, so I put them in the freezer.  A couple days later I thawed them out and grilled them.  They were great.  My three little boys even enjoyed them.  Thanks for sharing!  I will def be making these again!

This was delicious.  An excellent and easy recipe.  We had it with sauteed apples and mashed potatoes.  I marinated the chops for only an hour and I used low sodium tamari sauce.

I hate to say it, but these were awful.  Tough, very strange taste (and I love soy).  My husband disliked, too.  Will never make again.

Very good recipe!  All five of us ate it (even with a very picky eater who does like many meats).  A little on the salty side which is why I only gave it four stars.  Next time I'll use low sodium soy sauce.  Changes....used two one pound pork tenderloins.  Marinaded it overnight and baked at 325 for one hour in the marinade.  Will definitely make it again!

This is a great way to prepare pork chops and it tasted wonderful.  It was a tad salty but I like it that way.  Marinated about 3 hours before baking.  Served with blue cheese potato au gratin and grean bean/mushroom medley from this site  Will definitely make this again.  Yummy !!!

Very tasty, quick & easy.  I had my hands full so after about 45 min, I just put them in a baking dish, poured the marinade over & popped in the oven for 30 min.  I also added a bit of fresh ginger.  Everyone loved it so much, they all asked for left-overs in their lunches....BUT there was NONE LEFT!  Great post...thanks!

The best tasting pork chop marinade I've discovered yet.  When I run out of soy sauce, A-1 sauce will substitute in a pinch. This is the only way I make pork chops now.

WOW these were good.  We had them last night and my husband is already asking for them again.  We did make a couple of changes.  I juiced 2 small lemons so I think it was a bit more than the recipe stated and we grilled them.  We had planned to mariate them over night, but they actually marinated for 2 nights.  SO Yummy!  We served with red potatoes baked on the grill.

I used low sodium soy sauce, still way too salty even though I checked out all the reviews...., I ended up mixing in brown sugar, to cut the salt and then horseradish to spice it up....I used fresh lemon juice and added some lemon zest but I still didn't taste the so-called 'freshness'...guess I'm not a salt freak.

I was crunched for time so I marinated the pork chops for only 20 minutes. Regardless, they were very flavorful and very moist. For a little extra flavor, I heated up the remaining marinade used for basting and served it on the side. I will definitely make this recipe again, but will try marinating the chops overnight, as many of you suggested. Thanks!

I used half soy sauce and half water and, though salty, the chops tasted good. I put in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes since I was using very thin pork chops.
Overall, I would use this recipe for a quick midweek meal but not for a special occasion.

My fiance and I thought these were delicious. I didn't have a few of the ingredients, so I improvised. I used lemon peppar seasoning instead of the lemon juice and the dry garlic flakes instead of the fresh cloves. It is a little salty, but we love salty foods, so it was great. Also, I cooked them about 25 minutes at 375 degreese. I think 35 minutes would have dried them out. I'll make again!

I used chicken instead of pork because thats what I had. It was very good. I also added ginger (the kind you get with sushi), chopped it up pretty fine and added to marinate. Was very tasty...

A lovely dish, thank you Sherlock! I added considerably more spice, but being baked, it was just delicioulsy warm, not blasting hot. I added: twice the garlic, some grated ginger, some chopped hot chile peppers and a pinch of cayenne. I made this along with the AllRecipe "Asian Coconut Rice", added fresh cilantro garnish, and it was very well received.

Although it does take a bit of time (only to allow it to marinate), it's a great recipe.  I thought the sauce may have been perhaps a bit overbearing, but indeed, it wasn't.  This recipe is truly a gem among all the others!

I made this recipe tonight and on a wim since I happen to have all of the ingredients already. I took the advice of another person and cut the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and had 1/4 cup of water. I only added a little more of the lemon juice, and pressed the 4 gloves of garlic since it was easier. I marinaded for 1/2 hour and baked at 350 for 30 minutes with marinade so no basting was needed. The meal had a nice flavor to it, and no flavor over powered another. I'll be making this again, except I will add a touch more lemon and thicken up the sauce a bit. Very good!

Very good I read some of the reviews they talked about it being salty. I used low sodium soy sauce and didn't salt the chops good move on my part.

Loved this recipe. I used previous suggestions. Half and half water and soy sauce, a little extra lemon juice.  Used butterfly chops about 1/4" thick. Cooked on 325 for 25 minutes. Very tender and yummy! Thank you!

Took other reviewer's advice and used 1/4 C soy sauce and 1/4 water then followed recipe. It was just okay for us...I found myself wishing I added sugar and made a teriyaki sauce instead, but my 18 month old loved it.

I always like to brine meats before cooking in 32 oz water and 2.5 oz kosher salt for about 30 min.  Helps to keep you from drying out the meat.  I cooked these on the grill.

These chops were phenomenal! I only marinated mine for about 3 hours and they tasted like they had been soaking up the goodness overnight. Well-seasoned and flavorful! Took the suggestion and paired them with feta-herbed-mashed potatoes and a light romaine salad and it was a hit!

Great. Cooked in the marinade (same glass dish). Good flavor. Did seem too salty - but don't think it would have if I hadn't poured the juices over the accompanying coucous. Poured a little orange juice over final plate too.

Really good recipe.  It's very easy to prepare and when you're ready you just throw them in the oven.  The cooking time is the only thing that takes any time at all.  I had the marinade done in less than 5 minutes.

Jst made this for dinner and it was great!  However I didnt use lemon juice being that I have so many fresh limes, so I used that in place of it and the flavor was amazing.   Also, I cut the amount of soy sauce in half, and it was still unbelieveable.  Thanks for sharing!

These might have been a tiny bit too salty for us, even after using Lite Soy, but the flavor was great and meat tender. I did marinate the chops most of the day and dropped some thick chopped onions on them for baking. We'll have them again with maybe a dot of honey in the sauce and thanks for the recipe!

Great flavor.  I threw this in the crock pot (on high for about 5 hours) to make for more tender meat.  I thought it was a bit oily, so I would suggest maybe using 1/2 teaspoon oil.

These had a very nice flavor. I did not have the saltiness problem others had, probably because I always use the low-sodium soy sauce. I look forward to having these leftovers for lunch today.

So tender and yummy! I did cut the soy sauce in half and added 1-2 tbsp honey, which I think countered the salty soy sauce and added an nice extra flavor.

I did not marinate them so they would not absorb so much of the soy sauce and be so salty. Instead of baking them, I browned the garlic in the oil on the stovetop and then browned both sides of the chops sprinkling with the pepper. Poured in the other ingredients and let it simmer for about 20 min. Came out great.

My family enjoyed this recipe, I followed the advice of some reviews and cut the soy in half and used water for the other half, we did not think it was too salty. Very tender and juicy, even my 5-year-old ate it all! I really enjoyed how easy it was to make, I will make this again.

Had these tonight for dinner, and they are really good!  I didn't really measure, cause I am not that precise on marinades...  but made about half a recipe of this for 2 super thick pork chops.  Because of the thickness, baked at a lower temp for longer time, turning the meat over every 30 minutes...  Did not think this was too salty, but there is a definite salt tang.  Will make again, since it's not often the husband and I agree on a recipe.

We really liked this recipe.  I took the advice of others and used low sodium soy, and for me it was still salty.  When I make this again, I may add a touch of brown sugar.  Very good recipe, thanks!

So after reading many of the reviews, I decided to make this recipe w/ thick boneless chops, low sodium soy sauce, and extra garlic. I marinated for about 12 hours and then baked the whole thing, w/ the marinade for 45 minutes. The chops don't look very appetizing, but they came out very, very moist. As for taste, they were flavorful and not too salty but really, I've had much better tasting pork chops.

This was a great recipe.  I marinaded the chops for 24 hours, and they were on the tough side.  Next time I will try marnading for 12 hours instead of 24.

Good marinade.  Ease of recipe is important  to me.  I put three boneless pieces in a freezer zip-lok bag.  Added the ingredients, zip closed and massaged the meat and marinade.  Put in bowl and set in the fridge for three hours turning bag 3 times.  I am sure the longer it soaks the stronger the flavor.  I then emptied bag into 8 x 8 pyrex and placed in pre-heated oven.  30 min later done and good.  Only easier if somebody did it for you!

These pork chops were wonderful. Very nice flavor. I didn't think they were too salty as I read in some reviews. I let them marinate for 5 hours and cooked them in the marinade.

These were so good, quick and easy. I agree with others reviews they are a little salty but still very yummy! My honey did not think they were too salty. He LOVED them, I will be making these again and again. They were so tender and could be cut with a fork. The only thing different we did was use eight large cloves of garlic instead of four. In our opinion you can never have enough garlic. I served it with jasmine rice.

I like that this recipe is very easy to make. Following other users' suggestion, I used water to dilute the soy sauce and baked the pork chops in the marinade. The basic flavor is good.... but next time I would add something sweet or some spice to make the flavor more complex. Next time, I will also sear the chops instead of bake it to get more of a crisp crust.

This recipe made some very tasty and moist pork chops.  I did use low-sodium soy sauce and baked them in the dish with the marinade.  I really liked the ease of preparation for this and will make it again in the future....I think that next time I'll try grilling them.

My family loved it! Marinaded the meat overnight with regular soy sauce and had no problem with a salty taste. I guess we like that.  Adjusted the cooking time for the thickness of the chops I used. I will try this on an outdoor grill next time.

The best pork chops I have made in my young cooking career. We were planning on having left overs but that didn't happen. They went well with some mashed potatoes and white whine. I took the advice of previous reviewers and used low sodium soy sauce and added some water. It was delicious!

These were good as a basic recipe, but they need something to give them zip. Will try some other herbs next time and definitely need to marinate at least 6-8 hours or overnight. Thanks!

These were pretty tasty.  I used low sodium soy sauce and they weren't too salty (and I don't really care for salt).  I marinated for 8 hours and then baked.  I will definately make thesea again.  Thanks!

Very easy and moist. Great flavor. I marinated for about 6 hours. Placed chops and marinade in a baking dish and cooked for around 45 minutes, turning the chops every 15 minutes. Thanks Sherlock for a great new way to prepare pork chops.!

YUMMY - these turned out so moist and had lots of flavour!  I ended up marinating overnight as it was my son's soccer the night we were having them and ran out of time, so left these for the following night.  I did use low sodium soy sauce, but no changes otherwise.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe.  I did make a few changes though.  Used 1/4 C soy sauce and added 1 tbl of honey. Marinated for about 6 hrs.My family raved about these porkchops.  We used boneless pchops and cooked on the grill basting once or twice with the marinade. Will definitely make again.

Very good.  When I marinated these we had something come up that weekend so I just put them in a freezer bag and popped them in the freezer.  They still turned out wonderful. Actually they may have marinated longer that way.  Looking forward to making them again.

Wonderful. I used lower sodium soya sauce to limit saltiness and soaked overnight. Minced jarred 
garlic is a great short cut for this. The chops were soft and flavourful. I find they are best done in a glass baking dish. My toddler ate them without hesitation!

I halved the marinade ingredients as there is only two of us using "lite" soy sauce and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I used 1" thick boneless pork chops, marinated overnight.  I then grilled the pork chops.  These were the tastiest, juiciest pork chops we have ever had. When I can't grill outside, I plan on baking these chops or using my George Foreman Grill.

This was great but a bit salty.  The second time around, I added some sugar and used a little bit of orange juice and orange jest instead of lemon.

I've made pork chops like this for quite a while now, but I've always fried them in a skillet. Cooking them at a higher temperature and quicker locks in the moisture. (It's also not so salty!) Overall, a great recipe for a quick pork dinner!

This is probably the best, if not one of the best, pork chop recipes on the AllRecipes.com site!   I marinated it overnight, and used a touch more garlic than called for but we love garlic.  It is the lemon juice that really makes this marinade special.  I baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes, basting once.  So moist, so delicious.

This is one of the best marinades.  We use low sodium or lite soy sauce as the salty taste could be overpowering.  This is not only great on pork but it's also fantastic as a chicken marinade.  We're trying beef next.  YUM!

Excellent!!  Do yourself a favour and grill these on the BBQ rather than baking them if it is at all possible.  I marinated the chops for 4 or 5 hours before grilling and they were perfect.  Try these...you won't be sorry!

This is a great recipe!  I read the other reviews that said the chops turned out too salty so I tried doubling the lemon juice and I cooked the chops in a skillet instead of baking them.  It worked! My family loves this and I'll be making it again.  Thanks!

You need to use less soysauce in the recipe.
The soysauce is to strong it over powers the lemon.

This was really good. I ran out of time so didn't get to marinate at all and did not have any worcestire on hand either. Even so, it still turned out really good, and my kids ate it all up. Followed the rest of the recipe except added more lemon juice. Will make this again but will marinate and add worcestire as directed. Thank you for the recipe!

The marinade was great and gave a good flavor to the meat, I followed the recipe, as is. That said...I used boneless pork loin chops and baked them for the low end of the specified time, the were very well done and tough. I was hoping I had found a recipe where the meat was more tender but I am about to give up on pork chops.

I liked these a lot! I didn't get the pork chops I usually buy - I looked at the several kinds my grocery store sold, and used "boneless pork loin sirloin chops". Besides the marinating/cooking times, I made this recipe exactly as written.
I haven't made many "marinated" recipes, but since I like strong flavors, and I've been disappointed before, I marinated these chops for 4 hours. And I baked the chops for the full 40 minutes. The flavor was strong and savory, and I ate the chops with peas and white rice, over 4 days. This is nothing fancy, but still very tasty, and worth recommending.

I have made this alot and i usually change things around to suit our tastes but i left this alone.  I do, however, have a vacuum sealer with a marinator attachment. I marinate my chops with it and it really pulls the flavor into the meat. It makes a wonderfully easy and tasty recipe that much better.

Hi, I am just now doing this one for the first time.  I liked the ginger idea that I read in one of the comments so I've added that.  Instead of soy sauce that we commonly use here I am using one that is common in holland, an indonesian one called ketjap manis by Conimex.  I find it is much less salty yet has that rich full bodied flavour...it's great for cooking and also making peanut sauce (so easy)...  I am wondering if this recipe calls for the lid on or off of the roasting pan?

Just had this for dinner and it was very tasty.  I doubled the marinade and added the sliced mushrooms and onion overnight.  I sauted the pork chops first, adding some marinade as needed.  Then i added the mushrooms and onions and brought to a boil.  I thickened the marinade with cornstarch and served over rice.  I think this would be just as tasty making it with chicken.  Yum

Delicious! Best served with a little bit of sauce drizzled over it - but not too much, because the sauce is salty even with low-sodium soy sauce. But they are so easy and yummy!

We loved these chops.  They were tender and very flavorful.  I like others recomended used 1/2 the amount of soy sauce and substituted the other half for water.  Very good would make again.

I made this last night and we all loved it. I mixed up everything in a freezer bag, added the pork chops and let them marinate about 2 hours turning the bag.Only thing I changed was 1/4 C soy sauce 1/4 C water. Baked them with the sauce turning a couple of times. Made rice then put the juice on the rice. Very yummy Thank you Sherlock for the great recipe.

This is a plus in my recipe book! Wasn't sure how soy sauce and lemon juice would taste together along with the garlic, but it was a big hit. I marinated the pork chops in a ziplock bag for a little over an hour. Then instead of cooking it in the oven, I cooked it in my 2 quart slow cooker for 8hrs on low. The meat was so tender and juicy. Served over beef flavor rice with the juices poured over. Definate 2 thumbs up!

I made this last night. I'm filipino so I had most of the ingredients on hand. I did do 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup soy sauce. I marinated it for about 3 hours and baked it as directed. It smelled so good and tasted delicious. We ate it on top of fresh hot rice. Will make again!

The marinade for these pork chops was very good, but too salty. I diluted the soy sauce by adding half water, and it was still very salty (and I like salty). But, they tasted great. I grilled instead of baking, and I brushed the marinade several times before completion. The whole family enjoyed these, even my young kids.

Prepared recipe as written, with exception of using 1/4 C soy sauce instead of 1/2 C. My beautiful thick chops were like dried out hockey pucks when I removed them from the oven. Heat should probably be 350, not 375 and cook time about 20 minutes rather than 35-40. Will try again as I think recipe has potential. I will pray that the chops survive.

I cooked this for dinner last night and my Husband and myself loved it. I also took the suggestions that others said about cutting the soy sauce in half and added 1/4  cup of water to cut down on the saltiness. It came out perfect. I also used pork chops with bone in since I normally don't buy boneless since they always came out so dry. But with this marinate I am sure boneless pork chops will be very juicy. And I love it because I have all the ingredients on hand. Thank you for sharing this.

Unknowingly, I used low sodium soy sauce and these were great! Followed the recipe exactly, marinated them in the fridge all day and then grilled them outside, 7 minutes a side cause I used really thick cut chops. Both my husband and teenager said we should make them again.  They  both want to try this marinade on chicken too. Bet that will be good.

These were good.  Will make again.  Came out a bit dry, but that was my fault not the recipe.  My daughter liked the sauce on white rice and loved the recipe.  Not a favorite for my son-thought too sour...something to think about if you have young kids.

I read the reviews saying the chops were too salty but decided to use the full amount of soy sauce anyway.  My only change was to add an extra T of lemon juice.  They marinated for 6 hours in the fridge.  I thought the flavor was very good- the meat does not taste specifically Asian.  Just good and savory.  I did not find it too salty, just right really.  My only problem was that after baking for 35 minutes, my inch thick pork chops were quite overcooked and tough.  I will try the recipe again soon but check them after 25 minutes.  Once the toughness issue is resolved, this will be the perfect pork chop recipe- relatively healthy, tasty, and very easy!  I bet it would fare well in the crock pot too.

My pork chops were extremely thick so they actually took slightly over the recommended time.  They came out perfectly though and were nice and moist and delicious.  My DH who usually hates pork raved about them.  I used reduced sodium soy and did not find them to be too salty.

Delicious! I used 1/4c soy and 1/4c water, and it wasn't salty at all. Very moist, which makes me happy- my chops always are dry. Next time i'll use more lemon juice. Thanks!

I used thin cut boneless pork chops, which cooked up in no time at all... I also baked them in the marinade because I didn't have a lot of time to marinade them (only about 20-30 minutes). Because I feared they would come out a bit salty I  used half the soy sauce and replaced the rest with water, it worked well...  Very Flavorful! Much different than those with like creamy gravy or breading.  Nice zingy change of pace! Thanks for the recipe!

After reading other reviews commenting on the saltiness I chose to reduce the soy to 1/4 cup and also add 1/4 cup water (as others suggested). The flavor was wonderful in our pork.

These were really good. I followed the recipe amounts exactly. When making again, I will use a smaller baking dish so that the juice will not dry up as much. will be making this one again in the near future. I served it with green bean casserole- amazing combination!!!!

These were absolutely incredible!! The only thing I chnaged was that instead of lemon juice and pepper, I used a lemon pepper marinade...and, of course, added some spicy cajun seasoning.

These are great! I was a little nervous after reading the reviews about it being too salty but I didn't think it was at all. I did add a bit of honey and chopped onion and instead of using lemon juice I used lemons. I served it with corn and rice. The hubby loved it so this will make it in our rotation for sure!

This was a really easy recipe to make and it had a lot of flavor.  Marinated for a couple of hours in a ziploc bag.  Used fresh lemon juice and sliced pork loin instead of chops and it was really good.  My husband really loved these!

This was a super easy recipe for great tasting chops.  I used half low sodium soy sauce and half regular soy sauce.  The next time I will use all low sodium, since they were still a little salty.  Otherwise I would recommend this recipe and to go longer on the marinating time.

Wonderful!  My husband and I just love these!  He told me to keep this recipe about ten times while we were eating.  The only tweaks I made was to use low-sodium soy sauce and I cooked my thick cut chops about 35-40 min at 375.  Next time I want to try to add some ginger like others have suggested.

I followed the recipe as written and thought it was awful.  Way to salty. My son on the other hand could not stop ranting about how wonderful it was.  He said it was the best thing I'd fixed in quite awhile.  Go figure.  I gave it 4 stars because of how much he liked it but if I had rated it I'd have given it a 2 star. Next time I will use less Soy or try the Sodium Reduced.  I did love how tender the chops were. That part was awesome!

This is an awesome recipe.  I did make a few changes though. I used low sodium soy sauce, used the juice of one whole lemon (too lazy to measure) and a very generous sprinkle of black pepper. I had some leftover red onion from another dish so I chopped it up and added it to the marinade. (will try green onion next time) I marinated the chops for about 8 hours and baked them for only 25 mins.  Then I broiled them on high for a few minutes.  Delish!

This was great!  I used low sodium soy sauce and a 1/2 C was just the right amount.  I also skipped on the vegetable oil bc it was not needed.  I will def be making these again.

Just made these, and I have to say that the basic recipe is a great one to build on - I used boneless chops (fairly thin), and they only took 20 mins. Super easy, not rubbery at all - BUT, even with reduced-sodium soy, still way too salty. Also needed a bit of sweetness. I'll be making these again, but will probably reduce the soy by 1/2, add some honey, double the garlic, and maybe throw in some ginger for good measure. Good luck.

I thought these would be lemony, they were good but more of a soy flavor than anything else.

Very tasty. I will make this again. The sauce was delicious and the pork chops stayed moist.

Prepared as is, this recipe is very salty. However, the second time I made this marinade, I switched the amounts for the Worcestershire and the soy sauce. I used 1/2 cup of Worcestershire and only 1 tbl of soy sauce. All of the same flavors are there, but there is way less sodium!

These are good. I made the mistake of adding salt to the marinade. Duh...Soy sauce.

I needed something quick for pork chops and wanted to bake them since it was too cold to grill. Every recipe I looked at had a marinade that would take hours except this one. I was skeptical that only an hour of marinade would be enough, but I tried it and was delighted at the outcome! The pork definitely had enough time to pick up the flavor of the marinade and it kept them juicy as well. I did add some sliced onions and bell peppers to the dish which went well with the marinade. I put my meat thermometer in when I put them in the oven and took them out at about 140 degrees since the meat will continue cooking while it rests. It was about 35 mins as the recipe says. They were perfectly done and delicious. My husband said "this recipe is a keeper" when we finished our meal!

Not a fan, but that's just us. I *really* liked that it was super easy to make. May try again with some modifications, perhaps even a different kind of meat (steak or chicken), in which I will update if it's stellar.

This felt like it was missing something.  The soy dyes the pork to a funky color, so when cut open does not look very appealing.  I marinated for about 2 hours.  Not a keeper.  Sorry.

Good!  A little bit on the salty side for my taste, but the rest of my family really enjoyed it.  I'd make again just simply because it's so easy.

I put together the marinade & chops yesterday and then bf cooked these today.  Instead of baking, he fried on the stove top--probably took him 10-15 min per side, since we have really thick pork chops.  The only other different thing we did was to use 1/2 water, 1/2 soy sauce for this recipe.  I don't have reduced sodium soy sauce and paid attention to the reviews.  It's still salty with half water, but it's not unbearable.  Bf served with broccoli--a good pairing with these pork chops.  Thanks!

Found this to be way too salty.  Next time would cut back on the Soy Sauce.  I did however try it again but this time added Balsamic Vinegar.  It changed the whole taste and the chops were really tender.  I marinated them for about 4 hours.

I double the marinade and added some allspice.  I took half the marinade and put chops in for about 4 hours.  I cooked, covered, in oven for about 30 minutes and then uncovered, added the rest of the marinade and cooked for another 10 minutes.  My small kids and my husband and I really enjoyed.  Was very tender.

This is a really simple and good recipe.  I used really thinly sliced pork loin so I only cooked for about 25 minutes.  I put them in the marinade for dinner that night but we ended up doing something else for dinner, so I just drained the marinade and cooked them the next night.  Even then I didn't think they were too salty.  I did use reduced sodium soy sauce.

Made this last evening for family and "significant others"!  Nothing but rave reviews!!  As a long-time "Shakin Bake" family, I thought this recipe would probably fail.  Wrong!!!  Everyone absolutely loved it - even a girlfriend who rarely eats anything at our home!!

These chops are really tender and flavorful.  I marinated for one hour, and would recommend using reduced sodium soy sauce as the regular kind made the chops just a tad on the salty side.  I made the Balsamic Roasted Red Potatoes recipe (found on this site) as a side, and although they are very good, there were just too many flavors going on between the meat and potatoes, so next time I will be sure to make a side dish that is a little more plain.

I've made this twice now and we've loved it both times! The only difference I made was using low sodium soy sauce and I add a half teaspoon of ginger and a dash of onion salt. Great and easy recipe.

Very easy.  Great flavor.  Proabably will be good on the BBQ this summer.  A little salty, even with low-sodium soy sauce.  Served it with mashed potatoes and salad as suggested.

The flavor of these pork chops were very good. I think that they still turned out a bit dry, even after marinating them for over an hour. I think that I will cover them next time and see if they stayed a little more moist. But they were good enough to try again...thanks.

UPDATE: I tried these again and marinated them for almost 4 hours. They were smaller pork chops, yet they were still tough to chew. Not sure if we will keep making these.

This is rated 5 stars because it is very easy and tastes good.  I prepared this in a camper for our very first experience.  It worked very well.  I also baked it in the marinade.

I was a bit leary about this at first, because after mixing the marinade together it was a bit salty because I didn't have any low sodium soy sauce, but I gave it a go marinading the chops overnight. I also added a 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger. I didn't baste the chops as they were baking because they were already covered in the marinade. When they were done, I was pleasantly surprised. The meat was falling off the bone, they were delicious and everyone agreed. They weren't to salty, but for health reasons I'll use low sodium soy sauce next time. And there will definately be a next time!!!

This recipe came out great!  The trick is in the marinating, the longer the better!  Also, baste often, at least 3 times.  This also allows you to keep an eye on the chops while baking, so you don't overbake.  The only change I made to this recipe was to cut the soy sauce in 1/2.  The pork came out tender, juicy and tasty.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this recipe twice and was a hit both times.  I did use soy & water to dilute.  Marinated longer, so used 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Cooked the chops in the marinade.  Served with green beans and mashed potatoes.  Used the remaining marinade just out of the pan as gravy.  Delicious!

This was very simple and easy to make, lots of flavour. I did use 3/4 soy sauce and 1/4 water just to make sure it wasn't too salty. but I would definitely make this again and maybe try different meats.

Really good flavor. I was leery about using this much soy sauce, so I marinated about 50 minutes and then poured most of the marinade off (save 2-3 tablespoons) I also cooked for 25 minutes and the chops came out juicy and tender and with the perfect amount of flavor... We will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the chops came out very tasty. I used pork chops from Costco and they were thick so I increased the cooking time 10 minutes.

My whole family loved this recipe, even my picky 4 and 8 year olds.  I didn't make any significant changes.  I used two big spoonfuls of the already minced garlic you get in the produce section.  Garlic is such a pain to chop yourself.  Also, I used 6 slim boneless chops and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  We didn't think it was too salty.

Very good. I added some onions for flavor. For some reason the pork was dry so I might have to do something different next time.

My husband and 2 grown boys really enjoyed these chops and asked how they were done.  I thought they were good, but I'm still looking for something with a little more deep browned, roast-like flavour and not quite so salty.  We bbq'd them, and they were very tender and juicy.

Wow what a great recipe! Very flavorful! I added a bit more garlic and 5 chops and it was so moist! I did marinate the chops for about 5 hours and flipped the bag over quite a bit so the flavor would be on both sides equal. Yum Yum!!!

These were fantastic!  Some of the better pork chops I have had....that's for sure.  As others have mentioned, they are salty (I didn't have low sodium soy sauce either!!!), but when paired with mashed potatoes, they are excellent.  Will make again - thank you!

I was very impressed with this recipe. I was worried about the potential saltiness also so I only used 1/2 of the soy sauce called for and also cooked them with italian green beans in the bottom of the pan. My sons were clean platers with this one. THANKS for sharing!

We used this recipe scaled for 6 bone-in center cut pork chops.  Delicious!  It was simple and quick to prepare, cook time was short and the taste is just spicy enough without being too overpowering.  We served this dish with uncut green beans seasoned by Mrs.Dash Garlic, extra sharp cheddar mac and cheese along with some garlic/butter rolls.  It was a perfect meal.

I marinated the pork for about 2 hours and felt that was plenty of time.  I did NOT think it was too salty.  I thought it was wonderful and I WILL be making this again!!  My husband grilled the pork instead of baking it and it came out very tender and juicy.  Yum, yum, yum!!

This was a wonderful recipe-very easy to make; I added about a tsp. of brown sugar to make it kinda "sweet and salty".  Also, when baking I let the chops bake in a glass dish along with a little of the marinade instead of basting-came out great!! Thanks :)

I'm giving it 4 stars because I would make it again, and DH loved it, but it's not going to be part of the rotation or anything. :)  I made some modifications based on others reviews and I was worried about the saltiness.  I used 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup orange juice (1 fresh orange, squeezed), I also used a whole lemon.  I marinated for 2 hours and baked it for about 25 minutes as my porkchops were boneless.  In the pan, I put some fresh snap peas to bake with the chops (I liked these alot), and served with side-salad.  I like this recipe since I have the ingredients on hand, and the chops didn't dry out.  Enjoy!

This recipe is a definite "keeper!"  I used Kikkoman less  sodium soy sauce & 3/4" boneless chops.  I marinated the meat 2 hours in a food saver vacuum container.  Baked the chops in the marinade basting every 10 minutes.        The meat was moist, tender & delicious.    Served with turnip greens and turnips on the side - a most enjoyable meal!

We really liked this dish.  It was very salty, but that may have been because I halved the meat, but not the marinade.  However, the suggested mashed potatoes was a great way to cut the saltiness.  I also served it with Broccoli with Lemon Almond Butter (also from allrecipes).  My husband and I both really liked this meal, and it is in the permanent collection.
thanks for sharing!

This was super easy. My boyfriend came to the kitchen to help serve and half of the pork did not make it to the table. He could not stop eating it. Because I did not plan well enough to let it marinade over night, I cut the pork into large strips so the flavor got through but it only had to marinade a few hours. I also can't use my oven so I cooked it in a pan. It was still great.

Very good dish which got raves from the picky hubby.  I diluted the soy sauce with a bit of water, doubled the lemon, nixed the oil, and marinated the chops for 4 hours.  Yummy!

I made this marinade, but instead of using lemon juice, I substituted the juice of one orange.  I also marinated the chops for 24 hours.  They were absolutely delicious, and my husband also loved them.

I thought these were pretty good. Perhaps a little too much of the soy sauce taste. But the chops came out fairly juicy and the meat really absorbed the flavor of the marinade. A nice way to cook pork chops. I served it with rice.

I marinated 1/2" boneless loin chops for an hour, then poured the whole thing into a baking dish (lined with foil for easy clean-up).  Great flavor, and the chops were nice and tender.  Leftovers were a little tough, but still tasty.

My boyfriend usually doesn't like pork, but he loved this.  The pork comes out so full of flavor, this is one of the best pork recipes I've ever cooked!

I'm not a pork fan,but after making these porkchops,I am NOW!I followed recipe to the T but instead of black pepper,added crushed red pepper.I also cooked them on the grill and they were soooo tender and tasty! Hubby says and I quote,the juiciest,most flavorful porkchop I've ever had.I also suggest while cooking on the grill,wrap in foil with extra marinade.

Delicious, Moist and Very Easy. Didn't have a lemon so I used a lime and added some red crushed pepper - I marinated them the night before - on way home from work picked up pork lo mein, chinese style string beans - made salad while chops baked.  Dinner was on the table in 35 minutes.  This is a keeper!  Thanks Sherlock!

This was a great recipe.  I used the full amount of soy sauce and lemon and marinated for exactly 1 hour.  It was not too salty at all.  I basted throughout the cooking time and it came out so juicy!  My fiance thought it was the most perfectly cook pork chop he has ever tasted.  I would make this again in a heartbeat.  Oh, as a side note, I added Korean crushed red pepper to the marinade which gave it a nice "kick".

It was a hit, was easy to make.  I marinated it overnight, the flavor was excellent, I barbequed them.  I think the cloves of garlic that I used were too large, I will use smaller ones next time.  I will make it again for sure.

I HAVE A FAMILY OF 4 AND MADE 6 CHOPS. I HAD NOTHING LEFT! THEY LOVED IT. I THINK THIS RECIPE WOULD BE GOOD FOR CHICKEN TOO.

I made this with venison chops the other night and it was the best ever! I have told a few of my friends about this recipe and the different cuts and kinds of meat I have tried it on and they have come up with the same  conclusion...this is a keeper. You can alter the recipe with onion or garlic added or just leave it alone and it is always one the family loves!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  One word of advice though, if you like dark soya sauce you should reduce the amount the recipe calls for.  It can be overpowering and take away from the other flavours.  I liked the colour of these chops after they were cooked...they looked very appetizing.  My husband and daughter asked why i had never made them before!!

Made this and it was really good. The wife usually wants her pork chops breaded and fried, but she really like these. I made no alterations to the recipe, nor would I try to offer any advice.. they are perfect when you follow the recipe. I will be making these again!

I only marinated once but used actual garlic cloves as in the recipe and found it lacked flavor. Previously I used garlic powder. Really, really good.

I marinated the meat for 8 hours, and baked it in the marinade, basting throughout. The flavor was tasty, but I've had better. Probably won't make this again because there are better marinades out there.

I marinated some wafer thin pork chops in this recipe overnight. I put them on the grill, and they turned out wonderfully. I loved the garlic and soy flavor.  I made some hot rice to go along with it, and I think that was the perfect match.  I will definitely be making these again.

Probably my fault.  I used 1/4 cup low sodium soy sauce, and 1/4 cup water like other people suggested.  Had no taste.  I marinated for a few hours and used thick bone-in pork chops.  If I make again I will omit the water.

Absolutely amazing recipe. I took other review hints and used low sodium soy sauce but, I wish I had used the regular soy sauce as called for in the recipe. I also wish I had marinated the pork chops overnight. Next time, I will marinate overnight and prepare as directed. Everyone raved over the chops. Thank you for sharing such an awesome dish.

It doesn't get any better than this!  After reading the reviews I cut back on the soy (by half) and marinated the chops for 8 hours.   Absolutely wonderful.   Will be making these often!!

Did as directed. Heated the juice to kill bacteria and used as a dressing at the table. Everyone liked it. I only marinated it for 1 hour.  We had thick chops, cooked 30 minutes at 350 came out very moist and delicious.

Made as written.  Have to agree that the salt level was a bit much - will decrease amount of soy sauce next time.  Maybe half soy sauce, half mirin?  Think it would be good with sesame oil instead of regular oil, will try that next time.  Had boneless chops, so cooked in less time.  One thing I did differently was to mix marinade in ziptop bag, then add chops, instead of doing in pan.  Will definitely make again!

I took this recipe a step further, I breaded the chops before I put them in the oven.  Then I threw the marinated garlic on top of the chops, plus a small slice of lemon.

My family enjoyed this. I substituted Bragg's Liquid Aminos for the soy sauce, and marinated for over 24 hours. We did not find it too salty. Refreshing to find a more savory pork chop recipe that wasn't sweet. We don't like sweet. Thank you!

I foolishly made this recipe without reading the reviews and so I put the whole amount of regular soya sauce.  I hope it doesn't come out too salty.  I marinated for 2 hours and I wrapped casserole in foil and slow cooked at 275 for 2 1/2 hours.  We'll see how they turn out.  To be updated.  Update: it was very good but borderline too salty so next time I'll use a low sodium soya sauce.  Otherwise, great flavours!

I read other reviews prior to making this, but I chose to follow the recipe exactly.  It was not too salty.  I think those that baked the chops in the marinade would definitely find it too salty.  I basted the chops maybe 4 or 5 times with marinade during the cooking, and I cooked it 40 minutes.  They turned out good.  Only a 4 star for me because I actually prefer a saucy chop!  This was a nice change for me to try tho.  I will make it again.

Absolutely outstanding.  I ended up making the pork in foil packets and threw in some cauliflower florets I had on hand.  The flavor was so good that I regularly make cauliflower and potatoes this way now.  I marinate overnight and then cook in the marinade.  I'll definitely make this again - with pork and/or veggies!

I have made pork chops with this very simple recipe numerous times and they are always well received and usually disappear quickly (unless I have made far too many for the number of people, as I did recently.  However, they froze well in the sauce, and I just reheated in microwave.  I usually make this recipe with boneless chops for quick baking and use extra garlic as I like a lot of garlic.  It’s a pretty foolproof recipe & I agree that the longer they are marinated, the better they are.  I have given 5 stars based on my guests’ reactions.

Great recipe.  Took the drippings from the pan and added some cornstarch.  Sauté some Baby  Bellas, added to the gravy. Great pork chops with mushroom gravy.

I made these for supper this evening and they were delicious.  I will certainly make this dish again.  I used low sodium soy sauce and did not add any additional salt so they were just right.  Next time I am going to add some fresh sage leaves for a little more flavor.

I was a little disappointed with these...and part of that is my own fault.  I didn't check the temperature on the meat until the recommended time was up.  It was way too long for the size chops I had.  Live and learn.  Other than that error, I also felt it was missing a little bit flavor wise.  I needed to use 1/2 water and 1/2 soy sauce for sodium concerns, so maybe that was it. Others didn't seem to have that complaint when they made the substitution.  BUT, this recipe is soooo easy and quick, I will definitely try it again.  Perhaps with a bit of fresh ginger.  I think that could make all the difference.

Made this tonight for dinner and all I can say is that this recipe is simple and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as is but chose to grill the chops on the barbecue instead of baking them in the oven.  I also marinated the chope for 1/1-2 hours. A definite repeat!  Thank you for posting,

Loved! Used bone-in pork chops (thin cut) and baked for 30 minutes, basting every ten min or so.  I used low-sodium soy, but otherwise didn't change a thing.  Served with wild rice and grilled zucchini.  Definitely adding this to the dinner rotation.

Yumm! Very easy to prepare, I use low sodium soy sauce to cut down on the saltiness. I've made this twice know the first time I followed the recipe perfectly. I baked it and it turned out great, was really good, and the family loved it. The second time I made this I accidentally put 1/2 cup of lemon juice instead of 2 Tbls, whoopps. So I let it marinate in the fridge for about 4 hours then grilled the chops instead of baking them in the marinade and wow it was even better, the flavors were way more potent but not overpowering.

Easy and delicious, I doubled the marinade for 6 pork chops, more than enough.  I like salt the soy sauce was fine for me, but it could be too salty for others so maybe decrease that a bit. Will definitely keep in the rotation.

These are great!  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were perfect!  I didn't think they were too salty at all.  Both my husband and my dad agreed that they never want a pork chop prepared another way!

Wow!  I've cooked plenty of pork chops over the years, but this simple recipe is a real winner.  I used low sodium soy sauce and added extra garlic.  The low sodium soy sauce made a big difference; the pork chops didn't taste salty but had a nice balance of flavors.  I highly recommend it to everyone, and will definitely make this again.

AWESOME!  Being single, I edited to ingredients for one (eye-balled most) used low sodium soy, skipped Worcestershire, but added crushed ginger - marinated in ziploc bag about 4 hours; cooked about 20+ minutes and was PERFECT with rice pilaf - first time had a pork chop without needing apple sauce!!  oh, and basted twice at 10-minute intervals!!

The marinade is good.  I marinated them 1.5 days.  I cooked them for 40 minutes, so they were a little dry.  I will decrease the cooking time, but use this recipe again.

These were great and super easy too.  Next time I'm going to add some brocolli and other stir fry type veggies in to bake with the pork chops.

Good flavor, but I think the next time I make this I'll try searing the chops on each side prior to baking to hold in more of the juices and flavor.

I made these for my family and they were big fans. My mom said the pork had amazing flavor. They marinated for a whole day because a certain someone (me) forgot about them. But the longer the better, amIright?

I made this for my husband and I. This was delicious. I followed the directions exact except with minor adjustments. I used 2 teaspoonsful of minced garlic instead of garlic gloves. And I added some water to cut back on the salttiness. You can taste the marinade before ou put your chops in it. I let it marinate for 2 hours in the fridge then baked as directed.

These were very good. I used the reduced sodium soy sauce.  I ended up putting the ingredients together in a freezer bag and letting it marinate for 4 - 5 hours in the fridge.  I guessed at the amounts of each ingredient, since my internet crapped out on me and I couldn't get to this web site...but they turned out delish.  I would make this again.

Made this last night. It was very good. Pork chops were moist with lots of flavor. Husband and son liked it. Easy to make. Baked it a little longer than stated, since I was making 6 chops instead of 4. Was a little salty, but used low sodium soy sauce from Trader Joe's, so it was not overwhelming. Served it with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. Will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe, tasted the marinade before I put the pork chops in. Kind of bland. Added Mrs. Dash lemon pepper. Marinated for 8 hours. Chops did come out moist, but still kind of bland.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I usually like sweet marinades, and I wasn't sure the sour would work with the pork chops, but it really did.  My SO said it reminded him of traditional Mexican pork.  I loved it and I am making it again this week.  This will go into heavy rotation in my house.

My wife tried this recipe and she even used low sodium soy. Not a good way to cook pork. I like to enhance the meat flavor rather than completely change it. Also the meat was over done. Today you can cook pork like beef. Not so well done which can toughen the texture.

I like this recipe, the salt doesnt bother me at all the only issue I have is baking it at 375 degrees the gravy always burns out before the suggested  cooking time is through. 5 stars because I have been cooking it daily since I first tried it.

I loved this recipe, easy & simple. I followed some reviews with the 1/4 soy sauce & 1/4 water, I add 2 more tablespoons of lemon juice, thats if you like it lemony. I also added some drizzle of sriracha sauce, for a nice spicy kick. If you don't know what a sriracha sauce, google it!  I didn't marinate the chops over night, I made the marination & let the chops sit in them for 10 mins, turning & then stuck in the oven. I also used this marinate on chicken!

These pork chops have a  very good flavor.  Followed all the directions except used 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup Soy sauce.  Baked in marinade.  I used butterfly chops, however they were dry.  Next time will use different chops and not bake quite as long.

Delicious, low-fat marinade that added great flavor. However I'm only giving four stars because the recipe didn't specify whether to use boneless or bone-in pork chops, and whether to cover while baking or not. I used thick-cut boneless chops and did not cover (I did remarinate during cooking as directed, and also turned them over halfway through) and cooked for 35 min. They were definitely overcooked; still tasty, but overcooked. Be aware that if you use boneless chops, reduce the baking time and keep a close eye on them. I do like the idea of another reviewer who used her slow cooker and had a very juicy result!

This was absolutely delicious. My family loved it, and the aroma from the chops were tantalizing! I used low sodium soy sauce and this made no difference. I also marinated before I left for work, popped them in the oven when I got home, and 45 minutes later, they were cooked!

Not bad. I would have thought the soy sauce would engulf the lemon for sure...but it didn't. They actually did have a lemon flavor to them. Different, for sure.

This recipe was just ok to me.  Nothing terribly exciting or exceptionally good about it.  I doubled the recipe because I had 8 pork chops, cut the soy sauce in 1/2 as other reviewers suggested, added water to make up for that, everything else I did exactly as the recipe was written.  I marinated them for several hours and the chops had a very nice flavor.  They weren't too salty and had a taste of lemon to them.  The only down side to them was that they were a bit dry and tough when done cooking.  That is probably because I used very thin, boneless pork chops and I cooked them for 25 minutes in the marinade and I think they should have only been cooked for 15 - 20 minutes instead.  I will try this recipe again with less cook time or use thicker bone in pork chops.  Overall the recipe was ok and I liked the ease of it so I will probably make it again, it just didn't blow me away.

I've recently taken to cooking home meals at home, and this is an excellent alteration to regular pork chops! I took the advice of others and reduced the soy sauce in half... Another change I made was just adding 1 minced garlic clove, as my boyfriend does not do too well with lots of garlic. I would definately enjoy this recipe with sticky white rice and asparagus! ( :

These were okay.  My family says they would taste better with white rice.  This recipe may be better without so much soy sauce.

I didn't have time to do the full marinating time (only about 15 min on the countertop, stabbed the meat and squished it around so marinade would penetrate) and forgot to baste more than once in the oven (I was a bit confused about the directions but I put it in the oven IN the marinade, a no-no I'm sure but I figure if the bacteria in the meat are being cooked then the bacteria in the marinade are being cooked too ). Anyway - even so hubbie said to make sure to hang on to the recipe.

Yummy!! I added onion powder and paprika but I think that was just an added bonus BC this marinade was great originally! But I did only cook it 4 25 minutes BC 45 would have dried it out a bit I would think

Incredible!  I did not have 1/2 C. soy, so I just added a little extra chicken broth to keep the liquid consistency adequate.  These were tender and delicious- I cooked them in the broth and reduced the time since I was using a thinner chop.  A great variation on pork!

I put these in the marinade/fridge while I was at work so I could start cooking them as soon as I got home.  They marinated for about 8 hours--I would suggest doing this if you have the time.  Also, I got home late so I didn't have time to bake them in the oven.  I pan fried them and they were still phenomenal!  My only recipe suggestion is using lower sodium soy sauce....unless you like your food MEGA salty!

These had great flavoring. I added more garlic because we are a garlic family! I wasn't able to get them to cook all the way maybe the cut was too big. So I had to throw them in the pan so dinner could be served. I would use this recipe again maybe browning before baking.

This is an excellent tender recipe and one I will make again and again.  I used butterfly pork chops and substituted a few drops of hot sauce for the ground black pepper.  I did as another Reviewer suggested and marinated them overnight.  Next time I'm going to add a tablespoon of brown sugar to make this a sweet/tart taste.  Also, DO NOT bake these longer than an hour!  I cooked these an additional 20 minutes longer while I cooked a side dish and the chops came out a bit on the dry side.

Excellent recipe. I cook them on the grill. I marinated  them with the remaining marinate sauce while there where grillin. I used 1/2 soy & 1/2 water to reduced the salt. I marinated them for 4 hours frist. I cant wait to try them baked.

My family really loved this recipe.  I had been marinating my chops in soy sauce but this combination is much better.  Lots more flavor!  We cooked them on the grill.  Will be serving these lots for the summer.

A bit too salty for me, but my fiance loved them. If I make again, I'd probably try a low-sodium soy sauce or cut the ammount of soy sauce.

Yum!  I followed the recipe as stated except I used low sodium soy sauce to cut down on the salt. I marinated boneless pork chops for about 6 hours. The chops had a great flavor. I served them with the sesame green beans from this site. Next time I may add a TBSP of honey to the marinade (as other reviewers suggested). Great recipe!

Loved this recipe! Super easy and very tasty.  If you are in a rush for dinner, the chops still have a great taste even if you don't marinade them for 1 hour.  Just make sure to get basting them while they are in the oven.  About every 10 minutes.  I served this with sweet corn and sauteed green peppers with truffle oil.  A+ for me!

I thought these were okay but the hubby loved them. I'm a fan of salty foods but the soy sauce in this was too overpowering. I even used low sodium! If I make again I would probably use half soy sauce half water.

I have to agree with others that the recipe it a bit on the salty side. I made it the first time with regular soy sauce since then I have switched to only reduced sodium soy sauce since it is better for you. With the reduced sodium it turned out much better. I did slice some white onion to put on top of the chops. I served it with green beans and mashed potatoes. If it were not for the saltiness problem I am still rating the recipe a 5 because of different taste prefrences for salt.

Really enjoyed this recipe! I marinated 5 fairly thick bone-in porkchops for about 2 hrs then cooked them in the oven for 30 mins and they were great! I did take the recommendation of others and do 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup water to cut down on the salt...otherwise I'm pretty sure they would have been WAY too salty. The meat turned out nice and moist...i'll be making then again for sure!

If I had followed the recipe as written it would have been WAY too salty. Use 1/2 soy and 1/2 water as others have suggested. I ran out of sodium-reduced soy but I think the proportions there would still have to be tweaked.

A little too salty for me (and I do love salty foods!). Otherwise, really easy to make which is nice when you're tired and don't feel like slaving in the kitchen :). I will try this recipe again with a low sodium soy.

Not sure if it was something I did, but came out very dry and not very much flavor -- even though I reduced the time.  Will not make this again.

Very delicious but they would be better with low-sodium soy sauce because they were too salty.

I halfed the soy sauce, diluted with water and marinated overnight.  They were quite tasty but a bit dried out.

Took the advice of others and cut back soy to 1/4 cup, added water and Hoisin sauce to sweeten up some but still found this too salty.  Nice lemon flavour in the chops though.

I used low-sodium soy sauce, and it was still way too salty.  The marinade gave the pork a strange texture.

I am not sure why this recipe received high ratings!  We have made it twice and both times they chops come out tasting like soy sauce.  The first time they marinated for 4 hours, we thought that was the problem, so we tried 1 hour the next time.  I do not recommend this recipe!  I even used low sodium soy sauce.

These were so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I would do different next time (and there will be a next time) is to add a little more lemon juice.

These were super simple and great!  After reading some of the reviews, I made the following changes to the recipe: (1) only used 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, (2) upped the amount of Worcestershire sauce to 1/2 cup, (3) added a teaspoon more of the lemon juice, and (4) added about 1/4 teaspoon more of pepper.  I let them marinate in the fridge for about 8 hours in a plastic bag.  I then grilled them instead of cooking them in the oven.  I cooked them on med-high heat for about 6 minutes on the first side and 4 minutes on the second side.  They came out juicy and delicious.  Will definitely be making these again!

These pork chops had a great flavor, I used low sodium soy sauce to avoid an over powering saltiness. Like any other meat I make, I marinated it over night. Unfortunately mine came out overcooked even though I only cooked them for a little over 30 minutes. I should have listened to other reviews that warned about this. Next time I will check the meat at 25 minutes to avoid this problem. But I will definately be making these again.

I love this pork chop recipe.  I used boneless pork chops and I only cooked them for 25 min.  Nice and perfectly juicy.  I cut the soy sauce in half and actually, instead of soy sauce used Liquid Amino Acid which tastes like soy sauce but has a significantly lower amount of salt.  I also used more lemon.  We had this with brown rice and aspargus.  Will keep this in the rotation.

I marinated bone-in pork chops for less than an hour and I loved the taste (I think marinating it for less time is the key).   My husband raved about the chops and I am excited about eating the leftovers!

This recipe was fantastic. I cut the soy in half as other reviews suggested and it turned out perfect. I baked mine in the marinade and then used it as a gravy over mashed potatoes. YUM!

Made these for supper last night, The flavor was great. I did half the low sodium soy sauce with water. However, I think they need to marinate a bit longer or cook at a lower heat longer so they will become more tender. My hubby, who LOVES, FRIED pork chops, even said it tasted good. I will try it again.

I used the suggestions of other reviews and used 1/4 c. soy sauce and 1/4 c. water.  The flavor was wonderful.  I used boneless pork chops and baked them only 20 minutes.  I will definately make again.

This is a keeper receipe. The only change we made was to add the zest of the lemon we used. It added more flavor. Very moist all the way through. We will be making this on again and again.

These tasted pretty good but were pretty dry.  I'm not sure why. I'll try the recipe again but maybe cut the bake time a little. Does using a boneless loin chop make a difference?  Maybe that's why the pork was dry.  **Update**Used low sodium soy, Tbsp water, marinate overnight, decrease temp to 350, and cook 25-30 minutes .

VERY easy recipe because all the 5 ing. every kitchen has on hand.  I never go by the cooking time for pork cause if I did on this one the pork would have been dry.  I cooked six thick chops uncovered for 30 minutes.  Will surely make again because this is such an easy recipe.

This was really good. I used bone in thick center cut chops and it worked very well. I was worried my husband wouldn't like it because he isn't a big fan of soy sauce, but he also gave me rave reviews. Thanks for the great recipe!

This were amazing! I added some semi-boiled potato wedges and chopped onions and it turned up great. My husband also loved them.

Very good, very easy to make.  I used low sodium soy sauce, and marinated less than an hour due to time constraints.  Next time I'll marinate longer, but I can't imagine them tasting better.

These were very good. My DH liked it a lot more than I did. He raved about them, I just thought they were good. I baked them in the marinade turning over halfway through. When I make them again I will repeat this.

Good, but too salty.  I'll try less soy sauce next time.  The marinade did make the meat very tender.

Tried this last night and didn't really care for it.  I think we're just not huge on using soy sauce as the base for marinades.  Definitely a personal taste thing.  I did cut back on the soy as suggested by others, and that helped with the saltiness.  Also used low sodium soy sauce.

Way too salty for my taste. I used low-sodium soy sauce and only marinated for 2 hrs. It was very juicy and tender though. Probably will do again though, my husband loved it. He loves salty foods and thought this was great.

Everyone in my family loved this! It was a nice change from the usual "Shake n Bake" and healthier, too. I only marinated the chops for an hour and it tasted like I had marinated them all day.

I was looking for a new pork chop recipe and this was fabulous!  I barbequed the pork chops instead of baking.  I would definitely make this again.

This dish came out nicely, I didn't marinate very long, only around 20 minutes.  For diet purposes, I added a small amount of shredded monteray jack cheese on top of the meat once it was finished and cut on my plate.  I did try the meat without the cheese though and it tasted pretty good although I wasn't jumping for joy.  I served this meal with butter garlic cauliflower and brocolli.  I will use this marinade combination with pork again.

I marinated the chops overnight and the marinade was way too salty. I think next time I will use less soy sauce and use low sodium soy sauce. I will use less garlic too. However, I think this would be a GREAT marinade for steaks!!

I needed an eazy meal and put pork chops in marinade for 6 hours prior to cooking, they were wonderful, so tender and very flavorable. I served with Parmesean Rice and green beans, hubby thought it was a great meal.

This recipe has great flavor and very easy to make. I cooked for 35 minutes, but came out dry. So I will give it another try and cook for 30 minutes or less depending how thick the chops are. Husband really loved the flavor!

This recipe was great!  I made it for my daughter's Hawiian themed birthday party and everyone loved it.  I highly recomend it.  I can't wait to make it again.  It is a little salty so if you don't like salty food you may want to use a low sodium soy sauce.

Loved this recipe.  I used lite soy sauce and added 1 tablespoon of orange juice.  Next time might add more lemon juice because you really couldn't taste the lemon.

This was very good and very easy, I would definitely make it again. I was surprised at how tender and moist the chops were.  When I put it in the oven I started thinking they might turn out dry.  I marinated the chops in a ziploc bag for over 7 hours.  The lemon taste was very subtle to me, my husband didn't even realize there was lemon in the dish.  So, if you want a real lemon flavor I would add more than the recipe calls for.

I think it was a little to salty because of the soy sauce, next time I will use less.   It is also great on the grill!!

These were good.  The soy sauce taste was a little too strong for my family but I might try again with less soy sauce.

I used 1/4 cup of soy sauce instead for this recipe.  I would recommend balancing the marinade by tasting it first before adding the chops so the chops don't end up too salty.  Perhaps, using a light soy sauce is one of the best options too.  Would not make this one again.

These were great!  I was weary with my first couple bites.  This, as I got the taste in my mouth, I ate all of it.  I was surprised, the more I ate the more I wanted.  I'm a big soy fan, so I used the right amount, with extra garlic.  We loved them!  Will put with the favorites for sure!

These were awesome.  I marinated for 4-5 hours, and they turned out really good and so tender!  The marinade lent a great flavour- not super strong as I thought they might be.  Just right.  This is my new favourite way to serve chops.  I bet they'll be good grilled on the bbq too...

This marinade is a nice alternative to the often "sweet" ones used in so many pork recipes.
I will make this again.

Too salty, and the soy sauce flavor overpowered the other ingredients - next time I will use half the amount of soy sauce.  However my husband liked these and did not think they were too salty - it depends on what you like I guess.

This was a wonderful recipie, with the potent mix of garlic and lemon for the marinade.  To me the lemon was a little strong, so if your not big into lemon, I would suggest to lower the amount you put into it.  Otherwise, it was great, and I would devour it again!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this marinade. I was a bit wary of the amount of soy sauce, from teh other reviews, but I ended up liking it just as it is. I'll be using this again.

Thought these were just "O.K."  My husband didn't say much at dinner about these pork chops which usually means he is just trying to be polite by not critiquing my latest new recipe.  My pork chops were of a medium thickness and turned out a little on the dry side.  I did marinate the pork for 3 to 4 hours.  They were flavorful, but nothing to write home about!

The flavor of soy sauce in this recipe is rather overwhelming, in fact my Husband didn't like it.  I think next time I would add something like honey to this recipe in order to balance the flavor.

Very good the pork comes out so juicy and tender.  And doesn't take much in prep work.

This is a great recipe to remove yourself from the Shake n Bake rut.  The pork was moist and tender and my picky boyfriend loved it.

This was awful.  It tasted like a rotten lemon.  Maybe marinating it overnight was too long but I always marinate my meats overnight and it's supposed to taste better not worse.  Needless to say, I won't be making this again.....Sorry!
