I used one packet Splenda instead of one packet Sweet N Low. To make the ingredients mix easier and to make it cold at the same time, I threw everything into a martini shaker with ice and shook a bit before pouring it into a glass. Very tasty!

3.16.18  I loved the tartness of the cherry juice and the lime, so I added very, very little sugar substitute.  I didn't have any soda water, so I used La Croix® coconut sparkling water and would do so again.  Very refreshing!

I’m not a fan of sweet drinks and thought tart cherry juice would be good. I didn’t add any sugar or sugar substitute and this drink was still far to sugary for me.  I won’t be making it again but I’m sure some would find this very tasty.
