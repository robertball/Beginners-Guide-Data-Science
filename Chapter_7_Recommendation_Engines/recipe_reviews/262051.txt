I used chuck roast, jarred recaito, homemade sofrito I had handy, and capers in place of olives. The capers gave that same vinegar/salt taste that olives do and I had them already because I use them in my familyâ€™s Puerto Rican recipes often. 
Overall the flavor was great. I made 3 lbs of chuck roast and adjusted the seasonings and ingredients (other than the onion and diced tomatoes which I kept the same) to fit. The arepas were delicious! My 9 year old loved this recipe. Will definitely make again.

This turned out really good. Note that the reciato is duplicated in the ingredient list. I used jarred but would like to make my own next time. Sofrito is easy to make but you can buy that jarred as well. The only thing I did a little differently was that after the roast was cooked I shredded it and crisped it up in a skillet. Just a personal preference is all. The green olives were a nice touch but I don't feel the carrots added anything . While the arepas are more than likely traditional, they are a bit of a pain.  Next time I'll save myself a step and just use tortilla's.  Overall this is a good recipe with a lot of flavor and one I would make again.
