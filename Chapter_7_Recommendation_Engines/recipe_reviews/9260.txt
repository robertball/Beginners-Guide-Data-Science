I chose this punch to serve at my daughters wedding based on the previous reviews and the fact that I had a surplus of sparkling cider. I have a warning for you-if you make this make about triple the recipe for the number of people you have. The recipe makes plenty however this punch is SO good and people like it SO much it goes fast! We actually ran out of punch even though I had doubled the recipe for the number expected. Everyone LOVED it!

I used this for a Girl Baby Shower with pink lemonade and it was perfect!  I was surprised by the perfect blend of this recipe.  It wasn't too sweet or too tart.  I didn't add any extra sugar to mine and I loved it.

I made this punch for a bridal shower last week and everyone loved it.  We couldn't get the punch bowl refilled fast enough!

I made this punch for the holidays and when I went to the grocery store I forgot my list so I had to "wing it" and for some reason I could have sworn the recipe called for limes and when I reread I saw that it didn't.  I still put them in the punch bowl with everything else it made a nice presentation.  I did not add all the sugar at one time I added to taste and did not end of using all of it.  I would suggest keeping all ingredients on hand I had to make a couple of bowlfuls, definetly a keeper.

Made this for a church dinner and it was gone before the first wave of people went through. I made a double batch as many others suggested and it was still gone really fast.
Instead of regular ice cubes I made lemonade ice cubes with maraschino cherries in them. I used one can frozen lemonade, the juice from the jar of maraschino cherries, and 1 1/2 cans water poured into three ice cube trays and put at least one cherry in each cube. It really added some nice color and they also kept it cold without watering it down.

I served this at a baby shower that I threw along w/ tea & coffee & we went through 2 punch bowls of this w/o even touching the other drinks. It is fantastic! It would be really good w/ champagne instead of the sparkling cider for a wedding shower too. Everyone wanted the recipe. This is one of those rare punches that doesn't leave you feeling thirsty.

Light & refreshing!  Punch has been a hit everytime I've served it.  I always seem to run out not matter how much I make.  Will make again & again.

Served this punch at my daughter's bridal shower.  Everyone enjoyed it a lot.  Probable will add the sugar before the water & cider next time, just to get it blended better, but good recipe.  Thanks.

I doubled the recipe, which filled the punch bowl perfectly.  It tasted pretty good, but not the best punch I've ever had.

One reason that everyone is running short is that the servings yield is incorrect. This recipe makes 86 US ounces, or 8 3/4 cups. (a liter is just over 32 oz., or 4 cups, 750 ml is about 3 cups) The recipe yields 14 (6 oz.) punch cup servings, not 20.

I made this for my daughters bridal shower.  It was a hit!  I only regret I didn't make more, we run out really fast.  Very refreshing, for the Florida hot summer days.

I made this punch for Easter brunch and it was a HUGE hit!  It was light, refreshing and not too sweet.  Instead of ice cubes I sliced and froze the lemons, oranges, and a few limes (for added color) and added them right before serving.  They chilled the punch without diluting it at all.  I will definitely make this again!

I catered a friend's bridal shower and made this punch.  I was a little underwhelmed with the taste.  It was just kind of bland, I thought.  I also served a lemonade/ice tea mix at the shower, and that was the more popular drink.

I recently made this punch for my son's first birthday party. I have a new rug and with lots of little ones I wanted a 'clear' punch. This was perfect. It was completely gone by the end of the party, everyone thought it was delicious. I doubled the recipe and modified just slightly. 2 cans frozen lemonade, 2 L of club soda, 2 bottles of sparkling apple cider, 2/3 of a bottle of Ginger Ale and approximately 15oz of water. I added the extra ingredients because i found the lemondade concentrate a little bit strong and bitter. I did not add any extra sugar. Oh and I also used clementines, lemons and a few marachino cherries for color. It was really wonderful. Can't wait for an excuse to make again.

Very yummy!  I made this for my daughter's 1-year birthday party, so i used pink lemonade to give it a light pink color.  And since i used lemon-lime soda instead of carbonated water, i omitted the sugar (which would have made it way to sweet with the soda). This punch was sooo good!  I made a double batch but only used 1 large orange, 1 lemon, 1 lime, and a handful of marshino cherries :)  It was colorful and looked awesome!!!  You definitely don't need 3 large oranges though.  I had a big punch bowl and mine was full enough with the fruits that i mentioned above.  Excellent recipe though!

I made this with pink lemonade for a baby shower. An idea from another recipe was to make the ice cubes out of the lemonade and then alternate dropping maraschino cherries & pineapple into the cubes.

Made this for a baby shower, and it was a huge hit!  I doubled the batch and added limes as well as the lemons and oranges.  My only changes/suggestions would be that if you double the batch, only use 1 1/2 cans of the lemonade concentrate and don't double the fruit.  The punch was ALMOST too sweet (I didn't add any sugar) and I had loads of extra fruit since I doubled that, too.  

All in all, a massive success, it was the first thing to disappear, a double batch was gone in about an hour and a half, with about 25 people in attendance.

I tried this punch.  I always use the recipes that have 4+ stars.  However, I was disappointed in this one.  It had very little flavor.  I will not use this again.

Delicious!  I used pink lemonaid instead for a girl's baby shower.  I did not float the fruit in the bowl, instead I froze lemons and oranges into my ice ring, and it turned out great!  Everyone LOVED it.   One note -- the sparkling cider is a little difficult to find.  I usually buy Martinelli's brand, but it turns out, places like Walmart only carry it during Christmas and New Years.

This is a wonderful, refeshing punch.  Perfect for warm summer gatherings.  Like others, I omitted the sugar as the punch didn't need it.  Served it at a baby shower, where people drank as is or mixed with champagne, and got rave reviews! Will make this again.

Made this punch for my son's 4th birthday. The only thing I changed was omitting the sugar and the ice cubes (I'd stored the club soda and apple cider in the fridge, so they were cold enough). It turned out amazingly well - not too crazy-sweet, and both the kids and adults loved it. Will definitely make it again.

Easy and a crowd pleaser.  I made it for a bridal shower and it went fast.  I just used the lemon slices, and threw in some black berries and marachino cherries for color.  Double the recipe and it will still go fast.  I did not add the sugar since I added the cherries (juice drained)

Very good.  At Christmas we added 2 bottles of champagne in place of the club soda and upped the sugar to about 1/4 cup.  It did not last long.  I agree with the other reviews: this punch does not leave you feeling thirsty.  Doubling or tripling the recipe is always a good idea when you have a crowd.

This punch was a HUGE success at my spa party as a non alcohol beverage for those who didn't want wine. I sliced the orange and lemon into wedges so they could be poured into the glasses as well, and after the oranges had soaked in the punch they were very yummy! This would be perfect for a summer bbq too, refreshing and quenching. For sure a keeper!!!

I simplified.  I used a ratio of 2 cups of Newman's Lemondade in a carton (no high fructose corn syrup) for each bottle of sparking cidar.  I made for an office wedding shower.  It was fast, easy, attractive and well received.

I really loved this punch. It was different than what is normally served at showers etc.  I Did mine with two cans limeade, thawed, two 2Liter gingerales and a gallon of apple cidar.  cut up various fruits for a pretty presentation. It was good to go.  I did not add any extra sugar.

This was a huge hit at my baby shower. The only thing I did different was top it with frozen raspberries. They helped keep it a little colder and gave the punch a little hint of berry. I had several people ask for the recipe. Yummy!

Excellent!  Made this for a friends bridal shower and it went quicker than the mimosas!  Making it for my baby shower this weekend...double batch!  I froze raspberries and mint in ice cubes to add a bit more color.  Would also recommend medium sized oranges...3 large seemed too much. 

Doubled the recipe for the shower and turned out great.  I used pink lemonade but it didn't make that much difference in the color or flavor...so whatever you have access to works.

Yummy! I served this at a Bunco Night that I hosted and everyone liked it! I used equal amounts of ginger ale & sparkling soda water, 1 can of pink lemonade, one orange cut up, and 1 small jar of marachino cherries next time I'll add the juice too).  Extra sugar and lemons would have been too much. After doubling, we had some left over the next morning and my kids loved it. Surprisingly, there was still some carbonation the next day. So, feel free to make this an hour or two ahead of time (without the ice, of course).

I served this at a retirement party and received many positive compliments on it. I left out the sugar and because we served it from a beverage cambro rather then a punch bowl I did not use the sliced oranges and lemons but added a can of oj concentrate. It was very refreshing and I will be serving it again.

Perfect for summer!!!!!!! Refreshing and easy. I made this punch for a birthday party and it was a huge hit with everyone!!
Some of the adults added vodka or Malibu Rum to their glass and that was really good, too.
I'll most definitely be making this again & again!!!!

This was refreshing, but not nearly as amazing as I expected given the reviews. I served this punch at a baby shower. I doubled the recipe based on some of the reviews I saw, thinking it would be gone quickly. I had more than half left over after the party.

Made with lemon/lime selzer water and left out the sugar and it was excellent. Bright and refreshing. I added slieced limes, oranges and lemons for color - it was very pretty in the punch bowl. Will make again and will try with pink lemonade too.

Really wonderful recipe.  I made a "mistake" and bought tonic water for one of the carbonated waters.  It gave it a wonderful tang that I think I will repeat in the future. . . very refreshing  . . . everyone is correct advising to buy extra ingredients because I've never had any left!

This punch was fantastic!  It was such a welcome departure for the typical cloudy, sticky, sherbet punch.  I made it for a baby shower, doubled it for a 7 quart punch bowl, and added extra carbonated water,  Per one of the other reviewers, I got the idea to float rubber duckies on top of the punch.  It was darlings.  It was a baby girl shower and we used pink lemonade and a tiny drop of red food color to make the punch a beautiful pale pink.  Use crystal clear store bought ice, and the whole punch bowl with sparkle.

I made this for a Christmas party and baby shower. No sugar. Sprite instead of club soda. Pink lemonade can. It was light and delicious, no leftovers either time. For the baby shower I added raspberry sherbert for extra pink and some frothiness. Ladies and kids alike loved it. This is the only punch recipe I will use. Thanks!

Made this for a birthday party open house with 60 people.  Quadrupled the recipe and ran out - it got rave reviews.  I used pink lemonade and skipped the suger.  instead of the ice cubes, I froze a 12 oz can of limeade, 2 cans of water and slices of 2 small limes in a bundt pan and used that for the ice ring.  I didn't use the orange and lemon slices (forgot them at home!).  Will definitely make this again

Refreshing flavor that isn't too sweet! My guests loved it. The only change I would make would be to halve the amount of sliced oranges and lemons and leave the tablespoon of sugar out.

I made this for a baby shower and should have done what other suggested...I should have doubled the recipe!  It was gone and nearly everyone asked for the recipe.  I love that it was refreshing and not too sweet.  I did substitute pink lemonade for the regular lemonade.  Great recipe!

Delicious! You'll need to make extra because everyone loves it! Family and friends now request it and expect it for all occasions. FYI: I substitute the club soda and sugar for a liter of sprite.

Made this for my book club following the recipe with no exceptions.  For those of us who wanted to add hooch, after trying a few options, we agreed rum was the best. Next time, I will follow others advice and omit the sugar. It was a bit on too sweet for my taste. Overall it tasted refreshing, fresh, sweet with a nice fizz from the bubble..

This is a very delicious non alcoholic punch. We've used this recipe a few times for parties and never have any leftovers even after doubling or tripling the recipe. A keeper!

I have made this punch several times and it is always a crowd pleaser; plan to make extra servings!!!  I, however, never add any sugar as it is sweet enough without it.

Really delicious! I'm not a big punch drinker but this was nice and light and citrus-y and not too sweet. We made about half the recipe for a small party, but probably could've served the whole thing. Everyone loved it.

Everyone loved this! I added enough sugar to taste and only used half the lemons suggested. I made 40 servings for 20 people and just about ran out. You will definately get asked for this recipe.

Not very impressed by this punch - doesn't have very much flavor.  Glad I tried this out before the baby shower because I will have to find another punch recipe.

Delicious!  The amount of fruit overwhelmed my punch bowl a bit, but we still guzzled down all the punch - and then ate the fruit after the company was gone.  Will definitely make again.  My  FIL said it would be wonderful with vodka or gin added (I don't see the need!).

I just served this punch at an 80th birthday party for over 100 people.  I chose it strictly because of the good reviews, and they were right on.  Everyone, all ages, loved this punch.  The only problem is that I ran out.  So make plenty!  Unlike most sweet punches, this one is really refreshing and thirst quenching.  Thanks for a great recipe

The punch was awesome -- everyone at the reception (not for a wedding) loved it and wanted the recipe.  I was making the punch at the event site and had forgotten sugar, and I don't think anyone mixed it.  I think you should probably just leave it out, especially if your lemonade concentrate is sweetened.  Also, if you up the number of servings, you probably don't need to up the number of oranges/lemons.  I made the recipe for 50, used 4-5 oranges and two lemons, and the bowl was maybe a little too full of fruit (appearance-wise).

Great! This is by far one of the best punch recipes I've tried. It would be wise to take the advise of everyone here and double the recipe... it goes fast!  This recipe is also really good if you use frozen orange juice if you don't have the frozen lemonade on hand.  I also started using frozen fruit instead of ice cubes... keeps the punch cold and is a yummy treat!

Very good & refreshing!  Great punch for a hot day.  The only change I made was that I didn't like the idea of adding sugar to the mixture.  So instead I used half 7up & half club soda for the "carbonated water".  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful!  Adults and teens enjoyed this.  I needed to refill the punchbowl several times, and was asked for the recipe.

Will be making this for Christmas, and anticipate being asked to add this to the  holiday menu on an annual basis.

I'm adding my kudos to other reviewers for this punch.  I served it New Year's day to 30 people and it was a hit!  Several comments on how delicious and refreshing it is. I took hints from others and did not add sugar - it doesn't need it. Also, the "punch cubes" and frozen lemon/lime slices were a plus! Thanks for this recipe, it's definitely a keeper!  Make sure you have enough. I had triple ingredients for 30 people.

Interesting.  I made this for our family Christmas gathering.  Couldn't decide if we "loved" it, however we continued to go back for more and the bowl was empty before we knew it.  BTW, also good with some spiced rum!

If you don't want the "fizz" to disappear so quickly, make huge ice cubes.  They won't melt as fast and you can freeze cherries or lemon slices in them to make a great presentation.  I use a 12 or 16 oz. Solo cup and freeze them the night before.

Absolutely by far, best punch ever!
I doubled the recipe based on other reviews, we had 15 people here last night and there was maybe 2 or 3 cups left in the bowl.
Everyone loved it, and went back for more!

This was a cinch to make and was delicious!  Made it for our Bunko party and all the ladies raved about it.  I would suggest having extra ingredients on hand to make more!

I made this for my mom's birthday party. I doubled the recipe and it did not last long. All I was able to get was a sip of my mom's. Although she thought it was a little strong, everyone else loved it.

Very refreshing.  It is perfect without adding sugar.  I served this at a baby shower... and will so we did not add alcohol.  It will be a great summer party punch with champagne... or vodka!  Loved it!

Amazing, addicting, and added to my all-time favorites recipe collection!  I'd be willing to bet this recipe has circled the globe twice since I made it for a Christmas party last month!  Total yum.  Thanks Mathilda!

A great summer punch - not heavy and goes well with food since it's not too sweet!  I used pink lemonade.  Served it in a large clear glass beverage jar with spigot - looked beautiful.

I had a Southern Living party and served this punch. I wanted a nice non- alcholic punch that satified both groups of people. This was a hit. I even added a few maraschino cherries for color- It went so fast- I wish I had the ingredients to make more!

I too used this for a baby shower, I only made one batch and it went before the guest of honor arrived.   Since I made this at the last minute I had to use what I had on hand. Did not use lemons or sugar. I only cut up 2 oranges, used Pink Lemonade concentrate and used lemon seltzer.   Some guests mixed this with their white wine. It was a hit! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit.  The entire bowl was gone very quickly.  This is a nice light punch that goes with everything and is not too sweet.  I will definitely make this again!

Read the reviews and I used the pink lemonade, and froze my lemons & oranges.  Also had some frozen strawberries so threw those in along with some fresh raspberries and blackberries.  Did not need to add any sugar, it was excellent and everyone loved it.  Next time maybe champagne or some rum for the adults.

Excellent, lively drink, and not too sweet (I only used a teaspoon of sugar).  Everyone liked it.  Wish I'd purchased enough ingredients to make a double batch.  After the liquid was gone, we had fun eating the leftover fruit which had absorbed the liquid.  I'm not much of a cook, but next time I might add frozen grapes.  Thank you, Mathilda!

Made this punch for a party. Many people enjoyed the punch. I left out the sugar and made a fruit ice ring with 1/2 ginger ale and 1/2 club soda. I added maraschino cherries to the ring as well. It turned out great.

Made this for a work Christmas party at our home. It was very good, but from the volume drank it was not nearly as popular as the pomegranate/cranberry punch sitting right next to it.  Would probably make it again for my family, who have simpler tastes.

I made this punch for my twins' 2nd bday party as there were tons of kids and I wanted something non-alcoholic and fun. I ran out halfway through because all the adults were drinking it too! Perfect just the way it is.

Fabulous punch! Only change I made was to omit the white sugar. So easy & so delicious. I wish I had made more because it went so quickly! Will definitely make this again. Thank you!

Very good but instead of using carbonated water and adding sugar to taste, I used lemon lime soda.  It did sparkle and the sliced fruit was a nice touch!

I have made this punch for several occasions and it is a HUGE hit. Instead of carbonated water, I like to use 1 liter of key lime sparkling water. This recipe is light and refreshing.

Wonderful punch without all the sticky sweetness.  Used pink lemonade for a baby shower, and left out the sugar. It was perfect.

Delicious!  I served this at a ladies tea yesterday and my friends thought it was quite tasty.  I made it with pink lemonade and floated lime slices which was a nice color addition to our tea sandwiches.  I've already been asked to bring this to a baby shower!

This Punch is VERY good!!! Easy to put together and a nice change from the traditional "pinapple and Sherbert" type punch at most showers/receptions.  It was fresh and light, and looked great with all the sliced lemons and oranges!!

So I get ready to make this and can't find sparkling apple cider ANYWHERE! I grab sparkling white grape and it turned out great! I didn't need the sugar, since I used a lemon-lime soda. I sliced and froze 1 lemon, 1 lime, and 1 orange. It was pretty and delish! Whew!

Simple, very light and refreshing.  I used sparkling grape juice vs. apple because that's what I could find!   I thought it was really good and would make it again, however it didn't win out vs. the alocholic drinks :)

SO good!!!!!!  Made this for my daughter's first bday party. Used a 12oz can of pink lemonade instead of 6oz, but otherwise everything else followed recipe. Didn't need any sugar - perfect as is. This will definitely be my new go to punch recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Great punch! I had this for my baby shower and it was a hit! Of course I had a couple bottles of white wine on the side for those who wanted to drink. All baby showers need a little alcohol! Super easy to make too!

This was fresh and easy to make! We got to the supermarket and found that they had sold out of sparkling apple cider, but had sparkling apple-cranberry cider. The cranberry gave it a nice autumn kick, and we got great reviews. People added brandy, rum, and/or vodka with no complaints :) thank you!

This was a really nice punch, not really strong and just really pretty and fizzy.  I was afraid that I would have a bunch left over since I only had about 13 people to serve  but nope, it all got guzzled down by my guests even though I also had tea and coffee offered.  Great recipe.  If you have more thatn about 15 people you will probably want double the ingredients on hand since this will be a hit.

I made this for a Christmas party and it was so delicious that I had to keep refilling the punch bowl.  It is the perfect recipe if you don't want anything too sweet.  It is light and refreshing.

I made this with frozen pink lemonade for my sister's baby shower (it's a girl) and everyone loved it.  It was a good mixture of sweet and sour while drinking it, but everyone wanted water afterward.  I will definitely make this again.

Loved this punch.  Made a double batch for my daughter's communion and it was all gone.  Should have made triple!  Very light and refreshing.

Tastes great and was a big hit at my party!  I doubled the recipe amount for 20 guests, but the punch was so popular that it ran out very fast, so I recommend making more than the amount stated in the recipe.

This is the BEST punch recipe ever!!!  I made it for a baby shower (2 batches) and it was gone!  I'd like to try it sometime with champagne instead of the club soda, for an adult beverage.  :)

I've made this recipe for a bridal shower and Christmas dinner and both groups loved it!  The only change I made was using about half the cut fruit.

After reading the reviews, I too chose this punch recipe for my daughter's baby shower. It received an overwhelming response. I had double the recipe and we still ran out and the soda bottles were hardly touched. I even forgot the small bit of sugar and it was fantastic!

We made this for Christmas because I was looking for something that did not include pineapple due to food allergies. Well, It was gone by the end of our visit and everyone loved it! Nobody even touched the pop. We decided to make it again yesterday for my other side of the family everyone drank it all up!  I am planning to make it for my son’s graduation party this summer! Thanks for this great recipe!

My go to punch for the holidays! Even in an all adult party I get asked for this recipe! So refreshing! I doubled the recipe and 17 people drank every drop this Christmas! TIP: Slice lemons and oranges ahead of time and freeze them so you won't dilute the punch!

I used 1 bottle of normal sparkling apple cider and 1 bottle of apple cranberry cider. The trick to getting it super flavorful is add the lemons, oranges, and cider into the punch bowl a couple hours before serving and then add the club soda.  I also didn't add ice cubes or sugar.  It was very good and flavorful.  I would describe it as zingy.

If I could give 4.5 stars I would:) It was a very nice punch, and one I'm sure I would make again. I used ginger ale and no sugar rather than tonic water, and 2 cans of the frozen pink lemonade, and it was good, but I would probably add some cranberry juice next time, just for a bit more body.

We made this for a pre-prom party and quadrupled the recipe. The narrative says it has orange juice but the recipe indicates only a few sliced oranges. I forgot to add the sugar, and it was still great.  It was served in a decanter, and even though we 4x the recipe, we “recycled” the garnishing fruit. Good, good, good!

I made this punch when I hosted my kids' book club, and it was perfect!  Make sure you have ingredients to make several bowls; it goes fast!
UPDATE: I served this again at a birthday party.  I used a mandolin slicer to get the citrus really thinly sliced, and accidentally forgot to add the sugar, and my guests loved it even more!

This recipe is light and refreshing and very forgiving.  If you don't have club coda you can use sprite or 7-up or any diet version of lemon lime soda.  If you want  to use champagne you can substitute that for the sparkling wine.  I'm often asked for the recipe and often asked to make punch for parties and showers.  This is my go to recipe.

It didn't make as much as I hoped, but it tasted great, and  I didn't get to add the sliced fruit, as I forgot until after everyone was here. and I didn't have to add any sugar.  Even had someone mix it half an half with iced tea and loved it. mins came out more of a faded orange color, not the pretty pink in the picture. and no were in the recipe does it call for orange juice like the description said. I will be making it again.

I made this for a fall baby shower and what a hit it was! We named it "Harvest Punch" at the shower because t had the most refreshing fall flavoring to it. It went fairly quickly and everyone seemed to love it.

Kids and adults loved it at our Christmas Party.   It lasted only 30 minutes.   Next time I will, juice half the fruit and cut the rest.

Made this for a baby shower.  Delicious and really refreshing!
Doubled recipe and was plenty for group of 24 (not everyone drank the punch because served wine, too).  Did not use the sugar- not necessary.  Going to serve it for my staff Xmas party for the non-alcoholic beverage.
Would be very good if guests wanted to spike it with vodka!

I followed previous suggestions, doubled it for my 2 1/2 gallon beverage dispenser, but didn't double the fruit. I also used 2 trays of ice made of  1  12-oz can frozen pink lemonade concentrate, 1 1/2 cans water, and the juice from a jar of maraschino cherries, putting a cherry in each cube (it actually filled 3 trays, but I only used 2). I chilled all the liquid before making the punch. It was WONDERFUL, and my guests loved it. With Mimosas and Cucumber Water, this was plenty for a baby Shower for 25

OK, I'm the crazy, fun mom in the 'hood, so naturally I put a spin on this I've named "fish in the pond" for the kids around my summer cabin near the lake.

I did use the lemons and oranges- although I might use limes for lilly pads next time. I went with lemon polar water in place of club soda, frozen pina colada concentrate (non-alcoholic) for the texture and color continuity. I added one bottle of sparkling white pear juice to keep the color from overpowering the 3 bottles of Jones blue berry lemonade soda and skipped the added sugar.

From IKEA, I already had fish and starfish shaped ice cube trays and to finish it, I served with Swedish fish swimming in each cup I served. Great summer treat! The kids loved it!

I cut the recipe in half since I was only making it for my husband and myself. I used pink lemonade concentrate and did not add the sugar. It came out great and I will definitely be making this again but I think next time I'll use more lemons (I like more tart than sweet).

Awesome and so easy!  Actually, I forgot to make the punch and left out the fruit.  Still great.  Wish I had remembered the fruit, but not absolutely necessary.  I left out the sugar and instead of sparkling apple cidar I added ICE blackberry.  it was AWESOME and so easy!  

Definitely! a keeper!

Made this exactly as written but minus the sugar it was perfectly sweet enough as it is. It was also a big hit! Several people ask me for the recipe and couldn't believe how easy it was. Definitely going to make this a keeper.

I made this punch for Christmas dinner and I was amazed at how fast it was gone. It's not too sweet(I didn't add sugar) so its easy to drink without feeling thirsty afterwards. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe worked out very well for my Holiday party..  Quick and easy to make, loved that I didn't have to make ahead of time and was able to make more on the spot.  Fresh and light taste - and not too sweet. Did not add the extra sugar.

I have made this recipe several times for work functions. A couple of times I made it for a boy baby shower and substituted blueberries for the oranges. People drink this up every time I make it! It is delicious and simple to make.

It was very light and refreshing!! I will be making it from now on, it was that good!! Karen Rossville, GA

Served this at my son's graduation party. It went quickly and I got a lot of positive remarks about it such as: "it's so refreshing!" and "perfect for a hot day!" and "can  you e-mail the recipe to me?". If you try this recipe and have more than 10 people I suggest a double batch. I was serving 36 folks and despite having many other drink choices this went first!

Very light and refreshing. I made it the second time a little different left out the sugar and used crystal light lemonade and used a used diet club soda. It had the same light refreshing taste. Great punch for summer get togethers.

Prepared as listed except for omitting the sugar completely, it really didn't taste like it needed it. Served this at a recent Christmas party with family, everyone liked it and the teens in the group devoured it. As other reviewers suggested I made a double batch which was perfect, none leftover and my party only had 13 people. I will definitely make this again.

Have made this punch several times and everyone loves it. I use sparkling white grape juice instead of the cider because my family loves the grape. I also double the sugar. I usually end up doubling or tripling the recipe as it goes so fast.

This was such an easy punch to make and it tasted great. I made this for my sister's Baby Shower and everyone asked for the recipe! :)

I'm really not sure about this one. I thought it had an odd taste. I made 60 servings for 25 people and there was a little left (not a lot). Most people at the baby shower went back for seconds or more and several people commented on how much they liked it but I didn't like it a lot. I don't think I'd make this again but I do like the alternative to a heavy fruity or sherberty punch. I used rasberry lemonade (minute maid) to make it pink so I "might" try it again with regular lemonade.

I made this for a baby shower. It was a huge hit and so easy to make. I did a double recipe for a group of 25.   Thanks for a great non-alcoholic punch!

After reading the reviews for this punch, I decided to try it for my dinner party last week.  The punch turned out great!! (the only thing I did differently was add more sugar).  Even though apple cider is used, the punch tastes like a marriage of ice tea and lemonade-very good.  I had about 15 people over so I made punch for 40 servings and it wasn't enough!  If you try this recipes, I would definitely double (maybe even triple) the servings!  Kudos to Mathilda!!

Wonderful hit - wouldn't change any of the ingredients except maybe use smaller oranges for appeal. We doubled the receipe except for the fruit - beautiful presentation!

This was a fantastic punch!  I was sorry I didn't get more of the ingredients - my guests liked it so much, they drained the punch bowl and wanted more!

Highly recommended!
