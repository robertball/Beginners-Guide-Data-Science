I really liked this recipe.  You just need to add the veg. soup mix to some milk before you cook it.  I also cooked some chicken (Cubed), spinach, red and yellow peppers and then added it to the sauce.  It was awsome and even my picky husband liked it!!

This was good!! I did mix the milk and the soup mix together, then heated them in the microwave for 2 minutes, before I started the pasta, just to make sure the veggies were tender. Then I replaced the parmesean with 1/2 cup pepper jack cheese. Not a huge taste difference, just added a kick. Thank you!

I did't care for the flavor and the vegetables from the mix were tough.

If you follow the instructions exactly as written it comes out great!  I'm not a fan of parmesan cheese, but you can always substitute something like romano.  Add some precooked chicken to it and you have a complete meal that takes no time at all.

Very good!  I made this during lunch today.  I took the advice of several reviewers - mixed and microwaved the milk/veggies.  Then I made a roux with the butter/flour to put it in once warmed.  I added a bag of mixed steamed veggies right after blending in the cheese.  Didn't notice at the store that I picked up pepper-spiced veggies, but it still tasted great!  I was amazed at how creamy it was.

Super easy and you can add anything to it to make it a meal, precooked vegetables of your choice, chunked chicken, turkey, etc.

Pretty good with some additions of veggies, garlic and pepper.  I also used half n half instead of milk.  Probably will make again.

I'm rating this a four because it was so easy to make but I didn't much care for the flavor of the vegtable soup mix.  I might make this again if I'm in a pinch like I was tonight.

Yummy and a good way to get the kids to eat their vegetables. The flavor reminds me of Andy Capp's Cheddar Fries. haha Mix in extra corn, peas, shredded carrots, brocolli, whatever to make it more filling and nutritious. Very good!

This is a very good and simple recipe.  I also mixed the soup mix and milk together and microwaved it for 2 minutes.  I did not use as much pasta as it called for.  It would be great if you added more veggies and/or chicken.

Great recipe! I combined the millk and soup mix as suggested by other reviews first and microwaved for two minutes. I substituted the margarine for butter as well.  I also cut up and cooked some chicken breast with some EVOO, barlic and italian seasonings and added it as well as some broccoli and carrots. WIll make again :-)

yummy! I added cubed cooked chicken breast this recipe.  A little dry though, next time I will increase flour to 2 tsp and milk to 2 cups.  Great flavor enjoyed by the whole family.

Nice and quick added broccoli will try another soup mix since this one was a bit too salty. Good for my vegetarian daughter.

So good. Tastes like the packet stuff but even better. I made it as a side with my garlic parmesan chicken and it was awesome. Next time I will double the recipe and add chicken to it or just serve it as a main dish with a side salad and garlic bread.

Easy and yummy.  Making it for the BF's parents made me feel like a professional.  I used cream instead of milk.  I used vegetable bullion instead of soup mix.  I also threw in some frozen peas and corn (after all, it wouldn't be primavera without the veggies!).  It was rich and filled everyone up.  Thanks rulu930!

This recipe was easy and delicious! I too put the soup/milk in the microwave to help the vegies cook more. I also added chicken I baked in the oven with parmesan cheese. I used an entire package of angel hair pasta, but it may have been too much because there didn't seem to be enough sauce. Even so, this was YUMMY!

I don't think it was bad at all...I iddn't have veg soup mix but onion mix so I used a 1/4 of the pack and added 2 tablespoons of a vegtable dried mixed for seasoning and added garlic. I then added carrots and spinach and it was good.

Simple and tasty. I accidentally used way more flour than suggested, but it turned out great. Easy to customize with your own vegetables (diced roma tomatos, thinly sliced mushrooms or zucchini). I served with cheese tortellini. Tastes very similar to a "Lipton Noodles and Sauce" side dish.

This Pasta Primavera tasted great!  My kids even loved it!  The veggie soup gave it a really good taste, but I wish the vegetables were fresher tasting and heartier.  But, all-in-all, this is a very good, fast recipe for a busy weeknight.

So easy and delicious!

Update: Still easy and delicious, but a bit too much salty the last time I made it. This time I used unsalted butter and it was much better.

This was ok.  It did really have a 'packaged' taste even after adding extra parmesan and a little cream cheese. The kids ate it and it was quick but not sure if I'd make it again. But glad I tried it.

I followed the recipe as is and it came out great.  I did mix the milk and soup mix in microwave for 2mins as suggested previously. I also microwaved a bag of steamed mixed vegetables and threw that in at the end too. My family absolutely loved it!

I am always looking for recipes where I can add veggies into my families diet. I keep bags of frozen vegetables in the freezer and just toss them in. This recipes was perfect for that. I followed the reccomendations of others and mix the milk and soup mix in the micro, I also added chicken. Next time I will do shrimp. I added carrots and peas. Thank you for submitting this one, we love it!

This was ok.  I also followed the recommendations of other reviewers and nuked the milk and mix ahead of time.  I also added some sauteed peppers and garlic.  The flavor still felt a little "packaged" if you know what I mean.  Overall, ok and convenient for a night in which I did not feel like running out to the store to get ingredients.

Great recipie! I did as others suggested and microwaved the milk and soup mix for 2 minutes first. I added chicken and frozen veggies to the recipe as well for a full meal and doubled the amount of cheese. Only problem was that there wasn't much sauce when adding extras.

I love this recipe! It's so easy and as long as I remember to pick up some Knorr's vegetable soup mix, I always have the ingredients! I like to add a lot of peas and my boyfriend likes grilled chicken. I think some asparagus or broccoli might also be good. Thanks for a great recipe! I make it all the time!!

I really liked this! Made as directed. Definitely will double the sauce next time. 

***UPDATE**** made this again, kept it at one envelope of soup mix and doubled the parmesan, milk, flour and margarine. This was perfect.

I found that the measurements were not that great. There was hardly enough of the soup mixture to cover the pasta.

Great recipe.. however you definitely need to double the sauce amount if you plan on having a "saucy" noodle and not just a dab of sauce. My picky husband loved it.

Wonderful pasta variety!  Easy and yummy.  We used 16 oz of pasta and so I added 2 1/2 tsp margarine and some extra milk, an extra 1/2 tsp flour, garlic powder, parsely, and onion salt to make it go further.  
Will add it to our rotation!

This is a great base on which to build! I took the other reviews suggestions & added vegetables to the recipe. I would highly recommend others doing the same. Broccoli would be a great vegetable to add to this dish & one I will most certainly be sure to add next time. Also, I added a little sour cream to the soup mix roux before adding the pasta. This is very easy to make in a pinch, using ingredients in your pantry.

I increased the sauce quantities, added frozen peas, and nuked the milk and mix for 4 mins to help soften the veggies per suggestions. I also added some leftover roast pheasant to make it a meal. Not bad for an easy weeknight meal but needs the changes suggested by the reviewers.

I made this for dinner tonight for me, my husband and my two boys aged 11 and 13.  Thankfully I had a salad, veggies and garlic bread because I'm not sure if it would have been enough for all of us without the sides, but then again growing boys eat so much!!

I did as previously mentioned, cooked soup and milk separately, mixed the flour/butter into a roux.  I also added cooked cubed chicken.

All in all very tasty, and super simple and fast to make.  Would make it again for sure! but if you have a big family or big eaters, it might not be enough.

This was really good.  Only changes I made were that I threw some shrimp and frozen peas, carrots, broccoli, and green beans into the sauce.  Served over muli-color rotini.

I was looking for a recipe for pasta to use as a side dish and came across this one. I didn't exactly know what was used as the vegetable soup and all I had was a package of Lipton Tomato Vegetable soup so I thought I would give it a try. I also had a bit of orange pepper and purple onion I wanted to use up so I sautéed them a bit and added them to the sauce at the end. This was really good and easy to prepare. Everyone in the house liked it and it will go into my keeper file. Thanks for the recipe.

Very yummy. The kids loved it even though it had veggies in it! To soften the dried veggies in the soup after you are done with everything leave a lid on the pan to let the veges steam so they get a little softer. While that was going on I cooked the chicken sausages that look like bratwurst. It turned out to be a wonderful meal with no complaining!

This was very tasty.  I also added chopped carrot, onion, mushrooms and frozen peas.  Cooked veggies in butter before adding flour.  Added peas during final 2 minutes of boiling pasta.  I think I used asiago.  Will definitely make again.  Might try roasting veggies first, next time...

One of our favorite quick recipes that our kids love. I add about 2 cups frozen pea and carrot mix and it is even better! Can easily change it up by adding broccoli too.

This was delicious!  I used a package of the Knorr's mix which is what I always use to make spinach dip.  The flavor was just what I like.  I also browned a couple of links of tofu sausage with some mushrooms and added them to the pasta.  Wonderful complete meal.  I think next time I might add some broccoli or spinach.  This is a keeper.

Excellent last-minute dish.  Heated milk/soup mixture as recommended.  Added cubed chicken and steamed broccoli for heartiness.  I also added bacon pieces as it simmered, which made it GREAT!  Good dish to use up some pasta and frozen veggies.  Thanks!

This was delicious, and really simple. I added some colby-jack cheese to the sauce, and used less butter, other than that followed the recipe. My husband and I both loved it. Will be making it again, for sure. Thanks!

tasty, but not enough veggies to serve as a meal. I did as others did and microwaved the soup pack and milk first. I also added minced garlic.

This came out excellent, though the vegetable soup mix provided some rubbery veggies. It was still good enough I'd happily eat it again just the same, but next time I'll use fresh ones and chicken.

This was alright. I had mixed the soup with the milk beforehand for about 10 minutes and it still came out somewhat rough. The taste was pretty good. Not my favorite thing overall, but not the worst thing I have made!

I made this with Garlic & Herb Soup or Dip Mix instead of the vegetable soup mix. My hubby's response to his first bite? "This stuff is good!"

I give this recipe only one star, but I'm not sure it deserves even that one! Pasta Primavera is about fresh spring vegetables. If you have time to boil up some dried pasta, you have time to prep some real spring vegetables. Asparagus, bell pepper, peas, onions, leeks, zucchini, tomatoes, and green beans are all appropriate, but  "dry vegetable soup mix" is not a substitute. Skip the soup mix, include vegetables of your choice, and add a couple of tablespoons of sour cream, and this is about a million times tastier!

This was an easy and fast meal. I added chicken broth and Romano cheese because I made 12oz of pasta. I also added frozen vegetables.  Family loved it

im a pasta fanatic, i loved this recipe! i used Knorr vegetable mix, which was great. the only thing i might do different is presoak the veg mix in the milk so it softens up more.

This is good, although not great, recipe. I've made it a couple times, adding frozen veggies to it to make it more filling and hearty.

I love this recipe, I always double everything, add more grated cheese (usually swiss and monterey) and add in some extra steamed veggies... super delicious as original recipe or with these additions. & sometimes I'll bake it in the oven at 350 for about twenty minutes to make everything creamy, melting and just a little bit of a crust on top. Also great with cooked shrimp tossed in!

Was good! I added cooked veggies (broccoli, carrots, yellow squash), garlic and salt. Put all on fettuccine. Will use the leftover vegetable primavera on rice. Thank you for the recipe.

Sauce was wonderfully flavorful. Added sautéed chicken with red and yellow peppers and green onions. Took the advice of others and mixed vegetable mix and milk to start hydrating veggies and it worked like a charm. Overall awesome recipe!

I'm not that much of a cook, so when I saw how easy this was to make, I decided to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised! The sauce is so creamy and flavorful! I did what other reviewers suggested - I mixed the soup mix and milk together and heated in the microwave for 2 minutes before adding to the skillet, and the veggies were nice and soft. Will definitely make again!

I use evaporated milk & have mixed in left over chicken, smoked sausage, grilled shrimp, & my favorite, salmon.  Sometimes I throw in whatever leftover vegetables I have.  I love the parmesan cheese, but often just use whatever small bits of various cheese that need to be used up. This is a great way to jazz up leftovers with very little work. Thank you!

This dish is absolutely delicious as is but I like it better with tri-color pasta and sometimes add veggies.  I followed the advice of other reviews and microwaved the milk and soup.
