I am the food service manager for a local school district and make these for sale on the ala carte line.  They sell completely out every day and the kids all love them!

This is great for a quick lunch! I made one for me and one for my husband to take to work. I used smoked turkey and added swiss cheese.  I left the ranch dressing on the side and used it to dip the sanwich in - this way the wrap wouldn't get soggy.

I don't to much for wraps but this was FANTASTIC.  I brought the ingredients to work and everyone made their own.  We used sliced turkey, tomato basil tortillas, salsa, sour cream, shredded lettuce and mexican flavor shredded cheese.  What a great wrap idea!!

Good simple wrap for school lunches. My daughter has gotten sick of sandwiches over the years, and this simple wrap with all the same ingredients you put on your sammie is nice, light and easy to prepare. I also make this using the packet of ranch dressing mixed with sour cream and cream cheese spread on the tortilla instead of the wet ranch dressing and she likes that even better.

This is one of my favorite lunches. I love almost anything with ranch in it. Especially great with different kinds of turkey: smoked turkey, Cajun turkey, honey turkey. Use shredded lettuce for easier rolling.

I love these ranch wraps. Something I add is a layer of flavored cream cheese spread, Garden Vegetable, is really good!

I'm not going to be like one of those people who change the ingredients and then give the food a lower score. You'd be surprised what one ingredient could do to the taste! This was alright, I prefer a good ol' fashioned turkey /swiss / tomato sandwich to it though. My little guy loved it, so 5 stars from him!

I thought these were pretty good. The only changes I made were that I did not use lettuce, because I didnt have any and I added some onion. A nice easy, healthy lunch and I didnt think they were too boring ;)

These are great. I used fresh wild turkey, fried, that my DH was lucky enough to get during this Spring hunting season. I added red onion and bacon. Used grated white cheddar cheese. Omitted the green pepper strips. Very versatile recipe and an awesome lunch.

These were just great!! We all really liked them, they're quick and easy too, always a hit with me! I followed recipe exactly although it's one that can easily be modified to different tastes but we happen to really like all the ingredients listed so I tried it the first time as written. I might like to try feta on mine next time, DH thinks bacon would go good on these. We'll have them again :)

Very tasty!  I made some with Ranch dressing and some with mustard/mayo.  Loved them both!  Also used spinach to make them a little healthier.

This was a great wrap, I did leave the green pepper out though, just out of pers. pref. Thanks great way to use up turkey lunch meat.

Pretty good and very fast and easy. I used mesquite smoked deli turkey and a slice of swiss cheese. They were too hard to roll up with all the fillings and wouldn't stay together, so I just made them with meat and cheese and dressing.

Average recipe, first reviewer had it right. Boring. I would definately use ground pepper the next time. Okay lunch recipe. Fairly healthy with fresh ingredients.

A good use of leftover tortillas, but a bit boring.  Can be quite healthy if you use whole wheat tortillas and low-fat ranch, though!

Made 1 serving for my 5 year old daughter's lunch. She ate most of it so I guess she thought they tasted pretty good.

Pack the ingredients separately to avoid having a soggy wrap at lunch time. I added a few slices of cucumber and whole wheet tortilla instead of the flour tortillas.

These are great.  We had them while on a camping trip.  We added bacon that we had cooked earlier, delicious.  I loved the ranch dressing in it.

Yum! A nice change for lunch. This is a great, versatile recipe. I also like to make rolls with guacamole, spinach leaves, cheddar cheese, and turkey or ham. Thanks for the keeper!

This dish is easy to prepare and I had all of the ingredients on hand! I had unexpected company and left over turkey and we had a great and easy meal! I used red pepper instead of green- even the kids ate it up!

Use this as your base recipe and add any ingredients your family likes.  You can't beat a good ole sandwich wrap.
