This recipe  is a favorite for my family. They enjoy it more than rhubarb pie.  I am giving it a 5 rating but I use much less sugar as my family likes it more tart. I only use 3/4 cup for a recipe doubled and about six cups of rhubarb.

Even with rhubarb being tart this had a bit too much sugar for us.  I loved the crust and the crispy edges but the middle was a little mushy and very sweet.  Great idea though and with a bit less sugar I bet would be great.

This seemed a bit boring.  Shortbread and rhubarb in custard.  Blah - and it seemed too sweet.  I'm old enough I'm not going to waste my time to make boring.  So I changed it

Base - the same except I added 2 tablespoons of candied ginger,  medium chop.  I wanted there to be ginger in the base but not uniform - I wanted there to be real surprises.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla extract

The top - I used 1/2 c of low fat sweetened condensed milk and no other sugar.  1 egg, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 c of flour and 3 c of rhubarb.  lastly I added 2/3 c of sliced almonds as I thought the texture was likely to be to uniform.  Baked for about the same amount of time at same temp - until the almond slices were just starting to brown.

Fantastic

So good!! Super easy, too! The crust is perfect, the rhubarb slightly tart, yet sweet. The only change I made was to use 3 cups of rhubarb. Bake time was spot on, the rhubarb cooked perfectly!   :)

A very good rhubarb recipe with a very good crust, that really taste like a shortbread.  I knew before starting the recipe that I would be cutting back on the amount of sugar.  We love the tartness of rhubarb and I knew with 1 1/2 total cups of sugar it would be very sweet.  I baked the crust in a 9" pie pan rather than a square pan.  I also only used 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. white sugar and upped the rhubarb to 3 cups.  We really liked the recipe, as did my dad and the neighbor man.

Yes I made changes  - 3/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white sugar in the rhubarb mixture; cornstarch instead of flour. Yes, I will make it again and again and again. 4 times already! If you make a larger pan only increase the base by 1 1/2 times not double.

So, the shortbread needs a touch of vanilla, and a little nutmeg. I added 1 tsp vanilla to the rhubarb. Also, only used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown. I still think the sugar should be cut down. Maybe next time 2/3 brown. Would be really tasty with vanilla ice cream.

I used 3/4 cup of brown sugar, and just over 1/4 cup of white sugar and it was great. Not mega sweet, and still let some of the tart rhubarb come through. Use your hands to mix the crust mixture. The heat from your hands makes the butter creamy and helps make a dough. I also cooked mine about 45 minutes to help the middle set up better.

Really good way to use fresh rhubarb.  I added a bit of cinnamon & cloves to the rhubarb mixture as we like that flavor with the rhubarb.  Very good.  Did line my pan with parchment paper for easier removal.

Upon taking out of oven, it looked beautiful.  As it cooled, however, cracks developed in the custard layer which filled with rivers of brown sugar liquid.  It became messy and impossible to serve in bar form.  The bar itself was way too sweet.

This recipe is very similar to one that I have used over the years from a cookbook and its great. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and it is the right combo of sweet and tart.  I also add a touch of vanilla and almond extract to the rhubarb custard topping for extra flavour.  Its a great way to use up the rhubarb growing in my garden.

Tasty!!!
Struggling to get it out of the pan - use parchment paper?
Definitely reduce the sugar - I used 3/4 c brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar; perfect.

(Donna K.) I changed the recipe after reading all the comments.
I doubled the recipe so I added 2 tsp. vanilla to the shortbread crust although only increased 1 & 1/2 times for the crust in a 9" X 13" baking pan, but everything except the sugar was doubled and I used 6 cups of rhubarb. I reduced the sugar in the recipe by 2/3. So instead of 3 cups of combined brown & white sugar, I used 1 cup brown sugar in the doubled recipe. I thought it was a little sour so sifted some icing sugar over the baked bars. I got 2 thumbs up from my parents who don't like overly sweet desserts.

We loved these bars. My husband described them as fluffy on top and then a delicious shortbread on the bottom. I cut back on the sugar....about a 1/2 of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar and also upped the rhubarb to probably 3.5 cups. I also used 3/4 all-purpose flour and 1/4 cup whole wheat flour.

Thought it would be to much sugar so I just used the brown sugar plus one extra cup of rhubarb.  It set up nice and tastes really good.

I added an extra cup of rhubarb and a little less sugar. I also used parchment paper as shown in the video which made it really easy to get out of the pan. Super yummy!

This was great! I used 1/2 cup brown sugar, no white sugar, and 3 cups rhubarb. Next time I'll cut the brown sugar down to 1/3 cup. As written it would be way too sweet! A very good recipe if you drastically reduce the sugar.

I made this last night and it turned out well, but I did use less sugar than called for. I used 1 cup organic unrefined sugar in replacement of the brown sugar, and left out the additional white sugar. It was still very sweet.

I should have listened to the reviews and either cut back on the sugar and/or added more rhubarb.  With those changes, this would be excellent!

The  only reason I gave this recipe 3 stars has nothing to do with the actual recipe.  It was my own fault it didn't turn out well. I used frozen rhubarb & I didn't drain it enough.  So, it came out mushy. Very mushy. The crust was delicious & the flavor was as well. So, lesson learned! I am anxious to try it again soon!

Just the right amount of sweet & tart.  Loved these bars and simple to make.  Next time I will use all white sugar instead of brown & white.  Also, could double the crust.

Just didn't work for us.  The idea of just rhubarb was appealing but it honestly didn't taste a whole lot like rhubarb.  I gave it to the neighbor because we always share new recipes.  Her husband liked it so he finished it up.

These were excellent. Very tasty. I doubled the recipe so had to cook it longer.
