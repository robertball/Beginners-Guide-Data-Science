This will only be appreciated by fans of a very tart fruit pie. Spectacular cranberry flavor, and sour enough to make you squeal, even with the large amount of sugar. It could have used even more. Even my husband, who adores rhubarb pies and cherry pies because of their tartness had a tough time eating this one. I used orange juice in place of water, and in retrospect, probably should have used it in place of the lemon juice as well. This pie needs no further acid beyond what the cranberries already bring to the table. I increased the butter to 2 tablespoons, as I fail to see how a mere 2 teaspoons could live up to the title of a "buttery" pie (and 2 Tb is not a lot for a 9" pie.) Added 1 tsp grated orange peel and 1/4 tsp mace, which goes perfectly with the flavor of cranberries. The color is a deep crimson, a perfect centerpiece for your holiday table. Just know that the sourness of this pie is so intense that it might not appeal to all.

This recipe was great. everybody loved it. the only differences that i had when i made it was that i used orange juice instead of lemon juice, and i added extra sugar instead of salt. i think that this recipe was great.

Very good pie for cranberry lovers. As it has already been said, it is quite sourbitter, and some people may not enjoy it for that reason. Watch out, for the cranberry filling bubbles and rises a little bit when cooking, so make sure to place your pie plate on a cookie sheet!!!

I liked this recipe because it's simple and because it calls for cooking the craberries on the stove top.  This makes for shorter oven time and lessens the chance of over cooking the pie crust which sometimes happens.  
I also added about 2-3 cups of cut apples to the filling after the cranberries cooked and some cinnamon and it turned out fabulous!  If you have a deep pie dish I recommend adding something as the recipe amount is not enough to properly fill a deep dish.  
Great find!

This was an absolute hit on Thanksgiving.  My family was a bit hesitant to try it but RAVED after one bite.  This will defentily be a holiday tradition.  I cut down some time on this recipe by using a Pillsbury crust and making a crumb topping.  Delicious!

I have been making this pie for a VERY long time.  You can use 1/2 the sugar by doing 1/2 splenda if it makes you feel better!?!?!  My guys LOVE this pie with a dollop of Edy's Swiss Orange ice cream-sherbet with flecks of dark chocolate!! It is so popular with my friends and family that I am only invited anywhere between Nov-Jan if I bring at least one!

I found this pie to be a bit tart for my liking.  Not sure if cutting down on the lemon juice would help or not?  I will make this again with less lemon juice before I decide if this is a keeper or not.  Maybe ice cream would help!  YUM

Very Good -- Very Tart!  Do not drink milk after eating this pie, it turns sour in your mouth.  But I loved the flavor of the pie.  It was different and a nice treat.  I used frozen cranberries (thawed) and it turned out nicely.  I also don't like crust so instead of a top crust I made a crumble topping.

This was a very good pie and a great use of the extra cranberries I had left over from Thanksgiving.  I was a little nervous after reading the reviews that it might be to tart and so I did do a couple of things.  I used a little less cranberries (about half of what it called for) and then replaced the remainder with Raspberries.  I also left out the lemon juice but would leave it in next time.  The pie turned out good.  I would make it again.  The only other thing I would change is I would add some instant tapioca to the filling.  It was a bit runny, even though it was tasty.  One other detail... I used a deep dish pie crust.  Wanted to be safe.  Glad I did because it needed it.

This was wayy too tart and I love tart and sour desserts. The lemon juice was too much, I felt like that was all I could taste.  I think using orange juice would be much better

I made this pie for Thanksgiving. It was a total hit. Everyone absolutely loved it. The only thing I did different was add a few drops of red food coloring. It brightened up the color. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It will become a favorite in my house.

We liked it, but it was tart.  Tart tart tart.  I can eat an whole lemon, but this pie was a bit of a challenge.  Still tasty, though, especially with vanilla ice cream on top!  When I make it again it will be without the lemon juice.

Very good.  I used filling as a cobbler instead of a pie.  I made 2 cobblers (doubled the filling recipe).  One was as recipe indicates and other I added sliced apples (2 apples).  Family and friends enjoyed both.  I will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe. A friend of mine wanted a strawberry rhubarb pie, but rhubarb is out of season so I decided to try this as a sour substitution. I doubled the recipe, but kept the cranberries  the same and added a pound of halved strawberries. So good! My berries did need a little more sugar to be edible though. Can't wait to make this for Thanksgiving and I am NOT a pie fan. Everyone loved it and the  birthday boy was excited to take home the leftovers. Thanks for such yummy recipe!

This is an excellent pie for those who like cranberries! I suggest half the amount of lemon juice (1/8 of a cup) and double the amount of cranberries (2 (12 oz each) fresh cranberries. The reason for it is the size of the pie. 1 bag of cranberries is nearly not enough for a 9 inch pie. I used 2 bags and half the amount of lemon because I saw that 1 bag is too little and too much lemon juice would make the pie too tart. Good luck!!!

I didn't try any of this since I made it for a pie tasting function; however, my neighbor tried it and said it was really good.  I used 2 tblspoons of butter and 2 cups of sugar.  I also used frozen cranberries and I'm not sure if that's why they stuck together immediately after I put them in the sugar mixture or if I just over cooked the mixture and that was the problem.  Either way, although it took me a few minutes to break them up, eventually the cranberries popped and broke apart.  My neighbor told me it wasn't too sour and she said the pie was great.  Thanks for the recipe--I'll make it again for just us.

It was good however, every subsequent bite I felt as if I was tasting more and more lemon juice. I think I'll cut the juice down and try it that way. Everyone gobbled it up however.

Very good but don't make the mistake I made. Usually I will cut the sugar in any pie recipe because I like my pies tart, so I cut from 1 1/2 cups (seemed like a lot to me) to 1 cup of sugar. It was almost too tart for me! Next time I will use the recommended amount!

Excellent!  I hadn't used fresh cranberries before but now that I know how easy it is (and delicious!) I will use them whenever available.  Thank you for such a good recipe- highly recommended.

I was looking for a cranberry pie recipe that was not too sweet and this one fit hte bill. I did not have lemon juice so I did orange juice mixed with some lime juice. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and it was perfect! A bit tart but great. I also omited the salt. It did bubble over like crazy so next time I will put it in a deep dish pie pan. You have got to try this pie!

Wow!! This is so very good. I did modify it slightly per other reviewers suggestions. 
I like tart foods, like Rhubarb, Cranberry, and lemon. But, I did agree with the reviewer that felt that the lemon juice in a Cranberry Pie might be to much. Did not use it at all. Also, did not add any salt, I couldn't see why I should add it. It didn't seem necessary.  I subbed additional water in place of the lemon juice and I subbed some extra sugar for the salt. 
I also added some Fuji apples.  That also helps to cut down on the tartness of the berries. 
My topping was a crumb one was from this site. It was wonderful. 
My husband is the opposite of me, where I love tart foods, he doesn't.  He likes this pie. 
I also added a pinch of orange zest, but didn't have any mace(will next time).  
For the crumb topping, you might want to check it at 30 min., mine went the full 40 and came out almost burnt. 
Delicious!!

This was probably the most fantastic pie I've ever made! (...not that I've been making them for very long.)
I sprinkled cinnamon-sugar over the top after I covered with egg wash.  I didn't do a lattice top, either, so I didn't have to worry about spills.  Still, this is a very juicy pie, so I suggest a shortening crust and NOT a butter crust.  Either way, let the filling cool off before putting them inside so as to not melt the butter/shortening.
I was nervous because cranberries are SO bitter, but this pie was great!  Yum yum yum.

I added some dashes of Chinese 5 spice powder to the recipe. Delicious if you like tart foods.

I didn't have any lemon juice, but I did have a box of orange jello.  I mixed this in, and what a wonderful flavor. Can't wait to make again!

Great recipe. It is on the tart side. Next time I plan to add more sugar as suggested by others to lessen the tartness.

I doubled the filling for a deep dish pie and cut back on the lemon juice.   Delicious!

Will make again. It was a nice change to the usual holiday pies. I may decrease the sugar some the next time and play around with adding another fruit, I'm thinking a cup of blue berries.

I loved this pie! Like another reviewer I also used about 4 apples in a medium dice because I had some and thought it might add some sweetness. Good call! The flavor was wonderful plus, the filling wouldn't have filled my pie crust without the apples. I used refrigerated pie crust. I will definitely make this again.

After reading everyone's reviews saying it was too bitter, I increased the sugar to 2 cups and substituted orange juice for lemon juice, but I kept the salt. I thought it was perfect! Very yummy! My first pie ever so I wasn't too great at the lattice top.

I made the recipe and it was quite good. I substituted orange juice for the lemon juice, however. As to the temperature, my oven is calibrated correctly and my pies were seriously overdone (the pastry) at 28 min. The pastry came out rather tough and "toasted" tasting rather than flaky as it usually does.

Too soupy. Nice flavor contrast though. I added more cornstarch and try as I might it just didn't work out.
