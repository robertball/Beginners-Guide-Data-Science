Followed recipe to the "T" and it came out like rubber. Not really good to eat. BUT, I have discovered that when spread thin on wax paper, makes FANTASTIC latex-like effects for Halloween costumes. I actually use this recipe to make scars and zombie bites, then attach them with makeup glue. To be able to paint them, all you have to do is coat them with a thin layer of special FX wax.

More of a rubbery than gummy texture; flavor isn't very potent (I used raspberry).

I made them on a cookie sheet, so they were like gummy worms.

Overall, a fun try.  I don't think my gummy addiction will be satiated by these, though.

Being the only gummy option on this site makes this worth the try. I used regular strawberry jello (not sugar free) which may have made it a bit stickier than if the directions were followed. If you take this route, avoid using glass as it will glue itself to the plate.  I let it set in a 9 by 9 Tupperware then cut it into strips. Be sure to have a SUPER sharp knife for this process. Normal steak knives will only make you frustrated, which also makes me think cookie cutters won't work either. The family votes that the thinner strips were the best, the thick ones did come off as rubbery. It was easier to work with while cold also, if you have a big batch, only take out what you are working with or it becomes difficult. The taste was perfect and the thin strips were as enjoyable as any store bought candy (if not more so!).  FYI, this recipe does not have chemicals like store bought candies, it will need to be kept in the fridge or eaten in short order. If you do it right it wont be around long anyhow!

It was okay.  It turned out beautiful, came out fairly easily, and was quick.  We made two trips to the store late at night to make these, but the taste is so weird!  Too sweet or sour or something.  It seriously does look very pretty.  My friend and I used rubber flower and heart molds... maybe I will post a picture of our pretty creation.  Thanks for the recipe any way.  They are edible, and like I said they are just soooo cute.  And being the only gummy candy recipe on this site.  Make them, maybe use 1 1/2 packs of jell-o and six packs of the un- flavored stuff.  Thank you very much for posting it! 
By the way... I'm 11 and my friend is 12.

I have to agree with other reviewers they are more rubbery than gummi but, I had all the ing. and they were quick, and good. I used a spoon to fill the molds and to my surprise it was very easy and a pizza cutter to slice the sheets.

I have made these several time now and found the following changes to be very helpful. To get a better flavor add a tsp (or two) of flavoring the same as the type of jello used or one that works well with it.If you don't have candy mold small(bonbon size) paper cups work well, use a small amount in each cup enough to cover the bottom. I set mine in the freezer, then bring to room temp and you can peel them out of the cups. I also used shaped muffin cups they worked out but I think the smaller candies work best.

I poured mine in an thick mold makeing 4 to 6 at  1 1/2-2 1/2 inches thick 3 inches long +.  They came out fine.  It's the first time I used the recipe.  Trying to make them translucent next time and most certainly smaller pieces otherwise it's fine adult size

My ten year old wanted to make his own giant gummy worm and agreed to start with this which seemed a little easier. I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the reviews but these turned out better than I expected. The unflavored gelatin came in packs of four so we got one box. We wanted to try two colors and some reviews mentioned they weren't sweet enough so I did sort of a half size of this recipe: used one 4.5 serving pack of jell-o to two packs of the Knox unflavored, then 1/4 cup water. In a "bite-size" brownie pan, used a paper towel to wipe just a little canola oil around each "cup" so the gummies would be easier to get out and that worked: after cooling, slid a butter knife around the outside and then could pop them out easily. So, we did alter the recipe a bit, which made them more opaque than clear, but they turned out ok! Satisfied my son's curiosity and was fun and easy to do.

We had no problem.  Cooked it a little longer.  My 3-yr-old practically made it herself and wanted to eat it all herself too, but... :) 
We used strawberry jell-o, a glass 11x7 to set, and then cookie cutters for tiny shapes which surprisingly was the only hard part.  Neighbors loved it too!  We might make them on a stick next time.  Chewy, but everyone loved them.  Fun.
