These were amazing. We added garlic  and dropped the vinegar. It went great with chicken and sour cream and chives mashed potatoes.

Turned it really good!  Made some minor modifications: added 1/4 cup more broth (used chicken as I didn't have beef) since the sauce reduced by a lot; Omitted chocolate as I didn't have any, threw in some basil and thyme and used red instead of white wine!  This tasted fantastic!!  Will make this again!!
