I would have given this 5 stars, however, because I made some changes I did not think it was appropriate to rate the original recipe. It was delicious though and my husband loved it! 

Changes:
Substituted Cream of Mushroom for French Onion Soup
Removed dry mustard
Added sautéed onions, worcestershire,  and minced garlic

I used the extra gravy for the garlic mash potatoes and it was amazing!!

This recipe was quite a disappointment. I followed it to the letter, but I did not enjoy the finished dish. The meat was bland and in need of additional flavoring. Also, the gravy was a bit too thin for my taste. Finally, the bread should have been broken into small, not large pieces or you will bite down it and it tastes rather mushy. I will not be using this recipe again.

Quite tasty.  I only used 1 pound of meat, eggs, and crumbs and used the full amount of the other ingredients.  Turned out very well with a lot of gravy to pour over steaks and garlic mashed potatoes.

Very satisfied. Flavorful and easy. I only rated at 4 stars because I did alter it a little. I'm not a fan of the mushroom so I substituted with a can of condensed French onion soup instead. I also added a splash of Worcestershire sauce.

this is a very flavorful recipe.... although I did customize it a little because I substituted 1/2 ground beef with ground Elk meat... Everyone loved it.

I made it for the first time today. However, I tweaked the recipe a little by substituting the ground beef with ground turkey and the packet of onion soup for actual chopped onion, and it tastes AWESOME! I definitely will make this dish again!

I am the submitter of this recipe, which we love at my house. I often use Panko bread crumbs instead of Italian seasoned ones. Also, I usually bake it about an hour to reduce and thicken the sauce. If you want more sauce for the meat or for potatoes, you can easily double the sauce mixture. Kaye

The whole family enjoyed this. I didn't care for the Italian Seasoned breadcrumbs and will just try plain next time. Also, I plan to add diced fresh onions, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture going forward. Thanks for submitting!

The meat patties were delicious but I didn’t care for the sauce too much.  For some reason, mine turned out greasy tasting.... and I wiped the pan clean after browning the meat (85% lean) so it wasn’t from that.  I wouldn’t normally use a cream soup for this dish but I will definitely use the meat recipe in the future and combine that with a gravy in the future.

Love how simple this was. Not a huge fan of the mustard in the gravy. I baked for about 30 min and they were done for me but we butcher our own meat and I used 1 1/2 lb package of beef. Will throw some onion in when browning the patties next time.

Easy recipe.  I made it today again.  I use venison instead.    I use what seasoning I have on hand and add fresh mushroom to the gravy.

Very tasty and pretty darn easy too. My only suggestion would be to double the sauce/gravy. We definitely needed more.

Awesome! My new go to for this dish. I didn't have ground mustard so I had to omit that but I did chop fresh garlic and add it to the meat mixture. Also, I added fresh cremini mushrooms the last ten mins of cooking. Was awesome! Thanks a lot!

Did not have any onion soup mix so did my own seasoning.  Turned out perfect and even the leftovers were good!

Way too salty with the onion soup mix.  Next time I will make it with onion flakes minus the onion soup mix.  Had great flavor other than the salt factor.  Husband loved it.

I like this better than the other Salisbury recipes.  Cooking it slowly in the oven, the meat was tender, moist and delicious. I'll add a little Worcester sauce and red pepper flakes next time for a little more spice.

In my family's opinion this recipe was the bomb. The only changes I made was in the soup and meat. I had mushroom and garlic soup and I mixed ground pork and beef for the meat because I didn't have enough beef. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and you would have thought it was served from a 5 star restaurant.

I used regular bread crumbs and added Italian spices to it.
Came out really good. My sauce was not as dark as the picture.
