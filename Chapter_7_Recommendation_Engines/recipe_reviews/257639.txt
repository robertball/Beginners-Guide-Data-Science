I love to try unrated recipes, but I hate leaving a first review that is less than stellar.  I really wanted to like this because all the ingrediants sounded great ,but this hummus just didn't come together for us.  Firstly a "bouguet garni" is a bundle of herbs wrapped with leeks or cheesecloth and tied with string, so no idea how  you would put that in a food processor.  Secondly a  1/2 cup of vinegar?  Maybe it's a typo, but I certainly wouldn't suggest that much.  The arugula gave the dip a beautiful color, but combined with the artichokes it took over and was rather bitter.
