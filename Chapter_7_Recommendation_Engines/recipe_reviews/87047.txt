These were delicious--use white chocolate and add food coloring for a festive spin.

This was the easiest thing I have every made.  They came out so good.  Gave the recipe to 2 friends who thought they were great. Kids would love to make these also.

I've made these for several family functions with few to no leftovers. However, I melt the butterscotch chips and pb on the stove at low heat.

Hi!  Wanted to comment for the person who said when they melted their chips that they were dry and crumbly.... they were most likely cooked too long in the microwave/got too hot.  Just melt for a few seconds maybe 15 to 30 seconds at a time then stir then put back into microwave and repeat steps again just until melted and then stop or they will come "out of solution" so to speak and begin to transform into a hard crumbly mess.  :-)

I agree that the butterscotch chips were crumbly and wouldn't melt. I ended up adding a little water and then had to form into balls as they wouldn't stick together.  wouldn't make again

I don't know what I did wrong but my chips never melted they just got crumbly and dried out looking.  I will have to try again.

Made these for a party and nobody touched them.  They aren't very attractive, so perhaps people were scared of them?

These are great and different from the usual snack foods.  Extremely simple to make and everyone can't say enough about how good they are.  They disappear immediately.

I had this recipe in the past and lost it. I was so glad to find it here. Awesome is all I can say. For those having problems with crumbling, you are over heating the butterscotch chips. Since microwave oven wattage varies so much, I would suggest stirring after 30 seconds to see if they are starting to melt. And keep checking and stirring every 15 - 30 sec. if needed. Once the chips soften, usually a little bit of stirring is all it takes for the rest of the chips to melt.
