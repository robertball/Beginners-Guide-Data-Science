This was deeelicious...and I don't even like elderberry pie!  I added about 1T extra of cornstarch and made a lattice crust.  This pie had a perfect consistency, and my family just couldn't stay out of it.  Will make again!

Great pie! I love elderberries and found that the easiest way to clean/ de-stem the berries is to freeze them first. Then they practically fall off the stems. Super easy!

This was the first time I thickened the berries before baking.  What a difference.  This is what elderberry pie should look like AND taste like!!!

This is a very easy pie to make. Not so sweet that you get sick. Just a wonderful taste. I've made 5 pies already this year. I loved it!!!Once your prepare the berries, and put them in the sauce pan with the sugar and cornstarch, you will be able to see how thick your pie will be. I'm preparing more berries and freezing them for winter pie making.

This was my first elderberry pie - we picked the berries from bushes we had planted in our backyard a few years ago.  I love that this recipe has you thicken the filling before putting it in the crust because I don't like runny fruit pies.  This method lets you control the thickness better.  I used a full top instead of a lattice, and my son agrees that the pie tastes better on Day #2.  Elderberry certainly has a unique flavor - it wasn't quite as "crunchy" (from the seeds, I imagine, because we picked these over twice to remove as many stems as possible before washing) on Day #2.  I'm going to try some jam and syrup, too.  We picked about 15 lbs. of berries and the bushes look like we barely touched them!  Note to anyone from Western NY or Southern Ontario:  we bought the bushes as bare root plants from the Erie County Conservation Tree and Shrub Seedling Program that the county runs every Spring.  We bought 6 bare roots - about 12" tall at the time - and after two years the plants were VERY bushy and about 10' tall.  They cost next to nothing - it's a great program to check out as they offer LOTS of other trees and plants, too.  These elderberry bushes attract birds, butterflies, bees, etc. - this is the first year I got to the berries before the birds!  There are lots of berries to share, though!!!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the first elderberry pie I ever baked. The pies I baked were for an elderly man who is ill. He loved them. I found out that I don't care for elderberries, but this recipe was the best. I didn't have any fresh elderberries available, so I bought some dried ones and soaked them until plump. Thanks for this recipe.

Oh My-Took forever to clean the tiny tiny berries.  Cooked them and it looked fine.  I don't know what goes on in the baking process but when I was done it was crunchy-not good.  NOT a do-over

This too is my favorite fruit recipe and I am blessed to have a very abundant berry producing bush/tree.  I personally have found that using the tapioca sets up the filling a better for me so the pie isn't too runny.  Thank you for adding this recipe.

We have tons of elderberries in the area.  I have made this pie several times with a few changes/additions.  I use 3 1/2 cups of berries. Then I add 1/4 tsp salt, 2 TBS cornstarch or tapioca (works great), and 1 TBS butter.  I mix everything together, place in pie and bake at 400 degrees for 40 - 45 mins.  This is so good.  If you have a sweet tooth add more sugar.  Berries are easy to clean.  The trick is to place them in the freezer first.  Leave them in a plastic or paper sack for at least an hour or more, then cleaning is a snap.

I was pleased with the way this pie turned out.  It was crunchy as someone said which was a bit surprising since the fruit off the tree is so fragile.  This is a crunch similar to the seeds of a blackberry.  I'll make again. It was good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Sept 2015 -This was the first time I've actually made Elderberry Pie.  Fabulous! I did not add the lemon juice,however I did add 1/4 tsp cinnamon and a dab of butter to the thickened berries.  I used a full top crust.  Thank you for sharing this recipes and all the reviews.


7/27/31 -This is my 3rd time making this recipe.  Today I  made 2 pies.  I did add the lemon juice, but also added appx 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla (2 pies).
Again thank you for sharing this recipe.

Elderberries are a "lost" food since many younger generations have no clue what they are.  I make this every year with my 7 year old and she helps me pick them.  This pie is a common request when berries are ripening!

This was the first elderberry pie that I have baked. I made it for a very good friend a couple of weeks ago. He picked the elderberries from his home and He LOVED it! I made the recipe just as Esther suggested. I have the 2nd pie in the oven as I type and will definately make it again for him.

I made this pie using what I was told was Elderberries, but, were actually Mulberries.  I didn't know what I had.  Anyway, I removed all the stems by cutting with scissors , put the berry mixture with a little extra cornstarch in the pan and brought it all to a boil until thickened. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  The pie wasn't overly sweet and I liked it very much.  Even my husband who isn't much of a sweet eater liked it, too.

I have been making. Elderberry jelly since I was a young girl. Over the last couple of years, I also began making an elderberry tonic to take during the winter to ward off flu and cold. The flavor of this pie was absolutely delicious! But if I make it again, I will probably strain the berries before thickening the juice because I was not a fan of all the seeds that I crunched through as I ate the pie.

Delicious Elderberry Pie. Made one pie.  Then made another batch as Jam.  Think the Jam need a bit more cornstartch but really good.
