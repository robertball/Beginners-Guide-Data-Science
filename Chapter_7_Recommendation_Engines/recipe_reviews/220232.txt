I added extra vegetables, using kale instead of spinach, and chopped tomatoes rather than cherry tomatoes.  This is a great tasting salad.

Made this recipe exactly as written (well, I did leave out the jalapenos) for a pontoon boat get-together.  Several people asked for the recipe, and even the kids were eating it!  Plus, it's so healthy.  It's the perfect hot weather, delicious, healthy meal.  I'll be making this all summer.
