This is my recipe...though named differently by the allrecipes crew. Just so you know...I always grind the oatmeal into a 'flour' before adding, there are no 'chunks' in this bread.  Also, all recipes states this should be put into 2 loaf pans...not so. If you have used 2 cups of milk...then this should go in one large loaf pan. This big loaf really should be crusty on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.

I had no problem with this dough rising; I believe part of this is due to the fact that I used bread flour in place of all-purpose flour. The increased protein (gluten) in bread flour allows for the increased elasticity that yeast creates when rising. If you want your bread dough to rise properly, you must include added gluten- some reviewers added vital wheat gluten, which will also work. I found this bread absolutely delicious and very similar to a loaf my great-grandmother used to make. Definitely making again... and again and again!

A few have mentioned having trouble with this loaf rising - I added 1tbsp vital wheat gluten for each cup of flour in the recipe, which is something I often add because I use 100% whole wheat (no white/all-purpose) flour.  I found that the loaf rose VERY well for me.  I should also note that I added 1 cup of oats, ground up, rather than 1/2 because the oats just smelled so good I couldn't help myself :P  ...No other changes.  This turned out -AMAZING-.  I love oats...

My Danish grandmother made a similar bread with whole wheat, white flour, and barley flour, so this recipe appealed to me.  This bread came out very nice, I did make a change to the recipe, I added cooked pearled barley to the dough to make little "barley berries" in the bread.   I left the rolled oats whole, not "blendered" into flour, but I liked these interesting textures in the bread.  I made two loaves using 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" glass pans.  This bread had great texture, stayed soft and moist for the few days it took to eat it, and held together beautifully when sliced for toasting.  It did not rise very high when shaped into loaves, which surprised me because it rose very high initially, but good enough.  It was heavenly sliced warm from the oven with butter and honey.  Be sure to knead this dough very well initially to develop the smooth even texture in the final loaf. I did also melt a little butter over the tops of the loaves when first out of the oven to keep them soft. This was delicious!  Some in my house  who generally only prefer white breads, loved this hot from the oven, and toasted for breakfast.    Enjoy!

This was AMAZING! I didn't want to make a large amount of bread since there are only two people in my household, so I halved the recipe. I don't have a candy or insta-read thermometer, so I actually used a regular digital read thermometer to make sure the milk was at the right temperature! I didn't add the wheat gluten (as many other people recommended), but I made sure to knead the dough for the whole 8 minutes to break up the gluten already in the wheat flour. For this reason, I had NO problems with it rising properly.

I ended up making two sub-sized rolls with half of this recipe. It is VERY light and fluffy without being sticky, much like what you'd buy in the supermarket! This recipe is a great starting one - you could easily change the type of flour and/or add in other ingredients like sunflower seeds, crushed nuts, fruits, herbs, or anything you like!

Definitely a keeper!

If you're looking for a nice, rising bread, this is not it.  I tried it twice with the same results--no rise.  Tastes okay, but not what I was looking for.

I tried this bread and love it. It is dense but with 2 1/2 cups wheat flour and oatmeal that is to be expected. My loaves are in a zip lock bag, they are moist and delicious.  It is a keeper.

I made this bread because it was simple and needed very little yeast. It is the third whole wheat recipe I have tried and it is absolutely incredible! I just tasted a piece fresh from the oven and I was very impressed!

Best whole wheat bread. I have been baking breads for over thirty years and the texture and ease in preparation gave it five stars. I used water instead of milk and only whole wheat flour and it baked up perfect!

This bread was soft and delicious! This is one of the best breads I have tasted. Even my husband, who isn't so fond of whole wheat, enjoys it. This is definately my go to recipe for whole wheat bread!

This is definitely a dense bread, very moist inside. The texture is chewy but the flavor is very good. It rose beautifully outside of the oven but definitely didn't rise further in the oven, unlike some other bread I have made. I used quick oats but substituted some with steel-cut oats and ground the mixture first. Overall I liked the break and will make again if the family likes it too.

Wonderful! Thank you for the recipe! My family likes our bread fresh so I simply halved the recipe and make one loaf. The only substitution I made was with the milk. I used half water and half buttermilk. The acid in the buttermilk helps the bread rise and makes it soft and fluffy. I also heated the milk mixture to 110-always do. Don't know if it makes a difference or not. Tonight I made it again (Last night's loaf is long gone) and just put the ingredients in my bread maker. I removed it from the machine when it had 15 minutes left on the bake cycle-perfect loaf again - in every way!

I followed the advice of Faiora and doubled the oats (ground into powder with a coffee grinder) and added 1 Tbsp wheat gluten per cup of flour.  I must have had bad yeast because I couldn't get it to rise.  I ended up making tortillas and loved them.  I'm trying again with rapid rise yeast.

I had not made yeast bread in many years, so was delighted when this actually rose!  Good taste and texture; good for toast.

wow!  i am the worst when it comes to making homemade bread.  While it took me  a few times to get the milk and yeast right and the dough didn't rise as fast as the recipe says, the bread had a wonderful flavor and came out moist.  the one and only thing i did different is to use my kitchenaid mixer to knead the dough (i cut the kneading time in half for it).  thanks for the recipe!!

great idea to add 1 Tbl of vital wheat germ to each cup of flour to have it rise better, like bread machines.  It worked!

Followed this recipe with little variation: used all wheat flour (about 4 cups) instead of adding white and added 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten as suggested by another review. Didn't grind the oats, but used quick oats and let them soak in the warm milk for 5-10 minutes before proceeding. Used a scant tablespoon of saf-instant yeast and got a great rise in just an hour for the first and 30 minutes for the second rise! Made 2 small 8x4 loaves--perfect for little mouths. This bread is not sweet, but served it up with Brian Perspect's "Homemade Butter" from this website, and the kids devoured it! Love the density--not like fluffy store bread that leaves you starving after 3 slices! Thanks for the recipe.

It's dense. If you're looking for a light, fluffy bread this isn't for you. I liked it, would recommend grinding the oatmeal in a blender or coffee grinder as others have suggested.

I have been making bread for over 15 years now, and this is the best one I've ever made!  It was gone within an hour because everybody loved it. I'm about to make more now, and will probably make it regularly. I did add some wheat gluten because I always do, and a tablespoon of honey. 

This would make a perfect base bread. You could add rosemary, garlic and oregano for an Italian seasoned bread.  You could add cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla for a breakfast-y bread.  The possibilities are endless!

I am making this right now, I was reading the reviews and seeing it doesn't rise very well, I used an instant yeast instead of regular yeast, I have also allowed extra (and some ;-) ) time to rise, it seems to be rising well... can't wait to try it!

Sensational!  The loaf disappeared within a day, and I can't wait to make this for my mother-in-law!

This worked out very well for me. It is obviously a little denser than white bread, but overall for as much whole wheat as it has, it is lighter than I expected. And I used only one cup of all-purpose (used one cup of white whole wheat flour for the other). Ground the oatmeal in a coffee grinder--thanks, other reviewers for this tip! Omitted the sugar and used 2 tbsp honey and 1 tbsp molasses to sweeten. If you want a nice texture in this loaf, be sure you knead well--for the FULL 8 minutes, as this activates the gluten. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!!

This is a really great recipe, but it took a very long time for my dough to rise for some reason. I followed twistedsisterl's advice and ground the oats in my coffee grinder, and I used one large loaf pan instead of two smaller ones. The next time I make it, I think I will add about 1/4 cup honey, as I would have liked a little more sweetness to it. It was a very dense bread. Can't wait to make it again.

This bread was tasty.  It was dense, but I was expecting that, and a little blander than I had hoped for.  Overall a nice, healthier alternative to white bread.  Thanks for sharing!

I echo Kayla Smiths' review - did not rise as expected.  I thought perhaps my old yeast was the culprit so I made another couple loaves with fresh yeast and and got the same result.  Used fresh King Arthur flour.  I did NOT mill the oatmeal as others suggest.  Tastes good but the loaves are small and on the dense side.  If you want sandwich size loaves either use the whole recipe for one loaf, or try milling the oatmeal or adding sugar to get a better rise.

I added a couple of tablespoons of melted butter and an egg plus I used whole milk instead of the 2%. As an experienced bread maker, the dough seemed nice when I put it in for the first rising so I think it'll be great when it's all done!

Very good recipe that lends itself to healthier additions. For my benefit: used 3/4c brown rice flour in conjunction with 3/4c white flour, 1/2c almond flour, full 2-1/2c whole wheat flour, 1/4c  regular oats and 1/4c steel cut oats, and added 1/3c pumpkin seeds. My loaves rose just fine and the bread has a nice crust with a dense, moist interior.  Topped the loaves with some melted butter before baking — YUM!

The flavor of this bread is fabulous.  Like several others stated, it didn't raise like most breads and is a  bit dense.  That's fine by me as I was hoping for a hearty bread.  I'll make this recipe again.

It's really good.  The sugar is barely existent,  so it's basically a healthy bread.  I kept everything the same, except I added half a cup of toasted cracked wheat, a third cup toasted oat bran and used bread flour instead of all purpose.  The first rise was good.  Once divided into two loaf pans, the second rise was not as strong.  Still baked up well in less than 30 mins in convection oven.  Still warm, my wife and I found it irresistible dabbed in herbed olive oil.

A very good bread, loved it! I made in a 9X5 pan as twistedsister! suggested. I did not powder the oatmeal but left some texture to it. Oh, I'll make again for sure, probably weekly. Thank you!

I've made this three times since January, and it's a winner! My entire family loves the bread, which also makes incredibly delicious toast.  This is a very hearty, heavy, filling bread.  I increased the oats to 1 cup, and decreased to the whole wheat flour to 2 cups, just because I love oats in bread.  I followed all of twistedsisterl's suggestions (see most helpful comment)- she submitted the recipe, and she's right.  This is definitely 1 loaf of bread, and putting the oats in the food processor for a few seconds results in a great texture in the baked bread.

The dough just would not rise well.  It was also very difficult to knead because it was just too stiff.  I doubt I'll try this again.

Followed the recipe to a T and it didn't turn out well at all.  Maybe the milk was too hot and killed the yeast, I have no idea.  Considering other people had issues with the bread rising I don't really know what to think.

It's definitely a hit here. I had no problems getting the bread to rise. The first loaf disappeared in about 10 minutes. I might have to make this again soon. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe twice tonight and it turned out wonderful both times.  I altered the recipe a little bit.  I used non-dairy creamer mixed with the water instead of milk because my family has milk allergies.  I used Splenda brown sugar instead of the white sugar because my husband is diabetic.  I used oat flour instead of the whole wheat flour because my husband's sugar doesn't spike so bad with oat flour.  The recipe worked perfectly.  It is so nice to find a bread recipe that works for a family that is so soft and doesn't crumble.  The first batch didn't last the evening and so I needed a second batch for breakfast.
