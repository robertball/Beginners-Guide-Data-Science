A heavy drink that doubles as a dessert. Hints of coconut although none was added. Good base drink for experimenting.

I used 1T of sugar.  I'm not a Keto dieter, but I just wanted to try something different.  I agree with the other reviewer and say that, for me, this is more of a single serving or maybe 1.5 serving size.

I love all things coffee, so this is no exception. I enjoy trying different coffee flavors, even almond butter. My only complaint is that each serving seems small to me...only about 3/4 cup.
