What a wonderful little cookie! It's very delicate and does melt in your mouth. I used the icing on some and powdered sugar on others. Next time I will try drizzling melted dark chocolate on top - a definite keeper!

I made these at Christmas. My Aunt made something very much like this many years ago the name was the same. I remember icing was sandwich between the two domed shaped cookies and the icing was always tinted pink. Great for baby or wedding shower cookie plate. Cream cheese adds a nice second flavor and letting the cookies mellow for a week or two just makes them better.

I would recommend rolling the balls in half the size more time consuming but then they are easier to eat. This is a great little cookie for bridal & baby showers.

I love htis recipe! It was given to me by a friend's mother but I lost it. I was glad to find it here! I made these cookies for a bridal shower and they were a hit! My friend's mother made them for my bridal shower and she added lemon flavoring. They were awesome! They are great because you can color the frosting to go with color schemes.

These are my most requested cookie for holiday baking. I have used it for years and the cookies always get rave reviews. I vary the recipe by using different extracts in the frosting. I have made it with lemon almond and vanilla. The cookies are tender. I use a cookie sheet without sides in order to slide them off. Don't handle them too much just after baking. They are best to make a day ahead as they firm up after being frosted (keep them in the fridge.) They truely melt in your mouth. The frosting is a must with the cookie. I use a pastry bag to pipe the frosting into the thumbprint. Yummy! Try it!

Yum!!!! I have been looking for this recipe for ever! I didn't know what these cookies were called. I was looking under "thumbprints" and kept coming across nut cookies with jam frosting. = ( I did a key word search and found these! Soooooo happy. My husband has never had them and has nearly ate the whole batch in one day. Thank you so much! I did bake them on parchment paper. This way I could lift them up to see if they were starting to brown on the bottom. When they were just starting to brown on the bottom they were done and still not at all brown on the top side. I also used a floured tablespoon measure to make the dough balls to ensure a uniform size. I ended up with exactly 24 cookies as the recipe states. Delicious!

I have no words to describe this receipe it's out of this world. My girls (aged 4 and 2) gave it double thumbs-up. I kept the icing in a piping bag in the refrigerator. The cold icing complimented the cookie really well. By the way I added 2 tsp of lemon juice to the icing that added some tang to it. Very very nice... I am beyond words

Classic! We sandwich two biscuits together with the icing for a real cafe-style cookie. Very easy and yummy. Add some orange zest to the dough and some melted semi-sweet chocolate to the icing instead of the food colouring for total luxury.

Awesome cookies... tastes like little bits of heaven. I do recommend letting them completely cool before removing them from the cookie sheet... otherwise they crumble. Once they cool they stay together fairly well.

I thought these cookies were very good. My husband thought they were bland. They are a lot of work to make and the dough is NOT fun to work with!!!

I did not like these at all. They formed a big ball similar to peanut butter in your mouth. I did add key lime juice to the icing to make it have more flavor.

Now I know where the expression "that's the way the cookie crumbles" comes from. I misplaced my original on-the-box recipe for MM and when I saw this one first on the list I decided to use it. I salvaged maybe 12 of these "delicate" cookies. I was concerned before I even baked them that they weren't very sweet. I need to diligently look for my much better recipe.

I did not ice these I was looking for something a bit less sweet and these fit the bill! They do indeed melt in your mouth and are soooo buttery!

very easy to make and definitely melt in your mouth. My only complaint is that the frosting tasted too much like cream cheese.

These are a favorite in any cookie tin I give. It is such a lite cookie with a wonderful cream cheese frosting. They crumble easily when warm though so let them cool before you remove them. I use parchment so I can just slide them off the cookie pan onto to the counter and keep baking. I got the recipe years ago and am glad to see it here. Now I can just tell people where to go and get it when they ask for it!

Very easy and delicious! I think I would do regular icing rather than cream cheese icing and I would add a piece of cherry on top.

Ok Im torn with my review so i will still give the recipe a good rating because I feel its just a matter of taste! There is nothing wrong with the recipe I just didnt care for the taste of the cookie...I DID NOT find them crumbly whats so ever the dough was perfect they baked up perfect! Again I did not care for them but its not the recipe it was just my personal taste...For me they were tasteless they need a flavor boost for me!

This is a fragile cookie but the cookie itself is tasteless. The indentation baked out so I just tried to spread some of the cream cheese frosting on top. It is the only thing that may have saved the cookies but I don't think I will make them again.

Very good cookie. As I was shipping cookies to my kids I made these in a mini-muffin pan with paper liners. I used powder sugar with maraschino cherry juice and a dash of almond extract to make a pink filling for the well in the top of the cookie. Wish I would have shipped them chocolate chip and kept these for myself.....SCRUMPTIOUS!
