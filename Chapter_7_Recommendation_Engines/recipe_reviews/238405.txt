A very nice salad that tasted better the longer I left it to sit in the fridge. It even pleased the pickiest eater in my family. I had to make a couple of variations. I used toasted almonds instead of walnuts and goat cheese instead of feta. You will find so many different flavours and textures in this salad it really is a new discovery with every bite. I mixed up the dressing and let the cranberries soak in it while I prepared the quinoa and lentils and this plumped up the dried berries so they became nice and soft when the salad was ready. This is a good recipe to use when you need a prepare ahead meal in one. Thank you CleiaBelia for sharing this recipe.

Excellent salad! Very high in protein, fibre and iron. I added red peppers to the salad and a little garlic to the dressing. Yum! Worth a try!

Amazing! I usually double the lemon juice, honey and vinegar to make it more tangy.  Delicious without the feta, if you want a vegan meal.

I made this for a bridal shower and it was excellent.  The only change I made was I doubled the amount of dressing.  Everyone loved it and it was filling.

I made this as a “go to” salad.  I am trying to have ready to grab, healthy food available when I am tempted by the pretzels, trail mix, or chocolate.  I love the high protein, texture, and great taste of this salad.  I have already made it three times, substituting with different cheese and nuts.  Stick with the basic recipe, but It does work well with a little experimentation!

Added grated lemon peel to boost the flavor of the dressing.  Cooked the quinoa in chicken stock.  Added chopped Apple with the cranberries.  It's a very nice side dish.  Good recipe.

The bf and I loved this. I made some changes based on what I had on hand and personal preferences: less oil (1 tbsp), no honey, more lemon juice and vinegar, raisins instead of cranberries, and added a chopped granny smith apple and roasted brussels sprouts. I will be making this again!

I loved this salad.  It was good fresh, and even better after setting a day or two.  When I make it again, I will make at least one day early so the flavores can meld together. One could add any additional ingredients and I think it would be just as good!

This was rather bland and I even made it with Sweet and Hot Feta. It needs something else.

I used a 19 oz. can of lentils instead of dried, and only a half cup of quinoa, but the salad tasted great.  Have made it twice already and am going to make it again for a Canada Day barbecue.  Would highly recommend it!

Easy super healthy salad to have in the fridge for lunches or a great side for barbecues instead of potato salad.

Added a bit more lemon juice, added cinnamon, cumin and corriander to embolden the flavors.  Swapped raisins for the cranberries.  Will try the cranberries with a good chevre in place of the feta next time.

Pretty good, but I would double the dressing next time and add cherry tomatoes. It was very... brown and a little dry.

This is a healthy and tasty salad that you can serve as  a side dish or have as light meat by itself.. The only changes I made was using apple cider vinegar for white wine vinegar and adding some chopped parsley for more flavor and  color.

I have made thus salad twice now.  Once as written with the exception of using dried plums from my friends tree. They were quite small and tart like a cranberry.  Very tasty dish, but not a lover of fruit in my salads so..... The 2nd time I used sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives.  Tasty also. Enjoyed the versatility of the recipe

This was a hit at Christmas Eve dinner! I did some modifications. Quinoa: I toasted it & then added 1 3/4 chicken broth instead of water. Lentils: skipped. Dressing: doubled the liquids, & let the cranberries soak in the dressing over night. I used probably a dozen green onions. I used goat cheese with honey. I left skin on & chopped 2 Granny Smith apples. I assembled everything a few hours before. It was great & I'll make it again. Add some chicken or turkey, and it's a full meal!

This  makes a very good salad and I really love the contrast of the cranberries and feta cheese.  The only change I made was to omit the onion.  The recipe didn't specify which color lentil to use.  I used red lentils and they turned a little mushy.  Any recommendations?  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks!

My daughter made 1/2 recipe and it is absolutely delicious. She followed the recipe as written except she left out the onion as she doesn't like them.  We loved the mixed flavors of sweet and tangy.

This recipe was a great inspiration for my vague idea that I wanted to try a cold Quinoa recipe of some kind for this week. In fairness, I took liberties with the recipe.,  As a Diabetic I needed to up the veggie content in this and add some additional protein.  I also attempted to make a half batch and that didnt end up being the case.  lol.  I added two diced carrots to the last 5 min of the simmering of the lentils. U also stirred in some diced celery to the cold mixture. I had dried dates (Dried cranberries have way too much sugar for diabetics) I used half a videllia onion, along with a bit of diced jalapeno.  I had juice from my meyer lemon tree, which tends to be less acidic, so I added the zest of part of a fresh lemon to increase the lemony flavor.  Also threw in some leftover chicken and plan on eating this for lunch tomorrow.  It's quite wet so after I see how it comes out for lunch, I may add a can of garbanzos tomorrow evening.  I think this will be tasty over shredded lettuces for some bulk and plan on it as lettuce cups for dinner tomorrow night.

This is sooo good. I only had goat cheese so I used it instead and I topped it with blackened tofu for some heat and added protein. Must try it's a perfect compliment!!

Absolutely delicious.  I actually double the amounts for the dressing because it is so good.  First time I made it, I used the cranberries.  The second time I used currants.

Very tasty with some modifications! I put 2 cloves of minced garlic in the dressing, added chicken bullion to the lentils as they cooked, I put a whole bunch of green onions instead of just one and I threw in a diced red bell pepper. I will definitely keep this recipe!

We loved this salad.  I didn't have lentils so I added black beans and corn instead.  Also diced in some red onion.   This is a fabulous base recipe that lends itself easily to adding whatever you have in the house.  The dressing is the key and gets better the longer you let it 'marinate'.

This was an excellent salad. Truroots has a quinoa-wild rice blend that I used, along with Truroots three-colored lentil blend. I used lime juice as well as lime zest in lieu of the lemon juice, and the second time I made it I added some raw shredded red cabbage and diced celery, which gave it a really nice mix of textures. It is really good hot or cold, and my husband liked it with some grilled salmon on top. Delicious and very versatile.

I would like to give this recipe 4.5 stars. I think it is very tasty, especially after it sits for 1-2 days and all the flavour really soaks in. I love the pop of sweet from the cranberry. Although I personally feel that I taste too much feta (I'm picky on cheese). I'd like to try again and omit the feta, or maybe try low fat mozza. Overall, pretty yummy for a healthy dish. Thanks for sharing!

Made it exactly as is in the recipe. Very tasty. This will be my go-to quinoa salad recipe for a while. Serving size isn't as stated though, at least for my husband and I. I used a ladle to dish out about 10 Tupperware containers for lunches. It's so yummy I could have easily brought that down to 5 containers by doubling each serving. Would definitely recommend. :)

I loved this and it was a hit at my covered dish. The bay leaves add great flavor.  I  use pine nuts instead of the walnuts when I make it this weekend for a dinner I am going to.  Very easy and great tasting recipe.

Really god recipe. I think the bay leaves really make a difference in flavor, as does toasting your nut preference. I wouldn't skip those steps again. Love the different textures. I will make this again and again!

This is a great summer salad!  Healthy, refreshing and perfect for these sweltering SW summer days.  Pretty much followed the recipe adding more scallions and one time added a red pepper and did not rinse the quinoa which is probably why it needed more dressing. I also used veggie broth for cooking the lentils and the quinoa I especially love the texture and as another reviewer said...it's more flavorful after it sits in the fridge for awhile.  This is my 4th time making it.  Thanks for posting this.

I love this salad! I'm not a big fan of walnuts so I put in pumpkin seeds instead. And I used golden raisins because I was out of cranberries; not as pretty but still delicious! Good cold or room temp and keeps for a long time.

I omitted the bay leaves (forgot them actually) and toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts.  So delicious even my picky eaters liked it!

I made this for my guy after he told me he hates quinoa. He gobbled it up and is looking forward to the leftovers. He added avacado to his and I added a few cloves of garlic to the dressing. I might add some cayenne to it next time.  A great healthy recipe that tastes good too!
