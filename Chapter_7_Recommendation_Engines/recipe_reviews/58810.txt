I am so proud of Miss Tara. Everyone knew she would win the whole thing. Hershey's didn't know what they were in for...She devotes every moment she has to baking and cooking! Hershey's should HIRE HER!!!! 
Everyone should try these. Tara always adds her sweet special touch to everything she creates and I promise they will be wonderful!!!!
GOOD JOB PRINCESS TARA!!!

I am not sure what she did wrong (below) but I've made this recipe a couple times now, and BOTH turned out WONDERFUL!! My family and friends gobbled it up within seconds and I dont exactly call myself a baker, so the ease of the recipe suprised me.  My husband thanks you for a great recipe!

This was my first ever attempt at a torte.  I thought I followed the recipe exactly, except I couldn't find any raspberry chips, but it did not turn out well at all.  I thought a 9 inch round baking pan would be a 9 inch cake pan, but apparently I was wrong.  In the oven it inflated like a balloon and then dripped out the sides all over the oven.  After 25 minutes it was still liquid, and after 35 minutes, what was left had deflated and had sunk into the pan and was finally finished cooking.  After it cooled, I turned it onto a plate, and it was only about 1/2 inch thick.  When I tasted some of the blobs I had to cut away from the edges to make it presentable, it was very eggy and oily.  The whipping cream and the berries made this dessert edible, so I was still able to serve it, but I definitely won't make it again.  I'll find a different torte recipe.

Excellent!  Made it for a girls' night party and everyone raved about it.  Couldn't find the raspberry chips, as they are seasonal (I'll stock up next time), but the chocolate chips worked wonderfully.

This recipe is wonderful!  Easy to make and delicious.  I served it to 7 couples at a dinner party and every single one wanted the recipe (even the people who usually skip dessert)!

My family loved this recipe!  It was very easy to make, although I had to bake it approximately 10 min longer than indicated.  Also, be forewarned: raspberry chips are only stocked SEASONALLY in grocery stores!  I used different chocolate chips as instructed, and it turned out just fine.  I also made a sauce to go with the torte, using raspberries, sugar, and a few chocolate chips.

OMG! This was so good! I even overcooked the brownie part a little bit(my fault) and it was still so good it made me laugh while I was eating it.  Great recipe!
