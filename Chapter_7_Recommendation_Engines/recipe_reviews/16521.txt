Overall, this is a good recipe. The ingredient list says curry paste is needed, but in the instructions it says curry powder. We used curry powder since we had it on hand. Since our family doesn't care for plain grain dishes, I used the marinade as a sauce. Don't think I would do that again as it was way too spicy.

This recipe was great!!! I altered it slightly by using veggies I had on hand (broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot and some red and green peppers instead of the ones listed).  I also eliminated the peanuts and cilantro, and it still turned out great!

This was merely okay.  Grain a bit thick and heavy and vegetables missing a certain zing (more lemon?)  Tasted like something from the natural foods store- simple and wholesome but unexceptional.
