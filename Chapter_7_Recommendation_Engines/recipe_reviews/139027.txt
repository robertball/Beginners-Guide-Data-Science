Hi! I am the submitter of this recipe, and this is an AUTHENTIC teriyaki recipe. In Japan they do not use less sodium soy sauce. I myself do, but I wanted to stay true to the recipe when I submitted it. So, if you are the type of person who isn't used to salt, or prefers an americanized sweeter teriyaki, this may not be for you :) Enjoy!

I don't think I've ever rated a recipe one star, and I hate to go against all the 5 star reviews, but I have to say I really didn't like this!  I didn't want to look up my usual recipe, so I thought I'd try this one, given all the great reviews.  I thought it was soooo salty, (and I use low-sodium soy sauce.) I kept adding sugar to try and cut the saltiness.  I've managed to salvage it that way, but I probably added close to 1 cup of sugar, and I don't think my kids are going to like this (though we'll give it a shot) I looked up my recipe, which is from a Japanese cookbook, and it's basically equal amounts of soy/mirin/sake(or not, there are variations), along with about half the amount of sugar. So, 2:2:1, soy, mirin and sugar.  I always add garlic and black pepper, and sometimes the vinegar, usually not though.  I also don't usually add the oil (though my recipe does call for a tiny amount)  Anyway, I guess our tastes are for a sweeter, stickier teriyaki sauce, and this recipe just wasn't it.  Sorry!

This is the best teriyaki sauce ever made! I substituted 2 teaspoons of hot chili oil instead of the black pepper and red pepper flakes and ended up with a the most flavorful, perfectly spicy sauce ever. The spice factor lessens while cooking so up to a tablespoon or more of the chili oil could be added. I can't imagine anyone would want to reduce this sauce as it is so flavorful, so to thicken it I add a cornstarch/water mixture while I am cooking with it. Wonderful proportions and very versitile; also good with a little onion. Better than any Chinese restaurant-that's for sure! Update: I recently took this sauce out of my fridge after sitting for about a month and let me tell you! It is even better - if that is at all possible!!!

Hands down the very best teriyaki sauce I have ever had, and that's saying a lot, coming from this 20+ year veteran chef! The only change I made was to add 2 tsp cornstarch dissolved in a small amount of cold water, added to the final simmer. This gave the sauce a little body and helped it cling to the meat. Marinated a top round steak in it for about 4 hours. Teriyaki lovers, take note. Be sure to bookmark this recipe, as it's absolutely phenomenal! Many thanks for posting it.

This is one of the best home-made teriyaki sauces I have had... they are very difficult to flavor properly without being too salty and this one, made with Low Sodium Soy Sauce and thickened with two tbsp. of corn starch mixed in a little water to form a paste is very close to restaurant teriyaki.  Be careful though - too much garlic will qickly overpower this sauce.  Another great addition is half an onion carmelized in the ginger and sugar, set to simmer in the Mirin.  MMM!

Oh, for ten stars! Wonderful, wonderful recipe - never had teriyaki sauce this good! We followed the recipe exactly. We found the mirin and the rice vinegar in the natural foods section of our grocery store. DO use all the garlic and DO use fresh ginger! Thank you, Celeste! (I HAD to use that beautiful name! My daughter is Genevieve!)

My husband flipped over this sauce!  I used regular white wine instead of mirin and ommitted the red pepper flakes, but I doubt either of these substitutions made a difference in the final product.  I cut up some chicken thighes, sauteed them, and then tossed them in the sauce - delicious!

This is absolutely fantastic! I've made this so many times since discovering the recipe and used it for everything from a marinade for salmon to a dipping sauce to a spread for sandwiches. I thicken it with different amounts of cornstarch depending on what I'm using it for. For a glaze/marinade, I find two teaspoons of cornstarch plus enough water to dissolve it in is perfect, but I've even gone up to two tablespoons + water to make a really really thick sauce. Love this recipe!

Delicious! I thickened it up with cornstarch and water like others did and it is fantastic as a marinade or dipping sauce for gyoza.

This came out great, used on broiled salmon, tasted just like a Japenese resturant. I did sprinkle with sesame seed when serving.

OMG!!!!! There's a popular thick bottled teriyaki basting sauce that's been my favorite for years.  Not any more!  I used this recipe the other evening for my Grilled Teriyaki Chicken and Stir Fry Vegetables.  I added green onion to the seasonings and put the cooked sauce mixture in a blender.  I set aside some to add to the veggie stir fry and my pan fried noodles.  I thickened the rest with cornstarch and basted my marinated chicken breasts while they were on the grill.   I experimented with the marinade, using minced  ginger, onion and garlic, soy sauce, rice vinegar, a drop or two of sesame oil, a touch of mirin and a bit of peanut oil.   It was without question the most sensational dish I have ever prepared!   I love Japanese and Asian cuisine, and I have to say, this tasted better than anything I've ever ordered from a restaurant or take-out joint.  It just tasted so authentic.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!  If anybody wants to know my vegetable stir fry mix, let me know and I'll post it.  Scott

Incredible flavor!  I am from Hawaii and this is teriyaki sauce at its finest.  My family prefers this over any name brand teriyaki bottled sauce.  Great for making stir fry!

A few years ago, I pulled together a complete Japanese meal for my father for his birthday (after he came home from Japan raving about the amazing food). I used this recipe for both the chicken yakisoba and as one of the dipping sauces for gyoza and WOW does it beat the pants off of anything you can buy in a store! Even the owners of the Asian store down from my house loved this recipe (now they know why I've turned down all of their bottled teriyaki sauces since). I've made triple batches and bottled it up to have in my fridge (strain it through a cheesecloth first, or you'll taste nothing but garlic and ginger). Absolutely wonderful recipe and so easy to pull together!

Excellent recipe!  I didn't use fresh ginger because it can be a little overpowering.  I used a ginger rice vinegar instead of regular rice vinegar for a little of the ginger flavor.

I didn't have sweet rice wine.  I used 1/3 cup cooking sherry (now see it should have been 2/3).  I used two spoonfuls of fresh minced garlic.  I didn't have fresh ginger, I used 1 tsp ground ginger.  It was very salty, but I toned down with honey (probably 1/2 a cup or so).  But it tastes great!!!

The only way this sauce fulfilled the requirements for teriyaki is for its luster ("teri"), which was only due to the mirin. This was horribly bland, and did not grill or broil well (as teriyaki is supposed to). If you are looking to make teriyaki, it would be much better to buy the premade bottled stuff at your regular grocery store, and add brown sugar, garlic, and spices to it yourself.

thanx for the recipe.  i've used it a few times now, but change things.  thought i would leave that note.  i don't have the wine so i use chicken broth.  i don't use any oil.  also, i use apple cider vinegar.  every thing else is the same.  however, i will add some fruit if i have it.  last time i used tangerines and they were so good.  i've used pineapple.  today, i have an orange.  i'm sure it will be excellent. i will never purchase teriyaki sauce again in my life.  thank you

I've been eating teriyaki about 4-7 days a week since I came back from living in Japan a few years ago. I simply love teriyaki. This dish was a bit too salty for me so I altered it a tad--I added 1/3 cup of honey and 1/4 cup of sake. My normal recipe is equal parts honey/sake/mirin/soy but your recipe has so much flavor I'm going to have to do some more experimenting.

How tasty! I was excited to see that this recipe was created by someone named Celeste! I have the same name, and it is rare to find someone else named Celeste. The sauce was perfect. I used it as a marinade and a sauce.

I  liked this recipe as a marinade for chicken. I followed the measurements, but went a bit scant on the soy sauce. To make it into a sauce, I boiled it down, added some honey, and then thickened it with a bit of cornstarch mixed with cold water.

Way too salty!!!  I had to throw the first batch away.  I made this again reducing the soy sauce to 2/3 cup and using low-sodium soy sauce and it was fairly good.

The first time I made this as written and I found it to be way too salty, even with the low sodium soy sauce. I tried again reducing the soy sauce to about 3/4 of a cup and adding a couple tablespoons of honey and it was delicious!

This came out WAY salty!So to fix this, you MUST be slow when adding Soy Sauce as it may ruin the whole batch. Slice the garlic, DO NOT mince it as it will give that bitter taste to your sauce.

I follow the whole protocol and right before adding chili flakes and black pepper, I tasted and it was SOOOOO salty. Here is my fix:

Add 2 Cups of mirin.
2/3 Cups of Sugar.

How is the final product came out? OH MY GOD! It is amazing. Much better body and punch for Teriyaki Lovers out there, me included! My sons will appreciate this weekend Teriyaki BBQ chicken wings.

Cheers

This recipe is so perfect. I had never ued Mirin before making this and was kind of nervous bc I didn't even know what it was. Turned out great! The only change I made is to use brown sugar rather than white. Give this one a try!

This sauce was excellent!  I did not have any sesame oil, so I toasted 2 Tbs sesame seeds in some vegetable oil. Worked very well. The sauce had wonderful flavor.  This sauce is much more like traditional teriyaki sauce than others I have tried.

I found this recipe to be too salty.  I halved the recipe when I made it.  To the half recipe, I added 1tsp cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup water.   I added the water cornstarch solution gradually when the sauce was boiling vigorously, and immediately turned the heat down after that.  I also added an additional 1-2 tablespoons light brown sugar.  The water did an OK job of taking care of the overwhelming saltiness, the cornstarch thickened the sauce nicely, and the brown sugar mellowed the flavor out a bit more.

I loved this; it was so simple to make, with ingredients that I already had in my kitchen. Besides the common uses such as marinading chicken, I paired the sauce with sliced eggplant and grilled it. Tasted absolutely phenomenal with seaweed and short grain brown rice!

Very delicious! i use this as marinade for salmon, or thin sliced beef with some stir fry veggies and calrose rice, and heat it up and drizzle it over. Tastes like Edo Japan! i find it is better without the minced garlic though.

I can now make Teriyaki vegetables that taste like they came from our favorite Japanese restaurant.  I used michiu (chinese rice wine) instead of mirin because that's all our grocery had on hand.  I have a blank cookbook called "My Favorite Recipes" that I can write recipes in.  Only my very best, tried and true recipes qualify.  I just added this recipe to it.

Really good!  I needed a sauce for some wings so I tried this.  I didn't have the wine, so I used half red and half white vermouth and increased the sugar a bit - wonderful!!!!  Just thicken a little and toss with cooked wings - yumm!

This sauce really is the best teriyaki sauce/marinade recipe. It reminds me of the authentic Hawaiian teriyaki (and that stuff is great). CHANGES: I never use the rice wine and don't think that it is needed. Use 1/3 c. honey instead of sugar for a fuller flavor.

This was pretty good.  I broiled salmon and basted it with this saucebut I think it would have been more flavorful if I had used the sauce as a marinade rather than just basting it.  Still very good.  Thanks!

I have a gluten sensitivity so I can't buy store bought teriyaki sauce.  I decide to make my own. I followed this recipe exactly. No changes. It was perfect. If you want a thicker sauce you can add cornstarch.  If you wondering where to find mirin.  My local grocery store carries it in the Asian food aisle next to the rice vinegar. By the way, my 8 yr old loved the sauce.  I used it to make chicken teriyaki. The sauce smelled so good he wanted to slurp it by the bowl. Obviously I didn't let him.

This is an excellent sauce/marinade I just made and can't wait to try it out. I would reduce the sugar a bit, for those who need to watch their sugar intake. Other wise, I give it a 5 star rating.

I am proud of myself for actually making an authentic sauce. This recipe is fantastic. I did add a bit of cornstarch and water mix to thicken but everything else was done exactly as written. My Boyfriend who is a teriyaki fanatic was so impressed by the flavour. I could eat it with a spoon, but it is going with some pork later today. I just had to review before I forgot! Thanks!!

As others have stated, I didn't like the recipe as is. Even after attempting again with LOTS more sugar, it was still pretty salty, but after about 20 minutes of reduction (where the recipe calls for 5), it had finally reached the taste and consistency I had been looking for. I marinated chicken in it, shredded it, and used it in a fried wonton. I thinned out the other half of the sauce with more mirin for dipping, and it was excellent. All in all it was good, but was no longer the original recipe by the time I adjusted it to my taste.

Too salty the first time I made it. 
I cut the soy sauce by  1/3 and added 1/2 cup of pineapple juice. Raised the sugar to 1/2 cup, and Sesame oil to 2 tsp.  It is very good with Mirin and as good with Marsala sherry. Used Sri Racha sauce for the kick. Chile oil used in some the other reviews, sound like a good idea as well

I've been searching around looking for a teriyaki recipe to rival one a friend once made for me.  All have fallen short until this one.  This recipe is -delicious-.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try.  I followed it to the letter including all of the galic.

Just finished this recipe. I love cooking asian food, so I'm fairly critical of the recipes I get. This recipe was delicious, I substituted the Black Pepper and Red Pepper flakes for a chili oil that I have, I also added about 1 1/2 tbl spoons of Pineapple juice. Before the juice I thought was a little salty seems to be delicious. I also added the cornstarch, love Thick Teriyaki!!

I was looking for something to used with stir fry and this came up.  I'm gluten intolerant so must use a gluten free soy sauce when cooking.  Store bought teriyaki cannot be trusted.  The changes I made were quite a few.  I used plain old white zin for the wine, and only 1/3 cup.  I used a half cup gluten free soy sauce.  Plus I added a dash of fish sauce.  I added all of the liquid ingredients together and let it simmer for about 10 mins. All the solid ingredients went in next. Because I didn't have fresh ginger, I added three candied gingers and a couple dashes of powdered ginger.  I also used brown sugar instead of white.  This turned out GREAT and was a perfect compliment to my stir fry.  I'd give it five stars, but I made a lot of changes.  I didn't think the recipe needed a full cup of soy sauce.

This was so delicious! I didn't have the Mirin Wine, so I substituted Sherry Wine with 2 TBSP of sugar (googled what can be substituted and it gave me this). My kids (5,4 & 19 months) LOVED it as well as my hubby. Thank you for sharing, I will NEVER buy again!

I made just as written (using Shoyu, an organic naturally brewed soy sauce) and it was so salty if knocked my socks off.  I wonder if people are using different soy brands hence the varied reviews.  I added 1/2 c. pineapple juice and 1/2 c. water and I'll use it, but I"m worried about cooking it down when stir frying.  I'll keep looking.

I didn't have any mirin, but I substituted a bit of water and a bit more sugar (I used brown sugar) and this sauce turned out great! I also added some corn starch to thicken it a bit. Could have used a bit more perhaps, but flavor-wise, this was fantastic.

This recipe was gross!  I made it last night, following the directions exactly.  It was wayyyy too salty - my boyfriend called it "edible".  I tried it again with 1/8 cup soy sauce and 1/2 cup sugar, and also added 2tbsp corn starch mixed with cold water...then it turned out great!  But the proportions are WAY off in this recipe.

i added 1 tablespoon of chili paste instead of pepper and red pepper flakes, increased the sugar by a smidge and used red wine vinegar instead of mirin. Also used corn starch to thicken. It was awesome. Served with salmon stirfry. Will make again.

Flavor was good, but too salty.  I added cornstarch to thicken it and the consistency was good.  I did use regular soy sauce, if I make it again I would use low sodium soy sauce.

Not the best, but better than any store bought and most local joint pick up teriyaki places. Also as good or better than any other restaurant teriyaki. It was a bit vinagry. But pretty  good and easily modified with more sugar, pinapple juice, orange juice, more garlic, less garlic, etc...

This recipe is great. It tastes just like the Teriyaki you get in Seattle!  I used the low sodium soy sauce and a bit pinch more red pepper flakes because I like the heat.  This was SO good!!!

This was a very good teriyaki sauce recipe.  I did use low sodium soy sauce as the only kind I buy.  The flavor was not too salty and it was easy to make.  The only problem was finding the rice wine or Mirin.  I would make this again definatly.

Completely excellent! I made this exactly as written and used it for some chicken quarters that I had roasted plain and frozen. I thawed them in the marinade and reheated them in the oven, basting them with marinade. SO good! We also used some of this as a dipping sauce for thinly sliced dry-fried flat iron. My oldest son is a teriyaki lover and expert - and he called this the 'real deal.' Awesome! Thanks for the recipe! ♥

This is awesome sauce, way better than anything you can get in a bottle!  I couldn't find mirin wine, so I used Japanese plum wine instead (it is a sweet wine).  The first time I tried making this, I wasn't paying attention while simmering the wine and it ended up burning to the pan - what a mess!  So the second time, I only simmered for 5 minutes and kept a good eye on it.  I used 1/2 cup honey instead of 1/3 cup sugar, as another reviewer suggested.  It turned out great with these changes.  This sauce is almost as good as what you find in a restaurant!

Wow! What a great, quick recipe with ingredients I had on hand! It was super easy - I actually missed the step of boiling the mirin for 10 minutes (oops!) and just simmered everything while I prepped other ingredients. It was a fabulous marinade for chicken that I used for an Asian spinach salad. Better than bottled, for sure!

Easy to make. My family loved it! I used this to make Teriyaki chicken and rice, To thicken the teriyaki sauce after the chicken has been cooked add a small amount of cornstarch mixed with cold water to the hot teriyaki sauce and it will thicken and coat the meat without changing the flavor. Thank you for a fabulous recipe!

Absolutely the best. Except it was a little bit too salty for me so I added a little water. I will use low sodium soy sauce next time but apart from that it was great! I didn't have mirin on hand so I used white wine and it came out so good. I sliced some chicken breasts and marinaded chicken in the sauce then cooked it, steamed some stir-fry veggies and mixed together. My husband & son just loved it! Thanks a bunch for the recipe :)

This is a really tasty teriyaki.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it was a little too salty and I used low sodium soy sauce.

For those who found this recipe OH SO VERY SALTY, I believe that the manufacturers of mirin must heavily salt the product since it is a wine sold as a condiment. Instead, just use your favorite white wine and you probably won't have the issue. I've been making a similar recipe for years and it never fails!

I am RAVING over this. I have tried way too many teriyaki sauces that were too sweet, or just off for my palate. This is perfection to me. I will not make teriyaki any other way! Sometimes I'm lazy and just pour some of this over boneless skinless chicken thighs in the slow cooker. Not so much sauce that it covers the chicken. I only leave it on low for about 2 hours because I don't want it to be falling apart. That way the chicken almost gets the texture it gets when it's grilled since it's only sitting in the sauce rather than bathing in it. In fact that was so good I think I'll be lazy again next time. My teenagers loved it. I roast veggies with it and use a dab of the sauce on the veggies as well.

I made some changes, due to ingredients on hand, but have made this before as written and it was great! (that said, using low sodium soy sauce). This time, I had to use powdered ginger (1 tsp), brown sugar, and added a touch extra sweet rice vinegar to dissolve well, and sweet chili sauce for the red pepper (1 TBSP), since my sister in law I cook for has a VERY delicate stomach. Beautiful recipe, either as written with low sodium soy,and it can be so easily modified!

This sauce is delicious and very flavorful. The instructions said that it would thicken up. Mine was fairly thin, but I didn't find this a problem. I used Sake since I didn't have Mirin so maybe that was why it didn't thicken up. I read that Mirim is a sweet wine and Sake is more dry...since sugar is an ingredient in this recipe, I figured it would add the sweetness. I would definitely make this again.

Didn't have the Japanese wine so I found a recipe on YouTube. I use Splenda because husband is diabetic. I believe I will try it with half of sesame oil, tasting as I go.I did not add any  thickener because of carbs, but I allowed it to reduce on low on the stove. While it seemed salty and spicy, once on the chicken and cooked, it was good. I placed it under broiler on low,I covered the chicken after being in the oven a few minutes to reduce the sauce  from burning. I allow my chicken to cook to 160-165 internal temperature to not dry it out.

Excellent balance of salty, sweet, and spice.  Next time I'll double the recipe so there are leftovers.  I think I might try a little cornstarch to thicken it just a bit as a previous reviewer suggested.

This was delicious on chicken. I made the mistake of not having enough for everyone to have seconds. I made no changes to the recipe. I marinated the chicken in the sauce for about 1/2 hour before baking.

Finally found my mother's teriyaki marinade !  Thank you!
My mother was Japanese and often made chicken teriyaki with this sauce that tastes identical. She never measured so I watched her put the same ingredients into a roasting pan and she told me how it was supposed to taste before we marinated cut up chicken In Refrigerator for a day or two.. Then we baked it covered in oven till almost done. Then we  finished it on the grill.  Absolutely delicious!

Made as is..THEE BEST!  Made it with cheaper wine...a white sweet Riesling...STILL GREAT!  Have substituted garlic powder and ginger powder when I didn't have fresh pureed up and its still delicious but fresh is better.  Never use any other sauce recipe since I found this one.  I make extra and store it in a container for leftovers...YUM!

Pretty good sauce, although not traditional. It tasted better after it was cooled. I didn't add the whole amount of garlic just because my intuition told me that was too much, plus my cloves were very large. I used it to marinate a pork tenderloin and then heated some additional sauce to drizzle over the top once it was done. It came out perfect.

This was awesome! I know some people hate when you rate something after making modifications but this was delicious as is.  I added two things extra chile flakes because we like it HOTT and arrow root powder to thicken the sauce.  I added this to sautéed vegetables, shrimp and rice for teriyaki bowls.  Simple and so good. I will never spend the money on store bought sauce again.

For the people who say that this is too salty – are you omitting or substituting the mirin? Mirin is a Japanese sweet rice wine and I believe it is essential to this recipe. That being said, if you still think it’s too salty do you have a sweet tooth? That very sweet and thick teriyaki that you’d buy from the takeaway is a different recipe entirely. I don't have a sweet tooth and I thought this was just right. The mirin had a prominent flavour to me (before marinating) and afterwards the sauce was well balanced, and nicely sweet, spicy, salty and sour, with a soft and subtle flavour. I think that it’s also important to note that you should heat the sauce before using (and this includes before marinating) because if you don’t, the garlic and soy sauce could overwhelm the sauce. I also used part regular soy sauce and part tamari because that’s what I had on hand. I heated my sauce, marinated some chicken and salmon, and then with the leftover sauce I just reduced it a little on the stove top. I served it  with rice, green onions and white sesame seeds. 

I will also marinate my meat for a little longer next time - I only did a few hours this time around. I think it will be even more flavourful the longer it sits :)

Pretty snackey. However, next time I make it i plan on only putting in 2/3 cup soy as it was a bit too salty.  I also like it with a little more heat.  So I'll put in 1/2 t red pepper flakes.  This really is a good recipe and it's now  among my favorites. I will just adapt it to suit my own tastes. Thanks for sharing

Great teriyaki sauce. After reading reviews, I adjusted the soy sauce to 1/3 cup. At that point, it was just salty enough. I also added 2 t. corn starch. In the future, I might decrease the sugar as well. But a great sauce. My husgand wanted to eat it on everything.

This is the best teriyaki sauce I've ever made or bought. The only alteration I made was I used low sodium soy sauce. Next time i will try half low sodium, half regular soy sauce to taste the difference.

This is definitely the best Teriyaki sauce I've ever made. I added less soy sauce (low sodium, about half the amount called for) after reading reviews. Only giving 4 stars, considering with the full amount of soy sauce written, I believe it would be too salty.

Awesome!!! Compared it to a Teriyaki sauce from a well known soy sauce manufacturer and this recipe is MUCH better.Less salty and the ginger and garlic flavour is fantastic. For those who want a large amount and who are used to metric system:
400 ml Mirin
600 ml Soy sauce
200 ml Sugar
1 Whole head garlic
2.5 tbsp Ginger
4 tbsp Rice vinegar
2.5 tsp Sesame oil

I tried a couple other 4.5 star teriyaki recipes on this site first, then this one. This one is best! I tried the others because this had mirin and rice vinegar, which I didn't have. But the flavor of this recipe was more savory, I think due to the sesame oil. This wasn't quite as sweet as some, and definitely not as tart, which we liked. I made it pretty much like the recipe, except I didn't have red pepper flakes, so I added a small pinch of cayenne. Marinated chicken thighs and legs 24 hrs in fridge in a ziploc bag (about 14-15 pieces worked). It wasn't too strong like this. Baked at 400 on cookie sheet, then took them out of grease and put them on a separate cookie sheet on a cookie cooling rack and baked convection at 400 for 20-25 minutes. They were perfect! Looked like they had been grilled outside. I took remaining marinade out of bag and boiled it, then added 1 T cornstarch in cold water and thickened it for 4-5 minutes. Made a great sauce to go over chicken pieces and white rice. The next night we had venison steaks seared in a skillet, and this reheated sauce was even better on that! Will definitely make this one again.

I just used this with wild turkey legs and thighs marinated over night. Then I rubbed them with my special smoking rub and slow smoked them at 150-160 degrees for about 6 hours. (I had pork ribs over them and dripping on them...) which may have changed the flavor a bit. Awesome!

Loved it! I used honey instead of sugar, that's how I prepare asian dishes. While this was cooking, my five year old asked, "What is that amazing smell?!?". So that is a ringing endorsement!

I made this for some chicken breast, let it marinade for 2 days in the refrigerator and oh my goodness!  So simple and delicious.  Never buying the bottle again!

This is a great recipe with one exception...way too salty! I'll try other reviewers' suggestions of using low-salt soy sauce or less soy sauce next time. But there will definitely be a next time because this was very good.

This is a great flavored recipe. I went with low-salt soy sauce since it was all I had on hand.  I grated the fresh ginger, and crushed the garlic.  When the cooking part was complete, I strained the solids to avoid the ginger, garlic and red pepper from over powering the sauce by sitting in it.  Using it on a pork tenderloin.  But the taste of it by itself is perfectly yummy.  Would be a great dipping sauce for pot stickers with a little bit of green onion thrown in.

This sauce has all of the great flavor of a good teriyaki sauce. If you have problems with salt add a little extra water to the sauce to cut down on the saltiness or you could cut back on the soy sauce. I used this recipe on 5 pounds of chicken thighs and leg quarters and it came out fine. I still have 1/3 of the sauce left over. I did marinade the chicken for 8 hours in it (refrigerated). Then fired up the smoker and cooked the chicken . I have been using teriyaki sauce for over 45 years and this rates right up there with mine. THANK YOU FOR SHAREING. Russ

Great recipe! I went heavy on the garlic and ginger, the second time I made it. I also substituted about 2 tsp of honey for the sugar.

Great teriyaki.  I couldn't find mirin, so I looked up a substitute.  Heated 2 parts sake with one part white sugar and cooked until sugar dissolved.  This sauce is very rich.  I used it as a base for orange chicken and it was delicious.  I will use the same base for sesame chicken.

This sauce is so balanced and delicious! Salty, sweet, sour, spicy are all present! I did substitute a little squirt of sriracha for the red pepper flakes. When you combine the ingredients and simmer them, the first taste can seem a little salty, but not terribly so. I tossed some chicken breasts in a few tablespoons of this sauce, browned them, then simmered them in the rest of the sauce. I finished by removing the chicken and then thickening the teriyaki sauce with a cornstarch slurry. Between the additional liquid from the slurry and the chicken juices, the salt and other seasonings were perfectly distributed. It also took on a nice chicken flavor. Yum!

Very flavorful and not too sweet.  Fried pulled pork to a crisp, and placed it on toasted sourdough.  Drizzled the Teriyaki over the pork and garnished with chopped scallion.  Most satisfying.  East meet West

I made this because it sounded unique and tasty. I will so make this again. I  took the remaining marinade and simmered it for a few minutes to get rid of any chicken juices. I didn't let a drop of this go to waste.I put it on top of rice and veggies. Yum Yum...........

Really delicious!  I did not find that it was too salty, but I am a big fan of salt so maybe others might.  The only changes I made were to use cayenne pepper flakes instead of red pepper (it was what I had on hand) and added half a caramelized onion, chopped simmering with the mirin.  Amazing recipe, will be adding this one to the "family" cookbook!

There used to be a little hole in the wall restaraunt in Washington. They made their own Teriyaki sauce with steak over rice. I would eat there once a week. This tastes just like it, boy did I miss it. This recipe is amazing.

This is a great sauce. I ended up using marsala wine since I didn't have any mirin on hand. The only other change I made was to add some corn starch to it to thicken it, because I like sauces to be thick. My son couldn't get enough and he is super picky.

Great recipe.  I cut the sugar by substituting Mirin with real Sake and a dash of pineapple juice.  I also used raw cane sugar rather than white refined sugar.  This gave the sauce more caramelization.  I added a tablespoon of hot Thai chile sauce to the simmer as well.  Perfect balance between sweet/salt/heat.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good flavor.  I didn't have fresh ginger so I substituted some ground ginger, about a teaspoon since dried is always more potent.  This would be a great marinade, but for a sauce I found it a bit thin.  I added two teaspoons of arrowroot to about 1 teaspoon of cold water and put that in the mixture and it thickened up nicer, I probably should have added a little more.  You can substitute cornstarch for arrowroot.

Yummy- I don't use soy sauce anymore but used Braggs Amino Acids and while it was on the salty side, the flavor is delicious! I did add more ginger and red pepper flakes as I like more kick. I'm currently marinating in a steak teriyaki sauce that I got from my mom that has other items added- thank you for such a clean good recipe!!

THIS is the BESTEST teriyaki marinade I EVER ate!  I basically used your recipe...but ....I only had 1/3 cup of regular soy sauce left, and used just that...and didn't have fresh ginger, so I used a tablespoon of ground..and didn't have red pepper flakes (can't find that at the store), so used a dash of Italian blend seasoning I had...and used sherry (not cooking sherry...the real stuff)....and WOW...this is awesome!  My son went NUTS with this on grilled chicken!  I am going to make this and marinate the skewed beef you get as  appetizers at chinese restaurants...I don't think I need to find another teriyaki marinade recipe ever again!  Although, I will still try to find just red pepper flakes and use the normal soy sauce next time...I don't use fresh ginger since I don't use it much and it would spoil.  Thanks SOOOO MUCH!

This absolutely fantastic.... to BABYDANE, I don't know what went wrong when you made this, but I would have to say, try again. This is sooo GOOD. This is one of those recipies I keep handy because when I'm at a friends house & they don't have any teriyaki sauce, I love to say, "here, I'll make some" providing they have mirin on hand, they are blown away with the results. THANKS Celeste!!

Agree that it was a bit salty. But cut in a little honey, pinch of orange zest and a squeeze of fresh orange juice. And, man-Oh-man! Were those some tasty country ribs braised in it!! Good stuff!

Delicious!  I thinned out my regular soy sauce w/water, and added about 2 T cornstarch at the end (mixed w/1/4 cup cold water) to thicken it up. Served over brown rice and steamed vegetables.

I have used this recipe many times for chicken marinade for the past couple years; twice for BBQ's with approx 50+ guests and it has been a hit with both adults & the children each time! We did have to substitute the Japanese sweet rice wine with regular white wine this last BBQ, but it still tasted great! This is now my "go to" teriyaki marinade from now on.

I guess I will give Celeste the benefit of the doubt because she defended herself by stating this is authentic Japanese teriyaki...those of us looking for more of a sweet Teriyaki sauce should have paid attention I guess...this stuff is so salty, Maybe use as a marinade, definitely too salty for me, the ginger, vinegar, mirin help but not enough..dont know how Im gonna fix it, probably with pineapple juice and maybe honey and will thicken with cornstarch.

I am an American so maybe thats why I was disappointed by this highly rated teriyaki sauce. I followed according to instructions and I would have to say this was extremely salty. Would probably make a real good recipy for curing and drying meat. I did use La Choy brand and I think I will go back to Kikkoman soy sauce. but that said I am going off of the idea that I wanted sticky sweet, spicey teriyaki..... think - Panda express, teriyaki stix type resteraunts. Probably more Hawaiin style I guess. I don't know but if that is what traditional japanese teriyaki is then I am sorry I am just not cultured enough. Thanks I will keep searching.

Like others, we found this much too salty! I'm still working on cutting the salt by adding more sugar, honey, and water. Not satisfied yet, and I think it needs more ginger.

This teriyaki sauce was so good! I didn't have rice wine so I used white wine instead and it came out great. I used this for a recipe for garlic teriyaki edimame and it came out awesome and then used the rest for dipping sauce for tempura shrimp. I will make this again, thanks!

Super!  The only adjustment will be to double the batch next time.  Lotsa "pop" here on the grill, in the pan, or oven.

This is the best teriyaki sauce ever! (And I've tried ALOT from home made to bottled!) I split the recipe in half... I didn't have rice vinegar so I used white and used ground ginger from my spice rack. It was super yummy!  Marinated my chicken, steak and shrimp in it then cooked in a pan over medium-high heat. I cooked it until the meat had soaked up most of the juices. Then added the meat and sauce to my fried rice. YUMMY!!!

I have four kids and in the rare event (and if you have kids, you know how rare this is) that all four of them like it, then it's a certified success! We made this without the red pepper flakes. We stirfried a bag of frozen stirfy vegetables and some Gardein Beefless Tips (we're vegetarian) and it was a big hit! It's a keeper - thanks for sharing!

FANTASTIC!  Even my overly sensitive child loved it!  Didn't have rice wine so I used Muscato (sweet white table wine) instead and used brown sugar instead of white for a little more depth in taste.  No more purchased Teriyaki sauce for us!

I substituted 2 tsp. hot chili oil for the black and red peppers.  This sauce was perfect--and gets better if you can let it hang out in the fridge for at least a week. A wonderful flavor!

This is my families new favorite recipe and I use it everytime I make chicken thighs and it is even better marinated over night and then cooked on the grill. The only change I made was to add less garlic, the taste was just to strong and my daughter did not like it. Other than that great recipe.

Delicious and easy. I made this for my hubby last night, used Fructose instead of white sugar and thickened with a small bit of corn starch. Served it with steamed veg over brown thai rice and it came out a treat! Husband was still raving for hours after we ate our plates clean! Thanks Celeste!

Very good and a quick sauce that is also a great marinade. If you don’t have Mirin, add a couple tablespoons to a half cup of white wine, sake, dry sherry etc.

I made this sauce and marinated some chicken breast for several hours. I saved about 30% of the sauce and grilled the chicken. It was the best teriyaki chicken I’ve ever had in my life! I cut the chicken breasts into several pieces before grilling and it didn’t take more than five minutes to grill all of the chicken. Served it with a baked potato with everything on it. Was a delicious dinner!

The sauce is easy to make.  I've used it on salmon, shrimp and chicken.

Traditionally you use sake as well as mirin.  I made as directed and found it needed the sake and added 1/4 cup and it was better.  People don't scrimp, add the sake for the real deal.

Gluten free & suggestions: Used a traditional gluten-free Japanese tamari instead of soy sauce (can then be made by celiacs/gluten intolerant). Equally salty, so did not noticeably alter flavour. Used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead and scant 1/4 teaspoon black pepper for the quantities provided, everything else the same. For those who prefer a smoother appearance, use garlic crusher or wide knife to make garlic paste, and a fine grater for the ginger. Suggestion for baking meats: (used 6 skinless chicken thighs to try this).  After brushing on in its marinade form, add 1 tablespoon corn starch with two tablespoons water to make paste, and boiled with 1/2 of marinade an additional few minutes to cook. It then had a glossy appearance and adhered well to chicken. Baked at 375 for 40 minutes, basted several times and added toasted sesame seeds after the last basting. There was a good quantity of thickened sauce left over, and rest of marinade for next use. This was very good and consistent with restaurant teriyaki. Will make it again. For the gluten intolerant, this recipe is the correct teriyaki flavour you expect.

I tried this because I had mirin that I wanted to use up and it's very good.  Not too sweet and it keeps well.  I double the recipe and keep it in a quart jar in the refrigerator so I can do teriyaki chicken at a moments notice.

The whole family loved it! Didn't have any rice wine, so I substituted 50% dry vermouth and white wine with a couple tbsp of white sugar. Everything else per the recipe. I will admit it is salty with regular soy sauce, but it was to be expected. Made stir fry and added sauce to taste and it was great. My 5 and 8 year old kids gobbled it up.

I used this marinade with salmon and the results were astounding. I substituted saki for the rice wine. I intend to incorporate it into my regular cooking schedule.

I had to add a lot of sugar and some water to try and tone down the saltiness.  I used half of the sauce and mixes it with my homemade version of chicken lo mein. My husband and daughter loved it , but I still thought it was still a bit too salty. I don't think I'll be using this recipe again.

It had a very strong flavor and lots of sodium. I got rid of half of it and added a cup of water and more sugar, 2 tablespoons or so. It definitively tastes better.

It was ok. I usd chicken which I marinated and cooked in the sauce with some broccoli. The only thing I changed was using inexpensive plum wine instead of mirin (since I couldn't find any and they both are relatively sweet) and I used less garlic since 7 seemed like way too much. It was very salty despite having used both low sodium Tamari and less of it. I had to add a lot more sugar to make it even edible. It tasted basically like slightly flavored soy sauce. I won't be making this again since it was hardly much better than the bottled kind. I'm quite disappointed.

I tried this recipe after all the great reviews, but I was really disappointed. I thought it was way too salty, ruining an entire batch of grilled chicken.

Hands down the best teriyaki sauce I have tasted. I have doubled it also with great results. I always thicken it with a tablespoon of arrowroot mixed with enough soy sauce to make it pourable, usually 1-2 teaspoons. Arrowroot is a thickener that can be found in the spice section. Arrowroot thickens and stays clear which is nice for this kind of sauce. I will never buy bottled teriyaki again. No need for all those artificial ingredients in the bottled stuff - this sauce is a snap to prepare and cost effective also. Wonderful recipe!

The only change I did was to substitude the sugar with honey. I used it as a marinade for my Japanese barbeque, tastes great on the beef ribs, chicken, even fishballs! I even glaze some of them with eel sauce and they go well together. This is a keeper for me.

I used Splenda to make it healthier, and added more crushed red pepper for flavor.  I marinated chicken and cooked with broccoli, water chestnuts, garlic, and a touch of ginger (and more red pepper of course).  My boyfriend cleaned his plate and then the pan I cooked in!

Would have given this a 5 easily, but in my opinion it needed the sugar increased to at least 2/3 cup. Very easy to make and the flavor is awesome!! Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm not a huge fan of asian food, but this sauce is AMAZING!!!  It will definitely make it's way into my dinner rotation :D

I used low sodium tamari sauce, but I found it a tad too salty still.  I will look for a sauce w/ lower sodium & try this again very soon!

This was good! It was very salty though, so next time I will use low sodium soy sauce...it's a must. I had to add extra sugar to try to offset the salty taste. Great recipe though! Use fresh ingredients! I served it with chicken and brocolli over rice.

Excellent recipe! Only thing i would change is to use light/reduced sodium soy sauce instead because it came out a little on the salty side.
