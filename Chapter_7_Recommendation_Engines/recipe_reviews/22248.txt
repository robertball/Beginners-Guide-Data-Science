best veggie burger i've ever tasted and very fun to make!  i replaced 1/3 of the rice called for with a 15-ounce can of red kidney beans that i rinsed (thoroughly!), drained, and mashed up.  i left some of the rice grains whole for texture.  i also added 1 tablespoon of fresh parsley and a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of each of the following: thyme, oregano, sage, and black pepper.

These burgers are delicious. The recipe makes ALOT of them, though. They freeze well before cooking and then you can defrost as many as you need when you're in the mood for them.

I love this recipe it is so easy to modify. I made it tonight but didn't have cashews so I used walnuts and sunflower seeds. I also added spinach to the carrots and onions. Oh I only had a small sweet onion so I added a bunch of green onions. Yumm. These are great to take out of the freezer for a quick meal too.

The flavor of these burgers should get at least 4 stars, but I'm giving it three because they were so incredibly crumbly.  I couldn't make them hold together at all.  I tried adding some egg and that helped a little, but they still just fell apart in the pan (and I'm not a novice veggie-burger cook--I've done this before).  I actually went back and reread the recipe several times because I thought I must have missed something.  I may try a modified version again if I can think of a way to help them hold their shape a bit more.  Again--the flavor was excellant.

I liked these a lot and so did my friends who asked for the recipe.  Someone suggested adding curry -- I'll try that next time.  The funnest part is mushing it all up with your hands! : )

This is a great recipe! I just made these tonight and I can't wait to see how they do after being frozen. I added spinach and corn just to add some of my faviorite vegies. Finally I can satisfy a vegi-burger craving without having to go to the store.

Made a double batch it made 28 patties.
Made them thin 1/2" so they heat all the way through and are toasted nicely on the outside.
I ground the nuts to a "meal" consistency for better binding so burgers do not fall apart in fry pan.  No need for any eggs.
Chopped the carrots and onions very finely.
Substituted 1 cup of rice for 1x19oz. can of chick peas also ground finely.
Substituted olive oil with healthier and tastier organic virgin coconut oil.
Once all ingredients were mixed together it seemed a bit dry so I added a 1/4 cup almond milk.  The consistency was just like a ground beef or turkey mixture perfect for making into patties.  I did add salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dill weed, and cumin.  I mashed and mixed with my hands ensuring all ingredients were well distributed.  After forming into patties I separated them with wax paper and into Ziplock bag two at a time great for grabbing and making a quick lunch or dinner and into the freezer.  After a half hour in freezer I fried them slowly at medium heat in coconut oil.  They are a huge hit in my house...so tasty...absolutely no crumbling...perfect healthy yummy snack.  We do not eat them as hamburger substitute....we love them alone or in a pita very felafel-like.  Great recipe!!!!

my husband and i enjoyed this recipe.  i had to change the specs, though, because i didn't need 20 patties.  i used 2 cups of cooked rice leftover from a lebanese dish we had bought, 1/2 cup cashews, 1/4c sunflower seeds, 1/4 medium onion, and about 12 baby carrots (abt 5 oz.)  i followed the directions as given and put the 4 1/2 patties on my george foreman grill.  i think next time, i would just add more onions and salt.  overall, great alternative to the bean and meat burgers.  thanks!

This was good but I did it as a loaf and increased the dry ingredients.  It was a bit moist and took wayyyyyy longer to cook than stated.  Children and dh enjoyed so that was all that counted.

Now, I have to admit to not having tried other veggie burgers and this is not written as a comparison to those or to ground beef burgers.  We initally tried the patties plain and not served on a bun with condiments.  I made the recipe as written except that I used raw cashews and sunflower seeds.  We all found the patties to be bland and this could be partially due to using raw nuts.  The overall consensus was that this recipe makes A LOT of burgers; especially, if you feel somewhat ho-hum about them.  We have been using them up in stir fries or with sauces, for added flavour/moisture, which is nice.  The addition of spice to the base recipe is recommended.  I will likely try again with a smaller recipe portion, toasted nuts/seeds and some spices.

Ingenious!  The rice is sticky and holds the patties together beautifully, much better than my usual bean burgers.  I used slightly more cashews because my sunflower seed package was only 12 oz instead of 16.  My (old) food processor bogged down on the rice, and I had to pulse the rice with onion and carrot to make it work right.  I browned the patties on my griddle instead of grilling.  Excellent nutty taste!  I will make these again.

The flavor of this veggie burger was good, but it didn't hold together.  I tried adding egg, but it still didn't work well.  I substituted wild rice and left out the sunflower seeds and added thyme and rosemary.

It was pretty good. A bit crumbly though. I added some curry because I was afraid it might lack spices. I'll do it again, but next time I'll add less sunflower seeds.

Nut burgers...AWESOME! We tweaked the recipe a little and used Trader Joe's Organic Brown Rice (microwave in 3 min.), we also used walnuts and almonds instead of cashews. We followed the rest of the recipe, then added cumin, garlic & herbs. We heat our burgers on a cast iron skillet and break them up as they get crispy. We serve our nut burger (now, ground nut burger) on a whole grain or wheat flour tortilla with jack cheese, sprouts, tomatoes, kosher dill pickles, avocado and Vegennaise. This is our favorite Meatless Monday dish!

Absolutely wonderful - amazing hearty flavor that isn't overly heavy. I threw in a dash of veggie stock with the rice for a little extra oomph. Mine held together perfectly -- I think processing the rice very well is key.

Very good- ours turned out a bit crumbly when we cooked them, not sure why, but we will make again! Maybe I will add some corn as others have done. We are on a wheat/dairy free diet, and this is a great addition- thanks!

I used 1 cup basmati rice and 1 cup buckwheat instead of the three cups brown rice. Cut the sunflower seeds down to about about a quarter of a pound + (300 grams). Did not fry it - grilled/baked it in the oven. Came out great.

I only made 1/4th of a recipe, but otherwise made these exactly per the recipe, using somewhere between 1/2 and 3/4 tsp salt. Tasting the mixture, I thought it really needed something more (hence the 4-star rating for the recipe as-is). I added about 1/4 tsp ground cumin, and thought it was much better. I'd definitely suggest adding whatever herbs or spices you like to add a bit more flavor.

With the extra seasoning, my husband loved it and said it was one of the best veggie burgers he's eaten.

Putting the fresh, hot rice in the food processor turns it into a sticky paste which is what holds the mixture together. The patties still looked pretty soft, though, so I pan-fried them instead of grilling them. I don't know if it would work as well if you used previously-cooked rice. 

I think the total time listed (2 1/2 hours) is way wrong. Most of the prep work can be done while the rice is cooking, so it should really only take the time to cook the rice plus another 20-30 minutes for the final prep and cooking - so less than 1 1/2 hours total.

I followed the recipe exactly, but, the final result does NOT look anything like the picture seen above. Forming the patties seem to stick, but once on the hot grill, the patties started to fall apart during the 2nd flip. Very disappointed.

Instead, I ended up feeding my family aka basically fried rice style.

I'm glad I cut this recipe in half and then half again because it was tasteless.  Not a substitute for a burger in my opinion.

I was really frustrated with these burgers...I should have known better than to not add in extra seasoning/spices. I followed the recipe as directed for the first two burgers.  They were so bland.  The only redeeming quality were the condiments I had on hand. I really wish other reviewers would have rated the recipe as directed before all their amendments.  I will batch out the rest of the "batter" and will be experimenting with suggestions from other reviewers.

These were nice but not exactly what I wanted and made huge burgers. My husband is instisting on me giving this higher than the 3 I would have rated these. A nice enough flavour but would have preferred more texture to them. Will experiment with how much I grind and blend the ingredients. Based on other reviews I added an egg to bind and some dried herbs for flavour and they held together while cooking but squidged out of the burger bun when eating.  Edit: These tasted much better when warmed up under the grill the next day. Have frozen some and am interested to see how they turn out.

These turned out really nice. Mine were a bit crumbly, but not dry at all. They have a nice nutty flavor, but next time I will add some seasonings or cilantro or something to jazz it up a bit. I will try to freeze some and see how they cook up later. I have never used allrecipes.com but LOVE that you can choose how many servings you want to make and it adjusts the recipe for you.

There were great. I added rosemary, thyme and sage, garlic and a ton of salt (salt freak!) Mine were not crumbly at all. I baked them in the oven as another reviewer did.

I made these but they looked really dry and crumbly so I added 2 eggs per 5 servings. This held together better and made 10 veggie burgers. I baked them in the oven for 8-10 minutes per side at 375 because my parents really don't trust me with the grill. They tasted good but if you make a whole recipe, it will make a ton. The second time I made these I didn't add the olive oil because it just gummed up my tiny food processer the first time.

We halved the recipe, and added garlic and basil. It made 10 patties. They are great alone or as a sandwich. Ours weren't crumbly at all BTW.

I've recently become vegetarian and was eager to find some healthy vegetarian recipes. I tried this one today and thought it was great. The patties stuck together quite well and I was even able to grill them on my George Foreman. I will definitely be making these again.

I prepared these last night, put most in the freezer, and cooked up a few for dinner. We had them cooked on a grill pan (lots of smoke!) with veggie gravy and mashed potatoes. They were good, but a little bland, and I wished I had made the patties thinner. Today I took one out of the freezer for lunch, cooked it in a covered skillet with some olive oil over med-low heat for about 10 minutes on each side, and ate it on a hamburger bun with ketchup and mustard. Amazing! The ketchup and mustard really made it shine. Now I have 15 more in the freezer to look forward to. :-)

This stuck together really well, for me.  I really blended the rice, as per another reviewers suggestion.  However, I found the flavour to be quite cardboard-y.  Next time, I'll definately be adding more spices, or something.
