This is a delicious, quick and easy recipe. I followed the clearly written directions using a 10" x 15" pan lined with parchment. I baked for 30 minutes. When cutting the cookies, I made 2" x 2" squares which resulted in 36 squares. This cut resulted in the cookies looking like cake squares and they are NOT cake squares but cookies. Next time I prepare, I will cut into 2" x 4" bars and should have a yield of 18 bars. The icing I used is the recipe for Buttercream Icing by Sharon Gerstman here on the AR site. Thank you Wicked Creations for your recipe and I am glad to see it has received kitchen approval by AR.

I made this recipe when it was still a Personal Recipe. ~ Simple and delicious bar cookie.  I made mine in a jelly roll pan that I just sprayed with PamÂ®.  I didn't have any problems getting them to release from the pan.  I took these to Girls Night Out and they were enjoyed by all and I was asked by several for the recipe.  This recipe comes in handy when you need something quick.  It makes a lot and goes far.  Thanks for posting WickedCreations.

Liked the flavor.  I have now made these four different times.  For this last batch that I made Saturday, I doubled the amount of vanilla.  These are wonderful.  I am glad I can give it five stars.

Yum. Making this now. Inspired by the bakery @ my local grocery store today, where they were giving out samples of sugar cookie bar topped with cream cheese frosting, fresh apple and drizzled with caramel sauce. Made a few adjustments based on the reviews. Increased the flavorings by adding .5 tsp maple and butter flavors. Swapped 1/2 cup of sugar for dark brown. I used fresh whole wheat flour for 3 cups, and 2 cups AP flour. It smells amazing, has a fluffy texture, almost like a blonde brownie. Can't wait to frost it and top it for dessert tonight.

Really enjoyed these but did make a couple of changes.  The dough was extremely dry, I ended up adding two extra eggs to it.  I'm sure I could have added some oil or extra butter with similar results.  I also added a little almond flavor, not because the flavor of the dough was necessarily lacking but rather because I LOVE almond in sugar cookies and it turned out great!

I followed recipe exactly.  Was very easy.  Did not stick to pan.  Cut nicely.  I made a raspberry butter cream frosting that was delicious on these.  
1/4 cup of seedless raspberry jam melted,
1 cup butter softened, mix well.  Add confectioners sugar.  About 2 cups.  I did not measure.  Just by feel.  1/2 tsp. raspberry extract, TBS milk.  Mixed well.  Spread on cookies before cutting into squared.  Was a beautiful rich pink color.  Perfect for Valentines day or Easter.

My family devoured these! Pressed into a cookie sheet and used parchment paper to line pan. I did not have to bake as long as recommended since they were not as thick. I am making them again this weekend, but I am going to make them thicker and use them for strawberry shortcakes

I noted that one reviewer felt these were bland. So, I decreased the White Sugar by 1/2 C and replaced it with Maple Sugar. I also replaced the Vanilla with Maple Syrup. I frosted with store bought frosting and dusted with a little more Maple sugar. De-Light-Full! You could probably also make the original recipe and replace the Vanialla with Peppermint Extract and dust with crushed Candy Canes. I'll do this one again for sure!

A nice soft bar but rather bland. I will have to find a way to jazz it up.

Delic thus far. 

as i was cooking for 2, I halved the recipe. Turns out a bit thick if you use a slightly smaller pan.

Toped with an apple pie type filling
