actual recipe was a little off. if making very small balls, will only make 2 dozen cookies, not four. I also had to double the amount of powdered sugar to cover all the cookies, and the cooking time had to be doubled or they would have been mush; but following these motifications, they turned out excellent. might I suggest 350 degrees instead of 300.

A big disappointment. Recipe seems flawed, as sugar content is much less than found in other snowball recipes. Results do not cook in time stated, are dry and crumble easily, and have a pasty taste.
Not recommended.

This recipe is wrong, wrong, wrong!!  It takes no more than 1/2 or 3/4 cup of powdered sugar to roll these in, yet the recipe does not tell you to add any of it to the actual cookie.  Also, the temp and baking time are off.  The cookies turned out crumbly, as soon as I picked them up, they literally crumbled in my hand.

the measurements for this recipe only actually make about  cookies, so eb careful!  you can substitute pralines instead of pecans.  it is tricky to get these to actually stay in BALLS, they kind of flatten out on the bottom but i don't see any way around this!  they taste yummy though!

Out of 10 people that tried these only one liked them. They were dry and crumbly and the powdered sugar ended up looking like paste.  these will not be on my Christmas baking list.

These are so easy to make - you never think that the little bit of dough will make 48 of them, but it does!  They taste exactly like the snowball cookies my mom used to make...   they melt in your mouth!

Excellent  This is the same recipe as my Grandmother used to make.  It's not gooey or sweet like other recipes that use sugar to supplement taste.

I am giving this three stars because it is an okay recipe.  They end up being very moist and yet dry at the same time.  They taste like you are eating dough and the recipe only made 9 cookies for me.  The recipe calls for more than needed.  Would not recommend unless you want to taste pizza dough.

A 300°  oven I felt was too low. . They came out too soft so I put the oven up to 350° and had to bake for another 20 minutes to get them lightly brown. They came out just like my husbands aunt. Really good.

Good recipe, crumbly. Sugar measurements a little off. Didn't make very much, would double the batch next time.

Good cookie but is a bit technically difficult. I heeded the warnings from other reviewers. I baked it at 325 for about 20 minutes. I let them cool for about 5 minutes before rolling them in the powdered sugar. I still had a few of them crumble but once I got the hang of using a light touch it worked just fine.

Loved them, have made them many times now.  Yes, they can be a bit dry!  Use some shortening.  I refrigerate the dough prior to making the balls and I do cook them at 325 and check to see if slightly brown on the bottom.  Gotta make them small, or you will not make many!  Try them!

I did not care for this recipe.  :(  I thought the baking time was off; temperature was off; amount and type of sugar was wrong.

The finished product has a decent overall flavor, but it's hard to get around the crumbling and falling apart. This recipe seems to be missing a binding agent, and the measurements seem... flawed. Also, I don't know if anybody else noticed, but the ingredients say "1 pinch of salt" but the recipe itself never says when to add the salt... and the measurement for flour was odd. Either way, I don't think I'll be using this recipe again anytime soon and will stick with my family recipe.
