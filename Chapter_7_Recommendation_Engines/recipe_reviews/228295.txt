We worked in Saudi Arabia for nearly 24 years (we are Canadian) and loved the Saudi people & their wonderful hospitality.  I tried this dish in an attempt to recapture the essence of the great food Saudi Arabia offers & was delighted with the result.  Thank you Zahra!

This was good but it is definitely missing some things.  We (Palestinians) make it with bell peppers and shredded carrots.  We also fry some almonds and yellow raisins at the end and sprinkle them on top.   I don't use the 7 spices either. I use cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and all spice in addition to the bay leaves and dried lime (black lime) instead.

My mom's best friend lives in Saudi Arabia, and her husband used to cook this for us when I was younger.  While this particular recipe smelled and tasted different than the Kabsa I have had (I know there are many variations to Kabsa, much like the Spanish Paella), it was still good.  I do think that the broth used to cook the rice needs more chicken flavor, even after boiling the chicken in it, so next time I would add some boullion.  I used 2-3 times more chicken than this recipe called for, and it still seemed like a lot of rice in comparison to the chicken.  P.S. My 2.5-year-old daughter ate this dish without hesitation!  I think the raisins won her over :)

I'm only rating the rice although based on its flavor, I know the chicken will be wonderful too! This is exactly the flavor my friend from Lebanon would make in her rice chicken dish.  I never knew the name of until now.  
This will be a regular and next time I will make the chicken with it.  I had already put together Chef John's chicken kabobs for dinner today.  One note-be sure to check the package of your rice for cooking times.  Mine was only 20 minutes and thankfully I checked it before it turned mushy! Thank you for a great recipe.  I made the 7 spice Baharat to use next time:)
Update 9/16- Tonight I made the chicken and it was great.  We all loved it.  I fry my rice along with the onion for several minutes before adding the chicken broth.  Then I cooked it for 10 minutes.  I kept having a mushy rice problem until I did this.  The seasonings in this recipe were perfect!

Used no salt added tomatoes since it's winter right now and used a recipe for baharat to make my own.  Was wonderful- will make again!

This is one of my favorite recipes!! I use either chicken or boil lamb. When saut√©ing the onions and tomatoes I add some red bell pepper. And when I have brought the water out of the rice, I stir in half a can of chickpeas as well then let the rice finish. I use semnah instead of butter because I prefer the taste with rice. I use this dish when I want to impress :-) thanks for sharing!

I came across this recipe and couldn't wait to try it for my kids.  It was a little of bit of extra work but the end result was well worth it. The rice smells so fragrant and tastes delicious too. My kids devoured it. Thanks for the recipe Zahra !!
