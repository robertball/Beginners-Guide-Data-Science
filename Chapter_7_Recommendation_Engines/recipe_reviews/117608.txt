I made something just like this last night but I think it was even easier. I mixed the quartered biscuits with cut up pepperoni and mozzerella cheese and then put them in balls and placed them in muffin tins. They were served with pizza sauce for dipping. Delightful!

This makes a great snack, its easy to throw together, and doesnt take much prep/cook time.  So delish, and you can easy just make it up as you go if you don't have all the ingredients.

Yes this is quick and easy and you can choose your own toppings for this, but the taste of the biscuits really over powers the rest of the ingredients. I'd make these again if I needed something really quick and easy and didn't care much about taste.

All I had on hand were the butter-flavored refrigerated biscuits, and canned garden vegetable pasta sauce, and those worked great. I used margarine instead of butter, and I still used the onion and vegetable oil, but omitted the garlic clove, basil and oregano since I was using the canned sauce. I sliced some baby tomatoes, halved the slices, and added them over the biscuit slices. Instead of mozzarella, I used extra shredded colby jack cheese, and sprinkled garlic powder on top of the cheese before placing it in the oven. I always sprinkle garlic powder on top of any cheese-covered dish, and I love how it turns out. Overall, this was a great dish. I'm a huge pizza lover, and this hits the spot. I plan on making it again, only next time I want to add some sliced bell peppers and maybe some extra sauce.

My kids made these and ate these for lunch today.  Followed the instructions, but added some sliced pepperoni to 1/2 for one of my kids.  Great snack or lunch idea for kids.

This was a very interesting recipe... my youngest daughter thought they were chicken and ate a few of them.... I am not sure if I would make this again. They weren't bad just not my favorite..... Followed recipe exactly.
