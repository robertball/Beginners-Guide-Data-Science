Not bad, but much more prefer walnuts instead of ham.

I made this using regular mayo and Jazz apples, and I didn't add parsley.  I added walnuts, grapes, and golden raisins.  The dressing for this salad is too liquidy for my taste.  I wondered how it would be to use orange juice concentrate instead of the juice.  How can you go too wrong with the ingredients?!  Thanks, Vicki Pierce!
