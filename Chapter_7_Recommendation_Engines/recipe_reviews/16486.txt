This was OK, but nothing special.  The dressing, which is like 1000 Island dressing, was fine, but did not go well with the apples and the Hearts of Palm.  The dressing has too much mayo, I think - it was a bit overpowering.  However, the dressing was good as a dip for the avocado slices.

Although I didn't use the dressing (stuck to ranch) the flavors in the salad were wonderful.  My boyfriend was skeptical of the apple in the salad, but he ended up having seconds and so did I. The creamy avocado, tangy hearts of palm and sweet apple blend together so well.  I used extra avocado and cut the apple down to one. I think it would also taste good with some crumbly cheese like bleu or goat cheese.

Probably easier to use Thousand island dressing than making it from scratch.

Very tasty dressing.  Although I only used a small portion.  If I had used the whole dressing, the salad would have been soup.

I was very excited to try this recipe because of the interesting combination of ingredients, all of which I love. However, it just didn't have the OOMPH I expected from it. The recipe called for way too much dressing, and was too sweet but still bland.  I can't put my finger on what this salad needs, but I would definitely try it again with some alterations.

I loved the textures and different flavors of this salad. I cut the apple down to one and I did not have granny smith apples so I used red delicious instead, it was still great! The dressing was fine, I certainly prefer fresh over bottled so I would not suggest using Thousand island like some others have. I did however prefer the salad with a simple dash of olive oil and vinegar, salt and pepperâ€¦There are so many wonderful flavors going on in this salad, not much dressing is really needed.

I agree that the dressing is rather like 1000-Island, but being made with fresh ingredients was a bit tangier than bottled.  The combination of apple, avocado and hearts was enjoyed even by teenagers!  Just go light on the dressing and not smother the taste of the apples and avocados.
