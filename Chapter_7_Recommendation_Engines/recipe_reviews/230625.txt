This was pretty good but I added a few things to kick up the flavor. I used chipotle peppers instead of the chili powder to give it a smokey flavor plus I added some garlic about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and a dash of Worcestershire sauce. I also added another can of kidney beans since 2 lbs of beef was a lot of meat.

Very good chili--tasty, but heavy on the liquid, and I didn't use 2 cups of beer.  I used 1 can of beer, which amounts to about 1 1/2 cups.  I think I'd cut  back on the beer and make sure the beans are drained next time.  I like my chili thicker and less runny.  Makes a ton--as most soups and chili's do--so it's a good thing we liked it.  Hubs had 2 servings.  I did use half the amount of meat and added lots of garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was decent chili although not particularly memorable. I'm still on the lookout for something that really packs a punch.

1 lb Chuck Steak, 1 lb Italian sausage substituted for ground beef.  Omitted salt.  1 tb Chipolte chili powder instead of 2 tb regular chili powder.  1.5 cups dried beans substitutd for each of the canned beans.  2 bottles of  beer instead of 1.5 cups.   Added 2 tsp mexican oregano.  So yummy!

Awesome chili with just the right amount of spiciness to it. Not too hot but just right. The flavor is delicious too. We'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Very nice I used 1 bottle of beer and added garlic for flavor and a little sugar to cut the tomato acid. I recommend using more beans and also adding a little corn starch for a thicker chili. The Hubs loved it!

I would've given it 5 stars except for the fact that it came out so watery other than that it was probably the best chili I ever made!

It just seemed to be missing something tried adding some more chili powder cumin and also some hot sauce I think maybe the beer put a different twist on it that just didn't appeal to me.

Chili came out good I cut back on the hot pepper and chili powder by only using two small jalapenos because the rest of my family does not like much heat.

This was very good and easy to make. Took it to work and everyone love it. Love just cook meat and then let slow cooker do all the work.
