Based on the flavors in this dish I knew I would like it, but, I was surprised how much my husband liked it! It tasted just like a pesto, but, with a nice twist using cilantro.   I did think the garlic was a little strong for our taste, so, next time I would only use 2-3 average sized cloves.   Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious.  My mother-in-law said this was the best salmon dish she’s ever tasted.   Next time, I will use fresh cilantro as the recipe calls for (I used dried).

A week later, I made this again, and again it was superb!  I used fresh cilantro this time, and what a difference it made!

Cooked it in the clay pot and it was delicious.  The only thing I changed was to use olive oil instead of butter.  Served with rice blend and salad.

Delicious and easy to prepare. I baked for 15 minutes  and that was enough time.  Hubby would have liked more spice

I had my brothers and a friend over for dinner, and had been wanting to try this recipe. It sounded so good, but was completely underwhelming. Also, the cook time was WAY too long. The salmon was very overlooked, and the pesto just didn't wow any of us. I followed the recipe to a t. I will not attempt this again.

Turned out Yummy! Hubby even liked it. I didn't have cilantro so I used parsley but I can't wait to make this again and try with that instead.

I used a 1.92 lb coho fillet for 4 people with only 3 cloves of garlic as another reviewer recommended. All four of us are serious foodies and like to cook. This easy entrée was outstanding. We will use this again.

I happened upon this recipe by accident when, out of interest, I did a search for salmon and walnuts. This is a really lovely recipe. The only change I made was to add a bit of lime juice to the spread and extra garlic. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe. It's a keeper for me.

I made this for company on short notice and it turned out wonderful!  The only change I made was the nuts; I used pistachios instead of walnuts because I didn't have any. I broiled them for about one minute before serving and it added a little crunch to it. This recipe is a keeper!!!

This was a huge hit at my house! I didn''t bother with the food processor, I just chopped by hand and the chunky texture was nice. I put it under the broiler for a minute at the end to crisp the topping. Great recipe!
