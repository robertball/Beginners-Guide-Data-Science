These waffles were fantastic!  My family enjoys the flavor of vanilla in our waffles, so I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain and also added a tsp. of vanilla extract. YUMMY!

These were really good.  My two year olds even ate them!  I made a couple of changes after looking at the reviews.  I actually used low fat milk instead of water.  I used half wheat flour and half all purpose flour.  I used vanilla yogurt, and vanilla instead of the vinegar.  I topped them with applesauce, a little lite syrup and some cinnamon.  Yum!  I loved that they were more healthy than regular waffles! Thanks for posting this recipe!

Wow, these are good.  A few tips.  First do NOT SKIP the vinegar.  This is what adds lightness to the dough, and you can't taste it at all - it is a chemical reaction you need to give you light, fluffy waffles.   Second, keep the fat of your sour cream/yogurt in mind.  Full fat will need more water added to the batter, while low or fat free will need less water to get the right consistency. Also, because I like my waffles this way I added 3 Tbsp of demerara sugar (i.e. Sugar in the Raw) which adds a little sweetness, a little crunch.  These are great.

Yummy!  I used vanilla yogurt because we always have that on hand.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and left out the vinegar.  So delicious and creamy - just like a previous reviewer said!  Much better than a mix from a box and not at all difficult to make!

Not bad for basic, very light and fluffy (I used vinegar).  I added vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, and 1T sugar.

Excellent!Fluffy and flavorful. My husband was skeptical at first but quickly ate his words along with most of the waffles. These have become a staple at my house. The only change I made was using vanilla yogurt instead of plain because that's what I had on hand.

Christmas Morning GOOD! Need I say more. If perfect can be improved upon though I did make the first batch as written then for the next batch, I followed the lemon jce. instead of vinegar w/ 1 tsp. of vanilla advice and it was delicious. We served them with homemade chunky applesauce and syrup & cream! What a delightful breakfast!

More like 4.5 stars really.  I doubled the recipe and used a container of vanilla yogurt and subbed half whole wheat flour for all the ap.  I got six waffles on my belgian waffle maker this way.  I took a family poll of this recipe vs my normal go-to and this won hands down.  DH really liked that they were nice and moist and didn't suck up all the syrup like my normal recipe.  I think I've found a new go-to.  Thank you for sharing!

My daughters loved these.  I didn't have any vinegar so just left it out and also took others advice on the vanilla yogurt and vanilla extract.  They were the best waffles ever!!!  We will definately be making these often.

The perfect breakfast in a pinch when you're all outta milk.  I used whole wheat flour and added a touch of vanilla. Great recipe!

Amazing! I was out of milk, had weevils in my easy waffle mix and this was a life saver! I even used light sour cream and fat free plain yogurt and they came out amazing. I did make a few adjustments:  I omitted vinegar I added 1/2 tsp vanilla I also added 1/4 cup brown sugar  Wonderful. Thanks so much Holly George! You saved dinner time!! :)

I was skeptical about this recipe, but I let my son pick and this is the one he chose.  My skepticism soon disappeared. These were very good and all the kids really liked them. I used fat free sour cream and nonfat plain yogurt.  I left out the vinegar and added vanilla as other reviews suggested.  I also used an egg substitute.  After cooking about half the batch I added some sugar to the remaining batter.  I really don't think it made much of a difference though.  We will definitely make these again.  Next time I will try vanilla yogurt instead of plain.

Since I had leftover sour cream and yogurt to use up, this was a perfect recipe! Made half a recipe, using reduced-fat sour cream and fat-free vanilla yogurt, and they came out pretty decent.  Froze them and they are still good after a quick pop in the toaster oven.  Will make again!

Great recipe. I used vanilla Greek yogurt, which was on hand in the fridge. I added a splash of vanilla & a couple tsp of clarified butter. **Be aware that this batter really puffs up in the waffle iron. I found I needed less batter to make a waffle. With strawberries macerated in sugar & lemon juice & sliced bananas & warm maple syrup...DELISH! Thank you for the recipe!

Best waffle recipe on the whole site! Crispy outside, fluffy and soft inside! From start to finish of the entire double batch I made! Thank you for this recipe! It's my new favorite! I've always made my waffles and pancakes from scratch and after trying several waffle recipes over the years I've finally been lucky enough to try this one! My sons loved it too!

I made this for my husband's birthday when I couldn't find the one his mum had given us.  I was a little worried he wouldn't like it as much, but he thought it was better than his mum's recipe!  The waffles were great!  Thicker than our normal recipe, so we'll set our temperature higher next time (I think it was set on medium heat before).  Oh, and I didn't have yogurt (since my hubby doesn't like it) so I used 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup milk.  My mum even liked it as well and she's not a huge waffle fan. :) Will definitely make again!

5 stars for being able to make waffles without milk! we ran out of milk but really wanted some waffles for Saturday and found this recipe. Incidentally, I have a tub of sour cream that needed to be used up. I ended up using 1 cup of sour cream (as I didn't have any yogurt), 1/2 cup WW flour and 1 1/2 cup AP flour. It was great! I noticed that there weren't any sugar in the recipe and didn't mind it at all because it is not as if we don't already put enough syrup/whipped cream on the waffles! Thank you for an ingenious waffles recipe!

I just got my first waffle maker and this was the recipe I decided to try.  I used fat free sour cream, fat free vanilla yogurt, and egg beaters, as that is what I had on hand.  Very good...the kids gobbled them up!

These were delicious! My husband said, "Waffles didn't really sound good to me, but these are great!" then proceeded to eat two of them. :) Changes: I A) used maple yogurt instead of plain to punch up the flavor - yum!, B) added a tsp. of vanilla, C) substituted half whole wheat flour, and D) added about a tsp. of cinnamon sugar. I'll absolutely make these again. These were a great way to welcome in the new year. Happy 2010!

This was great! I have one comment for the people who thought it was too dense and rubbery. When working with waffle, pancake and muffin batter, only mix the dry and wet ingredients until just moistened. Make a well with the dry ingredients and add the wet to the centre, and gently mix together. Overworking the batter is what makes the results chewy.

excellent, very easy & light!  I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain and the taste was incredible.  100xs better than anything you could get in a waffle or pancake mix and just as easy.  This recipe made 5 waffles for us and we'll definitely make them again and again.

First of all, if you want to complain about calories, fat or "health" how about keeping that stuff to yourself as it is you that have issues, not the rest of the world. My changes were simple; doubled the sour cream, added vanilla and separated the eggs and whipped up the whites to be folded in just before cooking. Skipped the yogurt and vinegar. Result? Killer waffles with a light texture. Lather in butter and maple syrup and you have a winner! We are making waffles here not tofu.

These were alright.  They had a light texture which was nice, but were not crispy which we were looking for.  Also, they had very little flavor.  I added vanilla and a little brown sugar too.  Next time will need to add much more to give these some oomph.

We liked this alternate recipe for waffles from our regular buttermilk recipe.  My husband loves raspberry flavor so I decided to take a raspberry twist here with these yogurt waffles.  I used raspberry yogurt, the sour cream and milk instead of water to make a richer, thicker waffle.  I did use the vinegar because I know that makes for a richer waffle, as it will thicken (sour) the milk based ingredients...you never taste the vinegar...don't delete this ingredient.  For more flavor, I added a splash of vanilla extract and about a tablespoon of sugar.  In keeping with the raspberry flavor, I made a quick raspberry syrup in a saucepan using raspberry preserves, a bit of honey and a small amount of orange juice.  The syrup was sweet, hot and full of raspberry flavor for our raspberry yogurt waffles.  Rounded out this breakfast with sides of sausage, hard boiled eggs, raspberry yogurt with a berry garnish to keep the theme going.  Oh, and juice, of course!  What a great breakfast!

How nice to find a waffle recipe that doesn't include butter and sugar! I substituted whole wheat flour, vanilla for the white wine vinegar and used 1/2 cup nonfat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. Great protein packed breakfast especially if you're watching your sugar and fat. My husband and I substitute diced peaches for maple syrup. Will definitely make again!

Fabulous!  Made these to use up my sour cream and plain yogurt.  They turned out really good!  Husband wants vanilla added to them next time.

Great flavor!  I took other reviewers opinions and used vanilla yogurt [actually Honey Vanilla Greek yogurt] and added vanilla - yum!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I wish the outside stayed crispier longer....they softened up fairly quickly.

Great waffles!  We were out of milk, so this recipe was perfect.  I had to sub 1 cup of whole wheat flour for the all purpose (I was almost out of flour too).  The only yogurt I had was blueberry, so that gave the waffles just a hint of blueberry flavor.  Also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Great flavor and texture.  Hubby and 2 yr old loved them too.  Can't wait to make again!

I didn't have any yogurt or white vinegar, so I just used double the sour cream. I also added some vanilla extract. I really liked the flavor and texture of these; they tasted like and felt like crepes, but they were waffle-shaped. Yum!

This is a keeper ! Quick, Easy and Great tasting. Followed recipe as far as adding the vinegar, as I believe the reaction between the little bit of vinegar and the baking soda gives it the lightness some have thought they were missing, also took advice from some of the other reviewers and used vanilla yogurt and added a tsp of vanilla and got light airy waffles with great flavor. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

Great waffles. Nice and fluffy. I included the vinegar others left out (figured it was probably a chemical reaction thing) but also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1 tbsp sugar when I blended in the eggs. Next time I make them I'll be sure to cook them a smidge longer so they're a little crispier and they'll be perfection.

I liked the easiness of this recipe, but the flavor didn't have me wowed. Perhaps trying a vanilla flavored yogurt would have lent more flavor and sweetness, but I only had plain yogurt on hand, so per the recipe, that's what I used. Not sure what the vinegar does? This recipe gives a more cake-y waffle, not airy and light. Since it does not call for sugar, it is probably a better waffle to have with heaping spoonfuls of sliced fresh fruit, berries, and whipped topping.  Because it was easy and uses ingredients I always have on hand, I'm saving it, but will make modifications to our preferences in the future.  A very creative way to make waffles without buttermilk or milk though! Good job!

I agree with 1JOHN513, THESE WAFFLES WERE EXCELLENT!  My husband is still asking me how did I make waffles without milk (it'll be my secret).  Added a little sugar, vanilla, and used Greek yogurt--YUMMY!  Oh the things you can do without milk!

These waffles were very good. I can't understand what there was NOT to like---I didn't even pick up on any tang from the sour cream or yogurt! I did find the batter very thick, so thinned it w/ a little water and also added a T of oil so they wouldn't stick. They cooked up beautifully and I served them to my family for dinner last night and toasted the leftovers for my son this morning.

i really wanted to like these after reading all the reviews, but i could barely stand to eat a waffle if it didn't have any topping on it, i just found the flavor very odd....they did fluff up nice though.

Wow - I loved these. Light, fluffy & very tasty. They didn't crisp up but my waffle maker doesn't really crisp waffles very well. I thought my yogurt was plain but it was vanilla, so I had a little sugar & vanilla added. Delish!

These are the best waffles ever.  They are super moist.  We usually use vanilla yogurt, but have used whatever yogurt we have on hand, i.e. peach, strawberry, etc.  A family favorite for sure!!!

These were pretty good and very creative I might add.  I would definitely use reg. sour cream and possibly try vanilla flavored yogurt.  I added a tsp of vanilla as suggested by others and I separated the eggs.  Add the eggs with the reg. ingredients.  Once combined, beat egg whites until fluffy.  Fold egg whites into batter.  This will keep it light and fluffy because it adds air into the batter as you fold it in. You can you this method with pancakes, waffles, etc.  It takes a little extra time, but well worth it.  Good recipe!

I used flavoured yogurt instead of plain and they were delicious! If you are not going to eat them right away, keep them warm and crisp by sitting them directly on the oven rack at about 175 F.

I don’t normally write reviews but I LOVE this recipe. I did make 1 change... I separate my eggs. I put the yolk in with the batter & then beat the whites until they are firm & peak. After I beat the batter, I fold in my whites.

These were great.  Light fluffy and super easy to make.  I used lemon Greek yogurt and added the teaspoon if vanilla extract as well.  Our four year old son gobbled it down.  I also whipped the eggs whites till fluffy and folded them in at the end.  Will definitely make them again.

I found this recipe by doing a search for waffles excluding milk (had a craving for waffles but not a drop of milk in the house). These are the most amazingly delicious, light, fluffy waffles! At first I thought the batter was going to be too thick, but it was perfect. I would make these again even if I had milk!

I made this with 1/2 cup non-fat Greek yogurt and 1/2 cup 2% Skyr instead of sour cream. The batter was WAY too thick so I added about 1/2 cup more water. My 4-year old and I loved them!  Next time I’ll try adding vanilla and cinnamon for a little more sweetness.

So good! I added in one TSP of vanilla and they were perfect. Fluffy and moist! For those that complained that the waffles weren’t crispy, just pop it in the toaster! I normally freeze them for my husband to eat for breakfast or just as a snack :). I also used whole wheat flour instead of AP flour and they still turned out great! I might try adding blueberries next time

I make a lot of waffles; various recipes. This is one of my favorites. I like to throw in a few handfuls of chopped pecans. I also substitute vanilla in place of vinegar.

These were very easy to make and used all Greek yogurt (no sour cream) and White Lily self-rising flour, omitted the baking soda.

Very nice and they came out very fluffy. They do puff up, so wont use as much batter to make as it spilled out a little. I will add bacon bits next time and perhaps spices as others have done.

Will make again.

I just made a double batch of these and they are the best I've tried so far. Makes a lot more than reported if using a simple round wafflemaker (not belgian).  I made 15  of  6" round by about 1/3" thick ones on a little Sunbeam wafflemaker I got second hand. I'm not a good baker but these were as easy to mix up as the recipe said. Packing them in freezer bags to give for Christmas gifts with homemade topping.  Just used a hand beater and batter got smooth quickly and it was fun seeing the bubbles form from the vinegar and baking soda .  Delicious as reported - crisp thin outer layer, soft, fluffy inside and really nice flavor. Changes: used fruit-on-the-bottom greek yogurt container instead of plain since that's what I had on hand - fruit and all, worked fine. Added a little vanilla and 1/8c  brown sugar as other recipes have been very bland or even bitter but may not have been necessary given the fruit yogurt.  This will be my go-to recipe.

Best waffle recipe! I had no yoghurt or white vinegar but used double the sour cream and low fat milk instead of water. I halved the recipe and blended it in an Isagenix blender. It made 5 delicious waffles for the 2 of us.

Delicious and easy. I halved the recipe, used three quarters nonfat greek yogurt and one quarter regular sour cream, and substituted vanilla rice milk for the water. I also added a bit of vanilla and a handful of frozen blueberries to the batter.

I was looking for a waffle recipe without milk (we were out) and found this delicious mix!  I did make just a couple of changes.  As I didn't have plain yogurt, I used a lemon cream pie Yoplait yogurt and it was phenomonal.  I also added in a splash of vanilla and a splash of almond extract.  Superb!

These were very good.  I agree with other reviewers that they start out crispy on the outside but get chewy quickly.  That said, I only used half the batter the first day, so the next day when I used the second half, I left them in a little longer and they stayed nicely crisped.  They went from a B to an A+ on the second day.  I think it might have been from the batter sitting overnight as well as the longer cooking time.  The only change I made was to sub about 1/2 cup white whole wheat flour.  Next time I might try adding vanilla like other reviewers suggested, but I would not eliminate the vinegar, I think the chemical reaction makes the batter so light and fluffy and really delicious.  My boys liked these a lot with agave nectar, not so much with fruit and whipped cream. Since the batter isn't sweet, it helps to have a sweet topper for the waffles (although I actually like them plain).  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great! I added a tsp of vanilla, used lowfat vanilla yogurt and a tsb of sugar. These came out nice and crisp on the outside and soft in the inside. Tip is to spray the waffle maker with each pour of batter to get it crisp

These were very yummy!!!  I too added some vanilla and a couple of TBs of sugar...although, probably leave out sugar next time, I don't think they needed it.  My waffles we crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Very nice texture!  The other adjustment I made was to sub 1/2 whole wheat flour and make the all purpose 1 and 1/2 cups.  I would recommend giving these a try!

These were excellent - We were wanting waffles and had no milk.  I knew if I came here I would find someone else who was in the same situation.  Curious to try them with whole wheat flour next time.

This was very tasty and even using fat free sour cream and light (fat free & sugar free) berry flavored yogurt still produced a light, flavorful waffle with a nice crispy crust.   I did keep the vinegar in there, which I think makes it crispier on the outside. I also added vanilla to the batter.  Using the berry yogurt was nice because it added some really nice flavor. We used some thawed blueberries with splenda and a little vanilla to top them. YUMMY!

I had some sour cream to use up so I tried this instead of my usual waffle recipe. I made a couple of changes based on what I had on hand and personal preferences. I used 1 cup w.w. flour and 1 cup a.p. flour, strawberry yogurt, about half the amount of salt called for and 1 tsp vanilla. These were very good fresh off the waffle maker, but if they sat for a minute or two they became chewy. I prefer a crispy waffle so I popped mine in the toaster for a few seconds and that solved the problem.

I made these with 1 C low-fat plain yogurt and no sour cream, plus 1 t vanilla and no vinegar. They were a tinsy bit chewy - easier to eat with your hands or with a knife - but still tasted good. The recipe is easy enough but they are just average waffles, nothing special, so I rated it a 3. But it's handy when you're out of milk. I think they'll be fine toasted tomorrow too.

I definetely didn't think this waffle recipe was anything special. It definetely was lacking something. I added a little sugar after I tasted the first waffle. It wasn't bad but I will keep trying other recipes.

This was really yummy!  Here's my changes:  instead of plain yogurt, I added peach- it was in the fridge. You couldn't taste the flavor.  I also used only 1 cup white flour and about 3/4 cup whole wheat flour,.  Very popular with 2 teenage boys.

These were good... not great... they were kinda chewy.  We put a strawberry puree on top with whipping cream.

eta: I tried them again today using 1/2 c sour cream but then a cup of milk (no yogurt).  I also subbed 1 c wheat flour.
The texture was better, but not the flavor.  ... I'm still working on it.

Ever since I made this recipe it has now became the only waffle recipe I now use.  I like the creaminess to the waffle.  Normally we put sliced bananas and strawberries on the top with a little whip cream instead of syrup.  It's a Sunday morning fave.

It had good flavor but was pretty dense. I prefer light, fluffy waffles and these sit pretty heavy in my stomach. They were a bit chewy as well.

these were good. a bit tart which was nice against the syrup but other than that it was no different than most waffle recipes.

our old waffle recipe has definitely been replaced.  This one is very fluffy,great taste and texture.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla as I think vanilla makes everything better. Yogurt was plain nonfat.  sour cream was light. kids and i loved it!

These waffles are light and filling.  They are very good served with strawberries maserated in sugar and vanilla over night.  This is not a crisp waffle on the outside.  That was not a problem for my family and I.  We found it to be a very good waffle and look forward to having it again.

I served these with sweetened sour cream (1/2 c. sour cream, 1 Tbls. sugar, 1/8 teas. vanilla) and warm mixed berries.  The flavor of these waffles was good, but it makes a very dense, heavy waffle.  Another reviwer described it as sponge-y, and that's exactly right.  My husband and I prefer a lighter, crispier waffle, so these weren't really to our taste.  But if you like a heavy waffle, I'd highly recommend these.  Thanks!

These were so yummy!!! I only had low fat sour cream, so they would have probably been yummier with the regular. My husband loved them!

Great texture.  Very Fluffy.  Used 1/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup vanilla yogurt because we ran out of sour cream.
