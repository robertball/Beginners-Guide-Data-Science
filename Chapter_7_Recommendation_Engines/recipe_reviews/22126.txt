very good pie--i've had this one before, only slightly different.  i used a graham cracker pie crust instead, and garnised the top of the pie with the whipped cream instead of spreading it all over.  my dad loved blueberries, and he loved this pie.

I made this a completely no bake dessert by buying a premade Graham Cracker Crust, (the larger one), The only other change I made, was using the whole can of blueberry pie filling.  It was pretty good, however next time I make this, I will make my own blueberry sauce instead of the canned.

Great pie and so easy to make.  I also used a premade Graham Cracker Crust which cut down prep time.  I had made the mistake of picking up a can of blackberry pie filling and it was just as good as the blueberry.  Took to church for lunch and was completely gone!

I was looking for a dessert using ingredients I had and this was the one I chose.  I had no cream but I did have Cool Whip and I put that on individual servings.  Used less sugar in the cream cheese, trying to cut back wherever I can.  We loved it and will make it again.  Thank You.
