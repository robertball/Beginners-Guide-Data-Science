The usual popcorn balls taste like sugar and a little salt. The Butterfingers added a great addition because they have a more complex flavor. Better yet, they are not super sticky -- wet wipe cleans up fingers real fast. This was also very easy to put together. We recommend this recipe to anyone.

We made about a half recipe to use up a small bag of microwave popcorn. It was about four cups so we estimated the other ingredients to get the proportions right. Having not made popcorn balls before we did get the coating process a little wrong -- the trick is "quickly" meaning right that moment, so have everything ready and a helper. Nevertheless, this was a great success!

When we make this again we are going to add coarsely chopped peanuts and a few more marshmallows to hold them in place. But that is optional. They taste great as written.

easy to make, liked the addition of the butterfinger.  stirred them in after I had mixed the popcorn/marshmallow mixture.  i didn't want the warm marshmallow mixture to immediately start melting the chocolate and end up with a goopy mess.  I doubled the batch and made bigger popcorn balls.  I did add vanilla to the marshmallow mixture and a little salt to the popcorn.  Otherwise I think it would have been a little bland.

Fun recipe! I didn't have the mini marshmallows on hand, so I found a conversion chart and used 28 regular sized marshmallows instead. I took my ice cream scoop and put little scoops into muffin tins.  Worked great for a group of kids!
