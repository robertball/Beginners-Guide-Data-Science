We LOVED THIS! I could not find the lemon pepper panko crumbs, and later discovered that I was out of the plain panko crumbs, so I just sprinkled the cauliflower w/ a little lemon pepper seasoning, along with the salt and pepper, a little garlic powder and a little crushed red pepper flakes (Thanks, LTH!). I also used light butter. This turned out so yummy that I can't wait until cauliflower goes on sale again, so I can make this dish~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I enjoyed this.  I used olive oil instead of butter and mixed with the breadcrumbs and I didn't have lemon pepper Panko so I just added lemon pepper seasoning with herbs with the regular Panko.

Cauliflower alla Parmigiana Haiku: "Is it possible? Five stars for cauliflower? This was delicious!" I have to enthusiastically agree with the other reviewer's incredulity at finding this dish so wonderful - I was not expecting to be blown away by ... cauliflower. I used plain panko crumbs and lemon pepper seasoning, but otherwise followed the recipe. Ended up serving this in pasta's place with a spinach/tomato/sausage from AR, and frankly, the cauliflower was the ultimate stand-in for noodles. Ultimate Unbelievable Captivating Cauliflower.

It was just hubby and myself so I only cut up 1/2 a head of cauliflower.  Put in my steamer until a fork went into without any effort.  Made the rest as directed and put under the broiler for about 7-8 minutes until it started getting brown.  Loved it and it didn't heat the house up for very long.

I couldn't find the lemon pepper panko so I used plain panko and added lemon pepper.  It was really good.  I think it would have been just as good with the plain panko.  I think the plain panko would acutally go better with a main dish that has a strong flavor.  Really this recipe could be made with any seasoning.  I think an italian seasoning would be really good too!

This one is a keeper! Delicious and easy, grating your own parm makes a huge difference, I have tried the lemon pepper pankos but I do prefer the regular and add my own lemon pepper seasoning.

This recipe was a Michael Chiarello creation for progresso. https://www.food.com/amp/recipe/chiarellos-cauliflower-alla-parmigiana-441828. I first discovered it around 2009 and have made it many times. The first time, I ate the entire dish by myself! No guilt either!

Changed it up a bit but the basic idea was the same. Made my own breadcrumbs with panko, melted butter and penzey's lemon pepper; then mixed that with the cheese and proceeded as the recipe suggested.  Will make this again!

This is a definite keeper!  I steamed the cauliflower for 10 -15 minutes.  I used one of those glass pie dishes you can buy in the grocery store, so that I would have a large surface to  spread the breadcrumb mixture.  Also, I combined the plain panko with the parmesan cheese.  My husband is oohing and aahing as I write this.  Thank You!

I loved this, but I love cauliflower anyway.  It tasted like perfectly cooked cauliflower (cooked, but still firm and flavorful), with parmesan cheese and seasoned bread crumbs.    I added a dash or two of garlic powder to the cauliflower, and probably doubled the parmesan cheese.  I think I would have liked this more with a bit of liquid or sauce, like a bit of bechamel in it.  But still, I enjoyed this and would make it again.

This was a great recipe.  Was looking for something new for cauliflower and the whole family enjoyed it (even those who don't usually care for cauliflower).  It's a keeper!

My picky family loved it! Even my five year old!
There were no leftovers, which is a first with a veggie!
Definitely will make again.

I absolutely love this recipe. I've always made it as written. While it won't be as good, you can thaw and drain frozen cauliflower and it's still great! I just put the frozen cauliflower in a colander and set aside. Such a simple recipe but it's become a staple in my diet.

I was looking for something simple but special for Easter dinner.  The cauliflower was delicious.  i didn't have the lemon pepper panko, so I used Italian flavored bread crumbs and added a few shakes of Mrs. Dash lemon pepper seasoning.  The topping was nicely toasted.  Michael Chiarello is my favorite TV chef and I was so happy to try one of his recipes.
