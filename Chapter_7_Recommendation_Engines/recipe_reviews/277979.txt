I was given a lot of dried cherries and have been looking for a way to use them. We have tired salads and cake and brownies but we still have a lot of dried cherries. I think this will be a winner. I may change the white chocolate chips to milk chocolate ones since that is what we have but everything else except the yogurt is in the kitchen now. Should be good
