My two sons and I made this dessert together tonight. Because I'm low on white sugar, we used half white and half brown sugars. We made no other changes. This pie took almost double what the instructions stated to bake! Our pie was REALLY full, which I'm sure was part of it, it was a very good tasting pumpkin pie. I think the spices could have been increased. A nice pumpkin pie--very easy. Just be aware that if you make this yourself, this might take longer than you think to bake. EDITED: The filling for this pie is so light and fluffy. One of the best I've had.

The pie just wasn't that interesting. Pretty bland with a strong clove flavor. Definitely would use only about 1/8 tsp of cloves if I were to make again, but I think I will try another recipe next time.

Finally, I have it memorized!  I am welcomed at thanksgiving's nationwide :D  Delicious and not overly sweet, although in certain circles, I will use a bit less sugar, and it still gets raved about.

To make pumpkin puree from a sugar pumpkin, halve it, butter it and cook at 350 for an hour, until its super soft.  I find you can usually just mush it up, instead of actually putting it in the blender.  YUM

I used all brown sugar. I removed allspice as I don't care for that spice. I also cut ginger and cloves to 1/4 teaspoon each. I like the pumpkin flavor to shine. Cloves has sharpness to it. It can take away from the pumpkins delicate flavor.

Fabulous recipe, so easy with same measurement for all spices. Got amazing comments on it when served. People who did not expect to like it that much were bowled over and asked for the recipe. I used fresh pumpkin (after scraping insides & microwaving in 2 inches of water in covered casserole for 30 minutes, then scraping the cooked pumpkin off the skin & blending to create a puree - then put in coffee filter to drain off the liquid)so I don't know if that made a difference or not but it sure was worth the effort! Will make again, and again, and again!

Its a good pie. Easy to make.  I in no way felt that it was too spicy in any way.  In fact it could be more for me and my family. 

Followed recipe exactly and no chamges needed for a good pumpkin pie.

This is a very good pumpkin pie recipe.  I do not care for cloves so I eliminated the cloves and allspice and increased the cinnamon to 2 tsps.

Yum yum yum! Tasty pumpkin pie filling...needed to be cooked a bit longer, but other than that, great! I didbn't have any ground ginger, so I skipped it out and it turned out just fine without it. Thanks for the recipe!

It turned out a little soggy, therefore not having a lot of flavor. I doubled the reciped, and had enough filling for 3 whole pies.

This recipe was very tasty.  Exactly what I expected!  After reading some reviews I was afraid of the pie being a bit soggy, so I baked it on the higher temperature for an extra 5 minutes.  Everyone at work loved it..great pie!

I LOVE pumpkin pie and I love this recipe because it is so quick to put together. I only use 3/4 c. sugar, 1/2 of brown and the rest white. I put in two rounded teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, instead of all the individual spices, (didn't have allspice anyway), and used whole milk. Needs to bake for 60 min. after turning down to 350 degrees. Yummy!

Oh so good!  Best pumpkin pie I have ever made.  Used cream instead of evoparated milk.

I was unhappy with my last pumpkin pie & was looking for a new recipe.  Made this for Christmas dinner & it was the best tasting pumpkin pie I've ever tasted! This is now going to be my standard recipe.  No need to look further for a delicious recipe!

This was quite good.  I used a home made pie crust and it was pretty tasty.  Will make it with a touch more cinnamon & nutmeg next time though as I felt those flavors were lacking a little.

really enjoyed this - even though I messed up and forgot to add the sugar :( until it had been in the oven 11 minutes - took it out and stir in the sugar and it tasted fine -  very smooth and creamy.  I did fine that it was baked 12 minutes under the recommended time and was very firm.  I will definitely make again.

Everyone who has tried this pie agrees that it is the most delicious they have ever had.  I make this without the allspice or cloves (I don't have any!) and with a teaspoon of pumpkin spice.  My favorite dessert!

There is not a thing wrong with this pie!  It's perfect!  I've been making it for the holidays for years now.  Everyone loves it, except my mother in law, because everyone raved it was the best they have ever had ;)-  Didn't mean to hurt her feelings by making better pie than her.

This tastes exactly like my Mom's Pumpkin Pie! It's fairly simple and I usually always have the ingredients on hand so if I get in the mood for some Pumpkin Pie I just toss all the ingredients in the blender and voila! An hour later, I have a delicious pie! This is definitely the Pumpkin Pie Recipe to beat! Thanks Marlene!

I have yet to taste the finished product, however, I did taste the batter prior to adding it to the pie shell.  If using homemade puree, make sure you are draining it through cheese cloth or a coffee filter for at least 2 hours prior to using.

I am delivering this to a friend.  It turned out perfectly.  I used the exact recipe and actually cooked it 10 minutes less than was called for.  Remember altitude and ovens vary the cooking times.  Gas ovens cooks quicker than electric ones, as a rule.

Thanks for the recipe!

I found it WAY WAY too sweet. I would suggest using 3/4 cup sugar instead of a cup of sugar. I dont think it even needs any whipped topping since the pie itself was overly sweet.

Excellent recipe. I love the texture of this pie. I did make a couple of changes just because I prefer brown sugar and more cinnamon.
Thanks for the recipe

Good pumpkin pie recipe. A bit sweet. I would probably use 3/4 c. of sugar next time. This is similar to the recipe on the pumpkin puree can.

This was so good and so easy to make! I did not have ginger, nutmeg or allspice so I just used 3 teaspoons of "Pumpkin Pie Spice" and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon!  I just made it last week but I am craving it again!

Loved it!! I used this recipe when I made my first pumpkin pie and my husband and I just loved it! Im going to make one for my thanksgiving dinner! Make sure to also read the instructions on the pie crust box. Some crusts also have special instructions about baking the crusts. Good luck!

Loved this recipe!  We made ours after carving our pumpkins for halloween.  Very flavourful, though we did add a bit more of the spices than was asked for.  Thank you!

This was a great recipe! I followed it exactly and put it in a deep dish pie plate. I found that it took at least 25 mins more to cook. I made it twice this Christmas and both times it took longer to cook. Very yummy, not too sweet and the spice was just right. THANKS

This is wasmy first attempt at pumpkin pie from scratchl, and it turned out PERFECT!!! The only thing I did different was the spices, I only had cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice. Also, doing the ingredients in steps does make a difference in taste being more even- mix the spices, add in the pumpkin, slowly add milk, add beaten eggs. Also, I used fresh pumpkin not canned.I would probably never use canned again if it wasn't so cheap! Thanks for a keeper! HUBBY APPROVED

I doubled the spices and used brown sugar instead of white. It was fantastic! It looked a little liquid-y when it came out of the oven but, after giving it a few minutes to set, it was perfect. Not a single crack, and it set all the way through. Delicious!

This is a great, classic pumpkin pie recipe.  Although you can use canned pumpkin it tastes best with fresh pumpkin (I prefer to half/seed/foil wrap/then bake my pie pumpkin at 350 for an hour then scoop into a bowl and mash it.  If you like your pie a little sweeter you can add about 1/4 C. more sugar to it, but otherwise you can't go wrong with this recipe at all!

Yep. It's the best. Honestly, I have never enjoyed pumpkin pie so much as I did this. And, I used my own pumpkin, not canned, and it came out perfect. Not watery in the least.

The recipe makes 3 whole pies when doubled. I doubled the recipe, but only put 3 cups of evaporated milk in it and it came out just right for moisture content, it took 7 minutes longer on the top/middle rack and 20 minutes longer on the middle/bottom rack than directed. I used the full amount of cloves, but next time I think I will split that amount in half or just leave it out. The pies come out very well set after cooling about 10 minutes.

This pie turned out watery and no matter how long I left it in the center wouldn't cook, and the crust ended up overcooked.  I might give it another try to see if I did something wrong.

I added 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice. The elderly woman I made it for said she hasn't had a pie that good since her mother passed. Thank you so much for this recipe. It made me feel great to share it and I have made it twice since then. It will be a regular tradition in my home from now on.

I make this recipe every year with a fresh pie pumpkin that I buy at Trader Joe's, and I bake it in the Pecan Nut Crust recipe on this website. I start by cooking the pumpkin, and then I put it and all the other ingredients in a blender for easy  mashing and mixing.  I use just a sprinkling of cloves, otherwise I agree with other reviews that it's too clovey. One year I forgot to put the sugar in the blender, but all the older people who dislike sweet sweets still really enjoyed the pie. I love to serve it with fresh whipped cream that has a bit of confectioner's sugar folded into it after whipping.

I've been making this recipe for many years, and didn't realize I'd never reviewed it.  I love pumpkin pie, and prefer using the evaporated milk over sweetened condensed or other popular options.  To me, this simple pie is just the right combination of pumpkin and spices, and I will continue to turn to this recipe.  People who insist it needs to cook longer might want to test by inserting a knife an inch from the edge - if it comes out clean, it's done, and will continue to firm up as it cools.  (BTW, I think warm, room temperature, and cold pumpkin pie all have different flavors ... try it all 3 ways!)

Made this with real pumpkin boiled and pureed at home. Made them into cupcake sized pumpkin pies for individual servings and loved them! Baked at 425 for 15 minutes then at 350 for 20 minutes. The only minus was that it came out very pale in color so I wonder if more puree would give it a more orange look. Taste was addictive, all spice with the other spices was a great replacement for pre made pumpkin spice.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving - I did make some minor alterations (as I tend to do!), I didn't have quite enough evaporated milk so I topped it up with about 1/4 cup of Eagle Brand condensed and dropped the sugar amount a little to compensate for the extra sweetness.. I also combined brown and white sugar (about 2/3 to 1/3 ratio white to brown) and I eased off on the salt a tad and the cloves as I don't love them.  I added a little crust heart to the middle and everyone LOVED it - I made it twice actually and amazing both times! topped with fresh whipped cream.

Made exactly as stated.  Turned out perfect.  This is a somewhat spicy (not bland and watery like some other recipes)pie with a nice, rich color.  Everybody loved it.  Day after Thanksgiving several of them wanted to know if there was "any of that pumpkin pie left".

LOVE this recipe!! I've made it over 10+ times, and it always turns out well. Much more flavorful than store-bought pie or the recipe on the back of the pumpkin can. Sometimes I make this as a fudge-bottom pie, by putting a 1/2" layer of chocolate ganache onto the crust before pouring in the pumpkin mix. I always make extras for friends & family during Thanksgiving.

It ok, hard to tell when its done and I used fresh homegrown pumpkin. Took about 40 minutes longer to bake and I used two tsp of pumpkin pie spice, it could use a lot more spice though. I will use this recipe again to see if it will turn out then. I will add a photo tomorrow. I used a homemade gluten-free pie crust, because my family is going gluten-free, well trying anyway.

I loved the pie - that part was definitely a 5-star. The problem was that the recipe is for one nine-inch pie, and in retrospect, I guess it means one deep-dish pie? It filled 2 standard pieshells (not deep-dish)and the timing for those was perfect (a bit jiggly in the middle when they came out, but perfect after letting them settle for awhile) and I got 2 pies! I can definitly see, though, that for a deep-dish pieshell, you'd have to add time in the oven.

Delicious, but took 60 minutes to bake at 350 F. I lowered the sugar amount to 3/4 cup and used brown sugar instead and it was still good.   The top cracked a little bit so it did not look too nice, but tasted good anyway.

Yummy!  This smelt absolutely wonderful cooking.  Unfortunately we were too stuffed to eat this for dessert yesterday, but it made a fantastic breakfast with coffee, and great elevensies snacks and I'm looking forward to another piece before bed!

Really yummy!  Nice, simple pumpkin pie!  I've had fancier, but for a basic pie - this is top notch, has a lovely taste.  I will try again with a different crust, fancy it up a bit :)

I made the recipe as directed, and I found it to be soupy, which made for a disastrous trip from the table to the oven!  The pie came out tasting delicious!  However, it didn't look so pretty, since the pie filling had spilled out over one side, so the crust got partially covered.

Fantastic recipe! I served this pie at our Thanksgiving dinner this year and everybody raved about it. Not your traditional bland pumpkin pie. I will be sticking with this recipe for now on.

This is really, really good. Downgraded 1 star because I can't call it the "best", but since I can't find my favorite recipe this one will replace it. Note: it made too much filling for 1 deep dish crust so I made 2 pies, not quite full.  Next time I'll probably use 2 regular rather than deep dish.

I love pumpkin pie and this one was definately up there in my ratings.  Unfortunately I live in an area where pumpkins are unavailable, so I made it with a rather orange squash (you can't have Thanksgiving without pumpkin pie!).  The texture and taste was pretty much the same; I used condensed instead of evaporated milk and omitted the cup of sugar completely.  It was still a bit sweet but I put hardly any sugar in my whipped cream and that balanced out the sweetness.

One of my hubby's favorite pies.  I chose to bake a pumpkin instead of using canned.  We taste tested the pumpkin with the sugar and spices before I added eggs and milk and agreed that it needed more spice.  I added more cinnamon and nutmeg (Hubby loves nutmeg.)  Having tasted the finished pie I think that I'll cut down on some of the sugar next time, because it tasted really sweet.  I used foil to cover my crust and it turned out great.  Thanks.

Wow!! There were no leftovers!! My husband, who is not a big fan of pumpkin pie, loved it. I couldn't fit all of the pumpkin filling in to the pie crust though. I dont know if this is because I used a 9" rather than 10".

This pie had a good flavor, but the crust was all soggy on the bottom of the pie- and I cooked it for almost an hour to insure that I got a nice crust. My younger sister loved it and ate it anyway, but everyone else went for the other dessert tray. I'll give it another try to be fair, though.
