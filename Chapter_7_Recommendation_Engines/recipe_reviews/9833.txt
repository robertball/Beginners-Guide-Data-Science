Well...These were a good cookie. However, I had to make 2 batches. The 1st batch followed it to a T and my cookies were slightly flat and needed a little something, but couldn't put my finger on it. Went back and looked at some other reviews and made the 2nd batch. I took the white sugar decreased it to 1 1/2 cups and added 1/2 brown sugar. I increased the vanilla extract to 1 1/2 tsp, increased the flour to 3 cups and used 12 oz white chips(works out to 1 3/4 cup--one bag) and 6 oz Macadamia baking pieces dry roasted. I didn't see the need to measure out 4 oz---I like nuts so I used the whole bag. With these adjustments, I got a nice flavorful cookie as I think was intended, and still slightly soft in the middle...I have a gas oven so 8 1/2 to 9 minutes was just perfect. Even though the first batch was decent, the 2nd batch was excellent..I couldn't rate this a bad recipe at all just some minor help. Will make this again with the adjustments.

My family really enjoyed these cookies.  I was a little disappointed only because they flatten out so much.

This is the tastiest basic cookie recipe I have found.  You can add a variety of ingredients to this to make different cookies for ex. choc. chips, nuts, dried fruits, or just sprinkle with colored sugar. You can follow this recipe exactly as it is, no improvements necessary.  You won't be disappointed!

Cookies are good...not as good as sex but good. If you chill dough before cooking they don't become as thin as if you don't. Also they need to be cooked for 10 minutes not 9 minutes. Thanks

very very good cookie....so what if they flatten out, just make your little cookie ball taller instead of flatter before you stick them in the oven...not hard

These are basically sugar cookies with white chocolate and nuts.  I will stick to my original white chocolate macadamia nut cookies.  Need to add brown sugar to these

Easy, simple, and with ingredients I can keep on hand at all times. I will make this again, but I tweaked the first batch a bit.  I ran out of vanilla extract so I used almond instead and I only had 2 oz of nuts.  So the next time I make this, I will do it the right way!! When pulling the cookies out of the oven, it's important to let them cool for about a min or so because they are so gooey in the center.  But when they cool, they firm up and are sooo yummy and chewy!

Easy cookie to make, liked the consistency although I felt like they were missing a little something.  The taste was just a little on the bland side.  The look and presentation was good, I did not find they were too flat like other reviewers had mentioned.  I also froze individual dough balls to use at a later date.

These cookies were great.  They definitely reminded me of a white chocolate macadamia nut cookie, but were slightly different.  Be sure to not bake over the time they specify b/c they bottoms will burn.  Try and sneak a few while they are hot, they are SO good.

The opinions of my friends varied enormously: some were trying to out-do
Meg Ryan's famous "deli" scene while eating the cookies, others said that
no food can be better than sex. Everyone agreed though that these cookies
come really close! One funny thing: they grow really big - I mean wide but thin -
and I pictured them as thicker and smaller. But maybe it's just wrong expectation.
Anyway, the name is definitely catchy and better or not, they are a guaranteed
success at any party!

Like anyone else I read the rating on these cookies before I made them...with only one bad thing said about them I was sure they would turn out perfect! But I was wrong...I tried to go the 9 min but they were still super raw, so I added another 2 min and took them out, they had crunchy outsides and raw insides still. 
Overall they were really yummy, I don't know how anyone could call them Better than Sex, there is no way a cookie can compare to good lovin', haha.
I will try these cookies again and again but I will have to experiment, maybe I will take my Nieman Marcus cookie and just add white chips and macadamia nuts...hmmmmmm, anyone that has suggestion please put them down for us...maybe the author of the recipe? Please! Thanks!

These cookies turned out great and I’m so sorry you think there better than Sex! Hum? Maybe because 9 minutes in the “Oven”, is more than you last!

I've made these on a couple of separate occasions.  The first batch I left in too long because they didn't appear "done" on top. Big mistake. 

Make sure not to overbake them and they'll be outstanding.

pure deliciousness in cookie form.  I always take mine out when they are a little raw looking. I assure you they will continue to bake on the pan while cooling.  that way you don't get a burned bottom.  ick

I love this recipe.  I changed mine up a little, instead of regular Vanilla Extract I used the double strength Vanilla at the dosage it calls for in the recipe.  It's a little hard to find Vanilla Baking chips where I live, so I used White Chocolate and rolled them into thick little balls.  No trouble with the cookies flattening out for me.  :)

I made these for some friends at work and everyone laughed about the name.  It is a very good sugar cookie...but I don't think it lived up to its name in my opinion.  Everyone liked it (most people like macadamia nuts), but I wasn't crazy about them.  I am not big on white chocolate, however, so maybe I shouldn't be the judge.  I think next time I will try this cookie with dried pineapple or 1 cup of coconut instead of the white chocolate.

Okay - but I must say -- someone must have had " bad hanky panky " because these taste too sweet, and similar to a sugar cookie --- I'd try a different recipe next time ---- dont waste your money on all the ingredients .

Good cookie, easy to make and form the cookie but they required cooking for 14 minutes in my oven as at 9 they were still doughy. Bake time on this should be taken as a start time, not total time if you are a first time baker.

I was babysitting this little girl this week and we decided we wanted to do a lemonade stand. So, I went online and chose this recipe (of course withholding the name of it) They came out perfectly and smelled like heaven. Better than sex? I think not. But delicious, nevertheless. However, a little too sweet for my taste. I'll probably cut back on the sugar next time.

This is the first cookie recipe I ever made.  Very simple, and a crowd pleaser.  Also makes A LOT.  They have still disappeared every time.  This recipe has been a holiday staple for me since I was in high school!

I just made these cookies-I followed what others said to make it alittle higher than flat cookie because it spreads. Also they were not done at 9 min. I think 10 min. is better and close to a 375 oven. First batch at 9 min. was doughy. They are good cookies if baked correctly. But better than sex???? I'm divorced-not sure about that one!

Cookies are wonderful, but I baked mine a little longer than 9 minutes, I felt when I removed them from the oven at nine minutes they didn't harden enough... MMM MMM MMM Good

These came out excellent!  They have a very nice texture, but watch out, they spred out a LOT when you're cooking them.  I added a bit more macadamia nuts, any cookie taste better with more nuts

My family agrees that this is a great cookie.  I have made them twice already and will be making them again and again.

I've made this recipe many, many times. And although I don't eat nuts my husband and friends do. They all LOVE this recipe. That's plenty good enough recommendation for me to make them again and again and again. I have and will continue to so.

The BF loved these cookies.  I have made many batches of macadamia nut/whilte chocolate cookies and these are the best ever.  I had been converting toll house cookie recipes with mixed success.  thanks for sharing this.

These cookies are so yummy! I made them for my family and they absolutely loved them. My dad said that he has had many cookies in his day, but these are by far the best he has ever tasted! They are the best when they are soft.

These are awful cookies.  The cookies are still raw after baking only nine minutes.  When cooled, they spread out like peanut brittle (and have the same texture).  Stay away from these cookies.

I really thought these cookies were good. VERY sweet, but also very good. I too made them for a going away party at work and everyone absolutely loved them!

Well, they're not better than, but awfully close!!  These cookies rock!  But do cook them for only 9 minutes, even though they don't look done - they will be soft and chewy if you do.  Cook them longer for crispy cookies.
