I followed the recipe exactly but I just didn't like this dish. To me it tasted like a bunch of different flavors that didn't really go with each other all thrown together. The cayenne pepper was too strong and overwhelmed the dish.

I scaled this to a serving size for two - One for dinner and one for lunch The next day. Problem This was so delicious I almost wanted to eat the second serving! Thank you so much for sharing it - I didn't change anything it was perfect!!!

I too followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed. Cayenne pepper was too strong! Didn't like it enough to try again with reduced pepper - not a keeper.

This is one of my family’s favorite recipes. I serve it over a bed of angel hair pasta. Along with the sun dried tomatoes and peppers I also sauté in the same skillet some smoked beef sausage and sliced onion.

Made exactly as written cayenne pepper overwhelmed the dish. If I try again I will use about 1/4 of the pepper. BUT loved the Romano cheese
