These are by far the best cut out sugar cookies I have ever made.  The only change I made was using the 4 teaspoons of baking powder in place of the cream of tartar and baking soda. I let the dough set Fridge overnight. I too rolled the cookies between 2 sheets of parchment paper (you could use wax paper) and only had to use a dusting of powder on the paper and on the dough and had no trouble at all with the cut outs sticking or the dough being too sticky(?). Baked them for 7 minutes.....no longer. They were perfect.  This is my new sugar cookie recipe that I am sure I will use forever.

This recipe is perfect.  I only did two things different.  I did not have cream of tartar so I did not use that, but I did use baking powder as someone suggested.  I also only let them chill for an hour instead of all night (only because the kids were anxious to make them.)  We used an icing off this site and together it worked perfect.  This was definately a wonderful sugar cookie!!  (Also, it was exactly 8 minutes to make them just right!! )  I also used real butter instead of margarine!

Perfect Christmas cutouts!  You can use 4 teaspoons of baking powder instead of the baking soda and cream of tarter.  Turned out great!

Very nice sugar cookies!  I used butter instead of margarine and didn't chill them at all.  Had no trouble rolling them out and cutting them with cookie cutters, and they baked up beautifully.  I've never made successful sugar cookies before, but these were perfect.  I rolled the cookies fairly thin since I knew they would puff up a bit, so I ended up getting more than 6 dozen heart shaped cookies.  Very popular at work and with my family.  Thanks for this one!!

a friend of mine made the best sugar cookies over xmas, they were soft and chewy throughout even when slightly burnt around the edges.  inspired, i chose a few recipes off this website hoping to recreate that.  unfortunately, my first attempt with "Michelle's Soft Sugar Cookies" was not even close.  the dough smelled and tasted great, but the final cookies were 75% hard and 25% soft in the center, only when they were still warm.  by next morning they were completely hard!  :(  they also have a thick texture and are not what i consider light.  i may attempt this recipe again, maybe adding a little milk and baking for shorter time. i'll post another review if i do try this again.  in the meantime, i'm giving "Soft Christmas Cookies" and "Sugar Cookies VII" a try.  look for reviews there soon.

This is the most perfect soft sugar cookie recipe I have found, and I have tried a LOT.  The dough is perfectly firm and not too wet.  It is super easy to cut out and they are soft, but not crumbly.  I baked them for 8 minutes exactly.  They do need frosting - and frosting them is the best part!

The only difference I did was chill the dough in the freezer for an hour.  This is probably the worst cookie recipe I've come across. After testing one batch, the rest went in the trash.
The dough is way too gooey for rolling--even after adding a lot of flour.  The cookie itself tastes like a bland pancake (I think due to the 3 eggs).  DON'T TRY THIS COOKIE!

I hated making rolled sugar cookies until I tried this recipe.  The dough is very easy to work with and the results are great!  These taste like the soft sugar cookies one can order from a well-known gourmet cookie company.

I was searching for a dependable recipe to use as a give away at a wedding shower I hosted.  I read all the reviews (as always) and used this recipe to make heart shape cut out which I decorated with royal icing in the wedding colors.  On one cookie I put bride and groom's names, on another the wedding date.  After the icing firmed I put them back to back in a little cellophane bag and tied with ribbon to match.  They looked lovely in a basket by the door, and the bride gave a bag to each guest as they left. Cheap and Cheerful!  Thats the ticket!

Best from-scratch sugar cookies I've ever made, and easy too! I thought that three eggs might be too much before I made these cookies, but I decided to follow the recipe and it wasn't too much at all. The only change I made was to substitute 4 tsp. baking powder for the baking soda and cream of tartar. They turned out wonderful!   A tip: If you bake cookies on an insulated cookie sheet, you can't tell if they're done by looking at the top of them. I always take my cookies out of the oven and carefully slide a small spatula underneath one cookie. When the bottoms are a light golden brown, the cookies are done! Don't wait for the tops to turn golden or they'll be overcooked with an insulated cookie sheet!

Oh. My. Cookies! This was not only the best cookie I have ever made, it was the best one I have ever tasted, and yes that includes professional bakeries! This dough was so simple to make (I didn't make any changes except used real butter b/c that's what I had), easy to work with, baked up perfectly. They aren't too soft or too hard, taste amazing, and hold up so well! I made mine a bit thicker than some, probably, and had to cook them about 10 minutes instead of 8.

Throw out every other sugar cookie recipe you have ever used. This is the only one you'll need.

BTW, this is also the first and only review I've ever posted on allrecipes!

I used butter instead of margarine because it was what I had in the house. Mine turned out crunchy because of the butter but still tasted great. Also, I roll out the dough between two pieces of either wax paper or parchment paper right after making it and stack the rolled out cookie dough on a cookie sheet and place in the freezer for a short time. Once the dough is chilled, just pull off one piece of the paper and cut cookies.

I usually prefer a crispier cut out sugar cookie, and have found most soft ones bland and without flavor, BUT, this recipe was awesome! I used real butter, and along with the 1 tsp. vanilla, I added 1 tsp. almond extract. They were delicious, and my son and I had fun frosting and decorating them for Christmas. I did not have parchment paper, but the new "Easy Slide" foil by Reynolds Wrap worked great! These cookies go great with a big glass of cold milk! Santa will sure appreciate these! Thanks Michelle! Merry Christmas!!!......Mrs.Sigg

Amazing cookies! I followed the recipe exactly, using margarine, cream of tartar and chilling overnight (actually, it was two nights since I got busy and had to delay baking them). I rolled the dough out between two sheets of parchment paper with just the smallest sprinkling of flour on the bottom sheet. This prevents too much flour from getting incorporated into the dough and changing the texture. They truly are soft and delicious.

Very, very good. They baked up nicely, but didn't stay as soft as I had hoped. I used 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon almond for a nice, smooth flavor. The dough was super easy to roll and cut out after chilling overnight. Thanks!

This is my 2nd time making homemade sugar cookies and they came out delicous!  They came out light and fluffy yet crispy enough.  My sister and I baked cookies for our family for Christmas and the next day we decorated them! Instead of margarine we used butter and it still worked out well.  Awesome recipe for novice cookie bakers!

What a great sugar cookie recipe. I used this dough to make 'Melted Snowmen cookies' which were a fun treat for the holidays. This dough easily presses to make the base for the cookie, and the taste of the cookie was awesome.

I thought these turned out good. They were definitely soft which I was going for. In order to not go crazy with the sticky dough I ended up dividing the dough and keeping it in the freezer. As I grabbed each softball sized dough ball to roll out I would add a bunch of flour as I kneeded it and then it rolled out easier. The flavor was fine but I'm still on the hunt for a good glaze or icing.

Perfection, if you decrease the amount of flour a bit. These rolled out very nicely and stayed in the exact shape of the cookie cutters, no spreading. I used snowflake cutters with fairly intricate design and they were beautiful. Of course, they taste even better than they look. My new favorite sugar cookie recipe.

When I chose to try this recipe it was because it was supposedly a cut out recipe. Well it sat for 24 hours but still stuck to everything. I will not use this one again.

An extremely dependable recipe! I made these exactly as the recipe suggested. I could not make these right away, so these were in my fridge wrapped in cling wrap for a little over 1 week. But still no harm done. You don't need to thaw out the dough to wrok with it after fridging it 'coz then it will get sticky again. I made larger cookies, as I used these to make Mr. Melty the Snowman. Do remember these cookies do grow so don't make them too large ... medium sized one's will give you a reasonable size. These took me approx 15 minutes to bake. Also they're wonderful as is with no frosting at all. The snowmen and the non frosted ones went on my Holiday trays this year! Thanks for the recipe MISSMR94 :)

Never really understood the appeal of sugar cookies, but Oh, MY! These cookies were delicious. They taste just like the cookies that we buy from a local bakery @ $1.00 per cookie. Delicious and so easy to make. I did let them chill overnight like the recipe said. YUMMO!

These turned out great!  I did not chill overnight or use cream of tartar. I rolled into balls and flatterned with a glass bottom dipped in sprinkles.   Yum!  This morning I will add Hershey Kisses to the middles for an even more delightfully soft cookie.  Thanks for this recipe!

These sugar cookies were pretty good. Instead of making them into cutouts I wanted round soft cookies. So I did not refrigerate the cookie dough at all and just rolled them into balls, rolled them in sugar and slightly flattened them with the bottom of a glass to about 3/8" on the cookie sheet. They were easy to roll, not sticky on my hands and baked up perfectly at 8 mins. They definitely needed the icing, which I used plain old store bought vanilla. The cookies stayed soft in an airtight container overnight which is a good sign. The only thing I would do differently next time is use plain white flour as I used whole wheat flour. I think they would have tasted better with white but whole wheat is all I had on hand. My husband thought they were great so maybe I'm just being critical.

Great recipe. I substituted 2 sticks of smart balance for the margarine as that's all I had. Otherwise I followed the instructions exactly. After refrigerating the dough overnight, I had no problems rolling it out. I rolled between two pieces of parchment paper and had no issues with the dough being too sticky. This recipe made tons of soft, delicious sugar cookies. I will make it again!

Let me start by saying that I regularly make sugar cookies... I have made them for years and people always love them.  I had tried several different recipes and didn't find one that just blew me away, until now!  This sugar cookie recipe is wonderful!  I will stick with only using this recipe in the future.  I made two changes... As another reviewer suggested, I used 4 tsp of baking powder instead of the baking soda and cream of tartar.  Also, I added 3/4 tsp of almond extract.

I also used this recipe to make the Melted Snowman Cookies on staceysweetshop blog.  I agree the cookies had good taste and texture.  However, I too would not have been able to roll the dough as written.

Really easy to make, I put them in the freezer for 25 minutes and kept "recycling" and refrigerating the dough with no problems.  I did 7 minutes at 350 and they were perfect.  Now I just have to frost them!

This was, by far, the BEST sugar cookie recipe I've ever tried! I don't like margarine so I used butter, and I also cut out the soda and cream of tartar in favor of 4 tsp. baking powder. Baked for 7 minutes exactly and they were soft and delicious! I made heart shaped cookies for my daughter's Kindergarten Valentine's party, and the kids kept asking for more! 
** If you have a problem with the dough sticking, try butter instead of margarine. The butterfat firms perfectly once it's refrigerated long enough, and will roll out very well.  If you had a problem with the dough being too firm, you've used too much flour. Try weighing your flour instead of measuring- it's much more accurate, and will fix the texture for you. You can get weight/volume conversions with a simple internet search! 
Thanks, Michelle, for a perfect cookie!

Great sugar cookie! After trying another recipe for sugar cookies that left me with sand like dough, I found this recipe and decided to give it a go.  I followed the review of others and substituted cream or tarter and baking soda for 4 tsp of baking powder.  I don't cook with margarine, so i used butter instead.  Since I was testing these for flavor with the first attempt, I didn't chill and just dropped large spoonfuls on my baking sheets right after mixing all ingredients.  I baked at 400 degrees for 10 min, as I was using double insulated baking sheets.  They came out perfect! Slight crunch on the outside and a nice soft center.  Thank you!

These were wonderful.  I refrigerated my dough over night and it rolled beautifully the next day.  These were good with either buttercream icing or royal icing.

I love this recipe. I didn't have patience to chill them, so I rolled out the dough between two pieces of Parchment Paper, dipped the cookie cutter's in sugar before cutting and worked as fast as I could to get them on the prepared baking sheets. Worked like a charm and they are yummy! Thanks Michelle

Wow!  The most perfect cut out recipe I have ever tried.

I have never had a cut out recipe be so easy to roll.

I used butter instead of margarine, because it's all I had on hand.

My husband likes the taste of the cookie unfrosted!  

Will use this one as an exclusive for all my holiday cut outs.

Thanks so much Michelle!!!
It's five-star all the way!

My mom had always talked about a recipe for sugar cookies from "way back when". The only specific thing she could remember that made them different was the addition of cream of tartar, but she was never able to find that recipe. When I stumbled upon this recipe I decided to try it and surprise my mom with the cookies. It worked, these were perfect. They bake up very well and they stay extremely soft, which is exactly how we like our sugar cookies. I haven't tried rolling & cutting them yet, but I think it's a very safe assumption they would do well with that too.

Yummy as is. Followed the recipe except not having the tartar I took other advice and used powder in place of it and the soda. Just out of the oven now and I think they taste great even before the frosting. Oh yah I forgot I added just maybe a tea or tablespoon of lemon juice as well. Will definitely be  my go to sugar cookie. THANKS!!

Stop whatever you're doing and make these cookies immediately. They are that good. I used butter instead of margarine, other than that, made the recipe exactly as written.
Amazing soft sugar cookie, stayed soft for at least 4 days.

These were good, but I don't know had an odd after taste for me. I used butter, and I also only used 1 tsp cream of tarter and 2 tsp powder instead of the soda.  Could it be that? It was also a very sticky dough, even after I let it chill.

By far, the best sugar cookies I have made.  The only change I made was to decrease the cream of tartar to 1 teaspoon.  The dough rolled perfectly, the cookies baked beautifully and stayed soft for days.  They were perfect to make decorated Valentine's Day cookies for my kids!

Great! I put  2 eggs instead of 3, butter, 2 teaspoon of baking powder instead of cream of tartar and vanilla flavor. I don't chill at all, great  and easy recipe. Be careful, they bake very quick. Best recipe ever.

So I tried this recipe and they came out pretty good! They werent as soft as I would  have expected  but still good. I suggest a lower temp for the oven.... Does anyone know what the difference in using cream of tartar vs. baking powder is?

Fabulous recipe!  I substituted butter for the margerine and 4 tsp. baking powder for the baking soda/cream of tartar.  I chilled the dough for 30 minutes in the fridge and 10 in the freezer.  The cookies turned out GREAT!  Plus, my kids rolled the dough and used cookie cutters to cut shapes...the dough was man-handled to say the least!  The kids even rolled little eyes and mouths for the little "angel" cookies they made and even with all that, the cookies turned out GREAT!

Prefect! I followed the recipie exactly. My cookies took 8mins to be golden on the bottom. I used tin foil sheets instead of the paper. No problems at all. Kept the dough in the fridge for just a couple hours, not over night. Will use this recipe over and over!

These turned out great. I followed the recipe, except like others, I subbed the baking soda and cream of tartar for 4 tsp. baking powder. I made my cookies quite thick, and 7-8 minutes in a 350 oven was plenty. The dough was not sticky at all, I chilled it overnight and rolled it out between sheets of waxed paper. I baked them on parchment paper, as the sugar could stick to a plain sheet. Mine were in Christmas tree shapes, and they did puff up, but not so much that you couldn't recognize the shapes. Overall, I'm very impressed and will definitely use this as my go-to sugar cookie recipe!
Thank you Michelle!!!

These are the best sugar cookies! Although the second batch I made I messed up, in the first batch I did as antoher member recomended and put in 4 teaspoons of BAKING POWDER, the second time I made the recipe I was in a rush and put in 4 teaspoons of baking soda and ended up with bitter pinecones! Yuk! I gave these out as gifts for christmas to all my friends and got rave reviews! For frosting try mixing 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar with one egg white and add water 1 tbs at a time until desired consistency, then turn cookies face down and dip them in the frosting, cookies turn out beautiful! Thanks Michelle!

These are the softest, greatest sugar cookies I have ever had. Make sure you only bake them until the edges are JUST turning brown or they won't be as soft. This recipe also works GREAT for a fruit pizza crust!

Every Christmas I use a different recipe...and they always turn out too hard...but this year...SUCCESS!!  The dough was so easy to work with that I felt like a pro!  Let it sit over night in the fridge and you will be rewarded with great workable dough!  I didn't have any margarine, so I used butter, and I didn't have any cream of tartar, but they still turned great.  I can't say enough!  Some further advice, don't roll the dough too thin, and don't overcook, and they will be soft!  I'm so excited about this recipe that I am baking more tomorrow!  Thanks, Michelle!!

Even after refrigerating the dough, it was still too soft to work with, so I added more flour when rolling them out.  Mine turned out really flat and almost too soft.

the only problem i had with this recipe is i had a very hard time using cookie cutters without the dough sticking to everything, i floured everything very generously and it didn't make a difference.the cookies did not come out to the shapes we wanted but the cookies were very tasty anyways and the kids had a good time decorating them.

These are the best sugar cookies I have ever tasted. The only thing I did different was use Cisco shortening instead of butter I like it better in cookies than butter.
Definitely try this recipe you will be very happy with it.

Good soft cookies But too salty for me. I followed this recipe as stated only used unsalted butter instead of margarine. Next time I will only use 1/4 teaspoon of salt. These cookies don't need that much salt.

This dough produced cookies that tasted amazing but failed to be a viable option for cut-out cookies as the dough was FAR too sticky to do anything with...even AFTER chilling overnight!!  My young daughters were so disappointed not to make cut-outs this year.  I will be looking for another recipe that will produce the soft cut-out cookies that we desire.

So dissapointed. I could not roll it out and it didn't smell like sugar cookie dough I'm used to. It turned soft  really fast that it started getting very sticky when rolling. I had to re-chill it then cut but that did not work either. I couldn't get 1 single cut out!

These SOFT sugar cookies are excellent and very easy to make.  My son, who is 4&1/2, and I,  made them together using many different shaped cutters and sizes.  It was very easy to do and very good to eat!  We used butter instead of margarine and we did not have time to chill the dough overnight, but we did chill the dough for about 5 hours and it was perfect.  The more that you chill the dough, the easier it will be for cutting the shapes.  The only thing that I would recommend and do the next time, is to make sure that you do not roll the dough any smaller than a 1/4inch thick.  We used some cutters that were small and if the cookies were not real thick, the did get harder that the ones that were rolled to 1/4inch or more.  THESE COOKIES ARE EXCELLENT AND VERY EASY!  I WILL BE USING THE RECIPE AGAIN IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  We made a butter cream frosting for them, which I am not a frosting fan, so half of them I made into cut out Snickerdoodles and they were excellent also.  All I did was toss the cut out shapes of dough, carefully in a sugar/cinnamon mixture before baking.  They were terrific!  Whichever way you make them, chill the dough, cut out to a good measurement, and do NOT overcook and everyone will be very happy and impressed.  I was impressed, for sure, especially how easy they were working with a young child.  HE HAD A BLAST!!!! THANKS FOR THE SHARE, MICHELLE!!!!

These cookies were delicious and very soft, but they were nearly impossible to work with.  I followed the recipe exactly, but even after chilling the dough for 24 hours it was too sticky to roll and cut with cutters.  It was even very difficult to roll it in balls because it all just stuck to my hands.

These are soft cookies, a little dense and bland, but since they are sugar cookies and tend to be decorated, they were good for the Melted Snowman cookies a friend and I made with her 2 1/2 year old.  I made the dough several days ahead of time, and it rose in the fridge, so if I make it again that far ahead I'd probably freeze it.  It was a bit comical trying to get it to fit back in my container every day!  We didn't really shape these into anything except imperfect blobs (on purpose for those snowman cookies) so I can't speak to the ease of rolling out the dough.  It was a very simple, easy dough that baked up well enough.  thanks for the recipe!

These were soft and chewy. I did not roll out and use cookie cutters. I used a pampered chef scoop and made circles. I decorated with prebought decorators frosting.

The cookies taste good, the dough is easy to work with. I made it just as stated but used real butter instead of margarine. I only gave it 3 stars because I as looking for SOFT sugar cookies. Mine came out far from soft. They are crisp just like the other sugar cookie recipe I had... I tried rolling them out thicker, still not soft.   Maybe it had to do with using real butter. I am not sure. Anyway they taste good, but I am still on the look out for a SOFT sugar cookie.

This is the first time making homemade sugar cookies, I was scared but they were so easy! I followed the mixing directions to a "t".  The dough sat for about 4 hours in the refrigerator. I did have to adjust cooking time due to using two different kinds of cookie sheets. My stoneware pan required me to bake them for 8-9 minutes. My dark non-stick baking sheet required me to bake for 5-6 minutes. I will forever use this sugar cookie recipe!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because it was gooey stuck to my fingers and I couldn't roll it out at all. So I struggled with it (huge mess) and rolled in my palm into balls. Baked as directed and they were perfectly round and rose very well, the taste was very good! I just didn't get a dough I could actually roll out and cut shapes from. Otherwise the taste and texture after baking was very good.

I loved the flavor of these cookies, however, I could not roll the dough out at all! It had the consistency of a thick cake batter.

I did not have cream of tartar so used baking powder as others suggested.  I did let it rest overnight in the refridgerator, however the dough was still very sticky.  I was able to handshape some cookies and they were quite tasty, but could never get it where I could roll and cut the cookies.

Pretty difficult dough but well worth it. I divided the dough into 4 balls so i could leave some chilling and switch off as soon as one dough started to melt. The final product was soft, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness. I used a frosting and red crystals on top.  I loved this recipe enough to bake it with a stick and pass it out as party favors. The cookie pops were delicate but delicious and stayed fine after leaving it out for a couple of days in my hot and huimid climate.

These cookies are very tasty, but the dough is very sticky. I was forming these cookies by hand (for melted snowman cookies), but would not have been able to roll out/cut this recipe as written.

These cookies tasted good, but they were a bit too oily for my liking.  I used rather large cookie cutters and they expanded to be much larger than expected.

The dough was really sticky prior to putting in the refrigerator.  I left it there for about an hour and the dough was perfect for drop cookies.  I'm not sure they would ever work for rolled cookies.  Cooked for about 8 minutes and they were perfect soft cake-like cookies.  Best sugar cookies I've ever made!!  Better than the kind you buy at the market.

BEST sugar cookie recipe ever. I make lots of cookies and people order them and I make some extra money. Never did sugar cookies cause I always had a problem with them not rolling out nice. Now I do sugar cookies with this recipe. It rolls out smoothly cuts nice and comes out soft. If it was possible I would rate it a 100*. Thank you for great recipe

I used baking powder instead of the baking soda + tartar and used butter instead of margarine. I also did not have any vanilla extract and couldn't go buy any because it was Christmas, so I just added a couple dashes of cinnamon. I kept them in the freezer for a few hours and then tried to roll them out b/w wax paper, but it was a sticky mess. Instead, I just rolled them out and transferred them to the baking pan. Regardless, the cookies turned out excellent and very soft. You definitely have to cut them thick, it's easier to transfer and they end up tasting very soft and delicious. Also, the kids loved decorating these and they were all gone the same day!

The best EVER!!! I had my same sugar cookie recipe for awhile, until now!! I made these for Easter and they were so good. Very soft and even a batch that stayed in for a little too long (by accident!!) had a slight crunch on the outside but the inside remained soft! The flavor was wonderful. This is defenitely my new rollout recipe from now on!!

Made some great easter/passover/pagan-spring cookies with this recipe. Nice, simple, and light. I had no problems. I used butter instead of margarine and sprayed some aluminum foil with PAM in lieu of parchment paper. Baked for 7 minutes exactly and used the fantastic "sugar cookie frosting" recipe that is perfect - not too sweet - on top. I also stuck in the freezer for about 45 minutes and then the fridge for an hour, which worked just fine. My only recommendation would be to take down the flour slightly, since I ended up using quite a bit when rolling out. Got about three dozen using fairly simple cookie cutters about 3 inches. Didn't find the puffing too bad, but I also rolled thinner than 1/4 inch.

The dough tasted wonderfull but not the greatest recipe for cut out cookies. Takes a ton of flour to get anywhere. For drop cookies I would recomend this but definatly not for cut outs.

Made cookies exactly by recipe. Could not cut out without 3 or 4 handfuls of flour mixed in, then the cookies were too dry and flour tasting. I even tried taking dough out of the fridge one spoonful at a time. Didn't work! Now I'm doing it drop style by the tablespoon and I've had them in the oven for a half hour and they're still not done. TOO STICKY!!!

I just made this recipe for St. Paddy's Day today.  I made cutout Shamrock Cookies.  This dough rolls out easiest if it is kept cold so just take out a small amount at a time from the refrigerator.  I made the dough as directed and refrigerated it overnight.  I will never use another sugar cookie recipe.  These are the best tasting and softest sugar cookies ever.  Thank you Michelle for such a great recipe!

well i dont really know what went wrong...but these did not want to be cut out cookies. They did everything in their power to stick to the cookie cutter and after I won the rare battle of actually getting them out, they sought revenge by blobbing out while in the oven, bloating their cute little christmas tree selves into puffy pinecone-looking things. They tasted ok, though. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. mmmmm pinecones....

Excellent recipe! This is what I've been looking for after several disasters with other recipes for sugar cookies. I added 1/2 c more flour since I find the flour here (Spain) is different from what I use in the states and all my USA recipes need a bit more flour here.  Rolled dough between wax paper, they cut out super easy and kept their shape while baking.  No more "mystery blob" cookies! Ü Tried out my new EXOPAT nonstick baking sheet and it worked like magic. No sticking and no greasing a pan. These even held up to 9 children (ages 5-10)frosting them at a cookie decorating party. Thank you, Michelle, for sharing it with us!

I make 3 batches of cookies every year and this was a new one this year.  The dough is WAY too sticky to work with after being out for more than 5 minutes.  The cookies are okay once you fight with the dough, but I have tried many other better sugar cookie recipes.  These are more cakey than crunchy, so if that's what you like than these will be a good choice for you.

These were the best sugar cookies i have ever made!  They are still soft a week after making them.  I agree using 4 teaspoons of baking powder works great instead of using cream of tartar and baking soda.  A little sticky, but rolling them in between 2 sheets of wax paper really helps!  Excellent recipe!

I should have reviewed this a long time ago as I make these all the time and EVERYONE loves them! I use butter instead of margarine and Cake and Pastry flour instead of all purpose. I double the vanilla. The dough goes in the fridge for an hour or so then gets rolled out thick and cut in to circles. Underbake them...8 min tops. Ice them with a buttercream...amazing. So soft, and they taste like a cupcake in cookie form! These don't make great shaped cut outs but thats ok. You can just decorate basic shapes like circles with cool sprinkles and candy. AWESOME cookies!

These cookies kept me a temp job! Like another reviewer, I used 4 tsp baking powder instead of cream of tartar and baking soda. I roll them out nice and thick, and they back up like pillowy dreams. Everybody where I worked - a professional bakery's office! - LOVED these. I brought them to every holiday party and I think it had more than a little to do with the place keeping me around longer than other temps. This is my go-to sugar cookie recipe now. Love them!

I used butter in place of the margarine.  The first time I used this recipe, I pulled the dough out of the refrigerator after it chilled overnight.  It was difficult to get out of the bowl.  Then once it warmed up it was pretty sticky.  Once I dusted the dough with flour, it rolled out nicely.  Today I divided the dough into thirds.  I am hoping that will make it easier to handle and roll out.  These are super yummy with the Sugar Cookie Frosting Recipe( I used almond extract in place of the vanilla in the frosting recipe). Rave reviews!

I did not care for this recipe. When I took this dough out of the refrigerator after 12 hours and the dough was still too soft to really make good shapes.  I had to make a large number of cookies and made 2 batches of this dough, boy was that a mistake!  And then the cookies tasted almost like a snicker doodle. Maybe if I had used butter and no cream of tarter they would have been better.

This was the 1st "from scratch" recipe I tried for sugar cookies. They came out just the way I'd hoped they would. A little crunchy around the rims, but soft and light in the middle after cooling & even next day. YUM. This is a keeper recipe! Thank you for sharing. Most simple recipe and quite quick too. I only added 1 1/4 cups of sugar as I knew I'd like the cookies to be less sweet cause there would be icing and lots of other kid friendly decorations. If you follow instructions to a T, they do come out very soft, not all crumbly and hard. I baked cookies for about 6 minutes, and turned the sheet pan around so it was evenly cooked.  Just my preference.

I thought these cookies were not sweet enough and left a bad aftertaste after eating. I didn't have the cream of tartar so I used the extra baking soda as others suggested. I had to use extra icing to get them to taste sweet. I will not be making these again. If you like your sugar cookie not sweet, but soft then these are for you.

These cookies are delicious! Definitely the softest sugar cookie I have ever had...used them as cutouts and brushed with milk and added sprinkles for a delicious Christmas treat! Thanks for the recipe...I'll use it for years to come :)

I am surprised by all of the rave reviews of this recipe.  First, I agree with other reviewers that the dough is very sticky and difficult to work with unless you use a lot of flour while rolling which makes the cookies dry and taste like flour.  I should have tried rolling it between parchment paper as other reviewers suggested so that is my fault.  The texture of the finished product is good but the cookies expand quite a bit and didn't work with some of my more intricate cookie cutters.  Lastly, I agree with other reviewers that the cookies have a strange aftertaste due to the cream of tartar.  I had a cup of tea after eating two cookies and I can still taste the sour/bitter aftertaste of the cream of tartar.  I assume the amount of cream of tartar is what helps give the cookies more volume so one would have to experiment with using less.  I did like the fact that the cookies were not too sweet which is good if you are going to use icing.  I will have to experiment with this recipe.

I made these cookies with margarine. maybe they would be better with real butter, but i did not have a good experience with this recipe. the dough was too soft to roll, kept sticking to the rolling pin. i finally gave up and dropped tablespoons of the dough onto cookie sheets and attempted to flatten them with the bottom of a buttered glass dipped into sugar, and they were still too soft and doughy and stuck to the glass!! the first batch i did at 375 for 10 min were too doughy. the next batch that went into the oven i left in for 12 minutes, and they were soft yet done. i had trouble with them sticking to the silpat when i removed them from the cookie sheet so the bottoms were kinda rough. but they tasted okay. no way i could have made cut out cookies with  this recipe though.

These cookies came out amazing. I read the reviews and seen that some people said they were a bit to salty so I just did my usual pinch of salt in the recipe and I used orange extract instead if vanilla, it gives it a hint of orange flavor. Super yummy. I will def be making these in the future, they taste just like the store bought cookies

I made these cookies recently for a school project with my son's class.  I made them using the baking powder and they have a great taste.  Something about the taste of cream of tartar.  The class loved the cookies and I will be making more of these this christmas.

Just finished making these with my kids to give as gifts for the holidays.They turned out wonderfully!! This recipe will be replacing the one I've used for the last 10 years.The only change I made was adding a bit more flour to make the dough a little thicker but otherwise they were great!!! Be sure to only bake for 8 minutes! Can't wait to decorate them!!

Great cookies!  Soft and delicious.  I used them for a very large flower cookie mold to make cookie pops for a party and these worked the best after trying 4-5 recipes.  Texture wise they were the best in the mold and they tasted great too.  I had to of course dec. the temp. and inc. the time due to the large cookie.  (about 2 oz of dough per cookie took 10-12 minutes at 325 degrees).  My oven cooks a bit hot though.

These cookie are the best sugar cookies I have ever eaten! I made them for valentines and my kids and husband could not stop eating them. I used the other suggestion of using  4 t.  of baking powder instead of cream of tarter and It gave it that little tang I have been missing from other sugar cookies. Just make sure you refrigerate the dough other wise it is hard to cut the cookies out. Great recipe thanks for sharing!!

These cookies were wonderful! I loved how soft they were (and they stayed that way even a few days after I had baked them!). I had leftover cream cheese frosting form a cake I made and topped my cookies with it and that took the cookies to a whole new level

These are the best sugar cookies I've ever made. For some reason I can mess most sugar cookie recipes up but this one was fool proof. Not only was it the easiest to make, it has the absolute best taste! I highly reccommend this recipe. Everything was perfect from texture when rolled out, to cutting, to flavor! My daughter took them to school for her Christmas party and they were a big hit. Thank you for a great recipe that has been added to my collection!

Used real butter and vanilla. Turned out really good. Didn't refridge over night, but put in freezer for 45 min. and ready to roll.  A big hit.

These turned out great!  I took others advice & used the baking powder instead of cream of tartar.  Put in fridge over nite & rolled out & cut cookies, which I used poweder sugar to roll out somewhat thick.  They were big & soft & perfect!  Its a keeper for sure!

This recipe was one of the best from this site! My husband loves them! The only thing I added was almond extract (which I add to all of my sugar cookie recipe's)The dough was still quite a bit sticky even after being in the fridge all night and all day while i was at work. So i only did 1/2 cut outs and the other half I rolled into flat ball shapes. They came out great! Soft and Yummy! This recipe is exactly what I want in a sugar cookie!

This is my second making of this recipe. I wanted to make it twice before I reviewed/rated it.
The first time,once completely mixed together, it was a VERY moist batter, resembling a cake batter in thickness and it was not easy to form into logs, wrap in wax paper and chill overnight. But I got it done. The actually chilled it for 2 nights. I rolled it between waxed paper to 1/4" thick and baked for 7 mins. These cookies are GREAT!! I make some plain for coffee and some I sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon like Snickerdoodles. Everyone loved them!
Make sure and flour your cookie cutter and also do not roll too thin and do not overbake! 
It really is a 5 Star but rated it 4 Star because it is a bit difficult to work with :)
This is now my families Sugar Cookie Recipe!

Thanks~
Yvonne

This is a great reicpe.  I added 1/3 cup of sour cream, used butter rather than margarine and left out the cream of tartar.  They're soft, fluffy cookies perfect for cut outs AND they taste great even without frosting!

This recipe is great.  I've made it a bunch of times - you can use butter as well.  Key is not to bake too long.  Take them out before they begin to brown and they'll be nice and soft.

First of all, I used butter instead of margarine, added about a quarter more sugar, and I only used 3 cups of flour  and liberally doused the rolling pin and board with flour. I did this because I don't like overly flour-y cookies that taste like bread.  
Secondly these cookies are not soft, at least not in the sense I like them to be, these were more chewy. Thirdly, they don't "puff up"  as others stated- they spread a lot. This makes them kinda iffy for cutout shapes, although they were kinda flat if thats your thing. If they had puffed up and were not chewy, which is what I look for in a soft sugar cookie, I would've given them a 5. 
But besides all those things, they really tasted great! So very yummy with 'creamy cream cheese frosting'. They also were easy to make, and did not require the overnight chill, an hour  or two will do.
If you REALLY want a soft, puffy sugar cookie, try a sour cream recipe, and/or use cake flour which is very fine. Or you can try this recipe with shortening instead of butter or margarine, which cause more spread and thus a chewier or crispy cookie. I would love if someone came up with  an easy recipe like this that truly was good for soft sugar cookies!

These were quite good cookies, though I think I'd like them to be just a bit sweeter. I added extra vanilla, then ended up putting colored sugar crystals on top just to sweeten them up...otherwise I think they'd need a really sweet frosting. I followed other reviewers' advice and only refrigerated for an hour. I saved some dough over night, but found it was actually easier to work with after just an hour of cooling. They are quite soft, though a little dry. Thanks, will probably make again.

What a great recipe!  I read a bunch of the reviews and some of the complaints, but I had incredible success with this recipe.  

They do puff up a little bit, but I didn't lose any of my holiday-themed shapes when I made them.  I didn't chill the dough overnight, just in the freezer for an hour and a half or so, and I had no problems rolling them out.  (And I'm not terribly talented at the rolling out!)

Two thumbs way, way up for these cookies--they are easy and delicious!

I'll stop looking for the perfect sugar cookie now! These were perfectly flavourful and soft. My only complaint is that the first batch (and only the first batch, oddly enough) puffed up so much that some of the shapes were unrecognizable (and those just became the sacrificial cookies that my husband "tested" before baking the rest).

Growing up, my grandma made the BEST sugar cookies.  Before she passed, her memory faded and she could no longer remember how she made them.  I have spent years trying to find a recipe similar, and I believe my quest is finally over.  For me, these are the most delicious sugar cookies EVER.  Just like my grandma used to make.  THANK YOU, Michelle!

These were fine, but not the best I have had from this site.  I like the recipe for Easy Sugar Cookies better for flavor, although these are probably better for softness.

It has taken me 15 years and THIS RECIPE to undo the teasing I get from my in-laws over bad sugar cookies ("hockey pucks") I made for my husband when we were dating.  These cookies are fabulous and very easy to make.  Several people asked me for the recipe at a recent family dinner!

This is a good sugar cookie recipe, everyone that has them really likes the flavor.  The only drawback is that while they looked beautifully puffed and fat in the oven, they deflate slighly as they cool.  Also because they puff a little they kind of balloon out of any cookie-cutter shape you might have used and they look a little distorted after they cook.  However, they all got eaten so fast it was hard to feel too bad about it.

A pretty good cookie as far as sugar cookies go.  My only recommendation is to experiment a bit with the flavorings and to put the cookies a good distance apart before cooking - they puff up a bit more than I am used to.

I made these cookies cookies and dropped them by the tablespoon and didn't chill them either.  Still delicious and cooked perfectly!  If dropping, you must flatten a bit or cook for longer-I cooked these at 350(my pans are a bit dark).  There was nothing wrong with them, but they were a regular sugar cookie, still soft and great with icing on top.  Enjoy!

These were some of the best sugar cookies I have ever made.  Will definately be making them again real soon.  I didn't roll them out and make cut outs, I used them as drop cookies and just decorated them with a few sprinkles.  The best!!

MOST IMPORTANTLY...this only made 1/2 the amount of cookies that it claims in the recipe!  I also did not use cream of tarter or baking soda.  I used 3 teaspoons baking powder.  I also used real butter.  Definately only cook for 7 minutes!  Eight minutes made them much too crunchy.

I made these for Christmas and all my family and I really like them. You definately have to roll out only a little dough at a time, though, because it does get sticky pretty quickly, and it also helps to put it in the freezer. I frosted the cookies, but they really didn't even need that. These are very good cookies.

I've had trouble over the years finding a sugar cookie recipe that my family was pleased with.  This is by far the best I've tried.  The only modifications I made were butter for margarine and only 1/4 teaspoon of salt because of the butter.  Excellent taste, easy to make, and make beautiful cut outs.  Thanks!

Good soft cookie recipe!  I chilled the dough for a full 24 hours and they were easy to roll and cut out.  I added cinnamon to the batter and next time will add maybe a bit more vanilla.

These were the absolute best sugar cookies I have ever had.  They were so easy to make too.  When ever I told anyone that I was doing cut-out cookies this year for Christmas, they said that cut-outs are hard to get right.  But I mixed up two batches of these and let the dough sit in the refrigerator overnight.  The next day I rolled them out and baked both batches during my daughter's 2 hour nap.  They came out beautiful and they were delicious!

Thank you for this great holiday cookie recipe. My family & I, give it "Two Thumbs Up" rating.
However, the directions do not indicate when to add the vanilla extract.

I've tried to make sugar cookies last Christmas and NOBODY liked them. But these? These cookies were soo good, by Christmas evening they were all gone! I only made a dozen b/c the dough was very frustrating... it was sticky! I had to put lots of flour. The cookies came out puffy but then they started to go down a little. They were moist and delicious. I made my own icing with 2 cups of powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons of water and a teaspoon of vanilla. I colored it with food coloring and placed the icing in plastic baggies and snipped an opening in the corner, just like a pastry tube. I put the dough between two sheets of wax paper to make the rolling part easier. They were so pretty and so good! Other than the stickiness, these cookies were the bomb!

These cookies were the best sugar cookies I've made.  I sold several dozen of these over the Christmas holiday plus made several dozen for us to eat.  I like to use almond extract instead of vanilla.  They got rave reviews. I got the icing recipes off of this site and they were great with these cookies.

I love this recipe! I have been looking for a good sugar cookie recipe for a long time now! I am very picky about the taste and texture of cookies- and this recipe was a hit!

I used the sugar cookie frosting recomended by another user which is:
Sugar Cookie Frosting, 
submitted by Kathy Brandt.

These were really tasty! I made them today with the Sugar Cookie Frosting off this site, and I am sick to my tummy from all the warm cookies!  My husband prefers his mother's hard cookies more, but he is also sick next to me!  Great recipe!  I will definetly make again.  I also tried it with the nutmeg and it gave it a nice seasonal taste.

The cookies turned out very soft, but the batter was hard to work with, very sticky, I had to add a lot of flour to work with it.  I will make this recipe again, the taste and texture is very good.

I have been searching for a cut-out cookie that had a good flavor without the frosting -- these cookies are the best. They are a good basic cut-out cookie and they taste great even before all the frosting!

Great sugar cookie recipe! The only thing I changed was using butter instead of margarine, I don’t use margarine for anything.These cookies always come out perfect!

Best sugar cookies I have ever made, but what a process! I lose interest about halfway through, and never end up refrigerating the dough for as long as the recipe recommends. Still, if you have the patience, these are fantastic!

I love this recipe, not super sweet yet still tastes like a cookie. I made it with butter and baking powder like the other comments.  I left it in the fridge for two days and still tasted good. The dough gets really soft quickly,  so work fast. I found the best method was to freeze the dough in flattened logs, spray the cookie cutter with nonstick cooking spray then dip the cutter in powdered sugar.  I put powdered sugar on waxed paper and on top of the dough. Rolled it out under another piece of waxed paper. I also put my rolling pin in the freezer. Baked at 350 for 11 minutes

I was looking for sugar cookies that was slightly softer and a little sweeter than my go to recipe that I use with icing and sugars.  I did a small change to the recipe of using 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine. I have to say, these were divine! Please know that the dough does get soft very quickly so work in small batches, returning the the scraps to the fridge. I also had the oven temp at 350 and backed for 10 mins on a foil lined baking sheet.  They were perfect and thank you for sharing the recipe!  I will happily add this to my collection.

Best light, fluffy, buttery. I substitute sweet cream butter for margarine. Cover and chill overnight. Roll out 1/4" thick and bake for 10 min only with pre-heated oven.

Great recipe and taste great!  Follow recipe EXACTLY and it will turn out!  Tips: I added a tbsp of cinniman for extra flavour, and when you roll them out, roll them between two pieces of parcement paper - I did not cool dough overnight!  Great recipe to share and kids and I love decorating them.

This is my go to sugar cookie recipe.  I chill the dough for a couple of hours and have never had a problem with rolling it out.  I cut them thick and they come out soft and stay soft.  I frost them with buttercream frosting.  This is a five star recipe as written.

These are amazing. Like others I didn't have cream of tarter so I substituted. And baking them @ 375 for 7 min was perfect. I definatly will be using this over and over. Even my husband who is very picky when it comes to cookies (they have to be soft) loves these. Even now 6 days later after i made my first batch the cookies are still soft.

Worst cut-out recipe I have ever tried.  I followed the directions to a T and even added additional flour when it never formed into a dough.  I figured maybe after a night in the fridge that's what it was supposed to do? NO.  I took it out the next morning and couldn't even use it.  So disappointing.

I used real butter and no problems with the dough sticking.  Also, I used a tip from a previous rater--use poweder sugar when rolling out the dough.  The cookies were GREAT!  One of the best sugar cookie recipes I've tried so far.  I will be making these again.

These are great! dough is very sticky, even after putting in the fridge 24 hrs so I just made round ones. I think they would be too difficult to cut with cutters.

I was sceptic to use this recipe cuz my boyfriend was looking for sugar cookies that were "chewy" so to speak, but yet not like the store bought cookies. I used an icing recipe, edited to be thick,  to frost them.  No complaints from him and the rest of the family so, I am now going to  give this recipe a spot in my recipe box to use from now on. I'm sure it will be a family favorite for Christmas and other holidays, along with general baking.

Once cooked, these cookies had an AMAZING melt-in your mouth texture.  But, like other reviewers, mine were nearly impossible to work with.  I used the allrecipes serving calculator (above the ingredients list) to double the recipe.  Then I made the recipe exactly as written.  The dough was almost soupy.  I double checked to make sure I hadn't left anything out or not added enough of something.  I thought maybe it just needed to chill, so I left it in the refrigerator overnight.  The next morning it was workable only if I sprayed my hands with olive oil before rolling the balls.  Even then, a lot of the dough stuck to my hands.  I currently have the dough in the freezer to see if that will help.

I didn't like this recipe at all!  It was too soft and sticky to roll out.  I even tried adding more flour and sugar and it was still way to soft and sticky to even come close to rolling it out.  I just made them as drop cookies and they are in the oven so we'll see how they taste.  But I will never use these for cut outs again!

Amazing! Made them exactly as the recipe says, and even let my 6 and 8 year old help!  Great recipe for getting the kiddos involved!  We taste tested before making the frosting, and so yummy.  Made the frosting and the kids actually said they were better without.  Definitely hanging onto and sharing this recipe.

awesome cookie!!! easy to make, but make sure you do refrigerate the dough at least an hour or they will be hard to cut out. topped with cream cheese icing, everyone loved these.

I made the mistake of trying a different soft sugar cookie recipe last night - instead of this one. What a mistake! Michelle's are much softer and lighter, with a fantatic texture and light flavour doesn't over power the lemon icing I use. in addition, I found these very easy to roll out and cut! From now on I will always use this recipe.

I was in a hurry so I was not able to chill for more than 10 minutes, and also didn't have time to roll them out so here is what I did... First off, I NEVER use margarine for anything!  So I used equal amount of butter.  Made the dough, put in fridge for 10 min.  Rolled balls in my hand of about 1 TBSP size and dropped in sugar and rolled them in sugar.  They are very soft at this point.  Baked them for 9 min @ 375.  They came out so soft & Great tasting!  It made about 60 cookies also.

Not sweet enough, took too long to cook and burned the bottoms. I tried it twice, but both times, it failed.

These sugar cookies are excellent.  I have made these at least 10 times.  The first time I made them, I had no issues with dough consistency.  However, every time after my first attempt, I have needed to add 2 extra cups of flour to get it to a roll-able consistency. (I'm not sure why this suddenly became a problem)  

When I add the extra flour, they are great.  I don't need to chill them or anything before rolling.  

I get all sorts of compliments from everyone when I make these, so I'll continue to use this recipe and just remember to add extra flour.

I didn't have any parchment paper, but it didn't seem to make a difference, as I had no problem taking them off of the cookie sheet. Made at Christmas time & frosted them with a buttercream frosting. Very good & moist.

These cookies were great. I did put them in the fridge overnight and with a little flour was able to roll them on my kitchen table. My whole family loves them and we decorated them with Betty Crocker's cookie icing in the pouches. Made it easy for the kids

The dough is very deceiving.  It is perfect for rolling out and has a beautiful texture.  Once you bake the dough, it loses ALL flavor.  These cookies taste terrible!  Kind of like cornbread with no cornmeal or flattened unsweetened cupcakes.

These cookies are good, but could definitely be softer.  And I wouldn't eat them without icing on them (I just mixed butter, icing sugar, vanilla and canned milk)  If you're going to eat them without icing, I would definitely reccommend sprinkling sugar on top before putting them in the oven! I didn't refridgerate over night, I just put them in the fridge for an hour, and they were super easy to roll out!  I'm not sure if I will make them again, I think I'll go back to cream cheese sugar cookies for the texture :)

I *really* liked the texture of these cookies.  They were very soft and the dough was very easy to work with once it was chilled.  However, I thought the taste left a lot to be desired (perhaps because it uses margarine instead of butter?).  In my opinion, a good sugar cookie doesn't necessarily need any icing and we often enjoy sugar cookies without any adornment.  This cookie cannot be eaten on its own -- it definitely needs some icing.  A blah cookie on its own, but a very nice, soft base for frosting!

I have been looking for the perfect SOFT sugar cookie recipe and this is definitely it!  I did roll them out extra thick and was careful not to overcook them.  They held their shape and turned out perfect!  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These were very good, but you need frosting on them. Very plain without. I didn't cut them out as noted, but made them into drop cookies. Half the batch were made into snickerdoodles and the other half plain. I'll make this again, but experiment with the addition of different flavors.

I baked these cookies this month and they turned out great.  The dough was easy to handle, when I used cookie cutters they retained their shape very well, and the cookies remained soft and moist.  I will definitely keep this recipe.

These cookies sound like they'll be great when baked, however after two attempts I have given up. The dough is just entirely too "gooey" to work with. I couldn't even roll it out, much less take cookie cutters to it. I consider myself pretty seasoned in baking, but nothing I could do made this dough managable. Maybe a few adjustments on the measurements would help. Maybe it was operator error but I just didn't have any luck.

Made these on a snow day! Cut the recipe down to a third (20 servings), used baking powder instead of baking sode/cream of tarter. Only chilled for about an hour.  Came out wonderfully! Will need to play with the cook time a little, but I made mine thick! I will definately be making them again!!

These were so soft and chewy; I loved them.  I cut out thick circles and put a dab of sweetened cream cheese and strawberry jam in the center, rolled the cookie around it, put it in a muffin pan, then iced with cream cheese frosting when they were done.  So delicious!

This is the same recipe as Cut-Out Cookies in a Flower Pot but with cream of tartar instead of baking powder. I made both recipes and I liked the texture of these more. They were lighter, but still were very sturdy and easy to frost.

My entire extended family thanks you for these cookies!  My grandfather is the master at rolled thin, crispy decorated Christmas cookies.  So much so that the rest of us have given up trying to get them anywhere near as thin!  This recipe gave me a great way to supplement his instead of try to duplicate them.

Overall the final product here is fantastic. My husband said it was the best cutout cookie he's ever had. My dough was still very sticky after chilling overnight so I had to use A LOT of flour to roll them out, but my persisetnce was rewarded. (It could be the humidity here too, it snowed about 4 inches today.) I only use a few basic shapes, and they did puff quite a bit, but the taste is so worth it! I bet they'd be great with a little almond extract rather than the vanilla too! Enjoy!

We did not care for this recipe.  They were not SWEET!

I don't know who was more upset, me or my girfriend (after I took a bite, I told her how I felt about it).  Add at least another 1/2 cup of sugar if you are brave enough to try these.  Because of this recipe, it is no longer my favorite cookie.

These are really great cookies!  The dough seems to be too gooey when I make them, so I always have to add about 3/4 cup extra flour, and they turn out perfect every time!

If you're looking for the best tasting cut-out cookie recipe, look no further.  I used butter because I didn't have any margarine, and they were exactly what I was looking for.  Make sure you refrigerate them for a while.  I did for about 2 hours and they could have gone longer (the recipe says overnight, but I couldn't wait).  These cookies are soft, they puff up a little bit, and they taste great.  I could eat them plain but you sort of have to frost Christmas cookies!

my fav sugar cookie recipe, the dough works better very cold! Don't use too much dusting flour or it creates a dry crust layer on bottoms of cookies

Absolutely fabulous cookie! Definitley worth 5 stars. These are even wonderful unfrosted. They got a little puffy, but held their shape well. This is our favorite sugar cookie from here so far (and I have tried too many to count). This made a lot of cookies, almost 5 dozen. Thanks Michelle, they are as great as you said!!!

great recipe! The cookies came out soft and delicious, and made the whole house smell wonderful. The dough rolled out perfectly and I barely needed more than a slight dusting of flour to get it rolled uniformly thin and smooth... cut-outs held shape during baking, too! One of the best sugar cookie recipes I've tried, and is now my "go-to" recipe whenever I get a craving.

These have become my fail-safe recipe. These cookies are soft, moist, and totally tasty. I frost them with a throw-together recipe of milk, powdered sugar and cream cheese (and a bit of almond or lemon extract). Everyone loves them, every one wants the recipe, and they travel well and make excellent little gifts.

These cookies were excellent! I didn't use them for cut-outs. Instead, I rolled them into balls and rolled them in sugar. I baked them at 350 for 10 minutes and they stayed soft and chewy. I will definately make these again! Thanks!

Michelle...I don't know who you are but you FANTASTIC!  I LOOOVE this recipe!  I made some awesome Valentine's Day cookies for a bake sale at work (to raise money for charity) and I got a request to make 3 DOZEN more!  I doubled the recipe (as well as added a little extra flour) and it was perfect :)  Thanks Michelle!

This is the recipe I have been searching for!!!  This recipe allowed me to make the best Christmas cookies I have ever made!!  They rolled perfectly after chilling overnight.  They baked beautifully.  Great texture and of course taste!! I followed the recipe as directed except used almond extract in place of vanilla extract.  Superb!!

Yum.yum, yum.  Today is cookie making day for the holidays.  Each aunt and uncle get a cookie plate and needed a new sugar cookie recipe for them.  Glad that I choose this one.  I used cookie cuters....my only problem is that they spread just a little more than I would have liked.  Delicious though...and I am sure they will be loved.  Thanks for the recipe.

We had to add extra flour to make the dough workable even after having been refrigerated over night. That probably decreased the softness of the cookies but overall they were a good choice.

This is a wonderful recipe! I used the whipped vanilla icing and put them in the freezer. They were wonderful! I would suggest 7 minutes instead of 8 if you like them soft. I thought 8 minutes got them a little crunchy for my liking!

The cookies are really good! If you intend to let your kids cut them out, when you put the dough in to chill, put small portions in seperate bowls... so you can pull them out as needed. when this dough is soft it is harder to work with.

5 STARS ALL THE WAY.  DO make this cookie.  Not sure why some people are having problems with it, but I have been using this recipe for the past year and have NEVER had a problem.  You can even add different flavoring.  It will not disappoint!

Instead of using margarine for this recipe, I used an equal amount of the  limited edition Country Crock spread. The  seasonal spread adds a little flavor, and reduces calories. Per Tablespoon, the Country Crock has 40 calories fewer than margarine, so that may help some of you :)
The cookies still came out light and fluffy, just keep an eye on them in the oven!

These were totally wonderful, especialy with whipped frosting on top, thanks Michelle!

These cookies were super great.  They were so soft, and the flavor of the cookie was sweet, but not overpowering.  We cut them out for Christmas, and put cream cheese frosting on them.  I couldn't stop eating them! :)

These are good as cut out cookies but not the best 'sugar cookies'.  We made them both ways - cut out and just rolled into balls.  Instead of refrigerating overnight, I put bowl in freezer for about 15-20 min.  I am still looking for the 'hands down best soft sugar cookie' ever!!

Great taste, but mine weren't that soft...probably something I did...Anyway, the dough was tough to work with, way too sticky and got warm too fast. I wasn't able to roll it out and use cutters so I made drop cookies instead (flattened them a little). Those came out well. I would make them again, but only as drop cookies.

Cookie tastes good.  Dough was very soft and difficult for kids to roll out and cut.

This dough was beautiful at first but became very difficult to work with. It is not easy to rework and roll out. Even after freezing I had mostly gooey stuff. My cute cookie cutters could not be used. I give three stars because the cookies still tasted amazing. And yes, 375 for 7 minutes.

These taste just like my mom’s did!  The first batch I rolled more on the thin side & they were a little crispy for me, after that I rolled them more to 1/4” and those were perfect!  I let them chill overnight, and kneaded the dough until it was warmer and pliable (3-4x) to make it easier to roll.  When I was rolling, I rolled on silicone mat covered with flour.  For the icing, I used 2 c confectioners sugar, 3T (plus or minus, to get the consistency I wanted, it seemed thick at first but settled well) and 1/2 tsp lemon extract, which you could barely taste, but gave a nice tartness and contrast to the yummy cookie!

This is the best sugar cookie recipe as we make these every year!! I think the Cream of Tarter is essential to the flavor of these cookies. My mom has used this recipe since the 70’s.. We always top it with Betty Crocker’s Buttercream frosting. Much requested every year from family and friends. Parchment paper helps keep them from crumbling on the bottom. Not over baking is vital!! No more than 8 min, until edges are just starting to turn a very light brown. Oh, and use BUTTER!!

These are great, soft sugar cookies.  Just what I was looking for. They puffed a little more than I expected, so I recut them after they came out of the oven with the cookie cutter (bonus trim pieces for eating right away) and they were perfect.

these were super good and awesomely fluffy. I didn't roll them out I treated them like drop cookies or chocolate chip cookies and on one set I dropped them with a spoon, they turned out awesome, and a second time I called them like chocolate chip cookies and pressed them down with my fingers a bit and they turned out pretty great. I've even food colored them and they were awesome.

I've made countless batches of sugar cookies but never really settled on a recipe I wanted to stick with. After a couple minor tweaks this is going to be my go-to recipe from now on - I used half butter and half shortening and added about a half teaspoon of almond extract. I also lowered the baking temp to 350 and adjusted the time needed based on the size of my cookies. I like to take mine out when they just start turning golden brown on the bottom and then let them rest on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes. They came out absolutely perfect this way - soft and chewy! I used most of the dough as a base for fruit pizza and it turned out amazing - for fruit pizza, you really need a soft cookie and this recipe works great. The only thing I will say is that I definitely had to refrigerate the dough before attempting to do cut outs and it did spread a tad more than I would have liked but that was probably because I didn't have time to let it chill long enough.

I made some changes that were recommended by others:
 - Substituted butter for margarine (prefer using butter)
 - Used 4 tsp baking powder in lieu of the baking soda and cream of tartar (no cream of tartar)
 - Put in freezer for 1 hour (am impatient)
They still turned out great. Some things I found:
 - Freezer did a good job of chilling if you're also impatient
 - 8 min is the perfect amount of time to bake
 - They aren't overly sweet, but very light

I found this recipe a few years ago when searching for a soft sugar cookie recipe. Since making them that first time for Christmas, it has been my go-to sugar cookie recipe. They are wonderful. The only thing I change is I use butter because I don't use margarine in anything.  The dough seems tough to work with after chilled, but quickly becomes manageable. I have shared these with friends, family, and co-workers over time and always get rave reviews.

These cookies turned out amazing! I used 4 teaspoons of baking powder instead of the cream of tartar and baking soda, like on reviewer said. I had to bake mine for 10 - 11 minutes instead of 6 - 8 minutes because I made my cookies much larger. I made about 3 batches with this, with 6 cookies in each batch. I would definitely make these again.

Great recipe! The amounts were perfect for a great cookie dough. They came out perfectly sweet and soft too. I bake them for exactly 6 minutes and make sure I don't roll them too thin. 1/4 inch or a bit less is good and they come out nice. I finish them with coloured icing and they're soft and nice for a good while! They're not rich in the way of soft and doughy though, like the kinds made with vanilla pudding but are a great cookie anyway. Don't overbake or they'll be hard.

I bake a lot all year round I have used this recipe for 2 Christmas's. I use it to the letter others then the margarine, I use 1/2 cup of vegetable shorting and 1/2 cup butter.  We have a large family and trust when I say they all love this Cookie! I make about 6  batches I have to hide them deep in a freezer or there will be none left. This is one of the best cookies for using  cookie cutters try to leave them 1/4 inch they stay softer and moist less then 1/4 they make a nice crisp cookie and have a nice snap.

These cookies were very easy to make.. however, even after being chilled, they were very sticky and difficult to roll out but that wasn't a big issue and I made it work... they cooked up nicely.. look delicious and perfect colour etc... BUT all I can taste is egg... I have since gone back and reviewed other sugar cookie recipes and this is the only one that calls for 3 eggs.. this taste has ruined the cookies so I do not recommend making this at all..

I love this recipe and make these every Christmas to hand out!! Every person who has tried one loves them too!! 
When I have finished making the dough, I roll it into a log in wax or parchment paper then put it into the fridge at night. The next evening I take my 2 very large cookie logs out and slice them and bake them. Perfect to decorate as tree ornaments!! :)

I was very disappointed in this recipe. Even after overnight refrigeration, the cut-outs would not hold their shape even for me to place them on the pan. The few that did survive the cut-out process expanded too much in the oven. I had to use a cookie scoop on the remainder of the dough. The finished cookies tasted like something between biscuits and breakfast cereal.

These cookies were incredible!  I've tried many recipes on here, but, for some reason, the baked goods are always hit or miss.  Not these!  They were so easy to make, and they came out soft, tasty and just amazing.  Everyone loved them.  My elderly neighbor even asked for the recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to use butter (unsalted) instead of margarine.  I don't really like margarine and didn't have any on hand.  Marvelous!  Oh and I didn' thave any cream of tartar so I just used more baking soda.

This is a great recipe.  I bake a lot and had no trouble with these cookies at all.  I did substitute butter for the margarine (just personal preference).  I made the dough in the evening and baked them the following morning.  I was worried the dough might be very stiff after being chilled 6 hours, but it was great to work with.  I doubled the recipe and used a 4'" heart shaped cookie cutter.  I ended up with 47 cookies.  They are very soft and the taste is great.  I will be using this recipe often.  Thank You!

I tried this for the first time yesterday and it came out great! But I made a few changes. First I took out the cream of tarter ( but DID NOT ADD MORE BAKING SODA TO COMPENSATE) it will taste too much like baking soda if you do! I also added 1 tsp of butter extract in addition to the 1 tsp of vanilla. They were awesome!

I followed the recipe. But instead of using cream of tartar, I used powdered candy canes! Yumm. They turned out great. Oh and I also used self rising flour instead of all purpose to make the dough rise faster.

This dough worked up perfectly! It is a very forgiving recipe! I did chill it over night but I could of rolled it out as soon as I was done mixing! I did however use salted butter vs margarine so maybe that had something to do with it.

Awesome cookie recipe.  Just for a change I added mace.  I use mace for my pound cake also gives a unique taste.  Lemon ride would be great also.  Endless possibilities.  Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe but you really do need to refrigerate over night.  I tried to rush it once and the dough was too soft.  If directions are followed then it comes out perfect.

These recipe was great.  Usaully sugar cookies end up thin.  These were good and think! I made the dough then was going to let it set over night, but ended up with the flu.  They sat for 3 days before I felt like making them.  They were wonderful.  The kids LOVED them.

The dough is not a firm dough to roll. I found it was best to roll on wax paper sprinkled with flour. Good recipe though! I've been looking for a good soft sugar cookie for years. I will be making these again.

I love this recipe. You don't have to chill it, which is great - though I do add sme flour to firm it up. I also use 3 tsp. of baking powder instead of the cream of tartar and soda.

I used this recipe to make a base for Strawberry Sugar Cookie Pizza. I baked these cookies in mini heart shaped pans, so the outer crust looks pretty hard in my picture but the cookie itself is soft and delicious inside! Leaves a lovely aftertaste as well. I have to say, this recipe worked perfectly for this particular purpose - which is why I am giving it 5 stars. I will definitely be using this recipe for my strawberry dessert pizzas in the future! But not for a general sugar cookie fix because it didn't stay as soft as I would like it to be if I was just frosting it. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I was disappointed in the outcome of these cookies. The first time I made a batch, I used butter instead of margarine and didn't use cream of tarter because I didn't have any. The dough seemed very soft after being chilled for 8 hours+. I ended up throwing the bath away instead of baking cookies. The second time around I grab the wrong recipe out of my recipe box and made these cookies again... I used margarine and cream of tarter this time and again the cookies were way too soft. I followed the recipe to the T and am confused to how this recipe could have gotten so many good reviews. I wasn't able to roll them out after chilling and ended up having to make drop cookies. The end result was nothing exceptional and I won't make them again. And I am only giving 1 star because I have to in order to post. :-(

I've made this recipe several times and they always come out moist and tasty.  I've made them as rolled sugar cookies.  I've also rolled the dough into balls and rolled in either rainbow sprinkles or cinnamon sugar (so they're like snickerdoodles).  Every time I made them my friends and family couldn't stop eating them.  For those who had trouble rolling them out - I place the dough between 2 sheets of saran wrap and roll flat and then put it in the fridge/freezer for an hour or so before cutting them. This always works for me.

I made these per the instructions.  These cookies are soft, but that's not to be confused with chewy and moist.  They are dry and devoid of flavor, and the texture is like I used biscuit mix to make cookie dough.  There is no way you will be able to use this recipe for rolled cookies (too sticky, even after overnight in the fridge).  I made drop cookies with it and baked about 7 minutes (they were  dry, so I can't imagine what it would do to a cut-out cookie!)

These cookies were soft.  But they looked inedible.  The batter spread out so much I could only put 4 cookies per sheet.  Good taste if you could get past the appearance.

Only giving this 4 stars because this is not a roll out dough.  Cookie flavor is 5 star all the way!  Cookie itself is very good - light and fluffy, but no way is this a roll out dough.  I don't know how much more flour or powdered sugar would be needed to get this to a roll out consistency.  Ended up making drop cookies with this recipe and the cookies were very light and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness.  I didn't feel that icing was necessary, but the kids really wanted to decorate "Easter" cookies.  The texture of these cookies is almost the same as the frosted cookies you can find at Walmart or other grocery stores.  Even though they wondered why they weren't egg or bunny shaped, everybody loved the cookie!

It took over 20 years to find a sugar cookie recipe that tastes like Grandmas. This recipe is excellent. The only substitution would be butter for margarine.

Love these cookies!  They have become our standby when we want to make cut-outs.  Ona  apersonal note, we like them lightly frosted (I mix up a frosting, melt it slightly in the microwave and brush it on lightly) then add sprinkles or other decoration.

The cookies tasted very good. My hubby enjoyed them.  The dough was very sticky so I froze it for an hour and than placed it in the fridge overnight.  Just one more thing dip the cookie cutter in flour before cutting the cookie out.

Most definitely the softest sugar cookies I've ever had! Some of my cookies browned(if over baked-forgot about this batch) and they were still soft. I'd definitely try again, maybe with a tad more sugar & vanilla extract.

These are great!!!  I followed the suggestions of not using cream of tartar just using extra Baking Soda and rolled them out EXTRA thick as they do spread out during baking.  Baked for only 7 min, and they were just like the picture thick and soft in the middle.  I started used my tart pastry cutter for the first ones.  Mistake they were to large and flat, I used a pint glass.  Just right!!  Will make these again.

These cookies get five stars for taste! They're delicious.  But the dough is NOT fun to work with. Especially when you're not having a good day.  I should have baked the first batch before mixing up a second batch of dough.  I chilled the dough for over 18 hours.  It was still very sticky and needed more flour.  Shapes don't hold up very well either--they puff up so much that you can barely tell the difference between a star and a bell.

I didn't like that the dough was too sticky. I kept it in the refrigerator for two days and it still turned out sticky. Maybe I did something wrong. It also needed a little more sugar. But other then that it turned out good. I will try this recipe again.

I have tried many sugar cookie recipes and this one is one of the better ones.  I gave it only four stars because I had to add more flour and some of my cookies were a little dry.  I do think playing with the thickness and time in the oven could cure this but the ones that stayed soft also broke very easy.  They are very tasty though and look beautiful with the sugar cookie icing from this site!

We tweaked the recipe to fit the ingredients we had at home, and my kids LOVED them!  We looked up substitutions on cream of tartar since that isn't something we keep on hand, and found that 4 tsp. of lemon juice = 2 tsp. of cream of tartar.  We also used lemon extract rather than vanilla and did 1/2 c. margarine, 1/2 c. of shortening since we only had one stick of margarine in the fridge.  They were great!  Just a hint of lemon flavor (not overpowering at all).  This is now my standard Sugar Cookie recipe.  Way to go, Michelle!

I made these with the sugar cookie glaze from this site for a church activity and had so many people tell me they were the best sugar cookies they've ever had.  I rolled it out on powdered sugar instead of flour, though, to add a bit of sweetness and keep them chewy and moist.

My family loves these cookies. I'm hoping to get a chance to frost some today before they eat them all. Dough was a little sticky when trying to roll but a little flour fixed that. My daughter said to keep the recipe!
Thanks!!

These were pretty good. I made pumpkin cut-outs for Halloween and my colleagues all said they were fantastic. However, I thought they left a funny after-taste in the mouth. Maybe it was the shortening or the baking soda.

These are very good cookies and the only reason why i am not giving them 5 starts is because they puff up a little and dont keep their shape very well. I made Halloween cutouts today and my cats ended up looking a little bit like round blobs...... BUT, they tasted awesome so it wasnt that big of a deal. I used cream cheese frosting to frost them and they were very yummy!

These are soft, moist, delicious sugar cookies.  This is now the recipe that I make for baby/bridal showers, holidays, or just whenever we feel like making cookies at home.  They taste great alone, but we prefer them with frosting.

I love these cookies.  I let them set in the fridge for 2 hours before I just had to bake some.  I cut out a pan full and ate them all myself.  I let the remainder of the dough stay in the fridge overnight.  The rest of the cookies will be baked, frosted and taken to my son who loves sugar cookies.

These didn't come out quite like I expected, but they were okay.  It's been a long time, probably about 10 years, since I've tried to make sugar cookies with cutters, so maybe part of my issue was lack of experience with the rolling pin and cutters, but the dough was too pliable even after being chilled for 2 days. I had to use lots of flour on the counter and on the rolling pin and even then they were difficult to handle.  The flavor of the dough was great, but by the time I used so much flour to get them cut out, once they were baked they were definately bland and a little too crumbly for my taste.  Definately a good cookie to frost though.  I'm sure most of my issues were user error, maybe I'll get it right next time!

I am in the middle of making these cookies and i'm not impressed by the results. I used cookie cutters, and the cookies are coming out all puffed out and i can't even tell my "bells" from the "trees" they just look like triangular blobs! The taste is just OK, and the texture is fairly crumbly and soft. I wouldn't recommend these for cutters or for icing since they are so tender.

These are the BEST sugar cookies.  My boys cannot get enough!  I took the recommendations of others and substituted Baking Powder for the Soda and Cream of Tartar.  I also cooked at 350 degrees for exactly seven minutes, and they were PERFECT when they cooled.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe is great for cut out cookies.  Sweet but not too sweet, so when you put that yummy, sweet, frosting on them, theyre just right!  This is a keeper recipe, lots of fun for the kids(my kids LOVED every bit of them!).  :-)

This is exactly what I've been searching for!  A soft, yet stable not too sweet sugar cookie.  Reminds me of my hometown german bakeries [cincinnati].  We frosted with a simple icing and made extras for the fire dept!  Perfectly easy if you make the dough in advance as advised!

These came out PERFECT!  I used mini cutters and large cutters, and when I baked them on the same cookie sheet they came beautifully.  My husband ate the whole batch in 2 days.  great dipped in morning coffee for breakfast, or with milk.  They hold shape nicely while dunking.  My kids loved these!!!  Thank you for this great recipe.

This makes a fantastic cookie! The dough is esy to work with and the cookies stay soft long after they come out of the oven. I'm not a fan of using cookie cutters, so instead, I rolled 1-inch balls of dough in sugar, placed them on the cookie sheet, and flattened them with a glass. With buttercream frosting, these will be appearing in my cookie jar often! Thanks Michelle!

I love this recipe!  I did have to add some more flour before I refrigerated them, but other than that, they were perfect.  I made cut outs with the dough and frosted them; they were out of this world.  Thanks, Michelle!

These came out fantastic! So moist and soft, and not to sweet. My 5 year old helped me make them.  We cut them out into shapes and put cream cheese frosting on top with sprinkles. Yummy, thanks for the recipe.

These taste great, and were easy to roll out. They don't last for very long though

Altho I dont have parchment paper and living in a small town its not likely I'll get it either, this was a fabulous recipe. My kids loved the cookies as did my SO. I like to see a great tasting cookie using the "basics". I will definatly use this one many times!
