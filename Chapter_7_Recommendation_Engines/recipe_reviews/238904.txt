Being an admitted amateur cook I have my own recipe but decided to look around as I do to get ideas. Brown sugar caught my eye and I tried it with fresh cut cilantro, mushroom and dried onions in the meat then  butter honey crushed croutons in the ketchup,A1,mustard, brown sugar in the sauce. 
Best ever hands down ...EVER! 
I did not use too much brown sugar and the cilantro made a fresh very fresh taste. 
I never post on stuff like this but felt compelled.
Excellent

First of all, I would skip the chili powder altogether. It just didn't belong. I would probably add a little cayenne for a little kick. Secondly I would put the salt in the meat and not in the sauce.  The meat was bland and the sauce was salty. I would also scale back a little on the brown sugar perhaps to 1/3 of a cup.

Instead of chili powder I used 1 teaspoon of oregano, 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 2 teaspoons of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of paprika. It made this recipe all that much yummier

This was as good, basic recipe.  This is a great recipe for someone who is reserved about trying something new.  Very tasty, very easy and I got good results from the family members that tried it that refuse to try anything new.

Easy and delicious!   It got rave reviews from everyone that tried it.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I used breadcrumbs instead of crushed croutons because that was what I had on hand.  The meatloaf was moist and the glaze was delicious.

I ran out of ketchup, so I sub’d Heinz Chili Sauce which I prefer on meatloaf anyway.  I used garlic & butter croutons which added great flavor.  In the future, I would cut back the salt; 1-1/2 tsp was WAY too much for our tastes.  Although I typically like things less sweet these days, I did enjoy the glaze, the meatloaf was plenty moist, and this will make good sandwiches, too.

The only change was I did not have any croutons, so I used Panko Bread Crumbs.  I have now made this at least a dozen times. I love it, my husband loves it.  Our comfort food along with Whipped Potatoes and steamed Vegetables.  I always make a little extra sauce to have for Meatloaf sandwiches the next day.

Very good...my change in the recipe is a replacement of the chili powder  for dry mustard.  This gives a flavorful twist w/o the heat.

The family loved it and said it was the best meatloaf ever! I doubled the recipe and made a few minor changes.  Didn't have the croutons so I used 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 Quaker Oats. Also, I added the chili powder to the meat and not in the glaze/sauce. Lastly, I baked it in a preheated cast iron skillet.  It came out  nice and browned on the outside and very moist on the inside. Found the perfect meatloaf recipe.

This is my go-to favorite recipe whenever I make meatloaf for dinner. I always like to add a couple extra ingredients to the mix - trial and error. I have gotten better at making meatloaf every time, especially with the ketchup glaze, which tastes AMAZING!!!!

Loved it.  Just a few changes... added finely chopped mushrooms and sautéed them with the onion prior to adding them to the ground beef.  Also added a packed of Lipton soup mix for flavoring.  Instead of salt, I added soy sauce to the topping.  Came out great.

It was good. I made a few changes to make things easier. For the sauce, all I did was 2 tablespoons of Brown sugar and 1/3 cup of ketchup. That's it, and it was great! I found that recipe a long time ago and won't do any other now. Also, I put the salt in the meatloaf, and used crackers instead of croutons. It turned out great

I left out the chili powder and substituted 3 - 4 tablespoons of Minced Onion instead of the small chopped onion and it is now a family favorite!   I make it at least  every other week.

Switched out 1 1/2 C. breadcrumbs for croutons, and dry mustard for chili powder per some suggestions, but other than that, didn't change anything... recipe was AWESOME!  First time in a long time I actually looked forward to leftovers the next day!  Cheers.

Love this recipe. I have found my one and only meatloaf. It is flavorful, easy to make and not dense at all. The croutons add a touch of oil, seasoning and body that stands up to the beef. I love ketchup with my meatloaf but this adds a great kick of extra flavor. Yum!!

I didn’t use the milk and I added a 1/2 tsp of mustard to the glacé. My family
 absolutely loved this meatloaf and I would highly recommend it to anyone . I was a little skeptical about brown sugar in a meatloaf but it was a definite hit for my family and trust me when I say this because I usually end up making 2 of everything because some like some ingredients and then a few won’t but this one.. they all loved.

Overall good but would definitely reduce the amount of sugar in the sauce unless you want it sweet and sugary.

The next time I will use less brown sugar, it seemed overly sweet. May even try more of a beef gravy rather than a sauce.

Made this the first time true to the recipe, and it was delicious. Only negative was that the glaze was a little too sweet, but that may be due to my using brown sugar Splenda vs. brown sugar. I’d probably cut that back by 25% and then it’s perfect.

Did not have croutons on hand so used 1 cup bread crumbs & added 2 tsp Italian seasoning & 1/2 tsp granulated garlic powder to enhance bread crumb flavor. Turned out well. I will make it again.

First time I ever made meatloaf. This recipe was very simple to put together and absolutely delicious! I kept tin foil on top while it cooked to keep it moist and I'm glad I did. My husband loves it!

This was my very first attempt at making a meatloaf and this recipe is great!  I found it very sweet so would likely cut back a little on the brown sugar next time.  I used gluten free breadcrumbs instead of croutons because we can't have gluten.  I also used only egg white to cut the calories.  I'm also tempted to try making it with ground chicken because I think it could work with this sauce.

This was delicious, and my wife said it was her favorite meat loaf recipe yet. I substituted 1 cup of bread crumbs for crushed croutons, and baked it in a 9x14 glass pan, but otherwise followed the recipe.  We will definitely enjoy this many times in the future.

It was perfect.  My kids asked for seconds and they are not big meat eaters!  Very simple and very little prep time.  I did not have croutons so I  used keebler club crackers instead.  It was simply delicious.

I've made this twice now and I've been happy with the end result each time. I did add the salt to the meat instead of the topping and I leave out the chili powder altogether.

I followed one reviewer's advice and replaced the chili (not my favorite spice) with 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp cayenne, 2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp paprika. I used 1 3/4 cups of bread crumbs vs. crushed croutons to make meatloaf a tiny bit firmer with the 80% lean meat.  I glazed the top with the ketchup sauce. Next time I may add a little pepper and with small pieces of green peppers.  Pretty good one not too wet, not too dry and spices really made it!

Delicious!  I made 1 change.  I used 1 pound hamburger and 1 pound ground chicken.   My family didn't even notice.  All they kept talking about was how yummy it was!  Great recipe.

This may be my favorite meatloaf recipe.  I added Italian breadcrumbs instead of the croutons because that's what I had on hand and I threw in a very small amount of fresh hot peppers.  The chili powder certainly added to the sauce.
