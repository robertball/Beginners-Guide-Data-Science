I would probably give this 3.5 stars if they would let you do 1/2's.  Next time I would not bread the chicken.  I don't think I have had saltimbocca that was breaded.  I may try again without the breading and browning the chicken first before putting it in the oven.

My family loved this! All my kids ate their entire portion! I pounded out the chicken first so it was nice and thin. I also used bacon instead of prosciutto.  It was so easy to make! We've added it to our super rotation. Thank you for sharing!
