We really like this, and it is a great low cal/carb option.  I buy the lower moisture ricotta from the cheese store, just like I do for lasagna.  If you can't find it, drain your ricotta on folded paper towels on a plate.  It makes your filling much firmer.  If you don't have a pestle and mortar, you can mix your pesto in a good blender.  Extra garlic never hurts, and sautéing the zucchini before using does wonders for the dish.  Thanks for sharing.

This dish is pretty good, and tastes great. A few things I would change:

1. Refrigerate the ricotta cheese mixture while prepping the rest of the ingredients. Maybe even longer. The mixture becomes very watery while baking.
2. Cook the zucchini(while cheese mix is in the fridge). The zucchini does not get soft while in the oven - even with cooking 15 mins longer than suggested. Next time I will sautée the zucchini strips til they are soft before assembling. 
3. As the other reviewer suggested, I added sauce and cheese to the tops of the zavioli, and I'm very glad I did. With the mixture becoming so watery there was no real sauce left in the bottom. 

Otherwise, very good low carb option. By my calculations, it added up to 3 WW smart points per zavioli. Less olive oil could be used to lower that number.

I microwaved the zucchini first to soften it otherwise
followed the recipe.

Amazing - did not miss the meat.  We used regular store bought ricotta and used a cheese cloth to drain as much water as possible.  From there we seasoned the ricotta and actually used a 1 tbs water 1 tbs oil and 1 tsp baking soda as an egg substitute for vegetarians.  We ensured the ricotta was cold when we combined everything and did not have any 'watery' issues when assembling.  We used store bought pesto for ease and used long toothpicks pre soaked in water.   We also sauteed the zucchini (yellow and green) lightly and seasoned with salt and pepper for added flavour.
 Looked very pretty and tasted amazing.  Served it with simple pasta and garlic bread - making it again!

Looked so pretty it was almost a shame to eat this healthy meal!  No mandolin? Use a potato peeler.  I also recommend using 4 strips per Zavioli, this required 4 small zucchinis but made for easier wrapping and by placing them seam down in the baking dish there was no need for toothpicks (Yield: 15 large Zaviolis.) I was missing the ingredients for the pesto and omitted the egg (personal preference).  Instead, I cooked the spinach with minced garlic, pepper & Italian seasoning, drained well then mixed with light ricotta.  This paired amazingly well with Marinara.  I dabbed each Zavioli with Marinara and topped with some shredded Light Mozzarella and baked for an extra 5 minutes.   Unlike other reviewers I did not find it watery at all, though I did place strips on paper towel and drained the ricotta.  This was such a hit the only disappointment was the lack of leftovers!

This turned out wonderful and worth the extra time to make. I did add some additional spices to the ricotta mixture (the same as I use for my lasagna recipe). My only problem was I wasn't able to wrap the zucchini into bundles. So I ended up  rolling the zucchini stripes and securing with toothpicks. I was worried about it being too juicy since the zucchini wasn't cooked first,but that made the zucchini actually better - just cooked it to a tender crisp. Yummy! I will make again.

Very tasty. I didn’t have a mandolin slicer so getting the zucchini thin enough to roll was a bit of a challenge. Mine wasn’t  super pretty but it was delicious. It did spring a lot of water as per other reviews but it thickened up after cooling  into a flavourful sauce. I will definitely be making this again.

- Used macadamias instead of pine nuts, and a yellow squash instead of zucchini, as that's what I had.

- Added SALT to the pesto mix.

- MIXED pesto & ricotta mix together after prep, to save time in application.

- Used vegan ricotta (made from almonds) and vegan mozzarella (made from cashews) that I already had in the fridge.

No toothpicks were needed; the wetness of the noodles was enough to "seal" the zavs. Broiled them for about 2 minutes after cooking to brown the cheese.

Mine were too juicy because I'd crammed them into a pan, but will do this again. It was tasty. LOVED how fast and easy it was to make (w/ingredients already on hand).

The flavors on this dish were sooooooo delicious. Made a few adjustments: added parmesan to the ricotta mix, sauteed the zucchini strips per another reviewer's suggestion, and made a lasagna instead bc my zucchini was too small to make the ravioli.

Thank you Buckwheat Queen for this creative use of our harvest.  Although I made many changes to use what I had on hand I.e. swiss chard instead of spinach,  it's this recipe that I used as a base.  I will make it as is another day.

These were delicious and fun to make! Loved that these were healthier and gluten free friendly too! We had 2 medium sized zucchinis, and overlapped 2 slices both lengthwise and crosswise. I sauteed 10 oz of fresh spinach for the filling. Our Zaviolis could have used more filling inside, but we were worried about over filling them. With that said, the ingredient amounts for the filling were perfect. Next time I think I'll add the parmesan cheese to the filling mixture and top each zavioli with pasta sauce and shredded mozzarella.  Can't wait to make these in the summer when I have some extra large zucchinis from the garden! Thanks for the recipe!

It was fun to make and enjoyed the short cooking time. The texture was tantalizing having a slight crunch followed by gooey rush from the filling.  A great combination of ingredients and color. I really enjoyed this dish.

Delicious! Even my kids liked it. I let the zoodles dry a bit on a towel and then seasoned them with garlic powder, salt and pepper. I used broken zoodles by overlapping them.

Loved it! Loved it! Loved it and I was surprised my family did too! With kids ages 6,5 & 1 plus a picky husband I was not sure how this would go over and now I wish I made more. Absolutely delicious! I do not have a mandolin so I used a potato peeler to peel my slices, I then layer them all flat on a cookie sheet lined with paper towels. I seasoned the zucchini with salt and pepper and then made the filling. I did not have pine nuts so I had to omit them. Excellent way to eat more vegetables! Kudos Buckwheat queen for a slamming  recipe which I see myself making often, would make a great appetizer too!

I followed the recipe.  Was very tasteless.  I think the zucchini needed to be sauteed a bit before making into parcels.  Needed a huge help I g of salt and pepper - very bland!  Had 8 people (2 vegetarians) for dinner, not one person liked.
Never will bemade again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I used two normal zucchini because I don’t know what an “extra large zucchini” is. No salt and pepper added per taste. I used store bought pesto rather than making it myself as outlined in step 3. Instead of fresh I used frozen chopped spinach. Cook for 4 minutes with added chopped garlic and pizza seasoning before adding it to the egg and cheese mixture. The ingredients made 12 “parcels” which needed 30 minutes to cook at 350 deg F.

I added Italian seasoning in with the ricotta, spinach and egg, and used petite diced tomato with chili in place of the pasta sauce. Delicious! I’ve already made it twice.

Everything was fine other than the zucchini. I made it 3-4 bites before I threw the whole tray out. The zucchini was still hard and very bland. Needed to be softened prior to cooking.

Make sure to use a extra long zucchini.  Making the pouch is difficult with a normal length zucchini.

This was really great and not as heavy as real pasta. I added some garlic powder to the ricotta mix and I think I would add some red pepper flakes to the pasta sauce just for a little more punch. I'll be making it again.

this was a hit when I made it for my wife's Maj Jong party.

followed recipe except I used store bought pesto sauce.
Cooked about 15 minutes longer than time stated. 

Several of the ladies requested this recipe.

It was pretty good considering that my fiancé is not trying to do a lot of meat in his diet.  Just a touch of salt but even without it’s still good. I did add breadcrumbs as a substitute instead of pine nuts for texture, that was a great option.  It was definitely a success.

I added beef to sauce, spread over whole top of dish and mozzarella layered on top.  For a large casserole dish I used up  4 medium Zucchini.   Zucchini leaks a lot of water when it is cooked, no OIL was needed.  Cooked 30 minutes at 375.
