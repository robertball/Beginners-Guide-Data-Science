I too doubled the recipe because I used Krusteaz brand Cinnamon Crumb Cake mix.  When they cool, they become very thin, but crispy and delicious!  I was surprised by how much I liked the hint of black pepper.    What an interesting cookie.  I will be making again!

These are fantastic ! My husband loves me to make mini-cinnamon crumb cupcakes for work. They are so time consuming. I had a box of Krusteaz Cinnamon Crumb Cake mix in the pantry, so I used this recipe ( doubled...the box was 1 lb. 5 oz.), used a 1 1/2" scoop, rolling the sides and top, but not the bottom ( afraid that the sugar would melt and burn the bottom of the cookies), baked for 12 minutes ( the tops did not crack...didn't matter)...made 36 unbelievably great cookies. Now when he asks for his cinnamon cakes, he is getting these ( and I am sure , with no complaints. He hasn't tasted them yet , but I know he will love them.) Thank you soooooo much !

I just made these, and my family loves them. Everyone was skeptical of the black pepper, but it turned out great.  I substituted white cake mix for the coffee cake mix, and added my own cinnamon to the cookie dough.  For the powder, I mixed cinnamon and confectioners sugar and added it after the cookies baked.  Very yummy, unusual recipe.

I loved these. I made them and froze them for my Christmas tray.  They are so easy to make I will definately make them again. Don't be afraid to make these.

Great cookies, everyone that tried them loved them.  Although the spice level was a little higher than expected, so next time I plan on cutting back on the cloves.  Other than that they were awesome.

These are absolutely amazing! I did have to add about 3/4 cups of flour. I might add alittle more pepper next time but that would be it. Everyone loved them!!! So good with tea or coffee. Very delicate, not chewey or crunchy or too soft. Baked alittle longer than stated until the tops cracked abit.

How can something that sounds so wrong, taste SOOOOO right?  If you love spice cookies you have to try these! Tip: They do get firm once cooled. But, if you like them soft like me, put them in a zip lock bag with a piece of white bread.  It keeps them soft for about 3 days.  Thanks for the recipe!

Not being much of a baker this was a perfect recipe for me. I used Krusteaz Cinnamon Crumb Cake mix (21 oz box) and doubled everything else. I got 3 dozen large, flat, soft, tasty cookies. The cloves and pepper were just enough to keep everyone guessing about the secret ingredients. Well received at home and by co-workers, goes on my "make again" list. Thanks

No one ate them at the cookie contest.  I guess the name of the cookie is a turn off.

These are wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly. I'm a great cook but not necessarily at baking. These were simple to make. The mix sounds weird but even my 5 and 7 year olds loved them. I'll be making these for Christmas this year. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a cowboy/western-themed party, and I had at least three or four people (out of forty-ish there) ask for the recipe! They're very different, and I suppose that some people might not like the difference - I mean, pepper in a cookie is pretty darn weird - but I find that most people just think they're interesting and delicious! And super easy to make, too (:

when my husband says 3 times in a row" Man, this is a good cookie!"  It's a keeper.  I predict a hit at the cookie swap tomorrow; the tiny peppery burn at the end is the delightful surprise.

EVERYONE in my family likes these. My hubby likens these to ginger snaps as far as the spice level. It's an interesting recipe to have and most likely you won't have someone else bringing the same thing to the party!

These cookies are just awesome.  They bake up pretty thin, and leave a nice taste of black pepper behind, but are not spicy.  This is a really unique find.
