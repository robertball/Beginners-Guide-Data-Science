Yes, very simple to make and lighter when grilled! I left out the garlic this time and made only half the the recipe; my wife and and I didn't need 10 of them. We topped them with grilled chicken, caramelized onions & mushrooms, prosciutto, either blue cheese crumble or feta, and a drizzle of balsamic salad dressing after heating it through on the grill. The other two we made will be a breakfast flatbread. Stay tuned.

This is so simple to put together and takes just minutes on the grill.  I made them to make individual pizzas and it worked beautifully.

I've made this quite a few times now, and it's always been amazing. Good base for flat bread pizza, and good on it's own.

The recipe is excellent and will be my go-to flatbread recipe from now on. I didn't change a thing. Made them for dinner to serve with black bean dip and fried plantains, and they were so good I made them a second night in a row. My husband says he would eat them anytime. Thanks for sharing!

WoW!  These are lighter, quicker & tastier than all the yeast flatbreads I have tried!  A definite keeper that I will make often,  Very, Very often!!  DELISH!!!  I'd give this recipe a 10 if I could :)
