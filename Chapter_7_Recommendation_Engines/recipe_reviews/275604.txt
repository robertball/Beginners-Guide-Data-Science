I made this except I substituted Feta cheese for the Mozzarella cheese. I've also added sliced onion to the tomato mix. If you dice the tomatoes, make it a day ahead of time and refrigerate to give the flavors a chance to blend together. I would make it again, especially in the summer because it's cool and refreshing.

It doesn't get much better than fresh heirlooms, basil, mozzarella, olive oil, and balsamic! I served this as an appetizer, so I sliced the heirlooms instead of dicing, and left the basil whole. The one issue I had with the recipe was with the 1 1/2 cups olive oil--that's way too much! I used 2 tbsps, and that was plenty for 5 tomatoes. I imagine using the full amount would have been a bit overwhelming. Also, use the balsamic to taste, and you'll have a great tomato salad! Thanks for the recipe!
