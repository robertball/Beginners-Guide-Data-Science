Hi! I am the submitter of this recipe and when you simmer the heavy cream and sugar, make sure you see tiny bubbles around the edge of the pot. Oh, and you can stir the frosting in the refrigerator often, it doesn't have to be every few minutes. Enjoy!

this is my favorite homemade brownie recipe. I use 1 1/2 c of cocoa + 1/2 c of melted butter to sub for the 8oz of unsweetened chocolate (I always have cocoa powder and hardly have unsweetened chocolate) - I also like baking it in a jelly roll pan, it's done in about 22 min and I can get about 50 pieces out of it, it also helps that I like thin brownies ... and I've been successful using milk in place of the cream for the frosting

I also was like Keri and made these when she shared her recipe on "the exchange". This rivals my Dad's Chocolate Death Cake. I about go into a chocolate coma when I eat these. My husband and I fight over the leftovers and don't dare share with the kids. Want a fabulous brownie recipe, look no further.

Amazing brownies.  I didn't have enough butter to make the full recipe, so I cut it in half and used a 9x9 pan.  Also didn't have any unsw. baking choc. squares, so I substituted cocoa and butter (3T cocoa + 1T butter for each oz of choc).  Made the full recipe of frosting--keeping the extra in the fridge--it will taste really good on a spoon!

These are by far the best "fudgy" type brownie out there.  My family can't get enough of them!  They come out soo "pretty" and taste even better!  Not for those who only "like" chocolate!!!  I also LOVE the frosting and use it for fillings in cakes, to frost cakes/cupcakes, and my husband loves to have a container in the fridge to eat it w/ a spoon! :)  If you are looking for the ultimate chocolate brownie, look no further.  What do you have to lose...give them a try! And if you by chance don't like them...send them our way! :)

I love these brownies!  I have never had such fudgy brownies, or such rich, fudgy frosting.  It is very important not to overbake these, or you will lose the fudgy texture.  Give these a try, you won't be sorry,(unless you prefer cakey brownies).

I'm sorry to say that these brownies were not good at all (in my opinion).  I followed the recipe exactly and they just did not turn out well. I didn't like the texture and the taste was that of extremely bitter chocolate, but I will admit that I am not a fan of dark chocolate. If you are not a fan of dark chocolate these are definatley not the brownies for you.  But if you are you may love them.

I struggled with what to give these brownies.  I followed the recipe exactly.  They are extremely rich.  A small, bite-size piece is enough.  We are dark chocolate lovers and they were still a bit much when it comes to richness.  I did appreciate the icing and will likely use it again on another brownie or a cake recipe.  This recipe is worth trying if you like rich, heavy brownies.

Best brownie recipe on this site!  The frosting is to die for.  Be careful not to overbake these or else they won't be so fudgy..

Absolutely scrumptious!  I followed the directions using my Kitchen Aid mixer and they came out rich and fudgy.  The only change I would suggest is to add salt, especially if using unsalted butter.  I would add 1 tsp. to the brownies and 1/2 tsp. to the frosting.  It really helps to balance out the sweetness.  This is totally a five star recipe since I can't stop eating them.  I've been sneaking bites all weekend long!

Decadent, Fudgy, Rich, Super Chocolate Flavor...that's just some of the words and phrases my family used to described these incredible brownies! The best "fudgy" brownie recipe I have ever made or eaten. We love the flavor that the unsweetened chocolate gives these and the texture is wonderful...almost like a truffle. I picked up a couple of packages of the new brownie tattoos and they worked great on these. 7 adults and 3 kids....they are almost gone! I can't wait to make another batch. Thanks for sharing, Celeste!

The WOW factor is how this brownie was described by our friends.  I made three types of brownies for a sundae bar and this rich, fudgy, chocolatey delight was enjoyed by everyone.  They are very rich, so I cut them in small pieces.  The frosting on this brownie is the best "brownie frosting" I have ever made.  So glad I had too much frosting that I could just eat a spoonful of it.  YUM!  If you like fudgy frosted brownies, please look no further.  Celeste has given you the perfect recipe to try.  I individually froze some pieces for lunches, they thaw great and look like the day I made them.  Thanks Celeste for sharing your recipe - it is a keeper.

Celeste shared this recipe with me before it was published here and I must say they are indeed "Scrumptious Fudgy Brownies". For family taste preferences I omitted the nuts. They do take a bit of time to make but the end result is quite delicious. Hmmmmm now I have a Brownie craving just thinking about this recipe again, off to check supplies in the kitchen to make these delights again!!

Really nice flavor.. more dark chocolately than sicky sweet like boxed brownies can be. They were easy to make and everyone enjoyed them. I personally liked them cold better than room temperature. When they were cold, I think they were more chewy and at room temp they had a slight cake texture. I think these would appeal mrore to adults than kids because of the dark flavor of them.. which is fine by me because I get more! :) I bet these would be yummy if you subbed kahlua for the vanilla

Why oh why isn't there a 10 star rating option? These will knock your socks off even without the frosting. So fudgy and moist and everything a great brownie should be. Perfection! Only thing I'll do differently next time is pour the batter into larger pans so they're not quite as thick (and thus reduce the baking temperature and time). Sprinkling in some miniature milk chocolate chips wouldn't be a bad idea either, they'll just need to be cut into smaller squares from being rich but that just means the batch will go further if you're serving them at a party or as gifts. Thanks for the recipe. My life is now complete.

Moist brownie, really good frosting.  Doubled the recipe and baked 30 min (9x13 pan)  Added 2 teaspoons instant coffee to the brownie mix to give it a richer chocolate flavor (I do this to all my chocolate cakes, cookies).  This is a winner for sure.

The recipe sounded great, but I wanted to take into account the few comments where people said the brownies turn out too rich or too "dark." I whisked a teaspoon of baking powder and a half-teaspoon of salt into the flour before adding it to the chocolate mixture, and they came out just about perfect, the way I like them. The baking powder makes them cakier, and the salt cuts the sweetness just a little. Next time I will add between 1/2 and 3/4 teaspoon of the baking powder, because I do like them on the fudgy side. ALSO - seemed like baking the recipe in a 9 x 13 pan would make them too thick, so I made them in a (roughly) 12 x 16 bar cookie pan I have. They were the perfect thickness, and it made about four dozen 1+1/2-inch squares.

I, too, received this recipe from Celeste through the Recipe Exchange and have made them multiple times since then.  They are fabulous!  I usually leave off the frosting, just because we prefer them that way.  However, if I'm taking them someplace to share, I include the frosting and get rave reviews.  Thanks Celeste!

This review is for the brownie part only as I didn't end up using the frosting (I had leftover buttercream so ended up using that as frosting). They're very good, nice and fudgy as promised, but I too got that weird crust that some other reviewers mentioned. A crusty top on brownies isn't a weird thing in itself, but for about 1/3 of the pan, the crust was raised up and there was vacant space underneath it. I had to peel those areas off before frosting, but the rest of it, where the crust was directly on top of brownie was fine. Still, great fudgy taste!

Extremely fudge-like. It was very good but I made a lot of changes and experimented. My sisters and I are not huge dark chocolate fans (at all) so I substituted most of the unsweetened chocolate for milk chocolate chips, I added 1 square of unsweetened to the buttered mix.  I did something similar to the frosting as well. I sub'd a lot of unsweetened chocolate with the chocolate chips. But since I wanted a little contrast the flavor of the milk chocolate brownie, I added 3 bars of unsweetened and the rest milk chocolate chips.  I found it was a fool-proof recipe that allows for experimenting with a tasty result.

Totally delicious. My sister's boyfriend described them as "it's like gods came down from the heavens, wrapped me in clouds and poured fudge down my throat." I didn't make the frosting because I didn't have the ingredients for it and I needed brownies in my belly ASAP. But, it looks amazing and I plan on making it again with the frosting. Only actual change I made was adding a 12 oz bag of peanut butter chips to it. Most def my new brownie recipe.

Everything worked with this recipe.  It tasted great.  I added pecans on top with a small white vanilla chip.  The brownie stayed chewy and the frosting added to the flavor instead of overpowering it.  Wonderful recipe!

Believe the reviews that say this is a dark chocolate recipe. I love chocolate, but this was too much for me. However, the frosting is divine. I will definitely use it again paired with a sweeter base.

-Very rich and very fudgey
-Very chocolatey, but not too dark, as a few others have said...this coming from someone who absolutely adores milk chocolate and finds other types "meh".
-I admit they are expensive to make, however, I feel as though the pan will last a while because the brownies are so rich
-frosting:brownie ratio is perhaps a little high, but that can always be fixed but eating some of the frosting out of the pot ;)
-These brownies were exactly what I was craving yesterday

EVEN GLUTEN FREE and SUGAR FREE, these taste AMAZING.  If the recipe can stand up to that much abuse, it must be magic.  I used a rice-based GF mix and xylitol in place of sugar.  I have been searching for an excellent, truly fudgy brownie recipe for years and this is the first to really deliver.

These brownies are IT.  The be-all, end-all of browniedom.  They are thick, fudgy, rich, chocolatey...exactly what I have been looking for in a scratch brownie recipe!  And the frosting is delightful.   I made the frosting using half and half instead of heavy cream.  Turned out fine and reduces the calories by about 40 per piece.   I also halved the recipe and baked in a 9inch square pan.  Everything halves perfectly except the eggs, for which I used 2 eggs + 1 egg yolk.  For the frosting, I put in the servings as 13 to get the proportions to go with 2 squares of unsweetened chocolate (which was all I had left).  That's a little less than half the original frosting recipe, but it was plenty.   Thank you, Celeste, for an amazingly good recipe.  A+++.

I made these for a family gathering and the reviews were VERY mixed.  Some people really loved how rich, dense and moist they were.  Others thought they were "too much."  However, no one ventured to have a second, and in my family, that's usually a clear sign.  They definitely have great chocolate flavor, but I think I'll continue my search for the perfect brownie recipe.

I don't know if everyone here didn't follow the directions, or if no one used a kitchen aid.  I should have followed my gut feeling but I didn't.  When you beat the sugar, eggs, and vanilla on high for two minutes exactly, with a kitchenaid, it turns it almost into a mousse.  I was hoping that the butter/ chocolate mixture would thicken it up, but it didn't.         However when the batter is like a mousse, the cooking time is dead on.  The finished product is pretty much a cake.  Very disappointed.  Maybe if I would have followed my instict, and beaten on a much lower speed, for a shorter amount of time, my product would have been more brownie like.

I made these in my Crockpot..OH MY!! They were yummy. The Crockpot leaves them a little more gooey. They didn't last very long. Everyone in the house finished them off the same night. Thank you for this recipe!

If you like really rich, really sweet brownies you'll love these. I thought I couldn't get enough chocolate but boy was I wrong these were decadent! Mine didn't set well but that was my fault, I baked in a smaller pan and they began to burn on the edges...I'll stick with my normal recipe...

Wow!!  Celeste gave me this recipe on the exchange well before it was published but I was secretly terrified of it, thinking I'd burn the chocolate and make an utter mess.  Why, oh, why did I not make these months ago?!?  They are too die for and my idiot self even only added 1/2 a c. of butter to the batter instead of a full cup.  I can only imagine how good they'd be with a full cup.  Make sure you follow the directions with the icing.  The icing alone tastes like a delicious rich brownie batter.  I'll be making these for years to come.  Thanks for a real winner, Celeste!!

I followed this recipe to the letter. I thought it would produce a nice fudgy brownie. Boy was I wrong. I have always been good at cooking and baking, but these just burnt around the edges, formed a crust on top and never cooked in the middle. It was like a brownie cake on the outside with fudge sauce in the middle. I even baked them more than twice the  amount of time suggested thinking that they might finally set. The batter had a great flavor, but in the end it was a waste of ingredients. They ended up not being edible at all. I was really disappointed as they smelled so good as they were baking. This is the first time I have ever given a bad mark to any of the recipes I have used on this site. Normally I have much success. All I can think is that I must have done something wrong or something just totally went amiss with this one.

I will give a longer review once I try them, but as a warning you must wait for the topping to be completely cooled and the brownies to be completely cooled!! I know they look delicious but please let them cool!!!

Brownie Bliss! woot! woot!  These are SO good.  These will definitely be my "go to" brownies for special occasions.  "Special" because I found them kind of expensive to make (the chocolate is pricey) and because they are too decadent to eat regularly.

If you are looking for a fudgy brownie...then look no further! This is a very good recipe that got great reviews from all who tried it. For me, I would leave off the frosting in the future, but DH disagrees with me, so I think that is just a personal preference. Thanks so much for sharing!

The flavor of these is definitely a 5 star rating, but the texture is a 3, so I took the average.  Mine developed a thick crust on the top that you could literally peel off in chunks.  I checked these after 25, 30, 35 minutes, and they were still liquid in the middle.  I probably ended up baking these for 40-43 minutes.  The crust was developed by the first testing.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I will probably try these again because my kids still ate them.

Loved this brownie!  Fudgy Chocolatey goodness. They are super rich.  The recipe was easy to make and follow, the only thing I did was add a little salt.  I didn't make the icing(but would love to try it next time).

So I made these exactly like it said to but for some reason mine came out with this crust. I thought it was the top of the brownies at first but then I stuck a knife through it to cut and it was almost an inch above the brownies themselves. There was the crust, an inch of nothingness and then the brownies. Also, It took like 20 minutes more than specified to cook bc they were really soggy-not fudgy-after I took them out. But, then I tried them after they cooled. The top is crusty and hard, the middle is soft-not fudgy, and they don't taste that chocolatey-just sweet. I also made the frosting which didn't turn out either, it's runny.  I don't know what went wrong! I was really looking forward to eating these fudgy brownies.

I was planning on making the frosting for these but didn't have time, so this review is for the brownies only. But man, these were good. Actually, better than good. THESE BROWNIES WERE THE BOMB. They're definitely some of the best brownies I've ever eaten. Incredible recipe!

Holy wa, these are wonderful brownies. All I had was 6oz of unsweetened chocolate so I had to top it off with 2oz of semi-sweet chocolate and I don't understand why some people said they tasted too bitter. I haven't even frosted these and they are deliciously sweet, perfectly balanced with the rich chocolate taste. They are nice and light on the outside and fudgy and dense in the middle. I will be using this recipe from now on. Try it, you'll like it!

TEN STARS!! BEST brownie's I have EVER had, let alone made! I had to share them with my family for fear of making myself sick from a chocolate overdose. I seriously could have ate the whole pan. Thanks Celeste! My search for the perfect brownie is OVER!

I found this recipe & another highly rated (by over 300 people) cocoa-based brownie recipe on this site.  I wasn't sure which one to make so I thought I'd have a 'taste testing'.  I made both batches & cut each up into little serving pieces. I happened to be having 12 adults guests over for labor day, so I gave them each a 'testing plate'& asked them to tell me which one they preferred.  This recipe was the unanimous winner. Everyone commented on how rich & fudgy they were.  I had to scold my 2 adult kids because they were trying to eat the whole pan!  And I didn't even frost them.  Thanks, Celeste.  I will never by another boxed brownie mix again.

Holy jumping cats! These are UNBELIEVABLE! I made these for my husband to take to work as a weekly treat and they were gone within an hour and a half! I tried one at home first and it was the deepest, darkest, most chocolaty brownie I've ever had. And the icing - it's a bit of a production, but it is SO WORTH IT. I had to work hard to keep myself from just gobbling it down with a spoon! These brownies received rave reviews from all of my husband's coworkers. I do recommend using good quality chocolate for the icing - I used Ghiradelli - because the taste of it comes through so strongly. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Celeste!

Bravo, Celeste! These are fabulous. Watch the baking time. I used a metal non-stick pan, set oven at 350 degrees (375 seemed too high for my oven) and took brownies out at 32 minutes. Outer edges were a little dry. Ovens vary so much, 350 degrees is a safe bet, next time I'll take it out at 30 minutes. Followed recipe on frosting, for those who thought it was runny, refrigerate per instructions, stirring it occasionally, it will thicken nicely. The nuts are essential. It is fantastic served with a scoup of vanilla ice cream, it will impress your guests.

We are a brownie-loving household and we all gave these brownies an enthusiastic 5 stars...and my 5 year-old does not give out a five star rating very often ;)The only change I made to the recipe is I omitted the nuts and sprinkled the top with m&ms. Rich and fudgy, just like we like it :) Thanks for the recipe!

Yes, rich, fudgy, and scrumptious absolutely describe this incredible dessert.  A pan full of these will go a long way, but to pull one of these from the freezer when you want something to carry you off into Sweet Heaven will be pure nirvana.  Thank you, sweet Celeste ♥ ♥ .  It's been worth the long wait to have these hit the AR archives.

I love fudgy brownies, and I love deep, dark chocolate flavor, so these are simply perfect in my book!  If you have the urge to bake longer, resist! Just follow the instructions and they will come out great.  The frosting is sinfully delicious on it's own!

These are amazing! Didn't have whipping cream so I used a sub I found. 1/3 c butter 3/4 c milk 1tbsp flour. Seemed weird. Turned out great. This is so chewy and fudgy. Frosting and brownie are delicous.

Super good and even better the next day. I didn't frost them since I dont have much of a sweet tooth. I never have much luck with brownies so I have been trying my hand  at them again recently and these turned out perfect without having to drag everything in the baking cabinet out. I have had this recipe from Celeste since before it was published and I can't believe I have waited so long to try it. Thx again celeste!

These were some great brownies! I followed recipe exactly as written, and they turned out great! They were a little Rich, but with all that chocolate and sugar...they ought to be! 
My niece and nephew, who both LOVE LOVE LOVE chocolate said they were" too chocolatey" 
I think the best way to serve is in very small pieces...
Overall, Wonderful and I'll be making them again and again, Thanks so much for Sharing Celeste!! :o)

These are so chocolatey and delicious!  Next time, I may use 2 9x9 pans, because I like my brownies to be a little thinner, but that is just personal preference.  I used a glass dish, so I preheated to 350 degrees.  Here are the few changes I made: 1) I cut them small and placed in cupcake liners for easy handling.  2) I refrigerated for a few hours to make for easy cutting and then thawed them for a few hours before serving.  3) I didn't know if everyone liked walnuts, so I made some with walnuts and some without, all in the pan.  All I did was cut a strip of parchment paper to be the exact length of the middle of my pan.  Then, I folded it in half, and placed it so that one half was flat on the pan, and the other was sticking up in the middle of the pan.  Then, I placed some objects on the flat half to hold it while I poured one side of the brownies.  I then removed the objects and poured the other half of the brownies.  The parchment paper held up and didn't let either side of the brownies meet much.  When cutting, I just cut them and then removed the parchment.  Easy breezy!

These brownies have the best fudge consistency. I halved the recipe using 2 whole eggs with one egg white and reduced baking time by ten minutes. I didn't bother with the icing as these brownies were rich enough without it. I ran out of baking squares and substituted with the 3TBsp to 1TBsp ratio of cocoa powder and butter per ounce. Finally, a homemade recipe for great fudgy brownies.

Ridiulous! These are absolutely ridiculous! So freakin fantastic its not even funny! I used cocoa and butter instead of chocolate squares, but it turned out great! I havent made the icing yet, but I will! Thanks for such a choco-holic dream!
I made the icing, and it just makes it THAT much better. Such a fab brownie for a serious choco-holic. LOVE it!

I made this recipe without walnuts and used I can't believe it's not butter as a butter substitute. The brownies came out wonderfully. If you're not making the frosting however, I highly suggest rethinking it. The frosting had completely topped off the dish, making them the best brownies I've ever had. My dad, who never eats chocolates even ate some, along with my poor mom who was on a "diet." My brother and I absolutely fell in love with them and I will certainly make them again.

Best brownies I've ever made. I did feel the ingredients were incredibly bad for you, but if you are going to have a brownie, you might at well enjoy it. Because I am in Germany at the moment, it was difficult to find unsweetened baking chocolate. So I substituted unsweetened cocoa powder (3 Tbsp for each oz.) and didn't add any extra oil or butter and it turned out great and decreases the calorie count a bit. I must admit I didn't make the frosting (although I intended to) because the brownies tasted so delicious on their own. If you're going to treat yourself, this is the one!

As other reviews have noted, these are super rich and chocolaty. I also baked them closer to 45 minutes then 35 minutes.   They are really dense and fudgy.  My husband and I really loved them.  I didn't use the frosting in the recipe though, I used the condensed milk chocolate frosting recipe here on this site.   This will be a great "special occasion" treat for my recipe box!

I've tried this recipe twice and both times the 35 minute bake time turned into almost an hour as only the edges seemed to cook. The center was a runny mess. Once the brownies had baked for an hour and sat overnight and I removed the hard "crust" that had formed on the top, they were really good! If I could figure out why they aren't baking correctly I'd give a five.  Aslo, you can never have too much chocolate. Anyone who says they are a chocolate lover and says these are too rich should consider not saying they are a chocolate lover. I'd consider making these again and again just to have that heavy rich middle section even with the extra bake time and hard crust!

Yeah, these are awesome.  I left out the walnuts though since no one in my family would eat them if they had nuts in them.  For the frosting I had to go with some semi-sweet & some milk chocolate because the brownies themselves were almost too dark chocolate for me.  I loved the texture and creaminess of the frosting.  I've never made a brownie frosting like that before.  Easy and delicious.  Probably could make a triple batch and frost a cake with it.  The brownies developed that wonderful flaky top after baking. The edges were slightly crunchy and the middle was nice and fudgy.  This was a very easy recipe to put together.  I did not use my Kitchen  Aid mixer.  I just used a large bowl and mixed by hand and it turned out just fine.  I will definitely be making these again but I might have to use semisweet on the brownies next time so they won't be quite as dark.

very good. very fudgey and gooey. the frosting is basically ganache so it's easier to eat these with a spoon. very messy held in your hands. Also, it took closer to 50 minutes for my frosting to chill until thick. I don't think they taste like dark chocolate at all -- look at how many cups of sugar are in this recipe -- it's just intense chocolate (but not bitter). I melted 3/4 of a bag of marshmallows for 3 minutes on the top and chilled before adding frosting. scrumptious is a good word.

BEWARE: For SERIOUS chocoholics only!  These are hands down the most decadent, rich, fudgy, chocolatey, BEST brownies I have ever had.  Mine came out from the oven about 3" tall, and with the frosting and the layer of walnuts I topped them with, they were easily a good 4" tall by the end!  HuMONgous!  I made them as a belated birthday gift for my dad, but I don't know if they'll survive until tomorrow when I see him!  The bake time was a little long in my oven, and at 35 min. the edges were burnt a little.  30-33 would have been perfect.  I cut the crispy part off though, and it was fine.  Later on, I actually caught my husband eating the scrap pieces!    THAT'S how good these brownies are--they're even delicious a little burnt!  LOL!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The brownies were awesome -- moist, dense and fudgy, which is just what I'm looking for in a brownie. Lots of work to make the frosting, though, which isn't something that typically bugs me, but if I'm putting that much time, effort and money into frosting, it better be the best frosting in the universe! And it wasn't. It was good, with a really rich, chocolatey flavour, but it was sticky and when the brownies were served, it quickly became melty and drippy. So if you're going to keep the brownies in the fridge, then I guess the frosting's good, but if you're going to serve them and have them out for guests, and presentation is important, I'd go for a frosting that sets up a little bit more solidly.

These are AMAZING!!!  At first, I thought the frosting was a little runny but it set well anyway and I got the feeling these brownies would be great even without the frosting. Wonderful recipe!

This recipe absolutely lives up to its name. So decadent. I added some chocolate chips. I was afraid the brownie wouldn't be able to stand by itself (since everyone raved about the frosting) but they are terrific! This is the first brownie recipe I have tried (out of several) that has the potential to replace the double chocolate Ghiardelli box version which my dad loves.

These seriously deserve more than 5 stars!  I made these for a get together with my girlfriends this weekend and they were such a hit!  These are extremely rich, so you don't need a very big piece at all.  I tried it with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top and then nuked it all in the microwave for about 30 seconds and it was pure heaven.

Very good. I cut in half using 2 eggs for an 8 x 8 pan, baked for about 28 minutes. I really like the chewy corners. I did not use frosting. They definitely don't need it. I may cut sugar next time for more dark chocolate taste. I will most likely use this recipe again, and may try the frosting.

I am a brownie lover BIG TIME!  They are my ultimate favorite sweet.  I love dense and fudgy brownies with nuts, topped with fudgy frosting.  These fit that bill to perfection.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out absolutely perfect.  This is THE perfect brownie recipe IMHO!  This is definitely an "impress-your-friends-and-family" type brownie.  My whole family said 5 stars.  Thanks for sharing, Celeste!

These are so delicious and strangely enough not too sweet for me.  I left the icing in the fridge a little too long so I decided to use the bag and just put a dollop on each one.  This is the dessert that will be included with our Hopeful Meal tonight.  We prepare a dinner along with a dessert and sell to raise funds for the House of Hope in Harrison, Arkansas.

These are good & chocolately.  Nice!  :)  'Think I've solved the "crust" thing referred to in some reviews: glass or metal.  I used glass & got the too-crisp-but-still-edible edges.  I'll bake at 350 next time - with glass.  I got voted down for frosting.  :(  'Bet it's great though.  Celeste is amazing.  I didn't add nuts, but did a half t salt.  These are taller than most brownies, but not ridiculously - just a li'l 411.  A few reviews in, someone baked in a jellyroll pan.  I may try that sometime, too.  Thanks, Celeste!  :)  (Miss you!)

In terms of taste, this was fives stars. However, after an hour and a half of letting it cool in the pan, I attempted to cut it into squares. It was too crumby and ultimately I got a few perfect squares, but a lot of crumbs and small pieces. Suffice to say, it was difficult to frost.

I am from the Philippines. I cooked this for the first time and when I served this with The Best Chocolate Chop Cookies(also from this site), it were a total K.O. My father's co-workers loved it and even asked me to make these into cupcakes. So, here's my question, is there any addons in the recipe like, baking powder or baking soda? I am trying to make it in 1oz and 3oz cupcakes. Please help. :)

They were alright, but not as good as I expected.  I didn't do the frosting so I would take that into consideration, but I was looking for a brownie recipe that stood out well enough without frosting or toppings.  Probably wouldn't make again.

Mmmmmm, absolutely fudgy and rich! Followed the recipe exactly, didn't change anything. Turned out awesome!! As others said, really make sure you take them out when they have crumbs, otherwise they'll be cakey. Still delicious, but just a heads up :)

My daughters and I were looking for a really good fudgy brownie recipe.  Unfortunately, these kind of had too much chocolate rather than delivering the "fudgy" part.  It's not one I'll keep around.

I have to say these are the best brownies i have had in my whole life. My mom says that they are a little too sweet and to cut the sugar in half. But i say its just prefect for anyone who loves chocolate.

These were fantastic - I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using half and half instead of the heavy cream.  I think the frosting should be a recipe on it's own - I've never been more pleased with a frosting.  Not only did it taste great, but it stayed beautiful through the cutting - same with the brownie.  Thanks for a great (indulgent) recipe Celeste!

Unfortunately I baked mine for 35 minutes, but it was too long for my oven, so the edges were a little overdone. But nonetheless, the center of the pan is amazing! I followed the directions for the frosting, except cutting back on the sugar because I used semi-sweet chips instead of unsweetened blocks. My frosting was very runny though, despite letting the sugar/cream simmer until it bubbled. Any tips on how to get the frosting to thicken up?

So rich, so fudgy, so delicious!  The brownies were perfect without the frosting, so I didn't bother with it; I omitted the nuts as well.  This will be my go-to brownie recipe when I want to impress.  Thanks Celeste!

We loved these!  I did use margarine instead of butter since that's what I had on hand.  Also, I used heavy whipping cream instead of heavy cream (I'm not sure if there's a difference between those two).  These will be my regular brownie recipe from now on- thank you so much, Celeste!

The brownies are great and the frosting is great, but, not together.  Way too sweet.  Next time, will make the brownies without the frosting.  They are delicious.  Also, mine were ready at 30 mins.

Celeste shared this recipe back in July with me. I made them for my oldest son's birthday. I did not simmer the cream & sugar until tiny bubbles formed, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SIMMER IT LONG ENOUGH, mine was very runny. I put it on the brownies, it was more like a glaze than a frosting. I served them any way and they were a huge hit with every one. I'm sure they are even better with the frosting made the right way. I will be making this recipe often. Thank you Celeste.

WOW.  Holy cow, these little suckers are RICH and delicious!  I made the recipe exactly per the instructions, except for adding nuts to the brownies themselves.  I have some in the family who don't like nuts, so I just sprinkled some on 1/3 of the frosting when they were done. I'm a chocolate lover and I think two are going to be my limit tonight--SUPER rich. The brownies by themselves are very good, but the frosting really puts them in another category.  I'm already planning on what else I can use this frosting recipe for.  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe--I will definitely be making these the next time I have to take a dessert somewhere!

Crumbly mess when we tried to eat them warm, as is our habit.  I cooked them for 10 minutes longer than the longest recommended time and they still seemed like uncooked doughy things.  

Both of the previously mentioned fails would have been happily ameliorated if we had actually enjoyed the flavor.  Sadly all three of us dislike the results, far too dense, bitter, and just not yum.  My 11 y.o. daughter who has a serious sweet tooth left her entire piece on her plate, and the pan has just sat uneaten and unloved in the fridge since =(

TLDR: Too dense, seemed uncooked, very bitter flavor.  Perhaps good for those who LOVE dark, heavy sweets?

This recipe is very forgiving, even when you don't add the right amount of chocolate because you read the recipe wrong. Still very delicious! I had 2 grand boys helping me make it because they wanted "pumpkin patch halloween" brownies. (See photo)   I had never made a frosting like this one, but once it got cold enough, it set up very well. Next time, I will make it in a wider (as opposed to deeper) pan; I think it would have gotten thicker faster had it been in a wider pan and shallower.

These are the best brownies I have ever had. Ultra rich and chewy.  My husband swears they would be  $10/per brownie at a high- end bakery.  Only change I made was to add 1 tsp.  salt to the flour mixture and 1/2 tsp. salt to the frosting.   They hold up well in the freezer.  Got a secret stash in there right now....shhhh.  Thank you Celeste for sharing

Amazing recipe! I reduced the sugar for the main cake to 2 cups and found the frosting slightly sweet so will reduce sugar by 1/3 as well in the future. It was super well received by all the chocolate lovers in my family! Definitely a keeper

In the list of ingredients it calls for 8 squares of chocolate equal to 1 ounce. Yet in the preparation it calls for a total of 13 ounces of chocolate. I read the reviews and no one said anything about this. So what is it supposed to be?

These are definitely fudgy/moisty. But they are WAY too sweet! And I'm a chocoholic. I love rich chocolatey things, but this was just too much.
