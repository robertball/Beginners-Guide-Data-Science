These turned out quite well. I used brown rice and forgot the cheese. I used corn flakes to cover the rice balls.

I thought these were ok and my mom liked them but my 8-year-old wouldn't eat more than two bites. The flavors are very interesting so if you like different foods with new flavors, I'd say give it a try. I also coated them with crushed corn flakes.
