Gourmet on a budget! I tried and loved it as written but to change it for a party, I added some of the diced ham pieces, some chopped pickeled jalepeno's, celery salt and used roasted red peppers! Spread this on spinach tortilla wraps and sliced for finger food! This was the first tray to be emptied and even the guys ask for the recipe!! Thank you!

This is delicious...I found this recipe after I discovered the pimento cheddar spread at the grocery store (which I LOVE) costs $5!!! This recipe is just as good, if not better, and makes twice as much for less money. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added the liquid from the pimento jar...it helped make the mixing easier and adds more pimento yumminess.

Delicious!!!! Didn't realize it was so easy to make Pimento Cheese. If I'd known, I would have been making this years ago.

This is delicious, and so very easy to make! I have never made pimento cheese before, and I will never purchase it again, I will always make my own. The first time I made this was for Thanksgiving, and I followed the recipe as written and everyone loved it! Second time, I made this for Christmas and I used Miracle Whip instead of the mayo, and it's really great with that also, nice change! That added a very slight sweetness , and it was "sharper" in flavor. I served this with assorted crackers (wheat, rye, butter, sesame & onion). I will definitley use this recipe again for sure! Thanks so much for sharing :)

Fabulous! I use roasted red peppers in a jar in place of the pimentos, a really good sharp cheddar, and light cream cheese.

This was great. It reminds me of the Pimento Cheese my grandmother used to make.  Use as a sandwich spread, or stuffed in jalapenos as an hors d'oeuvre. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I forgot to take a picture of this delish spread. Darn, I ate it all! I also used most of mine for the fried  Mac n' Cheese balls. I will definitely make this again! Next time, I will save a little of the drained pimento juice so I can make the spread a little more spreadable. It would give it more pimento flavor as well. Loved it!!

Calories per serving doesn't mention how much is in a serving.  HELP!  Delicious!  But next time I'll measure the garlic powder.  I might have gotten a little heavy handed when I sprinkled in more than a dash.  Now I have to wait for it to chill so I can taste it AGAIN!

Yum! I added a dash of cayenne for some zip, and green onions, as another reviewer suggested. I also used roasted red peppers, good extra sharp and light cream cheese, which beats easier. I bought little garlic breads to spread it on, but its so good I think I'd prefer it on crackers, as not to take away from the taste of the dip.

This is so good! I added a pinch of cayenne pepper for a bit of heat. I love this recipe since it has no "processed cheese food" in the ingredients.

Simple, fairly inexpensive and absolutely delicious.  My edits:  I also added some diced pickled jalapeno, as well as cayenne.  In the end, and this may sound strange, but I stirred in about 2tbsp. of sugar!  Perhaps using salad dressing instead of real mayo would curb this need, but I wanted mine a bit sweeter.  Thoroughly scrumptious!!

This is sooooooo good! Pure comfort food. I accidentally added onion powder instead of garlic power but it turned out fine. The tip about using the liquid from the pimentos was a good one, but in addition to some of the pimento liquid I added a dash of liquid smoke for that smoked cheddar flavor along with some chipotle chile pepper powder for zing. I'll use this again and again! I'm Looking very forward to trying it on whole grain crackers.

The best pimento cheese spread I've ever made or tasted. I've tried recipes before that was too simple: mayo, cheese, and pimentos. I think a great pimento cheese recipe calls for more than that, and this recipe has it. I also added the pimento juice and the pimento flavor is incredible. I only had a medium cheddar, but I believe it would be better with extra-sharp, which is what the recipe calls for. Thanks for sharing!

Just made this, it is sooooo good. perfect appetizer. I went off another review suggesting to put cayenne pepper, added green onions and only put about 4 oz of cream cheese instead of 8 oz. perfect with pita chips!

I really liked using the neufchatel cheese with this.  I didn't have any sharp cheddar, only mild, but it still tastes delicious.  I did add just a bit of salt.  Very good flavor with the hint of garlic powder.  I'll be making this again, much cheaper and you can make it a bit more healthy using the reduced fat items.

I have never been a big fan of pimento cheese, and since I have never had homemade I decided to give it a try for a ladies luncheon I was doing for church.  I was so surprised to find that this recipe was WONDERFUL!  All the ladies raved about the sandwiches.  I think that the cream cheese made a huge difference.  Thanks for the great recipe!

i can see how people might like this creamy dip, but it's just not pimento cheese. the cream cheese takes away from the mayo tang and makes the whole thing too rich! plus, for the people substituting for pimentos in their reviews; that just silly! it's pimento cheese!

This is a great recipe. It is the same recipe I have used for years, except the cream cheese. I must say the cream cheese makes all the difference.

Huge hit with everyone. Including my 6 ear old. Made a lot of spread. It lasted us for 2-3 days, and we even gave some to my parents.

Delicious. I have been making this for years, except without cream cheese and just lots of mayo. I'll use this recipe from now on - however, my two "secret" ingredients that I always add are (approx) 1 1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, and 1 teaspoon sugar. It gives it the perfect flavor.

I will NEVER buy store bought again! I've made this several times. It's great exactly as written. I regularly add more garlic to my liking. I also, periodically, add chopped jalapeño, or chipotle peppers (chopped) with sauce....or even both! Mix it up...the base recipe if perfect! I prefer using Cabot X-Sharp White Cheddar. Try it! NOTE: Light mayo and light cream 
cheese cut calories and taste JUST as 
good!

It didn't have enough cheese and it got very hard in the fridge. The flavors never seemed to blend. It was just okay.

This is pretty good.  Maybe I should have kept the pimento juice for more flavor.  Next time I will follow other reviewers and use the juice.  I like that it is a lot cheaper to make than it is to buy in the grocery store.

made this and took to work for our "Summer Tomato Sandwich Day".  Everyone loved it.  I used fresh pimento peppers (about a 1/2 of one) and fresh roasted garlic instead of the garlic powder.

Wonderful! The original recipe is great on its own, but this time I added 2 minced green onions and 1 minced serrano pepper to add a little kick. I also substituted fresh red bell pepper for the pimento and served with crackers. It was yummy!

I halved this recipe to use up some ingredients.  I had to use chopped green olives in lieu of the pimentos.  Served on raw carrots and celery.  This was very good and very easy to make.  Thanks for sharing, KANDRSMOM!

We love this...but 2 cups of cheese is not enough.  I use 2 cups of sharp cheddar, and 2 cups of mont. jack/colby cheese.

Wonderful Pimento cheese,of course the longer it say the better it got.  Served it on sour dough bread and bagels...yummy!  My only complaint was it was really hard to spread on regular bread, hence the bagels.  Honestly even with the spread this will be my go to recipe from now on...thanks for sharing!!

Yummy!  I've never cared for regular pimento cheese  (don't like cold processed cheese or the sweetness of pimentos), but I had to try this one when I saw the ingredients.  Mine isn't regular pimento cheese because I used some diced green olives (with pimentos in the center!) instead, but the great thing about cooking is that you can tailor recipes to your tastes.  In any case, this is a great cheese spread.  I like it in sandwiches, on crackers, rolled up in a tortilla, or heated up to dip tortilla chips into or made into a quesadilla.  Quite versatile.  I also up the garlic powder to 1/2 t and like to add a little cayenne or hot sauce.

My family loved it! I have to confess to never trying the store bought variety, so have nothing to compare it to, but I tried it on celery and crackers. Delicious! Make sure you chill it before eating to let the flavors blend.

Made this for the first time and used a few suggestions as others pointed out, I added a pinch of cayenne, and a dash of Worcestershire.  I also would recommend using a high quality of shredded cheese so that it mixes well.

My favorite pimento cheese recipe.  My Husband loves this every time I make it.  Very easy to make and the secret is whipping the cream cheese and mayo first.  It is a very light, creamy recipe that is wonderful on soft white bread or with crackers as a dip.

I was excited to find this recipe & all the wonderful reviews because I grew up eating my mom's pimento & cheese, in which she always used Velveeta & Miracle Whip. I was looking for something similar but more "grown up" and less "processed".  This recipe just didn't do it for me. I followed the recipe exactly except I did not drain the pimentos. I thought the extra sharp cheddar overpowered the delicate flavor of the pimentos & it was too dry. After letting it sit awhile & tasting again, I still didn't care for it. I tried doctoring it by adding more mayo, sugar, then freshly cracked black pepper & even a splash of Worcestershire sauce & paprika, trying it over & over.

This is amazing.  Keep beating to make it nice and smooth.  I added a little onion powder and cayenne pepper to spice it up like others suggested.  Also a little bit of the liquid from the pimento, but not all.  Thank you for the easy and wonderful recipe.

This was good.  I didn't have cayenne to add, as others suggested, but I think it would have given it a nice kick.

This is a keeper.  I add chopped olives, a bit of the juice, and a dash of cayenne.  A hit at my Christmas buffet.  Very very good.

Best pimento cheese!  I agree that a dash of cayenne pepper in this is amazing.  (I usually do that on day 2 if I have any left!!!)

This was good as is, but I thought the cream cheese kind of overpowered everything else and it was a little thicker than I like my pimento cheese. So I decided to add a couple tablespoons of sweet pickle relish and thin it down just a bit with a little milk. After I did that it was fantastic and it still had that wonderful creamy texture. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty. I used this for my "Fried Mac and Cheese Balls". I scaled the servings down to 1 serving and came out with about 1/3 cup. My daughter and I ate the rest with crackers because we only needed 1/4 cup.
