Wow what a great and versatile recipe this is.  The other reviews noted that they may try honey in place of sugar and olive oil.  I did both these tweaks and it was great.  Now just remember if you smell from the jar there is a strong vinegar smell but do not worry the blend works great and I did not find it over powering at all.

This was very good but I changed it up a little bit. I used a pint of fresh raspberries and added about 3 or 4 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar to it. Mashed it with a fork and let it sit for about 15 minuted. Then I strained it to get all the seeds out and added the rest of the ingredients.

This was delicious. Very tangy and fruity and slightly sweet without really being sweet. I only made enough for 1 salad, but wish now that I had extra for another meal. I used 1/2 regular dijon mustard and 1/2 honey to make my own honey dijon, and garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. This was sooo Yummilicious!

I followed the recipe with two variations:  I used honey instead of brown sugar, and avocado oil instead of vegetable oil.  I believe olive oil would make a nice contribution to the flavors and shade some of the brightness of this tangy-sweet dressing, and I may do that next time.  I served the dressing over fresh spinach and fruit, and it was a nice accompaniment to our salad.

I did make one change: I used lemon olive oil in place of the vegetable oil.  Otherwise I followed directions.  Yummy stuff!  Do not try this if you are iffy about balsamic vinegar!  I loved this and know that I have other family members (not hubby, however) who'll love this!  Thanks, WeatherMaven!

Dee-Li-Cious!!
Very syrup-y so it clings to the greens really nicely. I did have to substitute Dijon+honey for the Honey Dijon. But otherwise made as written. *I used Avocado oil which is super healthy and tasteless.
I was trying to duplicate Portillo's Raspberry Vinaigrette however I think this version is better! Much appreciate the recipe!!

I love the richness of this dressing. The brown sugar and good raspberry vinegar add a deep home made flavor. My new “go to”.

I'm not crazy about salads, but a good salad dressing can make a salad actually appetizing.  This is one of only a few dressings that I enjoy.   Only change I made was to subsitute the honey mustard for 1/2 & 1/2 dijon mustard and honey as I don't have honey mustard.

Yum! No changes and doubled it! Make sure you use good balsamic vinegars, no cheap stuff, it really does make a difference.

Great Recipe.   I made it with Blackberry Balsamic as that is what I had.   Also did not have honey mustard so added a bit of honey.   I'm making it now for the second time.

I needed a vinaigrette recipe for the mulberry vinegar I have and this worked very well! Next time I may add a touch of salt, but otherwise I would change nothing. Thanks for a great recipe!
