this is definitely a 5-star, skipped the bacon though, and added garlic powder.this is best hamburger recipe by far, and the meat holds together nicely, no need for eggs or bed crumbs!

VERY GOOD..NEXT TIME I MIGHT MIX THE COOKED BACON IN WITH THE BURGERS INSTEAD OF PUTTING IT ON TOP.

Great recipe! Grilled them on my George Foreman & my husband loved them. The seasoning gave the burgers a little bite which was nice. Thanks so much!

Yummy! I don't think I will make burgers any other way. Skipped the bacon, but added chopped shallot into the burger.

Very good!  I confess I didn't even measure - just threw the ingredients in with the meat.  Who would have thought that just a few simple ingredients would result in such a great burger - even my 14 year old burger critic daughter loved them!
Grilled to perfection and served on toasted Kaiser rolls, this can't be beat!

The taste was GREAT and my whole family loved them however I had trouble keeping them from falling apart when I was grilling them. Also, like other users I did not put the bacon on top simply because I do not like it that way.

A great tasting, juicey burger the perfect combo. I could eat the best tasting burger in the world, and if it was dry I would not eat it or make it again.

YUMMY! My husband even liked it. Omitted the bacon and added a little bit of onion for taste and moisture and they turned out wonderfully! This is a keeper!

We really loved these hamburgers! Great texture, and with the addition of the ketchup there wasn't any need for a binder like an egg or breadcrumbs. These had a good balance between being moist, but not like a meatloaf, and being just dry enough, but not falling apart. We grilled them outdoors tonight, but these would be great to make on an indoor grill also when the weather is too cold to be outside. I will definitely make these again sometime.

We liked this recipe but I thought it needed something else. I would make it again though maybe I'll add more seasoning next time.
