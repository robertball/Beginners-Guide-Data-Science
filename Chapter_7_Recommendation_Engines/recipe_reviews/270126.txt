I must admit that I was a little intimidated by this recipe, but I followed it and loved the taste of the rice pudding.  However, I made some alterations.  I LOVE cinnamon in my rice pudding, so I added about 1/2 teaspoon when I added the milk, sugar, and salt. I was not disappointed.  Since my sons and I prefer our rice pudding to be very creamy, I added an additional 1/2 c. of whole milk and and additional 1/2 c. of heavy whipping cream.  Wow, is that decadent!  I think that the recipe as written has great flavor, I just like mine creamier.  Thank you so much for taking the time to submit this recipe!!!

Nice to use leftover rice and the Instant Pot, but I feel that this recipe calls for too much rice. Next time I will use only  2 or 2.5 cups of rice instead. The way the recipe is written, the texture leaves much to be desired. I added a sprinkle of nutmeg to each serving along with the cinnamon and it was great.

I made this rice pudding and honestly it did not turn out the way I had hoped. It's ok but I added more vanilla, more sugar, raisins, more cinnamon, and extra cream so basically I doubled the ingredients for just 2 cups of cooked rice.  I did not like the yellow colour the yolks gave to it. Sorry I am used to a creamy cinnamon flavoured rice pudding that can be eaten  warm or cold.
