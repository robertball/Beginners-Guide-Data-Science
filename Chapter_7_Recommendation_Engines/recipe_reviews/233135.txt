1-23-2016 ~Great combination of flavors, colors and textures. In lieu of "salad seasoning mix" I used Jane's Krazy Mixed Up Salt, tho' I think many seasoning blends would  work just fine.  I really have no clue what "dill seasoning mix" is so I used fresh dill.  I chose to add red bell pepper, with its sweeter, milder flavor than green pepper, and I omitted the carrots because we're not fond of them.  I chose to chop rather than mash the eggs.  Very nice!
