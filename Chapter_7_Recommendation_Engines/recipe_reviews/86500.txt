Super easy and grilled potatoes always make great side dish! I usually microwave my potatoes a bit to speed up the cooking time.  I used olive oil instead of veg. oil.  Whatever seasonings you have on hand will work.  I used some salt, pepper, garlic, and rosemary.  I had a small foil baking tin that I covered with foil vs. a foil packet and it worked out perfectly.

15 minutes on each side is MORE then enough time.  They were very good, just a little burnt in spots. We will try them again.

Used regular potatoes. Diced the onions instead of cutting into wedges. Added salt and fresh ground black pepper. Put everything into foil and put in my oven instead of on the grill. No clean up.
