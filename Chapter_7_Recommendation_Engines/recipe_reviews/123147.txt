Bf loved this, so I'm going to make it again.  It's easy enough, and I have a ton of homemade ranch seasoning.  I do agree it's a bit salty, but you could decrease some of the ranch seasoning to address that.  I did add fresh minced garlic, and probably will add more next time.  Thanks!

Grabbed a couple of beautiful Italian long rolls from the freezer from the best Italian bakery in Milwaukee, mixed up some butter with a Tuscan seasoning blend I love, and this was the final component to my quick, easy and delicious supper of "Italian Sausage and Zucchini" and "Chive Cucumber Salad," also from this site. While this bread won't replace the traditional garlic bread I prefer, it still was quite tasty with this seasoning - not sure I would have liked it with the Ranch.

I used just a plain old loaf of whole wheat breat for this. I only used 1/4 of the ranch dressing mix and added some parsley. Turned out pretty good and very easy since I used the bread I had on hand. Will make again. Thanks.

This was pretty good, but it was too salty.

I use 1 1/2 sticks of butter and 1 envelope of dry ranch dressing. Makes enough for 2 loaves of bread. We love it. I made it for a church group and everyone was asking for the recipe.

Ooops!  I accidentally melted the butter instead of just softening it, so I had to brush the mixture onto the bread.  The footnote said that dry Italian dressing could be substituted for Ranch, and I did that because that's what I had on hand.  We thought it was very good and a nice change of pace from regular garlic bread.

I used the first 3 ingredients to taste on some hamburger buns, as recommended by an Allrecipes member on the buzz, and toasted them in a pan for hamburgers. It made the best tasting buns for the hamburgers along with the condiments.

Spooned this ranch butter over baked store bought crecents that I rolled into twisted knots, it was a hit with our dinner company.  Will use this recipe again.

Oh, my!!  This is delicious.  I only had some leftover slices of french bread - so I buttered one side, grilled it butter side up until melted and flipped it for some quick grill marks!!  The kids raved, too!!

WAY TOO SALTY and the taste was just weird - basically bread dipped in very salty ranch dressing!!!!!!  So sorry but really didn't like it although I gave it 2 stars because if the ratios were right and you like ranch bread this would probably be good.

This bread is SOOO good. Make sure to watch it closely, I burned it badly the first time (5 minutes). Second time, I broiled it for about 3 mins and it turned out great!!!
