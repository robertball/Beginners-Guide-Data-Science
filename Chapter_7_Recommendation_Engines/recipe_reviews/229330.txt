It’s summer, and there are a lot of salads, sandwiches, and soups served in this house.  I made half a recipe specifically for meatloaf sandwiches, good old-fashioned comfort food.  Since 1 lb will not fill up a regular-size loaf pan, I baked in two mini loaf pans and reached the 160 degree temperature in about 30 minutes.  The only change I made was using Heinz Chili Sauce instead of ketchup, and I might add a little chopped garlic next time.  If you don’t overbake, this really is a moist meatloaf and made some tasty sandwiches.  Jessica, thanks for sharing your recipe.

It should be a 5 star, but I didn't use green pepper or sage, because I did not have any. 
I ended up making 2 loaves and baking them in a casserole dish. They turned out wonderful. I don't like meatloaf much, but the fiance loves it, so I try to make it occasionally. And i enjoyed this recipe! And  the easiness of this recipe. Oh, before i put the ketchup on top of the meat, I spread a little brown sugar over it. Not much just enough to lightly cover the top. Then I put the ketchup on and baked it. And put more ketchup on near the end of baking too! I also added cheddar  cheese to the mix. I've made this again tonight. In the oven right now!

I usually make my meatloaf different every time I make it, so this time I thought I'd follow a recipe. It was good, but for my taste there was too much green pepper. I would also have sautéed the onions and peppers before adding them to the meat. They were not cooked thoroughly, and again, that's a personal preference.

This is one of our family favorites! I don't like green peppers so I don't include them, but apart from that we make this at least a couple time a month and we love it! Even the 2 and 4 year olds love it

Simple. Easy. Great flavor.  Used Onion soup mix instead of chopped onion and salt.  Did the recipe with my 12 yr old son.  So easy.

Very good and very moist! This was such a hit!  We love onions and bell pepper and may add more the next time we make it!

The flavor and texture was okay, but when I removed it from the oven, not only had the loaf shrunk in the pan, it was absolutely swimming in grease. I had to scrape off most of the ketchup I had spread before baking because the top was absolutely covered in the grease, and it had mixed itself in with the ketchup. Very soggy mess, and it looked altogether unappealing and unappetizing. Still salvageable and edible, but I followed the recipe, and it didn't give any guidance on how to avoid this incident or what to do about it. That's the main downfall for me, because I've never had this happen with any other meatloaf recipe.

I skipped the green peppers, just don't like them, and used cracker crumbs in stead of bread because that's easier.  And it turned out great...everyone loved it.
