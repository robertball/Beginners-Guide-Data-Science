I made this recipe tonight, and my husband loved it.  It reminded us of lasagna.  I used medium shells for the pasta.  I added onion and garlic powder to the meat.  I added 1 14.5oz can diced tomatoes and only 1/2 jar of sauce.  I sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top.  I will definitley make this again.  Thanks!

My husband and I loved this and ate for  the leftovers for the next day's lunch and dinner. I did tweak it a little, since reading that some people thought it a bit bland. I first sauteed onions and bell peppers in olive oil until it started to carmelize before adding the beef to brown. I then seasoned the beef with garlic, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. I used a spaghetti sauce that had lots of veggies in it, and used diced tomatoes instead of stewed. I also used penne pasta. It was soooo flavorful and was great with crusty bread.

I used the spiral noodles as you suggested.  This was a really quick and easy recipe that was a hit with my husband.  I added some shredded cheddar cheese with the mozzarella cheese on top.  I also added a half chopped green bell pepper and half chopped onion for extra taste.

My family loved this recipe, and they are picky eaters. I did not add the mushrooms but put in 1 cup of water with the uncooked noodles and put it all in my crockpot on low for 6 hours, turned out superb.

Easy lunch recipe! I took the advice of "cook from Cape Cod" = added some garlic, peppers and onions (great addition!!). I liked the tomatoes in this recipe and highly recommend that they're included.  Although I used the hamburger- I think the use of Italian sausage would be a better ingrediant! Thanks for the easy recipe Pamela!

This dish was great. I fried the mushrooms with onions first, then added it the ground beef and spaghetti sauce. I'll definitely make this one again.

The family loved this one! It was a hit with my husband and three daughters. I used the Barilla Plus rotini to give it an even healthier kick. Also added diced onion, pressed garlic, thyme and a dash of salt while browning. Substituted one large can of Tuttorosso for the jarred sauce and stewed tomatoes. We had more than half of the casserole left over, and the amount we ate included 2nds for the girls. Next time I will definately split it into 2 trays and freeze one for later!

This was easy, but we found it a little bland. It wasn't bad, we ate it and I will probably have it for leftovers, but I think it needs some spicing up, maybe some onion and garlic, a little more salt.  It was okay tasting. It might even matter the brand of Italian tomatoes and sauce that is used how much flavor you get.

This was a good base for a casserole.  I, like many others, added diced onions and a bell pepper.  One thing I did add, which I thought really helped the dish, was about 6 ounces of sour cream to the pasta mixture before I baked it in the oven.  It lent a certain creaminess to the casserole without being too overpowering.  Make sure you season the beef well, as it was a little lacking in flavor.

I added Taco Seasoning to the beef for a bit of a kick which was perfect.  This lasted most of the week for our family of 2 adults and 2 kids (5+3).  Perfect for meal planning.

This recipie was really tasty. Although I thought a lb. of noodles was too much. I used 3/4 of a bag and it turned out good. A change from regular speghetti. Thanks.

This is your basic run of the mill Goo-Losh.  In order to make it taste like anything you gotta add enough onion powder and garlic powder with a little green pepper with onions to make it taste anything.   To many additions to make this anything else.  Sorry, I'll make my own Goo-Losh from now on.

My store didn't have any 32 oz. jars of spaghetti sauce, so I used a 26 oz. can and that worked well.  (I know I could have measured it out but I wanted to not have an extra open can.)  I also sauteed the mushrooms in butter before adding them in.

This is super yummy!!! I browned the meat with garlic, season salt and black pepper. I also cooked in a seperate pan with a little water and olive oil, and a pinch of sage- red, green yellow peppers, with onions. then mixed the meat into it, used diced tomatoes and a splash of tomato soup for a bit more liquid. I also like to use a little sugar in spaghetti sauce recipes to cut down on the acidity. Oh man it was yummy!

My family loved this recipe.  I cooked a 14 oz. box of whole grain rotini but didn't use all of it because it was too much pasta for the amount of sauce. I also added garlic and onions.  I thought it needed more seasoning so next time I'll add some basil and oregano or italian seasoning.

I did not have high expectations for this.  A sick friend gave me some hamburg and rotini and asked me to make something for her and her husband.  I found this recipe, added chopped onions, minced garlic, salt and cumin to the meat.  Used 1 jar of Newman's Marinara Sauce, 1 large can of tomato sauce, and one large can of diced tomatoes.  I added a container of sliced baby portabello mushrooms.  Mixed it all with the cooked pasta, and covered generously with lots of mozzarella.  There was plenty because I doubled the recipe, so my husband I got to eat it, too, and so did two of our neighbors!  I could not believe how tasty and filling it was.  And so easy to fix!  This is now on my regular schedule.....

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I browned the beef first then removed it to a plate while I cooked some chopped onions and minced garlic.  I also added a chopped zucchini and yellow bell pepper that I had on hand then added the beef back to the pan and mixed in the sauce.  After sprinkling on the cheese I also sprinkled some seasoned breadcrumbs on top.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was delicious, though I agree with others that a green pepper and onion would add some flavor. Overall, it was very easy and tasty. I served it with dinner rolls. http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Herb-Pull-Apart-Rolls-Video/Detail.aspx

This is a great quick and easy recipe. I didn't have quite enough ground beef so I added some red kidney beans and seasoned it up with garlic, onions, cumin, and some chili powder.

Easy is right, and a real hit with the kiddos! Seconds were served all around.  I used wagon wheel pasta, a pound like the recipe called for, but found it was way too much, so I only used about half of what I cooked.  Also, I didn't have stewed tomatoes, so I just threw in a can of diced tomatoes, and it worked just fine.  Thumbs up from my family!

Everyone loved this one. I read the reviews and decided to add garlic and basil to the meat, used a veggie sauce and I only had diced tomatoes on hand. This will be a regular now in my house. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe tonight and enjoyed it. I did a couple things different though, I added garlic salt to the sauce and fresh minced garlic and onion to the meat. For pasta I used wheat spiral pasta. I also used half the pasta and twice the cheese. Very easy to make and delicious! Thanks for sharing!

This is a regular in my house, so easy but I always have to add more sauce.  Also like to add basic Italian seasonings to the meat while cooking.  Cheddar cheese on top tastes good too!

I followed some of the advise from the comments and added onions and bell pepper, even a little bit of wine and just a bit of Parmesan cheese on top. It was good, I'll cook this again.

We thought it was a very good casserole.  Better, it was easy!  Didn't have stewed tomatoes so I subbed diced tomatoes.  I liked Anna's idea of adding black olives so I sliced about 3/4 of a can of them.  I used a 12 oz package of 'musical' pasta as I wanted to use it up.  Any pasta would work great with this dish.  Thanks for the post!

This was a hit with adults and kids alike at our house. I altered the recipe slightly by adding in 5 dashes of Frank's hot sauce and a tsp of both basil and oregano. I left out the mushrooms because the kids would think those were icky and opted to serve steamed brocolli and garden salad on the side. We found the portions to be very large. I made the recipe following the ingredients list for 5 serving but between the four of us we ate less than half the casserole with my husband and I both having seconds. That's OK, though, because we like having leftovers for lunches.

Good recipe, will use again. I doubled the recipe but did not use as much sauce as the recipe called for. It just seem to be to much sauce. I used 1 pound of hamburger and 1 pound of italian sausage, instead of all hamburger. Was even better the next night.

I'm not sure if I read the amount of pasta wrong to use, but it seemed that I had way too much cooked pasta for everything else.  If I make it again I would probably use about 3/4 the amount of pasta, so that it is coated more with the sauce and other ingredients.  Other than that it was good.  I added some more seasoning, since I thought it might be a bit bland.

We like seasoning in my house, so I spice it up a bit. As an all-in-one dish, I like to throw in chopped green and red pepper and onions. I can then get away with just serving it with bread and call it a balanced meal ;)

This recipe was very quick and easy to make and tasted pretty good. I did use a little less pasta and canned mushrooms instead of fresh (which I drained). I also used regular stewed tomatoes since that's all I had on hand, so I just added some extra oregano, garlic and basil to the sauce. Next time I think I may stir some extra cheese into the pasta mixture to make it a little bit cheesier. Overall, this is a great recipe to keep on hand when you don't have much time and need something fast.

This was a good recipe. Things I will change next time: use less pasta- I like plenty of sauce and for my tastes a pound of pasta was too much for the amount of sauce; in fact it wouldn't all fit my my 9x13 casserole dish; use a heartier bottled sauce or sprinkle in some Italian seasoning to make the sauce a little tastier.

Very Tasty!! My husband and I loved it and he wants leftovers for supper tonight. I used sliced mozzeralla and layered with the meat and pasta mixture so it was good and cheesy. I added garlic powder and salt and pepper to the meat also. We enjoyed it. Thanks Paula for sharing it!!

I tried this tonight and added a chopped onion and 3 cloves of chopped garlic.It was great, fast easy and taste much like lasagna, but you don't have to build it in layers.I made it in 2-8x8 pans and shared one with my neighbor.

Quantity-wise it made plenty, but it didn't awaken any hidden tastebuds.  A little bland.

I didn't put the sauce in and just used extra diced tomatoes with lots of roasted garlic. This was delicious and the family loved it.

I hadn't read the other reviews before making it, but it sounded easy.  I was trying to cook up some ground beef I had that was about to spoil if I didn't use it.  I added fresh minced garlic to the ground beef and some garlic powder to the sauce mixture.  It was so easy and tasted good.  Thanks so much for the great recipe-I will make it again!

Not only yummy, but easy as well.  Followed the recipe as stated.  With only these additions, added 1 tablespoon of dried basil, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon of ground Thyme & 3 cloves of roughly chopped garlic.  This recipe is so versatile that one can tailor it to their preference as far the meat in using ground turkey and/or sausage.   What I love the most is the fact of addition of mushrooms.  As so hard finding pasta casseroles with mushrooms.   Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe with us all.

Super easy and good.  I did add green pepper, onion and garlic and with those simple additions it was very good.   Thanks for the recipe.

I agree with those who added peppers. If I make this again, then I will also try using different pasta. Overall easy to make. - Daniel

A solid 4 stars, and only because I made some changes. I sautéed garlic, onions and bell peppers before browning the beef. Then put in tomatoes, black pepper, salt, chili powder, and dried oregano (to taste). Then added the pasta sauce to warm for a few minutes. I followed the recipe afterwards and I liked it a lot. I used cavatappi pasta, and it is visually more appealing than cylindrical or shell pasta... Otherwise I don't think it matters. I will make again, maybe with more cheese!

This dish was delicious! I used diced tomatoes instead of stewed and used ground turkey instead of beef.  It still came out great! My family loved it and there was pleanty of leftovers for the next days lunch & dinner.

This was really good. I seasoned it a bit more than the recipe called for. Everyone was pleased with this one in our house.

This was okay. We had it with rotini and it was basically Baked Ziti. I would probably add ground turkey to add a different flavor.

We LOVED it.  The only few changes I made was to add some garlic and basil. I squished up the stewed tomatoes with my hands and dumped them in !!  I used "Nanny Spaghetti Sauce" for the base.  This sauce has become our new favorite.  Really good and very easy.

This reminded me of my spaghetti and lasagna recipes combined together.  I seasoned the beef with a little garlic pepper and then added a chopped bell pepper and half an onion.  I did not have shredded cheese but I used slices and everything turned out good.  Quick and simple.
