This recipe needs a lot of adjustments. In order for the zucchini boats not to be undercooked, (ie. crunchy)  they should be baking in the oven while the stuffing is prepared.  I half-cooked the sausage, if nothing else just to get it a little eaiser to mix with the rest of the ingredients.  I used a hot italian sausage and it really added to the flavor.  Decrease the amount of breadcrumbs by 1/2 I also reccomend adding roasted red peppers (chopped), fresh basil and sundried tomatoes (chopped) to the stuffing along with crushed red pepper flakes (about 1 tablespoon).  Also make sure you use a good quality tomato sauce and lots of extra cheese.  There is so much potential with this recipe you just have to make it your own.

This is delish as written! Thanks LTHASKINS!! I don't know why people write things in their reviews that they can't possibly know if they don't make it as written. If they want to use this recipe as a base and come up with a new one, post it as a different recipe. You DO NOT need to brown the meat first and you should know not to use a very large zucchini and expect it to cook in 45 minutes without precooking it some. It was also delicious with regular sausage and good mozzarella! Everybody loved it.

Awesome! This was met with mixed reviews from Sonny. Hubby and I couldn't get enough. This is very filling though. Made for dinner lastnight, this morning Sonny said "that was good dinner lastnight" We will make this again. Followed recipe exactly, browning sausage 1st. We used 3 zucchini about 5 inches in diameter and 9 inches long, filled our casserole dish completely. Thanks so much for this recipe.

Yum!  I made it pretty close to the original recipe (something unusual for me).  The only thing I changed were I used bulk Italian sausage and added an egg to the mixture.  Oh, and I upped the garlic (like triple or more) and added fresh basil to the sauce.  My recommendations- Use whatever sausage you like to start with.  Italian was great.  My friend Becky used Mushroom and Asiago that she got from Trader Joes.  I don't recommend Mozerella cheese.  Though it tasted fine, it resembled plastic on top.  My friend used jack cheese and it was great.  I love the sauce.  I want more of it (50-100 percent more.  We served it with Pasta.  My friend used brown Batsmati rice.  I liked them both, but the rice was better to me.  We just wanted more of that yummy sauce.

This is one of my husband's favorite recipes, and while we cook it mostly in the early summer months, he loves when I surprise him with it during the rest of the year also. I have never pre-cooked my meat, and it always turns out wonderful. Add a salad and some garlicy bread and it is more than a meal!  Great Recipe!!!

This was a good, basic recipe I used as a guide before tweaking to personalize to my tastes.  First, after halving the zucchini I microwaved them for a few minutes to pre-cook them a bit.  I browned the sausage, using Italian sausage I had removed from the casings.  To that I added chopped red and yellow bell pepper, onion and the garlic, more than called for, and some fresh herbs. I did chop the zucchini pulp and added that too.  I used no bread crumbs or other filler.  I mixed up the mozzarella and Parmesan, added some to the sausage mixture and reserved some to sprinkle over the top.  Rather than spaghetti sauce I used a good quality marinara, much less than 32 ounces, as I didn’t want the zucchini swimming in sauce.  I baked this, uncovered, for just over half an hour.  I served Hubs his over a bed of rice and left my low-carb version as is.  Delicious.

Yummy!  Even my kids loved it! I served this with garlic bread and pasta.  I cooked the sausage mixture first and reduced the baking time to 30 minutes.

I mostly followed this recipe. I had defrosted ground beef instead of sausage and I'm sure it would have been better with sausage. I also cooked my zucchini a bit in the oven in some water face down as it was the size of a tree and I didn't want it to be too tough. Also, I totally forgot the cheese...not sure how that happened...rough day, I guess. Anyway, it was good and I'll do it again. Thanks for reminding me of such a great way to use those monster zucchini that hide in my garden!

FYI: If you have problems with crunchy zucchini, split them lengthwise and par boil them before scraping centers, stuffing and baking them. This works well on larger zucchini and makes scraping centers much easier. Do not over cook, 2 minutes usually does it. I have used this method for 23 years and this step makes the recipe much easier. A great recipe to use up leftover spaghetti sauce and a bountiful zucchini harvest.

Good stuff. I used spicy Jimmy Dean sausage - which does NOT need to be browned first - and added a little garlic powder and black pepper. I used regular little zucchinis and found they were cooked perfectly after 40 mins. We had it with angel hair pasta. Thanks!

Would suggest using smaller zucchini as bigger ones are tough and stringy,   You can solve the problem of underbaked boats by par-baking them in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes.  Just salt and pepper them and add a splash of olive oil to the hollowed-out zucchini.   Cook the rest of your ingredients on the stove, minus the sauce and mozzarella, then stuff the boats.   Cover wit the sauce and mozzarella and and bake for 15 minutes more.

This is an excellent recipe.  One caution though.  One reviewer said you have to pre-cook your zucchini while preparing the stuffing to avoid the zucchini from coming out undercooked.  I know my zucchini..lol.  I grow it, I cook it, we eat it until it comes out of our ears.  Pre-cooking depends on the size of the zuck you're using.  If it's a small or medium size zuck there is no need to pre-cook.  45 mins in the oven in enough time for it to cook to perfection.  Perhaps if you're using a really large size zucchini from someone's garden then I can see pre-cooking a bit.  If you do pre-cook be sure to put a wee bit of water in the dish.  As for me, I usually saute' the sausage just a little to get rid of some of the fat before mixing with other ingredients and baking.  You don't have to though.  This is a really tasty recipe.  Think about trying turkey sausage too.

Excellent recipe as written.  We like our zucchini "crunchy" so didn't bake it quite as long: I checked it at about 40 minutes (stick a fork into the zucchini) and decided it was done enough. Put the cheese on, put it back in the oven til the cheese melted, and it was just fine.

The basic recipe is great for all sorts of adaptations.  I've made it with a ground beef "stuffing", using taco spices and a salsa top, with cheddar and jack as the cheese topping.  Another variation I've tried is with chopped chicken and mushrooms, and an alfredo sauce topping, and asiago/parmeson for the cheese topping.

Thanks for sharing it!

I cooked meat first to get some of the fat drained off and I probably used 2x the amount of mozz - I just throw it on until if feels right.  Absolutely DELICIOUS!  A keeper for sure.  Zucchini about size of a cucumber (about 1.5" in diameter and 8" long) and cooked just fine.

Delicious!  I didn't have a lot of excitement for this one, but I had a lot of zucchini to use so I tried it and was pleasantly surprised!  Tastes like lasagna, but so much healthier!

I liked this recipe. I used turkey instead of sausage for fat. I used the full cup of bread crumbs but everyone was right and I should have only used a half. I added diced tomatoes, mushrooms and onions. Of course, for my husband I used a bit more cheese on his slices. I did not cook the boats before I stuffed them but I did leave it in the oven for 5 minutes longer just in case. They turned out great

This was really good. I did change it up a little to make it healthier. I used lean ground beef instead of the pork and I used brown rice instead of bread crumbs. I also added a sauteed onion and 4 cloves of garlic.

Great way to use zucchini! Scraped the zucchini pretty thin so I wouldn't have a cooking issue and  mostly pre-cooked the sausage, along with diced onion and mushrooms. I made bread crumbs with my processor, using a hearty artisan type wheat bread. Only had 25oz jar of sauce and I don't think it needed any more. Baked for a total of 35 min, adding the mozzarella for the last 5 min. Family enjoyed it, but wants me to use a spicy sausage next time.

This is perfect. I used to teach cooking so trust me on this one. I'm going to add ground beef if I have it instead of sausage next time. Just adjust the seasonings. For the Garlic Bread as suggested for the finishing touch to the meal, first brush the bread with buttermilk then butter the slices or bread halves and top with fresh minced garlic and cheese of choice.  I'd suggest parmesean or mozerella. The buttermilk makes the supreme difference. At any rate between the stuffed zucchini and the bread ... it's the full meal deal!

This was a hit with the whole family! Will be adding this to our frequent list. I followed the recipe for ingredients but I did use Turkey Italian Sausage instead of the pork sausage, for a slightly healthier twist. I also followed the suggestions of cooking the zucchini first-sprinkled some salt on it and i baked it for about 30 min-while that was cooking I cooked the sausage, the insides of zucchini i had scooped out, garlic & added the bread crumbs (italian style) to the mixture. Scooped it into the zucchini "boats" added the sauce-(2 jars instead of one)and cooked for remaining 30 min. Added the cheese's last 5 min. This was awesome recipe!

This was so yummy and easy to make. I put it together and took it over to my boyfriend's house. All we had to do was add the sauce and pop it in the oven. I didn't precook the sausage, no need to, it will cook fine. All we had with it was some bread as everything else is in it. I used mild italian sausage, next time I'll use hot. This will definitely be a regular item on the menu. Perfect for entertaining as it can be made ahead of time and put in the oven without a lot of time spent in the kitchen. I recommend using small zucchinis rather than larger ones with big seeds.

Great recipe for an easy dinner. Just mix it together and put it in the oven. I made a few adjustments by using fresh diced chicken breast, adding 1 extra garlic clove, diced tomatoes, salt, pepper and extra cheese. I cooked it about an hour and a half to make sure the zucchini was tender. The zucchini was fresh from my garden and larger than what you purchase at the store. Made a tossed salad and garlic bread for an amazing meal. I have used ground chuck(browned) which is also excellent. Thanks for the recipe. My son who doesn't like veggies actually asked for this. I would give it a 10 out of 5!!!

Have made this countless times. It is amazing. Always can't wait for the fresh zucchini from the garden every summer to make my first batch of the year!

This was a great dish but I heavily modified the instructions.  I cooked the sausage & then sauteed the zucchini insides with the cooked sausage and extra garlic.  I am LCHF so I did 1/3 c. italian seasoned breadcrumbs, 1/3 c. almond flour instead of the breadcrumbs the recipe calls for.  I coated the 13x9 dish with olive oil before adding the overstuffed zucchini shells.  I spooned just enough 4 cheese pasta sauce over the shells to cover the stuffing & edges of zucchini so I didn't need to use as much tomato sauce.  I did  not cover with foil & only cooked for 25 mins so the zucchini stayed firm & crisp.  Big hit with the hubby too!

I usually make a recipe as written the first time but I had leftovers that I needed to use.  I used 2 large 9 inch long zucchinis trimmed to fit in my pan sideways.  After cutting in half I microwaved for 5 minutes.  It makes scooping easier and more even.  Using a good sausage made this dish.  I used jalapeno sausage from my local butcher, removed from their casings.  Added 1 cup leftover cooked rice, scooped zucchini, 1 cup leftover chopped grilled veggies (red, yellow and green peppers, onion, yellow squash and zucchini) and half a jar of pasta sauce.  Stuffed, covered with remaining sauce and cooked as directed.  Used a little more cheese than called for on top to cover everything.  I did NOT brown the sausage first and it was fully cooked.  Served with salad and garlic bread.  Because I used cooked rice instead of bread crumbs it was a little loose and juicy but my guys loved it that way and sopped up the juice with the garlic bread.

My 13 year old, who is a wonderful cook and usually tries anything, hates zucchini and refused to have any.  I finally convinced him take 2 bites of mine and he was hooked!  He even went back for seconds and declared that we needed to put this into our cooking rotation.  Thank you for a very creative, delicious and sneaky way to get my family to eat more veggies.

This was surprisingly good with some changes, which is why I couldn't give it 5 stars.  I crumbled and cooked the sausage in a sauté pan first -- completely.  Undercooked pork is nothing to fool around with and why not take the step for safety? It does nothing to diminish the flavor. I may try chicken sausage next time so I'll certainly cook that first. Next I used two slices of double fiber whole grain bread pulsed to fine crumbs in my ninja pro and added that to the sausage and insides of the zucchini. To that I added a handful of fresh basil leaves chopped, garlic powder, onion powder and dried oregano. I added one large egg and about 1/4 cup half and half to make the stuffing wetter -- like stuffing should be heading into the oven. While I was preparing the stuffing and preheating the oven, I had the zucchini shells baking to ensure they would be soft in the end. I removed the shells and stuffed them before pouring spaghetti sauce over the top. I baked them for about 40 minutes at 400 degrees and then covered with a bag of shredded Italian cheese blend until it was melted (I had six zucchini shells of varying sizes stuffed). This was a great dinner and is especially friendly to those who are watching carbs. I saw no need to put this over pasta or rice. UPDATE: I now add a ricotta mixture just as you would to lasagna & top w/ stuffing & sauce. It's excellent. High protein & low carb.

This is one of our favorite recipes.  I've made it atleast 20 times!  I make a few changes to make it healthier...I use turkey sausage and only use 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.  I also omit the parmesean cheese.  We use 4 large zucchini (I pick the 4 roundest ones at the store) but only use the seeds from 3 of them.  Otherwise, I just find it too seedy and not enough sausage.  I also add a shake of red pepper flakes.  I do not cook the sausage first.  I cook about an hour in the oven, sprinkle with a little cheese at the end.  Comes out perfect everytime!  Very tasty dinner for very little carbs.

I got a gigantic zucchini from a neighbor's garden & was looking for a main dish recipe. I made this according to the recipe & it was delicious! Hubby is not crazy about zuc's & loved it. I did not pre-cook the meat, don't need to...the mixture becomes like a meatloaf & makes it very easy to stuff. Also, no egg is needed as a binder, the squash seeds do the job. I also used garlic powder instead of cloves, just because that's all I had on hand. Note...this still works with a really large zuc...I halved mine by length, then quartered. I scraped out the seeds (removing lg ones) & then hollowed out a bit more to make it deeper & thinner. It was cooked perfectly in 50 min. I sautéed the extra pork mixture for later use in spaghetti sauce. Finally, I can see that this is a really flexible recipe that could be easily adjusted based on what's in the fridge. Love it & definitely making again!

I totally revamped this recipe amd it was so delicious.  I made my own marinara sauce.  Then I followed some of the others advice and cooked the zuccini and some portabello mushrooms in some water in the oven.  As I did that I sauted the sausage 10 links and 4 hot fennel links.  I used the fat from the sausage to saute garlic, onions, the inside of the zuccini and portabello untill soft. I mixed that with the sausage about 1/2 c of locatelli and 1/2 c seasoned bread crumbs.  I stuffed the veggies with the mix and put the sauce in the pan to keep moist.  When they were cooked I put the mutz cheese on and broiled till bubbly.  The family loved it and Because my zuccini were so large I froze a tray for a later date.  Yummy

I grew up on a recipe very similar to this. We didn't cut the zucchini in half we cut the top off at the thin end and used a melon scooper to pull out the middle and stuffed it with a mixture of plain tomato sausce with rice , hamburger and kinda a lot of garlic salt. be sure the mixture is loose because the rice swells and uses up most of the moisture.Then we  cover it with tomato sauce and we either simmer it on the stove top, covered, For a long time till the zuccchini is tender or bake it in the oven.Either way it is delish. It is called Koosa in our family

I loved the way this turned out!  The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it fails to mention that the meat should be browned first.  I used ground turkey instead and I browned it on a skillet, drained off the excess grease and threw the zucchini seeds onto the skillet and cooked them for a few minutes with the meat.  Also, 1 cups of bread crumbs seemed to be too much.  I think I might have used about 1/4- 1/2 cup each of cheese and breadcrumbs..I just added enough to make the filling more solid and didn't really measure.  It tased great!

I used ground Italian sausage for flavor but pre-cooked it and rinsed it to reduce the fat.  I also drained a lot of the liquid out of the scooped out zucchini before mixing it with the sausage, etc.  And I increased the cheese!  Next time I think I will take the advice of others and prebake/grill the zucchini a bit before stuffing it b/c I found it a little crunchy/squeaky.  Overall a great way to use up zucchini when the garden is producing so many!

I have made this twice now.  Both times I used large zucchini from the garden.  I used Italian sausage (once spicy, the other added hot pepper) and browned it with onion and garlic.  The second time I went ahead and browned the seeds.  I scooped the zucchini 'boats' really thin for quicker cooking.  Baked for about 30 min.  I also added a little water in the bottom of the dish before baking.  The first time I forgot to put the cheese on the top and it was still delicious.  Makes great leftovers as well!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a great recipe but can be slimmed down quite a bit.  I used chicken sausage instead of pork and used egg as a binder instead of bread crumbs.  still very good but cuts down on the carbs and fat quite a bit.

I made this recipe twice now. I never knew that stuffing zucchini was so easy. The first time I made it I used Italian sausage made from pork. It was fabulous. I tried to make the recipe lower in fat by using Butterball Turkey sausage Italian style and it did not fly. There wasn't enough flavor. Next time I will use a different brand of turkey sausage to try to get more flavor OR give in and use pork sausage as mentioned in the recipe.
By the way, the round zucchini works well also and looks so nice on the plate. Thank you for introducing  me to a new recipe. Just love this site.

This was a winner! I did change it up a bit with sweet italian sausage, no bread crumbs, homemade pasta sauce, and some sauteed onions. I do think the zucchini needs to be precooked a bit longer as it was still pretty crunchy and watery after an hour of cooking. Flavor was great though, I'd make it again to use up those zucchini! Thanks for the recipe!

I made these and they were fabulous! I made a few changes and my family couldn't get enough. I used hot pork sausage, used 4 garlic cloves and Barilla Spicy Marinara sauce. It was so full of flavor and I had alot of filling so they were really stuffed. One of them filled me up. I doubled the recipe and was glad I did, because they were even better left over. This is a wonderful recipe!

For a healthier version try canned salmon instead of sausage.  Also you can easily cut back on the amount of meat, parmesan, mozzarella, bread crumbs and sauce you need to use.  I also used fresh basil, stewed tomatoes, and a little olive oil.  It was a hit at our house!

My family loves this recipe.  I missed one thing in the recipe and that was to add the seeds into the pork mixture.  I will try to do that next time but without the seeds it was still great. It is importatnt to cook covered (I made that mistake once also).  LOVE IT...Thank you!!

This dish is amazing! I usually add a 24 oz can of pasta sauce and a can of Italian diced tomatoes. Absolutely no reason to precook anything, though I would make sure the zucchini is spooned out well. Thanks so much! ***Edit after the sixth time, I've realized the sausage takes about 1 hour to reach 165 degrees.

Followed the recipe as written, it was very easy and good. My daughter loved it. It's a keeper because it uses a lot of things you have on hand already so you can throw it together quickly. I used mild Italian sausage but I'm sure you could use any meat you want. I would only use 1/2 the breadcrumbs next time. I had large zucchini so I baked them in the oven for 10 minutes while preparing the stuffing mixture (only deviation from the recipe), but did not brown the meat before hand and it was fine. I will definitely make again for quick easy dinner, but will probably add more spices to make it even better.

This was delicious!  We used hamburg instead of sausage (browned before adding to mixture).  We were looking for zucchini recipes because we had a ton from our garden.  This was one of our favorites and will definitely be a keeper.  It was filling enough on its own - no need for any sides.

Very good! Brown the sausage first in a pan. I've done it on the gas grill using a grill tray and foil. Cook the zucchini boats covered with foil about 30 minutes. Top with mozzarella and drizzle with warm sauce. Serve over thin spaghetti tossed with tomato - basil sauce.

This was delicious...in fact hubs said "restaurant quality meal"! I had two pretty big zucchini so I halved then split lengthwise...scooped middles & pulverized a few times in processor with the bread crumbs. I cooked the zucchini shells for a few minutes in micro (face down in a bit of water)...just to get a head start on softening. I used spicy turkey sausage and this rocked the whole dish! That and a semi-homemade sauce we keep on hand for our italian dishes. Perfect and delicious!!

I made this recently and if could give it ten stars I would! I did change a few things though. For starters I cut the bread crumbs in half. I was kind of in a hurry so I completely cook the spicy Italian sausage that I used. I couldn't find zucchini that was big enough so I used smaller zucchini. I cut out all of the seeds and threw them away. While cooking the sausage I put the raw zucchini in the oven for 15 minutes at 375 degrees. Next I mixed together the cooked meat, mozzarella cheese, and bread crumbs in a large moving bowl. I lined up the zucchini in a pan and poured this mixture over it. Afterwards I took 1/4 a jar of spaghetti sauce and poured it over the top. Once preheated to the appropriate temperature I place it in the over for 20 minutes, covered with tinfoil. Once it was done I pulled it out and sprinkled mozzarella cheese over the top and letting it sit for five minutes.

I've been looking for the IT recipe for stuffed zucchini and I found it here.  Made it as stated and it was phenomenal.  I got many requests for the recipe and was asked to make it again and again.  I could live on this!

Yeah.  Brown the meat first, drain, cook up some stove top, mix it together, make sure you add the insides of the zucchini with the meat and dressing mix.  Add a bit of sage to the mix, one egg and blend well, load into a blanched zuc, ( blanch zuch for at least a 1/2 hour to get insides ready to shread.  Top with some cheese of choice, bake at 350 for 1 hr and dig in!

Excellent!  My entire family loved this!  I used ground turkey since we just ate sausage two days prior, added some fresh basil, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I used two gigantic zucchini from my garden to make 4 boats and it was the perfect amount of filling.  (They didn't fit into a 9x13 pan so I used 2 cookie sheets but still covered them with foil and lined the pan with foil for easy clean-up.  Worked great!)

This is a good recipe.  As many reviewers point out, it is easily customizable.  I recommend trying cooked brown rice instead of the breadcrumbs as an option.

I did not care for this recipe. My gut instinct told me to discard the seeds and not add it into the stuffing. I didn't listen and of course I ended up not liking it. But it wasn't just because of the seeds, it was also because of the crunch factor with the zuchinni. I steamed it a little before to avoid it, guess I didn't steam it enough, it was still crunchy after it was baked. Next time, I'll omit the seeds and steam the zuchinni longer.

This is my first time to review and just had to after making the Stuffed Zucchini.  It was GREAT!  After reading reviews, I did cook the zucchini in the oven with a little water while I was making the stuffing (then drained the water) and only used 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs.  I also cooked the sausage half way (and used hot).  I also threw in a can of chopped water chestnuts (because I love them) and added shaved parm on top with the mozarella because I had some - used more cheese than the 1/2 cup stated.  I just served it with garlic bread and was full after only eating 1/2 of one boat (had 4 boats total which filled my 9x13 glass pan.  Just had the other half boat for lunch and it was just as good.  Will definitely make again and will probaby add onion.

This was a great recipe to start with.  I took the advice of another reviewer and baked the boats while preparing the stuffing (about 15 minutes), and I substituted chicken for the pork sausage, which I had cut into small pieces and only cooked so the outsides were white before adding to the mix.  The zucchini boats ended up slightly crunchy beneath everything else, and the whole dish was outstanding.  My wife was amazed.  Thanks.

I used what I had & made it Mexican Stye!

I used 2 9" x 7" (aprox) zuccini's, 2 fresh CHORIZO sausages (.60 .b) decased & cooked, when almost cooked I added a medium fresh red pepper & 1/4 medium sweet onion BOTH DICED, cooked together while finely dicing both 1 Lg. garlic bulb, and 1 small fresh serrano pepper from my garden. Once mixture was cooked I added the rest of the middle of the zuccinis I hollowed out w/a melon baller to the pa with about 1/4 crushed tortilla chips & about 6 crushed wheat crackers (to use them up).

HINT: I microwaved the zuccini's covered in a glass pan w/o water to soften, then brushed EVOO on them & grilled both sides for marks. Stuffed them with the mixture of both meat mix & zuccini w/tortilla & cracker crumbs - topped with shredded cheddar/montery jack cheese - wrapped LOOSELY in foil so the cheese wouldn't stick to heat through & melt cheese. While they cooked I grilled a couple garden plum tomatoes. They were ready pretty much right before the zuccini & I also topped the tomatoes with fresh oregano, & basil. Oh yeah....I also put fresh oregano & fresh thyme on the inside of the zuccini afte they were grilled & before stuffing them.........EXCELLENT & DOESN'T HEAT UP YOUR HOUSE USING THE OVEN!!!  Corn would be great &/or beans as a filling w/the meat too!

I used a 1.45 package of hot sausage, I substituted the garlic for 1 med. white onion, and added one fresh tomato w/ 1 packet of Goya beef bouillon. I fried that first, then I hollowed out one extra large zucchini and added it to the meat mixture w/ one packet of Goya sazon. Fry until all vegetables are disintegrated. I didn't use any bread crumbs. I put a thin layer of sauce, laid the zucchini down, filled with mixture, top w/ Italian cheese mix, and spooned sauce over, covered w/ foil, and bake for 45 min, remove foil and top w/ more cheese and bake till golden brown.

loved the ingredients and the idea of it but I found the zucchini to be too bitter for this to be good.  Maybe it's just what we get in MN (I've tried this a couple of time) but I use this same recipe with bell peppers and enjoy much better

We really liked this for dinner tonight.  I did as another reviewer suggested and put the zucchini in the oven while I was prepping the sausage, just to give them a head start.  I did not cook my sausage, and it was just fine.  Even my 4 year old loved this! 

Thanks for a great recipe!

I decreased the Parmesan by a lot. We don't like it THAT much. This was basically pizza on a zucchini, but it had too much sausage. Also, I cooked it for an hour or more, and some of the zucchini was still crunchy. That makes me worry that maybe the sausage wasn't done (how do you tell when it's gray to begin with?). The very thought kind of makes me sick to my stomach. And the pizza toppings kind of highlighted the bitter aftertaste of the zucchini, and that was disappointing. I usually love zucchini. Will not be making this again.

Scratching my head wondering what to do with all the zucchini my husband grew in his garden, then I found this recipe! Delicious! Great change of pace. But I leave out the seeds, mix with cooked white rice, and mix in the spaghetti sauce.

I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage and pre-cooked it a bit. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe.  In the future I may experiment with vegetarian options using tofu or mushrooms. The only problem is that the recipe doesn't specify how big the zucchinis should be.  I used one small one and two fairly big ones. I used a grapefruit knife to scoop out the zucchini.  A pineapple knife might also be good.

We like this!  Fairly easy to make and ends up similar to a meatloaf in a zucchini boat.  Makes enough for 4 very large zucchini boats from giant zucchini(4 boats in a 13x9 pan).  Very filling and good!

We loved this recipe and agree with others, it is very filling especially considering the low calories and low carbs.   The zucchini were 10" long. I had browned ground beef left from the night before and used that.  The only thing I eliminated were the bread crumbs to decrease the calories and carbs.  Baked at 350 deg,45 minutes, zucchini was not mushy, slightly firm, perfect texture for us. Served with rice.  Easy meal next time I will use raw meat.

Quite delicious, I will be making this again. I used some turkey bolognese sauce I had made the night before instead of sausage and tomato sauce. I stuffed the filling into halves of the smallish Lebanese/Israeli zucchinis--I've also seen them called Greyzini squash. These are tender zukes and cooked perfectly for the recipe.

I've tried this recipe. I didn't use the bread crumbs and used my homemade marinara sauce to be carbohydrate free. I added more garlic, crushed red pepper seeds and used hot Italian sausage which I browned first. And of course, salt and pepper to taste.
Loved it!

I would try adding egg to the mix.  It was a little mushier than I would have liked, but it was delicious.  You don't need to cook the meat first. I agree 45 minutes will cook your zucchini and your meat.

Tasted OK but aesthetically it was weird.  The sausage mixture cooked into a meatball tube kind of thing.  Not very appealing.

Cooked the sausage first.  LOVED this recipe!  I did add chopped onion to the meat while browning it and added red bell peppers to the stuffing.  This was a huge hit!

So delicious...like a restaurant quality meal!  Only modification I made was to lightly saute onions and zucchini "guts" with the garlic and the ground sausage before stuffing.  I also cut back on the amount of bread crumbs.  Great with a side of rice!

I made a healthy low fat version of this dish and it was delicious. I used ground turkey instead of pork sausage, and Fat Free mozzarella cheese. Will make again soon! Thanks for the recipe.

Rave reviews all around. I used a huge (14") zucchini and prebaked it for 20 min as suggested by another reviewer, and also precooked the sausage. I did sub provolone for the mozarella for more flavor. Didn't have any bottled sauce, so made up a quickie with 1 29 oz can of tomatoes, the olive oil from cooking the sausage, basil from my garden and about 1 tsp of thyme, while the zucc baked. It was so filling, that it would be incredibly easy to adapt for weight watchers too (using light sausage and limiting cheese portions), while still being a very generous serving. (Our recipe was at least 6 servings). Many thanks for the terrific recipe!

Very good!  Loved the filling and the suggestion to serve with rice was good.  I too pre-cooked the sausage mostly because I was short on time.  I cooked at 400 for 30 mins and everything was done.  Mind you I was cooking one of those home-grown zucchini's that are as big as your arm!  If I make again with regular sized zucchini I will reduce the cooking time. I also doubled the cheese as a matter of taste - we really like cheese.

Pretty darn good. I could not eat this without rice underneath it so I gave it 4 stars. Also I cooked it double the time that the recipe states. I highly recommend serving with rice.

I followed the directions exactly except I cooked the sausage first.  It was good, but it seemed to be missing something.  Not sure what could help this recipe.  Maybe some fresh basil or more parm cheese?  Will probably make again with a few adjustments.

This was very tasty and quite easy! I used mild poultry sausage, which I did not brown prior to making the stuffing.  The only other adjustments I made was to add some sun-dried tomatoes and an egg to the stuffing.  I will definitely be making these again! Thanks for the great summer recipe!

Perfect they way it is! I did use ground turkey.
Do not brown meat first as others have suggested.....When you mix all the goodies into the meat, it bakes into this tender meatloaf right in the zucchini boat.
The zucchini was perfect - not overcooked!
Will definitely make this one again and again!

Amazing!This was the first time I've EVER made stuffed zucchini and it was brilliant! I used large zucchini, so I'm thrilled to have leftovers tonight. Here's how I deviated from the recipe: --pre-cooked spicy italian sausage with the onion --added some frozen fire roasted (TJ's) corn to stuffing --put a small amount of water in bottom of pan --baked about 40 minutes covered, additional 10 minutes uncovered.

My kids (4 and 3) ate everything on their plates!  I didn't have any parmesan cheese so I just used a little more mozzarella.  I also didn't ahve any dry bread crumbs so I just cubed a few slices of bread and it worked out for me.  No funky texture or anything.  Good recipe!

I pre-cooked the sausage with onions and garlic, added fresh basil and a bit of Italian seasoning and kosher salt.  I had one large zucchini, so I cut the ingredients down to about 2/3 and it worked out perfectly!

I just made this and it was delicious. I read the other reviews before I started, which is always helpful.Because I don't eat meat, I sauteed some carrots(sliced thinly) and purple cabbage in olive oil with onions and garlic. I steamed broccoli and cauliflower, and added all to the zucchini seeds,etc. It really made a lot, and the one reviewer who loved the sauce was right-great flavor. I like the basics of a recipie where you can tweak it to your liking w/out changing the basic greatness of it.

Great recipe!!! I did not have to alter much at all.  I took the sausage out of the casings and mixed it (raw) with the rest and added just a little extra virgin olive oil. I had some HUGE zucchini from my garden so I only had to use 2.  It was delicious!  My family and I really enjoyed it!

This was very good, but I did use ground beef with a lot of seasoning: ground red pepper, basil, oregano, and lots of garlic, which I cooked together with the chopped zucchini that I'd scooped out from the 15" long zucchinis. I also added diced red and yellow peppers to the chopped onions in the cooking mix. I microwaved the hollowed out zucch's for 4 minutes before filling them.  I spooned Rao's marinara sauce over the top of the meat mix after filling the zucchini, but used far less than the recipe called for. Also, I didn't have mozzarella  cheese; it was delicious with sharp cheddar and parmesan. So easy to change up this recipe to adjust to personal tastes.  Thanks!

For a long time I felt it was disrespectful to (tweek)recipes, then I decided if my posted recipes were, it’s ok, as we all like a recipe with our little add ins. ??  I used cooked ground turkey and I did what others said, cook zucchini in oven while preparing the filling.  It was delicious!!  Thank you for the recipe!

Just made this for my diabetic father & myself (trying to eat low-carb diet). This recipe is perfect for anyone, novice chef or otherwise, to tweek and make one's own. You can't go wrong if you use these basic ingredients and cooking methods. For example,  I didn't want to make so much so I only used two zukes. Therefore,  I used a little less hot Italian sausage etc. I didn't have mozza so I used what I had (Gouda, and it tasted great). I didn't add parm cheese (didn't matter). I used four garlic cloves, added a ton of Italian seasoning, black pepper and onion powder. This was a huge hit with my dad (picky eater) and I'll definitely make again. I served it over whole wheat pasta for my dad and I just ate a zucchini "boat" on it's own (minimal carbs ; ). Oh and I didn't have bread crumbs so I used stale whole wheat bread chopped fine with an egg mixed in.
p.s. you do not need to brown sausage or pre-cook zuke, however I did cook it @ 400 degrees for the last 15 minutes uncovered, perfectly cooked using medium-sized zucchini

I bought a large zucchini at my local farmers market yesterday and decided to try it stuffed.  Having never had zucchini prepared this way I was at a loss on how to make it.  I found many recipes here on All Recipes but chose this one because the ingredients list was small and it looked easy to make.  The only thing I did different was use ground italian sausage and added half a diced up onion.  I did not brown the sausage beforehand and cooked the stuffed zucchini for 60 mins since it was so large.  Wow, did this come out tasting fantastic!  Even the hubby loved it and he's a very picky eater.  This will definitley be made again in our house and the recipe shared with family and friends.

This recipe was very good.  I used one large zucchini.  I think that I should have scooped out more of the inside so there would be more room for the stuffing.  And since I used a large zucchini it needs to cook longer.   Very tasty.  
I have just made it a second time.  I used ground beef instead of pork sausage.  Also very good. But sausage has more flavour. I added some italian spice and sauteed onions.  
I used pretty big zucchini again.  Two of them, makes great leftovers too.

This recipe - exactly as written - is delicious. Everything gets cooked to perfection when following the instructions (the meat is by no means raw and the zucchini is tender but firm). The flavor you get in the end depends of course on what you put into it - sausage meat has more flavor, eg, than ground beef, chicken or turkey. My tomato sauce was heavy on the roasted garlic. It was fantastic - My entire family wolfed it down. I really cannot understand the comments about how pre cooking the zucchini is, like, duh! Obvious! It's not necessary. Or how pre poking the sausage makes it easier to mix... Does one pre cook the meat when making hamburgers, meatballs or meatloaf to make it easier to mix? If you don't think a recipe will work, and you are not prepared to give it a go, then move along people. Review something you actually tried instead.

My husband loved this recipe! I microwaved the zucchini boats to par-cook while I mixed up the stuffing.  I have lots of herbs in the garden, so I seasoned the sausage with thyme, parsley and chives, salt, pepper and extra garlic.  Once the sausage was cooked, I blended in mozzarella, asiago and parmesan cheese.   I then stuffed and baked per instruction.  Just before serving, I sprinkled the top with some mozzarella and feta cheese and baked until melted.  Incredible flavor!

Family LOVED it!!! I did boil my zucchini for 2 mins, then cut and de-seed it. Also browned the sausage in onion and garlic w/Italian seasoning. Turned out fabulous!

This turned out great, we liked everything about it! I did microwave my zucchini for 5 minutes and browned my sausage. It didn't change the recipe just made it to our preference. The zucchini seeds were easier to remove after nuking it, the texture was just slightly firm. Will definitely make again during zucchini season. Served with garlic bread. Perfect summer meal.

I made some modifications based on previous reviews. I browned the pork with minced garlic and onion. I also steamed the zucchini boats so they were tender. I didn't have mozzarella so that was omitted, but it didn't make too big of a difference. I added Italian seasoning, white pepper, garlic powder, and red pepper flakes to Newman's Own Roasted Garlic spaghetti sauce.

Well, I modified this recipe quite a bit to make it more healthy and gluten free, but I really liked using it as a start off point: I used 1/3 pound of mild pork sausage, 1/3 pounds ground chicken breast, used shallot instead of garlic because I can't eat straight garlic, 1/2 cup of gluten free bread crumbs, added an egg, used less than 1/2 cup of parmesan and excluded the mozzarella cheese. I also used Trader Joe's puttanesca sauce. I sprinkled it with Italian seasoning before baking. So, you can see that I really altered the recipe, but I think the flavors were maintained and it was so delicious. I've never made stuffed zucchini and we both really liked it. I also did not brown the meat before stuffing the zucchini, I just baked it until the temperature reached 165 degrees. I think that's the true way to tell if something is cooked thoroughly. The zucchini was cooked perfectly. While I didn't follow the exact recipe, this one was super helpful and tasty.

I used fresh garlic and cheese sausage removing the casing of course.  Added red pepper to the sauce for some heat and a lot more cheese on top.  Cooked for an hour before adding cheese then added and cooked for another 15 to crisp the top.  It was a hit.

Yummy way to use up extra large zucchinis.  I used a little less sausage than the recipe called for and it was plenty meaty.

My wife and I tried this recipe as written....FANTASTIC!  The zucchini was a little al dente, but that's the way we like our veggies.  I made some homemade garlic bread to top it off!  Will make this again and again!

I used lean pork loin which I ground myself.  Used half of panko crumbs and one egg plus freshly ground parm cheese and salt free seasoning.     Used two medium zucchini cut in half and scoped seeds out with a spoon.  Didn't use the seeds.  Was ready to add sauce and didn't have any.   I had two cans of ravioli and added both one pound cans.  Covered for one hour.  Took out and topped with the mozzarella.     OMG was it good!   Zucchini was a little firm but we like it that way.

I had to bake the zucchini for about 1 hour 45 minutes before it was tender enough to enjoy. Next time I will bake the zucchini for an hour before putting the topping on; but there will definitely be a next time. Simple and very delicious.

This is so yummy! I was lazy last time I made it and cut the zucchini up and added it to the sausage mixture the last few minutes of cooking along with the spaghetti sauce. (Also left out breadcrumbs.)  Poured the whole thing over cooked penne noodles and melted the cheese on top. It was still awesome served that way too. (Not as pretty though!) This is one of my new favorite ways to use zucchini! Thank you for sharing!!

Very delicious meal.  I substituted ground beef instead of the sausage, since my youngest son does not like sausage.  I also mixed the rice into the filling in error (so use to making stuffed peppers).

Good basic recipe to build up on. I used yellowneck squash but as for the meat mixture I have to admit that with the spices as given it lacked flavor. Since I did not have that much spaghetti sauce left, I used less and my squashes were a little bigger I think it had enough sauce and I had them in the oven for about a total of an hour.

I make this all the time in the summer! You really CAN add anything to this, and it turns out awesome - BUT I ALWAYS cook the meat first!  Add fresh tomatoes, yellow squash, peppers and herbs from the garden - You can't hurt it, and this one does NOT disappoint!!!

Made this tonight exactly as written.  Didn't have any problem with undercooked zucchini like other reviewers.  I thought it was fantastic and so did the family.  Only comment was to reduce breadcrumbs which I'll be trying next time.  Thanks for a versatile and easy recipe!

Great flavor, but cook the sausage FIRST!!!! Zucchini comes in many sizes folks. Mine was large and the temp wasn't high enough to cook everything. I ended up with uncooked sausage. I dumped it in a pan to fry, but you just can't cook sausage that way quickly. I had to dump it. Terrible waste and now I am worried about illness since I did want to eat it and had a little against my better judgement.

I liked it.  the only thing I did not include in this dish were the seeds.  I did not cook the sausage, nor did I pre cook the zucchini.  I packed the sausage in the zucchini like  meat loaf and baked it for an hour.  My Zucchini were not large, probably 3 inches in diameter and 8 inches long. Good as is. I think I'll try it in a crock pot next time. Thanks for the recipe.  I did try them in a crock pot and it worked nicely.  I have also made this recipe to freeze.  Stuff with sausage and freeze, when you want an easy meal, pull them out of the freezer in the morning before you go to work.  Place in casserole dish and add sauce and cheese when you return home and place in oven.  Easy work night dinner.

took the advice of others and precooked the meat but also I like being able to drain the fat (I used ground beef). While that was cooking I started the zucchini in the oven. I didn't have parmesan cheese and I forgot to put in the bread crumbs and it was still amazing. Definitely will be a regular in my house.

I used a little less than a pound of sausage and used panko bread crumbs and added some onion and sun dried tomatoes to the sausage mixture.  I thought these turned out great.  I served it over orzo pasta.

I followed the directions exactly since I don't believe it is appropriate to rate something to which you have made adjustments. My husband is pretty easy to please and he is always complimentary of my cooking. But tonight, he really made a fuss over how great this recipe was. When I suggested adding something the next time, he told me not to change a thing...he loved it as is.

This is one of the best meals I have made in a long time and it is really easy too, which is always a plus! It has all the yummy Italian favors that you love without needing to add the extra carbs of the noodles. I didn't change anything about the recipe except a little extra garlic and some red pepper flakes for heat. I used hot Italian sausage and Newmans Own pasta sauce and it turned out really well! The zucchini were a little crunchy still, but I liked the texture it gave the meal. That way it wasn't just one big mushy mess. I didn't pre-cook the sausage or the squash and it was amazing!

I cooked the meat prior to mixing, but it was amazing. My husband hates zucchini, but he loved this recipe so much he even ate it as leftovers. (The first time I've ever seen him eat leftovers)

I have made this recipe and it was loved by all!   I had one large zucchini from my garden and it was perfect for stuffing! After reading a number of the reviews I precooked the zucchini in the microwave for 3 min., then removed the seeds to use in the filling. As others had suggested and since I was using only half of the zucchini, I used only 1/2 C of Italian breadcrumbs, added some basil as well as the garlic and followed the rest of the recipe as written. It was really simple and easy to make.....I forgot that I used lean ground beef as well because that is what I had. My husband enjoyed this immensely and he is not always but sometimes a "picky" eater! Thanks so much for this recipe.

This is one of my husband's favorite meals. I'm new to cooking so I look for easier recipes to experiment with and this one is really easy. I've made it twice. I made a few very minor adjustments. I used Italian bread crumbs and mild Italian sausage, and added a small chopped onion. 3 medium zucchini were perfect and I did not have to precook. I also chopped the scooped out zucchini into smaller pieces. Since there are only 2 of us we always have leftovers. This dish is also great heated up as a lunch or a second dinner.

I love this one with fresh zucchini out of the garden. I use this ones with the larger zucchini. I did not cook the sausage separate, I stuffed the halves with the raw mixture and found it cooked thoroughly and the zucchini was cooked as well. I've also made these with slices of thinner zucchini. Slice them about 1 1/2" and scoop out a divot and then fill it with a scoop. These cook faster and are a great appetizer!

I had really high hopes for this recipe, but I ended up a little disappointed.  The zucchini ended up being soggy and the sausage mixture wasn't all that flavorful.  Thank goodness for the cheese and the garlic bread and salad I made for sides.  If I were to make this again I'd cut out the bread crumbs (or add Italian flavored bread crumbs instead) and I'd use spicy sausage rather than plain.  Just not quite enough flavor in this one.

I made as directed, but added salt & italian seasonings to the mix. I think next time I will make it with a mixture of 1/2 sausage & 1/2 grd beef. Very good and easy to make

This is the first review I've ever written and I have tried several recipies.  But after reading the previous reviews my husband agreed I needed to put my two cents in.  I followed the recipie to a tee.  I made absolutely no changes and my family loved it.  I did not need to pre cook the sausage and it was a generic brand.  Thank you for sharing an easy wholesome meal!

This is an amazing recipe!! I only made 2 tweaks - first I cooked the non-stuffed, but scooped out zucchini in the oven, by itself, for 25 minutes - it just helped it cook more even I think. While that was cooking I browned the sausage (a must in my opinion) and assembled the filling. When the zucchini shells we done I took them out, filled them as the recipe says, and put them back in to cook for another 20 minutes. The total cooking time for me was the same, but I think the zucchini is better cooked and the sausage is much more tasty due to the browning. I'll definitely be making this recipe again and again - we LOVE it! :)

This was excellent!  I didn't have sausage  or bread crumbs so used ground beef and cracker crumbs, otherwise followed the recipe.  I also have a husband who wrinkles his nose at zucchini but he liked it and even agreed to eat it again!

This recipe was very easy and very delicious! Hubby said multiple times while we were eating how good it was! I used sweet Italian sausage and followed everything else exactly as the recipe says. You don't need to brown the sausage, I didn't and mine came out fully cooked after 45min. My zucchini was also fully cooked after 45min. This is a very filling recipe, so you really don't want to use huge zucchini because they will take longer to cook and you won't be able to finish eating them! I look forward to seeing how they heat up tomorrow for leftovers. Thanks for a great recipe!

My entire family loved this dish, even my picky teenage boys.  I wasn't sure from the recipe which size zucchini to use, but all I could find at the supermarket were small, 1 inch diameter, about 6-7 inch long zucchini, so I split them in half and put them in my 11 x 9 pyrex.  I ended up using 6 of them.  I had difficulty cutting out the center because they weren't very seedy.  It baked perfectly according to the directions, but it did have a lot of water at the bottom of the pan.  It didn't make it undesireable to eat, just to look at.  Would love a suggestion on how to avoid the wateryness I experienced.  I used bulk Jimmy Dean sausage and it was great.  Didn't have to add or subtract any other ingredients for a great meal.  My family said it is a keeper and I agree!

Excellent recipe.  My husband who does not like zucchini loved this.   Did not change a thing. Also good reheated the next day. Will definitely make again.

This is a very good reciepe but needs better cooking instructions. If you dont cook the meat or zucchini first then it need to cook for about 90mins covered. I recommend cooking the meat and boiling the zucchini before baking. Im going to add mushrooms, onions and bell pepper next time I make it.

I cooked sausage, garlic, onion, and sundried tomatoes and while I was doing that I put my hollowed out zuccini in the oven to bake (with 1/4 inch of water in the bottom of pan).  I also added a good cup of mozerella cheese instead of 1/2 cup.  Yummy!!

This was very tasty.  I had a large zucchini so it wasn't cooked in 45 minutes.  I did add onion to the stuffing.

my family has been making a version of this recipe for at least 40 years.  We scoop out and discard the seeds, then use a melon baller to scoop out the interior flesh (being very careful not to go through the outer skin).  The balls of zucchini are then cooked in the spaghetti sauce, Italian sausage mixture.  Layer it back into the zucchini boats with mozarella cheese.  this also makes it carb free.  The bigger the zucchini, the more it will collapse when you bake it in the oven. We usually use one that is at least 14-18 inches long!  (its a good way to use the squash that get too big in the garden)

Used large zucchini and baked at 350 while preparing the sausage, etc.  Stuffed zucchini and baked.  Added parmesan just before end so it would melt.  Excellent

Wonderful. I did brown sausage first, added an egg white to mixture and squeezed moisture from zucchini pulp before adding as other reviews suggested. I skipped mozzarella and it was delicious without it. It was perfect!

Very good. When I make stuffed zuchnni, I hollow out the center, mix that part of the zuchinni  in with the mixture and stuff the mixture in the centers of the zuchinni. A little extra work, but so good. 
I generally use Chuck chopped and a slightly different mixture and nothing but homemade sauce.  
Either way it's delicious.

When I made these I mistakenly added the sauce INTO the stuffing mixture, so I then opened another jar for putting on top.  I'm also not a big fan of pork sausage, so I mixed 1/2 sausage and 1/2 turkey.  I don't think these changes were big ones, and I was satisfied but not crazy about the results.  I served the leftovers tonight, still had one left after we ate. I'll probably look for another stuffed zucchini recipe.

REALLY REALLY GOOD!  I did not pre-cook the ground pork, just left it in the oven a little longer.  My boyfriend raved about it, I had seconds and I'm really glad there'll be leftovers tomorrow! Great way to use up all that extra zucchini.

This was yummy! I partially cooked the sausage and pre-baked the zucchini for about 10 minutes. After the 45 minutes in the oven, I sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar cheese, I didn't have any mozzarella. It was fantastic. the zucchini was al dente, just the way we like it!

Used this recipe for inspiration and didn't follow it to a T, but hope to eventually. Using 1 zucchini and spaghetti sauce leftovers and cheese, this turned out pretty good. ;)

Love this!  I cooked the zucchini a few minutes in the oven first. Then stuffed with meat mixture. 1 lb pork sausage, 1 egg, bread crumbs, seasonings...didnt cook sausage first.  Put sliced fresh tomatoes on top of sausage mixture. Baked for about 45 mins covered, add cheddar cheese cooked until melted.
Super good. will make again next year when have fresh zucchini.

This was ok. I think I'll look for other recipes though, I found it hard to adjust for the amount of zucchini as I was working with a very large zucchini and had way too much filling. I never use canned spaghetti sauce, so I want to find something that uses more from scratch ingredients.

Really good - I used seasoned canned crushed tomatoes in puree for the sauce, and also made turkey "bulk sausage" by seasoning ground turkey with fennel seed, garlic, red pepper flakes, poultry seasoning, thyme, sage...whatever else I could think of to make it sausage-like.  I did add some of the crushed tomatoes and a splash of chicken stock to the meat mixture, and reduced the baking time to a total of 35 minutes so my zucchini would still be somewhat crisp tender.  Very tasty!

This recipe was great and very easy as I had all ingredients on hand.  As I only eat poultry for meat, I used sweet italian chicken sausage, which I (like others) browned first with garlic and onions.  I also filled out the meat mixture with finely chopped mini portabello mushrooms and spiced it up with italian seasonings (basil, oregano, parsley, garlic powder).  I added sauce to the meat mixture, as someone suggested, but that made it soggy. I might've added too much.  My husband thought it was great as it was.  All in all, five stars as its a wonderful basic meal.

DELISH! :) We had this with spaghetti and a green salad and it went really well with it. DON'T FORGET TO BROWN THE SAUSAGE-I did, so I microwaved them for 3 mins to make sure that the sausage was cooked well! Will make this again, even my 3-year old niece who is super picky ate this! :)

This is an excellent recipe!  I followed the advice of browning the meat before cooking and the dish turned out great.  We let some of our zucchini get too big before we picked it out of the garden.  This is an excellent way to prepare large zucchini.

I tried to make this with round zucchini (looks prettier) and it turned out fine, but needed a few adjustments, notably in the cooking time (add a few minutes, depending on your oven). I would also suggest adding the tomato sauce to the meat before stuffing the zucchini. Otherwise, it works just as well as with regular, long zucchini!

This was really good. I'm not good with measuring and I was only making for two of us so I only used 1/2 lb spicy ground sausage, 2 small zuch. & just threw the ingredients together. I took the advice of other reviewers and added 2 finely chopped mushrooms and about 1/2 chopped tomato. I mixed in garlic powder and onion powder bc i was afraid that there might be too much mixture to fit real stuff. It fit just perfectly! I only had tomato sauce so I used a half can and spooned over each one, topping with parm as directed. I also browned the sausage before mixing. We each had one with a salad and quick toasted garlic bread. Had two leftover- boyfriend loved it, and wanted to eat the others for breakfast! Oh I also put a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes in the mix bc we like things spicy. I never would have thought of sausage and zucchini together, it paired well. It's a keeper-thank you for the idea!

This dish is excellent.  I browned italian sausage with some mushrooms and onions and used regular store-size zucchini - no need to prebake!  These are a definite keeper.

These were pretty good, and I liked how simple they were to make. Make sure you buy a good quality sausage though, cause I used a store brand mild Italian sausage and I do think that effected the flavor. I served this with a vegetable rice pilaf, and will definitely be making this meal again sometime.

Thank you! I had a very similar recipe in a book at my Mom's house (far away) and I am so glad you put it up on this site!  I was just looking for a way to use my zucchini and stumbled on this; I have to say thanks for posting!  MMM can't wait to make it again!

This is good and easy.  Even my children liked it!  I browned the sausage first and used leftover rice instead of bread crumbs. I plan to try yellow squash and other veg. to see what else my kids will eat!  Thanks for this recipe.

Very good with the tweaking. I followed most of Naples' suggestions. I only used one med zucchini. After cutting stem off and halving, I microwaved for a few min to par-cook. I scraped out the pulp and set aside. The sausage I used (2 links) was a chicken sausage with red bell peppers. I browned that for 6 min in EVOO, and then added a handful of frozen multi-colored peppers and onions, along with a good-sized clove of garlic and sauteed for a few min. Combined this mixture with the pulp and added a little oregano, basil and crushed red pepper, along with a portion of the mozzarella and parmesan cheese. Did not use bread crumbs, and it was just fine for me.  Stuffed the zucchini shells with this and topped with more of both cheeses. Then topped with just a drizzle of homemade marinara sauce. Baked uncovered for 30 min. I had half yesterday and just finished the other half. A different way then I usually prepare zucchini, and I enjoyed it! Nice light and healthy supper!

This is a 5 star idea I saw and adapted to use up things in my frig before going on a trip.  I did micro the hollowed out boats for 2 minutes.  I also wanted these meatless and use them as a side to go with chicken I was reheating.  I chopped tri colored  peppers, tomatoes, some fresh basil.  Added unseasoned panko crumbs, salt, lemon pepper, and garlic to yellow rice for the stuffing.  My husband eats almost anything but it takes something special for an unsolicited compliment, but he loved these!  I will make again using the stuffing as proposed but I am grateful for a super idea that can be so easily adapted.

Added half of the spaghetti sauce into the mixture, the rest on top. Need some other spices, maybe some basil.

I made this, but made the mistake of using Italian breadcrumbs instead of regular and it came out waaaay to salty for me. I will retry with regular, since the recipe had no added salt, it must’ve been the breadcrumbs. Very easy to make!

Followed the recipe exactly (tho I nuked the empty boats for 2 minutes prior to stuffing them), and they were good. Zucchini texture was perfect.  Next time, I'll brown the Italian sausage first, just to crisp it up and reduce fat, and will add some spices - needed a bit more flavor. My zukes, cut,  were about 8" long and were generously filled with the stuffing. Not sure why this says 4 servings - it easily made 6!

Delicious. I added sauteed mushrooms that I needed to use and onions to mix. I also increased the garlic substantially, just because we love garlic. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I used sweet Italian sausage. Cook time was perfect and I will make it again. This is one of those recipes that you can vary depending on what you have on hand, and it will be great. Thanks for posting!

I’ve made this twice now. Once following the recipe exactly and once with a few adjustments. The second time around I used hot Italian sausage, 1/2 a cup of Italian breadcrumbs total, and doubled the garlic. The first time was good but the second time was much more flavorful! I didn’t precook sausage or zucchini. Served with a salad and garlic toast. It was a big hit!

Loved it! I made a few changes: pre-baked zucchini with some oregano, and browned the sausage first, also used fresh made pizza sauce and used ground mild italian sausage.  I also baked without foil the whole time, with the cheese, to give the cheese more of a baked pizza texture.

I love this recipe I am not sure about the comments of not cooking the zucchini I never had a problem and made this 10+ times with different types as a preference I use a ninja to puree the zucchini "guts" also use half chop meat half spicy sausage and drizzle with Campbell's tomatoes soup instead it adds a different flavor that I love... thanks

Awesome. Increased garlic to a good tsp, precooked sausage (always do), and subbed Colby jack for mozzarella (what I had on hand). Excellent. Will make again. A great way to use all that garden zucchini.

Outstanding!.  If the zucchini is big,  you might want to partially bake the scooped out halves, cut side down, or scoop out more flesh so the 'boat' is not undercooked.

Loved it.  Made a few changes, I used hot sausage and  a tomato chopped up and added 1 egg.  I also omitted the spaghetti sauce.

Outstanding recipe! Had a rather large crook-necked Zuchinni, used a good Italian sausage. Recipe was delicious, served it with a side of pasta and cheesy French bread, it was amazing! This is a keeper!

I wasn't sure whether to post a review or not because I didn't follow the recipe exactly but after seeing some other reviews I think this will be fine. 
My major change was that I used ground beef instead of sausage. I added a dash of black pepper. onion powder and seasoning salt to the meat because obviously it didn't have the seasonings that sausage would have had. I started out by baking this for 50 minutes but the zucchini wasn't quite tender enough for me so I baked it uncovered for another 15. After that it was still quite soupy with the amount of sauce plus the water that cooked out of the zucchini so I baked it another 15 minutes.  It still came out rather soupy but I didn't mind because I could dip my breadsticks in the sauce. 
I think I'll make this again but I'll use sausage and maybe brown it a bit to get some grease out. Next time I would also mix maybe 1/2 a cup of  pasta sauce with the filling as it was a little dry.

I baked mine for an hour and the zucchini was still undercooked.  I also would brown the meat first and pour off excess grease, but they tasted good.

I used this recipe as a basic starter.  I added extra vegetables that I needed to use up . . .mushrooms, spinach, bell peppers, fresh tomatoes instead of the sauce.  I eliminated the bread crumbs to lower the carbs and added ricotta cheese to give it a lasagna twist.  I had a monsterous zucchini that I halved and removed the huge seeds. Precooking in the microwave was key!  Thank you!

So I made this with beef ( we grind our own beef) then added habanero and mozzarella  and made my own marinara sauce . I love these recipes as it gives great room to explore flavors.

I did make this recipe, but I made a few adjustments.  I used a very spicy sausage and cut backon the bread crumbs.  I used a jar of onion and garlic sauce.  It turned out wonderful.  I made enough that we had it again a couple days later.  My husband loved it, and would love to have again real soon.  lulusmom

Easy dish to make. I used fresh from our garden Black zucchini and fresh venison sausage from our local deer population. Added the zucchini with sausage, tyme, sage, oregano and garlic from our garden and mixed  it together with S/P and olive oil and bread crumbs. Then covered it with home grown and made, Heirloom tomato sauce. Truly an all organic dish! 
Outcome! flavor like nothing you have ever tasted! No store bought herbs and veggies would taste this good!
Start a garden! Its well worth it!

I made this last night for supper with fresh zucchini from my garden and my husband said it was 5 stars. Since it didn't specify what kind of pork sausage I just used breakfast sausage and it was great. Next time I make it I will use Italian sausage to give it a little more Italian flavor. Very good recipe

both my husband and I really liked this. I didn't precook the meat and I think my filling was a little more than a pound so to get it cooked through I had to increase the cook time to an hour. I added extra garlic, used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and threw in some worchestershire sauce. will make again, maybe with ground Turkey next time.

Don't add seeds! My husband did not care for this and complained for DAYS that I left them in the mixture. IMO, I agree but thought it was flavorful. Would make again W/O seeds!

This was a fantastic recipe. I made a vegetarian version of it and I omitted the sausage. Instead, I added some sauteed onion and sauteed red bell pepper, and some corn kernels and mixed that with the rest of the ingredients.

It definitely needs to state that the meat needs to be browned! I am still waiting on it to finish cooking in fear that the meat will not be cooked. Nervous that the zucchini will now be over cooked and soggy. Will definitely have to redo to see if it will taste different or better

This is a great recipe!  The only modification I made was to omit the zucchini seeds and instead add some diced red and green pepper and diced sweet onion!  Very simple, very good!  I put it in a baking dish and cooked it on the grill so I didn't heat up the house on a HOT summer day and they turned out fantastic!  Have made them on the grill a few times now.

This was better than I expected!  It was even a hit with my son and grandsons (8 & 10), who were all extremely skeptical of being served stuffed zucchini!  I used seasoned bread crumbs.  I automatically cooked the sausage, and I guess it did not say to do that.  I didn't measure the cheeses, and probably used more than called for.  But I found it to be easy and very good, even for those who are not zucchini lovers.

My daughter and I are vegetarian, so obviously I had to make some changes. I omitted the bread crumbs altogether and used a vegetable rice pilaf mix (cooked per package directions) and about half a can of rinsed chickpeas mixed with the parmesan cheese and seasonings. I stirred in an additional half cup of the sauce into the stuffing as well. Sliced Havarti was the cheese I opted to use instead of the mozzarella. I used a HUGE zucchini so I opted to microwave for just two minutes to avoid the long cooking time in the oven. baked for 30 minutes before broiling at 400 after adding cheese to the top and they were PERFECT. My daughter couldn't stop raving. Definitely adding this one to the circulation.

I fed my teenage boys this tonight and they loved it.  Told me it was a keeper recipe.  This like many others, I doubled the recipe, used bulk sausage and mild italian., Came out great.  I eyeball all of the other measurements.

Substituted ground beef for sausage and did not use bread crumbs. Had to cook a little longer, sauce was too runny. (guessing lack of crumbs). But it was over the top delicious.  My nine year old niece love, love, loved it.

Ok so I my family totally loves this recipe and it is perfect.   The only slight information for clarification for us NEWBE cooks is while you are doing the meat (and yes brown first) stick the boats into the oven tightly sealed with Reynolds wrap to be cooking while you are doing everything else.  I do my boats first & put them in oven.  Start browning sausage for about 10 minutes, turn off and then work on sauce mix with seeds.  Then I combine the meat with sauce and then pour into boats reseal with same Reynolds wrap.  At the very end I add the cheese to melt.  The measurements are all perfect the only thing I add is the cheese (we use tons, but that is just us). The meal is super low carb & awesome (did I say tastes AMAZING ;) happy cooking!

This is soo good. But I did what other reviewers suggested, cooked the squash  partially first and browned the meat. This is a really pretty dish that is hardy and healthy. We added lots of crushed red pepper flakes as we love the spice. Thanks for a really great  dinner idea.

Cooked this as indicated with one exception I used Mexican chorizo ( what I had on hand). I slightly cook it before mixing it with the rest of the ingredients. My boys loved it, they called it the veggie lasagna. Because of the Mexican chorizo it came out a bit on the spicy side which gave it a good flavor. Can’t wait to try it with other meats. Thanks for sharing.

I made this with a vegetarian sausage and it turned out pretty good! I like my cheese pretty crispy (reference my photo) and this was absolutely delightful. The only thing that I would change; mixing oregano, parsley, and a little bit of salt into the stuffing mix. Otherwise, it was wonderful! I scooped out more than the seeds in my zucchini, so the “boat” was thin and cooked tenderly in no time at all. Perfectly moist, tender, flavorful, simple, and quick to whip up!

My husband is trying to avoid bread so I modified this recipe. I used one big zucchini that I pre-roasted by itself.  I cooked two hot turkey sausage links, green peppers, onions, garlic before throwing in a Tblsp of grated parm and spaghetti sauce. After stuffing the zuke, I added shredded cheese and just cooked in the oven until cheese melted. Was  nice...not mind blowing.

I definitely suggest to cooked the sausage  first (2 min  in microwave) to remove all the fatty grease.  I only used three sweet Italian sausage without the casing chopped up .   I still cooked the stuff zucchinis for 40 minutes in the oven covered with foil.  It was fabulous ! next time I will try ground turkey ( with plenty of garlic and seasoning ) to make it even a little bit healthier .

I made this as written using mild Italian sausage.  The sausage gave it great flavor. I didn’t pre-cook anything (I actually didn’t see the suggestions until afterwards), but it wasn’t necessary; it was all cooked through and delicious.  Company worthy.

My husband is impossible.   I try all sorts of recipes and there are maybe 5 things that he likes.  When he does, he says "add this to the menu."  He had 2 bites of these before he told me to add it to the menu!   I followed the directions exactly.   I will say that there is a LOT of meat mixture in the zucchini in this recipe.  Next time I will probably half the amount of meat mixture and freeze the other half or make twice as many and freeze them.  We could all barely eat one and there was a ton leftover.

I've made this multiple times with whatever ground meat on hand (I've used beef, turkey & sausage) and it's always been a hit. I do NOT pre-cook my zucchinis and I find they come out perfect - not mushy, and also not crunchy. I'm thinking those who end up with crunchy zucchini are leaving more flesh than I am when hollowing them (I leave maybe 1/4")
*Also the meat DOES NOT need to be browned before making. I have never browned the meat & it turns out perfect.

This is a perfect base recipe and you can add whatever you may like to make it yours.

I made it exactly as written and it was good.  Next time I would use Italian Sausage rather than the pork sausage just to spice it up a little.  The pork sausage was a little bland.  Other than that, very good recipe and I will make again!  Thank you.

I normally don't like zucchini, but this was yummy! Next time I will try a small zucchini because it did have an intense zucchini flavor at the thicker parts. Besides that tiny thing, I definitely will try this recipe again!

Excellent recipe. I made it using my homemade sausage and I used very large zucchini which required a longer cook time.
Definitely a keeper!

With a fresh zucchini from my garden I followed this recipe with only a couple of added ingredients such as diced onions, Italian spices and used a spicy tomato sauce. This is a great way to use some of my fresh zucchini.

I have made this recipe 3 times now. It's much easier with really large zucchini, but I can only get at them farmer's market in the summer. (I live at 9,000 ft in the mountains of Colorado, so we are limited in the winter)

I'm a vegetarian so I added more veggies in leu ofmeaat and I used chunks of bread instead of bread crumbs. I used left over marinara sauce and it tasted great! I only used one zucchini so I cooked the two halves for 15 mins but it was way underdone. After I ate the one half i put the other half back in for 20 mins, and it was as good as I had imagined. This recipe is good but more cooking time is needed.

This recipe hit the spot for me big time. I mean, italian sausage and tomato sauce what is not to love. Especially when you use your own spaghetti sauce. Made it as instructed except I didnt add the seeds to the stuffing. Used hot italian sausage. The zucchini were cooked perfectly in the time instructed, tender but still firm to hold up. Not sure why anyone wants mushy zucchini but this was perfect. This reminded me of a chicago deep dish sausage pizza but using zucchini for the crust, which was not a bad thing. The only reason I dont give this five stars is because my wife thought the sausage became overwhelming. I do wish the sausage had more texture rather than cooking into a solid log that sits on the zucchini but as far as simplicity and flavor goes, thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

The zucchini does need to cook longer than the recipe or use more liquid to soften them up.  But overall it was a great recipe.

I did NOT pre cook anything. The zucchini were small so they were nice and soft when done. 

Pretty much put whatever inside you want. I used fresh sausage, onions, really all the stuff I'd use for meatloaf.

made these on a weeknight and both my boyfriend and I enjoyed them. I used Italian sausage with the casing removed, Italian-style bread crumbs, and gray squash instead of zucchini, which was recommended by the guys at the market. 

I also used two cloves of garlic instead of one and half of the spaghetti sauce as was recommended. The spaghetti sauce was Michaels of Brooklyn: fresh tomatoes and basil.

The sausage provided a hint of anise, which was balanced out by the other flavors.

Used a lot more garlic, cut breadcrumbs in half (actually used seasoned gluten free), pre browned sausage and pre baked zucchini a bit as others suggested. Was amazing. Will definitely make this again!

I made this with yellow summer squash from a friends garden. She has an abundance and I needed a new way to use her generosity! After stuffing the squash I realized I had forgotten to add garlic to the mixture, so I sprinkled the stuffed squash with garlic powder before baking. Other than that I made the recipe exactly as submitted. Yummy. A lovely dinner.

Super good and easy.  I followed the recipe except I used half the amount of bread crumbs and I added a teaspoon of crushed red peppers to the turkey sausage I used.  The family loved it.  I will make this one again!

Used Bob Evans original sausage. I think this would be great with sweet Italian sausage. After reading several reviews, I decided I did not want a lot of sauce to serve with my zucchini boat. Therefore I used about 1- 1 1/2 cups of marinara sauce and just added that to the sausage/zucchini mix. I stuffed my zucchini (they were really nice and full). They were not dried out when I took they our of the oven. My daughter's family was here for lunch. This recipe can easily feed 5-6 if you serve vegetables and a side salad. The adults pronounced this a hit. My 9 yr. old grandson only ate 1/2 of his. I think it was a texture thing with him. His daddy finished the grandson's so I know it was good! Will make  this again.

I really like this recipe.  I did not have ground pork on hand so I used ground beef.  I did not cook the meat mixture before hand and it cooked just fine in the oven. I also seasoned the beef a little more but I did not add the zucchini seeds into the mixture(just added onion powder and some other seasonings I like).  I also made homemade sauce instead of buying sauce from the store.  Overall came together really well and was very flavorful.  Husband even liked it!  Definitely will make again.

Made this for my husband and I and we loved it.  I made a few changes, added some chopped grilled chicken to the recipe and added melted butter and herb stuffing mix to the grated cheese topping.  This made a nice crunchy top.   We had it a tossed salad.  Wonderful easy meal.

I would definitely recommend either cooking the sausage before baking or baking for an extra 10-20 minutes. The recipe tasted delicious as it was, but needed more cook time because the sausage was still undercooked. I also baked at 375 instead of 350 and the sausage was still under cooked.

used 3 med-large zucchinis. baked them in a covered dish a bit first while I prepared the stuffing.  browned turkey breakfast sausage. stirred in onions, garlic, red and yellow peppers, as well as the zuk innards and parm cheese. I didn't measure anything, rarely do. did not use bread crumbs...I wisked in an egg. I might leave that out next time...doesn't really need it. 
lightly peppered the boats before stuffing. went sparingly on sauce, as zucchinis are watery.

My wife cannot have high acidic foods or spicy foods, so I replaced the sausage with hamburger, and the spaghetti sauce with a jar of vodka sauce. I added some Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper to taste to the meat while mixing. We will definitely do this recipe again!

This was amazing!  I can't believe how easy and delicious this was. I used 3 hot Italian sausages and 3 mini zucchinis  (what I had on hand) and homemade meat sauce to pour over top. So far, it's the meal to beat for this month! Cook time was perfect as described in the recipe. Follow the recipe and you won't have any problems.

I made this exactly as directed. After 1 Hour & 20 Minutes in the oven, the meat was still not cooked through. I ended up taking the filling out of the zucchini, putting it in a saute pan & cooking it through. Then I put it back into the zucchini, covered it with cheese & baked it a little longer to melt the cheese. Despite being in the oven for so long, some of the zucchini was still on the crunchy side. The taste was good. However, in the future, I will definitely cook the zucchini in the oven while I cook the meat in a saute pan. Then maybe it will turn out better, hopefully in less time.

This was so delicious but I changed it up a bit. I diced up a garden tomatoe and sliced some mushrooms to mix with the stuffing. I also used one egg to help hold everything together because it makes a ton! It was a huge hit though ... I took the leftovers in to work and everyone loved it

Tonight will be my third time to make this dish  & we all love it as written. Re: the zucchini not being cooked enough, my family loves the crunch & texture of the cooked but not mushy zucchini. I use a fully cooked chicken/mozzarella/spinach sausage. I don't cook it again, I just break it up & add the rest of the filler ingredients. Delish!

Delicious! I used ground turkey instead of the sausage and it was still excellent.

We loved this and it was easy to make. I did not cook the zucchini or sausage first and it came out perfect. I used Italian sausage. I scrapped a bit of the flesh out with the seeds and it included all of it in the sausage filling. One time I added ricotta cheese to the zucchini before putting in the filling. This was a good addition if you have ricotta you need to use up. I also usually add more garlic.

Family loved it. I subbed flax meal and chia seeds for the breadcrumbs, two people said they'd prefer breadcrumbs and the rest loved it as is. I made 1/2 of them with tofu; delicious! I cooked the recommended amount of time and the zucchini cooked just fine, a bit al dente but that was preferred. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

Thought it was a great recipe. Only thing  we did was precook the sausage. We used a medium size zucchini , about 10-12 inches. The filling was hot and loaded with the cheese, while the "boats were still firm with a light crunch, not mushy. It was a hit as we have already made it twice with our abundant crop of zucchini

Delicious!  However, it takes a lot longer to cook than 45 minutes.  Size of zucchini affects the time needed significantly.  I made it twice.  The first time, I cooked it for 1-1/2 hours; the second time, 2 hours.

I followed the recipe and it was fantastic.  Zucchini were around 6 inches long- used 5.  Sausage was Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage- did not precook  and wasn't spicy at all.  Sauce was Bertoli Vidalia Onion.  Fantastic Flavor!  Zucchini were perfectly cooked and sausage mixture was perfect!  Keeper!!

Delicious and easy!  It was tasty despite the fact that my husband bought cucumbers instead of zucchini :-D.  I bet it is even better when made with the proper vegetable base!  We'll make it again soon.

I have made this several times. I did do a 50/50 mix of Italian sausage and ground beef. Also I did not use a whole jar of sauce as it made the zucchini to wet, instead I used a couple tablespoons of sauce.. Tasted great!!

The texture of the filling didn't work out well for us. Perhaps the zucchini should be very soft with watery "guts"? I also suggest using the kind of sausage that crumbles inside its casing; even cut into quarters, the flavor of the sausage didn't really meld with other ingredients.

I love this recipe! I use Hot Italian Sausage to give it more of a kick. Prep time does take me way longer than the recipe says...but I'm also a pretty slow cook so that might just be me!

I found this recipe excellent, but prefer more seasoning, so jazzed it up with additional spices, including roasted red pepper flakes.  It is a good basic recipe and versatile with whatever summer vegetables you  choose, as well as couscous, acini pasta, or rice for a delicious variation.
I have made it using lean ground beef instead of sausage,  (browning the meat and added mushrooms, fresh corn, black beans, and fresh sweet red pepper in the filling).
One reviewer said the zucchini needed to be pre-cooked, but I found that scooping the flesh out to add to the filling, and leaving a thin shell as directed eliminated that.  I had VERY large zucchini, so the roasting time was longer than the recipe called for, but I anticipated that.   I used fresh mozzarella (because I needed to use it up), and it  was perfect, melted under the broiler until golden and bubbly.  
I will definitely make this again.  Looked beautiful!
Because my zucchini was so large, I had an entire meal with each half.  Lining my baking dish with parchment paper, and wrapping the left-over half in foil, meant enjoying it the next day, just heating it in the oven. I could have frozen it for later, but we could not wait to eat it again... Fantastic!  Yum!  Thank you, LTHASKINS!

I must admit, after reading reviews, I made adjustments. First, my zucchini were huge and overgrown, so I scraped out the seeds and kept them. Next, I placed them in a large baking pan, skin side up, with some water, and cooked them at 375 F while I did the following...I took a skillet and threw in one lb of spicy Italian sausage with a tsp of red pepper flakes and 1 tsp of fennel seeds, mashed together with 2/3 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and cooked it down into crumbles. I then added 4 cloves of freshly minced garlic, 1 tbsp fresh basil, 1 tbsp fresh spicy oregano, and a jar of fabulous pasta sauce. Then I mixed in the 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese. Once it was simmering, I took the zukes out of the oven, poured off some of the water, flipped them over, and filled them with the meat sauce. Then, I topped them with another 1/2 cup of Parmesan, 1 cup Buffalo mozzarella, and 1 cup Asiago cheese. Covered it, cooked for another 20 minutes at 375, uncovered, and cooked another 20 minutes. Served it. It was amazing. I would definitely make it again.

After reading the mixed reviews, I was so nervous about making this one. So many people recommended so many different things, others said the changes weren't necessary. In the end I followed the recipe, but I did cook the sausage prior because all the reviews made me nervous about under cooked meat. I think it turned out great and really didn't need all the changes people are mentioning (but I'm glad I cooked the meat just to be safe and it's not like it drastically changes the recipe). The zucchini were cooked perfectly, I didn't need to pre-cook them at all. I described this recipe to my husband as "zucchini pizza". I used 2 medium zucchini sliced in half to make 4 servings cause it was all I could fit in the pan, and my husband and I could only eat one because it was so heavy and filling (we served it with garlic bread). I'm excited to see how these microwave for leftovers. I also had a ton of leftover filling mix (you could probably fill 6-8 medium sized zucchini boats with all the filling you get from this recipe), so I might have make this again very soon and see how refrigerated, leftover filling cooks. Regardless, it's a great recipe on its own and doesn't NEED a ton of changes, but the recipe has room for tweaking to your exact liking if you want. I think the only thing I would do different is add some parsley or pizza seasoning!

I made it exactly like the directions and it was very good. The seeds and pulp of the zucchini did not incorporate well into the meat mixture. Next time I will use the food processor to make sure everything is well blended. I may use Italian sausage for more flavor also.  It was delicious and I will be making this often with my abundance of zucchini.

This was delicious!  I didn't have a problem with the zucchini being undercooked, but I think that is a matter of choosing the correct size vegetable, if you only have larger thicker zucchini available, I would pre-bake them a bit.  I was out of bread crumbs, so I substituted dry stuffing mix, it was so delicious I think I would make it that way the next time too.  I used extra sauce too because we prefer it that way.  Served this with garlic bread and a glass of red wine - it was perfect!  All the leftovers were gobbled up.

Just made this and really like it.  When cooking sausage mine never cooks in the posted times so I sauted my sausage with the zucchini and added thyme and garlic cause that's what I always add to my sausage.  Cooked until sausage was about halfway done then added remaining ingredients.  Still baked for 45 min in oven.  Turned out great.  I used 1 package of  Uncle Charley sausage patties and 1 very large sized and 1 medium sized zucchini.

I followed the instructions with just a couple of minor adjustments and it was fabulous!  My husband and two small children gobbled it up.  I used sun dried tomato chicken sausage from Trader Joe's instead of pork sausage.  I made fresh bread crumbs by throwing  two slices of whole wheat bread in the blender.  The zucchini cooked to perfection!

Really good, no pre-cooking or pre-browning needed! IF I make a change next time, I would only use 1 24-oz jar of spaghetti sauce as my "boats" got lost in the sauce. :) Otherwise, fantastic and definitely a repeat.

The only thing that I didn't care for was I believe for me there was to many bread crumbs in the mixture. However, I also had one very large zucchini that replaced the 3 used in the receipe. However, I think pre-baking the zucchini would be best and to brown the sausage would make it even better on the cooking time. Because all together it took way to long to cook and I kept upping the oven temp to hopefully get something cooked! However, it was even better left over the next day and everyone loved it! Will I make it again, absolutely yes, I have a garden of zucchini to use!

Good recipe!  I've made it twice now.  The first time I thought the filling was a little mushy, so I decided to try browning the sausage first the second time around.  Much better!  However, I probably should have thrown the garlic on the stove with the sausage because browning the sausage shortened the baking time quite a bit, resulting in some undercooked garlic.

Very tasty. I used Jummy Dean Italian sausage for the filling and jack cheese on top. Bumped oven to 400 and shortened the baking time a little.  I had extra filling that I baked in a small ramekin. Husband loved it. Will make again!

Holy WOW!! This will go into our normal rotation.  I made my meat like I was making a Chef John Lasagna (because everything he makes is GREAT!!)  per our own personal taste.  I did everything else as written.  I knew we were going to have a late night so after I scooped out the zucchini I nuked them for a minute to save some oven time!!  Try this recipe it is worth it!!

I loved this recipe.  I added a little bit of cajun seasoning to my zucchini since I like spicy, but my family enjoyed it without.

Made this as our main dish for dinner, using  1/4 lb cooked sausage, following the recipe as given. It took 1 HR to bake, and was delicious. Baked at 400 until final 15 min, then at 425 uncovered. 
With green salad, gave us a healthy dinner with great flavour.

I will definitely make this dish again. I did prefry my sausage so it wouldn't be so greasy. I just baked the zucchini half's sprayed with canola spray and parmazon cheese sprinkled over it alone. Then I added the pre-fried sausage and shredded cheese. It was delicious.

This was delicious and my family went back for seconds and thirds.  I used oversized zucchini from my garden.  It wasn't completely cooked through, but we liked the zucchini a little firmer.  I will definitely make this again.

Like others, I had to cook the zucchini longer and I didn't bother with the breadcrumbs. It was delicious on basmati rice, but I would like to try it with angel hair pasta as suggested. I'll try Italian sausage next time, also browning it first to remove the excess fat. I like the idea of adding, onion, tomatoes, and red peppers, too. One jar of sauce is plenty. Regular sized zucchini would leave room for adding one more.

Great! I had to use another small zucchini because I had so much stuffing.  My zucchini did not have large seeds nice small ones.  It was a yummy dinner. Meat did not have to be browned, if it was can't imagine mixing it with the bread crumbs and seeds. Cooked complete. Thanks for sharing.

add a little milk to the filling to moisten it up when mixing.  I used ground beef instead and it was great.  also used goat cheese instead of mozz and it made all the difference.  super creamy.  also had to cook zukes for about 1.5 hours because I had a seriously huge zuke.

Oh, my - soooo good! Perfect for low-carb dieters like me. I had a very large (overgrown) zucchini from my garden, and by just increasing ingredients by about half, worked out deliciously. I used 4 Italian sausages (skins removed), also added an egg, chopped bell peppers & onions, as suggested by others + a couple tablespoons of chopped fresh Italian parsley. Used only about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to keep the carbs down - just enough to bind things together.

Enjoyed this dish and so did my dinner guests.  I used a smaller zucchini and used regular pork and added my own seasoning to make an Italian-sausage flavoured meat.  Easy to prepare and I will definitely prepare it again.

Good recipe BUT it does not tell you the size of the zucchini you should be using and larger squash need to be cooked longer on a higher heat. 350 degrees will not cut it! Keep this in mind because normally stuffed zucchini recipes are reserved for those oversized veggies but this seems to be tailored to smaller, maybe medium squash. A goo recipe though which I will use again.

I love this recipe but I bake it about 20-30 mins longer than the recipe calls for--otherwise the zucchini is crunchy but, worse, the sausage is under-cooked.

A neighbor gave us some zucchini, so I decided to try this recipe. I used ground beef instead of pork, Italian bread crumbs and a little onion. I broiled it after adding the mozzarella to melt the cheese. YUMMY! We thought this was as good as lasagna, but healthier! Will definitely make again. My husband said, "does that mean we are growing zucchini next year?!" LOL

I made this for dinner recently and it was a hit with my family.  Using all of the insides of  the
. zucchini is a bit too much, so I only used about.t 3/4 of it.  Next time I make it I will only use half.  The leftovers are good too.  M.

Very tasty!  I pre-baked the zucchini and cooked the sausage ahead, but still baked it for 45 minutes as my zucchini was very large and I wanted to ensure it was tender.

Excellent dish. My only change would be to use a little less meat. Using a full pound of sausage made enough filling to stuff my zucchinis till they resembled an open face zucchini sandwich and roll a few beat balls on the side. With that said, my boyfriend didn't mind because he loved the extra meat.

I love this recipe & have made it several times. I usually use Italian pork sausage, but used Italian chicken sausage last time & it was delicious. I may even prefer it. I now add sauteed onions & mushrooms to the pasta sauce & like it even better. It is best if you drain the zucchini before adding the other ingredients. Also I use Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I made this for a friend & had to adjust the recipe to gluten free & no pork. I found gluten free plain bread crumbs & added 1 T.  Italian Seasoning & used the chicken Italian Sausage. It was just as good if not better. 
I serve this dish over a barley, brown rice & wild rice mixture. It is a keeper! *Note: Don't undercook this dish. The sausage should firm up. If it hasn't cook it longer or at a hotter temp. It's not as desirable if the sausage filling is on the soft side.

Very good! I used hot sausage and sprinkled a bit of seasoned bread crumbs. I browned my sausage, added the insides of the zucchini along with the jar of spaghetti sauce, stuffed the boats topped with motz cheese and seasoned crumbs. baked the zucchinis raw with cooked filling @ 350 for 30 minutes. Zucchini had the right amount of crunch and everything was super yummy! Served with rice pilaf!

I used 4 small zucchini with sweet Italian sausage.  I didn't have spaghetti sauce, so I cut up some tomatoes and added them to the meat.  Then I put a can of diced tomatoes on top.  I didn't cook the sausage ahead of time, there was quite a lot of grease that came out of the sausage, so I will probably brown the sausage first so the zucchini doesn't cook in all that grease.  We ended up transferring the boats to a different pan and putting the mozzarella on top for the last 10 minutes, just to deal with the grease a little.  But the taste was great, everything was cooked just right.  I probably cooked it about an hour.  I love the texture of the zucchini!!

I pre-steamed the zucchini boats and used hot italian turkey sausage as well as 2% cheeses. I cut the cheese quantities and breadcrumbs. I also used fresh tomatoes crushed up to avoid the jar additives. One serving (calculated on Myfitnesspal) came out to 391 calories. It came out incredible and healthy!

This recipe was really tasty. I'm always looking for new ways to cook zucchini and in my opinion this is a keeper. Don't know why some reviewers said to precook the squash and sausage because mine turned out perfect. I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used Ritz cracker crumbs and worked well.

I found that the zucchini was not tender enough cooking it according to the recipe.  The flavours were there, and I might make it again, but if I do I'll be baking the zucchini before I stuff them.

First off . . . is it that our zucchinis are simply smaller in Canada?  This recipe makes far too much "filling" granted the size of the three zucchinis I had purchased for this recipe.   Mine ended up being six zucchini halves completely covered by the meat/breadcrumb/cheese mixture, almost like some sort of casserole.

Second of all, I will have a hard time finishing the leftovers.  This recipe just doesn't taste all that good to me, I'm quite put off.

Sorry, it could just be me since other reviewers seemed to find the recipe quite great.

Good recipe with ideal ingredients. Instead of stuffing the zucchini I slice it and make it into a casserole.

Amazing recipe, loved the taste! I replaced the sausage with cooked rice to make the recipe vegetarian and loved it, still so much flavor. I also added two extra cloves of garlic, for more garlicky goodness! Have already made this twice already and plan to make it more!

I made this for dinner tonight. I am trying to maintain a low carb lifestyle due to type 1 diabetes. I am also gluten sensitive. I am sure the recipe would have tasted great with the bread crumbs, but I subbed it with Oat bran. My husband and I really liked it but the kids are not zucchini fans when they can see it :) I will make it again!

Very good basic recipe.  Used hamburger instead then added caraway seed to give it that Italian taste.  Made my own bread crumbs using heels of good bread I save in the freezer and ground them up in my processor.  Used a good hard Parmesan Cheese grated.  Followed the recipe for other seasonings but this needs to bake much longer to make the zucchini tender.  Really good full flavor.

Flavor was good, but too much stuffing for the size of the zucchini.  Zuccini never would have gotten done at 350; after 25 minutes turned oven to 425 and finished them.  My zucchini were actually quite small.  If I were doing larger ones, I would definitely precook some.  Probably won't be making this again.

This turned out great! Size of the zucchini doesn't matter, because you will have a lot more filling than you have zucchini. I just let excess filling fall to the bottom of the pan and bake with the rest of the zucchini. I used ground country pork and I was worried it wouldn't have enough flavor so I added fresh basil, oregano, and a red bell pepper. I added the scooped out zucchini to the pork and pepper in the pan. I made sure the majority of the pork was mostly cooked through before filling the scooped out zucchini. I found that the cooking time (45 minutes) was perfect for the zucchini as long as you scoop out ~70% of the filling. I served this with an orzo recipe. It was delicious! Will definitely make again!

My boss made this recipe and brought some leftovers in. I looved it! I knew I had to make this myself! She made a few modifications which I followed. Didn't use bread crumbs. Used hot italian sausage (browned and drained before mixing). Mixed some mozzarella and parmesan cheese in to the mixture. Didn't use any measurements. You can really use as much or as little as you'd like. Also, she suggested to use an Arrabbiata sauce which was delicious! The spice really adds flavor to the bland zucchini! I paired this with some italian bread and thin linguine. It was absolutely delicious and had left overs for 2 days of work lunches. The left overs were just as good reheated in the microwave. Hope this helps!

I was lazy and short on time when I made this.  So...I cooked Italian sausage until it was crumbly and then sliced up all the zucchini and threw it in to cook it a little.  Added the bread crumbs, garlic, sauce and parmesan and finally put all into a casserole.  Topped with Mozzerella and baked until it was browned and bubbly.  My family really liked it!

I'm not a veggie eater but I ate this all up! Was SUPER easy and yummy. The filling did seem a bit dry to me so I did add 2 eggs but other than that, I stuck to the recipe. Oh, I did probably add more mozz on top but that's because we're a cheese loving family and I just sort of piled it on. I also only used one zucchini but that's because we had a HUGE one.

This was amazing!  Loved loved it!  Even my husband who only eats bland meat, potatoes, and veggies liked it!  You have to follow the recipe to the T...  Warning... Very filling.
Even if it was amazing...  I am going to use this as a guide to make it healthier.  Next time I will use ground chicken and ground chicken beacon instead of the sausage.  I will use ground Melba toast instead of the bread crumbs, light cheese and add some Italian spices, red peppers and garlic.  Yet will keep the parmesan cheese and spaghetti sauce.   Hope it turns out Ok....  Will advise later

Started cooking the (large) zucchini halves while I prepped the stuffing.  Just mix some of spaghetti sauce into the sausage mixture, or lightly spread on top.  Does not require even a whole 24 oz jar of sauce.

This is even better the next day!  I used fresh zucchini from the garden. I fried up the hot Italian sausage before combining.  I added a little mozzarella to the stuffing mixture, as well as some blanched cucuzza from the garden.  I used Ragu for the sauce because I was in a hurry, but homemade would have made it even better!

Excellent and easy!! I tried to make as close as written...but reduced bread crumbs to 3/4 Cup. I also added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes since I used bulk breakfast sausage. I think a nice Italian sausage would be great tasting! Someone said to use a quality spaghetti sauce, and I used cheap Hunts. I liked the flavor, but it was very watery in the bottom of the pan (which I froze for soup stock). I used a "pizza blend" cheese which was perfect. I did NOT brown the sausage and was a bit concerned that it wouldn't be cooked enough, but it was after 55 minutes! Three med sized zucchini were just right. Baked at 360 degrees because of high altitude. Will definitely make again!

Absolutely delicious. The only changes I made were cooking it a bit longer because of the size of my zucchini and adding 4 cloves of garlic (family loves garlic). My husband, who normally wouldn't touch zucchini, had two large helpings. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

I will make this again. I made it as written except I used garlic power. My husband enjoyed it and he is not much for veg.  Only negitive was that the meat was a bit dense

Made this exactly as stated and it was fine. No need to pre-cook the meat or the zucchini. I did buy smaller/thinner zucchinis, however. I also used a tomato sause with basil already in it. I also used sweet Italian sausage. I didn't love the recipe but I didn't hate it either. Very easy to make and tasted good, but it was a little mushy. It tasted good the first night, but it was even better the next night.

I absolutely love this recipe and so did my guests. I made one small change,. I sautéed a medium onion and mixed it in the meat mixture.
I am now putting a new spin on it and using fresh, sweet Italian sausage. It is absolutely amazing how far you can stretch a pound of sausage, either kind.

I made this for supper last night and it came out great. I used small slim zucchini and scooped out enough pulp to make shallow boats and then just packed the filling into them. I made three variations. I have an abundance of sweet peppers in the garden right now, so I chopped up one and added it, doubled the garlic, and since it seemed like it might be a bit bland, I added 1/4 tsp of ground cayenne pepper. It didn't make it "hot," just gave it a little zip. Finally, since spaghetti sauce--anything with concentrated cooked tomato--gives my husband heart burn, I used alfredo sauce on half of them and spaghetti sauce on the other half. I liked it both ways. He like it well enough that he cleaned his plate, including the zucchini. Usually on something like that, he eats the filling and leaves the vegetable behind.

Made these for the 1st time and we loved them! Made a few changes.....used chopped pepperoni instead of sausage and garlic powder since I didn't have any garlic cloves on hand.  Added some chopped onion, too.  The thing that made it so easy was that I didn't bake them in the oven, ...... covered the pan with plastic wrap and put them in the microwave for 5-6 minutes.  Sprinkled cheese on top and put them back in the microwave for about 20 seconds.  So quick and easy and the zucchini was just the right texture.  I didn't use as much spaghetti sauce as called for, just enough to cover the tops of the boats. Mmmmmm, will definitely make these again!

I followed the recipe but only used 26 oz of sauce which was plenty.  My zucchini were medium to large and I thought there was way, way too much meat.  It felt like eating a sausage dog with a zucchini bun.  I didn't precook my meat and my zucchini were completely, if not over, done.  I used hot sausage which added a lot of flavor.  I might try again and only use 1/2 lb of sausage.

I would make this again but with large zucchini  ... there was too much filling compared to the zucchini. Used one 26oz jar of sauce but could have used half as much.  Rated pretty good though!

I used an eggplant instead of the zucchini, with Italian hot sausage, topped with pepper jack.  I upped the cooking time to 1 hour.  It was very tasty and got rave reviews from my family.  I'll make this again.

I made this exactly as recipe states, except I used ground turkey & added a dash of Mrs. Dash Italian Medley seasoning, & used 3 garlic cloves. Prep time took longer than 10 minutes, but maybe I'm just inexperienced in scooping out the zucchini & grating fresh Parmesan.  I had lots of stuffing left over even though  I overloaded the boats. Will probably reduce the amt of meat next time. I did not brown the meat prior, as some reviewers had. It was delicious!

These were quite delicious. I did substitute ground chicken and turkey sausage for the pork to cut calories, and sprinkled a little salt and pepper on the zucchinis before stuffing them. I used medium sized zucchinis and did not have to pre-cook them at all. Will make again for sure.z

This is so good.  I did steam the zucchini in a bowl with a little water in the microwave before halving.  DId not use the seeds/pulp.  I added a chopped red pepper and sauteed mushrooms, which I sauteed with the Italian Sausage to par-cook it so it went into the zucchini in a crumbled state.  Served over angel hair.  We loved this and so did our guests.  Reheats beautifully.  Make extra filling and freeze!

This was a very good recipe Made this for my wife and I. It calls for 32oz spaghetti sauce and I only had 24oz and that was a lot for me
I guess it all depends on the size of the Zucchini.

Made this recipe close to the directions. Precooked the meat only slightly in order to decrease the bake time but ended up baking the entire 45. The zucchinis were not ripe yet I guess, so had to cut out the insides and blended them in the food processor. They were perfect after baking, not soggy, not tough. Kept with all other directions and served with spaghetti. Used Owens premium pork sausage. It came out very good.

Taste was excellent. I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of one. Also, reading the reviews I decided to bake a little the zucchini before I filled it. 
Yes, the zucchini definitely needs prebaking, approximately 10-15 minutes. Other than that this recipe is great!!! Thank you for sharing!

I'm not a big fan of zucchini unless it's in zucchini bread. However, since my boys are huge fans of stuffed peppers, and my wife loves stuffed zucchini from our garden, I thought I would give this a try rather than the recipe we have always used. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I used mild Italian sausage, and added about two tsp. of Italian seasoning into the meat. I scooped out seeds and then microwaved zucchini for about 1 1/2 minutes. I then added everything else with an additional sprinkle of seasoning and baked it up. Served with salad and garlic bread. When I asked for opinions, they all said they loved it. I'm usually the one stuck eating the leftovers, but this time someone else snatched the final leftover serving early the next day! Move over old recipe, and hello, new stuffed zucchini recipe!

I removed the seeds first.  I have never heard of using the seeds when cooking with zucchini. I always scoop them out. Also it is a delicious dish but I am a bit concerned over the amount of calories in a serving.

Enjoyed this, however additional cooking time for zucchini is a good idea, we precooked sausage (irtaian sweet, removed casing crumbled)  while sausage was cooking, put zucchni in preheated 425 oven.  Cook about five minutes.  We drained excess grease from sausage, cut back tad on bread crumbs.  Followed all other directions as written.  We used marinara sauce. DELICIOUS will make again, perhaps add little angel hair pasta as a side tossed in butter and parm. Garnish with parsley. Thanks for recipe it's a keeper.

This is the recipe my mom used to make 40 years ago, only without the tomato sauce.  She even called it zucchini boats like the video, which I always thought was funny :)  She used to boil the zucchini for just a minute or two before cutting in half and scooping out the inside to make it easier to do that.  Excellent!  Thanks for sharing!

Added onions, minced and less Parmesan and added shredded cheese. Cooked large zucchini in oven for 20 mins while I prepped other ingredients. Very good and easy to prep.

I made this at my fiance's house. Since he doesn't have an oven we made it in his toaster oven. He's not that fond of zucchini but he decided he would try it. I forgot to buy bread crumbs and we couldn't find pork sausage so we used cubed steak. I think it came out just fine but I didnt care for the steak and he didnt care for the zucchini. But overall its a good recipe!

It was like meat sauce on zucchini instead of pasta, which was nice for a change.

Tasted awesome!  I used hot sausage and browned it before baking...baked at 350 for 30 minutes was plenty.  I used double the garlic because we love garlic so much, and I actually found it a bit too strong so I will use only one clove next time.  I also used less sauce and less breadcrumbs than the recipe called for.  This is a keeper!

This was my first attempt at any type of zucchini recipe! I had huge almost arm length zucchini (2)from my garden cut the ends off, sliced down the middle and scooped out the middle. put about an inch of water in (2) 9x13 pans and cut zuc to fit inside and turned cut side down into pans. baked in a 350 oven for about 20-25min. Meanwhile brown 1-1 1/2 lbs spicy sausage. Chop fresh green peppers, chopped jalapenos, chopped onion, half a head of garlic, 1/2 of the scooped out middles, then cook in pan with brown sausage. empty water from zuc pans, and fill zuc with mixture. scoop pasta sauce over the top. then sprinkle mozz cheese. bake uncovered about 10 min or until cheese is melted.

Pretty simple recipe, came out great. Used ground turkey instead. Do brown the meat first, that should be step 1 or done as you hollow out the squash.

Based on other reviewers, I made modifications, including my own. I thought adding the seeds would overflow the zucchini "boat", and I was right. I had more than enough filling. I discarded the seeds and used a melon baller to get them out. I added dried basil and used Jimmy Dean sausage with sage for a little more flavor. Used bread crumbs but a lower calorie panko would work as well. I omitted the sauce, as the juices from the zucchini and cheese were enough. Lastly, I omitted covering with mozzarella, to cut down on calories and work. Goes great with white wine!

Delicious and soooo easy!  I did make a few very minor changes.  I diced the zucchini flesh that was removed with the seeds and added about 1/2 C of chopped onion to the zucchini/sausage filling.  I also seasoned the zucchini shells with salt, pepper, and garlic powder before filling.  I baked mine a little longer than 45 minutes, too, just ot be sure the sausage was thoroughly cooked.  Next time I will use turkey breakfast sausage to reduce fat and calories.  My family loved this dish, and it was good reheated the next day, too!

So glad I tried this recipe! My husband and I loved it. I did brown the meat first with some onion and all the other ingredients. Glad I did because I had extra topping even though I bought jumbo zucchinis at the produce stand.Cooked in the oven for 30 minutes. I boiled pasta and put the extra meat sauce over the top. Great! Also served over rice is a good combination as pictured!

Loved this!  Placed zucchini boats in oven while making the stuffing to help ensure they fully cooked.  Had to add an extra 30 minutes at the end to fully cook the sausage though.  Next time I will partially cook the sausage before filling the boats.  Added onion and red pepper flakes to the stuffing also.  I'll make this again!

This recipe was really delicious! Even better the next day when the flavors have a chance to meld together. A couple of changes I made: used 1 lb of Jennie o Italian flavored ground turkey instead of sausage and I added one whole chopped tomato, a large bunch of fresh basil, chopped, one sautéed onion and about 3T of garlic paste as that was what I had on hand. So yummy!

These boats were fine. I only used about a cup of the spaghetti sauce and it still was way too much. Definitely cut the amount of this next time. I used a little bit more of the amount of cheese it calls for. I also pre-baked the zucchini for about 10 minutes, they turned out kind of mushy so next time I won't pre- bake them. I am thinking about substituting the spaghetti sauce for  béchamel sauce and see how    It turns out.

Delicious on it's own. No rice or pasta. Also, instead of bread crumbs, I threw in a cup of coconut flour.... The meal was great! Cooked for 45-50min and zucchini was tender and delicious!

Not bad.  I did nuke my zucchinis in the microwave because they were on the bigger size and I was afraid they would be crunchy. Also used turkey sausage because that's what I had on hand. Pretty good but I will use regular sausage next time.

Really good! Had to bake the zucchini and sauce mixture about 15 minutes longer before melting the cheese on top. Might be beneficial to bake the zucchini by itself first like others have mentioned. Would make again.

Very good. I used bulk Italian sausage instead of pork.  I also par cooked the zucchini in the  microwave before stuffing it. I did not mix the zucchini in with the sausage. Will make again with my alterations.

I definitely agree with some of the other people that say you should cook the sausage prior to putting it all in and cooking it in the oven, maybe cook it a few minutes on the stovetop first so the sausage is more done, otherwise you have to wait forever for it to cook in the oven and it makes the zucchini harden and not taste as good.  I would make it again, but I would cook the sausage almost till done then put it in the zucchini.

We really enjoyed this stuffed zucchini.  I did grill the zucchini for about 10 minutes before I stuffed it, just to soften it a bit, as I had browned the sausage beforehand as others stated.  It offered a wonderful flavor!  While we liked it as the recipe states, I think next time I will add roasted red peppers to it and maybe some fresh mozzarella on top.  The shredded mozzarella seemed a little dry to us, and I think it had to do with the bread crumb combination.  We'll definitely make it again though!

Made as stated and served over rice. It was awesome and everyone loved it! Next time I will add some spices and up the garlic. Also because everyone wound up cutting it and mixing it with the rice I will just forego all the boat making and slice the boats up in the mixture or maybe slice them and put them on the bottom and then serve it over rice. Might even make it like that it my big slow cooker. Great recipe will be cooking if often!

I used beef instead of pork, used a putanesca sauce and cover with pepper jack cheese!! I would add salt and pepper next time inside the meat and not add the seeds (for the kids sake)

I have been making this recipe for years now. I found a way to make it a lot easier though. I just dice the zucchini and mix everything together in a dish instead of stuffing the zucchinis. Saves a ton of time and work. I do not brown the beef before and I use pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce. I also add onion.

I thought it could use a bit more flavor but I liked how unique it was and the zucchini stayed crunchy even after I reheated the leftovers.

This was such a great and simple meal, instead I used turkey sausage, however it was very good. My 6 year never liked zucchini before this now he only want to eat it with the spaghetti sauce.

You can use ground chuck, beef or half beef & pork. I prefere half and half in the meat to tell you the truth. Better flavor in my opinion.

My sister gave me a huge zucchini from her garden the same day I saw this recipe. The only change I made was I used ground turkey meat.Great recipe with minimal ingredients. Will definitely make again.

I hate it when people review recipies that they fix differently, but I'm breaking my own rule. I used left over ham steak processed in a food processor which was very good but will try the sausage next time. The stuffing appeared somewhat dry and stiff so I added some EVOO. I also feft it needed seasonings so I added ground pepper, sea salt, garlic and some Italian seasoning. Now, it was wonderful for us. I am guessing it would have been a 4 b4 my changes, but it's a 5 with them!

I made this as written, not cooking the meat before it is placed in the zucchini.  It turns out similar to meatloaf in texture, but perhaps a bit denser.  I used 2 garden zukes, each 8-9 inches long (bigger than your average store-bought zuke.) Using this size, Everyone ate 1/4 of a zuke, or 1/2 of each filled zuke.  So, I got about 8 generous servings out of this, and it was the only dinner item, since it contained meat and veggies. It was very good and filling, and a new use of zucchini for me.

When ever I try out a new recipe, we as a family all vote if I should make the dish again. This one is a keeper. I think next time I'll make the "boats" a little deeper to hold all stuffing. Yum!

This dish is a little too greasy for us. It's a unique dish, but I would not serve for company. Use less meat, 1/2 the sause and only one cup cheese would improve this one. BTW I needed 4 large zuccini to fill a 9x13

Super yummy! I loved this dish! Reheats really well too - wrap in foil and bake in oven 20-30 minutes until heated through. Next time I'd pre-cook the sausage before combining into the filling - the texture was a little "soft" to me being baked only and I kept wondering if it was actually fully cooked; other than that this is an awesome dish!

I wish that I had used bigger zucchini because the stuffing was so good! We used chicken sausage because that's what we had in the fridge and put the squash in the oven until we were ready to fill it.

Good. Watch the size of zucchini though because that'll determine how long it bakes.  We had big one & we had to bake almost 2 hours.  Also, if using large zucchini I wouldn't use the seeds.

This will become a favorite way to use up zucchini for my family, however I think the measurements are a bit off.  I used 1 zucchini (about 10" long, cut in half) and it was plenty for hubby and myself.  Realizing that, I cut back on the entire recipe for my household.  We will make again and again this summer.  Thanks.

LOVE this recipe. I used gluten free bread crumbs and it is divine. My husband loves it and says I can make this anytime I want :-).

Excellent! Followed the recipe as written. Used 6 in. long zucchini, sweet Italian sausage. Turned out perfect. Zucchini was tender, sausage was cooked through and sauce and cheese topped it off beautifully. I served it as a one-dish dinner - it was very filling and delicious! We loved it!

I added sauteed onion and celery along with cooking the pork halfway in a skillet first.  It was a very good recipe.  Served it with rice and garlic bread.

My Mother made this and Hubby asked me to get the recipe.  I made it tonight and he said he couldn't stop eating it!  I had a few bigger zucchini so only used two but cut into quarters and I bet he ate a whole zucchini by himself!  He is a little guy and it surprised me when he came and asked if he could have more, I asked him to save me at least one piece he went to the dish and said "uh oh, I'd better stop there is only one more!"  I fixed a 9 x 13 and then another 8" square to fit it all.  Must be a keeper he already wants to know when I'll be fixing it again!  I used Bob Evans sausage original flavor and other than more mozzarella cheese (cheese lovers) kept everything the same.  Great recipe!!  Definitely going in my zucchini circulation!

This was so good! The only thing I did different was mix ground turkey with the Italian Sausage. I also added a little bit of water to the pan and covered it so that the zucchini boats would cook just as fast as the stuffing mix. Otherwise, I did not pre-cook my meat. My 4 year old cleaned up his plate tonight!

This is my new favorite recipe.  My only substitutions were turkey sausage instead of pork and provolone instead of mozzarella. I found that a 24 oz jar of Prego was plenty.
