what's wrong with these?  they sounded so promising i think the amount of sugar is off, now that i look at other meringue recipes.  sugar helps stiffen the egg whites and give them that shiny look.  maybe they would have held their shape better

I needed a bunch of these so I doubled the recipe.  I used 1 1/2 cups sugar because what was put in the recipe was not enough.  Other that I changed nothing else.  Really good cookie!!!!!  Thank you!!!!

This was a fabulous treat!  I used Instant Jamaican Coffee as opposed to regular, and I piped (for added height) the cookies onto my pan before I tossed them in the oven and they had a fabulous texture when they finished.  Crispy on the outside & tender and chewy on the inside.  They melted in your mouth, and the guests I served them to had nothing but rave reviews for them.  This is definitely going to be added to my holiday fav list!

Um this didn't turn out at ALL like a meringue...but it still tasted fine. I'm not sure what went wrong, I followed the directions exactly, and I mixed the ingredients for an hour (45 minutes by hand, 15 with an automatic mixer) but stiff peaks NEVER formed. So as a result the meringues were flat and airy, like strange cookies. Maybe because I'm at a high altitude (7500 feet) but I wasn't sure how to adjust. Still, they tasted good.

This is my first meringue cookie so I am not sure how it is supposed to taste.  I doubled the recipe, used 1 T. of the cocoa and instead used 1 T. instant cappacino mix toffee flavor.  Also, I didn't use any sugar, but four packets of artificial sweetener instead.  The cookies were flat, airy, light, and did melt in your mouth.  I would probably up the sugar next time while keeping everything else I changed the same.  I would make them again.  I have been dieting and these are great for a nice chocolate treat.  I ate them with a little light whipped cream and they were great!

Tasted good, even though they came out flat.  I've made meringues many times with other recipes, and haven't had them flop before.  Oh, well, they made good mocha thin crisps!

These came out of the oven flat and deflated looking. The flavor was excellent, but the texture left something to be desired. They didn't dissolve in the mouth the way meringues usually do, and were fairly hard. I'll make these again to see whether my hunch about beating them more is true, but will also try other recipes.

The flavor is amazing, but there is far too much cocoa for the whipping to actually yield soft peaks. The egg whites never pouffed up for me and I was left with flat cookies. I also doubled the sugar, which I think added to the flavor and brought the sugar content up to the level of other meringues.

I had a similar problem as many other reviewers:  I didn't have Cream of tartar so I subbed it with equal parts vinegar.  The egg whipped up beautifully within 10 min, using a hand held mixer.  But when I added all the flavor ingredients it flattened out quickly.  It baked fine, and tastes just fine (not great), but is not the shape it should be.  I may need to play with this recipe a bit more, but its not 'go to' recipe.

These are very good, but too chocolaty. (never thought I'd say that!) I'm going to cut the cocoa by 1/2 next time.

Way too chocolately for our taste!  I even added some almond extract for added flavor but it just didn't taste that good at all.  I will try a different recipe next time.

I always do the first batch as written.  Didn't work, the taste was there, and was good, but there must be something wrong with the amount of sugar.  They came out flat, like ice cream sandwich cookies.  We still ate them, but they weren't meringues.

The sugar amount for this is very off. I doubled my recipe and used almost a cup of sugar. That aside they taste great! I also bake mine at 225 F for two hours and then taking them out. When I left them in with the heat off, they cracked.

Something isn't right with the recipe.  Tried it twice and both times came out flat and chewy.

Mine came out great. But there's a trick to stiffening egg whites.
