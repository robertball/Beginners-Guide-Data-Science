Who doesn't love a purple smoothie?? My suggestion: If you want a healthier version of this use grape juice instead of grape soda, and vanilla frozen yugurt instead of ice cream.

I haven't tried this recipe but I used to make a quicker version all the time when I was a kyd (about 35-40 yrs ago).  I had found a recipe that just called for grape juice and milk and it was great.  This has got to be even better!!

I made this for the boys, using Sunkist grape soda and Turkey Hill vanilla bean ice cream. I did not need the additional milk. The boys liked it okay. Both said they didn't like the ice cubes in the smoothie and that it needs more grape soda. I'd make this again but I'd play around with the recipe a bit.

Yum!  I think next time I'll add more grape soda and less milk for a little more grape flavor.  My kids just gulped it down.

Very quick and easy to make, cheap ingredients, good flavor. What more could you ask for? I always end up adding ice cream to my smoothies anyway, so that was a big plus too. I thought it tasted rather like purple pixie sticks. Not overwhelming, just the right amount of flavor. I'm curious about useing other fuit flavored sodas for this.

While this was good, I wouldn't say great - I guess I was expecting a stronger grape flavor. Next time I will omit the extra vanilla extract added - it really gave a strong vanilla flavor with just a hint of grape, no matter how much grape pop I added.

HOLY "COW"! I'd have to say that this has been one of the best tasting beverages I've made in a while! Everything goes together. Like peas and Carrots

Ice cream is one of my all-time favorite foods, and I like grape soda.  However, I thought this was terrible.  My kids ate it, though.
