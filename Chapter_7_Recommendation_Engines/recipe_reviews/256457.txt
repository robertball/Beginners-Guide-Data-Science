This is FANTASTIC -- totally better than store bought. I will be making this at home from now on. Used my rice cooker to make the rice, added a bit more water than usual to cook it, which worked perfectly. When I blended it, I added the vanilla. I strained with a nut milk bag, and it caught all of the little particles (although there were not that many because I used more water when cooking the rice to ensure....this is better than soaking the grains overnight).  Can't wait to make this for my Mom.  Also, I used short grain rice...horchata uses long grain :)

While I appreciate the few ingredients, it tastes better with about twice as much rice (I used brown), one tablespoon sugar, and 1/8 teaspoon salt.
