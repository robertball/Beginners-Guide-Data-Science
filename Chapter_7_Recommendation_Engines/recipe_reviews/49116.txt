Good simple recipe that offers excellent flavor and great taste.  I marindated my steaks about six hours and they turned out juicy and full of great flavor

Quite good. We didn't have the recommended mustard, so I blended a spicy horseradish mustard with plain old ballpark style. The paste had a very nice flavor; the only thing I may do next time is add some fresh pressed garlic (the garlic powder in the seasoning blend wasn't enough) plus a tiny bit more balsamic vinegar. My husband states it's a keeper, and I agree.

I used this rub on venison "back-strap" steaks (a part of the tenderloin), grilled (vs. broiled) and it came out great. As I was using venison, I added 1 Tbs. of olive oil and marinated the steaks for 4 hours, which worked very well. (I doubt I'd go that long for beef, though.) I also added saut√©ed onions, mushrooms & garlic as a topper. Yummmm-O!! :)~

I didn't realize we were out of balsamic vinegar at the last minute, so we used beer in place of it - worked out very well (in my husband's estimation).  We normally use Montreal Steak Spice on all our grilled meat - but there was so much of it in this recipe we found the steak to be VERY salty.  I think we would try this recipe again, but use half Montreal Steak Spice and half "Salt Free" Montreal Steak Spice.

Great and simple recipe. Tried this on filet mignon and it was excellent. Next time, I will put carmelized onions on top or gorgonzola cheese or BOTH.

Very nice steak rub - definitely has a kick to it, but tastes good broiled or grilled!

My husband liked this but it just wasn't his favorite.  I think maybe the mustard was too much.  Its quick and easy though and doesn't make much mess.

My dad hates balsamic vinegar so I used beer instead too- and it tasted great, but I think the montreal seasoning is still a little to spicy- I used three tablespoons instead of four and I think maybe I should've used two.

Very simple and delicious recipe for steak.  I agree with a previous reviewer, though, in that a salt-free Montreal seasoning would work better - it was a little too salty as is.  But definitely a great standby recipe for wonderful steak.

My husband liked it, my son didn't. I didn't marinate because it didn't say to- might try again.

Yummy!  We really liked this recipe at our house.  I love the flavor of the spices and the balsamic vinegar.  This is the preferred marinade/rub of choice for our steaks now.
Thanks for sharing!
