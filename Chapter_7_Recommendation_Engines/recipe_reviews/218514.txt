Simple, quick, and tasty! I made it healthier by substituting Truvia for the sugar, and because I did not have fresh strawberries on hand (which is rare!) I had to use frozen. What a nice topping for the coconut pineapple light ice cream we have in the freezer!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I made a 1/2 recipe to test it. I probably didn't use quite as much lemon as suggested, just a few squeezes. This was very quick to make and would taste good on just about anything breakfast or dessert. I put it on a homemade belgian waffle from this site with whipped cream and it was great. I am some what partial to the top rated strawberry sauce on here, that has a little less sugar and some added vanilla, but this will definitely get eaten up. Thank you

This is an excellent sauce recipe!  I served it with cut-up fresh strawberries over home made pound cake, and the dessert was a total hit!  I didn't mash the berries to a fine pulp, but left quite a few chunks.  Very yummy!

Excellent, BUT... I only used half the sugar called for. Can't imagine how cloyingly sweet this would have been had I used any more! 
Also, I used strawberries I had frozen whole. I thawed them, sliced most, but left a good many of them whole.  It looked pretty that way! For vivid ruby-red color, I added a few drops of red food coloring.

I made this for a cheesecake topping and it was so delicious.  I chopped the strawberries in my blender and it made the most delicious sauce.  Freezes great.   Marian was my mother's name.  Maybe that's why it was so good.

Easy to make. Used as a topping for Belgian waffles. Wow! Excellent. Pretty sweet, though. I'd consider backing off the sugar called for.

This was actually pretty good. It's perfect for someone with a sweet tooth. Next time I'll try using 3/4 cup of sugar instead of a cup.

This was good when I made it as written. The second time I doubled it and added 1 cup water and !/2 a vanilla bean, sliced and seeded. That put it over the top!

Awesome! I made the sauce then made pancakes while it cooled for a little while. The sauce was just the right temperature for pancake topping when the pancakes where cooked.

I can't give this a fair review because I combined this sauce with a rhubarb sauce, but I believe in my initial taste tests, before I combined the two, that it was exactly what I wanted.   I'm saving this for future use.

I change things up a bit on this but use the overall idea of it.

I am allergic to corn, so instead of the Corn Starch, I use Tapioca flour.  I generally use the same amount as they say in the recipe.   You can give or take how much depending on the consistency you want.  I have found it to work well, although you will have to mix it in water (1/4-1/2 cup) first before you add it to the strawberries.   Also, Instead of fresh strawberries, I save myself A LOT of time by getting a 1 lb bag of frozen.   They taste just as good, if not better and I wait for them to soften on the stove until I mash them.    Also, to make it even easier, I use prepackaged lemon juice.    SO EASY and it is so good.

This was delicious. I too substituted stevia for the sugar. I served it over sugar free vanilla ice cream on top of a sugar free waffle brownie. Nobody even noticed or missed the lack of sugar. It was still amazingly yummy !

Simple, fast and easy. I made with both blueberries and strawberries. I used frozen fruit instead of fresh as its in the middle of winter. I also used only half a cup of sugar instead of a full cup. Turned out great.

Fantastic over fresh angle food cake with some fresh strawberries on the side. Such an easy and wonderful sauce. Get  compliments every time.
