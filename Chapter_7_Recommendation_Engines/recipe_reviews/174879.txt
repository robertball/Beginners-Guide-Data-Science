I didn't have any colored morsels (or chocolate chips)...so I mixed in some sprinkles, which added nice color.

I added 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar and two egg whites.  They turned out to be very pretty.

They have a great rate for taste, but making them were a pain.  They fell apart and wouldn't hold together.  I tried a few batches like the recipe said and wouldn't hold together.  Then I added two egg whites in hopes that would hold them together, but was unsuccessful with that too.  I used the swirl chocolate and carmel morsels......they had really good taste.  My husband loved them.  I just wished they held together better.  It wouldn't be one that I would make to bring anywhere.

I am not sure where I went wrong, but removing them off the tin foil was a real pain. A lot of the cookies ruined.  Maybe I didn't grease the foil enough? They taste wonderful, but I won't make them again.
