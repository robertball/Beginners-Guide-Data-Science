Say! I like green eggs and hash! I do! I like them. And I would eat them in a boat. And I would eat them with a goat...They are so good, so good, you see even though I used frozen spinach they worked perfectly! I made double and fed three! 
I do so like green eggs and hash. Thank you! Thank you, Brian Weld!

This is a beautiful dish.  I don't care for canned hash but chorizo or Spam are great fillings.  This was a fun and creative idea and creates a lovely omelet.  Thank you for this great idea!
