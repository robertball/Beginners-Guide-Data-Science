These were like a dry brownie, VERY dry.  Very good though, gotta love that chocolate!  I put a little bit of coconut in it too, since I had some on hand.  Taste good with French Vanilla ice cream on top.  Would make this again.

A very rich and creamy brownie!  I used fat free condensed milk and they were great!  My family loved them.  I will definitely make these again.
