I made this this morning and the idea is great.  I made it according to the recipe and I thought the dressing overpowered everything.  To start with I hate Greek yogurt and I thought it took away from the avocado.  I'm going to make it again but this time I will slice the avocado and place in on the salad then I'll use the avocado oil dressing I have. I'm giving this recipe 5 stars for the wonderful idea. And others may love the dressing.
