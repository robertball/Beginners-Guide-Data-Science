My kids LOVE this. Instead of raisins, I use crunchy peanut butter and a dried berry blend. EDITED REVIEW: I make this all the time for Bento lunches. I prepare the recipe with banana, any kind of peanut butter and whatever kind of jelly/honey I have on hand, wrap it and slice it. The kids love it and their friends think that their mother makes the best lunches.

Wow - my niece loved this! Try substituting jelly for the honey or substitute miniature chocolate chips or mini marshmallows for the raisins.  I cut it in half diagonally and seved it with an ice cold glass of milk!

This is soooo good!  I think 15 seconds in the microwave as stated by other reviewers is the key, because I put it in for 30-35 by mistake and my banana started melting. I will not do the 'open end' roll up from now on, as the honey turns to complete liquid after microwaving, so I will wrap this like a burrito from now on, and prevent the drippies of the goodness! I tried packaging it in the evening but the honey melts out and gets the tortilla gross, not sure what to do about that.  Even making it in the morning and saran wrapping it, it's mushy by the time I get in to work.  Could also be because I cut the banana in half.  Either way, I loved this recipe and I'm dying to try other things people suggested like Nutella and cinnamon.  Added a sprinkle of wheat germ which adds a nice texture and is a great way to hide something healthy for kids.

Oh Liz, these were so yummy! I used a whole wheat wrap and left out the raisins since I'm not crazy about them. I sprinkled mine with a little cinnamon and zapped it in the microwave for about 15 seconds. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

I've got the grandkids today so I made them this as a late morning snack. I used whole bananas, spread the honey on along w/ the peanut butter & they nixed the idea of raisins, so I used some mini-chocolate chips instead. I also copied Josie & microwaved for 15 seconds....yumosoblamo! (don't ask me...it's just what my eldest grandson said after taking a bite LOL) I had to steal a bite from them so I could leave an accurate review & it was so tasty that I made one up for myself. They were really messy (thanks for the heads up!) but we ate them out on the patio & had baby wipes ready til I could get them into the kitchen sink to wash up . Will make again many, many times...thanks!

These were very good.  Here's what I did.  Spread tortilla with peanut butter, sprinkled with ground flaxseed (omega-3's) then cut in half with a pizza cutter.  Some reviews said they were messier eating whole.  I used half banana and put 6 pieces on one side then drizzled with organic agave (lower glycemic than honey) and folded over.  YUM!!

Such a simple idea, but so delicious! I put a little Nutella on mine as well, then I wrap it and put it in the toaster oven for a few minutes so everything gets warm and melty. This a great, filling breakfast that gets me through to lunch.

These are just wonderful! And so simple! I've always loved peanut butter and banana sandwiches, or on toast, but I never tried it this way. What a great idea. I can't wait to try them out on my neices and nephew when I see them. I know they will like them, too. And it makes a very nutritious snack. Thank you.

yum!  i made this a little different..i had these mini bananas so i cut it up into little rounds, put some pb on a 5 inch tortilla and put the banana on half of it folded it in half and grilled it on a george foreman grill until there were grill marks..this made the pb melty and it was warm and sooo good!!!  not as quick as yours though but i think it tastes soo much better grilled!!

Interesting and different!  Be sure to use a very soft tortilla and a firm (not too ripe) banana for best texture.

These taste good, but have something to drink handy. They are dry and sticky! Maybe a little honey or jam in it would help. I think I'll try that next time.

Yum! This is now my favorite breakfast! I just do the tortilla, pb and banana. It travels well because the peanut butter kind of 'glues' the tortilla closed, making it easy to take out the door and eat in the car on the way to work.

Very popular in my family. My kids enjoy it with chocolate chips melted into the peanut butter. Good way to get bananas eaten at my house.

This was so good!

I didn't have honey or raisins, but I spread the peanutbutter and wrapped my banana up.  Then I dipped it in a little maple syrup as I ate it.  Fantastic - and a bit more food than I bargained for!  I am full!

My review is based on the reaction of my children. They gobbled them up so fast I didn't even get to try one! Great idea to use up those bananas!

I made this for my husband and put it in his lunch to take to work. I was really worried it would not keep well in the fridge over night and through out the morning because he does not put his lunch bag in the fridge. I was worried I was going to get chewed out for even trying it, but surprisingly he say he did like it. Of course he did not say much, but he didn't say don't make it again. I did not put raisins in there. I haven't tried it, but it sounds good to me.

Made this for my kids this evening and it has a huge hit.  I made it with almond butter, a few chocolate chips, banana, a tiny bit of honey and a few raisins.  I used a soft whole wheat tortilla and put it in the toaster oven to melt the chocolate and heat up the almond butter.   This is great when your kids are asking for a treat.  I think I may try to make an adult version of this with a hint of spiced rum mixed in with sliced bananas.

Bananas with PB are prob one of my fav all time treats. I make this but omit the raisins and use a slow carb wheat tortilla. It is so yummy! I know the combo is weirdo to most, but the flavors go together perfect.

This is a filling, easy, and healthy lunch or snack.  I used a whole wheat tortilla.  I love how the raisins add some chewiness.  A great change from my usual peanut butter-banana sandwiches!

Great quick snack. Kid friendly too. The honey made the peanut butter sweeter and less stick to the roof of your mouth-y. (LOL, a college education and I don't have a term for that!)

My daughter loves this. I do slice the banana lengthwise because it's a bit much whole.

I make these for my two pre-school children. The only thing I do different is that I sprinkle the banana (which I slice) and honey with cinnamon! Make sure to roll like a burrito to make it less messy.

Best snack ever!  Don't know why I never thought of this earlier!
I use small, whole-wheat tortillas and omit the raisins.

These are pretty tasty, although I don't think a recipe for them is really necessary. A very tasty and filling lunch, I didn't even remember the honey and they were still great!

Yummy snack! I used significantly less peanut butter and honey... just a thin layer of PB and a tiny little drizzle of honey. Tasty! Thanks :)

I loved this recipe.  I love peanut butter and honey so how could it be bad.  I heated it in the microwave for 10 seconds and then cut it in half.  I also sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Yummy!!! My little guy enjoyed this one too.  I cute snack or lunch for the kids.

This was an awesome recipe but I didnt have all the ingredients so I tweaked it like crazy. Instead of the tortilla I used bread, instead of honey I used maple syrup, and then I added some nutmeg,ginger,cinnamon, ground cloves, and some melted butter so it seemed like there was honey. When I took a bite it was pure heaven and it actually tasted like there was honey..Oh I also omitted the raisins.I didnt have any.

This was a terrific idea.  I used whole wheat wraps, Instead of peanut butter I used almond butter.  I left out the raisins & honey - I recommend this snack.

This was yummy!  Didn't like the raisins in it though, too chewy, so picked those out, and ended up slicing the bananas and folding the tortilla over as GodivaGirl suggested, it was much more toddler friendly that way.  Great idea for a snack and will make this again and again.  Thanks!

I left out the raisins and warmed the tortilla before I put this together and it was wonderful. The honey goes so well with the peanut butter and banana, and the tortilla is a great twist on plain old bread. Mmm-mm

Good quick and easy snack, but I found that using a tortilla made it a little dry...  I made it again with the banana/peanut butter mix on graham crackers and liked it a lot better.

I've made these many times in the past, usually on toast, but I really like the tortilla version! I came across this in the "Vegan Recipes" section, but would like to point out that it's not truly vegan, as vegan's don't eat honey (you can use jam instead). Either way, enjoy!

This was very good and easy. I omitted the honey (allergic) and just went with the banana and PB. My tortillas were big so I just used 1/2 of one. Healthy, filling snack.

Yet another fabulous breakfast. This was extremely quick and tasty. I nixed the raisins as most did with this recipe and I added Marshmallow Creme.  It reminded me of when I used to make Nutter-Flutter Sandwich's growing up, which I haven't found any recipe's for here I'll have to fix that.  Thank you for the great breakfast/snack Liz.

This was more popular when I used chocolate chips instead of raisins.  Very good, though.  I also used half a banana per tortilla.

I substituted whole wheat flour tortillas to make this recipe even healthier.  This made an excellent breakfast, with protein, whole grain, fruit, and honey for a little sweetness.  I'll be making this breakfast/snack again soon!

These tasted great. I thought the kids would eat these up but they only had a few bites each and said they didn't care for it. I think my problem was the bananas were too ripe and on the softer side. Maybe I'll try again with harder less ripe bananas. I enjoyed eating them though.

This was just alright, pretty sweet, and the smell of the tortilla kind of bothered me while eating it.  Don't think I'll make these again but they were worth the try.

I love this recipe. It's also great is you use peanut butter, favorite jam and the banana (my kids aren't honey or raisin fans). They used toothpicks to keep it together, and the suggestion of folding like a buritto helped on the messy factor(fold the bottom up and then sides in)  Crunchy pb is also a good change.
