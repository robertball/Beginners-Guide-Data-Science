I was looking for a quick and easy Goulash recipe and this one seemed to fit the requirements nicely.  I was a little concerned about using one cup of the steak sauce, but since this was the first time I was making it, and potentially the first review I wanted to make it exactly as the Chef called for.  The overall process was very easy and it did give off a nice fragrance during simmering.  The one thing that has to be said is that if you are going to like this recipe, you will have to LOVE the steak sauce you use.  It really was too vinegary for my wife and I.  Giving some thought to this now, next time I would cut back on the Steak Sauce to 1/2 a cup, and maybe use 6 oz. of Tomato Paste.  I would also definitely serve with a dollop of Sour Cream.

I had to take out the onion after the beef was cooked because my husband won't eat them, but it still turned out great! Served over extra wide homemade noodles. YUM!

It was yummy and cheap and easy. Kinda tasted like steak and A1 over noodles but my husband loves steak sauce so he loved it. I'd make it again.

I put the ingredients in the slow cooker.  I added the flour and water mixture at end of cooking.  my family thought it was delicious!  I served over ramen noodles and steamed cauliflower.  Will make again.
