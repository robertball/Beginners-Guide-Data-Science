Made as written but used fresh garlic. Make sure you use a high quality sauce as there is no seasonings other then salt and pepper in the recipe. I used Barilla spicy marinara for the sauce and used tomatoes that had Italian seasonings. After the 20 minutes of simmering I ended up needing a bit more flavor (but to each their own right) I sprinkled in some ground coriander seed and a fat pinch of brown sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. Garnished with basil my family was pretty happy.

I followed the recipe but I added mild Rotel instead of the spicy sauce and added mozzarella to the top. Family loved it and yes I will be making it again.

Great recipe. Easy to make but I did add zucchini for more nutrition. Will make again.

My daughter has food allergies so this was a good recipe for the whole family. I added Oregano and Basil which gave it more flavor. I also browned the turkey with garlic and seasoned the meat with salt/pepper. Great family meal served with garlic bread and salad!

This was excellent and hearty however I would prefer lean ground chicken as opposed to the turkey.

Very bland. While in the middle of making this I realized how bland it was going to be but at the 11th hour I did not have the skills or knowledge to turn the sow s ear into a silk purse. I would definitely have to play around with the recipe to give it some sort of distinction but I d rather just move on.

It was pretty easy and good. I would make it again and play around with different ingredients.
