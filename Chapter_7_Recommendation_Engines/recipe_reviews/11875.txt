Amazing Recipe! I have made this for years.  The only thing I do different is add 1/2 cup FRESHLY grated parmesan cheese! Very yummy!

Delicious, and it makes an excellent presentation.  I added crumbled feta cheese and cut back on the amount of dressing.

I too have been making this recipe for years with the salad supreme it just isn't the same with out that.  I also add sliced pepperoni and cubed mozzerella and fat free dressing, cuts down on the fat so I can add the pepperoni and cheese.

This recipe was really delicious. So much so that I am making it a staple of my diet.  I wish I would have taken the suggestions of others though to use the salad sensations or whatnot.  I felt it needed more tang or zest.  I will put fewer onions in as well as they were a bit overpowering.  Overall, it was delicious and nutritious and a definite keeper with just a few changes.

This is a wonderfull basic pasta salad recipe!  Use the veggies that you and your family like.  The same goes for the salad dressing, try a sundried tomato, or greek style one.  For a bit more substanitial salad, add your favorite diced cooked meats and cheese.  The possibilites are endless.

I loved this pasta salad! It was crunchy (which I love), and flavorful, and easy to make. I added pepperoni also.

Easily adaptable to your preferences. I use cherry tomatoes since I don't like raw tomatoes very much. I also omit the cucumbers, but use both red and green peppers. I also top with a healthy sprinkle of fresh parm cheese right before serving. Very refreshing and yummy. One tip: blanche the broccoli; it keeps it crispy under the dressing.   this is great as a side dish for turkey burgers or italian sausage on a roll.  Of course it's good all on it's own as well for a quick meal.

This was wonderful! I left out the olives, mushrooms, and green peppers and we LOVED it. I fixed it when family was over and everyone really enjoyed it. Not a drop left!

This is a very easy and tasty pasta  salad! I loved the colors of all the fresh veggies. I used yellow pepper instead of green (all I had!) and grape tomatoes instead of whole ones. I also omitted the mushrooms, as my family doesn't care for them. It is very good as is, and even better with some chopped imitation crab meat tossed in! Thanks for sharing; I will make this again!

I've been making this for years.  It's great for 
picnics since it makes quite a bit.  I also add a 
half bottle of "Salad Supreme" Seasoning.  More or less to taste as it can be quite salty.

Easy and fast to make. Boiling the pasta took 15 minutes. In that time I chopped all the veggies and added yellow and orange peppers to make it more colorful . I added feta cheese to my dish, my husband added olives to his. It was good and I think tomorrow it will be better when the flavors can meld.

Great fresh salad for when you just don't want lettuce. Only thing I left out was the broccoli and it just didn't even really need it.

I just made this to go with burgers tonight.  I only had whole wheat rotini so that is what I used.  All the veggies still add a lot of colour.  It is very good, but I bet it is even better after sitting a few hours.

So I absolutely love rotini  pasta! In my recipe thoguh I love to change it up and y’all should definitely try it out! I use green olives, cucumbers, parsley, cherry tomatoes, and peppers ! And I make my homemade vinaigrette by mixing lemon juice, fresh olive oil and bit of salt! And it tastes amazing! Also the olive oil keeps your salad fresh so u can storage leftovers for the Second day! Forever a classic.

Tried it and everyone loved it. Changed it a bit. Added red and orange peppers, broccoli, cukes, grape tomatoes and little yellow ones halved, red onion and few green onions, and used mini bowtie pasta. Tossed with Paul Newman Italian dressing. My first pasta salad and it's a winner!!

I was invited to a potluck and was stressing because I didn't have much time to prepare or let alone cook a large meal for the event. I came across this recipe and it saved me! I omitted the mushrooms because truthfully I'm not a fan. I decided to also add crumbled garlic and herb feta on top and used a mix of veggie and whole grain rotini. The end result was a wonderful and delicious looking salad. Easy to make large batches of, budget friendly, and an excellent way to incorporate servings of whole grain and vegetables in your diet. This was a winner in my book!

This is one of my favorite pasta salads, and the more veggies, the better, in my opinion. I used Valentine pasta for a fun change of pace.

I had the ingredients on hand so made this for a quick week night meal. So good!  I used home made Italian salad dressing and added Salad Supreme as others suggested.  Had some spicy  salami too so added that.   Quick, easy and versatile too. Thanks for sharing!

Such a fresh and healthy , cool summer lunch salad.  I added fetta cheese and spinach instead of broccoli, because that is what I had.  I made my own dressing of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, infused with fresh herbs from my garden and sea salt.   Yummy!

Excellent. Reduce the salad dressing and serve additional on the side. Canned sliced tomatoes make it quicker. Discard the canning juice

My boyfriend said, "I love this pasta salad because there isn't too much dressing". I think that sums it up! Chock full of veggies, its delicious. Thank you!

Very tasty!!! I also added a touch of Parmesan cheese and some pepper for taste. I only added 1/2 the onion the recipe requested. Will make again. Thanks.
