A good way to use ground lamb but not flavorful.  The cinnamon is a must it heightens the flavor of the lamb.  Used a small onion and onion powder, 1 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, small can of tomato paste,1 tsp of course grond pepper, 1 1/2 tsp of sea salt. sprinkle with parmesan cheese when plating. Yummy my brother who hates lamb loved it.
