I altered these to make them less caloric, and they still came out fabulous!  My daughter loved them. I substituted 2 Tbsp. Splenda for the sugar, 1/8 c. applesauce for half of the butter, two egg whites for the one egg and used nonfat milk. I also doubled the cinnamon. I ate mine completely plain - was almost like dessert instead of breakfast!

Great recipe! I added a bit more cinnamon like other reviews suggested and added a tbsp or so more splenda on top of the pancakes. I discovered they need to cook quick to be fluffy, on medium high heat. If you cook them too slow, they will turn out dense. Will definitely make again. Thank you!

So, so good!  I've made this twice already and everyone in the family really loves it.  I've just used one apple each time.  Once it was a little over a cup, once a little under, and both times it turned out fine.  I grate the apple with the skin still on, and you don't really notice it.  My only very slight complaint is that I usually make double recipes of pancakes and freeze the extra so I can just pop them in the toaster in the morning for a quick breakfast for my toddlers.  Well, for some reason these don't taste very good reheated.  Oh well, it's worth making fresh whenever we need some apple pancakes!  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

These were really tasty!  I made them for Sunday morning breakfast for my kids along with Orange Smoothies (also found on allrecipes)and they just loved it.  I also used my food processor to grate the appples - what a timesaver.  The pancakes are very dense and the apples really give this recipe that extra something special.

Very simple to make in the morning. Great tasting, if you don't use cinnamon syrup, they could definitely use more cinnamon in the batter.

These were great! I chopped the apple into tiny little pieces instead of shredding. It gave the pancakes a nice texture. I also followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the cinnamon and sugar. Served them with whipped cream. Yum :)

These were good...a nice change from plain pancakes. I think next time I will add more cinnamon though.

Wonderful pancakes! Here's my tweak: I tossed finely chopped apple with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar while I prepped the rest of the batter (I added a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients). Then I folded the cinnamon apples into the batter. Cold leftover pancakes made a great after-school snack today because the apples made the pancakes moist and tasty even without butter and syrup. Yeah, baby!

Wow!  These were great.  Very moist with just the right taste of apples.  My kids loved them.   I went to eat the leftovers next morning (I made a double batch right from the start), but someone got to them before I did.  Must go make some more now...

I've made this recipe as writtten and with a few changes, and it's fantastic both ways!  To make this recipe a bit healthier for my kids I substitute whole wheat flour for about half of the all-purpose flour and substitute honey for the sugar.  I also double the cinnamon and add about a tsp. of vanilla extract.  My kids actually prefer this recipe with the whole wheat flour - it gives the pancakes a wonderful nutty flavor that really compliments the apples and cinnamon well.  I usually double this recipe and it's the perfect amount for my family of six. Thanks for the great recipe!

I'm 14 years old, and this is the first dish I've ever cooked alone. They turned out perfectly, so moist and sweet. I doubled the recipe, and added 1/4 cup of applesauce, halved the butter, and put in about 1/8 of a cup of cinnamon. They were amazing, and I ate every single one of them.

I sure wish people would at least MAKE a recipe before giving it a 1 star rating!!! And then rate it based on how it turned out - not their nutritional bias. All the nutritional info is listed, so let people make their own decision! Nuff said.

I made this exactly as written and I was very pleased with the results. So pleased, that I will certainly make this again - but next time I want to try adding some chopped walnuts or pecans! Mmmm, I can't wait!

Too dense for a pancake in my opinion. But I doubled the apple, so I compensated by almost doubling the flour (whole wheat) which made it thick and hard to flatten so I added another egg. I thought I could skimp on the sugar but DON'T. And I'd QUADRUPLE the cinnamon. It's not very cinnamonny at all!  I'll try it again, following the recipe exactly and re-rate.

I'm only giving the recipe 4 stars because the reason it tasted as good as it did is because we ate the pancakes with some apple butter. Without it, the pancakes would have been a little bland (can' really taste the apple).

very delicious! I used 2 medium apples, and I subbed 1/2 whole wheat flour. I also made cinn. syrup, which was very yummy! I can't wait to make these again!
Edit...I started making these with applesauce rather than actual apples..I use 1/2 c. applesauce, and they are delicious and easier!

I didn't use the apples I normally would use, I just used ones I had on hand. Ignoring the apples, I didn't care of the the pancake portion. I wouldn't make these again.

Awesome pancakes, my 4 year old daughter LOVED them, so did the rest of the family. I did some changes after reading others reviews though. I added 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon and 2 tablespoons white sugar, also I used 2 regular red apples not tart ones. Overall an excellent recipe, definitely a keeper. Thanks so much for sharing!

Not what I expected from the reviews (and the photo!). I doubled the cinnamon too but they came out bland. Lumpy texture & needed to be spread around in pan or they were too thick to cook. I cooked on med-hi heat but they browned too quickly while the middle was dense. Don't think I'll make again though I like the nutrition factor of the apple.

I went heavy on the apple, light on the butter, and used mostly whole wheat flour. I also used mostly no-fat yogurt for the milk (I needed to use it up) and therefore had to add extra milk, as the batter was too thick. Delicious! I will make these again.

This delicious recipe is perfect for our Sabbath morning breakfast. One recipe is never enough for my family. The pancakes are always moist and nutritious. I recommend these pancakes to be eaten with hot cinnamon syrup!

These were not that good, followed recipe exactly and after taste testing 1st one found I needed to add extra sugar, about 1/3 cup, some vanilla, about 1/2 to 1 tsp, and an additional shredded apple, next time I will stick with my go to pancake recipe and just add some apple and cinnamon, also quite heavy only ate about half what we usually eat.

These were amazing, this is definatly going to be my pancake recipe from now on. The only thing that I did was I added a bit more milk, cinnamon and sugar like some of the others suggested.
Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was delicious! The family loved them and the kids and hubb said it was the best pancakes they've ever had:)  Only change I made was I doubled the amount of cinnamon.  This is a keeper for sure.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Very good pancakes, loved the apple texture. We actually drizzled caramel on top instead of syrup or anything else.  I bet you could substitute caramel for the sugar right in the recipe, I may try that next time.

Made them for DH this morning, I asked him how many stars so I could review them, (I can't eat pancakes)  He said, pick a star, they're good, but the more bites he took the more he raved, five stars he said :)

I Loved these. Pour a little extra oil in the skillet and they come out a little more crispy. sprinkle with powdered sugar and it's almost like an apple fritter. Used one apple, chopped.

Great recipe!  I had to add a little more flour because of the extra juice from the apples :)  But they were great!!!!

I'm sorry, there must be a mistake on this recipe.  I make pancakes every Sunday morning and enjoy trying new recipes.  I thought there was too much butter in this recipe and tried it anyway.  I couldn't eat them.  My husband ate them and the dog thought they were good, but they were dough-y in the middle and I know how to cook.  Perhaps if the butter was 2 T instead of 4 T it would be ok.  I have another recipe with apples that is similar that calls for 2 T of oil and 1/2 to 3/4 c of milk and I had a ** next to the recipe.  It also called for only 1 c of flour.  Try those substitutions and see if you like it.  I also want to note that I normally do not give a negative review but these were very disappointing.

Very good, but pancakes are dense... My kids and family like a lighter pancake.  Made these pancakes with the "Cinnamon Cream Syrup" as suggested (which was delicious).

This is an awesome recipe! What a great way to get more nutritious fruit into my kids' diets! I did use 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour instead of all white. I also increased the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. and added a couple tablespoons of wheat germ. I also added a bit more milk so the batter wasn't quite so thick. The pancakes were absolutely delicious, and my one picky eater even ate them plain without syrup. Hooray!

I have to agree these are fabulous. I tripled the recipe, served a great breakfast, and froze enough for another day. I followed everyone's advice and put in extra cinnamon. I also used half oil and half melted butter. And, since I have one of those apple peeler/corer/slicers, I used that and then just finely diced the apples. Delicious!

These pancakes came out perfect for me. I added a splash of vanilla extract, nutmeg, and extra apple. I also added a little more milk because I don't like my pancakes too thick. My family and I really enjoyed them.

Love this recipe! I did triple the amount of cinnamon though. We're big cinnamon lovers in my house. My husband and my 9 month old daughter loved how they turned out (I made little baby pancakes for her).

I made these for breakfast this morning and loved them!  Very moist and filling without being "hockey pucks."  I doubled the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon and felt this gave it just enough essence of cinnamon without being overpowering.  I highly recommend these for company day or any day!

This was very delicious. As suggested I added more cinnamon and made cinnamon syrup to serve. I did use almond milk and 1/4 cup applesauce in place of the egg, and I used olive oil in place of butter to make this a vegan recipe. I also used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour. Very fluffy and moist pancakes, I highly recommend this recipe!

I think I will just stick with regular pancakes.  These sounded better than they turned out.  I anticipated more flavor from an apple pancake.  Definitely needed the cinnamon syrup to liven it up.

I mixed the dry ingredients the night before and I mixed the chopped the apple, melted "smart balance",(instead of butter) egg and milk in the morning. I increased the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon and increased sugar to 5 teaspoons. These were great pan cakes.

As written, inedible. Pancakes need some amount of salt....1/2 tsp for the batch is plenty but without it we had to throw it away. Aside from that, this was decent, but not as apply as I expected. Next time I may replace some butter with applesauce just for the additional apple flavor.

This recipe is wonderful!! I doubled the cinnamon,added more sugar and a few drops more of milk. They turned out great!! My oldest daughter ate 2 plates. This recipe also makes a LOT. Other recipes I have tried barely made enough for our family of 5 but we had some batter left over on this one. GREAT all the way around.

I doubled the recipe and doubled the cinnamon.  I substituted whole wheat for part (3/4 cup) of the all purpose flour.  I used half milk and half buttermilk.  I mixed it all up, and it was pretty thick.  I cooked two small, tall pancakes, but then my mom made me thin it out with more buttermilk.  The first pancakes were good, and the next, thinner ones were even better.  This is the only recipe I'll use for great apple cinnamon pancakes!

These pancakes turned out very bland, they just need a bit more. Adding a tablespoon of brown sugar or honey, a 1/4 tsp salt, and and using 3/4tsp of cinnamon instead of 1/4 would make this recipe delicious. Also if you're looking for a topping idea, carmalize a couple apples in a pan with 1/4c of honey and 1tsp cinnamon....mmmmmm!

Very tasty! I did use vanilla almond milk instead of regular milk, and used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose. I would add more cinnamon and more apple next time, but that's just my own preference.

Easy and quick, I chopped 1 1/2 Granny Smith apples and put them for a whirl in my food processor.  I didn't peel them and I really liked how the green color showed throughout the pancakes.  My family enjoyed them, and next time I will double the amount of cinnamon, and maybe even add some pecans or walnuts.

Really good :)  Followed the advice to use 1/8 cup of applesauce in place of 1/8 cup butter, and used 1 tsp. cinnamon.  Turned out great!

I subbed in some buttermilk and a bit extra milk to thin it to a crepes consistency.  Then try it with a simple apple syrup made with apple juice and brown sugar!

I only had Fuji apples lying around, so I took one and chopped it into little pieces. It still turned out fantastic, though I do want to try properly shredding it next time. I also doubled the cinnamon as suggested, but still found myself wanting more. EASY SOLUTION: Sprinkling cinnamon directly onto the pancakes, and then pouring (all-natural!!) maple syrup on top of that. Instant 'cinnamon syrup'. AMAZING.

These are really good, I added more cinnamon and more sugar, and salt, did not butter the pan, there is enough butter in the pancake itself. Mine though did not turn out fluffy, they looked like the first picture. Anyone know the trick to get them fluffy?

This recipe is delicious and I did everything possible to make it not!!! Being the poor college student I am I used left over coconut oil in place of butter, water in place of milk, and quick oats in place of flour... so not poor but basically whatever I could find... they still came out crispy and tasting like a dessert!!!

These were good. I added extra cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla. Thought they could be a touch sweeter, but that could be because I'm not a syrup fan so I usually eat my pancakes plain. Thanks for the recipe!

We had our 5 year old niece overnight last night and I needed to whip up something easy for breakfast.  This was perfect.  I used Macintosh apples and used 2T sugar, 1/2t baking powder, 1/2t baking soda and 1c buttermilk (was out of regular milk) and added more cinnamon and they turned out great!  Much thicker batter than a normal pancake, but great flavor.  Our niece gets distracted easily when she eats, but when I asked her to take two more bites, she decided that 7 more would be better!

I usually fail miserably at making fluffy pancakes, but these turned out perfectly! I made them exactly as written except that I guesstimated the amount of butter (the butter in Kenya doesn't have measuring marks on it) and I chopped the apples instead of shredding them to give the pancake more texture, and I more than doubled the cinnamon. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg. No syrup here, so I ate them plain. My husband loved them.

I'm glad I tried these but I don't think I'd make them again.  They were dense and somewhat flavorless as written.  I cooked on medium-high heat and even spread the batter out so they would cook through and not burn.  My additional suggestions would be to double the cinnamon and add a pinch of salt.

I LOVE this recipe and I am not a big pancake eater. They were very easy to make. The only change I made was that I almost doubled the amount of apples. Other then that I followed the recipe and we ate them with regular maple syrup. My kids even went back for seconds. I can't wait to make them again :)

These turned out wonderfully! I substituted two egg whites for the egg, 1/8th cup applesauce for half of the butter, and added 3/4tsp more cinnamon than is called for in the recipe. They were delicious by themselves. I highly recommend this recipe and will be making it again in the near future!

Made as per recipe except that I cubed the apple into tiny bits instead of shredding it. Used 1 apple. Real good. Pancakes turned out moist and fluff. Great for b'fast. I will definitely make this again.

I love pancakes and am always trying different kinds. Although I use my own recipe for the batter and just work the new ingredients into it. So I only followed the apple flavouring part of this recipe but it was good. Only change I would make is next time I would dice the apple rather than shred it as I would like more apple flavour next time.

Quick and easy change of pace pancake recipe.  I used Bisquick instead of flour and it turned out great.  The added fiber and vitamins from the apple make it a bit less of a guilty indulgence.

loved this! But, I added  quite a bit more milk - until it got to a looser consistency.  Using the milk suggested made the batter just splat into the pan...not spread like I was taught pancakes should.

excellent and so easy! My husband does the following: he slices a tart apple, like granny smith or spartan, very thin, and then dips the apple slices in the batter. Nice if you're not feeling like grating the apple!

I doubled the cinnamon, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and instead of shredding the Empire apple, I diced it. I liked the texture but my boyfriend didn't, although he did like the flavor. Next time, I'll try shredding it instead and add more sugar.

The only reason I will give it only 4 stars is because I didn't get the "oh, this is awesome!" that I was expecting; however, every single one of those pancakes were gone (which doesn't happen with other recipes I've tried). I served these with a cinnamon syrup recipe I found on this site. I really enjoyed it and will be making it again.

Not bad! The applesauce for butter substitute (mentioned by one reviewer) works well. I doubled the cinnamon and substituted a packet of vanilla sugar and some Splenda for the white sugar. Will make again! Edit: I made this a second time, using a 2 tablespoons sugar: the packet of vanilla sugar and the rest brown sugar. It was perfect. Also, I found it's worth the time to shred the apple(s) instead of just dicing them. The pancakes cook more evenly.

Very delicious, and filling. One recipe filled up two adults and two kids, with 2 or so left over.  It was slightly bland, but I'd rather it be bland with less sugar than super sweet like others that I've made.

I made these this morning for my fiance. He had been craving his grandmothers apple pancakes. I have never made them before so I was unsure of what they should taste or look like. His grandmother has been gone for 4 years now and I really wanted to make them right. He took one bite and said they were PERFECT. I followed the recipe exactly. I used 2 small fuji apples and served them with warmed dark maple syrup. He said they tasted just like his grandmothers. Thank you for the great recipe. I will be sure to make these again and again.

My daughter used diced fuji apples (we liked little chunks better than grated apple), doubled the cinnamon but stirred the cinnamon into the apples while assembling the batter (so the cinnamon flavor stayed with the apple flavor). Then she served them with buttermilk syrup and it was like eating caramel apple pancakes for breakfast. WHAT A TREAT!

Buttermilk syrup:
1 1/2 c sugar
1/2 c butter
3/4 c buttermilk
2 T corn syrup
1 t baking soda
2 t vanilla

In large saucepan, stir together (while heating) the sugar, butter, buttermilk and corn syrup. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Boil 5-6 minutes, stirring constantly (you will notice a very slight change in color). Turn off the heat, stir in the baking soda (it will cause the syrup to foam up very high, so stir rapidly). Then add the vanilla. The result is a caramel flavored syrup. You can thin it with water if it gets too thick.

These are fantastic! I took the suggestions to double the sugar and cinamon and be sure to cook over medium high heat. I didn't want to fool with special syrup, so I used the imitation maple syrup I had on hand, and they were still great. They have been requested several times since then. Gave the leftovers to my mother for lunch, and she loved them too!

Wow, were these good!!  I used my food processor to chop the apple, which was a real timesaver (finely chopped apple was just as good as shredded apple).  I also used skim milk, and it was just fine.  I did need to add 3-4 Tbl. of milk to make the batter more spreadable.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Was alright.
Not a fan of big thick pancakes, which this was, even with additional milk.

Yum!  To make these a little more nutritious, I used half whole wheat flour, added a little wheat germ, and used half applesauce, half butter.  I doubled the cinnamon, too.  These are so good!  Definitely double the recipe, you'll want lots!

Found the pancakes to be heavy and a bit bland.  If I do make then again I would definately add more cinnamon and maybe a pinch of salt.

VERY good recipe!  DOUBLE IT FOR 4 SERVINGS AND UP!!!  We only have three in our family and it was enough for one serving each.  I did as others suggested and doubled (or tripled) the amount of cinnamon and also added a touch more sugar.  Perfect!  Thank you for sharing this new staple in our breakfast rotation!

Great recipe! Made it just like the recipe said to and it turned out yummy, fluffy pancakes. The apple cinnamon flavor was delicious. I made a butter pecan syrup to go with it (toasted pecans, cinnamon, a little butter, and syrup warmed in a saucepan). Mmmm , great fall breakfast!

They tuned out dense, and, on their own, without a lot of flavor.   With maple syrup they weren't bad.

These were pretty okay. I added a lot of extra cinnamon and they had a great flavor, but the texture wasn't that great. They turned out wet and dense and not light and fluffy like regular pancakes. I would probably use a regular pancake recipe and add apples and cinnamon to it if I make them again

These are fantastic!  They have the perfect amount of apple and the texture and thickness are spot on!  I did double up on the cinnamon which I think it needs.  This one's going in the pancake file ;)

I made these today for our "breakfast for dinner" theme and myself and my 2 kids were both really happy with them. I will do these again but I will probably add extra cinnamon and vanilla as some of the other review mention. But there is rarely enough cinnamon for me.  My 7 year old loved that she could get flavor and the texgture from the apple - may not have followed the recipe on the amount of apple - just shredded up a green apple off our tree.

Very good!  I substituted applesauce for the butter, and used whole wheat flour and 1/2 tsp cinnamon as suggested in other reviews.  I used one granny smith apple shredded.  The batter was a little thicker than other pancake batter that I was used to, but it turned out fine.  Also good served with chocolate chips and fruit syrup!

We thought these were very good and a nice change from plain pancakes.  They were fluffy and had great texture.  I used maple syrup but I think a cinnamon syrup would have been a better choice.  If I were to make them again, I would add extra cinnamon.  Thanks for sharing!

These pancakes were the best..my original plan for that Sunday was Pumpkin pancakes...all the stores were out and I knew I had apples at home. Came across this recipe and I was so impressed. Just the right sweetness, perfect cake! The kids loved them with the warm syrup.

Very yummy! Made exactly as written. They are pretty heavy - puts the "cake" in pancake. UPDATE: made these for my mother-in-law who does not like pancakes but wanted to try them. She loved them and asked for seconds! I have also made them with 1/4 whole wheat flower and they are just as good.

These were without flavor, and the consistency of play-do. I did double the recipe though I do not think that should make a difference.  I also doubled the amount of cinnamon per serving, but it still was not enough.  I was very suprised since it gets such rave reviews.  I think using Rome apples was a mistake.  They tend to be mushier and a more mild flavor than other apples. I would be curious to see what they would taste like using a different apple, but I am so dis-enchanted, I do not think that I will try...

From my 6yo daughter.  "They are super, duper, duper good."  I agree!  Mine came out fluffy - not flat - which is fine by me!  I doubled the recipe and added 1tsp cinnamon.  The BEST apple pancakes I've ever made - for sure!

These were okay, not amazing. Very dense and not light or fluffy like your typical pancake. I doubled the cinnamon and still couldn't really taste it. Based on other folks' reviews I was expecting something a little sweeter as well. They were quick to make and edible nonetheless.

These are fantastical.  The inside will be very moist because of the apples even when thoroughly cooked.  Next time we may try them with more cinnamon.

This is a nice change from regular pancakes.  For me, however, something was missing.  I am going to have to play with this recipe a bit. But overall, a good pancake recipe.

My mother taught me how to make these pancakes over 50 years ago. The only difference is that I chop my apples instead of grating them. My daughter asks for these whenever she visits. very good eats!

I thought that these pancakes were very bland....They needed something. The only good thing I can say about them was that they were moist. I will not be making them again.

This is a great pancake recipe!  I doubled the recipe but left the apple quantity the same... and substituted whole wheat as I always do.  Super tasty.  Added salt thinking I wrote it down wrong but it was a winner recipe that aside.  I also drizzled some of the butter into the pan prior to adding it to the recipe and it was a niiice finish.

Excellent recipe.  Added a hint of vanilla and nutmeg in the mix and also just used egg whites to try to cut down on the fat.  (1 egg white per two servings).  Moist and quite good - not too sweet so just right for us.  Thank you!

These are delicious pancakes! The apples are a nice, new flavor usually not found in pancakes. I took another reviewer's advice and added more cinnamon (acutally doubled it), and there was still a nice balance. Also, I sometimes substitute a little whole wheat flower, usually just about 1/4 cup, and they taste great. These pancakes just taste great!

Pretty good. I use a large Fuji apple, which yields more than one cup. Also, I substituted 1/4 cup of the AP flour with wheat germ and rolled oats, and used whole wheat flour for the rest.

Like some of the other reviewers, we sadly found these pancakes to be kind of bland.  I used Braeburn apples, which have some tartness to them, but maybe this recipe really needs a Granny Smith.  Also, I didn't realize until after I had made it, that the recipe doesn't call for that pinch of salt that most pancake recipes do, so I would try that as well.  Good idea, just didn't taste quite right to us.

These pancakes were dense and rather bland.  I tripled the cinnamon and there still wasn't much taste... I think a bit of salt (maybe 1/2 tsp) would help the flavor a lot.

I was really disappointed in this recipe.  I made it exactly as the directions stated, adding a pinch of extra cinnamon as other reviewers have suggested.  The pancakes smelled delicious while cooking, but were not pleasant to eat.  The consistency was gummy and rubbery. Not appetizing at all.  What a let down!

I really liked the flavor (I thought it was the perfect amount of sugar & cinnamon), but I wasn't a big fan of the texture.  I little too gooey on the inside.  I like fluffier pancakes better.

This is a great recipe. The batter is fluffy and delicious.  My only recommendation is rather than grating the apple into the batter try coring the apple and cutting it into thin rings.  Dip the rings into the batter and you have a bit more crunch to the pancake.

This was more yummy than I expected. I doubled the cinnamon, doubled the sugar, added 1T honey, and used 2 medium apples. Toasty/crisper on the outside and moist on the inside.  My 14 month daughter loved it and didn't leave a crumb.

Very simple and delicious recipe -- you can triple the amount of sugar for a slightly sweet pancake that you can eat with fresh fruit or a dusting of confectioner's sugar.

This recipe is great!  Quick to make and keeps well in the refrigerator for a few days.  My friend liked them very much, even though she is a health nut.  My boyfriend, who is quite the opposite, is also interested in trying them.  I find them very satisfying yet delicate.  I like using butter in the frying pan instead of oil, but that's personal taste.

My family loved these pancakes. I took the advice that some of you gave about adding extra cinnamon, plus I added a pinch of nutmeg as well. These pancakes came out delicious, and I will definitely make them again seeing they were such a big hit.

Very good!   The batter was too thin so I added more flour - maybe it's because I used cake flour...doubled the cinnamon and sugar - yummy!

I like this recipe. I did a few changes. I had no milk and used whipping cream and I did like others said. I mixed the apples with brown sugar and cinnamon and mixed in the batter. So good.

I doubled all of the recipes ingredients and tripled the apples as I used 2 small macouns and a small yellow apple I had left over and added 2  teaspoons of vanilla.  Also, I didn’t shred the apples but sliced them into thin dice size and just loved the pieces of apple in nearly every bite! Will definitely make this recipe again!!

These cakes are awesome. I substituted sugar for honey and I got the same great taste. I also use a mixture of whole wheat and white flour. Awesome!
No more buying pancake mix for me.

Nice, but I added more milk to thin the mix and make them spread better in the pan. When I make them  again I will also add another tablespoon of sugar . Definitely worth another try!

This was a delicious and easy recipe for a birthday weekend brunch. I added a tsp of vanilla extract to the liquids, and a couple Tbsp of apple juice to thin the batter a little to spread easier on my griddle. 

The suggestion of spiced syrup by the author was spot on, I heated 3/4 cup pancake syrup with 1/2 tsp cinnamon and ground nutmeg stirred in. Yummy!

After reading other reviews I doubled the cinnamon and tbh I could have tripled it. I also wish I had added more sugar and more apples as well. There just was not enough apples imo. I tasted more batter than anything else. They were still delicious but not what I imagined they would be. My mom used to make them with and apple to batter ratio about 3:1. This way it is primarily apples. I will try this again another time.

I chose this based in the number of 5 star reviews - don’t have time to read them,  assumed  the amount of good v.bad reviews would indicate at least a decent recipe. I Followed recipe exactly. not good. At all. 
No taste and weird texture.  EVERY 5 star review altered the recipe in some way-  I consider a 5star to not need adjustments for flavor and texture, and CLEARLY everyone did not think the flavor of baking powder  is good since they ALL increased  the cinnamon. 

So I will say, next time I would add vanilla, more cinnamon, more sugar and probably some baking soda so they spread, and not call them apple pancakes.

These were very stodgy. Also bland. They need salt. Probably double the cinnamon, if not more. Possibly more leavening. My inclination is they'd be better subbing in buttermilk, then + 1/2 tsp baking soda, and +1/4-1/2 tsp salt. And 1/2-1tsp of cinnamon instead.

For my taste, this recipe needs to add 1/4 tsp salt.  Next time I make these good pancakes, I'll make certain to use Granny Smith apples versus the lesser flavorful ones I had on hand.  My yield was 18 3-4" pancakes., easily enough for 3 good servings.

Followed recipe, would likely not make again. Pancakes were pretty good right off the griddle, but not as good the next day, and not as good frozen and warmed in the toaster oven. Found them to be a bit gummy when they were reheated.

Very nice. As most reviewers have mentioned, they're denser than a buttermilk pancake but that was completely expected.  I really liked that they tasted very good without any syrup.  I cut down a wee bit on the butter and sugar - personal taste - and added a bit more shredded apple. I definitely plan to make this recipe again. Nice change from regular pancakes.

I made these so I can freeze them in small ziplocks and take them out when I want them.
The basic recipe is fine. I actually added 2 small-medium carrots and added apple pie spice and a little extra cinnamon. DELISH =) Thanks! (I must say I don't know how it would taste without all what I added).

Very good.  Not a lot of apple flavor, but delicious nevertheless.  Increased the cinnamon to like 3/4 of a teaspoon and it was the right decision for us.  Used apple cider syrup on these.  Winner.

I made these as the recipe suggested except that I used 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon, and I added a bit more milk to thin them out some.  The pancakes were delicious with or without syrup.  I plan to make these again.  If I were to make any more changes, I would maybe try a little vanilla for added flavor.

These were the best pancakes I've ever made, while making it my own and gluten free. They were fluffy with the perfect hint of sweetness and it created those bubbles in the batter I love seeing when it hits the heat. 

These are my adjustment:
1 tbsp of butter instead of a 1/4 cup
1/2 buttermilk (it was left over and needed to be used) 1/2 almond milk
1 tbsp brown sugar instead of white
2 tbsp of coconut flakes (also left over)
1 1/4 cups all-purpose gluten free flour
1/2 tsp festive spice ( blend of allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg) instead of 1/4 tsp cinnamon

We thought these were terrific.  I did decrease the amount of butter by half and added fresh grated nutmeg but otherwise it was the same.  I would happily make them again.

These weren't bad, but they weren't as flavorful as we were hoping. My husband liked how moist they were, but I thought they were a little too moist.  It was good to use up an apple that was past its prime, but I wouldn't make these again.

I am giving it a four star rating for the recipe as is, but for the secone batch I made, I added 1/2 tsp salt and doubled the cinnamon.  My family said the difference was night and day.  We had both versions at the same sitting.

Yum!  Added some pecans to the top and a little shake of sugar in the raw to caramelize on the flip side.  Used a full tsp of cinnamon & a drizzle of vanilla.  Will def make again.

This tasted like my Oma's !  I will add a bit more cinnamon next time.  Other than that, I wouldn't do anything differently.  These pancakes are a bit thick, but that is how I remember them as a kid.  I cooked them with a lower heat so that they would cook through.

Great recipe, especially for using whole wheat flour. The shredded apples helped the whole wheat flour become moist and made for some fluffy pancakes. Added the extra cinnamon as others recommended. Turned out great!

Delicious and surprisingly fluffy, was afraid might be chewy because of apples and it's juice content.  I grated half the apples and thinly sliced the rest because I like a little crunch.  I followed recipe exactly and I think it's helpful when people post some variations (like adding little more sugar or cinnamon).  But it annoys me when people change the recipe amounts completely then rate it based on their version.   If you double the apples and then dump in extra flour without understanding proportions and chemical reactions involved in cooking, then you shouldn't complain about your results.  Reviews are very helpful when searching for recipes, so I appreciate the people who take time to do it!

We bought apples yesterday at a festival and I was looking for some new and interesting ways to use them besides "just" pie or cake. Found this recipe and made them this AM. They are very good. I followed the recipe exactly. I think next time I'll use brown sugar instead of the white sugar for a little sweeter taste.

These pancakes turned out very fluffy and flavourful.  We all liked them. The only change I made was  I put maple sugar instead if white sugar. I saved this recipe and will make them again - many more times. Thank you so much for sharing  it with all of us.

These pancakes were so delicious. The first time I made them, I forgot to let the shredded apples drain. They were soggy and didn't rise. The second time, I substituted the baking powder for baking soda and drained the apples. The pancakes rose like a picture and they were so delicious. I will definitely make them again.

I made the recipe as-is (+double cinnamon per recommendations) and then again with more milk, and neither came out well.  The flavor is good and warrants the two stars, but the texture is terrible.  The pancakes are not fluffy in the slightest and stay gummy and doughy in the center because of the shredded apple, which releases liquid as it cooks, making the interior soggier than a pancake should be.  I tried thinning the batter, thinking it might just be that the dough was too stiff (and therefore the interior wasn't cooking), but that only helped slightly.  In the future will stick to the recipes that par-cook the apples first (or maybe just keep them as a topping).

Very delicious! I added 1/4 cup more liquid, in the form of buttermilk. Definitely increase the cinnamon! I doubled it, and even sprinkled extra on the finished pancakes. Add 1 tsp vanilla, also. Tastes like a Dutch baby Apple pancake without the long baking time ??.

This was a great basic recipe that you can definitely tweek and make your own according to your liking. I doubled the cinnamon and sugar. I added some nutmeg and a teaspoon of vanilla. They came out great. Thanks so much!

My family thought it was great but here was the problem, the pancakes were bland and you couldn't even feel the apple! Then, the dough of the pancake had almost no sweetness, causing the dough to absorb most of the flavor, not allowing any specific taste to be found. I'm sorry if it was just me but it really grossed me out. Hope someone else liked it though!

These pancakes were a huge hit! I doubled the recipe which yielded 13 pancakes using my #50 scoop. I used 2 tbsps butter, doubled the cinnamon and added 1 tsp vanilla, used 1/2 ap flour and 1/2 white whole wheat. Used 2 Spartan apples. Add less milk then called for and add more after adding apple depending on how moist they are.

I made this once with coconut oil instead of butter and would not recommend this substitution. The butter makes all the difference. Might need a bit extra milk and cinnamon but otherwise really like this recipe as is.

Delicious.  I chopped the apple finely because I couldn't find my grater, and it turned out really well.  As someone who struggles with flipping pancakes and usually makes a huge mess, I appreciated how well these held together.

Delicious taste, kids ate it more than other pancakes. mine turned out a little too thick and chewy rather than fluffy, but I did modify the recipe (replace all butter with coconut oil because didn't have any butter left, and cooked them in coconut oil). I also shredded the apples on the fine shredded which made them more like applesauce than shredded apples. I will make again. Great way to use uneaten apples about to go bad.

The flavor was good, but I found that it didn't have enough cinnamon.  The batter came out very dense.  I would mix the batter first so that I can make sure it is smooth and add the apples at the end.

Important to spread the batter in the pan slightly to thin these out otherwise they are a wee bit doughy. Delicious! And easy. Had to sub 1/2 a cup of milk for plain yogurt as I was out of milk (oops) but it worked great.

This needs more liquid, and more seasoning, like vanilla and salt. Batter was so thick, and the pancakes tasted floury.

My family loved this!  I doubled the recipe (but forgot to double the sugar!) and made half the flour whole wheat.  I wasn't paying attention when I was shedding the apples with my Cuisinart, and ended up with twice as many apples, so I blended them with a little water and a generous Tablespoon or so of unsulphured molasses to make a "syrup".  My two year old just kept eating them.  Oh, and doubled the cinnamon!  Could still have probably put some in the syrup, too...

These were a huge hit with my toddler, who ate four of them for dinner the night I made them. And this is a kid who normally doesn't go for apples. I'm planning to make another batch and freeze them for future breakfasts. I liked them, too, although the apple flavor was very subtle.

We liked the flavor of these pancakes and the texture.  Here's the problem that kept them from getting a 5-star rating from me.  They burn easily.  They were black in no time on the griddle, even after reducing the heat.  I think it's due to the apple in the mix...sweet ingredients can burn faster when using this cooking method.  I did double the sugar and cinnamon as other's suggested.  Again, we loved the flavor, although I had to scrape off the burned edges and middle areas.  I also followed other reviewer's suggestions and made Cinnamon Syrup (from this site).  In my opinion, this made the pancakes even more special.  A great Fall breakfast!

Really, really bland. Recipe needs a little more sugar and cinnamon, and maybe a pinch of salt. Wish I had read all the reviews before making these. Some syrup could have saved them but I was all out.

These were a nice change from regular pancakes. The shredded apples gave a bit of crunch/texture to the pancake that was unique. I warmed maple syrup with a cinnamon stick to use over them, which was great, but a little more cinnamon in the batter would have helped the flavor. The batter is thicker than I'm used to for pancakes but the texture was good.

These were a quick and easy Wednesday morning breakfast for my boys before school and work. I was glad that I had read the other reviews (as I usually do) prior to making and doubled both the cinnamon and the sugar. I also added a 1/4 tsp of salt to cut back on the bitterness of the flour. Other than that I didn't change anything and used two small apples that I shredded, skin on and cored in my food processor. Thank you, this is a keeper!

I did the recipe to a "T" and my kids loved it!! I did make sautéed apples to go on top and that turned out like a 5 star restaurant recipe! I did however finely chop my apples instead of shredding them! thank you for the recipe!

It is probably a 3.5 for me. I added the extra cinnamon as recommended and extra sugar. I added walnuts to boost the flavor. It was a good recipe, but not quite as tasty as Fanny Farmer's apple griddlecakes. Still, it's a good way to use up our bumper crop of apples! Thanks for sharing!

LOVED it!! They look a little rubbery, and they're a tad greasy(don't need to use anything in the pan!)...BUT THEY'RE SOOOO TASTY!! Everyone gobbled them up! My daughter had applesauce on hers and loved it, the rest of us stuck with real maple syrup! Great recipe!

I found the mix a little bland with very little flavour. I would suggest to add a pinch of salt, it brings out the flavour, and a tad more cinnamon even grating a cinnamon stick would be much better. Also the pancakes were very dense, so if you chop the apples try to make them smaller.

We liked it! Mixed the batter and then put it in the blender for a smooth batter. Need to had some more sugar and cinnamon to it, which I will do the next time I make it.

Very yummy.  The kids really liked them and were willing to eat them without chocolate chips (a miracle).  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup regular, and 1/4 cup flax.  I might try using apple sauce instead of butter next time.

I doubled the cinnamon as people had mentioned, chopped the apples instead of shredding, and used 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  Topped with maple syrup - FANTASTIC!!!!

These didn't turn out great for me. Granted, I didn't follow the recipe exactly: I substitute coconut oil for butter (due to lack of butter) and added more spice (cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg). 

However, it's the texture of these pancakes that are getting the low stars.  Despite trying different temperatures to cook at, they were always mushy in the middle and wanted to fall apart. They didn't poof up much either, not at all fluffy.  

That didn't keep my husband from eating the entire batch though!

Great recipe!!! My nieces loved them so much (no kids:) The only adjustment I made was add extra cinnamon to the batter. I may never make ordinary pancakes again.

These are the greatest pancakes ever!  They almost remind me of an apple custard...kind of eggy flavored, but I loved that!  I have made these several times and because I am gluten intolerant I substitute the flour for my own flour blend.  I always have to use more flour or less milk than the recipe calls for because it's too soupy.  With that adjustment, they are to die for, and my 17 mo. daughter would agree whole heartedly!

These are absolutely delicious! They taste like an apple-y french toast. I shredded the apples with the peel on and it was fine, they were not hard or crunchy inside.

After picking too many apples last fall, I was eager for some new apple recipes.  Since I'm a big fan of pancakes, I decided to try this recipe.  It did not disappoint - these pancakes are fantastic!

These were great! The mods i made was to add 3/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1tsp vanilla, and 2 tbsp sugar. When pouring onto the griddle i made sure i evened out the batter since the apple tends to gather in the middle. That seemed to alleviate the "dense" texture. They were very moist but not soggy. Will definitely make again!

These were really good.  I'm not a pancake fan, but I did enjoy these.  I used red delicious apples, so my bf thought they were a bit bland, but I'm positive he'd like them better if I had used a tart apple like the recipe says to.

I thought the batter was a little thick, next time I will use 1 cup of flour and see how that works, I forgot the sugar, but I liked the tartness of the apples. And I used pumpkin pie spices. We enjoyed them.

I have been looking for a good recipe for Apple Pancakes and I found it here.  Always double the recipe and my two toddlers who are picky breakfast eats finish 2 each. This recipe was also Wonderful because it taste great without cinnamon which one of my children is severely allergic to, was going to try to make some of the health changes that were mentioned by other reviews.

These were AWESOME!!!  I made a double recipe and my husband and son ate all except 3.  I made cinnamon, cardamon syrup to go with it and their response was "This is plate licking good."  Thank you Veronica.

Good flavour.  Like others I upped the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp (could have used more) and I added 1/2 tsp salt.

Good recipe. I used half whole wheat flour and brown sugar, and 50% more cinnamon (I know, it's obnoxious to change a recipe so much and rate it). DO NOT follow the other reviewers' advice to up the normal pancake cooking temperature. I tried medium-high as suggested and lost my first batch immediately because they blackened right away. Very moist and tasty, and shredded apple fixes that problem of awkward chunky pieces of apple.

5 for flavor, 5 for being quick & easy. I halved the recipe, but used 1 egg so needed to add a couple of extra tsps of flour.

I made these pancakes this morning using brown sugar and sweet apples, then halved the recipe and omitted the egg to make a kind of sweet gravy to pour on top of the cooked ones. Better than using syrup that is loaded with sugar.

My entire family LOVED these, even my picky 9 year old son.  I mixed a bit of maple syrup with the kids' preferred fake syrup and a sprinkling of cinnamon, all warmed in microwave for the cinnamon syrup.  My only suggestion would be a pinch or more of salt, the flavors needed a bit of a pick me up.  Otherwise, a delicious Saturday morning breakfast served with maple sausages.

Delicious with freshly picked galas! My kids gobbled up four each...a record for them. Good thing I doubled the recipe. I served them with the recipe for hot cinnamon sauce. Felt more like dessert than breakfast! But everyone loved them.

Excellent recipe. My tips: fine to lower the butter. No need to grease a pan if you use Teflon. I use two small pans to get them cooked faster for the family. Splenda instead of sugar works great--I increase the amount a bit. One green apple works fine for 4 pancakes. Drop the cinnamon if you're not a huge fan (like me). I top it with grade A maple syrup and some homemade whipped cream. Fantastic stuff.

Super tasty!  I doubled the recipe to start with based on reviews of how quickly they were eaten.  My selective children even ate them!  3 & 5 yr old.  Next time I will make them healthier though.  But quite the indulgence for all that butter!  I ate them plain, my kids put applesauce and cinn/sugar sprinkles on them.  Very good.  Will make again for sure!

These were great. I made some adjustments to make them healthy. I doubled the recipe too. I substituted the butter with apple sauce. I used 1 egg and two egg whites, and half whole wheat flour I also doubled the cinnamon and added a quarter teaspoon each of nutmeg and ground cloves. I couldn't belive these were healthy by the way they taste!

I have to agree with everyone else, these are delicious.  I substituted half of the butter with cinnamon applesauce and used wheat germ for 1/4 c of the flour.

These were SO yum.

I used buttermilk, added a little vanilla flavoring and because I only had a small green apple and it wasn't enough for the recipe, I threw in a handful and a half of shredded carrot.

These cooked up thick and fluffy. The kids and I loved them. We had them with 
Absolute Best Pancake Syrup which made them even better. 

I'll make these again for sure.

These were good.. I just couldn´t taste the apple flavour too much in them... I guess I would add more next time. And they didn´t turn out as light and fluffy as I thought they would.. the batter was very thick as well..

I thought these pancakes were a bit bland and dense.  But I see much potential and will probably work with the recipe a bit more to tweak it to my liking.  So far, I have substituted 1 c. of the flour for wheat flour, and I added a bit more milk to the batter to make it less dense.  I agree that there needs to be more cinnamon... and perhaps allspice?

I tried this recipe today for breakfast and really enjoyed it.  I felt the batter was perhaps a bit on the thick side but a tad more milk next time will correct that.  This may not have been the recipes fault but the weather here today.  All in all, I will definitely be making these pancakes again in the future.  I made cinnamon cream syrup to go with them and that turned out to be a perfect choice.

I guess I'm different than most people here because I didn't like these at all.  I made them exactly as stated, although I did add more cinnamon like most reviewers said, but I thought these were...well, gross.   I didn't like the texture or the taste I won't be making them again, sorry!

I made this recipe before, but tried something diffrent this time.  To add an even healthier kick, I sub. the 1/4c flour with wheat bran, and the cup with wheat flour. Also added a splash more milk to thin out slightly.  I always use splenda for the sugar.  Original is great, and with my changes/additions turned out great as well.

This pancakes went over very well with my picky eaters.  I did follow the advise of others and added more cinnamon, sugar (used Slenda) and milk to thin it out slightly.  Will definately make this recipe again.

We just made these for Christmas brunch and they were wonderful! I expected them to be a little sweeter so next time I will either use a different type of apple or add more sugar but it was a great way to start our morning.

We love this recipe - it is one of my top 3 pancake recipes of all time.  I am on a dairy-free diet due to allergies and I substitute melted coconut oil for the butter and vanilla Rice Dream rice milk for the milk and they are still delicious.  I also double the cinnamon b/c i love cinnamon.

This was nice. I have made these so many times i'm just going to write the recipe down and kept it so i wont keep having to look it up. it is cookbook material. It is a good recipe to have children help with. even my 2 yr old got in on it. I added more sugar than said. and we didnt have apples the first time so i reduced the milk and added apple juice. YUMMMMMY. Be careful not to add anymore liquid than said in this recipe, it will make your pancakes too moist (wet) on the inside.

my family wasn't a big fan of these - i didn't like the texture or the taste.  I omitted the apples and added extra cinnamon as sugggested in another review.  I wouldn't bother to make these again.

No suggestions here--I loved them as is.  What a nice change from regular, blah pancakes without much more work at all.  Even my very picky 21 month-old ate four!

I made this recipe for my family this morning.  I added about 1/8th of a cup more milk to make the batter less dense.  I didn't add the apples into the batter, I actually made the batter and placed sliced apples and blueberries on top.  It was a hit!  My husband said "You can make these pancakes anytime for me :)"  Very good.  They were quite light tasting.  I also sprinkled a little bit of sugar on the top of each finished pancake.  Yum.

Great pancakes!!! I wasn't sure whether or not you should leave the skins on the apples when you shredded them, but it's good either way!

So yummy and easy.  I had all the ingredients on hand so I though I would try this one and I am glad I did.  I  added more cinnamon like others suggested and they turned out great. I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks!

I gave these a three because they didn't really have the flavor I was looking for.  I may try them again but this time I will try "seasoning" the apples the same way I would for an apple pie and then add the rest of the ingredients.  They seemed a little bland to me and my young kids didn't like them.  I did enjoy them with the recipe for Creamy Cinnamon Syrup.

Excellent!  I added a bit more cinnamon since I didn't use cinnamon syrup.  My husband also loved them!
