My 18 yr old son actually ran across this recipe and surprised our family by making it for a lite dinner one night.  It is Wonderful!!  I have since made this twice for home and potluck at work.  I have been asked repeatedly for the recipe, and it always gets rave reviews from everyone.  It is a very flexible recipe.  I've used different types of refried beans (chunky and black) both have been great!  We have also used shredded Mexican or Taco cheese with great results.  You will really enjoy this recipe!  Thanks to Diana for submitting it!!

If I can make it well, anyone can!  And it all got eaten (FAST!).  It also looked great on the plate and the fat-conscious women ate just as much as everyone else!

This was delicious. By topping it with a not too spicy salsa, I found it to be an easy way to get extra veggies into my 6 year old. It was equally appreciated by her college age brother and his friends. It was easy and quick, too.

Tasty and pretty simple to prepare. Added seasoned ground beef to make this more of a taco salad.

Excellent appetizer!  Prep time was more like 30 minutes, but it was well worth it.  Everyone loved it and I'll definitely make it again.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I didn't have any miracle whip on hand so I added extra sour cream and some fatfree ranch dressing.  And if you want to make this a little healthier, cut up green peppers in large chunks to dip in the salad instead of chips.

This was very good.  I just added more lettuce to make it more of a salad than a dip.  I served it for dinner and also added corn to make it more substantianl.

Great way to use up leftover refried beans. I omitted the mayo and black olives and lettuce. I didn't have any tortilla chips so I just used tortilla shells. I did warm my beans up, I don't like cold beans all that much!

okay, I give this 4 and a half stars.  I would suggest keeping the lettuce on the side if you plan on keeping this more than a day.  It gets super soggy.  I made the taco seasoning from the taco seasoning 1 recipe on this site and added ranch dressing to the sour cream.  This was delish!!  I like the idea of tossing it with lettuce to make a taco salad.  YUM!

Very quick and easy. I think you need much less lettuce; I only used two large leaves. 8-10 kalamata olives are also good.

I loved the idea of this but used half ranch and spicy ranch dressing instead of miracle whip since I'm not a miracle whip fan.  Made flour tortilla bowls and fried them and stuffed this recipe in with extra cheese.was great.
