Anyone with any knowledge of cooking, especially if you've ever eaten buffalo wings, would know that a half teaspoon of hot sauce is ridiculous!!  The hot sauce is always the main ingredient.  It would make more sense if the butter and hot sauce were reversed.  I would say you would need close to a half cup of hot sauce.  The way true buffalo wings are made is to deep fry them first and then put them in a bowl and slather them with the sauce and serve with the blue cheese dressing.  That's it--ask anyone in Buffalo.  If a recipe sounds ridiculous, then alter it!

The recipe calls for waaaaaay too much of almost everything!  After I made this I had enough blue cheese dressing left over to cover at least two large salads!  Cut everything in half and you'll do fine.  There was also waaaaay too much butter.  If you use this much you'll waste at least half.  Cut that down as well.  Then there's not near enough hot sauce.  If you just want buttery chicken wings, I guess the recipe's okay, but if you want buffalo wings - use at least 3, yes I said 3, TABLESPOONS of hot sauce.  Outside of all that - it tasted pretty good.

I was disappointed with these.  I made them for a party and they didn't go over as well as I hoped.  They weren't spicy enough, and seemed to swim in butter.  Next time I'd broil them instead of bake, and marinade in the sauce first.

Very good, liked it at all. They are not really spicy though, so it might not be for everyone.

I used this recipe because I thought baking would enhance the crispy/saucy flavor.  WRONG!  Frying is certainly the way to go--- all the way!  The sauce totally lost itself after baking and I'll bet it wouldn't have if I hadn't baked them.  But as everyone else has said, the bleu cheese dip is uber yummy!

This is pretty  good. I altered the recipe tho I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce , which I heated with butter. Do be careful of sodium intake. Frank's is pretty salty and so is salted butter. My lil mistake.  The blue cheese dipping for me at least came out awesome.   If you don't have a deep fryer like myself or don't want to use a lot of oil. About half a cup in a frying pan high heat. Do not overcrowd your pan it will drop the tem and your wings will be soggy. Basically once you start to see some colour take em out and follow the recipe as is.

I believe there was a mistake in copying this recipe. It should have been 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 CUP hot sauce. That is the basic recipe, then the ratio of these two ingredients to each other are adjusted according to how hot you like your wings and how hot your hot sauce is. Also-wings can vary greatly in size, some very small, and some so huge you'd think they were turkey wings. Average wings fry about 15 min. at 375 degrees to be done, without the additional oven time, so if your wings are huge, fry them longer, maybe 12 minutes, before you bake them. These are good wings even without the S&P. I like to sprinkle them with cayenne pepper and a little garlic powder before frying.

I only made the Blue Cheese dressing, the wing recipe sounds good but I agree with the other reviewers in that it sounds like not enough hot sauce - as for the Blue Cheese MMMMM!!!

I love Blue Cheese dressing, so this is a great dressing/dip - but be aware it does make a lot so be prepared to be eating it for a while!!!! (just keep making lots of chicken wings!!!)

This is a great recipe. We had all the ingredients at home and didn't have to shop for anything.   I did just as the recipe said, except for the sauce, I did 1/4 cup butter with 1/2 cup hot sauce.  I used a generic grocery store hot sauce.  I first deep fried my wings for 8-9 minutes. Than after the sauce mixture got warm, I tossed the wings in a bowl with the sauce.    I baked the wings for 20 minutes and Turned them twice between the time; adding hot sauce to the top of the wings from the bottle each time.   After that 20 minutes was done, I turned the oven on broil 3 minutes on each side; again every time I turned the wings added more hot sauce.    I noticed a lot of the reviews said the wing sauce was not HOT enough and I love my wings spicy so I added enough to generously coat them.  The picture to this recipe was added by us, first time making them and they were AMAZING!   Again, great recipe haven't made the blue cheese dressing yet but we will the next time we make these!

I practically grew up at the Anchor Bar in Buffalo NY the originators of buffalo wings and I know the true original recipe and all I will say is that the brand of hot sauce is important also a very important ingredient in the shaking sauce is missing!!

My friends and I are HUGE blue cheese fans.  This dressing rocked!  Even using low fat ingredients.  The wings were okay.  Didn't turn out very spicy, even with a whole bottle of habanero sauce.  Still, flavor and texture were terrific, especially with the dressing!!!

The blue cheese dip recipe is amazing!  I made it with light mayo and light sour cream and it was fabulous!  Great as a veggie dip... to use it as a salad dressing I would thin it out with a little milk.

i think it should be half cup of hot sauce, instead of half teaspoon.  From other recipes I have seen, butter and hot sauce are pretty much equal.

This recipe was great.  I tripled the amount of hot sauce, though I found the level of spice was almost non existent.  The wings were still excellent, and I will have to try this again with much hotter sauce.  The blue cheese was amazing.  My husband doesn't really like blue cheese, but found this particular recipe to be very tasty.

I'm not sure how other people cooked their wings and got them crispy.  Mine were just cooked.  After reading the ingredients I knew the sauce was not going to be spicy so I improvised with Paprika, Cayenne Pepper, and Chili Powder.  I also added dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, black pepper, and almost an entire bottle of hot sauce.  I agree with some of the other reviews - too much butter.  The blue cheese dressing is fabulous however!

D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!  I made a 10 lb bag for New Year's Eve and they came out perfect - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  After frying the wings I put them in the saucepan with the hot sauce mixture and put the cover on the pan and shook them up and they covered perfectly.  I used to just fry them until done but after frying then baking them in the oven with the sauce they came out sooooooo crispy, that is the secret.  My husband grew up in Buffalo, N.Y. and he said these were really good wings!  We like more sauce, (I used Frank's hot sauce).  I used store bought dressing but next time I will try the home made recipe.  These were easy and I will make them again.  Thank you William for a great wing recipe!

I don't eat chicken that still lookes like it did before you killed it, but I made this for my husband and he liked it. I made one change - I added 2 tsp of Habinero Hot Sause because he likes it hot. It still didn't have the zing I was looking for. I'm looking for a citrus I think. I didn't make the dressing because he is not a fan of blue cheese. Still, it was good if you aren't looking for a low-fat meal.

Sorry I didn't care for this recipe.  I agree that it is was way too much butter, not spicy enough, the sauce didn't stick to the wings and I now have fatty blue cheese dressing coming out my ears.  Everyone's tastes are different!

This was AWESOME!!!! I grilled chicken drummies, then mixed the sauce, coated the chicken and baked for 20 minutes.  The sauce was absolutely the BEST and these were a hit at our party.  Will make again for sure!!!!!!!

I wish I had read the last few reviews before settling on this recipe.  It took me two hours to make them, and they were not buffalo wings.  I added way more hot sauce than the recipe called for and all I could taste was the butter.  My fiance said they were okay, but I'm not a big fan of greasy food, so I hated them.  Overall, this was not a good experience.

I only made the blue cheese dressing as I wanted to first try out another wings recipe. The dip is divine!! I will keep on hand the ingredients and make it on a regular basis. As I didn't have everything on hand I used fresh sage instead of parsley and added a teaspoon of sugar. It is a lot so we had the leftovers with KFC Zinger wings, which also worked like a bomb!

I feel 1/2 teaspoon hot pepper sauce was not even close to giving me the color let alone the taste. Am I missing something here?

Wings very were good! I added a bit more hot sauce. But it was the Blue Cheese Dressing that won our hearts.  Absolutely delicious!  Better than the bottled version any day.  Will definitely make again! (:

I found that the sauce does not stick to the wings very well. We like wings sticky.

I am a fan of spicy wings, so I added more hot sauce to the recipe.  The blue cheese dressing was tasty.  Overall a solid recipe.
