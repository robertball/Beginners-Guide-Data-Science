I am a huge fan of smoothies and have found tons of easy variations. I wash and freeze the kale. Once frozen it breaks into such small pieces it blends great!

wow, this was great. i made it for my 2 year old thinking it would be healthy, but never thinking i would drink it and i ended up loving it as much as my son did. the only thing i did different was i didn't freeze the banana before blending, instead i made popsciles out of it. Great summer time treat and healthy too.

I will definately try this as I have bone cancer that metastisized after breast cancer 8 years ago.  Kale is just one of the top foods I am supposed to eat. Like the idea of freezing it as it always spoiled before I could eat the very large bunch.

I make this almost every morning for breakfast.  I first made it as written, but then I started subbing fruit for what I had in the fridge.  Pears work wonderfully, instead of apples.  I also add some kale for its healthful benefits.  Just don't overdo it; the kale becomes really bitter before you know it!

Simple and delicious. The first time I made it, it was way too thick. It was more like a meal than a smoothie, and I threw it out pretty quickly. The next time I blended the ingredients one at a time. I first added kale and some orange juice. Next, I added the frozen banana pieces, 2 at a time. This was followed by the flax seed, coconut oil, and finally the milk. I recommend 2-3x the amount of OJ and milk that the recipe requires, otherwise it is just way too thick. I am going to melt the coconut oil next time as another reviewer mentioned. Adding avocado is also interesting.

I really liked this! It's a shame there's so many bad reviews :( I froze my banana and kale. My kale was fresh from the garden though. I included the flax see meal (found in bulk section at WinCo) and the coconut oil (found in health food section of Fred Meyers). I melted the coconut oil so it would blend better with the other ingredients. I also used nonfat milk and Simply Orange 100% orange juice. I just went out and picked a whole bunch more kale to freeze so I can have this more often!

I'm not sure how someone can give a recipe a bad review when they substituted 2 out of only 6 ingredients...at that point it's not the same recipe! I made this smoothie with the listed ingredients and it was delicious; didn't taste green at all! I'm going to try adding crushed pineapple and a bit of pineapple juice next time and see how that turns out.

I make a similar version of this every morning.  I use frozen banana and 1/4 or 1/2 avacado either fresh or frozen and almond milk instead of orange juice.  My husband even likes it and he is picky.

Midwife is making me consume more greens, so I tried this. Gotta say, can't taste the kale. Yum. Though, the kale was quite chunky. I don't know if that is because my blender sucks or that's just the way it is.

I just made this.  I didn't add the coconut oil because I don't have it.  I used 2 teaspoons of flax seed meal.   I used 1/2 cup of almond milk instead and added 3 ice cubs.  Delicious.  I have a VitaMix and this blended perfectly.  I will definitely make this again.  It's very refreshing.

Maybe the coconut oil has something to do with the taste. I left that out (bad idea) and I used spinach, which I thought would be easier to cover up. It tasted like lightly sweetened liquid spinach.

Fantastic! The only changes I made: home squeezed orange juice instead of store bought, and almond milk instead of regular. I also didn't have flex seeds to add in. It turned out delicious, I will be adding it to my usual breakfast rotation.

My first green smoothie ever and I love it! I made mine with spinach instead of kale and my banana wasn't frozen.  I added ice cubes at the end to chill it more and thicken it a bit. I will definitely be getting all my daily fruits and veggies from now on! (Oops! I just now reread the recipe, and somehow, I also added a 6 oz. carton of vanilla yogurt.  Must have gotten it mixed up with another recipe on here)

This is flat-out the best way to eat fresh kale!  I also like this with spinach and kale combined.  I agree with other reviewers who said that you need to double the milk and/or juice to make it drinkable (and blendable).

this is great, I used my immersion blender to process it all.  I used coconut milk and chia seeds since I had some on hand.  Very tasty and I feel good starting my day with this.

I like this recipe, it gave me the chance to try out my new ninja. Once good feature is that it comes with the 16oz single serve cups so I can make a small version of this. I normally use a small handful of kale, 1/4 tsp flaxseed, handful of frozen blueberries( or strawberries) , 1/2 banana( frozen and really ripe)  1/4 cup of vanilla almond or soy milk and 3-4 cubes of ice. It comes out like a creamy thick shake and you cannot taste the kale. If you prefer it thinner just add a little more of the almond milk. Add a little maple syrup or agave if you like it sweeter.

This is wonderful.  I am trying to improve my health and this is delicious way to get my greens.  I did not have kale , so I substituted fresh baby spinach, omitted the coconut oil (did not have any) and used soy milk because I needed it to be dairy free ( I have asthma).

Typically, for the sake of my health, I manage to choke some things down that I don't really care for as long as they're healthy. (And I don't have a picky palate.) I did not care for this. I had skipped the flax and oil... tried to add some honey then some vanilla protein powder and I just couldn't do it to myself. Bummer.

Kale in smoothies - AMAZING!  My favorite combo so far is kale, strawberry, banana and coconut milk.  I look forward to trying it with other berries and avocado. 
I've tried it with spinach too but I like the flavor of the kale better.

Delicious.  Can't taste the kale flavor at all!  Only change I made was to freeze the kale, too.  Have also made it with coconut milk instead of milk and it's yummy that way, too.

I used green leaf lettuce (frozen) instead of kale and I omitted the flax seed meal. This blended beautifully even with a very old blender. Very delicious tasting with a hint of tropical (coconut oil). Coconut oil is famed for promoting energy and a healthy metabolism.

With the original recipe, the kale was too overpowering. Adding an extra banana balances it out, although you'll still taste the kale.

I Have juiced kale with other fruit and veggies, the kale is strong.  Tried this with variation, with what I had, changed the OJ to fresh juiced apples.  Also juiced 1/2 beet, because it was there.  Everything else the same.  It was wonderful, very sweet, no kale bitterness.  Perhaps because the kale was not juiced, and only chopped very fine from the blender, it did not release the bitterness.

I rate this between a 4-5. Like the submitter said, you can play with the ingredients. I added everything, but subbed water for the milk. I didn't have orange juice, so I drained one of those pre-packaged mandarine orange cups and found it to be exactly 1/3 of a cup. So, it worked perfectly. I added the optional flax, but left out the optional coconut oil. I never heard of oil in a smoothie. I think, it would make it a little  greasy and, to top, up the calories 120. I re-calculated the calories written, as is, as they seemed off. They came to approximately 142, leaving out the 120 calorie optional coconut oil, not the 397 as suggested. I ended up adding 1/2 cup of frozen grapes and 2 ice cubes, to make it colder and even sweeter. ty

Chia seeds are more nutritious and easier to digest than flaxseed. I would switch it out every time.

My family and I have been on a smoothie kick lately and this fit right in. I thought mixing orange juice and milk would be a little odd but tried it anyway. Pretty good!! 

The next time we made this I dumped the milk (sorry) and added strawberry yogurt instead. I didn't use coconut oil or flax seed meal and I added frozen strawberries and blueberries too.

Great recipe though!! We had a lot of fun coming up with other ways to incorporate Kale into our morning smoothie!!

I don't have coconut oil but I'm wondering what it does for this smoothie, so I'm going to buy some & try again.  I added some pina colada juice & assorted frozen berries, some apple juice and it  turned out purplish colored.  Tastes much better blended with ice.

Phenomenal! At first, I was wary of eating kale in a smoothie, since I work at a gym whose veggie boosts in their shakes leave a distinct taste. This, though, tastes great! I had to improvise because I didn't have all the ingredients, so it ended up being kale, about a cup of frozen peaches, about a cup of milk, 2/3 of a banana, and a scoop of protein powder. Delicious! Even my husband liked i, and in our house he's the picky one.

Used Almond Milk, no coconut oil, and 1 T wheat germ. Next time I'll try with Almond Coconut flavored milk.

I didn't have bananas so I used pineapple - delicious! I tried it with the banana another time, but I like it much better with the pineapple, which goes great with the coconut flavor. I have made this several times now. Also, freeze the kale as recommended by another viewer - great idea!

Instead of coconut oil and OJ, try coconut water (lots of different flavors or plain coconut water).  Frozen kale works better than fresh.

Excellent with the following changes. (What I had on hand.) Used spinach instead of kale and omitted the coconut oil. Also added a little vanilla yogurt and blackberries. Used a pomegranate/blueberry juice instead of OJ. And used almond milk instead of cows milk. Also upped the flax to two tablespoons. EXCELLENT! Can't even taste the flax or spinach. Also, added ice cubes because my bananas were not frozen. Very refreshing! Will be making again with the alterations.

I changed a few things, like omitting the coconut oil and orange juice. Instead I just used the juice from canned pineapples I was already opening. I also cut the recipe to lower calories and make it more of a snack and less of a meal. It worked wonderfully, with a pinch of squeezed lemon it's delicious.

Not bad for kale. Still tastes a bit green. I added extra OJ + ice and re-blended to cut the taste a bit. Wouldn't be a regular thing for me, but ok.

This is the first green smoothie that I've really liked! I made a several changes: 1) I did not freeze the banana, 2) I put a whole, peeled orange in instead of orange juice, 3) 1 put about 1 TBSP fresh ginger, 4) instead of coconut oil, I added about 1 TBSP of Earth Balance Coconut Spread, which added a little salty and buttery flavor that's really nice.

I made this way: 2 cups kale, 1 cup frozen berries, 1 tbsp flax meal, 1 tbsp wheat germ, 1/4 cup milk, 3/4 cup orange juice. Pretty good, but I personally prefer eat kale with meal not in smoothie.

Loved it!!! Used mango juice instead of Orange, soy milk.  Had to double those.  Used shredded coconut instead of coconut oil.  Wanted something green with what I had on hand, sure glad I found this recipe as a start.  Best green smoothie ever!

Excellent and healthy. Use half an orange instead of orange juice if you want. You can play with the combinations of flavors and additions: flax, blueberries, chia seeds, etc.

I was looking for a new healthy breakfast drink and this actually surprised me.  It was really good.  I might even add some kiwi or pear in addition next time.  Thanks for sharing!  I had never even tried Kale before.

First of all I have to ask this question: why would anyone rate this 5 stars and then proceed to tell us in their review of how they completely changed the recipe so it doesn't even resemble anything like the original?  The purpose of a review is to rate this recipe, and this recipe is awful!  I made it exactly as written and, as some reviewers stated, it was very thick but I found the kale flavor to be over powering! So, I added the suggested extra OJ & milk. Although it was thinner it still tasted like kale. That's when I started adding things to make it tolerable enough to drink because I hate to waste food! I added another banana, more milk & OJ, and some Pineapple until my family and I decided it was drinkable. After all that we finally got it down! Thanks but no thanks!

I thought this was a great base for a healthy smoothie. I added some frozen berries for color and sweetness and used almond milk instead of regular. I think this is a great way to incorporate more raw greens into my diet. As other reviewers mentioned, I needed to use more milk to make it blend easier.

I love this smoothie.  I've tried it with and without the coconut oil.  I don't notice a big difference either way.  I don't freeze the banana; I think the cold milk makes it cold enough for me.   I don't add the orange juice, preferring to double the milk instead (we use almond milk).  I'm planning to try it with spinach, and I'm also going to try subbing Greek yogurt for part of the milk.  If you vary the green and the fruit, you could have many varieties of this smoothie, enough that breakfast never gets boring.

The coconut oil makes this recipe so do not leave it out! Coconut oil gives a rich wholesome taste. I switched out orange juice for pineapple juice because it's what I had on hand. Also, our bananas aren't frozen, so I used a fresh banana and added a handful of ice to make the smoothie cold. I would definitely make this delicious smoothie again.

omitted the coconut oil, and used a half peeled orange in lieu of the orange juice I also added an extra 1/4 milk at the end.   Still thick, but drinkable through a straw.   My kids loved it.   I have a ninja blender and the kale was still chewy, but no one minded.

This is really good. First time I tried it and I'm already pleased. I use fresh orange instead of orange juice, almond milk and a little vanilla flavored coffee creamer. Two thumbs up!

I added about 3 - 4 frozen strawberries (only because they were stuck to the frozen bananas!). I LOVED IT! I can't wait to make it again tomorrow. I also used fresh kale from my garden - my first time growing it. #stillsmiling

This was pretty good..you can't even taste the kale! This is a good base for a smoothie, so I gave it 5 stars, but you can add any fruits you have on hand to change it up and it will still taste great. I do recommend freezing your fresh fruits (and even the kale) for your smoothies to avoid using ice..which will just water it down. Although I did not have frozen bananas this time around, I used a room temp. one, frozen blueberries, chilled pineapple, kale, o.j., milk, flax seed, & coconut oil. It was yummy! Even my toddler likes it. I plan on continuing to use this base and making variations.

This tastes great if made according to directions and I don't think I would substitute other greens unless you love their taste. If you don't have a vitamix, it will be pretty thick so if you want a thinner drink, I'd add more milk and juice. I used almond milk and it was great.

I was a little scared to try it but it tasted really good.  I didn't use the coconut oil, and I didn't have orange juice so I used 1/2 can of peach-mango V8 fusion.

I made my first smoothie today using this recipe. It's very delicious  and had a somewhat 
earthy" scent like fresh grass! Not offensive, just different. I added spinach,ice and a little extra OJ and it was still yummy! You may want to add a little extra fluid to your recipe to thin it out. Definitely a do over!

(FYI if you have never had coconut oil, think of a liquid macaroon without all the sugar!)

You can barely taste the kale in this recipe. I added ice to mine to make it colder. My 3 year old had a big glass of it which is saying something.

I followed this recipe to a 'T' and I generally LOVE smoothies, especially those with fruit/veggies, but this one really did not do it for me.  I made it initially for my picky 2-year-old, but when he protested I couldn't even argue, as I did not care for it much myself.  Will consider trying again with a different fruit combo, but, as is, not all that!

I cannot stop eating these! I don't have a very high-tech blender, so mine is a bit 'chunky.' But still delicious!

i love my smoothies and found out about putting kale in them. so i tried this. i didn't quite have 2 cups of kale so used less. my favorite smoothie is banana and OJ frozen concentrate, then plain yogurt and a little milk. here it is with kale! was wonderful. i use the OJ concentrate straight out of the can instead of juice and use less. and, never thought of freezing kale!!! thanks to the reviewer who said that.

Not sure if I qualify to rate this, since I changed the recipe...  I was really doubtful that greens could actually be worked into a smoothie with tolerable results.  I used a past prime peach w/skin, mango, frozen banana, 2 cups chopped kale and enough OJ to make it all blend.  I think it's delicious.  And I think nearly any fruit combo would work.  I'm now a believer in green smoothies.  :)

I added a splash extra OJ, a little agave nectar, and about 1/4 cup frozen raspberries, 'cause the first time around was kinda yucky.  After I added those my 7 yr old daughter drank it happily - it also helps to put it in a tupperware sippee cup with a lid, so the green color is concealed from kids.
