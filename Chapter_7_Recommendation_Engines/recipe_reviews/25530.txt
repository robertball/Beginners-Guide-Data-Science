Pretty easy to make, and tasted great right out of the oven. But if you are making it for a long evening party....it doesnt stand too well. Overall, if you put it out right when it was cooked it will be eaten quickly....but if you dont, it might barely get touched.

This is the BEST! We love it! I have 3 teenage sons and when I make this, I turn my back and it is GONE. It is so good  on bagel chips, triscuits or sour dough pieces. I think those boys even use a plain ol' spoon! Very rich flavor but oh so good. If you watching fat grams, I think you could use low fat mayo and cheese at it would still taste great.

I have made this a number of times and every time I get very high compliments. I don't change a thing, but it can be a very heavy/rich for those watching their fat intake. Excellent though!

Sorry, but I didn't have good results with this recipe. It was *extremely* greasy. I blotted the top with folded paper towels and finally gave up after completely soaking THREE paper towels. I made it again and basically redid the entire recipe to much better results.. omitted the mayo, added a drained 10 oz package spinach, 4 oz cream cheese, 3/4 cup sour cream, half a jar of alfredo sauce, 1 clove garlic and about 2-3 tsp. hot sauce (added flavor but not much heat). I also changed the cheese from mozzarella to monterey jack.

I discovered this recipe here this afternoon and made it for a Christmas party this evening.  We especially enjoyed the addition of chile peppers.  (A nice variation from the standard mayo/parm cheese/artichoke recipe).  It was a big hit and a winner!

Everyone loves about it and then asks for the recipe.  Even my husband, who doesn't like artichokes, likes it.

I used fresh Artichokes, just boiled and chopped them. I also used the marinated artichokes and left out the peppers. I added 1teaspoon of minced garlic and ground pepper. The recipe suggests to cook for 30 minutes and mine was brown and basically like burnt cheese. I recomend only baking for 15 minutes. It was hard to "dip" but still tasted good. Just not what I expected

This dip was really good. I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I improvised a bit. Instead of the green chiles, I chopped up roasted red peppers, shredded white cheddar instead of mozzarella, and light mayo instead of regular. I also added a dash of black pepper and garlic powder. Yummy!

This is the most awesome dip! Yes, it's a little greasy, but it is wonderful. It's also just as good heated up the next day. I have made this many times for parties. My friends always request it.

This is a delicious  five-star as written and about a 10 with my additions!  I add a couple cloves of garlic (roasted is even better if I have time) AND (now don't turn your nose up!  Keep an open mind), about a teaspoon of anchovy paste.  It's the secret ingredient.  Don't tell your anchovy-hating friends, they won't know what that it's in there - they'll just know there's something wonderful about it.  Also - you can spread some of this dip on top of pizza dough and bake.  WOW!
