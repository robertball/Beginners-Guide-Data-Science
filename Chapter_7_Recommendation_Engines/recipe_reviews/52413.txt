Quite simply the best Spam sandwich I've ever had!  During my tour in 'nam Spam was like acid to soldiers on the front line.  When mom sent a can of Spam over for one of the boys, we were on that thing quicker than he could crack the can.  And when he did...that block of ham lying there cooking in its own juices like a ceviche in hell.  Anyways, just lifting back the top to another glorious chunk of Spam was just spectacular for me.  I did cry for three hours thinking about the good old days, but that's neither here nor there.  Signing off, General Jaybirds

I made my own barbeque sauce, shredded Spam, added shredded cheddar and mozarella, and then topped the mixture on large dinner rolls (cut in half).  I topped each with french fried onion rings (canned) and baked.  They were delicious and won a Spam contest I entered!

This was my first time eating spam. I didn't care for it, only 1 person out of 5 did. However, he ate 3 sandwiches, and said they were the best he had ever tasted!

Best Sandwich EVER!!  all we added was some nice Walla Walla Sweet Onion slices. Growing up an AF brat we lived for the days my Dad made Spam for us. It was hard for him but we loved it so much now Spam is a happy memory for him and his grandchildren. Thanks to the General and all our vets for making life free because they are THE BRAVE!!!

Upon seeing some of the positive reviews, I passed this recipe onto my mom to make for my dad - who loves spam.  My mom said the BBQ sauce was a little excessive - possibly 1c would do, and although the taste was a little unusual - overall was good.

I am NOT a Spam lover, but my DH is.  I was trying to think of a way to use some Spam I found in the cabinet and came across this recipe. I made it exactly as directed and he loved it!

What's not to love, it's Spam and BBQ sauce! LOL, I added cheese, sliced onion and chopped jalapenos. BTW, the Spam was jalapeno flavored too! We like the meat a bit thicker so I slice the whole can into 3rds. Spam is a fickle beast, you either Detest it or can't get enough, I am Happy, we ( well, 1/2 the family) are in the latter camp. My younger kids don't like Spam so they get whatever else I can scrounge up! Thank You DG!! Keeper:):)Sorry it took SO long to give it a Face!
