If I hadn't added about a cup or so of milk, this tuna casserole would have been really dry. I sauteed half of an onion, a couple LARGE handfuls of matchstick carrots and garlic in EVOO and butter and added it to the casserole. I also made my own croutons. Good, but again you need to add milk or it's dry. As I made it, there were no leftovers. I'll make this one again.

I changed so much that I probably shouldn't rate this recipe, but it was delicious so I had to. I have made tuna casserole once before from a different recipe, but didn't care for it. When I saw this one, it seemed more suited to my tastes. I used twice as much macaroni, same amount of tuna and cream of mushroom soup, 3/4 lb. Velveeta instead of cheddar put directly into the mixture and topped it with shredded cheddar then put crushed Ritz crackers in butter on top. It was rich and fattening, but so very good. Unlike the recipe I used before, the tuna did not overpower everything else. I loved it and am looking forward to leftovers tonight!

This recipe turned out well with a couple of additions... I added about a 1/4 cup chives chopped finely, a small container sour cream, and two cloves crushed garlic. I mixed those with the cream of mushroom soup. I also added some frozen peas, carrots, and corn. That gave it some nice colors. We really liked the cheesiness and the crunch from the croutons. Thanks for a good recipe idea!

I am a beginner cook, and was THRILLED with this recipe! Not only was it simple to make, everyone I shared it with had seconds, thirds, FOURTHS!! I changed a few things though. I only used half the amt. of cheese that the original called for and I used cream of chicken soup (added half a can of milk), and a can of french fried onions for the topping.

Even though I am a cheese lover, this casserole has too much of it. I could have just eaten a block of cheese! Next time I would cut the amount of cheese in half, grate it instead of cubing, and bake it in a 8x8 dish. 9x13 is too big.

Loved this!  Threw it together while my daughter was at piano lessons, and it was done when she got home.  I added about 1/2-1 teaspoon curry powder and 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder to the tuna mixture, but also cut the shredded cheese in half(8 oz total).  Will make this again!

This was a descent recipe. I had to increase the amount of macaroni, It did not seem like enough. I cut the cheese in half and used french fried onions instead of croutons.

This is a great recipes that is very filling.  I love cheese so I left in the one pound but have found it easier to work with when it is shredded (more convienent to as you can buy cheese already shredded).  I also tend to cut back a bit on the croutons on the top as they add quite a bit of salt (and salty taste) to the recipe.  I don't make it a lot because it is rather fattening but when I do my husband goes nuts!

like other reviewers, I reduced the cheese to one cup, and I also used crumbled ritz crackers, rather than crutons.  Overall, it tastes good and is very easy to make.

I had always resisted making tuna casserole, I didn't want to be so suburban! But one night all I had for protein in the house was tuna, so I gave this a try, and I am so glad I did! Very good, not too fishy! I did cut the cheese in half, which still made a wonderful cheesy dish! This will be a standard in our home from now on.

I'm going to give this 5 stars. This to me was delicious. I followed directions to a T. My husband said that he would add peas to it, I will probably do that next time. But it was really delicious.

This was very good but I also changed it up a bit. I usually try to stick to the recipe but this one seemed like it needed to be changed slightly to fit our tastes. I used 2 cups of macaroni and a cup of milk (having read that as a suggestion) and I used extra crutons. Turned out really good. For the leftovers I added some real bacon bits and it was tasty too. Will make this again.

This was fantastic!  I used a little less cheese, added some milk, black pepper and peas, and used Ritz crackers on top.  My whole family devoured it and that includes 4 year old twins.  Great, easy meal!

I don't typically make casseroles and decided to do this because I needed something quick (and  nutricious) for my boys.  Very nice dish- creamy, mellow , comforting.

I substituted one can of tuna for a can of condensed clam soup and added one cooked bag of frozen broccoli.  I used 1/2 the amount of cheese.  Better than take out!

This recipe was very simple.. I usually don't follow recipes, but always like to add additional ingredients to spice it up.   This recipe, I already had leftovers from last night.. Mac N cheese..   To this recipe, I kept 1 can of tuna, 1 can of mushroom soup and the mac n cheese.   I did add 1 small can diced green chilis, 1 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1 tsp pepper, instead of the cheddar cheese, I used parmesan and mozerella... Since the mac n cheese already had the artificial cheddar packet loaded with sodium..  This tasted delicious.   Open up your palettes and don't stick with norm....

This recipe was OK. It was a little too fishy.  The croutons were also a little overpowering.  Next time I will used crushed buttery crackers, or bread crumbs.  I would also stir in some vegetables, sauted chopped onions, and peas, etc. to give it more substance.  I might also add a little water or milk.  Will make again only with several modifications.

I pretty mcuh followed the concept of the recipe but did my own thing at the same time. First of all, I used egg noodles, I used one family size thing of mushroom soup. PEAS!!!! and french fried onions. And of course the tuna. I made the casserole early in the morning because I wouldnt have time in the evening. I topped it with loads of cheese, and put tin foil on top and cooked it for about 40mins. For the last 10minutes I put the french fried onions on top and no tin foil. Turned out great

This was not a very good tuna casserole. I have tried multiple recipes trying to find my favorite and this was one of the worst as far as the ingredients given. Yeah it may be cheesy but there is no FLAVOR whatsoever. I had to add a ton of salt & pepper to every plate to at least have something to taste. I did also add peas for nutrition. But I probably wouldnt make again

Soooo good!  Cheesy and creamy!  I put mozzarella and cheddar in b/c that's what I had.  I heated the soup 1/2 can of cream and the cheese before mixing everything together.  My daughter hates any bread crumb type thing on top so I used plain potato chips crushed up.  My picky 1, 3, and 5 year old girls loved it!

This was my first casserole like this .... and probably my last. Between the cheese, pasta, and soup I found it to be a very heavy recipe.

This was a pretty easy recipe. I followed Leahnwells advice since I had the ingredients on hand and had to use them up. I found it was a great way to sneak a little protein to my 2 yr. old, who only thought he was getting Mac N Cheese. It was not fishy at all and was a nice and quick meal.

Wow-interesting reviews on this recipe...it IS called "Cheese Lover's Tuna Casserole" for a reason!  We loved it...added 1/2 c. more pasta (to finish the box) and frozen peas (to sneak past my picky youngest!), but that was it.  Casserole came out cheesy & yummy...the crushed croutons were a big hit!

my family loved this. The tuna flavor was not overpowering just right. I added half a can of milk and only had 8oz of shredded sharp cheddar. I sauted half a small onion and 2 cloves of garlic in EVOO and butter. Used crushed townhouse crackers on top and sprayed top with i can't believe it's not butter spray. Surprised it was so good will def make again

DEFINITELY "Cheese Lover's", but my family is major cheese-a-holics, so this was a GREAT recipe.  I probably didn't use as much cheese, I kind of guessed at it.  I used grated cheese as well.  I actually made this ahead and froze it, it froze VERY well and was the best Tuna Casserole I've made.  A keeper for sure!

This was my first time ever making and having tuna casserole and this recipe was EXCELLENT. I invited two friends over to share it with me and they agreed. The only thing I did was add about 1/2 a cup of water to the soup mixture. I will definitely make this again.

I shouldn't be rating and review this recipe because I made several changes but without them it would have scored much lower. While I was mixing the ingredients together the mixture looked way too dry so I mixed in about 1/4-1/2 cup milk and about 1/2 cup of mayo. Used wide egg noodles instead of macaroni because that is what I'm used to. I cut the cheese back a smidgen added pepper, garlic and onion powder. Otherwise it would have been very bland. However now, its my new tuna casserole recipe.

I made a lot of changes to this recipe, but I think even without the alterations I made it would come out pretty tasty!

Like some other reviewers, I doubled the pasta. I shredded a 10-ounce block of mild cheddar (two pounds seemed like too much, but half that seemed like not enough!).

I also added about 2/3 cup of frozen peas, as well as some finely diced red/orange/yellow bell peppers I had left over from another recipe, for a little color.

Finally, I added some black pepper, garlic and onion powders, and a few shakes each of Old Bay seasoning and seasoned salt. I think adding these helped a lot. I whisked them together in the pan with the mushroom soup and 1/2 can of milk before adding everything else.

A little decadent, maybe, but this was a perfect, easy "comfort food" dish for a rainy day!

I made the following changes:  I put breadcrumbs instead of croutons on top.   I broiled it for a minute after baking for 15 minutes.  I put it in a 8x8 pan instead of 9x13.  My husband and I thought this was good, but I thought it could use some mushrooms, chives, or onions... maybe next time =)

You have to be a cheese lover or crazy to add a whole bag of cheese to a casserol!!! I used 2 cups of pasta and half the bag of cheese all together with this recipe and the cheese wedges I served with it. I only added the crushed croutons ontop to half of the pan but it was really good! A lot better than I tought it would. I would make my tuna casserole this was way again.

The only change I made in this recipe is that I whisked in one cup of mayo with the mushroom soup.  OMG it made it one of the creamiest tuna noodle casseroles I ahve ever had!!!  LOVED THIS!

This was a wonderful tuna casserole recipe. I used egg noodles instead of elbows and used about 12oz. cubed velveeta instead of the cheddar, because thats what I had on hand. I also added thawed frozen peas to the mix for added "veggies". All in all a nice change from traditional tuna casserole. I will definately make this again. Thanks!

Sorry to have the dissenting vote, but I absolutely did not like this.  It tasted like Tuna Helper.  I don't know how this got so many stars.  I'm giving up on tuna casseroles.

Yummy!!  You must be a cheese lover to love it though.  I used cheddar and mozzarela cheese, added green peas and some chopped onion and used french fried onions to top it off and it was fabulous. Definitely a keeper!

SUPER easy, and even our toddler loved it!  I used 2 cups shredded cheddar (8 oz instead of 12) and crumbled Ritz crackers on top.  Even with 2 cans of tuna, it's not overpowering.  Easily the best tuna casserole I've tasted!

This is a fantastic recipe. However, if you are not a fan of mushrooms, you can use condensed broccoli cheese soup as a substitute.

I will try this recipe again using some liquid either milk or water because mine came out too dry without using any.  The recipe calls for 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup but doesn't tell you to mix it as you would if you were making the soup.

I only loved this recipe because it's a good base and I got some great ideas and suggestions from the other reviewers. On its own, I felt it was a bit lacking. It was delicious! 

Changes: 2 cups instead of 1 for the elbow macaroni; 1 can of milk; dollops of sour cream (used up what was leftover from our tacos last night); pinch of curry powder; about 1/2 a finely chopped onion, 2 pressed garlic gloves, GRATED cheese instead of cubed and only a 300 gram package of it; 3/4 cup of homemade seasoned breadcrumbs. I would definitely add frozen peas to this next time. And I used the broiler after uncovering the dish for some final toasting/melting of the top. And I was super curious about the French fried onions suggestions. I had to google image it. I have never seen this in the supermarket! Is there a possibility that we don't have it in Canada? I just can't get my head around it - fried onions in a can!!

My husband and I really liked this dish, I will definitely make it again. I did add a little bit of milk and it came out creamy, I added frozen peas and carrots. I also only added half of the cheese and it was cheesy enough.

Hi. Thank you for this yummy recipe. It reminded me of what my dad would make for us when i was younger. My 6 year old son is a VERY PICKY eater and even he liked it alot. I grew up with sweet peas in my tuna casserole so I added one can to the mixture as well as 2 teaspoons of season salt & 1 teaspoon of black pepper just for added flavor. My only drawback was the oven temp of 350° did not seem to be hot enough. After 25 minutes of cooking it was just warm so I turned it up to 375° for 10 more minutes and it was awesome !!

We enjoyed the taste of this very much although I must say that 1 cup elbow macaroni did not quite seem enough. I cooked up a whole box of elbow macaroni and just spooned however much I thought is "enough" into the soup/cheese mixture. Also, I did not use up the entire 1 lb of cheese - just seemed a little too much... I mixed up 1/2 lb into the soup and scattered enough to cover the soup/cheese/pasta mixture. Also, I used roasted garlic bread crumbs instead of croutons just because that is what I have on hand. Easy dish to whip up and taste wonderful! Thank you!

This casserole was really good however, even though I followed the recipe exactly, my family all agreed that this recipe was definetly missing something.

Yummy!  My whole family loved this!  I added cream of chicken instead of mushroom and used both shreddeded cheddar and parm instead of the cubes.  I also used crushed ritz crackers over top instead of crutons.  It turned out very well, and the best part, it was easy! ;p

Let me first say that I really tweaked this recipe. I used 1 box of whole wheat pasta, 2 cans of fat free low sodium condensed cream of mushroom soup, 3 cans of tuna, block of cheddar, 4 oz of shredded cheese, 3 cups of brocolli-cauliflower-carrot blend veggies, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and garlic. I added the croutons at the end like the original recipe but I think they can definitely be left out. This is the seond time that I've ever had tuna casserole and I would 100% make it again.

My picky bf and I both liked this. I used cream of asparagus soup because that's what I had on hand. I used less cheese and added broccoli. This recipe is begging for an onion like some other reviewers suggested. It was not dry and did not require milk. The croutons were weird - not sure what the point was. I recommend excluding the croutons and adding veggies! Otherwise it's a good base recipe.

Delicious! I added some diced celery, a sprinkle of garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and used breadcrumbs instead of croutons. The bf sampled it and loved it (he hates mushrooms, as do I, but I didn't dare tell him what's in here! He won't even touch cream of mushroom soup, but I can make an exception) Thanks, Elke!

I didn't have any tuna on hand but I did have leftover fried chicken. Just removed chicken from the bone and followed the recipe and used panko instead of croutons. The kids enjoyed it and it was very good!!

Filling and fantastic! Delicious, simple to make and easy to clean up! I did use 1.5 cups of macaroni on the advice of a review, and I also used Kraft Tex-Mex shredded cheese which was awesome. Instead of croutons or crackers on top, I used crushed Harvest Cheddar Sun Chips (one 100 calorie package).

This gets a star knocked off for the measurements/ratio being waaay off. Am i reading this correctly just one cup, ONE CUP! of macaroni with 2 cans of tuna and an entire POUND of cheese?? I measured out my one cup of mac and stirred in the two cans of tuna and thought "Hmm, this cant be right." So i ended up having to boil more mac.  What a waste of time! But anyway, i really like the addition of the croutons. I lightly crushed mine. It was great. No way does this require a POUND of cheese. I eye balled that too. I served this with AR's Italian Peas. It went nicely together.

Very yummy.  I took the advise of Chef in SF and added sour cream and garlic but other than that I kept the recipe the same.  I love cheese so this was perfect.

This recipe was very quick and simple.  The first time I made it I decided 1 lb of cheese was way too much.  Second time, I doubled the noodles and cream of mushroom, cut the cheese in half, and topped with bread crumbs.  Yum! It was a hit.

I loved it; I usually pass tuna off as chicken in my family because kids AND husband "think" they don't like tuna but they almost always gobble it up and ask for more.  Today, they saw the tuna can...drat!  I used bread crumbs instead of croutons and I only used 1/2 cheese called for.  Yummy good, even if my family won't eat it!

Yippee! My three year old liked it.  We substitued crab for one can of tuna due to the fact we were horrified to discover we only had 1 on hand.  Very simple and kids can help put the cheese on.

This recipe is called CHEESE LOVERS.  You would not "cut back" on the cheese for this recipe if you LOVE cheese!  That is the point of the amount!  Loved it and so did my family!  Added a touch of cream to the canned soup.  Yum!  (Yes, I am a Wisconsinite!)

This is the best tuna casserole! This time I only used 1 can on albacore tuna (it tastes like chicken). I also added diced onion for a little bite. And substituted 1/2 lb of colby and 1/2 lb of pepper jack instead of cheddar. Was a big hit with work! Thanks again!

I decided to make this because my kids love croutons.  It was very dominant.  I used extra wide egg noodles and the full 1lb of cheese which worked out great.

Delicious!  So easy, and the kids loved it.  Okay, so they picked out the mushrooms from the cream of mushroom soup.  Anyone have an idea on something I could substitute for the cream of mushroom, but that would be just as good?  We'll be making this recipe a lot!

This recipe was fabulous!  I did change the noodles to egg noodles and increased the amount of noodles.  I also added 1/2 can of water as well.  This is definitely a family favorite now!!

Next time I make this, I will probably use less tuna.  I'm not much of a fish fan, but otherwise, it was really good and easy to make!

Okay, I resisted the urge to make changes and made it as written. Here's my opinion; waaay too much cheese, not enough macaroni, too dry and bland.  Add at least half of a can of milk, some sauteed onions, garlic powder, another cup or more of macaroni and cut the cheese! Sorry. ;-)

I have many versions of tuna casserole .  This was the best ever.  I did add a cup of milk and instead of one cup of macaroni,  I used two cups.  Came out perfect.  My husband had a second helping.

Follow recipe and it was very good. Fast and easy.  My daughter actually enjoyed it and her father ate all the seconds. So I will make again. Only thing I will do differently is add more soup and seasoning.

Very, very good with a few minor changes.  Unlike most here I used almost a whole pound of cheddar but added more elbows, 1/2 soup can of milk and instead of mushroom soup I used condensed cream of broccoli  and added 1/2 pkg dried onion-mushroom soup.  Also added parsley and some chives.
Could still taste the tuna but I love canned tuna and it definitely did not need any more salt.  I used a smaller dish and it needed at least 30-40 minutes in the oven to completely heat.
Next time I will try putting cheese over the crushed croutons.

The ratio of cheese to all the other ingredients is off. It's also very bland, although this may be good for those that are picky eaters.

I made this to try put something different and that can leave enough leftovers to eat during the wk as well as another way to use tuna. I didn't care for it and it was kinda dry. Won't be making this again..

This is a great dish and so easy to put together!  After reading some other reviews, I made sure to add a cup or so of milk, and it came out really creamy. I also tripled the amount of macaroni and used white cheddar.  Very good!

First of all I doubled the sauce and I used 1lb of macaroni. I used sharp yellow cheddar cubes and white Vermont cheddar for the top. Cook time increased to 35 minutes. It was excellent.

I made the recipe with all the ingredients except added 2 cups of macaroni, 3/4 of the cheese, and added 1 cup of milk.  The additional macaroni offset the 2 cans of tuna.  Also the milk added a better creamy flavor.  Next time I make this casserole I am going to add some onion and the full amount of cheese to hide the fishy flavor the tuna gives.  Overall, we enjoyed it.

It really is just a pool of cheese when it comes out of the oven. Tooo much cheese and not much else can be tasted. I would recommend a plate of cheese and crackers before I would recommend this recipe. It doesn't really fill a 9x13 baking dish.

One of the best dishes that I have made from this site. It will be one that I make frequently now. I like to cook something that I can eat for several days. Love it! I reduced the amount of cheese to about half and used bread crumbs because I didn't have any croutons. I read many reviews before making it because they are always very helpful.

I was low on cheese, so used some grated cheddar and some velveeta.  Turned out good.  My husband liked to better than the old fashioned with noodles and he likes that.  I'll  certainly will make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did make a few changes. I have a family of 5 so i made 12oz of noodles, and added a cup and a half of milk and a half cup of sour cream. I did use the whole lb of cheese but next time I'll use Velveeta to mix in and sharp cheddar on top. I also used french onions instead of croutons. This was an awesome recipe idea thank u

My husband loves tuna casserole.  He would have liked twice as much tuna, but I thought the amount in the recipe was enough.  I crushed the croutons to make the crust as suggested.

I had to triple the noodles..no way 1 cup is enough for 6 servings , added more soup(1 more can) and also added milk(2 soup cans full)..I used about 2 cups shredded sharp cheddar all mixed in the casserole..I also used french fried onions(small can) IN the casserole and italian style breadcrumbs mixed with melted butter for the top of the casserole. Even though I made changes this recipe still gave me great inspiration. I hadn't make a tuna casserole in a decade or MORE!

I can't figure out why every single tuna casserole recipe that I've seen in the last 20 or so years have canned soup in them.
I have a scratch recipe which is so much better than the current "quick" ones that use canned soup.   Just make a white sauce and melt a bunch of grated cheddar in it, stir in the tuna, then season it with salt and pepper.  Pour it over your cooked noodles in a deep oven proof dish.  Cover it with buttered bread crumbs.  Bake at 350 until bubbly and crumbs are browned.  WA LA!   It is so much better.

I made this last night. Very good and easy to make. I tweaked it a little. I used 1 1/2 C macaroni, a 12 oz can of tuna, 12 oz of shredded cheddar, and cream of mushroom with roasted garlic. I was unable to find seasoned breadcrumbs, so used the garlic mushroom soup to snazz it up. Turned out delicious, but next time will add a small can of peas.

Not bad, but really all I could taste was the cheese. Based on previous comments I used 8 oz of shredded cheddar and added about 1/4 cup milk to the mixture. I thought a 9x13 pan seemed a little large for the amount of food mixture, so baked it in an 8x8 pan and it seemed to fit well. If I make it again I think I'll used seasoned bread crumbs instead of croutons, and I'll add some veggies to tone down the cheese.

This is an awesome dish! I make it all the time (even before I found this recipe). It's simple & quick. I use a can of mushroom soup & a half can of milk and also add peas to it; however instead of using shredded cheese, after I put it in the pan, I add cheese slices to the top and warm it in the oven until the slices are fully melted. (Shredded cheese is good on it as well but I don't mix it in - just put it on top). As another user said, if you don't add milk, it ends up being super dry (I add milk & soup as needed to moisten it after the initial can of soup and half can of milk). Salt and pepper to taste before serving

I didn't use as much cheese as it called for and I think that made a difference. I added a bag of steamed broccoli and stead of croutons used whole wheat ritz crackers. Honestly, my daughter likes it better when I use a box of mac & cheese and add the tuna and brocooli to it.

I've never added cheese to a tuna casserole but thought it sounded like a great addition.  I used sea shell pasta, and added some sour cream, and a little milk to the soup as another reader suggested.  I always use a little milk.  The sour cream another reader suggested seemed like it would add another layer of flavor, and we like it.  I used reduced fat.  I only used about half of the sharp cheddar as 2 lbs seemed like it would overpower 2 cans of tuna.  I generally add a little onion powder and minced garlic to the sauce so I did.  I was disappointed that I didn't have but a handful of croutons.  Not sure how that happened as I usually have a couple bags on hand, so I used Italian style bread crumbs with some melted butter.  It was really wonderful!  I am rating the recipe as 4 stars as it seems like a good basic one, but I made some changes that impacted the flavor.

Since I do not like cheese and seafood, I used rotisserie chicken, chopped, instead.  I used two cans of cream of mushroom soup, 1 1/2 cups of reduced fat milk, 1 cup minced onions and some chopped fresh parsley.  Also, I used 1 pound of fettuccini pasta as I was out of elbow macaroni.  On top, I used buttered Panko breadcrumbs, seasoned with salt and pepper.  The casserole was ooey, gooey and cheesy, and my husband loved it. I served it with a tossed green salad and garlic bread.  Thanks  for the basic recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

Added some milk to the soup and also added frozen peas for a nice crunch.  Even my husband had seconds which he usually doesn't do with a tuna casserole.

This recipe is great but I added a few things. Half cup more macaroni & half cup of milk and some julienned carrots and small broccoli flowers. Also used shredded aged cheddar instead of cubed. Turned out excellent.

I rated this recipe based on the fact that I had to make some variations to it. I got ideas from other people commenting, and at the end, it ended up being a great dish. I sautéed chopped white onion and minced garlic in margarine and added it to the pasta and tuna(I used two cans of tuna). I also added two cans of mushroom soup and instead of putting cubed cheese in it I grated the cheddar cheese and did it au gratin. First time using ritz crakers(suggested by someone too)and my family loved it.

Both me and my boyfriend (he hates fish and mushrooms) loved this recipe! He took the left overs for his lunch the next day and said "it tastes like something my mom would make." I added in cauliflower, green onion, and celery. I will definitely be making this one again.

My husband really really liked this.  Other than substituting a different kind of pasta (I didn't have elbows) and using about 1 1/2 cups, I followed the recipe as described.  I thought that it needed a bit more flavor, so when I made this again, I will add sauted onion, some curry, perhaps some frozen peas.  I really liked the fact that it was very quick and very easy to do.

Left everything as if, except I only used one can of tuna because that's all I had. Still was delicious, could have used a bit of garlic powder or pepper.

Loved it! I hate to say that I too made some modifications to the recipe. I used 3 cups of egg noodles instead of elbow macaroni (for variety & more servings) and added melted butter to the croutons before spreading them on top of the casserole.  I baked for 20 mins in a 2 quart casserole dish at 350 and broiled for 1 min to brown the crouton topping. I was going to freeze the leftovers but my husband insisted it would disappear by tomorrow night's dinner. A definite addition to our family's favorite recipes!

Boyfriend loves this recipe. I cook it all the time but have to add salt, pepper, and a dash of whatever sounds good to me at the time. And I cook it about 10-15 minutes longer.

My family loved this recipe. It was our favorite of all the tuna casseroles that we have tried. I used shredded cheese in place of cubed. I also used angel hair pasta because that was what I had on hand. Delicious.

Loved it!  I substituted cream of potato soup for cream of mushroom, used less cheese, and took Chef in SF's suggestion to add sour cream, chives and garlic.  Delicious!

Found this casserole really good!  Kids loved it.  The only reason i did not give it a 5 was because i found it a little salty and that could of been my tuna.

Really mushy and cheesey, definitely needs more ingredients, mixed w/the side salad it was a lot yummier. However, my picky husband liked it, substituted ff shredded cheeze and some ff feta cheese crumbles as well as plain bread crumbs and he said it was good.

WOW!   EVERYONE, including finicky toddler, cleaned their plates for this one. DH even went for seconds.  I didn't even have all the cheese and croutons called for in the recipe, and it still turned out great.  THanks so much!

I added a handful of saltines to the croutons, a dash of curry powder and only used 1/2 lb of cheese.  We all loved it.  Will make again!

I needed a tuna casserole that my daughter who doesn't like fish would eat.
The cheese did it.
I did make some changes. I used whole grain egg noodles(12oz). I sauteed a small onion a couple cloves of garlic and fresh mushrooms. I cut the cheese in half and grated it. I used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of celery both low sodium. To keep it rich I used about a half a can of 2% canned milk. Topped it w/ bread crumbs w/butter and a little cheese. My daughter loved it. Maybe I shouldn't have rated it w/the changes but you can have fun w/this a basic start.

I did what Karen Turner suggested, adding the curry and the garlic powder and halfing the cheese.  It was awesome, even my 1 and 2 year olds liked it.  The only change I'm going to make next time is to use the 2% cheese to decrease the amount of fat.

This was really easy to make and my husband loved it.  I did however, change it just a bit.  I added some diced onion and 1 tsp. lemon pepper for extra flavor; reduced the cheese to 12 oz, which was plenty; and used cream of celery soup. My husband said it was great but could be a bit creamier, so next time, I might add 1 more can of soup, or maybe try adding 1/2 can of milk to the mixture.

Really good. I improved it a little though by adding about 1 cup of mayo, 1 small diced onion, and a few tsps of garlic powder. I just estimated the amount of cheese I wanted, but I'm pretty sure I didn't use as much as this recipe called for. Really yummy!!!

I really enjoy this recipe quite a bit, though I haven't tried varying it too much. Occasionally I might use egg noodles instead of macaroni, or cream of chicken or celery in place of the cream of mushroom. 

Though this is one of very few dishes that my fiance, who is a VERY non picky eater, just will not touch. It's too rich for him unfortunately. I've made it for other friends that absolutely loved it though.

I've eaten the tuna, mushroom soup, and macaroni combo numerous times and always enjoyed it.  This certainly bumped it up a notch.  I didn't have chedder, I had grated tex mex mix which I used instead.  Worked out great!  I also added a clove of garlic for fun.  Good idea to add cheese!  Thanks for the tip!!!

So yummy! It was very easy to make and didn't take long. I did use cream of celery in place of cream of mushroom soup, and bread crumbs as the topping because I was out of croutons.  I'll definitley make this again and again for my family!

My husband and I REALLY liked this.  Our kids enjoyed it, but it was a bit rich for them.  I used 2 cans of soup, added 2 tsp minced garlic, shredded the cheese - 2 c mixed in and 2 c on top, had no elbow macaroni so cooked about 8 oz of egg noodles but didn't use them all. I just put them in until I liked the consistency.  6 oz would be about right.  I used Ceasar croutons and slightly crushed them in my hand.  This is a keeper for me!

This was the first time I ever had or made tuna casserole and it was WONDERFUL!! I used solid white albacore and 2-3 cups shredded cheese and garlic & herb bread crumbs on top. Very easy weeknight dinner.

Pretty good.  I didn't use croutons because I didn't have any, but I used dried herb stuffing.  It was a nice change.
