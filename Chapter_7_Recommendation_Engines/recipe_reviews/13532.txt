I made this recipe instead of potatos for our holiday dinner and received great reviews for my work.  Very tasty and different.  Of note though, parsnips take a long time to soften.  Steaming them for up to 30 minutes doesn't work, they really need to be boiled, otherwise you'll end up with lumps of parsnips in your whipped carrots.

Very good. I think the it needs some more spices.  Maybe onions and garlic will be good.

A tremendous blending of flavors!  The consistency is of mashed potatoes.  Great stuff!

I love both parsnips and carrots and imagined this would be a delicious way to combine them. I followed the directions exactly, but when I tasted it, it was bland mush. I started doctoring, using some of the suggestions in other reviews (I added a little brown sugar, kosher salt, a little pepper, a dash of allspice, and some ground ginger). That improved the flavor but not enough, so I tried adding a little honey and more ginger, and it was still not good.

Not for us, but it looks like a lot of people like it.  Used extra seasoning, but still bland.

I've made this a few times, and I'm always pleasantly surprised by how nice this dish is. I've made this by just mashing the veggies, too, and as long as the veggies are cooked to -very- tender, it works quite well... as long as you don't mind a little bit of texture.

I had never had parsnips before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The dish was quite a bit sweeter than I expected.  It was really good, but not what I was expecting.  I think I may add onions and other spices next time.  My biggest complaint was the smell of the parsnips as they were cooking.

I have made this numerous times it reminds me of squash, never thought I would live to see the day I enjoyed eating cooked carrots or parsnips for that matter! I add butter, brown sugar, and nutmeg... OH MY!!!

I made this recipe then added a Boudin sausage without the casing and 2 heaping teaspoons of apple butter, mixed it all up, placed it in a Pam sprayed casserole dish, heated my oven to 375 degrees and baked it till it was hot and slightly browned. It was fabulous!
