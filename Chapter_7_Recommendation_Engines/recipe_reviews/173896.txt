After reading the review that this recipe was just ok and flavorless, I made a few amendments and turned out an awesome soup!
1) Time/Money Saver: I purchased six slices of thick, cooked bacon from our local grocery store which offers breakfast. Six slices cost $1.46. The quality was amazing, I didn't have to cook it and the cost was less than a pack. Awesome.
2)Flavor punches: Add a clove of garlic to 2T butter and saute. Then add the carrots and precooked bacon. Use chicken broth in place of the water. 
3) Topping: Add your favorite cheese (I used sharp cheddar)
4) Make it a meal: I served with a side salad, warm crusty bread and a glass of Pinot Gris so the sweet offset the salty.

Enjoy!
