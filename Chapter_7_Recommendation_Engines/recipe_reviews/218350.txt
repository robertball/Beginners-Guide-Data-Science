This is a simple and quick receipe. I usually use about 1/4 cup of mustard and 1/4 cup of ketchup. It gives it a thicker sauce. I sprinkle with brown sugar a teasppon of brown sugar, half a teaspoon on garlic powder and half a teasppon of salt and black pepper after it is done to give that final seasoning.

I cant believe these don't have more stars!  They were wonderful.  I cooked the wings in my fry daddy for 12 mins before I soaked them in the marinade for 10 mins.  Then I cooked them in the marinade for 10 mins at 425 degrees.  Very tastey!

This is a great marinade for an Asian flavor wing. The marinade penetrates within a few hours.  This flavor profile will not mix well when tossed in traditional buffalo wing sauce and bleu cheese after cooking, however.  I'd recommend a more asian dipping sauce.  We also placed the wings on a broiler pan @ 410 degrees to drain as we like our wings super crispy and this did the trick without frying.

Great recipe! I've made it two times now, substituted Madeira for the sherry the second time with equally good results. 

I just add the marinade and frozen wings to a big bowl, toss and then thaw the wings in the marinade in the fridge overnight. They came out perfectly juicy and flavourful both times. Officially making this my go to recipe for asian style marinated wings. Also love that all the ingredients are things I usually keep on hand.

I made about 40 or so wings with this recipe during the Patriots super bowl win. All my friends loved them. The party was about 9 people.

It was really good, but I didn't any cherry so I searched our liquor cabinet (lol) and substituted it with cognac!  It was really good. Then when I removed it from the oven, I placed the wings in a bowl, and poured the drippings through a sieve into a small sauce pan, brought this to a boil and added a mixture of water and cornstarch then poured it over the wings and gave it a gentle shake.

I halved the recipe and put this on two chicken breasts and put it on a sheet pan with veggies to make a great one dish dinner. Super delicious

Used apple juice and rice wine vinegar in place of the dry sherry.

I made this for a potluck. I marinated the chicken wings overnight in the refrigerator. The wings were a big hit. Simple recipe with great results!

I had my doubts about combining soy sauce and mustard, but this recipe was amazing. I did make some changes, though: whole grain mustard instead of yellow mustard, and rice wine (a sweet Japanese kind made with mochi rice), and about half the amount of sugar, but it came out great. I'm having a BBQ tomorrow, and can't wait to make this again!
