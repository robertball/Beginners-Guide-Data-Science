Excellent recipe!  To save a bit of time, I used 1/2 of a 10 ounce package of frozen spinach, thawed and wrung out dry using a dish towelinstead of sauteeing in the oil. I also prepared the Knorr's Bernaise sauce, using one third cup in the crab/spinach mixture and saving the rest to pour on the finished product.  Outstanding!!

We all really liked this for a special meal. I subbed several shakes of Old Bay seasoning instead of the fresh tarragon (personal preference). Used 1-1/2 super colossal shrimp per lg puff pastry triangle (main dish). Would've liked at least 50%-100% more crab in the filling. Squeeze-dry the lightly steamed spinach before filling.

Useing bechamel sauce is simmilar to well like a "chicken pot pie" I like the idea of the sauce outside of the dish. I didnt use the tarragon because I thought it took away the delicate flavor of the shrimp, what I did do was I made a Roasted Garlic Supreme Sauce to serve with the shrimp...just a little pool of sauce and sat the shrimp in the sauce.

This made a stunning appetizer for my dinner party.  I did take the suggestion of using frozen spinach instead. (thank you, no cleaning spinch before using!)I sauted the shallots to bring out their flavor.  Instead of serving them with more bechamel sauce, I used the Wine  Sauce found on this website.  I served one shrimp on each plate drizzled with the wine sauce and garnished with fresh parsley.  My guest were very impressed!

Made these tonight and they were very good! Also used frozen spinach and bearnaise sauce but wished I had used fresh spinach (I think they would have tasted even better). I cut down the fresh tarragon in half and it was not too strong. Will definitely make again.

I made it as per recipe and it was great. Next time I'll add more nutmeg to the bechamel sauce. And you really do have to make sure the spinach and crab meat are squeezed as dry as possible. The left over bechemel sauce goes really good with biscuits or chicken fried steak.

Pretty good appetizer dish for the family get together we had last night. I did fresh spinach instead of frozen like someone else did below and I do believe it made all the difference. Word of advice tho, make sure spinach and crab meat are squeezed as dry as you can get them. Other than that, this was a very good dish.

I was able to get jumbo shrimp or bechamel sauce (small town) so I substituted Alfredo sauce and regular shrimp and they still turned out great. Had a hard time with the pastry due to the warm weather here though so I may not thaw all the way next time. But overall a redo for sure =)

Mmmmvery tasty. Had to use flakey biscuit dough since couldn't find pastry dough. Recipe should include the bechamel sauce. I found a recipe with thyme, onion, salt, pepper, chicken broth that was good with this.
