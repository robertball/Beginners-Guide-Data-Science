THIS IS THE RECIPE TO USE!!  I used chopped green onion in place of the onion powder, and added a little extra seafood seasoning and worcestershire sauce, because my family favors those flavors - but SO yummy still just as written!

Super easy to make! And beyond delicious and this is a no-brainer but dont forget to bake the salmon before putting it in the dip =) goes great with french bread or any kind of crackers

One of the better smoked salmon spread recipes!  I, too, used green onion instead of onion powder, and added sour cream.  (I'm confused by the reviewer who says to bake the salmon, since smoked salmon is already cooked!)

Very nice and quick. I added 1/2 - 3/4 cup of sour cream as it seemed a little stiff for spreading.
