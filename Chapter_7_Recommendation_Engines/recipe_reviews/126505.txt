OH-MY-GOSH! Super yummy, very moist, and OH-My-Gosh Great!!  I made this for thanksgiving, and EVERYONE raved about it. It tasted Gourmet! I used a premade graham cracker crust, and only put it into the oven for about 8-10 minutes, until it set, and started browning & the blueberries bubbled. I didn't have lemon zest, but all in all, this recipe is a keeper! Can't wait to try it with other pie fillings! YUM!!!!
