One of the easiest and best soup's I've every made. Used the frozen Calif. mixed veggies but used fresh broccolil - about 4 big stalks cut into bite sized pieces. Only used 1/3 cup flour and stirred that into the 1/4 cup butter and stirred until it was a nice golden color. Used 2% milk. This time I used the real velveeta cheese next time I'll try it with the 2% velveeta and I really don't think it will change anything but the calorie count. Also put 4 chicken bouillion cubes and 2 beef boulilion cubes into the broth - think it give it a bit more depth of flavor. Being in Texas I had to add a few sprinkles of crushed red pepper flakes. Great on a cold winter night!

I have been making this recipe for about 10 years now and my family loves it. Sometimes I make it as the recipe says, but it is also great with a few extras. My husband finds it more filling when I add some diced potatoes, diced ham, and a can of whole kernel corn. Good stuff!!!

This soup is fabulous. My family and I loved it. I used skim milk in place of regular milk just to lighten it up a bit and still got a nice creamy soup. I served it with some nice warm crusty dinner rolls. So good. A definate keeper.

very good. loved it. quick and easy. i used a cup of chicken broth (its all i had left) and then made my own broth from water and ramen noodle seasoning to finish the other cup.. i know its ghetto, but its all i had to work with. i know that if next time i actually have enough broth, or if i use a little less seasoning from ramen, it will be better, cuz the flavor was a bit too strong. but that was all on me. it was my fault. otherwise, AWEsome!!

UPDATE:  I made this again, and made some additions and substitutions.. MMMmmMMm... yummy. not as thick as I normally like it, but deLICious flavor.. the first four ingredients I left alone. I had all of them. And since I didn't have Velveeta cheese (and it's processed. trying to be more healthy ;)) I changed the rest of the ingredients to my way of making cheese sauce without it. I used 4 tbs butter, 1/4 c flour, 1 cup milk, and 2 cups of regular shredded cheese. Also, when melting the butter, I added a little less than half an onion and 1 stalk of celery to saute in butter then did the rest as is.. still such an awesome recipe. I really love this stuff, and there's a few ways to do it without ALL the ingredients and its still similar to the original and SO SO mmm mmm good!! hehe.

This was extremely delicious and simple to make. I used a Mexican Cheese blend instead of Velveeta (which I didn't have on hand), and cut up some chicken breast to add to the soup. Very filling! My entire family raved about it.

Inexpensive, quick, and easy!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 for just my hubby and I to have with sandwiches...it was a perfect way to get some veggies!  I plan on using the leftovers tossed with pasta and chicken later this week for dinner :-)  Thanks!

Pretty good.  I wasn't sure why the roux was made separately then added in, so I just did the roux first then added in the milk, broth, and veggies.  My cheese, which was a nacho cheese instead of velveeta, was frozen as well, so I added that in a minute or two after adding the veggies.  I had to use a regular mixed veggie blend instead of the broccoli--we don't have broccoli in the house (freezer or otherwise) right now, but it worked well.  Just maybe made it less of a broccoli soup.  I halved the soup and it still made enough to go with our lunch today and for 2 lunches at work for the both of us this week.  I'm surprised there's no seasonings anywhere in this recipe; without the nacho cheese, I'd definitely be wanting to add some salt, pepper, and maybe some garlic and onion.  For all that, though, it's an easy, quick soup recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This soup is DELICIOUS! I made it last night for my husband and we both loved it! The only thing I changed was I didn't add the mixed vegetables, but I added about 2 lbs. of cut up russet potatoes. I did everything else as written. Thanks so much for this yummy recipe this will definitely be made again, and again! This is a keeper.

I have been looking for a recipe like this for quite some time and decided to try this one based on the reviews.  I substituted fresh broccoli and fresh carrots instead of frozen, added some chopped chicken breast and some rice.  It made the soup more hearty.  The only thing I would change next time is cut back on the cheese a little or substitute some of the velvetta for a smokey cheese.

I used this recipe as a guide and it turned out deliciously. I changed some ingredients, but followed the cooking directions. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I didn't have the California mixed veggies, so just used frozen cauliflower and frozen broccoli. I used cheddar cheese and seasoned with a minimal amount of salt and a few dashes of ground black pepper. I followed the directions for this recipe and it turned out great. I will definitely do this again, but will try using the California mixed veggies next time.

i was disappointed with this. i dont know what it was that i didnt like about it. i followed the directions. i used velvetta made with 2% milk. and slightly less vegetables that it called for, just because the bags i bought were 14 oz and 12 oz. but i wouldnt of thought that would make much of a difference.

I made this last night for a group of friends, and it was a total hit.  I followed the recipe almost to a tee, but added some dried onions, and some garlic powder.  Great, great soup.

This was so good! I sautéed half a diced onion in the butter. I had steamable California blend and broccoli, so I micro them for 5 minutes, then chopped them into smaller pieces. Add the broth, veggies into onion and butter. Simmered till tender. Added the milk and velveeta. I did cornstarch in water instead of flour. Cooked on slow till thickened. Yummy!!!

I used the shredded Velveeta in the refrigerated section of the grocery store; it melted smoothly.  This was a super fast, simple soup that I will make again!  If I have more time the next time I make it, I will add finely chopped onion with the frozen vegetables.

This recipe was awesome!  I substituted red potatoes for the cauliflower since my husband doesn't like cauliflower.  I used about 1 small bag of frozen carrots and 2 bags of frozen broccoli.  I cooked the red potatoes and carrots first to ensure that the potatoes would be soft and cooked all the way through before adding the cheese sauce.  Then after the potatoes softened, I added the broccoli.  I like to have some broccoli florets left in the soup and the longer you cook it the more it seems it dissolves so I added the broccoli last.  For those that had trouble with the sauce, the key is to add the milk slowly and stir it constantly.  I used 2% milk and shredded Velveta cheese.  It was really good and my family loved it!  Thanks for sharing!!

Turned out very, very good. However, 1/4 cup of butter wasn't enough to stir 1/2 cup flour until creamy. I wound up with dry yellow chunks and had to add the milk and then stir until my arm almost fell off to get it thicken. Other than that, it was good.  I used fresh veggies because whenever I buy frozen broccoli and/or cauliflower, I always wind up getting all stalks (which I hate). I also added a tiny smidgen of salt, and a pinch of white pepper.

This was good and simple enough to make with whatever you happen to have on hand as I quickly learned. I always have broccoli and California style frozen veggies on hand......except for today. I was already knee deep before I realized I didn't have the right veggies but I did have a frozen snap pea stir fry veggie on hand so thats what I used. Its real quick to throw together plus ultra filling since its so very rich! Thanks for the simple tasty submission!

This is really good and simple. I made broccoli cheese soup and just cooked 2 lbs broccoli in the chicken stock, then mushed it up with a potato masher. I had major trouble with the butter flour mixture. It made a huge clumper and took forever to smooth out, so next time I will use equal parts butter and flour. Great easy recipe!

I don't know what I did wrong in the cooking process. 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup flour was like crumbs and strange to "cook". Then I added the 2 cups of milk and it never became smooth, just very very thick. I tossed in the cheese chunks and tried to stir but couldn't so I gave up and stirred the milk mess into the vegetables and broth that had cooked up very nicely. I stirred a bunch and the cheese mostly melted and the soup thickened up and we ate. WOW, delicious! Very rich. My husband went back for seconds. The cheese sauce sure didn't go together like I thought it would though.

I have made this on many occasion.  It's an easy recipe to follow and using Velveeta makes it much creamier than using cheddar.

we loved it! Even my very non-vegetarian husband liked it.  The only thing I changed was using vegetable broth instead of chicken because I'm a vegetarian.  This will be a favorite in our house for a while.

This is the definitive broccoli soup recipe.  Other than using fresh vegetables (because they were on sale) and pureeing the soup at the end (because I have a 1 and 3 year old), I followed this recipe to a tee. I felt like I was in the Prego commercial when cooking this- I wanted to add spices but could not think of anything as it was perfect as is. My kids loved this. Thanks for sharing Bryanne, this is a keeper!

Soup was really good-but tasted a little floury--next time I'll be sure to use Wondra instead of regular flour.

A) USED Veg stock instead of chicken.  B)
CHOPPED in extra: two celery stalks, a few baby carrots; plus an additional 1/2 bag of Broc florets.  C) ADDED -(2 oz) of cream cheese and - (4 oz) of shredded cheddar  to dumb down the processed Velveeta taste and cuz this is WISCONSIN!)  D)  ADDED lots of extra pepper, garlic & onion powder .  
Simply amazing!  Very versatile recipe... thanks!

I choose to purée the vegetables- that way everyone in my family would eat it! ( I might not have been completely honest about ingredients when asked!) I also used sharp cheddar cheese - tastes great! One of the few soups that all enjoy!

This soup is SOOOO GOOOOOD!!!! It was fast and easy, I made it on a night that I did not feel like cooking at all...but this was a breeze!  I had a 32oz bag of mixed veggies ("Green Giant broccoli, cauliflower and baby carrots...not frozen) that I HAD to use. So I used them and instead of Velveeta (I try not to use it because its not real cheese) I used a 16oz bag of Mexican blend shredded cheese (and a little extra sharp cheddar, like 3oz.) Otherwise I followed the recipe the way it is written and it was SO YUMMY! I will be taking leftovers to work for lunch tomorrow! I will be making this very often! Thank you!

I followed the basic recipe because I needed a place to start, I didn't make it exactly the same because I only had fresh veggies to work with.   Milk,onion, garlic, half a head of cauliflower and a few heads of broccoli, broth, cheese and flour I mashed the veggies with a potato masher though I didn't add the butter. I also added some seasonings like cayenne and thyme. Not bad, I don't think I would have liked it much exactly as described. Thanks for a good starting point. Guess I should enter my own version as a new recipe.

My family adores this tasty recipe. They ask for it all the time. The only modification I make is adding more frozen veggies. Hands downs one one of my top five recipes from this site.

I used all fresh vegetables, be sure you use sharp cheese or it's a little bland, otherwise fool proof and extremely easy to make.

I changed it up a bit. I used 1 can of vegetable broth, 1 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of flour, a few tablespoons of butter, just half of the 1 pound Velveeta cheese, 1 bag of frozen broccoli, and diced potatoes. I'm not sure what the original recipe taste like, but the vegetarian version is absolutely delicious! Will make again (:

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because mine just never thickened up much at all. I even tried adding another pound of velveeta, which made it more cheesy (YUM), but didn't help which the thickening. The only one in my family who didn't enjoy this was my 10 year old, and that's just because he doesn't like cheese on his broccoli. I served it with Broccoli Cornbread.

I doctored this up a little bit. I added chopped celery and onions to it, and instead of flour used cream of chicken and cut the milk down to one cup. To thicken it I added a little cornstarch mixed with water. You can tell when it is thickening cause the spoon gets harder to stir. Put it in individual serving size containers and froze it. Now I can have a bowl whenever I want it. No more hoping Subway has it that day

My fiance loved it.  I used 2% Velveeta, but it still tasted pretty heavy of cheese.  Maybe use less Velveeta, or you could substitute velveeta for real cheese.  There are a ton of leftovers, so you can cut the recipe in half for a smaller family.

This soup was very tasty and easy to make!  l made a light version of this and it was delicious.  I used light butter, 1% milk, and 2% Velveeta.  I also used my immersion blender and made it a creamy broccoli and veggie soup!  Unfortunately, my 14 year old son didn't like it...you win some, you lose some!  I will have lunch to take to work this week!

I'm sorry, but this was just okay.  I really had high hopes for this soup because of the outstanding the ratings it has received so far, but it only tastes about as good as one could expect Velveeta and frozen veggies to taste.  This was a disappointing meal that I won't be making again.
