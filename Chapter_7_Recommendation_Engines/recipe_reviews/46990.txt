I don't care for lima beans, but my husband requested them as a side for dinner last night. I found this recipe, made it, and I am converted to a lima bean lover! I used regular lima beans (frozen) since that's what we had and I sauteed the onion in butter. I only simmered the beans for 15 minutes and they turned out so creamy on the inside and delicious. We'll be having this again soon!

These lima beans were outstanding. I did add pepper and garlic powder so a little seasoning. I usually boil mine in water, butter, and brown sugar. I thought I would try something different since I'm trying to cut out on sugars. We all loved this recipe SOOOO much! This will be the only way I make them from now on! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I didn't quite make this recipie as stated, but I am sure it would be great.  I didn't add any onion, as I didn't have any on hand.  But would also be great with onion.  I also added 1 tbsp of butter, just for butter's sake.  Next time I will make it without butter, for a lowfat dish. It did need a dash of salt and pepper for seasonigs.  I will make these nice, moist, flavorful beans again.

I am NOT a green vegetable fan, but my father in law loves limas.  So when he asked for them for his birthday dinner, I came right to this site.  And as usual, it didn't let me down!  This recipe was wonderful-- easy and very tasty.  I think I ate more than my FIL!  The only deviation I made was I sauteed the onion in bacon grease and added butter before serving.  No wonder I liked them!  Seriously, easy and good.

My son hates lima beans, but loved this recipe.  I used olive oil instead of cooking spray and also added 1 clove of garlic.

Really good, but the little onions weren't great while eating the beans.  I would suggesting keeping them in large chucks and then straining out before serving.

I love lima beans IF they are straight from the garden.  This is an easy, delicious way to prepare them.  I started the limas in the chicken broth while I cooked the onions to cut down on cooking time.

This is a great way to make limas tasty. I used a lot more onion which I sauteed in a little olive oil. My husband won't touch limas with a ten foot pole so more for me. I had a bowl of leftovers for my lunch and they were just as good as the night before at supper.

Fantastic Recipe! Neither my wife or I care for Lima beans, but these are amazing. After simmering for 30 minutes, mix 2 TBSP of corn starch with 2 TBSP water then add to beans. Turn heat to high and boil for about 3-4 minutes stirring occasionally until thickened.

This makes a fantastic gravy for your beans to swim in. The gravy kicks things up a level!

Very good as is ... even better if you cook 3 strips of bacon, remove the bacon then saute the onions in that.  Just before the beans are finished shake Tabasco Green (it's not hot just has a wonderful flavor) into the beans & mix well.  Crumble the bacon on top before serving.

I give these 5 just for reminding me 1) how good limas can be and 2) sometimes the simplest preparation really is the best. Yum! Thanks for the recipe

Great way to cook lima beans. We all liked them very much. I cooked mine in the crock pot all day. Turned out wonderful!!  I had a bag of dried baby limas that I cleaned and soaked over night. I added more chicken broth and only put 1/2 tablespoon of dried minced onion also a little sea salt. They smelt great all day and leftovers froze well.

I took the onions out before eating, personal preference. Also I added a bit of salt and pepper and some crispy bacon to top it off. YUM! Bacon makes everything better!!!

Wonderful. I used dry beans. I did the quick soak method to soak the beans and then I cooked them until they were soft with onion and garlic. once soft i added better than boulin and some pepper. and cooked them till they were thick enough to eat. If I cook a while bag of beans before I add the chicken stock I portion out the beans for the freezer and then cook what i want for that night with the seasoning.

I have been looking for a quick and easy lima bean recipe and am thrilled to say that this is the one!!!  
We love onions so I used a whole medium-sized onion and in addition to the cooking spray, I used a tablespoon of olive oil to saute the onions.  
The 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth was plenty and I did not have to add any water.  As other reviewers did, I added salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste.  Absolutely out of this world!!

LOVE IT!  Tweeked a little.  Sauted using olive oil.  Doubled the recipe, used very large Vidalia onion.  Used spike seasoning, salt, pepper.  Used electric skillet.  Used 3 cups water and 3 chicken boullon cubes. About tablespoon of butter.   No more water was needed.  Simmered in electric skillet until beans soft.  Resulted in some creamy sauce when done.  It turned out awesome!  Sweet, buttery, melt in your mouth beans.   WOW!

My husband said he really didn't like lima beans, now he does.  They are really high in potassium whech he needs.  I did add a can of Rotel tomatoes at the end after draining.  He ate them all up.

This is THE BEST lima bean recipe! I always have to double it or it will be gone in no time.  I ususally saute some turkey sausage, ham, or bacon first and use the leftover drippings to saute the onion. My boyfriend won't go for em without some type of meat in there. But I think they are fabulous by themselves. Even my picky 7 year old daughter loves them! Thank you!

I have never been a big fan of lima beans, but really like Glory brand...when I saw this recipe, I hoped it would be as good as Glory, but homemade and reasonably healthy. It is that and SOOOO GOOD! I really, really like this recipe and it will be mine from now on!

This was good, but not much different from the way I usually do lima beans.  I've never met a bean I didn't like!  I have to take issue with the reviewer who preached to southerners.  The reviewer painted with a very broad brush.  Yes, there is obesity among many southerners as with other parts of the country, but a very large number are fit and watch what they eat.  Some, unfortunately, cannot afford to eat healthy.

When I first found this recipe and read the reviews, I was really excited.  I thought maybe I had found an easy way to make lima beans taste the way I remembered them tasting when my mom made them.  After trying the recipe out, I was so disappointed.  These were so BLAND.  I even added some extra seasoning because of the reviews.  These need a lot of seasoning!!!!

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit.  I kept the onions big so I could pick them out and I added butter near the end of cooking.  I will definitely be making these again

This was the first year we tried growing lima beans in the garden. I love baby lima beans, but have always just cooked them from frozen, which is what this recipe called for, but I decided to try this with the fesh picked beans. Oh My Goodness. These were delicious, maybe the best I have ever had. I will definately do this again, either fresh or frozen.

After trying a few different lima bean recipes that my 5-year-old hated I tried this one. Finally, we have a winner! She told me to "always make lima beans this way because they're JUST right". Can't argue with that!

My husband asked for Lima Beans for Fathers day and I decided to try these and he loved them.  The first time I made them with chicken boullion which he much prefered over the canned chicken broth I used the second time.  I will make these again, with bouillon

Boy, this dish surprised me because I am not a lima bean eater (only like them in soups) but it really wasn't bad. I made them for my husband and he also liked them. They were very tender and tasted great.

Had to use up a bag of frozen limas, thought this sounds easy, threw it together and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. When I had hubby taste for salt before serving all he said was yum :).

As they are, they're a little bland. They are, however, nothing like the mealy, unpleasant limas I remember from my childhood, so that was a pleasant surprise. I took Pomona's suggestions and added some green Tabasco and a little crumbled bacon to the finished product. Then, this was terrific - even my three year old scarfed hers down!

Made this for the first time the other day and it was very tasty. I added a clove of garlic and used 1/2c of dried lima beans instead to the 1 1/2c. of chicken broth. I pressured cooked on high for 16 minutes.

I've always loved lima beans, but the way I grew up eating them was FAR from healthy. None of my cookbooks had any suggestions for me, so I came back to my trusty Allrecipes.com. Again, it hasn't let me down. This recipe is a keeper. Like some of the other reviewers, I also like to play around with some spices with this recipe. I've tried cayenne, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder so far. Yum yum! Can't wait to do some more experimenting.

Best and easiest lima bean receipe ever!!

I used a pat of real butter to saute onions and then added in my reduced sodium chix broth and limas. It was so yummy my husband has requested them again and again!!

I followed the recipe exactly except for using canola oil rather than cooking spray.  It turned out very good and as a non-lima fan, that is saying a lot.

I used College Inn Chicken Broth with Roasted Garlic and 2 tsp dried diced onion because I didn't have regular chix broth or fresh onion.  It really turned out delish!  Tasted rich, like there was butter in the mix, but without all the guilt.  I'll definitely spruce up frozen lima beans this way again!

Tasty & healthy dish, but I didn't like the onion texture in these, so I substitute 1/2 tsp of onion powder.  You also can substitute bouillon for the broth.  Salt to taste.

I usually don't cook limas at home because I know they will never be as good as those I used to get at the restaurant I worked at in high school, but this recipe comes close. First time I made it, I was too impatient and didn't let them simmer long enough. Though a little hard for my taste, they were still outstanding. When I let them cook the full time, they were to die for!

The original recipe seemed a little flat so I improvised. First I omitted the water, broth was more then enough liquid. I sauteed shallots & garlic in butter instead of cooking spray. Simmered the beans on low for about 30 minutes and took the lid partially off so the beans would absorb the remaining broth. Once the beans were cooked completely, I added more butter, Creole seasoning salt and pepper. DELISH!!!!

Straight forward and so very easy. The only reason it got a four from me is because I felt it needed some salt. Will definitley use this recipe every time I make lima beans now!

This recipe is really good.  I grew up eating lima beans and serve them to my family as well.  I have always lived in the South and have never added butter to lima beans as stated in other reviews.

This was okay. I added a little bit of garlic powder. The festive color and mild flavor made it a good pair with reubens. No "wow" factor, but easy enough to make again.

This recipes is delicious.  It makes the beans much more flavorful.  I also used the regular sized lima beans.  I also used a red onion and sauteed it in butter till the onion was slightly browned. Sprinkled some salt and pepper as well. Very easy and delicious recipe!

These didn't taste so good. Hubby ended up draining the broth and adding milk and butter. Tasted somewhat better.

I am not a fan of lima beans but the BF is. I used butter, red onion and only had canned beans...because he likes them. Because they were canned, I also used chicken bouillon and the broth they came in. I am still not a fan, but he was thrilled...guess I'll have to make these again.

Very, very good. I typically don't care much for lima beans, I think they're just so-so. My husband loves limas , though, so i make them for him.  This recipe makes them so creamy and flavorful that I want more,  and I'm making them now for a 2nd time.  I like to serve these beans with brown rice, about a 2- or 3-1 ratio with more beans  than rice.  Rice isnt much more than an accent, but helps to round out the meal.

I love this recipe! I used homemade chicken broth, which was already pretty seasoned. Sautéed onion and garlic in a little bit of butter. Added broth and a 16-oz bag of frozen baby limas. Simmered for 30 min. Seasoned to taste with Nature's  Seasons . Soooo good!!

This was soooo easy and they turned out sooooo good.  I added a little cornstarch and water as another poster suggested, and that added a little creamy goodness.  Butter, salt, and pepper at the end and you have an easy, inexpensive, and delicious side dish!

Cooking ANY frozen or canned vegetable in chicken broth or beef broth makes a tremendous difference, believe me!!  My neighbor across the street taught me this trick.  No water, just broth. And cooked this exactly as stated (had never thought of the onions!) and was so good!

My children have been begging for Lima beans (they had tried some before and loved them!). I thought this recipe sounded great and the reviews were pretty good too. I used the recipe plus some of the suggestions from others-bacon grease, fresh minced garlic, extra salt and pepper, butter. I still found this recipe to be bland and needing A LOT more flavor. 
Disappointed for the first time with an all recipe.

I used a bag of large lima beans (they started out white in color) and used a base of leftover onion soup instead of chicken broth. I threw them in the crockpot to cook all day, then towards the end added some leftover chopped up ham chunks I had on hand just for the sake of using them. Very nice flavor with the onion soup base!

Wow! My picky husband loved these! I altered it a bit. I used 16 oz. bag and when I cooked them added a tsp. of bacon grease w/ drippings. Since I used more beans I upped the butter to 2 Tbsp., the mustard to 1 1/4 tsp. and the lemon juice to 2 Tbsp. Left the sugar alone so it wasn't so sweet - may reduce this even more in future. Also added a dash of black pepper. DEFINITELY will be making this again!

I am relatively new to cooking.  I am not a fan of lima GREAT!!!  I have a picky four year old and he was eager to eat these beans.  Even my fiancee enjoyed the meal that I made with these lima beans.  He usually uses turkey to season his beans, but thought the chicken stock worked well.  A great veggie recipe that I will use again!

This recipe is pretty good.  As a poor college student, I added some smoked turkey slices to it at the end and made it a meal.

This was the first time I've made Lima Beans and I loved them. They had a mild flavor, which I like, and made a super healthy side (which I like even more). Just add some salt and pepper. Yum

These were great! Made them last night after I realized I didn't have any BBQ sauce to make lima beans the way I usually do. We were all pleasantly surprised at the outcome. However, I do need to mention that I used 2 tbs. onion powder and 1 tsp. minced garlic in them instead of chopped onion. Wonderful!

I can't say its bad but it is nothing spectacular.  I rather make Lima beans with canned tomatoes, in a more Greek manner.

Very good & easy recipe for lima beans. Took a little less time to cook than stated in recipe. Will definitely be making this again. Didn't give it five stars because I found it a bit flat tasting.

Pretty good. I have made these 3 times, two without onions. The broth gives it nice flavor and that is even better when it's reheated. I'm sure I will make these again. Limas are one of my favs.

These lima beans were the best I've ever made.  I used chicken stock to heat the limas and also added 1 Tbsp. of pan drippings from our turkey to add flavor.  I did not add onion to the beans, and did not need any salt or pepper.  The family loved the beans which made me really happy.

Excellent base start for lima beans-I only used 1/4 of a minced vidalia onion in 1 tble butter; but I added coarse salt and white pepper when I added the frozen limas. Very nice flavoring without having to always use garlic.

Tasty. I added about 1 tsp of butter and a little pepper. The beans come out plump and have a nice delicate flavor.

I got mixed reviews on these.  My mom loved them, but my husband didn't.  I forgot to let the broth come to a boil, so my beans ended up being a little mushy.  I also didn't use any spray or onion, as recommended by others here.  I would make them again, but let the broth boil first and not store the leftovers in the broth.

I really don't care for lima beans but was hoping this recipe would change my mind--it didn't.  :(  My kids, however, seemed to like them pretty well.  They ate these just about as well as the canned.  Since this is not something we all enjoy, I will probably stick with the canned.
