Actually I should have given them 5 stars but they were a little greasy. I think I've found my favorite chocolate chip recipe though!

A good recipe to try out for a slightly different chocolate chip cookie...the rice krispies gives it a nice little crunch! The combo of chocolate chips is nice too! I found I needed to add a bit more oats so they didn't spread too much...but otherwise I made it as written (which I encourage you to do too... then make modification if necessary!!). A tasty treat!

these are really good! i added 2 additional cups of oats and I also used half butter half shortining. These are one of our favorites and I love the honey flavor. The only problem with these cookies is that they tend to be very flat and are sometimes hard to get off of the cookie sheet.

Tasty! But turned out very thin and yet stayed chewy.
