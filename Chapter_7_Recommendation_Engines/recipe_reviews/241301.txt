I made half a batch of these using 4 eggs and a 12 cup mini muffin pan.  The amount of eggs was spot on.  I only used 1 slice of cheese finely diced and it was plenty.   A couple of tips - I filled the muffin cups to just about the top and they puffed up nicely without overflowing.  I would suggest removing them or at least loosening them up almost immediately after being removed from the oven.  I waited a bit too long (to take a picture) and they were starting to stick.  A plastic teaspoon lifted them out without scratching the pan.

These may have been quick and easy, but they were also bland. They looked lovely coming out of the oven, but I had one shortly later for breakfast and was not impressed. My 4yo was keen to try one since they looked so good, but she only took one bite and hasn't touched it since. If you plan on making these, I suggest you add a lot to it to make it taste as good as it looks.

This is very simple to make and has a pleasing appearance and texture. I suggest adding a tablespoon of snipped chives to the beaten eggs.

I have made this twice, the first time I made it with extra sharp cheddar cheese in lieu of Swiss, it was very good.  The next time I added wasabi powder in lieu of the onion powder, and it was great !

quick and easy, but it was challenging not spilling egg all over the muffin tin's very small cups. I used shredded cheese and basil.

I used the 4 eggs and added kale, pre-baked sweet potatoes, cherry tomatoes, and subbed crumbled cooked ground beef instead of ham. Tasty but sticky to pan. I tried to remove right out of oven. Failed. And they deflate right away.

I made it and even added a little Parmesan to the eggs, however Iâ€™m used to adding a little milk while beating the eggs. So the egg muffins puffed up in the oven and deflated when I took them out. So I will for sure make this again but without the milk. I did however put a little garlic butter on top after I took them out and it really enhanced the flavor!  Remake for sure!

I tried to make a half batch. Didn't have enough filling so I made more. They were a little bland. I might use a different cheese next time - gruyere, maybe. I also might use more seasoning. They were easy - I'll def make again, I'll just tweak a little to be more flavorful.

Made today for lunch and it was great! Between the salt and smoke of the ham and funk from the Swiss, not sure why some say it was bland. Will definitely make again and it's a great base for seasonal add-ins.

The only thing I would change is I would add salt, but I have already made these twice they are great for any meal and you can save them for a quick breakfast on the go!
