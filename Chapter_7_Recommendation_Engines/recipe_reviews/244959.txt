This was excellent! Since I only had vanilla protein powder, I added a few extra tsps of the cocoa powder (2 tsp would have been fine). can't go wrong with all of these healthy ingredients! It was the perfect amount for one serving. I'll surely make again!

Delicious. Just rode 40 miles on my road bike and needed a protein smoothie and I found a container of chocolate protein powder so searched for a recipe and allrecipes.com delivered again.

This is yummy.  I used a 'frozen' banana so it reduced the amount of ice.  B/c I need fiber I added 1/4 of quick oats, used honey to sweeten and a half of an avocado  (reduces cholesterol).  This will be a staple in my home.  Thanks for sharing!!

Super quick and easy! I added unsweetened almond milk instead of regular milk, and a few tablespoons of plain greek yogurt to thicken it a little bit and to add some more protein. It was delicious! Will make again.

This was amazing! My three young very picky eaters devoured this delicious smoothie! I substituted cocoa powder with a hot chocolate packet and it worked. This will be a new staple in our household.

It tasted spectacular for a protein shake! But I must say, I am not a fan of chocolate but still laudable.

I have a honey allergy so I omitted the honey and unsweetened cocoa powder. I made it with chocolate milk to give it the extra chocolate flavour it would otherwise be missing but I didn't want all the extra sugars so I used only 1/2 cup and added extra ice (I like a thick shake). My brand of protein powder packs a good chocolate punch so I tried the recipe again without the chocolate milk and it still tasted like it had a nice balance of chocolate-PB-banana . I don't know what the original version tastes like but if you've got a good protein powder you can skip the honey & cocoa. That's what they do at the gym.

So so delicious! It's by far my favorite protein shake recipe. It's filling too and probably saved me when I drank these after 2 wisdom teeth were pulled and I had to be on a liquid diet.

Words cannot describe how great this tastes. I had been doing something like this without the honey and peanut butter and it didn’t taste very good, but this is significantly better.

I loved it!!! My mother did also and she rarely drinks protein shake. However, I like chocolate and peanut butter more, but my mom likes less chocolate and we were able to figure it out

Very nice, not too sweet, not too chalky. Cocoa powder can be reduced or cut for a more peanut butter-banana flavor.

I followed the recipe as written and it was very delicious and filling.  I'm going to try it without peanut butter next time as a comparison to see if I like it that way as well.

As a base recipe, this was great. I made changes based off what I have at home and used almond butter and added 1/2 c oats, used dark cocoa and probably could have made without the honey. As a chocolate lover, this hit the spot!  It was definitely thinner than I was hoping for. Changes I’ll make next time: frozen banana and soy milk

This was very very good. I am so grateful that I found this, because I had Vega protein powder but just could not stand the taste of it and did not know what to do with it. I made a smaller glass to test taste first using 12 oz unsweetened almond milk, 1 tbsp of honey, 1 tbsp of peanut butter, and less than half a banana , with half a scoop of Vega mocha protein powder and this turned out amazing. It wasn’t too thick, didn’t have a strong earthy smell, and most importantly it was good.
I definitely will continue to use to help me achieve my protein intake.

Awesome!!! So I made it exactly as listed, except without the cocoa powder.  The whey protein was already chocolate flavored, so I thought it would be fine. It was a little over 2 cups.  All of the flavors blended perfectly with these measurements. Comes out to around 500 calories. Next time, I will make 1.5 servings,  in order to have a good post workout shake.

First I I should make it known that that I NEVER wrote a review on ANYTHING! However, this most definitely deserves a review! I used Body Fortress Protein Powder and I used Almond/Coconut silk milk instead of 2% milk. I added every other ingredient except for ice, cocoa powder and bananas only because my bananas weren’t ripe yet. And even w/o those three ingredients it was so good!

Turned out great. I skipped the honey and I think it’s sweet enough. I had a Chocolate PJ shake at Jamba Juice the other day and who really wants to pay that premium all the time. This closely resembles it but it is a little thinner in consistency. That didn’t bother me though. Great flavor!

This was delicious! I didn't have any protein powder left so I just made it without. I modified it a little by I using a frozen banana, unsweetened almond milk, added 1/2 an avocado and some extra unsweetened cocoa because I like a richer chocolate flavor.  Great recipe!

This drink was so good! I did however add half almond milk and and half regular milk! I also didn't add the coco powder and it was still so good.

Delicious, but I will probably only make it on days when I finish an intense workout. The way I made it, it had 545 calories and 38 grams of protein. It's definitely a meal.

My first attempt at a meal replacement protein shake. I used Silk Vanilla Almond Milk instead of cows milk. It was awesome!

A fantastic recipe is great as written or can easily be adjusted with an addition of oats, etc. I often make this as a snack!

Absolutely amazing. This was my first time trying it and since I didn't have any coca powder, I used  a little bit of chocolate milk. I love it!!

Great recipe! Was thinking about buying expensive "Shakeology" or "It Works" products until I found this recipe. Used vanilla protein powder, as that is what I had. Turned out out great!

Fantastic recipe!!! The only differences are I added a tablespoon of vanilla yogurt and used almond milk. Thank you for sharing!

Delicious smoothie/healthy shake! The peanut butter, chocolate, and banana all come through without any particular one dominating the flavor. I  did sub almond milk and truvia. And because it was Saturday and I had already done my exercise for the day, I added fat-free whipped topping to make it extra special!
