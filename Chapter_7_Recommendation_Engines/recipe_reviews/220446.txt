I didn’t make the frosting as the ratio of 3:1 powdered sugar to butter was just too butter-heavy for my liking.  The cupcakes baked nicely and after decorating them for Valentine’s Day they were cute as a button.  As for taste, however, I was let down. They were nondescript – not chocolatey enough, not moist enough, not sweet enough.

These were excellent and were well liked by my family.  I had to cook them about 30 minutes and I used a little more Bailey's in the frosting :)

Yum! I emitted the chocolate chips but the recipe came out great! Baked for 19 minutes. Top is a little crispy but the inside is soft and moist. I got 27 cupcakes at about 2/3s full a cup. Nice flavor.

The cupcakes were ok, but the frosting was oily and a poor consistancy. I've used several frosting recipes from allrecipes website with good success, but this is the first one that I had to throw away.

I made this as a cake in a 9x13 pan and it was very good!  The frosting was a big hit, although I did half it since I was just frosting a sheet cake.  Great chocolate flavor and a nice denseness.

This worked perfectly and made super delicious cupcakes! They weren't overly sweet, which was great because the icing was very sweet. A perfect combination! Thanks, I will definitely make them again!

These cupcakes were delicious, my whole family loved them! I added 1/4 cup of milk, and then 1 cup of water, instead of 1 1/4 cup of water. I also used 1 1/3 cups of sugar instead of 1 2/3 cups. Over all, the cupcakes were delicious, but I have yet to try the frosting. Thanks for the awesome recipe! :)

I enjoyed the flavor, but my frosting was rather runny.  I may have done something wrong though.  Who knows?!

I made these yesterday and it turned out really good. i didn't hav chocolate chips so, had to do without it & I used vanilla butter cream frosting. Everyone loved it. But my family thought plain cupcakes were not sweet enough so it needs some frosting definitely. I'will be doing this again & again.

There cupcakes were flavorful. I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla in the cake batter. That gave it the choc chip mint flavor  #stpaddysdaydesserts

These cupcakes came out moist and rich. The frosting was just amazing! I didn’t make any substitutions in the cake portion but for the frosting I did not add food coloring. Bailey’s is a tan-colored liqueur so I thought that leaving the frosting’s natural color would be best. I added just a few chocolate sprinkles. I will definitely make these again.

Pretty darn good. I added a bunch of dark chocolate melts to the batter with mini choc chips.  I didn't have green food color so I used green melts in the frosting along with Bailey's Irish Cream coffee creamer.  My husband's office DEVOURED them.
Thanks for the recipe!

These cupcakes came out fluffy and moist. I even lowered the amount of cocoa powder and it was still chocolatey enough. I look forward to seeing how the frosting turns out tomorrow!

This recipe is amazing. I use it a lot for cakes and cupcakes and they always come out super moist and with perfect chocolate flavor. I have never tried making the frosting but I'm sure that is just as good. I highly recommend it this recipe to everyone.

These are so wonderful! One of my new favorites! Very rich! I had to make mine with blue frosting for a shower but the Irish creme tasted great even with Yankee frosting! I added 2 more tbsp of Bailey's to mine cuz the frosting needed more moisture I thought. Excellent!

Great recipe!  Made it twice, only change was a 1/2 cup butter.  Turned out great.  The third batch I made with 1/2 cup oil and they turned out great too.  This will be my new to go recipe for chocolate cupcakes.  Mine all cooked in about 17 minutes.

Awesome.  Only thing is, why water?  I did half Bailey's, half water.  And I used another icing recipe.  Whipped cream icing with 4+ tbsp Bailey's makes these perfect!  Cream cheese frosting also works.

These were great! I made them for a St. Paddy's Day party so I made them as mini cupcakes. The batter and frosting makes a ton. I baked them for probably 13-15 mins instead of 20.

I made this recipe exactly how it is written.  Others noted the frosting to be runny; I added closer to 4 cups of confection sugar and the texture was better. Great recipe.

Made these for Thanksgiving and again for a work potluck Christmas party, everyone loved them, great flavors.  However, you need at least a cup more powdered sugar for the frosting if yu want to pipe it onto the cupcakes.

I didn't make the cupcakes, but the Bailey's frosting was fabulous! I made some chocolate cookies instead and put the frosting on those. They were a huge hit. Easiest frosting I've ever made!
