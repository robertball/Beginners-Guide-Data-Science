This turned out just ok. The flavor of the cream cheese layer was rather lost and the only taste was that of the banana. The baking time was more like 70 minutes, 20 more than stated in the recipe. I will just stick with my regular banana bread recipe.

Hands down the best banana bread I've ever made, and I am super picky!  It is moist, flavorful, with just the right balance of sweetness.  I doubled the recipe and made a loaf with half and 20 muffins with the other half.  Both were incredibly delicious.  After 25 years of cooking my search for the perfect banana bread recipe has finally ended!

Yum, yum, and yum. This loaf isn't as high as other loaf recipes,  but who cares?! It tastes amazing! Very moist. The sour cream flavor doesn't come through or make it taste 'sour'. My guess is it's used for moisture. The cream cheese filling is light and almost bread-like with the addition of the 3 Tbsp flour. So it's not like a cheese Danish with a big blob of cream cheese in the middle. It's absolutely perfect. The only change I made was a few swipes of fresh nutmeg on the microplane, just because.

I have to admit, I almost never follow a recipe exactly. This was no exception. I wanted to get rid of more bananas, so I used 2 large and 1 smaller. Also, I don't even buy light brown sugar, so dark it was. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. The extra banana made a dense, moist bread which was fine by me, but might be denser than you would like.

This turned out EXCELLENT. When I had a still-warm piece, I thought the cream cheese filling was pretty tasteless, but it improved after cooling. I still may add a little extra sugar and maybe a few drops of lemon juice next time. I did add a couple drops of vanilla to it.

It was fairly easy to make and I had all the ingredients without having to go out and buy anything special. This is definitely going into my favorite recipes folder!

This was an easy recipe to follow. My girlfriend was asking me to make it and she absolutely loved it. The only thing I changed was I double the vanilla extract I used.i will definitely be making this again.

It is very moist and yummy but the cream cheese disappears in there. Next time I'm going to try increasing the cream cheese.

Delicious. it is quite sweet. The cream cheese filling is smooth and is a delightful addition to banana bread. I added about 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts. I used a round 4 cup pyrex bowl. It was not big enough so I put part of the batter in another Pyrex bowl and cooked them for about 45 minutes. It came out perfect. Moist and crisp at the same time.

I made this with some super ripe bananas and it turned out amazing! It does need a good 20 min longer to bake than this recipes instructs, but wow! I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top and it really put it over the top!

Made it, turned out a little too moist which caused the bread to fall apart , Baking time was set at 1 hr. I'll make again but with a few adjustments to perfect.

A neat (and easy) addition to banana bread. I even had to share the recipe with the neighbor.

I've made this recipe twice, it is so good. Think it helps to use a 9X5 GLASS baking dish.  And the temp in your oven is correct. Might want to invest in an oven thermostat.
 The second time I made it, I didn't put enough dough mixture on the bottom.  It didn't raise as well as the first time I made it.  Did not change a thing.  I'm making it again tomorrow.  Will make sure that I do it like I did the first time. thanks for the recipe. It's going to be made at Christmas time for our neighbors.
