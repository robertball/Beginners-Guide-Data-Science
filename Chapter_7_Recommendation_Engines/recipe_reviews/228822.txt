This definitely is "easy and cheesy" and just as the submiter states it's "melt-in-your-mouth delicious"!  I followed the recipe exactly and the result was fabulous.  This is a perfect accompaniment to any meal. Thanks for simple yet wonderful recipe amberfoy1!

Instead of garlic powder, I used half a bulb of homemade roasted garlic. This was off the charts delicious. NO leftovers, we ate the whole thing.

it was very good,it had a great taste,I had to omit the parsley because I did not have any on hand and used sliced bread instead of french and it turned it into something like garlic toast,but,all in all,it was great and yes I would use this recipe again,thank you for sharing.

Very easy to make, also simple enough to adjust to individual preference.  Too much parm cheese for our tastes, but will make it again with less.  Will also try cutting the bread all the way through when prepping next time, mine was tough to pull/cut apart after it was baked.  Otherwise, the baking method seemed to work really well in general though.

My 94 year old father-inlaw had 3 pieces!  This was really yummy.  Next time I will open more to allow it to get more crispy.

Good and easy but I think the garlic could be toned down a whole lot. Waaaay too much. It makes you gag. I only used 1 and 1/2 tablespoons and it was still too much. I think I'll down it to 3/4 tablespoon or just 1 tablespoon next time.

This was fabulous.  I did slice the bread completely through first as I did not want to mess with it when it was hot.  Thanks for this recipe.

DELICIOUS! Made this exactly as written, except for cutting the bread all the way through, so I didn't have to try and cut it while it was hot. Oh, also, I had granulated garlic and that's stronger than garlic powder, so I did use less. This was so buttery, cheesy and garlicky~YUM! I will def be making this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used four cloves of fresh garlic, finely minced, and a baguette so we would have smaller slices. It was amazing! My boyfriend couldn't stop eating the bread... Usually my mozza-stuffed meatballs are the main dish, but he put some meatballs back so he could eat more bread! Thank you so much for sharing. ??

I made this for a family reunion at the lake. I thought it was ok but everyone else loved the bread. So I gave it five stars. The oven was quirky and was part of the problem. It's a good recipe for large numbers. I will make it again. I made no changes to this except I cut the bread all the way through for easy removal when hot.

We loved it.  Only thing changed was reducing garlic powder to 1 Tablespoon.  Just right amount garlic, cheese and yummy. Butter.

I needed to use up half of a hoagie roll so scaled this down. I sliced it in half lengthwise, spread on the butter and sprinkled on the rest. It was I then put the halves back together, wrapped in foil and baked on the top rack of the grill. It was simple and tasty this way.

Yum! This is a great base that can be modified to suit your taste, if you want a saltier cheesier flavour, add more cheese, if you want the butter and garlic to shine throug, use less cheese.

I loved the taste of this garlic bread. However, it was a little soggy/soft in the middle. I ended up toasting all the slices individually and it tasted pretty good with a nice crunch.

Delicious, but needed a touch of salt to help the flavors pop.

Is now my standard recipe for this.

OMG so good I've made this twice. Using a fork helps put the Garlic Butter in-between the sliced bread.

This was good but not great. I think there is a bit too much butter in the mixture and not enough cheese because it made my bread a little bit soggy. Cooking time was perfect though.

So Amazing- Plenty cheesy and plenty easy. Great for any pasta dish! If your local grocery store carries them, see if you can get the 'bake at home' French Breads. They are a little under baked on the inside so when you put it in your oven the outside is nice and crunchy but the inside has that touch of softness to it. This recipe has become a staple at my house, thanks amberfoy1!!

Fantastic recipe with crunchy crust and soft, cheesy center! I omitted parsley and substituted a teaspoon of crushed garlic from a jar.

Very good! Didn't change anything, but we melted the butter almost all the way through so that it was liquid but also still somewhat soft and dense.

This was really easy and definitely a keeper. I halved the recipe to use up some leftover hoagie bread rolls and there was enough to spread on 4 bread halves. I liked the inclusion of parsley and Parmesan cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my yum, yum, yum. The best garlic bread I have ever had. I made as posted but just eyeballed everything instead of measuring.

Adjust Parm and garlic powder to taste, of course. With that in mind, give it a chance and you won't ever be satisfied with store-bought garlic bread again. Simply fantastic!

I followed the recipe exactly and even measured (which I rarely do, unless baking).  Next time I will use either roasted garlic (but then it wouldn't be so easy) or minced fresh garlic and a teaspoon of garlic powder.  I cut nearly all the way through the bread, loosely wrapped in foil and placed in a disposable aluminum pan.  I would make again in a heart beat but I agree that two tablespoons might be a little over the top in powdered form - and I love garlic!

I put half the garlic since I didn't have two tablespoons, it was great just as it was, don't think I would put in two teaspoons next time.  Will definitely make again!

Far too much garlic powder. 1 tablespoon would be sufficient.

I will definitely make it again, but I changed the recipe a bit to make it extra cheesy. I added two types of cheese for double the cheese, but I used mozzarella and sharp cheddar instead of parm. It turned out well.

Very tasty.  Loved the butter blend.  I was tempted to use fresh garlic but thought the powder would spread better.  Glad I did.  I thought it did work better as a spread.  Next time I will leave the foil open more to get the bread toastier.  Great recipe.

I love making this!  In a pinch, I used a box of Texas Toast garlic bread and added shredded cheese and it was tasty but nothing like making it from scratch.

Loved it! I had two day old french bread, leftover from soup. So it was a little stale, it turned out wonderfully even so! I didnt put any parsley because i didnt have any on hand, i also added a handful of shredded mix blend cheese, Yum!

This came together so quick and easy.  I didn't want a recipe where I had to add a lot of this and that.  I used a roasted bulb of garlic in place of the dry.  Soooo good I may give up my usual recipe!
