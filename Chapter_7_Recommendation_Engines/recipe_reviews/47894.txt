This is a delicious recipe - and can be made even better by using this old New England trick. First of all I reduced the size of the recipe to 4 servings, so the measurements here reflect that.  I cooked and cleaned 2 (1 1/4 lb) lobsters, saved the juice that came out when I pulled them apart, (discarding all coral and tomally) cut up the meat and set it aside.  Then I put the broken up shells (excluding the part with the head, which I threw away) in a stew pot with about 2 1/2  cups of milk, along with the juice from the lobsters, and let it just barely simmer for maybe an hour. I strained all the shells out and discarded them, and then used this for the 2 1/4 cups of  milk the smaller recipe called for. I also sauteed minced fresh onion in the butter to soften it before I added the flour. I simmered the thickened broth for just a few minutes and then added the lobster meat, shut off the heat and just let it sit to blend the flavors. Too much simmering will overcook the lobster meat. I didn't use a whole tablespoon of paprika, either, and omitted the tsp of salt, but that is a matter of taste.

This recipe earned its "5" hands down.  I made it exactly as is and it was spectacular.  The mild heat of the paprika gently offset the sweet of the lobster.  The very subtle taste of onion supported it all.  None of these flavors covered the lobster.  The fact that this recipe is so easy makes it even better!  This recipe will be in our family for a long, long time.

This is super quick and easy and must add rewarding at the end! 2+1/2 hour lobster bisque just doesn't fit in my schedule. This soup should sit for an hour or two before served, it was even better than,it has a stronger lobster flavor rather when it is first finished.

It was delicious!!  I did add a can of tomato paste, and a little bit of white wine :)  I also substituted snow crab for the lobster.  I've made it twice now and it's always a favorite :)

This was wonderful, though I made some substitutions to my version.  I omitted the celery salt and used a bit of thyme and sage.  I added some wine at the same time as the stock (I used lobster stock, but I'm sure it would be good with other stock as well), and let that cook off before continuing.  Then I used half and half rather than light cream (only because I had it on hand) and it came out wonderful!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Needed a quick and easy dinner and this one fit the bill. We ended up using frozen langostino tail meat which I used in place of the lobster. Also, I had no celery salt and no cream.  I just used 5 cups of whole milk. The bisque was so creamy and flavorful with all the butter and whole milk, I didn't miss the cream anyways.  And as I do with all of my cream based soups, I added about 2+ teaspoons of red wine vinegar when I took the soup off the heat.  I'm not sure what it does exactly, but it gives all cream based soups extra depth.  Soooo good!  It hit the spot on this cold day!

I really enjoy this recipe. it was very easy to make. I added a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a bit of a kick to it. And i left out the light cream, which tasted perfectly fine without.

I made as directed, and it was good, but it seemed to be missing some depth.  So, I added about one shot of good sherry to it about 5 minutes before serving, stirring it in thoroughly.  The sherry made ALL the difference in the world!  What was a good bisque became a fabulous bisque that is possibly my new favorite.  Also, for those that like their bisques with a little kick, you can sprinkle a dash of cayenne pepper on top along with a little aged Parmesan or green onion (or both!).  The cayenne, green onion, and Parmesan will add a little color and finish the dish off nicely.  With the sherry, this is a solid 5 star dish.

I made this today, and the flavors are phenomenal!  I agree with previous posts that this recipe would work excellently with crab as well.  I followed the recipe but added about 1/3 cup of dry sherry and a dash of cayenne.  Definitely a five-star bisque!

We didn't use celery salt, we added a bay leaf, and cut the butter and flour down to 4 tablespoons each...used 1/ & 1/2 and sprinkled with chives and grated parmesean cheese right before serving...Good comfort food

I've vacationed in Tampa, FL a few times and there's a little cafe in Clearwater Beach that serves a seafood bisque. I must have it several times whenever I'm there and I've been trying to find a close recipe ever since.  Well this is the closest I've came and it might actually be a little better.  The last (and best) time I made it I used 1lb of bay scallops and 2 5oz cans of crab meat.  The flavor was awesome.  Any kind of shellfish will be good, doesn't have to be lobster.  Although I wouldn't use shrimp by itself, since shrimp has less flavor than other shellfishes. I also season this initially with salt, pepper, paprika, and celery salt according to the recipe.  Then I season it to taste in the final stages of cooking using Tony Cachere's cajun seasoning. It is a 1st class five-star recipe.

Tasted great but very very rich.  May use a little less butter and less whole milk nand cream ext time.

I have a variation that I use a cup of light cream, a pinch of cayanne pepper and just shy of 1/4 cup cooking sherry. I'm known as "the soupmiester" with this one!

I just made this soup last night and I must say, it was wonderful!  I read other reviews and took some of their suggestions into consideration - the end result?  My husbands words were:  "*&%^ Incredible!...this is a DO OVER, and DO OVER AGAIN".  I added a can of tomato paste and a bit if white wine as suggested by someone else.  I also used rock lobster tails (I can't find canned lobster here), 4 huge shrimp, and 2 cans of crab meat, so it ended up being 'seafood bisque'.  There is NONE left today, and I think I'll make a double batch the next time!  I'd also add more paprika and a dollop of tabasco just to give it a little bit if a kick.  Served it with foccacia bread and it was a huge hit!

So good, but I did vary. I took the lobster meat out of the tails. Made stock out of the tails instead of using chicken stock. Took the meat chopped it up and then marinated in sherry for about 30 mins. Sauted the onions and lobster in butter. The followed the recipe. If you can find Lobster base add that too so much more favor.

WOW, WOW, WOW. Made this to accompany a lobster tail dinner for my family and EVERYONE raved!  My father-in-law even stated that he's had lobster bisque all over the world and that this recipe was on-par with some of the best restaurants he's been to. And the best part?- it was SOOO easy to make! I did add about 2 tablespoons of dry cocktail sherry to it at the end.  Thanks so much for the fantastic recipe!!

This was wonderful! I didn't change anything. This definitely needs to sit for a day or two to blend all the flavors. I will also try this soup base for shrimp or crab bisque as well.

I have not made this yet but perhaps what is missing is a hint of sherry which I have had in most seafood bisques.  Got this hint from a pub that makes fresh lobster bisque daily.

We thought this was good, but that it was really missing something we've had in restaurant bisque.  I'm going to give it another try sometime and add a little bit of white wine, as another person suggested.

This was very tasty and easy to make! I made one minor change, and that was to add one chopped clove of garlic to the butter at the beginning. I would highly recommend this recipe (with the garlic added).

Very good.  I did use crab instead of Lobster and my husband wanted me to add corn.  It was great!  Everyone loved it and my husband said it was better the next day!

Very delicious and easy! I made a few changes too- added 1/2 cup dry white wine, used 2 cups each of heavy cream, milk, and chicken broth (in which I simmered the lobster shells for 10 min). YUMMY

This is an excellent recipe.I added a cup of dry white wine, and used half and half instead of cream and milk. It is very tasty and the base would serve wonderfully for any seafood soup/chowder. It is a definite keeper!

I substituted lump crab for the lobster, used 1% milk and whipping cream instead of light cream since I had that at home. Otherwise followed recipe...EXCELLENT! My 4 and 7 year olds were standing in the kitchen begging for taste after taste when it was done. Big hit for my dad's birthday! Can't wait to try it with lobster.

We had this for our 2012 Christmas dinner. We loved our own tweaked version. I had never made this dish before so this recipe was most helpful.With alldue respect I totally revamped the recipe.
In place of the chicken broth I use a vegetable and a chicken Flavor Booster (by Swanson). I also used a heaping half cup of flour. I used  no salt celery or regular.
Instead of milk I used 1 quart fat free half and half and the near the endI used 4 seafood flavor booster packets.Paprika made the difference. Also added of original Mrs. Dash. It was unamiously declared divine. Our two year old granddaughter ate an entire bowl. Huge hit.

I made this soup several times. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly.  I am giving it five stars because of how easy it is to make.   My husband, the bisque snob said it was missing something, but it was still good. 

The last time I made it I think I got it right.  I used fish stock instead of chicken stock, left out the cream, added tarragon, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and sherry.  I also added a bit of lumb crab meat.  It tasted GREAT, and got RAVE reviews at a family dinner.  I have also made this recipe leaving out the cream and using lactose-free milk.  It was a treat for people who can't normally eat bisque without suffering an upset (lactose intolerant) stomach.  The Lactaid milk seemed to have made it taste kind of "sweet, but I added a bit more cayenne and it was still terrific.

This was pretty good, but we felt like something was missing without tomato paste. Also - make sure you use good lobster. The kind we had was not the best and it really detracted from the bisque. Not taking that into consideration, I felt this was a 4/5. With a bit more tomato-y base, I think it could easily be a 5.

All in all this is a good soup. Made this as directed and the flavor is right there. The soup to me needs to be a tad richer and I would ad some Cabernet or Merlot to taste. Since I plan on making this again, I will continue to tweak the recipe just a little.

I was looking for a recipe similar to the bisque I had once in Mystic Seaport, CT.  This wasn't it.  Not very good for all the effort and it didn't get as thick as I'd have liked.

Only giving 4 stars because I added a ton of extras that were suggested in the reviews below, such as some bay leaves, white wine, garlic salt, minced garlic, red cayenne, can of tomato paste, and extra pepper.  This, being my first time ever making a lobster bisque, found so many different variations online - and I was looking for one that was easier rather than complex.  This was the perfect inbetween of everything.  It was very, VERY easy to make and so filling and enjoyable! I have left overs that I can't wait to rush home from work to get to!

Followed maylanadalia's recommendation and simmered the shells from 2 tails in milk for about 15 minutes (which smelled amazing) which we then poured through a sieve into the roux.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly as stated, except threw in raw lobster from the tails at the end.  It was truly an exceptional recipe.  I didn't think the salt was necessary (as the celery salt is salty enough) - I say hold the salt and add as needed later. Next time I may try adding a bit of onion, celery and carrots to make a really rich broth, but I really did think it tasted perfect as is, that would just add a tiny bit more to an already amazing recipe.

This is the best recipe of Lobster Bisque I have found.  The only thing I made a mistake on is that I usually only have non-fat milk in my fridge, so the sauce was not at thick as it probably would have been with whole milk.  So just incase..use milk with some fat in it. :)   This has made it on my family's favorite dinner items.

Fantastic. I didn't have have celery salt on hand, so I used vegetable seasoning, and I don't like the texture of onions so I used onion powder, but this was excellent. Fed it to a chef-friend of mine who was a little worried because he usually finds bisque to be more boiled shells than actual shellfish, and he also loved it (he felt it was more like chowder than bisque). This recipe is a keeper. (Will make it again next time we have leftovers after a feed of lobster.)

This was easy and delicious.  We found that the 3 tablespoons of minced onion was a little too much, and we found we added a dash, or 2 dashes of cayenne pepper.  We also used the immitation lobster and chopped it finely, and it was very tasty.  Thanks for the Sunday afternoon lunch!

Just like other reviews, I opted to simmer the shells in the milk for about half an hour before adding it, as well as added the onions in before the flour.  Additionally I would recommend garnishing with green onions, cayenne pepper and a bit of Tabasco-enjoy!

Excellent!  I minimized the milk to 4 cups.  Plus, I minimized the flour to 4 tablespoons. Then I added a can of tomato paste, a finely chopped stalk of celery, a bay leaf, and a 1/4 teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning.  I added a few extra chunks of lobster as my husband loves it.  The combination of texture, color, aroma, and taste is wonderful! This is so easy to make!

Fabulous everytime I make it.  The best time I added 1/2 cup extra chicken stock and used evaporated milk instead of regular--then cut out the cream--I didn't need it.  I used 3/4T paprika and 1/4T Old Bay.  Pinch of garlic salt, extra pepper.  LOVE IT!

Wonderful... I served at a family birthday party... and they all enjoyed! The only thing I added was a small amount of crushed red pepper which I thought tasted good..

This was such a tasty recipe.  I added slicely thin green onions to garnish it before serving and didn't have light cream so I used half and half.  That came out good still.  I served the soup in a sourdough bread instead of a bowl and I didn't shred the lobster meat.  I diced the lobster meat to give the soup some texture.  Will be making more of this in the future.

This soup is AMAZING in more ways than one!  I used crab meat and shrimp, so it's versatile (besides that I followed the recipe exactly); it was EASY to make; and my dh said it's one of the best seafood bisque soups he has ever had!  I will definitely be making this again!

This is a wonderful recipe!!!! I added a can of tomato paste and substituted 2 cans of crab and 1 can of shrimp in place of the lobster. I also added 2 cloves of pressed garlic and a dash of chili powder for flavor. This soup is just as wonderful as the one I made previously... but a fraction of the price. This is going to be a family favorite and a permanent fixture in my recipe box. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe with everyone. Yummy!

really good. I added white wine. You could definitely make this using less lobster if you on a budget. I used the recommended amount are there was plenty of lobster in every bite.

Very good with a minor change. Use 4 c milk instead of 4 1/2. Use 1 c fat free half and half instead of 1/2 c light real cream.  I also made this with @ lbs of claw crabmeat instead of the lobster.  Both were very good soups!

This bisque was amazing!!!! Definitely restaurant quality.
I followed recipe amounts exactly and added a bay leaf - excellent! I also sauteed the onions in the butter in the beginning instead of adding them in with the lobster at the end. Honestly, this recipe needs no doctoring. It's creamy and wonderful! My whole family loved it :)
Thanks, Tara Edwards!

I loved it so much that I will not lie,I served some as an "Amuse-bouche" just to keep the rest all to myself. (The only thing differently that I did was that I soaked the shells in milk under low heat for an hour)

Most excellent!  For half of this recipe, I used one 10-12 oz lobster tail and 10" sauté pan.  I added a one-eighth teaspoon of old Bay's seasoning which perked it up a little bit.  You might want hold back on the original salt amount as Bay's is salty enough.  This recipe is a keeper!

EXCELLENT! 
A few additions for our tastes:
Cook onions in butter until transparent
Add 1 tbs flour to rue
Use only 4 cups milk
1/8 cup sherry after milk
Old Bay to taste
We LOVE a thicker bisque and lots of onions and Old Bay; but overall, this recipe is AMAZING! DEFINITELY in the vault!

This was great! I added a little more onion on accident and it was still really good. Didn't have lobster, so I used crawfish. Can't wait to make it again and try adding chopped celery and white wine!

I followed the recipe pretty closely except for the following:  added 1/3 cup sherry with the broth, used unsalted butter, left out plain salt and used 1/2 tsp garlic salt & 1/2 tsp Old Bay instead. Instead of whole milk I used 2.25 c nonfat milk & 2.25 c half&half. Left out last addt'l cream and paprika (it's in the Old Bay anyway). Did not have an onion so I used dried minced, 1.5 Tbsp. i pureed the bisque with an immersion blender to distribute the lobster flavor throughout the bisque. This thickens it a bit too. I served with Parmesan garlic bread toasted under the broiler and a nice salad. 4 stars.

Great tasting, quick and easy.  Substituted half and half as I did not have light cream on hand.  I also steeped the shells from the picked claws, spilt tails and knuckles from 3 lobsters we had for supper the night before...as another reviewer suggested.  Finally, I added the kernels from 2 ears of sweet corn at the same time I dropped the lobster meat.  An ultimate leftover soup/meal that will be made again.

Deliciousness! Loved the flavour, and it was a great way to use up leftover lobster that I had. Only thing I may change would be to purée the onions to add to the bisque. It would make the texture a bit more creamy. Lovely recipe! Thank you! :-)

Perfect!  I wanted a basic bisque for my stone crab claws and this was perfect as is.  I did make a broth from my crab shells instead of using chicken broth, but I am sure it's just as good with the chicken.  I will definately make this again!

Absolutely perfect. I make the chicken broth from scratch (chicken, lots of bay leaves, and some chives) and I add several cloves of garlic (because I add garlic to everything) Its best if you put the lobster in and then refrigerate overnight. I also used 3 cups milk and 2 cups half half and half because its essentially the same thing.

SO GOOD!

This recipe was a hit at my daughters birthday party.  First time I had ever made a bisque and I have to say that I was proud of it.  I'm not the best cook so I made sure I told everyone I made it.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

This is great! I have been adding a tiny bit of tomato paste as some others suggested. I never seem to have chicken stock so I end up using broth and adding some seasonings to it

This rating may be due to my own inexperience in the kitchen, however, this tasted like flour to me.  I added TONS of seasing to try to cover it up, but it has not worked.  I will try again in time, making a roux.

Very good flavor!  I used shrimp instead of lobster, and half n half instead of cream.  I also added chopped celery, and some cayenne pepper for a kick.  I don't know if it was because of my substitutions but it came out kind of  thin.  I would prefer it to be a bit thicker. Next time I will try to thicken it up a bit more.  I WILL be making this again.

This was an amazing bisque! I've never made one before, but I had dinner at a seafood restaurant and we had tons of lobster meat leftover, so I decided to use them for this recipe. It was amazing. So flavorful and though it took some time to make, it was definitely worth it. I wish I made more!

Loved this recipe. My husband made it while I was at work. He said he added some worcester sauce and sherry cooking wine as others had suggested and also a little bit of Chipotle. Will make it again for sure!

wow, I was surprised how restaurant-quality the taste was!  I didn't taste it once, as I was cooking, but when I tasted the final product, it was pretty darn good!  One final note, I put in a lot of extra paprika (just for my own tastes I suppose), it was delicious!

I gave the recipe 4 stars because I added a few ingredients to make it just perfect for me. I added cooking sherry, Worcestershire sauce,  and heavy cream instead of light. I loved it, but next time I think I might add some corn to it, to make it a little like lobster corn chowder.

This was very good!  I did make a couple of changes, to our taste.  I added a small can of tomato paste, a little cayenne pepper, used shallots instead of onion and sauteed those in the butter before adding the flour and other ingredients.  I also used all 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.  The only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is I personally felt it was a little bland, even with the added cayenne pepper.  I added a couple of dashes of hot sauce to mine, which made it outstanding.  My husband thought it was amazing as it was.

followed most of the recipe.  i used 3 claws and simmered the shells in some chicken broth. made a roux of the butter and flour.  added some milk and the chicken/lobster broth. 
omitted the cream and added 1 can of cr. mushroom soup (because i wanted a really creamy soup) , onion, salt, pepper, paprika and tarragon.  excellent.  will make again.

I added 1/2 cup dry Sherry to bring up the sweetness. It made enough to serve at least six as the main luncheon item. I did not shred the lobster, just cut it into small chunks.  Will make again.

I cooked it with another chef’s comment to simmer milk with crushed shells for 1 hour and pour in.  It made it more flavorful but too salty for my taste.  It still turned out rich broth chalked full of lobster.

I halved the recipe as I only had about 1.5 cups of lobster. I followed the recipe exactly and only added some fresh ground pepper upon serving. Delicious!

Not as flavorful as expected.  I had to add flavor to it as I did not have fish stock, I boiled the lobster in water to get my fish stock, to try and get all the goodness that I could.  I ended up adding clam juice, a can of crab and some chicken bouillon.  It upped the flavor but still was not what I wanted.  I contacted a Chef friend and he said to bake the shells in the oven, with tomato paste slathered on the shells, this would help get a more flavorful stock.  I'm trying this next time!

It needed a bit more flavour to suit our taste, so I used 1/2 good-quality stock 1/2 milk alternative (lactose free household). I added a pinch of garlic powder and a splash of fresh lemon juice at the end. Most likely this would be best as a make ahead recipe, so that the flavours can build. Edit: it tastes much better after sitting in the fridge for  a couple of hours. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Really rich and tasty recipe! The only changes I made were adding a teaspoon of old bay seasoning, carrots, mushrooms and imitation lobster was used. When the soup was about finished I blended about half of the contents in the pot and then mixed back together. 

Will definitely make again!

I made this the other night for dinner and it turned out amazing!! My husband loved it! He likes food a little more spicy so I added more cayenne pepper, black pepper, pepper flakes and a dash of hot and spicy seasoning which really ramped up the flavor!! 

I didn't have any cream and just used milk and added 8tbs butter instead of 6. I also didn't have any chicken broth and substituted it with a cube of Knorr beef bullion and it still turned out fantastic ! Definitely a repeater!

Made this for my family Christmas party.  It was a huge hit.  Made it exactly according to instructions.  For each 1-1.25 lb. lobster, it gives you about 1/2 cup of lobster meat.  Everyone commented on how much meat was in the bisque.  They loved it and said it was the best lobster bisque they've ever had.  I made it the day before my party due to time constraints, refrigerated it overnight, and warmed it up in the crock pot on LOW, stirring it periodically as it warmed up.

In response to PERRY1833's comment about the broth simply tasting like milk...  You must have made it wrong.  You have to add the milk to the flour/butter slowly.  My guess it that you didn't do it slowly which is probably why you had a milky broth.  I did it as instructed and it was a very creamy broth.  If your wrist doesn't get tired during the milk adding part of the recipe, you're probably adding it too quickly.

Will definitely be making this again for future family gatherings.

This did not taste anything like lobster bisque.  I made it exactly how the recipe is written without any changes.  It tasted like lobster with milk poured over it.

What a disappointment... Maybe I should be more disappointed in myself in choosing a quick recipe instead of a slow cooking one. But this was my first time making one and I was super excited about it and this one had great reviews... I, too, made this one exactly as it says. I give it 2 stars because it was edible. Won't make again... Wouldn't recommend. If a Perrys Steakhouse is in your town- go there. That's what I say is the best lobster bisque.

I followed all the steps but made some ingredient substitutions. Since this was spur of the moment craving,  I used shrimp instead of lobster and shallots instead of onion.  I omited the cream at the end as I thought it was rich enough. my husband loved it! I loved it! I'm looking to try it with lobster as I'm sure it will be even better.

I made this tonight and my family licked the pot clean! Yummy! I did make a few changes, based on what I had and other suggestions in reviews. I had surimi in the fridge, so I used that instead of lobster. I added a few dashes of hot sauce, a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, replaced the onion with onion powder, and added just enough red wine vinegar at the end to add a little bite (white wine or sherry would probably be better for this, but I didn't have any and the vinegar worked well). This was a huge hit! It will go into my rotation, for sure!

This was a very good recipe, I also boiled the shells in the milk beforehand. After the bisque was finished I used this to make lobster pot pie, which was really good. All I had to was roll flat pillsbury grands and push into a pie pan I baked that for about 10 mins pushed it flat in the pan again and poured the bisque in. I covered the pie with another layer of biscuit dough and baked for another 10-15 minutes. The biscuit dough was too fluffy to make multiple smaller portions in a muffin pan. Next time I would probably try in with regular pie crust.

Wonderful!  I looked at the reviews and made some very slight changes based on them.  I halved the recipe so my measurements will reflect that.  I made my own lobster broth with the tail shells (added a bay leaf to the broth).  I used skim milk and 1/2 and 1/2 for the 1/4 C at the end.  It was still SUPER rich!  I used 2 lobster tails which provided plenty of meat.  My husband LOVED it and ate the whole thing.  I got a teeny bowl which was fine because it was so rich.  Great recipe and EASY to make!  I think I would add some garlic and maybe even a little tarragon or something next time.

This was my first attempt to ever make a bisque. The only things I did differently, based on other reviews, was 1-I used half and half  2- I put about 2tsp tomato paste.  Also, since I was using lobster tail to make this, I boiled the tails, took the meat out and put it aside.  Using the same water I boiled them in, I put the lobster shells,  I put in some Cajun spices, some garlic and thyme, and sage.  I let it slow boil while I did all the steps to make the bisque.  I strained the water when it came time to add the chicken stock, but instead I added the lobster stock I just made (it did reduce to half). We LOVED this recipe, I made it for valentines day, and I will definitely make it again!

This is a delicious and very easy soup. I used langostinos instead of lobster. I added a other 1/2 cup of flour because mine was not thickening up. I used whole milk and left out the cream. Very very good. Everyone loved it.

The only reason I did not give this recipe 5 stars is because I had to doctor it a little. When I did though, this soup came out soooo creamy and delicious!! 
  First off, I didn't have whole milk, so I added a little extra flour to make it thicken. 
   For the spices, I omitted the celery salt and used garlic salt, then I used 1.5 tablespoons paprika and added a 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (I like a little heat). I also added a bay leaf when I added the paprika.
  Instead of 3 tbs onion, I added a whole onion after I sauted it in a separate pan with some butter and a clove of garlic. I also could not find light cream at the store so I used whipping cream. With all of these changes it came out amazing!!
