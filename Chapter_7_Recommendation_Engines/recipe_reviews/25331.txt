I LOVE these beans! I've made them a few times and it is the quickest, easiest recipe, and it's great to take to work the next day. I also did not put any seasoning into the rice, and I cannot find Adobo anywhere so I found a recipe online to make your own: 1 TBS oregano, 2 TBS garlic powder, 2 TBS onion powder, and 1/5 TBS cumin.

Fast and easy but awful. Way too much adobo too salty. I had to add anothe can of beans for it to feed 4 people.

Pretty good and really fast and easy. Reminded me of meatless chili. I added a little bit of ground red pepper for a little more zing.

Don't use the oregano, basil or thyme or olive oil.  This isn't an Italian dish!  I tried it your way and my mouth was confused!  Getting snowed in can be sooo frustrating.  Next time, use bacon grease or peanut oil and ground chiles..or chopped fresh chiles .. use garlic fresh or dried, salt, and LOTS of dried cumin.  ( Cumin is what gives Mexican foods their "Mexicaness" ) God bless you!

This was amazingly wonderful!  I run a daycare in Massachusetts and thought that the kids would think it to be a little too weird, but they all loved it (except my son, who does not like rice, not the recipe's fault, LOL)!  Will certainly make again!

I have made this recipe several times, and really liked it.  BUT yesterday was the first time I used the adobo seasoning.  This really killed it for me.  The previous reviewer suggested leaving out all the "italian" seasonings because their mouth was confused.  I have to agree that with ALL ingredients, I didn't like it as much.  My 4 yr old gobbled it up, as is...but my husband and I did not enjoy it.  It is an easy recipe.  When I first found this, I was looking for some sort of beans and rice recipe that was not like black beans and rice (something different?).  Without the adobo, it's like spaghetti sauce with beans and we liked it quite a bit.  By the way, I did drain and rinse my beans.

This is a great dish!  I made an oops though.  I had to double it because we have 8 people in the family.  I didn't realize that Adobo is primarily salt.  I added double the amount of Adobo and it was too salty.  Fortunately, I did not add any salt to the rice.

This felt like a cross between spaghetti and chili.  Pretty good - nothing to knock my socks off but a decent little meal, and something good for when I want a meatless day.  I have no Adobo seasoning and made my own.  I found a variety of recipes so I just made up an easy combination similar to them, except using less salt.  (Even so, salty stuff, but way less than most recipes had.)  I made up a batch using 1 T. salt, 1 T. onion powder, 1 T. garlic powder, 1 T. pepper, 1/2 T. oregano and 1 t. chili powder.  I've made this twice now, and have made it as is, except for the reduced salt, and also I think 1-2/3 cup rice is plenty.  (Side note that for something like this or salad, the beans really should be drained & rinsed, which also reduces the sodium.)(It also does say "American-style" meaning it can be anything it likes.  Also not the first time Mexican & Italian has been mixed - even the Adobo has oregano!)

this was a great recipe, it went over really well with my son who hates beans but loves rice (!?!). I added some left over hummus to the sauce and used brown rice instead of the white.

This was an easy and fairly tasty recipe. Personally I really didn't think it was that wonderful but my husband thought it was awesome! The sauce was very runny so I added cut up cubes of butter to thicken it up. Give this recipe a try.

This was pretty good.  It was nice to have a beans & rice recipe that's DIFFERENT from all the others!  I cooked brown rice instead of white to make it healthier.

Quite good, probably 3.5 stars.  I did not have quite enough tomato sauce and I added extra beans.  I did not drain the beans; unsure if I was supposed to or not.  The rice took a bit longer than the 20 minutes to dry out, you may not need all 4 cups water.  Nice and not soo spicy - unless you get a clump of adobo!  WAY too much for 4 people, imho.

This tasted like beans that were too salty and the tomato sauce was a strange mix with the kidney and adobo seasoning. It looks very pretty--just like the picture! But I don't recommend it. Too acidic, too salty.

This was really good and very easy.  I used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce.  I also used less than half the amount of adobo.  Everything else was exact.  I will definitely make it again.

Great Recipe. Easy and fast. It was a little too salty for my tastes so next time I will cut back on the Adobo. But all in all very tasty. Big hit with my father and kids.

I didn't have adobe, so skipped that part.  I added 1/4 cup chopped onion and 2 cloves chopped garlic.  As someone else said, it reminded me of meatless chili.  My son, age 15, is a dedicated meat-and-potatoes guy, and even he liked this.  Cheap, easy, and everyone will eat it.  Definitely a keeper!

I usually make red beans and rice with sausage. I did not have any so I tried this recipe. Added a little cumin,and lots of garlic. Everyone loved it. Kids too. Do not add too much water, though,  it makes them more creamy as they cook.

Made a good quick and easy meal. Didn't have red beans so used blackeye peas instead. When making this dish didn't seem like it was going to be good but came out very good, I recommend you try it with blackeye peas very good taste.

This was pretty good.  I thought it needed a little more heat so I added Tabasco.  It was also very easy to prepare.   I will probably make again.

Just out of curiosity, am I supposed to drain the beans, or leave the juice? I left the juice, my picky 2-yr. old loved it, and it was much better than my stepmoms(attempt at) spanish rice!
she is sooo jelous... and I couldn't be happier!Thanks!

Easy and tasty. This would make a good quick lunch. I made a few small changes: used fresh herbs instead of dried and doubled their measurements, and used a 1/4 tsp of cumin seeds instead of the adobo seasoning.

I wasn't sure if I was to drain the beans. I used "chipolte" seasoning. Four teaspoons rendered it almost too spicy to eat. I'm think it would be good with 2 tsp. Is chipolte seasoning and adobo seasoing different? 

Will still make it again as it's super quick and no chopping!

I really liked this...a nice, no-frills red beans & rice side dish.  Good flavor, didn't compete with main dish.

Yum! This was Delicious! I did make a few changes :) First off I made my rice separate all i had on hand was yellow rice but worked out perfect! Secondly I diced up an onion and a 1/2 of Bell pepper and a pound of stew meat added those ingredients with the sauce and bean mixture and let it all simmer together for about 45min! Soooooo good!

Nice flavor.  I followed a tip from a previous review to make my own adobo seasoning.  Sauce was a bit runny for me, though - and too much tomato flavor.  I like thick Cajun style red beans and rice better.  I would eat this again, as it was EASY to make... but the kids hardly touched it.  :(

We really liked this one.  I omitted the additional adobo in the rice, but that was the only change.

Interesting improvision on a Cajun dish. However, with the addition of adobo seasoning in place of Cajun seasoning and  the absence of andouille, onion, green bell pepper and celery, this dish can hardly be called "American style". Very interesting flavors, but this is not authentic.

Made these a few weeks ago, and my family liked them a lot.  Making them again tonight.  I read the reviews before preparing the first time -  My favorite thing about this site!  I modified it by adding a second can of beans.  Worked out perfect.  Also, several people mentioned the saltiness and too much adobo.  I have a salt free adobo seasoning I use from Penzey's.  They have many other salt free spices to choose from as well.  I would recommend checking out their website.

We loved this!  It was an easy weeknight dinner. I cooked some sliced smoked sausage and added it in for some added protein.

Very easy and my family liked. My wife was concerned it was going to be hot but it wasn't. Leftovers were even better.

Good! I served this with tacos. I only used garlic and cumin for spices and used much less liquid for a thicker sauce. It was quick and easy and my family enjoyed it.  I'll save this for another time.

delish and so healthy and easy and fast to make but i usually add a second can of kidney beans to make it heartier. One isn't enough. It is too much sauce compared to beans. I also reduce the amount of rice, so that I don't have so much rice leftover. Sometimes i use the tomato sauce as noted, sometimes i use ready made Rinaldi or other healthy pasta sauce in the glass jars.
