Some reviews said it did not stick to the spaghetti so I left out 1 can of tomatoe sauce and added 1--  6 oz can of tomatoe paste.
Simmer  until reduced to your  desired thickness about 30 min.
P.S. I also added 1 can of sliced mushrooms.

I used crushed tomatoes with basil in place of the diced tomatoes & the basil (it's what I had on hand) & I only added one can of tomato sauce as I prefer a thicker sauce.   I added homemade meatballs, simmered it about 30 minutes & it was delicious. My hubby & I both agreed it was the best spaghetti sauce I ever made & this is how I will make it from now on.   It wasn't chunky ...  
just thick, rich & delicious.  Thanks for sharing !!!

Really simple, really easy and really delicious. Can't go wrong here. I used fresh basil and garlic though. Thanks Soulfood for your recipe.

My new go-to sauce.  It is delicious and my husband and son loved it.  They loved the freshness of it and the chunky tomato bits.  The only thing I altered was using fresh basil and I sauted some vidalia onions to add.  Only because we are so onion crazy.  But this is really, really tasty, quick and easy.

Just wanted a quick sauce with ingredients I had.  Always wondered how much garlic powder it would take for a good garlic flavor.  I made it pretty close to recipe.  Added 1 tblspn of onion powder, dash of red pepper and a splash of Worchester sauce.  l keep this close at hand.

Chunky Italian Spaghetti Sauce Haiku: "This isn't 'chunky', would not cling to our noodles. Taste a '4', I guess." Maybe if it were tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, or stewed tomatoes instead of diced, it would've been more chunky, or if the recipe called for fresh chopped veggies such as onion, zucchini, mushroom, or dare I suggest, tomatoes, it would've been more chunky ... either way, this wasn't a chunky sauce BUT it was simple to make, and it tasted pretty good - ate ours w/ meatballs over spaghetti, but if I made it again it'd be drastically different and would no longer be this particular recipe.

Very good sauce.  I sautéed onion & garlic before adding other ingredients.  This sauce would be great on pizza too.

Very tasty! I used one 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, two 14.5oz petite diced tomatoes, and one 8oz can of tomato sauce and followed the rest of the recipe, except I added a little more of  the seasonings.  I substituted thyme for the basil, because I didn't have any, and I added about a tablespoon of cornstarch. I haven't made many homemade sauces, but this one  was the best one so far!

Made the recipe and used fresh basil, garlic, rosemary & parsley. Definitely wasn't what I would consider to be a chunky sauce but it had great flavor! I would follow another reviewer's suggestion of adding sliced mushrooms, chopped zucchini, etc next time to try and make it more chunky.
