I decided to make this recipe because I have never heard of it, and like to try new things.  I made a few adjustments after reading what others said.  I only used 1 cup of apple juice, eliminted the red dye,doubled the vanilla extract, and used half of a small bag of red hots.  It turned out good.  The cinammon flavor was right on, and it wasn't mushy at all.  I sprinkled the top with a little powdered sugar and cinammon and a dallop of cool whip.  You must love the taste of cinnamon to love this recipe.  Overall it was good, but because my family isn't a huge fan of cinnamon, I will only be making it for myself next time! :)

I love it!!!  but  I also put my own twist.. quadruple the red hots.. and added  3 atomic fireballs ( jawbreakers)  as I love the apple cinnamon taste..  I  remove from heat before the apples are tender because they have to sit to cool and will continue to soften, I, like the other reviewer don't want a mush pie. I'm sure you could also use the Lorans (tm) candy flavorings for the cinnamon flavor. I made mine a nice red with  gel foodcoloring. This pie is AWESOME  if I remember to take a pic  I will submit it. I Serve it with  whipped cream from the can.. TAS-TEE!!!!!

I couldn't keep my fingers out of it! yummy!!! And the scent filled up the house like a powerful votive candle. I made it for a prize at the cakewalk for my kids' school carnival, and it was a big hit! (I had a hard time giving it up, though!)

I did make just a couple of minor changes, but love this recipe!  I added more cinnamon candies and instead of sliced apples I diced the apples.  I used a can of cinnamon rolls flattened and placed in a pie pan then baked them and that is my crust.... can we say YUMMY!!!!  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe :D

Just so-so. I had to encourage my guests to try this because it's not the most appetizing looking pie Ive ever made. If I try it again, I would definately add more candies and food coloring to try and punch it up. Sorry.

What a heavenly smell while baking!!! I added extra candies and it was the best apple pie we've ever had. Will certainly make this one again.

I liked this and served it with Cool Whip and my friends really enjoyed it.  The only thing I felt it needed was more red hot's.

Great Christmas pie.  Don't overcook, as others have found out. I increased the red hots to 1/4 cup and used Cranberry-Pomegranet juice (a 1/2 cup less than called for) and added 1/3 cup sugar.  Serve with cool whip or whipped cream and some crushed green peppermints on top.

I should of read the reviews before I made this and added more red hots because it was not very good made just as the recipe stands.  It tasted like unsweetened chunky applesauce.  Even adding whipped cream on top did not help.  I've giving it 2 stars because my kids thought it was pretty good, but my husband and I did not like it.  We ended up throwing about 3/4 of it away.

I made this for a baking contest at work. Unfortunately it didn't win(not the pie's fault, I think the people were scared to try something different)

The changes that this recipe needs: More food coloring then called for, maybe a whole TSP. Also more apples, 5 Granny's just wasn't enough, next time I am going to try it with 7 and see how that goes. I like a big pie where the top of the pie is up over the edge of the crust or at least meeting it.

The filling had great flavor, I could have just ate the filling with a spoon it tasted so GOOD!!!!

Nothing to get excited about. With a bunch of Cool-Whip, it was OK, but I won't be making this again.

I made this pie with a few variations: I almost trippled the red hot candies, and I added a strusel topping of brown sugar, flour and butter.  I did not add food coloring, it didn't need it as the pie came out very pink colored with just the red hots.  My only problem with this pie was that it seemed more like chunky apple sauce in  a crust then a pie.  But the red hots were an interesting twist on the flavor.

It tasted alright, but my roommate doesnt find it too appealing; he hasnt even touched the pie. It's not a horrible pie, but it was kind of bland.

My family loved this pie and I loved that because it had very little sugar.
