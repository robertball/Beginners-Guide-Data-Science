I didn't have zucchini or mushrooms so I used asparagus and it was great!  I can't wait to try it with zucchini. Very versatile, could use any veggys you have.

This smelled so good as it was baking! I didn't use lowfat anything but regular strength and it was delicious. Made it for church and got really good reviews.
