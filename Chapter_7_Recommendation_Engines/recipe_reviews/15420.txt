I added just about 2 tsp. of maraschino cherry juice to this dip... pretty color and added a nice hint of cherry flavor... everyone loved it, especially with strawberries. The family is begging me to make it again!

I have been making this stuff for years and made it tonight to take to my neighbor's house for dessert.  I always do (1) 8 oz. package of cream cheese to (1) 7 oz. jar of marshmallow cream and beat together until smooth.  I then skewer fruit (cantaloupe, strawberries, melon, pineapple, etc.) on wodden sticks and serve.  It's light, refreshing, and great at picnics and bbq's.

Addictive!  Yummy...took this to a family BBQ as an appetizer, everyone just stood at the counter hovered over the bowl!  It was great, light, not too sweet, we all loved it.  Served with grapes and strawberries, can't wait for the honeydew and cantaloupe!

Having extra cream cheese and apples (from making cheesecake this afternoon) and some fresh strawberries that are normally used for my morning smoothie, I decided this would be a tasty, semi-healthy treat.  BOY WAS IT GREAT! Goodbye store-bought dip!  I too added some cinnamon and nutmeg! Great dip!!

This easy to make recipe was a hit at Father's Day.  Unlike store bought Marzetti's dip, doesnt leave an after taste.  Definately add this to your recipe box. Two thumbs up!

I don't know what to think of this? I didn't do the full amount because I wanted to try it out, so I made about 1 cup. I am glad I did, because it is way too sweet! It has a taste that reminds me of a melted cheesecake or something that would belong on a cinnamon roll, and not something I would really want to dip fruit in. I think fruit taste sweet on its own. I have seen other version made with whipped topping or yogurt that might just be more my taste. But, then again I like the taste of fruit plain or only slightly sweetened, so maybe that could be why I just did not care for this?

to make ur own fluff: 1 (6- or 7-ounce) jar Marshmallow Creme or Fluff = Gently heat 1 (16-ounce) package marshmallows plus 3 1/2 tablespoons light corn syrup. Gently melt in a double boiler, stirring constantly.

Great if you don't refrigerate - turns gelatinous

Its a great recipe, but the 2 jars of marshmellow creme is too much for me. I always have used 1 package of cream cheese, and1 jar of marshmellow creme. Also, by putting the cream cheese in the microwave for about 20 seconds, the texture comes out much smoother. I've also always added a bit of orage zest. Once the dip has set for about an hour, the zest really brings out the flavor and adds a little something extra to the mix. I've been making it since I was about 12, and its always been a favorite.

This is a great dip for fruit! I like to add a 1/4 tsp of vanilla and a 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. It gives it just a little kick of yummy flavor!

When I make this fruit dip and add fresh squeezed lime and ginger, I can't tell you how much people love it. I am not much into sweet dips like this so I just whipped it up because I wanted to serve some fruit at a party and the recipe looked easy. I was shocked at how many compliments I got! Since then I have taken it to family gatherings and always serve it at home when I have people over. I think people like the idea of the healthy fruit being on the menu, and then just can't help but try this dip along with it. It is the easiest thing to make and the one thing I have recieved the most compliments on.
The dip bowl empties long before the fruit is gone---everytime.

Simple, tasty--what more could I ask for in a fruit dip recipe?

I, like others, allowed the cream chese to come to room temperature before mixing, and added a smidgen of vanilla to the dip.  Though it was good with sweet (Fuji) apples, it was superb with Granny Smith apples.

I love this dip.  I have been using it for years and I was glad to see it on here.  Sometimes a tsp of vanilla works good in it.  Sometimes not, whatever I'm in the mood for.

Love this!  I've made this same recipe for years but with strawberry cream cheese.  The dip goes faster than the fruit!

I love this dip! I made it for a Christmas party so I added a little cinnamon to it. I liked it so much, I'm just going to add the cinnamon every time. I get tons of requests for it.

I have been making this dip for a long time, but instead of 2 jars of marshmellow, I do 1 jar of marshmellow creme, 1 package of cram cheese and 1 container of cool whip.  It makes it pretty fluffy!

This reciepe was great. The only thing is that I added 6 oz of vanilla yogurt. This way it's not so stiff. Other than that it's great and goes with every fruit.

I made this up for a sips and dips get together with friends and everyone liked it, including my college age boys who got into it after everone left. i gave this four stars isntead of five because I thought it was pretty good but not exceptional.  It was, however,  very simple to whip up.

Big hit!  Soooo easy, too!  Don't read this recipe quickly and not realize that it calls for *2* jars of marshmallow creme and have to go back to the store.  This happened to me.  :(  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This dip was a hit at my toddler's birthday party.  Both adults and kids loved it.  It's so easy to make too!  However, I did cut back on the amount of marshmallow I put in (less sugar is best).

My entire family loves this. I even have to make an extra batch just for my sister-in-law!  I've also used two 8-ounce packages of cream cheese instead of one. and a splash of lemon juice.  It makes it a little less sweet and slightly tangy, a great compliment to fresh, ripe fruit. A lower-fat version made with light cream cheese tastes just as good!

So easy to make and absolutely delicious. Will be hit at your next event. Use the strawberry cream cheese, 2 Tbs of OJ and cool whip for an added flavor

This was ok. I didn't do 2 jars of marshmallow as the directions stated. I read the reviews and only did 1 jar..next time I might do a 1 1/2 jars...the cream cheese was too strong.

This is SUPER sweet.  I recommend 1 jar of marshmellow creme.  We even dipped walnuts in it and it was great!

I've been looking for the main ingredients and the amounts to make this recipe. My sister-n-law used to make it for the family. It's true; you can't stop eating it! But she added nutmeg and little lemon juice to it. Delicious!

My co-worker recently made this dip for our pot-luck.  I have to admit at first when she told me what it was made of, I was reluctant to try it but it really is an amazing dip!  Everyone loved it.  Everyone wanted the recipe and she told us where she got it.  It’s not too sweet or tart.  This recipe is going into my file.  Thanks!!

I LOVED this fruit dip, and was so pleasantly surprised by the taste that the cream cheese and marshmellow creme made together.  My husband and I though, we have different tastes, and he thought this dip was just ok!  That amazed me and I could have eaten the whole thing, but whatever!  I think most people would love it, especially if you have a  sweet tooth.

Absolutely delicious - served with strawberries and bananas to my company and they couldn't stop eating it.  I did only used half the amount of whipped topping.

I've been making this one for years; however, try adding 1/2 to one teaspoon of cinnamon to the mixture.  You'll be amazed at the difference it makes.  Strawberries never tasted so good.

I LOVE this. The first time I made it, I accidentally used a 1:1 ratio and found the cream cheese flavor too strong, and had to add confectioners sugar until it was sweet enough, but the second time I got it right and it's amazing. Sweet, creamy, and perfect with fresh, local strawberries.

I've been making this dip for years with just one adjustment.  Once you're done mixing the marshmallow and softened cream cheese, fold in one regular sized container of Cool Whip.  It takes this fabulous dip to the next level!

We have been making this for years, my cousin first introduced us one Summer.
However I add either a squeeze of lemon juice or a tsp of almond extract, and only use one jar marshmallow cream.
And for us we traditionally serve with strawberries, bananas and Oreo cookies. Enjoy there are never left overs.

I've been making this for years. To add variety with differently flavors by adding powdered jello. The flavors are endless! You can also use the sugarfree Jello to cut calories. Just sprinkle Jello and mix. I usually start with a quarter of the Jello package. You can add more or less according to your taste, YUMMY!

Made as directed.  Was a great hit with dip and fruit as the only appetizer at a BBQ.  Those that didn't want the dip (not too many), just ate the fruit.

Served this at a shower and the guests raved about it.  I was afraid I was going to run out. SInce  then, I've shared the recipe many times. Could not be any easier and any more popular.  I served with fruit kabobs, cantaloupe, strawberries and pineapple chunks...but I think any fruit would do.

This stuff was soooo good!  The only thing I need to do differently next time is to make sure the cream cheese is all the way at room temperature because I had tiny chunks of cream cheese in it, but it was still so good!  I made this a second time, and I made sure the cream cheese was softened and I added a little grenadine for added flavor and to make it pink, which I think looks pretty.  Everyone always loves this stuff!

This is an incredible dip....I add a tablespoon of orange juice concentrate to give it an extra kick.  It yellows easily in the sun, so serve indoors or refrigerate between munchings.

My mom made this when I was a kid - I just never knew what was in it!  I could eat it all by itself it's so yummy.  Apples tend to disappear when normally my family doesn't eat much fruit.

This is awesome with strawberries(and by itself with a spoon!) I added a few drops of red food coloring to give it a pink look with the strawberries.

I took this dip to a baseball tailgate party and it was a home run!  All the kids and adults loved it!  It's very easy to make and tastes great with any fruits.

This is a really good recipe, but it is VERY sweet I went with some of the other reviews and did half the creme. Next time I would add some lemon juice to give it a bit of a citrus flavor.

This is so easy to make and super yummy!  Could easily add a little dry jello for a fruity flavor and color, but it's great just like this too.  My family loves it!

This is the best recipe.  I made it this weekend to serve with strawberries and I've got to tell you, it's 100% better than whip cream!  I couldn't stop eating it!  I have had another version where you add Smucker's carmel ice cream topping to the mix and it's good but just the cream cheese and marshmallow cream is even better and less work!

I love this recipe.  I started making it a few years ago to bring to a 4th of July party.  It is great with strawberries!  Yumm!  Now I am officially known as "Fruit Dip" by the kids who ate this all up and they always request I bring it to the party.

I've been making this since high-school.  Everyone loves it.  People can't beleive that it doesn't have more ingredients. I make it at every party and have to double the recipe.  I always serve this dip with strawberries only.

For years I spent way to much to buy this from the deli at the local supermarket, but everyone liked it so I did my duty.  Now I can get twice as much and spend half as much.

This dip is a great treat for toddlers! My two-year-old son isn't a big fruit eater but, like most toddlers, he loves to dip anything. I cut back on the marshmallow fluff so he isn't getting so much sugar! It's one of his favorite treats!
