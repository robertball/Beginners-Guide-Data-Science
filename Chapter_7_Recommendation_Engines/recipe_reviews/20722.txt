So simple and so delicious - especially in the summer!  I took this to a neighbor's house and the kids loved it (so did the adults)!  I skewered pineapple, strawberries, cantaloupe, red grapes and melon together on wooden skewers.  It makes a great presentation without a lot of work.  If you want to add a little flavor - add some flavored liquer to it or other extracts such as mint, orange, banana or coconut.

This was pretty good.  We had ours with apple slices.  I used almond extract in place of the vanilla.  Have made twice now and enjoyed it.  Thanks Pam.

This was tasty but was a lot runnier than I would have preferred.  That may have been my fault because I used FF cream cheese instead of regular.  I considered adding whipped topping to thicken it up, which I would probably do next time.

This is great!   An even better substitute for the vanilla is a shot of KAHLUA... try it you'll see!

this is very good--i used a whole container of strawberry cream cheese & it was REALLYY good!  i'm sure it would be equally good with the other various (sweet) flavors of cream cheese.

Ok..this has been a huge success. I take it everywhere when I'm expected to bring a dish. I made the dip with strawberry cream cheese instead of the regular and it really made fresh strawberries pop.

This is delicious. Made it for my sister's graduation.  I love the taste the vanilla gives to it.  I also added some orange zest to give it some color and a bit more flavor.  Definately a keeper, thanks for the post.

This stuff is the best for all kinds of fruit.  Add extra marshmellow if you are using strawberry cream cheese.

I've made a dip like this for years and I love it!  I've never added flavoring but I have made it with strawberry cream cheese in place of plain.  There's so many possibilities!  It's so yummy I've been tempted to frost a cake with it, but I'm not sure how that would turn out.

I just made this, and it's great!  I accidentally put a little more than three drops of vanilla, I poured a big splash plus some drops and it's great with extra vanilla!

I liked this recipe. It was quick and easy, which is especially nice when you're working on multiple projects. It stores and travels nicely and can easily be adapted to other flavor choices.
Thank you for submitting it!

My family went to a party and the lady who hosted the party had made this. It was love at first sight! ( The dip and I.) I came home and found this recipe. Thereafter, whenever we go to party's, we always bring this.  (It goes great with grapes.)

I add about 1 cup confec sugar to the mix and thin it with a splash of milk or half and half. Make sure you bring it to room temperature before serving or it will harden back into a block of cream cheese. This is very very good!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great, super easy, super quick recipe! I did add about two Tblsps confectioners sugar and a little extra vanilla. Yummy with fresh ripe pineapple!

All the reviews sounded so positive.  It just didn't work out for us.  I'm not sure how I could have messed this up - after all it is so easy.  I really wanted this to work out.  Maybe I'll try it again just to see if it comes out different.
