It is my opinion that if a recipe gives so many different results that it is probably not a very good recipe.  I tried this recipe as I was curious as to why so many had poor result and so many good.  I work in a bakery and I have to say that I tend to agree with the poor results side.  The recipe is definitely gooey.  Either the liquid is wrong or the flour amount is wrong.  I did not add the 1/2 C of cold water to the yeast.  I simply poured the yeast into the first liquid step when the temp. cooled down a bit.  This worked great.  I kept the flour amount about the same and also I kneaded the dough for 10 mins.   I think that there are so many other great recipes out there that work everytime and it would serve you well to find one of those, especially beginners.

Excellent rolls! I had to add more flour than called for. The next time I will make them bigger than walmut size. I also made some into cinnamon rolls. I like the dinner rolls better!

These were great!  I halved the recipe and got worried because it came out more of a batter than dough.  I made pull apart rolls with it.  They were spectacular right out of the oven!  And even the day after were very good.

I was looking for a recipe that most closely matched the one I grew up enjoying. I had misplaced my copy of the measurements. This on is truely a winner. I replaced; the warm water for warm milk, the cold water for warm water(which I used to proof my yeast). More flour was called for
but since I was used to light kneading of the dough, I used the additional flour in the kneadind process. I made this for my Xmas dinner & everyone raved so much about them. I am now about to try to use the recipe to make cinnamon rolls.  THANK YOU SO MUCH KATHY FOR SHARING!!

I have tried this recipe numerous times with excellent results! These rolls are light and fluffy...and make wonderful cinnamon rolls. My daughter says they are the best rolls she has ever tried and I agree! Thanks so much for the recipe.

I cut this recipe in half to get 18 rolls. I used my Kitchen Aid to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast in the mixer bowl with the sugar and warm water for ten minutes until the yeast "bloomed", then I added melted margerine, the egg and the dry ingredients. This dough needed 1 3/4 more flour than the recipe stated to get the dough into a ball and able to jump on a hook. I kneaded this dough with my dough hook for about five minutes  then I set it to rise for an hour in a large greased bowl covered with a tea towel on a warm heating pad for an hour. I used a 1/3 cup measuring cup to make uniform rolls and rolled them on the counter to make better shaped rolls. I got 11 smallish rolls out of this recipe, not 18. I covered the top of the rolls in the muffin tin with saran wrap before letting it rise on the warm heating pad for another hour or so. I baked them at 400 degrees for 12 minutes, then brushed the tops of the hot rolls with vegetable oil right out of the oven. These rolls rose a little slow but the flavor of the rolls was very good. I liked that this roll asked for no milk, no butter as I have a child with a milk sensitivity. I'd make these again--they remind me of rolls my Grandma used to make. No frills but comforting all the same.

These were really easy to make rolls, I made a half recipe, doubled the sugar and used butter instead of margarine and they tasted great although they were somewhat small.  I did also have to use more flour and I will definitely try these again!

These rolls seemed like they were straight out of a restaurant. I cut the butter to 5 tbs and they still came out good.

I see that a lot of users are having issues with this recipe. Without having actually tried this recipe I suggest not using "hot water." You may me tempted to use very hot water to melt the butter. I would melt the butter separate and even slighty cool it. From there, use warm water, hot water kills yeast and therefore the bread will not rise. The other thing I noticed was that the bread does not have a final rising time after being shaped. In baking, this is called a final proof. This allows the yeast to create gas and in turn, will rise the dough and when baked will be light and fluffy as expected. I am actually going to try this recipe tonight and I will update to let you guys know how it turns out. 



So I made the rolls yesturday and they came out just fine. Another thing, mix the salt with the flour (salt kills yeast) and I added the flour all at once and only used the warm water, the 2 cups of cold water would have definitely made a batter. The dough was a little sticky so I added about 1/4-1/2 cup more flour. Once the dough rises, the flour absorbs more of the liquid and because these are dinner rolls it's okay that they are a little tacky at first. A wooden table or cutting board dusted with flour makes the dough easy to work with. I will keep this recipe at 3 stars because the directions are misguided, and the amount of water is off to the amount of flour. If you follow these tips you'll have nice dinner rolls.

Mine turned out beautifully and while I followed the recipe I just wanted to add what I did differently.  It's crazy how varying the results have been!

I mixed the butter, water, sugar and yeast like the directions say, but I let the yeast sit for 5 minutes until bubbly.  I added the flour and mixed with the dough hook on my kitchenaid, then added the remaining 3 cups of flour for a total of 6.  I continued beating it until it changed from batter to kind of stretchy but it was VERY wet.  I transferred it to an oiled bowl and let it rise 30 minutes, punched it down (oil your hands, it's WAY wet) and let it rise another 30 minutes.  I punched it again and pinched out golf ball size hunks of dough and put them in a well greased cupcake pan and baked as directed.  I never kneaded it or added more flour, and they're gorgeous!  Good luck if you try this recipe, I gave it a 4 because if you have no idea how to make bread I could see where this could go horribly wrong!

This was my first time making yeast rolls.  We loved these.  I was surprised by the sticky batter but did not give in and add more flour.  I was glad I followed the recipe.  Per the picture and the advice of a few of the reviews, I did use a muffin tin instead of a 9x13 pan.  They baked beautifully.  For those who said they did not like this recipe, notice that they added more and more flour - DON'T DO IT!!  Grease up those fingers and dig in!!  Enjoy!! :)

I've been making yeast bread for over 30 years now.  This recipe isn't really for someone trying to make yeast rolls/bread for the first time, as it did require some tweaking.  Yeast bread dough isn't, as a rule, supposed to be so sticky you have to pour it like a batter. You should wind up with a ball of dough that is silken to the touch and springs back when pushed a little. I had to use about 8 cups of flour, give or take. After 30+ years, I know when a batch of dough will be good and when it will be crappy.  In this case, it will be a good batch.  I'm thinking perhaps the poster of this recipe is sort of like me: Most recipes are in my head & I have to show someone versus try to write it down as I don't really use traditional measurements. My cooking teachers were Old School Southerners, ya used yer eyeballs & yer hands, not measuring cups & spoons. So, I'm giving the poster a break, 'cause if I tried to write my recipes down, they'd need lots of tweaking and work, too. :-) Rule of thumb for this recipe? Not for newbies. Intermediate & Advanced bakers should know how to work around the glitches.  If not, well, ya need more practice!

Light, fluffy and lovely.  I was even a half tablespoon short on the yeast and they turned out great.  Made 12 large buns and a loaf too.  Can't wait to make them with the right amount of yeast.

It's the best home-made bread I've ever eaten!!!
It's fluffy and tastefull. I was actually looking for a whole-grain bread recipe so I added 2 cups whole-wheat and 3 cups white flour instead of the original recipe. The dough was a bit sticky and hard to give shape so I put some olive oil into my hand palms, that was really helpfull...

I'm a sucker for a good yeast roll (aka Lodge Rolls at the Whistlin' Jack Lodge in Washington State on State Route 410).  This comes pretty darn close in terms of flavor and texture.

Bakers unite!  Chins up! Aprons on! This recipe worked for me after all and was incredibly tender, light and delicious.  True, it was a sticky batter-like mess when it went to the first rise.  It looked bubbly and Swiss cheese-like when I took it out to punch it down the first and second times.  I also buttered the top of the glob while preparing it for the first rise which made removing the plastic wrap easier.  I DID add a little extra flour, perhaps as much as 1/2 cup for the full batch.  It was still very sticky and soft when it was time to form the rolls so I sprinkled flour on the countertop and used just enough to keep it from sticking to me.  I placed 18 rolls in a buttered glass baking dish and let it rise for a third time, about 20+ minutes before baking them.  They were sublime...rich and tender and Texas tall!  I will absolutely make them again and because they were so easy, I may just volunteer to make them for Thanksgiving this year!  And by the way, my husband asked me to pack up a bunch of them to take for his lunch to work tomorrow to eat with his homemade chicken soup!

The dough is very sticky. Had I read the reviews I would have known this. As it was I thought I had done something wrong. Don't add more flour or try to compensate for the stickiness. Just oil your hands and dig in. I am making more as soon as I buy more yeast. Please thank your mom for this recipe.

This recipe didn't work for me. I read the reviews where people had to add more flour, I thought maybe a cup or two, you would have to add 5-6 cups more flour to make this recipe successful. I hope that if you read my review you won't ignore it and try it anyway (which is what i did) don't waste your time, your money, and your flour.

I've made these four times now, and twice I've halved the recipe so I could make the dough in my bread machine. Like other reviewers, I had to add more flour, but it was just a matter of eyeballing it to see if it was the right consistency. I've received compliments every single time, and they've turned out to be great tasting and of medium density and texture, so this one's a keeper!

First, let me say, I like how the bread I made with this recipe turned out.  I also used half the dough for rolls.  That being said.  My rolls were not light and fluffy (still yummy though).  My bread loaf had no problem rising.  This was my FIRST attempt at making bread using yeast, so I called my mom.  After reading the recipe to her, she told me it would make a heavy bread. Also, the recipe never mentions to knead the dough (it says to mix it).  Had I not called Mom, I think it would have been a messy disaster. I will make a loaf of bread with this recipe again.  Still looking for a good dinner roll recipe, though. Oh, one hint to add from my mom...when letting the dough rise keep it away from any drafts or breezes and cover with plastic wrap.

I couldn't give this recipe any stars. I was sooooo mad at the money I wasted buying 2 packages of the yeast and all the extra cups of flour I had to add just to make it somewhat usable and then they tasted horrible and didn't rise. Never again. I will check the reviews before I try something like this again

Pretty good, needed a bit more flour, but most bread recipes are pretty variable.  Needed a bit more salt as well, but otherwise these came out pretty good.  Agree with Perigod, the recipe submitter probably didn't have an exact amount.  I'm of the old school of baking as well that you just add what "looks right" rather than some exact measurement - especially when it comes to bread! =)  You just learn how the dough "should" be, and aim to achieve that.  So yeah, not for beginners, but if you're able to tweak, it works.  And the baking time will vary by the size of your rolls, how many you are making, and of course your oven, so the 30-45 minute variation is to be expected.  Just keep an eye on it, when it looks right, its done. =)

These turned out horrible. I followed the recipe exactly- this didn't make dough- it made batter. I used it anyways. These were not light and fluffy- they were heavy and tasteless. I had to throw them out. Sorry, but this recipe is not for me.

I concur with most of the reviews written. This was my first time trying this recipe, and baking yeast rolls.  I followed the directions to the letter, and the dough didn't rise. It was gooey. I didn't add any extra flour or yeast.  The rolls didn't rise when I went ahead and baked them, either. They looked more like scones or biscuits than "light, fluffy" rolls.  When I think light and fluffy, I think of rolls found in places like Golden Corral.  I, too, may search for another yeast roll recipe.

This recipe is, by far, the worst recipe I've pulled from this site. These rolls are NOT light and fluffy, and they will NOT melt in your mouth. Twice I tried to this recipe today. Once I followed the recipe precisely as written, the second time, I allowed the rolls to rise for 45 minutes after they were placed on the pans to bake.  Both times I came out with rocks.

Great recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  It's great to have a recipe that doesn't call for milk, you see I have a child that is allergic to milk, so baking for him is a little challenging.  Loved these rolls.

I gave this recipe 4 stars, because with some tweaking, the rolls really did turn out fabulous, but I must say the dough is a pain to work with.  I halved the recipe, but still added the 1/3 cup of sugar, plus added about a tsp of cinnamon to make sweetened dinner rolls.  It takes probably one extra cup of flour to be able to shape them into rolls.  I stopped adding flour when the dough was still a bit tacky to the touch, then floured my hands to get them into balls.

I would not recommend this recipe for a beginning bread maker, but they do turn out wonderfully soft if you have the patience to try.

These really had good flavor, but they were too sticky to work with.  I tried using more flour to the dough, then the rolls weren't very good.  I hope someone can come up with a way to use this recipe where they aren't too sticky to work with as I really liked them.

I thought these were great!  I made "cheese buns" out of them.  After I made the dough and punched it down once I cut the dough in half and rolled half in the bottom of a cookie sheet.  Then sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese over it and then rolled out the other half and place on top of the cheese layer.  After that, I baked them as directed.  When they came out I cut them like brownies and serve them with soup.  They were a BIG HIT!  Try making "cheese buns" with them.  They're delicious!!!

I followed exactly and everything worked great except they only rose a little in the oven, those I made into balls first rose a little before I placed them in the oven so they looked better than the others, but overall did taste great.

This was my first time to make yeast rolls and I read all the reviews before starting and decided to follow the recipe as it was written, but did allow more rise time after I put them on the baking sheet.  WOW!  I am so glad I did not change anything.  We have BIG FAT YEAST ROLLS!

in the photo it shows the rolls in a muffin pan, not a 9x13 as stated in the receipe. That would account for using walnut size balls which you use 3 balls per muffin cup, that may be why some people say the rolls are too small. By making them a regular size roll they are delicious.

This recipe is horrible. I make bread all the time, but rarely ever rolls. I thought this looked alright, but stupidly didn't look at the reviews. I did all I could to try to make this recipe work out and it came out edible, but barely. It was so frustrating trying to get it to work! I'm never making it again!

Great tip about using milk instead of water. I also had same result of very wet dough, added ALOT more flour than the recipe called for.   TIP- after second rise, shape dough into balls and place inside of well greased muffin pans. Cover and leave in the fridge overnight. They will rise again, yield the perfect size roll and allow you to enjoy your rolls fresh from the oven when YOU'RE ready for them.

I made these rolls over the weekend for my family and I have to say Add a cup more flour or take away a cup of cold water. I added more flour and made the recipe using cupcake pans and also a loaf pan. They were pretty good.

I don't know where all the bad reviews come from. I used this recipe for the 1st time last September. From the 1st time I used it to the 7th time I used it. They come out as described every time. I've never had issues with the yeast, the dough rising, or the ingredients.

These have turned out great for me every time.  The dough is quite a bit sticky, but I work flour into them as I am forming them and let them raise a little more before baking them.  They always come out nice and fluffy that way.  I find that if I don't give them the extra raising time, they are heavy like my Gramma's rolls.  Either way, we love them.  I've also used this recipe for cinnamon rolls, raisin bread and pepperoni rolls.  It's trial and error for your desired results.

Turned out very runny, but when used in muffin cups, it was actually quite good.

Thanksgiving 2004 was going to be the year I made yeast rolls, well it was suppose to be. Some were in this you need to knead the dough,and maybe it would not be so gooey.

I'm giving this 4 stars because the rolls were good, but I did have to do some tweaking. As many reviewers mentioned the dough was extremely sticky. I halved the recipe (so it only called for 2 3/4 cups flour) and I still had to add almost a cup and a half of flour to get the dough to a point where it could be shaped. The dough rose and baked beautifully -- the consistency of the finished rolls was darn near perfect. The taste was kind of bland -- I think that next time I will do a slow first rise in the fridge to see if that helps the flavor. I wouldn't recommend it to a yeast bread novice, but for me, this recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing it!

These rolls are fantastic!!  I was nervous because the dough was very sticky, but they were just great.  I also used milk instead of the hot water.  Mmmmmm.  Thanks, Kathy!

These rolls were not light and fluffy.  They had a hard crust and were heavy.  Maybe it's me!  I was looking for rolls that are very light - not small loaves of white bread.  I will keep searching for a recipe!  Thanks!

Very tasty. Um... "I can't believe it's not butter". Couldn't resist... anyway, they really are quite good and it tastes like butter even if you use margerine.

I see people either did well or did not with this recipe. The reason for this is that the recipe leaves out a huge step. After you make the walnut sized balls with the dough- you have to let it rise again before putting into the oven. And for at least 30 min.

I made it both ways and if you let them rise again before baking, they will come out great!

I made this recipe today.  They are wonderful.  Yes, way to much liquid.  I just kept adding flour until I could knead it some.  I also used half cup of warm milk for the cold water.  I let it rise a total of 3 times.  Very light, and tasty.  They look wonderful as well.  I ended up with 20 rolls and 1 loaf out of this recipe.  Thanks.
Edit:
I remade this, and I again added way more flour.  I kneaded until it looked and felt right.. Let it rise only twice this time.  Then cut the dough into roll sized pieces.  Just shaped them and they were once again, wonderful.  I did try to make cinnamon rolls out of some of the dough, and they didn't turn out very well.  But for dinner rolls, and loaves, this recipe is wonderful.  :)

The dough was too soft to make balls out of so I realized I should have added more flour. I did that. They were delicious. I thought they would not be good without kneading but they were great!

I agree with the others in terms of needing more flour than the recipe called for a least a cup more of flour. I also used my kitchen aid mixer and think that it absolutely needed the extra flour in order to get the dough to the right consistency. I think that the walnut size was way too small for a dinner roll, so I suggest that you make them a little larger. Good flavor. I would make them again with the appropriate changes.

halved the recipe.  more like a batter.  definitely needs more flour than the recipe calls for.  we used about 3/4 cup more for 1/2 a batch.  taste was ok, not great.  will try again with modifications.

I found that the issues outlined by the majority of the raters proved to be true. The dough was sticky and needed substantial more flour. I also will use butter milk instead of the hot water when I bake the rolls again. That was what my mother used in her recipe. i haven't found anyone who could make the rolls as wonderful as she did. These rolls came close and with some tweaking I think I will have a winner. When it was all done, the rolls were delicious. I am so happy to have found this recipe. This year I will be making my mother's rolls for Thanksgiving. Thanks again.

I halved this recipe by changing the servings and followed it to a "t".  The dough was more like a batter. I kept following it exact anyway and ended up with what looked like a bunch of sugar cookies. They tasted ok, i really wish it would have been dough and made them roll like. Im very confused because i followed everything exact!  I gave one to my dog who loves bread and she threw up outside after dinner. Im going to keep searching for a new roll recipe!

Dough was very soft. Needed several more cups of flour to  be able to work the dough. When the right consistency was met the dough did not properly rise. I am an above intermediate baker, and would advise not using this recipie.

Something doesn't seem quite right. This dough is very very sticky. I had to add about 2 more cups of flour to stiffen it up enough to form into balls. Otherwise I would have had to POUR into muffin tins to hope to get rolls. I know how to cook and bake, so I doubt I made a mistake in measuring. Working on the first rise now. I will update again when I have the finished product.

I cut the recipe to 18 and had to add more flour, then more flour, and more flour to get the dough maleable enough to work with.  The rolls were very tasty, but I wouldn't make them again since I had to guess at the amount of flour.

These were great! I  cut the dough in halft and made monkey bread and the other half of the dough into dinner rolls and malasadas. The dough was very sticky so I added  an extra 3/4 cup flour.  Will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

use this recipe to make stuffed rolls. I halved the recipe and proofed the yeast for 10 minutes, plus let it rise a bit longer. I rolled out a ball of dough and added veggies, spices, and veggieburger. Wrapped it up and shaped it into a ball. I followed the baking intructions and it turned out great! Everyone loved it.

These rolls were pretty good but I didn't particularly LIKE them. The dough was like a nightmare! It took A LOT of flour to get the dough shaped into a ball and I almost gave up! When they were done baking you could see all the flour I had to use to shape on the OUTSIDE of the roll! Ihated to use so much flour but it was the only way to shape it! They tasted ok but I could taste the flour!

I made the mistake of adding more flour because, as the reviews said, the dough didn't look 'right' - wish I hadn't.  The rolls turned out heavy, like biscuits and we didn't finish them all, odd for a big bread loving family.  Ill try again, however, I chalk this up to learning, never made a yeast bread before.

Characteristics of the bread: Thin and soft exterior and an spongy interior.  Positives: It is very tasty and slightly rich. The interior of the bread is excellent considering there is no kneading.   Negatives: This is a very sticky dough.  Notes: This bread would make an excellent pizza crust.

I think that the recipe needs some finessing, particularly for those, like me, who aren't terribly experienced in breads. I added more flour, and could have probably used a lot more, also, I think there should be a recommendation to let the rolls rise again before baking. That being said, the flavor was AWESOME! These rolls, although they didn't LOOK great, were so delicious! It wasn't a problem as they were just for a regular home supper.

What I did different: I did not add sugar as the recipe called for mainly because I'm a diabetic and also because this recipe reminds me of my mothers that she made every thanksgiving when I was a kid. By not adding the sugar I'm sure it lacked a tiny something everyone else got out of it but I still find it delicious and it doesnt attack my blood sugars as badly lol very good recipe.

I tried to make these using proportions called for. However, I had to use more flour to firm up the dough. Taste was good and I am sure these will be attempted again.

The dough is gooey, I don't add the cold water to it.  It isn't the prettiest bread I've ever made but it sure is delicious!  Made it two days in a row.  I used it for hot dog buns, too.

They were not what I was looking for. They were a little tuff and not very soft on the inside. For a weekly meal they work fine but for a special dinner I would choose a different recipe.

1 star as written! I made this last week and it was perfect, I went to make it this morning and realized that last time I forgot to add the extra 1/2 cup of water. Well, I added it this time and NEVER AGAIN! I had a sticky, gooey mess that I had to keep feeding flour. I'd give it 5 stars without the extra water.

Like some others, I had to add 2 1/2 cups of extra flour to make a dough. Obviously the liquids have to be reduced somewhere. I use bread-machine yeast, which is not dry and doesn't have to be reconstituted in water. So, cutting that 1/2 cup of water and reducing the 2 cups to maybe 1 1/2 could do the trick? The two eggs and the 1/2 cup margarine have to be counted as liquids. The taste is not so bad and they rose quite well, though I added an extra teaspoon of yeast. Good try.

I made these "rolls" for Thanksgiving because I wanted a simple roll recipie this year.  I wish I'd read all the reviews first - they were terrible!  The only thing I did different was use butter instead of margarine.  I couldn't get enough flour added to the recipie and the batter rose to create a bubbly spongy mess that fell everytime i moved the bowl and had to be scooped with a spoon.  i left it to rise extra time hoping it would solidify into dough.  They came out of the oven flat, hard and tasted awful.  Definitely do not recommend this recipie.

I made these rolls for Thanksgiving this year and was not pleased at all!!! Like the others, they did not rise and they looked like biscuits. Were NOT "light and fluffy"! I followed the recipe exactly as directed. Will never make them again.

I would be very reluctant to even give this recipe a one star rating. It was undoubtly the worst recipe I have ever used.  I went by the recipe exactly as instructed.  It rose beautifully, both times.  When it was ready to make the rolls, I had to dip the batter out with a spoon and spoon it on to the pan.  I Let them rise again for about 45 minutes.  When the rolls were done they looked like "Big Cookies", but tasted like cardboard.

I had to add alot of extra flour like everyone else. They rose high in the oven, but they tasted more like a biscuit than a yeast roll. Easy to make.

Came out really gooy, so added more flour maybe that was a mistake, but didnt say it was suppose to be gooy, came out not soft but a bit hard outside soft inside. Was good though, made better loafs instead.

This is one of the best roll recipes I have ever tried.  My little boy calls it "the really good buttery roll" and begs to have them with every meal.  The muffin cups make it really easy, but I did roll them out a time or two, using just enough flour to make it workable in my hands, and they turned out fine.

The flour amount is WAY off and I should have followed my intuition and let the rolls rise in the pan before baking like any other bread, they are too small and heavy, dont waste your time on this one, it is a way off recipe.

I prepared exactly from recipe, 1st time ever making a roll from scratch. They were so light and fluffy and full of flavor. Directions were also very easy to follow for any level cook/baker or someone that doesn't cook at all. Thanks I will be enjoying this again.

My new go to for dinner rolls!  Great for high altitude.  Used butter instead of margarine.  The  dough was much more sticky than expected.  I floured my hands and got them rolled on the pan.  They were wonderful and baked in about 25 mins.

Had to add a lot of flour to get the dough to come together in a ball, then wound up with very dense rolls.

This recipe can't be used as written.  We had to rescue it after it turned out like pancake batter.  Even after adding flour we had to bake them in a muffin tin because they weren't firm enough to stand on their own.

I have to agree with other users. This recipe needs to be revised. If you are new to baking breads you should not use this recipe. The ratios are WAY off.  For once, I went against my gut to add what would have been over 1 cup more flour to get the consistency correct.  I wanted to see how making this to direction would turn out.  It was a big waste of ingredients!

The rolls tasted great, but the water to flour ratio was WAY off, I couldn't even keep track of how much more flour I had to use to make the dough usable. I think is you maybe halved the water and kept the flour amount it might work better... This is maybe try again recipe.

I really liked the taste of these rolls. Only thing that gave me a hard time is the very sticky dough. I followed the recipe and the other reviewers who did not add extra flour and got very sticky dough. It rose very well but even though I oiled my hands, I really couldn't give a shape (that much sticky dough). So, I use spoon for a half of dough, and I baked the other half in muffin tin.  They turned out very delicious bread rolls.

This recipe actually turned out great, but, only because I made a large amount of corrections. Firstly, never add salt before flour in bread recipes. Salt will kill the yeast and leave you with a doughy mess. Secondly, don't bother with the cold water step, you will slow the yeast (that being said, be sure that your water is only warm when adding the yeast, or, you will kill it as well). Lastly, more flour is required for this recipe. I am uploading 2 pictures, one showing the 5 1/2 cups of flour that the recipe calls for, the other showing what the actual consistency should be after adding all of your flour (mine came out to 7 cups, but, I was substituting a cake flour because it was what I had on hand, likely 6 1/2 cups of all purpose or bread flour will do).

It would've been really helpful to be told what to do, step by step, since it's mostly beginners looking for recipes. It was WAY too gooey, I didn't kneed it because I'm a first timer and didn't realize you had to, because it wasn't in the directions. I guess I'll read the reviews BEFORE I make something next time.

It's an awful lot of liquid for a surprisingly small amount of flour. Had to add a lot of flour to make a firm enough dough, and then it baked up into little stones.... Not sure I'd use this recipe again.

Love this recipe.  It was easy.  I knew I wanted to make cinnamon rolls so I added just a touch of vanilla before I added the last of the flour.  yum, so good.  My granny taught me to let yeast breads rise twice, so I couldn't resist and allowed them to rise again before placing them in the oven.  Great recipe

Excellent! This recipe is lighter and produces bigger rolls than the one I have been using these last 5 years. I think the difference is the second package of yeast and the addition of eggs. I did not use milk like my previous recipe either. My husband and son really noticed that these rolls were different than my others. I also do not believe in the cold water....just added a little more warm. Thank you!

I love this, the best recipe I have tried thus far.  I needed a bit more flour but other than that, EXCELLENT! They are so light and fluffy, I added fresh and dried herbs on different occasions and they still are perfect.  Thanks so much Kathy.

I tried this recipe for the first time (supposed to have made them for Thanksgiving 2013).  I'm glad I didn't because, like others have said previously, it definitely needs more than 5 1/2 cups of flour, maybe 6 ups, especially with 2 1/2 cups of liquid.  The dough rose beautifully, twice.  So I used flour to roll each one prior to placing them in the pans.  A dense, chewy roll if you like rolls with a dense texture.  Good flavor, browns very nicely.  Will definitely make again.

Something is messing, there look good but the taste is off. This is a basic yeast rolls recipe. I added more flour, used butter instead of margarine. I will use it again, but I will use more yeast, flour, more sugar. Or a better recipe that use more flour. This is only a basic recipe with many flaws.

This is a really nice recipe for yeast rolls.   I would definitely not recommend baking for more than 30 minutes though if using something besides a cookie sheet.

The baker in me knew that there was not enough flour in these for my liking. I added around 3/4 to 1 cup of additional flour in the kitchen aid. They were still a bit sticky but flouring the hands helped. I also let them rise the third time after forming the dough into balls. They are quite lovely with a bit of tweaking.

These rolls were tender and tasty.  I used bread flour and brushed with melted butter after baking, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Mine were not as pretty as the ones pictured, but they were very good.  I will make these often.

These roll were AMAZING! I made them for my family and they all asked me for the recipe. I put the oven to 450 degrees and put them in for 9 minutes. I put a little slice of butter in the middle of the roll before I put them in the oven, but other then that they were amazing!

These definitely came out with more of a biscuit texture and feel for me, so I must have done something wrong, flavor was still delicious! The bread held and the roll itself was very good. 5 stars!! Hopefully I can follow directions a little better next time :/ lol

It was a Total failure!!! I read the reviews about the flour and it was really wet dough.  I held off adding to much more flour and they did not rise and came out dense and a mess.

I tried this today using my new Kitchen Aide Mixer.  The dough was so gooey.  I added at least 1 additional cup of flour.  Not sure what else to do, so I poured it into loaf pans instead of making rolls.  It smells wonderful and has risen beautifully in the oven, but not sure it is a roll recipe!

Batter was sticky like everyone says, but these rolls were very good.  My kids loved them and even had them for breakfast the next morning.  I used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour.  I think a little more salt would make them even better.

I made this for thanksgiving. Followed the recipe fairly well; well actually I used butter instead of margarine and I made them a little big. The first fermentation took forever and by the time they were ready to bake my family had already eated. In the end they were heavy and I need more flour to keep them from sticking to my hands and I still ended up with club hands. The rolls tasted very yeast and were of all shapes. Oh well, guess I'll do better next time.

This receipe does not work.  When you read the ingredients it calls for 5 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour.  Then in step # 2 it says add 3 cups flour and then it says add eggs and 2 1/2 -3 cups of flour.  Also it ways to cook for 30-45 minutes.  Receipes should be exact.  I had a huge mess and was so disappointed.

I will admit this was my first time trying to make rolls from scratch. However, I had to add a TON of flour (after rising twice) to get a consistency that wasn't soupy and would hold long enough to get into the pan. Other reviewers seemed to have a similar problem, so maybe it's the recipe. They basically came out really dense and a little dry. But pretty good with butter and jam!

As far as taste goes these are great! I had a few problems though.  The dough was really sticky, not able to make balls out of it, next time I may add a little more flour.  It rose up really well both times but while baking did not.  Maybe it was the humidty in the house or something, not sure, but I am def. gonna try it again.

I don't know how anyone could complain about this recipe, it was easy for me and I'm not a really good cook!  Never made rolls before. I liked the ones that I put in a flat pan vs. the muffin pan.  My cinnamon rolls weren't that good, they were flat.  I will try making them on the first rising next time and using more dough.

I used a stick of butter instead of margarine and honey instead of sugar.  The dough was very moist, but not that hard to handle.  I used a scoop to measure out the portions for the pan, but found there to be way more than I could fit in one 9x13.  Spacing them a little closer together works best, as mine tended to spread more if they didn't butt up against another roll.

I baked these rolls for christmas dinner.  They were gone!  I think it is great!  Yes, a little sticky. . .just add  a little more flour to it.  If you are familiar with putting bread together it is no problem.  I am baking some more right now!  I had lost my other favorite, this has become my new one!  Thanks for submitting it.

These rolls were great. I used this recie as my first try ar yeast rolls. Needless tosay, it was easy.  The dough was quite stick, so I was worried for a moment.  The second batch that had a chance to rise a third time while waiting to go into the oven were much lighter, fluffier, and looked just like the photo.

Worst bread I have ever made.  I am a well experienced baker and cook, and I did not care for this recipe.  Makes me mad that I wasted so much of my bread machine yeast on these!  They are heavy, and dough is way too gooey as written.  Had to add too much extra flour just to work with it.  Keep searching...

no stars. I have tried this recipe two times in the past two days and they have been hard rocks both times. I had to add flour just to work with the dough and they were still gross. I think the only place for these to be eaten would be communion.

I had to add lots of extra flour to make this dough managable.  The rolls were fairly bland and I had followed some of the advice of others to add a bit more sugar.  
These did not raise as much as I would have liked.  I will probably not make this recipe again.

These were OK. More flour is needed to form rolls. More like a yeast biscuit than rolls but were fine with stew on a cold night. I'll tweak it a bit if I make them again and will double the sugar. Easy enough to make though.

Terrible recipe.  By the time you add enough flour to make dough workable, you end up with a dry yucky "bread thing".  Very disappointing to say the least.  Didn't cook into a very pretty bread.  Hard and flat.

This recipe is a great one.  A little longer than most but well worth the results.  The dough will be gooey but follow directions and you will be rewarded with a big soft dinner roll.  I rolled out the dough before baking and spread butter and rosemary, then rolled up and cut.
