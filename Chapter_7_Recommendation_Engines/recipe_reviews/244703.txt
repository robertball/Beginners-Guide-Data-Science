I prepared this as written with white quinoa, and will make it again in the future.  It was easy to prepare, and dh enjoyed it.

What is the goal of this recipe? Honestly this recipe is for people who have no taste buds. Too many strong flavors and not enough actual flavor. No thanks. I’ll take my quinoa without the marinara and peas.

Nice concept and I had everything on hand but the quinoa didn’t cook up right at all. Had to add more water to it. If I did it again, I’d cook everything separate but then the dinner wouldn’t have the benefit of “one pan dinner”
