OUTSTANDING! You definitely DO NOT need a bread machine for these. (Click on the picture to see the photo I submitted). Simply combine the water, yeast, and sugar and allow to proof. Then add the salt, then flour and knead until no longer sticky. Place in an oiled bowl and allow to rise according to recipe instructions. I rolled my dough out like others and made 2 baguettes. I really think I'll make 3 baguettes next time because I use mine for sandwiches and they were a little too big. After baking, I cut the top off the whole length of the baguette so that the top looks like an upside down triangle (like they do at Subway). This leaves me with a bottom piece that is concave in the middle. I then put 2 pieces of provolone cheese and then top it with Holiday Chicken Salad (this site). I put the filled bottom piece in the oven by itself for about 7 minutes. Then I put mayo on the top piece, and place it in the oven with the bottom piece, and I let it heat for about another 5 minutes or so. It's GREAT!!! The bread is slightly crusty on the outside, moist and soft on the inside....a far cry from those chewy store-bought baguettes. This one's a keeper for sure. Oh, and they freeze well, too. Thanks so much for sharing this one!

This is an excellent recipe for French bread/baguettes.  I use my KitchenAid and follow standard  bread making procedures.  TIPS/TRICKS for French bread I've learned over the years:  Do NOT add the salt with the flour.  Combine the flour with the yeast mixture and knead for 5-7 min (in mixer).  Remove dough hook, cover work bowl and let sit 15 minutes.  THEN, sprinkle salt evenly over the dough and knead again until the salt is well incorporated.  Set aside in warm place (85°F) until doubled in size...  proceed with shaping dough as desired.  For those who prefer a more crunchy crust, use only egg white for brushing the loaf - and throw 1/4 cup of water onto the bottom of the oven (avoid heating element if you have an electric oven) - immediately place the loaf in the oven and bake as directed... the water will create steam and gives the bread a crispier crust.  When I prefer a soft crust, I whisk a whole egg (not just the yolk).   Also, bread is typically ready when an instant read thermometer inserted into the bread registers 190-200°F. For bread sticks omit brushing the dough with egg.  Delicious!

I am a VERY picky person when it comes to bread. I lived almost all my life in France and I tried many baguette recipes, but this one is the closest to the real thing I could find. It is not 100% the same, but that's probably because french bakers use a special oven for the baguettes. It was GREAT! CHANGES: I don't have a bread machine, so I used normal yeast (same amount) mixed with water and sugar and set aside until foamy. Last time, I used 2 cups all purp. flour, and added whole wheat until dough was ready.

French bakeries bake their bread at extremely high temperatures with humidity. Put a bowl of water in the oven for humidity, and bake bread at 450 F to get a nice crispy, chewy crust.  After 15 minutes of baking, remove the water and bake bread an additional 5 minutes.  I omitted the eggwash...just a personal preference.

Excellent!  Easy to make and roll out.  The only thing I did differently is to brush egg whites on top instead of egg yolks...this gave a nice crunchy crust.  Will definately make again!

This bread has a great texture and flavor. However, I share others' opinion that the crust was not as crunchy as I would have liked. Also, I found the dough to be very sticky and not easy to knead by hand, something to keep in mind for us old-fashioned/technology-impaired folks. To sum up, it's tasty but I will keep looking for the perfect baguette recipe.

Too sticky. Needed to use 3 cups of flour.  BUT, then this makes the BEST French bread ever.  I do not roll out, just shape and bake.  YUMMY!!

Excellent baguettes!  Made them for company and the bread got devoured in a flash.  I forgot to brush on the egg yolk mixture as I was putting it in the oven after my supper was made and I was in a hurry to have everything ready.  Came out excellent - the crust was very crunchy.  I have noticed in some of the reviews that the crust was not crunchy, I guess not putting the yolk mixture on top was the reason for it!!!  This bread made a thick crunchy crust and the inside was a great texture.  Not airy.  Was a very big success at my dinner party.  Enjoyed by all.  Thanks for the great recipe Judy.

Having never made Baguettes before, I was amazed at these results...and the time it took to produce them from start to finish was equally amazing! I made four 8" loaves from one batch and ate one in it's entirety directly upon removing it from the oven....the crust was crispy on the bottom, chewy on the top....simply irresistable!! Perfect to eat directly from the oven, and wonderful for sandwiches the next day. :)

This is a great baguette recipe.  Made it this afternoon to use for crostini for dinner.  Super easy, and nice crispy crust.  Followed the recipe exactly except for the egg yolk/water wash on top.  I misted cold water in the oven several times the first 8 minutes of cooking.  This is my first attempt at baguettes, and this is the recipe I'll keep.  No point in looking any further.  Thanks, Judy!

First of all I would like to thank you for this recipe.  Simple ingredients, simple instructions, and if you follow the directions simple to make.  The most important thing is that the bread is fantastic.  While I did not expect to get the real french baguette, this is the next best thing.  It is the closest you can get without the equipment used in a bakery to make the traditional.  Will make this over and over again.  Great taste and texture.  Will have to double the recipe the next time because the bread disappeared tooooo fast.

I make this in my KitchinAid. I dump all the ingredients in, water last, and let it run on med-low for about 15 min. with a dough hook. I've made this dozens of times and it has always taken 3 to 3 1/2 C. of flour to get the right texture. This is the only recipe I use for French bread now! It's SO simplie and my family loves it!

Cannot believe how easy this! Did not roll into rectangles; merely shaped into 2 loaves and they turned out perfect.  Used a packet of regular yeast and made by hand from the start by mixing the warm water with the sugar and yeast and allowing to foam for about 20 minutes before mixing in the flour and salt.  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was fantastic! I also used my Kitchen Aid mixer. Heated the water, dissolved the sugar and water in the mixing bowl. Added the yeast ans let it sit for about 5 minutes before adding the salt and the flour. Mixed unti dough came together and then mixed on low for 3-5 minutes. Let rise in oiled bowl for 1 hour, shaped into two loaves on cookie sheet and then let rise again for about 40 minutes. brushed with egg whites and baked for 20 minutes. PERFECTO.

this is an extremely easy and economical recipe to make. great warm as advertised. only one change i would make (and have). use egge white, not yolk to crust up the top. and after you coat with egg white, you may coat with such items as garlic salt, kosher salt, rosemary or enjoy plain.  an instant family favorite.  thank you!!

Very simple, very good... excellent for fresh sub sandwiches.  When I read the list of ingredients I automatically assumed the yolk was for the dough and the egg whites would be reserved for the glaze.  So I dumped in the yolk before I realized that the yolk is the glaze.  The bread came out sooooo good that this is how I make the dough now out of fear that it will not turn out as good.  I read comments in here that said they found the bread heavy and very dense, and because I wanted a lighter sandwich bread, I barely handled the dough at all (I didn't punch it down).  I also found it very easy to get large logs of bread, so I now make this into 3 loaves.  My bread machine takes a total of 2 hours to finish the dough, so I also skip step 2, and find the dough so nice that I don't give it much time to rise once formed.  Thank you very much for this excellent recipe.

This is fantastic!  This dough also makes the closest knock off to Olive Garden breadsticks, ever.  Just divide the dough into 12 sections, roll into cigar sized pieces.  Place on greased cookie sheet.  Let rise for 1 hour (do not add egg wash on top) and bake for 12-15 minutes at 350.  Top with half melted butter, half olive oil spread and lightly sprinkle with garlic salt.  Yum... tastes just like 'em!

These were delicious and so easy to make!  I made them yesterday and everyone liked them so much I had to make more today.  ****I'd like to point out that bread machine yeast is interchangeable for the "Rapid Rise" version only.  If you use the regular active dry yeast, you'll need to warm your water to 110 degrees.****

great recipe. I don't use a bread machine and it tastes great.  When I make it I usually take one loaf and make the rectangle. I then fill it with melted butter, cheese, garlic, and pepper. Then I roll it up and sprinkle it with sea salt.  It's really really good.   For the other loaf I make three "ropes," glaze each one with the scrambled egg, roll in cinnamon and sugar, and braid to bake a great sweet baguette.   I would highly recommend trying this

Excellent. Changes: I made these completely by hand. Combine the yeast and sugar with the lukewarm water (about 80-85 degrees F) and let it sit there, allowing it to "proof" for 5-10 minutes. The yeast/water/sugar mixture will look frothy when it's proofed. Pour the yeast/water/sugar mixture into the flour and salt. Mix it with your hand until all the dry parts are moistened, then knead on a clean floured surface.  Some people say to knead for 10 minutes, other people say to knead 850 times.  Let it rise about 30-60 minutes until doubled, then punch down/flatten the dough with your hands.  Cut dough in half with a pizza wheel and form into two baguettes.  Allow it to rest/rise again and then cut slashes into it right before you put it in the preheated oven. I skipped the egg wash.  I also threw some ice cubes/ water into the bottom of the oven to create steam right before I put the baguettes on the preheated baking stone.  The moisture in the oven helps for some reason.  Delicious!! You definitely don't need to use an electric mixer. I think making it by hand is a good stress reliever.

Also.... let it rest after you bake it for a minimum of 20 minutes.

Very nice tasting bread. It was a bit tough, but that may have been my fault.

Very tasty! Easy to make. I always double the recipe (just double the ingredients and set to "2lb loaf" if you have that setting on your machine), because this bread disappears *so* quickly! 

Really yummy with butter and jam, perhaps a little too yummy ;-)

I rate the ingredient ratio 5 stars but the cooking instructions a 2.  If you want a bakery-worthy baguette that's crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside follow the advice of another reviewer. Make the dough with the bread flour, salt, sugar, yeast, and water as instructed. Form the loaves by hand (I make 2 baguettes) then let them rise an additional 30 mins. But then DO NOT brush them with egg and water and cook at such a low temp. Gross! Instead, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F with a bowl of water placed at the bottom of the oven. Cut diagonal lines across the top of the bread, then place the sheet with the loaves on the top rack and bake for 15 mins, then remove the bowl of water and bake for an additional 5 mins. Perfection!!!

Instead of making two baguettes, make one big loaf of french bread.  A great recipe, just like you would buy at a bakery.

Easy to make and delicious.  I used my big KitchenAid(R) mixer, first mixing dry ingredients and then adding the water (120*F).  Proofing and raising times were quick and at high altitude, only bake it for 20-22 minutes. Voila!  Hot, crusty and fabulous.  You'll never buy it from the bakery again.

I made this bread as one large loaf and used it as the base for French bread pizza. My husband and I ate almost the entire loaf in one sitting! It is a great bread, and turns out much better coming out of the oven than the bread machine. Delicious!

My family are crazy about this bread.  After it was bake we split the loaf, spread it with garlic butter, parmesean cheese and mozzerella cheese.  Then I wrapped it in foil and put it on the BBQ
Thank you for the great recipe!!!!!

I made 4 smaller baguettes to use for lunches. My bread machine does 2 risings so formed the baguettes as soon as the dough came out of the machine and then let them rise again. Planning on making them again today. Thanks.

I'm going to blame the failure of this recipe on my yeast.  I thught it was fairly fresh, but my dough was very sticky and the bread did not rise.  The flavor was great, so I'm going to try it again.

Texture was great, nice flavour, but it made just a wee little loaf. Next time I would probably at least double, and maybe even tripple it to get a nice long french loaf shape. Very good anyway though :)

Fantastic recipe! I made this for a Christmas dinner at a friend's house. My husband convinced me to just buy dinner rolls & a baguette but I still wanted to try my hand at making my own. I couldn't find any bread flour (it was Christmas eve) so I had to use all purpose. Other than that, I followed the recipe (omitting step 2 as my bread machine incorporates the first rising time). I followed the directions in the article on forming baguettes that I found on this site and I misted the oven with water 3 times in the first 8 minutes of baking. I also brushed one baguette with the egg yolk mixture and I brushed the second with an egg white/milk mixture (I figured, why not, I've got the whole egg anyway). I really am not sure which one is better as the bread was devoured before I had a chance to try both ways! It was a huge hit at the dinner. We still ended up taking the store bought dinner rolls and baguette but no one even bothered with those! They all raved about the bread. I'm making this recipe for the 3rd time in 3 days. It's so incredibly easy and my very picky husband says it's better than store bought! I highly recommend you try it - even if you don't have bread flour (although, I can't wait to try it with bread flour to see how much better it is!) Thanks so much for a fantastic recipe!

For some reason, baguettes are impossible to find ever since I moved, and I was ecstatic to discover that I could make my own! Normally I always find some way to tweak or "improve" a recipe, but this is the first that I have followed one verbatim multiple times, and still do not feel the need to alter it in any way.  They are delicious, have a crispy exterior and soft interior, and I always have to double the recipe if I expect to feed the whole family and not just me & my husband!  If you have any left the next day, it makes THE BEST garlic bread (spread butter/vegetable spread across a split loaf, then sprinkle garlic powder & parmesan cheese & bake in a 350 degree oven until browned).

to make your bread even more professional looking, take care to slash your loaves at a very steep angle (about 30 degrees).  I always tell my students slash  (as if looking at a clock) from 10:00 to 4:00. You'll be amazed at the results

This recipe is excellent!  I made the baquettes today and they are wonderful.  My husband thought I had been to the bakery.  I didn't do the egg wash, but I did mist the oven three times in the first eight minutes of cooking!  Yum!!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This bread is simply the best recipe I've ever tried. I agree that the name is a bit  of a misnomer, because they're not true french baguettes ... however, it does make it easy for people to find the recipe. Now when I made it, I don't particularly like egg-washed crusts, so I brush butter on mine just before they're done baking. Fresh from the oven, this was amazing with strawberry preserves ... and the next day, it provided the best french toast I've ever eaten, as well as homemade garlic bread at dinner. When I cooked this bread those ways, the outter crust edge got so delightfully crispy and buttery it tasted almost deep-fried. (Not even a little bit healthy, but what an indulgent treat!) I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone, even a novice bread maker, for its ease. (Note, DO use bread flour, it makes a difference!)

A BIG hit for meatball sandwiches.  Was my first time using dough setting on machine, was so easy, I am making again today for sub sandwiches.  Would love to know how to double it in the machine.Highly recommend!!

Great Baguettes!   I can't stop making these as these are so good. It is a weekly staple for us and I like at least one of these in the freezer to have on hand at all times. To make it crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, you need to mist it with water every 5-10 minutes. I mist it as soon as I put them in and then every 5-10 while baking. I also put a pan of water in the oven to make steam while baking with about an inch of water in it. That is the secret to making crisp crust with soft centers. You can sprinkle with different toppings also before baking to change it. Hope you will try this if you like true baguettes.

This is a great recipe.  I made it with an italian beef recipe I also found on this site. http://beef.allrecipes.com/AZ/SlowCookerItalianBeefforSa.asp  June, I think you might have a bread machine like mine.  It incorporates a rise cycle into the dough cycle which means we get to skip step 2. :) Maybe yours was extra heavy because it sat for too long after the yeast was activated, but I've made it 3 times now and I haven't gotten a very light or fluffy bread.  This is supposed to be a nice, dense sandwich bread.

First attempt at making french baguettes and it turned out wonderful.  I don't have a bread machine, so I did all the kneading and let it rise.  The crust turned out crunchy, however, the bread was a little dense, but I think I didn't let it rise enough, so I'll try again.  Other than that, it tasted great!

It is now 9 p.m. and I made the first batch at 4:00 p.m..  I've been making batches hourly (now on my fifth batch).  My husband, 11-year-old son, 20-year-old nephew keep scarfing these up as soon as they come out of the oven. Everyone has glazed eyes and says this is the best bread I've ever made.  Now that I am becoming an expert in such a short time, I can add some advice.. My first batch was really crunchy on top. I added a little pan of water that was almost full. That really added a lot of the crisp. The water kept going done in subsequent batches and the crust was softer -- just a bit different.  All of the batches have been fabulous consistently. BTW, used outdated yeast that had been in the fridge for too long (like 12 weeks too long, hidden behind mayo). In any case, thought I would try it. Proofed the yeast and it has worked great so far. Not saying I would recommend it, but this recipe makes such small portions that it is a good test batch for expired yeast... Thanks for the recipe!

I made w/o a bread machine & it turned out great!  Just proof the yeast in the water & sugar until foamy.  It was really easy & I've never baked yeast bread before.  Used an egg white on one loaf & yolk on the other.  Maybe next time I'll try a mix.

These baguettes are freakin awesome! Until today I was a bread-making failure but these were really easy. I don't have a bread machine so I just disolved the yeast and sugar in the warm water and let it sit until frothy and then just mixed with the rest of the ingredients. Kneaded it until smooth, followed the rest of the directions and bam! Bread success! Thanks so much!

Well, 5 stars because these turned out great.  Baguettes are perhaps nothing "special" but it's neat making them at home in such an easy manner!  I could not get 16" out of the dough, but I got two goodsize loaves anyways.  If you don't have instant yeast use 2 tsp regular, it will work but needs a bit longer rising.  Don't over bake these, and they'll be wonderful!  (BTW my bread machine INCLUDES first rise time in its dough cycle, so I skipped the first rise period in the recipe.)

I have made this recipe twice this week, it is THAT yummy! I love the soft texture of the bread and the flavor is really nice. I mixed it by hand both times (proofing the yeast with warm water and sugar, then mixing in the flour and salt).
The first time I made it, I used the egg wash on the outside. The second time, I doubled the recipe, used half for pizzas (decided that last minute- kids loved it!) and the other half for loaves. This time, I omitted the egg wash and I brushed melted butter on the loaves after baking. Very yummy! I loves it both with the egg wash and without.
This is a great, simple recipe & I will make it over and over again.
The only thing... I don't know how well it keeps... it hasn't lasted long enough for us to find out!

**EDIT**
I made this recipe again this week. I know, I need help! lol. This time I doubled the recipe and shaped the dough into 12 rounds for buns. They turned out great. I used them for pulled pork sandwiches. They were a hit with the whole family!

I don't know why I waited so long before trying this recipe!  I guess I was intimidated, but it proved to be a very easy recipe to make.  I let the dough rise in the bowl for only about 15 minutes before realizing that it had already risen in the bread machine.  So, I went ahead and made the loaves, then covered and let rise about 45 minutes.  I didn't do the egg/water wash.  Intead I put a small bowl of water in the oven and misted the bread about 4 times within the first 10 minutes of baking.  This bread had a crunchy crust and a soft center.  Perfection!

VERY GOOD!!  I did not do anything in my bread machine I did it the old fashion way.. water, yeast, sugar in a bowl let set about 10 min. then added flour and salt mixed together to form ball then kneaded it 15 times or so.. put in greased bowl let rise and then I punched down like recipe said. then put into loafs and let rise again. I made three mini loaf's out of one batch and then another batch 1 large french loaf and made garlic bread with that.. I got the so many compliments from the bread everyone loved it made into garlic bread!

This is the absolute best bread recipe! I proof my yeast, water, and sugar for 10 min., add the flour and knead in my mixer for 5 min., let it sit 10 min., sprinkle the salt in and let it rise in an oiled bowl for 30 min. It smells and tastes like heaven!  Thank you...our family loves this bread!

I am an experienced challah baker.  This recipe was super easy, very little mess, and came out perfectly.  I do not have a bread machine.  I put the yeast and sugar in Kitchen-Aid mixer bowl, added 110 degree water, let proof for about 10 mins.  Added the bread flour, kneaded for 6 mins on the dough hook, pulled off dough hook, let sit for 15 mins covered in lightly oiled bowl, kneaded in 1 tsp kosher salt, then let rise as directed from there.  They look great.  I will definitely make these again for sandwiches.  4yr old went nuts for them.  Next time I will definitely double the recipe, the 2 baguettes were on the small side.

i give this a one star because, not crust, texture is too soft, cheaper than a baguette that's 2 weeks old. Poor quality, and i stand to these rights even tho u all rate it a 5 star.

This is an authentic baguette recipe, thanks for sharing it.

The only thing I changed was to brush the top with strong black coffee, not egg yolks, egg whites or egg wash, as it is done in original French recipes. Coffee is the traditional way to receive a crunchy, flaky crust.

This is great, but no need for the egg wash, which isn't traditional.  Just place a bowl of water in the oven and bake at higher temps (450 degrees) for shorter period of time, to get the crispy, crusty exterior.

Altered this a bit, don't have a bread machine.  

1 1/2 cup water
1 1/2 cup ww. flour
2 1/2 cup bread flour
1 tsp salt
2 tsp yeast
1 egg yolk
1 tbsp water

Added water, bread flour, sugar, salt in mixer and mixed on speed 2 for 2 minutes
Switched to dough hook and added ww. flour 1/4 cup a time... once incorporated.
Kneaded for about 10 minutes on a floured counter.

Rest stays the same!  Lovely bread, crispy on the outside, soft  and light on the inside.

My husband and I have made this recipe several times now and it always comes out great. We sprinkle the bread with kosher salt after we brush it with the egg wash and the crust comes out cripsy and salty, delish! My only complaint would be that it doesn't hold very well, after two days the texture really suffers, so use it the day you make it, then use leftovers for french toast or bread crumbs.

I made this without a bread machine and with fantastic results.  I would mark it 5 stars based on how it turned out, but I did need to add oil to the dough in order to make it pliable and workable before it's first rising.  I probably added about two and a half tablespoons of oil while kneading the dough.   I proofed the yeast by combining the sugar, yeast, and warm water together and letting it sit for ten minutes.  I then added it to the flour and salt and mixed.  I added 2 1/2 tablespoons oil while kneading.  Let it rise for 1/2 hour, punched it down and followed the rest of directions as written.  It turned out perfect!

Very Good. I almost didn't try it out because I don't use bread flour, bread machine yeast, or a bread machine. I used all the typical ingredients, regular flour and yeast. I used my kitchen aid mixer and it turned out. As I would in other yeast breads, I made sure the water I used was warm, the recipe didn't specify. I also took the advice from a previous post that said to use egg whites, not the yolk, and to steam the bottom of the oven with some water. will absolutely make this again.

These are delicious if you make them right.  It should note that most bread machines have proofing built into the dough cycle, so you dont' need to let the bread rise twice after taking it out of the machine.  The first time I did this and the bread was ruined.  The second time, I just shaped them and let them rise once out of the machine, and they are PERFECT.  Easy, and good.

Forget this recipe!  

1 - Most bread machines rise once!

2 - If you read the directions it says when the dough cycle has FINISHED!

3 - Dough should never rise three times which it would if you use the bread machine!

We feed this to the ducks and they didn't even like it.  Don't waste your time or ingredients.  I am not a novice to bread making.  The dough was sticky, and unworkable.  Lightly flour wouldn't even allow you to work with it.  I cut the slits and they just disappeared.  

There are many recipes that are better than this one.

I love this recipe!! I made a few small changes by using APF instead of bread flour. Also I increased the sugar to 2 TBSP(tried it with one and thought it needed more) and I used a packet of active dry yeast, instead of the bread machine yeast. The baguettes turned out great!!!

Stunning.  I even purchased some buttermilk to replace some of the water (to add flavor).  I forgot to add the buttermilk, and you wouldn't notice the difference!  Amazing taste with just water, flour and yeast!  I'm almost embarrassed on how EASY it was and how DELICIOUS it was!

This is a family favorite! BUT, I never have had luck rolling the dough out. I always get too many air bubbles.  I just cut the dough in two and shape each mound into a respectable looking "baguette". Cooks perfectly, no need to add those steps.

Being used to store-bought baguettes, the difference in flavor and texture was a very pleasant surprise.  I made this with the Kitchenaid dough hook attachment, letting the yeast, sugar and warmed water bloom for ten minutes before adding everything else.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly, heating the oven to 200 degrees and then turning it off and letting my dough rise inside.  The egg yolk made a lovely golden brown, crispy crust and the inside was moist and delicious.  I can't wait to make this again!

I am a novice at yeast breads, but I have made this recipe several times, and it always turns out well.  I don't have a bread machine, so I followed the directions from reviewer DivineHealth7.

(Simply combine the water, yeast, and sugar and allow to proof. Then add the salt, then flour and knead until no longer sticky. Place in an oiled bowl and allow to rise according to recipe instructions.)

didn't add egg glaze as some other reviewers. It came out extremely hard partly because it is winter and it did not double in bulk. Will try it again when i have the time

This is a definite keeper for me.  I made two baguettes; one plain and one marbled with olive tapenade.  The plain was delicious with herb infused olive oil.  After I had rolled out the dough and divided it, I spread the olive tapenade down the center and then rolled it up into the baguette shape.  If you do this, be sure to leave a lot of room on the edges so the bread will seal during baking.  I think adding a little pesto or herbs prior to rolling it up would also be good variations.  I accidentally forgot to do the egg wash and the bread still had a crisp crust, but I’m looking forward to trying it with the wash in the future.

Absolutely the best! I have also used this for sub sandwiches, and as garlic bread so I omit the egg wash step. I cannot stress enough how awesome it is, I have made it on a daily basis for 2 weeks now and my family loves it. My son is taking a hospitality/tourism course and because cooking is a requirement, they made french baguettes which he enjoyed. Of course, he never brought the recipe home so I searched for one. He said this is the best and everyone I have shared it with or given a loaf to has commented on how great it is. It is so easy to make and so delicious, my search for the best baguette recipe has officially ended :) Thank you so much for sharing this recipe Judy!!!!

I was leery about making bread without any grease in it at all.  This turned out really well.  My modifications were: didn’t have to use step 2 (my West Bend machine took 1:40 to make the dough), didn’t have to punch the dough down in step 3.  Since we live at 4600 ft. in elevation, I increased the oven temp. to 400 degrees F. and decreased regular active-dry yeast to 1 tsp.  Turned out absolutely AWESOME.  I did have trouble rolling out the dough as written.  (It was SO elastic that every time I rolled it in the lengthwise direction, I lost what had been rolled in the widthwise direction, and vice versa.  So, eventually I rolled up what I had and then cut it in half vertically to make 2 loaves.)  Didn’t use the egg wash and it turned out nice and crusty.  A definite remake.

Oh my Goodness!!!! Is there any way I can give this like fifty stars???? I absolutely LOVED this ... WOW... 
I was making Ali's Amazing Bruschetta(http://appetizer.allrecipes.com/AZ/lismzingBrschtt.asp) also found on this site and a user suggested this recipe for the bread. It was amazing !!!!! This is the first time I have made baguettes and it will be the last time I ever buy ready made from the store. The baguettes looked so good that my husband didnt believe I made them and was sooooo impressed. Yum Yum Yum is all I can say. Thank you soooo much !!!!!!

I can't believe I've made this at least a  dozen times and never reviewed it.  I never use my bread machine, I suspect using the machine has someting to do with the sticky issue.  I let the dough hooks on my mixer do the kneading and not all that long at that. I don't use any wash as DD likes a softer crust.  When I want a crispy crust for myself I bake ahead of time then cool and the crust gets perfectly crispy on the re-heat.

This bread is terrific - sometimes I omit the sugar for a more "french bread" taste and texture.  I would definitely recommend this recipe - and it is so easy to whip up for a casual dinner!

This is very delicious bread but I don't beleive that it is exactly like french bread since this bread is soft all around (crust) and french bread normally has a crispy crust, that is what I noticed when I was in Paris anyways.  But it was gone the day I made it, great for sandwiches!

My whole family loved this bread! I don't have a bread maker, but the recipe easily converted to hand mixing.  This was the easiest bread I've ever made, and it didn't take very long to knead. I used one loaf for garlic bread, and the other I sprinkled parmesan, oregano and garlic powder prior to baking.  I was going to see how it freezes, but even though there are only 3 people in my family, there isn't enough left to freeze!

I have now made this 2 times and each time it comes out perfect. You DO NOT need a bread machine, nor do you need to roll it out, just divide into 2 and roll it on the counter with your hands till it looks like a snake. I don't use the egg wash, the traditional way is to spritz water on it during baking. AND DON'T ADD MORE FLOUR YOU NEED A STICKY DOUGH OR IT WON'T BE CRUNCHY ON TOP! DO NOT ADD MORE I only use a scant 2 cups! Trust me, if it were a sandwich bread you want it dryer, but on baguettes you need it sticky.

I have made this many times and it is the best french baguette recipe I have made and so easy too.  If you are not using a bread machine you need more flour than this calls for.  You need to slowly add more flour until the dougs pulls away from the side of the mixer while it is going.  I use about 3 1/2 cups at least.  Fantastic recipe.

I made the recipe as listed but did use a cup of water in the oven to add to the crispiness and it could still use a crispier crust. I think I will bake at 400 next time to see if that will help. I made 6 individual loafs for meatball subs. Can't wait to try them!!

This bread is great! I made it by hand, the 'old fashioned' way, and it turned out perfect. I brushed with egg white instead of yoke, that is the only step I did differently. We loved it and it's a keeper in our house. I won't be buying french bread from anywhere since this is so easy and delicious. FAST PREP: I did make this once skipping one of the rising times. After preparing the dough I immediately shaped the bread, put in on the baking sheet and let it rise in the oven for 40 minutes then baked it and the results where amazing! This is a good method to use if you are in a hurry.

We loved this. My daughter has asked me to make it again.  I tried a different french bread recipe from fancy Bread book that I bought on Amazon.com - but we much preferred this one. Will keep this one in the recipe box.  Thank you!
Update: 3/26/19 - Just made this one again, and sprinkled it with Trader Joe's everything but the bagel seasoning, and it is DELICIOUS!

This was my firs try at making bread.  I thought it turned out great.  I even made it without a bread machine or kitchen aide. Also I used half whole wheat flour and half regular. I know with time and experience it will only get better.  Thanks for this great and easy recipe. I know I will use it often.

I made this tonight to go with shish-ka-bobs.  Awesome is all I can say.  Everyone in this house said this is beter than the other French bread recipe I have been using....and they were quite skeptical at first....but this just won them over.  Made as stated except without a bread machine.  I also put a pan of water in the oven as another reviewer stated and "painted" the bread with a beaten egg white.  Perfect!!!

Perfect, delicious loaves - though not a true baguette...crust and bread are soft and light - not crunchy and chewy as a baguette should be.  Will definately make again however as it makes a nice loaf.

I've made this recipe three times already and it's a huge hit! I find that it helps to put a dish with water in it on the bottom shelf and then pull it out for the last 5-10 minutes of the baking process. It helps keep the bread from burning and lets you get a great crispy, crunchy crust at the end. I also find that I like the look and texture of the bread better without the egg yolk wash, and have started brushing olive oil over the bread during the last 5-10 minutes to get that nice golden color without all the mess and hassle of the egg. Thanks for a great recipe!

Good stuff! I do recommend using the egg white instead of the yolk, though. And I follow the recommendation to throw 1/4 cup of water into the bottom of the oven to get it crusty like typical French bread.  I'm not sure why you would need to let it rise TWICE after the dough cycle of the bread machine. Mine let it rise once, so you'd only need to shape it and let it rise once.  I don't use a bread machine any more, though, so I just mix the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Then in a separate bowl I mix the flour and salt, and then add the yeast mixture when it starts foaming. Then you knead it 3-5 minutes and let it rise the first time. When you're shaping it, you don't really have to make the rectangle and roll it up. You can just mush it into the long shape, and it comes out great. (I'm all for simple!)

Very yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did not roll the dough out.  Instead, I just divided it into 2 equal portions and shaped into baguettes.  Any leftovers are great to make some garlic bread out of the next day.  I will make this again.

This bread was so easy to make and came out absolutely perfect. I did it without a bread machine  using my much loved KitchenAid instead and here is how. - Combine 1 package of yeast, sugar and 1 cup of water (110 - 115 degrees) and let proof for 10 minutes until foamy. - Add 2 cups of flour and mix well. - Add salt and remaining flour and mix until fully incorporated. While I do all that I usually set my oven on the lowest temp and allow to warm up a bit and then turn it off to cool down a tad. - Kneed the dough by hand about 5 minutes - Put the dough into a bowl that I sprayed with PAM and flip it one time so it's covered with oil and doesn't dry out - Put into the luke warm oven and let it rise for 45 minutes - Punch down, shape into baguettes or rolls (that's what I did), place on PAM sprayed cookie sheet - Cover and let rise again for another 45 minutes - Brush the loafs with water and put a little Pyrex bowl with 1/4 cup of water on the bottom of the oven - Put loaves/rolls into oven and bake at 400 degrees for 25-35 minutes until golden brown (I brushed them once more with water half way through the baking time)  I will never buy store rolls again. This is too good!!!

This was really yummy!  I used a number of other reviews which told how to make these WITHOUT using a bread machine.   I used my KA and also subbed 1/2 whole wheat flour.  This made 3 6" loaves for me.  I will make these again, next time I'll use all AP flour to see which we prefer.  TY for a great recipe!

Just ok. I have been to Paris often and a bood Baguette is my favorite... for me, this recipe did not produce a good Baguette. A good italian style bread yes, but not a Baguette. The family actually loved it, but it was not a baguette.

What a fabulous recipe! Tastes better than the French Bread loaves you buy in the grocery store bakery! I don't have a bread machine, so I had to proof the yeast and knead by hand, and also used all-purpose flour instead of bread flour. At first I wasn't sure, because the top was not as crispy as I usually like, but once I started eating it, I realized it was perfect as is, and now I'm sad I froze the other loaf, because I wanted more! (FYI-I froze the other loaf as dough before the second rising. To defrost, I leave on the counter, then place on a cookie sheet to rise, then bake as directed.)

Over the past few years I have used MANY recipes from this site, most with some degree of success.  However, this has to be the best recipe I have tried from here.  The bread was absolutely amazing although my shaping technique needs a lot of help.  I used the bread machine and followed the recipe exactly.  I actually set the timer so it was completed when I woke up.  I then shaped it, let it rise for 40 minutes and placed in the oven.  One loaf is gone already and I have another batch mixing as I type.  We are going to try it as pizza crust tonight.  My wife kept saying it was the best bread ever with every bite.  Seems like it would be good as a pepperoni bread too.

Love this recipe. The dough is so easy to work with. I make this into one big loaf. It taste great. I do use almost 3 cups of flour. Tip I learned from my mother in-law for a crisp crust was to put ice cubes on the bottom of the stove. Turns out great everytime. Also for those who are first time bread makers be sure to use a serated knife to score the bread, otherwise it won't cut the dough.

Not as good as the real thing-- but add a bowl of water to the oven and add that yolk/w water to the crust and you'll have a  tasty, crunchy on the outside soft on the inside bread! Don't skip the folding because it adds those crucial air pockets and next time I will add the salt later after first rise (make it sea salt, too). Very tasty.

Wow! I don't have a breadmaker so I just let my Kitchenaid do all the work (thanks to the other reviewer who wrote out the instructions). I also didn't bother to roll out the dough, just shaped it myself into two rolls. Didn't use the egg wash either. Fabulous without the extra work!!! Make sure your yeast is at room temp when you use it, I always take it out of the fridge a few hours beforehand and I never have trouble getting it to proof. Thanks for sharing!

This was a great recipe.  This was my first time baking bread and it was really easy (I even made it while watching a baseball game :)).  A few notes: I used all purpose flour (which didn't hurt it one bit), I didn't use a bread machine, and I skipped the egg yolk at the end and instead placed a pan of water in the oven to mist the bread.  The crust came out perfectly crusty and the inside was soft and chewy.  The perfect french bread.  Also, I made it into four mini loaves instead of baguettes to aviod having to roll out the dough.  Three of them are already gone (I made it yesterday afternoon) and I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!  The loaves were beautiful and impossible to distinguish from professional bakery loaves.  I had a little trouble because the dough cycle on my bread machine was a little confusing, but I just let the dough rise a little longer to compensate.  I also skipped the egg yolk wash and just brushed the tops with water, and they turned out perfectly.  Next time I will definitely cut this recipe in half.  This makes 2 large baguettes which is too much for my husband and I to polish off before it goes bad.

My son usually doesn't eat bread but is always requesting this now.   I usually use the bread machine dough setting and then bake in the oven to make it even crustier. I spray water in the oven for the first 10 minutes of baking to make it crusty.

I wanted to try this recipe since it was a much faster way of making baguettes w/o using some type of starter, I admit I was skeptical, but they turned out great for making subs. One change I made was I added about 4 tsps(read the pkg directions)of vital wheat gluten to the dough when adding the dry ingriedients. Then I proceed with the recipe as usual. It improves the rise and texture of the finished loaf.

I’ve made this at least 4 times and had nothing but failure with it with deflated loaves.  Today I tried again, adding some vital wheat gluten, as I have been successfully doing with other bread recipes, and it worked!  Now I just have to remember to mist the oven for a crunchier crust.  Otherwise, with lots of persistence, this came out great!  Thanks for the recipe, Judy!

Phenomenal...I have tried many other baguette recipes but this one really is the best in terms of taste, ease and time.  I omitted brushing the loaves with the egg mixture, opting instead to brush one lightly with olive oil and leave the other loaf as is.  The loaves came out virtually identical. I will definitely be making this again but next time I think I will add 1 t. baking powder and maybe another 1/2 t. salt. This was a huge hit with the family and friends! Thank you for sharing Judy!

This is just exceptional!  Can't say enough good things about it.  And SO EASY!  Making it in the bread machine is almost as easy as buying it in the deli.  I read earlier reviews and was apprehensive about the dough being too soft and sticky but I made it exactly by the recipe and it was perfect.  Nice crisp crust and soft inside, just how I like it. The only thing I did differently was to sprinkle cornmeal on the baking sheet instead of greasing the pan - like a french bread.   THANKS for a great recipe.

After reading the rave reviews, I was disappointed with the way this turned out. It smelled great, but was flat and a bit tough. I followed the directions, the dough was sticky, raised the right amount and then fell flat. Wouldn't make again.

I did not use a bread machine. I did NOT find it necessary to roll the dough into a sheet. When I the dough out of the greased bowl, I just cut it in half and roll it to the shape of the picture.  Made the cuts, let it rise, egg wash, and baked as described. Once, I made it using bread flour then I made it a second time, using half multigrain flour and half bread flour. It came out just as good. Thanks.

O.K. I did it!!!!!it is so gooooooood I ate one one loaf straight from the oven.  Thank you Judy.  I followed the recipe to the T. The only thing I've change was the "wash" of the outside-on one loaf I did nothing after it came out of the oven I've spread some butter over the top, the second one I've brushed it with milk and put some garlic salt all over OMG I thought I've died and was in heaven!!!!! Now some tips, I did everything by the hand, I've worked it for about 20 min. the inside was fluffffffy, my oven tends to over heat from the TOP so after 10 min I've put a large tin pan over the top rack.  Aha, the salt, I sprinkle over the dough and work it in little at a time, it works good for me.  I've sprayed the over once and the baguettes came out just like on the picture.  Enjoy as much as I do!

Great and EASY recipe! This was my first attempt at a baguette and it was amazing! I took a tip from another person and put a pan with water in it on the bottom ...to make it crispier...but it still wasn't AS crispy as I wanted it to be. Next time, i'll omit it and see if it makes it crispier.(Also, I did NOT use a bread machine..did it the old fashioned way)

I loved this recipe... I follow it exactly (only substitute water with left over whey from cheese making) and the bread came out really good! I highly recommended it. Note: I did it on my KA since I do not have a bread machine.

Nice and fast recipe! I used my KA mixer for this as well. I made one large loaf instead of baguettes. Before shaping, I rolled it out a bit. Then I spread butter on it ans sprinkled with garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and basil. I rolled it, shaped into a loaf and let it rise about 40 minutes. I do not use egg on any bread. When this came out, I sprayed the top lightly with olive oil using a Misto. SO YUMMY! A real dinner table treat!!

My husband started using this recipe for fresh baguettes. Excellent recipe. The taste is great - sometimes i find homemade bread a bit bland, but this is perfect.

Ps: did all by hand. No machine required and I used regular yeast as well

Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!
This is so good! It was easy and they're just out of the oven, i cracked one open and it smells awesome!! I don't think i'll ever buy french baguettes anymore!!
I'm starting another batch right now and i'll double it to have some bread ahead!!!
Thanks again! My oldest son is gonna be thrilled, he loves bread and when he'll wake up it will smell fresh bread! (I have insomnia, might as well use this to cook LOL)

Easy and delicious. I followed some of the tips and used egg white brushed on the loaves before baking, and put a bowl of water in the oven while it baked for steam. My bread wasn't rising very well (maybe my house was too cold?), so I used a tip I found online - put a heating pad under the bowl or pan. Works great. The loaf looked really pretty once baked and had the perfect taste and texture. I look forward to enjoying the second loaf tomorrow with leftover lasagna!

I really like this recipe for quick baguettes. A suggestion for the recipe -- slash the baguettes right before you put them in the oven, after you have done the egg wash. This will help them retain their bulk and not shrink down. Another suggestion I have is to cut the slashes in with clean kitchen scissors. I find it a lot more consistent. Happy baking!

great flavor but somehow it didn't rise as much as it should have. with the amount of success other people have had with this recipe i'm inclined to think maybe my kitchen was too cold or something.

Excellent for French Dip sandwiches! Instead of wasting time separating an egg and brushing with egg yolk and water, I just beat a whole egg (isn't the white just a lot of water anyway?? lol) and got a nice beautiful crunchy crust.

This bread was great! Once the bread machine made the dough, I shaped it into one loaf of bread and popped into the oven for 30 minutes. I skipped the additional step of letting it rise and then punching it back down. It turned out very good!

I added two ice cubes to the bottom of the oven after I put the dough in and the top turned out pretty crunchy. I saw this technique on this website when I looked up a different French bread recipe. Not sure how that works but it worked.

Last night we made these and Easy French Dip Sandwiches (this site). Both were fantastic. We doubled the dough recipe, used the Kitchen Aid and Kneaded until fairly stiff. I put the dough in  a cool oven, added ice on the bottom to increase the humidity at the early stage (for crustiness) and we were very, VERY pleased. This is now my favorite sandwich bread recipe.

When you make homemade FrenchBaguettes your expectation of the result is higher and you expect it to be the best French Baguette you've ever had. It was just okay in my opinion.

I was in a hurry and decided not to use the bread machine and do everything by hand; I got 2 baguettes, you may want to remember that, if you want more the recipe has to be doubled. 
The whole thing was quite easy; I decided not to do the egg wash passage and didn't brush the loaves with anything, but I don't think they suffered from it... the bread was great warm from the oven (my husband devoured one by himself in a few minute). It was still good after some hours, though, so I'sll definitely keep this one.

Like this recipe needs another 5 star review. Awesome. Exactly what i was looking for and i'm eating a piece right now fresh out of the oven! I did need more flour then called for but i don't mind at all. Having with the garlic cheddar chicken on this site and mashed potatoes with gravy! Perfect bread!

Perfection!  This recipe is foolproof!  If I can make wonderful baguettes like this, anybody can do it!  I made these for the "Mini Meatball Subs" recipe by Matykada on this site and they were perfect!  I brushed the loafs with olive oil instead of the egg yolk.  They were perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft and slightly chewy on the inside.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Judy!

This recipe is fantastic and fool-proof! I did this in my KitchenAid mixer, but made sure to add the salt after the first 15 minute rise (so not to kill the yeast). I made this into one large loaf instead of 2 loaves, and it was perfect. May only use egg white instead of yolk for the topping though - my hubby was a bit put off by the cooked egg on the bread (he doesn't eat eggs).

WOW!  I can't believe how easy this was, I will never buy this again now that I've discovered how to make it myself!  I left out the egg wash and  shaped into baguettes instead of rolling.  Love, love, love this!

wonderful!  My first attempt at french bread and I was so happy!  I followed the directions exactly except I used an egg white to brush on top instead of the egg yolk and I didn't roll it out.  I just shaped it and got the air out.  I'll probably make this again tonight!

This bread is great! It has that perfect buttery home-made bread taste. After the fist time with this recipe, I switched the yeast to 2 and 1/4 ts and upped the rise time to 60 min and 45 min. Other than that I followed the directions exactly. Comes out perfect!

I LOVE this recipe for really easy French bread. I use an egg white instead of a yolk to brush over the loaves and I always throw some water in the bottom of the oven when I start baking. Double the recipe! It's a keeper.

Excellent! I would have given this 5 stars but if DivineHealth7 didn't explain how to make this recipe without a bread machine, I wouldn't have known where to begin - a big thank thank you to DivineHealth7 as this was my first time making anything that contained yeast and it was a success! Otherwise it's a super easy and reliable recipe. Will definitely make again. :)

Awesome!!!!  I doubled the recipe and it make 2 french loaves instead of baguettes.   I added the salt at the end of the knead in the bosch.  Let rise slowly and score right before baking.

This recipe is awesome! I did it in my kitchenaid stand mixer and it turned out perfect. My husband and his friend scarfed both loaves before I could serve dinner. Next time I will double. Tons better than grocery store bread. Will definitely make again!

Not bad. It wasn't the type of baguette I was expecting though. Seemed more of a white sandwich bread consistency. I used my kitchenaid with the dough hook: proofed the yeast in water and sugar for 10 min; added in the flour and mixed for about 6 min, working my way from 'Stir' to 4 so as to not have flour flying everywhere; let this rest for 15 min; sprinkle the salt over the top and mix this in; place dough in oiled bowl and let rise for an hour; shaped dough on a silpat covered sheet and brushed with egg white only; put a small dish of water in the bottom of the oven while it came to temp; baked for about 28 min total until lovely and brown. It looked great! Just not the flavor I was hoping for.

So good and so easy. I've made it exactly like the recipe, and I've also added Italian spices to the bread. I braid the bread or make it long and skinny. It is delicious!

Of all the breads I have baked, this one is the closest to the ones sold at the bakeries in Brazil. I have made it many times and the whole family loves it. I have also made it using the Kitchen Aid and it came out perfectly. I make several loafs, bake them until they are light brown and then freeze them. I take the amount of bread we are going to eat for breakfast out of the freezer and let it sit out overnight and then finish baking in the morning. It works great!

this is the best recipe I have come across! My whole family loves this bread. Very easy to make too. I made it the first few times with the breach machine dough cycle... and I'm curious to try it without using it.

First of all, I was a little confused after reading the directions for this recipe.  The dough cycle on my bread machine takes 1 hour 30 minutes; kneads, first rise, punches down the dough; then a second rise.  For the life of me I couldn't see the need to have it rise again, form into loaves and rise again. Rise overkill was what I was thinking, but I went ahead with the submitter's directions.  I also found that the 2 1/2 cups of flour was not nearly enough and had to add approximately an additional 1/2 cup.  Instead of two baguettes, I opted to make one large loaf, which several reviewer's have done successfully.  Results - a beautiful crusty loaf of French bread, lovely texture and taste.  This is now my go to recipe for French bread.  Thanks Judy for the recipe.

These baguettes are ideal for slicing up to place atop a bowl French onion soup.  I doubled the recipe, and made the dough by hand because I couldn't find my bread machine.  I also proofed the water, yeast and sugar before adding the flour and salt, as others had suggested.  After I formed the loaves, I froze two of them, covered in lots of plastic wrap. (I would also use foil if freezing it for a longer period than that, though.)  Making this dough by hand was utterly worth it to make an authentic French onion soup, complete with Guyere and mozzarella cheeses melted on top after all, but rather time-consuming to collectively do. So, I have got to find my bread machine for the next time I make this.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Judy!

I do not have a bread machine, so I followed another reviewer's suggestion about using the dough hook on my kitchen aid mixer.  I've made it twice now and it's really not too hard.  I love garlic bread and on a weekend when I have time to make it, would definitely choose to make this instead of going and buying some from the store.  My husband loves it and has already asked me to make it again.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe is wonderful.  I have now made it close to a dozen times, using the bread maker on the dough cycle.  I prefer one large loaf with the ingredients as written.  Placed a 9 x 13 pan 1/4 full with water as oven is preheating to 425 degrees and bake for 20 minutes.  So easy and much cheaper than buying bread.

These baguettes rival the ones I buy at the high-end bakery downtown. Delicious! And actually very simple! I tried the recipe out last night and I couldn't be happier with the results! I used the suggestions of other members and brushed with egg whites, instead of egg yolks, to get that yummy crusty outside, and put 1/4 cup of water on the bottom of the oven. I also kneaded the salt in, instead of adding it to the dough right away. The results were awesome! I'm making more tonight, since last night's baguettes have already been ravenously eaten by myself, my hubby, and our little girl. :o)

I made this BY HAND and it turned out fantastically!  The only change I did was add the salt after the first 15 minutes of rising.  Also, I mixed in some rosemary and poppy seeds in with the egg for the wash over the top!  DELICIOUS!!!   Oh I also put 1/4 cup of water in the bottom of the oven to provide additional moisture while baking.

The flavor was close, but they were too dense the 1st time I made them: I suggest:  1.) Stretching the baguette dough to get long, large gas pockets instead of "pounding out any air bubbles as you go." 2.) If you don't have big pans for long baguettes,  cook them on parchment paper placed on top of the oven racks  3.) Use flour that is no more than 12% protein (King Arthur Artisan is 11.7% while KA's Bread, Whole Wheat and All-Purpose Flours are 13% protein)  4.) Don't rush the bread to rise-it;s okay if it takes longer than 30 - 45 mins. Often it takes 60 mins, especially in the winter months or when the air conditioning is blasting...5.) Pat yourself on the back for trying to master something that seems really easy, but takes time :-))

These are absolutely delicious!  I made them by hand instead of using a bread machine.  I let the yeast proof, then threw the ingredients in my kitchenaid stand mixer.  I brushed the loaves with egg white only and put a small bowl of water on the bottom rack of the oven for the first 15 minutes of baking.  This bread is sooo good!  :~)

Awesome Recipe!  Didn't change a thing except I had to bake it at 400 because I have an oven that runs low......perfect crispy crust and chewy interior.  I will make at least 2 or 3 times a week now for my hubby's lunch.  awesome, thanks Judy!!

I used the bread machine for this and I found the air bubbles to be too small for a classic baguette bread (over-kneaded in machine).  I think next time I will knead the bread by hand and increase the oven temp for a crustier loaf.  It turned out much like the bread they call 'french' in the grocery store.  Good for french toast, not a great baguette.

For awhile now this has been my go to recipe for when I want to serve bread with dinner.  Measurements are spot on.   I make mine by hand or with my KA.  I usually skip the egg yolk and water and just throw a little water into the bottom of the oven as I'm putting the bread in to get a thicker crunchy outer crust.  I made this last night for the 147th time and we devoured one loaf right out of the oven.  The second loaf will turn into croutons today.  This is a great recipe, for novice or experienced bread makers alike.

I am completely new to home baking of bread. I cannot get where we are now - they just don't taste or have the same texture. So I tried this recipe, incorporating most of the comments. This is an easy recipe to follow, and I did all the kneading in the mixing bowl. I added the salt between the 1st and 2nd rising, put in small dishes of water in the oven to create the steam. I find the inside of the bread very dense, almost bagel/english muffin texture. How do I get it to be light and fluffy like those store bought french loaves?  Please advice, I would like to make this again

I LOVE this recipe! I added some crushed rosemary to mine. I also added melted butter to the egg wash instead of water. To those that are hand kneading the bread just use a little olive oil on your hands instead of adding more flour. And please for the love of bread use BREAD FLOUR lol! A++ recipe !

Delicious.... I made this bread last night and the kids ate it all! great texture, the only thing that I did different was to add 4 tsp. of vital wheat gluten. You can get that at most grocer's. It makes your bread come out with an awesome texture. I use it in all my bread recipes.

These came out pretty good. I think I let it rise too long before going into the oven (if thats even possible) because once it was baking it didn't rise anymore. Pretty good though. I tried the ice cube technique...the crust didnt come out as flaky as I had hoped...it was my first time so I will def. to making again...maybe with better results. UPDATE: I made this a 2nd time and used my kitchen aid. I kneaded the salt in after like other reviewers suggested. I also put some water in the oven with it. Came out crispy on the outside. I made one loaf into garlic bread (roasted garlic, butter, evoo and fresh basil and oregano from my garden) and the other Im saving for sammies for lunch tomorrow. Im much happier with my results the 2nd time around.

The best bread recipe I have tried!  I used AP flour b/c that is what I had and still turned out great.  I followed others suggestions and used egg white wash rather than egg yolk.  I also place a oven safe container with water in the oven for the humidity.

Mmmmm. These are super easy and super tasty. I tried the water-steam trick, but I still didn't end up with a crunchy crust. Didn't matter though - they were gone almost immediately! I did the salt trick another reviewer posted about kneeding the salt in - worked like a charm. So easy and SO YUMMY!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! I had made baguettes before, but this one beat them all. I really like crispy flaky crusts and had read that to obtain one you mist the bread with water every couple of minutes while baking instead of an egg wash. Came out perfect, and friends and family (and myself) loved the smell and the taste... Will have to do it again and again and again!

All I can say is WOW!!! That was so easy. I put a pan of water in the oven on the rack under the bread and it gave the bread the extra moisture it needed to get crusty. Instead of an egg wash, I just dusted the rolled dough with flour during the last rise. Great recipe---I see me making it again and again!

I love this bread! I made it to go with the Easy Slow Cooker French Dip from this site and it was so good. I only did the egg white wash on top and it had a nice browned, crunchy crust. I will definately make this again!

The fact that I've made this 3 times in a week is proof that this recipe is fantastic! It's SUPER easy to make and is honestly the best bread I've ever tasted. The only con is that it's hard to resist... the bread will call your name when you're in the other room :) I left out the egg wash (to make it vegan) and instead, poured on some Agave Nectar which made the bread a little sweet. To rise, I put the dough (both times) in an oven that was set to 200 degrees and turned off (once the dough went in). This recipe is a keeper!

Did I do something wrong? I made theses by hand (I always make bread machine recipes by hand and they turn out fine), my only guess is b/c I used all-purpose flour instead? Anyhow.. the dough didn't rise at either stage.. did my yeast die in the last two days that I didn't use it? I guess I'll try another recipe.. it felt a little funky without any oil..

Fabulous!
I kneaded everything in my Kitchenaid and left the salt for the last ingredient, which I kneaded in after allowing the dough to rest in the bowl for 10 minutes.
Before the dough goes into its second rise, in its formed state, I make slashes with kitchen scissors.

The first time I made this, Alex and I ate BOTH baguettes in one sitting, hot out of the oven.  We couldn't help it, this recipe is just that good.
I've made it more than a dozen times since then.
Thank you so much for this recipe!

I've been dying to try a new french baguette recipe so I chose this one. (Lucky little recipe!) 
I had no rolling pin so I just pounded the dough out with my mighty fists and pulled, shaped it and roughed it out. After brushing the loaves liberally with the egg mixture, I seasoned the tops with some garlic powder, italian seasoning, and grated parmesan cheese. They turned out beautifully and filled the whole house with a wonderfully fragrant smell.
Great taste and good consistency as well.

I shall be using this recipe often and will also make smaller rolls to use for sandwiches, brats and sausage, pepper & onions. 
Experiment with different seasonings on top, you'll be glad you did!
Do it, do it.

This was the first time for me to make any kind of yeast bread. I do not have a bread maker, so I followed the suggestions given by the other reviewer for making the bread by hand. I ended up with two golden, chewy, perfect-looking, delicious baguettes that, quite frankly, astonished me.

I did have to add a little extra water for the kneading, but that likely varies. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was an easy recipe to make.  I don't have a bread machine, so I did it by hand.  I'm not very good at forming loaves but these directions were easy to follow.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour.  My loaves didn't rise much the second time, but still tasted good.  My kids loved it!

I used way more flour than the recipe called for - almost4 cups. But it wouldn't turn into a bread dough unless I added more - it was more like soup. I would never have been able to shape it. Also, when baking, I didn't preheat the oven, but put the dough in then turned the oven on. This, with the addition of a bit of water in a separate pan while the bread was baking, gave the bread a nice crust.

What went wrong?  Something was not right in the timing!  My dough setting on my Welbilt bread maker took 1 hr. 30 min., so I knew it was not going to fit into the time schedule.  I followed through on the rest of the timing, but it took 1 hr. longer and turned out very heavy and not at all what I expected!  Can anyone help?  Thanks!

made this in my kitchen aid and it was so easy.  I did not use egg wash but threw some ice cubes on the bottom of the oven.  The bread came out much crispier than any french bread I have made in the past.  Really delicious and a wonderful recipe.  I know I will make it again and again.

This is the easiest and best tasting bread I have ever made in my bread machine.  I've been making it in a single loaf as well.  It has been a perfect consistency everytime it comes out of the bread machine.  I've made this a couple of times for company and they all beg for the recipie.

I don't use a bread machine and this recipe is still excellent. Personally, I like my baguette to have a bit more of a bite, so I doubled the salt, and it was perfect for my taste. So I give it 5 whole, happy stars.

The best way I've found to get "crunch" is to spray with water every so often while baking the loaves.  If you want soft (us oldsters sometimes need softer crust), brush tops with melted butter when you take them from the oven.  HTH!!!  Blessings!

I made this from the printed recipe in my Allrecipes magazine.  The amounts of flour called for in the magazine and on the website differ.  I did not make this in a bread machine, but I make bread all the time and that should not make a difference.  I liked the flavor of this, but just did not like the consistency.  My loaves came our heavy, almost pretzel like.  I don't understand all the five-star ratings.  I think I will keep looking for a french baguette recipe.

It's fantastic! I followed the recipe the first time and it was great. The next time I added rosemary and Italian seasoning. It was even more delicious!

I've failed at bread enough to know that this recipe is really easy to make! I used the paddle attachment on the kitchenaid mixer to mix the ingredients together, then kneaded with the dough hook for about 5 minutes. The bread tasted great, there was good consistency and crust, but my loaves looked a bit saggy and they kind of puddled out. Maybe I needed to chill the dough?

This is a great bread recipe.  I only give it 4 stars for method, but it is a winner on flavor.  I used 2 1/4 cups all purpose flour as I was out of bread flour.  I did it without a bread machine as well.  For that perfect crust I used a method that I learned when I lived in Italy; after the bread is split on top and risen, I lightly spritz the loaves with a fine mist of water. This provides the crust that makes the recipe the best.

I wanted bigger baugettes so I made a recipe and a half.  Turned out great!  Mixed the dough in a bread maker using the dough setting.  Just make sure to put the salt & sugar in with the water on the bottom, flour in the middle, and then the yeast in a little "cup" you make in the top of the flour.  I wanted a longer baugette, so when this rolled out it was more like 16" x 24", and I rolled it up so it was 16" long.  Then, after I let it rise the second time, I worked it down again and stretched out the baugettes so they were approx. 24" long, then let them rise a 3rd time for about 15 minutes, then baked as directed.  I just placed them diagonally on my cookie sheet so they would fit.  Turned out perfectly!

This is a fantastic recipe. I made almost as directed, and it made two tasty loves, one which I served sliced with a variety of cheeses, and the other with a pasta dinner. The only change I made was to brush the pre-baked loaves with milk instead of the egg yolk - this worked just fine.

This bread is fantastic!  Who knew it could be so easy to make such a fabulous baguette?!?! The dough was pretty sticky when I pulled it from the bread machine, but by the time it was ready to roll out, it was a dream to work with.  It baked up to a lovely golden brown, and the texture was perfect.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe :)

Great French bread!  I made this in my bread machine, and the dough cycle is 2 hours long.  It may be quicker to make by hand, if you are pressed for time.  This was insanely easy to make, no more store bought French sticks for me!  Thx for sharing

A wonderful bread for sandwiches, I made this by hand by mixing the yeast, sugar and water together and leaving until creamy, then I ended up adding about 3 1/2c flour to it to get a workable smooth dough and kneaded 10 mins. I liked the tip someone gave about folding the salt in later, it seemed to help.  I was a little concerned when I left it to rise but it came out crusty and delicious. I didn't bother rolling them into rectangles, I just shaped them into loaves myself when I knocked it back. I also threw a few ice cubes in the bottom of my oven when it went in to help the crust. Not a true baguette, but very good really big rolls.

Ok, I admit I have a French Bread pan. But I've only used it once before, an unmitigated disaster. So I didn't expect this to turn out so well, so easily! I made it in the bread machine just as listed, but due to one reviewer's suggestion I sprinkled on the salt last, after the first knead cycle, so that it got kneaded into the bread after it was doughy. It was indeed super-sticky, so was hard to get out of the pan, but I dumped it directly into the oily bowl and tossed it around a bit like a pizza chef until it made a nice ball. Rose it for 30 mins.

After the bread rose I put it on a floury cutting board where it landed in a nice oval shape and I cut it lengthwise in two with a floured knife since I hate rolling things (per others' advice, and wise since it's so sticky). Shaped it a bit to make it longer. Then put it on my fancy two-baguette bread pan. 

Let it rise for 20 minutes, brushed with egg whites only (again per advice) and put in at 425 convection with a pan of water at the bottom of the stove (try as I might I'm not brave enough to throw water on the base of the stove as some suggested). Cooked up in a dreamy-quick 15 minutes with crust hard and soft at the same time. (Soft right out of the oven, hardens a bit for the next day as you'd like). Raves! Family had to forcibly restrain themselves from eating it all since I wanted some for sandwiches. What an easy recipe! I will pretend this is hard to make to others, but not to you, dear AllRecipes friends. Enjoy.

Having never made French bread, I was very pleased at how easy this was.  It didn't turn out quite as well as I'd hoped, but my house is COLD and so I had to keep warming up my oven a bit and putting it in there to raise.  Still, it came out crusty and chewy and tasty.  I'll make this again.

Loved the crunchy exterior of the bread. The baguettes didn't rise as much as I would have liked.  The yeast I used was fresh but I think the next time I won't roll it out.  I'll just shape the bread and let it rise the 2nd time that way.

This was simple to make and totally fabulous tasting!  I brushed the tops of the dough with an egg white wash and also threw some ice cubes (approx. 5 or so) in the bottom of the oven while the bread was baking.  It had a nice crust, beautiful colour, great texture.  I will definitely be making this again.

Yay! I am brand new bread maker.  I did not use a bread machine.  I was able to get 4 hoagie rolls. They may not have been shaped perfect but they were really good!  I will never have to buy rolls again! They had lots of air pockets giving a crisp outside and just the right amount of chewiness in the middle. Next time I will use the tip to put pan of water on oven bottom rack to make crispy crust.  I used egg white on top of loaves.  If you are brand new like me....go to YouTube to look at what yeast proofing and dough rising should look like. My husband thinks they taste like the chain, Jimmy Johns Sub french rolls.

Very delicious! Something to possibly make the crust crunchier might be to wait until it has baked for 10 mins, then do the egg wash. I just do an egg white wash. That seems to work alright. (:

I put 18servings in and calculated the recipe that way so i could use a whole packet of the active dry yeast. I do not have a bread machine, so I did this all by hand. I proofed the yeast with 1/4 cup of water and 1tsp of sugar for about 15 minutes. Then i added it to the rest of the ingredients and kneaded. Let it rise in my warm oven for about an hour, then I shaped it into six hoagie rolls. Oh..I also added in about a handful of shredded cheddar cheese and 1 fresh jalapeno chopped. I added this to the dry ingredients just before I added my yeast mixture and kneaded. I made these as jalapeno cheddar hoagie rolls and then I made philly cheese steak sandwiches on them for dinner. They were delicious. Since I read different reviews saying use the yolk and others saying use the egg white, I just went ahead and whipped a whole egg and brushed it with that. It made a nice golden top. Very good recipe and easy to make.

I followed the directions exactly and was beyond impressed at how beautiful and tasty these baguettes are.  My mother-in-law raved about these, my husband said they were the best baguettes he had ever eaten.  My go to bread recipe for a compliment to any dinner.  I haven't tried them for sandwiches yet but the consistency seems perfect for that oo.

Great tasting French bread, not French baguette.  Loved the taste and will make again, but really this recipe is an American style French bread, not a French baguette.  This bread is fantastic for sandwiches.  However, every classic French baguette I've ever had was too hard, crunchy and difficult to handle (without everything falling out) to make good sandwich bread.

Hi- I want to love this recipe but mine did not quite turn out like everyone says. I'm sure it was user error.. I'm hoping someone can tell me what went wrong.. I mixed on dough cycle in my Westbend as instructed. BUT, when it was time to takeout, it was very,very sticky.  Ihad to pull it all off the sides of the maker. I have never seen that - it was stringy. Anyway, I added a little flour and let it rise in bowl again. Was able to get out but still seemed like it would be hard to roll. I noticed some said they just formed so I did that. All I had enough for was one small loaf. It came out about 10 inches long and 2 inches wide. It has a pretty good taste and the crust is nice.. Bread seems a little dense and as I said there was no way to get 2 loaves.. I am a novice bread maker and first time I have tried to make one not soley in the bread maker.

Turned out great. I ended up making four smaller baguettes and served them fresh from the oven with a chicken & veggie casserole. My man raved about the bread...not so much about the chicken, lol. (I personally thought the casserole was delicious!)

We love this bread. Living in a rural town in Tanzania, there is nowhere to buy nice bread and this easy recipe produces great results with minimal ingredients and no need for extensive baking skills.

Very good recipe! A friend of mine who is French, asked me how I made this...he said it was exactly how a french baguette should taste! I ignore the cutting sizes, because I like longer thinner baguettes...otherwise just follow the recipe.

Easy to make and really good. I put the egg yolk in the dough by mistake, but it's really good anyways.

Good recipe, just needs some extra flour. Like others, I found the dough to be too sticky. It was just on the edge of being too sticky, and then I added a tablespoon of minced garlic, which sent it over the edge. I added a few extra tablespoons of flour and did a warm rise in the oven. I found the dough to be almost too delicate and loose to work with so struggled with making two clean rectangles, but they came out delicious nevertheless. I let them cook a little longer and also threw a 1/2 cup of water in the bottom of the oven to create some steam and a crispy crust.

So easy and so good! I added a tablespoon of olive oil to the dough along w/an extra tablespoon of flour.  Kneaded it on parchment paper which worked well for not sticking. I skipped the egg wash and added 1/4 cup of water to the bottom of the oven when I put the bread in (hidden heating element, if yours isn't hidden I'd put the water in a small oven safe bowl on the bottom rack or spray the sides of the oven with water). Crust was light and crispy and the center was very soft. Thanks! Will NOT buy store bought again!! Update: Day 2 the crust wasn't very good so I will half the recipe for my small family and only make 1 next time, still awesome!

I don't have a bread machine. Therefore, instead of using a bread machine as it suggested in this recipe, I used mixer. I put all the ingredients in a mixing bowl and turned on the mixer for 15-20 minutes. After that, I followed the rest of the steps in the recipe. It turned out great! Easy and simple. Love it.

I made this yesterday for the first time.  Holy yummy!!!  The only thing I changed was used an egg white wash instead of the egg yolk and then sprinkled powdered garlic and cornmeal on top.  I'm making another batch today to go with pasta!

It was easy and really great tasting. The only things I did differently was that I put garlic salt instead of salt and brushed egg white instead of yolk. I will always use this recipe for french bread! It was great!

This was my first attempt at baguettes and they turned out great. I brushed egg white on the dough and placed a bowl of water in the oven during baking. I used a bread machine on the dough setting and made sure the water was 90 degrees F. Once I took the dough out of the machine I let it rise covered in the oven with just the oven light on. We took one loaf to a dinner party and it was gone in no time. We would have taken both except we ate half of the other one before we left the house.

I just took the bread out of the oven and it smells AMAZING!  I am having to hold back from eating it.  The dough was easy to work with, (I didn't use a bread machine, just proofed the yeast with sugar and water, then stirred and kneaded the dough), and rose beautifully. I sprinkled some oregano on top of one.  I can't wait to have the first slice.  Thanks for a great recipe! :)

Really good bread! However, I found the texture a little bit too tough, especially as day two came and the bread began to get a little old. Still, fresh out of the oven it's amazing, and I will definitely be making this again.

On a 2nd attempt, I added about 1 extra cup of flour to the sticky dough, I use milk instead of water and it was the best baguette I ever made!! The crust was soft. I really love it! Thanks again!

This is my first attempt at making baguettes, and I am thrilled with this recipe.  I don't, however, use a bread machine nor packaged yeast.  So, I adapted this recipe using my sourdough sponge instead.  Because I used 1 cup of sponge, I then reduced the flour and water by 1 cup.  When mixing this up, I realized it was too dry, so I dribbled water in a little at a time until the dough was the perfect consistency and I used my kitchen aide mixer to knead the dough for about 5 minutes and then I let the dough rest for 20 minutes.  After 20 minutes, I added the salt to the dough and kneaded for about 7 minutes, or until the dough was smooth and would stretch quite nicely before breaking off.  I then proceeded to do a first rise, which was about 2 to 3x longer due to using a sponge vs purchased yeast.  The second raise was a bit longer as well.  I also did not put an egg wash on the loaves, but put a pan with some water in the bottom of the oven so I did get a crispy crust.  I got 2 loaves from this recipe, and will use it often.  This is going to save me lots of money as I was spending $2.99 a loaf at the co-op!  Thanks for posting an excellent recipe!

AWESOME recipe. Bread turns out perfect every time. I don't use the bread machine and it comes out great. I've even become REALLY evil and upped the yeast to two teaspoons. Then...when you roll it out to form the loaves. You know when it's all flat and just screaming for filling? Yes. You add cheddar or the Asiago blend in the tub (from Trader Joe's), sprinkle some fresh cracked pepper and roll it right up and pinch it off and cook it just as directed, like nothing ever happened. And if you want to make it a meal, you can roll salami or ham or turkey up in there too. Just make sure your cheese and meats are room temperature before adding them. I haven't had one person turn away a third slice yet.

UPDATE: OK. I love, love, love this recipe and on the advice of another reviewer I finally added a ramekin of water on the baking dish instead of brushing with egg wash and let me tell you. THIS is french bread. I could move to France and be welcomed with open arms with some loaves of this stuff. I have a small Westinghouse 1954 roaster that I bake in so I only used a small ramekin of water so if you cook in a large oven you may want to adjust the amount of water accordingly. But let me tell you...it's ALL about the humidity. Nice, chewy and crusty and parfaite!

Good recipe but I thought it was too little for 2 baguettes. I guess I am used to large ones! Or maybe mine didn't rise as much as it should have? I don't think I like egging the crust before baking either, but otherwise, the flavor is pretty good.

PERFECTION! I brushed egg whites on top of dough to make a crispy crust. 

Next time, I'll double the salt to suit my taste.

This is my go-to recipe for baguettes.  My husband lived in France for two years, and said these are the closest to real baguettes that I've made.  Keeper!

very nice bread. I made mine with a mixer so there is no need for a bread maker.
you may want to bake them in a baguette pan to help them keep shape, nice taste great for eating plain with butter or a nice ham and cheese sandy

I have a coffee shop and made this bread for the "subs" we were going to introduce, so I added some herbs too, 1 gram dried rosemary, 1g oregano, 1g thyme in the dough and brushed it with yolk plus 1g oregano, made an excellent herb bread though it was a bit dense for my taste so i am using 250 ml water next time, it will be stickier but I will manage that.
Thank you. :)

Another very good French Bread recipe.  Simple and tasty.  Used to make individual rolls to go with our beef stew.  Was great sopping up the gravy.

All I can say is WOW. Simply the best baguette/french bread recipe for the home cook. Authentic to the core. I forgot the eggwash and the crust still came out crispy with that signature crunch that french bread makes when you tear it apart and watch the steam rise from it, then slather it with butter and.... oh, hello... lost in how good that was. Time for another loaf!

I don't have a bread machine. So I combined the water, sugar, and yeast and let proof. Then stirred it into the flour and salt. Kneaded for about five minutes and let rise. FANTASTIC! DH said this was his second favorite bread, right under a dinner roll I make.

By mistake I added the egg yolk to the mix and then had to add some more flour to get to the correct consistancy. I also added about half tsp of salt to the eggwash.  The bread turned out to be fantastic, crispy crust and very soft in the middle, so that was a good mistake. I have written this down in my own special recipe cook book.

Just made this exactly as written.  Came out perfect.  Dough was easy to handle, not sticky.  Made the dough in my bread machine, then proofed it in my oven.  Perfect.  Home sick from work today so I made vegetarian split pea soup and this bread.  Perfect!  I'm hiding the bread from my kids and husband!  Great recipe.

As someone new to making bread, I was terrified to try this. I followed this recipe to a tee, and my bread came out perfect! This bread was just as delicious, if not more so, than what I USED to buy at my grocer's bakery.

I'm rating this is comparison to the other highly-reviewed french bread recipe on this site.  This is good.  Taste-wise it's probably a little better.  But this bread is very time-consuming...a full dough cycle in the bread machine plus two rises is a long time.  The result is very light and fluffy and delicious.  But the other recipe is much more simpler and gives you much larger loaves.  So even though this is a 5 star recipe, my go-to french bread recipe is the other one.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  I put mine through the bread dough cycle and substituted 1/2 c. whole wheat flour for 1/2 c. of the white.  The second rise just didn't materialize, but the end product was still like I said.  Will let it rise longer next time, but the crunchy outiside from the egg wash was terrific and the four of us ate both loaves in one seating w/pasta.

I love this recipe.  Like other's suggested, I placed a pan of water underneath.  I love making fresh homemade bread, and I love that I made this for guests and they loved it.  Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside with enough taste.

I made this to go with a Bahn Mi sandwich recipe. It was delicious, even though I ended up using AP Flour (no bread flour) and I only had egg whites, so I used that for the wash. I also used rapid rise yeast and I made this by hand (no bread maker). Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Just tried this recipe for the first time. Used Gold Medal bread flour & measured carefully. Let it go all the way through the 1st rising in my bread machine as I usually do. What a horrible, sticky mess! I had to knead in another 1/2 C flour before I could form the baguettes. Still had to scrape the dough off of my board while I was rolling them up. I will probably try this again but next time I'll use 3 C flour from the start.

Terrific! I made a few *minor* changes, but not out of any impression that the recipe wasn't fine as-is. Besides hand-kneading, I also let the sugar, yeast and water mingle for about 15 minutes with about 1 cup of flour before adding the salt and remaining flour. I can't for the life of me find my pastry brush, and I thoughtlessly let these rise in a glass pan, so instead of doing the egg wash or using the "ice cubes" method I flicked water onto the loaves just before I put them into the oven. I baked at 400° for the first 10 minutes to make the loaves "spring", then turned it down to 375° for the last 10 minutes. They look fantastic and taste wonderful; this is springy, fluffy, yummy bread. Thank you!

Holy cow. These are great. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't use a bread machine, I just kneaded the dough for 10-15 minuets after mixing in as much of the flour as I could.  Also I topped it off with Italian seasoning and shredded cheese after the egg wash, tasted amazing.

This bread is SO good, and so easy to make. I usually just make one big loaf instead of two, it still turns out perfect. I make it exactly as is and bake for 20 minutes. I don't use the egg wash on top--just some butter when it comes out of the oven.

Why not be the 565th person to say yes, this is definately great!  I made this on Monday, again on Wed and now 2 loaves are in the oven again for Friday night dinner with the neighbors.  I followed the recipe to a tee on Mon. Then upped the yeast to 2 tsp. on Wed and sprinkled the top with kosher salt and pepper-skipping egg wash.  Did it the same today.  Just perfect!

This recipe is EXCELLENT.  I have made this one and the "Fabulous French Loaves" on this site, and this baguette recipe wins, hands down.  I used regular yeast and kneaded in my Kitchenaid with the dough hook instead of using a bread machine.  Excellent result.  Nice crispy bottom, slightly chewy top, and perfect moderately dense french bread crumb.  Don't miss this one.  They are lovely.

I used my kitchenaid. I subbed some whole wheat flour for a heartier taste. Used it the first day for some brie and the next day I made french toast with it. It went well with both sweet and savory flavors.

This is a fantastic recipe and the smaller portions make just the right amount for a few people.  It's not really a traditional french baguette, but I knew that before I started baking these.  A traditional French Baguette requires a biga or poolish, which is started the day before and the best baguettes are made by hand. But because of the outstanding flavor of these - they deserve high praise.  I would definately use these for sub sandwiches.  I used my kitchenAid, upped the yeast to 2 tsp of Red Star and proofed the yeast in the 1 cup of warm water and sugar.  Then I added the remaining ingredients, adding the salt last.  I used EGG WHITE, not egg yolk to the tops and baked with a bowl of water for steam.  I also increased my oven temperature to 425 degrees and baked it for about 20 minutes on the pizza stone - really adds to the crispiness and golden brown of the tops.  Perfectly crisp crust and fluffy tender flake on the inside.  Ethereal and quite nice.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks Judy.

Like everyone else says, this is easy and delicious. My two teenage kids and I knocked off both loaves in one sitting.

My family loves these baguettes and they are so simple and easy to make. I do add a bit more salt and sugar otherwise I'd have given a 5.

WOW!  This recipe is great. It's so basic and simple that it seems strange in a way to really live up to the reviews.  But it definitely does! It made the house smell great while it was baking!  I used my bread machine to make the dough (for which I used half white flour / half whole wheat) and then just followed the recipe as is but brushed a light layer of milk on my loaves instead of egg yolk and they came out really crispy.  Fabulous recipe that I think I'll be doing more often!

I love this recipe and so does my man. After making it quite a few times, I discovered that AP flour works just fine. I also use Rapid Rise yeast and bumped it to 2 tsp. I live at a very high elevation, so the extra yeast works better. YUMO!

Very good. Loved the flavor of this bread. Very easy to work with too. I made small hoagie size loaves that we used for meatball subs. Yummy! I don't think I'll be buying hoagie rolls again! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great baguette recipe. The only thing I did differently is I did not brush with egg. For those of you saying the crust was not crunch. It is because you brushed with egg brushing with egg will make it look nice but wont give a crunchy crust. It will give you a more soft rubbery crust. What I did was brush with water then every so oftern while the bread is cook continue to brush with water. The water and the steam it creates makes a really crunchy. And its delishouscrust

I made this last winter to go with Sheperd's Pie.  The flavor of this was really nice.  I was a little dissapointed that it didn't have a nice crunchy crust and textured, chewy interior.  Next time I will let it slowly rise in the fridge for at least a day (my favorite local bread has a 72 hr rising time).  I'll also put a bowl of ice cubes in the oven while it's baking.  A baking stone might also help??  Great recipe, I just want to keep tweaking.

Excellent, my bread machine does the first rise on the dough cycle so I just took it out after the machine stopped kneading and put it into the greased bowl.  I did roll out the dough and roll up but I cut it into 6 pieces to make very nice baguettes sized perfectly for sandwiches and just for smearing warm butter on.  Thank you so much for this truly easy and delicious french bread.

This was THE BEST bread I have ever made, hands down. I don't have a bread maker to mix the dough, but that didn't matter. I followed all the directions precisely, except I kneaded the salt into the dough. My house smelled so wonderful as this was baking, and I've already made three loaves! (they didn't last!) My last batch, I baked in a bread pan to use for sandwiches, and when that loaf came to an end, I used the rest for French Toast, and it was the best I'd ever made! Thank you for sharing this bread, it is a winner in my house!

I loved this bread. I made it with some cheesy manicotti and it was incredible. My boyfriend's picky kids loved it which means anyone would. Perfect texture. I was scared because I didn't know if my bread machine's 'dough' cycle would be the same as everyone else's and I was afraid it would rise to much, but  it was just right,and so easy.

This bread is amazing! I have tried several baguettes recipes and this one by far tops all of them. It is simple to make and perfect texture. Nice and hard on the outside and perfect soft on the inside. I made this and then cut into halfs made a butter, olive oil, garlic spread (with added extra spice, of course. ;-)) and then put back in the oven to make a fantastic garlic bred. My kids and husband loved this bread so much they requested one more batch for the next day! We made french dips with it, again perfect results.   For sure a KEEPER!   Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe!

This is an easy recipe even without the bread machine.  I used regular flour and regular yeast and made it by hand.  It's crispy right out of the oven, but loses crispiness pretty quickly.  When I make it for company, I will reheat and hopefully that will crisp it up!

This recipe is EASY, FAST & DELISH! I first made it last night, exactly as the recipe was written.  Then I made two more loaves this morning subst. with Whole Wheat flour and didn't do the egg wash.  The baguettes were baked in our wood stove and not only do they look fabulous and rustic but they are absolutely scrumptious!  Thank you for the recipe!

Yes! Yes! Yes! My husband couldn't believe these were real and that I had made them. He now wants mass production so I will be a busy baker! Next time I will try making w/whole wheat flour to make it healthier.

I like this recipe the first time I made it. But the second time the bread seemed too heavy. So the next time i made it I added 1/2 tsp more yeast. I also allowed for the bread to rise longer after i had formed the loaves. (about 1-2 hours in a  sunny spot.) When it was time to bake them I also put a pan of boiling water in the oven for the first 10 minutes. It made the loaves much crispier.   For a sweet treat i made chocolate filled baguettes. When forming the loaves I added dark chocolate morsels, then rolled the loaves so that they had a chocolate center. They were a delightful breakfast surprise for the family.

I made this without a bread machine, and it turned out great.  The recipe is simple, and I wound up with two crunchy on the outside-soft on the inside baguettes.  Unfortunately, only one of them made it to the dinner table -- the other one was devoured before it made it off the baking sheet!  Like others, I used just an egg white wash and tossed a couple of ice cubes onto the bottom of the oven for the perfect crust.

I finally signed up for this site after friends bugging me to, and this was the first recipe I tried, and it was delicious! I changed a few things, I let the yeast stand for 12 hours and I used egg whites instead of egg yolks.

YUMM-0!!!! This was the EASIEST bread recipe I have ever made! I hate making bread, because I am no good at it. BUT THIS bread WORKED for ME! Easy! Easy! Easy! And WAY GOOD!!!! My 14 year old son picked at it when it came out of the oven, I could not keep him out of it! I do not have a bread maker so I just mixed the flour and salt together in my kitchen aid, then mixed the warm water with the yeast and sugar in a seperate bowl and let it proof. BOY DID IT PROOF! It proofed right out of the bowl. Then I added the yeast mixture to the flour mixture and then needed it and let it rise. EASY BREEZY!!! The dough was SO NICE, really different than any other dough I have ever made! Thank you SO MUCH FOR SHARING! (Oh, and I waited half way through cooking and brushed olive oil on top and sprinkled with garlic powder & put the ice on the bottom of the oven like others said)

Phenomenal!  I made these exactly as written - soooo good!  I waited about 10 minutes after they came out of the oven and then sliced them in diagonal slices, then spread a little butter over them and baked them at 350 for 5-7 minutes.  Perfect little dippers for soup!!  My husband has been asking for more everyday since I made them.  :)

Insanly awesome!!!!  How could anyone screw this one up?  And not crusty on the outside???  It couldn't be easier!

Instead of using the egg, I spayed with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic salt.  I am not a salt person at all, but the garlic salt was just right.

I'm sorry- I wanted to love it, but I found it to be just so-so.  Mine turned out kinda flat- if I tried it again, I think I might just roll them after the first rise- I think that all the rising had something to do with how flat mine were.  The flavor was ok.  Just not the best recipe I've tried.

This was an amazing recipe! I decided to make this late last night and it was so worth the 3 hours it took me! I do not have a bread machine so I proofed the yeast with the sugar in warm water for about 10-12 minutes and added the rest of the ingredients. After this I kneaded the dough and put in a well oiled bowl and waited for it to double in size and continued with the rest of the steps in the recipe and it came out sooo perfect! Very nice and soft. I wrapped it in a paper towl and placed it in a plastic bag while it was still warm and it was sooo soft and nice! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Wow, is all I can say, I guess I lucked out on finding this recipe for my first baguettes. I used the bread machine yeast without the machine. I mixed the dry ingredients together with warm water, and hand kneeded it when the dough wasn't too stickey. I kneaded it for about 6-7 minutes. and followed the rest or this recipe exactly, except for putting in the 1/4 cup of water into the oven and spritzing the oven with water every few minutes to make steam. I did use a Baguette pan that I had just bought today, I did not grease it, and turned down the temp form 375 to 355 (as the pan instructions suggest turning down 25 degrees) I figured 355 would be perfect. I did set a timer for 25 minutes, and turned the oven off when It had 5 minutes left. It came out perfect with a nice cripy crust and delicious soft chewy inside. This recipe is the only one I will need for the perfect Baguette. Thank You!

It's gloomy out and I really wanted to do something other than work.  Well, I'm on my third batch of this lovely recipe and it's not even 4:00pm! Chewy insides and perfectly crisp outside.  Seriously, just triple the recipe right away because you're going to want more.  These were all done by hand and the dough is easy to work with.  I've made a few variations - brushed melted margarine instead of an egg wash, spritzed the oven walls once or twice, I added some basil and thyme to one loaf, onions and cheese to another etc.  Very versatile recipe and sure to please.

I don't usually bother to write reviews, but felt compelled to with this one. Firstly, I have a breadmaker but my last 5 loaves have been a little dissappointing. This time I decided to go back to basics and not use a bread maker. This recipe is spot on. It really is no fail - Mine didn't rise very much so I was worried about that, but it worked out woderfully. Great texture. Very authentic recipe!

These are fantastic. I took some of the former advice: 

Used my Kitchenaid: 
1) Dissolve yeast in warm water, wisk in sugar. 
2) Add flour & use setting 2 with the dough hook for about 2 mins... dough will be sticky
3) After most stuff is off the walls, add the salt in and let it mix in... dough will still be sticky. 
4) Turn out into greased bowl and follow author's instructions. 

Last: I like my baguette crispy so I brushed with egg white wash, and I preheated to 475 and dumped a cup of water into the bottom of the oven right before putting in the bread. I then turned the oven down to 375. 

Great recipe. Nice, crispy baguette that looks and tasted great. Thank you!

This was so flingen flangen awesome! From the pictures that are posted it is obvious that many of you are very good at baking. I however....am not one of those people. But, the bread had terrific flavor, better than ANY store bought! I used sea salt, that was my only alteration. I did not use a bread machine, my wife and I made it by hand. Our bread did not get bulgy on top. It that from the yeast? Should  we let it bloom longer? Enjoy this with some pasta. Just my wife and I ate one entire loaf with the cabbage casserole I made for dinner...Thanks for the recipe! You ROCK!  UPDATE: I am making more of this bread today! I used the leftover loaf to make egg sandwiches for breakfast.mmm

I didnt use bread flour, forgot to let it rise the 2nd time and also forgot to do the egg wash and it still turned out incredible!!! I cant wait to do it correctly,lol. We absolutely loved our extra large bread sticks. They had a nice crisp outside and a wonderful soft inside. Will definitely be making these over and over!!!

A few weeks ago I made some "authentic baguettes" from France which I liked for its crispy crust but I noticed this recipe and I thought I'd try it too because it used the same ingredients but it was easier due to the breadmachine (and there was the small addition of sugar and an egg wash before baking which makes it beautifully golden).   Merging the two recipes, I think that some other reviewers are absolutely right in the idea of spritzing the oven walls with water a few times early in the baking (spritz the walls every 30 seconds for the first 2 minutes) because the steam creates a crispier crust.

This recipe ROCKS!!!! I am an accomplished cook/chef in many areas but have always steered clear of bread...just always thought it would be difficult, etc. Because it is so expensive in both the bakery & supermarket, I always assumed it meant that bread baking is a difficult art to master. 

Well, out of necessity...(my elderly mother who is diabetic, and is now in end stage renal failure, and on a severely restrictive sodium diet), I realized that if I don't make bread for her, she will buy the high sodium stuff in the store.

So, I tried this recipe tonight, and it's all I can do to keep myself from eating it all up myself. One thing I did different, and it's only because I perused at least 15 recipes prior to deciding on this one. Whenever I've purchased baguettes at the bakery, they've always had this yellow crunchy stuff on the bottom, and sprinkled on the top. One recipe I came across mentioned sprinkling cornmeal on the baking sheet before placing the baguettes on it. A lightbulb went off in my head...hahahaha

So, I went to the local health food store, and bought some pollenta/corn meal. I sprayed the baking sheet with oil., then sprinkled the sheet with the pollenta/cornmeal. I then rolled the baguettes in it. After that, I did the egg yolk wash. As a finishing touch, I lightly sprinkled some of the pollenta/corn meal on the top of each loaf. 

As I already mentioned, I've been eating it like crazy. Absolutely killed me to finally vacuum seal one loaf for my parents.

Very simple recipe and easy to knead by hand.  Nice smooth soft dough.  Made the perfect amount for sandwhiches or baguettes.  It was so chewy and airy and perfect.  I will be using this tonight for meatball subs!  Thanks for an easy tasty recipe.

Perfect! So quick and easy! I don't have a bread machine so I made it by hand following some other bread instructions, and it turned out great! Went perfect with my chicken alfredo. My husband didn't even realize it was homemade until I told him, he thought I had bought it from the bakery! I'll be making this often!

I found this recipe this morning and I decided it would be perfect for tonight's dinner. I'm pretty sure none of this is going to make it to dinner. Everyone is into it. Delicious and crusty, just perfect. I think adding a tad more salt would not be a bad idea and I did add two teaspoons Vital Wheat Gluten. 

I also suspect that adding some french herbs would enhance these loaves, for a change of pace. I did not brush the crust with egg yolk and water. I used plain water and misted the sides of my oven with water to crisp the crust. It would be even better baked on a stone, but mine broke and I've not yet replaced it.

I've made this recipe numerous times now (using my Kitchen Aid) and the bread comes out perfect every time. I used a great tip from a previous review to add the salt after the dough is formed. Also, I allways let my yeast soak in the warm water and sugar for 5-10 min before adding it to the flour. Recently, I doubled the recipe and made dough into rolls. I froze half the batch for reserves. When I defrosted them they still had their freshly baked taste!

These were just okay.  I didn't use a bread machine.  They looked really pretty, but were quite dense... maybe I didn't knead enough?  I sprinkled sea salt on the top and that was a good addition.

Mmmm, these turned out perfectly! I only had about 1.5 cups bread flour left before I ran out, so I used all-purpose for the rest. That didn't seem to affect the finished product. Nice and chewy on the inside. I made "mini-baguettes" for sandwiches instead of the long loaves.

Great!  An easy, fast recipe for simple, tasty bread.

The best thing about this recipe is that it's completely modifiable.  I used 1/3 all purpose flour, and 2/3 white-whole-wheat flour (King Arthur).  Then, when the dough was separated and rolled out, just before forming loaves, I added different spices to each loaf.

Since I increased the volume of the recipe to make more, we have four little baguettes now - one with rosemary inside and sea salt on top, one with olive tapenade inside, one with garlic, basil and oregano, and one plain.

I don't have a bread machine either, but I make sourdough varieties by hand all the time.  This one really doesn't need a bread machine.
My advice: experiment and have fun!

I made this last night to go with the meatball sandwitches from this site, and they were great! I doubled the recipe, and substituted 1 1/4 cup wheat flour for 1 1/4 cup of the bread flour. (For the rest, I used all-purpose because that's all I had.) I made 6 smaller loaves. Yummy! Still good the next day, too!

I have never made bread before and this turned out perfect.  Thanks for this recipe.  I plan on making it often.  I easily doubled the recipe in a stand mixer.  It came together perfect and I did not have any trouble rolling out the dough.  I think next time I will make smaller loaves and freeze them.

This was my first attempt at any kind of french bread.  I used all purpose flour, and regular yeast because I don't have a bread machine. It turned out great and I was so happy.  I will make this often.  It was wonderful toasted.  We used it for sub sandwiches and it was great.  I recommend it highly.

I have made these many times and they always turn out perfectly. I shape them into 6 sub-sized rolls (for sandwiches) or smaller (for dinner rolls).  My husband says that this is his favorite bread ever. Straight from the over, with a little butter, they're to die for.

Super easy and good.  You literally can have fresh baked bread in about 1 hour!  Taste just like any store bought bread.......only better!

This was very good.  Followed recipe and made 2 loafs.  Used fine ground sea salt instead of table salt.  Didn't lack any flavor. Would make gread mini loafs for sandwiches and great bread sticks.  I melted one stick of butter to 1-2 cloves of finely minced garlic and served it with lasagna.  Taste good to chopped into squares, toasted, and put in a salad.

Hands down the best homemade bread I have ever made!  This recipe is excellent!  I didn't change a single thing about it and we loved it!  I baked the bread, then cut it up in chunks and we used it for cheese fondue...amazing!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe that I will make over and over!!

Excellent! Very moist. I used AP flour instead of bread flour, and quick raise yeast instead of bread yeast. Came out nicely. A family of three ate them all.

These are wonderful baguettes. My only complaint is that the recipe is a little small - I might make double next time so they last more than a couple hours!

These are awesome! I can't tell you how many times I've made them. I like to make them when I make pasta. Just cut, dab a little butter and stick under broiler for a minute. Delicious! My mother-in-law state she didn't know why I took the time to make homemade bread when I can buy it at the store. After she tasted this, she knew why.

This is a WONDERFUL recipe!  I couldn't be happier with how the baguettes turned out.  Not only did they look great, they tasted fabulous!  This recipe even worked well at our high altitude (6000 ft.)!  No adjustments were necessary.

Take those two stars with a grain of salt.  I'm NOT a seasoned baker...so this could have been my fault.  They didn't rise enough for some reason..and turned out flat.

This makes a fantastic bread, very easy to do, too. I skip the egg, though. The bread is still plenty crunchy for me. I've made this into breadsticks as well, with italian seasonings added to the dough. I formed them and baked them on a baking stone on my grill (kettle grill, stone was raised well above the regular grill surface). They came out GREAT! At the time it was due to a power outage after my dough was kneading in the bread machine, but I may do this again this way soon.

Wow - what an EASY and great-tasting recipe!!!  I mist my loaves with water t/o baking to give them more of a chewy crust.  I also make these into sub rolls.  Be sure to watch your bread machine as it is mixing the dough...you may need to add more flour, FYI.  EVERYBODY should try this one!!!  We are going to enjoy some for dinner tonight!  And tomorrow!  And the next day!    ;0)

Easy to make and always tasty. The 1st time I did it, I thought it's too hard but it's soft inside. I used it to make bruchettas. YUM. I don't use the egg glaze.

Wonderful!  Very fast and very tasty!  I left out the sugar, and my husband & I thought that they tasted very authentic.  I forgot to brush with egg and water, and they still were great!  I'll be making these regularly from now on!

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!  I used 1c. all purpose flour and 1 1/2 c. bread flour.  I made three small loaves then braided them together.  Visually appealing and very tasty.  Did I mention this recipe is awesome?!

MMM! This is my all-time favorite baguette recipe!  I don't use the egg-glaze though.  Instead, I simply sprinkle flour over the dough.  Also, i invested in a baguette pan(around $16) at William's Sonoma and it makes all the difference in getting that perfect crust. yum!

Excellent recipe!  Although I did only use 1 tsp sugar and increased the salt to 1 1/2 tsp.  The dough should be almost sticky when it's mixed, the flour will absorb the water as it rises and will become a soft, tacky dough to shape.  I've found it easier to cut slits in the dough if I flour the top of the risen loaves.  Instead of using the egg, I brush off the excess flour on top and baste the top of the loaves with water, then add any seeds.  The water  and flour help "glue" the seeds and it  helps  the crust get crisp as it bakes.  This recipe also makes an excellent pizza crust!

No bread machine, no bread flour, NO PROBLEM! This recipe is  a winner! I double the recipe and make only 2 loaves . My family of 4 downed one loaf with a pot of homemade mushroom soup.  And we enjoyed the leftover loaf the next day.  The egg yolk was different than any other French bread recipe I've made. Most call for brushing the bread with egg white and that's what I do.

For those who bake quite a lot, (me), I'm sure that you have left over spare egg yolks and whites. I'm sure that when i make meringues and such I have left over yolks. Anyway, instead of throwing them away or cooking them for a meal, I put them in a container, add water, mix it up, and put it in the fridge as a ready-made egg wash for pie crusts and breads. Just as a tip p not to waste the egg yolks on other things and the whites here.

I made this exactly as written. I made it to the 2nd rising, and of course I forgot about the bread. Needless to say my bread had over-risen and I had a large flat blob of bubbles....Then I couldn't stop there, oh no...;) I then touched the blob to get bubbles out and it deflated more! I knew I screwed up but just couldn't help it... So I figured I would just bake it off and see what happened... I had backup, so I was cocky...:)) I baked at 400' for 25 minutes, and had a pan of water below bread for steam, refilling once during bake. I highly recommend this technique by the way; it produces great results for French bread, just don't do what I did before that step. Haha.... Anyways, can you believe this bread was STILL delicious?!?! Definitely an easy recipe, and is delicious... And it is pretty hard to mess up as illustrated above. ;) Win Win...

These turned out perfectly, exactly as described and the flavor and texture was out of this world. My husband and I ate the two loaves lickity split so I'm making another batch today. Never buying baguettes from the supermarket again.

I'll definitely make this again.  Very simple to make.  I had to add a bit of flour to get the right consistency.  Also works well with All Purpose flour.  I cut into four portions and made a cross cut on top during the second rise stage.  It made perfect loaves for sandwiches with a nice crust on the outside and very soft in the center.  Absolutely amazing.

I've made this a dozen or more times. It makes very good bread. Today I made 4 mini baguettes with a garlic cheese topping because we're having spagetti later and they worked out very well (and cute I might add).

Loved this bread. Super simple to make. Didn't use a bread machine. Dissolved the yeast in lukewarm water (110 F) + the sugar, let it sit for 5 minutes inside of microwave (off).  Poured all dry ingredients in the food processor , mixed briefly. Then, with the machine running I mixed in the wet ingredients, and let it processing until it formed a ball. Knead it a little longer, placed it in a greased container, covered it, and let it rise inside the microwave (off) for  over an hour. Followed the rest of the steps and three loaves came out beautifully. My family loved it. I am no longer buying baguette at the store. Thanks for sharingr this recipe!!!!

This bread is incredible!  I'm not a fan of french bread but discovered I needed some for another recipe.  I found several recipes that I debated between, then went with this one.  I'm so glad I did!  I used my bread machine and made a trial loaf--wow was it so much better than the store-bought.  The loaf was fairly small, so the next time I doubled the recipe and upped the crust to medium.  Perfect loaf!  Thanks for a new go-to recipe.

I was not impressed with this recipe.  It was far too dense.  I put a pan of water in the oven while the bread baked and also occasionally spritzed the oven with water which did result in a nice crust.  I will not make this again.

It was very sticky and even though I let it rise after shaping it, it still fell flat on one baguette.  The other one was very odd because of the rolling.

I found I needed a little bit more flour to make it not as sticky. But the end product was REALLY good! I actually turned the oven to 400 degrees (instead of 375) and cooked it in 17 minutes. It was beautiful golden brown and nice and soft inside. Thanks for the recipe :)

This bread was perfect!  It was a little sticky, but, after the first rise in the bowl I kneaded it a little with some flour before rolling out into the rectangle and it worked fine.  The crust was not ultra crunchy, but, it was slightly crunchy with a chewy interior which is exactly how I expect a French loaf to be. Thanks for the recipe!

Seriously, it was DENSE.  I even let it rise about 30 minutes longer on purpose.  I made a loaf with wheat bread flour, and a loaf with white all-purpose flour (the latter turned out a lot better.)
Sure, it looks pretty.  It was easy.  It tastes pretty great.  I got the crusts crustier by putting the whole egg, not just the yolk.  
But the inside?  NOT FLUFFY.  
Maybe I just don't know what REAL French bread is like, but in my mind, French bread should be fluffy!
Not making this again.

Excellent and easy to make.  I did all of it by hand instead of a bread machine, which I would recommend.  Instead of egg yolk I used egg whites and put a little garlic salt and onion powder on just before baking.  Came out delicious.

I love bread, but am VERY new to making it myself (this is my third loaf). I had a little problem with it being very watery coming out of the machine, but I added about a half cup of flour and it was saved! This is soooooo tasty.  I planned on freezing one but even my daughter who hates bread is killing it!  There will be none left within the next 30 minutes! Thank you!

I found it absolutely amazing. I did one thing different, as I was in my baking mode. I decided for a twist to braid the bread instead (cut 2 lines, even widths so you have 3 pieces, and leave 2 inches at the top uncut. Tucked and sealed. Baked it. Took me a little longer to bake, which is surprising as I am in the mountains and usually have a lesser time on baking (elevation does count). Well, lets just say I cheated and I put it all in the breadmaker on "dough" cycle. Had some fun braiding and baked in oven. To make funnier, it was only my husband and I last night, kids at grandma's. He ate 3/4 of the loaf! Keep stretching the dough out, you can bring it to the length of the pan. I greased the pan too. I use olive oil for cardiac friendly recipes :)

My oldest just returned from France as a French exchange student. She said that they had baguette with lunch and dinner everyday. She said she even saw a baguette vending machine! So, I new I wanted to find a baguette recipe that would be easy. This recipe is simple, easy and my family loves the results. The baguettes turn out soft on the inside and lightly crusty on the outside. I also love that the ingredient list is so simple. No dough enhancers, fat, and less sugar than my sandwich bread that I make. I love using my bread maker for this. I put the ingredients in the pan and put the timer on depending on how my day is looking. The bread machine does all the work. I just roll out the dough and bake it. Voila! Fresh soft delicious baguettes.

This is an awesome recipe! Like some others, I cut the dough into 3 pieces instead of two, and it worked out fine. While rolling up the 3 loaves, I really hammered on the dough to get all the air out, and it STILL came out fluffy and soft in the middle, and perfectly crunchy on the outside. Not tough at all. SO yummy!

This recipe is absolutely amazing, however, I would make a few changes!
First of all, for those who don't have a bread machine:
mix warm water with the yeast + sugar, let it sit for about 10 minutes. Then add the flour and salt and knead for about 4-5 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl and let rise for about 30-40 minutes. Then follow the rest of the recipe as recommended. 
As for the adjustment: I suggest using 2 3/4 cup bread flour and egg whites topping instead of egg yolks. This allows for a crisper crust!

Enjoy!

Easy & Tasty....I didn't use the bread machine...just did it in a mixing bowl by hand. For some variation, once the dough is rolled out spread some diced bacon, cheese and Italian herbs over it before your roll it up!

I recently bought my first bread machine.  This baguette recipe was just my second attempt.  The first was a caraway rye that was absolutely disgusting.  A million rye bread recipes out there and I picked a dud.  Anyway, the hubby asked if I could make a French baguette.  Once again, there are a million baguette recipes.   Good Grief, how do I know which one is better than another.  Well, I certainly lucked in, this one was it.  It is definitely a keeper!!!  It is better than any store bought baguette than I have ever eaten.  

My only change was to use honey instead of sugar.

This was really good bread, but the first batch was really sticky when getting it out of the bread machine. So like every other bread I've mixed/made in my bread machine my second batch got an additional 1/2 cup of flour and it turned out beautifully.  Both batches tasted wonderful just the first didn't rise quite as well as the 2nd.

Loved ... loved ... loved this!  How such beautiful simple ingredients could bake up into the most flavorful bread is beyond me!  Made in KA in under 10 minutes - times for rising are perfect - and the bread itself is delightfully chewy.  Only change was to skip the egg yolk wash (spritz sides of oven).  This is an absolute new family favorite - will be making this over and over and over again.  Thank you so much for recipe!

Probably the best bread I've ever made!  These baguettes were light and soft with a slightly chewy crust.  The egg yolk wash gives them a nice color.  Made dough in the bread machine and used active dry yeast in place of instant (bread machine) yeast.  Served with potato soup and it was the perfect combination.  Will definitely make again.

This bread came out great the second time I made it.  The first time that failed was my own fault, not realizing that the first rise was already done in my bread machine.  I added a few tablespoons flour while it was kneading in the bread machine because it looked a bit sticky, and it turned out perfectly. Made two small loaves of French bread which had a nice crust outside and a soft, chewy inside. Get the ingredients measured just right, and make sure you check on it while it kneads because humidity or the lack of it could cause you to need more flour or more water, but overall, this recipe worked very well for me.

The bread was o.k. as far as bread goes, but not really what I would consider a great baguette. No holes and too soft of an exterior. Sticking with my old tried and true baguette recipe.

Awesome and flexible.  You don't really need to do the egg wash finish.  You can, it makes a nice pretty finish, but if you don't it still tastes awesome.  This is my husband's favorite.  I try to make it often.  I usually triple the recipe, make a big fat loaf, and bake it all together.  It turns out really big, and really yummy.  :)  And I don't have a bread maker, so I just follow what one would normally do when making bread (yeast, water, and sugar first...), and follow the ingredients used here.   I've made it for parties, friends, get togethers, and it's always a hit.

WOW! Wonderful texture & taste. Dough extremely easy to work with. Best bread to come out of the machine.  Followed recipe with exception of using 2 cups bread machine flour & 1/2 cup european-style flour from King Arthur.  Did brush top with egg wash using whole egg & put pan of water in bottom of oven to steam. Going to try in a large loaf pan or round brotform.

The bread was good but there was no crunch to this crust at all, it had a very thin crust, the only crusty part was where the egg yolk was, and there was yolk all around the bottom edge of the rolls. I will keep looking for the perfect baguette.

Superb - makes excellent and tasty french bread.  Compared to store bought they taste far less salty which makes me wonder exactly how much salt the stores are using!  Plan on making these again.  Looking forward to lunch tomorrow.

Oh my gosh. Easy and DELISH! Make this, you guys! I read some people use egg white instead of the yolk, so I just whisked the whole egg plus a tsp of water. The crust was crisp and perfect!

My first attempt at a baguette, and this was a great recipe! You could easily make it without the bread machine, but I used it anyway. I baked them on a stone instead of a cookie sheet, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and was really happy with the results.

I would rate this tops for flavor and aroma of all the breads I have tried. I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of using the Kitchen Aid mixer instead of a bread maker and I made 3 baguettes instead of the 2 from the prescribed batch mix. The 4 of us consumed 2 of the 3 baguettes in one setting. Will need to try more restraint next time.

This is a great bread recipe.  I made this with my KA stand mixer.  I brushed it with egg white and placed a pan of steaming water in the rack below the bread in the oven for the first 5-10 minutes.  This gave it a crunchier crust.

I made these but didn't have enough bread flour so i threw in some all purpose... I will never pay for french bread again because these turned out so perfect. But I made them on a cookie sheet and they had to be cut apart (nobody noticed but me thou).

Lucky for me, this was the first french bread recipe I've ever tried and they came out EXCELLENT. The only thing I would change is to double it! We had none left after dinner!! Also, I couldn't wrap my brain around the rolling/shaping step, so I just rolled them out by hand, cut it in half and then just rounded out the cut end to make it look more like a loaf. Super simple, but so good. Thanks for sharing!

I don't bother with the bread machine. Instead I follow the directions of another review and proof the sugar, water, and yeast before adding the flour and salt and kneading it. From there I follow the recipe as is, though I don't always brush the egg yolk and water mixture over the top. The bread tastes wonderful either way, and my family loves it when I make this to go with dinner.

The best baguette I've ever tasted! Tender moist and delicious. As a first time bread maker, I must have to say that this recipe is a winner. I only use this recipe now when making French bread. As a matter of fact I have a batch rising now! Thank you Judy for the recipe!

With 2 cups of flour, dough was extremely sticky. Had to add much more flour to even work with it. The final result wasn't very tasty, and we didn't care for the texture.

Yep, these were actually AWESOME!! I made them with my niece tonight and she was beyond happy. I've never made better bread. I don't have a bread maker. We kneaded for 7 minutes and did the rest of the directions as stated. yummo!!!

Delicious and simple!  Didn't feel like digging the bread maker out (Not enough counter space to have it handy), so I proofed the yeast with water and sugar, mixed the salt into the flour, and combined everything in the kitchen aid with the dough hook until it came together, then 1 min, and hand kneaded for a couple more mins. The crust was more chewy than crunchy, but I like it that way.

This recipe is great! Bread is chewy and delicious.  I made 4 small loafs instead of 2 big.  Using them for sub sandwiches!

I have made this a million times - a HUGE hit with my family and oh-so easy!  I use a mixer with a dough hook.  I let the yeast proof for 5 minutes then add the rest of the ingredients and mix for about 8 minutes.  

I brush the egg wash before the second rise.  If I add it after the loaves rise, they seem to get flat!

Another thing I have done is to sprinkle seasonings on after the egg wash.  I use the seasonings you use for olive oil dips.  Wonderful.  

Oh - last thing I do.  Melt a chunk of butter with a smashed clove of garlic and dip the warm bread in the garlic butter.  Oh.  My.  Goodness!

Wow - really good!!  I didn't use a bread maker.  I just dumped the water, flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a mixing bowl. I did make sure the yeast got in the water, and I let it sit for about 10 mins. Then I mixed all together by hand to make the dough. I then turned it onto a floured surface and kneaded until no longer sticky.  Followed the recipe exactly including the egg  yolk wash. The texture is wonderful.  I like soft bread, so this was perfect!! It didn't last long, but there was a piece left the 2nd day and it tasted like a croissant and was almost as light and airy!!  Thank you so much for sharing.  I never got bread right until now!!  Will be making this often!!

I followed another commenter's instructions and put on the egg wash immediately before baking and then cut the slits using kitchen shears. This makes two smallish loaves.  I baked them on parchment on top of my baking stone. The crust was really nice and crisp. After they sit for awhile the crust gets softer. Keep this in mind when determining serving time.

I made these by hand- as I don't have a bread machine or a kitchenaid. I made the recipe yesterday as stated, with egg yolks and rolling, and again today with egg whites, and just shaping the loaves after punching down. It's SOOO much better today! I can't believe how crusty and perfect it is. I feel like a bread diva!

I've made these numerous times as both full loaves & as sandwich rolls...It's true that you do not need a bread machine as I have always made this by hand and each time they turn out perfectly.  Thank you for this recipe.

Good recipe. Hubby asked if I could add more salt, but other than that, everyone enjoyed it. I will make this again, and learn how to get my loaves 'just right'.
Thanks!

Pretty good and pretty easy. I wouldn't say it tasted like a French baguette since mine was missing that airy, holey effect inside. Instead is was a bit more dense but still light, so nothing I will complain about. My crust turned out great with the egg yolk brush. The smell of the bread when it comes out of the oven is amazing.

Wow! This was easy and so delicious-even if I do say so myself- 1st time making bread and it turned out excellent. Thank you so much for the recipe and easy to follow instructions I did take others advice and left out egg yolk to get a crunchy crust. Can't wait to make more. Anyone have any good advice for a non baker on making loaves to freeze or set aside to bake for later in the week?

Unbelievably delicious! I never imagined that this bread would turn out this good! It was the first time that I ever made french bread. I followed the recipe exactly. I don't ever see a reason to buy french bread ever again. Store bought pales in comparison. It was really easy to make!

Made two skimpy loaves but the taste was good, next time I will make one loaf.
Update: 1/8/2012, I have made these many times now and they always come out perfect and get many compliments. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a really great and basic bread. I don't use a bread maker so I used my Kitchen Aid instead with a little hand kneeding at the end. I'm giving this four stars because I feel that it's missing 'something'. I don't know what yet but I plan on making my next batch and overnight rise to see if that adds that little extra 'something' I'm looking. Great bread, though, and easy to do.

This bread tastes good but after having lived in France (the home of delicious bread!), I like a crunchier crust. The dough was also rather sticky and difficult to work with. I don't have a bread machine, so I made the bread by hand with the same measurements as the recipe.
I will try what other people have said to obtain the crunchy crust: omit the egg wash and mist the oven with water.

Even for a beginner, pretty fail proof :-)  This is my second time making it, and this time I watched some videos on technique in rolling and shaping and despite not having all the proper tools, this still makes a delicious bread.  Thank you for sharing.

This was the best french bread recipe ever! It has a nice crusty outside and soft on the inside. It tastes like Safeway's french bread. I'll never buy from the store again! It even make good sandwiches. I just cut the dough into smaller pieces and made pizza rolls and ham and cheese rolls.

This made a wonderful baguette. I was in a hurry when I made it so I left off the wash altogether. While the loaf was not as beautiful as it otherwise would have been, it tasted delicious. I will make this recipe again and again. It was easy and my family loved it. They were only disappointed that I didn't make more!

Excellent French bread recipe! Absolutely outstanding.  We are a family of bread lovers and everyone raved about it. I set the servings to 20 for a two pound bread machine and used the dough cycle.

Amazing! Very easy and delicious!
I took the advice of another review and used the egg white instead of the yoke- had a crispy outside and chewy inside

Tastes great while still warm, but tends to go stale fast.  Avoid cutting open until ready to use to keep it fresh the longest, but you really will want to bake the day you serve.

I gave it a four star because it tasted really nice and I found it easy to knead as well. However, I won't be making this again. I was disappointed with its size; not as big as I had expected. I also thought the crust was a bit too soft. I like my baguette fairly crusty and omitted the yolk as I was aware that water makes a crustier bread. But, that didn't even help out.

This recipe was extremely easy to follow. Did not have a bread machine so I did everything by hand. Had to add a little more flour, approx 1/2 to 1 cup. I added a pan of hot water to the bottom shelf of my oven before baking the baguettes. I tried one with the egg wash and one without, and I like both of them. The one with egg wash has a chewier crust than the one without, and it does not look as pretty, but they both taste good.

These were good when considering that they only take a few hours to make. I used my bread machine for the kneading (on dough cycle), brushed with an egg white coat, misted with water right before putting the loaves in the oven, and had some water boiling/releasing steam on a baking sheet on the rack below the bread as it cooked. I think I'll stick with the recipe sthat ferment overnight though; those recipes seem to have a more complex flavor.

This was my first attempt at making any type of bread and it came out excellent!  I didn't use a bread maker, just worked it for a minute or two.  I added a little more sugar as well.  Bravo!

Even though I have a bread machine, I made this bread by hand because I wanted the full experience. This recipe was perfect; I wouldn't change a THING. It yielded two gorgeous and delicious loaves that my family happily polished off within a day. They were very impressed, especially my younger brother who ate nearly an entire loaf on his own. I loved how the egg wash gave the baguettes such a lovely shine on top. Thank you for this amazing recipe which I will undoubtedly be using many times in the future!

Terrific! This tastes much better than store bought baguettes. I think I will make it into 3 next time. Since I like crispy crusts, I followed the suggestions and used only an egg white in the egg wash. I also put a pan of water at the bottom of the oven.

EXCELLENT! Made exactly as written (except for adding a little extra flour to the the dough in the machine because it was super sticky). This couldn't have been easier and they looked and tasted just like the french baguettes that I get at the store...so good! I will definatley be using this recipe often! thanks for sharing. :)

So easy! I followed the recipe exactly. It had a very nice flavor and was crispy on the outside and soft in the center. Next time I'll try adding garlic just to experiment. Great recipe!

This is the wettest dough I've ever worked with and I was sure they were going to be a disaster, but they turned out great! I couldn't get the crust crispy (skipped the egg wash and put a pan of water in the oven, but the bread is still soft), but my husband LOVES soft bread so he was thrilled. Really easy & super tasty, even the second day!

I followed reviewer Serena's method exactly and these turned out gorgeous.  I brushed the tops with the yolk mixture and it came out with a hard and golden top.  Mine was done at exactly 20 mins.  5 stars.

4stars I am using a modified version of this recipe but I am steaming my oven while baking to get the hard crust. My bread is still in the oven so I don't know if this works but I am trying it because this is what pro's recommended. I do agree that egg white is better than egg yolk though.

I really made this for my stepson who is allergic to milk and eggs (thus I omitted the egg wash in this recipe). It was so good, my stepson turned to me at dinner and said, "Can you make more right now?" I will definitely be making this recipe again. This is the bread recipe you pull out when company is coming for dinner. Excellent, excellent recipe!

This is delicious as is!  Makes one loaf of French bread or two baguettes.  Sesame seeds are a nice addition after the egg wash.

I can't believe  I made this beautiful bread! I followed the directions  and the bread is wonderful. A friend suggested putting a pie dish of water in the oven while baking the bread, this gave my bread a crisp crust and soft chewy interior.

good recipe.  We are a family of three and I end up dividing the dough into three and making medium sized round loafs (with an x cut on top) and it's just the right serving amound.  I don't grease the pan, just cook on parchment.  
They also freeze great.  Just wrap in saran wrap and then put them in a freezer zip lock.  Pull it out 30-60 minutes before you want to eat and it will be thawed and ready to be warmed.  I love slicing and drizzling the bread with olive oil and slathering with ROASTED garlic butter.  Broil till slightly crunchy and it's irrisistable!

I'm a beginner baker and this recipe made me feel like a pro!  I skipped step 2 and left the dough to rise in the breadmaker. It turned out wonderful, perfectly crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  Great recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised at how easy this was to make.  I covered the bread with plastic wrap for the second rise and tucked it under he length of each loaf which helped it keep its shape.  I served this with the Autumn Lentil Soup and it was heavenly!

Average taste for me- bread got plenty crispy, and worked well enough for french onion soup.  Probably wouldn't use it for much else, other than bread crumbs.

My 15-year old son (who loves bread) said that this one is amazing.  We made sandwiches with the leftover Christmas Honeybaked ham - they were great!  I followed the recipe exactly and was very pleased with the outcome - not a super-crusty French bread.

...first-time bread baker here :)  This is such a simple + easy recipe, which bakes perfectlyl.  I halved the recipe, as it was my first time using yeast + baking any type of bread.  No bread machine, but I let my kitchen aid do the kneading (about 5 minutes).  The only change I had to make was agave nectar in place of white sugar (as I don't have any white sugar), and using egg whites instead of egg yolk as another reviewer suggested.  So easy + delicious!!

Well, I read alot of the reviews so I tweaked the recipe a bit, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.  I did use the dough setting on my bread machine.  On my machine, this setting is 2hours long.  So I took the dough out once I heard the paddle stop,  About the 1hour mark.  Then continued to proof it in an oiled bowl.  I made 1 loaf instead of two baguettes.   I used AP Flour as that was all I had, I omitted the egg wash and brushed with olive oil during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  I cooked at a higher heat.. 425 with a small ceramic dish of water to create the steam necessary for the chewy crust.  I found my dough was a bit wet so I added a bit more flour, maybe a tablespoon?  I also proofed it for about an hour and a half for a softer interior texture.   I think one more change is necessary, cut back on the sugar a bit.  Overall I was very pleased with the final product.  I will not be paying $2.29 for a loaf at my local market again when it is that easy to make!

These are EXCELLENT! I make homemade bread all the time and this is my husband's favorite. I like to make one big loaf instead of cutting them into two. This way the slices are bigger. I also used half whole wheat last time and it turned out just as good. Top this with homemade garlic butter!

Bake this in a baguette pan with a pyrex bowl of water or ice cubes in the bottom of the oven (to add steam) for a better crust.

I've made this recipe so many times by now and it always turns out great.  I don't have a breadmaker so I just mix in the yeast, water, and sugar until the mixture gets foamy (about 10 minutes).  Then I add everything else, let it rise until it's doubled (45min-1hr), punch it down, roll it out, and roll it into baguettes.  I let them rise until they've doubled again (another 45min or so).  Then coat them with egg yolk and 1tbs water so that they turn golden brown in the oven, and I throw them in.  I tried coating them with milk once since I've heard that works as well, but they didn't look as nice.

I was surprised to see how much I disliked this bread.  To me the baguette tastes like flour and yeast, and is nothing close to the baguettes that I ate for years in Paris.  This was really unpleasant to eat.

These baguettes are just right.  I used my KA mixer instead of a bread machine.  First, I proofed my yeast with sugar and water, then added flour and salt and kneaded.  I didn't use an egg wash.  Instead, I sprayed lightly with cooking spray before baking- they browned nicely.  This was a great accompaniment to baked brie.  Thank you for the recipe, Judy.  I will use this regularly.

Nice texture bit I expected better flavor.  Nice dough to work with. Easy recipe, but I prefer baguettes from grocery store over this bread.   House smelled wonderful though.

This is a great recipe! This bread is very close in taste to authentic French baguettes. I made the recipe by hand using DivineHealth7's instructions. I halved the recipe as a test batch-it came out great and i regretted not making the full serving because I ate half the loaf straight out the oven. Definitely a keeper; I plan on using this recipe again tomorrow.

This recipe is awesome!  Very easy to make, nice texture, and delicious flavor.  I used the dough setting on my bread machine and baked the bread in the oven.  Forgot to brush on the egg and water mixture before baking and didn't even miss it, but will do it next time.  Wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  Doesn't get any easier, or any tastier, than this!

Came out perfect the first time, next time only thing I'll change is actually trying to incorporate a bit more of something to CREATE air pockets - which I love in a wonderfully dense and chewy dough such as this. Baked with the pan of water in the oven, and they came out ridiculously pretty to boot.

This is a wonderful recipe! This was my first time making bread and I was a little intimidated but it was so easy. The only thing I ended up changing was the proofing time. The first batch I made I proofed for the recommended  amount and the bread was dense inside. The second batch I made I let proof for a couple of hours and it turned out soo light and fluffy. My boyfriend is a baker and he loved it too. I will definitely be making this again.

This is now my go to bread recipe... My husband asks for very few things, but fresh made bread is one of them, and this makes it very easy on me... and it is sooo good. As others have said if you are looking for more of a brown crunchy crust then leave out the egg white and just use the yolk instead...

I can't wait to make these again! This was my first try at making baguettes and they came out perfect. I used the whole egg (instead of just the yolk) for the egg wash and put 1/4 cup of water on the bottom of the stove right before putting the bread in. I got a light crispy crust that was just right. Next time I might add 1/2 tsp more salt, or just sprinkle a tiny bit on the dough before rolling it up. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Lovely loaves.   Crust can be made more crunchy by baking with a bowl of water

We are really picky about  our bread and this couldn't have been easier. I put the ingredients in the bread maker on  the dough setting. Once it was ready, I rolled it out into baguette shapes and let it rise for 30 minutes, then put it in the oven. My boys (5 & 7) loved it and my husband told me that he didn't want me to ever buy store bread again!

I have made this many many times since I found this recipe because it is quick to mix up and yields two decent size "baguettes".  While this is good bread, I find the texture is off from what a real baguette should be, as well as the crust.  I will continue to make it for bread, but will continue my search for a more realistic baguette.  Thanks for sharing!

I didn't really like this bread.  It was easy enough, and it looked nice, but it was so bland.  I ended up just using it in stuffing and it was good like that.

Excellent! I've prepared this recipe a few times and it always comes out great. The dough is a little sticky when it comes out of the bread machine but I dont bother adding flour. I dump it in a greased bowl and follow instructions. I have divided the dough on 3 and 4 smaller baguettes. They look pretty and are more convenient to serve/UPDATE: I know there's some people out there that cannot tolerate gluten but for the rest of us: Add 4 tsp of wheat gluten with the dry ingredients and you'll never go back!! The textured improved tremendously and the bread lasts longer. MMM!!!

The consistency and crust are phenomenal! The taste seems to be missing a little something, so I will play with that next time - but there will definately be a next time!

I am so glad I tried this, I don't know the difference between french bread and french baguettes but this was better than the french bread you buy at the store. I followed the recipe exactly except adding some ice cubes to the bottom of the oven before baking. This to me had the perfect french bread texture, I think bread flour really makes a difference. I usually just use ap flour for breads but i finally bought some bread flour and I am glad i did. not hard to roll out at all (and Im pretty bad at rolling out dough) My first batch was for some reason less stick than my next two batches but even the sticky ones weren't too sticky. Thanks for a great recipe!

I don't have a bread maker either.  I mixed the liquids with one packet fleishmann's rapid-rise yeast, let it get foamy, then added 2cups all purpose flour and salt and mixed.  Then kneeded in bread flour until no longer sticky.  Then let rise in oven at 100degrees until poking it leaves indent.  Then pounded it down, cut in half, rolled out to baguette shape, made slits on top, brushed with 1egg WHITE and 1tbsp water.  (I did allow to rise more before brushing with egg etc. because I live in Denver and stuff rises like crazy here.)  Baked ~23min.  Was awesome.

Great recipe! I didn't brush with the egg, but rather baked with a pan of water in the lower oven rack, and then basted with a little butter when it came out of the oven. I do think that the recipe needs more flour (I had to add about 1/4c, and it still wasn't enough - the bread was really sticky coming out of the bread machine).
EDIT: I have made this quite a few times, and always wondered what I was doing wrong. I finally figured it out - this recipe says to set for the dough cycle, which on most machines INCLUDES a final rise cycle. Looking at the time to make this bread of 1 hour 50 min, the author of this recipe is assuming your bread machine doesn't do the rise on the dough cycle. Otherwise, the time needed would be 1:30 for bread machine, 30 min rise, 30-40 min rise after rolling/shaping, and then baking time which doesn't add up. So, if using a bread machine, stop it before it does the final rise OR skip the rise in greased bowl for 30 min portion of this recipe.

These baguettes were wonderful.  I didn't expect them to be classically french looking or tasting (which they weren't exactly) but they were very close, and very good.  I didn't use a bread machine for this recipe.  Instead, I mixed the yeast, water, and sugar together and let that proof for a few minutes on the counter.  I added the bread flour once the yeast mixture was foamy, and continued to knead.  The dough seemed a little dry but ultimately came together.  Another reviewer suggested adding the salt after the first rise, which I intended to do, but forgot! Oops!  So I had salt-less bread, but it was still delicious nonetheless.  I will definitely make this recipe again, and next time, I'm sure it will be even better if I don't forget the salt!

Very tasty - made by hand. I do not know what 'bread machine yeast' is, just used regular yeast. It's funny - every time I make fresh bread, DH is so impressed and cannot eat it fast enough. Even tries to sneak a slice (how does one cut a loaf without someone noticing?) :D

I made these without using a bread machine and they turned out DELICIOUS!!! I don't own a bread machine and don't want one... I love making it the old fashion way... Excellent recipe!

I have made this a couple of times and have only changed on thing and that is the salt, I use about 1/2 to 3/4 tsp, as I don't care for salt... This is so easy to make, and can be whipped up in no time at all.... Love it, Love it, Love it!!!!!!!!!!!! Slice it lengthwise and make a grilled cheese sandwich out of it... I use provolone & pepper jack, it's so good it makes you want to slap your Mama!

This bread was nothing like real French bread from a serious bakery.   It had a soft crust, and was light and fluffy.  not my cup of tea.  It was more or less like an extra-long white bread roll from the supermaket. Boring.  Looks pretty, though.

I have made this countless times and it is always a hit! I usually double the recipe and make it into a circle shape and bake it on a pizza stone! I just use regular AP flour and don't do the egg wash (just bake it in the oven with a pan on water)

After practicing this recipe multiple times, I found that changing the flour amount to 3 cups (starting with two and slowly adding the third during the knead) this bread is pretty darn good. It's still touch and go, however.  This is not for the baking novice, for sure!

Very crunchy on the outside, but light and chewy on the inside.  Yum!  We enjoyed this very much.  I used a whole egg instead of the yolk b/c I'm lazy.  Also when it was baking, I added a pan of water under the bread.

Yum!  This bread was fantastic and the wonderful smell of fresh bread baking in the oven made it hard to wait!  I didn't feel like pulling out the bread machine, so mixed and kneaded by hand.  Even my husband, who is not a big bread fan liked it!  This is definitely a keeper.

I wasn't impressed with these at all.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I make bread alot and these really didn't taste good.I will not be making these again.  The only thing I liked was how easy they were to make.

I made mine by hand, and added some dehydrated onions. This is very, very good bread. The recipe as written made 2 smallish loaves for me, but the dough was easy to work with. I'll certainly use this one again and likely use it for regular French bread, as well. Thanks!

I even screwed this recipe up by adding more salt than called for. It was too late to really fix it so I thought I'd go ahead and finish it and it still tasted fantastic! Love my bread making machine & this recipe.

i liked this but the bread had very little flavor i should add a little more salt and sugar next time. and then when they came out the oven they smelled eggy and the crust had the disgusting taste too. next time i will use the whole egg rather than just the yolk. i will make again but with a few changes

This would have been AWESOME if I had remembered to put the salt in. :) I did as a few others suggested and used the whole egg instead of just the yolk to brush over loaves before baking. I also followed the suggestion of pouring a cup of water in the bottom of the oven about 10 minutes into baking and the crust turned out GREAT! Great recipe & next time I'll remember the salt. :)

Wonderful and easy to make.  I also used the same recipie for a loaf of bread in my bread machine (I wanted the bread but didn't have time to make the baguettes) and it worked very well.

This was absolutely delicious! I did everything by hand, left out the egg wash and sprinkled with a tiny bit of kosher salt! Crust turned out nice and crispy while the inside stayed soft and moist!!! I will definitely be making this again, but will probably add about 2 tsp each of Italian seasoning and rosemary to make make herbed bread! Yummy!!!

This is the first baguette recipe I've found that I really like.  Doesn't really seem to require the bread machine, I've made it without, along with omitting the egg yolk for brushing.  I believe the sugar is a key to the taste.  Each baguette turned out to be around a foot long.  Dough doesn't freeze well so you have to bake it on the same day.

After reading reviews I had such high hopes for this recipe, alas, it was not to be. The dough was extremely sticky and despite adding almost 2 extra cups of flour impossible to work with. The loaves did not rise tall but seemed to spread out making it very flat.

DELICIOUS!  I made a few changes, but I'm sure these would be great as-is, too.  I substituted 1 cup of whole wheat bread flour and 1/4 cup of ground flax meal for part of the flour.  Because I was using part whole wheat flour, I also added some vital wheat gluten to make sure the dough would rise properly and the bread would be soft.  I also kneaded in some garlic powder (about 1-1/2 Tbs).  It didn't really give it a very strong garlic flavor, though, so next time I'll try adding roasted garlic cloves instead.  I made five individual-sized baguettes instead of two larger ones.  Even my father, who usually will ONLY eat white bread, loved these made more healthy.

Probably the best recipe out there in terms of quality. Very good, everyone was impressed.  But instead of water and egg white glaze: mix one egg yolk, 1 Tbs. Apricot Jam (for slight flavor), and 1 Tbs. Milk. Glaze the whole loaf before baking with this, and the color will be delightfully golden, the crust crispy.

First, let me say that one should always make a recipe exactly as written the first time, then make changes as desired on subsequent attempts.  I should have taken my own advice!  I have never made baguettes before (eventhough I make bread quite often), and I had a bit of a tough time with the rolling and shaping, so my loaves were more "fat" than long.  Make them really long and really skinny as they do rise quite a bit.  Also, make the diagonal slashes (not straight down the middle) and follow the recipe's glaze (yolk/water) if you want a really brown crust.  I made mine with just egg white and while it was crispy, it wasn't very brown.  Great flavor and I hope that my future attempts yield *perfect* looking baguettes!

Such a superior yet simple recipe. I think I have this recipe perfected. One thing I did was add just a ts. of cider vineger. It probably did not make a big difference but it certainly did not hurt. The trick to this bread and to an amazing crust is instead of the egg wash (Yes I know the egg wash is a classic) brush some olive oil over your bread about every five minutes it is in the oven. You can use melted better instead but I really prefer the olive oil. I usually put fresh garlic cloves and whole pepper corn in my olive oil for a few days wich gives it a great flavor, but this definately is not neccessary. Anyways, the result is a an unbelievable flaky crispy crust. Now I would reccomend trying this bread in it's tradition form, but I have been playing with the recipe a bit and have found that mixing some grated jalepenos in with the dough and then adding some chedder or colby/ monterey jack to the center of the formed dough just before the last rise is amazingly good.

I made one large baguette w/ this recipe for french dip sandwiches. Didn't change anything and it was great! It fed my husband and two teenagers. Next time I'll try to make the recipe 50% larger so that I and the rest of our family can enjoy it too!

Delicious!  My family has never finished up loaves of bread within minutes before.  They turned out beautifully.  My shaping skills could improve some but hey, they were gone so fast I barely got enough time to take a picture.  I followed the recipe except for using the egg white instead of the egg yolk.  Fantastic!

This ones a keeper!! It was gone in no time. Thnaks Great recipe. But if you add a little garlic its just that much better. Also, when you roll up the bread, you can put mazzeralla cheese in the layers. It may bust out, but the taste is worth it. One more thing, withe the egg wash, if butter is added it will make a nice golden brown tent.

Fantastic!! I used a Kitchenaid mixer and followed the advice of adding the salt later in the recipe and put 1/4 cup of water in the oven as it baked. Loved the chewy crust. I think one of the suggestions says to bake immediately and eliminate the 2nd rising process (perhaps I misunderstood). I did this and although the bread was truly wonderful, you could see each layer of rolled dough in the finished process. I did not like that so I will let it rise a second time to see if that fixes that problem. It's been dubbed 'my best bread ever'.

This bread was delicious!  My first time making a french bread, advice for first timers: when you roll out the dough, get it right the first time because you can just squish it back into a ball and reroll it, it won't stretch out the same as when you do it the first time.  Awesome bread, making again today.

Do not use egg yolk!!!

The recipe tastes great, except for the egg yolk, which was bitter and smelly. It even smelled bad during baking. Instead, I use egg white and I include a pan of hot water in the oven while baking. The second loaf I made without the egg yolk was wonderful.

This is absolutely stunning!!!  I have been baking bread for a number of  years and this is by far the tastiest loaf - wonderful texture and a delicious crust.  Be careful not to let this over-rise.  Not sure why mind did the first few times (it does raise up quick).  Even though it was not too attractive, it was still delicious.

Really really good recipe!  I didn't have bread flour or bread machine yeast so used regular white flour with a packet of dry yeast.  I do agree that the dough was a bit sticky, so I added about 1/2 cup of flour which seemed to do the trick. I've made these 3 times so far, the first time the basic recipe, and the other time I experimented without the egg wash and different savory herbs. Tonight I added 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 minced shallot, and about a 1/2 tb of thyme and it was AWESOME! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it's definitely my new staple baguette recipe!

Only substitution I made was replace 1/2 cup of bread flour with 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.  The bread is FANTASTIC!  Everything else I did was as directed and I baked for 20 min.  Thanks for this delicious and easy recipe!

This recipie is great! I don't use a bread machine and used the suggestions of brushing with egg white + water only and putting a tray with a 1/4 cup of water in the oven while the bread bakes. It turns out perfectly everytime!!

Awesome! Very soft, which I wanted to make French Dip sandwhiches.  They tasted incredible.  Very easy.  I made 4 small baguettes.  One of the kids said 5 times during dinner how much they loved them.

I had to write a second review for this bread.  We make it at least 3 times a week now.  I use my kitchen aid to mix it and it comes out superb!  We also make them into sesame and poppy seed rolls.  

Fool proof recipe if you follow the directions.  Thanks for sharing it.

Delicious. I didn't think it could taste so good! I've never been super impressed with my homemade breads until this. I didn't use a machine, and I used all-purpose flour, and it still had the perfect soft chewy consistency. I know I rolled them too loosely, and this is why they flattened a little, but this is a fantastic simple recipe for perfect French bread. Thank you.

Awesome, awesome recipe!  I only make it with King Arthur flour (in the blue & white bag).  I also replace the egg yolk & water step with 1 tablespoon of melted butter brushed on top after the last rising & before baking.  Great with some homemade soup (or anything else!)

This is a no fail bread.  I have made it a dozen times and it has always turned out perfectly.

I use the dough cycle on my bread machine to mix the ingredients and then place it in a greased bowl covered by a dish towel in a warm place to rise.

After brushing on the egg yolk and before placing in the oven, I like to grind some coarse sea salt on top (sometimes some spices to compliment the meal, as well).

Very tasty and I didn't even use a bread machine. Made bread for the "Double Tomato Bruschetta" and it tasted wonderful. Next time I would bake for about 5 minutes less because the bottom burned.

WOW!  I've tried so many recipes, and this one AS IS made a the perfect French Baguette.  I only misted the inside of the oven with cold water once and baked on a stone.  I didn't brush it with any egg because it didn't need it - it turned golden brown beautifully.  I did follow one user's suggestion and added the salt after the first rise.  I also kneaded the bread by hand as I don't have a bread machine.  I divided the dough into 3 to make 3 8-10 inch baguettes, the other 2 in the freezer for another day.  

I won't need another french bread recipe ever again, I'm sticking with this one :)

I seldom rate recipes but read a lot of the reviews.  I made this bread yesterday and I hate to admit, it's gone already!  I made one long loaf and followed the recipe near exactly.  I was always taught to proof the yeast first and add salt after 5 minutes of kneading with my Mixmaster, then finish kneading.  I also beat 3 whole eggs for the brushing, then cook the leftover eggs.  Why waste the egg? Heh...  The loaf I'm making today(yes, another loaf)I'm going to go a little heavier on the sugar(2TBS) and salt(1-1/2 tsp) and see how that works.  Otherwise it's a great recipe for bread and a good base for Garlic bread, French toast, and croutons.  I'm glad I found this one

I have been trying many different bread recipes, which most came out pretty good. However, nothing came out nearly as good as this one! It was a huge hit at the family gathering on Sunday. Some were eating my bread with cheese instead of anything else that was for dinner on the table! They are easy to make. Used a food processor to make the dough, cuz I don't have a bread machine. Still came out perfect! Bloomed the yeast in the bowl of the processor with warm water and sugar, then added the rest of the ingredients. Let the dough rise twice,  and baked as instructed. Looks great, tastes great, and my dad even said they taste better than at the stores!!
Thanks so much for that awesome recipe!

I made this bread yesterday and it was fabulous. I made 4 small baguettes out of the dough for sandwiches. Today, the crust is soft and chewy but I wanted a crusty bread for my sandwich so I just reheat it in the oven at 350 for 5 minutes. Perfect!  The crust is delicately crunchy and the crumb on the inside is tender but soft.  Tastes excellent as well and so easy to make.  The flour and water ratio is just perfect.  Thank you for posting it.

I really like the texture of this bread - it's moist, dense but not too dense, and has a good flavor. I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used an egg white wash (no yolk), since I like a crispy crust, and I poured a small amount of water on the bottom of my oven for the steam effect. Very good recipe. Thanks!

Very good! I made this by hand and it came out soft and chewy. Add the salt after mixing and only need knead the dough for a couple of minutes. 

Mist the oven and place the baguettes in a oven preheated to 425 degrees and reduce temp to 375 after 2-3 minutes. Internal Temp should be 200 degrees before removing from oven...

These were so good my boyfriend and I made two more loaves the next day and brought them over to my sister's for dinner. They ate them all up too! The baguettes go great with meatballs and marinara. This is a recipe for the books!

Great recipe!!  When I made it the first time it was a little more airy than what I get in France, but the flavor is great.  Before baking, I also sprinkle kosher salt on the top (not a lot).  I also put a small pan with boiling water in the oven before I put the loaves in.  This recipe is also great for sub (hoagie) rolls and dinner rolls.  It serves many purposes as the French bakers know.

This recipe is amazing.  I did cut the dough into eight smaller pieces before popping them into the oven.  I have a large family and this way I had individual servings for everyone.  I also baked them on stoneware lightly sprayed with butter flavored crisco.  Perfect!!

Good Baguettes, I made in my Kitchen Aide mixer instead of bread machine.  It took more flour than recipe said though.

Fabulous bread.  I always thought I needed a special pan for french loaves.  This turned out great.  I used a Kitchen Aide mixer, doubled the recipe, and used the dough hook for the last 2 cups of flour.  (Actually, I left out approx. 1/2 cup - the dough seemed stiff enough)  I'll be making this many times over.

This is the french bread I have been looking for! I make all my family's bread and for years I have been trying to get french bread to have those characteristic uneven holes in it, finally I have done it. As another reviewer suggested, I mixed the dough, waited 15 minutes and then added the salt and finished kneading. The dough was amazingly silky even with part whole wheat flour. One tip to get the beautiful cuts on your loaf is to hold a sharp knife parallel with the countertop and make long slashes lengthwise on the loaf, about 3 should do it. When it bakes the bread will kind of burst out of the slashes just like baguettes from those expensive bakeries. I also tried this dough to make hamburgers buns and they were delicious, soft and chewy. It made 8 nice sized buns. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I love this recipe!  I'm a bread lover and I made this recipe twice this weekend.  I don't always do the egg wash in the end b/c I don't want to waste the whites.  It's not as pretty but tastes the same to me.  Also if you spritz the oven walls with water when you put the bread in it makes a crispier crust.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really tasty!!!  It was very easy to make.  I made 1 big one but I noticed that I could still see the layers from when I rolled it?  Is that normal?  I think I cut my slits a bit too deep, maybe that had something to do with it?  I will be making this again really soon.  Thanks for the great recipe  :o)

I'm giving this a 5 because the taste was WONDERFUL  BUT, not sure what happened.  I pulled the risen bread out to do the egg wash on it and to put it in the oven and it fell!!!!! It was only as high as biscotti.  Will try again simply because of the taste but not sure why it fell moving from the warm rising place.

I was given many compliments on this bread.  I doubled the recipe, used one cup whole wheat flour instead of bread flour, and rubbed the tops with butter when they first came out of the oven instead of using egg.  I would recommend doubling the recipe and making only two loaves or making one loaf from the recipe.  The loaves tend to be very small if you don't.

Although not a hard crusted recipe for a traditional baguette, these loaves had easy to work with dough (did not use the bread machine), and the texture was light and airy.  Nice!

Great bread.  I let it rise in the bread machine rather than a metal bowl - seemed fine.  I also let the air bubbles remain in the dough for a more authentic texture, and baked it with a bowl of preheated water in the oven for a crustier crust.  It's not just like what you would buy from a bakery in Paris, but it is an easy and vey respectable substitute.

I've made 3 baguettes a day for many months now using this excellent recipe.  My family loves it!
A few tips to consider-- to punch down the dough,  just re-start the machine to knead for about a minute, then unplug the machine. Then let the dough rest for 6-10 minutes inside the bread machine. This relaxes the dough and makes it much more pliable for easy rolling. 
Another little tip if you make bread often is to grease one side of a large piece of plastic wrap, to cover the loaves as they rise again. You can save the plastic wrap to re-use the next time by folding the greasy side in and tucking it into the freezer.
Also if you make this daily you can mix the egg yoke in a baggie or a small jar, to keep in the fridge to get two batches out of each egg. I just use my clean fingers to paint it on the loaves before baking. 
We like a crusty loaf so I bake at 410 degrees for 19 minutes, spraying the inside walls of the hot oven with water just beforehand, avoiding the light and the heating element.
Lastly, to keep the crusts from going soft, I store the cooled loaves in paper bags.

More work than it sounds like when you read it, but definately worth it. Took longer than stated to rise. Hard to roll out nice rectangles. Tasted great though, and great texture. Next day it wasn't nearly as good though

This bread turned out beautifully, and what a simple recipe! I was using this for a garlic pesto bread, so when the dough was rolled out flat on the counter, I smeared roasted garlic all over it. That added a very subtle garlic flavor, and was a huge hit with my family. Yes, I too will be using this recipe over and over.

These turned out so well I couldn't believe it came out of my oven. I didn't use a bread machine, and it is definitely not important to use one. By the pictures shown, I shaped my baguettes much thinner, and I think they turned out better for it. I didn't have anything but a cookie sheet to raise and bake them on, either, and they still came out perfect, with a crusty outside and a chewy inside.

I'm giving 5 stars even though mine fell flat also, because the flavor was great.  I set a pan of water in the oven, and that made the crust perfect.  I have to work on my methods though.  Maybe I'll try to skip the egg wash, because that's when mine fell.

Just got a bread machine and this is the first recipe I've tried.  I've made this twice and my loaves have sunk after brushing on the egg wash both times.  I'm still rating it 5 starts because it still tasted great!  I will work on my technique and my goal is to match the pictures.  I added sesame seeds and liked that more than the plain.

I have been making bread for years.  First time I have seen my husband eat more than a slice.  He ate a 1 1/2 loafs and he is not a bread eater.  This is definitely a keeper.  Can't wait to make it for a fellow bread lover that is coming to visit me next weekend.  Thanks so much!!!!!

A nice alternative to the grocery bakery in a pinch.  Easy and tasty.  Didn't give it 5 stars since it is not quite as good as bakery bread.

Ok, these were delicious. My husband has never commented on any other homemade bread that I have made, but he raved about these baquettes. This recipe is a keeper and will go into my permanent file. I used my bread machine on the dough cycle which has a couple of rising and kneading sessions. I followed the ingredients exactly but messed up the rising and kneading by forgetting about them and letting them rise for hours in the machine after the dough cycle had finished. I had to knead them again and let them rise again before baking and also forgot to brush them with egg.  They still turned out beautiful and delicious.

These are awesome! I made them twice this week and both times they were gone in a day! Excellent dipped in an olive oil and balsamic vinegar mixture (can you tell I'm Italian?) The only change I made was to use egg whites instead of yolk to brush the tops the second time around, it made the loaves just a bit crustier on top, but I like them either way.

UNBELIEVABLY GOOD! I made it exactly as the recipe directed and it was the best bread I've ever made in my machine. Great crust, moist and chewy on the inside. I dunked some in soup and dipped some in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I will make this over and over. Thank u so much for this recipe!

Great Bread!  I have a new bread machine and this recipe worked great!  I followed the recipe exactly but I did have to use a little extra flour as the dough was very sticky.  The bread turned out wonderfully.  It was nice and crusty on the outside and tender on the inside.  Sliced on the diagonal, it made very good garlic toast.

Wow! It is so good! I didn't use a bread machine and it probably could have baked a tad longer (gave 20min), but it is still good. I made one large loaf and it is being eaten up already!

This was a great way to use the bread machine.  The loaves looked beautiful and tasted great.  No more difficult than popping pre-made in the oven to brown - well, almost!

I just made this recipe for the 2nd time.  It has to be fool-proof.  Both times I've made a dump mistake and the bread turned out absolutely delicious.  It has so few ingredients.  I did add 1/8 tesp. of garlic powder to the dough and sprinkled a little Kosher salt after the yolk wash.  Very easy - very good!

These were very easy to make and very good.  We added roasted garlic when we were rolling them up.  Be careful doing this as you will want to make them all the time.

Very easy recipe that makes exquisite baguettes or subs!. Just prepare it in the morning and you can enjoy it sub sandwich lunch. I love it. One portion isn't enough for hungry tummies. I make 4 slim subs with each portion brushed with honey water.

We liked this bread for what it is - nice loaves of bread.  But it doesn't compare with French baguettes.  This was much softer and the crust wasn't as crunchy.  I feel that this dough is really tight - when I make it next time I may add a bit more water.  A nice bread.

Super-easy and YUMMY. I used all purpose flour, traditional yeast, (and the dough cycle in my bread machine) and they were still awesome.  Hubby and I just devoured a whole loaf!  Can't wait to make sub sandwiches or top off a french onion soup! Will try with multi-grain flour next time. Thanks for sharing!

Pretty darn good bread. I was impressed with how good it tasted. I need to work on my shaping technique. They weren't perfectly shaped. But it tasted pretty perfect. My family loved it with garlic butter.

Wonderful recipe!  I've made this a couple of times and the loaves of bread are gone SO fast.  Recently, I doubled the recipe for company, had four loaves of bread sitting on the table, and it was still gone fast.  I gave it a four, just because I've had a little trouble keeping the bread from burning on the bottom before it's done - other than that they turn out beautifully each time.

Exceptional french bread! It makes two loafs and my kids had it all scarfed down before my husband or I could get a second piece. Obviously this will be a regular bread on our table. :-)

This is a fantastic recipe.  It takes very little attention from you to get it done and turns out with a nice crispy crust and soft chewy interior.  I made three loaves from this recipe and sprinkled one with garlic salt on top of the egg wash. Parmesan cheese or other herbs would be good as well. Thanks for this easy and inexpensive recipe!

Absolutely excellent!! I omitted the sugar as suggested by an earlier review. I also tried using the egg whites and egg yolks- just to see. The yolk made a crunchier crust- but they were both excellent. I've made it many times over the past week- my husband loves it & it is so easy!!!

I also used the oven misting method, but skipped the brushing of egg whites. Other than that, followed the instructions as written. Loved the crust, and tasted wonderful fresh out of the oven. I am especially pleased that all of the ingredients needed are things that I always have on hand. No need to make a special trip to the grocery store!

Made these and it was my first batch of baguettes ever out of my machine. So nice. So yummy!!!! I did use 3 cups bread flour sifted. And forgot the egg wash... I slashed them down the middle and had a steam pan in the oven with them as they baked at 405 for 25 mins. They did split a little so they may not have had enough time to rise. But still looked pretty, had a great crust, were soft and completely cooked and tasted amazing !

I made this recipe a few years ago and remembered they were really good, but since then I've become a better bread baker and tried them again.   The recipe is REALLY easy to made with very few ingredients.  After tasting them again I don't think they are the be-all end-all baguettes.   They risings were successful and they came out looking beautiful.   I think the taste is just a little bland, more like regular white bread you get at the store.  I would reduce the salt just a tad in these,  but then that would probably make them more bland.  No waste, they will be eaten and it was fun to make them but will be trying out other baguette recipes.

Turned out awesome! I am so stoked!! I skipped the egg wash and baked at 450 with a bowl of water in the oven (to add some humidity, as suggested by another reviewer), removed the water bowl after 15 min. and then baked another 5 min. Made it nice and crispy on the outside!

Best french bread recipe I've found yet! I subbed the egg yolk with powdered vegan egg replacer and it turned out perfect. Recipe saved.

I did. not use a bread machine and used an Emile Henry Baguette baker...  I used the recipe as it is written just baked 5 minutes longer with the lid off.  Very tasty and light... I'm going to bake at 400 next time or about 10 minutes longer for a little more crispy crust

I didn't do the egg wash - instead I sprinkled a little bit of flour on top so that I could make the slashes on the bread more easily. It's a favorite in my household!

Turned out delicious. I'm still trying to figure out how to make a thicker crust on the bread (yes I have used the ice cube trick). I doubled the recipe this time and produced 4 large sandwich roles. It's delicious and I didn't even need a bread maker.

Not to be redundant....but wow. The flavor on these are amazing. I made mine completely in my kitchen aid stand mixed. Piece of cake. Allowed the yeast to proof with water and sugar. Mixed with the dry ingredients just til combined then switched to the dough hook. Mixed again til completely pulled away from the side and then followed the directions afterward. Made 3 baguettes. Served with chicken francaise which my kids barely touched because they wouldn’t stop eating the baguettes. What’s a wonderfully easy recipe!! Thank u!!

Followed the recipe as written with one exception. I made it as one loaf instead of 2. It turned out beautifully. This recipe is a keeper.

I doubled this recipe and made 2 -20x4" loaves to go along side hot spinach dip for a party tonight . They look and taste amazing . I also baked on parchment paper & only for 15 min , 20 would of made bread darker and a bit more crunchy for what I wanted it for . I made one with parm , garlic salt & Italian seasoning & drizzled with Olive Oil & the other plain ( for grandkids )

Absolutely brilliant. I brushed one with the egg yolk and the other with egg white. Both turned out the same golden crusted baguette.
I did find the dough was a little sticky but a dusting of flour did the trick.
Have made them twice now and exellent baguettes both times. We will definatley keep this recipe and continue making them.

Easy to follow recipe! The bread turned out awesome. I might try three small loaves the next time but I personally wouldn’t change a thing for this recipe. Also for those who find bread making intimidating. This is the first loaf of bread I’ve made in quite a long time!

I've made this twice now. The second time I just rolled it into one big loaf. When I put the egg wash on it, I sprinkle a little sea salt and rosemary on top. This is such an easy, delicious, foolproof recipe it's hard for me to believe I haven't been making this for years. I've already memorized the recipe and the bread has everyone who's tried it asking me to make more. I've tried a couple other baguette recipes, but this is the one that I will be sticking with. We all thank you for sharing it!

This bread was great. It was easy to make and my boyfriend asked where I bought the bread. When I told him I made it he didn't believe me. It's that good. Served with homemade Pasta Fagioli made a hearty, satisfying Fall dinner. Would also be great with any homemade pasta dinner, soup, or salad.

I loved the recipe. It was all gone half way through the dinner! 
Super easy to make as well.
I doubled the quantities and left the other half in the fridge to bake it on the following day,  no problems at all!

Excellent bread, but I wouldn't say its a french baguette.  The crust wasn't like it and the center is very soft.  I love it though, just tastes more like a roll than a french baguette, it was a success at home!

I also used 3C and ended up sprinkling a touch more into the machine as it kneaded during the initial kneading. I haven't used the egg wash because the loaves turned out soft on the inside and the crust is the perfect crispness. It goes with any dish! Sometimes I cut it in half for a giant sandwich and sometimes slice it thinly for snack sandwiches or a nice olive oil and seasoning dip

This worked well for me and my family loved it. I got a crispy outside and perfectly soft inside. I did the entire dough cycle in my machine then baked it! I also used the egg white and water for the crust before baking in the oven. I don’t like how the machine bakes. 
This recipe made two smaller baguettes. I would recommend doubling it if you have a family that really loves bread and you want any leftovers after dinner.

Have made this so many times.I do not use bread machine.
Simply proof yeast and sugar in 1c. warm water. Put flour and salt in bowl. Mix in yeast and sugar with hand mixer(dough hooks)Follow recipe after that. Quick and never  lets me down.

Really yummy, simple, and not too hard to make. I used a Kitchen Aid, proofed the yeast, used the hook for kneading ~ 2 min once it was combined (on speed #2). I tried it with all purpose flour and it was a little flat. Tried again with bread flour and it worked better. I'm at high altitude, so that might have something to do with it.

yup i did it again... this time one with rosemary/garlic and oregano and the other one was 2 cheese, fresh parmigiano and strong cheddar... it was better than the first try,,, if its possible.  Used those to make Lamb burger buns ... how cool is that!!

i will certainly make it again and sonner than later...

like i saw on another user comment...  to prevent food waste, use the egg yolk with the water in the dough prep.  Use the white part to brush the dough.   Sprinkled the dough with sesame, garlic, parmesano, oregano and sprayed the bread with water to keep moister.    cooked the bread 400F 25 min.  
Has a great texture, great flavor... kids loved it and ask for more.

This was very good, mixed as recipe stated. Mixed in bread maker using the dough cycle, letting it rise once in bread machine. Then once it was made into loaves, it only had to rise once. Sometimes I use the egg wash but it turns out great either way! And this time I doubled the recipe so got 4 baguettes!! Love it, thank you!!! Note: lately I’ve been using the egg wash and sprinkling a bit of coarse salt on the tops before final rising. Adds that extra YUMM!

This is my first effort making French baguettes.  I don't have a bread machine, so I did the mixing by hand.  Which I think is a good thing because I read in other recipes online a bread machine over mixes it.  (I don't know if that's true)  We had some as it was cooling and it was perfect.  My only change of the recipe was using honey instead of sugar. I'll try it with sugar next time-not convinced there was much difference in flavor between them after baking.  Two things I did add to the baking method were a baking stone and a "steam" method in my gas oven.  I had a metal pan next to the bread  and tossed in ice cubes from time to time.  I sprayed the inside with water 5 times too.  I read using a heated baking stone is helpful (and French apparently)  I used my Emile Henry pizza stone because it makes great pizza crust so I figured it may as well be used for bread too.  I really liked the results and will use this recipe again.

Delicious! I have used this recipe quite a few times and they always come out great! I don't have a bread machine so I just knead it with my hands; it comes out exceptional either way!

Stale bread hack: When your bread gets stale, just soak it in water then crisp it up and the oven! It's as good as new! 

Thank you so so much for this amazing recipe!

I made this with the dough setting on my bread machine. I added a 1/4 cup of my sourdough starter. I put a pan of hot water in the oven and baked it at 400 degrees. The flavor  and texture matched that of a French Batard  we used to get at a bakery 20 years ago. Outstanding!!

For the gluten free baker... I tried using GF AP flour in a bread maker and the mixing didnt work well. I wound up adding extra water (a little more than 1/2 cup) because the dough was so dry. Could have been my breadmaker but I'd recommend mixing GF by hand or in a mixer.  It didnt rise well in spite of warm water, but I tried to raise it in a warm oven since my house was chilly.  All that said, it's still the best I've made so far! I put a pan in the bottom with water and got a lovely crunchy crust! I forgot the egg wash but did get it on for the last 5 minutes, my fault for a lot of color on top. So they were flatter than I'd like, but whatever! It was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside just like it should be! I'm so happy to have GF french bread that's good!! Can't wait to try again!

Will make again but definitely needed some tweaking. Tried with 2 1/2 cups flour and the dough was a sticky, slimy mess. Threw the whole batch out. Made again today with 3 cups flour and perfect. To get the correct ratio I added an extra pinch of yeast. Bread machines are all different but with mine there was no need to put the dough in a bowl and coat with oil it had already fully rised. Maybe that is why yesterday's dough did not turn out...

Made this for the first time on a whim. I didn't use a bread machine but followed the proofing instructions in another comment (proof water, yeast, and sugar together, then add other ingredients). This turned out beautifully! I've been working with bread for a while but hadn't worked through baguettes. We ate the first one hot out of the oven with butter; it was soft on the inside and crusty golden on the outside - yummy!!

First time making French baguettes. Easy directions, easy to make, first time getting a nice crust. A keeper!  Family and friends raved about the bread!  Love it!

Simple easy recipe that has been producing some great tasting loafs. Added just a touch more flour to make the dough easier to handle. Great loafs for subs!

This is a really nice and easy recipe. I do not own a bread maker so I knead the dough for about 5-8 minutes and let it rise for 2-3 hours till the volume is doubled. I put a tray of water under the bread to maintain moisture and baked it for 20 minutes. My husband and I put butter and strawberry jam on the bread. So delicious. Definitely will make again.

Next time I make it I will put a pan of water under the baking bread. The outside of the bread was not nice and crispy like a real baguette. This was just a slightly rolled white bread brushed with an egg yolk. I was not impressed.

I didn't use a bread machine.  I did a triple rise.  When I baked it I put a pan of water on the lower rack.  I got a delicious, crispy bake, that had a nice hollow sound when tapped on the bottom.

I will definitely make this again and again and again.  I made Stromboli , using this as the bread crust , it turned out so good.
I substituted a little cooking oil on top instead of the egg wash, I found it made a nice browned bread, like in the pictures.  My kids have declared this is their new favorite food, and love the crusty bread.

Best bread recipe I have ever made! I highly recommend you watch the video. It helped me with the technique. I did it just like the video and it came out looking like I was a professional baker! I have made this 5 times and it came out perfect every time!

Loved the texture. I let the machine do all of it to the end of the cycle, so I didn't put egg yolk on it. The recipe is perfect as is. I'll definitely make it again.

Great recipe! Experimented a bit and as other reviewers suggested added a bit of water to the oven before baking at 450 and brushed on egg white instead to get a nice crispy brown crust.

This was an awesome recipe.  The directions were easy to follow, it was an easy bread to make, and it turned out delicious.  My husband Loved it!  As I was saying last night during dinner, "if I got this out at a restaurant, I'd be saying 'yum, great bread'...."

I love making bread. TIP buy freshly milled red wheat flour. You will be amazed how much better it is. I start with a quart mason jar, combine 1-1/4 cup 100° water, 1/2 cup flour and 3 tsp yeast. swirl, seal lid and let sit until doubled. Then pour into bowl with 3 cups flour (approx.) and salt. mix, let rise. shape then bake. YUM

Oh my! Where has this recipe been all my bread-making life! to be fair, I've taken bread making more seriously over the last few weeks since all previous few attempts had been hit and miss, more miss than hit. Until I found this fairly forgiving recipe! I made it three times already. I keep to the recipe, omitting the egg yolk wash. I generally have egg white handy, so I mix that with a bit of water instead. I underbaked it once, but that didn't matter. I just popped it in the halogen oven for 4/5 minutes on each side when we wanted to eat, and it came out perfect. i also over baked it once on its 2nd baking in the h. Oven. That didn't matter either, it was just lovely crusty bread. I make 3 loaves, each makes 2 sandwiches. My picky don't-like-bread-much boyfriend said it was the nicest bread he's ever had and we're never buying bread again! So thank you for the recipe, it's perfect!

I made these in my bread machine on the dough cycle. I did not let them rise again in a bowl, I just formed the baguettes as instructed and let those rise; they turned out delicious and it saved a step.  I've been making these every night for the last few days so the kids have fresh sub rolls for their sandwiches and they've been raving about them.

Fair warning!! Do not make these unless you have body armor on and a sword in hand!! My family loves these baguettes! I'll make them and make Subway type sandwiches (if not devoured immediately) and they are sooo good - and way cheaper. So easy!

Delicious baguettes!  My first try made them look a bit silly because I don't know how to properly form a baguette, but the flavor and chew was incredible!

Delicious!  At first I was afraid that I have done something wrong because the dough was so sticky and runny, but it came out beautiful and perfect.

I made 4 small loaves. They are all gone in less than 2 days.   We ate buttered, pizza style and even with cinnamon sugar. I will make again. No bread machine used.

I followed the recipe with exception of the egg wash and I did the kneading with a stand mixer. I was still able to achieved a soft crust and the interior was soft and not dense.

Super easy to make. I mixed then knead the dough in a mixer for about  5 minutes.  I doubled the ingredients  to save effort and time considering how fast we eat homemade bread. I gave it an hour to rise while I was doing some other stuffs but I think it took less than an hour to double in
size.  I cut the dough in half before I rolled. I always used a silicon mat to roll so I don't always add extra flour whenever I make bread.  Make sure the thickness  is even throughout when you roll for an even sized bread.  Next time I will try to make 4 breads instead of 2 for one recipe so  I can  use them for sandwiches. Or make them into individual serving so I don't need to slice anymore. The video helped a lot to make this an easy to follow recipe.  It will now be a one of my favorite bread recipes.

It is perfect, although I did spray the sides and tops of baguettes with water while cooking to make them a little crunchier.

Talk about delicious! Absolutely loved the bread! I made it for my family on Easter morning, and it was a huge hit. The only thing that I changed was that I didn't put the egg on top of the bread. It still had a very crunchy crust, and it tasted great. Thanks!

I wanted buns for "Subway" sandwiches and this was perfect.  Double recipe, add essential wheat gluten and make 8-10 mini baguettes.  No bread machine, no problem.   All in a single bowl, water, yeast, sugar, stir, wait a couple minutes, add flour, salt, gluten on top.  Mix the dry together at the top, then mix the wet into the dry.  Kneed until mixed then back in the same bowl (now oiled) to rise. I skipped the egg, but split the tops, dusted with flour and covered lightly with saran for second rise.  Good dipped in soup, good with cheese, good with jam, good good good.

So simple, yet so delicious! My family of 4 boys and myself devoured this within minutes, so I recommend doubling the recipe (or tripling it if you have teenage boys). I am an experienced baker, but was just completely exhausted and busy the day I made this to accompany a crockpot recipe. So I simply prepared the yeast/sugar/salt in my kitchen aid mixer, came back to add in the flour etc, used a dough hook to kneed for 5 minutes and rise on an oiled, warm baking sheet for 2 hours while we were out of the house. I had divided the dough into 12 balls to hand roll into cigar shapes before rising for little individual style sticks. Baked 350 for 12 minutes when we arrived home from a school function (very hungry kids at this point, so the quick baking time was so handy). Glazed with equal parts melted butter and olive oil. Then lightly sprinkled with garlic salt for an Olive Garden taste twist. Phenomenal!! I will definitely be making these again and experiment with other styles. You cannot go wrong!

Loved this recipe. I made this as a whole loaf and made garlic bread form it. I even put the dough in the fridge for the day, took it out and let it rise for 30 min or so and then into the oven. Worked out great. The brushed egg yolk on the top of the bread is a must!

This was my very first attempt with french bread and I couldn't be happier with the results!  The bread had that crispy, golden crust while the inside was soft!!   I used my bread machine to make the dough and followed the instructions accordingly.  I did need to add a couple of tablespoons of flour but other than that, everything was right on the money!  I think this will be me go-to from now on!!

Great bread.  Used bread machine as advertised for convenience of making dough.  nice consistency throughout and very soft.  Would be easy to crust up more, just add time in the oven.

Great recipe! Did not use bread machine, used Kitchen Aid mixer and followed another user's suggestion of not adding the salt until after kneading the dough.  This recipe is seemingly foolproof.  The whole family loved it! I do wish the loaves were larger.  I may try to double the recipe and the size of the loaves....

Fantastic and delicious French bread recipe, best French bread I have ever had. Note... If you want a crispy crust, just place a 1-2 cups of water in an oven proof container on the bottom rack of oven for 15 minutes of total bake time, then remove water and continue with baking.
Do not change this recipe, it is perfect as is, for a bread machine.

This recipe has ruined fresh bread from the grocery store for my family. I've made it several times now, exactly as written, and every time it comes out perfectly.

I made this today (without a bread maker) and it turned out beautifully. I proofed the yeast with half the water and the sugar before combining all the ingredients and kneading the dough for ~8 minutes. The loaves were not only attractive, but also so tasty that one was gone before it was even cool. I really appreciated the simplicity of the recipe. Fancy bread recipes are all well and good, but I can see myself using this one over and over.

EDIT: It is 3.5 years later and this recipe has stood the test of time! I make it frequently when I'm planning soup or pasta for dinner. It is so simple and quick that it is now the only yeast bread that I consistently make on a whim. The main thing that has changed over the years is that my husband and I have lost much of our restraint... we each claim a full baguette for ourselves at dinner!

super simple and always turns out great! I do it every week, my family goes nuts for it. It always looks like it just came out of the oven in a French bakery :) I sometimes add fresh rosemary while rolling it and top it with some parmesan cheese. simply delicious!

I made this without a bread machine by proofing the yeast first and hand-kneading.  It was delicious!  crispy crust, chewy center, just the right density.  This is my go-to bread recipe!

This is one of my favorite bread recipes :)  I usually end up making a double so the baguettes will be bigger, and they rarely last more than a day or two...

This was my first attempt at using the dough setting and forming and baking the loaves myself.  I was scared at first but was so proud when they came out of the oven. I will definitely make this recipe often for my husband to use for sandwiches at work.

Outstanding! I did add the egg yolk to the dough as another reviewer did, which added a lovely color to the loaves.  I kneaded by hand for 5 minutes and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Wonderful flavor and my husband was impressed.  Making this again today!

I enjoyed making and eating this bread as the whole family did, dipping it in olive oil and after turning it into garlic bread! However, the texture wasn't as the usual baguette I am used to, it was more dense and chewy as several others commented. This is my first time using bread flour so it might be the reason behind that but looking at images of others, they had fluffier and lighter bread from inside. 

Here are some changes I made:
1) I didn't use a bread machine, just kneaded using my stand mixer and finished it with 5 minutes kneading by hand till elastic, smooth and no longer sticky (~ 15 mins total time). 
2) Didn't brush the bread with anything, just a light dust of flour and that resulted in a crispy yet thin crust which is just how we like it. 
3) baked it on 220 C. After doing a lot of search online, baguette is never baked on such a low temperature as 190 C, I wasn't brave enough to bake on 260 C as several recipes do! it took around 25 minutes given I made shorter loaves than the recipe.

Loved it!  Made two changes:  used egg white not the egg yoke and used vegetable shortening in the rising bowl and the sheet pan.  The turned out just like the ones from my local French bakery!!  My family ate them within the hour and I am making two MORE baguettes

Came out pretty good for my 2nd time baking bread.   Was expecting a worse outcome but was pleasantly surprised, not as pretty as the pictures that many have posted but, delicious & with a delightfully crisp crust & soft center.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and bread comes out delicious every time!  If you're finding your bread is too dense, chances are good you're adding too much flour or not allowing sufficient time to rise.  If my kitchen is cool, I place the bread in a cool oven to rise with a pan of boiled water below.  Mine comes out fluffy inside and crisp on the outside.

Bread turned out crunchy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. I also didn't roll mine out, I just formed two loaves...I don't think I let them rise long enough as I have two small loaves but that's my error not because of the recipe itself. Will definitely be making again as my 5 year old loves it.

this is the best French baguette recipe I have found ever! I sprinkled some poppy seeds and a little rock salt on to the egg wash. Its lovely fluffy chewy bread. Mine had a very light crunch, its not crusty bread but its not trying to be!

I needed a simple French bread recipe and this was the one! Easy to make and the bread came out beautiful. Because of egg allergies, I did not brush the tops but I don't think it was missed. I will be making this again but I think I will make 6 smaller rolls to be used for sandwiches. Thanks for a great recipe!

I took the advice of another reader and used my kitchen aid.  Uh, no...It rose on the first rise, then not at all on the second.  I baked it and it is fit for the birds!  My mistake to not follow the original recipe, so I rated it a 4.  Go with the recipe. Don't use the mixer.

I can't say they turned out as pretty as you'd get in a Parisian boulangerie, but I did OK for my first time making baguettes, and they tasted lovely!  I followed the recipe to the letter, using my bread machine (I LOVE that thing), except that it took a bit longer for my bread to rise but that could be because it's 6*F outside and our furnace is broken (cold kitchen).  Great recipe which I will definitely make again---thanks!!

WOW!!!!!  Only thing different was I had to add an extra couple of tablespoon of water.  As the dough was mixing, looked chalky like the dough would not form.  The result was amazing!  The dough was easy to handle.

So this is my second time making homemade bread from scratch, but my first time making this recipe. I don't have a bread machine, so I did it by hand. I cut the recipe in half, but wish I hadn't. It was gone in about 10 minutes after it came out the oven! The dough was a little sticky, but I added some more flour until I could mold it without it sticking to my hands. After it rose, I shaped it and cut the slashes. There wasn't enough dough to make a really long baguette, nor did I have a very long cookie sheet. After it rose once more, I used the egg wash and put it in the oven on 325. My oven tends to get really hot, so I usually only do 300-350. I put butter on it and it was amazing! The flavor was awesome, even without the butter spread. I will be making this again in the future. It was delicious!

I love this recipe I am by far a Novice when it comes to breads and dough. This is my 4th time in 6 weeks making this Baguette my only problem * please if somebody could help * is that every time I have made this it seems 1cup of water is not enough I have to keep adding more as my machine does the hard work. Is the 1 cup water accurate or is it just my climate messing with me? But other than that never change ANYTHING and this bread is absolutely FANTASTIC ! ! !

Made this for my first attempt to make homemade sub rolls rather than buy them at the store.  Outstanding!  My husband couldn't stop complimenting me about how good it was!  It does make 3 decent sized sub style rolls.  Will make this again for sure! 
And I don't own a bread machine so I did this all by hand;  used other reviews suggestions by proofing my yeast and allowing dough to rise, then punched down,  cut into 3 equal parts,  slash and rise again then bake.  This is my go to recipe now....I will never buy store bought sub rolls again!  Thank you for sharing!

I love the simplicity of this recipe. I've found I need to add a touch more flour (I let my 3 year old help measure). We've also found we prefer using egg whites instead of egg yolk.

I made these with 1/2 whole wheat flour and managed to mess up the recipe and they were still AMAZING!  Can't wait till next time when I don't mess it up.  I can only imagine how wonderful they'll be!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Loved this bread!  I followed recipe, my dough cycle takes 1:50 (and rises twice), I let it rise two more times as the recipe says.  I had to put it in the oven after heating it to 200 degrees and shutting it off for the rising as we live in the desert & the a/c is on ALL the time.  I also had to let it rise 40-45 minutes each time.  Made one large loaf instead of two. Also, b/c my dough cycle is so long, it takes me 4 hours start to finish, but worth it for the lack of hands-on time for me. I noticed some unhappy reviewers used 2C flour, not 2 1/2 as the recipe states.  Could be why it was sticky?

Great, easy recipe.  I like to use milk instead of water for the dough, which makes for a slightly richer bread as well as helping to get a good brown on the exterior.  I also cut out some work and wastage by using a whole beaten egg for the wash instead of separating yolk from white.  This recipe does not truly require a bread machine; the yeast and sugar can be dissolved in the water in one bowl, the dry ingredients combined in the other and the two incorporated by hand.

Excellent Recipe!!  I followed the recipe to a T.  I did add some ice cubes to the bottom of my heated oven prior to putting the loaves in.  I will ABSOLUTELY make this again.  Crust was nice, chewy, and crispy.  Thank you for this recipe!

Perfect. I followed the recipe pretty much in its entirety. The only things I did different were scrambling an egg for the egg wash, sprinkling with Italian herbs, and adding a bit of water to the oven while baking. The baguettes were delicious straight out of the oven!

This is amazing!  I am so glad I made a triple batch, because now I can share.  I used my kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook to do all the kneading, followed the ingredients list, except used egg whites on top.  Consistency was great, not too sticky for the mixer, but if hand kneading, it probably would have been.  I will definitely make these again...soon.

Great easy recipe, but does NOT remind me of french bread. Perfect for hoagies/subs. I proof the yeast in the water and sugar then used my food processor to knead the dough.  Once I substituted 1 cup of bread flour with whole wheat and added a tablespoon of vital wheat gluten and it was marvelous. I recommend trying it.

tasted good. My flaw was I forgot to let it rise that last time. It turned out too Dense but I could see why everyone like it. I am going to try it again correctly. I would say that my in experience in bread making was the problem here not the recipe. I also used honey instead of sugar just because I could.

This is my new go to recipe!!  Excellent!  Came out crusty on the outside with a nice soft fluffy inside.  My husband, daughter and I finished the first loaf in about 15 minutes!! Can't wait to make this again...probably tomorrow!!  I would give this 10 stars if there were more!! Go ahead and make this bread, you won't be disappointed.

Little hint - If baguettes come out with a hard crust, just very very lightly sprinkle a kitchen towel with a few drops of water and cover them for a few minutes.

I made this without a bread machine and it still turned out awesome!  They are perfect for subs and makes great garlic bread to go with spaghetti.  I will be making these again to try and recreate a Vietnamese sandwich, thanks for the recipe!

Made these three times now. Tonight husband said, "These are great for every thing. Let's just have this bread from now on". We love them. For toast, sandwiches, or with just butter with any meal! And they freeze well. Glad to have found this recipe. >^..^

Made on day 1 and was phenomenal with garlic , Parmesan , butter, parsley.. Family loved it so much ,I made it again the next day!  Day 3 made it for subs...will never buy baguettes again!  Quick , easy, simple!  Is wicked sticky, but I oil my hands before pulling it out of the machine.  Rolled it out first day, but second and third I just formed and it worked just the same!

Wow... I was very pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out!  I made this with my KitchenAid.  Mixed water, yeast and sugar together in a bowl and let that sit for 10 minutes until foamy.  Then mixed salt and flour together in the mixer bowl (ended up having to use 3 cups of flour), and mixed in the foamed yeast mixture.  Kneaded that for several minutes on medium on the KitchenAid and then let rest as indicated.  used a whole egg for the wash.  Also, baked at 425 and put a small dish of water in the oven when I put the bread in to make for a crispier crust.

This is a fantastic recipe. I followed DivineHealth7's advice and did not use my bread machine and it turned out great! It is crusty and chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. I pulled off chunks of it and dunked them in olive oil with spices and it was heavenly. I will definitely be making this recipe again

Loved this recipe. Turned out amazing just like French baguette I used to have when in Paris. The only thing I did differently was mix the warm water with sugar and yeast, then let sit for about 10 minutes until foamy. Once everything is mixed, I let the dough rise for about an hr. Then shape and rest for another hour, and then bake. I doubled the recipe and made 4 loaves out of them. Just fabulous!! Thank you for sharing.

was very good!  It's not a very soft bread so it works well for dipping. I want to make this and use for sub rolls sometime!  I used the bread machine, it takes about 1/2 hour for the mixing cycle.  i remove the dough at that time then put in bowl to rise with the oil as the recipe says.

Didnt use a bread machine, and made 4 'sub' rolls. Came out great! Easy and tasty. I love the texture of the bread and the flavor. I made this into French Dip sandwiches. Family loved it. I felt like a star.

Where did my bread go. All i can say is that in a matter of 20 minutes both baguettes were gone. Vanished in thin air. Everyone loved this bread so much they begged for more. Next time I will make 4 times the recipe and freeze to have some on hand at our next pasta night.

A good basic recipe. The yolks are the crispy crumb agent when cooking, same can be accomplished (and results in a darker crumb) by putting a small container of wafer on the bottom of the oven during bake. (I also recommend using a table spoon of salt and storing the first knead/rise in the fridge overnight to develop the glutens). 

Also important if using a non-convection oven: Cook as high in the oven as possible. The temperature is more stable and the crumb will be exponentially better. 

Also, standard yeast can be used if stored in the fridge overnight to develop the glutens. I prefer this method because the dough seems to work better for freezing. Follow the recipe as noted but after final shaping and before second rise go directly to freezer. 

Handy trick is to freeze first and then vacuum pack the dough. Lasts 10 times longer. And this only works if you have a deep freezer (frost free doesn't work).

LOVE this bread!  Yeast is my fear in the kitchen, but with a bread machine to help out, this was wonderful!  When I make a yeast recipe I follow the recipe exactly, which I did with this one.  When I checked in the bread machine after it had mixed for about 10 minutes I knew the dough was too wet so I added an additional 1/3 cup bread flour.  That seemed to be the right amount.  This dough was very easy to work with and formed great loaves.  I used the bread to make 'The Munroe Melt' a sandwich recipe from AR.  The bread worked perfectly.  Glad I tried this one and I will be making it again! :o)

I must admit, I was skeptical that such a simple recipe could turn out such beautiful, and perfectly textured loaves.  I do not have a bread machine, so I used my stand mixer to do the mixing/kneading.  These are amazing, We had one loaf tonight with our spaghetti, I put garlic butter and mozzarella on the halves and toasted them.  Wonderful.  I think with the leftover loaf I am going to make bruschetta.  This is going to be my permanent recipe for french bread. This is truly that amazing.

My husband LOVES bread.  Well, actually, my whole family does but he just loves it a little more.  My bread rose just fine both times and it wasn't too sticky, but then I just knead the bread with flour until it feels right normally instead of using exact measurements. I did it all by hand instead of in a machine. I doubled the recipe, made three loaves from it and froze one of the loaves.  I think next time I will make four loaves and make them shorter. Even the frozen loaf turned out really tasty.

I have used this recipe multiple times to make french bread, adding fresh herbs from my garden like basil or rosemary. Right now I am making something new with it: Goulash stuffed inside with this recipe braided around it. The only thing I am consistently noticing is that the dough is a bit moist. I am always adding more flour at various stages.

I liked it allot the problem was it was a little flat when I baked it and the dough was kind of sticky after the first rise, no big deal I just added a little bit more flour. Overall a very great recipe and will be making this again tonight :)
Thanks for sharing!

This was really easy to make and tasted great! I didn't change it one bit and it turned out perfectly. I may have rolled it too thin which made it really crunchy on the outside, which I liked, but it was still soft on the inside. I did cook it on preheated stoneware which I thin helps a lot. I will make this one again!

Really balanced flavor! When I roll it out for two loaves I add long thick strips of aged asiago cheese and roll it up; add egg wash then garlic salt and pinches of oregano and basil on top and it's fantastic! Next day we eat slice the second loaf and toast and make bruschetta with fresh basil and tomatoes from the garden!

Awsome recipe thanks,  I dont have a bread machine so I followed Devinehealth7 advice and it work perfectly.  I also use egg white instead of  yolk and my crust is crunchy! Oh and I didnt use bread flour for all my baking I use king arthur all purpose flour.  This recipe is a keeper. Thank you!

I followed the instruction except did not use an egg yolk wash at the end instead i used almond milk. Made these baguettes a couple times now and they turned out great each time.

Tasted like Penn Station bread wooo! I did not use a bread machine, this recipe yielded 2 10"ish baguettes. Def will double it next time and freese any leftovers! Before I baked it I sliced a knife down the middle, then brushed with egg (a whole egg not just yolk)

I was looking for a bread recipe that would be the vessel for our french dip sandwiches tonight.....WOW! Upon the first taste, i thought i'd skip the sandwiches & just have bread & butter for dinner...This is the best textured bread I've ever made[could have something to do w/not having bread flour before now :)] I did not use a bread machine, just used my stand mixer...My only complaint, & I don't fault the recipe, is that every time i make french bread(& this was no different) my loaves are rather flat...It wasn't too dense, so i know it's not bad yeast or anything...If anyone has any thoughts as to what i may be doing wrong,please share... Great recipe...Oh, & i took one reviewers advice & added salt after kneading & rest....

Wonderful flavor and crust.  Added a little bit more flour to the mixture.  I didn't use a bread machine and just kneaded the dough. Preheated my oven to 250 for about 1-2 minutes and let it rise in there. Speeding up the time.  We made sandwiches with Turkey, Spinach, Caramelized Shallots and Spicy brown mustard.  Thank you.

Absolutely love this recipe.  I have had issues in making bread in getting it smooth so it doesn't look deformed; this bread is easy to make and turned out beautiful.  Made me proud of myself and my kids cannot wait to eat.  I watched the video on here reference this recipe, after putting the ingredients into the bread machine.  The video is very helpful in knowing what to do if you have never made french bread loafs.  Thank you so much for this recipe it will be a favorite with my family.

easy and perfectly delicious. I used egg white instead for the wash to make a crustier crust. Will make often.

I made this exactly as shown, except I brushed the top with Earth Balance instead of egg yolk, and the bread is delicious! The inside is perfectly soft and the outside was very crunchy -- a little TOO crunchy, actually. Next time, I'll bake it for 5 fewer minutes and hopefully that will keep the crust from getting too hard. Thanks for the recipe!

Just wanted to update my review from last week - I tried it this time with bread flour, and what a difference! I gave it 5 stars last week using A/P flour, but with bread flour, I'm giving it 6. The texture was much more chewy, like a baguette should be. I did have to add about 20 minutes to the first rise. I didn't think it could get any better, but I was wrong! :o)

Great recipe! I used 3 C of flour instead of 2.5 C and kneaded it in the Kitchen Aid until the dough no longer stuck to the sides of the bowl & followed the rest of the directions as written. My 6yo daughter was impressed-- she gave it a "better than Panera!" review.

Excellent. When it first came out warm it had that slightly crispy exterior and soft interior. After it cooled, the outside became softer with more of the chewy texture. Either way, it was great!
Update: the last couple of times I've made this dough I have use the 2nd loaf to make cinnamon buns for dessert.. it doesn't matter what dough you use if you smother it with butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and cream cheese icing. :)

Taste was good, but mine looked nothing like the picture, mine came out kind of flat and misshapen. Perhaps it's my technique. :) I'll try it again.

Wonderful recipe!  I made this to use as sandwich bread and to make garlic bread, it's truly excellent!  Very easy to make with the bread machine.  I followed the recipe exactly and got two very delicious baguettes.

This was my first try at baguettes. I didn't use a dough machine to make it, and I used quick rise yeast. I also combined the sugar and warm water in a large cup. Once the sugar was dissolved I added the yeast and let it activate. I then added it to the flour and mixed it by hand and kneaded it until it was well mixed. Otherwise I followed the recipe. The baguettes were great. I will make these again and soon.

These came out great even when I made a mistake and included the egg yolk into the recipe.
They were dense and sift in the middle and great for dipping into oil and soups.

My son requested a bruschetta platter for Christmas Eve, so I tripled this recipe to have enough baguettes for the crostini portion, and then used 3 different bruschetta recipes from this site.  Huge hit!  I made this baguette recipe again, but made the baguettes wider, so we could have oven French toast on Christmas morning.  I omitted the sugar, and used all purpose, unbleached flour.  The egg wash was a waste of an egg, in my opinion, so I will omit this step in future.  Great recipe!  I also use this for pizza dough.

I made this today it was a good recipe although I wanted a lighter bread in the inside. The crust was very crunchy something I really wanted. I will maybe make again but I'm still in search of something a little less heavier in the inside.

This was my first attempt at making a french baguette and it turned out very tasty!  The only thing I was disappointed about was that it wasn't crispy on the outside like the loaves that I get other places but the taste more than made up for that! I will be making this again!

This is a solid recipe but far from outstanding. The dough is very sticky even after kneading. Maybe an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup flour might help. In light of reviews which warned the baguettes weren't crispy, I adjusted the cooking method: preheat oven to 500 degrees, and put an old brownie pan at the very bottom. The moment you place your baguettes in the oven, pour a cup or so of water into the heated brownie pan and shut the oven. This generates steam, which helps make the crust nice and crispy. After 10 minutes, lower the heat to 375 (the posted temperature) and bake until done. Texturally the baguette was satisfying, but its flavor was unremarkable. I've learned my lesson, and in the future I will stick with recipes which call for a pre-ferment -- the extra time is worth it!

Four stars because it is incredibly easy to make, looks pretty, and has a fabulous texture. It's a little bland, though, but I would still recommend it and will definitely make it again.

This is a GREAT recipe. I used it to make sub sandwiches and it was perfect. Great tasting, nice, chewy texture. Not too "bready"... just a light soft bread.

No need for a bread machine. People who state it was sticky dough, are probably using a very wet flour. All flours have different moisture contents, and, unless you are weighing them you are going to need a little more or a little less.

Great recipe! I noticed other peoples comments about a soft crust and I coincidentaly forgot to mix my eggwash with water but I kept some egg white in there and my crust turned out super crunchy...so I would suggest not using as much water or doing what i did and subbing the water for egg white.

I LOVED it. I PINNED it. I EMAILED it. I doubled the recipe, split the batch, made 3 baguettes with half, and 5 "mall" pretzels with the other. I am making more as we speak. I will take pictures of those.

I made this today after my husband told me a coworker gave him some of his spicy vegetable olive oil - this is something we wait for every year.  I used the dough setting and since that goes through the first rise, I shaped the bread right away rather than let it rise in a greased bowl like the recipe said.  I didn't do anything to the tops of the loaves except spritz them with a little water.  They turned out absolutely delicious!  Can't wait to make this again!

Just made this bread a few days ago - in my estimate a delicious bread - both plain or toasted slightly (which gives it a crunchy texture perfect for garlic bread.)  It is a bit difficult to handle but I dusted the bread board with a bit more flour to make it easier to handle.  I put a bowl of warm water in the oven while baking and it results in a crispy crust.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Fantastic recipe.  You truly do not need a bread machine.  I added some olives, a little Italian seasoning, and some Parmesan cheese.  Was just fantastic. My wife has a standing order for more of these.

This bread was very good.  My family enjoyed it fresh from the oven and the next day we used it for french dip sandwiches.  It does not have the french baguette texture (more like italian bread) I was looking for but I will make it again

Just popped this out of the oven and it turned out excellent!  Followed a previous review by a Parisian native that mentioned brushing with the egg white instead of the yolk, and this is by far the best homemade french bread I've ever baked, and I've done quite a few :)

I just made these again with double the salt and no  sugar...even better!
So good! I read the reviews and made the following changes: egg white instead of egg yolk mixed the salt into the dough after the flour was fully incorporated. These were  very easy and way better than the grocery store baguettes. Wonderful with Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken stuffed inside!

Made this tonight and it turned out great. I made it to serve with stew I made for dinner and my family of 5 went through the first batch in no time. After I had the first batch rising I decided to make a second cause it looked kind of small. Next time I will double it for my bread loving family. I made it to recipe but I made in in my mixer and added a touch more flour.

These baguettes are Awesome!!   I've made them twice already this week.  They are perfect for sandwiches. Used them for Sensational Steak sandwiches (recipe from this site) and also for garlic cheese bread.  Will definitely be making them again!

This was easy and looked great.  We thought the flavor was a little flat for a dinner bread, but would be good for sandwiches.

yum!  defiantly needs extra flour.   works great with normal white flour and normal dry instant yeast. (what i had in the house) didnt have eggs in, so didnt bother with that, but turned out lovely and crispy on top, i actually dont think french baguettes even have a glazed top!   next time will be doubling this recipe , makes about 3 mini baguettes.

This is a great recipe.  I have no luck with yeast bread but I followed this - with the exception of no bread machine and it came out wonderful.  Also just used regular yeast I bought in bulk.

I made no changes to the recipe and used my bread machine.  Flour was pretty easy to roll out. I put a baking sheet in the bottom of the oven and threw in a cup of water right before adding the bread, for steam.  The bread was moist and tender and great, consistency-wise.  The flavor was good, but kind of plain/bland.

This is the best recipe for baguettes! Only I don't brush with egg yolk since I think it tastes "cakey". Just water is enough.

What a great recipe.  My 8 yo helped with everything, so very kid-friendly for little helpers.  My husband raved about it, which he rarely does.  The following day he asked me to make my bread again-and I did because it was just so easy and tastey.  The second time, I brushed the loaves with melted butter and sprinkled with some Italian seasoning and grated Parm.  Yum!  Kids said the house smelled like Subway!!

i have made this bread twice this week and it's only wednesday! it turns out so wonderful. the dough is so soft. the only change i made was the yeast. i didn't have bread machine yeast so i just used 2 1/4 teas of dry active yeast (which equals 1 packet). worked great!

This got a "wow" from my husband, who's very picky about bread.  Using the bread machine to mix and rise, this recipe was dead easy.  I'll be making this again... and again, and again.

I need help on this one...I did the proportions exactly, but used a cuisinart mixer bowl rather than a bread machine to mix the dough. I mixed it for 20-30 minutes.  It did not rise much, but I kept at it and baked the 2 loaves, but at the end, the bread actually tasted like fish oil was added to it.  Is this the egg yolk? Any explanations/tips?

This was the first time I made this 'type' of bread... I followed directions as instructed & the bread came out pretty good.  Don't be fooled though, this is the kind of recipe that you have to feel comfortable with and will only get better at the more experience you have at making it.

After three tries I finally got it right.  I am not very patient, so I didn't let it rise properly.  The second time I covered with plastic wrap and they 'fell' as I removed the plastic wrap from the risen loaves... Third time was a charm and now I can put together wonderful, chewy and crunchy loaves without even having to consult the recipe!  Slice thin to make toast in the morning or sandwiches...perfect.

Great recipe! I made 1/2 recipe.... and made two small 6-8 inch baguettes. I followed the recipe exactly except for the egg wash. Turned out great. Mine weren't crusty on top... maybe next time I will try the egg wash? YUM!

We love this bread! I make it without a bread machine and it still turns out awesome. Just be sure to proof the yeast...hubby didn't know to and it didn't rise much. But was still awesome!

The recipe is outstanding!  Thanks Judy for submitting an excellent Baguette recipe,  I used my mixer for the kneading and the baguette turned out perfectly, a crispy crust and light and airy inside.

These French baguettes DID come out crisp on the outside and rather moist and chewy on the inside.  However, I feel that the taste just really didn't do it for me; it was not light like I imagined, but rather a little heavy on the salt and too dense.  The texture was the only satisfying feature of the baguette I made.

Fabulous!  As others said-there's no need for a bread machine here.  I used my stand mixer according to instructions and made two baguettes.  I didn't do the egg wash-just to see if they'd turn out crunchy on the outside and they did!  Golden brown and crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside-YUM.  Next time I'll try the egg-white-only wash so that I get the nice shiny crust.

OMG,  I will have to say that I do not have a bread machine.  I used active dry yeast and hand kneaded.  The texture is just like from a bakery,  I have been wowed and will definitely be making this again.

This baguette recipe is incredibly delicious and I love baking it every time. However, like many previous commenters, I am one of those old-fashioned bakers and made it by hand. I found that kneading it for 5 minutes by hand works well, as well as adding just a very small amount of water extra. Out of personal preference, I used honey instead of sugar and whole wheat flour instead of the standard white, and still got great results. Rolling it out flat, however, proved to create a product I didn't particularly like. What I found to work best was letting gravity do the work: I just held it in the air, rolled it with my hand, and let gravity do the work in making the baguette shape. This is a great recipe, and I'm sure it'll be a keeper in your recipe box.

It's pure SUPERB! I did what is written there.. but since i don't have the machine I just kneaded the dough.. you don't need the machine at all! I just powdered the dough after brushing it with egg yolks + water so that it'd look nice and instead greasing the pan, i put flour on it! :)

I just realized that after using this recipe about twice a month for the last 6 months, I've never reviewed it.  I use 1 cup WW flour and 1 cup AP to start then add more AP until the dough pulls away from the bowl of my KA, usually about 1/3 to 1/2 cup.  After forming the loaves, I wet my hands well and rub lightly on the tops then presson  sesame seeds.  They look great and taste just as good.  Thanks.

FANTASTIC!!  I followed this recipe exactly with the exception of brushing the loaves with the egg white and not yolk just prior to baking.  My family devoured this at dinner. GONE!!  This will be great for dinners, sandwiches and perhaps french bread pizza... yum!  Nice chewy crust outside but soft inside.

Absolutely wonderful-makes two nice sized loaves or you can cut it smaller and make rolls or sandwich buns.  The first time I made it as is and it turned out perfect-soft on the inside-chewy on the outside. The second time I was a little short on white flour so I mixed in a little wheat. Forgot the egg wash until halfway through the baking-still turned out wonderfully.   I found I needed to add about another 1/2 cup of flour to my bread machine to get the dough where it needed to be but that often seems to be the case so it may just be my machine.

This is the best bagette recipe I've tried so far.  Found that it is very versatile with what you can do with the dough also; works good for calzone and pizza dough, and pretty good for rolls if you butter baste them.  Thanks for posting this one!

Tried many-this has most flavour! Wonderful soft and MMMMMMMMMM. Very easy to prepare ( I skipped the eggwash-oops) and worth the time! Now I wish I had doubled the recipe-next time I'll know! Thanks for this!

this is the second time i've made this recipe and it's really great. this time i wanted to knead the salt in after the initial knead (i was doing it by hand), and i forgot to add the salt before putting the dough in an oiled bowl. so i opted to knead the oil (about 1 Tbl) into the dough along with the salt and i ended up with some AMAZING ciabatta like bread. my boyfriend said it was better than the original recipe.

Delicious!  Crunchy on the outside soft in the inside.  I made a few changes, I used a tsp of sugar instead of tbls and I also used a tbs of salt instead of tsp.  It came out delish!

This is a great bread!  So worth the time & it tastes better that any bread you will buy at your local mega-mart!  It is more dense than the usual baguette and is great for sandwiches!

This bread was good and fluffy, however, I didn't have any bread flour and the consistency was a little heavier than I would have liked. I will be making it again though :).  Thank you!
UPDATE: 
OMG! I tried this bread again and this time used bread flour.  I also brushed it with an egg white wash (as recommended by another reviewer) and also brushed some melted butter; it was DELICIOUS!! This is definitely a keeper! Thank you so much!

Great recipe!  I made one loaf instead of dividing the dough in half.  Then I just pressed the dough out with my fingers.  Great, easy recipe - I love having homemade bread especially on a cold winter day in Michigan!!  Make this recipe!!

I don't have a bread machine but followed someone else's post for making this bread with my Kitchenaid mixer and no machine...fantastic and very easy!  Will definitely be making this again soon.

This is the first time that I have ever tried to make baguettes and they turned out great.  I made 8" loaves for our dinner tonight (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Easy-Slow-Cooker-French-Dip/Detail.aspx) These were a perfect bread for the sandwiches.  Thanks for sharing this one!

This recipe will be my new go to for fresh bread.  My DH and I aren't much for flaky rolls and prefer crusty bread.  I made four mini baguettes and they were perfect.  I did forget the egg wash and they were still amazing!

I made this earlier and  followed Serena's instructions from her review and wow the perfect crusty top that I love! I uploaded a picture also. this was easy and was the first time making bread and i will definitely be making this years and years to come. The only thing i did differently was right before putting it in the oven i sprinklyed kosher salt and some more flour to give it that rustic look and this is so delicious much better  than store bought, it will keep 3-4 days wrapped in foil on the counter, or up to 3 months wrapped tightly in foil and  frozen. do not put it in the fridge it will dry out. thanks for the great recipe!!!

I have made this delicious bread twice. I joined allrecipes finally just to review this. It is SO GOOD. I put my pan with the formed baguettes on top of my dryer while it is on, and they rise right up!

Perfect recipe!  worked very well with grade 10s and they were so proud of their results. I used all purpose flour (instead of bread flour) and brushed the top with beaten egg (whole egg, no water). In the second experiment we baked small cloves of garlic in the bread - WOW!

We deemed this "Daddy/Hubby Appreciation Day". We chose this recipe to go along with our Beef Stew. I've tried many different french breads, but haven't found the desired dense bread we enjoy. That is until now! My husband kept telling me how much he loved the bread! This would also make a wonderful sub sandwich bread. I'll certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!

My first attempt at making bread, and it turned out amazing! I split the dough into 4 loaves, and put them on a greased baking pan sprinkled with cornflour. Also, I took some of the other reviewers comments into consideration and put in a cup of water on the bottom rack of the oven to create a steam environment - the crust (with the egg white wash) stayed crispy and the inside was nice and soft.  I may allow the bread to rise a little more next time to get a bit more airy texture. Still a fantastic recipe and definitely worth 5 stars!

I made this recipe as written. It was excellent and does not need any changes, in my opinion. I will, however, not roll the edges to a taper next time. I like my loaves to be a bit more uniform. A keeper for sure!

I loved this bread!  I have made it a couple times so far. It is great for sandwiches.  I wish it was a lot crustier on the outside but the fact that it's soft makes it good for sandwiches. Definitely will continue to make this.  Thanks!

This is delish! I was worried b/c I was out of bread flour so I used all purpose. Made this by hand (no bread machine). And used rapid-rise yeast, not bread machine type. Oh and I was out of eggs, so no golden brushed top. So uhm, yeah time to go shopping. But still turned out wonderful! Trying to hold back from eating it all up before dinner!

These tasted great!!  They were crunchy on the outside and light and chewy on the inside.  I don't have a bread machine, so I made this by hand.  I made 4 hoagie-sized baguettes and we ate them with the "Easy Slow Cooker French Dip" sandwich meat on this site.  I need some practice shaping my baguettes, but that just gives me an excuse to use this recipe again!

After spending a few summers in France I have become a bread snob. That said, this is the BEST BREAD I have had round here! It comes so close to the real (French) thing! It's a great base, and easy to alter. Sometimes I like to rub olive oil on the bread for a completely different taste and texture, I get a lot of complements when I do that. I don't have a bread machine so I use my KitchenAid mixer. If you do it that way, first mix the yeast with the sugar and (warm) water. Then the flour, then salt. Since I have found this recipe I can't stop making it! I have even been offered money to make it for people because everybody just loves this bread.

Fantastic! Made in a bread machine with bread machine yeast. I cut into 4 pieces for 7 1/2 inch meatball subs. I baked on parchment paper. I didn't add the egg white or water. It came out crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.

I haven't ever made bread before making this recipe.  It was so easy and came out amazing!  My husband couldn't believe that I had made baguettes for our dinner.  I wish I had known before now that homemade bread was so easy and delicious!

Oh my!  I totally screwed up this recipe and it still came out great!  I only had all purpose flour on hand so that's what I used.  I don't have a bread machine so just threw everything into a bowl and then worked the dough with my hands.  The only thing that I had no idea how to do was adding the yeast (whether I should let it proof first or not).  I mixed one packet (8g) of active dry yeast with 1/4 cup warm water and 1 tsp sugar.  After about 10 minutes it seemed to be frothy enough so I used about half of that for the recipe.  For my first time making bread, I'd say it came out great!  Other things I did: brushed a few times with plain water for a crunchy crust and baked on parchement paper.

I don't have a bread makers, so I made this by hand following the instructions other reviewers mentioned.  The only thing is that the first time I made it, it was more dense than I expected.  Then I read somewhere that when making it by hand rather than a bread machine you should add more yeast, so I used 2.5 tsp of yeast and it turned out really great.  Also, because of reviewers saying the crust was too soft, I left out brushing it with egg white and water the first few times I made it, but then I just tried it with the egg white/water and it was so delicious.  Not like the bread from the store's crust, but more like Subway's bread's crust.  very soft and chewy and I liked it best that way

WOW, this was my first attempt on making any sort of bread and it couldn’t have turned out any better. On one of the loafs (after the egg wash) I sprinkled random dried herbs on it and that turned out great as well. This is a definite keeper!

I absolutely LOVED the bread. I am really frustrated about American "bread" (I am from Germany) so I am constantly looking for good "real bread" recipes. This one is definitely a keeper. Better (and much cheaper!!) than the ones from the grocery store bakery. Will make again soon!

Great recipes, I did this without the bread machine and I substituted AP flour for the bread flour. It was fantastic, I made 2 boules for my potato and leek soup, and it soaked up a little of the soup to give a great flavor to the bread. I will definately use this recipe again!

the result was much better when I rolled the 8 inch side not the 12 inch side . I made some croutons from it and it was good . the second time I`ll mix it with garlic powder and  herbs to make the perfect croutons

Want a crustier bread? Here's the tip. Skip the egg wash at the end and instead spray the baguettes with cold water. Bake at 400 degrees F for an equal amount of time. This tip creates a baguette with crunchy, brown crust. OR, if you want a crust that is chewier and not so brown, substitute the yolk with egg white in the egg wash. This recipe is extremely versatile and can be used as a base to invent many different varieties. STRONGLY recommended for beginners.

I divided my dough into 4 rather than 2 more for ease of serving.  Instead of brushing with egg, I misted my dough with olive oil, and it browned very well.  I only have cookie sheets to bake these on, but next time I'll lightly grease the baking sheet as the bread stuck to the sheet.  Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  I might add some rosemary to the dough next time.  UPDATE: I bit the bullet and ended up buying a baguette pan and the results have been fantastic!  To keep the dough from sticking to my pan, I dust some cornmeal on the bottom.  If you want to get a really crisp crust, I recommend misting your hot oven and dough with some water then quickly shut the oven door to retain that humidity.  If you make a lot of baguettes, I HIGHLY suggest getting the pan...it's made a considerable difference for me.

Okay, these are super easy if I can do it right on my very first try. I made sure they had a warm place to rise (on top of the oven after it had been preheated for cooking the baguettes). I didn't put any egg on them either. We really like them!

Very easy, delicious bread.  My only complaint is that it was a little bland.  I would've enjoyed a more buttery flavor. I will definitely make again but maybe add garlic salt or butter on top.

I started to prepare exactly as directed. However, when my machine beeped for me to check my dough ball, my dough was not a ball at all - it was very much like the consistency of glue. I slowly added 4 handfuls of bread flour to make the dough ball. It worked fine although the dough was still super sticky. The bread came out fine - I brushed mine with melted butter during the last minute or two and the crunchiness of my crust was great. I'm not sure of how chewy a french baguette usually is, but mine was a little chewier than I like - could have been too much flour, could have been the way it was supposed to turn out; I'm not sure. This is a very cool recipe and ended up being a relatively easy way to make something so different than what we normally eat. Thanks for the submission!

We really liked the chewy goodness of this bread. Mine took a while longer to rise than listed, but I had the time. Turned out a lovely golden colour with the egg wash.

This was interesting for me. The first attempt was a disaster. I followed the recipe too closely and added all the flour called for, and it was too much. I threw the dough away and immediately tried again. This time I decreased the flour by about 1/2 cup and the dough was great and easy to work with. The first rise took one full hour to double in bulk rather than the 30 minutes the recipe states. I then formed into two loaves, wrapped and place in the refrigerator over night. This may be where my problem lies. I pulled them out the next morning for the second rise, and they had risen in the refrigerator some, but they never rose anymore after that. I went ahead and baked them with egg white/water wash and a small pan of water on the bottom oven rack. The loaves came out pretty flat - actually REALLY flat. BUT, the taste was very, very good. I've never had a problem like this with bread loaves before so it may have been the overnight refrigeration. I'm certainly not going to rate this recipe on appearance and flatness. It gets a solid 4 stars for taste. I'm not sure if I'll try this one again. I think there are a few other recipes I'd like to try that may work better for me.

Yummy!  This is one awesome baguette recipe...Easy because you can use the dough cycle of your breadmaker, which cuts the "work" out of the whole process.  The taste is absolutely wonderful.  Crusty & golden on the outside, & soft and chewy on the inside.  I never thought I could make an actual French Baguette on my own, but now, I can.  The only issue I have is that the baguettes disappear quickly.  Next time, I will double the recipe & include some whole wheat flour for a little more fiber & nutrition.  Thanks Judy, for sharing!

I don't have a bread machine so did it by hand following Devinehealth7's directions. I made 8 6-7 inch breads and they came out great!! I wlll use them to make breakfast hoagies for work..scramble an egg, add cheese and sausage,bacon or ham and fill the baguette.They were great just buttered with dinner. I will make these alot. I just wish all the bread recipes here had the instructions for those of us that do not have a bread machine.

This is delicious and I use the recipe all the time. I particularly like it to serve with the Tuscan Cream Cheese Spread from this site. I still suck at shaping the loaves so mine are kind of ugly but the flavor is perfect.  Very well written recipe also.

The best French baguettes ever! I followed the exact recipe but baked them a little bit longer. It's perfect! My husband loves it, so does our little girl. :) I served them with all soup I made and converted the leftover ones to croutons the next day.

I just want to add to all the other reviewers, what a fantastic keeper this bread is. It stays soft and fresh, longer than any other bread I have made. I also baked two loaves, sliced them, and put them in the freezer for over two weeks. When I came home from vacation, I took one loaf out of the freezer, thawed it, and it was just as fresh as when it went in. Thanks so much for this recipe.

This bread has a great flavor and texture. Very soft. I don`t have a bread machine and, I think, you don`t need it for this recipe. I agree, this bread isn`t very crunchy.

My family really loved these.  My husband wanted a crunchier crust, but I liked it the way it was.  They were simple to make, but for me, will take a few tries to get them looking more like a baguette, and less like Pippi Longstockings legs!

This bread is simply the best. My sister demands I make it every day for her to  eat fresh from the oven. A whole loaf is gone within 10 minutes flat. No joking. I add a half a tablespoon more of sugar than directed just because we like it a little sweeter. This bread is great plain right out of the oven or with a little cream cheese. MMMMH. It is also very versatile in terms of forming it. I've made large loaves, small loaves, flat rolls, round loaves. They really work well when rolled tightly and not allowed to rise very much (About 1.5 inch diameter or so) - To make a perfect 'scooping' size for dips.

This bread is excellent.  I have still not found my favorite recipe that I lost in a house fire, but this comes the closest.  Most french bread is to dense and this is very light and soft in the middle.  I could also see where this would be great for bruessetta.  Good Job!

After reading all of the rave reviews I decided to try my hand at this recipe. Because it doesn't call for any  fancy ingredients I thought the bread would be floury and bland, but I took a chance anyway. OMG it came out perfect! It was crunchy and golden on the outside (thanks to another reviewers advice to use egg white) and so soft and chewy on the inside. I recently got a bread machine to cut myself off from the store bought garbage, but I hadn't found any recipes that were satisfying. This recipe is it!

Followed the recipe exactly and the bread was delicious.  It looked so good, my husband thought it was store-bought!  Using the dough cycle on my macine, I did not need to proof it once more after it was finished.  Just rolled it out, shaped, and let it rise for an additional 30 minutes before putting it in the oven.  Sprinkle some garlic powder after applying the egg wash for more flavor!

These were very good and easy, and that says a lot coming from a bread novice like me!  Followed recipe exactly and the one thing I didn't like was the way the egg wash made the loaves look - not what I'm used to in a baguette.  Maybe next time I'll just sprinkle with some water. But flavorwise, this bread was excellent!

Very good fresh bread.  All of my relatives were impressed.  Used AP flour and added the salt after creating the dough per reviewer suggestion.  I also added dried herbs to the mix before I started the bread machine.  The texture was incredibly soft.  Absolutely lovely.

This recipe is perfectly balanced and makes boulangerie-style, table-worthy baguettes.  It's easy, straightforward, and the only big component seems to be time.  On another note, it's also produced the best pizza I've ever made.  This recipe is definitely worth thinking about if you have company coming over.

Very good.  Delicious, and easy.  I did use the bread machine and baked for the 35 min--made it much more golden brown that way.  Somehow I'd popped my rolling pin in the dishwasher and it wasn't available when I needed to roll out the dough.  So, I improvised and treated it like a pizza dough, stretching it by hand.  Then I cut it in half and rolled it up.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent baguettes -- I made the mistake of bringing these to the office once and now I keep getting asked about them.  I kneaded the dough by hand -- adding salt slowly as I went.  Then, the mixture I brushed on top used egg whites & water, with a tiny bit of melted butter mixed in.  I also have tried throwing water in the bottom of the oven at the beginning of baking, as some have suggested, but it doesn't seem to have a noticeable effect.

I always get nervous when I see recipes that call for bread machines, cuz I don't have one.  But I didn't need one!  Just some thorough kneading (thanks to enthusiastic helpers) worked just fine.  

You DON'T need to add anything, but the second time around, I put in a pinch of oregano, parsley, and thyme, then mixed garlic salt with butter and brushed it ontop halfway though baking.  And I think I accidentally discovered the Olive Garden breadstick recipe!

This totally reminds my family of the baguettes in Paris. We use this all the time for sandwiches or spreads. I had to add 2 more tablespoons of water- not sure why.

This is really awesome! I have been making bread by hand and machine for years and yet to come up with a good baguette. I used the machine to do the hard work and followed instructions. They were crusty on the outside and chewy inside. My daughter who is home sick has polished off most of one already. This one is a keeper!

After trying many bread machine recipes from this site and being disappointed with all of them (all being far too dense for my taste), I finally came across this one. WOW!WOW!WOW!WOW! What more can I say? It had a perfectly  crispy crust on the outside, and the most wonderful, flavorful, airy softness in the middle. This is what crusty bread is supposed to be!!! I WILL be making this again and again! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I love it and have no problems with achieving a crispy crust provided I put a metal bowl with water in the oven. I make this at least once a week!

This had a great taste and was good but I'm definitely going to keep working on it - my bread didn't seem to rise as well as it should have - but nonetheless, I will keep making it.

Incredible!!  Did not use a bread machine.  Sprinkled kosher salt, parsley and parmesan on top.  Next time will do a egg white wash instead of yolk.  No one believed that I made this bread, excellent 'company' dish.

An excellent recipe with great taste, however, I did make some errors. I accidentally added the yolk to the dough, but my bread still turned out great and I just brushed it with the egg white. I also didn't realize my yeast was expired, so my bread did not rise as much as it should have, but it was still excellent and everyone loved it. I can't wait to try this again and do it the right way! lol

Great recipe for a first time french bread baker!  I made this in my Kitchen Aid and truly felt like Martha Stewart this afternoon. :)  I'll try misting the oven next time. Mine didn't rise as much as I would have liked, but good enough for my basil, tomato, and mozzarella sammie!  Oh so good!  Thank you for posting!

These don't come out perfectly for me everytime, but good enough that I use this recipe often. It's probably more my abilities as a baker than the recipe's fault. It's so satisfying to eat warm, homemade bread!

These were good and easy to make. I didn't roll the dough into a rectangle. I just divided it then rolled it back and forth a few times to shape them into long loaves.

These were really good, but they didn't turn out crispy, even with the water in the oven trick and egg white. It may have been because I had to leave so my dad took over that part. I left him instructions, but who knows?

This is an amazing recipe!!  I make it almost once a week.  I use my Kitchenaid mixier instead of my bread machine and it is still perfect every time.  Dinner guests thought that I purchased the bread from a local bakery known for their bread.  The last time I made this, I made 4 "hoagie" rolls for sandwiches......heavenly!!!!

When baking French or Italian breads, I brush the tops with a mixture of olive oil, oregano, and thyme. For bread I plan to use for garlic toast, I also add a little garlic powder and a pinch of salt. It gives a beautiful golden brown crust and the smell when it's baking is absolutely amazing!!!

Oh so good. They were a bit skinny for my taste, but I'll see if I can do something about that next time. The taste and method could not be improved on.

wow!  I doubled the recipe and made 4 loaves - 2 were gone within 15 minutes :o)
  I used my kitchenaid mixer (don't need the bread machine since I got that!! LOL) and it was so easy to whip up... perfectly yummy.  I served it with dipping oil (ev olive oil, romano cheese, red pepper flakes, and lots of garlic) and oh my goodness...mmmmmm. I have become a better cook because of all recipes...thank you so much

The dough was harder to work with than what I'm used to, and it turned out kind of flat on the bottom. Otherwise, this was a really good recipe. The bread had a beautiful color to it. Thanks!

Wonderful recipe, you don't need the bread machine, just follow other suggestions.  Comes out better than anything store bought!

Perfect recipe! i did not use a bread machine, but used my stand mixer to mix/knead the bread. Loaves turned out perfectly. In fact, I have another bunch rising as I write this, because the two loaves I made yesterday are already gone!

These have to be the best bread I've baked! I even tried to shape them into some resemblance of an actual french baguette :) I basically followed the directions except kneaded by hand and used 2 1/4 tsp of regular yeast.

This recipe came out wonderful! I did not have the time to let bread dough rise after taking it out of the bread machine and the final product was wonderful!  Very good flavor with little effort.

This bread is GREAT!!! The first time I followed the instructions on rolling the dough into a rectangle and then rolling it up, it was coming undone in the oven. So the next time I separated the dough into 2 and shaped the baguettes myself. they turned out perfect. This bread doesn't last a day in our house!

This is such a wonderfully simple baguette recipe that tastes not only divine, (especially warm from the oven) but also authentic. It surpasses anything you can buy at a grocery store stateside.  These make awesome sandwiches!  Thanks for this recipe!

Delicious. I don't do bread machines, so I made in the mixer by adding the water, yeast, and sugar, then added salt and flour, and just let the mixer run a few minutes to knead. I just let it rise in the mixer bowl.  This is a chewy and yummy bread, and the leftovers made great french toast this morning.

This is the most awesome recipe. I made them exactly as directed, and they came out AWESOME. Did I mention it's awesome? Seriously, I made it two nights in a row, and the husband and I have decided that we're never buying grocery-store French bread again.

I don't have a bread machine so I followed some of the other reviewers' instructions to make it without one.  It was fantastic last night with a mozzarella and mushroom chicken.  After dinner, I had a lot of bread left, so I sliced it all up and used it for an overnight french toast recipe, which I'm enjoying right now!

Excellent!  Possibly my new favorite bread recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly with a couple of changes:

* added rosemary
* brushed top with margarine instead of 
egg
* divided into 2, did not roll up, just shaped
* sprinkled coarse, kosher salt on top

YUM!

Followed the recipe although I didn't use a bread machine like most of the reviews said it still came out great... Thanks for the recipe... I know I just signed up for on this site today but I've been taking recipes off this site for quite some time... I make these all the time now and no long buy French Baguettes from the store... My family loves it...

I have made this about 15 times already...in about two weeks!  Everyone just loves it!  I started making it just how the recipe states, until I ran out of Bread flour (I went through a bag and a half making this bread so many times!) After the Bread flour was gone I tried it with whole wheat (2 tbls wheat gluton and enough wheat flour to make as recipe states) and I used all-purpose (also adding wheat gluton).  All of them are delicious and have never actually cooled in my house...they are all eaten so fast they don't get a chance to get to room temperature!

These were fantastic. I used my Breadman and placed warm water and salt in first. Followed with all purpose flour and 2 teas. regular yeast on top. Put on dough cycle. After the cycle was finished I cut in half and shaped into  2-16 inch loaves. I didn't roll out. Brushed with egg yolk and water. I let rise for 90 min. Also baked 5 minutes longer.

This tastes just like real French Baguettes. My husband ate all the bread, almost forgetting the homemade meat sauce I slaved 4 hours over! Great as a French Baguette or sandwich sub. Nice and light. You can add poppy seeds on top before cooking.

I made this into four sublike buns.  We used them with  "easy slow cooker french dip" from this site.  What a wonderful meal.  The whole family enjoyed.  Great bread recipe!

Great recipe- I was surprised that there was no source of fat in this recipe. I cannot tell you how well it "keeps" because, well, we ate it all.
The crust was not as crunchy-crusty as I would have liked, even though I placed a shallow pan with a bit of water in the bottom of the oven to create some steam.

Wonderful texture, great flavor.  By using egg white rather than egg yolk to brush the crust makes for a very low fat bread.  A keeper!

Delicious! I made thin breadstick loaves this time, and I'm going to have some fun experimenting with other variations.

I may have done something weird with this recipe without realizing it, but I ended up with extremely thick crunchy crust (not a problem with me, I love the crunch) but a rather wet middle...it was alright though, everyone still loved it!

This bread is wonderful! I don't have a bread machine. I combine all the dry ingredients and then add the water! LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!! My hubbie considers this heavenly.
