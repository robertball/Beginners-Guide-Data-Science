This is one of my favorite breakfasts:) I am not Paleo, but I still love it. Super simple and healthy!! I usually use around 1/2 cup of milk for every frozen banana, and then allow to freeze for about 20-25 minutes before drinking. The consistency turns out perfect for me. Some of my favorite additions are cocoa powder, cinnamon, mint, peanut butter, and instant coffee. All delicious!! Occasionally, I use almond milk in place of the coconut. Great either way!! Thanks for sharing:)

Delicious. It doesn't get any easier or any healthier than this to indulge in a creamy sweet treat. I used frozen banana and thus needed more coconut milk. Also sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg. YUM!

I used two small bananas and did have to increase the coconut milk a bit, but this is great. I added a teaspoon of roasted almond butter,too.  This will be in regular rotation for me!

This is not bad, but I had to double the coconut milk to get something closer to a shake and not banana ice cream. I have had other mock shakes and ice creams made with bananas. I think the coconut dominates the flavor a bit, taking away from that ice cream flavor. However, I understand that this is the Paleo diet which doesn't include milk or other dairy products. I made 1/2 recipe and it gave enough of a serving for me.

This had good flavor but I definitely thinned it out a little with more milk.

this was amazing. not the most creative recipe youâ€™ll find for a banana shake, but it is super yummy. around 60g carbs, though, which was a little high for me- i was super sleepy after an hour or so. i followed the recipe exactly, but added 1/4 water as well. definitely recommend!

I love it!  I added some whey protein powder to make it creamier.
