*You can substitute the sherry with apple juice.  
This is my recipe.  I keep small amounts of apple juice on hand by buying baby apple juice.

This was very delicious!  Making the marinade as written, it took a little over one lemon to get the 1/4 cup (you ALWAYS have to save the zest for other recipes!).  I did use three cloves of garlic.  We always use bone-in pork chops when possible because the flavor is so much richer than just the boneless!  One last thought is that I grilled only three pork chops, and to do four would mean that the marinade would be pretty sparse.  In this case, I would not necessarily make more---rather, take a little more than 1/2 cup out for the marinade and turn them in the bag a little more frequently.  I did not use all the reserved marinade when BBQing the chops.  This was excellent, and I will definitely make this again!

I followed this recipe with exception of the sherry. I was a very nice change from the traditional "BBQ" pork chop flavor. Worth a try.

These were good and I did not even marinade them since I did not have time.  I just sprinkled some crushed red pepper into the marinade and basted the boneless chops while they cooked.   Next time I will marinade them.  Definitely with trying.

This turned out really good, my meat was so tender and the flavor was very good, I added a little lemon zest to the mix and I couldn't resist a pinch of red pepper flakes in the basting sauce.

This was just an average marinade. It was good, but I think it needs a little more seasoning. I will keep it in my recipes and try it again soon. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good, although the flavor was a bit muted.  However, my 2 year old daughter loved it, so that is a plus!

Honey-Soy Pork Chop Haiku: "This was just so-so. But I love a grilled pork chop! Glad that I tried it!" I deviated from my stand-by marinade that I use for chicken and chops (AR's spectacular "Pretty Chicken Marinade") b/c this was just so simple to toss together. It was a nice mild flavor, but really needs some kind of oomph. Springtime-sunny-evenings have me poised over the grill at any opportunity, so thank you Bradshaw Family for giving me the chance to try a different marinade!

Tried it today, and everybody loved it!  I cooked it in the crock pot, so with 3 lbs. I just doubled the recipe and had plenty of sauce.

My pork was tasty and moist after grilling in this marinade, but I found it didn't impart much added flavor.  I made the recipe exactly as written for three boneless pork tenderloin chops.  They were pretty thick, maybe too dense to soak up much marinade?  I did marinate for a good 10 hours, rotating the bag frequently.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR, I enjoyed trying it.

This was sooo good! I cooked it on a cast iron skillet instead of the grill and let the marinade caramelize. I will def. be making it again!

The marinade was excellent. However 2-3 hours wasn't enough time for the marinade for the chicken. The flavor didn't really got into the meat. I recommend overnight marinade in your fridge

Threw these on a Traeger and let them heat up a little more than 160.  Was a little worried how they might turn out but after a rest they sliced easily and once served could be cut with a fork.   Amazing flavor.  Just a perfect salty/sweet

I used this on a 2-3lb. Porky loin. I omitted the sherry bc I didn't have any but used all the other ingredients along with some brown sugar that I rubbed into it all the way around. Then wrapped in foil to bake and keep it moist. My husband and kids loved it! I will be doing this again!!
