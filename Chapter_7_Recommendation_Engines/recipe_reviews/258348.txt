I love rice pudding for breakfast, but so far I haven't been a fan of quinoa. This really helped me to like quinoa for breakfast. It had a nice chewy texture. My only issue with the recipe, is that it was way too thick for me--I don't think it needed to simmer 10-15 minutes at the end as stated, half that time would have been fine. I ended up adding almost another full cup of milk to get it nice and creamy again. I also thought it needed to be a tad sweeter and added another tablespoon of honey. Thanks so much for the idea of mixing rice and quinoa--I will definitely try this again!
