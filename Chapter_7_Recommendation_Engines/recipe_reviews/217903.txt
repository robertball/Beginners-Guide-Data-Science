It breaks my heart to give a bad review of a recipe someone took the time to post. But even though I followed the recipe (which took me closer to 40 minutes with the chopping and shredding), and rather than "cakes" I got "mush".

The "heat" in this recipe comes from "spicy mayonnaise"... for which no recipe is given. I used a spicy mayo recipe I found elsewhere on the web but the "heat" disappeared in the mix.

The "bunch of sliced green onions" turned out to be 2 cups worth. The same with the parsley. 

Once I mixed everything together, the mixture was on the runny-side, but I though it might gel in the 'fridge. But when it came time to cook them, the cakes began to fall apart on my spatula so I lifted them by hand and reformed them in the pan. I cooked them in two batches of 6, letting them cook a little longer on the first side, hoping for some cohesion. It didn't work. The end result resembles a crab-like stew, with flavors that overpower the subtle flavor of crab. I plan to add the mix to a salad or maybe a pasta dish. 

Were I to try this again, I'd increase the crab to 16 or 18 oz., add another egg and some flour, use just 1 c. sliced scallions and 1 c. chopped parsley. I'd also use regular mayo and add chili and/or cayenne and Tobasco sauce until the flavor reaches "spicy", and I wouldn't bother with the black beans.

Unless something is missing from what's posted here, this recipe (unfortunately) doesn't make crab cakes worth the price of the crab.
