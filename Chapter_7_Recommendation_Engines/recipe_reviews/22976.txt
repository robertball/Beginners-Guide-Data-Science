This recipe was awesome. I made the process alot easier by putting all but the avacado in a food processor...no chopping! It is caliente (hot) tho.....so if you like the dip more mile omit or lessen the jalapeno's. Ole'!

Nice refreshing dip, but PLEASE leave out the salt and add some garlic instead.

Wonderful guacamole, but do cut the amount of salt in half at least! I also cut the amount of jalepeno in half as well and when it states one onion diced I used only 2 Tbsp. of finely chopped red onion.  I de-seeded the tomato (used 1 roma) and added 1/4 tsp. of cumin and 2 cloves of minced garlic from a jar. Overall, pretty good with warm tortilla chips.

This recipe was really good with one exception, it was too salty.  I think next time I'll only add 1 tsp. of salt but other than that, it's a keeper.  Thanks!

I agree, too salty.  I also found that the ingredients were way too much for the amount of avocados I had.  Mine were a bit small so I put 3 small avocados in and found that a whole onion and tomato would have been WAY too much.  I also only used one jalapeno.  I suggest more avocados or less of the other ingredients.

Just looking over the measurements of ingredients  alerts you instantly that there is something majorly wrong with this recipe which would have nothing to do with individual taste preferences.  I don't believe anyone could tolerate, let alone like, guacamole prepared with this much salt!  So strike one, right off the bat.  Second, for my taste buds anyway, one whole onion, two jalapenos and one large tomato to two avocados is just simply off too!  Could this possibly have been for maybe SIX avocados? The lime juice, as well, is probably twice the amount it should be for this many avocados. I did make guacamole with these ingredients, but I salted *to taste* and added the other ingredients more in proportion to the two avocados. I also added a small clove of minced garlic.  With significant changes in measurements this could be a great, basic guacamole.  If prepared as written, however, I don't know how anyone could eat it.

This guacamole was excellent. I am a cook-in-training, and I had never made guac before. My boyfriend is from Texas, so I was a bit intimidated by the prospect. However, we sat and ate it ALL NIGHT LONG, making ourselves very fat in the process. :-P One thing that recipe does not say and perhaps this is a no-brainer for some: you need to seed the jalepenos and remove the membrane. We almost removed the lining of our mouths!

This was way too salty - I wish I had read the reviews before I made it because apparently I am not the only one that thinks so.  My quacamole was bad.  Thanks.

Very good guacamole. But my son did not like it so hot. Next time I'll skip the peppers. We loved it with chicken tacos.

good recipe but needs some tweeking. I would definitely add a couple cloves of fresh minced garlic and cut salt down to 1/4 teaspoon. Be sure to use plum(roma) tomatoes because they have less juice. Also, if you plan on making this ahead of time (no more that 24 hours), I find it's best to add the tomatoes right before serving. I find the juice causes the guacamole to brown faster...even with the lime juice.

I thought this was way too salty (and I love salt!).  Otherwise it was quite good, so I will try making it again without about half the salt.

Delicious!  1/2 the Salt, and added 2 cloves Garlic as Jillian sugested. Seeded 2 jalapenos, but we like it hot.  Didn't have limes, so used Lemon juice and it tasted fine (next time I'll make sure to have limes) Thank you for a wonderful and easy Dip, just in time for Super Bowl!

Definitely reduce the salt! I put 1 tsp and that was still plenty. I'm sure the size of the avocado makes a big difference. I put 3 in since mine were pretty small. I also only used 1/2 an onion and bottled hot peppers. Good flavor. thanks

Cut the salt!!  I would recommend 1/2 tsp. instead of 2 tsp.  Other than that, it's a good recipe.  That much salt ruins it.

I make this guacamole for almost every potluck and it is one of the first dishes to disappear. It is easy and delicious. I add a smidge less onion and a bit more cilantro just because we enjoy it that way. Would recommend this recipe for any avacado lover!

This recipe is great, however I would do like everyone else said and reduce the amount of salt. I would also reduce the amount of fresh lime juice to 1 tbsp. (instead of 2 tbsp.). 2 tbsp. was way too much lime.

I also wish that I had read the reviews prior to making this recipe.  It was way too salty and needed an extra avocado due to the amount of the other ingredients.  Otherwise, it was one of the best gaucamole recipes I have found.  And do make sure you remove the seeds from the jalapeno peppers unless that is the way you like it.  I will definitely make this again.

OMG!  I LOVE this recipe and make it all the time.  Everyone loves it.  I love how there isn't any sour cream added, but that there is lots of garlic and cilantro!  Always a hit!  I put it in my 7 layer taco dip and it truly transforms the entire dip!

Almost perfect guacamole!  Ok, so I used less salt & added a clove of minced garlic, but that's just b/c we love garlic!  I think it would still be great guacamole as written.  This list of ingredients (plus garlic) is what I think of when I think good old fashioned guacamole.  The basics are here, so just adjust the amount of each ingredient until it suits your taste.  Thanks for the starter recipe!  :)

This does seem to have a little too much salt. However, a pinch of salt goes nicely with the lime and cilantro flavors, and adds some depth. Kosher salt is the way to go. Oh, and keeping the "seed" in the guacamole doesn't actually do anything. The lime juice (citric acid) actually prevents browning due to oxidation (contact with the air). If you actually want to prevent browning in the fridge, cover the guacamole with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap down onto the surface to prevent the air from getting in.

Delicious! I didn't have a jalapeño pepper so I added 1/2 tablespoon of chili powder instead.

This recipe is great!  I add an extra avocado to the mix for even more guacamole.  It's so easy and delicious, and I always get rave reviews for it.  It's become a staple for me!

Very delicious.  I made this early in the day and let it sit in the frigde so that the flavors could meld together.  A tip from this site suggests to leave the avocado pit inside the bowl while you are chilling your guacamole.  That way it doesn't turn brown and ugly.  Will make again but maybe make it even hotter.  I cut back on the jalapeno because I was serving it to small kids as well.  Thanks !

I have made this guacamole several times and everyone loves it.   It's addicting.  People stand around the bowl eating it until it's gone.  I do recommend cutting down the salt and using a red onion.

I think this guacamole is perfect for summer parties! I always add in a handful of bacon, and in the summer I dice a mango to add in as well. Thanks for the recipe!

This was really tasty guacamole. I loved this but my hubby prefers other recipes. I used 3 small avocados and 3/4 tsp. garlic salt. I thought this was great on a bed of shredded lettuce with a dollop of sour cream and served with tortilla chips. I gave it a 5 after cutting the salt. Thanks, I thought this one was worth repeating.

This is an easy, easy recipe to follow and there are NEVER any leftovers. The only thing I would caution you about is the salt.  Mix it in in stages and do some taste tests instead of dumping it all in at once.  Salt is such a personal taste, some like a ton of it, some don't like much at all.  

This recipe is excellent and a real crowd-pleaser.  Don't be shy about serving it up!

This is a good start, quick & easy but Way to salty. Omit salt & add garlic. Salsa works well & skip the jalapeno's.

Very good but way too salty.  Will decrease to at least 1 tsp.  Did not use jalepenos since I do not like things hot.  Was very easy to put everything in a food processor.

Awesome!  Halved the recipe to use in a small 7-layer dip. Only complaint was DH whining, "Did you have to use ALL the guacamole in the dip?"  Had to make another batch just for him once the rest of the avacados were ripe.  Thanks LuvAnn!!

Totally rocks!  Served this at a Superbowl party.  Everyone was asking for the recipe. Many commented it was the best Guac they had ever had.  I doubled it and also added about 1/2 cup plain Greek Yogurt, just to stretch it a bit and I always add more cilantro.  Delicious!

I've been looking for a great guac recipe and this was very good! I made some changes: 4 med avacados (very smashed), 2 roma tomatoes (1 in the food processor and 1 sliced), I added a little more cilantro then called for, 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic, and I added 3 small jalapenos (seeded). We really liked it, but I still felt like it needed a little more of a kick, if you like it a little spicy. I think next time I will try some other suggestions such as cumin and cayenne pepper. - OH! I forgot to mention that the only salt I added was a few sprinkles out of the shaker which was perfect

We loved this recipe.  We did make a few alterations to adjust to our liking.  We added a few more avocados, cut back on the red onion a little bit, added a little bit of cumin and chili powder in place of the jalapenos.  It turned out wonderful!!

Great! I used 4 Avacados instead of 2 because there was a lot of onion. Also used 1 jalapeno so it wasn't so spicy for the kids. Otherwise it was Awesome!

I'm giving this 4 stars because it's almost perfect.  My advice is to leave out the salt and only add it if you need more salt.  The salt on the chips seems to be all we ever need.  As for the rest, vary the amounts to suit your tastes.  We like more avocado and cilantro, less onion (we use red) and tomato and jalapeno.  I add some fresh garlic occasionally.

Reduce all ingredients except the lime juice, the cilantro (you could even add a little extra cilantro) and, of course, keep the amount of avocado the same.  In my opinion, it would have been way too salty and filled with other stuff aside from avocado to have the texture and taste I like.  I added 1/8 tsp. ground cumin at the same time as the salt.  I also toss one minced clove of garlic in with the tomatoes, onion, etc.

We made this to use in the Seven Layer Taco Dip from this site (instead of the layer of lettuce). We couldn't stop eating it as we were assembling the layers. Given a few more minutes we would have needed to make another batch to make our layer! This is the best guacamole I have eaten. Most times we get it at a Mexican restaurant it is lifeless and tastes like avocado with some other stuff thrown in. This is full of flavor and the jalapeños add a nice kick. I probably added a bit more lime juice than it called for but that's cause I love lime juice in Mexican food. 
I am about to head to the kitchen to make another batch to go with tonight's dinner.
Thanks for the great recipe!
EDIT: Made this again tonight and it was as good as I remembered it. This is as good as guacamole gets!!!!

Very tasty! I put in half the salt and that was more than enough (I think 1/2 teaspoon would have been better- especially if serving with already salty tortilla chips). I also used only half the onion and 3/4 of the lime juice and that was plenty of those as well. Thanks for sharing.

There has to be a mistake here with the salt. There is no way there is two teaspoons of salt in this recipe. I used only one and it was too salty. I would say a quarter teaspoon would be enough. If there is an error in this recipe, someone should correct it because it is a great guacamole recipe.

Too salty and too spicy.  Next time, I will cut down the amount of salt and jalapeno by half.  I also suggest adding come garlic.  Maybe grind it up in a mortar with the salt so there won't be any garlic chunks.  This is a good recipe to start with but I won't be making it again.

My only suggestion - mix everything together except the avocado, mix it in last, and you will avoid serving guac that is all mushy, wet, and ucky. Small dice the tomato and onion, medium dice the avocado since it's the star.

i should have read the reviews before making this- it was VERY salty and i loovvveee salty food!! I imagine that without all the salt it would have been a very tasty gaucamole, but no one could eat more than a few bites of this because of all the salt. Thanks for the recipe though, I am making it again tonight without the salt, I am sure it will be wonderful.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I followed other's suggestions and omitted the salt.  I added one clove of garlic (although next time I'll use a smaller clove) and mixed it all in my food processor minus the tomatoes.  I think next time I make it I will use only one pepper because, although I like things hot, I find this would be too hot for most company.

WAY TOO MUCH SALT.  I wish I would have read the other reviews before making this.  I think it would be good with 1/4 tsp or 1/3 tsp salt.  The salt ruined guacamole layer of the dip I was making.  Will try next time using a fraction of hte salt.

Pretty good recipe. I only used 1/2 tsp of salt and added some finely chopped fresh garlic. Great with homemade tortilla chips!! (cut white corn tortillas into 4 triangles and fry in corn or canola oil, drain on paper towels and salt. Better then any bag tortilla chip)

I like the mix of stuff, but based on the other reviews, I only put in a dash of salt. It seemed like way too much lime juice (and I love lime juice). I'll try it again, but I'll cut the amount of lime juice

I subbed out the salt for 1 tsp of garlic salt. I also thought 1 whole onion was too much. Afterwards I mixed 2 parts avacado dip with 1 part salsa and 1/2 cup of mozza and baked it @ 400 for 10 - 15min. No need to cool this way, and it's always been really popular dish.

Very yummy.  I was looking for a recipe like this  since a had guacamole a a friends place that was similar.   I would only try using less salt next time.  I try not to use much salt and found it a little salty.

I use about 1tbsp of juice from a lime or lemon, whichever I have on hand. I also learn a trick from mexico to put the seed of 1 avacado in the bowl to keep it from turning brown as fast.

WOW! I really don't like guacamole, but decided to give it a whirl.  This is absolutely delicious. I did cut down on the jalapenos, just because I'm a wimp when it comes to hot foods and used half the salt.  It's a definite keeper in my house.

I loved this recipe though I did alter it. I added garlic salt, a squirt of lemon and just a little picante sauce. I also used fresh pico de gallo that I bought prepackaged instead of adding the onion, cilantro, lime juice and jalapanos separately.

Awesome. So fresh. Used less salt, more lime juice and fresh oregano.  Food processed, then spread on top of home-made buffalo burritos.  Droollllllllllllllll.

This is an OK starter recipe but it's missing a lot of flavor.  I added salt to taste but it's still bland.

This was great... like someone else said it was a bit salty!  I added fresh mangos just for something different, the flavors blended well with eachother, I got a lot of compliments!

I actually used two Florida Avocados (I'm sure Mexican avocados will work as well) instead of Haas and the measurements worked out perfectly (even the salt)!  As a side bonus, the Florida Avocados are much cheaper, making this a new staple in my house.  Per my taste, I did add a little garlic, but only because I am a garlic lover, I'm sure the recipe is still great without it.  Thank you for this recipe, it will be making an appearance at a bar-b-que later tonight!

I've had Guacamole a few times and hated it.  This recipe, I made it for a bunch of my friends, and when I tried it I couldn't stop eating it.  I took others advice and put 1tsp instead of 2 tsp of salt and it was perfect!  The Guacamole was truly a hit at the party, and I loved it too!

I've been making this recipe all my life. I've never had a problem with too much salt as. The recipe should say salt to taste instead of giving a specific amount. As for the rest of the ingredients well if you look at the picture the cook apparently likes it that way. I always put only the amount that looks good to me when I make it.This means that it varys from one time to the next.

WAY TOOOO SALTY!!!!!  I am rating this on the original recipe and it is salty, which ruined the dip.  I swore I would never make another recipe without first reading the reviews, but I did it again and it is too salty.  I even used 3 avocados and the salt was crazy.

I reduced the salt, but it was still too salty for our taste, so we added sour cream to balance it out.  Next time I'll start with no salt and only add a little if needed.

Wonderful, simple recipe.

For those people desiring less spicy food, try de-seeding the jalapenos. If you like spicy (like I do), then the recipe is perfect just the way it is. :) This is coming from someone who almost always modifies recipes to make them taste better. Not this one...mmmm!

Very easy to make. I was in Houston last week and was at a Mexican restaurant. The waiter made us quacamole at our table and it was identical to this recipe except he didn't put the jalapeno pepper in it. This is the best stuff!

Loved this guacamole! I followed the advice of other reviewers, and used only 1/2 tsp salt. I also omitted the onion and used canned jalopeños. Very tasty with warm tortilla chips and salsa! Yum!

Wonderfully fresh and flavorful! The lime keeps the avacado from browning, and adds to the flavor. Yum.

Way too salty! Please read this before you make it because I wish I would have. What a waste of 3 avocados. I had to add one more avocado to this and it was still too salty. This is absolutely inedible.

I didn't measure the salt, just added it to taste (which is what you really should do in recipes like this). It was amazing. We ate this all up while waiting for the enchiladas to get done

I need to try again...used jarred jalapeno, seeds removed, about five slices, and didn't have any cilantro, dried or fresh.  Was too hot for me, could not taste the avocado, just the lime and HOT.  But am 99% sure this was due to my subs...!!

This is what I think of when I hear guac! I made this for a super bowl party and it was a big hit. This is the recipe to make if you like cilantro and lime flavor in your guac. I agree with the other reviews that it can be salty so reduce the salt or leave it out. 
Make sure to make it fresh.

Well, I don't particularly like guacamole, but my husband does, and he said that this was great.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut way back on the salt.  I just added a little at a time until he said it tasted right.  I also added some garlic.  This was so easy to make, I'm sure I will make it again and again.

We doubled everything except for the onion (which we halved) and the tomato.  Very easy to make and great to bring to parties!

This dish was really good. I omitted the onion and jalapeno pepper and salted to taste. My husband inhaled the dip.

I followed the recipe exactly and this was my first time ever making it.. I was very surprised at how easy it was to make and it did taste good but it was alittle too salty and I personally didn't care for the chunky tomatoes in it. I'll make this again b/c it was good but I will defiantly be alittle more flexable on the ingredients. It's a Great recipe t work on to make it your own! THANKS!

We love this combination of fresh salsa and guacamole. Didn't discover this method until we moved to Texas, and now like this better than the creamy guacamoles.  I also add some finely minced garlic, or garlic powder if I'm lazy!

One of the best guac recipes to date. I, too, reduced the salt to 1 tsp but other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it got rave reviews. This one's saved to the recipe box!

This is the way I have made Guac since spending some time in Corpus Christi.  Loose all the salt, just a pinch or two will do, add more cilantro and it is a hit.  I know the salt thing is person taste, butt...still a great recipe

If you want a simple, delicious guac recipe...this is IT! I didn't have any cilantro on hand, so I followed the recipe minus that. Also, I used only 1 medium size jalapeno and that provide just the right amount of heat. I used some canned diced tomatoes & that worked great. Overall, DELICIOUS and will definitely make it again!

Great recipe. I usually hate guacamole, but my husband and I inhaled this in one sitting. I did use less salt and I also used 1/2 of a Vidalia onion instead of a yellow onion. It gave it a great sweet taste. I'm sure even a white sweet onion would work also. Thanks so much for this recipe! I'm addicted!

The best! I didn't have fresh tomato so I chopped up a can of diced tomatoes with green chili peppers. I had a little bit of left over canned corn that I added as well. I doubled the recipe, but halved the salt. Really yummy!

Too much salt - just add to taste.  I go light on the onion and tomato too because I like the avocado to shine.  
This is the very best basic guacomole recipe.

Very, very good!  I followed recipe exactly.  After it sat in my refer for a couple of hours I tasted it and felt it needed a bit of sugar to help balance the flavors.  1/2 teaspoon did te trick.  This is a keeper!!!

I don't like guacamole, but I actually enjoyed this.  My husband loved it - he's the guac fan in the family.  I did change it up a tiny bit.  Hubby likes it chunky so I left aside 1/2 of an avacado and chopped it up to fold in to the dip in the end.  I used 1 jalapeno and added 1 tsp garlic.  Salt? I used 1/2 of what recipe called for and it was plenty.  Yum!

This recipe was unbearably salty. I made it per the listed specifications, and gagged on the result. 1 tablespoon salt is way too much - can this amount be right???
I had to add several more avacados and a little sugar to balance out the overload of salt and make this recipe eatable.

I would agree with some of the other reviewers that it is very salty.  I wonder if 2t is a typo?  I cut the recipe in half and used 1/4t and it was still too salty.  I will make this one again, but I will cut the salt way back.

This is a great recipe!  I don't use the jalapeno because my kids like guac, but not spicy stuff.  But otherwise this is a HUGE hit every time I make it!  I recommend adding a couple of cloves of minced garlic as well.

I did cut the salt back by about half as was recommended by other reviewers. But with that said, I got RAVE reviews on this guacamole and had no leftovers from my guests of only a small (4-6 guests) dinner party!

I never thought I would eat guacamole, this is the best dip I have ever had. It doesn't last a day between myself and my wife. It is perfect, I usually throw in a little more salt and ball park some of the others (not measure). Still amazing.

This guacamole is the best! I served it at my party and it was a hit. I was asked to make it for an upcoming bridal shower and I have to make enough for 100 people! I leave out the jalapenos though and instead of salt I add some garlic powder like someone suggested. Mmmmm!

My family and I had nacho night the other day and this was great guacamole.  this was my first time making and it was very simple.  I did alter the recipe slightly I used one fresh jalapeno and about 1 1/2 tbs of pickled jalapenos and i used the juice of one lime and it was the perfect compliment to our meal.

Loved this recipe!  It was a real winner, especially used with Seven Layer Taco Dip by Sue Case.  I used 1/2 onion instead of a whole one and 1 teaspoon salt.  Also, my family like it spicer, so I used more jalapeno peppers. (Harrah, OK)

My daughter Alexis needed a Mexican recipe for her class project. Well, we came across LuvAnn's Guacamole, and we were so glad. "It was out of this world!" We thought it was sooo delicious! Thank you LuvAnn for your recipe!! We rate this recipe a 5 Star!

I made this today and while it was VERY easy to make it was EXTREMELT SALTY!  Instead of the 2 teaspoons(which I thought was a lot to begin with) I would add 1/4 tsp of salt.  I had to counter the salt with lots of sugar and a little more lime juice.  Would make again jut tweak it a little.

I was looking for a guac recipe that was similar to the appetizer we get at On The Border where they make the guac in front of you.  When I saw this recipe, I knew this was it.  And it was very good!  My husband wanted jalepenos added, but I don't like hot stuff so I left them out.  Next time I'll chop him a small one and he can add it to his own food.  This one is going in my recipe book and I look forward to making it for get togethers in the future!

I think it's a sin to add garlic to guacamole... if you want authentic Mexican guacamole anyway and that's why I love this recipe so much. This recipe tastes just like it does in Mexico. Delicious!

I thought this would be better with less onion - either that or add another avocado - the onion drowned out the other flavors.  I will try again though!

This was OK.  I only used 1 teaspoon of salt and added garlic powder.  After tasting it I added a couple of tablespoons of thick salsa.

Holly guacamole, that’s a lot of salt!! I put in half and it was real salty. I used only about a 1/4 of an onion. I did use the full amount of lime and found that it was overpowering. Was this recipe intended for 6 or more avocados??

I've make this recipe so frequently that I don't even use the exact recipe anymore, I just go by taste and memory.  I tend to add more avocado and less jalapeño just due to personal preference and I don't mash the avocado, just the stirring of the ingredients partially blends it into the mix.  If I'm using delectable fresh ingredients, I want to enjoy seeing them.  This is delicious, definitely worth a try.

I love this guacamole.  It has everything in it that I like.  Beware of salt, I put 1 teaspoon and it was probably more than it needed.  Add a little at a time till its like you want.  I also put less onion, about 1/3 of a red onion.  I used 2 jalapeños from my garden.   It turned out great!

Best recipe ever!!! I do tweak it a little, I am not a fan of big chunks so I put all the ingredients into the food processor and zip zip.... done! I also typically use serrano peppers instead of the jalapenos. I also drop in a few seeds. I also use a red onion. It has more kick that way!

Leave out most of the salt and it is very good.

This is very close to my recipe, one which has converted several guacamole haters.  I add half-bunch of cilantro and a splash of white vinegar.  As for the salt comments,  always salt to taste. Avacado has a very narrow salt tolerance: just a little too little and it tastes bland; just a little too much and it tastes salty.

This was awesome....except....I did reduce the salt to 1 teaspoon and only added one large fresh jalapeno (seeds and ribs removed).  Everyone devoured it!!!!

This was good, but we thought it had a lot of tomatoes and not as much flavor as some of the authentic Mexican guacamoles in Az.  Put in a little seasoning and less tomato and it would be great.  We loved it never turned brown.  Thanks.

This is the same recipe I've been using for guacamole for years although I prefer mine without cilantro.  To make it even easier, I don't even mash the avocado but like to leave it diced, so the guacamole has a more chunkier texture.  As far as salt goes, I just use it at the end to taste.  Once you get used to this recipe, you'll never have to follow the quanities listed...it's all by how you and your family likes it.

Lovely. I don't care for avocado...and I LOVED this...so did my family.

I altered a tiny bit by adding 4 chopped cloves of garlic.

Cheers!

Definitely a good recipe.  This was my first time making guacamole, and this recipe is simple, yet tasty!  I followed someone elses advice about not adding salt, but it didn't have the right taste at first, so I sprinkled some in afterwards.  I would suggest that you leave the salt for last, and then decide how much salt you want to add at the end.

My very first guacamole and it turned out fantastic.  Before I didn't even like avocados and now I'm a converted fan.  My husband declared it the best guacamole ever, he should know, he used to travel to Mexico alot. THANKS!!!

Great taste, texture, and color but too salty.  I'll decrease the amount of salt next time.  Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper!

Delicious!  I made a few minor changes to this recipe.  I used only 1/2 teaspoon of salt, which was plenty, and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice rather than the lime juice.  My family doesn't like   anything spicy, so I left out the jalapenos.  My father pronounced this the best guacamole he has ever had and bought a huge batch of avocados so I could make more of this.    Thanks!

This gauc was pretty good, I only added 1/2 tsp salt & a half a jalapeno-still too spicy for me. I'll leave out the pepper next time.

This is my recipe except add 2 more small avocados, and use 1 teaspoon of seasoned salt instead of 2 of regular salt.  Awesome.  PS - Guacamole should NOT be smooth!

YUM!!  This was the first time I'd made guacamole and it turned out perfect.  The only thing I changed was, I used 3 avacado's.  They were on the small side.  Great recipe.  I'll be making it a LOT over the summer for sure.

I made this over christmas, and it was devoured in no time!  I altered a bit, by adding and extra avacado, and not using cilantro.  Served with "Tostito's hint of lime" chips, so yummy!

Easy and awesome. A must to have or bring to any BBQ or party.   I use bottled jalapenos and a little juice and even those who don't like hot food like this.

This was a very simple and basic recipe for guacamole.  We added some garlic powder, salsa and left out the jalapeno peppers since some were sensitive to heat.  Thanks Luv-Ann.
