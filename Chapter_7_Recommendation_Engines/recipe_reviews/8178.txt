I have made this same exact recipe for years but I bake mine in a loaf pan. I also do not use any sauce on mine. I think it is great without it.

this is really soft and light. i couldnt bring myself to eat the sauce though it looked and smelled like a pan of melted butter and really put me off. the cake by itself was great though.

The best Date nut cake we have ever made. Moist and delicious we added one 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and doubled the diced Medjool dates for a rich and satisfying taste treat. Thank you...

Oh my goodness! What an amazing recipe! I cut it in half and used a small bundt pan then baked on the top shelf of my halogen oven with the extender ring on at 160C for 30 mins. Perfect! so most and tasty... Not much left by the time it had cooled it was that good!

This is a perfect cake for a small number of people that don t need to have a big cake for a week. I used an 8 round commercial grade pan. It made a thick layer I was able to split in to two. I filled and frosted it with cream cheese icing.

My stepmom and I made this and it was completley tasteless and if it did taste like anything it just tasted like flour. Defininatly not something we would make again sadly it did not hold up our expectations

I just made this and it is certainly interesting. I've never made anything with dates so wasn't sure what to expect but the flavor is quite good. I followed the recipe exactly (only cutting the sugar by half) but found the batter to be so thick i added more water and mayo just so it wasn't so bread dough-like. It didn't flow into the pan at all so I was really worried that it was going to be dense and dry. As it turns out it was more like a bread than cake which was fine since I'm a big fan of sweet breads. I did taste test the sauce before pouring it over the cake and really liked it as well; it tasted just like lemon meringue pie filling. Overall I am enjoying this "cake" it has a unique pleasant flavor that I'm hoping my picky eaters will like too.
