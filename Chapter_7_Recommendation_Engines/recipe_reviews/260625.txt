Made exactly as written using Panko breadcrumbs and these were perfect as written. Plan on 20 minutes for your airfryer to preheat and do not over fill your basket. The chicken pieces should not be touching each other if you want that crispness on all sides.

I have not tried this exact recipe, but I've done chicken in my air fryer for over a year, nuggets, strips, whole pieces, wings, with various coatings, sauces, and even plain. . 

I read this recipe in the special chicken issue earlier today, and noted the comment from a reviewer stating that you should preheat your air fryer for 20 minutes. I just received my copy of America's Test Kitchen "Air Fryer Perfection" and they tested whether  or not you should preheat your air fryer. One of the virtues of air fryers is that they come up to heat very rapidly, within a minute or two. 
ATK did not think preheating was necessary and neither do I. 
It wastes time and electricity. Turning and rotating the food halfway through cooking, or shaking the basket, will insure that
all sides are crispy.  Also, she was right about not overloading the basket.

This was delicious! I’ve never mixed panko with oil before, and I’ll never bread chicken any other way from now on. I used Italian-style panko and cut 3 chicken cutlets into strips for the hubby. I prefer chicken thighs, so I kept those whole (boneless). Breaded all of it using this method (had to double the breading mixture for that much), and cooked in batches for 15mins each (2 batches). No flipping needed, and it was crispy, crunchy goodness! Thanks for sharing!

Great!   Cut up 3 chicken breast into thin strips ,  Coated in mixture of seasoned garlic and herb bread and panko crumbs.  Added cayenne and garlic powder to crumbs.  Used 3 beaten eggs and didn't preheat airfryer. That was a mistake because it took longer for first batch.  I set at 370 degrees for approx. 12 minutes.  Served with homemade buffalo sauce.  My family loved them.  Great crispiness and flavor.

With a few tweaks this has became a staple weeknight meal in my house. I mix the egg with dijon mustard and spices and leave the chicken in it for 30 minutes to marinate. Then I dip and coat in the breadcrumbs.
The breadcrumbs mixed with the oil is something I had never done before but it is a game changer! Again I usually had a touch of seasoning to the breadcrumbs but overall this is a solid base recipe.

Perfect! First air fryer recipe used and it was a hit with me and my husband! For my personal preferences I added onion powder, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper. This time I will use a full cup of crumbs since I like the extra crunch. Thank you for sharing! (Not in recipe-but in every air fryer you should always flip your food at the halfway mark)

These turned out great!!!  I added a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch to the panko and it really made for a flavorful breading.

It was crispy and delicious!  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before breading it, and I also added a bit of salt and pepper to the bread crumbs.  I will definitely make this again!

Turned out crispy, brown and delicious. I seasoned the strips first with my personal Trinity (Lawry's,Onion Powder & Black Pepper) then coated them in my Progresso Garlic & Herb bread crumbs. Ummmm  good!!!!

This turned out great! I did a double batch, whisked in some honey mustard and pepper with the eggs, and used lemon flavoured olive oil with Panko crumbs. I did 3 tenders in the basket at a time for 10min on 180C after preheat, so it took a bit of time to cook them all. Will do again!

I decided this weekend would be a Chicken and Waffles Sunday.  I used this recipe for the chicken...it was extremely juicy and full of taste.  The only adaptations that I did was after patting dry, I dipped in flour before the egg to help the egg and bread crumbs to stick to the chicken.   I added a pinch of salt to the flour to help season!!! It was supper yummy!!!!

BLAH! I made it a super is, no changes to the recipe.  It looked crispy and amazing but tasted too bland and more like it was baked in the oven. Will try a different recipe next time

I used Italian bread crumbs and dipped the tenders in the egg mixture again and then into panko bread crumbs.   I added some salt but next time additional spices should be added.  Good recipe and crispy tenders!   Thanks for sharing.

7.1.18 I had concerns about the lack of seasoning in this recipe, so I did use Italian-flavored panko breadcrumbs and substituted part of the vegetable oil with sesame oil.  Ended up  still needing more seasoning, so in the future,  I’ll be adding more spices to the breadcrumb mixture.  Super quick and easy to make, and they cooked up beautifully.  I served these tenderloins with Summer Corn Salad and Quick And Easy Pierogies  both (recipes on this site) last night, but I think they’d be perfect for a good old chicken sandwich on a toasted butter bun…next time!

Whole family loved it. I didn't add anything and made it the way the recipe said. I did flip my chicken half way through so they were evenly browned.

I took tips from some others and used panko crumbs, to which I added some seasoned salt, garlic, and cayenne.  I cooked mine for closer to 15 minutes at 400 and they were delicious.

Excellent method that gave crispy, crunchy, tender chicken tenders.  I had a 1.3 pound package of 6 tenders and found that I needed about 1 cup of panko crumbs which I mixed with 2 Tbsp olive oil.  I also added some paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the crumbs before mixing in the oil.  Next time I'll try some cayenne, because we like hot chicken.  I cooked at 360 for about 22 minutes, flipping halfway through.  I served with a copycat sauce made of mayo, mustard, bbq sauce and honey.  My husband said they were as good as you get in a restaurant.

I made this several times already and loved it each and every time!  I initially made it as written...delicious, crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside!  I have since tried a variety of other versions by adding a splash of milk and a few squirts of brown mustard to the egg and letting it marinade overnight, adding onion and garlic powder, salt, pepper and paprika to the breadcrumbs (I always use Panko) and added 1/2 packet ranch salad dressing mix to the breadcrumbs.  Please note, I did not add all these ingredients at the same time but mixed and matched in order to try new flavors and every version was delicious!  What I especially liked about this recipe is the methodology using oil saturated breadcrumbs on the chicken.  This produced excellent results, imho, in the air fryer and as a previous reviewer stated, I’ll never bread chicken (or fish for that matter) any other way.   Can’t wait to try this recipe with cod, halibut, etc!  I wish I could give this recipe more stars!  ??

I followed the recipe exactly I even fried them longer.. I did 12 minutes on each side. They still had a “slimy” texture inside...so weird. Anyone else have this issue? Is there something I am missing?

I was looking for a healthier chicken parm recipe.  I came across this recipe.  I tripled the bread crumb and oil mix.  I used 6 thin sliced breasts.  Cooked two at a time.  Cut the time to 9 minutes.  Put in a baking dish topped with sauce and sliced mozzarella cheese.  Baked until warm and cheese melted.  Best chicken parm I’ve ever made.  No frying.  I wish I could give this 10 stars.

It was good and easy. I coated the chicken tenderloins in flour then egg and panko crumbs. Turned out perfect and juicy. I went for 15 min though cause it was pink still at 12 min.

Ended up doubling the recipe and adding a little bit of pepper to the egg along with some pickle brine for a change of pace. Added a pinch of kosher salt to the bread crumbs.

 As I was working I ran out of crumbs so it took another half cup. 

Kids loved it! Thumbs up across the board

Also, the first time I actually got to try out my instant pot air fryer oven, seemed to work great, though it took longer then expected with 2 pans

Delicious!  I made this tonight and my husband is raving about it.   The only difference is I used thighs so I cooked them a little longer.   I will be making this again.   Thanks for the recipe.

So easy and yummy!  I sliced 2 chicken breasts into 8 pieces. I would have used Panko crumbs, but didn't have any on hand, so I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I did add some seasoning to the egg (salt, pepper, & some Cajun seasoning), to give a bit of flavor.  I served with some roasted potatoes and "green fries."  Hubby dipped chicken in BBQ sauce, I used Comeback sauce.  I will make these again!

Turned out good.  I used garlic and herb breadcrumbs, and fried 8 of them in a single layer in the basket.  Preheating too about 2 minutes and they were cooked thorough in about 10.  I will be making these again but with Panko.

Excellent and easy!  I used chicken tenders, didn’t preheat the air fryer and didn’t flip the chicken. I just made sure the chicken wasn’t overlapping.  I’ll definitely be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent! We don't use oil  or butter that much, wife is on Keto Diet, but we like to substitute crumbled fried hot pork rinds as a breading - works on anything, more for flavor vs. crispness. Did the eggs in heavy cream  (better than milk) to coat the tenders then double-dipped into the breading. Top rack at 400 degrees 5 min./side. Perfectly done, moist & flavorful. Not a lot of crisp, (breadcrumbs or batter is better for this) but plenty of YUM.

I made this, with a few modifications.

I used chicken thighs instead of tenderloins, because that's what I had.

I added some spices to the dry bread crumbs.

YUM!

This is a very easy and great tasting recipe as it is and there is no need to add spices to the breading. I also use Sliced Chicken Breast and it turns out great.  One  could dip in their favorite dipping sauce, but can eat as is. Enjoy!

My husband and kids love these chicken tenders, and they taste just like the deep fried tenders, but they are a lot healthier. Highly recommend it!

I used Italian seasoned Panko breadcrumbs.  Still could have used a  little more seasoning but they were cooked perfectly.  Very crunchy on the outside and still moist on the inside.

I like the recipe.but added salt, pepper, and Parmesan to the crumbs and oil. I also had 3small chicken breasts and they came out crispy, as long as you shake them often.

Yummy!  I added garlic powder to Panko bread crumbs, and salted the chicken before putting it into the egg and bread crumbs.

Super easy to prepare.  Just needed to add seasonings to the bread crumb mix to make it extra flavorful.  350 for 12 minutes flipping at 6 minutes.  They came out crispy and Juicy.  Much better than the stuff the pass off as chicken at the fast food drive-thru.

I sliced up a chicken breast that had the bone in it.  Added some salt and pepper and used panko bread crumbs because it was all I had.  The recipe turned out great.  Very moist and tasty!

This is a go to air fryer chicken recipe for me. I've used it quite a few times. The reason I gave it four stars is that it's a little bland using regular bread crumbs.  Add Panko bread crumbs to the recipe and it's a 10!  I use Panko bread crumbs and add salt, pepper and italian seasoning to the crumbs.   On occasion, I've added parmesan cheese to the mix.  Love this !

I used boneless chicken thighs and added seasoning to the bread crumbs. First time I used my air dryer and it's a game changer! I woke up the day after thinking about that chicken.

Definitely a keeper. 

I modified a bit by adding shaved parmesan cheese in with the Panko Crumbs then seasoned the Panko with Lawry's salt, pepper, and garlic powder. The kids & parents really enjoyed this one.

I just got an air fryer for Christmas, so this was my first time using it.  I made the recipe according to the directions and it came out perfect.  Next time I may add a few seasonings to the bread crumbs just to jazz it up, but it is fine without it too.

I made this (Power Air Fryer elite). I followed the recipe exact (I used garlic and herb bread crumbs). My air fryer doesn’t require pre-heating, so done in 12 minutes. Cooked to perfection. My daughter gave it 2 thumbs up and a “really really good”.

This is fantastic...best air fry recipe I have tried.  I did use Smart Balance regular (not lite) in place of oil, and added some garlic salt and cayenne.  Nice crisp and not dry.

I cut the chicken breast into medallions and they turned out perfect, beautifully browned and delicious.

I used Olive Oil and flipped the chicken half way through.  We like a lot of seasoning at our house, so I added that also.  VERY GOOD and SO tender and moist!

Excellent method. I will add some spices to the bread crumbs next time, though. I cut the tenders in two pieces to be easier to handle by kids. I also turned them over half-way through the twelve minutes even though I think they would have been cooked well seeing that the basket is open. Thank you for the recipe.

Very easy and good. 
Tip: Turn pieces over half way through cooking.

I will make this again. I doubled the recipe and used my new air fryer oven with racks. I recommend using only two racks at a time, not three. The middle rack will cook faster. I pulled it out and added 5-8 mins for the other two racks. If you increase the recipe, you have to add time.  I also added breadcrumbs because 2 tbsp of oil was too much for 1/2c breadcrumbs.

This was the first entrée I made in my new Air Fryer.  It was delicious warm but after it cooled the coating fell off.

These chicken strips came out wonderfully crispy and delicious. I used Panko bread crumbs and added some Cajun spice. I did thank that 1/2 cup of bread crumbs was not enough for 8 tenderloins but that might have been because Panko bread crumbs don't go quite as far. I also felt like 2 tablespoons was a little more oil than necessary.  I'll probably adjust to 1 cup panko next time.

Doubled the recipe and added a pinch of Lawry's Seasoning Salt based on the other reviews. These were perfect! So fast and easy!

The chicken came out great.  I've never breaded anything by premixing oil with bread crumbs.  Sure made it easy  Next time I'm adding a bit of McCormicks Kicken Chicken to kick it up a notch !!
