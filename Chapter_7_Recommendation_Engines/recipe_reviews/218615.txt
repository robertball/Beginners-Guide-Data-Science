I have been making these for years.
They are a great side dish.
We even use parmesan cheese on them

Simple and delicious! This is perfect for those warm summer months when tomatoes from the garden are so abundant. It's not only vibrant in color but also in taste. I combine my olive oil and minced garlic together and drizzle that over top while the tomatoes are grilling. After they come off I sprinkle with a little salt and pepper then top with fresh basil. Sometimes I add either fresh mozzarella for a "grilled caprese" or shredded Parmesan although they're great plain. No matter what you do these taste wonderful and can be a great appetizer or side dish. The leftovers (if there are any) are great on thick, crusty bread!

I LOVE grilled tomatoes! I always throw them on the grill after the meat is almost done with the same temperature and method. I normally just do the olive oil and some kosher or regular salt. I will have to try adding some fresh garlic next time to see how that affects the taste. I am just a tad afraid of the fresh garlic burning. It really doesn't need it. Roma tomatoes tend to work the best, just cut in half. If you have never grilled a tomato you must try.

I had a couple of on the vine tomatoes that I used for this.  My result wasn’t all that great, but in fairness to the recipe, it could have been my tomatoes.  It’s nearly impossible to get a decent tomato in Ohio this time of year.  So, I’m giving this recipe the benefit of the doubt and giving it 5 stars.  I’ll try it again when garden tomatoes are available to see if this recipe really is 5 stars.

Very good, but we added a little parmesan after they were done. Also, the skins were a little tough. Maybe it was the tomatoes I used. They were from my mom's garden.
