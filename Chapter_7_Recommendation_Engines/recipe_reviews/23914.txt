The roast turned out so moist and delicious.  I added additional garlic and some rosemary.  Be carefull not to put the breading on the roast over the same pan you are roasting in.  The loose bread mixture falls in the pan and becomes very hard while cooking.  You don't want it in your gravy.  I had to pick these out before I made gravy so I will know better next time. Definitely make when you want to impress someone!

This was the most moist, delicious roast I've ever made, and I'll definitely be making it again!  I used a cross rib roast, Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, and grated Parmesan instead of the Romano, and it was delicious.  A quick gravy made from the pan drippings and some red wine went perfectly with the meat and the garlic mashed potatoes I served along with it.  Excellent recipe, thanks Cathy!

This recipe is tops!  I added a generous ampount of rosemary to the rub and used about 3 times the amount of garlic that the recipe called for.  My guests raved on and on about how tender and tasty the roast was and my two little picky eaters couldn't get enough.

Here's my experience with this recipe: I used a 6 LB bone-in rib roast and covered the entire roast with the butter mixture and bread mixture and baked it until the thermometer  registered 150 degrees.  The crust was great, but 150 degrees put the meat in medium-well range.  Overall, the meat came out juicy.  One thing I also like to share is the term for the meat: A Rib roast and Ribeye Roast are the same cut of meat except the Rib roast typically has bones and the Ribeye roast is boneless.

Very Good. It took me about 40 minutes longer than expected to have medium rare, but it was well worth the wait. It was PERFECT!!!!!

I used about 8-10 cloves of garlic, substituted  rosemary for parsley, and added an extra tbsp of olive oil.  It was FANTASTIC!!!! This is the first time I've ever made a rib roast and am most pleased. It was a pain judging the doneness of the meat but don't let it go past medium. All I can is this was really, really good. Enjoy it.

We just had this for dinner and my 3(almost 4) year old daughter had THREE servings, so it MUST be good.  I used a cross rib roast and it was excellent; so moist and flavorful.  Tasted like it had been marinated for hours! I like my beef semi-rare so I turned the oven off after about an hour and forty-five minutes, but left the roast in, and it turned out perfect!  Definitely a big hit in the house! Thanks...

This roast recipe was simply delicious.  I am not usually a big meat-eater, but I couldn't stop picking on it.  If you have any bread crumbs mixture left, don't throw it away.  Serve it on top of sliced roast, and you won't believe how good it tasts.

It was a good change from the normal roast.  This recipe can even make us guys look like we know what we're doing in the kitchen.  My kids loved this.  We used the progeresso garlic bread crumbs at it was just awesome.

I made this roast for Christmas, and it was excellent!  I followed the recipe but used (for a 4 pound roast) 3 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon good black pepper, pecorino romano cheese and only 1/2 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Also, took roast out of fridge for 2 hrs., so it went into the oven at room temp.  I cooked for 3 hrs., let it rest before eating.  It was slightly pink in the center.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!  I wasn't so sure about it when I saw it, but after reading so many rave reviews, I had to try it.  I'm SO glad I did!  My husband and I absolutely loved it!  The changes I made were that I used Italian bread crumbs, fresh parmesean cheese, I used the jarred minced garlic equaling about 8-10 cloves, and I added 1 cup of beef broth to the drippings to make more juice.  The drippings were mostly all fat, so after I let the mixture sit for a little while, I skimmed most of the fat off the top and it was delicious!  We still have some left over, but not nearly as much as I thought we would.  We just couldn't stop eating it!  Oh, and instead of just salt and pepper in the first step, I used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning (rather liberally.. and it was not spicy at all, just flavorful) and pepper.  After I took the first bite, I knew I would be making this again.  This was my first time making this type of roast.  Thanks so much for such a winning recipe!!

I used a standing rib roast for this and it was my first time cooking one, it was amazing!  Moist and cooked to perfection- and so different.  The trick with the standing roast is getting the breading to stay while taking off the bones.  That takes a steady hand.

My husband stated this was the best Rib Roast he's ever had!  We like our's med/rare so I took out after 1 1/2 hours and let it rest.  The flavor was excellent.  This will be the only way I fix Rib Roast.

I love the meat thermometer.  Without it, I'm just guessing.  And with a $60.00 piece of meat, I'd rather not guess.  130 degrees for medium rare; It was perfect.  The crust is truly an amazing creation, which I looked forward to when I reached the outside of the meat.  Oh heck, I'll admit it; I ate the crust that fell to the bottom of the roaster ... by itself.  It's *that* good.  This is the best prime rib recipe I've ever had, including one other recipe that I tried from the allrecipes website.

Since I have many more favorite beef  recipes than recipes for pork, I decided to give this a try with a Pork rib roast. It worked mightly fine. Give it a try with pork also.

Delicious!  My roasts are usually a bit dry, but this kept it so moist and gave the roast great flavour.  (A recently purchased meat thermometer really helped too!)  My husband loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!! Very good, i like it medium rare and it turned out more cooked than i would like even though i shut the oven off 15 mins early. Next time i will cook for only an hour and a half. But i must admit this recipe is GOOD!!! my boyfriend thinks its better than outback prime rib. It needs some au jus sauce though. (dont know how to make it so ill just grab some from arby's next time. Great recipe. thanks so much.

This roast was great! My husband said I outdid myself! Like Tom Z, another reviewer, I did have to leave the roast in the oven a little bit longer. But it still came out tender and delicious!

I made this for Christmas and it was a huge hit! It was very easy to make, I stuck a digital thermometer in (one that stays in while you cook, and the digital unit is outside the oven, you set the alarm to go off when the internal temperature reaches whatever temp you request), once the roast was in the oven, I just waited for the alarm to go off, pulled out the roast, let it rest (tented in foil) for about 20 minutes (we made Yorkshire pudding during this time) then sliced and ate. It was a fabulous meal that will be remembered by all for a long time.

This was amazing.  We had friends over and they just loved it.  They said I "out did myself"!  Wow.  I added double the garlic and used dried parsley at half the amount and added alittle dried rosemary.  Yum Yum.  Will make again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Excellent!  The roast we made was nice & juicy.  We added a bit more garlic which gave off a wonderful smell!

This recipe was awesome! I roasted a 11 lb. roast over 6 1/2 hrs. at 275 degrees and it just fell apart. I got rave reviews on Christmas Eve ! Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this recipe had good flavor but was not big on the way the texture of the breading came out.  It may be my fault.  I was cooking a cheap piece of chuck roast.  I also used a bit of dry parsley instead of fresh.

Really great dish.  Simple and so tasty.  I covered the roast with a little bit of foil so that I could cook the meat longer and have a very tender roast.  Worked out great.

I took a BIG chance and made this for the "new" in-laws at Christmas.  Since it was a first attempt I was nervous but it turned out to be a HUGE hit!  Everyone went crazy over it.  It was truly one of the best Christmas Dinners I've ever cooked.  Thank you!  Made a great impression on the new in-laws!!!!

I purchased a 4lb rib roast and the actual cooking time to "well done" was 3 1/2 hours at 325 degrees. The meal was good but be sure to use a meat thermometer.

This was so-o-o-o good!  There weren't any leftovers!  I didn't have any romano cheese, so I had to use swiss instead (and it was still great!), I can't wait to taste it with romano! Thanks Cathy for a recipe I will definitely use again!

I think the breading could have been more flavorful and salty.  It was very buttery tasting and it made the meat flavor stand out which I liked but if I were to make this again, I would use some more salt and herbs (maybe some basil and/or thyme) and definitely more spice (black pepper, etc.).  It also seemed to be a really thick crust that when sliced it crumbled off.  Great idea, but this recipe needs some tweaking before you serve it to guests!  My sister recommended adding some really good ranch dressing to the butter & oil mixture.

Christmas dinner - Made a nice roast, but I would not do it like that again.  I don't believe that the bread crumbs add anything to it, and I will go back to my regular garlic and herb seasonings to rub in well.

It smelled great when it was cooking, but I think it ended up drying out the roast. I'd do half of the breadcrumb mixture next time so that there is some juice left in the pan.

A perfect roast for two!  It's just my husband and myself, but it's hard to find a good recipe for a 4-5 pound roast.  This recipe yeilded me a perfect, juicy, delcious roast beef - the best I've ever made! The next day, I reduced the remaining beef on the bones into a rich broth, and added the leftover cubed beef to it to produce a marvelous Beef Pot Pie.  Fabulous!

Don't bother.  All the flavor(what little there is)wasin the bread crumbs. Wasn't unedible, but that is only because the meat itself was a decent piece to start with.
