This was sooooo good, I was very proud of being able to cook it until it was JUST done. I did change this up a bit though I added some vegetable oil to the sauce along with about 3 tbs of water because it didnt seem like enough (  I shortened the recipe to only accomodate 3 breasts). I also rubbed salt and pepper on the chicken first, and added crushed garlic to the sauce. The last few minutes I used the broiler to give it a slightly crispy top and I sprinkled some mozzerella cheese on top. VERY GOOD! Next time I think this would be good on top of pasta with sauce and maybe a little basil sprinkled on top would be good too. VERY GOOD, Highly reccomend recipe with my variations. Probably would have been a tad bland without garlic or cheese.

INCREDIBLE!  I made a couple of modifications as per other reviews.  I added 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 tsp salt, 2 tsp chicken bouillion granules, and 1 tsp basil.  I marinated the chicken in the mixture for 4 hours before baking.  Absolutely delicious, very flavourful!

I cut this recipe in half and used a 9x( pan - but otherwise followed it to the letter. I served it with rice and a onion/bell pepper mix and it was awesome.  Definitely keep the sauce to put on the rice.  Delish!!  

And easy, too.  I made the sauce and poured it on the chicken and put the whole thing in the fridge for a few hours so that all I had to do was pop it in the oven half hour before dinner.

This was very tasty! I marinated it for about 2 hours, then cooked it in the marinade. Toward the end of cooking I topped each breast with a mix of parm/mozz cheeses then broiled it until golden brown. Everyone loved it.

I always thought of myself as an oregano fan...until this dish.  I didn't see anything special about it.  It was rather bland...even served over rice with a touch more soy sauce.  Boyfriend and daughter gave this one thumbs up but there are sooo many other great chicken dishes out there that I think I'll just pass this one over.  Thanks anyways.

Good recipe. The chicken didn't require the whole 30 minutes to bake, so next time I'll only cook it for 20-25 minutes. I tossed bow tie pasta in the marinade after the chicken was finished & it turned out great!
Thanks!!

This was great,all I heard for the first five minutes of dinner was "WOW". I scaled it down to 3 servings, and served it with steamed rice and veggies. This had such a good flavor. Originally I was worried the chicken would be dry, since it wasn't marinated, but the chicken was juicy and tender. A real surprise!

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except doubled the sauce. It's not bland, like some reviewers have said, but probably b/c I doubled the sauce. Will make it again!

QUITE good.  This is the perfect weekday evening recipe for those of us who love to cook but are too tired for a big production in the kitchen after a long day at the office.  It was amazingly easy and had an excellent flavor.  This'll become one of our weekly standards.

This was fantastic! I doubled the sauce for the two huge pieces of bone-in chicken thigh I used, added half a chicken cube I had lying around, and a pinch of cayenne powder. Didn't really measure the herbs but definitely added more than was called for. Baked for 45 minutes, covered, basting once in between. The chicken was frozen when I started off.  Definitely not the most healthy of recipes, but the sauce is incredible, and so easy to make too!

I made this and it was awesome.  I did make some changes. No lemon juice or Worcester sauce.  I had some garlic pepper butter that I melted and mixed with olive oil as the butter solidifies.  I didn't measure anything either. Seasoned the breasts a little and added the mixture of lite soy sauce, oregano, oil butter. I made this on the pan. Sautee the chicken on some olive oil first putting it aside while cooked it all.  I added a sliced onion to the pan to get soft then added the chicken and some white wine, low heat and covered.  The drippings were sooo good!  Thanks.

Very tender. Too much lemon and Oregano. This marinade would probably taste better on Steak but it's still too much oregano. I served it over white rice and the taste is too strong. It doesn't taste bad but it could taste better.

Loved! It needed something, though. Maybe a dash of balsamic vinegar.

SUPER GOOD!!! my kids actually loved it and they can be picky. I did add a little  parmesean cheese into the mixture prior to cooking and I doubled the butter( hey, you cant have too much!). I served over rice and wished I had made a double batch. I had leftovers(very little) with some noodles and even that was good!! a keeper for sure.

This was really good, way better than I had expected.  I served it with rice like was suggested with the pan drippings and the whole family loved it, even the 3-year-old and the 18-month-old.  We will definitely make this again.

This was absolutely incredible! Made from ingredients I already had on hand - so convenient.  For something so simple to throw together, it makes a nice, rich sauce that my husband raved about. This will definitely be one of my "go to" dishes in the future~Yum!

Whole family loved it!  Will probably cut back on the lemon juice next time, as it was just a bit too strong.  Oregano flavor was not overpowering.  Served the chicken with rice and put the drippings over the rice. Delicious!

I followed recipe exactly, but I did not really care for the sourness from the amount of lemon juice combined with everything else. It overpowered the other flavors

I loved this chicken recipe! So many times chicken comes out dry and bland, but this had tons of flavor to it and was very moist! I wouldn't change a single thing in the recipe! Awesome!

I made this according to the recipe except that I marinated it for a few hours before cooking.  It was good, and my husband liked it.  I would have served it over some leftover white rice, but apparently my son ate that, so I served it with angelhair pasta.  We are used to lots of Asian, so the Oregano was a nice change without being too drastic.

My 9 year old said "Delicious and super yummy" and my 7 year old said "Awesome"!  I halved the amount of oregano and threw on a little adobo seasoning.  I cooked two large breasts and they turned out perfectly in 30 minutes but I have a convection oven.  I poured the juice over cooked orzo with a little additional olive oil, lemon juice and roasted green peppers.  Yummy!  Next time I'll marinate the chicken as others have said to make it more juicy.  Definite a family pleaser!

I agree too, the pictures don't look appetizing, but wait until you smell it! It smelled soooo good when I basted it and even coming out of the oven.

I did find it very tender and juicy as well as tangy/lemony though.  I'll read some more reviews to find out what others did to adjust the flavour.

Very easy - I poured the butter/oregano mixture over chicken leg quarters and baked for about 45 mins - transferred to another pan and crisped up for about 15 mins.

I guess this is one of those recipes that are just a matter of personal taste.  I really didn't care for the Worcestershire /Soy and combined spices.  My husband who usually loves anything with soy said this was "ok"   Too many other new flavor combo's for me to try to make this one again.

We make this often when we need a quick, easy meal. We usually pair it with rice and peas and never have leftovers! My entire family loves it!

Excellent!  Easily the best chicken I have made.  It was great over rice and with margarine substituted for the butter.

this was easy, delicious, and my family loved it.  next time, I'll make more sauce, though - there wasn't quite enough for both the meat and the egg noodles I made as an accompaniment, and we all wanted more of it.

Nice mild flavor, not an overwhelming taste when you need something just wholesome and good. I poured the sauce over half at a time and after 15 minutes turned it breast side down which kept it very moist. (last time I tried this it was a bit dry). I give it only 4 just because it's just a tad bland-- my husband especially prefers a little more zest to most meals; that said he adds hot sauce to everything anyway! Oh, and btw I used olive oil/sea salt butter which added a nice touch.
LAST but not least, I baked it for 45 minutes which was perfect; 30 minutes would not have been enough.

This was really good..I served it with garlic mashed potates, and carotts and broccoli.
Will definitly make again, and will make for company..may double the sauce though so that there is enough to put on top of chicken.

I made this recipe but use sage because I did not have oregano and dry lemonade kool aide in place of lemon juice which I also did not have.  I also added basil, vingear, ms dash and carribaen chicken season this turned out really good next time I will make it just like this receipe.  I also made this in my grille pan instead of the oven.  Thank you!

Yummy!  Quick, easy & very flavorful!  I was able to cut the cook time of the chicken down by 5 minutes and it was juicy and perfect!  Family loved it including my 4 year old who gave it a 5!

This recipe turned out really good...I also used crushed garlic instead of powder, and added some cheese to the top for the last 5 minutes of baking.  Delicious! I will make this again.

Very good for a quick chicken dish. I only had 2 boneless chicken breasts but made the mixture (amounts) as shown since I like a lot of flavor. Will definitely make this again!

Perfect for a busy night.  Prepared exactly as written, but would cook just a little less.  Served over steamed rice - sauce is great over chicken and rice.

This was a hit with my family! Easy to make and quite flavorful! I doubled the sauce and put a little over the rice as suggested...wonderful! Also...popped the chicken under the broiler for a few minutes after baking in the oven to brown it a little. Will make again.

I have been making this recipe for probably 40 years.  All of our children liked it when they were little and so do our grandchildren.  It is easy to prepare and turns out well every time.  I usually serve it with white rice and green peas.

I'll give it four stars.  Family liked it more than I did (3 stars for me)  It is a very easy, non-time consuming recipe.  I'd make again, but not too often.

Great flavor. I used half the butter and added in a little EVOO. I cut up some red potatoes and baked in the same dish with the chicken. Very good!

We liked this recipe.  It was fairly simple and the flavor was good.  I can always use another flavorful chicken recipe so it doesnt seem like we are eating the same old thing over and over again.  I followed this exactly but the cooking time was much longer for me.  I cooked the thighs for an hour (which I always do) and then bumped up the temperture to crisp the skin.  I will make this again and I also think it would be good on the grill.

This recipe is VERY easy and delicious. I serve it over brown rice or gnocchi, dripping the juices over the top. YUM!

Very good flavor! Only change I made was cooking it on the grill. The charcoal grill flavor was the perfect combo!

We just didn't care for the oregano flavor or smell.  It was so easy & we like all the other ingredients, so we'll try it again without the oregano.  Chicken was moist.

My boyfriend and I made this last night for dinner with a side of baked potato. We used four large chicken thighs instead of breasts (neither one of us is a fan of white meat), but followed the recipe for the sauce. Oh, we also seasoned the meat with salt and pepper beforehand to give it extra flavor. For the thick thighs, we had to bake them for 60 minutes, basting every 15 minutes. I'm not a huge fan of oregano, but the chicken came out very moist and tender, and the flavor wasn't bad.

This was so easy to prepare and tasted delicious!  I did use margarine in place of butter and fresh garlic.  It wasn't wild and crazy as someone else said, but for the flavor and ease of preparation, its 5 stars in my book!

My definition of an enjoyable dinner is partially influenced by the prep/cook time and partially by the taste/eating experience, and this recipe scores high for me in both these areas.  Served over egg noodles and a side of green beans.  Nothing too wild and crazy, as Steve Martin would say, but quick and tasty; it doesn't get much better.  A couple quick notes, first, like many chicken recipes, be careful about the cook times, apparently I have large breasts as my cook time was closer to (2) 20 min intervals.  Second, I agree with a reader's recommendation to broil for about 5 minutes prior to serving.  Lastly, even though I used low sodium soy sauce, it was still a little on the salty side, so next time, I plan on a halving the this ingredient.

This was an easy, excellent new chicken dish for my family.  I used 6 chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and halved all of the ingredients.  It turned out perfectly with just the right amount of flavor!

Loved the interesting combo of ingredients, a great sauce to drizzle over the cooked rice on the side. Next time I will definitely cut back on the lemon juice or omit all together & substitute pineapple juice instead. A little to lemony for my family & they are not picky eaters.

Good but nothing extra special.  As previous reviewer stated, there are many yummier chicken recipes on this website.  Also be sure & use a meat thermometer, mine took at least 45 minutes to be cooked, not 30.

The chicken was juicy and smelled wonderful cooking, but I thought it needed more seasonings (salt!).  Served over white rice with a side green beans. (Didn't reheat well either)

This is a good and quick dish. The flavors are nice without being overpowering. I would advise cooking only four chicken breasts with the amount of sauce given.  I will be making this again.

Another excellent recipe.  I served this chicken with the "Fresh Tomato Salad" and the "Creamy Penne Pasta" and my guests loved it.  It's easy to make and has great flavour.  I'll definitely make it again.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. The one thing I did change was instead of chicken Breast I used Boneless Chicken Thighs. I chose thighs because I never have any luck with Breasts they are always dry. The thighs did the trick just as moist as ever.

So delicious and easy, too!  I made the broth per recipe but I put quartered cob corn and onions around the chicken in the pan and I sprinkled extra oregano over all. We served ourselves in pasta bowls layering first with white rice, then chicken and veggies and lastly the broth. We will have this again, soon and I may even try it with cod fish instead of chix

This is a great recipe but in future I would be sure to have all your ingredients at room temp before you mix together or the butter solidifies. Delicious and easy my kids loved it.

Made it for dinner tonight and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe as written but did salt and pepper the breasts as other reviewers advised.  If you have the time to let the chicken marinate a bit, do so.  It made a lot of sauce which I served over farfalle pasta.  Served with steamed broccoli.  Thanks for posting this easy and delicious recipe.

This was surprisingly so easy to make, and so delicious! 

To the person who rated this 2 stars, I wonder what ingredients you used, and the quality of those ingredients. Maybe your ratios were off. I don't know, but good quality ingredients (such as real butter vs. margarine, or fresh lemon juice vs. bottled) and correct ratios can make a huge difference in the outcome of a recipe.

I used skinless chicken thighs because I find they don't  dry out like chicken breasts - my family raved over how yummy they were.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly as it is. - Thanks!

We loved it.  I will make this again.   Because we measure the amount of meat we eat, I cut the chicken breast into approx. 1 oz. pieces.  After initial 15 minutes of baking, I turned and basted each piece.  Baked an additional 7 minutes.  Served, with drippings, over red rice and steamed asparagus.  Husband suggested adding capers next time.  I'd serve this to company.

recipe was pretty decent, but once additions were made the chicken came out to our liking.. tasted on the "sweet" side attributed to too much worchestershire.. added the basil and pepper as some suggested.. but it needed something more.. ended up adding some cilantro and a bit of lime for that extra kick.. grilled it on the foreman as it's too warm for the oven.. used it in sandwiches.. ty for the starter recipe

A great recipe. I had everything on hand. A little less soy sauce than necessary but it still tasted great. EVERYONE loved it. My husband, 19 year old son, his 20 year old girlfriend and my 4 year old son (who HATES everything, practically!! - His favorite phrase is, "But that's not my favorite.")

I doubled the recipe and used 12 drumsticks. They were basically frozen so I defrosted for 30 minutes and stopped when it looked like they were actually cooking, rather. Cooked the partially frozen drunsticks for an hour, flipping half-way through. 

It was a win-win meal. Delicious for everyone and easy for me. I love those recipes.

This came out great! After making it a few times, I hit on a few adjustments that we like. First, I use margarine instead of butter, add 3 tablespoons instead of 2 of the Worcestershire, and in addition to the garlic powder I add a crushed clove of it. Comes out great!

4 Stars for flavor and ease.  The name is a bit misleading, as i thought that the lemon was also a very dominant flavor but not at all a negative.

My family loves this meal.  I double the sauce and marinade it for a couple hours before cooking.  I also added salt, pepper, and fresh garlic.

Easy, quick to prepare, and good flavors. Added 5 more minutes on the chicken, which made it a bit dry but seemed undercooked with just 30. I also threw in some veggies for the 2nd 15 minutes so they could absorb the flavors.

Very delicious meal!  Will make again in the future.  Next time, I'll have to take the advise of another review, and add some brown sugar.  That would have balanced the flavors a bit.  It was still very good (even without the sugar)

My whole family loved this!  I sliced my chicken breasts in half because I prefer them thinner.  They baked in 20 minutes instead, but I used the sauce as listed.  The chicken had excellent flavor, and the sauce tasted good drizzled over our couscous as well.  Very, very easy for good results.

This dish was so easy n delicious! :)  I followed the other suggestions and doubled the sauce, I used 6 chicken breasts an cut them up into pieces, added fresh garlic, n olive oil.  When the 1st 15min was up, I turned the chicken,  added chopped mushrooms n baby tomatoes.  In the last 5min, I added chunks of brie on top and served it over spinach fettuccini!  My husband and I LOVE IT!! Thanks u!

SCORE!  Husband approved and the flavor is just fantastic.  This is one of the best if not THE best chicken we have made.  VERY easy.  I used chicken thighs I had on-hand.  I will serve angel hair pasta with it next time.

I followed the recipe--but I marinated the chicken for about 4 hours before cooking.  Flavor was different--but good.  My pre-teen said he really liked it.  Chicken was very tender & flavorful.

Made this recipe last night.  Super duper!!   I have no luck at all with baked chicken so I slow cooked it in the skillet for the 30 mins.  Flipping often so the sauce didn't gel to the sides.  Came out wonderful.  Will definately cook this again.   ~~Mother tested, kid approved~~

I had lime juice instead of lemon juice, and I used pretty well the full recipe of sauce and half the chicken so it would stay really juicy. It was pretty tasty, but we liked it better the next day when we cut up the leftovers and tossed it with pasta and alfredo sauce. The lime juice gave it a nice zip!

Very excellent! The whole family enjoyed. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to make it in the skillet and scaled the recipe down to 3 servings. I also added salt and pepper. What I did was added the  sauce a little at a time to baste. The result was very moist and flavorful chicken.

I thought this was kind of boring-so I added a couple splashes of dry white wine and a couple of whole garlic cloves to the pan-it made a great sauce!

I really liked the flavor of this dish. I used leg/thigh portions so it had to bake for quite a bit longer than directed, but it was worth it. The sauce was great over mashed potatoes.

I've made this several times and it always comes out well. My children really like it.  The last time I made it, I used olive oil instead of butter and it was still good, but I'll add a bit of salt or other seasoning to make up for the difference in taste.

Just to say that my son asked for second and I have a very hard time getting him to eat good which this make it a very good meal.  I used leg quarters instead of chicken breast.  Besides the garlic powder I add real chopped garlic and cooked it on the stove instead of the oven.  Still came out very juicy and tender.  Served it with white rice and poured some of the left over seasoning on top of the rice, made a very good meal.  Family loved it.

This is one of my all-time favorite chicken recipes now.  I've made it in the oven and on the grill.  Before grilling it I marinate the chicken in the sauce for a few hours.  It is the most juicy and tender chicken I've ever grilled.  Extra sauce is nice to pour on the side dishes.  I use brown rice and snap peas.  I wanted to amend this to add that for some reason or another this makes terrible leftovers.  I only make as much as we'll eat right away because it never tastes good the next day.

Good quick and easy.  I used real garlic instead of garlic powder, and only used four chicken breasts.  Meat came out quite tender.

Very good recipe.  I didn't use soy sauce, instead used more Worcestershire sauce; also cut back on the amount of oregano.  I topped it off with marinara sauce and grated mozzerela.  Thank you for the recipe!

Works well when in a jam, I cut the oregano in half, and it was plenty. Not spectacular, but sure to get the job done.

This was a big hit with my very picky family. I substituted the butter with 1 12 tbsp olive oil and added a pinch of onion powder. I'll definitely be making this again.

I used my skillet for this recipe. I dumped in everything then added frozen chicken breasts on medium heat and cooked the rest of supper while that was simmering. I turned them a few times. These were moist and full of flavor. Great recipe!

YUM!!!! This was the first night in a long time we had NO LEFTOVERS!!! This recipe is so easy to make and I love the fact that I had all the ingredients on hand. The flavors mixed well and it was so easy too cook!!! It was in the oven cooking in less than 5 min!!! We had rice as the side dish and it was great! This is a nice quick recipe that I recommend! Thanks Christine for posting this keeper!

Easy and these are things I always have on hand.

My husband and kids were not as impressed as I was, but my husband is NOT a fan of boneless chicken breasts so I was not surprised by his ho-hum reaction.

The sauce didn't impart much flavor to the chicken, and the flavor it did impart was not great. Didn't taste oregano much. Worcestershire tends to dominate anything you put it in. Might have been better without it.

The entire family really liked this, and this came out much better than I had imagined it would. I had forgotten that I ran out of Worcestershire sauce, so I substituted Red Boat 40 fish sauce 1:1 and it was amazing! Next time I'll use the Worcestershire and compare.

So tasty and easy!!  Delicious over couscous. Next time I’ll try a good olive oil rather than butter. If you use butter, make it unsalted. Worcestershire  sauce and soy sauce  add enough salt.  Wonderful find!!

We made this last night and it was wonderful. The sauce just makes it. We also put some on our rice. I turned the oven down to 350 since it was cooking kind of fast and put it on the lower rack. I turned it after 30 minutes!  Yum!

For my kids to try a new food especially with soy and worcestershire sauce, one bite and they said "it's a keeper recipe mom".  Flavorful, and I didn't get to try it.  It was gone before I could get any.  Perfect over the rice.

I followed the recipe with the exception of fresh ground pepper. It was a bit bland but full of possibilities.  Next time I’ll increase the oregano to almost double,  increase the lemon juice by a tablespoon or so and add a touch of hot sauce by  1/4 teaspoon.    I’m going to do a quick marinate 10 min or so then before cooking flip the chicken over.

Serve with cauliflower rice to get an easy veggie in there

Yes I did make one change and that was because I forgot to purchase the  Worcestershire sauce.  Probably will think it Ridiculous but I Substituted Teriyaki sauce instead.  It tasted great.  Will make again with all the right ingredients.

I changed it up by using boneless chicken thighs. Simply because that’s what was on hand. Easy, quick, and very tasty. I didn’t have to baste like the recipe called for. They were actually swimming in the sauce. I served rice and veggies with it and used the sauce over the top. It was a hit with everyone.

This had a very good taste, but I did follow some suggestions and added basil, salt and pepper to the sauce, and marinaded the chicken beforehand. Also put a mozzarella/Parmesan mix on top and broiled for a few minutes.
I had to cook the chicken 25 minutes longer than the recipe called for, however, and wonder if my definition of chicken breast halves is different from other people's!!!  My husband kept offering to finish off on the grill and will probably cook it that way next time. I suggest - if anyone else has this experience - watch it carefully so it won't dry out. Mine was perfect, though. Will use again!

This is very good and very easy to make.  I added green beans to my sheet pan and they too were very good. I will make again.  Instead of rice I served with cauliflower rice.  Low cal but high in flavor.

This...chicken...was...delicious!! I made no changes to the recipe and followed the directions step-by-step. I was concerned about it being too salty because of the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, but it wasn't salty at all. It was easy to make and tasted fabulous! Will definitely be making this again and again, and again). Thank you for sharing, CSSTITCHES!

This is going to be one of our go-tos!  Used "fresh" dried oregano, shaking it off the dried plant for extra flavor.  I alsoI took the hint and marinated it for a bit and I think that probably enhanced the flavor as well.  Next time I may increase the Worcestershire sauce and decrease the Soy sauce as it was a bit salty for our taste.   But WOW, was it good -- and easy to make.

I liked it, but my husband didn't.  I made it with thighs because we don't like white meat, and baked it for an hour.  Sure made the skin think and crispy.

I was not impressed with this recipe. It was OK but will probably not make again.  Not great flavor but easy to put together. There are other recipes on this site that are better.

This was so good moist and good flavor. Everyone in the family loved it. Put olive oil salt and pepper on the chicken beforehand. Added some basil and cinnamon to the sauce. But other than that followed the recipe. My daughter Who’s not found of rice couldn’t get enough of the rice topped with the sauce. I will have to make this again.

My husband and I did not like the combination of flavors in this recipe.   I marinated the chicken in the sauce for a couple hours and then used fresh sauce to bake the chicken per the recipe.  I added sliced zucchini to the baking dish to cook with the chicken and served over buttered egg noodles.  I don't believe the zucchini changed the flavor.  We just did not like the mixture of  Worcestershire, Soy and lemon ... all strong flavors.  Maybe omitting one or two would allow the oregano to shine through, but I will just move on to another recipe instead.  This recipe is easy to make as stated though. 
 Thank you anyway.

Very good!  I increased the oregano by one teaspoon since that is my husband’s favorite spice. Didn’t have rice so put the chicken and sauce over quinoa. Delicious!  Chicken was done perfectly and stayed very moist. I will make this again!

I pair oregano with marjoram and thyme, generally, so I was already unsure, a little, about the soy sauce. Adding that to the flavour pairing seemed odd & that's what happened. But the Worcestershire sauce works really well & the lemon. So I added lemon thyme (very easy to grow here) instead of soy & ended with a different flavour matrix but it balanced better for us. But your recipe is a good start.

I made this one night and it turned out really great. Made some small changes however, to fit my taste of food. So I lightly coated the bottom of the baking dish with butter (can use napkin or parchment paper from stick butter) with the sauce I added about 2 tbls of honey heated it whilst melting the butter. Then I only used about half of 1/4 of the Worcestershire sauce and the same for the Soy Sauce and then added the oregano. I used chicken thighs instead of breast and I seasoned it with adobo, black pepper, and some parsley tossed it around poured a small amount of sauce mix in the bottom of pan placed the chicken in the pan the diced 2 potatoes and covered it in the mixture and Bon appetite!

Made this recipe exactly as it stated and I thought it was one of the worse things I’ve ever made. I didn’t think the flavor profiles went together anyway but I thought I’d give it a try as I have adventurous taste buds. Well it was terrible! Not sure why it has high ratings and I don’t think changing it even a little bit would help.

The recipe seemed rather simple, so I decided to make this dish for dinner.  I substituted poultry seasoning for the oregano and added a pinch of ginger.  It was absolutely delicious.  I'd definitely make this recipe again.

In reality it should be called "Lemon Oregon Chicken". Lemon chicken is not a favorite in our household.

My family loved this dish, including a few picky eaters.   The only changes I made were doubling the butter to dilute the flavor of the sauce a bit, and seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper.  Served it over rice with a mixture of veggies (zucchini,  red bell pepper, cauliflower,  sugar snap peas, and carrots).  I used my largest baking dish and was able to fit seven chicken breast halves.  I found that basting wasn't necessary, the chicken stayed nice and juicy.  We plan to try the same sauce with fish, with the lemony tang I think it would go well.

I am a picky chicken eater and usually favor skin-on chicken. This recipe was very good although visually, for me, it was lacking. The sauce from the pan added to the flavor & I served over Jasmine rice with oven roasted veggies. Very good.

This is easy to prepare, doesn't require anything exotic, and tastes delicious.  I think next time I'll put the juice on barley instead of rice, though.  Rice is not my favorite.

Made this for dinner and it was outstanding.  Very flavorful and the chicken came out so moist,  even being the breast meat.  Served this with some garlic and chicken flavored rice, and green peas, and crusty Italian bread.  Made the meal complete.

The only change was I used only two breast filets and not 6.  Maybe that was a problem because the chicken was very tough and stringy/chewy.  Flavor was pretty good but all the soy and Worchestershire sauce made it very salty.  Would not make again.

Excellent chicken recipe. If you like oregano this is for you, so delicious. I also sprinkled salt and pepper on the chicken first. After cooking 30 minutes I added some shredded mozzarella on top of the chicken and cooked another 5 minutes to let the cheese melt.

I made this recipe, almost as written, a couple of times now and I absolutely love it!  And it's so easy!!!  I make the same amount of sauce for only  3-4 pieces of chicken (vs 6 pcs) and use the rest of the sauce to drizzle over brown rice.  Absolutely delicious!  I thought it would be too much garlic powder, but not at all.  Flavors blend in beautifully.  And with the soy and werchestershire sauces, it just adds the right amount of saltiness which chicken and rice really need.  I was looking for a recipe that uses oregano since oregano has so many health benefits (antibiotic and anti-viral) and was very happy to have found this one!

I didn’t have any Worcestershire sauce so I substituted Sherry. It was delicious. Can’t wait to try it with the Worcestershire next time!

I doubled the  sauce to have extra for the pasta.  Doubling the lemon made it too sour so I mixed a can of cream of chicken soup to the sauce to tone it down.  I marinated the chicken for 2 hours and it turned out very moist.

In addition to the original recipe, I added the veggie oil, water, salt, pepper, minced garlic and basil....marinated the chicken over nite. The chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful. I served it with a side of mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli and zucchini. So yummy!!!

I already have made it a second time. The change is I make more sauce (or gravy) -- I actually doubled that part of the recipe because my husband liked it so well over rice.

Followed the recipe as written and found that the chicken was tasty but I think it  would have been even better if you marinated the meat  in the butter based sauce for a couple hours before cooking.  Also adding the left over sauce over the rice vegetable medley I had made was a wonderful addition to the meal.

I followed the recipe's amounts religiously, but the outcome was . . . blah.  Only a minimal hint of oregano, and far too lemony.

I'm giving this recipe a 3 because it was just OK.  The soy sauce and the Worcestershire  gave it an odd flavor.  I think next time, like some others, I will use oil instead.  I served over rice and had a nice salad on the side.

Made just as recipe was written and it was perfection! I thought it was very flavorful, and the chicken was juicy. Had my Greek son-in-law over for lunch and he loved it. Said the minute he walked in my door he felt cozy and "at home!" because it smelled so wonderful cooking. The soy sauce gave it just  the right amount of saltiness. Served over brown rice, but will try over pasta next time.  Loved it! Leftover chicken was great cubed and used on a salad. Will definitely make this again! Easy and delicious.

I wasn't sure if I did something wrong, but when the ingredients were mixed together, the marinade got lumpy.  Couldn't pour on the chicken.  So I spooned the clumps on the chicken, and the temp in the oven melted them back to the way they were supposed to be, I assume.  Regardless, in spite of the poor prep presentation, it tasted really good.  Very good flavor, using the recipe as is.  My wife even said she'd welcome this again.

I followed the recipe pretty close to how it was written, but used skin-on chicken thighs and just a bit less lemon juice.   Poured the seasoning liquid over the thighs in the glass baking dish (9 X 13) and let it sit in the frig for 2 hours, then cooked it at 350 degrees for just over an hour.  Took the rendered fat and made a roux with some flour and added the juices from the baking dish plus a little white wine and cream for a nice gravy.  We'll definitely be having this again.  It's a keeper.

Delicious! Hubby and Grand-kids loved it as well.  I used 3 of those really big chicken breasts, and 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning. I marinated the chicken overnight, then put it all in the crockpot. I did not add any extra liquid. Served over rice. My husband wants to try this as a grilling marinade. Came out perfect!

I did not use as much lemon juice because I used concentrate. We drained off the grease, and added corn starch to make a gravy and served over rice. We found that chicken thighs came out very tender. The kids LOVED it!

I was disappointed with this, although I shouldn't have been.  It is very acid, and of course Worcester sauce is all vinegar.  I put in just the slightest amount of brown sugar to calm it down and it was very nice.  I did prefer to put in minced garlic to powder.

With all the “marinade” ingredients, I was hopeful but I felt the soy and Worcestershire sauce took over. Did pour sauce over couscous but it felt “greasy”. Easy but would not prepare again.

My family loved this recipe. The only change I made was I added bacon slices to the bottom of the dish and placed the chicken breasts on top. The addition of the bacon made clean up a breeze and my family are huge bacon eaters, so they cleaned up. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I have mountains of fresh oregano in my herb garden, which is why I chose this recipe. I made this according to the recipe, except that I am not a measurer-type person, so I eyeballed the proportions. I used fresh oregano and fresh garlic rather than dried and powdered, respectively. I used bone-in skin-on chicken breasts, so I decreased the butter by half. I also ran them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp the skin. It came out very well, hubs liked it a lot. It was easy to make and a good choice for an evening meal. I had enough pan drippings, likely because of the rendered fat from the chicken skin. I did not add any other seasonings. Served this with oven roasted potatoes and broccoli.

Easy and delicious.  I used both breasts and thighs...I prefer it with thighs. Also, make extra sauce, you will want to cover your rice with it.  YUM!

I will certainly make this again! The sauce was terrific. The key to it was the amount of lemon; I had put in about half the amount called for and found the flavor too strong. Added the rest of the lemon and it was great. Also added a bit of S&P to the sauce. Next time I will pound the chicken to tenderize it and help the sauce reach the meat more evenly. Served it with white rice and sautéed zucchini on the side. Terrific!

This is SO GOOD, and very simple! It took no effort at all to put it together. I was afraid the flavor would be way too strong, but it was totally fine. I could easily see this going into my regular roster of easy weeknight meals!

I put salt & pepper on the chicken then marinated for 6 hours, cooked as directed and the chicken came out very good, nice buttery taste to it.

By far one of the best chicken recipes I've tried on here! I used "Italian seasoning" instead of oregano, and real garlic instead of powder, but it came out delicious! My boyfriend and I both loved it. There were no leftovers!

Meh. I used fresh crushed garlic instead of powder, but followed the recipe otherwise. Had a weird salty flavor, and the meat was chewy. No one in the family cared for it.

Great! I marinated chicken thighs for about 8 hrs before baking. I also added 1 tsp of basil. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I made ckn flavored rice along with broccoli. I thought it was really good. Kids ate it, so I'm happy!!

Just ok - I doubled the sauce, which was a good call (I poured over white rice), and the chicken stayed sort of moist.  Next time I would cook for less time, 25 mins or less.

So simple, and so tasty! I used crushed garlic instead of garlic powder, as well as freshly squeezed lemon juice.  Oh and I cooked it a bit longer because I used frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts.

made this last night.  Enjoyed by all.  I "dirtied" up the rice as it would have been a bland dish without and added mozzarella cheese to the chicken prior to serving. I will make it again.

This was awesome and super easy to make. I have made it twice and it is an easy chicken dish to make when you get done work.

My husband and I loved this recipe. He asked for seconds, which is a major sign he liked what I cooked. I will definitely be making this again.

THIS IS AWESOME! My whole family loves it. I have also given the recipe to my neighbors who love it too. I have also used this as a marinade for chicken that I grilled. Either way it is wonderful.

This was amazing.  So easy, quick and delicious.  I did not cook it as long as recommended as a previous post suggested.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good and easy to make. I follow the recipe, but don't cook it as long as it says. My oven is hot and it would be overcooked

I made this yesterday.  I thought it was one of the easiest and best tasting recipes I've tried in quite awhile.  I halved the recipe using only 3 breasts.  I hope that it will taste good today.  This will be a great one for company.

I haven't tasted this but my husband loved it.  I used real oregano and real garlic.  Next time I will double up on the sauce.

This was quick and easy always a plus in my book. It also tasted good. I used fresh oregano about a tbsp and the flavour wasn't too overpowering. Thanks.

Delicious!! I had to change it up a bit though. I used bone-in chicken breast instead. It is a preference of mine.

This recipe is delicious and is so simple!  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  You definitely have to like oregano but if you do you will make this recipe again and again.

I was very unimpressed by this recipe.  It's definitely lacking any flavor.  I won't be making it again.
