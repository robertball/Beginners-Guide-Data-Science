The almond crunch topping sets this cake apart from other pound cakes.  A bit dry and I would bake a few minutes less next time but could be how my oven runs.  Make sure you start the testing process a few minutes before the baking time.
A  good flavorful coffee cake  that I would make again.

This cake was so delicious! What could go wrong with butter and almond paste, two of my favorite ingredients! It's moist, buttery and melts in your mouth. The surgery topping is an added touch. I accidentally forgot to add the slivered almonds to the topping and didn't notice til the cake had been in the oven for several minutes- was still great! I used a slightly bigger springform and baked for 30 min- perfect! I used the.cake for strawberry shortcake, really takes the dessert up a few notches!

1.9.17   I don’t bake often, but this is something that I definitely will make again.  This is elegant and the kind of dessert I’d expect to be served at a very nice restaurant.  And the whipped cream and fresh raspberries are the perfect complement.   Not only a tasty dessert, but one with very nice presentation as well.  Thanks for sharing Valerie!
