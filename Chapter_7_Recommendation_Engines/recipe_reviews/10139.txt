The recipe/ingredients are very simple.  This was fun and easy to make.  I had no idea what they how they would turn out, but I like them a lot.  They're hard and crunchy, with the faintest sweetness in the background.  Apparently, you give them to babies when they're teething.  They taste like breadsticks to me.  Very yummy.  Good snack.
