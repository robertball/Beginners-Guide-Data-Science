When I told my Hubby we were having "Ground Beef & Cabbage" for dinner he looked at me like I was crazy. To our surprise, not only did HE like it, so did our very picky kids! I changed very little, which was to add Garlic to the cabbage mixture and used 2 cans of tomatoes as suggested by other users. I think if you were only to use a 1/2 head of cabbage, 1 can of tomatoes would be enough. Next time, I'm planning on making this w/ all the ingredients listed, garlic, 2 cans Italian diced tomatoes and 1/2 lb Italian Sausage. This is a super-easy, budget-friendly, hearty meal for your family and it tastes great to boot! Don't forget a pinch of red pepper flake & some TX toast on the side! Yum! Thanks for sharing!

Simple yet it offers the dynamic of "comfort" food without too much extra comfort if you know what I mean. Instead of italian seasoning I substituted one tsp of cumin and 1 tsp paprika for that extra kick, and I added fresh tomatoes towards the last 10 minutes of cooking. Also added worcestershire sauce to the meat instead of salt.  Eating it right now on top of a bed of rice (sometimes I need my carbs). Thanks for the awesome idea!

I loved this recipe! I was sort of leary about it initially but it will go into my rotation as one of my favs! Not only is it great for someone like me that is watching my weight and trying to eat healthy but it's delicious! My only regret is not making some cornbread to go along with it. I absolutely hate cooking but this recipe is so simple. I just threw all of the ingredients in a large pot, stirred it a few times and that's it.  

*I took someone else's suggestion and added a can of stewed tomatoes along with italian diced tomatoes. I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I added a touch of sugar and onion powder to add to the taste.

We ran late tonight and I needed something fast and filling but not heavy and that was not spaghetti (my husbands favorite). I ran across this and had everything on hand in one form or another. I only had a half a head of cabbage but with the one can of diced tomato s it was just right. I cooked the ground beef separate because it was ground chuck 19/81 so a bit more grease than I like in food. I sauteed the onion and garlic and a bit of diced bacon in a bit of olive oil before I added the cabbage, then after the cabbage added the tomato and cooked beef. I used basil, oregano, parsley, red pepper and paprika to taste. Cooked it all down, then added some diced zucchini at the end because I had it and it needed to be used. Put it all over rice. My husband added grated Parmesan because he does that to anything remotely Italian. And he says it is a keeper and to put it into rotation. Yeah! Cheap, easy and quick. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I came upon this while looking for something new to do with ground beef. I just happen to have some cabbage that I needed to use so I gave it a try.  After reading some of the comments, I did add cumin, paprika, minced garlic and 2 cans of diced tomatoes. One can was Italian basil herb seasoned.  I did use the suggestion to put it over rice.  It was delicious!  I do think that next time I will try adding a can of tomatoe sauce to give it more thickness to the juice, but the basic recipe is something I had never tried and the flavors of the cabbage, onions and ground beef together and one pot cooking makes it a winner and a keeper in my recipe book.

I couldn't bring myself to boil ground meat, so I sauteed the onions, garlic, and beef in a pan with the herbs; then added the cabbage and tomatoes, covered and cooked for 30 minutes. I served with polenta and sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

As written, this is a 3-star recipe. Okay, but not that special or flavorful. I added some Worcestershire, as others recommended, and also some rice wine vinegar and paprika, which gave it more flavor.

I thought it was pretty good. I added mushrooms,fresh tomatoes, parsley,garlic and crushed red pepperand I put over mashed potatoes.I don't recommend cooking this for 45 min it tends to dry out the meat unless you use 2 cans of diced tomatoes.

this was awesome!! I added extra can of tomoatoes, 1/2lb ground sausage, garlic, extra onion, chilli flakes, cumin, paprika and few other spices I had around.  My girl friend thought there should be water added, but that would've taken away from the flavour. I guess you could use some beef stock? She thought it was going to be more of a soup.  She didn't even want to eat it but I made her and she liked it.  You could even just cut up sausage and bacon and chuck it in, that'd be good! I cooked this at Low-Med and for about an hour.

I found this while looking for something to do with a cabbage and ground beef I had on hand and I can't believe how delicious this came out and yet so easy to put together and, all in one pot!  Thank you mtgrapham2!
Husband loved it and said "this is really tasty". My minor changes after reading the reviews: I had chuck beef so I browned and drained the meat, (but if I use sirloin I won't have to) and set the meat aside, saute the onion till translucent, add the chopped garlic and then the cabbage and stir fried all together for a few minutes.  I then  added the Italian seasonings PLUS a big pinch of red pepper flakes, AND a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce, and then poured in a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings (garlic/basil/oregano), AND a 8 oz can of tomato sauce PLUS a half teaspoon of sugar.  Stirred, covered and reduced heat to simmer for about 40 mins, turned off and left for 10 mins. I served with rice.  Perfect amount of juice and a crunchy vegetable.  This is SO delicious and filling too and great for a hearty dinner.  I can see how variations on this simple meal will use up what ever I have on hand also.  Was just as good next day.  Only criticism is this needed a better photo - I should have taken one but we ate it all ;)

Super love this recipe. I could not believe my super picky son love this dish. He doesn't like tomatoes and he is picky in eating vegetables. But he liked it so much that he ate a lot of it. He put it in a soft taco and roll. I have no tomatoes in can available so I used Ragu because I happen to have it. I also added garlic powder, cayenne pepper and chili powder because I have no Italian seasoning available.
My ground beef has more fats so I decided to brown and drain the fats.

This recipe is very easy to make, and very affordable and healthy meal.
I will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe, with my substitution of Johnsonville mild Italian sausage, rocked it!  Not only was it delish, but it was fast and SUPER EASY!!!  I did use two cans of diced tomatoes as others suggested. My kids rolled it up in a flour tortilla, but the hubs and I ate it from a bowl and knew the calories would be minimal without the carbs.  Will I make this again?  Absofreakinlutely!

Very good. I used ground turkey to cut down on calories (I'm doing Weight Watchers, so this works well!). One time I put in caraway seed. GOOD.

My husband and I both liked it very much.  I did add a second can of diced tomatoes and a bit of garlic salt.  We fixed it with the cornbread on the side as the original recipe suggested and it was great!  I can see all kinds of ways to vary it, but the original recipe is wonderful too!

First time making and I added a can of tomato sauce at the on set.  A table spoon of italian seasoning was too much.  Next time I will cut the italian seasoning down to half a teaspoon and replace with roasted garlic seasoning.  Additionally, I pre-cooked the ground beef.  Glad I did, I think it would have been too greasy otherwise.  I did add a dab of horseradish which gave it just that needed kick.  The spicy combined with the sweet of the cabbage was a good mix.

Excellent recipe with a few modifications. I added 1/2 cup of red wine,  an extra can of diced tomatoes, half to a cup of tomato sauce, 1 lb of mild  Italian ground pork,  Portabella mushrooms,  fresh parsley , garlic, 1/2 cup chicken stock,  soy sauce and  Worcestershire  to taste,  1/2 tsp or more of  Paprika and salt and pepper to taste. I cooked the ground beef and pork with the onions, mushrooms, spices, Soy sauce,  worcestershire and parsley.  I added it to the cabbage and other ingredients. I let it cook until the cabbage was tender. . I served it on top of corn casserole.  My very picky family loved it!   Thanks for posting this recipe!

I made this pretty much according to the recipe, but admit to adding a 2nd can of tomatoes and 4-5 cloves of minced garlic. I then served it on a bed of white rice.  It was excellent, or I think maybe "satisfying" is a better word to use. This is comfort food. It's not what I would call restaurant quality and it's not going to win any cook-off contests, but it's damned good! When I make it again, I'll add some red pepper flakes, a bit of cayenne or some Louisiana Hot Sauce for a little extra heat. Thanks Graham!

Oh, my goodness gracious. I was browsing stuffed cabbage recipes when I came across this. It fit the bill for simple and wholesome, and we were so pleased. The only change I made was using ground moose, since we don't eat hamburger. It was terrific over rice and left over on noodles. Will most assuredly make this again.

I'm a fan of cabbage which most seem to not like. However, I was NOT a fan of this recipe. Very bland and tasteless. Even with additional seasoning, I still did not care for it.  The ground beef did nothing for the recipe.  I'll stick to my link sausage, red potatoes, and cabbage recipe (with seasoning of course).

Super pleased with how this came out! I added a touch of water in the beginning because I did not think there was enough liquid to simmer. I was wrong!  Once covered the condensation, juices and sweat from the vegetables is just enough liquid to do the job. Only thing I added to this recipe was garlic salt. I also uncovered the last 20mins to reduce. Excellent receipe. Super flavorful and filling. 100% will make again.

I'm sorry maybe its just me but I made this exactly as is with no changes and I thought it was very bland.  Maybe you have to grow up with it?  After tasting it halfway though cooking I frantically started reading the other reviews I doubled the Italian seasoning added 2 tbs worchestershire sauce a can of tomato sauce 1 tsp garlic powder, salt and some ketchup oh an I think a tbs sugar.  It saved the recipe for us at least.  My husband put shredded cheese on top and said it tasted kind of like the stuffed peppers except with cabbage instead of green pepper.  Anyway he's a saint and will eat almost anything with cheese on it.  So I guess we did change it because I don't want to throw away food but my rating is for the original recipe exactly as written.  Personally I don't really like it that much better even with all my changes I think there are better things that could be made from these ingredients.  But hey could just be me.

Instead of going to the store, I saw I had ground beef, cabbage and tomatoes to make a dinner.  I found this recipe and it was delicious.  I only made adjustments as I only had a 1/2 lb of hamburger and 2 1/2 lb each of mild/hot Italian. I did use the spices suggested but included garlic and Italian tomatoes as that was all I had.  Using 1 1/2 pounds of meat I used all of the leftover cabbage I had and a large can of tomatoes.  I would not have altered the recipe but that was I had on hand.  The huge pan whittled down to me with very little leftovers.  Even as I put the container in the fridge I managed to scoop 3 more bites.  For those who rated only 3 stars, you should be ashamed at the fact that you do not taste your product as your cooking.  This way if something is bland you can adjust the taste with spices.  This will be a standard at our house.  It’s perfect for my diet, filling and my guys ate 2 bowls each!!!

With so little ingredients I thought it would be bland but I was wrong. I changed it around a little by cooking the meat with the onions first then added the cabbage, tomatoes, and spices. I also added 1/2 can of tomato sauce because there wasn't enough liquid in the diced tomatoes. My husband loved it and I will be making it again.

I made this but instead of onions, which I do not like, I used dried minced onions and also added garlic. I also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and cooked the hamburger meat until it was half done, then added to cabbage mixture.  It was delicious and will definitely make it again!

Love this recipe! Simple and delicious! I took advice of others and added a 2nd can of tomatoes (this time stewed), garlic powder and cumin. I also made cornbread to serve with it. I also added a can of red kidney beans, because I like beans!

Great recipe! I did add 1 extra can tomatoes , 3 Tbs minced garlic and 2 bullion cubes and a little extra Italian seasoning. The original recipe is great but can be tweaked any number of ways according to preferences.

I went about this just a bit differently, I replaced the ground beef with Johnsonville fresh hot Italian sausage, which I removed from the casing.  I browned the sausage and onion then added the Italian seasoning, 3 minced cloves of garlic, and my coarsely chopped cabbage. I cooked and stirred until the cabbage wilted then added the tomatoes and continued to cook until the tomatoes were heated through.  I served this on a bed of wide egg noodles with a green salad and homemade biscuits.  We like it, but the leftovers, which we had for lunch were really good.  I believe the next time I will make it far enough in advance so I can refrigerate it to meld the flavors.  Mr. Graham, I hope you like the liberties I took with your recipe.

Ok, I messed with the recipe a bit but this was AWESOME! We were not expecting such deliciousness from such a simple dish. I had two italian sausages along with the ground beef so I threw those in and halved the amount of Italian seasoning. I only had half a jar of tomato sauce so I filled it almost all the rest of the way up with water, poured it all in and added two diced fresh tomatoes. I also added fresh garlic and garlic powder, and a splash of red wine. SO GOOD!

I had some leftover cabbage in my fridge and this was the perfect use for it. Not quite enough "sauce/moisture" I think I would cut back on my cabbage just a little, or maybe add a bit more chopped tomatoes. Will make again

Husband liked it.  :D  
He's a hard sell for a 5 star.
I liked it too.
added szechuan pepper flakes, because he's a spice hound.
for individual servings, you can add a drizzle of heavy cream to give it a lovely creamy texture and a richer flavor.
I used my own home made marrow bone broth to make it too.

I really thought this turned out pretty good...I added more garlic and spices, but it just was not a big hit at my house.  I could tell because no one wanted seconds.  I have to agree it was even better the next day, but I couldn't get anyone else to share it with me.

Quick meal, I was interested in making because the ingredients reminded me of stuffed cabbage rolls, minus the rice, good for carb watchers.
I added a couple of slices of fully cooked bacon chopped in with my ground beef. I also did not add Italian seasonings, I felt that would take away from the flavor I was looking for. My can of chopped tomatoes had a hint of basil garlic and oregano. very tasty.

I always love a good cabbage recipe.  The only change I made was using only 1/2 a large cabbage head and I added additional spices (Thyme, Sage, Rosemary, Garlic) which is just a personal preference, but I like the overall taste.  I will be using this recipe frequently.

I liked this, but will definitely edit before next go round. I didn't follow my cooking instincts and I didn't saute the onions, then add the ground meat and saute them together. If I make again the order will be onions (w/cooking oil), add meat, add tomatoes, add cabbage (and spices). The non sauted flavor of the beef was just not doing it for me. I also added a second can of tomatoes.

This is a great recipe: hearty, flavorful, healthy, and so simple. I am very happy to have this recipe to mix in with other dinner recipes. Garlic bread goes well on the side.

I have made a similar dish to this many times,  but I leave out the Italian dressing and put in a couple tablespoons of soy sauce and a couple cloves of minced garlic. It's all served on top of white rice! Delicious!

Delicious. Used 2 cans diced tomatoes and whole head of cabbage. Next time would add sautéed garlic and maybe some peppers if I had them in fridge. My two sons, tween and teen, and my hubby and I loved every bite.

This is such an easy recipe & very good. I used 2 c freeze-dried savoy cabbage, 1 c freeze-dried vegetable stew mix, 1-lb ground beef,  8-oz broth, 3/4 c water, 2 cans diced tomatoes, the Italian seasoning & salt to taste. I put it all in the Instant Pot & cooked it on high pressure for 10 min with a natural release. Everything cooked perfectly & I loved it. I will be making it regularly.

I always read reviews before using a new recipe.  It is very helpful until people start completely changing things.  Just post your own recipe.
That being said, I read the recipe wrong and used 2 cans of rotel tomatoes and green chilies.   It turned out amazing. Family loved it.

My husband loves this. I serve it over white rice.  I've made it  twice since I found the recipe.   The first time I followed the recipe and the second time I changed it.    I used canned tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes.    It is good any way you fix it and is good as a leftover.

This is a good basic recipe and when you don't have a whole lot of dollars left over for the month, a very inexpensive meal as well.  I made this exactly as written with the exception of a little worcestershire sauce.  I would make a few changes for the next time--keep the worcestershire sauce, add potatoes and an extra can of tomatoes.  This is such an easy recipe to personalize and it was actually better after a couple of days, too.

This is a great meal my family likes cabbage so this is a nice change it’s hard to find good recipes for cabbage. I like to serve it with mashed potatoes and I just added extra crushed tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce it was nice and so delicious.

I added the extra can of tomatoes and pinch of red pepper. It still needs something more. Next time I’ll add a pound of Italian sausage and a tablespoon of Worcester sauce. Good flavor but needs more spice.

Quick and easy to put together.  I agree that you do need 2 cans of the diced tomatoes. Very filling, so even for a family of 4, I would definitely half the recipe next time (and therefore, only one can of tomatoes).

I doubled the tomatoes. I thought it was great with rice. My grandson didn’t like the smell of cooking cabbage and refused to eat it.

It was good and my husband certainly liked it - he made sure all of it was eaten.  NOTE: I used only half a head of cabbage and added a can of Rotel Tomatoes

Very simple, flavorful and satisfying. Plus you can make it in one pot without having to transfer anything which is awesome. My teenage son said it would have been better with potatoes added but I am trying to keep as low carb as possible. But I suppose adding potatoes every once in awhile would be a great addition.

This recipe was simply DELISH! I have now made it twice in the past few days and passed the recipe on to other family members. So easy to have the taste of yummy cabbage rolls without all the fuss. 

I took the liberty of adding my own twist with the seasonings: Garlic powder, onion powder (had no onions), oregano and basil (all to taste). I also added a tablespoon of sugar in the last 10 minutes or so.  I also squeezed some A1 on the ground beef while cooking to add a deeper flavor to the meat. (cooked it first)

I love this recipe! I will be making it quite often. Thank you. :)

I used ground pork, with everything else the same (including directions) and to be honest it made me nervous cooking it this way (using raw ground meat).  It made sense to me, but I've never done it.  I always brown meat first.  It was delicious, though.

I would really give this an extra half star if I could. I actually did have it with an ear of corn, and a hunk of corn bread would have been perfect. I think that it needs an extra can of tomatoes. The 1 can of D#l M@nte had almost no juice and was lost in the mass of cabbage. If you're used to hot curries, Thai or Mexican food you may be disappointed, but for  a good, basic middle America comfort food this is perfect. I did, however, end up adding equal amounts of vinegar and brown sugar as I like my beef and cabbage sweet and sour and that brought it up to a solid 4 stars for me.

I've made it 2 times.  The first time I followed the directions exactly.  The 2nd time, I added another can of tomatoes and a little more ground beef.  It is a really good recipe and yields a big pot of food.  I freeze the leftovers, wrap it up in a egg roll wrapper and make egg rolls.  Very good!

Made for supper tonight. First I put it in the slow cooker at noon, I added two cloves of garlic diced, 1/3 cup red and green peppers. I will probably make this again. We like to eat one pot suppers.

I made it and added an extra can of diced tomatoes, used 1 bag of shredded cabbage, some cayenne pepper and a can of diced chilis. The original recipe is a bit bland for us but with the added cayenne pepper and chilies it is delicious.  Served it with tortillas and a bag of mixed steamed veggies.  I suck at cooking cabbage, but this one was amazing and a keeper. Will do it again. Hubby wants me to try it with  sauerkraut  and put it in a casserole pan and bake it.... We shall see...

It's a great start, and no disrespect to your mother!!! I added bacon and some bacon grease, spaghetti sauce in addition to fresh chopped garden tomatoes (I didn't have any canned tomatoes at all), grated Parmesan-Romano, chopped garlic, and extra Italian seasoning. Served over rice, this was amazing!!!

I made this for the first time tonight. My family agreed that this recipe has potential but felt it was a little plain as written. The next time, we'll try to punch it up to our tastes with garlic, more oregano, black pepper, paprika, and add some bell peppers as well.

This recipe is easy and delicious. The only change I made was to add half a jar of pasta sauce to the mix. It turned out great. I was a little nervous about adding the raw ground beef to the mix, but it turned out great.

This recipe is super easy and versatile. I have made it with Italian herbs and it's like a meaty spaghetti without the pasta. Also have made this with Mexican herbs and spices and added black beans. So good! Also great made as is. I buy shredded cabbage or cole slaw mix in a bag and use it instead of chopping the cabbage.

I just made this and added a little of my own ingredients in it. I used a can of stewed tomatoes and a can of the Rotelle mild. I only had purple onion on hand so I cut it up really thin and didn't use much then also added some organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil and some garlic powder. Wow. It's good!

I too live in the same region of the country as the lady who posted this recipe and I grew up on good ole country cooked as well.  I've been making this for about 60 yrs. but I use canned diced tomatoes, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste.  This recipe is also good with sliced polish sausage added to the beef, diced potatoes, diced celery, diced bell pepper and sliced carrots as well.  I always brown my ground beef along with my onion, garlic (either powdered or fresh) diced  bell pepper and diced celery, drain then add the other ingredients.  Oh yeah I always use two cans of diced tomatoes and don't use tomato sauce.  just salt and pepper to taste.  For those who want a little more kick to their meal just add either red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper to taste.  Great base recipe letting you add what veggies your family likes best and you can tone it up for adults or tone it down for kids if you like.  Hardy stick to your ribs meal that's so versatile.  Its even good with shredded cabbage added in or some diced zuchinni added in as well as drained canned corn.   You literally can't screw this recipe up if you tried.  Just let your imagination and taste buds guide you.

I made it with some ground pork sausage I had and doubled the Italian seasoning, since others had said it was bland. It turned out pretty good and even my kids liked it.

Only things different I did was to add chopped fresh garlic, sauteed with cabbage for a bit.  I cut the amount of cabbage in half because half of the head I had was a LOT!  And , like other said, added more tomatoes.  1 -14 oz can is definitely not enough!  Will be making again.  I just served with egg noodles.  I will likely add other veggies when I make in the future, like zucchini.

Loved this dish.  I used brown rice as a side and it was very good.  Not only that but it made enough for a party of 2 to enjoy stuffed bell peppers that I got to use remaining rice and beef/cabbage mixture for the same evening. What worked so well is that I baked the peppers the same evening, froze them and am still enjoying them a week later.  For faster microwave cooking, cut your stuffed peppers in half and they will thaw/cook even quicker.

The simplicity of this dish makes it a win for me.   It's super easy to make and throw together.  Normally I'm all about adding extra spices but I don't think this dish really needs it.  The savory flavor of the cabbage alone makes it a win.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! The only adjustment I made was more Italian seasoning and salt. I love it over rice and my boyfriend likes it with cornbread muffins. Thanks so much!

I made this as directed and tested it prior to adjusting the recipe in order to give an accurate review. It tasted pretty good, just a tad tart from the diced tomatoes and if I was served it like directed, I still would have happily eaten it. I did adjust it after tasting it to add a sprinkle of sugar as suggested by another review and it fixed the slight tartness. My daughter who is pretty picky liked it too, she stated the meal tasted like spaghetti. (A little parent trick- I told her the cabbage were veggie noodles) The  jasmine rice went great on the side.

I made this and doubled the tomatoes as one reviewer suggested. I also cut the ground beef down to 3/4 of a pound. We enjoyed it very much.  Since there are only two of us I'm looking forward to LOs tomorrow!

It was delicious!  I added 1/2 cup short grain brown rice and some water and bay leaves and baked it in the oven at 275° for 2 hours.  It's difficult not to tinker with a recipe, even the first time.  The rice added a sweet nutty flavor.  Next time I will try some of the spices suggested in the other comments.

This is delicious!  My mom used to make this years ago and called it Goulash, but she lost the recipe.  The only change is that instead of ground beef, she made it with meatballs.  To make this dish super easy, you could make it with frozen meatballs.  So glad I saw this recipe!  Allrecipes is the best!

Thought it was too bland as written. After reading the reviews, and tasting along the way, I felt it was necessary to add a tsp. of Worcestershire sauce, 1 can of tomato soup, 1 Tablespoon each of brown sugar and cider vinegar, and a cup of instant rice. Kids still managed to pick out every piece of cabbage.

Ever since I made this a few months ago, it's been my go-to meal.  It's easy, cheap and delicious. You can add a lot of spices (which I do) or leave it a bit more bland.  I would highly recommend this dish.

I was a little doubtful about adding the raw beef right into the stewing veggies--thought it might get tough. But the result was fabulous!

I did three things slightly differently: 

melted some butter (3-4 tablespoons) in the pot before adding the veggies

added some bite-size chunks of white and purple potatoes (they didn't quite cook through, so at the end, I took them out of the casserole, roasted for 20 minutes at 400, and then added back in)

and, in addition to the can of tomatoes, I added one jar of Classico spicy red pepper marinara

Just delicious!

I am always looking for recipes that call for the most basic ingredients that you usually have in the frig and pantry!  Ground beef can be boring but I had all these ingredients so thought...let's try it.  It does not get cold in FL very often but it is this week so sounded like great comfort food. Wow, YES this is!  I salted and peppered the ground beef, added a shake of oregano and cooked it separately.  While it was browning, sweated the onions then added a glove of pressed garlic.  Then added a can of Rotel tomatoes and a can of Italian style diced tomatoes.  Also added about a table spoon of sugar, a good couple shakes of the Worcestershire bottle, the sliced cabbage.  Then added the cooked ground beef, including the small about of grease it omitted, for extra flavor). Simmered for about 20 mins until the cabbage was tender but still had a tiny bit of texture to it.  Now everyone knows that dishes having tomatoes and hamburger always tastes better after sitting together for a while (especially over night) so put into frig for remainder of the afternoon.  Warmed it up and  served over white rice. It was so delicious!!

If you like cabbage rolls you will LOVE this, especially if you have to cook it!  Way easier than cabbage rolls, and better tasting as far as I am concerned. I did make one change, using hot sausage mixed in with the ground beef, 50/50 mix, and it flavors it so much better than just plain ground beef.  My grown sons who have NEVER eaten cabbage, devour this every time I make it. I usually make a side of mashed potatoes with it. You will get addicted

This was pretty terrible and I made all the changes that people talked about like adding paprika, garlic, etc.  My kids could barely eat it.

I was looking for a low carb recipe with the ingredients beef and cabbage when this recipe came up.  When I told my husband what I was making he turned his nose up at it.  Well that was until he came into the house and the aroma filled the air.  He ate 2 bowls and loved it.  I did make mine a little different.  I browned the ground meat (don't drain), sautéed the onion and garlic in with the meat, salt, red pepper and black pepper to taste. Added 1 can of crushed tomatoes, 1 can of diced tomatoes, Italian Seasoning and then 1/2 head of shredded cabbage.  I then cooked for about 30 minutes stirring occasionally until the cabbage was tender.  It was delicious not to mention very CARB FRIENDLY!

Very easy to make and tasty.  I used a whole head of cabbage, THREE cans of diced tomatoes (fire roasted, italian, and stewed...that's what happened to be in the cupboard).  Added garlic, shallots, paprika, cumin, and fennel seeds, along with the italian seasoning.  I also through in some zucchini I had laying in the drawer.  I used 1 1/2 lbs of lean ground pork instead of beef. Also added Worcestershire.

Made this for the 2nd time tonight. We love it. Great base recipe. Doubled it by adding 2 lbs of ground beef (which I browned with the onion &  some minced garlic) & 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes. Also added 1 tsp. red pepper flakes, garlic powder & 2 tsp. beef bullion. I always have rice available. Some of us put it over rice, some don't.  Great with a big loaf of Italian bread on the side. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum yum yum!!! This is so easy to make that it's become a regular in my house for evenings when I'm feeling lazy. I like adding black beans and corn to it.  I use spicy diced tomato sauce to give it a little kick. Thanks for sharing.

Very good, I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't have enough ground beef so added a can of beans and I like things spicer than most recipes so added garlic and cayenne pepper, and only used half a cabbage. Served over rice with cornbread.

So simple and so good. My husband kept telling me how much he liked it.  I love it because it is healthy and low carb.  I made it with ground Turkey and I added 1 cup of cooked Brown rice which made it taste like a cabbage roll.  I agree with a few other comments that adding more tomatoes is a good idea, I used tomatoes from my garden that I processed in my blender rather than canned.

I have done this before. I called it inside out pigs in a blanket. We were looking for a new way to make it other than stuffing cabbage with the hamburger, rice onions and bell pepper. I was tired from a long day so I chopped everything up and threw it in the pot. It was delicious and my son said "look mom it is inside out, hence the name. It was so easy the kids were able to help make it.

I love the simplicity of this recipe, using what most of us have on hand. It tastes like a dish my grandma used to make back int he 60s. I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting mild Italian sausage for the beef, which was wonderful. I think the seasonings in the sausage really added something to the taste. Great recipe-thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe! I needed a quick and different recipe for dinner because I didn't plan ahead and this worked out perfectly. I followed the recipe except left out the onion because my husband doesn't like it.  It actually took about 45 minutes from beginning to end which is also a big plus. Definitely making this dish on a regular basis!

I found this very homey. I treated this recipe as a deconstructed cabbage roll. I took out the Italian seasoning and added a small can of tomato paste. Just add water, salt, and some cracked pepper. So much more simple than rolling the filling in the cabbage leaf. I did make this in the crock pot too. On low for 3 hours. Came out great. Served over some mashed potatoes.

Ground Beef & Cabbage Haiku: "Needed some more oomph. The seasoning was lacking. But still a good dish." Did this recipe as written other than not chopping my cabbage too finely, along w/ adding a clove of garlic, but still felt that it could've used more spices. I think I prefer the AR recipes that are similar but have kielbasa instead of ground beef, or where the cabbage is sauteed in bacon grease simply for the dynamite flavor that they impart onto cabbage, but I'm still glad that I tried this.

When I saw the ingredients to this recipe, I had to try it.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  We both thought it needed "something" to add to the flavor.  Maybe sausage or smoked sausage.  Not sure. Even though there seemed to be something lacking, we both want to have it again.  I may try the sausage next time.  Maybe 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 sausage. I did cheat and brown the meat partially before adding so that I could control the amount of grease going into it. I also took the advice of those before me and added a can of stewed tomatoes.

I used sliced Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage in place of ground beef for this recipe and was VERY impressed with the results! The flavors were amazing! (Gently fold instead of stir to keep the sausage slices intact.)
I had just gotten back from a vacation in a small Bavarian town in Washington State and this recipe brought me right back! AND it was super simple to make! I served it with organic brown rice and topped it with some chives. The whole family, including the two year old, loved it! We will be making it again!

I'm at month's end (I get paid once a month and there usually isn't a lot of $$ left by the last week of the month) and this was nice and inexpensive--and very tasty!  I prepared it just as directed.  And I have leftovers for lunch/dinner for the next few days too!

I love stuffed cabbage rolls and thought this might be good, from a taste point of view as well as low-carb.  Figured I couldn't go wrong when so many others rated it highly. Used 2 cans of tomatoes, added mushrooms and did it in the crockpot.  Ate one spoonful, grabbed more spice and sour cream to make it somewhat palatable.

I made it in my crockpot. Added can of tomato sauce to have more liquid. I fried the onions, garlic and meat first and then added it to crockpot with the rest of the ingredients. Just good hearty winter meal. I prefer meat in cabbage but who has time to decore cabbage and cook the leaves, roll etc...:-) This tastes same but is easier.

Very good! However, I brown the meat some and instead of the Italian seasoning, I added garlic powder.

This was great! I used a little less cabbage and one can of tomatoes was plenty. I seasoned to taste with Italian seasoning and also added a little cilantro and parsley and garlic.

This was great, and budget friendly too.  This was awesome paired with rice. I could eat it by itself. Next time I might add a bell pepper.

I try to cook recipes as is if I am going to make comments.  However, I did not have plain tomatoes so had to substitute with a can of mild rotel.  Glad I did as even with the jolt the rotel gave, it was a little on the bland side.  But certainly tasty enough, easy and affordable.  I'm thinking this is a good base that folks can improvise on according to their own tastes.  Next time I will also include some Italian sausage.

We tried this last night. The idea was good, it sounded good. It wasn't bad. But not something we will be putting in the rotation. I did mine in the crockpot as well.

I thought this was a great base recipe and we will definitely make again. I took the advice of other reviewers and added two cans of tomatoes. I also added a can of corn to the mix and seasoned salt instead of regular salt. Next time I make this I will do half tablespoon if Italian spices. I thought the sage was over powering with the full tablespoon.

I liked this recipe, but actually thought it would be good to include some sauerkraut.  I'll try that next time. My kids weren't a big fan of this recipe, but they still ate it.

I like others also added an extra can of tomatoes with seasoning and a bit of sweet basil, other than that - no changes. My husband who doesn't like cabbage - loved it! Thank you! It's a keeper in my recipe box

I really enjoyed this recipe, as well as my family. I think next time, I would try to add a bit of a kick to it as we like things more on the spicy side.
