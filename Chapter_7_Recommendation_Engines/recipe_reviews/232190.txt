I was surprised how good this was, but I made some changes to the recipe. Per other reviews, I doubled the batch and pureed half the canned tomatoes to reduce tomato chunks. I didn't have parsley so I used dried basil. About the milk, since I doubled the batch, I was prepared to add 4 cups of the whole milk. I added 3 cups and I wish I had cut it back even more. The taste of the soup was excellent before adding the milk (I taste at different stages) and the volume (3 cups) in my opinion diluted the taste too much. I suggest putting in half the milk and then tasting it before adding the rest so you can adjust to your liking. I'm going to try fresh basil next time because the dried basil was an excellent addition. This I think is an great base recipe that is forgiving with regard to substitutions. I served with grilled provolone/American cheese and ham sandwichs ... family loved it!

Loved it with alterations. I used crushed tomatoes instead of diced for that creamy soup goodness. No sugar and 1% milk. Milk has enough sugar. I also used a little chicken broth, less than 1/4 cup instead of salty chicken base. I'd make it again but only after changing a few things here and there.

I used a can of San Marzano crushed tomatoes (didn't want chunky soup) and fresh parsley, otherwise followed the recipe.   As a kid, tomato soup always was my favorite, and it's still right up there in the top 3 as an adult.  Considering there are no fresh tomatoes in it, this actually is a pretty nice soup, tasting a lot like tomato bisque, and not so much like something out of a can.  Do let it cook for a little while  (maybe 10-15 minutes), as the flavor does improve with a little simmering. Thanks, Rachel, I like it and will make again.

This soup is awesome and my kids LOVE it!  We are on an extremely tight budget so I had to use what was available in the house.  We did not have dried parsley so I used dried basil instead.  I did not have a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes in juice (I only had a 14 oz can of garlic fire roasted tomatoes) which I used.  I did however have a huge fresh tomato in the fridge. I blanched the tomato and then diced it...just wonderful.  I took the suggestion of the other reviewers when it came to adding the milk.  I only used a cup and it was perfect!  I also added a little fresh chopped spinach to the soup.  My kids had one taste and now can't wait till dinner.  We are having this tonight for dinner with grilled cheese (provolone, cheddar and American cheese)...YUM!!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

LOVE THIS! So easy and fast. I did change a few things... I seasoned the tomatoes with salt and black pepper then ran them through the food processor, added basil and traded the milk for heavy cream. We made provolone and mozz grilled cheese sandwiches for dipping! We need to double the recipe next time.

I loved the soup. The alteration I made was to add one cup of water with the chicken base and cut the milk down to one cup. Also, I only used one tsp of sugar.

At the end I added some thawed tortellini and this made it wonderful.

I made it and added half in half instead of milk, added a little bit (1 cup) of chicken bouillon, let it simmer.  Everything else was by the recipe, itâ€™s delicious!

I loved it we did it at the Boys and Girls Club for the 21st Century program. I forgot the milk. Believe me it did not need it. Most of the kids love it. All of them tasted. We ate it with grill cheese sandwich. All the teachers and other staff love it.
