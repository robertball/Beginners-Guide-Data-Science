Great name for the recipe, it's a cookie with a brittle taste to it.  Very easy.  I did not have the exact amount of the PB chips so I used brittle chips on top with mini chips.  Very cute.  I'd make these again.  BTW, the 1-3/4 total hours ready....unless you are waiting for them to cool completely....

My mom has a recipe just like this and it's a classic. Add a tsp of salt and a 1.5 tsp of  vanilla. Also sub out peanut butter chips for nuts. Easy to whip up.

Amazingly delicious! I used dark chocolate chips and salted caramel chips. Also added 1tsp salt and 1-1/2tsp vanilla per another reviewerâ€™s recommendation. Very easy and love that there are no eggs so I can make for grandson who has allergies.
