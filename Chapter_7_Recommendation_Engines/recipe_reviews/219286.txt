I found it quite good when I served it to a group of friends. How ever it was a little tart .I would add another 1/2 cup of sugar and at least 6 jalapenos,
I added 2 and did notice the were even there.

My wife and I liked this, not loved it but liked it a lot. It was fun to make once to say I had a jalapeno cheesecake but it wasn't so terrific that I need to make it again. I will admit tho that I didn't want to make a full 9-in. cheesecake to I taylored this down to fit a 9-in. Keebler graham crust. To do this I used 2 (8 oz) pkg cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 tst vanilla, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup lime juice and 1 tsp lime zest. I baked at 350 for about 50 minutes or until center was almost set. Thanks for such a creative idea!

The taste was excellent! The directions were not. If reducing the oven temperature to 250 degrees, you need to bake it about 90 minutes. It also overflowed in my oven. Way too much batter for a 9 inch springform pan. Has anyone tried a 9 x 13 cake pan?

I think somebody missed something here. I made this twice and seemed to me, something was missing.   The third time I made this, I added a tablespoon of sugar to the crust mixture.   That did it.

Honestly omg. If you are passionate about flavor and new experiences this recipe is just divine. Fair warning I added a 1/4 more sugar than it calls for and I didnt use sour cream...I mixed milk and lemon juice. With those challenges and changes it still yields a flavor that cannot be missed or hated. Keeping this one around. Thank you so much for a fun idea!!

Made this about 6 times, and about to make it a 7th. This cheesecake is so delicious, and refreshing - even friends who worry over my use of hot and spicy dishes - were in awe of this one! Yes, it's tart! I have dozens of recipes for sweet cheesecakes, but this is just wonderful for a summer dessert. A couple of times I have added a sour cream topping, which smooths out the tartness a little, but this was more to cover a cracked top. I've made it with up to 3 jalapenos, and it's still not very spicy, just a lovely aftertaste of a little heat. I also tried a ginger snap crust which very much compliments the other flavors. It freezes very well too!

Great job. I put a grim reaper pepper in. It was better not as much pepper taste, but twice the heat. Plus I put  1/2 c pecans in the crust. Try it with pot butter it's great too

It's Jalapeno Day at work today. First time ever making cheesecake. It was a hit. Delicious and gone quickly. Creamy. Read many reviews and added the tablespoon  of sugar to the graham crackers. This is an amazing balance of flavors. Would have loved to have added a photo, but it was gone before I could get someone to take a picture of it.

I wanted to take a picture, but my family ate it so fast I didn't have a chance. It was great! Few changes on my end: I made a chopped almond crust instead of graham cracker (2 cups raw almonds chopped to the consistency of breadcrumbs, 2 tbsp sugar, 4 tbsp melted butter), and I used a 1/4 cup of diced canned jalape√±os. I also put on a simple whipped cream topping (1 cup heavy whipping cream, 4 tbsp sugar. Whip in a stand mixer 3-5 minutes until it forms soft peaks). Anyway, will definitely make this again!

Very creamy, not overly sweet. Slight flavor of jalapeno, not spicy hot. My jalapenos were a little small so I used 2: 1 red &1 green (1/4"diced)
