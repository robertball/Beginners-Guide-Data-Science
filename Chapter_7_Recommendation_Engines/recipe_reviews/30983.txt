I have tried this recipe twice.  Once with pork, and the second time I splirged and used the veal. I want to try it next with regular beef.  It is a great recipe! the meat was so tender!  My husband went nuts over this.  He was putting the gravy in his plate and using bread to dip in it.  I served it using the veal to some friends of ours with a nice salad and inexpensive wine, they told me that was one of the best dinners they have had and asked for this recipe. Try this recipe -- you will love it!

excellent recipe!!!!  I browned meat in oil and garlic before cooking.  Sliced the meat, poured gravy on it and kept warm in the oven waiting for my family (30 minutes) which made the meat even more tender.

Yes on tender, no on pleasing the boss!  I even added salt, pepper and brandy.  Definitely no depth of flavor with this.  I have other recipes that I'll use when the boss comes over.

Wonderful! We truly enjoyed this recipe. I only added a little extra thyme and pepper. The gravy was fantastic. Thank you for sharing!

Minor change - roasted veal in a bit of olive oil and diced garlic in the Dutch Oven. Pretty well followed the recipe for the rest. Taste was ok, but the gravy  was a disappointment - expected so much more flavour. Essentially everything was boiled - not crazy about boiled meat/vegetables.

Great recipe, have made it twice now. I recommend salting the water before cooking and adding the vegetables you can make some tasty variations. Great recipe Anne, thanks.

This is a great basic recipe.  I used a clear mushroom soup broth that I had made the day before instead of the water and doubled the thyme.  I also used zucchini and yellow squash from the garden instead of mushrooms and potatoes.  Finally, for the gravy I removed all the veggies and plated them around the veal, then added the flour dissolved in water without the egg yolks.  The end product was great.   I served it with wild rice and garlic roasted brussel sprouts on the side.   Even my husband who is generally not a veal fan had seconds.  I will definitely make again.

This was good! I will definitely make it again , only reason I gave it a 4   Star instead of a five , because I would tweak the recipe slightly.. I would add some onion and garlic seasoning and use fresh thyme and salt and pepper plus add 1/2 white wine to gravy. I cooked the veal in cubes and used my pressure cooker turned out so tender.. maybe garnish with warm baguette for the extra gravy !!! Wonderfully light but hearty comfort food
