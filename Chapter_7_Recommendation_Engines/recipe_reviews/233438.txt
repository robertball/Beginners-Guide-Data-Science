This is a good recipe. I used frozen wild blueberries and added finely chopped walnuts to the crumble. Just a point to ponder. If you are making a gluten free recipe without gluten free ingredients then your reviews are of no use to those of use who require gluten free products and can even be misleading because of the different characteristics of gluten free flours as compared to wheat flours.

I chose to make this with AP flour and regular baking powder because we do not eat gluten free. I did add in an additional teaspoon of baking powder and a half teaspoon of salt. I added the cherry juice into the wet ingredients instead of waiting until the end (to prevent overmixing) and I tossed the cherries in the dry ingredients to help prevent sinking. I made no other changes. Baked at 350*, they were done at just over twenty minutes. My family made quick work of these, they were pretty much gone by mid-day. My husband actually called me at home to ask if I could make more. DELICIOUS!

A pretty nice recipe. Using mature, ripe fruit is key. I think the batter is missing something as it was bit flat. It needed a kick of cinnamon or some zest or something. Maybe another viewer hit it when suggested putting more cherries, hmmm.
Anyway, I used a typical gf flour blend adding 1 1/4 tsp of baking powder. Thank you for the recipe.

These were pretty good.  I thought they would have a bit flavor than they did, but it's a good base for me to build on.  I did use gluten free flour, and I also added a splash of vanilla extract along with the almond.  I used coconut oil and because we don't normally use white sugar, I used an unprocessed cane sugar in place of that.  And I used dark brown sugar in the topping.  I also used buttermilk instead of milk and added a pinch of baking soda.  They are nice and tender but just a little bland.  I think next time I'll add some grated orange or lemon zest or oil and see how that works out.  The recipe's a great idea and a keeper, but it needs a little more flavor for us.  Thanks for posting!

Great muffins!  They really did taste like cherry cobbler.  I did not use gluten-free products, but made as directed otherwise.  I might use a few more cherries next time.  Don't overfill or the streusel will run over the edges of the muffin cups.  Made 15 muffins.  Yum!

The batter was thick like dough when I followed the recipe exactly. I had to double the liquid ingredients to moisten to muffin batter texture, which meant I had to add another 15 minutes or so of bake time. The flavor of the muffins was very good and my kids especially loved the topping.

I made these as the recipe says and found them way too sweet for me. They are good but if I make them again I think I would skip the topping.

These were a bit too sweet in my opinion, but well worth the effort. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar
