A very odd cake, but tasty enough.  This one gets 4 stars from me because I just didn't care for the bits of corn that got stuck in my teeth.  I did substitute butter for the oil and skipped the raisins and nuts.  I made this for a corn festival, but probably won't make it again.  The icing, however, is wonderful and I will use that part of the recipe again!

My students made this for their "Corn" feast and in spite of 8 sets of hands helping- it came out wonderful.  One student asked for more!
