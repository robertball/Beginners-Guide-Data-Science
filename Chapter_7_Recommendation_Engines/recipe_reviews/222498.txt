As a basic recipe it is a good foundation.  I cooked the carrots and squash in low-sodium chicken broth (adding 1/2 chopped onion with the zucchini to cook).  Increased the horseradish to 1 tsp and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp onion powder for flavor.  Made fresh breadcrumbs and added 1 tbsp. Italian blended seasoning to them (again, to heighted the flavor profile).  Skipped the grated onion, but added 1/3 c fresh grated parmesan cheese to the topping.  You could easily add chopped chicken, browned ground beef of turkey to make it a one dish meal - or keep it as a stellar side dish!

I was a bit disappointed in the lack of flavor. Seemed like the prep time wasn't worth the end result. It wasn't bad but needs something else to add to the flavor. Not something I would make again but it was a decent side for lunch and used up the veggies I needed to get rid of out of the fridge.

This was a very nice way to mix some veggies up so that their tasteful. Everyone enjoyed them. I used a carrot, zucchini, and squash mixture. I was asked for the recipe which is always a good sign. I will be making it again!

Made it last night and we both loved it.  I used graded carrots and cooked the 2 vegetables together since I was in a hurry.

I needed a dairy free casserole, and this fit the bill. I cooked the carrots with a little water in the microwave until nearly done, then added the squash (little more water) and all the seasonings and finished them, with the addition of a bit more herbs since one reviewer indicated that it needed something. I then stirred in the mayo and proceeded as directed. My family loved it, but I thought the mayo flavor was a bit overpowering....would like something more savory. I'll make again and play with the flavors. Thanks for a great starter recipe!

Easy recipe that can include other vegetables.  I added a tomato and okra to mine.  Overall a very good flavor without all the cheese that so many other recipes include.

This is good and easy.  I did not pre-cook the zucchini.  I microwaved the carrots with 2 slices of onion, then chopped the onion.  Added more horseradish as I love how it mellows when baked.  Will definitely make again.

This was fantastic.  Hands down fabulous.  Very easy to make, and I had all the ingredients in my kitchen.  I have a feeling I'll be making this for many years to come.

I forgot to mention in my previous review that I used walnuts instead of bread crumbs, which added a nice flavor and crunch. I rarely have bread crumbs/bread on hand; but I always have nuts!

This was VERY tasty, but a little too greasy for my liking.  Next time around I'll try substituting the mayo with yogurt.

I thought this was great, but my 8yr old was repulsed. I'm guessing it was the horseradish. My husband was in the middle. I used plain greek yogurt to keep it healthy.

I used just a small amount of mayo and the rest fat free Greek yogurt; also added more horseradish than the recipe recommends and baked it for longer than recommended.  It was different and light, I liked it.

My family actually enjoyed this even though they're usually not the vegetable type. I doubled the recipe, and followed some suggestions from a previous reviewer. I heated the whole carrots an extra 10 minutes so they were soft to cut but not mushy, then added sliced onion with the zucchini, and sprinkled some garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and Badia Sazon Tropical seasoning (orange bottle in Spanish aisle) on the vegetables, and then I added some parmesan cheese and extra Italian seasoning to the Italian breadcrumbs mix. I then heated it for an extra 5 minutes to make it a little toasty.

This is so delicious! A nice difference from other squash casseroles - refreshing. My husband loves it and most of the kids, lol (all but one who generally gags on squash no matter how it’s prepared). The horseradish is not overpowering and gives it a unique and fun flavor.

This is such an easy and delicious way to enjoy healthy vegetables.   The mayo was a bit concerning to me when I made it but the end results were fabulous. The only things I  did to change recipe was to add vegetable stock seasoning to boiling water and added yellow squash to veggies. Also used onion which I think really helped the flavor. This is a keeper.

This dish is excellent.  Quick to make, also makes a nice lunch low in calories.  I don't care for horseradish so I substituted  about 3T  Franks chili sauce.  I also used my spiralizer  for the zucchini.

Chose this recipe because I try to avoid canned soups in recipes and the addition of the horseradish intrigued me.  I made three changes.  I substituted the grated onion with one diced onion,  caramelized in butter. I also instinctively doubled the sauce.  Glad I did because it turned out perfectly moist.  Third, I mixed in about 1/2 c of a good Parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs and butter for the topping.

Loved this casserole. Made it for dinner guests. They took leftovers home and requested recipe.
Followed recipe ingredients, but used 1 full tsp horseradish.
Easy to make a few days in advance! Bring it to room temp before heating at 350 for 30 minutes.

I honestly can't decide whether I liked this or not. I wanted something different for Christmas this year and this recipe seemed to fit the bill. My sister enjoyed it but the rest of us just couldn't decide if we liked it or hated it.  It was definitely interesting and different and I'm glad we at least tried it but not sure if I'd make it again.
