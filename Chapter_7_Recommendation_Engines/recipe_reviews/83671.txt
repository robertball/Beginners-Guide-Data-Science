I took a chance and made this for a potluck at work, and everyone liked it.   I used more pork (cut into cubes) and more caraway.

Wow, this was much better than I thought it would be! I used a 14oz can of sauerkraut, and I thought that was plenty (too much, possibly). I added a little more paprika and caraway. The flavors worked together surprisingly well. I suspect that this recipe isn't going to please everybody, but I would certainly recommend it. Thanks!

This was great. Delicious! Doubled the recipe, but  didn't double the sauerkraut, one 16 oz jar was enough. Added 8 oz  of sliced mushrooms, since we had them on hand. It turned out very well - and the leftovers were as good or better. Will definitely make it again.
