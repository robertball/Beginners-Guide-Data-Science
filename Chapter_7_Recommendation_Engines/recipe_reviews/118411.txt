I just got finished eating.. Oh My Goodness, this soup is AWESOME! I looked at everyones reviews and took the best of all of them and came up with these hints... FIST and most important, if you are on a diet, just enjoy this recipe and don't try to alter it. Splurge... it's worth it! I browned bacon to use the grease to sautee the onions and then layered the ingredients. I used a hambone from Honey Maid Hams that I had left over. I also dumped in the bacon that I used initally. I also added shredded carrots and used more chicken broth than suggested.... I also added an extra 1/2 bag of peas half way thru the cooking time for added texture.... AND I think although alot of people skipped the milk, I think it is an important ingredient as it giives the soup a smoother texture and helps to thicken it, which helps with the additional liquid that had been added. It is delicious and satisfying! OH! and you can't forget to add crispy croutons to the top before you dig in!!! ENJOY!!!

I agree with all the other reviews. I followed the recipe layering etc. with just a couple changes: Used chicken broth, more than 5 cups, did not use the milk either, added my ham bone(ie why more than 5 cups broth) and forgot the bay leave. Put in crock over night. In the am, I sifted the bone and extra fat out. Gave it a big stir and OMG it was fantastic! It's for dinner tonight! I am having a hard time keeping my husband away from the pot! Thanks Deanna W.

Great! I used chicken broth instead of water and I believe 5 cups was not enough. I eyeballed it, and used more. It turned out fabulous though!

I changed the recipe a little because I wanted to cook it in a pot on the stove instead of the crock pot, but I used the ingredient portons exactly except I added 2 stalks of celery and about 9 cups of water to cover a ham bone.  I cooked it on the stove for about 2 hours until it thickened up.  It turned out deliciously.  I didn't add the milk at the end -- didn't need to.

this was a fantastic recipe!  i agree with other reviewers....more than 5 cups of liquid is needed.  however, the flavor is amazing - i used 4 cups chicken stock and a couple more of water...milk optional.  i also made a vegan variation by omitting the ham, doubling the carrots, adding a bit more onion and salt, and using vegetable stock in lieu of water and milk.  my vegan friend and my picky husband loved it!  this will become a standard in our house - never going back to the condensed version!

This was my first time making split pea soup and it was SO easy and turned out great!! I used chicken broth instead of water and added some chopped celery too. Also, I cooked it on low for about 8 hours because I was gone all day. Great recipe and super easy!!

The recipe delivered as promised, a hearty soup, and in the slow cooker, it was very easy.  Prep time took alot more than 5 minutes, however, which didn't diminish my enthusiasm for recomending it.  I even doubled the recipe, using 5 cups chicken broth and 5 cups water.  I added celery, and didn't have bayleaf, so omitted that.  I think next time I would add some ground rosemary or thyme and maybe some fresh parsley.  It made enough to have leftovers, and freeze, as well.

So good and so easy!  This recipe has become a permanent addition to our rotation.
I did use chicken broth instead of water, but did not need to change the quantity of liquid.

Pretty tasty. I would recommend using chicken broth instead of plain water. I also added celery and a cup of rice which were nice additions. I substituted pork sausage instead of ham, and added a dash of smoke flavoring. The milk adds a nice creamy touch.

I left out the ham. Because I don't eat it but it was real good without it. I put in a little more milk because I needed it to be a little soupier.  I ate it over cornbread. Yummy!!!!

Disliked that it was not ready in the time allotted (4 hours and 5 minutes).  The peas did not split until 2-3 hours later...due to the fact that directions did not say to soak the split peas overnight.  

For a beginner cook, ALL directions need to be written down...otherwise, they will not know to do a certain step until they get more experience.

WOW! This is really good! and so easy to make too! I used 1% milk and added a large stalk of celery chopped and it was heavenly! I love the texture of this soup, my son was grossed out about the look of it, but the taste was great! :)

This couldn't have been easier to make and made a hearty and delicious meal! I used 4 c. of fat-free chicken stock and 1 c. of water (don't forget it needs to be boiling when added) and did not add salt (ham is salty enough) and added a chopped stalk of celery with the carrot and a sprinkling of thyme. It didn't look all that great while it was cooking but after 4 hours I stired and it all came together beautifully. I left it cook for another 1/2 hour and thickened it with 3 heaping tablespoons of instant mashed potato flakes and added milk per individual serving per individual's taste. This is a nice thick and chunky soup. I recommend a smokey ham for lots of flavor. I know I will make this again, it's really good!

I made this exactly as written except I forgot to add the milk at the end.  I had one cup of soup when it was done and was pleased with the taste.  I remembered I hadn't added the milk so I added the milk, and had another cup.  The second cup with the milk was MUCH better than the first so I think you'll be much happier with the taste if you add the milk... I give the soup four stars without the milk and five stars with the milk added.....

This soup is the bomb diggity.  It's the first 5-star rating I've ever given.  The only subs I made were instead of water, I used bouillon.  I used some bacon-esque "ham" that I fried first and then sauteed the onions in the oil. Everything else I left the same. I'm gonna make some more tomorrow.

Exactly what a pea soup should taste like! I didn't use a slow cooker b/c I realized there was just too much volume for my slow cooker, but it came out perfect anyway! I've been looking for a good tasting pea soup that doesn't require a ham bone, and this is def it. I bought and shopped up a tiny pre-cooked ham and used that. I love this soup - and it freezes well too.

Used leftover ham I had in the freezer.  Added a little celery because i could, and went with 4 teaspoons chick bullion along with the 5 cups boiling water.  Cut down on pepper! 
Didn't need milk until i reheated the next day.  4 hours on HIGH in the slow cooker was perfect.  *I used no-soak split peas (refer to cooking instructions on bag of Split Green Peas)*  I think others that had undercooked peas may have had a different variety - not yet split- that needed soaking. Also, remember to add BOILING water.

very good...I used chicken broth instead of water. I don't have a crock pot so I used my leCruset dutch oven and placed in a 325 oven for about 5 hours and it turned out great...did not use the cream at the end as it tasted so good without it and I could lose the extra calories...

Very good for those looking for a hearty and healthy meal. I used 7 cups of chicken broth and came out the perfect smooth consistency (not that thick, gunky stuff that split pea soup can sometimes be) from the slow cooker. However, after refridgering, it was too thick again. I just added a little milk to thin it out and it was fine. Might use more chicken broth next time though. It was VERY good and would make it again.

This was okay, I think next time I make it I will not add the bay leaves.  Their flavor kind of over powered the dish.  I love the idea of cooking it in a slow cooker and adding milk at the end.  Thanks for sharing!!

I sub-ed turkey ham for regular ham, added 4 stalks of celery, 5 cups of chicken broth, and 2 extra bay leaves. I can not say enough how rich, tasty this was on a cold fall night.

As someone who puts fresh garlic in just about everything, I have a hard time believing this, but I didn't like the garlic in this recipe at all.  My husband agreed - the flavor of this soup isn't as good as a comparable recipe without the garlic.  For me, it overpowered the earthy flavor that I love with split pea soup.

My new go-to Split Pea Soup recipe. Really good and so easy! I  used water the first time and it was perfect. Used reduced-sodium chicken bouillon the second time and it was too salty. Going back to water from here on out. Definitely add the milk at the end! My whole family loves this, even our 2-year-old.

Yummmm!!!  SO DELICIOUS and EASY!!  I used chicken broth as suggested.  For you parents who work all day, this was my crockpot version:  layer ingredients, as directed, the night before serving; place crockpot in fridge overnight. The next morning, take crockpot out of fridge and add more broth if desired (I added 6 cups total, and the end consistency was slightly thicker than jarred baby food).  Cook on low ALL day (I cooked my 9.5 hours total).  After that long in a crockpot, the split peas were cooked down so much that the soup had a pureed consistency.  I loved that.  Honestly, I forgot to add the milk, and we still loved it.  Refrigerate leftovers; the next day, the peas will have absorbed more of the liquid & the soup will be thicker, like creamy mashed potatoes.  Even better yet!!!

I had some leftover ham, and was searching for a split pea soup recipe. This was a winner. Simple and delicious. The family loved it, and I will certainly make it again. The only thing I changed was that I left out the milk. It was pretty thick, so I might add more water next time. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

Yummy but i needed to add a lot more liquid- 4 more cups of chicken stock- in order for the peas to not be "crunchy"

This was so good!! My daughter who abhors peas had 2 bowls of it!! 
I also shared it with our single neighbor guy.
I doubled the recipe because we had so much left-over ham to use.
We will have the left-overs tonight, and freeze the rest for another day.

I  halved the milk for the first day's serving.  As the soup thickened over time, I added a little more hot milk to bring to right consistency, each time I reheated. (Also left milk out until serving time, so that it wouldn't spoil.) Thought the milk was a strange ingedient for pea soup, but it worked in nicely. Family said best pea soup ever.

Never had split pea soup before & I was looking for an option that was non-dairy. I made enough of this to bring to potluck where it was a huge hit!! I'll definitely be making it again & again for our family.

Excellent recipe! I made this exactly as written with the exception of using low sodium chicken broth instead of water. This recipe is super easy to make and tastes wonderful! My husband could not believe I didn't use a ham bone to make it.

Loved this soup!  Thanks so much- it was SO easy to make.  My mother has been making split pea soup since I was small- she tasted this & said she would use this recipe from now on.

Next time I'm going to use a ham bone- thanks again!!!!!

There could not possibly be a simpler way to make delicious split pea soup!  I just tasted this at the Oregon relatives, begged the recipe and made it myself for the first time.  Their version called for chicken broth instead of water -- but that's the only change I made.  I agree that a little milk or cream added at the end makes a difference in the flavor and texture, not just the ratio of liquid.  Happy to find the recipe on this site (as usual!).  This one's going in my book!

I threw in 2 pork chops instead of ham as that is what I had and I used chicken broth instead of water.  This was delicious!  Perfect for a snowy day in South Dakota!

This was my first time making split pea soup...loved that I didn't need a ham bone for it.  I used 4 C vegetable broth and 1 C water.  I cooked it on high in my crockpot for 5 1/2 hours and some of the peas were still a bit crunchy.  Also, my carrots were still not as soft as we like them...next time I will slice them much thinner.

This is an easy recipe with a delicious result. The soup is hearty without being heavy like others made with cream. I used chicken broth instead of water. 5 cups was enough, but I did soak my peas before making. I have a new go to recipe for leftover holiday ham. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the ingredients, except I added 2 good size sprigs of fresh thyme and 1 sprig of fresh rosemary and about a half cup of diced celery.  I did not layer my ingredients.  The thyme added wonderful flavor.  Everyone loved it, even my stepson who does not like split pea soup.

Used ingredients as directed. Minimal prep time involved which I appreciate being a man cook. Used a ham hock I had and probably about another cup of meat. Used 2 cups of soup stock as well as 5 cups of water. After 8 hours I woke up this morning to a very nice, hearty, and tasty soup. I left it in the crockpot all day and I guess the beans must have expanded somewhat more. Soup had the consistency of mud by the time I got home from work. Not a problem 2 more cups of chicken stock couldn;t fix. I enjoyed it very much for my dinner this evening as well as my 10 year old daughter. She wants it in her lunch tommorrow. I will definetly make this again. Thanks for posting this very good recipe!

Delicious!!! Split pea soup has been my favorite soup for as long as I can remember, and this was just phenomenal! I did read through the reviews before I made it, and I took some of the suggestions.

First I added in a ham hawk, a few red potatoes, and I cooked some turkey bacon (I also used ham I cubed up) and ripped it apart and threw it in the soup. I also caramelized the onions in the same pan I cooked the bacon. I did omit the salt, because I didn't think it needed it. I also used about 9 cups of chicken broth. With all the extra potatoes, and ham hawk, it needed it. I also did keep the milk. Don't skip this part. It makes the soup a bit thicker. 
The one problem I had was that it didn't cook fast enough for me. I had it in the crock pot on high for 5 hours, but the potatoes and carrots were still not cooked through. So I transferred it into a big pot and cooked it for an additional 10 minutes on my stove. I served it with homemade biscuits! Perfect!

This was good, but man was it ever THICK!  I don't have a slow-cooker, so I used my favorite Le Creuset Dutch oven in a 250 oven for about 4 hours.  I omitted the onion and added some cubed potatoes and substituted 2 cups chicken broth for 2 cups water.  Didn't use the hot milk...added more chicken broth instead.  We both liked it, but the leftovers turned into a solid mass with "Zip-Loc" imprinted on the top.  Heating it up in the microwave with additional water made it fine, though.  Maybe the starch from the potatoes?  Anyway, I'd definitely make this again.

So easy for anyone to make but I will try the chicken stock next time as I had to add some extra seasoning cause it was a little bland. Oh, I would not leave out the milk, I didn't and it added a smoothness to the soup. Very good, a real comfort food with a grilled cheese sandwich, yum, yum...

tastes like my mother's homemade split pea soup! yummy! i did however use chicken broth instead of water and added 2 stalks of celery. Enjoy! also, if you use chicken broth you do not need to add any salt, if you do it'll be too salty. (though still delicious)

Delicious! I took advantage of some of the other reviewers' comments and used chicken stock, ham bone and a bit of thyme. My husband and I really loved this soup. We tried it with the Cheddar Buttermilk Biscuits and it was a great fall meal!

Great but made modifications. I made with chicken broth and added extra spices like a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I did not add milk. A lot of comments about it being too thick but in my opinion that is how split pea soup is supposed to be :)

I boiled ham neckbones and used the boiling water from that. A smoked ham hock would work as well. I also added a little celery seed, extra carrots, a coarsely chopped golden potato, and a large jalapeno for spice. Bacon bits or grated cheddar cheese make a lovely garnish. Divine! With a soup this simple, there are endless ways to make it your own. You can't go wrong!

This was very good.  I did as others have done and used chicken stock.  I think next time I'll add an extra cup of water as the soup was quite thick, but it was delicious.  I cooked it in my crock pot on low for 7 hours.

Great slow cooker soup! I used my water and chopped leftover cottage roll. Came out a little salty but very yummy. Definately will find comfort in this recipe again. Thank you!

I though this was very good, but my husband LOVED it.  So much that I will round this up to a 5 because he was so happy and the kids even thought it was ok.  I added a bit of extra garlic and used chicken broth.  I used 6 cups, but then I thought the soup was to thin to add the milk, even though I wanted to.  next time 5 cups, a little less salt if using a ham bone.  I soaked peas over night, not sure if I needed to.  Veggies were mushy - next time do 8 hours low.

Excellent!  I have never made split pea soup, this was so easy and very good.  I added the celery, used chicken broth instead of water and used 5 1/2 cups.  Did not need the milk.

Better than Bouillon makes a ham broth concentrate. I dissolved two tablespoons of concentrate in 7 cups of boiling water, used a ham bone on the bottom of the crock pot before layering all the other ingredients. I also omitted the salt because of the added salt in the broth concentrate. Very nice.

I would leave out the onions carrots and probably the milk and bay leaf and use chicken stock, then it would be perfect o and a ham bone sounds delicious with some nice ham mmmmm mmmmm maybe some scallions at the end but i dont know o and a potatoe would probably be good i was thinking

Very yummy!  I followed the recipe.  I liked the flavor a bit more before I added the milk, the milk mellowed out the depth of flavor a little to much for my taste.  As is I'd score this more like a 3.5.

The flavor of this was excellent. The consistency, not so excellent.  Made exactly as the recipe instructed, I ended up with a crock pot of yellow paste.  It tasted great, but it was a bit disconcerting to be eating soup that resembled pudding.

Definitely use broth instead of water, but omit the salt.  It will still be salty, so use 1 cup ham.  Dice a couple small potatoes and add 1/4 cup sliced celery.  I took a hand blender to this because I prefer a smooth soup instead of a "chowder."

Something went very very wrong here. I think, as it was such an easy recipe, that it was my variation. Instead of cooking it on high for 4-5 hours, I left it on low for 10 hours so it would be done when I came home from work. The peas were still a little hard, and I honestly don't know what went wrong. I ended up blending it in shifts, and it got the green, textured base typical in split pea soup. My friend loved it and even wanted the recipe, although I have a sneaking feeling that she was trying to make me feel better. I also put in 4 cups of water and 1 cup of chicken stock....although I don't think that would yield these results. Word to the wise, don't mess with the temperature settings....or use a crockpot from 1972.

I used country ham since it is what I had on hand - so no extra salt was needed! My husband doesn't like onions so I left them out and doubled the carrots (which seemed like the perfect amount!) He loved the soup and I will definitely make again - soooo easy! Paired it with an egg bread made in my bread machine and it was perfect!

I made this in the crock pot a week ago, doubling the receipe so I'd have more than enough to satisfy my appetite in the evenings during the work week.  I did substitue a couple cans of chicken broth for the receipe's water amount.  This was a very delicious soup!   Great comfort food for a cold Michigan winter.

I used a ham bone with plenty of ham left on it and liked the way this soup turned out.  I used a combination of chicken broth and water and forgot to add the milk at the end.  I have made much better split pea soup but this gets five stars for being very tasty with minimal effort.

Fantastic. Since I have a long, off hour work day, I followed the recipe as written, added a cup extra water, and cooked it on low in my slow cooker for about 9 hours. It was still done perfectly! The extra water gave it the perfect consistency and didn't let it overthicken with the lengthy cooking time.

EXCELLENT! Great winter soup. I did use chicken broth instead of water (3 cans). I also added celery and alittle bit of marjoram. Than I tasted it near the end and added cumin,parsley and basil. This soup is very filling and it really doesnt get any better than this. Well maybe  alittle bit of crispy bacon on top:) Thank you! I will be making this every few weeks during the winter months.

Good soup! We sauteed the diced ham to get rid of the extra fat before adding to the crock pot. Followed directions exactly ,but we all thought it lacked a bit of salt and flavor. We tried another Split pea & ham soup recipe that required marjoram and the ham bone....everyone thought it had more flavor and liked much better than this one, however I will still rate this one a good recipe but just needs more flavor as it was a bit bland without the marjoram and ham bone.

Delicious! I did make a couple of small substitutions, but I'm sure the recipe would be perfect just as is too. I used a smoked turkey leg instead of ham, because that's what I had on hand, and used a quart of chicken broth in place of most of the water to add more flavor. Also didn't add any milk because I thought it was really good without it. This is a super cheap, easy and satisfying dish. It's going to become a go-to dinner this winter.

Sooooo delicious!  I used chicken broth in place of the water after reading other reviews.  I also used my immersion blender for about 5-10 seconds in the end to make it thick and creamy.  Next time I'll omit the salt since the ham added all this recipe needed.  Served with grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches.

This recipe is great for busy families. I make it at least once a month especially in the winter. It even makes great flavorful baby food for your little one, just process it up in a food processor a little more for them. My son doesn't like peas but he loves this soup. I've used the ham, sometimes bacon, or left over ham bone at the holidays and it always turns out amazing! Thanks for such a great recipe!

Followed directions except did not bother to boil the water and cooked on LO for 11+ hours (because that's how long I was at work!!).  Excellent results!  Added a dash of Tabasco and some addtl salt (another 1/2 t atleast) at the end.  Used 1% milk, although I think whole milk would have been better for richer results.  Thanks for a super easy and flavorful recipe.

Yummy! This recipe is a very tasty! I used 5 cups of boiling low sodium chicken broth instead of the 5 cups of water, and when I purchased the bag of Split Peas it came with a ham flavor packet, and after adding the cup of milk I add SOME of the flavor packet to suite my taste. I did not add any salt - thought I would salt it if need be before serving it, but there was salt in the flavor packet. This is a real keeper - will definitely be making it again...soon! It was enjoyed by all, even the dog enjoyed it...LEAVE NO SOUP BOWL UNGUARDED!

Other reviewers suggested adding some chicken broth in place of some of the water. I didn't have any so I just added some poultry seasoning and ground thyme to my water. I didn't soak my peas at all and put 10 cups of water in the pot with a ham bone. Followed the rest of the recipe as is. It cooked for about 8 hours on high while I was at work and the consistency was perfect! Hubby said it was the best pea soup I've ever made and it was the easiest..My kind of recipe, lol. Note: Peas will continue to thicken over time as they are a starchy veggie so you will have to add quite a bit more liquid to heat up the leftovers (if you have any, lol).

This recipe is a keeper! I took the suggestion from a previous post to add chicken bullion to the 5 cups of water. I also used a lean turkey ham to cut fat and calories. I will definitely make this soup again.

Made last night w/ 4-5 cups canned low fat/low sodium chicken broth & 1 cup water, omitted salt, and stirred in 1 cup milk prior to serving.  Tonight I made w/out ham, w/o salt, and used 5 cups water then stirred in 1 cup milk.  I enjoyed it both ways, and the milk seems makes a significant difference. Cooked on high for 3.5 hours, and the carrots & onions broke-up when I vigurously stirred in the milk:  Very thick & creamy soup.  I think pea soup's always bland/unexciting in taste, but this recipe has a 'touch' of Something which makes canned and restaurant versions pale in comparison. To me this recipe outshines both!!  Thanks!

It was good - but I feel it was missing something.....but I can't figure it out.  The flavor was not as strong for my taste.  I will try again but play with some additional spices for a bit more flavor.

This was pretty good.  I made it for my husband who loves split pea but usually eats it from a can.  I wish I would have read the review about adding chicken broth instead before I started making it.  I did end up adding a cup of broth to it anyway.  I also used a blender to mash up some the peas while leaving others unmashed to have the perfect texture.  I doubt we will ever go to the canned kind again.  Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely loved this recipe!  Didn't have bay leaves so just omitted them.  Used fat free milk and left over ham from last holiday.  Super easy and satisfying!

I've been making this recipe for over 20 yrs and getting raves. I just dump everything in the pot in no particular order, and never boil the water, it's just not necessary. I use 4 cups water and toss in 2 whole celery stalks if I have them. If not, no worries, it's still delicious and couldn't be easier.  I've used leftover ham bones right from the freezer, too. Sometimes I'll  use chicken broth for half the water. If I only use water I like to add 2 tsp. Penzey's ham base to boost flavor. It's all good! Thanks for submitting this, family members are asking for my recipe and now I don't have to write it down!

This soup was amazing!  My boyfriend said it was the best soup he's ever had.  The only changes I made was I added 1 diced celery stalk, I used chicken stock instead of water and I added an extra cup of stock.  I also used a left over ham bone to flavor the soup.  This is such a good way to use leftover ham.

This was a great split pea soup recipe. Not sure if adding the milk made that difference, but one of the best homemade soups I've had.

Very tasty! This will be my go-to recipe for split pea soup from now on.  I used 4 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water (with 1 chicken bullion  cube).  I did add milk (cold) about an hour before serving, which I think added to the creaminess of the soup.  I didn't add any additional salt. I cooked it on low for about 10 hours.  The consistency was perfect - mostly creamy but still had a little chewy pea bits.

YUM!  I bought a 20 oz bag of "pea soup" peas that came with a little packet of "ham flavor".  I had made stock with a ham bone and had probably 8-9 cups so used most of it.  I had celery so cut that up, but otherwise followed the recipe (forgot the milk tho) and it's delish.  I was going to run it through the blender but don't think I need to.  Love it! Thank you!

ADDED A 1/4 OR SO OF CHICKEN STOCK FOR FLAVOR INSTEAD OF WATER ONLY, BUT STILL ADDED ADDITONAL WATER.  FORGOT TO ADD THE MILK, BUT WAS STILL DELICIOUS AND LOWER CALORIE WITHOUT IT.  I MAY TRY THE MILK NEXT TIME.

loved it! used 1/2 bacon, 1/2 pancetta for the ham, increased the water by a cup and a half and used vegetable bullion. Added just a few croutons at the table. Perfect!! Will definitely be a regular around here during the winter. Thanks for the super easy and delicious recipe!

I must confess - I am not the greatest cook and I don't always enjoy the process or the results but I have been trying out some crock pot recipes form this sight - trying to spread my wings a bit.
Split Pea soup is pretty much my favorite most food on the planet. So this morning I loaded up my crock pot with the items (as written except no carrots - Boyfriend won't eat a cooked carrot and I added 2 cups of chicken broth) - doubling all the items so I could have lots of soup. When I got home about 6 hours later (cooking on low), I panicked when I peeked in and saw burnt onions. Went to stir it and it was green clay. 
I forgot to double the water. 
This recipe is so amazing that I was able to pour in the extra water and let it cook for another couple hours and it was amazing!!!!
The perfect soup, even with the smokey flavor!!

This is a great recipe.  Based on others advice to use chicken broth I added some chicken bouillon since I didn't have broth.  It is no weak soup.  I think next time I'll cut the broth to half and water half.  It is delicious.  For the reviewers who thought it didn't have enough water - the title says, "hearty."  I love it!  Great and easy!

Really good pea soup recipe! I did add a bit more water as others suggested. It seemed to be a little too watery, but when I added the milk at the end, it thickened up. Yum!

This soup is great! My grocery store was out of split green peas, so I made it with yellow, and we don't care for carrots, so I left them out.

Other than that, I followed the directions to a T and waiting for me when I came home from work was a delicious, thick and hearty pea soup. My fiancee and I both agreed that it was some of the best we've ever eaten.

Thanks for the recipe - this one is a true keeper!

this was pretty good, i'd make it again. i used all ingredients and exact measurements, but had to leave it cooking while at work(i work nightime) so did it on low for about 9.5hrs. it looked/smelled pretty awesome, but since it was meant for lunch(i got home at 7) i just turned off and took a nap. by the time i woke up it had dried out and crusted over, so i had to add water and salt. still, only got it to a thick goo consistency, otherwise i would risk deluding too much. maybe next time i'll use more liquid as some mentioned.

Doubled the recipe and made this with all the ingredients as listed except the bay leaf, but cooked on the stovetop for about an hour.  It was the best split pea soup I ever made.

This is delicious soup, here is my rendition: 8c of water w/ 5 chicken bouillon cubes, 6 slices of bacon chopped up, sauteed onion and garlic in bacon grease (drain before adding), a ham hock and a bag of split peas. Put it in crockpot for 4 hours on med-high. Add hot milk & this is a family thing: add white vinegar to your bowl of soup-Delicious!

This was great! I'm not big on soup, but this was so hearty my family and I loved it. I didn't have ham so I subbed some bacon which worked well. Thanks for the recipe, I've added it to my repertoire :)

I followed the recipe exactly. It is very good exactly the way it was written. If you're feeding it to small children or people watching their sodium, then it is fine as is. Otherwise, I would add a pinch more salt. I also thought it was a little heavy on the onions. But overall, delicious and VERY easy to make.

So yummy!! I loved that I could do this in the slow cooker.  I did use chicken broth instead of water.  I ended up using 2 quarts of broth, because some had said it needed more liquid to cook the peas.  I also added two large potatoes.  I will be making this all the time this winter.

It was easy and tasty. I used chicken broth instead of water, added marjoram, potatoes and celery and omitted garlic and salt since the broth has salt. Used the hand blender at the end to mash the peas more.

Good..I did use 6 c of water and did not add the milk. Although the peas broke down nicely in the crockpot,I still thought it was too "soupy" for me. I like my split pea soup to be thicker. So I transfered my soup to a stock pot and let it reduce on the stove, a slight inconvience for a slow cooker recipe and an extra pot to clean, but no big deal, the soup tasted wonderful. Thanks!

I really love this recipe. I use leftover (spiral) baked ham from dinner, and dice up the meat with a little of the fat and "outer edge" left on it. (I also add a little bit more ham than the recipe calls for.) I love garlic, so I usually add in a little more too. The recipe is easy and perfect served with crusty, white bread and butter. Thanks for sharing this recipe here!

This is such an excellent recipe! I just did a taste test and the soup tastes amazing. And on top of that it is so easy. I looked  other reviews and made it using 5 cups of chicken broth instead of water and added one and a half cups hot water on top of that. I forgot to add milk and it is still great; the next time I make it I will do it with milk. Also I took the suggestion of frying up a couple pieces of bacon and using the grease to saute the onion and garlic. I didn't add the crispy bacon because it actually got too crispy (burned to be exact). If I can make this anyone can!
I haven't made something this easy and this good in a while, thanks Deanna!

I added diced celery and potatoes and loved the idea of chicken stock that others suggested. Because I added potatoes I also added more salt. From reading the other revires, i'd like to add: Don't forget/omit the bay leaves, people, its necessary. I love pea soup and this recipe doesnt disappoint. Thanks!

This was very good, just needed more liquid.  I added an extra 1/2 cup from what the recipe calls for and should have added an extra cup.  I used water, not broth, since you are getting plenty of flavor from having all the vegetables and ham in the slow cooker together - broth has soo much sodium in it (unless of course if you are making it from scratch) and the soup has plenty of flavor without the extra broth.  Next time I will add more water, plus carrots and an extra handful of peas halfway through (as another reviewer recommended) for added texture.

This was my first time ever making split pea soup, and my first time ever trying it too. I don't know if it was something that I did, because as far as I am aware I followed the directions step by stop. The resulting product was not edible. My husband and I were dissapointed. I am still learning how to cook though, so it might have turned out better if I actually knew what I'm doing in the kitchen.

this soup could not be easier!  tasted great.  followed directions exactly, except used chicken stock instead of water.  I checked it after about 3 hours on high and it was done.  It's definitely going into our rotation - thanks for the recipe!

This was outstanding. I did add the milk in as outlined, it turned out thick and creamy. This is a keeper for many years to come. I did use the precubed ham, and it was very tasty just like Mom used to make.

This recipe was excellent. I made it yesterday and liked it so much, I made another batch today to give to my Dad because he loves pea soup. I followed it exactly except I used chicken stock instead of water. The first time I made it I forgot to put the milk in but it was still great. This time I put the milk in but I don't really taste a huge difference. I will make this recipe again. It was great and very easy.

The soup was great, although I took others advice and did a cup more water and I don't think it needed it.  I'd also omit the salt completely next time.  Delicious flavor though.

Really, really good stuff! I used 3 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water and a Honeybaked ham bone, just because I had one but next time I will use the diced ham.  Off of some of the other reviews, I cooked for 8 hrs on low.  Too long for my cooker; the soup started to stick to the bottom and was thick. Not a bad thick but if you like a thinner soup, either add more liquid or I think the recipe was right on with cooking only 4-5 hrs in the slow cooker.  I added part of the peas 1/2 way through for texture but it didn't matter-after 8 hrs it was all one consistency. On good recommendation from other reviews, I didn't add the salt at the beginning.  I tasted at end and it didn't need it. Will be making this again!

My husband and son love this pea soup.  I did make a few changes though.  I added a lot more ham; some finely diced and some bite sized chunks.  I also used 8 cups of room temperature chicken broth and cooked it on low for 9 hours.

This was my first attempt at split pea soup. This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I used a left over ham bone with some pieces of ham that I had stored in the freezer for a few days. I let it sit in the crock pot in water for a couple of hours then added chicken base and the other ingredients. I cooked the veggies before adding them to the crock pot. My husband said it was the best he had ever tasted, better than his mom's recipe.

I used chicken broth instead of water.  This was very good.  My boyfriend, a split pea soup lover, really enjoyed this.

Fantastic!!  I used a nice ham bone from honey baked rather than the chopped ham.  Replaced 2 cups of water with chicken stock.  It was NOT too thick - it was just as it should be.  Thank you for sharing :)

Fantastic recipe.  I have memories of my mum making pea soup in the pressure cooker and it exploded one day and we had "pea rain" coming down from the ceiling.  This was definitely a lot easy and less messy!!!! Very tasty soup.

Wasn't what I was hoping for. Not sure why my peas didn't cook well even though I soaked them in boiled water over night and slow-cooked all day. I do think I did something wrong though. I will try it again. My family liked it except for the texture of the peas.

I took a lot of shortcuts - based on what I had.  Used chicken broth instead of water.  I also used garlic powder and onion flakes.  Left out the carrots and did add the milk at the end - nice touch.  I used the ham bone left over from Easter dinner - as well as two small rolls of diced garlic summer sausage.  Came out great!

We love this soup; it's one of our favorite crockpot recipes.  Like others, we add a couple cups of extra water and some chicken Better Than Boullion.  We don't add the milk.  Delish!

Just okay. I added some extra spices because it seemed like it would be a little bland as written.  I am going to keep looking for another split pea recipe. Thanks anyway.

Used broth & extra like so many others suggested.  I like the broth, but don't think I needed the extra.  It was a bit too thin.  Very tasty.  First time I've ever made split pea soup.  Super easy.  I definitely call this a keeper!

This was super thick, not soup-like at all. Not much flavor either. My family wouldn't eat it and it's hard to ask them to eat something I don't like myself. Might be better with more spices and fluid.

Wow!!! Love this recipe! It was so easy to make & full of flavor. I was truly impressed. The next day it did thicken..almost as a condensed soup..so I would add a little bit of water if you don't like your soup too thick.

This recipe is SO good, even my 7 year old loves it. I made a few changes after reading others' advice. I ditched the milk and used chicken broth instead of water. I also doubled the recipe, but had to cook it 9 hours on high to get the right consistency. The only thing I wish I'd done differently is to either have used 1/2 chicken broth & 1/2 water or to ditch the additional salt as it turned out too salty for my preference. Still really yummy!

The prep time for this is not five minutes unless everything is already chopped and the peas are rinsed. If you need to rinse the peas, chop the ham, dice and chop veggies the prep time is closer to 30 minutes.

I'm not a huge fan of split pea soup. I am now though Delicious! I have a big family so doubled the recipe and used chicken bouillon cube instead of water per other reviewers. I didn't have any jam bone so I fried up bacon and crumbled on top. Thanks for sharing a great recipe:-)

Very hearty.  I used 1 1/2 bags of peas, more ham and carrots, and didn't use any milk.  It was thick and yummy on a cold snowy day.

This is a seriously good tasting soup...I used cream instead of milk.  I used chicken broth, and added one more cup than the recipe called for, per other users suggestions.  Try it..you won't be disappointed!

Really Good. I threw everything in the crockpot on low for 7-8 hours. I also added potato and celery, and subbed ck stock for the water. It was a good soup. I will make this again.

Delicious!  I added some chicken bouillon and would recommend using more liquid, as the soup was too thick.  It was very tasty and very easy, though!

Awesome! I used 7 cups chicken broth instead of the water. My husband who, "doesn't like pea soup" ate this up. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

I loved the flavor of this soup, but needed to add even more liquid when it finished cooking.  Since I like my split pea soup creamy, I just reconstituted with milk.  It is very yummy!

This is a wonderful starter recipe.  I did make a few changes, I sauteed the onion, garlic, and celery (which I added to the recipe) first in a little olive oil along with some seasonings  -- I like the italian herb grinder you can buy at the grocery store.  And like many others I used chicken broth instead of water (and added more than was called for.)  The soup was good without the milk, but when I added the milk it became restaurant quality.  So good, even my 7 year old ate it!  Am making this again today -- works with bacon too!

Followed the recipe to a T and found it a little bland. :( The texture and everything was great, it just could have used a little more flavour. Might try some of the other reviewers' suggestions next time!

Great recipe! it was my first try at pea soup and it was a total success. I did add more peas at the end to get a thicker texture and used mostly chicken broth (more than 5 cups) and also a ham bone, but otherwise followed the recipe. I will definitely make it again-it's officially a keeper!

This is the best Split Pea Soup recipe I have tried yet.  Besides preparing the ingredients, it is effortless.  I was sceptical about adding the milk at the end,  but it was amazing.  I added 1 more cup of water, but aside from that, I didn't change a thing.

Best split pea EVER! The only two changes I made was to add 20 oz of the peas, and cut the amount of ham in half. Thank you Deanna for such a rich recipe!

Pretty good as it, but I tweaked it a bit to make it look a little bit more appetizing as a finished product.  Granted, most slow cooker meals still end up looking a bit goopy, but as long as it tastes good, that's all that matters.  As it is, this soup makes the whole house smell edible when it's cooking, so can't go wrong with that!

made this exactly as directed and found that the taste was great but it was way thicker than soup.  Will definitely take other reviewer's advice and add more liquid next time, maybe subbing chicken broth for the water.  My husband liked it enough for two servings and took some to work for lunch the next day :)

We loved it!  I totally forgot about the hot milk, that might make it even yummier.  I used 4 cups low sodium chicken broth (I have an organic type that is really tasty) and about another cup of water - and skipped the salt.  I bought a smoked ham bone from the grocery store and threw that in - that created a very strong smokey flavor that the guys really liked.  I will definately make this again - recommend you try a smoked hambone, much better flavor then ordinary ham.

Ahhh, perfect to come home to on a snowy night.  I followed directions, only omitting the salt because I used some very salty country ham.  I also stuck with the water and added and extra cup. Put in crock pot on low, 8 hours later dinner is served!  I like this with a crusty bread or white cheddar cheese its for the crunch. Thanks!

Really enjoyed this soup. Used low sodium chicken broth instead of water, so I added no salt. Added diced ham steak just for the last hour of cooking (didn't have a ham bone available). Cooking time and amount of liquid was perfect for my crock pot.

I love the fact this calls for lean ham instead of a  bone-in ham that is usually far too big and greasy for my tastes.   Will make this on a regular basis.  Thanks for sharing.

A definite keeper.    My changes were fairly minor: I double the garlic, shredded (rather than diced) the carrots, and I used yellow peas instead of green.  Also, because I didn't have a ham hock, I picked up a couple LBs of bacon 'chunks and ends' which I diced, browned and drained before adding.  And I sauteed the veggies in a little bit of olive oil before adding them.  The result: A delicious, surprisingly low-fat soup.

A REALLY big hit.  I followed one of the tips to add a 2nd pound of split peas 1/2 way.  It worked great, but the soup was more like spakle.  I did not adjust the amount of milk to be more to make up for the extra peas. I have while heating it, wisk in the amount of milk to my liking. 12/2009

My additions: Pinch of Cayenne Pepper - a MUST! 1/4 teaspoon of Ground Thyme and Chopped Celery.  I use water, 8 cups,  when there is a ham bone   and  use chicken stock when I only have  diced/chopped ham. Salt is also adjusted for the ham bone and/or Low Sodium Chicken Stock.  I, also, do not heat the water or stock before plugging in the Crock Pot since I want a longer cooking time of 7 to 8 hours on High.  I haven't tried adding milk or cream  because we usually like a dollop of  Sour Cream added to each soup serving.  If I want a smoother soup consistency, I will whisk the soup or, if necessary, use my Immersion Blender. A whisk usually does the job.  The Crock Pot cooking for the Split Pea Soup gets a 5 Star Rating. Easy and Delicious. Make it your own.

I've made this recipe several times and it's always excellent.  I would make one recommendation though; for the ham use leftover honey baked ham.  The honey glaze really adds to the flavor.

This was delicious!  It was easy and quick to put together and smelled so good as it cooked.  I did break down and stir, though, partway through the cooking.  It was eaten before I added the milk and was well-liked that way!

This is great! Don't worry if it seems runny when you first take it out, it will thicken up. I used 2 cans of chicken broth then the rest of the water and included a ham bone as well as the diced ham. Cooked on low for about nine hours. I didn't use much salt up front and it seemed to need a little more flavor because of that, so I threw in some Emeril Original Essence. I didn't add the milk because I knew I wanted to garnish with a dairy... a generous dollop of sour cream plus some crumbled bacon. I will follow all of the above next time, I loved it!

DELISH - EASY - HEALTHY . I disagree with most comments about there not being enough water. I stuck to 5 cups and added corn starch at the end to thicken it even more.  My first time at split pea soup and I'm hooked! This will certainly be a forever staple in my home.

Good recipe. I made the mistake of adding water from the tap, instead of boiling it first, so mine took much longer to cook. It was very good though! I used turkey ham and about 2 1/2 cups of carrots.

Wow this soup was amazing. My kids who do NOT like peas asked for more! My husband went on and on about how good it was!  I used chicken broth instead of water and heavy cream instead of milk (it was all I had!) and then I put shredded mozz. cheese on top before serving..YUM!  This is definite keeper!!!!

This is the best split pea soup that I have ever made.  I substituted chicken broth for the water and added a honey baked ham bone.  You can never have too much ham in split pea soup.  I layered it and cooked it in the slow cooker.  It was so delicious that I never even added the milk.  A wonderful effortless recipe!  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is great, love it! I did use yellow split peas instead of green ones, as they have a lighter "pea" flavor. I also used chicken broth in place of water and I didn't add the milk and it was still thick w/out it.

I wasn't that crazy about this. I thought the flavor was kinda lacking, even after using chicken broth instead of water.  Also the soup was way too thick for my taste (it was the consistency of mashed potatoes) and I ended up adding LOTS of extra broth. My husband however liked it. But I unfortunately will not be making it again.

Second try w/ this one and I'm a novice cook.  I am all about easy recipes that don't require me to buy numerous ingredients.  I read the other reviews and decided to use 3 cans/14oz each of f/free MSG/free chicken broth.  No water in my version.  However, I went with (lots) more . . . garlic [3 cloves/diced], bay leafs [4], carrots [I diced a small bag of fresh carrots] and onions [1/2 large onion].  Found a nice small relatively lean chunk of ham at the store and diced 1/2 of it.   Layered the ingredients as instructed; 4.5-5 hours later, wow, incredible soup.  I did not add any addtl salt initially b/c I was concerned about the ham and broth being enough; however, in the end I added just a pinch or 2 of salt -- I did not add any pepper.  Tastes amazing.  Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was AMAZING.  I did it a little differently, I used hotdogs instead of ham because that's just how some jewish people do it since traditionally we don't eat ham.  I also added a diced potato.  Also, if you use boars head hot dogs and certain types of swanson chicken broth this recipe is gluten free.  I had a friend over for dinner with a gluten allergy and she was able to eat this.  I definitely will be making this again.

This didn't turn out that well for me but I think I cooked it too long in the slow cooker.  I added two stalks of celery and used 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of water, and left everything else the same.  I cooked it for 10+ hours in the slow cooker and it ended up all brown and gross looking.  My husband says it tastes good, but I think it only tastes ok.  It's really mushy but probably an operator error.  It looked slightly better after I added the milk.  I might try it again following the directions better next time.

I was looking for soup recipes to make ahead and freeze for my husband's lunch.  I only gave it 4 stars because I made a couple slight modifications based on other reviews.  I used double smoked farmer's sausage (diced) in place of ham; 6 cups water with 2 packets chicken bouillon; omitted bay leaves, and milk.  What an easy and delicious soup! I was able to make up 4 portions to freeze, plus a bowl for myself to have today.  Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make "ahead" again.

Very tasty and with the convenience of the slow cooker!  We used skim milk and the soup was still very creamy.  Next time we will substitute leeks for the onion for a more vibrant onion flavor.

I made it last night and it tasted great. I just wish that this soup wasn't quite as thick. I have tried extra water and milk and still it just thickens up so much that within a few hours the spoon almost stands in the bowl all by itself...any ideas, folks?

WOW. This is very good! I pretty much followed the recipe and other reviews. Instead of using just boiling water, I used 2 cups chicken broth and the rest water, added a few dashes of liquid smoke, plus added 2 tablespoons of bacon grease for added flavor. Wow. Only thing is be careful with cooking temp/time. I put my slow cooker on high for almost 5 hours and was scraping brown stuff off the bottom and out of the soup. Next time I will put on a lower setting depending on how long I plan on cooking it. Great recipe!!

very good!  I did not put milk in it since my daughter has a dairy allergy, but it was a very nice soup even without the milk.

This was good. The bay came through too strong for me, so I'll reduce it to one bay leaf next time. I added just a tish of liquid smoke, but I think I'll be skipping that too. I used some homemade chicken stock, and next time I'll use less stock/more water. I'm also thinking of only adding 2/3 of the split peas at first, and then adding the rest of them about 1.5 hours before serving for more texture.

I thought I was supposed to soak the peas overnight (like a lot of recipies say to do) so I did.  Oops, the soup looked pureed!  Even though I did soak them the soup turned out great.  Tastes wonderful!  To thicken the soup I added half a cup of milk plus one tablespoon of flour which worked perfectly!

We got the crockpot as a wedding gift and this was the first receipe to be cooked with it!

Even though it takes more than 5 minutes to chop everything and get it in the slow cocker, this is still the easiest pea soup ever.  Definitely use the milk, it makes it creamy and adds some calcium and protien! The only thing I changed was to add a couple stalks of celery and extra carrots.  I will be using this recipe from now on.

Very tasty and much easier than making on the stovetop.  Great to make this after making the Glazed Ham recipe from this site.  I used leftover ham drippings in place of part of the water, tasted like it cooked with the bone.  Just remember to remove ham for soup before adding glaze to ham. Accidently added the milk immediately to the crockpot the first time and it came out better (we thought) than adding it after cooking which we did the following time.  Simmered on high with lid slightly open to reach desired consistency.

Holy cow, is this great!  I've never made split pea soup from scratch before and this was delicious!  I desolved some chicken "Better than Bouillon" in the boiling water and skipped the milk but it was so tasty and rich it didn't need it.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'll definately make this again!

Like other users, I skipped the milk, and I used a package of bacon, chopped for the ham.  I tried to not stir it, but after about 4 hours, it was almost physical painful to see it just sitting there, unstirred, so i gave in and stirred.  It was a huge hit with my family, and everyone enjoyed it, including the two year old.

This was so good!  I substituted the water for a jumbo can of Chicken Stock.  It made it a little soupy but was thick the next day.  I have never added milk to my pea soup before but it really added something extra.  Will make again soon.

Very good for my first ever split pea soup. I also used chicken broth in leiu of water. I used deli sliced cooked ham and it worked out well although next time I think I may go back to the my mom used to make it and add a ham bone for extra flavor.

This is the best split pea soup recipe, with the best tip -  ALWAYS layer the ingredients as directed! It cooks evenly and doesn't need to be checked on much. I have never seen that in any other recipe!  Thank you, Deanna!

To be fair, though, the prep takes much longer if you include rinsing and sorting the lentils, plus chopping the vegetables.
It is a great base off of which to experiment and find your own perfect recipe.
I usually end up cooking it for longer than 4 hours (while I'm at work), since I prefer the split peas very soft. I substitute 3 - 4 cups of chicken stock. I also don't include the milk (lactose intolerant), but cooking it for longer still gives it that wonderful creaminess. 
If you add a leftover ham bone or ham hock in lieu of or in addition to the lean ham, make sure to remove the bay leaves and skim the fat off the top before you fish out the ham bones.

This is the perfect split pea soup.  If I don't have a smoked ham bone, I add in smoke flavoring.

I cook the soup with a ham bone from a spiral ham that has some meat on it.  Then when the soup is done take the ham bone out and cut up the ham from the bone and add it to the soup. I also don't add milk I just add 1 cup extra water when cooking.

I pretty much followed it to a T,  didnt have a crockpot though so I brought it to a boil, and simmered it until it looked done :) Hearty classic! Super easy and a good use of the stuff already on hand. Oh I did add celery and only had part of one red onion but still turned out great. Seasoned salt to taste. NO pepper Bleckhhh! lol

I listened to the other reviewers and used 4 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water in total. I only added 1/2 cup of milk at the end. We also like spicy, so I substituted Andouille sausage for the ham and it gave it an amazing taste! (If you do that, brown the sausage before putting it in the slow cooker).  I cooked the soup 4 hours on high and reduced it to low for the last hour. Best pea soup we've ever had.

This split pea soup has been one of our staples for years now. The one change we make is to increase the cups of water to 6. Highly recommended.

My usual rule is to make a recipe the way it was written, but I made an exception with this one. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used chicken broth instead of water. I also browned a few slices of bacon chopped into small bits and used that as my bottom layer for some extra flavor. I omitted the salt due to the salt in the bacon and broth. Also, like other I didn't add the milk. My husband said it was the best soup ever. High praise from someone that usually doesn't like my soup.

Super Easy and Good - I made just as is with the ingredients and quantities and time suggested.  Turned out perfect.  Only thing I did different at the end was I used 1 cup chicken broth in place of the milk.  Didn't want the extra calories.

I made this with the exception of adding about a half teaspoon of ground cloves. I only added that because I thought this needed some seasoning. I did really care for the soup. It was to bland and needed more seasoning. I am not sure exactly what.

I MADE this today and it turned out perfect but I made some adjustments.  I cooked it with a ham bone.  Soaks the peas over night.  I added celery, and I put chicken stock instead of water, more than 5 cups.  I added a bunch of fresh basil instead of bay leafs.  I cooked yellow split peas instead of green. I made it in my crock pot and simmered it all day. 2 hours on high, 6 on low.

This is my favorite split pea soup recipe.  If I have the time, I make it over 2 days by making the broth from a ham bone, onion, any leftover vegetable, etc. simmered for several hours.  I toss all the junk in the now made broth except the ham.  Let the broth cool in fridge or in my case on my porch in these cold days.  Skim the fat.  It's wonderful broth to use in place of the water and broth listed.  I then use the rest of the ingredients from this recipe.  If I don't have time, I go with what's listed.  I've made it in both slow cooker (8+hours) and stove top (3-4 hours).  You can't beat it, and as other reviews say....don't skimp on the milk or cream!

BEST SPLIT PEA EVER. All 5 boys asked for seconds! We skipped the milk and it's still the best we've ever had! Subsequent times we didn't feel the need to add it but did use half a teaspoon of cumin. Great used with bone-in ham steaks! And affordable for a big family! Mmmmm....

I used our leftover Christmas ham, and followed the recipe´exactly. My slow cooker cooks faster than some and it was ready in four hours. The layering cooked everything perfectly without having to stir. The next time i won't cut up the carrots so small.

On a cold fall day, it is so wonderful to smell dinner cooking. I love my crock pot when it gets chili! This is a super easy split pea. I have made it many times exactly as it is in the recipe. I do like to add a ham bone or ham hock if I have one, and I usually cook it for 5-7 hours, depending on when I get it started. I always add the milk because it makes the soup smooth and rich. I have even made this soup for people who swear they don't like split pea soup, and it always gets great reviews!

This might be the perfect soup for a foggy fall day. The only change I made was substituting evaporated milk for some of the milk, as I had a partial can in the fridge that I wanted to use up. So easy, so tasty. This one's a keeper, for sure!

Love this because it is so easily changed up according to your personal taste! Like others I used chicken broth instead of water. I buy the packaged ham mini chunks and sautee them with the onion and garlic in some butter or a little oil. Delicious!  Thank you!

Good, hearty soup. Very filling. I used 6 cups chicken stock and would probably go with 7 if I make it again. 9 hours in the crock pot on low is plenty to cook the split peas.

Not bad, tasted great but a bit too thick/paste like. I think that might just be a result of slow cooking, but maybe a lack of liquid.

This is a delicious soup! We love it at our house and will be having it often throughout the Winter. It's cheap and easy, what more could a person want!?  I used chicken broth for the water and left out the bay leaf only because I didn't have any also only used 1/2 c milk. My husband and I loved it! I also gave some to a couple ladies that love split pea soup to try and they thought it wonderful as well asking for the recipe.

This soup has an incredible taste to it.  For some reason I always think I'm going to dislike split pea soup and then I fall in love with it.  I used chicken stock instead of water, and spicy Louisiana Sausage instead of ham (I really liked the kick it gave the soup).  Just bought another couple pounds of split peas - will definitely be making this one again!

This was my first attempt at making split pea soup and it was delicious.  Prep time was probably closer to 20 minutes but worth it.  I didn't have a bay leaf, so left that out. And only had 4 cups of chicken broth, so added an additional 1.5 cups of water (not boiling). I added a bit more ham and carrots.  I've been looking for recipes for non-milk base, so I left out the milk.   I cooked it on High for about 5 hours, stirring it once at about 3 hours. It made a rich, semi-thick soup. The leftover for tonight may need a bit more liquid added, as it got even thicker as it cooled.   This was very easy to make. and has already become a favorite!!

Great soup!  I made small changes, I used a little chicken broth in place of water. I didn't have ham, so I used smoked sausage instead "Wonderful"  Lastly- I added 1 stalk of diced celery....   I will definately make this again.

I really liked the creamy addition of milk to the soup. I made a vegetarian version of this as it is my preference - so instead of adding the ham, I added a TBSP of Better than Boullion for added flavor and some chopped celery for a little more texture.  I personally perfer a really nice thick split pea soup and this was perfect - if you like thinner, go ahead and add more liquid. Thanks!

This is great! It is very close to my Grandmother's. I didn't have time to do it in the crock pot and did it on the stove... still yummy! I skip the milk too. I will try it in the crock pot next time.  My kids love it!!

I made this without the ham and then used the blender for thick and creamy soup.  Very good!

This soup is great! The recipe is very straight-forward and my soup turned out beautifully.  Changes I Made: - 5 Cups Water & 1 Cup Low Sodium Chicken Broth - Ham bone added as well as diced ham - I took the ham bone out after 5 hours and let it cook a total of 7 hours (I also added the milk at the end, it's key for the creamy texture) - Like one other person suggested, I added a bit of Sriracha Chili Sauce and also a dollop of Greek yogurt. AMAZING.

Very good soup, although I did take some liberties.  I used a large hambone along with the diced ham.  I doubled the amount of split peas and the other ingredients, although I only used 7 cups of water because my crock pot was ready to overflow!  I figured I'd add more liquid when I removed the ham bone, but I didn't need to do that.  I also threw in 3 slices of bacon and some rosemary at the beginning.  Soup was good and satifying!  When I reheat a bowl tomorrow, I might try a splash of sriracha and a dollop of sour cream to liven it up.  Yum!

My husband announced yesterday that he was craving for split pea soup. I would never in a million years thought he liked split pea soup! I had no idea how to make this, and this recipe exceeded his expectations. He even declared it better than Campbell's! ;)  I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of the liquid. I used 3 cups chicken broth and 2 cups water. I also added the milk as the recipe states. It came out just right - not too thick, not too thin.

I was nervous to make this soup!! It turned out great.  I put a ham bone in the entire time and I cooked it on the stove for about 5 hrs. Also I did not rinse the peas.  My hubby can't stand peas and he loved it:)

Water would have been fine! I used chicken broth and no salt and it was way to salty, next time i'll use water and no salt. I think the amount would have been good. I thought it looked like too much at the end so i took some out, but when it cooled in the bowl I had to add it back in. Next time I wont try to change things so much. the recipe is good as written.

Although I didn't use my slow cooker, I followed the recipe almost exact.  The only deviation was I omitted the milk at the end as I wanted my soup thicker.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results!!  First time I have ever attempted split pea soup and I will always, always use this recipe in the future!  Thanks so much.

I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars! It was great- just one recommendation: wait to add salt til after it's done and you taste it. The ham added a lot of salt to the soup, and it was almost too salty! Otherwise, a fantastic recipe---definitely will be making this again.

Excellent recipe.  It was so easy anyone can do it. I used 4 cups beef broth and 1 cup water, both heated to boiling.  I also added in my ham bones.  The soup is so smooth and flavourful.  This has now become a family favourite.

split pea and ham; soo good together. As other viewers, I used chicken stock.I also added fresh herbs from my garden; thyme, rosemary and curly parsley. I had left over roasted ham, which gave awesome flavor. thanks for the recipe. nan

A lot of reviews on this one! A lot of people changed the recipe too! Yes, I am one of them. It is a great soup. I used chicken broth instead of water and I added a dash of ground cloves and about a tsp. of thyme. Great recipe.

Super easy but a bit bland (it is split pea however).  I did add more spices to jazz it up and I probably only cooked it for about 3 hours.  Don't skip the milk.  I thought it didn't need but ended up adding anyway and it really made a difference in the texture.

I'd been looking for a slow cooker split pea soup recipe that tasted just as good as the stovetop simmer-all-day version and this is it!  The key to well-cooked peas really is not to stir the pot until it's close to being done.  This was a great use for leftover holiday ham and it freezes well, also.  I will make this again.

Wow, great way to use the leftover ham from Easter. I didnt use the cans of chicken broth, what I did was boiled out the bone in ham I cooked for Easter.

I made this per the instructions. The taste was okay, but it was incredibly thick, even after adding extra liquid. My husband liked it better than I did. If you are into extremely hearty soups, this may be a good choice, but I don't think I will be making it again.

One of our favorites! I used chicken broth as others did and about one cup more than the recipe calls for.  I love that you can determine the consistency you perfer at the end by adding the milk.

Good flavor. But too salty like most fast pea soups because of the salt in the ham.

This was great! We don't eat pork, so I used a whole chicken breast (bones & all). I also increased the water, and the salt since it was chicken and not ham. I added a few whole black peppercorns, and a dash of cumin.  Oh, and more than 5 cups of water. I put on low and let it cook while I was at work, about 9 hrs. Oh, no milk (didn't see the need), and no bay leaves (didn't have any). When I got home I took out the chicken breast and the meat fell of the bones, so once it did, I added it back in. This came out great!

The flavor was good but the soup was a little to thick.  It must be eaten immediately after the milk is added or the consistency changes quickly.

This is fabulous thick split pea soup. Definitely add the milk at the end.  I took others suggestions and used chicken broth instead of the water. Serve with some crusty bread...mmmmmmmmmm.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This soup was wonderful!!  I followed the directions exactly, but next time I'm not going to add all the milk at once.  The soup was a perfect consistency (and chunky) before the milk and became a little runny after adding it.  It was great when reheated (thickened up).

Pretty good.  Didn't use ham, used chicken stock in place of water, totally forgot about the milk - but I did add more stock at the end.  Breezy.

This is a very good recipe; I used it as a base for my own creation, which I cooked with leftover bone-in ham (about the same amount listed in the original recipe); also, I used yellow split peas. Very tasty, served along with cooked white or brown rice.

I made this soup last weekend and froze it so the first time we had it was last night.  It froze well.  I cooked it for 5 hours but found it came out super thick and I had to add quite a bit more milk to it.  Didn't hurt the flavour a bit but next time I'll only cook it for 4 hours and will use another half cup of boiling water.  My husband loved it and I'll be making it again - thanks!

Good recipe.  I put in two ham hocks instead of the diced ham, and used chicken broth instread of water (so did not add any salt given the saltiness of the broth).  I added celery as well.  Adding milk was a new thing for me, but I used a cup of whole milk I happened to have on hand, and it was a nice touch. However, next time I make this I will probably use skim milk to avoid the added fat.  Thanks!

WOW!!  This recipe is AWESOME!!  My husband and I love pea soup, and this was my first (and last) recipe to try.  This will go into my favorites.  I added extra carrots because I love them, and added 1 C heavy whipping cream near the end of cooking time.  Exceptional!!

This recipe hit the mark with heartines.  It was a little thick even with the hints about adding more liquid. Next time I will add 7 cups of broth and water mix. And I did add the rosemary which gave it a special aroma and flavor.  Definitely a new favorite!

i'd give this recipe 4.5 stars.  The results were really good, but only after i did the modifications suggested by other reviewers (substituting 2 c water with 2 c chicken broth, adding celery, 4 slices of bacon and more carrots).  I also seared the diced ham to try to seal in the flavor, and add a more smokey-ness to the soup, but the ham still came out tasteless, since all the flavor came out into the soup.  I fried the bacon first, and used that fat to fry the ham and vegetables before adding it into the slow cooker.  Searing the ham really helped the flavor though, and overall, i liked the results.  Next time, i think i'll go with the ham bone instead of diced ham, or just add the diced ham more towards the end of slow cooking.

I thought this was very good!  I added extra garlic, used an extra cup of chicken broth (instead of the water, though I'd recommend using at least two extra cups of broth, if not more), left out the milk and had to leave out the ham as well...(the cat got into the packaging of the ham and I didn't want to eat it after he'd been in it).  The soup is definitely good!  Even my husband who's not a much of a pea soup fan thought it was pretty good!

I never made split peas soup before,but I was looking for something to do with the left over Ham Bone..and found this GREAT tasting, easy recipie! I used 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken broth. I also simmered the Ham BOne from Easter with the peas and some cubed cooked ham.I put in a few more carots. Definately use the milk at the end, it gives it a great texture..

This was a good soup. Less flavorful than other's I've had. I may add a bit of salt or use smoked ham hocks in the future. Served with a hearty bread, like Irish soda   or a Wheat it's perfect on chillier days.

This was my first time making split pea soup.  I'm not a big fan of peas, but my husband like this type of soup, so I thought I would try it since we had ham for Christmas dinner.

I made this recipe, exactly as written, however, I added big chucks of "fatty" ham, which were left over from Christmas dinner.

It was sooooooooooo good!  Thanks for this great recipe.

This was good and easy to make.
I also omitted the milk. The soup was thick.
Next time I will add the ham at the end because my soup took all the flavour from the ham leaving the soup with a nice taste, no need to add extra salt but the ham tasteless. Vey good.

I loved this easy and yummy soup. My picky husband liked it too. I used chicken broth instead of water, I put in a dash of liquid smoke since I used the cubed ham and not a hamhock. I did add the milk at the end. I served it along with BLT's. Fast, easy meal.

Cooked on the stove for about 2 hrs. Added cubed ham and a few chopped slices of bacon. For extra spice, added 1/2 spoon Russian hot mustard when serving the soup. Family loved it!

Wow, this was great! My husband absolutely loved it. Since we don't eat pork, we added diced beef brat hotdog (1) in the soup instead of the ham. I also added 2 stalks of celery and it was so good! I loved this soup!

I thought this soup was very good and easy to make. I used packaged cooked ham and found that it didn't really add any flavor. I think next time I may cook it with an actual ham bone to add more of that smokey ham flavor. Otherwise a great recipe; my boyfriend's mother couldn't stop telling me how great it was!

What a great soup!!!  My family loved this one and it couldn't be easier.  I used canned carrots (drained) to make it quicker in the a.m.  Will definitely make this one again and again and again.  Can't wait for winter to come home to this one.  Thanks.

Tasting this soup, you'd never believe how quick, easy and inexpensive it is to make.
I make this exactly as described, and always use yellow split peas as I think it looks more appetising.

Top notch recipe.  I added carrots, celery, and used chicken stock instead of water.  I also simmered it all day long on low and it turned out perfect!  For a little added nutrition, add baby spinach at the end.

This soup is pretty tasty! Took a chance and doubled the recipe. Grated the carrots as well as two large red potatoes that needed to be used. Used a four-cup container of vegetable broth and six cups of water. Pretty happy with how it turned out!

I don't have a crockpot so I cooked over the stove.  It came out wonderfully.  Added a can of chicken stock, it was great!
