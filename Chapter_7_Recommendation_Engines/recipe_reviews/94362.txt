I think "a really bad manhattan" is an oxymoron. Matter of fact, a couple of these & I become a moron-- just ask my wife. However, I personally prefer a ratio of 3 Southern Comfort to 1 DRY vermouth ( Martini & Rossi), a twist of lemon- stirred not shaken-- & on the rocks. And please , no bitters.

This would be a 5-star recipe but it is missing one ingredient.  You need to add about a tablespoon of grenadine or until it changes color.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe.

This is my mom's favorite drink. I've made it for her twice. She really enjoys it, but she says it's a little stronger than she's used to. I might try a little less SoCo next time.

Try using orange bitters & a splash of grenadine. Delish!
