I rated this a 4 star because we were not falling out of our chairs in love with it, but it was quite good, filling, easy, and will make it into the dinner arsenal. I felt the meal was bland even after adding the seasonings so I added a package of Taco seasoning and a dash of salt, this really helped. I also added 1/4 cup water to the pot as it seemed dry to me, I added a can of corn. After the macaroni was done, I mixed a half bag of shredded mexican cheese in the pot then added the macaroni, mixed it all up and topped with M.Jack cheese. This meal was NOT too much heat for the kids like I feared, perhaps because I cooked the jalapeno with the meat, garlic, and onions instead of sprinkling them on top, The children (picky eaters) even asked for seconds. I served this with sour cream and some white corn chips.

I made this last night with only 1lb of ground beef and left all the rest the same.  I have leftovers and I froze some.  I did up the spices- all of them and added some cayenne.  This was pretty tasty and easy to do.  Thanks for sharing.

My main complaint about this dish was that it is way too mushy - everything just tastes overcooked. If I make it again, I will be reducing the cooking time on pretty much everything except the beef.

We changed this dish quite a bit according to past reviews and our own tastes (we like things with a lot of flavor and some bite to it).  We added a homemade taco seasoning to the gr. turkey, 2 jalapeno's-1 with seeds, a bit more chili and cumin seasoning, crushed tomatoes, 2 extra cloves of garblic, changed the beans to cannellini beans, and for veggies we added roasted red peppers, peas and corn.  So I know it looks like we completely developed a new recipe-haha, but it is pretty close.  We also used whole wheat spirals instead of macaroni-this was yummy and fun!  Not bad-maybe a bit too much kick, but then we put a little sour cream on top to bring it down a notch-it was good and will be great to have all week!

Yum, this one's a keeper.  We adjusted the recipe a bit:  I didn't have tomato paste so I substituted Ragu (cooked down on a stovetop for 15 minutes), and I added Rotel instead of just regular diced tomatoes.  This gave it a nice kick, so I ommitted the jalapenos. (Probably could have used the jalapenos.)  We like spicy things! I also added a bit more cumin to suit our taste.  I also used chili beans and cheddar cheese.   I didn't change all of these things because I didn't think it would taste good, I was just trying to use what I already had.  Overall, really great midweek meal.  Definately has a "hamburger helper" feel to it. It's just not something that I will make for company.

full of flavor, and a little bit on the spicy side. i left out the extra jalepenos, and instead of separate chiles and tomatoes i used 2 cans of Rotel. so easy and so good!

This was a very good recipe; we omitted the tomato paste b/c we didn't have it.  We also just made a 1/2 recipe and glad since we could have fed the neighborhood otherwise.  My 11 year-old made the entire thing by herself, so it is very easy to prepare.

Very good.  I added hominy and 1/2-lb of chorizo.  Served with tortilla chips, it was a hit!

We weren't wowed by it. This may sound like an oxymoron, but it was spicy, but no flavor. I would have given it a two, but it tasted much better the next day. I added some sour cream (after a few bites), good with bread, and I added Tapatio to it to try to add some flavor. This is a good base, but needs a lot of lovin' for it to be a good main dish.

This recipe turned out wonderfully! I ended up reducing the amount of jalapeno peppers because I was serving kids, and also subbed out the ground beef with Morningstar Meal Starts (it's pricey but the nutrition is hard to beat). Also used whole wheat pasta. Love the extra left over batch - it will be great for lunches this week!

this is a good wasy basic casserole. I'd make it again, especially in cold weather. I follwed tips from the reviews and added extra chili powder and cumin, garlic and some taco seasoning. I used more macaroni than called for, 2 cans beans, 1 black bean, 1 light red kidney beans. I also added diced green pepper and chipolte corn.  This does make a lot. I'll be curious to see how the fozen one reheats when we use it in a week or two.

Instead of ground beef, I used Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Beef -- which uses chuck roast. It was amazing. Definitely a keeper.

I used ground turkey instead of beef, black beans instead of kidney beans, and cheddar instead of Jack.  I also omitted the jalapenos.  My family found the casserole tasty and worthy of seconds!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I only made a few changes because we LOVE very spicey food. Instead of Monterey Jack cheese, we used Pepper Jack and we also used Boca crumbles to replace the beef (I'm vegetarian). I also didn't have any chili powder on hand, so I used cayenne pepper. I recommend using more jalapeno peppers if you want it hotter. Fantastic! At my husband's request, I'll be making it for the in-laws too!

Used the advice of the red pepper, taco seasoning and corn addition.  I also switched out the kidney beans with black beans, and I also used a chipolte veggie bean burger, instead of ground beef.  It was very filling, and there are lots of left overs.  I would suggest using the seeds of the jalapenos.  Also, we used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  Less fat.

Followed recipe exactly. Boyfriend loved it. I thought it was boring but I'm not a meat eater. Fit in a one 9 x 13 pan.

I had to use 1.5 lbs of meat cause that was all I had. I kept everything else the same except I used a can of chili beans instead of kidney because I do not like kidney beans. This was good and filling. I put my jalapenos in the meat mixture cause I didn't read far enough ahead that they were to go on top. I don't think it hindered the taste any. Will make again. Think it would be good with some corn, might try that next time.

Loved it! Would give 5, but I made some changes. Added more macaroni; used Rotel in place of tomatoes and chilies; used black beans in place of kidney beans; added green peppers. It was yummy! Even my 1 1/2 yo ate it . Can't wait to eat the dish we froze :)

This was loved by all!  I did a few changes tho...I halved the ground beef, doubled the garlic, used fresh roasted green chili and added about 1/2 # velveeta diced into the mixture.  I will be adding this into the regular rotation.

My family enjoyed this casserole.  My changes were not cooking the pasta more than 6 minutes, adding 1/2 teaspoon of ground cardamom, and 1/4 teaspoon of ground red pepper.   A keeper!

I thought this was a delicious meal. It makes quite a bit so it is great for large families. I didn't use the chiles because my husband has a hard time with foods that are too spicy but I did put the jalapenos on top and it turned out great. Very filling too. Thanks!

Southwestern Casserole Haiku: "Glad that I halved this, not sure we would eat again, coz it's so mushy." This had such a great combination of spices and flavors that I was sure it'd be an instant hit, alas, we were disappointed that the liquid, along w/ the noodles not being directed to cook just to al dente, resulted in a very smooshy mushy texture. The best bites were those that were on top around the edges of the casserole dish where the cheese had browned and hardened a bit.

I have made this twice - in the last few weeks! My family LOVES it, but my 15 yr old daughter demands I make it with sourdough bread (that's been split, buttered and put in the oven)...this recipe seems to require bread! Yummy stuff!!

I made this for the first time, and it was good but not great. It needs a lot more spice, so I added tons of homemade taco seasoning and cayenne pepper. I used only one can of fire-roasted tomatoes because we aren't huge tomato fans in our house. What made this dish really taste great was serving it with Franks Hot Sauce and Sour Cream. Yum!

This recipe was awesome! I did double up on garlic and added a lot of extra chili powder and cheese. My hubby liked it so much he is taking the leftovers to work tomorrow to share with his co-workers.

Not bad, not bad.. When I was reading it over I thought to put corn in it, but forgot until I was grating the cheese over top. D'oh! Needed more veg. :)

It was good and filling. Fed everybody in my huge fam and then some. Nothing special but it was a cheap meal and i ususally have all the ingredients on hand. Definitly will be making again. It needs more spices though.
