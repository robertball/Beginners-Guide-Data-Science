We make this every Christmas and Easter with our honey baked ham. I also substitute another cream of chicken soup in place of the cream of mushroom. A tip: mix up a day early and keep in fridge, that way potatoes are thawed and no mess mixing up at last minute. You do have to thaw the potatoes.

The receipe calls for frozen potatoes but you have to defrost them.  I've made this for years and that's what I've always done and never had any problems.

Great flavor but I couldn't get the potatoes to cook through.  After 45 minutes they were still pretty hard.  I cooked for another 20 minutes and they were still hard.  I tried again with shredded potatoes and still couldn't get the potatoes to cook through. Any suggestions?

My mother and I have been making this casserole for potlucks and for home for ages! It's good the way that it's written, but we like to tweak the ingredients just a little bit to make it suit our family's taste. I use a can of Campbells Fiesta Cheese soup instead of the shredded cheddar. It gives the casserole an even creamier texture and I like the kick that the peppers in the soup offer. Also, you can really use any 2 "cream of" soups that you have on hand. I have used cream of celery, cream of chicken, cream of mushroom...the possibilities are endless. Make this your own and enjoy!

I used cream of celery in place of the cream of mushroom and 2 bags of the fresh refrigerated hash browns.  Best potato casserole I've made and I have tried many.

Loved the recipe and so did my family. 
My tip though is that 350F is not hot enough, it needs to be at at least 375F, and if it gets crispy on top too quickly than just cover it for half the time.

This recipe can be "kicked up a notch" by sprinkling the top with Paprika and/or adding some garlic to the soup mixture. Without some seasoning, it can be somewhat bland.

Hmmmm. I consider myself a pretty good cook, so I don't think I made this dish incorrectly, so I guess our families tastebuds must be quite different than most. This was not a very popular dish with anyone, to include our 6 year old son or my teenage daughter who loves all things potato. This was quite dry ( I used all the required liquid) and rather bland.  The consistency of the hashbrowns was also somewhat off. My 10 year old son *(also a potato fan)thought it would have tasted much better fried up, which we did try for the second go around (still quite dry)  When we were on the third night of it (and this is a rather hearty family of 6 -so you can imagine how well this went over the third night) I used it as a topping for two pot pies I had made -sort of a la a shepherds pie.  Still not a favourite.  But...it did pass the Wolseley test -(Wolseley=our much loved black lab) gobbled it up.
On the positive side -quick and cheap to make so I could see how this would be a fan favourite at potlucks or family parties.

I get compliments on this every time. I use cream of onion in place of the cream of chicken and top with fried onions. You can add some lightly sauteed diced green peppers and cooked ground beef to this for a casserole dinner. I agree with preparing it ahead of time and letting it thaw in the refrigerator--that's the only way I do it. This also freezes well so you can double the recipe. I think this is a bit salty, so I am going to omit the salt next time.

I have eaten many cheesy potato casserole variations.  This is the one I like the best!  The rich flavor and creamy/cheesy sauce is just wonderful!  Now for my variations:     *  I don't use corn flake topping     *  I still DO use the margarine   Here's what I do:     *  Pour the potatoes in a large bowl and put the chopped onion on top.     *  In a saucepan, I mix the sour cream, butter, and soups together and heat them VERY hot.  Then I stir in the cheese to melt and blend.     *  Pour the hot mixture over the frozen potatoes.  (Helps them thaw)  Stir.     *  Bake in 9x13 baking dish (COVERED with foil sprayed w/cooking spray) at 350Â° for 45 minutes...turn off the heat and leave in the oven for about 15 more minutes.  There are never any leftovers!

Usually, I use mushroom soup only for this recipe.  Today, as one user suggested I used Cheddar cheese soup, omiting the regular cheddar.  I also used cornflakes for the first time.  I thought it came out terrific.  However, I will make a couple of suggestion for folks who may have never made this before.  First, let the potatos thaw...don't put in the oven frozen.  Second, for my own personal tastes, I will use 1/4-1/2 cup more corn flakes.  The two cups didn't seem sufficent.  Second, I think 1/2 cup margarine is too much.  I though the corn flakes were a little soggy even after being in the oven.  I would also suggest seasoning with a little garlic or paprika.

when making this, I heat up all the ingredients exept the potatoes until bubbling, than add the potatoes.  For those of you that couldn't get your hashbrowns to cook this might help

Wasn't a fan of this...the cream of chicken soup didn't mesh well with the potatos and the butter made the cornflakes taste funny.

We love this casserole.  I use shredded cheddar cheese instead of cubed.  It mixes better plus every bite of casserole has cheese in it!  I also use the southern style potatoes instead of the hashbrowns and love the texture better.

Tried this recipe the first time for company and it received rave reviews. It's fantastic! Some points: -I live in Canada, and our hashbrown bags come in 1 kg. size. That's 2.2 pounds. And sure enough, while mixing it up, it seemed like the casserole would be dry if I added the whole bag, so I saved back about 1 c. -shredded extra old cheddar for superb cheesy flavour -6 green onions chopped (1 bunch) in addition to the one onion. And I sauteed the onion in butter to soften it first. -I probably used 1 1/2 cups sour cream. Didn't measure. Again, I didn't want the casserole to be dry. -half hour covered then half hour uncovered. I think it could use more time covered. The potatoes were ever-so-slightly too firm, though no one complained as they tasted sooooo good! And yes, defrostint them first is necessary. -butter instead of margarine with the cornflakes. If you're making this, you're not dairy- or fat-averse, so why not go all the way?

Very good.   I used two cans of the cream of chicken soup and left out the onions and butter and cornflakes.  I can see how two cans of cream of cheddar soup would be great as well.  I made a note on my recipe to add a splash of milk next time as well, because they were a tad too thick this time; I think a little more creaminess would be nice.  I used shredded hash browns, so I think shredded rather than cubed cheese works better in that case.  I wish the original recipe had specified whether to use the suqare or shredded potatoes, because I wasn't sure which.  A nice way to make a big pan of potatoes without too much hassle.  Easy to customize to your own personal taste: I could see throwing in some ham, etc.  OH and you DO need BOTH the cans of the soup unless you want to add more sour cream.  There are variations of this recipe that call for ONE can, but note the additional sour cream.  PS  Allow plenty of time to thaw those potatoes; it took much longer than I thought.

This turned out really good. I thawed the hashbrowns in the microwave and only used cream of chicken (2 cans) because I don't like mushroom soup. I baked it at 325 for an hour because I was cooking a ham and it turned out perfect. I did have one request (out of 8 people eating it) to cut the onions in smaller peices, but everyone else said they were fine. I added a couple dashes of pepper and used a couple dashes of sea salt instead of the regular amount of salt it called for. I'm making it again today!

This dish is really a delicious dish!! i microwave my hash browns first to thaw them and and get the water out. Also i found it unnecessary to even add butter. And didnt have greese all over the top , instead it was way more cheesier. thanks for the new addition to my Thanksgiving Dinner.....

Great Recipe!  I have been making this for years, in place of the sour cream I use Lay's french onion dip, and because there are non-meat eaters in my family, I stick to either 2 cans of mushroom soup, or 2 cans of cheese soup if the non-mushroom eaters come.  Great recipe!

I needed potatoes for 50 and Not wanting to peel that many potatoes I opted for hash browns. Over twenty people came up and complimented the potatoes.  They were great.  I realized in the conversion I didn't buy enough soup so I used a can of cream of celery and brocoli cheese I already had along with mostly cream of chicken and only one cream of mushroom.  The conversion for 50 was actually enough for 100. Definitely a keeper.

Must defrost the hashbrowns before mixing. I've made this for years, and only use one can of cream of chicken soup.

I made this recipe twice and both times my family and guests enjoyed it.  The second time I topped it with french fried onion rings during the last 10 minutes of baking.  It is really good!

I have tried similar recipes but this one is the best. The only thing I do different is 1/2 cup of butter. I tried a full cup of butter and it was just to grease.

I have made this dish for over 15 years. I use Cream of mushroom and chicken soup, then one of each.  Everyone always ask me to bring this dish to every event and holiday.  Best dish I have ever eaten.

Very good, made two batches in separate casserole dishes.  Used bread crumbs in place of the cereal and used 1/2 sour cream and half mayo.

This is one of my go to recipes.  All my friends love it when I bring it, and most times ask for it.  I only made one tiny change, which makes sense if you think about it.  I use potato sticks instead of corn flakes.  It's wonderful!

I made this for all kinds of gatherings.  It is the first to get eaten up.  Its quick easy and very very tasty.  I change the topping up from cracker crumbs to crushed cornflakes to just more cheese.

I made this for a church dinner.  Everyone loved it!  I did thaw my potatoes so had no problem getting them thoroughly cooked.  I also used shredded cheese because that's what I had on hand.  I used boxed corn flake crumbs.  Think I'll crush my own next time because I like a crispier topping!

We loved this and can't wait for the leftovers tonight! We love mushrooms, so I used all mushroom soup. I had some baby portobellos I had to use up, so chopped and added them. It was delish! I did use fresh shredded potatoes and had to cook longer. Have a huge convection oven, so no big deal.

Delicious!  I would recommend cooking the onions a bit first - they were quite crunchy.  (Also may reduce onion next time).  I used 2/3 potatoes and 1/3 chopped frozen cauliflower florets and substituted plain greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Couldn't tell the difference!  Good way to make it slightly more nutritious.

Tried it today for Christmas dinner, to go along with roast beef, ham and a whole roasted chicken.  Amazingly easy. I put this in the oven instead of a crock pot. I also used chopped pieces of sharp cheddar and cream of chicken soup with O'Brien hashbrowns. I reduced the sour cream to 1 cup, and added 1 soup can of milk. The potatoes were thawed out overnight. Delicious! I'll make it again, maybe reduce the the recipe by half next time to accommodate 3 people.

I added a few things of my own :) more onion, paprika, pepper, more cheese, more sour cream, instead of cream of chicken I did cream of celery, and a pound of ground beef, a bit of dill seasoning...and I didn't do the butter I think the cornflakes were much yummier without!!

I've been making this for two years so far and it's pleased everyone who's tried it! My family specially asks for this at almost every holiday. I make it AS IS, aside from using real butter in the corn flakes instead of margarine. The best cheese to use is Sargento. YUM!! This one won't let you down! And it's almost too easy!

This is my favorite cheese potato casserole, it's been served by my family for as long as I can remember.  Can't bake a ham without it!  I don't use the cornflakes and I bake it covered in foil.
