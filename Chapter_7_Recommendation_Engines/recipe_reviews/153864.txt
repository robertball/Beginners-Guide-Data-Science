My family loved this! I omitted the pepper and added extra onion and artichoke hearts.Served it over whole wheat rigatoni with asparagus on the side. Delicious.

This was really good, and very quick and easy to make! The only change I made was to omit the olives, as I didn't have any in the house. Very good recipe, will definitely make again.

So easy, healthy and quick to make!  I love the cheese and olives on top.  I will definitely be making this again in the near future!  For those who like a little spice, red pepper adds a nice kick.
