We loved these! Mine did take longer to cook, than stated (about 40 mins. or so), but other than that, they were great. I added a bit of garlic powder to the cheese mixture, just because. I was glad to use up some jalapenos from the garden...I will def be making thiese again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

These were devine. I used November! garden Jalapenos and they were on the small side so I cut the bacon in thirds, just enough to go round and secure with toothpick and I also cooked them longer so the bacon was crisp but boy were they GOOD! This a great little snack to add to other little snacks that you can make ahead of time and serve for company. I NEVER write reviews butyou really have to try these. So much better than the fried poppers.

Everyone keeps saying they take longer than the recipe states.  This is a very simple fix-I always pre-fry the bacon half way before I wrap the jalapenos.  Then I broil them for 4-5 minutes instead of baking them,  and they are awesome!!!!! People beg me to bring them to get-togethers!!!!

These are standard but good.  To address some issues:
1) If the peppers are too hot, you may not have cleaned the ribs/veins/membranes well enough.  Use a spoon and remove all the "light green/white" lines.  This is where the heat is.
2) If your cheese is "melting out" you didn't use cream cheese or not enough.  If you want to use just cheddar or another melty cheese, pre-cook the bacon so it is cooked but still limp, then reduce the cooking time in the oven.
3) If you like crispy bacon...cooking timn is about 35 mins.
4) Feel free to mix other things in with the cheese.  Some barbecue seasonings and garlic salt work well.

They did take longer to cook than listed, although I like my bacon crisp.  I switched to the broiler for 5-10 minutes longer and they were perfect.

Love em!  I use small jalapenos and I substitute jack cheese for the cheddar.  After I slice the peppers, I microwave them for 1 minute, then stuff them.  I cut turkey bacon into thirds and lay it over the top instead of wrapping the pepper because it cooks the bacon more evenly.  You can't tell the difference between the regular bacon and the turkey bacon once these things are done.  They are DIVINE and it's the one thing all of my friends ask me to bring to any of our get togethers.

Delicious but they cook a little faster if you wrap the halves in bacon instead of putting the halves back together. Worth a try if you're considering this recipe.

This recipe is awesome and works terrific on the grill! I recommend cooking them in "halves" as opposed to putting the halves together (I used just 1/2 bacon slice per 1/2 jalepeno), and this also helps in a faster cooking time. For grilling, I'd also recommend to put toothpicks through each assembled piece to keep the bacon from falling off.

I wanted to make a some carb-friendly food for the 48th SB this year and these were a hit. The only real problem that I had is that I did not make enough.
I did take the advice of a comment, to turn on the broiler on for a few minutes after the time to get crispier bacon, I love crispy bacon. I also used 1/2 bacon strips and didn't put the jalapeno halves back together, as the recipe said, and instead left them in halves. Great recipie! I will make these again.

I have no idea what I did differently than everyone else, but these were so hot that we could not eat them.  I'm not sure if the jalapenos I bought were another kind of pepper or WHAT. I love jalapeno poppers as an appetizer in a restaurant, but these went straight into the garbage.  Also, the cheese oozed out of most of them because of the extended baking time (35 minutes).

These are delicious!  I did what many others reviewers suggested by wrapping half a slice of bacon around half a stuffed pepper. To help keep the filling from leaking out I rolled the stuffed pepper in Panko crumbs before wrapping it with the bacon. It helped create a bit of crunch and gave the gooey filling something to stick to. I only needed a few tablespoons of crumbs so it was still carb friendly. Enjoy!

i made this recipe after reading some reviews. i added enough bread crumbs the make the cheese mixture stiff.it did not run all over when cooked.i also took the veins and seeds out of a couple peppers and mixed into the mixture as i like it spicy.i also precooked my bacon a little.i cut the pepper in half and just used half a strip placed over the top of each pepper did not wrap placed on a wire rack on top of an oven proof bowl.put in preheated oven at 350 degrees.was done in about 20 mins.then i set on broil for a couple of minutes to get bacon crisp.i saw a review where someone said this was so hot they could eat it.the recipe doesn,t say the pepper needs to be deseeded and deveined and even though i like it hotter than most folks i would highly advise you do so.i also used fresh picked pepper staight off the vine.long story short i loved it and will make again

Great recipe but I did have to cook them longer. Also I put mine on a rack with a pan underneath so it wasn't sitting in the bacon grease while it cooked.

This recipe is perfect! I added a spritz of lime juice, a pinch of garlic salt, and a pinch of minced Cilantro in the stuffing to spice it up a bit. I also found a brand of bacon which was jalepeño flavored. Otherwise, everything was great! Also, you may need a bit more cream and shredded cheese depending on the size of your peppers. And don't forget to run your fingernails along the inside of the jalepeños to get the spicy capsaicin out of the membrane! (:

These.  These are so unbelievably good.  My mouth is watering just thinking about buying fresh jalapenos from the farmers' market in the summer so I can make these again.  There are not enough words to express how good they are.  Bacon.  Jalapenos.  Cheese.  What more do you need?

MAKE THESE!  They are absolutely scrumptious, come together in a flash and only require a handful of ingredients.  I whipped them up for Super Bowl game day - halve them, devein leaving a few seeds for spice, stuff, wrap, bake.  Done.  I served them with a chunky blue cheese dipping sauce.  The addition of chopped green onions, cilantro and a hearty dash of roasted garlic powder was a no-brainer and added a depth of flavor that elevated this dish.  I placed the halves on a raised rack so the  bacon dripped off.  Easy peasy and perfect!  ENJOY ;)

I made these for a Superbowl party and they were tasty. We were trying to duplicate a local restaurant's method. This recipe was on target. I ground up the cheese in my small food processor and added 4 precooked turkey breakfast sausages (ground up) and a splash of lime juice. I pre-cooked the bacon slightly too as mentioned by other reviewers. We cooked ours 45 minutes too. Yummy. Will definitely make them again! Note: Be sure to buy one whole piece of bacon per popper. I cut mine in half and they were almost too small to wrap around once.

Very, very, very good. I also cut the Jalapenos in half, cut the bacon strips in half, and cooked the halves a bit longer (35 minutes). I also added 1/4 tsp. of garlic powder to the cheese mixture. I had never made these before, so I accidentally overstuffed the pepper halves and my cheese mixture somewhat "blew up" and made a mess. Easy to fix with a sharp knife. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe.

These were amazing!! Like some of the other reviewers I added some garlic salt and made them as halves instead of putting the two pieces back together. My husband couldn't stop eating them! He said I could make those again anytime! I baked mine at 350 for roughly 15 minutes then put them under the broiler to crisp up the bacon to our personal liking. Came out perfect! Thanks for the great recipe! So simple and quick to make!

They were so delicious.   We tripled the recipe,  but needed more.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe.  We only added bacon bits to the recipe and baked them in half.  Gtert is all I can say

I've made these many times.  Sometimes I add chopped grilled chicken and garlic to the stuffing.  I also secure the bacon on the peppers with tooth picks and grill them.  If you don't like things as hot you can scrape the seeds and veins out with a spoon, use rubber gloves if you have sensitive skin.

OMG...these are so good...this is what I did..

I used 7 fresh jalapeno peppers that's all I had. I used I pack cream cheese and warmed it in microwave. I minced about 1/2 pound imitation crab meat in food processor with a little jack cheese.

I stirred that in the cream cheese and added 1/4 c grated parmesian cheese...

I juiced 1 lemon...about 1 tsp garlic powder...1/4 chopped green onion
1 tbsp fish sauce
fresh ground black pepper

I mixed this very well and stuffed the peppers...then I wrapped them in bacon and rolled them in brown sugar...

I cooked them on a wire rack...with a cookie sheet wrapped in foil beneath...these are so good...

Of course I always ask Holy Spirit to make them delicious...He never fails...

I also added some garlic powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper to taste in the cheese blend. I sprinkled bread crumbs on top, and I cut the bacon strips in half.  Then I baked for 15 and then broiled for about 5 minutes on high. It was a hit at my Super Bowl party!

These poppers are fantastic, only change I made was placed a slice of bacon on top (the length of the pepper)instead of wrapping them. If you make these you won't be disappointed, and I will be making them again!!

These are delicious! The only step I did differently, was not to put the halves together. I wrapped each half with the bacon, and baked about 20-30 minutes.  Works just fine and you have double the amount!

Made these today for my husband and he loved them.  I rapped mine in halves instead of putting the halves back together, just because I was only using 4 peppers.  I used half a piece of bacon on each so I had 8 to serve on the plate.

I absolutely love these and they are so easy! I put them on a rack so they didn't cook in their own grease and the bacon was perfectly crispy. It did take about 45 minutes though.

Simple and great!  Cooked them on the grill as an app.  Also, using a Beer Cheese Dip as a filling or Buffalo Chicken Dip is a nice variation.

These are really good but I put cream cheese mixed with pork sausage fried up and drained of course then wrap with bacon & bake. Add Rotel too if you like. Yummy!

I keep these as halves instead of putting the halves back together.  I also partially cook the bacon before wrapping them.  I use thin sliced bacon and use the whole slice for each jalapeno half and I cook them on a wire rack over the cookie sheet so the bacon gets crispy.   I add garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture but I still feel like they need a little more excitement.  I may experiment with different kinds of cheese and spices.  Overall, they are good though.

These are just delicious!  I cut the top off the pepper and then made a slit down the middle, not completely cutting the pepper in half, but enough that you could scoop the seeds out.  Then with a small spoon filled each one.  I wrapped the bacon around the top and then over the middle of the pepper and hardly any cheese oozed out (some previous reviewers had trouble with that).  I did have to bake them for about 30-35 minutes, not the 15 stated in the recipe.  Saved in my favorites for sure.  Very easy and everyone loved them.

I love jalapeño poppers but, after making them several times, I've changed away from 2 steps because I don't think they make this recipe any better -- and maybe worse!  I do not put 2 halves back together.  Half is enough for most people who eat poppers as appetizers.  I absolutely hated the step of wrapping these in bacon as the bacon often did not get done well enough for my taste.  This time I cooked the bacon to about Medium Well, chopped it and added to the top of each half.  I watched them closely, changing the temperature a bit in order to ensure the bacon did not burn.  I think 400 would still be fine for 15 minutes.  So much easier!  This recipe can still be tweaked with similar outcomes.

I love these! I'm doing keto, loving it, having success, and these go perfectly with my way of eating. I like my peppers hot, so I scraped out some of the seeds and white ribs, maybe half, and these peppers were hot enough. I stuffed the jalapeno halves with the cheese/cream cheese mixture, then wrapped each one tightly with a slice of bacon, secured with toothpicks. I baked them at 325 for ~40 minutes (trying to get the bacon cooked without overcooking the rest), and I cooked them on a rack over the cookie sheet. I also made a couple with pimento cheese, but I think I prefer the cream cheese version here. Here's what I learned: bacon shrinks! Next time I'll either precook the bacon a bit, or wrap the raw bacon more loosely using small-medium sized peppers because I want each one to be covered with bacon. I gave it 4 stars because I didn't like putting the halves together. But the way I made them I loved them. It was easy and I'll definitely make these again. Btw, I wear gloves when handling the peppers!

Delicious!! I read several reviews before making this recipe and used several ideas to make this my own.  I added garlic powder,  green onions, smoked paprika,  smoked gouda and I used TURKEY BACON! I honestly didn't think it would taste good using Turkey instead of real bacon but to my amazement,  it was AWESOME!! I cooked them at 400 for 15min and then broiled for 6min.  I will definitely make this again!!

So delicious with just 3 ingredients and cooking tweaks. Just use cream cheese. Some will still ooze out, but the majority stays in the jalapeño. Clean out all the seeds and veins. The longer you cook a pepper, the less spicy it is. It might be a bit soft but it makes it easy to bite into. Use a cheap aluminum broiler pan so that the bacon fat (yep, bacon has fat so be careful) collects in the bottom of the pan and then transfer the pepper halves to a cookie sheet before you broil so you don’t set the house on fire. And for bacon fans, use a whole piece per jalapeño half but it will take longer to make sure the bacon is done.

Made a few times.  Three improvements: 1) cook bacon in frying pan until just wobbly, then cut it up and mix it with cheeses.  Bacon wrapped on outside is hard to get cooked evenly, hard to wrap so it looks all fancy, hard to keep control when eating.  2) Add some salt and black pepper to cheese mixture because cheese can be a little bland.  3) Don't cut peppers in half, make only one slice.  Squeeze pepper open like a coin purse and use sharp, scoop-shaped end of vegetable peeler to remove pith and seeds.  (Don't worry about removing every last seed; they look decorative and are fun to work with your teeth.)  With only one cut, you can position cut on top so cheese doesn't run out too much in the oven. 

Bonus note: You can control spiciness with time.  The longer you leave them in the oven, the less hot peppers become.  

You're welcome.

I just wanted to add, for those of you that complained about how spicy they were, that peppers vary in hotness. Some jalapeños are mild, some medium, some hot, and some inedible. The same is true with any kind of hot pepper. I've had Tamales that made me cry and literally blow steam out of my nose. You can't tell until you taste a piece of the pepper, and without the cream cheese and bacon to cut the hotness, you may be unable to taste any other pepper that night so you kind of have to take your chances! Happy cooking and eating!

Awesome!  I made some changes, added chopped sun-dried tomato's and minced garlic.  Turned out pretty good.  Bacon didn't get as crispy as I wanted it, but everybody loved them just the same.  I liked the idea of adding shredded cheddar.

When i make these make sure you remove membrane and seeds since membrane adds heat.  Also after I cut in half i broil on a wire rack for about 10 mins or until you get blistering on them.  Just flip and do both sides this will help with reduce cooking time.  I perfer to wrap 1 piece of bacon around each half and pin with a toothpick. Also what works well is haberno or ghost pepper cheese use 1 8oz of cream cheese with 1/4 pound of cheese mix in blender.  Hopes this helps out great recipe I cook these about once every 2 weeks.

One thing I found while making these is that bacon takes forever in the oven - way too long compared to everything else. Perhaps it's just my oven, but next time I'll have to partially pre-cooked my bacon so the cooking times line up much better.


The taste great - just make sure you scoop out the seeds or else the peppers will be super hot.


For people saying that the cheese oozed out too easily, perhaps try to freeze the cheese a bit first. I don't know if that will help - but I've seen that cheese sticks usually say to freeze the cheese first before you drop it in the deep fryer.

Loved this recipe! Left jalapeños halved and wrapped in bacon. Baked on cooling rack put on baking sheet so the fat would fall off and the bottoms would crisp up like the top. Added a bit of garlic and onion powder to cheese mixture.

I had a bumper crop of jalapeño peppers and had to figure out a way to use them! I followed the directions,  substituting corby jack cheese (it's what was on hand).  To people new to cooking with jalapeño peppers,  be careful when scraping the seeds and membranes out, the juice can get in your eye...I know from experience.  Any how,  I cooked as directed,  then broiled them for 7 minutes and then turned the broiler off and left the tray in the oven for a few minutes.  I let them rest for a bit and served them up. My hubby said they were exquisite! . I'll be sure to make it again soon!

Very good.  Next time we will par-cook the bacon so that it doesn't take so long in the oven to cook bacon to our degree of doneness.

We had bumper crop of Jalapenos this summer and no tomatoes (thanks WI weather!) so needed a recipe to use up the peppers.  REALLY delicious, a little putzy, but worth it!  I like that you don't have to deep fry them like other popper recipes. I made extra and froze bags of them, then we bake them at New Years for a treat. Easy and Delicious!

Excellent.  Be sure, especially if you are using fresh garden hot peppers, to wear gloves while you prep!  I used bagged mexican four cheese shreds with the cream cheese and added a dash of garlic salt.  Bacon definitely needed to be cut into thirds to cook properly.  Took about 20 minutes for our smaller jalapeno peppers.  Overall time was about one hour, so, you might want to make ahead and refrigerate until ready to cook to time them for a party or football game.

I had 8 medium sized jalapenos and had to make more filling.  Wrapped each half with a full strip of bacon and did not reassemble the peppers and grilled.  They were wonderful!

These are awesome!  It does take about 40-45 minutes to cook these, be patient, you want your bacon crispy.  Don't change anything.

DELICIOUS!

I thought they were good, but a little greasy and I only used half a slice of bacon.  They took closer to 30 minutes to cook.

Great recipe, although IMO the "12 slices of bacon" was optimistic. It takes almost a full slice of bacon to wrap half a jalapeno, and the recipe calls for 12 jalapenos -- which is 24 halves. It took me much closer to 24 slices of bacon to wrap all the poppers.

As others have noted, the 400F for 15 minutes is wildly optimistic. 400 in my oven took almost 45 minutes to cook them. I did make a second batch in a convection oven, and then ~20 minutes at 400 was enough.

Other changes: 1) I pushed a small slice of garlic into the cream cheese of each popper. That worked great. 2) I also made a batch where I pushed a very small chunk of BBQ brisket (1/4" x 1/4" x 1") into the cream cheese (along with the garlic). These things were awesome. My guests preferred them greatly over the ones without the brisket.

I will definitely be making these again...

I want to know what I did wrong? I’m a veteran cook and these blew apart all over the cookie sheet and I basically ended up with a cheese, bacon and jalapeño pancake.  I even watched the video and did nothing different.

We have this often at our house during the summer and we put them on the grill.   If your Jalapeno seems to hot then try this;  Clean Jalapeno well under cool water removing all of the insides then soak the pepper halves in chilled water for about 10 minutes before drying them out and stuffing them.   This will help to take the heat out of your pepper.

Me and my family make these quite frequently ! 

To take away some of the heat from the jalapeños , I would suggest letting them soak in water and vinegar for about 20 min . It won’t take away the distinct jalapeño flavor , just some of the spice ! 

It also takes a little longer for me than 15 min to cook . I’d say closer to 25-30 min and I also use low broil for about 3 min at the end to give the bacon a little extra crisp !

I made them and yes mine took longer to  cook about  40-45min.  I used thick bacon and I also turned several times during the cook period.  I put a sprinkle or two  of Cumin and added some dried cilantro to my filling!  Made for New Year’s Eve  boy they smelled good and taste amazing!  Will make again for the Super Bowl in February 2020!!

Big hit with my adult sons on Christmas day! Ours took longer to bake; next time, I will set them on a rack above the foil to let the bacon grease drain off and speed baking time.  Bonus dish:  I am planning to snip up the leftovers and serve as a topping on Huevos Rancheros this weekend! Should be delicious!

Would recommend a few changes. 

Raised off of baking sheet to drip off extra grease.  Increase time.  

We used both large and small jalapenos. Smaller ones tasted better. 

Bacon did not crisp up and we added 5 minutes. Might try 7-10 min longer. 

Cheese mixture wasn't gooey as hoped.

I used just halves, didn't put the two pieces back together.  Cooked on a rack so they didn't sit in the grease.  Cooked them for about 45 minutes.  They were very good.  I will definitely make them again.

I wished I had kept the tops on the peppers because the cheese spilled out the opening.  It was fine because the cheddar kept is all together and I could restuff the peppers again.  I also used double the cheese and extra thick bacon and cooked them for half an hour.  As the bacon cooked, it sealed the pepper back together and made a crunchy little bit of bacon heaven!!  These were very yummy and will definitely be favorite from here on!!!

I made these excellent Bacon-Wrapped Poppers for a group of women.  Instead of jalapeno peppers, I used Anaheim peppers, and they were absolutely delicious,  The best part was how they made the room smell when I took them in to eat.  Heavenly!

I will make it again, it was great but I shouldn’t have added oil to the pan. It took away the spicy flavor from the Jalapeño and made them soggy. Otherwise, they are yummy and the recipe is great.

Made these exactly as written and they were good, but seemed they were still missing something. The cook time was WAY longer than indicated.

Always a hit with the family. Did use sweet peppers instead of jalapenos so it wasn't too hot for the kids.

Keto Friendly!

We are in love with these... We add all kinds of fun stuff to the cream cheese before stuffing the peppers. Options include browned breakfast sausage, spinach, and even ham!

I didn't use cheese bacause the ingredient wasn't mentioned by the person who gave us the recipe... However we thought they were delicious after cooked on the grill @ the lake. So yummy!

I'll use sharp cheddar next time with the cream cheese. Best recipe in a long time. Thank you for posting!!!

Okay so I made this a little differently. I had banana peppers, cream cheese, and prosciutto. Made the same way as the recipe (minus the cheddar) and they came out perfectly. A bit other than jalapeños so I kept them in the oven about 3 minutes longer. So good.

I cut in half. Less Cheddar that I just mixed in. Cream cheese, bacon, and garlic salt for filling. Wrapped each half in half piece of bacon. Smoked on Traeger for one hour. Then high heat on a pan for 40 min and finished grilling to crisp up. Delicious

Not sure if it was just the fact that we used giant jalapeños or what but these took forever to cook the bacon completely and never really got crispy, plus ALL the cheesy filling seeped its way out of the peppers, literally, and they were wrapped well! So not such a win this time, but would try again, with smaller peppers

Cutting in half to scrap out the insides is important.  I have learned that if the "vain" isnt also completely taken out, then it's a lot more spicy... now if you like it super hot, then just scoop out from the top without cutting it in half.  Guests loved them anyway. Next time, I'll try a different cheese, the cheddar doesn't melt as nicely as other cheeses - Colby jack next time.

Delicious recipe.  We preferred them without the bacon wrap.  Next time I may just mix some bacon bits in the cheese mixture and adjust the cream cheese to cheddar ratio.

Big hit in my household. Again, as with most, about 40 minutes at 400 in the oven. I added in some scallions to the cheese mix, because I had them on hand. I cut the bacon in half to facilitate wrapping, and not have too much overlap. A toothpick shoved through the jalapeño/bacon was a handy tool in a pinch to stop the bacon from shifting while cooking. Lovely, easy recipe that I will surely be making again.

Really hard to wrap the bacon around it so it would stay. It had a great flavor.

I tried laying a half piece on top but it looked dumb. I cut the bacon in 1 inch sections and laid it on top. That looked better and got the whole bacon effect. 

it was nice to cook the bacon with the popper and not have to precook it.

There wasn't enough filling for all the jalapeños I had to make another half recipe to get them all decently filled. I also had to add salt and pepper to the filling otherwise it was really bland.

Great Recipe! I split the Jalapeno's from the tip to just below the stem, folded them open to remove the seeds, then filled with the cheese mixture, wrapped with tight with the bacon.

I was so Disappointed in this recipe and was looking so forward to making them. By the time the bacon was crispy all the cheese had bubbled out, next time if I make them again I will cook the bacon first and crumble it to mix with the stuffing. I thought that they were very bland and needed a little more spice to them.

Good recipe!  I did have to bake mine much longer to get the bacon crispy.  I mixed a garden vegetable cream cheese spread with the cheddar because that is what I had on hand and they were yummy.  I secured the bacon with toothpicks.

Fantastic! Tasty..
Cooked them at 425 deg to crisp the bacon faster. I believe we cooked them a little longer as well.

Very easy.  The only thing that I didn't like was the jalapenos weren't cooked enough.  This could have been due to the thickness or size of the jalapenos.

This recipe is always a hit!  As other cooks have noted, cook bacon half way before wrapping the jalapeños and then you only have to cook for about 10 minutes and broil for about 5 minutes.  I also added garlic powder to the cheese mixture.  Reminder...make sure you wear gloves when removing the seeds and membranes!

Messy if cooked in the oven and make sure you use the smaller jalapeño peppers.  Taste was fabulous.  Took longer to cook and I had to turn up the heat.  It made a mess in my oven but worth it.  Cooking it on the stove would probably be easier and cleaner.

I added some old bay seasoning to the cream cheese, which gave it a little extra flavor. Perfect for parties or get togethers.

I added garlic powder & onion powder to the cheese mixture and I also served them as half peppers wrapped with a half strip of bacon. I made them for a potluck and they were a hit (I baked them the night before and used the warm function on my crockpot to warm them up and keep them toasty the next day).

Delicious!!! I didn’t like how long it took to cook the first time I made the recipe so I made the following changes: added ranch seasoning to the cream cheese and cheddar mixture for extra flavor, cooked the bacon half way before wrapping it (this also helps with the amount of grease), and lastly I wrapped the bacon around each half and cooked cream cheese side up until bacon was crispy.

These are SOOO good!  Sometimes I omit the bacon, since they are really good even without it.  I'd recommend watching the cooking time, since you won't want the peppers themselves to get too soft.  Thanks for this!

I’ve made a few times. I usually use a blend of cheeses and add Italian sausage. Great for tailgating!

Delicious!  I pre fried the bacon, and just placed the 1/2 slices on top of the halved jalepenos.  I added a dash of worshestershire sauce and 1/2 tsp. Garlic powder to the cheese mixture.  Baked at 350 for 15-20 minutes, then broiled for a few minutes.  Will definitely make again!

I have made these a couple times now and they are excellent!  I have used a touch of ranch dressing mix in the cream cheese mixture and last time I made them I put them in the smoker along side some pork ribs.  I smoked them for about 3 hours.  Exceptional!!  
I have just read some of the reviews.  Next time I will add a little bit of garlic to the cheese mixture.
Going to a pool party this weekend.  These will be a perfect appetizer to bring along.

Awesome!  Added just a touch of garlic powder and prebaked my bacon for about 10 min, and they came out great!  Jalapenos were just a tad crunchy, and bacon was crisp!

Love this recipe! This is the second time I made it. Added a little garlic powder (only because I love it), and increased the amounts of the cheeses (because I love cheese). Totally making these again!!!

Cut jalapenos in half and wrapped with high Alf a slice of bacon.  Baked 25  mins then broil 5 mins on jalapenos directly on foil.  The pan with cookie rack baked an extra 5-10 mins

Honestly, I wasn't a fan of these.  The only true saving grace is the jalapeno itself.  Most of the stuffing seeped out during baking, and the bacon itself took much longer to cook than what was mentioned.  I'm not sure how this recipe worked out for others or if they used something I didn't.  I used thin sliced bacon, normal sized jalapenos, and the same ratio of other ingredients.
The flavor was ok, but definitely used ranch dipping to spruce it up.  Honestly, I think I'll be sticking to the sausage stuffed jalapeno recipe I have also from this website.  It's much more tasty and the fact that they are halved means the cheese doesn't seep out of the edges.

I made this on impulse, but I altered it a bit.  Instead of reconnecting the halves of each jalapeno, I just left them as is after cutting and removing the stuff.  My first batch, I put way too much of the cream cheese in it, so they weren't nearly as spicy as I wanted them to be, but they were delicious.  Making the rest of the batch now, using not as much cream cheese.  They did need to be baked a bit longer than the recipe, it ended up being about 17-19 minutes.

This is how my family has always made them. Sometimes we add chopped up shrimp or chorizo to the cream cheese mixture. The only step this is missing is that you need to de-seed, remove ribs and seeds, from the jalapeños before filling them with the cheese mixture. Skipping this step will result in a otter jalapeno popper. We often mix seeds into the cream cheese as well if they're not spicy enough. But for those who can't handle the heat, it's important to remove the seeds and ribs.

I have made these many times.  If you are able to find a jalapeño corer - this tool,makes the job of coring jalapeños a breeze plus with the corer you don’t have to cut the jalapeños in half.  I only use cream cheese (no cheddar) and once the peppers  are wrapped I sprinkle brown sugar on top of the bacon - this gives some sweet to the heat.

My family loves them! The cheddar cheese really does a lot for the flavor making it delicious. I get medium sized jalapeños just so the bacon won’t be put in too generously or not generous enough . Everyone had said it; they do need more time to cook, about 45 minutes for me. I don’t like the bacon to crispy so just eye it

Super delish. I pre-cooked the bacon just a smidge so when I wrapped it it  was limp enough to wrap around the pepper but after cooking in the oven it was just the perfect crispiness. Making this again, for sure.

I give this 5 stars as this is so much better than the ones I've purchased.   I followed the directions, but in the future I would paminate the foil and leave the tops of the jalapenos on.

Perfect way to use the jalapeños from our garden. Easy yummy recipe. Our bacon took 20 minutes to crisp.

A party favorite!
-- clean out all the seeds and ribbing from the jalapinos and rinse them if you want the really mild.  Put seeds into the cream cheese if you want it really hot :D
-- I like adding some chives
-- I usually precook the bacon half way
-- wear gloves when prepping the jalapinos!

I like that they are not hot once cooked.

I did everything word for word. I found that the chili's were too crunchy for my taste.  Next time I'd bake maybe 5 more minutes for crispier bacon and softer jalapenos ( I originally baked 15 exactly).  

If you love salt in your food like i do, you might want to salt your jalapenos beforehand as well, i had to add salt when I was eating (However maybe low sodium bacon was the culprit).

Also, when you get your jalapenos, in order to avoid a crunchy jalapeno rather than softer, well cooked, try to aim for the smaller jalapenos. My grocery store only had ones about the length of my palm and the result was a crunchier jalapeno.

This recipe is so easy and delicious. I also add a little bit more garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture. I also cut the bacon strips in half and fry them up ahead of time. I place a half cooked bacon strip on top of the half of jalapeño pepper before baking. Since we grow our own jalapeños, I keep the ingredients on hand to make when the peppers are ready to be picked.

In the past we've tried grilling our poppers, only to have the cream cheese ooze everywhere and the bacon unwrap even with toothpicks.  So this year I decided to bake them and found this recipe to use as a foundation.  So simple and great results! I didn't bother to put the halves together and just wrapped each half with the bacon.  Didn't bother with aesthetics, so no toothpick.   I also ended up piping (for ease) each half only partially with the cream cheese mixture because I didn't have enough for all the peppers, and maybe that helped?  I didn't get  any oozing of the cheese.  I think I left them in a little longer than planned, too, about 20-25 min.  Still good! Family devoured them all!

I made 36 of them for a July 4th party. I made them exactly as the recipe called for, being sure to broil them for the last few minutes and remove 100% of seeds and membranes.  They were way too hot for a few people, so I didn't let the kids taste them.  But the men who are used to putting hot sauce on everything absolutely devoured them!  I'll definitely be making them again.

Like most people I did have to cook mine longer, around 40 mins and switched it to broil for the last 5 mins or so. I've made these a few times now for different occasions and everyone loved them. I used a maple flavored bacon and added the seeds to galf the cheese mixture for those of us that love heat.

Fourth of July appetizer! This was perfect. (They did take longer to cook than recipe states.) I now realize it could have been prepared and assembled the day before right on the baking sheet lined with aluminum foil, covered with a sheet of foil, refrigerated and taken out an hour or so before baking.  I used a medium thick sliced bacon. Everyone loved it.  The leftovers were good the next day, microwaved 15 seconds.
I'll make this again!

Scrumptious.  Great twist on an old fave (baked asparagus spears wrapped in bacon & 1" slices puff pastry). I like combining savory&sweet so after doing one batch as directed (all savory), I did another and candified the jalapeños by adding sugar to cream cheese before stuffing peppers. No cheddar in 2nd batch, just cream cheese + sugar creamed in.

Been making my own version of this recipe for quite some time,  but I add mozzarella cheese and finely chopped onion along with the sharp cheddar and small amount of garlic powder. Don't really measure anything, though. I go by taste.

I found that the grease from the bacon completely saturated the pepper (I used center cut bacon) and the peppers were so hot - really way too hot.  These went uneaten by our guests.  I am not a novice and my dinner party treats are usually gobbled up.  But this was a complete failure for me.

These are awesome. I doubled the cream cheese and the cheese for 8 larger peppers. I wrapped them as halves, makes them easier to eat. I made them a few times, this time I used smoky cheddar cheese. They do need to cook longer for the bacon and the size, but worth the wait. I love them!!! I do enjoy the creativity of the people in the comments. Will always make these, they are so good!!! The smell of them cooking is divine!

Very easy and very tasty.  Not too hot for even those who don't like spicy/hot foods.  The time given for baking however, is not long enough.  I cooked for 25-30 minutes just to have the bacon done and slightly crispy.  I did follow the recipe to the letter other than baking time so give the 4 stars for flavor and ease.

This was easy and delicious. I was served some of these at a party, and I liked them so much that I now make them almost every week. I do them in halves.

Big hit at my party. However I did leave the jalapeños in halves and I cut the bacon in half and wrapped each half with the bacon.

We make these all the time but don't put the two halves together we wrap a half piece of bacon around each half of the pepper, takes less time to cook. They are so good I'll eat  the left overs for breakfast!  Its better to use gloves when cutting the peppers open and scrapping out the seeds,never know when you may have a reaction to the heat in the pepper seeds!

Tastes great! I made sure to use latex gloves while making this dish. I find that the jalapeño "heat" stays on my hands long after I'm done working with them and can transfer to soft skin - burning eyes are not fun! I also moved my cooking sheet to the top rack for an extra 5 minutes to get the bacon a little more crispy :)

This is the basic recipe that I use BUT I also use roasted sweet red peppers and black olives.  I dice these up really small and mix them right in with my Kitchen Aid.  Because I do remove all the seeds and membranes, I had Harry's Hot Sauce.  Just add it to suit your taste.  

For those of you who have never made these before I strongly suggest that you use throw away latex gloves and a face mask.  I didn't use either one night as I was in a hurry.  Will never do that again.  No matter what I did or tried my hands burned all night, and my breathing was really labored from the fumes.  Gloves and mask and you will be just fine.  They are so worth the effort.

These came out very, very oily. The grease from the bacon drips down and mixes with the cheese (which kinda ruins the flavor, for me) and the jalapeno gets very soggy & soft as well. The whole thing just kinda tasted like hot oily, bacon-y mush.

In the future, I will probably stick with frying the bacon separately then crumbling it atop the cooked stuffed popper.  I also sprinkled some garlic & onion powder into the cheese mixture for flavor.

Baked at 400 for 25 min, last 5 min. broil on high.   Wrap each half individually with bacon instead of putting two halves back together.

This recipe exceeded my expectations, even though I did tweak it a bit.  

- par cooked bacon and chopped instead of leaving whole
- added garlic powder like another commenter said
- I used a cheese I found on sale instead of cheddar (something like Parmesan)

Mixed everything together and baked in just halves, and everyone that had them absolutely loved them! 

I'll be making them again for my Halloween party since we liked them so much.

These are soooooo good. I've found myself having to increase the recipe every time I make them. I cook them for 30+ minutes, and I'm still looking for a way to keep the cheese from running out of the peppers, but they taste fantastic!

Made these and made some with a cream cheese and sausage mix, and some cram cheese with onions and chives.  Loved the bacon the best but all great.  Froze 2 dozen of each also.

I followed most of the recipe, except I kept it simple. I shopped and found the biggest jalapenos I could find and cut them in half with my ceramic knife. 
     Then when the cream cheese had softened  up to room temperature I filled each half with cream cheese and topped each half with a couple pine nuts. I then put the two halves together wrapped them in a half a slice of bacon and put a wooden toothpick through them with the jalapeno halfs resting on the remaining package of bacon so I could shove the toothpick through the other side without sticking myself.      
     Then put them on a tray and cooked for 35 minutes since I like the bacon crispy. 
     No fuss AND ALMOST NO CARBS , so now when I am bored with my low carb diet I have ten cooked assembled jalapeno poppers sitting in a plastic bag in my refrigerator waiting to take my hunger away and provide a 1 carb snack that tastes great. 
     ONE MAJOR improvement is buy a pack of  those disposable food care gloves and use them. It keeps the oil from the Jalapenos from getting on your hands and then on some sensitive part of your body. 
     AND remember if you can do something you love in advance so  you can keep the carbs very low and your  low carb diet works that is really, really special. By the way the Capsaisin in these peppers is supposed to be very good for your circulation. As I get older I find I need all of that circulation stuff I can get.

Sure fire hit right here. Tedious but simple recipe. Overall the recipe as written is great, but with a few mods you'll really amp up the flavor. We like garlic so I added a fair but of garlic powder (not a measurer but I'd guess at least a Tbsp) onion powder (approx 1 Tsp) salt and pepper to the cheese mixture. Also, I left the peppers halved rather than putting them back together bc my peppers were large and I wanted more manageable servings. Used half piece of bacon per popper tho even tho just half the pepper. Good ratio IMO. But you can't have too much bacon right? Serve with some ranch dressing!! May even mix ranch powder into cream cheese next time.. If anyone tries that let me know how it turned out bc now I'm curious! :) Happy snacking!

This recipe is pretty good, although a bit of a challenge to make. It lot longer to cook than is stated (mine took about 40-45 mins.) I recommend securing the bacon to the peppers with a toothpick to keep everything from falling apart in the oven. Also be minimal when wrapping the bacon, otherwise the jalapeños will be mushy and overdone by the time the bacon has cooked through. 
This recipe tastes delicious and makes a great side dish or appetizer, and I'd definitely make it again. The trick is getting it out of the oven in one piece.

These were great, but we didn't half the peppers, we kept them whole & just cored it well to get most of the heat out.
When we did halve them, the cheese kept oozing out.
Great recipe.

All the cream cheese melted out of them because they actually took 40 minutes for the bacon to crisp.
Tasted fine but next time I will have to figure out a way for the cheese not to melt out. Frustrated.

I would cut the stems off so they are easy to just pop in your mouth. Great flavor. Broil the last couple minutes to crisp up the bacon more! Crowd pleaser for sure!

Be sure to leave the tops of the peppers intact otherwise the cream cheese will bake out the top and you will loose flavor.

Like others I didn't put the sides back together, my jalapeno peppers were larger than normal so it took about 3/4 cup of cheese and 3/4 cup of cream cheese to fill 24 halves.  Made for pot luck and they were a big hit. Cooked at least 30 mins maybe more.

I emptied the peppers (so they wouldn't be as spicy) and wrapped them as halves rather than putting them back together.

I needed about twice as much of the cheese mixture and cooked them for 40 minutes.

Delicious though. Try it!

I make these every year for the Superbowl. My whole family LOVES them.  One difference is that I use Chive & Onion Cream Cheese instead of plain and it makes them even MORE delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was kind of bland. I suggest using some kind of dipping sauce and maybe double the filling + add more flavor/spices to it.

I love these and make them very often to impress. However. Two very important pointers. 1) Wear gloves when handling peppers or suffer greatly. 2) the peppers need to have the seeds cut out before being stuffed or else they'll be too spicy!

I agree with many others; just keep the half poppers; don't buy too big jalepeno peppers; put bacon in microwave for 3 minutes prior to wrapping; takes 40 minutes to cook (freeze them and flip them) and put on broil if you need to; soak the jalepenos in cold water for 4 hours so they are not too hot. Love them!! Super bowl party tomorrow.

I would probably recommend wrapping a half piece of bacon around a half a pepper. That way less cheese would ooze out. Also use bacon that's not too thick.
Very good, nevertheless.

These are super yummy, especially  if  you  like  a little  heat.  Add some seasoned salt to the cheese mixture  for taste. Also, par bake the bacon to cut down on baking time (it will  take longer  than  15 minutes  to bake the poppers  if you don't.) After par baking the bacon then wrap it around the poppers.  I also don't put the halves back together, wrapping the bacon around the halves then baking off. Yum!

Tastes great! Made these tonight for Christmas Eve with some friends, I pre-cooked the bacon a little, now when I cook it the bacon should come out nice and crispy!
I also cooked an extra crispy piece of bacon, crumbled it, and added it to the cream cheese. 
So these are Bacon stuffed cream cheese stuffed Bacon wrapped Jalapeno Poppers!

Really good! I cut the jalapeños in half instead of stuffing them as shown. It took a lot longer to cook them than indicated, in order to get the bacon nicely browned, but they were still delicious. They're always the first thing to go during parties. Yum!

terrific, easy to make. 
I cut the whole stem off as well as cutting them in half and coring them.  I also let the cream cheese warm up a bit so its easier to work with. You can usually get an idea of how hot a Jalapeno is going to be by how the skin looks, if its kind of wrinkly or has then brownish rough portions, its going to be hot.

Oh my wow! these are the ultimate football food. Made these for the sea hawk game three days ago and my husband is still telling me how out of this world they are. Only change I made is I wrapped them in halves with the bacon instead of putting them together. They took just a little longer to bake then time specified but they were dinomite. My husband wants again for next game. Thanks for the recipe.

So very good!  I don't put the two halves back together.  I use a half slice of bacon (sliced lengthwise) on each pepper half and it doesn't need the toothpicks.  Also,  it takes quite a bit longer than 15 minutes to cook the bacon and by the time it's cooked, the peppers aren't too spicy.  So amazingly good!!  The filling needs salt, though.  I think I'm going to add garlic powder next time, too.

Would have given all 5 stars, but the oven wasn't hot enough for the bacon to get crispy. Next time I'll turn the oven up to 425 degrees.

These were the hit of my party!   As I was making them I only used half of a piece of bacon per half forgetting that as the bacon cooks it will shrink.  I will use a full piece next time.   I cooked and served them in halves and was glad I did. Yummy!!

Really great appetizer, were gone in a second. I added some good garlic powder to the cheese mixture, and I didn't put the halves together. It took much longer than 15 minutes to cook and I had to turn up the temperature at the end to get some color on that bacon. Next time I'll leave out some of the stems because these weren't spicy at all. And maybe cook them on a wire rack.

Mmm. So delicious. I followed the recipe to a T except I followed the advice of other reviewers, I baked them at 400 for 30 minutes and then about 5 minutes of broiling...so good. I also used cherry smoked bacon. So delicious. I'm bringing them to a potluck.

Warning! Don't sample these raw...unbelievably spicy. They even out after cooking though!

I made these for a pot luck! I prepped them the night before and then in the morning I baked them off. They were a huge hit and everyone loved them! Keeping them cold definitely kept them in better shape. Will definitely make them again! The pic I made was with the leftover jalapeños and bacon I had - wasn't able to cover them entirely with bacon but they were still delicious!!

This was so very simple and delicious! At the time I didn't have any cheddar on hand, so I subbed in mozzarella. I also didn't bother with putting the halves back together, so I used half-slices of bacon for wrapping. 

So very good! The hubby took them to work with him and the whole office is asking for more. :)

Used mozzarella and Italian cheese blend with more bacon inside the filling!! Perfect! Just wish I knew how to keep the filling INSIDE!!

It took a lot longer to cook than I expected, but I live at a higher altitude so I'm thinking that may have affected it. They were so DELISH!

These are sooooo good.  My family loves them.  Like others, I found them to require more cook time.  However, they are worth the wait.  I think I will try the broiler next time as others have suggested.

Great recipe. I wrapped them in 1/4 slice of bacon. I also baked them sliced in half instead of making each one as a whole. They were done in 15 minutes. If you want to brown the bacon more, increase baking time.

Amazing, I used double smoked cheddar for the cheese and baked them open faced instead of assembling back together!

I let mine go for about 40min, which turned out to be a bit too long. They were still quite tasty, though!
