Wow - very tasty! I cut the recipe in half and like another reviewer didn't have all the ingredients so I had to improvise with brown sugar and ginger - not sure if it's a true "ponzu" but it sure was good.

I did not have the bonito or the kelp and added 3tbls brown sugar, 3 tbls pickled ginger and a dash of toasted seasame oil. Put the orange, the ginger and sugar in the bullet with some of the liquid and presto...No cooking.   Great over tuna as well as salad.

Made Grilled Corn with Lime Ponzu Butter from All Recipes.com, couldn't find Lime Ponzu in my store so, of course, came to my faithful AllRecipes and found this Orange Ponzu and made it with Lime... Amazing!  Ended up putting it over our salad, and on the grilled cod we were having as well... this would make your flip flops taste fabulous !
