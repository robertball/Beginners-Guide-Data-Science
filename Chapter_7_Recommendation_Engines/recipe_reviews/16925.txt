I thought this was ok. I didn't like the carrots in it. I just do not like canned carrots and should of replaced them with fresh  carrots or frozen thawed peas or broccoli florets would of been better. I also did not like the breadcrumbs on top they would of tasted better if mixed with some melted butter before topping the casserole.

An absolutely yummy way to use that leftover turkey.  We are "noodle lovers"
so we added twice the noodles (and added more milk and a chicken bouillon 
cube).  I also used all fresh veggies which made for more work, but the taste 
was great.  I used buttered bread crumbs too.
Even my 75 year-old mom who no longer cooks said she had to have this recipe.
Thanks!!

This was a good basic recipe, but I changed it a bit. I used 1 can reduced fat cream of celery soup and 1 can reduced fat broccoli and cheese soup. I also added a cup of sour cream to give it some "tang". I sauteed fresh mushrooms and didn't use celery. (I also only about half the cheese). Then I mixed in the cut up chicken ( a rotisserie chicken breast) and added about 2 cups of frozen broccoli (I'm not much for canned vegetables). After putting it in the pan, I microwaved some butter and the breadcrumbs (I used seasoned ones)and put it on top. I baked it covered with foil. It was very good. My husband really liked it. Thanks for the recipe.

Yummy.  I made a few changes, though: I used 3 cups uncooked egg noodles, no onion (hate it), 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom soup, fresh carrots, mushrooms and celery.  Saute the carrots and celery in the butter until crisp tender.  Add the mushrooms during the last 3 minutes or so.  Lightly sprinkle this saute with seasoning salt and onion powder.  Everything else was the same as the original recipe, except I mixed 3/4 cups garlic herb bread crumbs with 1 Tbsp melted butter before sprinkling it on top.  Great recipe!

This recipe is very tasty, kid-friendly, and easily lends itself to adaptations. I used frozen peas and corn rather than the carrots, celery, and onions and was able to skip the sauteeing step. I added celery salt in place of the celery and onion powder in place of the onion. I didn't have any leftover chicken so I just threw some frozen chicken breasts in the microwave for 10 minutes and then shredded it. These changes made it a lot quicker to prepare, and very kid-friendly. My 4 and 1 year olds declared it "yum!". Oh, and my husband and I enjoyed it too :) Great recipe!

I made this recipe as part of a buffet to feed about 50 performers backstage ast a concert.  I used a bag of frozen peas and carrots instead of the canned carrots.  People went absolutely crazy over it! Since I did not have kitchen facilities backstage,I baked it ahead, rewarmed it in a  microwave, and kept it warm in a steamtable pan. I guess people who live out on the road alot don't get too much home cooked food.  But, then I brought the leftovers to my parents and they raved about it as well.  It also freezes great.

We really didn't care for this dish.  It wasn't bad but really not good either.  Very bland and "soupy".  Will not make again as there are lots of other ways to used cooked chicken that we like better.  Sorry.

This was very easy to put together and very filling.  I used fresh carrots and mushrooms but left out the celery.  I had some deli rotisserie chicken left over, which I used to speed up this one.  To lighten it up, I used the lowfat cream of chicken soup and didn't use the full 2 cups of cheese.  It was delicious, and I'll certainly make it again!

This recipe is great!  I had some leftover chicken and cheddar cheese that needed to be used so I searched and found this gem.  I left out most of the veggies but added flavor by using french fried onions instead of bread crumbs on top.  This is a keeper!

Fantastic recipe!  I modified it a litte bit by adding a cube of chicken boullion and using Ritz Crackers as I had read about it in the reviews. I also left out the carrots and added mixed frozen veggies instead. Overall, it was a hit.  The leftovers will make a fantastic lunch.

I  used 1/2 bag frozen peas & carrots, and chow mein noodles on top.
Would even be good without the cheese. Was a hit in this house.

This is a great basic recipe.  You can substitute the veggies you like or what you have on hand.  I went for a little healthier version with whole grain penne, and lowfat cheddar cheese.  I also used fat free organic milk and this was delicious!  I also added a dash of cayenne pepper to give it a kick.  Will definitely make again.

Really Yummy & Really EASY!  Cooked noodles first, drained and dumped in large bowl...used the same pan to saute the veges....Use fresh carrots - just saute w/celery & onion....add all the other sauce ingred's in the same pan - only 1 to wash. Very user-friendly, so change up the veges or cheeses, add ham, chicken, turkey, whatever!  It will all turn out.   Turkey Salad, Turkey Soup, Turkey Sammies -- and now....TURKEY NOODLE BAKE!  Oh yeah!  Thanks for one more tasty way to use up the t-day leftovers!

This was really good, but I needed to make a lot of changes to suit my husband's taste buds.  I halved the recipe and used olive oil instead of butter, and left out the celery, carrots and mushrooms.  Instead, I used corn and broccoli florets, and a whole medium onion.  I added 1/2 cup of sour cream, garlic powder, and a healthy amount of cayenne pepper for a kick.  For the cheese, I used what I had, which was about 4-5 slices of swiss, and about 1/4 cup each shredded mozarella and parmesan.  I also followed someone else's suggestion and added a chicken bouillon cube.  Everything but the noodles was heated together on the stovetop in one pan.  I toasted and buttered the crumbs, and cranked my oven to 450, so it only took about 10 minutes for everything to be hot and the crumbs toasted.  Yum!

I'm only giving this 4 out of 5 stars because I didn't have mushrooms and I didn't have cream of celery soup.  BUT, I had cream of mushroom soup and I upped the celery to 1.5 stalks (and used a whole small onion).  I didn't have canned carrots, so I used shredded (fresh) carrots (you could dice them, too.)  So technically all the correct flavours/ingredients were incorporate, just not as stated.  :0)

This recipe is EXCELLENT.  We have no leftovers!  (Much to my husband's chagrin.)  I've never had turkey casserole before, but it will be a tradition from hereon in!  Thank you Wanda!

Delicious, cheesy, and pretty easy!  We loved it and look forward to making it again.  It's pretty rich, filling, and salty (not too salty though), but is great paired with fresh, lightly steamed veggies.

I think this dish was really easy to make, and it tasted really good. My husband and two kids and I really ejoyed this meal.  I left out the carrots and mushrooms and added only corn, and it went well with the sauce.

This recipe was good,but nothing I would crave. My husband liked it except for the celery, but he just does not like cooked celery.I used 1 sleeve of ritz crackers crushed and then mixed with 1/4 cup butter and 3 tbsp parmesan cheese for the topping because it is our favorite from another dish. I probably won't make it again because it just didn't strike a chord with me, though my husband liked it.

I improvised a little on this recipe.  Used a whole package of egg noodles.  Added 1/4 cup Watkins cheese sauce mix and 1 tsp. chicken boullion to sauce.  Also, used 3 cups of milk.  Decreased the amount of shredded cheese and used a package of frozen mixed veggies, cooked for 3min.  This turned out very well.  Even better the next day!

Excellent!  I had time, so I used fresh steamed carrots and fresh mushrooms.  I used grilled chicken breast cut up.  This is a delicious dish and plenty of leftovers!

Really good, but super rich. I used fresh carrots instead of canned, just because I know I don't like canned carrots. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I think maybe I would prefer it without the cream of chicken soup, and maybe add chicken broth to the milk/cheese mixture instead, but that is just personal taste.

made this as one of my weekly menu items ahead of time and then froze it so I could just pop it in the oven during the busy week.  I have to say this was excellent everyone loved it and I will be making this again.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Two words: REALLY GOOD!  I used 1 cream of mushroom and 1 cream of chicken (that's all i had on hand). I also used crushed potato chips in place of the bread crumbs.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is sooooo yummy! But it's pretty time consuming to make especially if you have to cook the chicken first. Also it dirties too many pans- one for noodles, one for vege's, one for chicken, one for cooking in oven. Overall it's SO WORTH IT b/c this is really good. Just give yourself enough time to do all the work.  P.S. I took out the mushrooms and added tons of seasoning, garlic salt, pepper, onion powder, chicken bouillon cube (at someone else's suggestion from this list of reviews).

This turned out really, really yummy! I did make a few changes, only because it's what I had on hand. I used frozen grilled chicken strips sauteed in a little bit of butter with 1 tablespoon of jarred minced garlic, then simmered in chicken broth. Once that was cooked, chopped into bite sized pieces and moved to an empty plate; I threw the veggies into the same pan with a little bit of butter. I used 3 fresh carrots, one bundle of green onions, half of a white onion, 2 stalks of celery and 1 more tablespoon of minced garlic. Made the sauce as directed except I only had 2 cans of cream of mushroom on hand. Threw the chicken back into the pan, added one whole bag of cooked "no yolks" dumpling noodles, the salt and pepper and a couple pinches of thyme to the mix. This turned out fantastic and came together surprisingly quick for a weeknight dinner. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing!!

This was good, but when I made it I used canned chicken... which was horrible!  That's what I get for being lazy!  Next time I make it, I will use fresh, rather than canned, vegetables.  I will use fresh chicken!  And I will add potatoes.  We are big on potatoes in my family.  Instead of dry bread crumbs--which are kind of boring--we are going to use French fried onions... Yummy!

I thought this was just okay. I substituted the carrots with peas and added sour cream. Not a real hit in our house. My husband said it was on the bland side. I might try it again but would definitely add other seasonings...

Yummy! I used fresh carrots and mushrooms, instead of canned, and sauteed them along with the onion and celery. It was a great tasting and a comforting dish. It's my husband's most asked for dinner now!

Thia recipe is a great base!  I used 3/4 bag of egg noodles and a whole bag of frozen veggies.  Also used garlic salt and italian seasoning while cooking chicken.  I used onion salt and fresh pepper when mixing everything together.  This mad a FULL 13x9 pan.  This served 4 adults, 2 kids, froze some and had some left for lunch the next day.  Oh yeah-I used fresh mushrooms too.  Excellent!!!

Used fresh mushrooms, carrots,  chopped broccoli & onions.  Didn't have celery so used cream of celery instead of cream of chicken.  Sauteed veggies & used a little celery salt & garlic powder.  used more chicken broth instead of milk & added Ritz crackers on top as others suggested.  We liked this but not "exciting".  Will make again.

This dish was pretty good, but it was missing something.  I might make it again, but try some spices, (maybe garlic?), or something to make it less bland.  I would also suggest using fresh vegetables, as that might make a difference.  It took some time preparing, but it made enough to last three nights for us!  It's very kid friendly, which is good.  Overall it is good, but will take some experimenting to get it to just the right recipe for me!

This is a great recipe. We like noodles and pasta dishes of every kind. This one is really good. Rich and creamy. Used peas instead of carrots like others. May experiment with vegetables next time but then why fool with something that's not broken. Will be making this one again and again.

quick and tasty.  Something different and a great way to use up leftovers. I think it would be good with tuna instead of chicken too.  I used frozen peas, but think I will try broccoli next time.

I read the reviews before making this dish and took the suggestion of using peas instead of carrots.  This dish was very tasty and will definitely be part of my trusty reliable dinner recipes.  I only used 2 Tbsp. of bread crumbs for a light dusting on the top.  Tasty!

Although we like carrots, it just seemed out of place in the recipe.  Next time, I'll probably add more peas and onions and omit the carrots.  I didn't have 2 cans of cream of chicken, so I added 1 cream of chicken and 1 cream of mushroom.  Good stuff!

I felt this is a very good recipe but, I didn't care for the breadcrumbs on top.  After tasting it, I felt it needed something else, so added a can on small peas.  I think that improved the taste.

My family did not like this at all.  We just aren't canned soup people, I guess.  Tinned carrots are also hated, so I used fresh - it's not that hard to cook carrots and they last a long time in the refrigerator.  If I make something similar, I'd use with my own roux - flour, butter, milk, seasonings.

5/5 stars with a few tweaks to add more flavor.  We utilized 1 can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom as well as fresh carrots.  We seasoned the cheese sauce with paprika, Tabasco, red pepper flakes, and garlic since like more of a "kick".  After baking, we added french fried onions on top and baked for an additional 5 minutes to crisp them.

I used fresh mushrooms and carrots and sautéed with the onions and added 3 cloves of garic.   I topped with panko instead of bread crumbs b/c I didn't have any.  
Very yummy!

OK, I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have quite all the ingredients. Chicken and carrots were raw so I threw them in the pot with water and noodles and boiled all together. (Chicken and carrots for a little bit first before adding the noodles and didn't have a lot of egg noodles.) Only had one can of cream of mushroom soup and no onion. Estimated on milk, cheese and seasonings. Threw in some frozen peas. Wow it was good.

I used fresh, steamed carrots instead of canned, fresh sauteed mushrooms &  fresh steamed broccoli florets, as I wanted some 'green'.  It was delicious & beautiful!

This was a hit for my family! I did change some things tho as no one likes fresh mushrooms (except for me) so I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies (carrots, corn, peas, green beans) but did use cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken. I also added another cup of cheese using mozzarella as well as the cheddar. I used a milk/heavy cream mix instead of just milk for a creamier sauce and did not cook the chicken first. I just added it to the mix and cooked it about 10 minutes longer. It turned out tender. Instead of topping it right away with breadcrumbs, I baked it for about 20 minutes and then added them, which I cooked in some butter first to brown them up a bit. Very delicious and is going to be a go to for my family from now on. Super easy to make as well. Thank you!!

Noodle casseroles are my honey's favorite, and this one shined.  I did make some flavor & health adjustments:  I used all fresh veggies (steamed quarter dice carrots before adding, sauteed all veggies including fresh sliced mushrooms.  Added 4 cloves minced garlic at the end of sauteeing.  Cut the cheese in 1/2 and used unsweetened/plain almond milk to replace milk.  Still creamy delicious, and we could taste the cheese.

I used extra celery and sauteed fresh carrots with the celery because I had them on hand.  Nice recipe because you can easily cut back on the meat if you want to do so and up the veggies more. My kids ate this really well without complaining and I liked that it used real cheddar cheese instead of Velveeta. I sprinkled a few Panko crumbs on top instead of the regular style bread crumbs. Didn't add any salt because you don't need to with canned soup having plenty in there.

this was the direction i was looking for.. i doubled the pasta (gemelli) like TOYMOMMY did and left out the milk.. it would have been super soupy if i hadn't.. halved the cheese as others suggested and used pepperjack.. i used cubed pork chops in place of the chicken/turkey.. used all fresh veggies and doubled the amounts.. i used bacon grease for the butter and instead of cream of chicken i used cream of mushroom soup.. i had some leftover sauce from something i had cooked the day before so i stirred that in.. ty for the start of something delicious for bf to take for lunch

Loved this, however I left out the second can of soup.  I do not feel it was necessary, I added one soup can of milk and a bit more. I used fresh carrots and mushrooms. I added a bit of fresh sage and fresh thyme. Pure comfort food! Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe! I'm a huge chicken noodle fan, pretty much anything chicken noodle I'm there. The only thing I did a little different was change the amount of veggies I put in. I doubled them and seemed to come out perfect, I'm a veggie lover. This recipe is very tasteful and somewhat a comfort food. I will definitely make this dish again but would leave out the mushrooms.

This was such a comforting dish! Very quick and easy! I made this for my sick boyfriend and he loved it, so did I! I baked half and froze the other half for a quick dinner one night. This tastes like a thick home made chicken noodle soup casserole! We will be making this one again!

Made as is (without the celery because I didn't have it) and it was tasty but next time I will double the chicken, triple the cheese, and leave off the breadcrumbs.

It's a lot of work for the result.  It is delicious but lots of dishes and a lot more than 15 minutes to prep.  Will make again, but not on a weekday.

We used a can of cream of mushroom and a can of cream of celery.  We had to add extra spices because it was blah. A salt less seasoning like miss' dash and lawery garlic salt.  We used butter crackers instead of bread crumbs. Put butter in the crackers.  So far the sauce tastes really yummy can't wait to try the end result.

Pretty good! Made a sm. casserole (i.e. 1/2'd the recipe) for my fiance & I last night. My fiance liked this a lot (which surprises me b/c he generally DOES NOT care for "creamy" casseroles)!!! Like MOM2BREE, I too micro. my chx. (note: 2 breas yielded slightly more than 1.5 c.) for 10 min. in an 850 watt oven; mine were thawed already, however. I did find it necessary to make a few changes to suit my/our tastes. I used the full amt. of noodles (wide) called for as 1/2 was not nearly enough IMHO. I subbed 1 c. frozen peas/carrots for canned carrots, omitted the mushrooms (my fiance & I don't like them), added a full 1/4 c. chopped onion, 1 stalk celery & 3 cloves minced garlic (which I sauteed w/ the onion/celery).  Oh, and I mix. 1/4 c. plain breadcrumbs (would have used seasoned - I wanted to use up the rest of the plain ones in my pantry this time) w/ 1.5 T melted butter. The only prob. I had w/ this casserole was the sauce.... I would have liked a more creamy, less soupy/cheesy sauce. My fiance enjoyed Wanda's casserole b/c it was NOT creamy (he liked the cheesiness) - go figure lol!!! I might add a little sour cream next time though....  All in all, this is great comfort food, perfect for our Sun. eve. dinner. Served w/ dinner rolls, this made for a very filling meal! Thx. for sharing your idea, Wanda :)

this was really good and easy, but since I was in a hurry, I had to change it.  I used canned mixed veggies and canned shredded chicken.  I also added more noodles, (1 2/3 cups was not enough for my family.)

This was delicious, the whole family loved it.  We were out of mushrooms so I replaced one can of cream of chicken with a can of cream of mushroom. And I used fresh carrots (sauteed with the onions & celery)  It was an easy one dish meal.  We'll definitely be making this a favorite.

This was a pretty good dish! I used homestyle egg noodles(taste & look more like homemade), omitted the mushrooms, and used seasoned bread crumbs. I baked everything but the bread crumbs, until cheese was bubbly. Then added the bread crumbs, along with 1T melted butter. Baked until toasted. Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

It was a good use of leftover turkey, but a bit bland.  I used smushed up crackers on top, and that was really good - added an extra saltiness.

I made this last night for my picky nieces and they loved it. I did have to use more noodles (2 1/2 cups) and since the girls don't like mushrooms, I used peas instead. I also used crushed Ritz crackers on top. It was a good "comfort" meal. Thanks!

This is great with leftover turkey as you get nice big chunks of meat.  Kids love the
noodles and it is the ultimate sidekick fullmeal deal. I love the way you can change 
the number you have to cook for and it gives you the correct measurements.  Wonderful
recipe. Thanks , Heather from Castlegar, BC

I substituted peas for carrots, and added a 7 oz. can of mushrooms. Great recipe! Delicious and easy to make-

Very good, I left out the carrots because my husband doesn't like them, and this is a definite keeper. Very creamy and tasty.

Mmmmm, this recipe was great! The leftovers were even better. A very nice looking dish with veggies and a wonderful creamy sauce.  Will definitely make this again and again.
