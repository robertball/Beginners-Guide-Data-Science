I'm basing my review on this recipe as written. Hawaiian bread is already sweet. The sugar just adds to the sweetness which results in sweet cheese. I made half with the sugar and half without. Without the sugar this is easily a 4 star recipe. I served these on half rolls topped with the cheese. I will make these again without the sugar.
