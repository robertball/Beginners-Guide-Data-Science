I thought this recipe was very good but I should have listened to my intuition and reduced the amount of cumin seed it called for.  1 tablespoon of cumin seed is WAY TOO MUCH for the amount of rice indicated.  It totally overpowered the rice and muted all the other great flavours going on in the dish. I would definitely make this again but I will use about 1 teaspoon of cumin seed next time and probably add green peas to it, as a matter or preference.  I also used jasmine rice, so I did not soak it, but I washed it thoroughly until the water was clear and let in drain in a colander until the rice is relatively dry. I find this is essential in making rice dishes like this so the rice sautes better and doesnt taste bland or waterlogged.  I also reduced the cooking time slightly, since I was using a different type of rice and reduced the water to 2 cups, but kept the amount of rice used the same.

Great recipe.  out of necessity used 1/2 tsp. ground cumin, and 1/4 tsp. ground cardamom.  I make basmati rice all the time but never thought about browning it first.  This changes the flavor for the better!  Oh this was wonderful served with "Maharaja Curry" and it was a restaurant-quality meal.  I did add Saffron and frozen peas to the rice for color and substance.  Thanks for this nice recipe!

This is very good.  I was a little disappointed in the hieroglyphics I had to go through to figure out the "ground equivalents" of the spices.  So, thanks to the internet, here they are:
1 tsp cinnamon
1/8  tsp cardamom
1/2 tsp cloves
1 tsp cumin

I thought it could use a little more salt, too, maybe 1 1/2 tsp.
Othewise, a keeper!

I just finished preparing this recipe... it was tasty, but nothing spectacular - hence my 4 star rating.  I followed the directions for the most part - except I didn't bother soaking the rice - because in my experience, the rice is easier to toast if you skip the soaking step.  Also,  I doubled the recipe and used about 1/2 less cumin seeds, a few extra pods of cardamom and an extra clove or two.  I added a pinch of saffron too!  Note:  If you decide to use ground spices in place of the whole ones, be careful with how much you use - otherwise you won't get the right flavor.  Too much cinnamon can ruin the dish, and typically the cardamom is essential with Indian cooking.

This tasted very good, however I had to make some changes to it because I had to use white rice and substitute ground spices.  For the cinamon I used one teaspoon ground, and cardamon also suffered because I couldn't find pods.   So I used 2/3 of a teaspoon and the rice was great.  Extremely easy to make and flavorful.

I make indian food a lot and try to get what I make as close to restaurants that I've been to. I don't ever remember seeing their basic rice with cumin in it. It usually has ajwain seed (carrom) about 1/4 tsp. This gives it almost a slight menthol mouth watering affect. It looks like cumin but smaller. I'd also suggest 4-5 cardamom pods, 2 black cardamom pods (gives a subtle smokey flavor), and 6 cloves. Make sure to wash and scrub the rice beforehand with several changes of water until the water is clear to get all the starchy powders removed. Then soak in COLD water.

this was just what we needed for our indian food fix!  i spent some extra time sauteing the rice after it was soaked to toast it to a light golden color, it really brought out the rich flavor of the basmati.  i doubled the onions (personal preference) and threw in 1/2 cup frozen (but thawed) mixed vegetables for color and added texture.  served this with the indian tandoori chicken on this website.  it was fabulous!

This was very good.  I skipped the cardamom completely, used ground cinnamon instead of sticks, and used ground cumin instead of cumin seeds (but reduced the amount to 2 tsp).  I seemed to need a bit of extra oil when browning the rice so that it didn't stick.  The rice turned out to be tender and flavorful.

Delicious!  I used brown basmati so I had to cook it longer but it went sooooo well with the Dahl recipe and the Naan bread recipe.  Yummy!

I don't have all the whole spices, so I subbed 1/4t ground cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/8t ground cloves and 1t cumin.  I also prep it all in the skillet then dump into my rice cooker - I hate watching rice on the stove!!  Works great, even with brown basmati.  ALSO - try subbing some of the liquid for a can of coconut milk!!

Excellent taste and easy to prepare.  I've used this recipe several times.  One time I forgot to soak the rice ahead of time.  To save time, I rinsed the rice then microwaved it for about two minutes (removed as much water as possible).  It came out great.

It's a good recipe but very subtle flavor.  It's a good compliment to a stronger or more bold Indian dish.  As far as the cardamon pods, I always have a hard time finding them so instead I used 1/6 teaspoon cardamon powder for each pod required.  It seems to work well.

I this rice was delicate, tender and very fragrant.  I still can't believe how good it turned out.  I followed the recipe to a T.  However, I tranfered the browned rice mixture to my rice cooker for the final simmer period.  Excellent!

My husband is from New Delhi and when his mom visits she makes similar rice. However, she prepares the "masala" (onion spice mixture sauteed in the oil) and then dumps that into a rice cooker with the rice and water already in it. Press start and you are done - it all cooks up just fine and is delicious. Peas are a great addition, and carrots diced small. A little more salt may be needed depending on the amount of rice. I just rinse the rice in a colander until the water is clear-ish before putting in the rice maker.

This was delicious.  I did my best to follow the directions as is, though I had black cardamom pods- not green ones.  I used that and I substituted olive oil for regular vegetable oil.  

I noticed that when sauteeing the onion to prevent it from burning you can add spoonfuls of water to the pot.  It evaporates easily enough so as not to affect the recipe.  
I picked the spices out just before serving.  As directed the rice was not firm, but it wasn't mush either.  Letting it sit helped it dry out enough for the rice to keep its shape without giving the rice an unpleasant texture. 

As for flavor, I guess it depends on expectations.  The flavors are a bit subtle, though that is part of what makes this dish great.  It's not bland and can compliment several different flavor pairings in other dishes.  (The meal that I served it in involved lemon-pepper, butter, garlic, ginger, sriracha, soy sauce/ salt, hoisin, and almonds.)

BTW, even considering the serving size as at least a half cup, there is no way that the calories per serving is 51.  (using an external recipe calculator the calories per serving came out to 101, not 51.)Rice and other grains tend to be high in calories, so I have a hard time believing the posted nutrition information is reliable.

Perfect Basmati rice! It tastes just like the Indian restaurants, if not better. I made it exactly like the recipe and it came out perfect.

I love this rice!  I am awful at cooking rice and it usually ends up gummy and sticky, but this recipe produced rice like I'd buy in an Indian restaurant.  I added peas and skipped the cardamon pods, and it was still great!

I thought it was quite good.  I don't know that I will wash/soak rice next time.  I kinda like it sticky.  I thought the cinnamon was a little heavy but my dining companion thought both the cinammon and the cardemon were to subtle.  Either way, I liked it, I will make it again.  I served it on the side with the Ratatouile from this site.  Great combo.

I give the highest rating to this recipe because my rice came out amazing! However, I made some minor adjustments as follows: used 2 cups of BROWN basmati rice, which is more nutritious than white rice. Also, I soaked it overnight for 10 hours and added 3 cardamon pods & 3 whole cloves instead of 2 as indicated on this recipe. In place of vegetable oil, I used coconut oil and cooked everything for 50 minutes (since brown rice takes longer to prepare).

Others have knocked this for being under flavored. I disagree. It is not supposed to have TONS of flavor. It is an accompaniment to another dish. The flavors were subtle but delicious. I prepared this rice with the Tomato Curry Chicken recipe which is also found on allrecipes! They were great together, I recommend trying them.

I followed Tunisianswife review and used ground spices that I had on hand.  I had the cinnamon stick and cloves, though.  My husband loved the aroma of this rice cooking and enjoyed every bite.  I don't make this often but I should as it's very good.

Love this rice - I added saffron threads.  Served to guests at a dinner party and everyone loved it, including my picky 4 year old. NEW UPDATE - Just made this in my Instant Pot Electric Pressure Cooker and it was great. I sautéed the onions in ghee while the rice soaked, then added ground spices. After I drained the rice I sautéed it along with the spices until lightly toasted and mixed with spices. I added a tsp saffron and then turned pressure cooker on for 3 minutes. After that I let the steam naturally release for 10 minutes before opening the vent.  Fluffed with a fork and served. Perfectly cooked and delicious!

Use 1 tsp. caraway seeds instead of the cumin; this recipe calls for way too much cumin.  I'd also increase the cloves and cardamon to 4 each, and use broth instead of water for a richer flavor.  Chicken or vegetable works best.  Make sure the rice is rinsed several times before you soak it, then cooking time can be reduced to 10-11 mins.

Great Recipe!! I did add more cardamom pods(6). I also did not soak it bec I dont have a strainer with small enough holes. Had this with Navratan Korma, Naan and carrot curry soup. The rice was nice and fluffy, cooked perfect! Added some scallions and cilantro on top. Will Make again and again. Thank you.

I think ground cumin would have been much better for this recipe. I would also add 2 extra cardamoms. I will make this recipe again- but with my own twist- the recipe as is is lacking a little something.

This rice is even better than the rice in an Indian restaurant!  So easy and YUMMY!  Instead of cardamom pods (because I can't find any where I live) I use a dash of Allspice and that seems to do the trick.  Other than that I follow it to a "T"!

The flavor is great but I should have trusted my instinct and used less water. The rice was WAY TOO MOIST! I would suggest using only 2 cups of water.

this rice was really good and smelled amazing.  I'll add more cumin seeds next time or some nutmeg, because it wasn't very spicy.  Also I live in a city with a ton of good Indian restaurants, and I've noticed that sometimes golden raisins are added to the rice dishes (no idea how authentic it is).  I added some of the golden raisins to the onions before cooking the rice and it tasted great...added a bit of sweetness.

Made this rice tonight, and it was a big hit.  Served it with the  Slow Cooker Butter Chicken recipe from this site.  Made it as written.  Subtle flavor worked well with our meal.

A five-star "omigosh-is-this-ever-good." I substituted ginger and a touch of nutmeg (as suggested by them 'as knows) for cardomom, which I didn't have.  And because my cinnamon sticks are about eight years old, I used about 1/3 tsp. ground cinnamon instead. The rice is exotic and mouth-watering even when it's cold - and with broiled salmon steaks it was simply wonderful. Thank you.

Basmati Bliss!  Fluffy rice; subtle, balanced flavor from each of the spices for an excellent side dish for any cuisine.  Used tad less boiling water, due to the soaking; cooked for 20 minutes.  I will be using this recipe to create all kinds of flavors.  Thanks DHANO923!  Difinitely a keeper!

This has become a staple in my house. I make half the amount, as we are only two, but use the same proportions.  We love it with grilled or oven baked fish.

Yummy and so flavorful.  I add extra cardamon probably double the amount recipe calls for and use chicken broth for the liquid.  Keeper.

I am somewhat surprised about the warning not to eat the whole spices - well the green cardamom pods anyway.  When cooked with the basmati rice they become softer and swell up. The whole pod becomes chewy. It's an acquired taste perhaps but not unpleasant and they are known for  medicinal qualities as well as other health benefits such as an aid in digestion.  I actually look for them in the rice.  However I do draw the line at whole cloves and cinnamon  sticks. Thanks.

Excellent results! I did not have whole spices so I used powdered. I used 1 tsp each of the Cardamon, cloves and Cinnamon. I also did not soak my rice - I just added it to the oil with the onion and sauted it until it was golden. Excellent served with Naan and Chicken Tikka!! Thanks for the delicious recipe!!

I'm ashamed to admit that this was my first attempt at cooking Basmati. It smelled soooo good when it was cooking. It was wonderful. I made this with Butter Chicken. A first also. My husband came home asking what smelled so great. Thank You. It made me look and feel like a real cook!

This was fantastic - it tastes just like my favorite local restaurant's basmati rice.  I did not toast the rice enough on my first batch and it was a bit sticky, so I am careful to get a nice toasting on the rice before adding the water.

I'm an Indian and I've eaten a lot of varieties of rice. Usually my mum cooks, but it was my first time cooking and I decided to make this recipe. I'm sorry to say but I've eaten much better things, and it simply didn't suit my taste.  I'm sorry.. :(

A big thank you to another review for breaking down the whole spices to ground spices.  This was very yummy.  I made this with the chicken tikki masala by Yakuta.  Great pairing.  Cant wait to make them again!

This is far too much water- typically the proportion is 1 1/3 to 1 for dry rice, 1 to 1 for soaked, though these can be adjusted somewhat. The cumin is also way out of proportion.

Dang! I didn't have the cumin seed but didn't want to use 1T ground either. The spice flavors were very mild so maybe my cinnamon and cardamom need to be replaced. Will make it again but I'll make sure I have all the ingredients as well as fresh spices in my cupboard.

The flavour was great but the rice was seriously overcooked, it was way too much water and it turned out mushy.  I rinsed the rice several times and soaked it but I think it was too much water after soaking for 20 minutes.

This is really delicious! I have used brown basmati rice and it came out great. With brown rice I had to simmer it for 20 more minutes.

I also added a handful of frozen peas, and chopped parsley. 

Fantastic!

On the suggestion of another reviewer, I halved the cumin seeds and out of necessity had to use ground cloves. It turned out perfectly and I served the rice with the chicken tikka masala and naan recipes from this site. Very easy and very tasty- I'll definitely use this again.

Yummy! I did only use 1 tsp of cumin since I am not such a huge fan of the taste and the rice came out perfect! Went very well with the butter chicken that I made.

I've seen so many different versions, with the water:rice ratio all being slightly different. Anyways...it's a decent recipe.  I had made basmati rice from a different recipe and it was a lot more flavourful, but I can't figure out what was missing. I think it also had some peas in it. But I'll be using this recipe until I come across that exact method again.

This rice smelled AMAZING while it was cooking (it also tasted great with a tikka masala dish). Like other people, I didn't have cardamom pods, so i used it ground and it still turned out great.

Made this tonight, was excellent- a kind of subtle flavour, comes across just like you might expect in a restaurant.

This rice was great!  Be careful when you are saute the onions... if you wait until they are golden, then try to toast the rice, you end up with onions that are near black.  Add the rice a little earlier, so it's all done at the same time.

Try adding golden raisens and cashews to this recipee.  Add them to the pan once the onions are golden brown.  Cook until the raisins 'puf' then remove from heat and place on papertowel (to absorbe the oil0.  It brings the dish to the next level.

Just like my mom used to make - thanks! I'm only giving it 4 stars since a tablespoon of cumin would have been waaaay too much - I used 1 tsp, but will probably increase it to 1 1/2 next time. Also, I may have used a medium onion, but there were way too many onions - I'll probably use 1/2 of a medium one next time.

Tasty, simple, and fluffy.  I used 1/4 of an average size onion.  I think I'll add some frozen peas next time.

I made this for the first time for company.  It was fairly simple, just had to keep checking the recipe.  They all LOVED it and my 4 kids did as well...I believe this is how we'll be making rice in the future!!

This had a very good flavor. I couldn't find basmati rice in my grocery store so I just used white rice and it still turned out delicious! I can't wait to try it with the basmati.

I'm not usually  a rice fan, but this was very tasty.  I made it exactly the way the recipe was written and I will make it again.  I am actually going to use the same spices on cauliflower rice, I think that would be really good.  My husband who is a rice fan put this on at the top of his list to make again.  Thanks

This rice turned out to be really delicious. I only made one small change, I used ghee in place of the oil. This turned out to be so good that even my pickiest eater loved it. I will definitely make this again, and again, and again.

Great, great recipe thank you. My son made it as is the first time- great rice. To the second batch of rice he made he added 1 1/2 tsp each of tumeric, cumin, & powered coriander. This recipe is definitely restaurant quality. Excellent.

Great aromatics, this rice was the best basmati rice I've ever made that tasted authentic.  I did add about a tablespoon of Ghee (clarified butter) at the end at the recommendation of an Indian friend.  It was delicious!

This was delicious! I made a few changes; substituted shallots for the onion, added a couple extra cardamom pods + cloves, and used about half the amount of cumin that the recipe calls for. I also substituted half of the water with some homemade stock that I had on hand. Loved it! Next time I'm going to try adding some saffron.

I made this for thanksgiving and boy did it smell nice! I must say beyond the scent, this is still plain rice that needs a sauce to go with it. Make sure to find a nice sauce (maybe with lamb) to accompany this rice!

I make this as the standard side to a chicken curry I make. It's really good and even my 4 yo son likes it. It could use "something" to give it a bit of pizzazz on its own, I just don't know what.

Made per recipe but with 1/2 tsp cumin on first run and the flavor was pretty subdued.  Will likely try with a bit more herbs next time.

Nothing else to say but fantastic.  It even impressed the Indians at work.  Also, people comment on the excessive cumin but keep in mind it says cumin seed, not ground cumin.  Use a  tsp of ground cumin if that is what you have.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I am sure I did something wrong and maybe someone could help me because I love Basmati rice. Let me just say that it smelled amazing but when the rice was all cooked it still just tasted like plain rice. Someone help because I want to make good basmati rice. Peace

Really great flavor, but the texture wasn't what I expected. I will definitely try again but will experiment with the cooking time and/or amount of water.

**mad applause** this is easily as good as the rice at our local Indian restaurant. I drove miles and miles today looking for cardamom, and couldn't find it for less than $10 pre-ground. I subbed a teeny pinch of nutmeg, ginger, and a few whole Jamaican allspice instead. No idea if that's anywhere close to the real cardamom flavor, but this rice is crazy good, and my picky kids agree.

Loved it!!  I only used one teaspoon of cumin seed and it tasted perfect.  This paired very well with the Easy Indian Butter Chicken recipe on this site.

Delicious.  It tastes so authentic and is so easy to make.  I was out of clove so I used all spice seeds and it worked well.  I will definitely be making this a lot!  I agree with another reviewer, cook the onions on low for ten minutes to get the rich color and taste.  Then add the rice for one minute or so and then add the broth.  I used chicken broth and did add a cup of frozen peas in a minute before ready to eat.

Tastes just like my local Indian restaurant!  I never substitute ground spices for the whole ones. After making this a few times I switched to using Jasmine rice, skip the soaking, and change the amounts to 2 cups jasmine rice and 2 cups liquid (I substitute chicken broth if I have it on hand).  Wonderful flavor!  At the end I throw in a handful of frozen peas.  It only takes a minute to steam them then stir them in. Very easy to make!

This is one of the better Basmati Rice Recipes I've made.  The only adjustment I made was to add 3 cups of water instead of the 2 1/2.  Next time, I'm going to use chicken broth just to see if it adds a different flavor.

Tasted good but not as good as I'd expected. I think it needs more flavor, more oil, or more something. Possibly a good base that I'll experiment with.

This rice was fantastic.  We started it up then went on to cook an Indian dish while it was going.  The timing was great and the rice was an awesome compliment to the chicken dish we made.  Just like a restaurant, and the rice smell filling up the kitchen was great!  One thing we added was a handful of yellow raisins from the Indian store.  They added just the right amount of additional surprising bites of sweetness.  Mmm!

I toasted the spices before I tossed them in my mortar and pestle. Then I sauteed the onion in a little butter (no ghee), and toasted the rice with the butter and onion mixture. This has the effect of making the rice more flavorful, as well as allowing it to absorb liquid faster. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe. This was very good!

This is a good recipe.  However, you can make a few changes to imrove it.  If you wish to serve the rice looking white instead of brown, don't allow the onions to colour - cook them till they are just about to turn golden.  Also, if you use ghee instead of oil, the aroma will be absolutely heavenly!  Add a few bay leaves too. 
You can turn this into a vegetable pulao by adding diced carrots, beans, peas, cauliflower and potato; and increasing the water content slightly.  A great way to make children eat their veggies!

this was a very fragrant and flavorful rice. i didnt use the whole cloves or cinnamon stick, just substituted ground. but i did use the cardamom pods. dont use too much if you decide to use ground spices. it came out great and went perfectly with the navrattan korma from this site.

Since I am usually heavy-handed with my spices, I always double the amount of spices called for in  recipes.  I did the same for this one, and it was fantastic.  People commented that it was very "authentic" and flavorful.

This is an excellent recipe and makes for wonderfully fragrant and fluffy rice just like in an Indian restaurant. I cooked my rice in a rice cooker (after sauteeing everything in a pan) instead of stovetop, and it comes out great that way too. I plan on using this recipe as my basic Indian rice from now on.

I went exactly by the recipe and thought it was very, very bland!  Although, I'm sure it would make a good accompaniment to any curry or dal dish.  This is only taking into consideration the flavor and sauce of the curry or dal is mixed in with the rice.  Not the worst, but definitely not the best.  If anyone has a good basmati rice recipe out there, please post!

Excellent side dish! I didn't have the whole spices on hand, so I substituted with garam masala.  I also added baby peas at the very end to give further texture and flavor. Highly recommended..

This recipe turned out really well. I only had ground cumin so I used that, but I managed to find the whole cardamom pods the recipe called for. I had the rest of the whole spices on hand. This smelled wonderful while cooking and it turned out great. I served it as a side to Indian Butter Chicken, also found on this site. I had leftovers at work the next day and my coworkers said my lunch smelled amazing. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is exceptional. Admittedly I did not have everything on hand, so I subbed a bit of cumin for the cumin seed and some Garam Marsala for the cardamom.

I served this with the slow cooker butter chicken. The rice was very good but it wasn’t as flavorful as thought it would be.

I added ground turkey and green peas to make it a meal then ate with naan and Tzatziki Sauce and that made it perfection.

It was pretty good. I learned to cook Indian food in London by  Indian friends. This is pretty close to how I learned to make it.

I've cooked this probably 10-15 times since finding this recipe. So far, it's my go-to Indian rice recipe. I screwed up rice for a long time before I finally found this recipe.

 I add a couple cloves of minced garlic with the cumin seed, the flavor is not remarkably different, but great either way. I use way more oil than is called for. I don't measure it, I pour a couple tablespoons before adding spices, then a little more with the onions if they don't seem to be wet and slippery looking. I probably use closer to 4 Tablespoons total (I am NOT a low-fat chef) I cook everything in a big stainless pot with a super-thick (like 1") base. The oil keeps anything from sticking to the pot, and keeps the grains separate when done. When toasting the rice before adding the water, I cook and stir until I can hear that the water clinging to the rice has basically cooked off.

As soon as it reaches a boil, I set the timer for 15 min, turn the heat as far down as it goes, and cover. When the timer goes off, I immediately invert into a big mixing bowl and fluff then let stand. I found that letting it stand in the pot just overcooks the bottom, probably because of my heavy base.

Fried in a wok the following day, this rice is even better which is saying a lot. Spectacular. Never found anyone that didn't love it. I am not ethnically Indian however.

I did this with jasmine rice and the flavor is good, but it's super sticky. Basmati is far better.

First time making this, and could not have been happier.  We were initially hesitant to add the onion, but so glad we did.  This was 'Print and save' worthy...as we will definitely be making it often.

We used basmati brown rice and doubled the recipe. I like my foods bold in flavor so I added more cloves and cardamom.  I also added diced bits of dried apricot and whole golden raisins. I used a sweet onion. (In retrospect I would have added one more cinnamon stick.   We loved the finished dish and we would have enjoyed the original more mild version too.   the recipe, I had to add a half hour to the cooking time. My sister absolutely loved it and took home  the leftovers.

This is delicious! I used brown basmatti rice so I soaked the rice about an hour and cooked it 20 minutes. I added 1 teaspoon of grated fresh ginger and I clove of garlic. I used 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 4 cardamom pods. I used only 1 teaspoon cumin seed. I used low sodium chicken broth and did not add any salt. This recipe is a keeper and I will make it again and again.

Next time I'll add a little more of the spices on onion for a little stronger flavour. But other then that really enjoyed the texture of the rice compared to the rice cooker.

This is my absolute go-to every time Indian is on the menu for the evening. It’s perfect! I’ve never heard a complaint! The recipe also is a good base for southwestern-style cilantro lime rice. Simply omit all the spices, add some finely minced garlic to the onions and keep the status quo from there. When the rice is done, add 1/3-1/2 bunch chopped cilantro and the juice of 1 1/2 limes. Delicious.

I loved this rice. Trader Joe's has some nice dal in a can that you can eat with this rice. I probably only added 1/2 of the cumin that the recipe called for but that's my personal taste.

Didn't have whole cumin or cardamon seeds, so I used powdered.  I could have used more, as it turned out, but the rice was wonderfully fragrant, even so.  I would try it again, and increase the spices or get the whole seeds.

So simple, easy, and good. Doubled the cardamom pods and cloves, halved the cumin seeds. Going to make this instead of plain rice whenever I serve Indian-style meals. (I sometimes use jarred simmer sauces for family weekday dinners, and this rice will enhance those meals quite a bit)..

This rice was really good! Excellent flavor, and pretty easy to put together :) I did substitute ground nutmeg in for the cardamom pods, but otherwise I think I followed the recipe pretty religiously. Served it under Chicken Tikka Masala, but did eat it by itself too, to make sure we liked it, and it was really good both ways. Family enjoyed it, will definitely make it again in the future.

I really liked this. I make rice way more than pasta or potatoes, so I'm always looking for new ideas on preparation. I used janatbellu's "translation" of whole to ground spices, otherwise I made it as written. The rice grains stayed separate and not gluey. But, I think it tastes even better the next day! 
I did add some veggies at the last few minutes: defrosted baby peas and white and gold corn, and bits of broccoli, and cooked some minced fresh carrots in with the rice. Served it with spicy, sauteed shrimp. Yum! Complete meal!

I used ground cumin and no the seeds as I didnt have any on hand. The flavour was good but the rice didnt come out as fluffy as I hopped. I will probably attempt to try this recipe again but soak it longer and add more oil so the rice does not stick to each other.

If you're like me, and mess up rice every time, then this is the recipe for you! I absolutely love it!!!!! However, I did make a few changes. First, I used Basmati Rice, instead of brown, and used 1/8 teaspoon of regular cumin, rather than the seeds. I also added a bay leaf in with the spices and used 2 cinnamon sticks instead of one. Lastly, after toasting the rice, I poured it into a rice cooker with about 3/4 a cup of water. Cooked for about 16 minutes, fluffed, and let it set for 5 more minutes. Without a doubt, this is best rice I've ever made!

This is a great basic recipe. I took the advice to reduce the cumin to a tea. I cooked the onions until they burnt a little which ads a nice touch. I used maybe less than a 1/4 t ground spices instead of the whole seeds of cardamom and clove. I don't know what soaking the rice did except definitely made it un-toastable. It instantly sticks to the pan. Very nice way to make rice extra special to serve with lentil soup or something else.

I love this recipe. I have made it several times. I have never been able to make rice that was this fluffy before. The KEY is to toast the spices and rice with the oil. It makes all the difference!

WOW as good as any Indian restaurant. So important to soak the rice. I also reduced the cumin, as others have said, and  I also added a few cardamoms just because I love them.  It came out perfectly and even my husband who is a chef said 'well done' but I'll praise the author of the recipe.

I made this to go along with my chicken tikka masala and was impressed with the results. I have made basmati based from the recipe found on the side of the rice package with less than stellar results. This recipe resulted in a side very similar to the rice at the restaurants. I did take the advise of several reviewers and cut down on the cumin to 1/2 teaspoon. I cut the onions razor thin and fried in ghee instead of oil (maybe too powerful of a butter flavor). Next time I will try veg oil to see the difference. Definitely a recipe that is going in my book. Thanks!

This rice was delicious!  

i couldn't find the cardamom pods, and look forward to ordering some to try this recipe again.

With the cloves, cinnamon, and cumin as listed though, the flavors were delicious.  

Not a subtle flavor, but not overly powerful, and it balanced really well with a spicy chicken tikka masala.

Super flavorful rice and my house smells great too lol. However I did need to add a lot more salt than it originally called for. Also I've made this 3 times exactly to the recipe but the rice is always crunchy. I've had to tweak the proportions of liquid to rice to have a come outwits the perfect texture.

This is an amazing rice recipe that yielded probably the best rice I've ever had. I did make some tweaks to it to get it "just right": 1/4 tsp cumin instead of 1 tbsp; more cardamom pods (5) and whole cloves (4); 3 tbsp oil instead of 2;  added 1/4 tsp saffron in 2 tbsp hot water -- saffron made a huge difference. Also cooked for 14 mins instead of 15 and let it sit covered for 10 mins after. All that said, this recipe gave me the baseline for an incredible plate of rice!  Next time I might add more onion, because the golden onions were fantastic and I would like more of them in this dish. I plan to use this recipe often in the future.

I was disappointed with this recipe. In the end it turned out ok because I added all sorts of other spices and flavors because I just found it lacking. The rice also got a little mushy, I think it's because I used jasmine rather than basmati rice.

After reading all of the previous reviews, I decided to change it up and use 1.5 heaping teaspoon of cumin seed, 3 cardamom seeds, and use the rice cooker after browning the rice. My rice cooker is a 3 cup cooker and I know that 1.5 cups of pre-soaked rice needs enough water to cover the rice by about a 1/4 inch. Came out a little too cinnamon for my taste. Maybe a half stick next time, otherwise very good. Surprisingly better the next day when the spices settled and weren't so sparky.

This is a great Indian rice recipe. It tastes like what my Indian neighbor makes. However, she adds fresh ginger to hers, so I did too. Maybe about one and a half or two teaspoons of minced fresh ginger.

I like this rice a lot but feel it needs double the spice.  Also, feel like it is missing some moisture or creaminess so next time I make it I will try adding a bit of tomato paste, butter or oil at the end of the cooking time.  This does go very well with the kafta kabobs, naan, minty raita, and some fresh onions as an Indian-style taco.  Delicious!

Simple to make rice for a complimentary side to any main course. I served this with some daal and chicken makhani. I added some extra water at the last five minutes about a forth cup.

I agree with the most helpful positive review (Me) that the cumin seed amount should be reduced to 1 teaspoon.  With this change, the result is great.

I have never made Basmati rice before and I'm happy to say this turned out delicious.  Flavorful and moist. Rinsed the rice instead of soaking and didn't use cardamom as the 1 store I went to didn't carry that spice. Would like to try it with it next time. Thank you for the recipe

Great recipe as written. Have made this a few times now and only added a few cloves to it. I recommend whole spices if you can get them- we have a few good Indian/Pakistani groceries nearby. Husband would eat this every day if he could!

Delicious! I had never used cumin seeds in rice before, and was concerned they would be annoying to chew with the rice, boy - was I wrong! Will definitely make this again. I did everything as directed, but added an extra pod of cardamom, a couple of cloves, and a small pinch of saffron. Superb recipe.

This was exactly what I was looking for, thank you!  I made this for a dinner party and followed the recipe earlier in the day up until the adding water part.  It kept beautifully and was a easy finish once the guests arrived.  I also used about 1/2 ground cinnamon instead of the stick and added an extra bit of ground cumin as I wasn't sure how fresh my cumin seeds were.  Fabulous.  I will make again!

This was a very good side dish to the Chicken Makhani on this site. I will say that one of my family members said it had a bit too much cinnamon. I used long grain rice instead of basmati rice because that is what I had on hand. I rinsed out the rice 3x with warm water and then let it soak while cutting the onion and veggies for my main dish. I also transfered the rice to my rice cooker for the final simmering stage as noted by another user. I used two cups of rice and 3 1/2 cups of water so it wouldn't turn out sticky. It came out very good in the end. This recipe is for refined palates, not so good with little ones.

I didn't use the cardamom and replaced jasmine rice for the basmati, so that may have affected the flavor a bit, but it was almost as good as authentic basmati rice.

This fragrant, delicious recipe was a hit served with the tandoori chicken thigh recipe from this site.  I didn't have cardamom, had to use some ground spices instead of whole, and added curry leaf and golden raisins. We added this recipe to our family favorites.

This really made the house smell good and went well with the Butter Chickpea Curry from this site.  However, I'm not sure it was worth all the extra effort.  Maybe for a really special meal.

I left out the cloves (didn't have any) and used a large shallot for my 'onion'.  I followed the directions exactly except that after frying the rice for a couple of minutes, I threw it into my rice cooker with only 2 cups of water and let it finish that way.  Served with Chicken Tandoori, this was great!  Nice subtle flavor that doesn't detract from the tandoori.  (It compliments!)

Having read the reviews, I reduced the amount of cumin seed in this recipe to 1 teaspoon.  I needed to add more water as it cooked, but I often have that issue with my cooktop.  I will probably add a little extra cinnamon next time, just as a matter of personal preference.  We had this with mulligatawny soup, and it was an excellent combination.

The smell of this rice is great and just tastes really authentic like the indian restaurant I go to. I didn't have basmati rice so I used white, but I'm sure you could use brown or another type of rice.

This rice was delicious. This is the second recipe I have tried from this person. I served this to some friends with chicken curry, and aloo gobi. (cauliflower with potato) One person asked how to make this because he liked it so much. The spices are not over powering so it went well with the curry. I think the person who said it was bland is not familiar with how to eat indian food and tried to eat this plain. Indian rice is supposed to be mixed with other dishes, not eaten on it's own. I will make this again soon.
