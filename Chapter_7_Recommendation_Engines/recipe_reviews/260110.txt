Great recipe. First time I made it, it turned out perfect. Second time I made it, I used too much panko crumbs and they fell down into the onion mixture. When making this, you should try to keep the panko on top of the mayo/sour cream mixture, otherwise the panko forms a mushy mixture around the edges of the fish.

I didn't make any changes.  I did it once with skin on and once with skin off.  I prefer it with skin off, especially because the white side of the fish tends to blend in with the cream sauce.  I'll certainly make it again.

Love this recipie.  I tried it with Duke's mayo and it didn't work out well - tried it with Hellmans and it was great!
