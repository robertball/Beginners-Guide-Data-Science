These were great! I made 1 batch to see what they'd be like and about a half an hour later my Grandemother asked me to make more! My Grandma is notoriously picky so when she asked for more I knew they were a hit! Thanks!

These are pretty good! I added some nutmeg, a splash of vanilla and a pinch of salt. Nice flavor. It could have been a wee bit sweeter perhaps? One of those feelings that something is missing. Not sure, but they are pretty good the way they are.

It turned out perfect! I love the "melt-in-your-mouth" texture and my colleagues thought I bought them from stores. Agree with the other reviewer that its not really spiced though, can consider adding more spice to it. I added All Spice and a little bit of cinnamon and it tastes great!

This was sooo yummy, both my 6 year old and myself couldn't keep hands off. A couple of things... first, when I mixed it up, I thought it was a bad recipe because it was dry and crumbly for me, no way I could roll this out, but then I pressed it in a round pan and it baked up beautifully and it was so yum. Make sure and bake it long enough, it tastes better to me a bit crunchy even though I am a lover of soft cookies. This serving size is a little bit ridiculous. 16 slices of this and a mouse would enjoy one slice. ha ha. So, plan on eating 2 skinny slices at once! I will try whole wheat flour next time.

Just made these and they taste delicious!  The dough was sturdy enough too for cutting into shapes which was nice and after baking they were not crumbly like so many shortbread recipes.  Didn't make much though so may be a good one to double.

I added 1/4 tsp each of ground cloves and fresh-ground nutmeg (I like spices!  :); it tasted good, but the cookies came out very dry and more crumbly than I think shortbread should be.

It tastes great. I just have a question, do we have to melt the butter before mixing it into the dough?  I just had a hard time getting the dough to be smooth enough to be rolled out with a rolling pin without crumbling.  Thanks!

I first time I made these I was a bit disappointed but I was determined to try them again and change them a bit. Instead of cinnamon I added nutmeg and 1/4 cup finely chopped pecans. I also used self-rising flour (by accident) and liked how they turned out. I like nutmeg better than cinnamon and with the pecans it was all a perfect match.

These were good, but I think they need an icing drizzle or something.  Just an extra sweetness....very tender though.

I added an extra tablespoon of sugar and it tasted great! It's not too sweet so maybe a little bit of powdered sugar on top would be nice. Overall, it had a nice consistency and everyone  loved them.

I thought it was a good start to some great shortbread. Changed up the spices as recommended by others. Used  nutmeg and allspice. I pressed it into an 8 x 8 pan so dropped the cooking time five minutes and it turned out great. Not to crumbly at all. Will play with again.

It would not hold together and it was more of the texture of flour then anything I could squeeze into a ball and then knead. I ended up having to add an egg just to get the dough out of the mixing bowl! I made some, and they were utterly tasteless.

I have never made shortbread or ever had from scratch shortbread so i have nothing to compare it to, but these were pretty good.  i added an extra TBS br. sugar and added a bit more cinnamon.  I wish i had cut mine out with a cutter because the wedges are so dull and they broke easily.  Also i had trouble knowing when they were done.

Delicious! I used white whole wheat flour and vegan margarine. Came out great.
