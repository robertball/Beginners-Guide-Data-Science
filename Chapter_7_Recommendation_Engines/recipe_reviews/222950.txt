Very good stuff, but very VERY much too spicy, so i swapped the ghosts with fresh habaneros. Would've gave 5*, but this is missing some of the ingredients found in some top rated curry dish recipes, which could gave this better taste. I don't know if it matters much tho because when you do this with ghost chili peppers you won't be tasting anything other much but only fire and brimstone!
