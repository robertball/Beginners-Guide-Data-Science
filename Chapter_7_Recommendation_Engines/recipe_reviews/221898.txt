This is definitely a special occasion meal.  Having to buy a specialty bottle of wine to make the sauce is worth it, but hard on the budget for a weekday meal.  I increased the recipe to 6 and had to use two pans, a bummer.  This also seemed to increase the "carmelization" time of everything.  The recipe took much longer than expected, but it came out perfect.  Next time I will invest in higher end cuts of meat (I did not use tenderloin) and the texture will be perfect too!

This was so delicious! The local grocery store didn't have beef tenderloin so I made with pork loin instead. The pan sauce is super easy and tastes like a 5 star restaurant sauce. Made for Mother's Day and mom loved it!

Made this exactly as directed (great video, btw),  except... I *forgot* to throw in the fresh oregano at the end - darn it.  I wasn't sure I would like the tomato sauce in this but it came out delicious!  I'll definitely be making this again, including for company.  Thanks for sharing this recipe - YUM.

Delicious! If you follow this to a T it will turn out amazing. I'm not sure how there are so many reviews sayin it's salty, the only amount of salt suggested is a pinch, if you've got a heavy hand the saltiness is your own doing! Additionally If you slim down on the butter for caramelizing and finishing the sauce it still tastes decadent, I've got non stick pans so fats are mainly for taste. Enjoy!

Amazing! Somehow, I completely missed the line reading tomato sauce, until I started cooking. By then it was too late. We omitted the tomato sauce and the butter at the end, and it still turned out REALLY tasty. Can't wait to try it WITH the tomato sauce. I hope it is as good as it is without it! Thank you so much for an amazing recipe!

Excellent recipe....very "gourmet" tasting. To the reviewers who said it was too salty, this means you reduced the sauce too much. I learned the hard way in another recipe. Reducing it enough to reducing it too much can be tricky sometimes. We will definitely make this again!

Had two beautiful 10oz Omaha Filet Mignon which I cut in half and bashed to about 1/2 inch thickness. Followed the recipes exactly. Could not have been a better New Years Day dinner!

I made this dish last night.  The best way to describe it is OMG!!!
It was delicious.  I used beef tenderloin.  It was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  The sauce was soooo good!  The recipe took longer than what I had anticipated.  I didn't have fresh oregano so I used about 1/2 teaspoon of dried. Served it with 3 cheese potatoes au gratin. This is definitely a keeper.

This was a perfect anniversary dinner!! It's a classy entree that's incredibly easy to make. I served Asparagus Cashew Rice and Parmesan Tomatoes (both recipes from here) with it. It all turned out so beautiful. Made 15 years seem not so long. :D

This is an outstanding recipe, and it works with Marsala as well as a good cabernet (ie:  Powdered Keg).  I have prepared this recipe several times, each scenario with grass-fed beef, and with incredible success.  Why go to a steakhouse when you can have something of this caliber so easily made in your own kitchen.  My husband does not typically like mushrooms, yet he has repeatedly told me that this dish is "outstanding!"

I love the combination of flavors in this recipe. At first I was concerned how the tomato would pair, but I was not disappointed! I have subsequently made this for guests, who have also raved about this dish and asked for the recipe.

We did not care at all for the tomato sauce-marsala combination.  I wish I had tested out the sauce before I committed expensive beef tenderloin to it.

Yes, beef tenderloin is the same thing as fillet of beef.  Am definitely going to make this recipe as soon as I have a hood over my stove - smoke alarm goes off with high heat searing! (or when it's not so cold outside that I can BBQ them)

Delicious.  I am reviewing the pan sauce only, tonight was beautiful and we grilled the steaks outside.  If you like an italian beef with gravy, or are a fan of bracioli, you will like this recipe.  Made exactly as written with exception of no pan drippings.  This will be a great "dead of winter" recipe!  A definite do-over for me. Thanks for sharing, CJ.

We made this as is except we substituted a pork tenderloin.  It was good, but not great.  It was missing a little something.  Perhaps garlic?  Or, possibly, the lean pork somehow reduced the flavor.  We will make it again, but add some garlic and/or use beef.

Great dish. I didn't have Marsala so subbed Cabernet Sauvignon and thought I had tomato sauce but didn't so used a lesser amount of BBQ sauce. End result was yummy. And it was so easy. Would def. make again & would make for family dinner or special occasion.

This is probabaly the closest I have come to making steak as good as a steak house. It was easy and you can keep the wine for another dish, as it is called for frequently in sauces.  Beef tenderloin is expensive, and I found with everything else  served one tenderloin was enough.  I made Chef John's classic rice pilaf with this and becaase that recipie is very easy, this fabulous meal was much less work than you would think.Watching the videos helps too!

I made this recipe with a filet mignon steak, which I cut  in half and then in thirds.  I didn't have mushrooms, so I used onions instead.    Threw a little garlic in also.  This meal was AMAZING.  My husband said it was "restaurant quality"  Not difficult to make.

Easy to do, if you have the stuff at hand, under an hour. In Southern Chester County we always have mushrooms. The old timers use the browns (now called Crimini) because the have a better flavor.

Wow! I made this last night and it was amazing. I used beef tenderloin, but I think it would be great with pork tenderloin as well.  I followed the recipe except for the marsala wine. I used a cabernet instead, because that's what I was drinking while I cooked. I was out of tomato sauce, so I used 1/2 cup of tomato basil spaghetti sauce. I pureed it in my mini food processor, because it was a little chunky. I added a tablespoon of worcestershire for depth. It turned out beautifully! I will definitely make this again.

This was excellent. I made no changes and will for sure make this one again. I already have more tenderloin waiting in the freezer. Wonderful!

It had a taste of too much tomato and not enough Marsala. I would not make this recipe again.

I LOVE this recipe!!  It was so good, even my pickiest kid loved it.   I made a few changes, only because I didn't quite have everything in my pantry.  I used red cooking wine because I didn't want to make a run to the liquor store for only 1/2 cup of wine I wouldn't use again.  And I used salted butter because I didn't want to buy a lb of unsalted butter just for this recipe,  I did omit the salt in the recipe to compensate.  I also added  just a bit of heavy cream at the end with the butter and oregano and it was awesome.  It just gave it a nice creaminess to the sauce.   I will definitely be making this again and again!

Made this for dinner last night and there was just a little bit of sauce left. I served it up with my own version of garlic and green onion mashed potatoes. I attempted to follow this up with Chef John's Chocolate decadence with raspberry sauce (which got modified a little). No one else wanted desert, so I had to forego as well. I think this would pair very well with a sweet red wine. I was considering Yellow Tail Sweet Red Roo (or something like that).

Very good. The store had these precut/packaged tenderloins (individual) with bacon wrapped around it, so I got three, otherwise made recipe as is...the boys loved it.

OVER THE TOP!  I made this for a Valentine's Progressive dinner for 16 and it came out absolutely perfectly.  I received rave reviews.  I did decrease the salt whenever I could after reading a couple of the reviews.  Due to the number I was serving, I first off made the sauce in two batches--doubling the recipe to serve 16 before I seared the meat.  About three hours before guests arrived, I went ahead and browned the meat, then simmered the beef in the broth mixture--- cooking it to medium rare.  I found it took about 5 minutes per batch, so I did it four times.  I then refrigerated the meat in an enclosed Dutch oven pot. I used the "warming" setting on my oven and put the pot in the oven for an hour at 155 degrees while we went to the appetizer house.  Came home and heated the broth gravy, then served the meat and sauce on individual plates!  We couldn't have been more pleased.  This had to be the most difficult way to prepare this fabulous entree to serve 16, but next time serving four will be a "piece of cake."  Patty

Delish sauce!! I doubled the portions so it took me longer to prepare the sauce than the recipe states, but worth the time. Saved to my repertoire! Thank you Chef John

I don't know what I did wrong.  Mine didn't look like Chef John's.  I won't rate this because I think I deserve all of the blame.  It wasn't a failure, just a lot of work for beef tenderloins, which we have all the time.  Chef John is the best...his recipes are reliable, all of the time, which is why I think I fouled this one up!  Since this website demands that I rate the recipe in order to post, I will.

I loved this,  and it was much easier than I thought.  Found the video after the fact, and wished I had seen it before.  I found it when I searched "beef tenderloin"

I've tried it. But what side dish would be the best?
