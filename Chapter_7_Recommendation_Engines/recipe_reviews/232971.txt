I make this often and for groups as large as 30.  A few tips, use applesauce in place of butter and egg whites in place of whole to reduce fat.  I also add diced granny smith along with the cranberries and sometimes add pecans.  Go either/or on the brown sugar/maple syrup, can make it too sweet.  One final thing, serve with fat free greek vanilla yogurt..THE BOMB!

The family pronounced it delicious, so this recipe is a keeper. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. I love the addition of the maple syrup! You really have to get all natural maple syrup that actually came from the tree. Makes a world of difference. I added wheat germ to get some nutrients in there. :) Nobody notices. (Don't you love being sneaky?) Anyway, thanks for this recipe!  It's a delightful way to start your day.

Instead of cranberries, I used raisins. I also increased the amount to a heaping half cup as we REALLY like raisins. This is seriously decadent--like eating dessert for breakfast. EXTREMELY rich. I poured a touch of cold milk over the top of each serving which cut the sweetness a bit. We absolutely LOVED this. NO leftovers.

Alright: I have made several baked oatmeals from Allrecipes and up until this one, the one with blueberries was a hit in our home.  We just had this for breakfast this morning. I made it with a few common changes in baking: replaced half the butter with applesauce.  Lowered the brown sugar to about 1/2 cup, maybe a little less (did not measure).  I added an apple and some chopped pecans as someone suggested.  I stuck WITH the maple syrup and sued Canadian because well, it is a healthy edulcorant imo. When I mixed it all, it was a bit of a dry-looking mix, so I added one egg, which I had use in other oatmeal recipes.  What is outstanding about this is the flavor.  With the nuts, maple and cranberries, it is just... old school.  Barely sweet, nutty, cinnamoney, and yummy.  Hats off, joshllorio :)

This is a very nice oatmeal prep. My husband described it as an oatmeal cookie in a bowl with milk :) The next time I would cut the sugar and salt in half but otherwise very tasty and an easy make ahead breakfast. Thanks for sharing.

My family loves this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Since then I have added my own twist. When I have over ripe bananas is when I make this oatmeal the most, better than banana bread. :).  I add 1/2 c stevia and 1/4 c coconut sugar instead of brown sugar, and 1/4 c of agave nectar instead of maple sugar. I also add frozen cranberries to the mix and that has to be one of my favorite ingredients!  We have tried all different kinds of fruit and it always turns out wonderful!

This is my favorite recipe and I change it up every time depending on what's in the fridge.  Today I added a cup of applesauce and cut the butter to 1T and the milk in half.  I also cut the brown sugar in half and didn't miss it.  I added apple and banana as well and it was great!  I cook it on Sunday morning so I'll have leftovers for the week.

I doubled and put in a 13x9 pan.  Used half applesauce and half butter plus 1/2 cup of raisins.  Baked for 45 minutes.  Thank you for the recipe, Josh.  It is fabulous and my boys adore it!

As written, this is an excellent, crowd-pleasing, very tasty, very easy recipe. I like to prepare this recipe as directed when I have overnight guests. It's a little rich for a weekday breakfast with the family though, so when I'm just making it for the kiddos, I cut the butter, the brown sugar, and the salt in half. The end result is drier than the original recipe and the consistency is similar to a fluffy scone, but it's still delightful, easy, tasty, and even my toddlers enjoy it. This is also a very versatile recipe as well. One variation I like is to add a cup or two of chopped apples, plus an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, a half teaspoon of nutmeg, and a quarter teaspoon each of ginger and cloves. Thank you for a wonderful recipe and a new breakfast staple in our home!

I have made this recipe 3 times now.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and, like other reviewers, the kids and I found it much to sweet. The second time I made it I omitted the brown sugar and added a handful of pumpkin seeds... it came out fantastic!  This morning I made it again using only a half cup of brown sugar and replaced the butter with a pureed apple and apricot I had on hand.  I also threw in a few spoons of canned cranberries (I had no dried) and replaced the butter with pureed apple, apricot and apple juice.  We also used almond and coconut milk.  Very delicious with just the right amount of sweet.

I will be giving this one another try! I think I cooked it too long bc it more so turned out as a oatmeal loaf rather than being a creamy yet thick oatmeal like i was expecting. The flavor was still good and went well with out breakfast supper we had.

The recipe was enticing, so I set out to make it on a very chilly late September Saturday morning! Since I really limit my sugar, I took the b. sugar to 1/4 C. Chopped up two small Gala Apples, and added the raisins. I did bump up the maple syrup just a smudge! For my taste, this was sweet enough, especially with a little almond milk in the bowl! VERY easy to make!

I have made this about 10 times or so. I don't like the "soup" method of making oatmeal, hence why this recipe works so good for me.

I usually split the recipe in half using the calculator and round down. There are no fresh cranberries where I am. Here's the current adaptation:

[DISCLAIMER: Half recipe!!!]

So it's...
1 cup rolled oats
1/4 brown sugar
1 tbsp honey (we don't usually buy maple syrup)
1/2 cup milk
2 tsp cinnamon
1 egg
1 tsp vanilla
1 tsp baking powder
1/4 melted butter or 1/8 canola oil
Pinch of salt

Method
Pretty same but I beat the egg with the vanilla to get rid of the raw smell of the egg. No cranberries to fold in. 

I have experimented with using ramekins and a smaller square pan in a Breville oven. It's usually around 22 - 25 mins + preheating.

Hope you enjoy my adaptation :)

This is delicious!  I make it up ahead and it is ready in the morning.  You can also freeze it and pop out single servings in the morning.  A hot and quick breakfast you make ahead and WOW my family loves it.

On behalf of Weeble & that I can't copy & paste her comment from the Buzz in my notes:  
"mmmmmmm....i looove my steel cut oats! i eat them every morning. i'm the only one that eats so i make enough for four or five days. pour one cup of steel cut oats into three and a half cups of boiling water. i add a little salt to the water. let it come back to a boil and boil for a min. turn off the heat, put the lid on and leave overnight. in the morning take your portion and put the rest in the fridge for the rest of the week! i add nuts, brown sugar, maple syrup, a couple shakes of apple pie or pumpkin pie spice,chopped up apples, blueberries, anything goes!"  'Don't think she'll mind.  :D  :)

I made this recipe without maple syrup and only using egg whites for a healthier version. I also didn't add cranberries. It was AMAZING! As I served it to my family I heard "wow!"'s and "yum!"'s. Everyone loved it. It's excellent in a bowl of milk, but great alone, too!

This was so good!  I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and it came out perfectly. My only substitution was fresh blueberries instead of cranberries. I made this for a large group and it was a hit. I’ll definitely be making this again.

My family really enjoys this.  I always DOUBLE the recipe and make a few changes: decreasing the sugar from 1.5 cups to 1 cup, replacing melted butter with non-fat greek yogurt, decreasing maple syrup to 1/4 cup. Sometimes I toss in raisins or dried cherries, sometimes not.  The recipe is very flexible and even without the changes it's a great, filling breakfast. I bake it in a 13x9 pan for 45-50 minutes and cut it into 8 servings. Make it and eat it for a week and you won't have to freak out in the morning and end up eating a cinnamon roll and then descending into a shame/stretchy pants spiral.  Highly recommend it!

Excellent for dessert with ice cream.  I reduced the salt by half, used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and used apple sauce instead of butter.  Forgot to mentioned, put 1/2 cup of blueberry....was a success with the family.  ********update - even better for breakfast with milk.  will be a keeper as so versatile****

Excellent!  Following other reviewers' comments, I cut the sugar back a bit - I used 1/4 C. brown sugar and 1/4 C. reduced sugar maple syrup - just right (and I have a sweet tooth).  I also used vanilla almond milk (unsweetened), and substituted apple sauce for the butter.  Will definitely make again - great, filling breakfast or brunch dish.

This is very similar to a baked oatmeal I’ve been making for years. I omit the maple syrup and substitute it with unsweetened applesauce and add in a few hefty spoonfuls of yogurt. The applesauce and yogurt provide moisture to the bake. In addition to the dried cranberries I like to toss in fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries) these soak in that extra sweetness and make the dish pop

I made changes as many other reviewers did, mainly reducing or eliminating the brown sugar and using applesauce instead of butter.  I used steel cut oats which really changes the final texture but not in a bad way.  I will sometimes use a chopped apple or chopped frozen cherries.  I have made this several times, always using the basic recipe but with modifications, depending on what I have.  I store left overs in the fridge and re-heat in the micro with milk.

I substituted Spenda brown sugar blend for the sugar and maple syrup. I added chopped walnuts & dried cranberries. I used the salt quantity from the recipe, but since I'm watching sodium, I'll reduce it by 1/3 next time. These bars came out fine, very tasty & versatile. We've had them for a mobile breakfast, re-heated with a side of vanilla ice cream for dessert. Next time, I'll add more dried fruit & more walnuts to make it even more substantial.

Make it every week.  Added shredded carrots and lots of apples.

In the fall I used canned pumpkin and pumpkin flavored soy mild along with pumpkin pie spice.

Very good recipe. However, I did use only 1/3 cup sugar and 1/4 cup butter.  I added sweetened coconut and cranberries and a huge apple. It was plenty sweet. I also added 1/2 cup flax meal. I love it for a quick breakfast.

This baked oatmeal is wonderful!  I used GF oatmeal, vanilla almond milk, a Neat Egg (plant based) and Earth Balance spread to make it vegan.  I added a chopped Pink Lady apple, orange flavored cranberries and pecans.  As others suggested, I served it with vanilla soy yogurt, sliced apple & a sprinkle of cinnamon.  My husband and I loved it!  This is a great breakfast or dessert dish for group get togethers!

This recipe is amazing and I should get about four servings out of it other than the one I ate this morning. I followed the recipe exactly except I used honey instead of maple syrup on hand and found it not stuck together enough so I'm going to try one of the tips from another review and only add one egg and I'm going to try it with raisins and pumpkin seeds. I'm also going to make a batch with chocolate chips and marshmallows for my kids. Love it!!!!!!

This is truly  a perfect breakfast treat! It's incredibly easy to make. I didn't have vanilla or dried cranberries on hand, so I omitted.  Instead I added frozen blueberries, and hemp and flax seeds to add some nutrition. I did not reduce the sugar and it is not overly sweet as some of the reviews lead you to believe.  It seems this is a forgiving recipe, so don't be afraid to add your own creative adaptations. I will definitely make this again.

I have made this several times and my family loves it. My ONLY complaint is that it does not stay together as a bar. Is it supposed to? What could I change to make it more like a bar? I need it to be portable.

Delicious recipe with a hearty satisfying taste, and easy to make into a healthy breakfast bar on the go-
I make a batch of these about once a month- easy switches to turn it into a lower fat, more protein packed bar:
Sub small applesauce tub (1/2 cup) for 1/2 of the butter
Add one scoop of your fave vanilla protein powder
Go a bit easier on the sugar, and omit the vanilla if you're using vanilla protein powder. I add pecans as well.
Bake, cut into 12 bars, and put them in plastic baggies for breakfast! So good.

Love it. Made it with dried apricots instead of the cranberries but otherwise as written. Warmed up leftovers in the microwave for a fast breakfast. So good I just made it for the second time this month.

This is a great recipe and I will make it again. I gave it 4 stars because I cut back on the sugar and syrup (I used agave) and it was still too sweet. I think I will play with this recipe and add pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice. I think I will also add some nuts as suggested by others.

This is a great recipe make as is. I make it for my teenaged boys to eat for breakfast throughout the week , (especially during the winter months) . We also like to heat it up and serve it with vanilla ice cream for a special evening treat! My family loves cinnamon so  I more than double the amount that the recipe calls for. This oatmeal also freezes well but has never lasted more than 2 weeks in my freezer since we tend to devour it pretty quickly . I also like to pour heavy cream on top, customizing it to each persons thickness/thinness preference. This is a delicious recipe that has become a family staple. Thank you joshllorio!

I omitted the maple syrup and used one teaspoon of vanilla and one teaspoon of maple extract. It came out really good. When I make this again, I’ll try it with apples or maybe even strawberries. Yum!

This was excellent!  I added Granny Smith apples and subbed golden raisins for the cranberries because that's what I had on hand.  I added 1 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 tsp cloves.  I switched the maple syrup for honey.  No leftovers!  Next time I will double the batch.

LOVE this recipe!  I've made it several times. I decrease the sugar to about 1/2 cup because I increase the fruit by quite a bit. I've done raisin/craisin, raisin/craisin/date/apricot, and just plain craisin.  I spread the mixture in a 9x13, so it's a little thinner than it would be if you used a square pan. I usually eat it cold from my hand!  As written, I think the recipe would be too sweet for my taste, but it's so easy to adjust the sugar to make it work for you.  Thanks for this easy breakfast I can make on the weekend and enjoy all week!

Used 1/2 old fashioned and 1/2 quick cooking oats because that is what I had. Only used 1/2 c sugar. And used 1/4 c margarine and 1/4 c unsweetened apple sauce in place of butter. It was good warm, but dry the next day.

I love fruit with my oatmeal, so I added a cup of thawed frozen blueberries and a cup of thawed frozen cranberries to the mix. I got a bit of a custard at the bottom, which could have been caused by the extra moisture from the fruit causing the oats to float and separate. Still tasted amazing!  I would definitely use this recipe again.

I really wanted to like this - even tried making it again to see if I had overcooked it the first time but it's just not good. I'll take creamy oatmeal over this dried-out, chewy version any day. And for the amount of butter and sugar we should've just made oatmeal cookies!

Not a fan of regular morning oatmeal because of the squishy, sticky texture... this recipe is GENIUS.  I LOVE the texture of the baked oatmeal.  I didn't have maple syrup.  I did add some chopped pecans, and it was SO delicious!  Ate it warm with a bit of milk poured over the top... YUM!!  Making a double batch to cut up and freeze for quick breakfasts.

Amazing.  I wouldn't change a thing if making this as a special indulgent breakfast :)  Since this has become my 'go to' breakfast I made a couple minor changes to save (just a few)calories.  I prefer steel cut oats, so I used those.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 cup and substituted applesauce for the butter.  (My husband loves the butter taste so I "butter" the top when serving.)  I double the recipe, and freeze individual squares in separate sandwich bags - they are perfect for a grab-n-go breakfast to heat quickly at home or work.

Thank you for this recipe. It had become one of our favorite breakfasts! I do leave out the maple syrup to cut down on the sugar. This is the only way I can get two of my kids to eat oatmeal for breakfast.

Very Tasty!  My two year old thought she was having a "cookie in a bowl" for breakfast!  After reading a few comments beforehand, I did reduce the sugar to 1/2C (I bet 1/3C would even work) and I cut the salt in half.  Delicious!  Will use again!

Very delicious! I made this adding toasted walnuts along with corn syrup (because I didn't have maple) and it was wonderful. I as well poured in some milk after it was done (great addition). Thanks so much joshllorio for sharing a wonderful change in oatmeal family loved it.
