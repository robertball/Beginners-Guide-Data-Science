I used common sense to figure out where to add the missing ingredients and found this recipe to be GREAT! Not dry what so ever, cheesy, bacony, like I was eating an actual hamburger. My husband who HATES leftovers even took this to work for lunch the next day. Kind of time consuming, though because you have to use a skillet and then a pie plate, but trust me, its worth it.

Not bad!  Actually quite tasty.  I was looking for a quiche recipe that would have good flavor and that I could substitute a pie crust for hash browns and I found one that had both! Sweet!!  I definitely liked the hash brown crust instead of a regular pie crust.  It was far less work and tasted much better (in my opinion.  I have never been too keen on pie crusts- making them or the flavor of them).  The over all flavor was yummy and good.  I added a clove of garlic to the meat as I cooked it to give it some extra flavor and it all turned out wonderfully!! this recipe is definitely a keeper. :)

Thumbs' up from the whole family. I even sneaked some pureed veggies (sweet pepper, carrots) into the ground beef, and the flavor was so yummy, nobody could tell!

Was okay. Had the potentional to be amazing though. You really need to add some type of seasoning to the potateo part. IT was really bland and flet out of place with the filling. I made as direction stated other then omitting the onion because my daughter doesn't care for them

We enjoyed this dish very much! Hearty and savory. I took the time to grate my own potatoes for the crust and fry up my own (turkey) bacon. We'll be making it again!

I didn't have liquid smoke, but it was still good without it. A little salsa spices it up quite well.

I really liked it, and so did my 3 year old.  The 6 year old and my wife didn't think much, but I LOVED this.  It was easy, and tasted great...just takes a bit long...

Made this for dinner last night.  My family loved it and so did I.  I didn't have liquid smoke so I left that out.   Thanks for a great recipe.  It is definitely a keeper.

This was a great easy recipe. I had dehydrated hashbrowns which I prepared according to its directions first (which was just soaking in water first) then prepared as directed. I left out the liquid smoke as well. My family of 3 teenage boys (plus 2 friends) loved it!

This was pretty yummy. I opted to try it with the liquid smoke, but honestly, I think if you have a nice (already smoky) tasty bacon to add to it, you don't need both. The only issue I had was I cooked my hashbrowns forever and they barely crisped up. I'm not sure if it's because I chose to use the non-frozen kind (Simply potatoes!) or not. Next time I will try it with a thawed bag of frozen and see if that makes a difference.

Unfortunately I am unable to find Liquid Smoke where we live which I think would have given this the flavor it was missing. This recipe is definitely not for the waist watcher.

This might be a good dish if we knew how to use all the ingredients.  Not in recipe are the bacon bits, smoke flavoring or worcestershire sauce.  Very Dry!

Really, really good. Husband even had seconds! Fried 2 slices of thick bacon and crumbled into the final mix. Added 2 cloves of minced garlic while cooking meat. Wish I hadn't added the last topping of cheese but I know better for next time. Otherwise it was quite tasty.

Me and my husband loved this. I added my own twist too it. We added sour cream to the mixture of the hamburger, onions, cheese, milk and eggs. We also did not use corn starch, W sauce, or the liquid smoke flavoring. It's excellent with ketchup!

I made this exactly as written and it was pretty good.  I will make this again but with a few changes.  I am going to add some melted butter on top of the hash browns to help them brown, and I will use 4-5 eggs instead of 2. I will also add some green peppers and hot sauce to the hamburger mixture. This is a good basic recipe.  Just needs some tweaking.

This was a great recipe.I doubled recipe and put it in a 13 x 9 dish. I think it would be good also with sausage instead of hamburger meat.

This was too bland, but I agree with another reviewer that it had the potential to be amazing.  I added the liquid smoke, but would omit it next time or cut it in half.  I added real bacon bits and I would also make my own grated potatoes next time and try spicing that up as well.  I just feel like this recipe has great potential but something was missing.  My husband ate his with salsa and said that spiced it up nicely.

My family says that this is a "keeper".  But I did make some changes.  First, I think that people say that it's "missing something" because all the cheese is sitting on top in a lump.  Mix the cheese into the egg mixture, as you would any quiche!!  Sprinkle a bit more on top at the end for appearances.  I did not have some of the additions so I used red-pepper flakes & green onions.  I think sauteed mushrooms would be awesome, also.  It was great!  Enjoy!!

I made the following adjustments and we really enjoyed the results: I used 1/2 pkg of frozen hash browns, sprinkled lightly with salt. I used seasoned taco meat in place of regular hamburger and omitted the smoke flavoring, bacon bits, and Worchestershire sauce. Served with salsa for those who desired. Great to have another filling recipe for my gluten-free husband!

I followed the recipe as is except that I used an entire package of shredded cheese and by the time I realized I needed some of it for the top it was too late so I used slices of American cheese on top and it came out great

I cooked this only for myself so I cut all the ingredients in half, but it turned out amazing. I added a little onion and garlic powder to my potatoes and ground beef. I will be making this often!

I subbed Johnsonville Italian Sausage (casings removed - 19oz package) in place of the ground beef. I also used 6 eggs instead and increased the milk to half a cup. It was very tasty! My family really enjoyed it. It would be great with breakfast sausage too.

In my last post I was going to mention the substitutions I made because I didn’t have all the ingredients on hand. Instead of hash browns I used the next best thing...Crispy Crowns, which if you are not familiar with, is basically a thin version of the Tater Tot. Mine where frozen so I preheated the stove to 425 F and put the crowns on a cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil. Then I covered the crowns with more aluminum foil to seal the pan off. I then allowed them to heat in the oven for about 10 minutes. As that was going I prepared the meat with season salt, garlic powder, and onion powder to taste. Once the meat was done, I made bacon and made my own bits. I prepared the egg mixture without the liquid smoke. Used the Worcestershire sauce and some soy sauce along with the other ingredients and followed the rest of the directions of the recipe. It turned out wonderful! I think this dish would also taste good with pulled pork or even chicken.

This was very good and easy to make. I wasn’t sure if my husband was going to like it, but he did. When I make it again I will add green chilies to it.

This was a hit! Kids loved it!  For my family, the meat needed a little more flavor, but that’s an easy fix

I liked it. I used southwestern style hashbrowns which add a lot of spice and flavor.

I loved the concept of using the hash brown potatoes as a crust. However, I did make a few changes. instead of mixing butter with the hash browns, I used bacon grease. I substituted the hamburger for bacon. So if you like bacon, this is a change you will love! Buon appetite!!!

family fav.  Loved the hash brown crust.  Very easy!!

I didn't add any bacon bit, but I will try it with real bacon next time.  My son thought it could use a sharper cheddar.  So, we can try that, too.

Would be better with fresh, crispy bacon, but overall, an excellent recipe that my whole family enjoyed.... even my picky eater kids. So I call it a win. :-)

Very good.  I didn't have any Worcester sauce or liquid smoke so I used some BBQ sauce.  Didn't put the extra cheese on top.  It didn't need it.

My husband was concerned when I called it a quiche, but loved it.  He has already asked that I make it again.  Next time I will  need to really thaw the potatoes and get them a little crispier but that was on me.

Easy recipe and husband likes it.  We both agree that seems it needs a little more taste.  I did add a teaspoon of fresh garlic.

I did make some modifications to give it more flavor. My husband is a truck driver and took leftovers with him the next day. Said it was one of the best leftovers he has taken with him in the truck.

Absolutely not for dieters... I had to go back for seconds! I doubled the recipe for our large family, using reconstituted dehydrated hash browns for the crust, a shortcut I don't recommend. Cook time might have been too short, the middle was loose, but I will make this again with real hash browns.

I tried this recipe yesterday and it was a hit!  I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.  I added a little this and a little of that (seasoning).  There were no left overs!  I used real bacon....takes only a few minutes to fry 4-5 pieces of bacon and salt, pepper, garlic. I also added jalapeno and pepper jack cheese on the bottom.  This gets five scores for me and a keeper in my recipe book!
Enjoy!

I used this recipe to get rid of some extra taco meat, and it came out great! I omitted the liquid smoke flavoring, and used real bacon instead of bacon bits. Then, I fried the onion in the bacon grease, instead of with the beef.

I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, so I omitted it and added 1/2 cup sweet green pepper, it tasted awesome. My husband isn't a fan of trying new things, but he loved this, def. making it again soon, thanks

I was really excited to make this but was highly disappointed with the result. The taste was Very Bland. If you make it you need to add something to make up for the blandness
