Don't get me wrong I've made this a million times even though I know it's a 2 star. But it's so easy and I feel like I'm "cooking" so I feel less guilty about eating boxed junk. But it is what it is. Depending on how saucy the noodles are I sometimes also add canned chicken or tuna.

A staple of my diet from my college years. Ramen noodles and frozen veggies. Still make it sometimes when I want a wholesome dinner in minutes. 5 stars because it's simple and fast and good!
