Nasi Goreng - This recipe works best if you use rice made the night before and it is cold from the refrig. I always use jasmine rice. If you do not have 'kecap manis' you can use ketchup mixed with a little brown sugar. I also add chicken to mine and have used tofu. I simply saute the garlic and onion, add one chicken breast thinly sliced with the egg, then I add the veggies , chili's (always red) and season with some salt and white pepper. Once my veggies are cooked I add the pre-cooked rice and the sauces. I may cook for 5 minutes or so.

I came from Indonesia and nasi goreng is really common for people in Indonesia. I tried this recipe, very nice almost like my own recipe. For me, I'll add the chilli pepper with thai pepper. I like spicy and hot !!

During my visit to Jakarta fried rice was the main stay of my diet. This taste very close to that.

First of all, this is truly not the original authentic Indonesian fried rice. The taste is okay, I can eat it but not a favorite.

This recipe doesn't even look authentic.
I'd suggest starting over with new ingredients.

I thought this was pretty good. I did not have any kecap manis so I looked it up on line and made it from scratch. The dish will not blow you away but it did taste better than the last Indonesian fried rice I ordered in a restaurant.

I used this recipe as a base and added my own stuff to it.  I didn't use kecap manis because I don't even know what it is.  I skipped the tomato sauce because it just sounded strange and I didn't have any cucumbers on hand so I didn't use those either.  I ended up using a jalapeno and a lot of soy sauce.  I had some left over baked chicken and cooked bacon so I threw that in too.  I also added some green onion and tabasco towards the end.  It turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe.  I wouldn't have thought to add the carrot and celery and they were actually quite nice in the dish.

The chili peppers made it a little too spicy for me but other wise I would say that it was pretty good.
