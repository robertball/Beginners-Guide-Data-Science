I have read all the reviews for this recipe, so here's a quick summary, with a few of my own notes: Reduce amt of chicken (submitter must have made a typo), use 1/2 cream of coconut and 1/2 coconut milk in lieu of condensed milk, add coconut flakes to the cornflake mixture (may also use panko bread crumbs). Substitute pineapple juice instead of lemon juice (it's the perfect compliment) and add the juice directly to melted butter. Last but not least, I personally recommend using plantains in lieu of bananas - you're guaranteed not to have mushy results as some reviewers have reported. Frozen plantains are available in your grocer's freezer and may be added to the chicken 1/2 through the allotted baking time. If you think it sounds like an interesting flavor combination --  I believe with the above tweaks it's truly 5-stars!

Interesting tastes serving chicken with bananas!  It tasted great!  The only drawbacks were that it messed up a lot of dishes and portions were off.

Next time I make it, I'll use only 3 lbs of chicken, and I'll put the ingredients straight into the baking dishes when preparing them.

My family loved the taste.  I might use crushed macadamia nuts instead of corn flakes next time.  

Overall, it's a keeper!

This recipe was great.  It may very well be my new favorite food.  I modified it a little - instead of sweetened condensed milk, I mixed half sweetened condensed milk and half cream of coconut (like the kind you use to make pina colada).  It turned out fabulous.  Served this with sweet german wine.  Yummy.  I LOVE the bananas.  I think that the baked bananas would make a great desert with ice cream!!!

This recipe was soooo good.  The bananas were so incredibly sweet, I was asked to make them on future occasions as a side dish!  Who ever would have guessed of putting bananas with chicken and serving them for dinner?  Anyway, the combination was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will definately make it again.

This dish was a bit of a disappointment.  The chicken turned out to be fairly bland.  The bananas tasted good, but were unappealing because they got pretty black on the bottom.

Made this dish for my family tonight. Messy to make and was just not my thing I guess. I was confused with the bananas and the cereal. Was wondering if the amounts of the chicken was right...

The chicken tasted really originally and I liked the unique blend of flavors in it!!
But I got disappointed by the bananas - they got really soft and buttery and I 
have to admit I prefer regular baked bananas. But maybe my fault was putting 
both chicken and bananas in the same dish from the very start, instead of
following the recipe step by step? Anyway, this is a nice combination!!

I had to try this recipe, as it sounded so....well...wierd! I am glad I did. It was very different and exotic tasting. I crushed the cornflakes but will crush them even finer next time as they were a little too pronounced after baking, and I will do less bananas as the recipe didn't need that much to get the full banana taste. I also substituted coconut milk instead of the regular milk. I served mine with sliced kiwi and pineapple tidbits, and the Asian Coconut Rice from this site (which works out perfectly to use up the remainder of the can of coconut milk). Thank you for this outrageously different recipe!

This recipe was AWESOME!!!!!  I think the recipe needed 6 chicken breasts, not 6lbs-that doesn't even make sense as there wouldn't even be enough dip for everything.  Anyway I used 4 extrememly thick boneless chicken breasts and the cooking time was perfect.  I also put the bananas in a cookie sheet (not a 9x13 pan)  and they came out perfect as well. If your bananas are mushy, they were too ripe-use extremely green bananas.  Definitely one of the tastiest dishes I've made.

I did not like this at all.  My husband found the first bite to be a little strange, but stated that the flavor grew on him and got better the more he ate. He said the chicken was really moist.  I think the sweetness just did me in.  Sorry, not a fan.

We really enjoyed this unusual dish. The only problem was that the measurements were really off. For 2 people I changed the measurements to 2 tsp lemon juice, 1/8 can sweetened condensed milk, 1 1/4 tbsp of coconut, 1/8 tsp cardamom, 1 banana, 1/2 cup crushed cornflakes, 2 chicken breasts, and 2 1/2 tbsp melted butter. Tasted a lot like eating a dessert for dinner so it may not be for everyone but we loved it.

Excellent recipe. My husband & I had this with the Harvest rice dish recipe. It was an absolutely fabulous meal. I did crush the corn flakes so it would adhere a little better.

This dish was ok. I made it for my older sister and farther, doing it by the recipe except I didn't put the seasoning in it because it costs way too much at the store... but anyway. I think it would have been better with not having the banana's at all. I made them right and all but I dont really feel the are good with this mixture.

This was a great recipe, I changed it a bit, by placing 1 cup of shredded coconut in the food processor and chopping to a fine grind and adding that to the breading crumbs.  I also deep fried the bananas, but the chicken was much better and moist when baked.  I was really surprised that everyone loved them, especially the banana!

Actually kind of a 3.5...
I expected too much when I made this recipe but in the end, I didn't find it to be all that.  I mean it was okay.. Worth trying, I may make it again.  I just found that the bananas didn't go all that well with the lemon kind of thing.  Its kind of sweet dullish. I rushed it a bit so it wasn't all that attractive but I should have put more effort into it.  It would taste better with effort for sure.
