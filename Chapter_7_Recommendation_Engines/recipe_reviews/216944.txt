I love the flavor of this bread, even after a few days. Stays moist and full of oat flavor.  I didn’t have macadamias so I subbed 1 1/2 oz. almond meal. The only problem I had was that it rose too high in the bread maker pan and subsequently sunk in the middle before it was finished.  Not a pretty loaf but yummy.  Trying to figure out why- perhaps the pan is too small, and I should bake it in a larger loaf pan in the oven?  Try a little less yeast? In any case it was good enough that I’ll try again!
