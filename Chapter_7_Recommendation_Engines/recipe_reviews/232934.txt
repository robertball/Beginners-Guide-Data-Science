I didn't actually try this recipe but this is a difficult recipe to get right and these instructions aren't detailed enough. If you decide to try this recipe, there are a couple things you need to know. First, you need to use a thoroughly cleaned glass or ceramic bowl to whip the cream, don't use plastic. Even the smallest amount of oil will prevent stiffening and plastic is too porus. Second, the cookies must be ground to a fine powder, not simply crushed up. You won't get that good gingerbread taste in the ice cream itself if you don't powder your cookies. Maybe do half powder and half chunks if you like that sort of thing. I prefer a smooth ice cream.

Omg, this recipe is beyond amazing!! A close friend of mine requested that I make her some pumpkin ice cream (since my husband got me an ice cream maker for Christmas). I was a little nervous by this challenge since I don't cook/bake with pumpkin very often. I omitted the cookies and added walnuts, and made a hit! I have also made this ice cream for my sister who can't say enough about it. Love, love, love! Thank you.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving and it was a hit!  The yummy Pumpkin ice cream was delicious and then you would get a part of a gingersnap and your mouth would just warm like magic.  Also everyone appreciated that it was a dessert other than pie.  I Have already been asked to make more for christmas!

Made this and it was a huge hit.  I cut back a bit on the sweetened condensed milk (didn't use the full can) - because other ice creams I've made using this method have come out too sweet for my friends.  I used German spiced cookies instead of gingersnaps.  Since I had extra ice cream that didn't fit in my container, I used leftover ice cream and cookies to make ice cream sandwiches.  Yum!

It tasted exactly like pumpkin pie! It was delicious and very simple to make. My only problem, the reason I did not rate this recipe 5/5, is that the texture is grainy. I will make this again tho!

Love the flavor. Not too sweet. It is more like a frozen mousse. Not a bad thing. But different. Light and easy to make.

I just whisked all of the ingredients then froze it in an ice cream machine. It tastes very similar to pumpkin pie filling.
