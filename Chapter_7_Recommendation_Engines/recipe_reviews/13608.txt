This is a GREAT time saver for a busy holiday.  I make ahead then throw in the crockpot on low the morning of the holiday so that I save oven space and they're ready to eat by the time the rest of the dinner's done.  I've had several requests for this recipe.  Also really good using redskin potatoes!

Great recipe!! I use when potatoes are on sale and make big batch, then freeze in zip bags enough for a meal. Makes several bags. Keeps potatoes from sitting and sprouting and i have one step for dinner already done when i need them. Perfect for working moms, saves some energy and time, yet you still have real mashed potatoes. I make these often.

We have made this for many holiday dinners. You can also put these in a crockpot for 5 to 6 hours. It's a great way to keep them warm without the hassle of watching over them!

Really good! After assembling, I put them in my crock pot dish and refrigerated overnight. I reheated in the crock pot for several hours with a few pats of butter on top. Would never have had time to make mashed potatoes on Christmas day otherwise.

When cooking for a crowd -- this is the ONLY way to make mashed potatoes!!  I added some minced garlic for more flavor.  I made thanksgiving dinner for 20 with only one oven, and it is recipes like this that saved the day.  There was not one SCRAP of mashed potatoes left!!

This mashed potatoes were a great basic, easy recipe. The only thing I added was one stick of butter. I did  not bake them, I made them the day of and kept them warm in the crock pot.

I have made them as much as five days ahead..I recomend this for any cook who wants to save a little time on the day of a big meal...  PS The most wonderful thing about this recipe is they never taste like wormed overs or leftovers

These were awesome mashed potatoes. I made the potatoes the night before. Instead of heated them in the oven I put them in a crock pot on low. I added milk and butter to remoisten.

Make these every Thanksgiving now.  So good and helps doing them ahead.  I usually put a couple of cloves of garlic in the pot when I boil the potoes and then just mash them right in too.

DELICIOUS!!! I made this recipe a couple of days before Thanksgiving & kept the potatoes in the refrigerator til the morning of - then  reheated them in my crock pot until ready to serve.  Received rave reviews -even from my son-in-law who considers himself a mashed potato connoisseur.

I made this the night before Thanksgiving and used russet potatoes instead of Yukon Gold. Otherwise, I made it exactly as described. I hesitated a bit because some people felt the sour cream was overwhelming and I had never made mashed potatoes with cream cheese and no milk. Also, though I like fluffy mashed potatoes, some people had felt they were much too stiff. I decided to I could always add milk before serving so I followed the recipe. 

Yes, the next morning, the sour cream taste was a bit overwhelming and they seemed too stiff but I decided to give it a chance and I was glad I did. After two hours on low in the crockpot. I checked them. I gave them a good stir and took a taste. Yes, they were a bit less "stiff" and the sour cream taste had mellowed quite a bit. Noting the condensation on the lid, I decided to just give them a good stir about every 30 minutes of the remaining time and sure enough, when the four hours was up, they were absolutely perfect! I had 13 people and these were devoured and raved about by everyone. 

Sometimes you simply have to uh... trust the directions and follow them exactly. I'm glad I did for if I would have cooked it for a shorter time or added more liquid, it would have been a mess I'm afraid.

So good and what a blessing to make ahead!  I threw in 3-4 cloves of garlic with the potatoes to boil and mashed them right with the taters.  Also added about 1/2 cup grated parmesan, and sprinkled top with paprika for color.

I was having several people over for Easter dinner so I wanted to have as much food made beforehand as possible so that I could enjoy my guests.  While the recipe was very good (although I would add some chives next time), there just 'ain't nothin like the real thing'.  The day ahead idea just did't work and they tasted like leftovers.  This recipe should be made fresh.

These have a wonderful flavor and you sure can't beat the convenience!  I made mine the day before then warmed them in the slow cooker on low for four hours and they were the best tasting mashed potatoes we've ever had.  I used low fat cream cheese and sour cream.

This recipe is so yummy and it was great making it the night before!  I did change it a bit.  I used 8 ounces of plain cream cheese instead of 6 and left out onion powder and used 1 tablespoon of garlic powder.  I also left the milk out.  I put the whipped potatoes in a 9x13 pan and stuck it in the fridge.  The next day I poked holes in the potatoes with a fork and poured 1/4 cup of milk over them.  I baked them at 350 for 40 minutes.  The family loved them

I use this year round. My family and I will do a potato party with the kids peeling and me chopping. I make them and freeze them in muffin tins for single servings. I then take them and wrap in saran wrap and freeze in ziplock bags. I do meatloaf the same way, and then I take out the number needed to cook.  It's great to have on hand for meals for one or two people since I usually cook for 40-50 a day. I like to keep these on hand for a fast side.  I can microwave from frozen in about the same time as driving thru fast food.Sure beats fast food and deli potatoes.

I also have made a similar recipe for years, but my recipe calls for 1 TBSP of minced onion rather than the onion salt and 1/2 tsp seasoned salt. And only as much milk as you want for the right consistency. I like to drizzle the butter over the top, but being weight conscious I only use a tablespoon instead of what the recipe calls for. Add a sprinkling of paprika on top before you bake and it gives a pretty looking finished product.

This recipe saved me!  Was making an impromtu Thanksgiving dinner for my family...my parents were moving the next day and no one wanted to take the time to make the traditional meal...so I offered.  I made this the night before, stuck it in the crockpot and refrigerated overnight.  Then about 5 hours before we were to eat, I put it on low.  By meal time the potatoes were perfect!  Don't think anyone would have known the difference, if I hadn't told them.

I made these Christmas Eve, with a few minor changes.  I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth, I was also GOING to add some garlic cloves, but forgot.  When I was mashing them I added about 5 ozs cream cheese, 8 oz sour cream, 1/2 cup heavy cream (b/c I wanted to use it up), and garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Put them in the crock pot w/ a few pats of butter, and popped in the fridge overnight.  Christmas morning I took them out and let them thaw a bit on the counter, then cooked on the low setting of the crock pot for about 4 hrs.  They were perfect!  Nobody could believe they were made the day before, and everyone absolutely loved them!  Will make many more times!!

I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving.  They tasted good, alothough they were a little "soupy".  I think I would check the consistency before adding all of the milk.

Rich, creamy and oh so delicious! This is certainly comfort food at it's best! But, the very best part about this recipe is the fact that you can "Make it Ahead" of time which is a real life-saver around the holidays!  I didn't bother baking this in a casserole because my oven was doing all the work with the rest of the meal. I simply put this in my crock pot on low in order to reheat and serve.  Definitely not for those counting calories and something you want to save for special occasions - great recipe!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving 2009.  No one liked them. I followed the recipe, made no changes.  While they were cooking and after we mashed them and added everything the recipe called for, and taste tested them they were wonderful. We couldn't wait to try them at dinner time. .  But after putting them in the casserole and baking them they tasted totally different.  Won't waste my time make these again ..........ever.  Very costly recipe to make and not have it be good !!!!!

I usually make my mashed potatoes this way.  The only difference is that I heat up the cream cheese, sour cream and milk before I add them in.  A trick my Grandmother taught me is to add 1 teaspoon of baking powder to the mashed potatoes and they puff up and become light and fluffy.

To conserve on oven space I prepared these a few hours in advance and kept them on hold in my slow cooker, separating the cover from the pot with a terry towel to absorb any moisture and stirring  them periodically.  I used a few good-sized cloves of garlic in the boiling water instead of the onion powder, a full eight ounce package of cream cheese, and found I didn't need the milk at all.  I thought I'd miss any addition of butter, but was surprised I didn't. Good, basic mashed potatoes.

I made these for Thanksgiving diner (Canada) on Monday and they were a big hit. What a great time saver. I will substitute fat free cream cheese and fat free sour cream the next time I make them and see how they turn out. I think keeping a container of them in the freezer would be a great idea. These tasted great without gravy.

These potatoes were absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe to the T and everyone loved them. I will def make these again. I warmed them in the crock pot the next day and served them for Thanksgiving. I never thought of heating them in a crock pot but I don't think I will do it any other way now. Normally the potatoes don't stay warm while being served but the crock pot takes care of that. Thanks for the recipe!

I rate this one a five star because you can freeze them up to a month before you use them. Just take them out of the freezer and put them in the fridge the night before you want them. I always use red potatoes. Most potatoes go watery when frozen but not these.

Made this for Thanksgiving and they really came out great.  I followed the recipe with the exception that I did not put them in the oven.  I put them in my crockpot, on low, for about four hours and they came out great.  Like that I was able to do this ahead of time and it freed up some of my time to get other last minute things done...Will make them again at Christmas time!  Thanks for sharing.

Update:  Made them for Christmas, used the crockpot as listed above, used red potatoes.  The only change I made was I did not peel the potatoes and they turned out great and saved a lot of peeling time!

These are good, mashed potatoes.  Make sure to fully mash the taters BEFORE adding any other ingredients tho - otherwise you get starch glue. (ooops - so THAT is what went wrong  LOL)

I was skeptical, but these were outstanding.  I made them on Thanksgiving morning, following the directions exactly.  I placed them in a crock pot on low for about five hours.  They were perfect!  These potatoes have a great buttery flavor without adding any butter.  This is a definite keeper.

I love to find new recipes that I can make ahead for large family gatherings and holidays, and this was a Thanksgiving favorite! I made these the day before, boiling my potatoes in vegetable stock, for added flavor. I only had 1 package of cream cheese, but I used heavy cream instead of milk, so they were still creamy. I also substitued plain yogurt for the sour cream, and white pepper for black pepper (white pepper makes a huge difference--try it!). My family LOVED these and I loved having one less thing to make on Thanksgiving. I actually had time to sit and watch a little football this year! Thank you, Carol!

This is the ONLY way I make and serve mashed potatoes when I feed a gang. I make it way ahead, then put it into the oven to heat through. The only addition I make is to add one diced sauteed white onion with a couple of cloves of minced garlic. OUT of this world! I've always rec'd requests for this recipe!

These were okay only because we thought the cream cheese and sour cream flavor to be a little too strong in the dish. I would make again but next time probably add alot less cheese and cream and add butter and milk instead.

These were really great... my first time making "successful" mashed potatoes!  ("successful" as in we actually liked them and they didn't taste bland)  In my opinion, what made all the difference in the world was the addition of onion salt... though... I didn't have any onion salt so I used garlic salt (ok, so what made all the difference was that the recipe *said* to use onion salt, which gave me the idea to use the garlic salt) ;-)  Anyway, they were really yummy and I only used about 2.5lbs potatoes, 1 package cream cheese, and half a cup of sour cream (plus the pepper and garlic salt of course).  They were even good the next day!  Thanks!!

I thought these were great.  I made the night before and stored in the fridge.  I left out at room temp for about 20-30 min as recipe states and the middle of the mash potatoes were still cold but the edges were perfect.  It didn't really matter though because this makes so much we never reached the middle!  If you were making to really serve 12 I would leave in the oven longer.

I continue to make this recipe for every major holiday, and it's a winner with my family. And it's so easy to make; once you've made it a few times it's a breeze. I first added this to my recipe box on all recipes in 2001 and make it every single year.

Used one of the suggestions by KRoggenb and used red potatos.  I used this recipe for a big party we had and these were a huge hit.  So much so that all the wives at the party wanted the recipe.  This is truly a 5 star recipe.  Perfect for a holiday when the oven needs to be used for other things!

Everyone loved these, although the sour cream taste was a little strong.  I might have put in a dollop too much.

I made these for Thanksgiving, and they were great! I used 4 Russet potatoes and 4 red potatoes, leaving the skins on. I added a few cloves of garlic, and used only 1 cream cheese package (the potatoes looked good after adding just 1). I also used 8 oz plain yogurt for the sour cream. I tried reheating in crockpot, but next time will cook in oven. Great leftover!

I got a lot of compliments on these mashed potatoes.  I have made them twice, once with Yukon Gold and once with redskins, and I liked the redskins better.

I made these potatoes for Thanksgiving,and they were a hit.  They were very creamy, and best of all, I did not have to spend Thanksgiving day peeling and cooking potatoes.  For a little kick, I added garlic and green onions.  Yummy!

These are fantastic! I made the night before. And believe me I was skeptical. My son ended up eating about 5 platefuls before the day was done! Good with OR with gravy.

Made these to contribute to Thanksgiving Dinner for 18. I enjoyed these -- No one else commented one way or the other. I am more of a traditionalist, and will stick to mashed potatoes with butter and milk. Also, no matter how I've made mashed potatoes for a crowd, they are always "Make-Ahead" -- either the day before or the morning of. This dish was flavorful, but not worth the additional cost or calories.

Really, really good stuff!  I didn't have onion salt so I used 1 1/4 t onion powder and 3/4 t salt and it tasted fine.  Also threw in about a teaspoon of garlic powder as I am incapable of cooking without it.  I froze the potatoes in individual-size servings so that they're easier to deal with later.  I've heated them both in the oven and the microwave - while the oven makes a slightly thicker casserole and is more evenly heated, they do fine in the microwave with a little extra milk and it's so much easier.  Bacon bits and sharp Cheddar on top make for awesome comfort food.  These potatoes will definitely make an appearance at the next family dinner.

Excellent Recipe, Easy and can be made ahead of time.  Especially nice during holiday cooking.  No more standing over the stove trying to get the mash potatoes ready with a house full of company....more time to chat with friends and family.

I made this the night before Thanksgiving. I was a little nervous if it would turn out ok. But when Thanksgiving day came, everyone said that they were the best mashed potatoes they ever ate.

Oh my Gosh! These potatoes were simply AWESOME- My 7 YO Daughter ate ALL of them on her plate and even ate them as leftovers- This will be a keeper for me! I am constantly making new things; only to get thumbs down from my family- BUT NOT WITH THIS RECIPE!!!! YOU MUST TRY IT! I used a small can of evaporated milk,( which equaled out to be more milk than the recipe called for) and added butter to the recipe-I used the hand mixer before putting it in casserole and then dotted with more butter- DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!My husband is a potatoe man and he said these were the best I have ever made- He almost licked his plate!

Made this for the holiday a day before and it turned out great.  I like my mashed potatoes creamy so I used all the ingredients as listed and added four tablespoons unsalted butter.  After spreading in a greased baking dish, I then drizzled two tablespoons of melted butter on top and sprinkled with paprika.  Refrigerated 24 hours then brought to room temperature (about an hour)and baked 30 minutes at 350 degrees with aluminum foil on top then took foil off and baked an additional 20 minutes.  Came out delicious and shows nice too.  Perfect for making ahead of time.

My husband was so nervous about this recipe!  He really likes his mashed potatoes and thought I would ruin Thanksgiving dinner with a preposterous make ahead mashed potato recipe :)........He and everyone else loved them.  After reading reviewers recommendations, I made the recipe as is, put them in a crock pot on low 2 hours before dinner, put a stick of butter on top to melt 30 minutes before serving.  This recipe was a great time saver on a hectic Holiday morning.  I will definitely make this again for special occasions.  Thanks so much!

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, except added a stick of butter and threw in the crock pot for 4 hours on low, instead of the oven (which was in use). Turned out perfectly, light and fluffy, and I got rave reviews from my family. Thanks for posting!

These were so good and I was really concerned about making them when we had company coming for Thanksgiving dinner.  Everyone enjoyed them and I am sure they will be a staple at more dinners! Thanks for sharing!   I have since made these potatoes a few more times and they are always a hit!  I use my crockpot to warm up the next day. I like to poke holes in the top and pour melted butter over.  Then I turn the crockpot onto low 3 hours before dinner and then they are ready when everything else is.

Scrumptious....   I put them in an oven glass baking dish, and sprinkle with panko bread crumbs mixed with melted butter before heating, I also sprinkle paprika over the top, makes a great presentation.

Very good recipe.  However, I did need to zip it up a bit -green onion and chive cream cheese in place of regular. a dose of Penzy's spicy seasoned salt and a bit more milk.

What a great alternative to frenzied potato mashing as your trying to get the rest of the food on for Thanksgiving. I followed another reviewers advice and  reheated in my crock pot to save on oven space. I ended up putting them in too early, woops, next time I think they will only need about 2 1/2 hours on low...don't forget to stir. I omitted the onion salt and sauted a minced shallot and clove of garlic in a couple Tbsp. butter and added that and 1 tsp. salt to the potatoes instead. YUM! Thanks for making Thanksgiving dinner a little easier!

Awesome! I added a few cloves of garlic to the boiling potatoes and mashed them in. I also added a few tablespoons of butter and used half n half instead of milk. I'll be making these again.

I can't believe I have never rated this.  I have been using it for years now.  These are the most delicious and rich potatos, omygosh, I can't say enough!  I have occasionally topped with crispy bacon bits... even more decadent.  I am making them again for Thanksgiving.  These are my absolute favorite!

Yumm Yummm  You can not imagine how godd this recipe is and You really can not go wrong with a recipe with this many reviews..  I have to say I was  very nervous about making Mashed Potatoes the night bfore..  I just had a hard time imagining that they could possibly taste fresh the next day warmed up in the oven..  I had finished making my sweet potatoes and a little voice inside my head told me to go for it.. it was 2am and I had finished preparring everything else that I was going to bake in the morning.  These potatoes were amazing !!!  I added the whole 8oz package of cream cheese. PERFECT!  Thank You for Sharing this Recipe !!!

I've been making them once a year, every year since 2005.  I just finished this year"s batch of what we have nicknamed "Evil Mashers". They are so darn good you can't stop eating them! Add a stick of butter as well.  At this point, why not? LOL

Great taste and simplifies the holidays.  Everyone loved it.  I made it up the day before and put it in the crockpot in the fridge.  Next time, I will either microwave it to get it started or start the crockpot the night before because they weren't quite hot enough for our 2:00 supper.

As is, I thought these just weren't very good. They were too dry and bland. I wound up adding about 1/2 cup butter, a little extra milk and some salt. (The onion salt was completely unnoticed) After these changes, they tasted like ordinary mashed potates with milk and butter. I think maybe if you add butter to this recipe you might want to increase the amount of sour cream for extra flavor.

Absolutely the best mashed potatoes I've ever made or eaten.  Made them a day ahead for a big dinner and it was great not to have the mess that day.  I put them in a crock pot and heated on low all day.  Very easy and simple.

These are fabulous.  I don't think my family will ever settle for ordinary mashed potatoes again!  I used redskin potatoes instead of the Yukon Gold and left the skin on (for more color, nutrition, and ease of preparation).

Ok! So I might be an experienced cook but I can and do follow recipe's. With such a high rating review I felt confident that this was a great potatoe dish. Unfortunately only one person liked the potatoes at Thanksgiving. Most said that it seemed like it was to "ranchy". Will try again and use less of "ranch" mix.

Amazing recipe. I used regular Russets because they were cheaper, and it was still awesome. It also freed up so much time in my Thanksgiving prep. Everyone raved about the creaminess of the potatoes. Thank you so much for sharing it! It's a definite keeper.

Would not make this again and should not have tried it the first time for a holiday dinner.  Can not compare to fresh made.

OMG!  Where can I start?  Well, first of all, let me just say that I followed this recipe exactly.  Second of all, my family are not mashed potato fans.  However, I decided that this was the recipe I was going to use for the traditional Thanksgiving Day meal.  The only thing I did differently was that I added 1/2 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheee and a 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella in addition to the cream cheese.  This dish was the hit of our family Thanksgiving dinner!  There were no leftovers at all!!!  Great recipe, and so easy to make!  This is a keeper!!!  Thank you so much!

These are awesome potatoes, and oh, so easy! Love being able to have this side dish ready ahead. I make them ahead, and keep them in the refrigerator. I've reheated them both ways...in the oven and in the crock pot and they are wonderful either way. I've also doubled the batch and frozen a pan for later use. Used russets instead of Yukon gold~~everyone loved them!

Sooo good! Added a little minced garlic and garlic salt, and it was really good!  Maybe next time I'd use a little less milk though to make it just a little thicker.

Delicious!  Great way to make sure your mashed potatoes are hot when the rest of the meal is ready, and frees up your time for other preparations.  We ate 1/2 and froze 1/2 in a ziplock.

Make these all the time for Thanksgiving and the family loves them.  Love to make the whole meal ahead of time and just reheat the day of.  Sure makes life easy.  Kept them warm in the crock-pot - perfect.

Heats up beautifully when ready to serve. Can be heated in crock pot. Works better with russets due to the extended beating. A little bland without garlic.

Made these for Christmas Eve, it's a keeper! Only difference is that I used Russets as we don't care for yellow potatoes. Using again for Easter--went mad looking for the recipe as I didn't keep a copy of it -- learned the hard way

This recipe was excellent and  a real time saver when you are cooking for a lot of people. I used garlic salt instead of onion and added some minced onions. Also I added bacon bits and some cheddar cheese. It was just what I was looking for.

This is excellent! Turned out really good and it was great to have less to make on Thanksgiving day. I would recommend to definitely add some milk and butter on top before baking it though to rehydrate it. I did that and it turned out really good and just like it had been made that same day.

My family has a "cooperative" Thanksgiving.  We each contribute.  I've been making these potatoes the last few years.  There is never enough even with all the other goodies.  What a great idea.  A real energy saver and delicious too.

Very good.  I did use a half small onion instead of the onion salt.  It was a hit for Thanksgiving.  Very creamy! :)

These are the best mashed potatoes I've had, and I don't particularly care for mashed potatoes.  But I made these the day before Thanksgiving after preparing my dessert.....I was sampling the potatoes as much as the dessert!  These were creamy and tasted good.  I will use this recipe again.  I also whipped the potatoes with a hand-held mixer to make them smoother.

Wonderful! These were great! I was planning a 4 pm dinner time, so I started preparing these about 1 pm. I put them in the crock pot @ 2 pm and stirred them once or twice and by 4 pm when it was time to eat (Thanksgiving Dinner) they were fabulous! The consistency was great, not runny or hard. Even left overs the next day were good. If you're reheating them after they've been cold, and they are hard, just add some milk. They're perfect every time! :-)

OUTSTANDING!  First time I ever tried "make ahead" mashed potatoes, and not only were they delicious, it saved so much time and oven space (I heated them in the crock pot.)  Everyone loved them.  This is a KEEPER!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Yummy!  After putting the potatoes in the casserole dish, I topped it with some garlic salt.

Made these potatoes 2 days before Thanksgiving.  Only thing I did differently was to use 8 oz cream cheese and added garlic powder before mashing.  Heated them in a crock pot on low about 5 hours before the meal with butter dotted on top.  Everyone loved them and couldn't believe they were made days ahead of time.  I'm so impressed!

These are the best mashed potatoes! And the convenience of making them ahead of time is well worth it! So fluffy and yet creamy too.

I used all lower fat ingredients, and used garlic powder and seasoned salt instead of the onion salt (which I did not have). This was very, very good.

Made this twice now.  The second time was on Thanksgiving.  Made it two days before and on the morning of Thanksgiving put it in my crock pot and put it on low and served it.  Delicious and everyone loved it.  Such a big help to be able to make it ahead.  Thanks.

I tried this dish today for our Thanksgiving dinner.  It has a LOT of potential to be a great dish, but next time I will definitely cut the cream cheese & sour cream portions by at least half!  It was WAY too creamy and cheesy tasting.  I'm sure that with some tweaking, it will be a great receipe to have on hand.

Instead of heating in the oven as the directions state, I put the massed potatoes in a crock pot for 4+ hours. They were like wallpaper paste. Tasted good, but not fluffy. Will make it the way the directions state next time. Should be OK to put in a crock pot for a shorter amount of time to keep warm.

I followed this exactly except used russet since store was out of yukons. While I love cream cheese, I found the tang a bit too overwhelming in the mashed potatoes.

These are perfect! I made them the day before Thanksgiving and refrigerated overnight. I place them in the crock pot the morning of Thanksgiving and heated on low for 6-7 hours.  I doubled the recipe and used russet potatoes.  I added the cream cheese and sour cream first and didn't end up needing any milk.  I didn't have onion salt, so I just used table salt.  Very rich, creamy potatoes.  This recipe is a keeper!

Jumped on this recipe for the instructions to heat them up in the Crock-Pot, which worked beautifully!  The recipe was the same as we’d been making them in our family for years, except for the addition of sour cream instead of a full cup of milk or even half and half!  We just couldn’t get past the, well, sour taste, however.  We kept adding half and half to try and sweeten them up!  Will never use the sour cream again; just isn’t to our taste.  but will always use the Crock-Pot - thanks for the great idea!  Also, instead of 2 tsp. onion salt, we use 1 each of onion and garlic powders.

This was delicious, and very easy to make. Make sure to maix the ingredients well to avoid clumps of cream cheese. I riced the potates to avoid any lumps. The make ahead option is great for a big dinner. 
thanks so much.

After cooking the potatoes I just threw everything into the bowl and mashed. I did not put in the oven. I didnt feel there was a need to do so. These were really good. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy to make.  Reheated nicely when I took it for Thanksgiving.  I thought it still needed a little butter and added maybe 1/2 a stick, despite the creaminess from the cream cheese and the "buttery" taste of the Yukon Golds.... but that's just my personal preference.  My 9-yr old said they were the best potatoes she's ever tasted.

I added freshly roasted garlic and dried basil and subbed onion salt for onion powder and salt.  My only issue was that the flavor of the cream cheese was very prevalent.  I baked a small amount in the oven for today, but will do the rest in the crockpot for thanksgiving.  Maybe the time heating will blend the flavos more. Next time I might try using a mix of goat cheese and italian cheeses.

I have made these for years; it what everyone always asks me to bring to family dinners.  I use equal parts of sour cream and cream cheese though, and add shredded cheddar cheese as well.  I then top with some shredded cheddar and bake until they are golded brown.

I found the potatoes were a little plain, but I loved that these were ready to go for Christmas dinner.  I followed the advice of some other members and re-heated the potatoes in my slow cooker.   This recipe was a real time and sanity saved.

Absolutely fantastic!  I made this when my husband's boss was coming over for dinner and he raved about them.  Only slight change I made was to combine the cream cheese, sour cream and onion salt in one bowl.  I then mashed the potatoes and added 3 Tbs butter and the milk in a separate bowl. I then combined the two - it just made it easier to stir together.  Will definitely make again.

These potatoes turned out fluffy and light and full of flavour.  Rave reviews from everyone at the table, even the little kids!! I tweaked it slightly by using only 3/4 cup sour cream and I only had a tub of garlic and herb spreadable cream cheese, so I used about 3/4 of the tub.  After they were heated through, I took the advice of a reviewer here and stirred in a little butter just before serving (only about 2 Tbs.). Turned out fabulous. Although this dish is rich and fattening and I probably won't make it often, the ease of preparation and the time and trouble it saves on the "big day" was definitely worth it. Yum!!

I made these for Easter dinner and my family loved them! I put them in a deep baking dish, which was a mistake, since they were still cold when I took them out of the oven after an hour.  But I will make these again.  They were great!

excellent recipe  try adding a pat or 2 of butter when putting in baking dish  when you heat them up, the butter disperses thru the dish and a quick stir helps too.

This was a great recipe!!  The mashed potatoes were a hit for Thanksgiving, the only thing I had to do differently was add more milk and salt.  I made them the day before Thanksgiving and then just reheated them in a crockpot.

Easy and delicious! I make them ahead of time and use the crockpot to warm them, as others have suggested. Yummy! First time I used my potato ricer. Second time just a potato masher, and just as good!

This recipe is fabulous.  I've been using one like it for years without the onion salt and sour cream.  One thing I did especially like was from member Connie who said they could be frozen.  That is great.  I have a toddler grandson who is crazy about mashed potatoes with anything you want to put on them so it will be nice to have some on tap when he comes to visit.  

I've never thought they tasted left over at all and not sure what you do to them to make them taste that way.  A wonderful taste as well as a timesaver.  Using the crockpot is huge, too, because the oven is as full as a Best Buy store on Black Thursday, especially on Thanksgiving.  Thanks for all the hints, allrecipes.com members!!  You're included in the 5 stars.

Have been using this recipe for years.   Left overs of it tastes even better as flavours have a chance to blend in.  I personally use fresh chopped onions and their greens to garnish the top.    Only thing I might recommend about the recipe itself is the change in brand of potatoes since Yukon Gold's have a tendency to turn to mush after they are boiled; so you may want to  consider adding  a few extra to the pot.

This is a great make ahead or freeze ahead recipe. I have also used French onion dip in place of the sour cream for a great change up. Love anything I can make in advance for holidays!

Tried it twice.  Don't know what I did wrong but the mashed potato was getting too dried and solid, instead of fluffy.

I prepared these ahead of time and left them to keep warm in the crock pot.  While they were quite flavorful, the texture was almost soupy. I'm thinking the crock pot added extra moisture they did not need?   They did firm up after cooling down, but next time I think I'll skip adding the milk and not hold in a crock pot.

I am so glad I found this recipe! It was a snap to prepare and absolutely delicious! I used petite Yukon gold potatoes, fat-free sour cream, and I omitted the milk.... I will definitely make these again. Thank you!

Super creamy & a huge hit.  We do think that they are better on the day that you make them instead of a day later, but they are still awesome.

I absolutely loved these mashed potatoes! I made them a day in advance for my husband's birthday party, took them out of the fridge half an hour before I wanted to cook them, stuck them in the oven for an hour (stirring every 15 minutes) and they came out just as great as if they were made the day of! The flavors were delicious! I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking to save a little time!

This recipe is awesome.  I made my potatoes early in the morning for my 4 pm Thanksgiving dinner, so all I had to do was put the pan in the oven after I took out my turkey to rest.  They were perfect.  Also, I steamed my potatoes instead of boiling them.  Steaming them helps lessen the gluey-ness of the potatoes, which I was worried about with make-ahead potatoes.  If you want to get really advanced, you can steam the potatoes and when they are about halfway cooked, you take them out and spray them with cold water to get rid of any gluey starch buildup that has started.  Then steam them again, and rinse them in cold water again when they are fully cooked.  Because this is a make-ahead recipe, this will work well because it doesn't matter if they cool off from the water.    Great recipe, definitely helped my stress level and helped me to sit with my guests and relax on Thanksgiving!

I used regular potatoes that I had on hand, one pack of fat-free cream cheese, one pack of low-fat cream cheese, and low-fat sour cream.  I reduced the onion powder and added garlic powder as others have recommended.  I cooked this dish  to take to my sister's for Christmas Eve dinner.  So, after combining, I placed potato mixture in a crockpot rather than baking in the oven. Plugged in the crock pot at my sister's house, added a dab of butter, and gave a quick stir to fluff potatoes. Everyone complimented me on these potatoes; they were delicious.

Very tasty.  If you are going to heat them for next day's use in a crock pot.  Take the potatotes out of the frig and let them warm up a bit.  You can also start the warming process by heating them in the microwave and then move them to the crockpot and top with butter.

I used bagged potatoes that I had on hand and then followed recipe for mixing. Instead of baking, I placed mashed potatoes into a crock pot since I planned to take them to a gathering on the same evening.  As others recommended, I added a small anount of butter to fluff dish just before serving.  Everyone loved these potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for Thanksgiving exactly as the recipe states because I had never made potatoes ahead before and was skeptical. I put it in a crockpot liner in the frig overnight and as it warmed it was still way too thick. I pulled out a handheld mixer and whipped in some milk until it had a nice consistancy. They were a hit!! I will make them again to save time and space in the oven. Thanks!

Will NEVER EVER make mashed potatoes the day of an event again!  I think this is a great recipe - although I would add less cream cheese, sour cream, and butter.  I was very careful with how much liquid I added - very very slowly, so I never ran into a soggy potato problem.  One idea if they do get soggy is for the last 30 minutes, crank your crock pot on high with the lid off.  A lot of the liquid will evaporate.  Just make sure to stir so it doesn't scortch.  Thanks again!!  Will use this recipe for years to come!

I make this recipe all the time and get rave reviews. The kids can't get enough of them! I have found the original recipe to be a bit dry, so I usually use half the potatoes (2.5-3 lbs.). I have also been known to add some cheddar cheese to the mix. YUM!

I made a double batch of these one day ahead for Thanksgiving supper.  I used regular white potatoes.  These turned out great, and reheated nicely the next day.  There was none leftover! This is the recipe  will use from now on for large gatherings.

I have now made these potatoes both by original recipe in casserole dish and by doing them in the crock pot.  I have to say I like them in the casserole dish.  The crockpot made them have a strange consistency.  They still tasted DELISH but for serving and presentation purposes, the casserole is the way to go!

I had friends in town from the Midwest, who are true "meat and potatoes" kind of people.  I don't make mashed potatoes often, but these were a hit.  I never knew you could reheat mashed potatoes and they would come out fluffy and light.  I impressed even myself.  This is a great make-ahead recipe.  A true time safer and a great dish!

These were good potatos. I think how they can be made in advance.

I have used this recipe for many, many years (it is a standby), but I have also made changes, e.g. used yoghurt rather than sour cream, mayonnaise instead of sour cream, but did not add the milk. Always grate in at least 3 cloves of fresh garlic.   Lots of possibilities with this recipe.   My son-in-law (who is an excellent cook) adds fresh herbs.

I made this for christmas and it was so-so.  I've never used the yukon gold, but will be using these from now on. They have just the right starch content. I was looking for something with a more buttery flavor.

My sister puts cream cheese and sour cream in her mashed potatoes and until I tried this recipe I preferred "regular" mashed potatoes. However, I served this to a group of 6 the other night, and the whole recipe (for 12 servings) vanished! I think the baking step makes a big difference. I LOVE the make-ahead aspect of this recipe - will make TODAY for Thanksgiving! Thanks Carol!

These were pretty good...they taste very similar to twice baked potatoes.  I was afraid that 8 ounces of sour cream would be too much so I only used 4oz...but I think next time I'll go for the full 8.  I will also add some chopped green onions and perhaps some cheddar cheese.

Beyond delicious, these potatoes are a literal taste explosion.  Holy cow, they are so creamy and tasty.  I used light sour cream.  I served with "Old Fashioned Chicken and Noodles" from this website, and the combination of flavors was to-die-for.

I make this recipe often, especially for monthly family gatherings! My boyfriend who cant get enough of potatoes was a bit skeptical about the ingredients in it as well as the make ahead concept. He was stunned when he tried them , just couldnt believe how good they were. I usually modify my recipes quite a bit but I didnt do anything different w/ this at all!
Love it, thanks!

I am not a big fan of mashed potatoes. They never taste right--but I love this recipe! I wan't into the make ahead thing, but after making this recipe I don't think I would hesitate to try it. I love the way the potatoes tasted! My husband couldn't get enough helpings! This is very rich, so I would suggest if you are not serving a lot of people to scale the recipe down so you don't end up with a lot of leftovers.

This is a recipe that is perfect for holidays or when having a dinner party.  The best part is all the mess is done the day before and is good days later.  I did add some milk.  Very nice flavor.

These potatoes are delicious.  Followed the recipe.  Prepared them to take to an event and not know if gravy would be provided, so potatoes had to stand alone.  Received rave reviews.  Taste is similar to fully loaded baked potatoes.  Good with or without gravy.  Family is having them for Thanksgiving.

This is a great recipe, used it today (day before Thanksgiving!) for the first time as a make-ahead. I used Idaho/Russet potatoes instead of Yukon, peeled and cut them into cubes, then left them in a bowl of water for 10-15 min. After boiling, I added the ingredients as listed, but this really needed butter to give that extra boost in flavor. I mixed in about half a stick and tasted great, so I put it in the fridge. Will take out tomorrow to bake!

I've made these potatoes twice now.  both times..pure carb heaven (:   The first time i made them ahead and baked the next day . The 2nd time i made them and baked at the same time.  there was no difference in texture or taste.  i mixed the potatoes, sour cream and cream cheese in my heavy duty mixer, and this made it so easy.  The 2nd time i added a few spices, and it just made it better.  so i recommend making these potatoes per the recipe the first time and making it your own after that.  can't get enough of these potatoes!

I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled it. It served 16 people with leftovers.  Made it the day before thanksgiving and heated it up in the crockpot for 4 hours on low before serving. Potatoes were piping hot, fluffy and creamy. Will make again.

I only make this recipe for Holidays and love it. Make it the day before eliminates one more thing you have to do the day of the Holiday.  I do not bake it in the oven at all.  If you have a large crowd you need to make 10 lbs.  I put it in the fridge over night and then put in my slow cooker add a little butter on top and warm it up the next day.  Taste just like freshly made mashed potatoes.  Delicious big hit not bland at all.

Made this for Christmas and Thanksgiving last year. I added minced garlic. Was to die for. Also left some potatoes unpeeled gave added texture the first time. Second time around I used red potatoes, that was the prefered batch.

I've been making this dish for almost 30 years! Instead of onion salt, I use celery salt to taste and a tablespoon or so of dried onion flakes, You can make these and freeze them for Thanksgiving or for any day for that matter. I melt a stick of butter and pour over the top before freezing and pop them in the oven for about 1 hour at 350*. My favorite potato recipe.

I have made this twice now, the first time exactly as is, the second time I substituted butter for the sour cream and milk and garlic salt for the onion salt.  (That was all I had on hand)  Both times were great, but the original is best.

I made these the day before Thanksgiving and put them in my slow cooker on low for about 4 hours before the dinner. They were thick and goopy...very disappointed. Sorry, but I can't waste my money on this recipe again.

Such a time saver, and the potatoes were the hit of the meal!  I made them a few days ahead, stored them in a large zip lock bag in the fridge and then warmed them up in the Crockpot on Thanksgiving Day.  If I do it again, I may reduce the amount of milk only because the crockpot caused them to get a little runny.  Still, it's a great recipe.

This was very bland for my taste. Maybe tomorrow when I add gravy it'll spruce it up...but it certainly cannot stand on it's own without gravy. I won't use this recipe again.

We've been making a very similar recipe for years. This is great if you need to prepare ahead for Christmas or Thanksgiving. I would highly doubt if anyone would be able to tell they weren't mashed that very day.

I have been using this recipe for mashed pots for years. The order in which you add ingredients matters in this recipe. If you like creamy mashed potatoes, mash the potatoes first, by themselves, then add the remaining ingredients. Also, to take these over the top, sauté grated or finely chopped onion in butter, and add to potatoes with cream cheese and sour cream (1/2 medium onion to 3-4 tablespoons butter). So good.

I just made this recipe tonight.  It was super delicious but I didn't have any sour cream and I didn't want to have to go to the store in the rain...I eliminated it and it was still great.  I did add some garlic, onion and parsley and it was divine.  I made fresh and probably would eat leftover but wouldn't serve to any dinner guests that way.  Overall, great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

11/24/16 - made again per recipe, two blocks cream cheese is a little too much and not needed.  Warmed up in a crock pot for 4+ hours and it was ready to go.  Delicious, easy and served with Chef John's turkey and crock pot stuffing.

11/24/12 - So easy to make ahead, warmed up great in the crock pot - only change was just one block of cream cheese instead of two and used low-fat cream cheese and sour cream!  Yum!

These were great, a little stiff, but I am not sure if we used enough milk (just added with out measuring). Used regular salt and no onion salt, still tasted very nice. We made these early in the morning and put them into a crock pot to warm them and keep them warm.

These are requested all the time.... They are now dubbed by all: Wendi's mashed potatoes. Love this recipe. I will often add a clove of fresh crushed garlic and sometimes (gasp!) I will add some butter for moisture.

I made a LOT of ingredient substitutions on this one (last minute decision, had to go with what we had), so this review is mostly for the method used here, and not the flavors.  I was really pleased with how these came out!  I didn't add as much milk as recommended and was worried that they'd dry out in the oven, but they didn't; they were a little more solid than my regular mashed potatoes, but far from dry.  So I'd advise making them to your desired consistency and flavor before baking, or just a tiny bit wetter.  (FWIW, I used goat cheese instead of cream cheese, reduced fat sour cream, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper instead of onion salt, and a big spoonful of whatever psuedo-butter-in-a-tub is currently in our fridge.  I'd totally recommend any of those changes, but I'd also like to try the recipe as written.)

This is a great recipe. Saves lots of time on busy days. I've made this recipe using the crock pot and oven, and both ways yield fantastic potatoes. I added  pats of butter to the top before baking. In the crock pot, I heated on low for about 6 hours (for 14 serving) and they were piping hot.

it was great and worked wonderful in the crockpot. Cooked it long and the bottom got a light brown, which was a hit with my Mother in law. All around a crowd pleaser.

Really great recipe. I liked that I could make it the day before so all I had to do the next day was the turkey.
Thanks for a great recipe!

Just made these, and used lite sour cream, lite cream cheese, and skim milk to bring down the fat level, but they still tasted awesome.  Easy to prepare and I only made 1/2 the recipe, as it was only for 2 of us.  Will make again, specially for a party, as you can make ahead of time and pop in oven when you're ready.

A great recipe for a large amount of people. A huge time saver for sure!They heat up terrifically. I added alot more butter, and will probably cut down the sour cream next time I fix it.

I have made this recipe for many years and always have good results.  I double the recipe, add one crushed clove of garlic for each potato, and reheat in the slow cooker.  A real keeper.  (I love Trader Joe's frozen garlic for this--no muss, no fuss!)

Yummy! I used Russet potatoes and split it into two dishes since it made such a huge amount. I "baked" them in the microwave for 25 minutes at 50% power. Fabulous!

Making 5lbs of mashed potatoes was a lot of work since there's an additional hour of baking. My mixer could barely hold all these ingredients. I wasn't about to mix it by hand. Tastes great, but substitue with fat-free cream cheese!

I made these potatoes for Christmas Dinner & everyone loved them! I used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese & also added a half stick of unsalted butter before baking. This recipe will definitely be made again!

I LOVED these!!!  Couldn't stop eating them!  In the future I'll use only half Yukon Golds b/c ppl were afraid the color came from tons of butter.  It's rather tangy, which might not be universally loved so next time I will use less sour cream and adjust to taste.  I substituted the milk w/rice milk and used some Neufantel cheese (~2/3 of what was request) and light cream cheese to save on calories.  I plan in the future to melt a bit a butter for the top and then place it under the broiler during the last 5 mins of reheating.

I toned my down to about 4 servings.  I used russets instead of Yukon Golds. I also added bacon bits, it all came out too dry but I think next time I will start with the orginal recipe again.  I may have been jaded by all the reviews to be honest!

I used yukons, didn't peel them, added chopped chives & I only used one pkg of cream cheese (actually I used nuefatchel). The taste of these was superb but they were quite a bit heavier the next day after being reheated. Not that I will let that keep me from making them again. ;o) I loved having them made up ahead of time...thanks Carol Evans!

considering mashed poatoes have never been a part of our traditional Thanksgiving dinner, I was worried they wouldn't go over well with my family - but I was sure wrong! I'm definitely making them again next year. I thought they were just okay as far as mashed potatoes go, but I can't deny that making them ahead was a huge time-saver.

Excellent!  Very worth while not having to peel and mash the potatoes the day of the big dinner.  I used garlic poweder and next time, I would definitely try sour cream with chives or a flavored cream cheese.

We haven't eaten these beyond tasting yet - but just the tastes were fantastic!  We made a double batch (lemme tell ya' - that's a lotta potatoes) to freeze for our big Christmas dinner.  We'll defrost and heat in the oven just like it calls for.  Yum!  Thanks!

This was an easy and fast way to do mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving.  It freed up the stove and was quick to heat up in the micro.

I could have eaten this whole dish by myself, it was that good! Very simple to make and tasted delicious even though I made it 1 day before Thanksgiving. I used 1 (8oz.) brick of cream cheese because it was easier...and how can you have too much cream cheese? :) Thanks for this new staple in my recipe box!

These are a LIFESAVER! Even the mashed potato challenged can make these. I have NEVER had a problem with them being glue-y or starchy. Delicious flavor. This is my third Thanksgiving that I will use this recipe. People always ask for the recipe!

Great freezer recipe.  I like OAMC and I freeze this in smaller portions for a quick side to a meal.  Can be reheated by either microwave or oven.  Be sure to stir before serving.

I made these for company and also added a can of fried onions - half in the mixture and baked - and before it was done, sprinkled the other half on top and finished baking.  All my guests loved it.

I made this recipe - using 10 pounds of potatoes - for a group of about 15 guys.  They used all left overs the next day from their dinner.  The potatoes were just as good the next day.  Now, two weeks later, they go around saying, "We need potatoes casserole".  They gourged on potatoes.  This is a great recipe and it is great to make a couple of days ahead or the same day.  Just bake and serve - The left overs are just as great tasting the next time they are warmed.

I made these the night before Thanksgiving and popped them in the oven for 30 minutes with a few pats of butter on top.  The texture was great and I loved the convenience, but I found the flavor a little lacking.  I will probably try it again and use garlic salt instead of onion salt.

This is the second make ahead mashed potatoes recipes I've tried, and we've really enjoyed both.  What pleased me the most about this one (besides the taste) is that it specified 5lbs of potatoes (vs. 9 potatoes, as the other one states).

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and although it was nice to have them done ahead of time, the last thing I needed was to have
another thing to put in my oven while making
a turkey, other casseroles, and baking rolls.
Nobody commented specifically about the potatoes being different...once gravy was used
I don't think anyone even noticed.

This was a huge disappointment. Made it the day before. Followed the recipe and it came out dry. We originally gave it three stars then we reheated it last night and we had to add about a cup of milk unless we wanted to be eating dry potatoes. I'll keep looking for a better mashed potatoe recipe than this one.

I couldn't believe how many compliments I recieved for these mashed potatoes!  I used light cream cheese & sour cream, but added dots of butter on top when baking in the oven.  It really helped out to make these ahead of time!  I'll be using these in the future.

This recipe was awesome with Iowa pork steaks (also in allrecipes.com)!  The gravy from the pork steaks was soooo good with the mashed potatoes.  I added about 6 mashed roasted garlic cloves to this, and it was really flavorful!

I made these for our Thanksgiving Dinner.  Convenient to make the day ahead and my family raved that these were the best potatoes they ever had. They stay creamy and are absolutely delicious. PS-I did add some roasted garlic to them.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner this year and it was just fabulous! The whole family enjoyed it. Being able to make it the day before, then bring it to where we were going to bake it made everything much easier. I will certainly be making this for Christmas! Thanks!

A definite time-saver! And ohhhh so good! I put dollops of butter along the top when baking. Make sure to cover with foil when baking.

The addition of cream cheese keeps the color and texture appealing.  Making the potatoes ahead of time allows the cook to concentrate on other last minute preparations.

Extremely creamy. I think most people would like this as is; I would make again but would use half the cream cheese. I would prefer the potato taste to be more dominant over the cream cheese and sour cream.

These mashed potatoes were a big hit at a family dinner.  And what a lifesaver being able to make it ahead!  They definitely tasted freshly mashed and delicious.  I made according to recipe and heated in the oven according to recipe and they came out just right.

Make ahead mashed potatoes are a great way to prepare for a big dinner get together.  I had a dinner for 45 people.  I kept these potatoes warm in a crock pot.  Very tasty too.

Great. Don't overcook the potatoes, or it will be difficult to separate them from the water.  Mine were a bit wet,  so I baked the finished casserole in the oven without a lid, to dry then out a bit. I used a stand mixer to thoroughly mix the sour cream,  cream cheese,  and 1/2 cup butter. Then I manually mashed and stirred in the potatoes. Don't mix the potatoes with the mixer, as that produces too much gluten and will make the potatoes sticky/stretchy. I did not add milk, having used butter instead. I was in a rush and timed myself, starting from nonwashed whole potatoes to ready to serve dish, did take a full 1hr 20 min. I did not peel my red potatoes.

Absolutely the best mashed potatoes we have ever made. I made them a day ahead, put them overnight in my refrigerator, and put them in the slow cooker the next morning. All I had to do was stir them a couple of times. I will always make mashed potatoes using this recipe.

This is a great recipe especially for a meal where you have a lot to do at the last moment.  We just used it for Thanksgiving and my husband is already requesting it for whenever I make mashed potatoes.  I made it as written, but didn't have onion salt, so just added onion powder and salt.  Everyone raved about it.  I will definitely be making it again.

The 15 lbs of potatoes I made in to this recipe are now in the compost, and undoubtedly the dirt produced by them will taste better than these sour, inedible things. We had to replace them with bob Evans microwave potatoes....on Thanksgiving.....Whomever gave this recipe 5 stars have to be bots

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used small gold thin-skinned potatoes and left the skins on. Great flavor and reheated nicely the next day. I’m making it again for the holidays and will reheat in a slow cooker.

I’ve made this recipe for Thanksgiving for years. It gets rave reviews and is now a staple on my holiday table. I make it a day or two ahead and then let it come to room temperature before I heat it. It’s a lot of potatoes and takes a long time to heat all the way through. I learned that lesson the first time I made it!

I have made this several times at Thanksgiving.  I can make a day or two ahead.  Thanksgiving morning I just take the potatoes out of the fridge, put in the crock pot and turn on low heat.  By 2 pm dinner time these are ready to go.

They do have a bit of a cream cheese flavor.  There is another Make Ahead Mashed Potato recipe on this site with not as many reviews without cream cheese that I may try next time.

I have made a variation on these potatoes for many years. Once substituted regular yogurt for sour cream - not a good idea.
Now wondering if anyone has tried using the Greek yogurt in place of sour cream - I am using this substitution in many other recipes with great results and lower calories.

This is my go-to recipe for make ahead mashed potatoes.  I've made them for holiday meals for the past several years.  I use 6 pounds of potatoes since that fills my casserole dish better.  I only alter the milk if they look dry.  I typically use half russet potatoes because they're bigger and I dislike peeling the potatoes.  I haven't noticed any great change in taste.  
If you refrigerate overnight, definitely pull out of fridge early before cooking- I've had to microwave them because the rest of the  meal was ready, but the potatoes were still cold.

This is the BEST make ahead recipe I have found but the onion salt MUST be omitted!  Once that is gone, the taste is wonderful!  Best part is that no one knows that they were made ahead of time!

These are the potatoes we make every year 
Make ahead, put in zip lock baggies, flatten them out and stack in refrigerator. We make at least 30 pounds. Great to make , up to a week ahead. We always reheat in buttered crock pot( 4 hrs) stir occasionally.

This is so easy and so delicious.  It is the only way I will make mashed potatoes in the future for guests.  I added chapped fresh chives to give it color and flavor we like.  It looked beautiful and tasted great.  I cut the recipe in half and it served 6 easily.  Try it you will love it!

I have made this recipe for years.  No sour cream, but butter and cream cheese.  I cook my potatoes in chicken bouillon for extra flavor!

I make these  year round. It's a very  flexible  recipe, I sometimes  switch the sour cream with  greek yogurt,  use part  cream cheese, part other  cheeses  like  cheddar , Italina  blend - whatever is on hand. also skip the  sour cream and  use cottage cheese  sometimes. I season  as I would  for  freshkly made .

This is awesome! The first time I made it, I couldn't find my onion powder, so I used garlic powder instead - and have made it multiple times that way ever since. I'm sure it tastes great with onion powder, but just so other cooks know - you can substitute garlic powder if you want.

I made these for Thanksgiving 2016 and plan to make them for Christmas and every family meal forever. I used heavy cream instead of milk just because I can splurge for the holidays. My guests raved about this rich creamy potato dish. I highly recommend this make ahead recipe!

I made these for thanksgiving this year, 2016, and I had to throw them away. The only change I made was using red potatoes. These not only tasted overloaded with sour cream but they turned into clumps of clay overnight. I think I'll use a different recipe and sticky to using Yukon gold potatoes.

This is a no brainer for ease and flavor. I made no changes but many options could easily be applied such as roasted garlic or blue cheese. If you don't own a ricer, make it your next gadget purchase. Perfect every time out

Excellent and easy make-ahead recipe! I used russet potatoes, 1 8 oz. pack of cream cheese, onion powder + salt instead of the onion salt and garlic powder.  Made a day ahead and heated for a couple hours in the crockpot with some butter toward the end.  Creamy and delicious.  Everyone loved it!

I LOVE Allrecipes! It is my go-to resource for user-friendly, accessible recipes. I love the format, the large library of recipes for any given dish, the user review forum, the easy printable features, and on and on. Sure, I also like Food Network and many of the specialty websites (especially for ethnic fare), and The New York Times has some recipes and technique tips that really rock. But Allrecipes is my mainstay.

I love these mashed potatoes.  I make them every Thanksgiving, and I also bring them if going to a Thanksgiving potluck.  You can make them even 2-3 days ahead and they taste great, but I normally make them the night before...saves a bunch of time for cooking other Thanksgiving food.  For potlucks, I bring them in a slow cooker...just warm them up with a half stick of butter on top.

I did not care for these as the cream cheese and sour cream overpowered the taste of the potatoes, in my opinion. My husband, however, really liked them.

These were delicious & easy. Made these for Thanksgiving, but they will be a regular at my house, we love mashed potatoes! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used russet potatoes, & instead of baking in the oven I put them in my crock pot on low for a few hours. I used a crock pot liner for easy clean up

I basically eye-balled everything but the ingredients themselves were used.   Only change was to use chopped chives in place of the onion powder.  I prepared the dish the night before thanksgiving and baked the next day.  This was so convenient, they tasted great, and I popped it into the oven while my turkey was resting.   I could easily see how this could be made ahead then placed in small serving bowls and frozen for a quick dinner.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Excellent recipe!  I only used 1 (8 oz) brick of cream cheese and added minced garlic.  I didn't have any onion powder but I did add some chopped, fresh chives instead.  Very creamy and delicious.  I also had about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth that I was looking to get rid of and rather than pouring it down the sink, I added it to the potatoes.  I made the morning of Thanksgiving and put into a crock pot and kept in the refrigerator until about 4 hours before we are planning to eat.

Very good and it made it so much easier to do ahead of time. I also threw it in the blender with some half and half to make them smooth and creamy. Reheated them in the crockpot with a stick of butter for 3 hours. Yumm

My mother-in-law, who is known to many as a fabulous cook, has been making this recipe for years.   She also adds 2 Tbsp butter and sometimes shredded  cheddar cheese on top.  I like to put in crockpot for 3 hours on low.

I made this recipe last year and it was a hit.  I made the day before Thanksgiving and stored in my crockpot in the refrigerator overnight.  Took out in the morning and turned the crockpot on low for about an hour, gave a good stir and then up to high for an hour and then back to low and the potatoes were perfectly heated and fluffy for our 1:00 p.m. dinner.  I will definitely make again this year.  I highly recommend using Yukon Gold even though they are more expensive and leave the skin on.   The only other change - I may have added a couple teaspoons garlic salt.  And also you must use a potato masher and not your mixer.  Save the mixer for dessert!!

This is delicious and perfect for make ahead meals. The whole family loved it. My picky grandson even went back for seconds. I used minced garlic in place of onion salt & used an 8 oz brick of reduced fat cream cheese instead of 6 oz. I didn't measure anything & it turned out great. I mixed it all in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer mixing potatoes & milk on low. I scraped down the sides & added remaining ingredients. Scrape down again then mix it on high for a smooth consistency. These are thick potatoes that reheat very well in microwave or crock pot.

Great recipe!! Tasted amazing! Never made overnight mashed potatoes before, so I was a little cautious and followed original recipe. Turned out great! I will definately make this again.Saved me a lot of time on Thanksgiving Day....

Why, oh, why has it taken me so long to try this dish?   Stellar results.  I'm never going to rush around mashing the potatoes at the last minute again.

These are easy I've made than the last two years!  I preferred to go very easy on the garlic salt and instead use regular salt.  Make them ahead and throw them in the crockpot with some extra milk to heat up on Thanksgiving day.

My family only wants these potatoes for holidays.  I tried this recipe because you can do it ahead and that way you can concentrate on other things the day of.
I am handicapped and it has been awesome not to overdue it during dinners.  THey love the taste and we had different cheeses to change it up depending on the occasion. 
I have double and tripled this recipe and put it in zip lock bags to freeze.  Freeze in different size bags depending on how many you will be serving.  For one days work you can have alot of sides for meals.

I made these for my daughter's birthday dinner. Followed the recipe except used 1 teaspoon of minced garlic in the water while boiling the potatoes.  Also used half and half for the milk. My family raved after them. This will definitely be a holiday keeper! Thank you so much for this  recipe.

I read the other reviews before making this, and therefore lowered the amount of cream cheese I used - and it still turned out too "cream cheese" tasting. Not a huge hit at Thanksgiving, I wouldn't make again.

Made this recipe this morning for Thanksgiving and after mixing potatos,cream cheese and butter I found that I didn't need any milk, they seemed a little running. Also didn't add the sour cream. Have them in the crockpot to keep warm till dinner and hoping they will stiffen up some while waiting.

When I added this recipe to my recipe box and discovered I had used it last year, I decided it was time to categorize my recipes to prevent duplication. Obviously, we enjoy these potatoes. This is a simple and good recipe that eliminates last minute hustle; true comfort food.

UPDATE: FROZE LEFTOVERS AND PULLED THEM OUT OF THE FREEZER A FEW DAYS AGO TO THAW. HAD THESE TONIGHT WITH DINNER, AND ALTHOUGH GOOD, THEY ARE MUCH BETTER FRESH, IMHO. Yum! My fiance, a confirmed sour cream AND cream cheese HATER even liked these!After prepping, I asked my fiance to try a spoonful. I didn't tell him that I added anything but milk and seasoning.... Once I "disclosed" what I HAD added, he commented that the texture was "wierd," (I can't win lol!) but happily had seconds at dinner :) Our dinner guests had thirds!!! My only change (which subtly enhanced the end procuct, IMHO) was to add 4 LARGE cloves of garlic which I boiled with my potatoes. NOTE: You MUST use Yukon Gold potatoes. They are buttery and what gives this dish its creamy texture. These were the perfect complement to my pot roast dinner. Not only are these excellent to make on special occansions, they are also great anytime you need to prep ahead of time, especially during the holiday season. For that reason alone, these are deserving of 10 stars! Thanks for sharing, Carol!

These were ok...I give it 4 stars for the flavor and ease of doing it ahead of time. However, I thought the texture was lacking. Maybe I just don't like Yukon Gold Potatoes; they seem "gummy" to me. Or maybe I mixed everything too much?  I may try it again using regular old russets.

Delicious! My guests raved about them! Didn't have onion salt, so I used regular salt.  The potatoes I used seemed dry, so I added a little more milk to get the right consistency.  I prefer my potatoes light and fluffy. I made my casserole earlier in the day. What a time saver it was.   This will be my regular recipe for mashed potatoes.

These potatoes were a hit with my family. They rated them a "10". I loved being able to make ahead and heat later. Thanks. We will make these again and again.

I made these potatoes for Easter Dinner and we really enjoyed them.  I did cut the recipe in half because there were only four of us, and had plenty for leftovers.  This will be my new go-to mashed potato recipe for big holiday dinners.  Definitely cuts my time in the kitchen on the day of the big meal.

Have made this several times and always tastes great.   Best thing is that they can be made ahead of time.

I cut the recipe in half, everyone seem to like them. No one seemed to taste the sour cream or cream cheese but I did. Will probably make again, thanks for the post.

These were really great.  I tasted them fresh, and loved them.  I put them in the fridge overnight and had them in the oven a little too long the next day when I baked them, and they dried out on top.  That was my fault though.  I used light cream cheese and light sour cream, and red potatoes.  Yummy mashed potatoes!

I really liked the taste of this dish.  I agree that it is not the same is traditonal Sunday whipped potatoes, but is a great alternative when time is an issue.  I made this for Christmas, and my whole family enjoyed it.  I did add a bit of milk to them so they weren't quite so dense as I heated them up.

Absolutely Fantastic. I didn't have onion salt, so I used 2 tsp of onion powder and 1 tsp of salt. I miss them when they're gone.

I thought these were very tasty!  I used fat-free sour cream, and reduced-fat cream cheese, and then baked them (covered) the next day.  They were fluffy and not dry at all.  My 10 month old and three year old ate them up, and normally mashed potatoes are very unappealing to them.  I will definately make these again!

These are sooooo delicious!  They were a huge hit when I cooked for a crowd ~ very easy too.  I added bacon to mine also which made them even more sinful.  We all have to indulge now and then right?  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

Was okay. Took up more room in the oven
and if you need to heat up other stuff will take longer to heat up potatoes.
If you have to do potatoes ahead of time
might want to try something in the crock pot.

These were absolutely wonderful.  Very fresh tasting and everyone raved.  I did use a food mill and they were oh-so creamy and melted in your mouth.  I also added some sauteed shallots and garlic.  Yum.  Thanks so much Carol.

These mashed potatoes are delicious! I used garlic salt instead of onion salt. I made them for my family's Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit!

I served this recipe (12 servings)as a Thanksgiving "trial" to a dinner group of 6 adults and it was almost ALL gone, mostly because the men in the group ate 2 huge servings each. It will be a big help this Thanksgiving not to have to be peeling potatoes the "day of". It tastes a lot like twice-baked potatoes; you have to like sour cream and cream cheese. I didn't have any onion salt so used onion powder and salt. I whipped the potatoes with an electric mixer. Texture was perfect.

OH MY GOODNESS - these are the best!  They were completely gobbled up at my Thanksgiving party - next time I will make MORE!  Everyone complememented them, and making them a couple of days early made everything so much easier!  Will definitely be making these again.  I added a couple of pats of butter on top when reheating.  Wonderful!!!!  Thanks Carol.

These are fabulous. Creamy and wonderful. My kids love them and they normally don't like "real" mashed potatoes since I like to leave them a little lumpy. These were all gone!

I've made this dish at least 10 times now.  Any time I've had left-overs, those are gone by the next night.  My fiance and I both HATE onions, so I sub the 2 tbs of onion salt with one tb salt and one tb garlic powder.  We love it!!!

I served this dish for Thanksgiving and everyone liked it.  I liked the fact that I could make them the night before and then reheat without that "leftover" flavor.  Thanks!
