This was the quickest meal I've ever made in my life. My husband loved it too. Usually, I do dishes and chores around the kitchen while things are cooking. This was ready before I even knew what happened. This recipe is a keeper!

I made a meatless version of this and used four finger eggplant, sliced instead of the Bison. Everything else I followed the recipe. The flavor was SPOT ON! Used elbows and cooked for 4 minuets in my new Pampered Chef Quick Cooker......
 Loved by the whole family??

Very easy and flavorful.  I followed the recipe and took the suggestion to use roasted garlic powder.  Will definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe in an 8 qt instapot, did not realize these recipes were made for smaller instapots.  
Especially, pay attention to the water.  Pasta soaked it up pretty fast and the pot signaled 'burn'.   
Recipe was good,  season to taste..

I just made this recipe tonight! I was super bummed only because my boyfriend and I could not find fresh basil anywhere! So we had to improvise, it was still the best meal ever! I’m sure it’s so much better with the fresh basil which I know where to go next time to get it because they always have fresh there but super quick which I loved! And super good! This is definitely a keeper for us!

Easier than I thought. My first recipe I made in my new insta pot. It turned out great. Topped it off with cheese after dishing it up.
