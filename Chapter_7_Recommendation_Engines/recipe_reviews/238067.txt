This recipe is good for those nights when you don't have a lot of time or don't really feel like cooking!  It turned out quite good.  I only had a pound of frozen baby shrimp on hand, so I wound up halving the recipe and using it as a filling for shrimp fajitas.  I also kicked it up a little with about a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

I made half a recipe and followed it to a T.  We use a similar recipe on this site that uses more lime (and a marinade time before grilling) that we enjoy more.  We may have again on days when grilling isn't an option and allow the shrimp to marinate for about 15 minutes before cooking.

I added one more juiced lime to this and grilled the shrimp. They were terrific.

I added butter and a little grey poupon mustard.  Only had dried cilantro on hand, I'm sure it would be much better with fresh.  Used juice of a whole lime.  Served over Thai thin rice noodles and garnished with chopped scallions.  Very good.  Would be great for a quick week night meal.  Might add some red pepper flakes next time.

Very Good and easy to make. I doubled the lime juice and keep the cilantro to a minimum not to overwhelm the shrimp

This recipe was great for a quick meal although I really didn’t feel like cooking! Super easy and very tasty! I had everything already on hand, including fresh cilantro from my garden. I like A LOT of cilantro & lime, so I used more than the recipe called for. Freshly ground pepper also gives it a nice spiciness! My Husband was very impressed with this quick and delicious meal, this will become one of my go to’s for so

So delicious! I added green onions and red pepper flakes to spice it up, also cooking short grain organic brown rice. Will be making this again for sure.

I expected this to be good, but it was great. The ingredient list is short. The cooking technique is simple. I doubled the lime and cilantro. Eveyone wanted seconds!

I originally decided to make this because it looked easy and I had plenty of shrimp in the freezer and really had no expectations for the dish. I was very pleasantly surprised. The cilantro and lime was a nice fresh taste.  My shrimp were large and my cooking time was slightly longer. Will definitely make this again.

This is a tasty shrimp dish. My mistake was not using more lime juice, because I liked the acidity it added to the shrimp.
