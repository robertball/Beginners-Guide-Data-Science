Loved it...the pork was tender and juicy and mighty tasty!!  The only thing I changed was I didn't have any cayenne or pepper blend seasoning so I just used Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herbs and like I said it was wonderful.  My whole family enjoyed it!!  I will be making it again...thanks soooo much for sharing :>)

Good flavoring. Easy! Needed to cook longer than 20 min in my oven. I sliced it up and served it with a mixed green salad with dill and cilantro, tomatoes, corn, green peppers and feta. Didn't need the dressing because the meat was so juicy but my boyfriend put a little bit of ranch on it and really liked it.

Good and easy. I used cayenne pepper and it was SPICY! Okay for us, but take it easy if you are the sensitive type. Thanks for the recipe!
