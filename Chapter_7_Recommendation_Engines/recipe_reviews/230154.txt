Interesting recipe.  For sure needs more salt than called for...a little bland.  It was  very mild on the spicy scale.  I am a little leary of cooking raw meat in the sauce and using the sauce afterwards...good flavor all in all.  Fun recipe to make. You need to have lots of prep time though.

I did like the taste of the dish, but the texture and consistency of the meatballs were too soggy and some of the meatballs broke down in the soup/sauce.  I would have preferred to have cooked the meatballs in a separate pan first to get a good sear on the outside, and then put the meatballs in the sauce for a while. Then, the meatballs are less likely to meld into the soup/sauce. I would have also held back a little with the vegetable oil. I would have maybe added one or two tablespoons of oil, instead of three.  Lastly, I would have added more chipotle peppers and  garlic to the whole dish. My family prefers bold flavors. Otherwise, this was a good recipe for Mexican food.

I made this with ground turkey instead of the beef and it's much leaner and flavorful. It needs a little more as far as spices go and goes well with rice, Spanish or white, and corn tortillas.

These had very nice flavor but were a little hard to work with and the texture of the meatball was not what I'm used to. It may have been the pork, since I have not previously made meatballs with anything but beef. The meat mix was very wet and loose and the sauce was very thin. Regardless, I was able to carefully form the balls and they cooked fine in the sauce without breaking apart. I am not sure they would have handled stacking and stirring so I only had room to cook half in a single layer. I baked the rest of the meatballs. The puree that mixes in with the meat has a pretty nice flavor that might do well in other dishes(minus the egg). I found this to be on the mild to medium heat side so I wouldn't shy away from the chipotles. Half a batch made forty meatballs.
