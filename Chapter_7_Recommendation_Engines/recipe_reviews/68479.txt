DIVINE!  I used 6 pieces of boneless chicken, 1.5 cups CHARDONNAY (this white is drier than say a sweet Reisling - DRY is KEY!), 1 cup stock, 6 garlic cloves. You need to give the sauce time to thicken once you add the cream. I mixed my leftover chicken, sauce, & rice altogether and saved it for lunch the next day - but I ended up eating it before bed it was so good!!!!!!!

I just finished eating this, and I gotta give it 5 stars. It was really tasty and fairly easy to prepare. The one complaint I have about the recipe is the ingredients list 1 tsp each of salt & pepper and the recipe doesn't tell you what to do with them. I added them to sauce while it was reducing and that worked out well for me. Maybe that's why other reviewers thought the sauce was bland - it would have been without the S&P. I thought the consistency of the sauce was perfect, like gravy. I didn't serve with rice, I did pasta with tomato sauce instead and it didn't really go well with the chicken. Next time I will serve with garlic mashed potatoes - it would be fantastic with the sauce!

Looked good, but I don't like gummy chicken skin.  Instead of following the recipe directions exactly, I cooked the chicken, removed it to a warmer just before finishing, deglazed the pan and proceeded with the sauce directions. When the sauce was reduced to just the right consistency (coated the back of a spoon), I popped the chicken breasts under the broiler to crisp the skin. Pretty plating helped me to avoid mushing the crisp skin: layer the sauce over the plate, add mashed potatoes slightly off center, prop the chicken up against the potatoes and drizzle a little extra sauce over the potatoes. Garnish with chopped fresh scallion and some smoked paprika  and you've got a winner!

This was excellent.  I  cut down on the fat a little, such as frying in a smaller amount of butter mixed with olive oil, then drained the fat off before proceeding. The sauce turned out fine in terms of thickness.  The key is to reduce the broth quite a bit before adding any cream.  I would serve this to guests any time.  The chicken was succulent and tender. We had it with steamed baby potatos instead of rice.  This one's a  keeper for me!

This is not the Portugese Chicken recipe that Vavo use to make. This is EASY and very TASTY. I did not use butter and used just a little olive oil. I also replaced the cream with tomato sauce. Even my picky children ate every bite and the hubby made sure he wiped up all the sauce on his plate with a nice crusty slice of bread. This is definetly a keeper. Thanks.

This smelled heavenly while cooking.  I guess I was expecting a bit of a thicker sauce, but it was still tasty.  Subbed apple juice for the white wine.  Great flavor on the chicken.

This dish turned out delicious. My husband and I loved it. I prepared it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder. Sauteed the chicken with plenty of minced garlic. Instead of white wine I used apple cider... the sauce turned out perfect, so very tasty.

Oh my gosh, this is phenomenal. I used just two bone-in chicken breasts, but the full amount of sauce as well as three cups of cooked rice. I'm so glad I made the extra sauce. I cheated and used half and half instead of the heavy cream, but stirred in a bit of corn starch to help it thicken. I also added some sliced mushrooms that I needed to use up. All I can say is wow. I may try boneless, skinless chicken breasts next time, though. I feel like the bone and the skin are not crucial, although they probably do add a lot of flavor. SO GOOD!!! Thanks so much for the recipe.

This was a savory recipe.  The sauce was a little thin but that was my fault.  I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream to cut the calories and 1/2 the butter and replaced it with olive oil. So I added a little more flour. It was still wonderful. Really nice flavor. I doubled the sauce like others suggested as I also added some chicken thighs. My son had 2 big helpings.  I will be making this again! Thanks!

I liked it because it was easy and fun to make. I substituted the wine with apple juice and 1TBSP of semi-salted butter instead of the recommended amount of butter with the hopes of reducing the amount of sodium. It still turned out tender and tasty. Everybody loved it.

My entire family loved this. As the cook, I thought it was exceptionally easy too.  After reacing other reviews, I expected the sauce to be on the thin side, but it turned out thick and rich.  It was delicious served over rice.

This dish..though I was a little hesitant at first...came out fantastic! For those of you who did not use bone-in with skin, you are certainly not getting the full effect. I used 5 garlic cloves when cooking the chicken, and did not have a lid for the skillet I used, so I had to use tin foil...never have I cooked a more juicy, perfect piece of chicken...it was to die for. After removing the chicken (mine only needed 30 mins), I sprinkled a bit of garlic salt and cracked pepper over the mixture before adding the cream...and I didn't quite boil down to 1 1/2 C, I just used a bit more heavy cream and a little more patience (I would advise you use at least 2 cups of the liquid anyway, you might need the extra gravy..why not? You're already consuming most of your caloric intake for the day!). This dish does take awhile to complete. I served this over homemade garlic mashed potatoes and I don't know what could be more fitting, but if you're more of a rice person, I'm sure its just as great with the sauce. If your sauce is runny, like alot of people have mentioned, I would highly advise that when its at a point that its coating your spoon adequately,  take the pan off, remove the chicken and set the pan aside for about 10 mins...the sauce will thicken upon standing. Thanks for the great recipe!

Holy cow- this is an amazing dish! I used only two breasts but kept the same amount of sauce and we could have even eaten more sauce! I added about 4 more garlic cloves (some chopped up) and salted and peppered the sauce. I served it with roasted green beans which was a nice compliment to all that flavor. Broiling the chicken after cooking it was also a good suggestion. That way it was crispy but also full of deliciousness. Wow this is really a gourmet meal.

I had to make some changes: I used boneless skinless chicken breast,minced the garlic,added some corn starch and I didn't really measure anything.  I did take somebody's note on using a pan just big enough to hold the chicken.  The chicken cooked more than 45 minutes and was tender as could be.  When I took it out, the 'sauce' was all cooked away so I just whipped up some more real quick.  Oh yeah, I also pounded and floured the chicken with some spices also.  Next time I will incorporate some sauted onions.  Thanks:o)

This was really good, but like the others I found that the sauce was a little too thin- I used about a tablespoon of corn starch mixed with a little water to thicken at the end. I also used fat free half & half instead of cream, which may have kept it from thickening. I made no other changes to the recipe, and we loved it!

WOW!!! This dish was great!  The chicken turned out tender and juicy and the sauce made my mouth water while it simmered in the skillet.  I added a dash of paprika to the chicken while it was browning and a half cup more of white wine to the sauce.  I served this dish over brown rice and it was fantastic!  The bonus...my four year old loved it!!!

This was very good, creamy and had a nice flavor.  Next time I will use boneless chicken.  The chicken is so tender that is falls off the bone into the sauce and some of the little pieces of bones ended up in there too.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll make again!

Fantastically delicious ... 
5 stars would have been granted, if the chicken didn't quality for a round of baketball.  
Round two .. we removed the chicken after 20 minutes of simmering and tented until the sauce reduced; 1/2'ed the cream content and added the chicken back before serving ... we give it 10 stars now.

I used 3 boneless chicken breasts. After they cooked, I shredded them. The sauce is rich and wonderful! I didn't add salt or pepper (yet). I found the sauce to be very flavorful with the wine and garlic. It was not very thick but was still quite creamy. I may make this again but try to reduce the fat (less butter, alternatives for the heavy cream). It was a great excuse to use the wine and cream from another meal I made a few days ago.

This was a great simple meal, but full of flavor!  I did added an additional clove or two of garlic.  My husband was impressed and went for seconds, which is huge praise!  I bet this would be good with pork too.

This was really good. Made as directed the first time except I used blsl chicken breasts. Simple recipe, simple ingredients, simply delicious. Sometimes less IS more... Made the second time, again with blsl chicken breasts, this time added one pint of sliced mushrooms and an additional tablespoon of flour. Both times the chicken was moist, flavorful, and fork tender. A keeper!

I doubled the recipe to feed 3 of my boys and husband.  They loved it.  I did add some garlic salt and a 1/2 tsp more pepper to give the gravy more flavor but otherwise everything was delicious.  I used drumsticks and thighs and they turned out very moist.

This was really good -- and I didn't even have cream, which would really have made it outstanding.  Just the right amount of chicken, wine, garlic and cream flavors.  Terrific over rice.  A few notes: I don't think this really takes 45 minutes to simmer, especially if you add warm broth. Also, if you too don't have cream, I used 2% milk with corn starch and it worked fine.  My kids both liked this.

The night that i made this for dinner i made it as stated except that i doubled the sauce, added lots of garlic and lots of salt and pepper and served with mashed potatoes. My family loved it. THEN.... with the leftovers the next day.... I reheated, added additional garlic and served it over bowtie pasta with lots of salt and pepper and grated cheese. Wow!!  It tasted even better than the 1st night!!!  Obviously... this is a very versatile dish.  the sauce is what makes it. I would suggest adding seasoning to taste as some stated that it was bland.

I thought the sauce was excellent but a little simple. So I added fresh thyme and rosemary to the ingredients and then fresh sliced mushrooms. I put it on egg noodles rather than rice. This was a very nice dinner for a week night.

My husband loves this. He's very picky. I've tried this recipe a few different ways. So far it's best when I use red Porto port wine and sawtaid onions when the chicken is browning.  It's a bit sweeter this way but it is a much better texture.  I also like to thicken the sauce with two table spoons of flour.

I used 6 boneless, skinless breasts, and, after browning, cooked them for 30 minutes.  The Sauce is what makes this dish so wonderful.  Smooth and creamy, with a hint of garlic.

This is absolutely wonderful! Very easy but sure tastes "gourmet". The sauce is divine. Our children loved it. Serve with some good, crusty french bread for sopping up the sauce - mmmmmmmmm-mmmmmmmm good!

This was fabulous!  I am a health-conscious cook, so I used fat free half n half, and used boneless skinless chicken breast.  Tasted awesome! Kids gobbled it down, asking for more!  Truly a special meal, without taking "special" time!

I LOVE this recipe! Making it for the second time right now. It couldn't be easier, and doesn't have any ingredients that you don't probably have on hand anyway. I made only a few small changes: used 3 skinless chicken breasts (because that's how they generally come in my grocery store), I used 5 cloves of garlic and flattened them slightly with the back of a knife first, and I used light cream instead of heavy cream because that's what I have in the fridge for coffee. The sauce is lick-your-plate delicious; I'll be making this again and again. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I made this tonight and it was delicious! I make a 40-garlic chicken that tastes much like this, but it takes a lot longer to prepare. I used chicken tenders and it took less than 30 minutes. This recipe is a winner!

This was very tasty and very easy to prepare!  I added the salt and pepper just before the cream, and that tasted great to husband and me.  Instead of chicken with skin, I used four very large skinless, boneless chicken breasts and simmered for about 35 minutes.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this tonight and had to come rave about it.  It was delicious. Just great!  I made some modifications from the printed recipe. Since alot of cooks who reviewed this recipe felt the sauce was too runny I added 2 tbsp flour instead of one. My family does not care for bone in chicken I used boneless chicken breasts.  It worked very well and it shortened the cooking time a bit.  I try to reduce fat in my cooking any time I can. I substituted 1/3 cup Smart Balance Spread for the butter and light cream for the heavy cream.  Could not find chicken stock in the store so I used plain chicken broth. I left out the salt and pepper and didn't miss it. The sauce was so great I wanted to eat by the spoonful. I'll definitely make this again.  Perhaps I'll add some sauteed mushrooms next time. Perhaps a sprinkling of paprika for color too.  Enjoy!

On it's own,this is just good. The sauce is excellent.  I think my overall impression was based on the whole meal.  Serve it with the right side dishes and could be great.  Otherwise just OK.

This turned out great and was relatively easy! The chicken was SO moist and flavorful.  I added tons of garlic and a little paprika too.  My husband and young children loved it. We ate it with pasta instead of rice, and it was a huge hit.  I would recommend using a pan just large enough for the chicken, since I needed more stock to bring the liquid level up to just halfway on the chicken in the large pan I used.  And REALLY brown the chicken before you add the liquid (I had to broiled mine at the end to make it crispy).  The sauce was thin, but delicious. I even added 1/2 T. flour mashed up well in 1 T. softened butter to try to thicken it.  It probably needed more.  I will definitely make again!

This recipe is delicious!! I absolutely loved this dish and it looks beautiful, almost like something one would see at a restaurent so defintely something I'd feel comfortable serving to guests.  
I always like to add a few of my favorite seasonings so I added some onion powder, a touch of paprika and some Johnny's Seasoning.  Gave it that extra kick/flavor. The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars and not 5 is because my husband really enjoyed the dish but didn't quite LOVE it as much as I did.   
Thanks for the great recipe and I would defintely make again.  Thanks

I cut this recipe in half as I cooked it only for my husband and I.  The only modification I made was to add about 1/2 cup of diced red onion when browning the chicken.  In the end, the chicken was very moist, but the sauce was not all that flavourful.  It certainly didn't taste bad, it just had a very delicate flavour.  Given this, we probably won't make it again, but only because we prefer more robust flavours.

This was fabulous!  As many others have said, the sauce is incredible.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I did broil the chicken for a few minutes to crisp the skin).  My family loved it.  I will make this again and again!  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Really yummy! I made exactly as stated, except at the point that you take the chicken out, once cool enough to handle, I shredded it and put back in the sauce. I thought my kids would appreciate that! I did use bone in and skin on chicken, I am sure that gave it more flavor somehow! The sauce never got very thick, but I served over rice and it was rather soupy, but delicious. Flavor was very good. My family (including my 3 year old) loved it. I will make again.

Made this for the week end, everyone really enjoyed it. it was easy to prepare and smelled so good while cooking. I am only rating it 4 stars because there is just way too much butter. I think the butter is just to brown the chicken in, then you don't need much. next time I will cut the butter in half or use EVOO all together and omit it. I did make a change with the chicken but I don't think it strayed away from the original recipe. I cut BLSL breasts into strips and dredged them in a flour mixture with garlic powder, salt ,pepper and peprika. then browned them in the butter. Everyone loved it and are asking when we can have it again. I served it over rice, but I think pasta would be good too.

This was AMAZING!!!! I used boneless chicken breasts and garlic salt, but otherwise followed this exactly. I paired it with jasmine rice and steamed brocolli. I JUST had the leftovers for lunch today and they were seriously the best leftovers I have ever had. And the sauce is awesome on the rice! Will definitely put this into our normal rotation! I also paired this with the Easy Sweet Rolls recipe. They paired well.

Fantastic Recipe as is!  One of my favourite ways to serve chicken.  I have recently started substituting ingredients to make this healthier and works great with only oil, boneless-skinless chicken breasts, and skim milk.  I'm still experimenting with wine substitutes but a mixture of apple juice and white wine vinegar works well too!

THIS WAS SO DELICIOUS.  If you follow the directions perfectly, it will turn out great. Instead of using the chicken with bone, I used "chicken tenderloins" and followed the directions the same way.  I did not use all of the sauce to cover up the chicken (didn't need it all) so I set it aside, and waited to use it until I boiled it down.  THE SAUCE IS AMAZING.  I highly recommend this recipe if you're cooking for family and friends and need something that will impress and not take a lot of time.  I cut up squash into 1/2 inch thick pieces and seasoned with a little butter and lemon pepper (in the oven @ 400 for ten minutes- it made a great side to this recipe. 2 thumbs up from me! :)

AWESOME!!!!!!!!!  I followed this recipe to a tee and I was amazed at how flavorful the sauce was and how moist the chicken was.  This is a very forgiving recipe.  My husband was late from work and I had to delay finishing this for over an hour, so my total cooking time from start to finish was like 2 hours, and it still turned out amazing.  I had really large chicken breast, so I cooked it in the pan for 1 hour, then removed it from the pan until I could finish the sauce later. The only suggestion I would give is to make extra sauce.  I served it over rice and almost needed more to dunk the chicken in as we ate it.  Make sure after you reduce the liquid in the pan that you taste it.  I did not salt or pepper the chicken and with the broth that I used, it has plenty of salt and did not have to add any to the dish.  This will definitely be a keeper in our family.

This ones a keeper.  I used boneless thighs cut into bite size pieces so it cooked a little quicker and added fresh sliced portabella muchrooms and light cream. Served over basmati rice. Super delicious.

Used boneless, skinless chicken.  Turned out really well. Easy to make, too! Only used half the chicken, but made all the sauce. Definitely worth it. Served it with mashed potatoes. The sauce was great over the potatoes.

If I could give this a 10 star I would!  This was a FANTASTIC dish!!  Everyone is right, the sauce just makes the dish, and the chicken being on the bone I think helps to give more flavor.  I did end up having to add probably another 3/4 cup chicken stock to make sure it was covered about half way, and then added a little more wine to even it out. I did double the garlic too, after reading many reviews. When the chicken was removed from the pan to thicken the sauce, I placed the chicken in the oven with the broiler on (although one level down from your normal broil level) and it kept the chicken warm and also crispened the skin.  We still pulled the skin off at the point of eatting though to save fat, but to anyone who likes a crisp skin this would be a good step. I did add just a few sprinkles of corn starch, to thicken the sauce even a tad more. Served over rice. This will be a repeat in our house for sure! Thanks for the great recipe!!

Loved it!  Slight changes I made were; chicken breasts, veggie broth (had no chicken) and used 1.5% milk instead of cream. Turned out fantastic.

Dish was good but sauce needed a little spicing up. Thought about using more garlic, or roasting it first. Served sauce with mashed potatoes. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and also used a bit more pepper in sauced but it still needed more kick

This is fantastic - as noted in a previous review, you have to be sure to add the S&P although that was left out of the recipe. The sauce is SO good. I've eaten the dish with rice and it's good, mashed potatoes are even better. You could probably tweak this recipe into different versions by adding tarragon or another herb to the sauce too.

I made this tonight and it is great.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast halves instead of the bone in.  I also only used half of the wine called for because the one that I bought was really strong but I added more chicken stock.  The chicken could use a little bit more flavor but the sauce is outstanding!!  Even my husband loved the sauce.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

This is a scrumptious recipe, quick, easy, and delicious.  I served it over rice cooked in half water and half chicken stock. The rice complimented the chicken and mixed wonderfully with the sauce.

I was not wow'd by this recipe.  The flavor of the chicken was good but a little dry.  I am going to make this again to see if it comes out better the next time.  I do have one question though.  When does the salt & pepper get added?  I added it at the point when the chicken was browning but am not sure if this was the right time.

Great recipe,  I used breast tenders and just shortened up the cooking time a little.  I used a little paprika with pepper and light salt on the chicken when I was browning it and I added diced white onions, that I sautéed with minced garlic.  Served over white rice

We both thought this was pretty great. I think next time I would use boneless/skinless breasts, or maybe even thighs, since my largest skillet almost didn't hold all 4 of the (admittedly, giant) bone-in breasts that I bought.

I made it exactly how it was suppose to be made minus I only had 2 breast with skin and bone. I made the sauce for 4. I did like it very much, but my own error I did not check if the chicken was done and it had cooked before time was up and I almost burned the sauce. I added more chicken broth then then checked the chicken which was done and did the heavy cream. I just had to let it reduce. Not to myself. Check the chicken. Good not much I would change. Chicken tender and I don't much care if skin is soggy or not. Ate it anyway.

I didn't have cream so I used milk. And only had boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Very tasty! A little time consuming to reduce the broth but all in all it's a keeper.

This was good, the meat was extremely tender and delicious.  Used chicken quarters, subbed half the butter with olive oil, used nonfat Greek yogurt instead of heavy cream and added some onion and mushroom.  Served with Jasmine rice and steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  Thanks for sharing!

Made this the other night and it was very good although my hubby said it was to buttery (meaning unhealthy).  I used 3/4 c milk & 1/4 c butter as a substitute because I didn't have heavy cream.  I also used chicken legs (thighs & drums), very tender.  I will make this again but maybe try 1/4 c olive oil instead of butter as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good recipe, will definitely be making again.  I noticed that the sauce base was really close to one that I use for making sauteed mushrooms, so I sliced some up and tossed them in.  Turned out fantastic :)

This meal was delicious. I did make some adjustments. For starters I totally omitted the butter and used extra virgin olive oil to sear the chicken. I added the wine and chicken broth as directed to simmer. Once the chicken was cooked though, I removed the chicken from the pot and instead of adding heavy cream, I had none,  I added a small amount of water mixed wtih cornstarch to thicken the sauce. The result was really good. I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! I didn't have chicken broth so I used mushroom broth.  Also added in half a cup of sliced mushrooms to brown in the butter with the chicken (I used two chicken legs and thighs on the bone.)  Once the chicken was cooked through I removed it, reduced the sauce a little more, added half & half instead of heavy cream, plus the salt and pepper and a little rosemary, then pulled the  the chicken off the bones and added it back in.  Served over egg noodles, it was to die for.   This will be one of my go-to recipes from now on.

I made this dish according to the recipe... almost. I substituted 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar and 3/4 cup fruit juice for the white wine, since we don't keep it in the house. I *thought* I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, but later realized I used twice the amount of chicken stock. For this reason I ended up needing a little more flour to thicken the sauce. In any case, this dish was AMAZING. It tasted like a good restaurant-quality meal. My husband gave it 8/10, but I gave it a perfect 10! If someone else had cooked this for me, I would have been begging for the recipe.  Who would guess that something so flavourful and delectable would be so simple and economical to make at home?

I really enjoyed this recipe. The Chardoney that I used really gave the chicken flavor! Next time I'd used large boneless chicken breasts instead of the tenders I had at home. Like others, I decided to throw in the tomato sauce instead of the cream. It tasted great!

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made this several times and am always pleased with it. I made a few changes the last time I made this. Instead of using white wine, I used red wine instead. I also sauteed baby bellas and fresh rosemary in olive oil then spooned them on top of the chicken just before placing them on the table. This added to the appearance of the dish and gave it a fantastic flavor which pleased my family. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This was a great recipe and yeilded moist and flavorful chicken. I had to make several changes though. My husband cannot do dairy so I did not use the cream. Instead I used another TBSP of butter and about 4 TBSP of flour a d reduced the broth/wine until it was of the right consistency. I used 6 bone in/skin on thighs. I added 2 bay leaves, plenty of salt and pepper, and a few shakes of lemon pepper. At the end I added a sprinkling of cayenne which wasn't enough to make it spicy but added good flavor. Drizzled over chicken and served with roasted potatoes. Try this potatoe recipe-delish and pairs great with this dish: cube enough potatoes to make a single layer in a 9x13. Add chicken broth until potatoes are nearly covered. Add splash of white wine. Season with lots of good quality lemon pepper and garlic salt. Put in oven at 500 and stir every 20 min until potatoes are tender and broth has mostly evaporated. About half way through try dotting with butter for added flavor and color. You will love it!

I made this for dinner last night and quite enjoyed it though I made a number of changes!   I only used 2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts, and filleted them. Reduced the butter by half. I doubled the amount of garlic. Only used 1 cup of stock. 40 minutes of simmering was far too long for the thinness of my filets. It was basically all gone but left a very small amount of nice thick gravy in the pan. I added a small amount of hot water, then I used maybe only 1/4 cup of half & half instead of heavy cream and stirred until thickened. I sprinkled salt and pepper in the gravy at this point. The results were quite delicious.

Fabulous!  Followed exactly except that I took another reviewers advice and broiled the chicken at the very end to just char it a bit and then propped it up on the mashed potatoes for a nice presentation.  The gravy is outrageous.  Thanks submitter - I am going to make this again soon.

This was really tasty, but next time I will double the sauce because that was the best part. Delish! Could go with rice or potatoes, using sauce as a gravy.

I thought this recipe was very good.  For those of you who got thin sauce you have to be patient.  I probably reduced mine for 15 minutes at a rolling boil to get it thicker.  The chicken was very tender and it does not heat up your kitchen bonus in my book).  I also didn't have heavy cream and just added a dollop of sour cream and it worked fine.  Next time I will double the garlic and serve with mashed potatoes.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I thought this was very flavorful. I don't cook with heavy cream often, so I used plain yogurt instead. Also I cut the prep and cooking time down, did a one skillet dinner. Cooked the chicken, then added everything else.  I used boneless chicken breasts and cut them into strips. I had simmering for too long, chicken was dry. Less than the 45 min as suggested for whole breasts. I gave 4 stars because although this was really good, my family wasnt totally impressed. I liked it though!

This recipe became an instant favorite at our house.  I've made it no less than two dozen times since I found it.  I use skinless chicken tenders.  The browning cooks those most of the way through.  I then add all of the recommended liquid (which more than covers the tenders) and simmer for 15 minutes or so.  I leave the flour out, and instead thicken with a bit of cornstarch at the end.  I also finish with about 1/3 cup grated parmesean cheese.

I'm giving this recipe 3 out of 5 stars.  It was good but I made a lot of changes.  I used Marsala wine and I added an extra clove of garlic.  I seasoned the chicken and the sauce with salt and pepper.  It as good, kind of like a creamy chicken marsala.

So good. I used boneless, skinless chicken. Sprinkled a little "21 Seasoning Salute" (from Trader Joes), in the broth/wine mixture while it was reducing, and dried parsley, just for color at the end. Served with linguine and a salad.

This was outstanding!  It tasted exactly like the Frango com Natas (translation: chicken with cream) that I ate while living in Portugal.  I used the recipe as written but added a tsp. of paprika.

Made this for dinner tonight and really enjoyed it. I'd have liked to use bone-in chicken, but hubby hates bones & skin, so I used tenders (and adjusted cooking time for the smaller cut). Flavor was outstanding. I do wish the sauce had been a little thicker (and I'd have known what to do if I'd read other reviewers first). A note: when you use the function to adjust the recipe to the number of servings you'd like, it keeps the instructions to reduce the sauce to 1 & 1/2 cups, when it will vary with the new quantities. I love salt, but the chicken stock I had on hand was low sodium. For some reason, probably the fact the sauce was reduced, this was still salty. That didn't bother me, but I may not add the salt called for in the recipe next time. For the garlic, I happened to have some roasted cloves to toss in, but still wanted it to have that "other" garlic flavor, so used a little garlic powder (not garlic salt), and also a tiny bit of minced fresh garlic. It may sound like overkill, but it really wasn't. The flavor of the broth and wine still came through.

This is a regular in my house. I use boneless skinless breasts for convenience and to cut out some calories, but I bet it's better the original way.

I made a few changes after reading the reviews. I added an extra pinch of sea salt and sprinkled about a 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper while it was simmering. After 45 minutes of cooking, I then added a handful of chopped italian parsley for color & simmered for another 15 - 20 minutes. I followed the remaining directions by reducing liquid and adding the heavy cream. I served it with saffron (yellow) rice and steamed broccoli. It had a nice flavor with the yellow rice and the eye appeal was definitely there with the different colors.

OH YUM!!!!  Only thing I did was add more garlic cloves as the ones I had were small.  Served with Rice, upon which I put a bit of the sauce, and for a veggie I steamed red, yellow, and green peppers and sprinkled some of the Italian Herb spice you can buy for Salads.  Really good!  A keeper!

Yum!  I made this tonight with a few changes.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and used Smart Blend Light instead of butter.  It was really good, my Portuguese husband loved it, it was similar to a dish that his Mom makes.

This was a fabulous and simple to make recipe. I had a picky child,,,and I mean P I C K Y child over and needed something simple but still delicious for my other kids and and the adults to eat. So I decided to try this out. It was fabulous! I did add a little flour at the end to thicken up the sauce but otherwise this was perfect. A nice warm homey meal =) thanks for the great recipe share!
I agree with the previous poster that a little spice would be nice, but it was good the way it was too. Depends on your mood I suppose.

We are normally not big chicken fans, but this recipes was well loved by everyone ! ! ! I added the suggested garlic, dry chardonnay and a pinch of thyme and the results were fantastic. Thank you for such a great dish.

This was awesome, and I bet it's going to taste even better as leftover lunch tomorrow.  I put it over brown rice and black beans, with a side dish of wax beans.  My husband liked it and said he would eat this again if I made it.  The baby loved it!

This was good but we all agreed it needed salt.  Then I re-read the recipe and saw that salt was included in the list, but not in the instuctions, so as I was busy, as usual, I didn't notice at the time.  I will add a good amount of salt and some other spices next time.

Great recipe! Next time I will add some cornstarch however to make the sauce a little thicker. Also, I think a little cayanne will give the dish a little more kick. Overall, great recipe!

We really liked this dish. I followed the recipe exactly as written and found it to be rich and flavorful. My difficult-to-please husband and kids were very satisfied with this dish and want it to go into heavy rotation. There's too much cream and butter for me to let that happen, but I will make it for them on special occasions. Thanks for sharing.

Made this dish last night and it was so yummy. Only made two changes: used boneless breast chicken and then marinated it in the garlic, wine, chicken stock, less butter, plus added a little rosemary beforehand. Served over basmati rice (with cardamon pods and whole cumin) as well as green beans. Wow...it is to die for! Hubby loved it as well...although he likes everything I make... Thanks for the great recipe!

This was so easy to make and the results were fantastic! I used chicken thighs and served with rice.  All night I've been craving more and had it for breakfast.
