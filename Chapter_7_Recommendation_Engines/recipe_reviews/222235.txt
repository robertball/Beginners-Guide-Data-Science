The pork and dry rub were excellent.  I have to agree with others regarding the sauce.  It was to acidic.  I did add more preserves (I used black cherry)and oregano and it turned out fine.  My  husband loved it and he can be very critical.  It is very simple.  A great week night entrée.  I also roasted sweet potatoes.  Will be adding to my rotation!

This was delicious.  Yum, Yum Yum Tested it out to use for my menu for a dinner party I have every year around Christmas for 16 of my girlfriends.  Still smacking my lips! Don't like cumin, so I left it out and  used finely chopped rosemary in the Cherry sauce instead of Oregano. Make plenty of sauce!  Now I just have to decide what to have for accompaniments

I thought the pork itself was very good but not so crazy about the sauce as written. I m glad I tasted the sauce before I poured it over the pork. I made the sauce again substituting reisling wine for the vinegar. The sweetness of the sauce made with the wine and just a little rubbed sage was so much better than the tart vinegar

The sauce was unpalatable. It's good, but something is wrong with the ratio of vinegar:preserves in the sauce. I made it as directed and it was inedible, so I added more preserves. This was a big improvement, but in the end I used the sauce to deglaze the skillet (oven-safe so I baked the meat in the same skillet I seared it in) and made gravy out of the juices and preserves, which was very good since the spices from the rub were in the pan, too. It was NOT as pretty as the original sauce, however. This is a make-again recipe for us, but since I will never eat the sauce just as written I can't give it a perfect score right off the bat.

We couldn't get enough! My husband recommended double the sauce and I agree! The pork came out perfectly; so tender.  We used coconut oil in lieu of vegetable oil for a healthier alternative, and added just an extra spoonful of cherry preserves than recommended. Thanks for sharing - this could easily be a "company dish."

Really tasty!  I browned and baked the roast in a skillet.  When the meat finished baking I let it rest on a plate. I then added the cherry preserves and vinegar to the drippings, warmed it through and it was fabulous - spicy and sweet sauce for the pork.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Nicely done! Went out to fancy dinner last week and had very good pork tenderloin, but I made this recipe last night and my boyfriend said this was much better. Best of all, it was super easy to make. I'm becoming a big fan of Chef John; learning many good techniques.  Thanks for sharing this!

Delicious.  Didn't have straight ancho so used a Pensys chili pdwr blend with ancho in it.  Also used apple cider vinegar and only a scant 1/4 cup after reading other reviews.  Hubby said best tenderloin he's ever eaten!  a keeper for sure.

Loved it! I didn't have cherry preserves, so I used blackberry. It didn't get at that chocolate-covered-cherry theme, but it was OUTSTANDING! I wouldn't turn down a chocolate covered blackberry, come to think of it. Thanks Chef John!

Oh my, was this dish delicious!!!  I couldn't find cherry perserves so I took a can of cherry pie filing and made my own.  Although I'm not really a good cook, this recipe was easy enough to make me look good.  I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks Chef!!

Made exactly as written and enjoyed how juicy the meat turned out.  Will make this again with the following adaptations: 1) Will cut back on the various chili peppers as (for my taste) it was a little overpowering; 2) Will put the cocoa powder rub on the pork and marinate it for a few hours prior to browning, and 3) Will try a balsamic vinegar we have that has chocolate-cherry notes to it (rather than the white vinegar) and reduce it a little more so as to really bring out the chocolate and cherry flavors.  I'm looking forward to making this dish many more times.  Thanks, Chef John!

This pork rub is very interesting--full of flavor, with just a touch of heat, and it doesn't taste like cocoa at all.  The rub gives the tenderloin a lovely, dark brown color, and it would work well with other fruit-based sauces.  Perhaps it was the preserves I used, but I would at least double the amount of preserves next time, for more cherry flavor.  Cooking times were accurate, and the meat was tender and juicy.

Great recipe!  One note: I had a bit of the cocoa rub left, so I incorporated it into the sauce.  Also, I took the tenderloins out of the oven, put them on the grill and basted them with some of the sauce.  Awesome!!! :-)

Chef John needs another five star rating, right? My husband always like his pork with applesauce no matter how I make it. I was waiting for his typical " do you have any applesauce" request when I served this. He ( and I)
loved this! I used white balsamic vinegar and he commented on how much he liked the sauce. First time in fourteen years he never asked for applesauce, just this perfect cherry sauce. Next time I will double the sauce. Yum!

Chef John Rocks!  Everything one of his recipes that I've tried has been outstanding.  Another winner here!  Noteworthy that this was the first pork dish I've made that didn't come out dry.  Sweet and juicy, and the spices were a perfect pairing with the cherry sauce.  Mmm, mmm good :)

the tenderloin was amazing! the spice rub combo was wonderful. The cherry sauce was a little too tart though. It could've used a little less white vinegar!

Yummy - the crust/seasoned edges of pork were the best! I baked on 375 for 20 minutes, and then increased the heat to 400 for the last 5 minutes to make sure it's fully cooked; it was still very soft and juicy - delicious and easy; Unfortunately, I didn't have cherry (whamp-whamp), so instead I used some Apple-Blueberry butter (with Apple Cider Vinegar); I didn't think it would work very well, but it was just enough to add some sweetness to it. I'll definitely try the cherry next time for a full intended effect...

Don't even try to make me fix boneless pork loin any other way.  I may not have had the exact same ingredients as the specific kinds of spices, but made do with adjusted amounts of chili and cayenne.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.

Do be sure to only cook the pork 20 minutes.  Let it rest before slicing.  If the color makes you nervous, cover with foil and cook an additional 5 minutes.  I cooked on regular roast.

Together with Balsamic Vinegar and Ginger Bok Choy (recipe on this site), jasmine rice, and apple cider over ice , anyone can have a gourmet dinner that is quick and easy to prepare and great in any season.

I predict that cooks will want to serve it to guests.  They'll think you've been taking classes at the CIA!

Delicious recipe, but needing some tweaks. These are the recipe hacks I put in place. I  cut the vinegar in half on others recommendations and replaced with red wine. This was a perfect amount of acidity. I doubled the sauce recipe, but it still wasn't enough.  I will quadruple the sauce recipe. Next time, I will make a reduction with the sauce from the dry rub and fat left in the pan. I was nervous it might be too spicy for my daughter's palate, but the seasonings were fine. Not too spicy at all.  I used fresh Door County cherries which were delish. Next time I will also add more cherries.

Followed the recipe - the only change was my husband, my personal chef, thickened the sauce the second time he made it.  We tested before making it for friends and all enjoyed.  Loved the smell as it baked!!!

I tried this recipe on my crew at the fire station.  As Chef John said, "Did it work?"...  Indeed it did. Rave reviews.  It was quite quiet at the table.  The cherry sauce is amazing.  I did a quick brown of the meat in a pan and then put it on a 350 degree grill for 20 minutes.  Let it sit and then sliced.  Slaw was crisp and a real nice balance between creamy and tangy.  WOW.  Thank you Chef John.

Very good. I cut out cumin because i'm not a fan of it. It was pretty spicy but that may have been because I ground my own peppers.

OMG! This is fabulous. Pork so tender and juicy! Definitely double the sauce. I used the spices as a rub 6 hours before cooking. I also used a combo of apple cider vinegar and chocolate flavored olive oil. Amazing!

Delicious and moist!  Will definitely make again.  I didn’t have white vinegar, so substituted white wine vinegar.  I think next time I will halve the vinegar amount and maybe thicken the cherry sauce with a little cornstarch.

We thought this was spectacular!  I loved the dry rub and made it exactly as directed.  I was literally drinking the sauce but I almost doubled the cherry preserves which are a must.  I never had cherry preserves, but now they’re a favorite.  Instead of white vinegar I used half apple cider vinegar and half balsamic vinegar.  This sauce was soooooo delicious with the pork and like I said I was drinking it off my plate.  
Oh and I  browned the pork in a cast iron skillet and just left the pork in that pan and baked it.  Less pans to wash.

This was tasty!  Since my husband had a heart attack last weekend, we have been trying to find a tasty, heart-healthy meal.  This fit the bill!  I cut the pork up into medallions, which cut the cook time down to about 20 minutes, total.  I also didn't have cherry preserves in house, so I used cranberry/orange.  Was very nice!

This is a fabulous and very easy pork tenderloin recipe. I usually make it with mashed potatoes and some sort of veggie. The sauce from the pork goes really well as a potato gravy. I've made this for family and friends, and its always been received very well!

Interesting flavors - I made it with pork chops and it was great.  Made it with pork loin roast, and it wasn't that good.  (Too much meat for the amount of rub/outer sides of roast).  I made sauce per recipe and we liked it.

Delicious! This cocoa spice coating is very good. I agree with other reviews stating the sauce needed more cherry preserves. I also reduced the sauce to allow it to thicken a bit more. The only other difference I made was to put it on the offset smoker to finish rather than in the oven. A bit of hickory was a nice addition to the flavor profile.

The pork turned out beautifully, however no one in my family liked the cocoa taste. We ended up scrapping off all the coating.

This is a really unique and delicious recipe with a lot going on: It's spicy, savory, sweet and sour. Even though I didn't use any ground chipotle pepper (couldn't find it anywhere), the chili powder still provided some nice heat. Unlike others, we found the vinegar/cherry ratio to be palatable. However, I did use closer to 1/2 cup preserves and boiled the mixture for slightly longer than 30 seconds...more like 1 minute.

Unfortunately, I definitely overcooked the pork chops, but I expect that this was my fault rather than the recipe's. I misunderstood the recipe as it was written and cooked the chops for four minutes on each side instead of four minutes total.

I doubled the cumin and used red pepper flakes instead of the other peppers. I used less vinegar in the sauce and added a teaspoon of honey to cut the vinegar tartness. Rave reviews from the family and requests to make it again soon.

This is amazingly easy to cook and the cherry sauce is the perfect accompaniment. I added a can of Bing Cherries and that gives the dish a bit more excitement . 
I agree that perhaps a bit let vinegar  - and I also used cider vinegar and rosemary.  Do the rub ahead of time and then the rest goes very quickly leaving lots of time to get out of the kitchen and  enjoy your guests.

Added 2 tbsp brown sugar to the rub and left it on for several hours.  Cut the vinegar in half, I used apple cider and balsamic and added 1/4 c red wine and 2 tbsp port, then reduced to thicken.  Absolutely yum and have made this several times for company.

This is absolutely delicious. This is by far my favorite way to prepare pork tenderloin.  Its flavorful, but not to spicy and the cherry sauce compliments the meat.  I will be making this again soon.

Absolutely DELICIOUS, and easy too! I do believe there is a typo in the original recipe. I made it with ONE CUP of cherry preserves, plus the ? cup vinegar. It was perfect that way, we were eating the sauce with a spoon! Otherwise, it would have been way too vinegary, AND not enough sauce for the recipe.

Oh my goodness this was amazing! I wish I would have taken a picture. The dry rub was very, very good. I didn't find the chiles in the store, so I didn't have that, but the taste of cocoa mixed with cumin and pepper and chipotle was fantastic. I made this for my boyfriend and I and also let my roommates have a taste because they were so impressed with the idea of the recipe. Everyone loved it! Very juicy, I will be making this again, next time for my mom and dad probably. Highly recommended!

Very tasty flavor if the vinegar is reduced by half. I personally would make this again as a baste for a pot roast; I feel like the tenderloins get too dry due to their thinness. But, overall, we enjoyed the combination of flavors.

This was very tender and very delish! Will make again. Didn't have powder chipotle, so rubbed a bit of chipotle salsa on meat before the rub and it worked great! Entire family loved it.

Wow! This is extremely delicious. The pork is very tender and flavorful. Having that meat thermometer hit 145 is critical - it keeps you from drying out that expensive tenderloin. My only gripe is with the vinegar sauce. I cooked it longer to let it thicken and burn off that sharp vinegary flavor. In fact, next time I will use balsamic vinegar instead. Will definitely make this again for my hard to please brother-in-law and see how that goes.

This was so flavorful.  The cherry glaze really topped it off.  Will def make this again.
