This was the first time I cooked a Leg of Lamb so I don't know a lot about Lamb.  My husband has had lamb a lot and he gave the recipe 4 stars.  I thought it was very good :)

This was my first time cooking a leg of lamb and it came out great! Only change was to add some chopped fresh rosemary to the marinade (I was going back and forth between this and another recipe and had the rosemary all chopped up). Marinated the lamb overnight.  I thought the flavors were excellent - nothing overwhelming, just a good, simple marinade that complimented the meat perfectly.

I'd give it more stars if I could. All I can say is fabulous!!! I couldn't stop eating it. It was just perfect the way it was, didn't change a thing.

Good starter recipe, I added an itailian herb blend to the marinade and it kicked up the flavor nicely. But cook till instant read thermometer reads 130-135 for medium rare (as lamb should be), 165 is well done.

A great recipe. I didn't marinate it. I cut slits all over it and stuffed garlic cloves in them. Far enough that they don't fall out. Brush olive oil over the leg and sprinkle pepper and crushed rosemary. Bake at 325 degrees F of 2 1/4 to 3 hours (depending on the size and doneness). After removing from the oven, let it stand for about 15 minutes. 

Don't let the cat jump on the counter and take bites out of it as it will burn the cats mouth. It didn't stop her from taking more bites, though.

Excellent flavor and juicy and tender.  Followed the recipe exactly. A nice Zinfandel compliments this very well.

First time I made the leg of lamb (my husband usually does) and I cannot wait for him to try this!  I added white wine, potatoes and carrots to roast it in the oven (covered) 3 hrs.  Mashed the potatoes and carrots together.  AWESOME with the white wine flavor!  Kids loved it! Definately will make again!

Great recipe! Made this for my family for Easter it was a big hit! Thank you! We barley have any leftovers. I did add some fresh rosemary, and some tarragon, and left out one clove of garlic.

Came out great - substituted  a Romanian spice Chimbru (Savory) for Oregeno. The basting kept the lamb from drying out.
