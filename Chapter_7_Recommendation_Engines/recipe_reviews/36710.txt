This was good but I changed a few things.  I used hummus instead of cream cheese.  I used tomato tortillas instead of flour.  I replaced the alfalfa sprouts with shredded carrot.  I also left out the blue cheese and onion.  When I asssembled the wraps I put the lettuce leaves directly on the tortillas.  I then spread the hummus on the lettuce.  I put a mixture of the shredded cabbage and shredded carrot on top of the hummus and then put the tomato on top.  Then I wrapped it.  It was very good.

Nice crunch and snap of flavors. Even a confirmed meat eater like myself wasn't disappointed at the taste. Only real prepwork is assembling the ingredients, and chopping everything up. Leftover chopped bits are good for throwing into salads, putting on a bagel, etc.

AWESOME RECIPE! I'm a personal chef and I made these for a client who does not like cream cheese so I used hummus instead. I also added thinly sliced grilled chicken to a few of the wraps for the "meat eater" in the family. Wonderful & Healthy!

I was cooking for just myself on the day I made these, so I bought all the ingredients except the tortillas at the salad bar in the grocery.  Saved me money and I didn't have to throw any away.  Pretty good, I might use blue cheese dressing next time instead of the crumbled blue cheese.

I made these for my boyfriend to bring with him to his classes. He really enjoyed it however I use pitas instead of tortillas because he doesn't care for tortillas and also I used feta cheese instead of blue cheese.

Awesome, but I use hummus instead of cream cheese, and use a whole-wheat tortilla instead of white.

you can throw in any veggie and top it off with hummus; i even use honey mustard too sometimes, and it's always a delicious snack!

Excellent recipe - I've been making this regularly since June 2003 and I still love it.  For various I buy the wraps that have chilli in and sometimes garlic ones and sometimes I just go for plain.

Great for lunch and in winter I just add a cup of soup!

It was okay, but I could live without the cream cheese and onion. But rock on:)

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. It is so darn healthy and I haven't encountered anyone who doesn't like them. I usually make them for gatherings and such and I only have the tray to take home!

Great Recipe! I loved the use of cream cheese. Where was the blue cheese in the directions?

This combination of items in this recipe are good but both my husband and I found it a little on the dry side.  It may need a little dollop of mayonaise or even blue cheese salad dressing to moisten it up.  We'll probably try and experiment with this one again.

I made these for my families Independence Day celebration and they were a BIG hit.  Not only do they transport very well (wrapped individually in foil), but they taste great!  The ingredients can be also be changed up a bit to add variety.  A definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing it.
