This is great rice! Yummy! I omitted the olives and cheese (I guess you could sprinkle some cheese over your serving to melt but I just didn't think it needed it) and used a whole jar of diced pimentos. Very colorful and very tasty! This will accompany many maindishes in the future! Thanks Michele!

This was very good. I did add more green chili peppers because I love them. I also added garlic powder.

Oh MY! This was delicious yummy tasty and really looks good too. Very colorful makes a great presentation both in taste and sight! I will make this again! I followed the recipe entirely but didn't have pimentoes so used roasted jarred red peppers. No monterey either just some four cheese shredded mix. Super super super!

Made this rice to go with grilled pork steaks for a dinner with extended family. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds. Definitely added this one to make again and again.

We liked this pretty much - I didn't actually like it as much as I thought I would given the ingredients. Maybe it didn't have enough flavor for my taste. I did leave out the olives because we don't like them so maybe they add the missing flavor. This recipe also made a ton! Way more than 6 servings for us so we got tired of eating it over and over. I would still make it again though in a smaller quantity.

Really liked this was looking for something different to serve along side my flounder.I browned the rice in butter then put in a bowl with the water and chicken bouillon microwaved on high for 20 min.In same pan brown onions garlic half a green bell pepper. Stir the rest of ingredients into the bowl of rice. This was really good and different. Thanks

Just the side I was looking for to go with my leftover steak...I did cut the recipe in half for all ingredients EXCEPT the can of green chiles. I also didn't have any pimiento or roasted red pepper so just sauteed some chopped red bell pepper with the onions and rice. Cheddar Jack cheese gave the rice some extra color and snipped fresh chives added to the confetti look. A keeper in my book.

This has been in my box for 10 years wish I had made it sooner that would have been an extra 10 years of enjoyment. This was easy to make and very enjoyable. I left out the pimento and scooped out my serving before adding the olives. (I'm not a fan) Compliments from all! The green chilies add such a nice flavor I wouldn't have guessed they were in there if I hadn't made it.

used brown rice instead of white; this extended the cooking time to about 45 minutes. Left out the green chilies pimentos & parsley; used cheddar cheese. This will be a keeper--I've never browned rice in butter before cooking it before and it was superbly creamy.

This was really good but only make enough for one meal or maybe mix with something else for leftovers. The taste and texture really didn't carry over very well to the second day.

GREAT RECIPE!!! I changed a couple things only due to personal preference. I omitted the pimentos and black olives (I LOVE black olives but my boyfriend not so much.) I added sweet corn. DELICIOUS!! Will definitely be making this a lot!

Very good -- 4 and 1/2 stars. I thought the black olives would be kind of weird so I cut back on them. However you should not. It was great and I wished I had put in the amount of olives called for.

Delicious! Didn't have pimentos chiles or olives. So i just put in broccoli cut up in bitty pieces and a little spinach. I also browned the rice and onion with some garlic. It came out better than i expected thanks!

My family really enjoyed this. I did not use as much butter as the recipe called for and did not have the olives pimento peppers or parsley on hand and it was still delicious. It was great served alongside a tortilla casserole.

The whole family loves this dish.  There are very few recipes that can accomplish this task.  I have to try to please 6 people with very different  tastes.  Amazing!
