This was good! I used Yukon gold potatoes, b/c that's what I had on hand, and I peeled and cubed them up before putting them in the oven, so they would be easier for the kids to eat. I used a more dressing than called for b/c I felt it needed it. This was a nice change from the usual, and I would make it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This so simple and so good.  It says to serve warm and I thought it was fantastic.  I note that is also good cold.  I will make again and again.

Made this to take to a pot luck with the main course serving ham.  I left out the bacon and it was still good, so I can only image that bacon would improve it.  I used my own salad dressing recipe that has mustard in it because I thought it would work well with the ham.  Very easy and everyone liked it.

I used Turkey bacon and a homemade Caesar Dressing. It's like mixing dressing with roasted potatoes. I did add a little red onion to the potatoes when baking. My family liked it and it was interesting.
