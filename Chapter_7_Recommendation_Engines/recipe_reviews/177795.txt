12.30.15  I was asked to bring some "finger food" to a New Year's Eve party tomorrow.   I baked up a few today just to be sure they were good.  I used bite-sized puff pastry cups and pastrami, scaled down the ingredients to fit the cups, and they turned out delicious!  I can assemble them and then just pop in the oven for a few minutes at the party.  I would recommend not totally cooking the cups because once they're filled, they have to go back in the oven for 5 minutes at a high temp, and the ones I cooked today were a little too brown on the bottom.  This one's a winner regardless of whether you cook them in bite-size or full-size puff pastry cups...and they're EASY!!   You'll get that true rueben sandwich flavor in every bite.
