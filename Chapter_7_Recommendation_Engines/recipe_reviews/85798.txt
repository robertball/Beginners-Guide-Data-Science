This was a great recipe. But I used sliced cheddar instead and topped it with BBQ sauce. I always use the frozen boneless skinless chicken breast that comes in a bag at your store. It is hardly ever dry, unlike the fresh chicken breasts.

Made these last night, and they were great, considering I'm not a big chicken sandwich fan.  I pounded out the chicken breasts and put them on the grill pan (way too hot in TX to cook outside!).  I cut them to fit the buns before putting the jack cheese on.  I also used turkey bacon, which was fine, but I'm sure regular bacon would have been even better!  Just a little mayo with the red onion and it was great.

This is a good and easy sandwich to make for when you want a quick supper and don't want to stand over the stove for the entire time.  Changed a few things.  I put the poultry seasonings on the chicken and let it marinade for about an hour.  I grilled the onion (on the inside grill) along with the chicken.  I also used colby jack cheese instead of pepper jack...didn't have any.  Hubby is gonna be upset that he missed this one...guess I will just have to make again.  Thanks for the post.

Delicious! I love grilled chicken sandwiches and my husband loves anything with bacon so this was a winning combination for us!  We basted a bit of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce on the chicken while it grilled which made it moist and juicy. My husband kept the pepperjack cheese, but I opted for Swiss and a slice of avocado on mine.  We left the pickles on the side along with some kettle cooked chips.  Not bad for a quick meal!

This recipe was absolutely delicious and my husband raved about it.  I brushed olive oil lightly on each chicken breast through at least two flips to avoid drying it out.  I used Swiss cheese as Jack is to spicy for me and it was fabulous.  Too good and tasty to have with bread.  It is perfect by itself or with a side dish.  This is a keeper and will be a regular meal.  THANKS.

This was good!  As I figured that it would be.  Really simple ingredients and hardly any preperation.  I just followed another reviews suggestion and brushed olive oil over the chicken while it was cooking.  It turned out great.

These were so good.  We made ours into panini's so instead of buns we used butter bread.  After the chicken was cooked I sliced it up as well.  I also substituted jack cheese for mozzarella cheese and fresh parmesan.  

Will definitely make these again.

Pretty good although the chicken was a little dry.  Next time I am going to marninate the chicken instead of using the poulty seasoning.  Will make again.

5 stars! Definately a keeper recipe! I used mayo and some spicy brown mustard as additional condments and my boyfriend used Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. He thought this was the best chicken sandwich recipe he'd ever tasted and since I'm not the big chicken breast on a sandwich fan but still loved it...it gets 5 stars!! Thanks for your recipe!! :-)

This is such a terrific "quickie" dinner for those nights that my daughter and I get home late from her dance classes or when you have to rush out. Ty's a bar-b-que sauce freak, so I marinated the breasts in the sauce and cooked on top of my indoor grill pan and basted. I boiled then simmered the rest of the sauce and used it on the bun. She also dipped her sandwich into the leftover sauce. Instead of placing the whole breast on the sandwich, I thinly sliced it and gave it a quick melt under the broiler. Great sandwich and thanks!

WOW, this was AWESOME! I seasoned my chicken with Penzy's 'Northwood Seasoning' instead of the poultry seasoning, and browned it quickly in a pan w/ olive oil before putting it in the oven to finish cooking through (my grill is currently out of comission). Then I just put on the bacon and cheese and put it back in the oven until the cheese was melted. I made a mayo flavored with garlic, chipotle powder and parmesan cheese and that complimented the sandwich nicely. I served it on homemade pretzel buns. This was one HUGE sandwich! Everything went together wonderfully! I will definiately be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was absolutely delicious!! It looked just like the chicken sandwiches I have ordered from restauraunts. I also liked that there was no mayo or dressing. I always ordered it on the side, as I don't like it on sandwiches. I didn't have a grill handy, so I used the broiler. I used restaurant quality rolls. I put about a teaspoon of whipped butter on each side and broiled the buns on low on a foil lined sheet for 4 minutes. I removed them, turned the broiler to high, and broiled the chicken on the same sheet for 7 minutes on each side. I did have to spray the chicken some with olive oil. For the bacon I used thick cut smithfield bacon. I put it in a microwaved covered bacon cooker, which made clean-up easy. This was so fast to make, I can't believe I ever ordered one at a restaurant!

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This was wonderful!  I followed the recipe with the exception of using grilled chicken that I had leftover from the night before, and I didn’t have the dill pickle slices, so I left those off.  I used thinly sliced red onion, as the particular type of onion wasn't specified.  By the time I had “built” my sandwich it was so huge I couldn’t even get my mouth around it, but that did not deter me, and I happily managed to eat the whole thing.  It was messy, no doubt due to the fact that I used a big, juicy Ohio tomato, which only added to the deliciousness of this sandwich.  I am already craving another one!!!

Yummy!  My husband and I both really liked this recipe.  We used the bacon, pepper-jack cheese, tomatoes, onions and avocado slices.  My husband used BBQ sauce on his, I used Steak Sauce on mine.  And I had to bake my chicken, since our grill is out of fuel.  But it was a perfect weeknight meal for us - a nice change!

This a great quick diner. I added thinly sliced ripe alvacado to this sandwich and it really made this awsome. I also cut the bacon slices in half and place them in a cooking rack onto a foiled lined cookie sheet and baked the bacon in the oven at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes or until crisp and golden brown.  Removed and drained onto paper towls. I have found this cuts the grease in half. As for condiments, I spread each side of the bun with a small amount of Ranch dressingfor my sandwich and my husband used honey mustard on his. Both where YUMMY. This is defintly one we will prepare again.

We really liked these. I took other reviewers advice and used BBQ sauce (I marinated these in the BBQ sauce all day). Omitted the poultry seasoning since I used the BBQ sauce, but kept everything else the same. Tasty, quick and easy,Thanks for the recipe:)

Wow this was easy to make and very good. Similar to your favorite deli chicken breast sandwich. I did carmelize my onions before adding them on top and also seaoned my chicken with salt and pepper. My family loved this.

This is the second time I've tried this recipe. The first time I made it, I thought it was great! This time, I changed a few things. First, I didn't use the pickels, second, I swaped hamburger buns for Organic Italian Flat Bread cut to sandwich size. I cooked the Bacon first and reserved the Drippings. I flattened a large Chicken Breast (enough for 3) between plastic wrap with a mallet. I mixed the Poultry Seasoning with the Bacon Drippings and rubbed over chicken. After searing the chicken on both sided on the grill, I moved it to the warming rack to finish cooking, turning a few times. Also, I split the bread and cut out the extra bread on the inside then placed them on the grill to toast. After the chicken was fully cooked, I took it off the grill and cut it into portion sizes, added the Bacon, Pepper Jack Cheese, Mozzarella, and Ground Black Pepper, then returned them to the warming rack. When the cheese melted, I placed them on the bread, added the condiments, including a little mayo. It was incredible! My wife said she would have gladly payed for this in a restaraunt, and that we could have it again the next day.

To die for!  I seasoned my chicken breasts with generous amounts of Chef Paul Prudhomme's Poultry Magic first.  This was so absolutely yummy that we've decided to skip the buns next time.  I plan to just make the chicken and layer on the bacon and cheese and make a side for it.  The chicken was so wonderfully yummy with the cheese and bacon!

Delicious summer sandwich.  I had to use chicken tenders and hot dog buns as that is what I had on hand.  Other than changing the shape of the ingredients, made everything as written.  We thought the sandwich was very tasty and filling.  Next time I will add a few more spices to the chicken, but, it is still very good as written.

My family really liked these sandwiches.  The only change I would make is to change the poultry seasoning to maybe Lawry's seasoning or just salt and pepper.

These were very good. I didn't have any poultry seasoning so I used salt, pepper and garlic powder. And I left off the onion. I liked the flavoring as it was so I didn't add any type of condiment.

Was searching for something new to do with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  This was great.  Grilled outside it didn't heat up the kitchen.  Family loved it, said I should make it again.

Such a simple meal and very good.  Instead of bacon, I grilled some peppers and onions.  I didn't have poultry seasoning so I used Emeril's seasoning which is similar.  the pepper jack makes the dish!!  a good bun and dinner tasted like you would get a restaurant.

Very good recipe. Definately a new favorite for me.  Instead of hamburger rolls, I served on soft kaiser rolls.  Also, I made a honey mustard sauce to top off the sandwich nicely.  To make the honey mustard sauce: I used marzetti honey dijon dressing, a little grey poupon dijon mustard and honey (use quantities to suit your taste. Start by putting the honey dijon dressing in a dish, add a little (tsp or so) of grey poupon dijon mustard and honey, then adjust to your taste. I used a good bit of honey to make a nice sweet honey mustard sauce :).  I served with chips which were good.  The next time I make, I plan on making the Vegetable Chowder (from this site--really good and easy to make), soup or chips with this sandwich, can't go wrong with either.

It's a tasty sandwich, but it is that ... a sandwich.  It is a little dry and condiments tend to wash away the original intent of the recipe.  Good basic recipe.

This was a great recipe. I have to say, i used potato buns instead of hambuger buns and omitted the poultry seasoning and pickles.  Instead of seasoning, i used garlic powder, cajun seasoning, and salt  It was delicious.  Every bite was almost perfect.  Next time, i'll leave pickles on mine since i'm the only one in the house that likes pickles.

This was amazing!  While my husband loves Monterey Jack cheese, I am more of a Mozzarella girl.  I loved how the cheese worked on my sandwich, and it still tasted so delicious!  Adding the dill pickle slices really topped off the flavor.  On a warm summer night, it was nice to not heat up the kitchen too much and we love using our grill.  I will definitely be making these easy sandwiches again!

I added bacon pieces to ranch dressing and spread on a wrap, used spinach instead of lettuce  - all else the same.  My family asked for twice since I made.  This won't be your signature dish or glory that gets served to guests, but it is an easy family pleaser - and we all need those.

5 Stars because my 17yo son loved these - he ate 3 sandwiches!  I prepared the chicken, he made up a bbq/ranch dressing, and we both enjoyed this meal very much.  Followed the recipe with the exception of using packaged (real) bacon pieces since I had some opened that needed to be used up.  I thought the bacon really made these great with the pepper jack cheese.  Tasty and pretty easy.  Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper for us.

I used ham instead of the bacon and topped it with some dijon mustard. YUMMY!! Can't wait to try with the bacon. I didn't use buns I only had sliced bread and no condiments.

I'm a newbie when it comes to cooking... so tonight I decided to try this out. It was fabulous. I didnt add lettuce, tomato, onions, or pickles because no one in my family likes it. I alos opted out of the poultry seasoning. Instead I used McCormick Grill Mates Roasted Garlic and Herb to marinate the chicken breasts in before grilling. I also put them on toasted hoagies instead of hamburger buns. Definitely a crowd pleaser. They loved it.

my husband freaked out over this little recipe(in a good way). The only change I made was to split the chicken breast and stuff it with cheese and bacon. Then once the chicken was stuffed I baked it for an extra 10 mins.

This was SO good.  Great dinner for a late summer night.  Just fired up the grill, rubbed the chicken in poultry seasoning and brushed a little olive oil on to keep it moist and it was perfect.  The pepperjack cheese added a nice little kick.  Will definately make again!

This was a great weekday summer recipe. I used a slice of banguette toasted on the grill, rather than a bun.  And a Love the dressing from "Southwestern Ceaser Salad" put some of that on the bread before the chicken.  Red onions, lettuce, cheese and bacon... My husband thought he was eating resturant fare.

These sandwiches are just awesome!  I used mozarella cheese because that's all I had, didn't have any poultry seasoning so I ended up using Old Bay Seasoning, added avocado slices and skipped the pickels.  Everybody, and I mean everybody raved about these sandwiches.  Definitely a keeper.  ;o)

Hot and spicy. I used precooked chicken and sprinkled the poultry seasoning over it. After trying several condiments I found that Russian dressing went the best with this and Ranch was a close second. Thousand Island might be good too as it needs a creamy based dressing to tame the pepperjack cheese. Thanks this is a great sandwich!

I made these with leftover fajita-marinated chicken breasts.  We added BBQ sauce to ours and liked them a lot.  Will make again and follow the recipe to cook the chicken next time.

This was a great base to play with, which is why I rated it 4 stars. I marinated the chicken and onion using 'Pretty Chicken Marinade' from this site. I only had about 2 hrs, and the flavor was perfect. I chose to marinate because I'm afraid the chicken would have been pretty flavorless otherwise. I used a mini artisan bread loaf instead of hamburger buns. I grilled the chicken and onions both on my indoor grill. Once it was done, I split the loaf, layered the chicken, onion, bacon and then Swiss cheese (didn't have Jack but can't wait to use it next time!)Then, I placed the sandwich open-faced under the broiler until the bread was toasted and the cheese melted. A bit of Olive Oil Mayo on top, and YUM! I didn't have the lettuce/tomato on hand, but will certainly add them next time. This will be a great recipe to change up as the mood suits - so many cheeses, so little time!! Thanks for the great start to an awsome chicken sandwich!!

This was an instant favourite. My husband said this was a keeper, and I even got my mother's approval who was in town visiting. The honey mustard sauce is key!! Simple, easy and more delicious than anything you could eat out and buy.

These were great!  I sliced the chicken breasts in half, rubbed them with the poultry seasoning, then I brushed them with olive oil.  I baked them 10 minutes per side.  I added the pepperjack and bacon, then baked an extra 2-3 minutes.  Yum!  Thanks!

Very tasty, a keeper!  Tried different spices on the chicken breasts, which I filleted instead of pounding. Yum!

These were very good!  A new comfort food for me.  My BF said he didn't know what to think because there were little flavor explosions going off everywhere in his mouth - LOL!  He's never said anything like that before!  I took it as a compliment, as he ate the whole thing.

Great and Yummy  for a quick lunch or dinner. I spiced the chicken with Fajita, salt and olive oil before grilling. Used azorean cheese, and Portuguese bread very mild cheese. Loved it!

Followed this recipe exactly as posted except didn't use the pepper-jack, I used cheddar jack.  Also toasted the hard rolls with olive oil, garlic powder and a little of the bacon grease.  My guys loved it!!  Oh, also couldn't use the onions with them, but I would have loved it ;)

These are a great quick meal to make!  I marinated the chicken in a honey dijon dressing all day and omitted to poultry seasoning.  I cooked the chicken on my George Foreman grill, sauteed the onions and added avocado.  I also used regular jack cheese because my kids don't like spicy.  My husband and kids loved it!

Loved it!  instead of poultry seasoning, I added Penzey's Buttermilk Ranch Dressing base on the chicken breasts.  I drizzled Buttermilk Ranch Dressing on the buns before serving.  Incredible!

These were great! I used thick sliced applewood bacon. Also I pounded the chicken out, seasoned with Rotisserie Chicken Seasoning and broiled it instead!

Good! I used turkey bacon and instead of poultry seasoning, I used Scotdog's Low Sodium/Cajun/Creole/All Purpose Seasoning. It was a good match with the pepper jack cheese. For my family, I served them on hoagie rolls and for me, I ate mine sans roll and it was still mighty tasty. With a few homemade spicy jo-jo's and a veggie platter, this was a flavorful filling dinner without much to-do.

This is just a very basic grilled chicken recipe. The chicken didn't have much flavor so I guess it was good to add the extras. Otherwise, kinda boring!

Made this last night.  It was a simple, easy dish. The chicken could use more flavor though, for my taste... next time I would use my recipe of coating the chicken with a thin layer of mayo, seasoning w/ favorite spices and then grilling.  The mayo really locks in the flavors.  Would definately make again though.  EASY!!!  Served w/ a boxed pasta salad (I know, that's not really 'cooking' - but I was short on time!)

This was really good.  I pounded my chicken breasts so that they were not so thick and kept everything else as written.  Thanks

This is a great grill recipe! However, next time I will not use chicken breast halves, as they were much too thick for a sandwich, in my opinion.  I did marinate my chicken overnight in mojo, which made it very tasty and tender! I also used jalapeno pepper jack cheese...the extra kick is subtle, and helps make this a well-rounded sandwich.  We will make this again!!

I try to cook as healthy as I can so we eat a lot of chicken in our house.  This is the perfect recipe for a little shakeup in the middle of the week.  I'm still kicking myself for not thinking of this earlier.

Very good recipe. I made a few changes because of ingredients on hand.Used left over grilled chicken breast and substituted Mexican four cheese(Monterey Jack, Cheddar, Queso, and Asadero) for pepper jack. Also added roasted peppers. Used Thousand Island dressing to dip

Made this pretty easily on the stove top. Went over well I baked the bacon and it was much better then frying it then I put a patesan garlic mayo on it as well as some muenster and Swiss cheese melted on top. I left off the pickles as I like those on the side served it with old fashion potato salad and will do it again! Thnx!

Wonderful recipe! I sauteed mushrooms and onions slowly in butter and olive oil in my cast iron skillet until caramelized and delicious. My husband and I love things spicy so after I grilled the chicken I put it on a pan, added jalapeños, the cheese, and poured Stubbs Spicy Barbeque Sauce over each one. For our children, I placed the chicken on the same pan and added cheddar and placed in the oven to melt the cheese. When I served theirs I put sub-sauce on the buns because they don't like mayo or barbeque sauce. It was delicious. I will add avocado to mine next time. Very quick and easy and extremely delicious!

My hubby was in heaven. He loved this chicken sandwich. He always orders a chicken sandwich at restaurants, and he told me it was better than the restaurant chicken sandwich. I did tweak the sandwich by using olive oil and cajun seasoning instead of poultry seasoning. Then, I slathered butter on the buns and toasted the buns on my griddle pan. My kids chose to use provolone cheese instead of the pepperjack  cheese and I added sliced avocado to my sandwich.

I made this for dinner tonight - it was delicious....I put the ingredients on a ciabatta bun.  I also spread a little ranch dressing on the bread. Everyone loved this sandwich and it was so easy and fast to get to the table.  The sandwich with a side of coleslaw was a perfect meal.  Going to make this again for sure.

These are delicious. I never would have thought to use poultry seasoning on grilled chicken. It worked great. I flattened the chicken first, toasted the buns on the grill, added a slice of avocado, and left off the pickle. Everything else stayed the same. I will make these again.

Great sandwich.  To make a good recipe even better, I pounded the chicken breasts to a uniform size and sprinkled with Tastefully Simple's season salt (which has a nice kick).  Husband ate with garlic mayo and BBQ sauce; daughter and I ate w/o the bun and added garlic mayo and sliced avocado.  So good, and thank you for sharing!

Great inspiration! I sprinkled on a local favorite "BBQ seasoning with sugar", grilled and basted with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Placed bacon on top and a slice of swiss cheese and grilled until melted. Toasted Brat Bun on grill. Added onions, tomatoes and lettuce. Fabulous!!

We've had this twice now.  The first time as laid out.  The second time was a big hit.  I made it using sourdough bread and everyone loved it.

This was a perfect, and quick dinner idea but I'm not sure how I felt about only using poultry seasoning...may add a little bit more to it

This was a great sandwich! I just seasoned the chicken with salt, didn't use pickles or onion, toasted the bun and used mayo. Yummy!

These are great sandwiches....to cut fat...I used turkey bacon, and also used McCormick Grillmates Smokehouse Maple seasoning instead of poultry seasoning....went great with the bacon and pepperjack! I also topped with grilled red onion slices and Sweet Baby Rays Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce.....amazing!

Good with or without the bun!  Next time I will try to marinade the chicken to give it more flavor and juiciness.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Excellent sandwich. Everybody in the family gives it 5 stars. I didn't have poultry seasoning so I used Grill Mates mesquite marinade and cooked the chicken on a George Foreman grill. This sandwich goes well on the soft sandwich buns recipe on this site.

I used a pre-cook rotissery chicken and added a bit of bar-b-que seasoning.  I had the pickles on the side with potato salad.  Mmmm

Easy to make and great taste.  The next time we make them, I will pound out the chicken breast a bit to make it a little easier to eat, but wouldn't change a thing after that - though I'm sure you can add your own spin to it!

Not sure that I am a fan of the Poultry Seasoning, however, the rest of the sandwich was a HUGE HIT in my home.  Will make it again and try other seasoning Combos!

I cooked the chicken in the hot bacon drippings rather than on the grill, but the sandwich was still delicious! A very nice combination of flavors and textures. Similar to a BLT, only better.

My guys liked this.   Am I the  only one to think homemade sandwiches are so good but are such a pain to make. LOL!!!  Everyone says it's so easy- I think sammies Are one of the most labor intensive dinners. Oh well... Added a tsp of salt and a TBS of lemon juice to the poultry seasoning as a marinade. Somewhere between the market and home my poor tomato went missing. :( otherwise made as written with turkey bacon (grilled that too) and I cut up a gorgeous loaf of sourdough. This does need a sauce or condiment of some kind.  I've been requested to make it again- if it's not too much trouble. HA HA.

Absolutely wonderful! I season the chicken generously with salt & pepper as well as the poultry seasoning. I also coat well with olive oil to not only prevent sticking, but to keep the chicken moist. I pound the cutlets thin and cook for 1 1/2 minutes on each side. They are perfect everyone time. I also top with homemade guacamole.

I used fresh mozzarella cheese, since I had it on hand.  My finicky husband gave it 3 and a half stars out of 5, I give it 4 stars since it was quick and easy to make.

My family always loves this. I use 2 chicken breasts for 4 sandwiches and I pound them to about 1/4". I season with salt and pepper and just fry with oil.

Great sandwich. I used white american cheese for the kids and added ranch dressing. It was delicious!
