This recipe is easy and turns out exactly like you want it to- great firm consistency after refrigeration( I refrigerated mine overnight before slicing) and tastes great!  I even doubled the recipe to make two pies at once and they were both perfect.  I did not put the whipped cream and cherries on top until right at serving and I put them on the individual slices already on plates to keep it from getting too messy when slicing.  Family loves it!  Definitely a recipe I will keep on hand.
