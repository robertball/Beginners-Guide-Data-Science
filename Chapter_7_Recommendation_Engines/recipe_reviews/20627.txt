I made this for my husbands graduation party and it was great!  I could not find just raspberry sherbet the only thing that I could find was the orange, pineapple, raspberry sherbet so I used that and it still turned out great!  I had lots of people ask me for the recipe.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Very good. Also put a lemon ice ring in it and it tasted good that way too. The sherbet melts funny on the top so after awhile don't forget to stir it once in awhile

After going through many punch recipes I chose this one because it didn't call for any sugar. And good thing, it's sweet enough. I used Sprite and followed the directions exactly. Once the raspberry sherbet melted a bit it was much better. Great flavor!

A very easy to make and very tasty. I added a package of frozen strawberries, and the whole bowl was gone very fast. Should have made 2x as much.

This was definitely a five--a delicate pink punch (PERFECT for a baby girl baby shower), and rave reviews from all who tried it.  Very tasty, very pretty AND incredibly simple with few ingredients that were easy to find.  A keeper!

Fantastic... made it for a potluck and it disappeared instantaneously. Everyone loved it and it's wicked easy. I'll still try other recipes, but at some point I'm sure I'll make it again.

Disappeared in less than 45 minutes. Unfortunately, i thought it would last and didn't have anything on hand to make more. Next time I will.

This was excellent.  I used it for a wedding recpetion I was catering and everyone loved it. The one piece of advice I'd give is that it gets very, very frothy when you add everything together so make sure your punch bowl is big enough for a volume increase once it's all combined.   The first batch I made was too close to the top and it started over flowing when I put in the sherbet and it started fizzing and bubbling everywhere. But after I figured that out, I was fine and it was a hit.

I made this for a bridal shower I was hosting, and it was a big hit.  I'm not a fan of sherbet in punch, since it seems to make the punch too sweet.  But this was great!  It had just the right amount of tartness that I love in punch.  I ended up having to make 2 batches, because all the ladies came back for more!  I will definitely make this one again.

This punch is FANTASTIC and so easy to make!  I've made it for a large birthday party that I hosted, as well as a bridal shower.  I had to make 2 batches for each party (of about 30 guests).  I would just make the first batch and refill when necessary.  This punch is light and fruity, not too heavy or cloyingly sweet like other punches I've tried.  I always float raspberries in mine to make it extra pretty.  A suggestion when making it is to make sure you have a large enough punch bowl!  This does foam quite a bit when you first make it, but it does settle down after 5-10 minutes. So do prepare it about 10 minutes before guests arrive so they can easily serve themselves without it spilling over if you have a smaller punch bowl.  I have never received so many compliments on a punch before.

Very good. I used half the amount of sherbet and only 2 liters of soda. Not too sweet, not too tart, just right.

This was a hit at the bridal shower I threw. I should have doubled the amount because it ran out quickly. One small modification: used 1/2 diet sprite and 1/2 regular and it turned out great!

Wish I could post a picture - this punch was so pretty.  I made it because the ingredients sounded good and because of its name.  Everyone at my sister's baby shower loved this punch.  I am looking forward to making it again.

A HUGE hit. I couldn't find raspberry sherbet but used pineapple instead and it was great!  I'll be making this one again for my baby's 1st birthday party.

I made this punch for a baby shower I hosted, it's the FIRST time ever that I ran out of punch!
This was a HUGE hit!  So easy and delicious!
and I'm not usually a big fan of punch!

I made this for a party recently and it was universally loved. Many people commented that it was the best punch they've ever had. The ratios can be fiddled with a bit and it still turns out great. I used a potato masher to incorporate the sherbet and that worked really well.

So good!  The thing I love about this is how versatile it is.  We used 2 cans do welch's strawberry breeze, 7-up, and pineapple/raspberry/orange sherbet.  Oh my.  One batch was definitely not enough for a party of 8-year old girls.

Love it!  So easy & quick to make. My 12 year old daughter had her friends over for a movie night and they couldn't stop raving about how delicious it was.  My husband and I loved it too.  This one is a crowd pleaser for all ages.

This was a hit at the baby shower I recently hosted. I could only fit 1 2-liter bottle of Sprite in the punch bowl, but it was still great. We finished the whole thing!

This was a great tasting recipe and simple to prepare!  We made a double batch for my best friend's bridal shower and it completly disappeared within about 30 minutes!! Very attractive too!!  I will probably make this punch for my upcoming wedding!!!!  Thank you for this simple to follow recipe!

I served this punch at my daughter’s graduation reception and received many compliments. The only change I made was using rainbow sherbet as requested by my daughter.

I've made this several times now and everyone always raves about how great it is! My go to punch recipe! My only suggestion is to soften the sherbet for an hour or two at room temp so it's easier to combine. Keep extra ingredients to whip up more when everyone drinks it faster than you'd expect!
