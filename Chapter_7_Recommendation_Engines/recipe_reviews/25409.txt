This was good comfort food, nothing fancy but good.  I made a few changes: I added a little garlic powder to the hamburger as it was browning, after hamburger browned-I added the potatoes and browned them as well.  Color was better.  Then I added some worchestershire sauce to the beef broth and cooked uncovered until the broth almost evaporated.  Yu

With a few adjustments to meet family needs this recipe is a keeper.  What I added: liquid beef stock, diced carrots and celery, basil, parsley, garlic powder, salt & pepper and Worcestershire sauce.  I also used flour to thicken it so it had a nice, rich gravy.  The kids ate it up.

This has become a family favorite.  I didn't think it could get much easier, but I was in a hurry last night and substituted a pound of frozen hashbrowns for the potatoes and it worked just fine.  I also add worcestershire sauce as well as garlic and onion.  We will also top it with cheese sometimes.  Thanks for sharing!

I used other reveiwers advice and I added garlic salt, worchestershire sauce, and cornstarch at the end. I also used cavender's spice--I put cavender's spice on everything. In the end, I put salsa and cheese on top. The salsa really brings out the flavor, it almost makes it takes like some imaginary authentic mexican dish. I will be keeping this one for the next time that I'm low in stock in the pantry. Thanks!

This turned out very well w/ some tweeks and additions.  First, I didn't want mushy potatoes, so I cubed 2 potatoes w/ the skin on and browned them in olive oil. In a separate pan, I browned the meat, onions, some red bell pepper and garlic, along w/ garlic powder & onion powder.  When that was done, I drained the fat & added the browned potatoes.  then I added about 1/2 pkg. of Lipton onion soup and maybe a third cup of water and cooked a little longer.  Delicious! I served corn on the side, but you could add that as well. This did not have a gravy to it, but tasted sooo good.

I doubled this and added a bit of garlic and this recipe came out exactly as I anticipated. After reading through the reviews and looking at the submitted photo's I realize technique and expectation varies widely. Some are adding thickeners to make a gravy and describe it as stew like when I was after something like popping a can of hash.  I diced the the potato and onion very small for starters and left some of the fat after browning the beef and onion. I brought it to a low simmer and stirred occasionally, uncovered, until all the liquid was gone and it started to brown a little (took about an hour). I refrigerated it overnight and in the morning made patties and pan fried them in a bit of olive oil until crusty on both sides, but soft in the middle. Absolutely delicious topped with a couple eggs.

This was great with leftover taco meat - seasoned it right up!

We topped it with a little cheese, sour cream, salsa and avocado.

this is a sure a quick easy meal; however, it is very plain. I ended up using advice of others reviewers and putting in cream of mushroom, worcestershire, lawrys, black pepper, and several different seasonings to spice it up. Another plus: great leftovers.

Part of the fun of cooking is either making your own recipes or using a base recipe to create something to your own tastes! This recipe is a wonderful base. Personally I added fresh garlic, cilantro, hot sauce, green onions, and a dash of raspberry vinaigrette as well as 3tbsp. of starch @ the end. Also used small red potatoes..everything I had on hand! Definitely make this again when winter rolls around - thanks!

I thought this was excellent!  It's the day before payday so our cupboards were BARE.  I had the essential ingredients and thought this would be the perfect recipe!  I followed others suggestions and added some garlic.  I also threw in a can of mushrooms, green beans and some frozen corn.  I overcooked it waiting for my husband to come home, so it ended up like a hearty stew.  I think it is very tasty!  Easily altered to taste!  Great for a small budget but truly filling and TASTY!

I added some cornstarch to help thicken it up. My husband really enjoyed it. It was something different. I think I may add some cream of celery soup to it next time for a little something different too.

My best friend's mom made this for dinner atleast three nights a week when we were growing up. I choose to make this because I wasn't sure what to do with my pound of ground beef and making this reminded me of her mom! I didn't really care for the bouillon, she never used it, always just salt and pepper.

Easy, fast and good!
I added 1/2 cup of fresh cut carrots, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt, and 1 can green beans.  I cooked as directed and it came out great!  We all had seconds.

My family liked this.  I shredded the potatoes and  added shredded carrots.  Also added garlic, worcestershire, and a little basil.  I used less water to brown the potatoes more.  It turned out great.
*update* I've cooked this without any added water, plus I rolled the shredded potatoes in a towel before adding it to the pan to dry them a bit.   We liked the texture much better that way.

Homemade Hamburger Helper!  I used leftover potatoes from a roast, chopped into small cubes.  I also used beef broth and some steak seasoning instead of the bouillon and water.  Threw in carrots and some chopped collard greens for extra veggies and it was really good!  My kids were skeptical but once they took a bite, they were happy.

Just what I was looking for. I did an ingredients search for potatoes and ground beef and found this simple recipe. I used beef broth instead of bouillon. After the potatoes were soft, I stirred about 2 T. flour into 1/4 c. milk and then stirred it into the broth to make a thicker gravy. Like another reviewer said, it's nothing fancy but it was simple, fast, and called for only a few ingredients which I already had on hand.

I cooked this during Ice Storm '09. I live in Kentucky and was among the 600,000+ without power. I used a propane campstove so I had to add more time but it worked great. I used beef broth instead of boulion and also added some seasoning salt and a can of whole kernel corn. It turned out great and warmed us up real good- which we needed since heat was scarce right then. LOL. Now that we have power again I am cooking it for dinner tonight, with a real stove.

I don't think my husband was too impressed, but I thought it made a good easy meal and the most amazing thing is that all 4 of my kids ate it. I added some worcestershire sauce and could have added even more.  I used two beef boullion cubes and a leftover beef seasoning packet from a pack of ramen noodles, added extra potatoes and threw in a can of corn, served with cornbread.  I will make it again.

I spent a long time looking for this recipe.  It is a simple recipe, and mother used to make it often.  I have become a gourmet cook - trouble is, fancy look-alikes of this recipe do not turn out well in my opinion.  When you start adding things to this, you mess with its great, simple comfort food taste.  This is an excellent old fashioned recipe that is delicious just as it is, and is unbelievably easy to make. 
 
I used liquid beef broth for this (make sure beef is the first ingredient on the label, ok? or it won't work.) 

I am so thankful to you Rhonda M. for this!  It takes me back in time.

This was a really quick, one pan meal. I took some readers advice and added garlic when browning, and some worcestershire sauce after. It wasn't the greatest thing I've eaten, kind of plain. I would've only given it 3 stars, but my husband liked it and my 3 year old (who always pushes away her dinner) loved it. I will make it again.

I added carrots and used beef broth instead of beef bullion.  Oh, and I seasoned the meat with garlic powder and italian seasoning.  Great different way to use ground beef.

So Simple and Good.  I added 3 carrots.  Other than that I made it exactly to the original recipe and the whole family loved it.

This was a very good recipe, but not 5 star.  I felt like the recipe on its own was a bit bland, and needed some jazzing up, as others noted.  One key step is the browning of the potatotes.  Need to add the potatoes to the ground beef when it is nearly browned, to give the potatoes the crispness and color of hash.  I also added some seasonings and garlic as noted by others and used a can of beef broth.  My 12 year old daughter absolutely loved it...thanked me after the first bite!

Very nice recipe, my only change was to add a package of dry onion soup mix for the flavoring.

I'm giving this recipe four stars because the hash tasted so good, but the liquid never boiled down, so it was more like hash soup.  We added some Worchestershire sauce and corn as others recommended.  Next time I'll add far less water.

Very very yummy!! I changed very little of this wonderful recipe. I added a shake or two of garlic salt, added some corn, and I modified the recipe for 2 people instead of 4. 
Wonderful and Delicious! Thank you for sharing!!

Excellent and super easy - just four ingredients.  I used beef base because I didn't have boullion.  Recipe is great - wouldn't change a thing.  But might experiment by adding carrots, peas, etc. when feeling adventurous.

This recipe is just so-so as written, but can be great with a few tweaks. I added 2 tbls of garlic seasoning and a bit of diced onion. It's best with brown gravy over it. Add some carrots and corn for "pot pie without the crust". Good stuff.

This recipe was great for a night when I had very few ingredients on hand. I did add some things to spice it up.

I browned the meat & onion adding garlic powder, 2 mashed garlic cloves, salt and pepper, worcestorshire sauce, a packet of Sazon' seasoning & onion powder.

Then I added the cubed potatoes and fresh sliced carrots. I used beef broth to cover and simmered for 30 minutes. Lastly I added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to a little broth and thickened it at the end. It was really good and definitly a comforting dish.

I added cornstarch and water to thicken this as I didn't see how it could thicken on its own.  My teenager wouldn't eat it at all.  I thought the flavor was okay, but will keep searching for a better recipe.

This recipe was ok. But I switched it up a bit. Cooked the meat in beef broth, added some garlic flakes and seasoning salt. I also boiled the potatoes in beef broth and water until tender, then put them in with the hamburger and browned them up. I then sprinkled on a bit more seasoning salt and garlic to taste, and added 3 large eggs until cooked. Then served.  And instead of onions I used leeks.

To me, it was bland. I don't know if my bouillon is old,  or what, though when I make this again, I will crisp up the potatoes first, and perhaps add a ranch flavor to it? I added about a 1/4 cup of water, let it evaporate, thickened it, and added corn, fresh garlic and cheddar cheese, salt & pepper to wake it up. Will be tweaking this recipe again.

Sorry  I did not like this at all.  The potatoes were way too mushy.  I even cut the simmer time in half to 15 min. then evaporated most of the juice off for 15 more minutes on med-high.  The potatoes just took in too much liquid.  The whole dish was mushy with no texture.

Really good. Deserves a 5 star because it is so simple and inexpensive. I added celery, extra onion, extra garlic, 2 bay leaves, etc. Followed suggestions from others. Family loved it, and that's all that matters!

This was a great and quick meal! It wasn't over the top in taste for me, but I liked it. My pickiest of eater, my 2yr old cleaned his bowl! I added the Worcestershire sauce, fresh minced garlic and cheese as recommended. On top of that I chopped up some carrots and celery I had in the fridge and tossed that in for color and flavor. My heart was warmed by watching my whole family enjoy the meal! I made a big pot of the hash and when I returned home from work the next morning, there was only an 8oz bowl of it left in the fridge!

We loved it! This is a terrific base recipe that is easy to modify to your families personal preferences.  I didn't have beef boullion so I used the chicken instead and it still tasted wonderful.  I did have to add a bit of salt and pepper to jazz up the taste a bit.  For fun I've added Ken's Sweet Videlia Onion salad dressing (instead of an onion) and added a bit of garlic too (I used the kind that comes in a jar).  I'd read that others felt it was too thin of a mixture, but I let mine simmer for a while with the lid on and it thickened up beautifully ~ no need to add flour or anything like that.  Thanks for listing this yummy recipe ~ it's a huge hit with my family!

Tastes the best with scrambled eggs. There's nothing I love more than hash, eggs and sausages on a Sunday morning, and I am not a breakfast food person either. In addition we add green onions, and occasionally substitute plain ground beef for corned beef, or melt some cheddar cheese in there. Try it and you will not be disappointed.

This is so simple, made with ingredients you have on hand. Even without the beef bouillon (I didn't have this ingredient.)  I used frozen diced potatos so I didn't use the water.  This dish will be gone fast.

Good stuff quick, which is my favorite sort of recipe.

I also liked this little trick I pulled. Instead of potatoes, I added carrots and turnips, so it took longer to cook and I had to add water during the simmer process. After that, I added about a tablespoon of whole wheat flour (for the fiber) and mixed it so it got real thick. That's how I get the ankle biters to eat their vegetables!

This was a good "base" recipe, but was in need of some flavor. I added some minced garlic, fresh mushrooms, worcestershire, and lots of fresh ground pepper. My husband loved it - I will make it again with the tweaks.

Sorry, this one was not for us.  I followed the advice of others and added garlic, worchestershire, and other seasonings, but all I could taste was bland and blah.  It had the consistency of thick soup.  It was tolerable, but thats all.  The family participated in a "destroying of the recipe" party.

Very easy to make!!  Great leftovers...I used brown gravy mix instead of boullion cubes.  Works much better!

I have eaten this since I was a child. It is a dish that is associated with going to Grandma's house. The only difference is that she added a bit of green pepper to her recipe and also thickened it with a bit of corn starch. My mom makes it as the recipe states-cooked down but still with a bit of green pepper. Bread and butter is always a must have with this dish for our family. I like this especially in the winter.

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I made a lot of revisions.  I added fresh minced garlic, worchestershire sauce, chopped carrots and celery.  Then, added shredded cheese and salsa, which kicked it up a notch.

I think the recipe would be better with russetts. I used red potatoes that I had in my garden. It wasn't very flavorful, so I added garlic, seasoned salt, corn and pepper. It turned out good, but soupy. It was probably the red potatoes that didn't absorb enough water.

Made this dish tonight w/ a few variations. Browned ground beef w/ chopped onions, drained. Added potatoes, whole kernel sweet corn undrained, water, packet of Lipton onion soup mix, salt, pepper, garlic powder, soy sauce. Put foil over my pan let cook till potatoes were tender. Buttered some Italian bread slices browned in oven. Dinner was a success.

Good recipe but not enough seasoning. I added a bit extra bouillon as well as garlic powder and pepper. A good winter meal.

No offense to the recipe poster..but not sure what she was going for.  I thought hey easy way to make hash.  Um no.  Followed the directions precisely.  Came out like a hamburger and potato stew type of deal.  I thought I could "make" it into hash by cooking it longer and higher temp and without the lid on.  Nope.  Made it a bit thicker but end result was the same.  I decided to leave well enough alone and go with a hamburger potato stew for dinner that night.  However, I must say the flavor was good.  That might be because I added a tablespoon of garlic, added salt and pepper as well.  Giving it 2 stars because it was not hash but stew.  I dont think water should have been added at all.  If any very little.  Maybe instead of water a little bit of a stock or broth.  I will stick to making hamburger hash the traditional way.  Sorry but I wont make it again and not something I recommend.  It wasn't the disaster that some people had but I made it work and it was a success.  I'm an advanced cook been at it for years.  So, I can make things better if the recipes dont turn out like they are supposed to.  Like I said no offense to Rhonda_M.  It just didnt turn out how it should have.

Hi, I just made this for dinner tonight.  It was very delicious.  I think I added to much water because it was somewhat soupy.   Next time I will not add so much water.  Thanks for this great tasting recipe.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.

Delicious!  Perfect comfort food.  I added a chopped garlic clove to the onions and meat (I always sub ground turkey).  Used about 8 medium, peeled and chopped red potatoes.  Added a can of drained corn at the end.  Thickened it up a bit with corn starch.  Topped with cheddar cheese!

I am glad to see this recipe. My dad used to make it from the Army (WW II). Anyway, our original recipe was only hamburger, potatoes and onions w/salt & pepper.  I used to wind up adding a ton of salt.  But now I like to add a can of flavored tomatoes (like chili-ready or w/green chillies) as well as the garlic & green pepper. I love worchestershire but not in this. Haven't tried beef bouillon but I'm sure it would add depth.

Excellent and simple, but takes much longer than stated to reduce nicely. I use beef broth instead of water/bouillon and simmer for 2-3 hours instead of 30 minutes.

This was pretty good. My husband loved it, and my 5 yr old ate some too (she's picky). I liked it, the potatoes and carrots came out wonderfully (I'll admit I did pre-cook them first, so they'd be softer), and although the beef had a good flavor, I think I needed better ground beef. I may try this next time with stew meat instead. I also added a little onion powder, and celery salt. Very easy, and overall tasted great, for as simple as it is.

This is a good kid friendly recipe especially on those days when you are short on time and ingredients. It's not going to knock your socks off but it is a better option than fast food. You will need to add spices and veggies to suit your individual taste. Not a bad meal for the amount of effort. I will be making this one again.

Made this last night becase I had some ground beef and potatoes that needed to be used up.  Not a bad, quick, filling meal.  I cooked it as it and added some worcestershire, garlic powder, salt and pepper and only used on boullion cube.  Served with a side of sauted zucchini.

As everyone else said, this is a good starter. I added: garlic (fresh), worcestershire sauce, 1 Tb or so of a vegie spice blend, 1-2 tsp of cumin or so and only added water little by little as it evaporated, thus avoiding the "soup" that so many complained about! As a last minute, "I have nothing in my kitchen" reciped I would repeat it. Thanks.

this recipe was yery yummy but i had to doctor it up a bit. first i didnt have any beef bouillon so i substituted it with beef broth and about 2 cups of water. i also added garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, and salt and pepper. i waited and waited for almost an hour for the juices to go down but it didnt happen so i just served this meal as a soup with garlic bread it was a hit at my table.

Leave out the boullion and make it the way my dad did.  After adding spices, potatoes, and onions to the ground beef, over cook it until the potatoes will mash easily.  Mash the mix so that some of the potatoes become part of the water mix. When it's totally boiled down to where you like it, then add an entire stick of butter.  Stir carefully and serve.  This is my favorite. ughh, no worsty sauce either.

Like everyone else said- a great starter. Add some minced garlic, worshtershire sauce, pepper, salt, cumin, seasonall, and it's a great main course. I omited the bullion b/c I like to experiment with spices. I only added enough water to soften the potatoes, and some flour to keep it from being runny.

My family really enjoyed this.  I also added carrots, a little minced garlic, some parsley for color and thickened with corn starch.  Reminded me of an inexpensive quick version of beef stew. Will be adding this into the meal "routine".

I added one tablespoon of worchestershire sauce, 1 teaspoon of salt and a dash of pepper. Also, when I slightly browned the potatoes and onions, I added a teaspoon of minced garlic. I cooked it over medium heat for 30 minutes, and my super picky husband loved it! I will definently make this recipe again.

this recipe was a good starting idea. i made a few modifications.
i carmelized 1 small onion chopped and 2 cloves garlic in 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp butter added the ground beef, cooked until browned, drained off fat.  added 3 potatoes chopped into 1 inch cubes, 2 carrots sliced, 1 bay leaf, 3 cups water and 1 tbsp beef stock base and black pepper, parsley, oregano, cayanne to taste.
30 minutes to simmer, 10 to cool and served it with sour dough bread.  my kids loved this, the pan was empty.

Good, quick and easy. Used southern style hash brown potatoes, beef buillon, and whatever veggies I had in the freezer. Kids ate it well.

I sensed this would be too plain without modifying it a bit, but I was out of garlic and Worcestershire sauce. Instead, I added about 2 tsp of Montreal Steak Spice, salt and pepper, and it came out great. We all enjoyed it, even the 2 kids, and I'll be making it again.

I'm only giving this 4 stars because of my own screw up. I added the W sauce and some salt, and it was disgustingly salty. Again, that's my own fault. Next time I will have to try it without the sauce. Either that or cut back on it. Can anyone tell me how much sauce they added?

This was a great recipe. However, I made a lot of personal touches with the recommendations of other reviewers. I added chopped carrots, minced garlic, garlic salt, salt, black pepper and Worcestershire sauce. My husband [who is the chef of the family] said he loved it, and didn't have to add any seasoning at all. My picky 5 yr old said it was her favorite food from now on! Great recipe!

Using ground beef, I added carrots, about 1/2 cup of rice, and a few squirts of Worcestershire sauce with liberal amounts of pepper and a few sprinkles of seasoning salt.  Much better than when I used left-over roast beef.  I also diced the potatoes instead of slicing them.

I added worseshire sauce and other things the other reviewers added.  I personally thought it was a 4, a guest over absolutely loved it and gave it a 5, and my fiance gave it a 2 - it wasn't his favorite dish and thought it needed more flavor.  So it is easy to see this is a dish to each individuals taste.

I found this recipe to be very plain--good if you're used to a bland, meat-and-potatoes sort of fare.  Broth was very thin.  I, too, had to add corn starch to make it work. Won't use this recipe again.

I too was looking for something quick and easy and required few ingredients.  I added Meat Magic Seasoning to the mix.  I must have added too much water so I put in some frozen corn and sweet petite peas.  It turned out very good.  No leftovers!

I'm not very good at improvising but I felt like this recipe could have used something to spice it up some.  It was great for when you don't know what else to fix and don't have much in the pantry.

Great base recipe for nondairy or no wheat diets! I also had potatoes and burger but didn’t know what to do. This was a great chance to have my son experiment with spices while staying on diet. It’s one I want him to take with him when he moves out because you can add in whatever you have on hand.

I did make changes. I added 2 cups of beef broth. I also added some bell pepper, salt, pepper, garlic salt. I used 6 regular sized potatoes and a pound and a half of ground beef. The kids loved it. They put it in tortillas. I will be making this again.

So I know what I made isn't technically this recipe but I only had so many ingredients and used what I had. I doubled this recipe since a big family. I didn't have beef bouillon but I had lipton beefy onion soup mixes. So I used 2 packs with 4 cups of water. I also browned the potatoes before adding to the meat and seasoned the meat with adobo, parsley, and basil. I also added some Worcestershire sauce like other recommended. It was a huge hit. So flavorful. 2lbs of meat, 3 lbs of potatoes and it was gone in one sitting. Never even made it to the fridge. So easy too, will definitely make again.

Brown the potatoes first, then when the potatoes are just starting to soften add the onions. Cook stirring frequently until the onions are tender, then add the hamburger, cook until no longer pink. I use red pepper flakes and onion powder, and some garlic salt for seasoning., I've been making this dish for many years. It is the perfect meal when you just want to get dinner on the table.

We really liked this recipe. It was flavorful without being very spicy. I will change one thing. I did not read that I should or should not drain the hamburger after browning it. So, I only drained off about half of the juices. In the future I will definitely drain off as much as I can and maybe replace it with a little water if needed.

Great recipe! Added garlic and a fresh sprig of rosemary. Also thickened the sauce with cornstarch.

Good dinner in a pinch and when you are on a tight budget. Filling but flavor is a bit boring.

I made it but I think you are supposed to remove the cover and not leave it on? I tried with cover on and 30 minutes later due to condensation I had the same amount of water covering the potatoes and meat? So I removed the cover and approximately 30 minutes later the water had evaporated.
I will not be making again.

I will make this again. I added a diced carrot, celery, cut the onion to only 1/3 cup and added a minced shallot and garlic. For seasonings I used thyme, cumin and paprika toward the end. I went for a drier version, chopping my potatoes rather small and letting the  pan ingredients get nice and toasty before adding about 2/3 cup of water. Simmered until potatoes were a little beyond al dente but not mushy. This dish has a lot of possibilities - different veggies, seasonings, etc.

Just like mom used to make! She would always add diced bell pepper or green chile, and for color, kitchen bouquet...yea who has that in their spice cupboard? ?? this gal! Since I added bouquet, I cut the bouillon down to 1/2, added bell pepper & ate on open faced biscuits. Perfection! Thanks for the recipe!

It was good but with the amount of bouillon it suggested, it came out too salty tasting. Next time I'll just use less.

I added minced garlic.   Also I could not get the  water to evaporate that much so I ended up having to drain it which made me loose a lot of the flavor (I am sure I did something wrong).  Since I lost the flavor we decided to add cheese to it for more flavor.  After all that, once the cheese got put in it...the kids told me that they love the dish.

I was wanting something quick and easy for supper last night so I found this. I did make a few changes per reading the reviews. I browned the potatoes as i cooked the meat and onions. I also put the mixture in a pan and topped with potatoes and cheese then backed for 0 minutes. My husband liked it but me not so much.

My family has been making this since I was a child and now I make it for my husband and myself.  It's great comfort food, especially on a cold winter's day.  The only difference in the recipe is that we've always added a couple cans of cream style corn to it.  It's soo good!!

My Dad was big on hamburger hash from his WWII army days and probably wouldn't approve of the following changes, as he had said it wouldn't be 'hamburger hash' if you changed it. I've liked it for many years but it can be quite bland especially if you don't like adding much salt to recipes.

Some things I liked in it is the addition of green pepper, garlic salt, and a jar of salsa (your favorite kind). Helps with the flavor aspect. 
With some crusty bread on the side, my son started liking it too.

I used frozen potatoes and added a Dry Onion Soup Mix packet - like another reviewer did.  I only added 2c of water because other reviewers mentioned it being soupy.  It thickened up nicely... But it was still a little bland and mushy. It was so easy.  And a little salt helped.  I'll probably make it again

Excellent way to use leftover browned ground beef & onions.  I did add worcestershire sauce as per many other reviewers and then to make the dish more hash-like in appearance I scooped the meat and potatoes out of the liquid (it hadn't all reduced by the time the potatoes were cooked) and browned the hash in a skillet.

This recipe was okay. I added garlic powder, onion seasoning, seasoning salt, corn, and used beef broth instead of water. Yet, I still found it a bit plain. Also, the potatoes took FOREVER to cook. Way longer than half an hour. I would suggest browning them in a separate pan first. Overall, not bad. I don't think I'll be making this one again.

I have not tried this recipe yet but it is a lot like one my wife cooks, but I have to doctor hers after she is finished (shhhh........)because she likes her food bland and I like seasonings and some spice. So I expect that this is a little bland for my taste but it can be fixed and bdesides it is hard to totally screw up hamburger hash.  Thanks for posting.

Recipe as written is good and quick but by adding a few things it definitely takes it to 5 stars for me.  I add carrots, celery if I have it, worcestershire sauce, garlic, and after about half way done I put in BUNCH  of frozen corn, it really adds flavor.  Add cornstarch or flour if needs a little thickening.  Some toppers I use sometime are chedder cheese, sour cream, and/or french fried onions.

Hash= meat + potato + onions + salt and pepper + water/broth. Once the water has cooked down keep on cooking to put a crust on meat/potato/onion mixture. It brings out the flavor of the meat and puts a crisp on the potato. Yum. I've used beef, pork, ham, corned beef and even chicken. I've never had a hash with gravy...that seems like more of a stroganoff or stew dish. Thanks for posting a good, basic, yummy hash recipe RHONDA_M!

Worth trying when you are short on time and ingredients.  I added some adobo.  The kids added shredded cheddar at the table.  It was good with some canned corn on the side -- dad mixed his in :-)

I make this quiet often and have been making it for years. It's one of my family's favorites! I usually add a bit of oregano, some garlic, and a splash of worcestershire sauce..sometimes I'll throw in fresh/frozen green beans, corn or carrots (or all three). I have even made this with ground venison. Great recipe and a great comfort food!

There is not nearly enough seasonings.  I added salt, pepper, & garlic, but this could just be personal taste.  Also threw in green beans & corn.  I let mine simmer for about 45 minutes.  Great way to use up pantry items!

Paired with peas and it was awesome! Didn't use onions though. A little bland so I had to add salt, but it was still good

Very good.  I had to keep adding seasonings to give it more tastes, but a great recipes, just season with what you like.  I used some celery seed, worchisire sauce (sp), garlic powder and onion powder.  So easy to make.  Thank you, will make this again.  Great served with biscuits

This was a good base recipe, I added worchestershire sauce, garlic powder, garlic salt and some Mrs. Dash to the meat as I cooked it. I used beef paste instead of bouillon. I also let it cook until the potatoes started to brown and get crispy.

this was a huge hit with my kids. I used garlic too and used a can beef broth instead. I also added shredded cheese which the kids loved. Also used some parsley and veg spice. My son told me it's a keeper :)

this is pretty close to a recipe that I have been making since my kids were small. I always add garlic and a little chopped green bell pepper if I have it.  Just basic dinner but good...my kids always topped with ketchup.  I never put water in it though, just browned the ground beef, added onions,potatoes seasoning and pepper, then cooked till potatoes were done.

This works when you're down to the basics - but you absolutely have to doctor it up, or you'll have flavorless stuff in front of you.  I added an extra bouillon cube, carrots, celery, Penzey's dehyd green & red bell peppers, more onion, garlic, parsley, Worcestershire, basil, Cayenne, TONS of Salt and Pepper, and two cans of Cream Of Mushroom.   I served it in soup bowls with those new Cole's Cheese Filled Breadstix on the side.

This was pretty good. I think on its own it would be a little bland, but with a few spice additions (garlic, cajun seasoning, a little parsley, carmalized onions, and carrots) it was good. A welcome addition to the rotation. Thanks for posting!!

Seemed quite bland alone. Followed advice in reviews and added Worcester sauce. I added onion and garlic powder and hot sauce. Also, cornstarch for thicker sauce. Probably won't be making again, even with these additions.

My most favorite way of eating this is with potatoes, celery and carrots added.  I call it my comfort food.  I could eat it all day! After browning the meat I don't drain it at all, I just add in the veggies, season with a little (not too much because it'll all condense down in the end) salt, pepper and a little Montreal Chicken seasoning, water to cover (usually ends up being about 2 cups) and two beef bouillon cubes. After 30 minutes I stir in some flour and serve it on top of rice. It's definitely nothing fancy but it's sooo good!

This is a great starter recipe.  I sounded a little bland the way it was so I added minced garlic, corse ground black pepper, and mexican seasoning to the ground beef. I used canned potatoes, carrots and corn for the veggies. It was good for something quick and easy.

this was just ok. for me it was somewhere between a chop suey and a stew, and the flavor wasn't all that good. Not sure if I would make it again. It's a great recipe for someone who doesn't know there way around a kitchen and is looking to build some confidence.

Nice quick dinner. I did however make some changes based on a previous review which I think really enhanced the flavor. First, I add do not use MSG, so I substituted the bouillon and water for homemade beef stock (Yum!). I also added chopped carrots, celery and garlic to get some veggys into the meal. And for additional flavor I added fresh basil, parsley, salt and pepper. I also added about 1/4 c. flour to the veggys, sauteed then in the pan for a bit and the added the broth so that it would thicken. The result was wonderful and the original recipe was a nice springboard. My husband and son liked it very much.

This is a very tasty stew-like meal for a chilly fall day.  Instead of hamburger I cubed some steak.  I also added carrots and mushrooms and some celery.  It seemed very soupy so I just added some cornstarch and it turned out thick and hearty. I took some of the suggestions from some other reviews and added garlic powder as well. I served it up with some warm rolls and my husband was a happy man! Very easy to make - I would make it again.

This was just an o.k. meal for meal.  It was pretty bland.  I think I made the potatoes too small, and the whole thing turned mushy.  I will not be making this again.

I was looking for something quick and easy to do with a pound of hamburger, so gave this a shot.  I used a couple leftover half-bags of hash browns (Southern, diced style) and Campbells beef broth in the soup size can.  I also added some garlic (from the jar), some cornstarch to the broth, and a bit of Worchestershire.  And found that it was still utterly bland!  I think I might add some shredded carrots to it for tomorrow and put it in a crust to make pasties.  Top it with ketchup and I think it'll be pretty tasty!  Sorry, this sounded pretty good and I didn't want to grade it too harshly because I did make a couple of substitutions/additions.  

On the other hand, the Southern-style hash browns were perfect for this and didn't get mushy.  I put them in frozen.  Just wondering if the person who used hash browns that turned to mush either used shredded potatoes, or thawed them first?

I took another reviewer's suggestion that using hash browns works great...it did not! The whole dish turned into complete mush. I guess I would have to of omitted the water entirely, but I didn't, I just used less. Then, when I used a bit of corn starch to thicken it - it just got mushier and the starch started to clump. 
I don't consider myself a novice in the kitchen so I don't know what happened to this meal. After an honest attempt to eat it, we threw it out.

Took this recipe as a base and ran with it... my husband raved and wants it again!  I used some onion soup mix with the ground beef and substituted brown gravy mix in place of beef boulion. Very tasty!

This is amazing! I added some stewed tomatoes, we like tomatoes a lot so I would say 2 cans. With the juice from the tomatoes you don't have to add much water. I also added much more bullion and some garlic powder.

I gave this a 5 because it's good comfort food.  My mother always made "hash" but used leftover roast beef and gravy. I now make sure I make enough roast for leftovers.  I never thought of using ground beef.  Just as good!

This was surprisingly good!  I did add a can of corn and some Worcestershire.  I used beef broth instead of bouillon and water.  I didn't cover it, that would keep the moisture in.  Liquid evaporated with no problem.  Served with a little cheese and sour cream on top, with over easy eggs, and seasoned parsnip greens.  Good quick dinner.  Thanks!

Not gourmet by any means, but filling and tasty. Used chicken boullion cube b/c i didn't have beef. Splashed lots of hot sauce on after plating. yum

Looking for hamburger hash that was a little more dryer but found this.  Thought the recipe looked a little bland but with great potentual.  Added crushed garlic, 4 bouillon cubes instead of 2 T., extra potatoes and Worchershire sauce to base recipe.  Barely covered the potatoes with water but it still did not cook down as dry as I thought it should, so in last 5 minutes added a can of mushroom soup and a can of drained mushrooms.  We enjoyed it but felt that it was still missing a little kick to add additional flavor.

If you like that sort of thing then you will love the taste of this.

Surprisingly good.  I didn't expect it to be all that great but it was.  Very filling.  I used leftover beef from a Pot Roast and used the leftover gravy from the roast too.  Had leftover Tater Tots and I put them in, along with 3 potatoes and a pound of ground beef and a can of beef broth, Worchestshire Sauce too.  I know it's not too close to the recipe, but it is a pretty dynamic recipe and you can put lots of leftovers in it!  Good recipe.  Not gourmet, but good and EASY.

I made this as the recipe stated except I left it uncovered (didn't realize I was supposed to cover it but it came out perfectly), and I served it with some leftover cornbread. It's very simple & I didn't really expect much of a reaction but my boys all had seconds and said that dinner was great. I'm adding it to my dinner rotation, thank you for the super easy recipe.

It was pretty good.  I did add corn and some worcestershire sauce.  Maybe not enough because it was still a little bland.  I served it with shredded cheddar also.  I also stirred in browning sauce with cornstarch to make gravy because I still had a lot of liquid after the 30 minutes.  It is reminiscent of shepherds pie but easier.

It was OK, I would have given it a 2 star but my husband liked it and he would have given it 4 stars.  He's a meat and potato simple meal guy.  Me, I like pizazz!  He'll have to make it again if he wants it, I won't.  Sorry

I have made this recipe several times. It tastes good and is easy to make. It is GREAT to make on those days when you need to go shopping and there is nothing left in the house for the kids. The love it and if there is leftovers perfect for lunch the next day.

I also added some spices to this recipe. Then at the last minute, I tossed in a can of french style green beans.  Yummy!  And this made it truly a one-dish meal.

My family enjoyed this dinner.  It's great when there's nothing left in the pantry.  I added corn & mushrooms and used brown gravy mix, 1 buillon cube and some Montreal seasoning.  Will make again but not until I'm out of options.

This was a great recipe!  I was looking for something to make with the ingredients I had on hand (which wasn't much).  This totally fit the bill.  I didn't have potatoes in the house, so I used risotto which I cooked separately and then added to the hamburger.  Everyone in my family loved it.  This is definitely a keeper.

Easy to make and delicious.  Makes a whole lot.  I used chicken bouillon instead of beef, it came really good.  And after adding water I thought to myself, why not make it into a rice dish, and added some rice right after I put in the water.  Came out great.  A complete dish in one shot.

Very economical and pretty good. Our 10 year old loved. I used mushroom gravy instead of beef bouillon (had some left over). Added 1/2 can corn and some chopped green pepper.

I really liked this recipe, but I also made a few changes. I added brown gravy mix instead of bouillion and I added a little bit of A-1 sauce as well, for more flavor.  It turned out very well, and I was surprised to see my two picky children clean their plates. It was easy, yummy and filling. I will make it again.

I rarely rate a recipe a "1" but this was really bad.  It had no taste to it whatsoever.  It was like shoving mush in our mouths.  Fiance asked me to please never make this again, and that'snot something I hear him say often.  I added garlic powder, hoping to add to the flavor, and a little flour to thicken up the gravy a bit, and it was still really bad.  Sorry, not for us.

My husband loved this but I thought it was bland and boring.  Too soupy also.  This would probably be better made with leftover roast beef.  Also would be better if it wasn't so soupy and you could smother it with ketchup or bbq sauce or cheese or anything with flavor.

This is also good with polish sausage instead of ground beef, and a dash of celery salt.
