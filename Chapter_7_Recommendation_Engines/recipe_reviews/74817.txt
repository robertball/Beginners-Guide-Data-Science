Excellent recipe - I tried to cut down on the oil and dipped pototoes in oil instead, coated them and roasted in oven.  Turned out good also

I was specifically looking for a spicy recipe, and I came across this one and had to try it. I followed the recipe exactly, but also used a couple of tablespoons of GROUND FRESH CHILI PASTE (in a jar in the asian food section)to coat the potatoes before putting them in the corn flour mixture. Then I deep fried them in PEANUT OIL until browned. My only problem was I couldn't get them really crispy. They were brown but not crispy. Not sure what the problem was. Anyway, I still loved this recipe and can't wait to make it for the family too.

These had great flavor, but a fire on the stovetop forced me to bake them in the oven after I already had them ready to fry.  They were still okay, but I'll have to try them the right way sometime.

You have to QUICKLY go from water to batter to deep fryer or all the coating begins to fall off.

Trying to find recipes to use the 5lb bag of corn flour I got for my husband's tortilla recipe.  This is one I tried and they were delicious.  Took them to a party.  The kids there devoured them and one of them is VERY picky.  Even he liked them.  A little time consuming with the food prep and cook time but worth the effort.

Great flavor and easy recipe. I coated my potatoes in olive oil and then baked mine in the oven. I didn't have corn meal. These had a bit of heat though and it hits you afterward so be forewarned, they are spicy. Thanks.

We used regular flour and fried it in a pan rather than in a deep fryer, but this turned out only okay. It tasted mostly the same as other seasoned fries that had fewer steps and less oil.
