i was so excited when i found this recipe, only to be disappointed when i tried it. i'm sorry but the taste is a far cry from the real thing! the cream cheese is way dominated the taste, sour and salty. that's just not how it should be, sorry...

This tasted too much like cream cheese.  In order to get rid of the taste I added and extra tablespoon of butter and two tablespoons of sour cream.  It helped a bit.  Luckily in Germany, mascarpone is not expensive as in NA, so I think I will keep using the real thing.  Thanks, anyway!

Easy, delicious and money saving substitute.  No one even noticed or suspected that there was no real mascarpone cheese in the tiramisu.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I really like this recipe. I was able to find mascarpone in the store but it was something like $9 a tub so I decided to try this. I doubled the butter (which helped get rid of the tang from the cream cheese). I also added a little sugar and vanilla to add some sweetness and flavor. I pretty much just kept tasting it till it was what I was looking for. I used it for a cheesecake recipe and it was awesome. I've also since used it as a filling for stuffed french toast and it turned out delicious! I'll definitely make it again.

Thank Heaven! I have been looking for this recipe so I could make my tiramisu. I live in a small town where the marsacarpone cheese is impossible to find. Yeah!

Thank you sooooo much for sharing this with those of us who live in tiny towns that don't sell mascarpone! Not a single person knew I substituted this when they raved about my tiramisu (also from this site). I will never travel 70 miles to spend $9 a tub again!! Thanks again

This was VERY easy to use and tasted delicious.  Unfortunately I've never tasted mascarpone cheese since I've never been able to find it in my grocery store, so I can't compare the two.

Thanks for sharing this.  It was a HUGE help when making the Tiramisu layer cake.

Recently bought some mascarpone--ouch! $12/lb. When making this, be sure to use UNSALTED butter (to the person who said the recipe was salty). Salted butter can contain varying amounts of salt. This is a good substitute when I get a craving for Tiramisu without having to take out a home equity loan.

Sorry, but this taste like cream cheese which has too much "tang" to it compared to mascarpone. Not as lush & creamy either. I would only use this sub if there were no mascarpone in town. I love the real deal.

This worked well as a money-saving substitute for mascarpone in the tiramisu parfaits I made for my church's fundraiser a couple days ago.  The mixture still has a cream cheese flavor to it, but it's not overpowering.  As my father, who detests cream cheese, said "I could tell there was cream cheese in there, but not enough to make me not like it".

I made a fancy mac 'n' cheese a few weeks ago and it called for mascarpone. I vaguely understood what mascarpone was and was quite shocked to see how pricey this stuff is at the grocery store. So, luckily I found this substitute and it worked very well. Easy, inexpensive, creamy, perfect. I definitely recommend it!

I used this to substitute in for a tiramisu recipe and it didn't turn out too well. It tasted like just a lot of cream cheese. I think perhaps next time I will limit the amount of cream cheese and butter, while adding in some flavoring. Perhaps some vanilla.

The only thing I use mascarpone for is tiramisu.  My recipe calls for a pound, which is two $4.00 packages of 8 oz mascarpone.  This recipe reduces my cost to $2.00, as I can usually get cream cheese for a buck a package and always have butter and heavy whipping cream on hand.  NO ONE has ever noticed that I use a substitute instead of mascarpone.  I usually put this in my KitchenAid stand mixer and let it whip for 10 minutes for a nice smooth, creamy texture.

Tried this recipe for tiramisu and did not like it. I lived in Italy for the last year and just moved back was so excited to make some and it was no good. The grocery stores around me did not have mascarpone cheese but next time i will make the drive to find the real thing. Tasted really different.

Since I have never tasted the real mascarpone, I cannot make a very good comparison. The overall tiramisu tasted good but you can definitely taste the cream cheese in the recipe. Next time I will try to look harder in the supermarket and try the real thing.

I made this to use in "Classic Tiramisu."  It worked very well in that recipe.  I'd definitely use it again in recipes calling for mascarpone.

Used this in a tiramisu cupcake frosting.  I followed the recipe exactly. I used unsalted butter and store brand cream cheese. By itself, it does not taste like mascarpone. When thrown in with the other frosting ingredients, the lack of mascarponeness wasn't really noticeable. So if you're planning on using this in a recipe go ahead with the faux mascarpone. If you're trying to impress your guests with a fancy toast spread, you're going to have to shell out the $5+ for the real thing.

This has to be completely cold in order to taste right.  Once cold, it's very good and a great substitute.  But it has to be cold (or well, I imagine it's really that it has to set).

Yes, If you tasted this substitute alone, the difference can be noticed...  But in recipes such as Tiramisu, very hard to tell.  Great recipe.

Thank you for sharing this recipe. All the stores in my area were OUT of mascarpone (been waiting for a week for them to get more in). Drove me nuts as I was really wanting to try a tiramisu recipe I found! Anyway, I did not have cream cheese but I had neufchatel cheese so I used that and unsalted butter. The taste was great! If I had not found this recipe, I would have eaten the ladyfingers I purchased with some strong coffee. :)

In my area, I have a hard time finding marscapone sometimes, so this is a very worthy substitute.

I live in a small town and couldn't find mascarpone cheese at the local grocery store, so this was a great substitute!  It was delicious.  I think it had a "cheesecake" type taste to it though.  I love cheesecake, so it wasn't a problem for me.  Great recipe!

I made this recipe when I had only half the Mascarpone cheese for my Tiramisu. It tasted too much like cream cheese.
I added some sour cream and more butter and cream. It did not taste anything like mascarpone cheese. When they were mixed together it only just passed.
I would not use this recipe again.

I thought this worked out really well! I mean, it's not the same as actual mascarpone cheese, but in a pinch, it serves the purpose well. Another thing I liked about this recipe is that mascarpone is sooooo expensive and I ALWAYS have these ingredients on hand, so it totally works for me! I will definately be using this recipe again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Easy to make and worked as base for banana frosting. I beat in 1 cup powdered sugar, 1/2 mashed banana mashed with a little lemon juice, 1/2 stick butter, and a pinch of salt.

This is a good substitute! The recipe I wanted to use this is called for adding sugar and coffee liquor in the mascarpone cheese, so mine came out a little watery. I had to keep it in the fridge for a while, but I think this is still a more easily available substitute for the real thing.

If you only use this mix for Tiramisu, you will definitely be tasting the cream cheese.  Instead, I used half mascarpone and half of this mix, and my Tiramisu turned out good.

The cream cheese is overpowering. Marscapone is a little harder to make than this substitute but not very much harder since it's just cream and lemon juice. I'm going to stick with the real stuff.
