Great easy recipe for leftovers! 

I modified this slightly by adding spinach and then cooking it in the oven. It turned out GREAT!

Are you sure it should be 8 ounces of pasta?  Don't see how this was supposed to be "flipped" with all that spaghetti.  We ended up with a rather unappetizing display.  The flavor was ok.

Loved this!!!  I added more onions than called for and didn't have any bell peppers, but it didn't seem to make a difference.  My friend said it tasted like a ham and cheese omelet with pasta in the middle...YUMMY!  Kids loved it too!

I liked this. I used broccoli and mushrooms, since  I can't eat bell peppers or corn and reduced the pasta by 25%. I still found it was a bit too much pasta so I added a bit more egg. I am pretty inept with flipping so I cooked this in a cast iron skillet on the stovetop and the put in the oven for about 20 minutes. Came out great. Only thing I would do differently next time is more seasoning. I tasted the mixture and it was fine, but when you take a bite with the pasta after it is cooked, it seems a bit bland.. so next time I'll overseason the mixture so it'll balance out when I eat it

I made this into a serving for one by using 4 oz cooked pasta, 1/2 C leftover fajita peppers and onions, 2 oz fajita chicken, 2 eggs, a handful of baby spinach, and 1 oz Mexican cheese. I started on the stove top in a cast iron pan and finished in the oven under the broiler. It was a great way to combine the leftovers of two meals into a unique third.

Per others, added spinach and mushrooms.  Also added tomatoes. Now: don't know how you would successfully flip this, and I don't have an oven safe skillet so instead (if I did, would pour into skillet, cook for 5 min or so and the transfer to oven to finalize cooking but......I don't), I poured into a 9x13 dish. Baked at 350 for apprx 25-30 min until set. I still think it needs a bit more seasoning so I don't have to rely on s&p (thyme? Sage? Italian seasoning?) but great start and overall I am happy with results but to get an a+ I need to play around with just a bit....great recipe still!
