This is the best chili recipe I've made, our family's favorite. I usually put use 2 cans of beans though, one black bean and one kidney. Tastes great!

Love this chili!  This is now my new favorite veggie chili recipe.  My changes:  I use only 1 tsp. of the chili powder, and it is still very spicy! Also, I drained the canned veggies...gives it a chunkier texture that my family loves. The mushrooms are a great addition.

Great recipe--My husband, a total meat and bread type, is soooo surprised with this dish!  Served to kids with rice and cheese and sour cream.  I did add more chili powder and less cumin.  I also left out the red bell pepper (didn't want it too sweet) and celery (didn't have).  TIP--those who found it too soupy can add in several scoops of spicy refried beans (vegetarian) to help thicken it up--heat it for about 5 minutes after you add it and just before serving it to gauge how much you want.  Also, you can deglaze the pan with a few ounces of beer, wine, veg. or chicken stock before adding the tomatoes, etc.  Great and flexible recipe--even for the cooking impaired.  Thanks!

I still prefer chili with meat but this was a nice change of pace.  I took previous reviewers' suggestions and only put 1 tsp. of cumin, but doubled the amount of chili powder and it tasted perfect.  I sauted the onions, carrots and garlic first, then transfered everything to a slow cooker and cooked for about 7 hrs.  I used "baby" portabello mushrooms and lessened the amount of corn.  Use low-salt or no-salt ingredients where you can.  Thanks Tianne!

For color and variety I add a couple of cans of different beans - chickpea, garbanzo, red kidney, etc.  I usually skip the mushrooms for personal preference, but otherwise stick to this recipe.  I would never have imagined that I would prefer veggie chili over a traditional con carne, but I think this recipe has converted me!

This recipe was a bit on the bland side. Adding salt, cutting the cumin down to about 1 tsp., and adding an extra tbsp. of chili powder would make it A LOT tastier.

I love this chili and make it all fall/winter.  I usually up the garlic to 5 or 6 cloves, leave out the celery and mushrooms, and throw a can of chickpeas and black beans in there as well.  Delicious!

Wow.  I am amazed by how flavourful and hearty this chili is considering how easy it is to prepare.  This tops all the ground meat chili I've made in the past.  I added romano beans and used yellow pepper instead of red.  I also added a little paprika.  Definitely a keeper.  Outstanding.

Excellent vegetarian chili...I'm making a big batch of it for my Meat Out 2002 Event...I added Yves Veggie ground round and no one would ever guess it was purely vegetarian.  Well done! It's a keeper in our house.

We served Insanely Easy Vegetarian Chili to our guests last night that came over to help put up and decorate our Christmas tree.  The chili was a hit.  "Wow, how colorful," and "This has so much flavor," were just a couple of compliments our guests expressed about the chili.  Also, my husband thoroughly enjoyed preparing it, especially since it was his first time ever making chili even though he cooks professionally.  We kept the recipe as it, except for skipping the celery.  We provided our guests the following garnish choices:  blue corn tortilla chips, sliced whole wheat baguette, shredded cheese, sour cream, and hot sauce.  Our night was a tradition in the making!  Thank you!

We do not normally eat vegetarian but relatives that do were coming for dinner. Everyone loved it. What I did differently: Left out bell pepper. Used 1 can chili beans and 1 can white beans. Sauteed carrots, onions, celery and garlic together. Sauteed mushrooms until browned. Added a can of green beans and used very little cumin because I don't like it. Used ground chipotle chili pepper so the heat was rather high. Put everything in the crock pot on high for 4 hours. Served with cornbread, grated cheese, sour cream and chopped cilantro. Surprising how good this is. Try it.

This was so easy, full of flavor, and easily modified.  I left out the corn, added organic chili beans, used 15 oz can of fire roasted romatoes, and used mostly chipotle chili powder (in addition to some regular chili powder).  My version had a nice smoky flavor that was fantastic, especially with all of the veggies.  There isn't much left over, but my guess is this will be even better tomorrow.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!  What more can I say?  I don't like ground beef, so finding a veggie chili recipe was a real treat.  This recipe is just full of flavour.  It has become one of my regular dishes.  One thing I do suggest is to double the chili power and cumin.  The first time I made this my boyfriend added twice as much by accident.  The second time I made it, I added the correct amount and it just didn't taste right...a little on the bland side.  So from now on I double the cumin and chili powder and it never fails to please.  I strongly recommend anyone to give this recipe a try...and to serve it with garlic bread :)

Very good.  We made a few changes.... added fresh fennel along with the celery, used fresh hurbs instead of dry, about 1/2 bottle of white wine and the mushrooms were added during the last 8 or so minutes to prevent overcooking.  Served on top on quinoa.  YUM

I have made this recipe several times. It is a family favorite! I always leave out the mushrooms, and if I have any vegetables on the verge of going bad, I always dump them in. I use the suggestions below for spices rather than using what the recipe calls for. Also, after making the chili, I always add 2 cups of water and let it simmer for about an hour.   I also add a can of black beans.

The only grievance I have about the recipe is the title "insanely easy". We need to be careful about the use of such terms. The recipe is very time consuming - at least 8 different things to chop and prepare, etc. Easy means fast and minimum labour. I was looking for something that took less work. GB

This was okay. I think it would be a lot better if the cumin was halved or left out because it overpowered the dish. Does have potential though!

While I wouldn't call this "insanely easy" because there is a lot of vegetable chopping involved, it is absolutely delicious.  While I thought this would taste like "vegetable soup with beans", the veggies all take on a "chili-esque" flavor.  Everyone loved it.  I did add a second can of kidney beans and barely squeeked out six servings.  (Perhaps it serves eight if each bowl only contains one cup of chili.......)

I gave three stars because the cumin was too much for me, but the base recipe is something I know I will come back to and tweek myself. My husband really liked it, but he likes things more spicy than I do. I didn't have chili powder, so I used red pepper flakes and I like the taste of those! I love the veggies in this!

I served this to self-proclaimed "carnivores," and they really enjoyed it.  You won't miss the meat.  This is a flavorful chili that is more lean than most. I added another can of black beans.  Everything in this recipe is a guideline- add ingredients to your taste.

The chili turned out pretty good.  I'm not a vegetarian and was making this for someone else so I do prefer meat in my chili.  For those of you who like a thicker chili, I used crushed tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes and it turned out nice and thick.

This was really good, though not as fast as expected with all of that chopping!  :)

I used frozen corn instead of canned, double chili powder in place of cumin, and added rinsed and drained cans of black beans, and romano beans.  (Wanted it more thick and "bean-y"!)

This recipe is also a bit "soup-y"...  Not terribly thick without the addition of more beans.

So, yes, I changed it a bit, but still - love this recipe!

I really liked this chili for the fact that it didn't need any meat substitute for depth of flavor. (I had brought some in anticipation of chili but glad to find it wasnt needed). Plenty was provided by the other ingredients, particularly the mushrooms (I don't normally use them in chili). I used baby portabello. I used canned tomato sauce instead of whole tomatoes (425g size) and I left out the green pepper because I don't like them.  I also used half pinto beans/ half kidney.  APart from that, nothing was changed. Will definitely make again.

I wish the rating system had "half" stars - I wanted to give this 4.5 stars but not quite a five.  I am not a cook by any means, this was my first attempt at making any type of chili without using Chili Magic and it was very easy. Insanely easy!  : ) It gets a five star rating in that regard.   The only thing I didn't like about it was the cumin.  I never cooked with it before and next time I make this I will omit it.  I thought it had an odd taste, that is the only reason I give this 4.5 stars.  Ate this with baked Tostito's tortilla chips and it made for a great meal - would be good with cheddar cheese and/or sour cream.

Yes it's very easy, and so delicious. I'm not a big fan of chili, but I loved it. I also added some okra and black bean. It's so good.

Great recipe.  Healthy, easy and even my husband (who would usually prefer meat in his chili) ate the leftovers and told me a couple of times how much he liked it.  Easy to modify based on what you have on hand.

Mmmm... This was my first time making chilli and I was very pleased with the results : ) I didn't have any mushrooms but I think it would have been even better with them so I can't wait to try it with the next time. I added chickpeas, doubled the chilli powder and I cooked it for 20 mins and then took the lid off while it cooked for another 5 mins and it thickened to the perfect consistency. I had it with rice and sprinkled white cheddar over it which really made it.. Thanks for sharing, great recipe!

Fantastic recipe!  Easy and very healthy!  I didn't have a red bell pepper, still came out good.  Seems like you could add or omit many different veggies.  Even my husband, who loves his meat chili, thought it was delicious!!  This one is a keeper!

I've done this recipe many times, but with some changes.  I don't put mushrooms simply because I don't like them that much, did not put the liquid of the corn and kidney beans and put crused tomatoes instead of whole peeled tomatoes with liquid and it maked a thicker consistancy which I really like.

This is one of my favorite recipes on the site! So easy to do and all of the ingredients are really basic and inexpensive. My notes: I add a can of black beans and to keep it from getting too soupy, I drain all of the canned goods thoroughly except for the tomatoes. Great served with a crusty french loaf!

I made this for a vegetarian family in need of meals due to one parent being in the hospital and the other parent just abou living there and the three boys are vegetarian.  I wanted a main dish, and man oh man, this was an awesome bill of fare! I will sure make it again for my own family.  This was a great tasting non-meat chili!  I didn't change a thing except to add a package of McCormicks Chili Seasoning....and bumped up the cumin a bit!  Yum-O!

Agreed, Insanely easy! Delicious, full of veggies and very low-cal considering how much it makes.

We served it with brown rice, but i reckon it would make a very good topping for baked potatoes.

Great tasting chili and very easy.  Needs to cook much longer than indicated in the recipe.  Definately reduce the amount of cumin too.

My son loves this recipe. Made some changes twice. Subsituted 3/4 of zucchini for bell peppers, used Mexican Style Stewed tomatoes. Second time around I used Tomatoes w/Jalapeno, and S&W Chili Beans, both times it was absolutely delicious.

Yum!  I used to work in Washington, DC, and would get veggie chili at a little carryout - been looking for a recipe that's similar, and this is a winner!  So easy, too!  Like most of you, I made some changes to suit our tastes:  I like veggie cihli a little soupy, so I added a couple cups of water.  I omitted the mushrooms and added one small can of tomato paste; used 1/2 tbsp of garlic powder instead of the cloves; added about 1/2 tsp extra basil, oregano, and cumin to make up for the extra water; added extra celery, too.  My canned corn and kidney beans were lower sodium.  Very flavorful, even without salt added!  I can't wait for lunch tomorrow!  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband LOVES this chili and asks me to make it often. You will not miss the meat in this one! I also add 2 or 3 cans of beans (garbanzo, black eyed peas, black beans and great northern). Tastes wonderful and leaves leftovers for days!

This was insanely easy and can be modified with whatever you have on hand.  I used a can each of pinto and black beans and tomato sauce vs what the recipe called for and threw in spinach too since I had some and topped it with sour cream, it was great!  We did not miss the meat at all!

I would totally drain the canned items with the exception of the tomatoes. Otherwise it would be really soupy. I added a can of black beans for extra protein. Overall it was decent, but it did not reheat very well.

This chili was very good.  I stuck to the main parts of the recipe but added a few extra things.  I added garbanzo beans(without the juice), black beans(with the juice), pasilla peppers, and yellow squash.  Everything was cooked perfect.  My vegetarian boyfriend loved it too and commented on how yummy it was with all the veggies!  I have lots leftovers (I only cook for 2) so next time I might cut the recipe in half. I also added cheese, sour cream and fresh avocado on top.

really really good! I'm a student, so it was a cheap and easy meal to make and it was YUMMY! I made a few changes (this recipe is pretty flexible I'd say for making substiutions). I added squash and zucchini to the vegetables and used chickpeas and kidney beans. I've pretty much eaten it every day for 5 days....mmmm.

fantastic recipie.  have made many times, and everytime i want some to freeze, there is none left...  Basically i follow the recipie word for word, but i use all low sodium products, lowering the sodium %.  I also omit the olive oil and just throw everything in a crockpot overnight.  actually makes a great breakfast on a cold morning, lunch and dinner - yeah - i typically live off of it until its gone.  its just that good. 5 stars from me.

Our family enjoyed this recipe, although we did make a few changes.  We substituted diced zucchini for mushrooms, added more chili powder and some sea salt, and used vegetable broth instead of the liquid from the cans of beans (to avoid all the sodium of the canned liquid).  We loved the chunky (healthy!) veggies.  The flavor was a bit on the bland side for our tastes, but overall this was a good base recipe to use to alter to your tastes.

Excellent recipe! I replaced the celery with a yellow bell pepper, and replaced the corn with a can of white beans (just personal preferences, not a huge fan of corn or cooked celery) I also halved the cumin and chili powder, glad I did so that the spice/heat didn't overwhelm the dish. The recipe doesn't call for salt,and I found it unneccessary to add any. That's saying a lot because I do have a salt tooth! Turned out very 'juicy' but nowhere as soupy as in the picture. Great, because I like chili less liquidy anyway. Best eaten at least 6 hours after cooking to let flavours meld, and it's even better the next day. Will definitely make this again.

This is so easy to throw together, and versatile. I threw in some black beans, and more garlic, used crushed tomatoes, and fire roasted tomatoes...fantastic.  Do adjust the seasoning: 1/2 the cumin, double the chili powder.  I'd leave the carrots out next time too, just don't seem to meld with chili IMO.

Wonderful. I put everything in a crock pot and cooked on low for 6 hours.  I added one chopped zucchini and toward the end I added the corn.  I used light red kidney beans.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was even easier than the recipe said. 

I used a food processor to do the chopping, which cut my prep time down to just about 10 minutes, and I used crushed tomatos instead of whole, which cut the simmering time down. The flavors matured with more simmering, but it was ready to eat pretty much as soon as it was warm enough - I think start to finish I had dinner table-ready in 30 minutes.

We had it over rice and with some nice crusty bread. Yum!

This recipe tastes more like tortilla soup than chili.  It is very good served with some cheddar cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips on top.

Very good and is even better as leftovers.  I served it with corn bread.  MMmmmm... I also wouldn't call it insanely easy as it was quite a bit of chopping involved.

This chili has a very pronounced cumin flavor that we enjoyed. I did use 3 T chili, drained and rinsed the kidney beans and did the same with a can of black beans.

woweee...we loved this!  great seasoning blend (to which i added fresh basil, instead of dried)and great veggie combo!  i omitted the mushrooms (bleeah!) and doubled the beans and corn.  you can also add 1/2 lb. elbow macaroni and 2 extra cups water when you simmer the chili for 20 min. to make chili mac...also very tasty!  thanks for a GREAT recipe!  :)

Good, but not something I would crave enough to rate a 4 or 5.  This is one of those recipes I would make again if I had most of the ingredients in the house and needed to use them up.  I thought it tasted best with sharp shredded cheddar cheese sprinkled on top, and Golden Sweet Cornbread, another recipe from this site, made a good accompaniment.  As far as being insanely easy, this involves a lot of chopping of vegetables, so there's more time and effort than the name implies.

This is a tasty vegetable chili. In response to an earlier post: it would be insane NOT not to rinse off the beans before adding them (to prevent, um, gas). I rinsed them and had no problems. In place of the missing liquid, I added some Campbell's tomato soup. I've made this chili four times. It's also easy to add some meat - about 1 lb. of ground beef will work well, if you don't mind eating animals.

My family loved this chili, including my father who is a meat and potatoes guy.

The first time I made it I had a variety of veggies and mushrooms and it was great.  The second time I made it I only used button mushrooms and fewer veggies and it didn't taste as good.

Also, there are lots of veggies to clean and chop.  I wouldn't call it easy.

Great starting point for a veg chili.  I doubled the chili powder but would add even more next time (as well as add more cumin, garlic) as my family found it to be mild. Perfect with cornbread....a definite keeper :)

I love this recipe and try to make it once a month, especially when our garden is in full bloom. As other reviewers have stated, it's great because you can throw in whatever veggies are in the fridge and need to be used in. I switched out oregano for marjoram and eliminated the basil. And after making it the first time, I now deglaze it with beer after sauteing all the veggies and before adding the tomatoes...it just adds another layer of flavor. Thank you Tia for posting this recipe!

A little soupier than what I like in a chili, but it has good flavor. The only changes I made were leaving out the celery, cause I don't like it, and adding red pepper flakes and extra garlic and chili powder.  Very healthy with all the veggies.

This is a great chili.  I left out the carrots and mushrooms and added a can of black beans in thier place.  Also I used tomatoe puree instead of peeled tomatoes since I don't like their texture.  Last but not least i put in a little vegetarian sausage to thicken it up a bit.  This keeps well and is a quick delicious lunch throughout the week.

I'm glad I didn't rate this last night when I put this together because my initial reaction was disappointing.  Having let it sit in the fridge overnight, I reheated some for dinner tonight and it improved tremendously! I added black beans and chickpeas, kicked up the spices a bit more and did end up adding mushrooms, too.  Flavors need to mellow overnight.

I made this for a group of heart patients.  Most people were hesitant to try this because the title has vegetarian in it.  I think they thought it was fullof tofu or something.  I started calling it vegetable bean soup after a while and all of a sudden they loved it!  I made it in a slow cooker just so I could keep it warm for a long period of time.  I left out the mushrooms just because I don't care for them.  It was very good and healthy too!

I have tried many, many vegetarian chili recipes over the years, and this is not only the easiset, but also the best. It is not hot at all as written, so if you like spicy hot, you'll want to add more heat. My husband doesn't like hot food so I make it as is and then just add hot sauce to my serving. I have varied the recipe, usually I don't add the corn, but do 2 15 oz cans of beans (pintos and kidneys) instead. But it is excellent as written.

This was very, very good. My husband and I both loved it. Very easy and I love how you can mix it up with whatever you have on hand. I added some white kidney beans as well as the red and left the red pepper out because I didn't have one and it was wonderful. Thanks for a great recipe!

The mushrooms definitely make this recipe. If you're looking for a "meatier" texture, the mushrooms give you that texture and some really nice flavor, also. I used portabello. As other people noted, the chili is pretty thin, and I even omitted a lot of the juice from the canned veggies. The thinness didn't bother me too much, although it doesn't end up as a very traditional chili. This was my first attempt at making chili, and I thought it was a great starter recipe that satisfies both vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. Also, as promised, it WAS insanely easy.

This is a fantastically delicious chili. I used less cumin and chili powder as we are not fans of overly hot chili and it was just flavorful. I used mixed beans instead of just kidney beans, and didn't add celery. I've also varied the type of peppers and used yellow, green, orange or red. We served this at an open house along with a pot of beef chili and both were a hit.

Very good recipe. I didn't have red bell peppers, so i subbed a cup of cubed zucchini. Also cut cumin in half and added crushed red pepper flakes( 2 TBS.), and 3oz. chopped jalapenos for some kick. Will make again. Very easy.

I like how it is so easy to make and you can use whatever vegetables are available. I let chopped fresh tomatoes simmer long enough to provide liquid for the chili. This way, I didn't end up with a "soup" as some reviewers have observed, rather than a chunky, thick chili.

This was good...you'll never miss the meat.  Even my brother-in-law, who refuses to eat veggies, liked this.  I made it exactly as written with one exception: I couldn't find a 19 oz can of kidney beans so I used 2 14.5 oz cans.  A very hearty chili.

I can't believe I've never rated this recipe. It's one of the first recipes I ever tried from this site and I still continue to make it. About the only change I make is to add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste with diced tomatos. It is so good and you can use almost any veges in this chili. Enjoy.

I didn't like this chili.  I followed the directions as far as the spices go - the only changes I made was to drain and rinse the beans and add a can of black beans and some squash cut up.  
After it had cooked the last 20 minutes, I put it in the slow cooker and continued to cook it for a couple of hours.  At that point I tasted it.  It was kind of bland and mealy-feeling.  I doubled the chili powder, added some salt and pepper, a tsp of vinegar and let it cook for another hour.  Still not so good.  So I browned some hamburger, drained the fat and added some taco seasoning.  Then I added this to the slow cooker and cooked it an additional 2-3 hours.  At this point it tasted pretty good, but I would not make it again.  I have had vegetarian chili in a restaurant that was really good, so I will continue my search so that I don't have to add meat to make it good.  Sorry.

Very tasty and so easy to make substitutions with! I prefer this to regular chili. My husband likes it too, though he still prefers the meatier version. (I always go a lot heavier on the veggies than the recipe calls for, so I've never had any trouble with it being too thin or soupy.)

This was a big hit with my vegetarian friends and my meat-eating family. Prep time for all the veggies took a while, but was worth it. I cooked this in the slow cooker and added 3 kinds of beans - black, pinto,and kidney. Plus, I also put in a can of chopped green chilis. I served it Cincinnati style - over spaghetti noodles and garnished with chopped onions, cheese, sour cream and avocado. Even my 12 year old grandson (who would die if he knew he was eating mushrooms) kept asking for more. This is a great recipe and a good way to get your veggies.

This recipe is fantastic!  There is so much flavour in this dish.  (Just add more chili powder if you need more zip).  I make it at least once every 2 weeks.  My 2 year old loves it!

This recipe was great!  I have dinner with neighbors on Fridays, and I pulled this one off the web in a pinch.  I had most of the ingredients in my cabinets already.  It satisfied my two vegetarian friends as well as my meat-eating friend.

We used garbanzo beans in it and they were great.  We also used 2 cans of tomatoes since one did not seem to be enough.  We had plenty for 5 adults and leftovers for one.  If I were to make it again (a definite), I would add some cayenne to kick up the spice and some salt.

I baked organic milk-free cornbread muffins and served them with the chili.  It was divine!

Very good and highly recommended.

This was a great meal and very filling. I did not add the kidney beans and also added a 1/4 cup of heavy cream when I simmered for 20 min. It made it creamy and smooth.

We all ate it, but it wasn't special.  I'll look for a different recipe next time.  I'm curious why the recipe says to chop a can of whole tomatoes instead of just using diced.

This was very good! I am defiantely making this again. My husband who is a meat and potatoes guy, did enjoy this. Just a few changes: I added deep-browned beans in tomato sauce and I drained everything except the canned tomatoes (italian) to make it thicker. Also used fresh herbs as I am growing my own herbs and I am not a fan of green peppers, so I used yellow and red. I used peaches and cream whole corn and it added a sweetness that was incredible.

I loved this recipe!  I omitted the mushrooms, drained and rinsed the beans, and used frozen corn for a much thicker chili (the picture looked like soup to me), and it turned out perfect.  Also we added a dash of red pepper and some salt.  Add a quick salad to a cup of this chili, and you have a great meal!

This was just okay.  If I made again, I would drain the corn.  The liquid made it taste sweet, which I did not care for.

This was SOOOO Good!!  I made it for my boyfriend who is a hunter &  major carnivore.  He loved it. I cooked it exactly as the recipe called for, except I used a tiny bit less of the chili powder (for fear of making it too spicy).  I also added 1 chopped zucchini.  Served it with fresh cornbread. Delish!

Season and add/omit veggies according to your own taste, but this truly is a fantastic chili recipe. My go-to. Always! Try adding veggie burger crumbles and its even heartier. Delicious, but even better the second day!

This turned out wonderful served with a spoonful of sour cream and crumbled tortilla chips on top. I do recommend using 2 tablespoons of chili powder and 1 teaspoon of cumin as several other reviewers suggested.

It's a great recipe to use as a base. I must admit I've made this many times but have never followed it exactly as I make modifications based on what's available in the house....but that's what makes this recipe great and flexible.

I didnt have kidney beans so I used I can Chili beans, one can of chick peas, one can of pinto beans, a can of black beans and peas n carrots.  I also cooked it for an hour and added corn starch at the end of it to thinken it up a bit.  Perfect!

Insanely good!  I did add a can of black beans.  I drained and rinsed all my canned veggies to reduce sodium and then added a little chicken broth to make up for the drained liquid.  I know - not vegetarian but I didn't have any vegetable broth.  Very good recipe

This one was a hit with the whole family.  I served it with rice and topped with cheddar cheese, and everyone cleaned their plates...I will only say that it was a little sweet for my tastes, which is why I gave it only four stars.
My changes:  
>I didn't add carrots because I didn't think they would soften enough.  
>I used a can of creamed corn instead of regular corn because that's what I had on hand. 
>I added lentils because I had them around and they are a good source of protein
>I used italian seasoning instead of oregano and added chili and some sea salt

I love it!  I've been looking for a good vegan chili recipe and this one lacks nothing.  You don't even miss the meat you find in normal chili.  Thanks for sharing it!

Bland.  Even after doubling the chili powder (I use fairly spicy one to start with) and cumin it still didn't have much taste.  I would say the flavors didn't seem to work together, but there just wasn't any flavor.  Still, it's easy and healthy so it wasn't a total loss.

Delicious as a base.I decided to make it in the slow cooker on high for two hours with a few changes: drained the corn, added a can of undrained chilli beans and used a  bouquet garni of fresh thyme, rosemary, sage, oregano, bay. Added freshly chopped parsley and basil just before serving. Made it last month and someone was asking for the recipe today! Must be good :-)

This recipe is excellent.  It's become a staple at my house.  I'm embarrassed to say that I add meat to the recipe.  I attempted to make it without the meat, but I was out voted.  I brown the meat first, set it aside, then add it back in when I add the tomatos.  I've made it with ground beef and ground turkey either way it turns out great.  I also use about 5 tablespoons of chili powder, black beans instead of the kidney beans and I haven't used the cumin.  I was out the first day I made it and since it was such a hit without it I haven't bothered adding it.  Thanks for this recipe.

Love this recipe!  It can also be a delicious, quick, hearty, meatless vegetable soup!  As usual, I adapted it to my taste.  Left out the red bell pepper(had none), subbed olive oil for vegetable, subbed whole jarred button mushrooms (cut in half) for fresh, used diced tomatoes instead of whole, reduced cumin to 1/2 Tab. and added 1 tsp. sugar. No need for added tomato sauce/paste as some reviewers suggested.  When I make this again (and I will), I will reduce the chilil powder by half (personal preference).  This makes a hearty, healthy, low-cal. lunch which is what I was looking for.  I found that the recipe will make a lot more than 8 average servings!  Wonderful with a corn muffin/stick. Thanks, Tianne!

This was AWESOME!!!!!! We loved it, even my meat-loving husband. I used part salsa for the tomatoes, as I didn't have enough, and I think that that was an improvement. We served this with sour cream and green onions and really enjoyed it. This will be a keeper.

This was the first vegetarian chili I've made, and it was better than expected. I served it over baked potatoes with shredded cheese, and my husband (a meat lover) really liked it. I won't rush to make it again, but when I'm looking to stretch grocery money with meatless entrees, this recipe will come in handy. Thanks!

This recipe is excellent--it's so versatile and it's a staple in our home.  I like to add beef or vegetable broth instead of water, and drain the corn before I put it in.  So healthy!

This was good but I could not rate it 4 or 5 stars because it was not chili it was vegatable soup. It doesn't taste bad but its definitely not chili. I threw everything in the food processor to save time.

This was delicious!  We enjoyed it the first day and then again as leftovers.  I added a can of black beans to the recipe and served it with shredded cheese (Four Cheese Mexican Blend) and sour cream.  We added a salad and breadsticks and had a delicious and hearty meal.

Delicious!  Alter this recipe to suit your own tastes.  I didn't add onions, celery, or mushrooms, but it was still very flavorful. I did add an extra tablespoon of chili powder.  Top with cheddar cheese and green onions.  Serve with cornbread!

Not much more than warm salsa. When I served this dish along with a few other chili options, those guests who did not eat beef or pork went for chicken chili instead. The vegetarians ended up with salad and bread. This recipe is easy, but not too impressive. Save yourself time and heat up some salsa, add some mushrooms, and hope you don't have too much left over.

one word- YUMMMMM.... :-) I didn't know that vegetarian chilli actually existed until I stumbled across this. And the creator is right- it IS insanely easy. I also added a bit of lemon juice and paprika. 2 thumbs up!! Cheers.

Great!  I added more kidney beans and then more chili powder to a third of the recipe.  I personally liked the sweeter, original version.  I also used two smaller cans of chopped (diced) tomatoes.  One had chilis in it which also changed the taste but I won't know how much until I try the recipe again the way it was written!  This could also be a great soup as part of a larger meal!

I didn't have mushrooms or oregano. I replaced them with a can of black beans and also used a yellow pepper instead of green. I added about a teaspoon and a half of kosher salt. Tasted amazing. I used frozen corn because I didn't have canned.

I really liked this recipe [almost] exactly as is. Used no salt corn, beans & tomatoes ... Found that the chili powder was just the right amount of saltiness for the batch.

A local wellness center supplied this recipe to a group of people committed to a ten day regimen of enjoying only healthy, unprocessed foods.   This chili was indeed insanely easy, colorful, and very good.    I used Trader Joe’s super sweet organic frozen corn in place of canned and added a chipotle pepper for a smokier flavor.  Mushrooms add a meaty texture and diced avocados are an attractive and tasty topping.

Its best to saute the herbs and chili powder for about a minute to help release the natural oils and enhance the flavor of the chili.

Well, I wouldn't say it was "insanely easy" to make, BUT it was INSANELY DELICIOUS! I browned up a package some MorningStar Recipe Crumbles and added it. I took this to work and heated in a crockpot for World Vegetarian Day (October 1, 2012) and all the meat eaters went crazy for it. I never thought of adding mushrooms to chili, but it really added a nice layer of flavor.

This chili was SOOO good!  Exactly what I was looking for!  Serve on top of white rice.  Search Golden Sweet Cornbread on all recipes and serve cornbread on the side too.  SO SO Good!

This recipe really is insanely easy, and even my meat-loving fiance swooned over it. I made a few small modifications: I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil because it's what I had on hand, and "chili-ready" chopped tomatoes rather than the canned whole variety. I like spicy chili but since I used the chili-ready tomatoes, I didn't have to change the seasonings much; I added an extra half tablespoon of chili powder and halved the cumin to 1/2 tablespoon, and added a teaspoon of sea salt to enhance the flavors (which might not have been necessary if I had not used the low-sodium beans and corn). I also added a drained can of white beans. The finished product came out very thick and chunky, probably due to my high elevation, but that's how I prefer my chili anyway. Overall, this so good that we ate virtually nothing but chili for two days. Highly recommended!

I am a new vegetarian. This was one of the recipes I decided to try to eat throughout the week. I doubled the recipe and froze most of it.  I used less cumin like everyone suggested. I also used more tomatoes, I like a soupier chili. I added salt, pepper and a little more chili powder.  Simply put, this is FANTASTIC.

This chili is insanely easy and delicious! I used frozen corn instead of canned, and only had anaheim peppers so I substituted those for the bell peppers. Also, I used portobello mushrooms. Very tasty, excellent vegetarian dish.

WE love this veggie chili! We add a can of black beans and omit the mushrooms as well as cut back on the cumin. This is a great recipe to experiment with.

This recipe was just okay for me as is, so I added a few things to make it more flavorful.  I added 1 tsp. brown sugar, 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper.  If you like your chili spicy, then def. add in the pepper.

Yum! Very good! I left out the celery (as it's not liked much in our house!) and also used crushed tomatoes instead of whole! I had to add water as it was sooooo thick! I added a chopped jalapeno pepper for added kick!! Thanks for the recipe!! Delicious!

YUMM! After deciding to give up red meat, I decided to try this alternative to my dad's ground beef chili. It was sooooo good. I followed the recipe and added a chopped half of a jalepeno.  I also skipped the mushrooms. My whole family loved this chili and it was not only insanely easy but insanely good.

I added an extra can of kidney beans, some black beans, and cut back the cumin. Also added more chili powder (I like about 20 tsps), some more garlic, and a couple bay leaves. Great recipe, will be making this a lot in the future.

Yummy... fed 10+ people and they all loved it.  I doubled the recipe and used shitake mushrooms and a combination of kidney and black beans.  I might add a fresh tomato next time, but otherwise - this WAS super easy and so delicious.

Very good.  I appreciate recipes with many different kinds of vegetables.  It could have used something extra from the spice rack to kick it up, though.  If I make it again I will add more chili powder, perhaps some cayenne or hot chiles as well.

My mum and I liked this veggie chili very much. The only change I made was adding more oregano/cumin, otherwise it would've tasted a little bland. The consistency was just right, not like a soup at all, and -as promised- it was pretty easy too. A keeper!

This was very tasty, although I am in agreement with a few other reviewers that this is not chili, it is vegetable soup.  Regardless, it's still very good.  I had to add about double the amount of spices (I like spices), and used peas instead of the peppers (didn't have any).  Other than that I kept it the same and it was quite delectable.  I may make it again.

i absolutely loved loved loved this recipe! we had a summer squash hanging around in our veggie drawer and CHOP CHOP CHOP in it went, along with a can of black beans in place of the mushrooms (we were out). i think some of our cans were more ounces that the recipe called for, perhaps the corn and/or kidney beans, and i may have added in extra celery, but it was SO GOOD. thank you for a delicious recipe!

This was so tasty.  I added more heat than the recipe called for because of personal taste (and it's the only way to get my husband to eat anything), but I thought the flavors blended well.  It seemed to be even better when I had it the next day for lunch.  It is now one of my staples to make big batches so I get cheap lunches that are actually good.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a simple and great recipe!  It was easy to modify based on personal preferences --- I added frozen ground Boca burger and eliminated the mushrooms.  I also increased the spice level to suit the tastebuds of my guests.  Delicious!

While it was good, the chili had more of a soup consistency than a chili consistency.  Good, but not for a whole meal.

This was incredibly easy (as stated in the title). The only change I would make is to add far less chili powder out of personal preference.  I topped with sour cream and cheddar cheese. Great for the cold weather!

My boyfriend and I LOVE this chili! It has become a staple in our home and we make it about twice a month. Only changes we made were we omit the celery, I'm not a big fan of it, replaced the kidney beans with black beans and added a bag of Morningstar Farms crumbles. Top it off with cheddar cheese, salsa and sour cream. This recipe is a must have for any vegetarian. Yummy!!!

This is my new chili recipe!  I made this for my daughter's birthday party and it was a huge hit!  I followed other suggestions of adding tomato paste, fresh cilantro, and a can of black beans.  I made this the night before the party, b/c I think chili is always better on the 2nd day!

if there were more stars, i'd give them to this recipe.  i halved it and didn't use the celery (didn't have any), used a green bell pepper and black beans instead of red and pinto, and put in a can of tomato sauce instead of the canned tomatoes.  and added some cilantro.  this was super easy and so, so, so good!!!  (serve it with the "homesteader cornbread" recipe from this site, which is also amazing)

I halved the recipe, so it may not have come out exactly the same, but to me it is closer to a vegetable stew.  But delicious, especially considering how easy it is to make!  I might try adding tomato paste or some fake meat crumbles to make it more of a true chili.

This recipe was excellent and will definitely become part of my regularly used recipes.  I did make couple very minor changes.  I replaced the can of kidney beans with one can (I think approximately 30oz)of Brooks Chili hot beans.  I also doubled the amount of chili powder to 2 tbsp.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and I couldn't stay out of it.  I wish that it were a little bit thicker, but I will play with that.  Thanks for this recipe!!!

Quite good.  Very easy, though involves a lot of chopping!  I followed the recipe exactly and was quite happy: just the right about of spice.  (I wouldn't change the spices, despite suggestions of some other reviews to the contrary.)  Reheats well.  I'd make it again.
(Note on ingredients: 1 medium onion, 1 large carrot, 1 green pepper, 1 red pepper (of similar size to the green) and 5 mushrooms are about the right amount (or a little extra) so when you chop them you get the suggested quantities in the recipe.)

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I just used it as a guide and threw in veggies I had in the fridge, some TVP for texture, etc. It's excellent! You could probably use whatever is around your kitchen, and it will be good.

I cheated, I am a meat lover so I added 1 1/2 lb browned ground beef and a serloin steak chopped and browned. I have never heard my husband rave so much about any dish I have ever prepared. I put all in a slow cooker for 10 hrs let it rest overnight then cook again on high for 4 hrs. 10 stars

This was very good and so full of color! I didn't use the mushrroms and I was out of oregeno and basil, so I just used 3 tsp of an italian herb mix that I had.  the only thing that I would change, is that I would use a couple of cans of diced tomatoes, in place of the whole peeled canned tomatoes (I'm not a fan of whole tomatoes in my soup).  I followed the recipe exactly until I got to step 2, then I just combined the sauteed veggies and the rest of the ingredients into my slow cooker, placed it on high until it started boiling, and then to low until I was ready to serve it later that evening.  Worked out perfect!

Very good, I followed the recipe exactly (like I always do the first time I make something, then change it the next time if needed) I am a vegetarian so I really appreciated this dish. It was a mouthful of yum! After the first bowl I had to have a second, but this time I added a dollop of sour cream and sprinkled a little Mexican style fine shred cheese on it- OH MY!!!YUM YUM YUM!!! I will always add sourcream from this bowl on!

This is a very tasty recipe. Many reviewers chose not to add the mushrooms. I must say I hesitated, but in the end I decided to add them in. They are a wonderful addition to this recipe. Don't skip them,unless you really don't like mushrooms. The only real changes I made were to use less chili powder. Since I chose to drain the kidney beans and corn, I added one cup of water. I also used petite diced tomatoes to skip the chopping step. I did cook this for about 2 hours, not the 20 minutes suggested. Next time I will skip the green and red peppers and increase some of the other veggies to replace them. ALthough I am a fan of peppers, somehow I felt I would like this recipe better without the peppers. That is what is so nice about this recipe. You can easily adjust it to your preferences. Thumbs up on this one!!!!

This is so good!  I followed some of the review suggestions and didn't add mushrooms and instead of adding garlic just used 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/ roasted garlic already in them.  I didn't have cumin and it was still excellent.  I also rinsed the beans and added one can of kidney and one can of black.  I loved it and will make it often.

I am a hopeless chili maker, but this one actually tasted really good! I pretty much followed the recipe as is, omitting the celery. Everyone liked it, I will definitely make it again. Excellent served with some cornbread.

One of my all time favorite recipes!!  This chili is a hit with my boyfriend and all of his co-workers.  I leave out the mushrooms since my boyfriend hates mushrooms.  I've also tried adding soy meat (kind of a ground beef substitute), and it was delish.  If you want to try this, brown the soy meat in a skillet with some olive oil first.  Then, add the "meat" to the chili and simmer.  However, this recipe has enough flavor on its own.  I serve it with crusty garlic bread and a salad for a complete meal.  It heats up very well for leftovers.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe word-for-word. It was EXCELLENT. Hearty, healthy and yummy. My boyfriend also loved it. I agree with the majority of the reviews, I didn't miss the meat at all. If you want a very tasty chili, try this one...you won't be sorry!

Next time I will leave out the corn and chop the carrots and peppers more finely.  Both didn't have the mouth feel of chili to me.  I also left out the mushrooms, doubled the cumin, tripled the chili powder, halved the basil and added a little salt and red pepper flakes as well as a cup of textured soy..  Come to think about I guess I make a whole new recipe.

It was very bland. At the very least it needs salt and pepper. It was also more liquid than I prefer. I will drain the beans next time and I will also buy diced tomatoes rather than whole ones.

I skipped the mushrooms and peppers, as I did not have them on hand. I also added a can of chick peas, used chili ready tomatoes, and frozen corn instead of canned. Good served with grated cheddar jack cheese and tortilla chips. I'd consider using less cumin and more chili powder next time.

tasty!  I kind of wish it had more liquid in it - but I'm sure I can make that happen.  I added cilantry pesto, a zucchini and a roasted pasilla chili pepper becauase it needed a little more depth and spice for my taste.  also subbed hominy for corn.  topped with avocado crema.

Boring.  Doubled the spicy and still plain.  However, my almost 2 year old liked it.

I added some cheddar cheese in the end and it was so good! Also, drained the beans and the corn because I like it thicker.

This recipe was so easy and surprisingly good! I reduced the cumin a little, added slightly more chili powder and used two cans of chili beans, one hot and one mild.

Easy and very good. I followed the recipe to a tee except I added a package of sugar snap peas that I already had. Prepared it for my book club and they all loved it.

To me,this chili lacked flavor. It seemed like vegetable soup posing as chili. We ate it because its healthy but I wouldn't make again.

My husband is so picky. But I made this and he had seconds. I used chopped tomatoes, left out the spices and celery and upped the garlic. It all just went into the crock pot not the morning and when I came home it was done. We turned it to low at lunchtime and added some water. I will be doing this again. We topped it with a bit of finely shredded cheddar cheese.

I used stewed tomatoes, two cans of kidney beans and omitted the mushrooms (personal preference).  Very tasty and got better the next day.  It was a little thin for us; but that was an easy fix.  Great meal for a cold day with some homemade bread. Thanks, Tia the Baker, for sharing a wonderful Keeper for us !

What a great recipe and it only gets better.  We took suggestions from others: adding a can of black beans, 2 T cocoa powder, a can of italian diced tomatoes and a can of fat free refried beans. Also tossed in some left over peas. The refried beans and cocoa gave it a smooth, rich, smokey sauce and all the veggies made for a colorful and yummy chili.  Served with a dash of lemon juice, dashes of hot sauce, a dollop of low fat sour cream and corn muffins.  Thanks to Tia for her great recipe.

Excellent dish! I live alone and its a great dish that I can make a big batch of and reheat later. I love the celery and the mushrooms in it. I don't add corn and just use a can of mixed four beans to give it some variety :)

This was so delicious!!  I made it pretty much as is except for using frozen corn instead of can and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  Not only was it good on its own.  I was grilling tortillas with cheddar cheese and added some of the chili - my 7 year old was raving about how good they were!

Made this chili to top the steamed potatoes and sprinkled some cheddar on top and this made a FANTASTIC second course.  This chili is great when it's eaten with something, such as a potato, not sure if I'd like to eat it as a stand-alone chili.  Its good, you might want to add more spice to it.  It's not like firehouse chili but it's good and it's easy.  Made it for my friends and the REALLY loved it.

I have been making this recipe for over a year, and its always a huge hit!  The only thing different I do is put two 15.5 oz cans of kidney beans (light and dark), and I sometimes use ground chili pepper for a little extra kick.  Top it off with some fresh chopped cilantro and its fantastic!

It was easy to make but the final result wasn't anything special.  My husband and I found it kind of bland and had too much of a soup consistency.  I think there are better veggie chili recipes out there, especially for the main course.

this was very good. i made this instead of the usual ground beef chili i make and it was much better.
i used 2tbsp of chili powder and 1tsp of cumin powder like others suggested.
i also added in one 19oz can of black beans and a small package of yves ground veggie round. next time i think i'll add more of the veggie round.
great recipe, even for the meatlovers in the family, my family liked it better than the usually meat chili.

This chili is delicious!  I use a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole ones (it saves the mess of chopping the tomatoes).  I also add a bag of vegetarian meat crumbles.  Excellent and easy recipe.  It freezes great too!

I first made this for a group with a few vegetarians and a few meat lovers.  I doubled the recipe, and to half of it, I added ground turkey made with taco seasoning.  I also added a little extra chili powder.  Without the turkey, the chili is pretty good (3 or  stars), but with the turkey it is great (5 stars).  Both versions were a big hit!  I make it often now.

We were looking for a chili recipe that *didn't* include any meat substitutes because we've found it doesn't freeze very well. This one is fantastic! As per other reviewers, I cut the amount of red bell pepper in half since I wanted a spicier, less sweet chili. I also added about a tablespoon of green chiles for an extra kick. Once the finished product was in the bowl, we added a spoonful of sour cream and a handful of mixed shredded cheese and served with garlic bread. It was delicious and we've saved a batch in the freezer!

This was great!  I modified it slightly by adding tomatoe soup and fresh tomatoes, and tomatoe paste so it ended up being more of a stew, but it was DELICIOUS!  Will be making this again and again!

We love this recipe.  I have been looking for something like this for a long time.  I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes.  It turned out great. It's the first time I made chili and my boyfried who likes meat, loves it and told me it's perfect, and not to change a thing.

Even though I screwed up the directions.. (I threw in all the veges in step one together instead of sauteing the onions, carrots, garlic first, it still turned out great!  Used canola oil, seasoned with ground cumin&coriender mix, and italian seasoning.  I did not use chili powder (not friendly with my stomach), and used finely chopped serranos instead.  Did not cause heartburn! Served with corn bread.  Thanks for the tip on using a food processor... I used my mini chopper.  Thanks for the tip on rinsing the beans well, and using low-sodium cans of beans.  Loved it.  But was A LOT of work despite using the food chopper.

Very easy and tasty, I did not add the corn or mushrooms and it still got rave reviews from everyone who ate it.

This was very good, but I reduced the amount of chili, since the one I have is *really* hot. I served it with the "basic corn muffins", but added shredded cheddar cheese. My husband thought the mushrooms didn't really add anything to the dish, I might not add them next time, and add textured vegetable protein instead.

Tianne, I thought this was delicious!!!  I changes a few things though...I used two cans of beans in tomato sauce, and then 1 large can each of red kidney beans, mixed beans, and black beans (all rinsed).  I also added a tad more chili powder, and some cayenne.  Instead of whole kernel corn I used frozen niblets.  I did as others recommended and let it simmer....for about 4 hours actually.  Yummy!

This was the very best chili I've had in a long time.  It was so good, I forgot there wasn't any meat in it.  My roommate, who is a meat eater, even likes it and requests for me to make it often!

I'm not usually gung-ho about vegetarian main dishes but I tried this recipe late last night and it was out of this world!  I had a sampling limited to a cup and found it very hard to stop eating. The only addition I used was a bit of salt and pepper just before digging in.

I loved this chili. Even my picky 6 year old gave it a thumbs up! I left out the mushrooms, (as per the picky eater...), and replaced it with left over brown rice. I too added a little tomato paste to thicken it up. Very flexible recipe!

This is a delicious and very adaptable recipe.  I've fiddled with the amounts and types of vegetables - the mushrooms soak up some of the heat of the chili powder, so you'll get a spicier meal if you omit them.  Thank you!

It came out excellent, although I didn't follow the recipe step by step.  Throw in more of what you like and less of what you don't.  I added a bit more chile powder as well....yum yum!  I will make this again!

I was looking for a chili recipe with lots of veggies in it. This was great. I made some alterations though. I added about a pound of ground turkey which I browned with salt and pepper. I omitted the corn, added another can of beans and added a small can of tomato paste for more tomato flavor. Great recipe! Thanks

The recipe's as flexible as it says.  I sauted half of a jalapeno pepper, diced, with the garlic and onion (and probably could have added the whole thing--it's not too hot), left out the mushrooms, added a package of Morningstar "ground beef" crumbles, and used a little more than 1 cup of pre-soaked and cooked kidney beans (in their broth).  Oh, and it makes a *ton*.

I was looking for a chili recipe that had lots of vegi's but meat too so I added 1lb of hamburger (with salt/pepper and alot of crused red pepper) browed to, yellow as well as green and red peppers and and used 6-packets of a pre-made chili bought package that had most of the same stuff but with a lot more kick.  Finally I added one 6oz can of tomato sauce for extra liquid.  After bring to a boil I placed in a slow cooker for 4 hours.  It was great!

This recipe went over very well at my husband's fortieth bday party. I wasn't impressed at first during my taste tests and felt it needed something 'more'....but then my sister in law came over to try and said it was PERFECT, she'd been searching for a recipe just like it forever (of course, she now has it!) and after it had cooked on for another hour or two, the flavors had blended and I will admit, it was very good:) Will be making again:)

I drained & rinsed the kidney beans & corn & just added a little water to the pot.  I also left out the oregano due to a personal preference of my husband.  I served it with  shredded cheddar, to be added at the table.  This dish actually was a little sweeter than the chili recipes I've made in the past.  I'd add more chili powder if I make it again.

This recipe was extremely easy to make. I had no ground cumin so I used 1 Tbsp cilantro leaves instead. Added with a corn chip salad and corn bread, this chili fit in great with a Mexican Themed valentines day dinner.

My husband and I are trying to improve our diet by cutting our meat intake in half, so I tried this recipe.  Wow. This was great! I doubled the mushrooms (one can never have too many mushrooms!)
but otherwise kept to the recipe.  The spice was just right, and my husband and I loved it. Thank you.

Everyone in my family raved about this one!  This is a hearty but healthy alternative to meat chili.  Chopping the veggies was kind of time consuming, but the result was great.  I added extra onion and garlic too. This is a keeper!

I made this soup the first time for a "soup lunch" on Ash Wednesday at the office.  It was FABULOUSLY well received. This is a rich, very flavorful vegetarian recipe sure to satisfy the heartiest appetite.  I substituted navy beans for kidney beans, just for preference, but it's wonderful!

WOW! This is so quick and easy!  My husband loved it.  I used 2T of chili powder and it was just right for us.  You can add or substitute your vegetables/beans. I added a can of mixed beans with jalapenos and it gave it a bit more zip. Serve with warm french bread and a side salad and what a great dinner in 30 minutes! It's even better the next day. Will definately make this over and over again.  C. Ferris

This chili was GREAT. I made it a couple of weeks ago and everyone loved it and they usually don't like my vegetarian dishes. It wasn't really what I expected, it was really a sweet chili not a spicy one. I changed the recipe a little, I added yellow bell pepper as well and since not everyone in my family likes mushrooms I didn't add them but added a can of pinto beans and a can of chili beans, it made it really tasty and hardy. I also let it simmer together for longer then 20 minutes, it was more like an hour to an hour and a half. But I am actually making it tomarrow I loved it so much. Make a lot and freeze, it would be a great idea on those long cold days that you don't want to cook, just warm it up and its done.

This was excellent!!! My entire family really enjoyed it. I added ground turkey- that made it a little heartier. I'm going to try chicken tonight.

This stuff is awesome!  It is so thick and hearty.  My husband and I both absolutely love it.  Only 1 change--I used 2 15 oz cans of kidney beans instead of 1 19 oz can.

This was a fabulous and easy vegetarian chili recipe.  I did change spice amounts a bit and decided to add some cilantro.  My family enjoyed this meal.

Way too many different vegetables.  This may taste good, but you could spend all day chopping so many vegetables.  Good veg. chili needs only:  onions/garlic/celery/maybe corn.  

Beans, tomatoes and chili powder (which already includes oregano & other spices) are essential.  Those 3 things are what make chili taste good.  Anything else  are just extras and should be minimized.  

This recipe as it stands should be called "Vegetables Stew with Chili Flavouring."

Very easy and tasty. I made it on a Sunday, and ate it 4 nights in a row! It got better each night. I made it in a 3.5 Le crueset, left it in that, put it in fridge after it cooled. Then each night I'd take a few scoops out and microwave it. I ate hearty bread on the side for dipping. I didn't bother with cheese or sour cream, just buttered bread. It's so good I'm making another batch now. Ohh, I didn't use mushrooms, and I mixed beans, I can black kidney beans and the other was pinto beans. I also did a bit extra garlic and added a little cayenne. Ohh forgot, I added a couple of shakes of chipotle seasoning. Not sure I could even taste it, but I like more complex spices. It's tough to mess this up!

This chili is delicious, low cal, and healthy. I subbed a can of drained garbonzo beans for the corn.added a cup of chicken broth, and added a finely diced, seeded habanero pepper for some heat! It's very filling. Very easy to make.

My first time making chili! It was pretty good but I feel like I needed a little more flavor so I added salt other than that not bad for my first time making chili!


Edit: So I ate the whole four servings it was actually really, really, really good. Like I said I added salt (honestly, more than I should have for my health) nevertheless SO good.

I added a dash of cinnamon and used chili beans and black bean combo instead of kidney beans.
Had a party with 2 other meat chili pots, and lots of people were LOVING this meatless chili!

It could be a little bit richer, but other than that it was delicious! I added more chili powder and I didn't add some of the other spices to make it have that warmer taste.

Super easy to follow! It smells amazing and doesn’t lack any quality without having meat. I added a little extra of each veggie because we didn’t want to include mushroom or red peppers.

This veggie chili is excellent. Only ingredient I sometimes omit is the mushrooms. I love them, but my family not so much. Also, I like to use fire-roasted tomatoes. They give an extra little kick.

Great ingredients and it looked very tasty (forgot to take a pic). Unfortunately it was spicy, yet bland at the same time.  Won’t make again.

Very easy to make, if you don't mind some chopping! I found the seasoning to be just right, although I have seen others commenting on a need to alter the spices.  It was delicious, and I will definitely be making it again!

This chili recipe has become a staple meal in my household! It’s so easy compared to similar recipes and very flexible and forgiving. I usually change it up a bit each time, sometimes I put extra beans, sometimes different vegetable, sometimes different types of canned tomatoes, just depending on what I have on hand. It always turns out great!

It was OK but rather bland. My wife and I liked the texture for a vegetarian chili, but we have a couple of other veg chili recipes that we prefer. 
Including the canned juices and using them as a base seems to make this overly sweet without adding any savory since there’s no meat or broth. If I made it again I would at least double the chili powder.

This was our first time making veggie chili.  We were surprised at how good this was.  Will make again.  I used a bit less of the cumin, and added a can of rotel tomatoes with Chili’s.  Also used frozen corn.

I didn't have all the ingredients,  so based on this recipe i improvised. i used drained black beans, yellow bell pepper & substitute dehydrated onions.

It was wonderful, i made some basmati rice and spooned the chili over...no leftovers!

Yup, it was really easy!  Thank you.  I even did  use it as a breakfast burrito and my mom loved it...I just added the  beans and stuff onto my tortilla, melted cheese, and scrambled eggs and wrapped it up!  I’m sure I could’ve added lettuce toobut didn’t have any...it made a great filling!!!

this is the best vegetarian chili i have literally ever had. i love chili, and when i found this recipe i knew it would be amazing. the smell when you immediately start cooking is just fantastic. but nothing compares to the finished product. we’ve made this about three times and planning to make more. we double the batches every time and eat this for a week. we never get tired of it and it goes perfectly over rice!! we added a bit of whipping cream into the chili while cooking and for some reason it made it deliciously creamy and just.. wow!!! i will probably make this chili forever and ever. i made an account just to save this recipe because one day i couldn’t find it online and i was so upset! no other chili compares. i love it so much and so does everyone living with us. thank you!

I had a dinner guest who is vegetarian so I looked up this recipe. I followed the recipe almost exact however I added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed). I should have read a few more reviews before I made it because I would have realized sooner not to use so much cumin.  My vegetarian dinner guest thought it was ok.

Easy to make but relatively time consuming when you have to cut up all the veggies. Otherwise easy and straight forward to make. The end result was good...but VERY SPICY! Definitely has a kick to it. Maybe over some white bland rice? If I do make it again, will try to make it not sooo spicy

This was very good!  Based on the comments, I halved the cumin and doubled the chili powder.  I also added some black beans, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper and about 1/2 small can of tomato paste to thicken it up like chili.   This is a really good recipe to start from and tweak to make your own.  The combination of veggies really made a beautiful and delicious chili!  Thank you for sharing!

pretty tasty - a little sweet for my taste thought. 
I used 1 can black beans (lightly drained) and 1 can chili beans. I didn’t drain anything else and it wasn’t too soupy at all. I did add more chili powder (about double) and worchestershire sauce for&depth. I used 2 regular cans diced tomatoes.

I didn't find anything insanely easy about this.  I didn't find it easy at all.  Probably because I used whole veggies and I had to chop everything myself.  But it was well worth it because this dish is insanely delicious!  I made the usual modifications because I didn't have this or that and it was still great.  I saved this one to my recipe box and will definitely make again.  Thanks.

This really was the easiest recipe to make, and it was delicious!  Even my kids liked it, and they usually complain about anything with beans.  I dehydrated a serving to see if it was viable for backpacking and it rehydrated well and was just as flavourable.

Been a meat eater my entire life.  Two years ago I gave up pork and this year I decided to cut out meat entirely.  This was the first time I made vegetarian chili and I was pleasantly surprised. 

I found this chili to be very hardy like regular chili and the flavour was spot on.  Some have said to reduce the cumin and add more chili powder, that's all preference because I found the amount of cumin to be spot on. 

I also added some hot sauce and dried pepper flakes to give it a bit more punch.  Next time I'd probably add even more heat as it was still a bit weak on the heat side but flavours were great.

I plan to add this into my rotation of regular work lunches.

This chilli was fabulous and so easy to make! I added chickpeas after reading another reviewers comments and it was so good! Very hearty and so healthy!

I will make this again.  I have just started to make a vegetarian collection of recipes to pull from.    
I did not change anything BUT I will the next time add 1/2 the amount of chili powder.  I like spicy, BUT when one ingredient dominates in flavor it is out of balance. (Also, nose drippings don't mix well with the over "heated" chili-ha!)
So I will add it to my new collection and make it again! -minus the extreme heat!  
EASY & HEALTHY& TASTY

I took the advice in the comments and did one can of black beans and one kidney beans.  It was perfect!  

Also made a second pot with ground beef for my meat loving husband, just had to add more seasoning to that one.

I added a zucchini, a jalapeno pepper, black beans, and navy beans. I added more chili powder and additional seasonings to taste. It was simply wonderful.

I made this for a group function today and it got rave reviews! I pretty much made this recipe as written, except I only had beans in 15 oz. cans, so I used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans. I also pan seared the corn before adding it to the mixture (because I think that adds a bit more flavor). The only other addition I made was adding 1/8 t. each of cayenne pepper and smoked paprika.

After sauteing the vegetables, I put all the ingredients in a crock pot and cooked on low for about 5-6 hours. Easy and delicious!

I've made this recipe several times now, and it is really good.  It makes a lot too.  I did use two cans of diced tomatoes instead of the whole canned tomatoes, which I would have to chop.  This is an easy recipe to tweak (within reason) to fit what you have on hand and to your personal taste.  If you're a vegetarian/vegan or trying to cut back on meat, or even if you're a meat-eater, I really recommend this.

Very good chili! I doubled the amount of chili powder like others suggested and it worked well. Also, the flavor really improved the next day.  I recommend making this the night before serving so the flavors can mature overnight.

Really enjoyed this chili. Like other reviewers, I will add more chili powder next time. Unlike them, however, I won't cut back on the cumin -- I think it is just the right amount.

This recipe was good... but I agree that there is too much cumin. I had to double up on chili powder and add some water, salt and pepper to make the cumin less fragrant. Delicious with low fat sour cream!

I don't know that ANY vegetable dish is "easy" because all of the chopping but...this was amazing! I took it to a potluck because we have a number of vegetarians in the office and EVERYONE loved it. My daughter, who is an extremely finicky eater even asked for seconds. You'll never miss the meat.

It's ok.  I think it might benefit from some vegetable bouillon.  I had a jalapeño, so I added that, but overall, it's an OK base, but "insanely easy" doesn't always mean overly tasty.

Made this for an office potluck for a vegan and gluten/dairy free option and a number of my coworkers raved about it. For me it was a little on the bland side, but to each their own.

It was a super easy recipe admittedly. I sauteed the veggies as instructed and from then dumped everything into the slow cooker to be served up the following day.

I made this after work. Relatively simple, I used what I had in the cupboard and substituted where I could. I added a cup of green lentils and used a can of black beans to replace the kidney beans. I didn't have basil so I used some Mrs. Dash seasoning instead. Overall, my kid sister and mother really liked it.

I love this and have made it 3 times now. Thanks!

I find it best to drain all the cans to make the chilli thicker. I save some of the juice, as sometimes I like to add it as needed for moisture, especially for the leftovers.

I always add one package (322 grams = 11 oz) of vegan ground round shortly before finishing cooking. I like it fairly spicy,  so some crushed red chilli pepper and ground cayenne pepper finish it off great for me.

Enjoy all!

It was easy to make, and tasted good.  I accidentally put 1 1/2 Tbsp of oregano and basil, but was still good.   I added some 1 bunch of whopped kale, and 2 handfuls of spinach.  I put all the ingredients in a pressure cooker and cooked for 25 minutes.  Delicious topped with cheese and a couple of dashes of Chipotle pepper sauce for additional heat.

This chili was delicious! I only added a tsp of the chili powder because my 13 month old was eating it as well. I followed the correct measurements for everything else and it was delicious. I loved all the vegetables! I will be making this again for sure.

We altered this slightly and will be making it often.
Our twist...
Olive oil rather than vegetable oil
We skipped the celery and the mushrooms
6 garlic cloves rather than 3
Red and yellow bell pepper, no green bell pepper
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tbsp chipotle chili powder
Substituted crushed fire roasted tomatoes for the whole peeled tomatoes
Deleted the corn
Added three different organic beans: organic chickpea (garbanzo beans), organic kidney beans, organic black beans. We used all the liquid for the chickpeas and 3/4 of the liquid for the kidney and black beans.
Fresh basil instead of the dried
Breakup or slice then heat up in a pan some Field Roast Mexican chipotle vegetarian sausage (or just toss into hot chili/stew) before serving
Add some fresh basil as garnish 
We didn't have ripe avocados or they would have been added just before serving as well.
Voila
Bon Appetit!

I'm not a vegetarian but my daughter and I wanted to cut back on meat somewhat. I would never have eaten veg chili before but figured I'd make this recipe and try it.
I've made it many times and I love it. Don't miss the meat at all as there's so many ingredients, you feel like you're eating a substantial meal and the taste? Delicious.
Even when I leave out some ingredients that I might not have on hand like mushrooms, sometimes only 1 color of pepper. I usually add 2 cans of kidney beans as I feel 1 can gets overwhelmed by so much other stuff but it's certainly not necessary. Very easy to make too.

Fantastic!!!  I substituted hominy for the corn (would do that again!), and added 1 tsp. salt with the other seasonings.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

It was filling but kind of bland, even with an increase in chili powder and the recommended 1 tsp of cumin that other reviewers suggested. I'm not sure how to modify it to give it more pizazz, but it is a good way to get some veggies and beans in ya. The chopping was more time consuming than first thought.

I've made this several times now, adding ingredients each time when I think of a flavor that would complement it. I add green beans, nutmeg, salt, pepper, garlic powder and sage. It's so delicious I double up on the recipe so we can have leftovers for work lunches!

This is a very hearty and delicious dish. I did add a few additional ingredients and a substitution though. And I left out the corn.

I added in lime juice, cilantro, and fresh jalapeno peppers.
I substituted hot chili beans instead of the beans the recipe called for.

It was very delicious!! I added cheese and sour cream to my bowl and had a side of guacamole.

Super easy and healthy! While things are cooking on the stove, I can chop up the next few items that have to go in or clean as I go. So although the total cook time is an hour, I still feel like it doesn't take long to make! Definitely didn't take me and my boyfriend long to devour it! I added a little black pepper while simmering and garnished with shredded mozzarella cheese and it was awesome!

I needed to make two chilis - one a vegetarian and one with meat and no beans.  I used this recipe as the base but used crushed tomatoes instead.  Before I added the beans, I took out 2/3 to make my version with meat using a  mixture of browned beef and turkey, adding about 1.5 lbs.  With the meat added, I needed more tomatoes so added about 1/2can.  I then added the beans to the vegetarian recipe.  I also added a bit more of cayenne to spice it up.  Everyone loved it and it was easy to end up with two different recipes out of the basic one.  For those wanting more heat, sliced jalapeño would be good to be added too.

I added some salt and an additional heaping teaspoon of chili powder. I omitted mushrooms but added a zucchini, and threw in a can of garbanzo beans too. It was delicious! I ate it with a splash of hot sauce and a sprinkle of grated four-cheese Mexican blend.

This is a real winner! Entire family loves it. I use two cans of black beans instead of kidneys. I omit mushrooms and add corn and lentils. So darn good it won second place in my company’s chili cook-off!

This was a good resource to get some basic chili ingredients together and the procedure, but I agree with the comments about it being on the bland side, I added jalapeno peppers to give it the kick that makes it chili.

Easy to make and delicious! And my boyfriend who rarely eats vegetarian, loved it, too! I put an extra can of beans in it and let it simmer for about an hour instead of 20 minutes, to get the flavors to blend fully.

It was great. I made a low sodium version by boiling dry beans with some onion and garlic. I used the cooking water from that instead of the liquid from canned beans. I also substituted fresh veggies for canned ones which made for lots of cutting but also lower sodium.

Excellent base recipe for vegetarian chili.  As the author noted, you can vary the vegetables and beans to suit your taste or what you have on hand, and it still works.  I added extra chili powder only because I like a spicy chili.  But people should note that the amount of chili powder also depends upon what type of chili powder you happen to have...some are much hotter than others.  I also added some worcestershire sauce (you could also use soy sauce) to give it some "umami".  Delicious!

Easy AND good.  Even easier: chili mix seasoning; mexicorn canned corn; Rotel diced tomatoes and chilis. Most other ingredients come pre-chopped in the produce section. Really easy. Next time I'll fix cornbread to go with.

Quick and easy, super good!!  I made a few changes based on  personal preference and what I had on hand.  I left out the mushrooms and corn so I added a can of chili beans.  I happened to have fire roasted diced tomatoes that I used. I also rinsed the kidney beans.  I didn't add the liquid, I just couldn't do it as it grosses me out a little. This was really great, I will make again!

Just started on a vegetarian diet and this is recipe makes me feel like there's great options out there! It's easy and uses most ingredients already in the house.  I found it really spicy so I may be using a tsp of chili next time! Amazing recipe and will be eating it often!

This was so delicious and very easy. The only changes I made were adding half black beans and half pinto beans as I was out of kidney beans. I also served it with a little bit of shredded cheddar. My 1 year old LOVED it as did my 6 and 4 year olds. Success!

I've made this several times and we love it. My daughter is a recent vegetarian and this was one of the first recipes I discovered, now it's her favorite. It's very quick and easy to make, perfect for my busy schedule.

This chili is easy to make and has a lot of good flavor.

I put in four cans of beans instead of one to help it to stretch further.

I followed the recipe to a tee because I'm an actual cooking idiot but some how it still turned out real liquid-y. This was "insanely easy" until I started pouring in the beans, tomatoes, and corn. I don't know what I could have done differently. I think reviews are supposed to answer more questions than they ask... but I'm an actual idiot so this is what it is. I like the way this chilli tastes but I would want it to be thicker next time. The ingredients were swell, just the right about of everything. Maybe I should have drained the tomatoes and beans? Have a good day y'all!

I made this recipe as submitted. I like my chili served over rice and topped with sour cream, shredded cheese and avocado. This chili was very good served that way. I will definitely make it again.

Holy mother of pain- DO NOT, under any circumstances, ADD TOO MUCH CHILI POWDER. May death take you swiftly if you do for it is a thing- no, force- to be reckoned with.

This is a really wonderful recipe.  I've made it several times and it always turns out great.  My vegan son enjoyed it very much, as have omnivore friends (topping with some shredded sharp cheddar cheese and/or light sour cream).  I usually also bake a corn bread to go with it which complements it nicely.  Changes:  I don't include mushrooms and I usually do one can of kidney beans and one can of black beans.

Great chili! I recommend adding salt and another can of beans. I also didn't use mushrooms or bell peppers. It's very vegetable heavy, and I wanted a bit less on the veggie side. Good stuff! SO easy.

This is the recipe for the chili I made yesterday. It is soooo good. I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I didn't use that but otherwise it is exact and delicious.  Deceivingly sweet FYI, but it was amazing we are a meat eating family but I like to throw in meatless meals to expand my horizons. It was so easy. I did leave it simmer on the stove top for longer than the recipe just because that is how I like to cook my normal chili. JUST TRY IT!

This chili is absolutely delicious!! I added cannelini beans and left out the celery because I don't like it. I added less cumin than called for and just about doubled the chili powder. I also added salt and pepper to it for some extra flavor and a pinch of garlic salt. Topped it with cheddar cheese and sour cream and it was absolutely amazing! Will definitely be making again!

Wow! What can I say about this recipe other than DELISH! My friend and I were looking for a quick and easy chili recipe one night and this hit the spot!! We opted to forgo the corn, celery, and carrots as it was cold out and we didn't feel like running to the store again. BRRRR! The tomato base got a bit thin due to the bean juice also in there so my friend suggested throwing in a teaspoon of flour and it thickened right up. Boy was she right, genius!! Throw some shredded cheese on top of this and hold off those cold nights with a warm cup of wonderful chili!

This is the best chilli my family has enjoyed . . . EVER!!
I don't add mushrooms or celery. And I do use black beans and cannelini beans. Which proves this recipe is so versatile. And I don't think it needs lots of salt. All extended family members have begged for the recipe!

This was very easy to make but i made mine in the slow cooker and added some extra spices for more heat. We are not vegetarians so i also added some leftover chicken that i had and it was delicious. I have a type 2 diabetic in the house and their blood sugar was good two hours after having a little more than a cup of this and salad for dinner. Will be made many times in our house!

A bit bland but adding salt and more chili powder helped tremendously. Not my favorite, will have to try out more chili recipes. Overall it is very tasty for something healthy!

I made this two days ago and thought it was "just okay" - I doubt I will make it again.  It was rather bland, even though I did add extra amounts of the spices after reading some of the other reviews.

I tried this recipe to find a way to get more veggies in my diet. I love meat and am not used to cooking with vegetables.  It's so good! I ate all of it by myself in 3 meals! A lot of chopping but very easy! Daikon was a good addition.

I really like this recipe.  I also omitted the mushrooms and added kidney and cannellini beans and extra chili powder and garlic, and using fresh tomatoes and peppers (red and yellow bell)  from the garden. This is really wonderful chili.

Surprisingly great flavor despite not having any beef stock base. I added in a can of black beans and some red pepper flakes for spice. I took away one star as it didn't quite fill me up and we still felt hungry after dinner.

I love this recipe and make it in big batches to freeze in lunch-size containers. I reheat and serve with fresh coriander and a few tortilla chips for a fast weekday lunch. Modifications: I prefer black beans to kidney, and drain and rinse them because canned bean juice is gross (I add extra water if necessary). I also use diced tomatoes rather than chopping whole ones because it's even easier.

This was very easy to make.  I added some Seasoned Salt, four cloves of garlic and one vegetable broth bouillon cube.  I also used fresh basil and fresh parsley (because I had it on hand).  Had it with French rolls warmed in the oven.  Yummy!!!  Will definitely make this again.  Great for taking to work the next day for lunch.

The hardest part of this was prep. Chopping chopping chopping. But it was easy peasy after that. Didn't require much adjustment of any for seasoning.

I love this recipe!  I found though that it takes a long time to chop up all of the ingredients, so next time I'll use a food processor to help cut the vegetables up.  It's always gone within a couple of days.  I added zucchini once and it was great with zucchini!  If you really love mushrooms, I would put a little extra in, because they get smaller as you cook them.

This was tasty but I thought it needed something more substantial. After trying a bowl of it, I cooked a cup of rice and added it to the remaining chili. Next time I will add a cup of uncooked rice to the chili and add more liquid so the rice cooks in the chili. I garnished with avocado slices which was a nice touch. I will make this again.

I enjoy this recipe and so does my family! I actually place all ingredients in the crock pot minus the oil and put on low for about 5 hours. I also add 2 cans of beans and a pound of ground beef depending on my mood and the amount of people I am feeding. It's super easy to adjust for more people and leftovers freeze well. Grandpa G would be proud.

Great one for when time is limited. Personally I reccomend doubling up the mushrooms and adding a variety of chillies

You never miss what's missing! (the meat)
I have to double batch the recipe for my large crew. I use dark and light kidney beans and pintos. I also add Rotel tomatoes with green chilies for an extra kick of flavor. So glad i found this recipe. It's become a favorite in my house.

Very good and easy for someone who wants to start cooking more but needs to start somewhere first. I added some crumbled and cooked Lightlife Smart Ground (vegan ground beef alternative) to this as well as a little cinnamon.

This recipe was pretty good, however, I made a few changes.  I left out the celery and corn and added two small chorizo links (casings removed. making it decidedly non-vegetarian) - I was mainly trying to adapt ingredients that I already had, rather than go out and get more!
Anyway, it was quite flavorful and filling.  In the future, I would probably also leave out the mushrooms, such an odd addition to a chili.

Fantastic! I added a can of spicy chi beans, added an extra tsp of chili powder, and replaced the green pepper with yellow. I never follow a recipe! It's a great base recipe.

I added a 10 oz can of tomatoes with diced green chilies and a little spicy V-8 juice and it turned out great.  There's no meat in this recipe and you don't miss it with all the wonderful veggies.

This chilli turned out delicious, even though I was missing some of the spices- I decided to try it anyways because it was so simple! I followed the recipe but did not have oregano, cumin, or basil on hand, so doubled the amount of chilli powder.  I added 1 can kidney (drained), 1 can mixed beans (drained) & 1 can drained corn.  I like my chilli thick so I held off on the brine.  The tomatoes I used were canned/diced and had basil and oregano seasoning so those must have done the trick for the remaining spices!  I added didn't add celery or mushrooms because i'm not crazy about those flavors in chilli. Also used 7 cloves of garlic as opposed to 3 because I love the taste! Mmm, delicious!

Being on a six week vegan cleanse has led me to a very dull pallet lately, but this chili blew that pallet away! As an 18 year old I didn't cook all that much before this and it was very easy to make! This is an easy, healthy, delicious meal for and level of cook!

Maybe I was not given fresh chili powder, but the chili had a bitter aftertaste. The smell too was not something I appreciated. However, after putting some sugar in it to cover up the bitter taste, it was not so bad! Maybe next time I will either get fresh chili powder or omit it altogether.

This was so good! I drained all of the canned stuff because I like my chili chunky. I added a can of black beans, cut down the cumin, and used cayenne instead of chili powder. Also added some paprika and Valentina's (the mexican hot sauce I add to everything!) and switched the celery for some zucchini. I wish I wasn't so full, otherwise I would eat some more!

this is really fun to make and it smells super good all through cooking it. i used orange and yellow bell peppers for maximum rainbow variety. I also added garlic salt when i added the beans. hannafords has canned diced tomatoes with chilies and thats really good to use if you want to use canned. i made it with both fresh and canned and canned always comes out thicker. i have never made this dish with mushrooms due to their general unpopularity. i always cook with a wooden spoon for extra flavor too!

Excellent. A local deli makes vegetable chili and I wanted to try and make my own.  I did not use mushrooms. Like the local deli I used chopped zucchini and 2 cans garbanzo beans. I increased the kidney beans to 2 cans and only had crushed tomatoes. I also used 3 Tbsp of chili powder because we like a little more "bite". This recipe was excellent to get me on the right track for what I was copying. Really delicious!!!

I found it kind of bland, except for the cumin, which overpowered everything else. So, no. Not a recipe I'll try again.

My dinner group loved this - after I added salt, black pepper and more chili powder. I didn't use mushrooms (not my favorite). I didn't understand the point of the instructions to use a can of whole tomatoes and then chop them. Next time I will use a can of diced tomatoes and see if it changes the flavor.

My husband is a picky vegetarian. One of his favorite dishes is vegetarian chili. Even though I love to cook and produce some awesome dishes, I was always scared of how not well I can make chili. I cooked some beans in my pressure cooker yesterday and decided I will make chili with it. I had all the ingredients, even though I love celery and corn I would not use in this particular way so I did not use them. I absolutely loved it, not to mention I am no longer scared to walk in chili territory.

So delicious!  We don't use the full amount of chili pepper because the kids don't like spicy, but I bet most adults would love it.  We quadruple it, and eat it for days, or freeze.  Great with cornbread made with maple syrup.  Thanks so much for sharing this insanely delicious recipe.  Who knew vegetarianism could taste so good?

Love this recipe!  To save time I replace all vegetables with two cans of mexicorn and add Morningstar crumbles. You can just throw everything into the pot at once!

It was more of a soup than a chili.  I added 3 tbl of chili powder and still was bland and could have used more. It also had a sweetness to it that I didn't like. I wished I drained the and rinsed the beans and corn

I really liked this and so did my daughter. The chili was not that spicy with the levels the original poster suggested. I used a can of black and a can of kidney beans, didn't have bell peppers, and mushrooms in chili just sounded weird to me, but it still worked out nicely :)

Our whole family loves this recipe.  I made a few adjustments--I increased the chili powder to 1-1/2 T and added 1/2 t of red pepper.  Also, I added 3/4 cup of quinoa for extra protein before the "bring to boil" and simmer at the end.  A tasty and healthy dish for a cold day!

Super easy and delicious!  I didn't have carrots, mushrooms, or celery, so I omitted them. I substituted a packet of McCormick chili seasoning for all the spices too, which made this even easier, no measuring.

This chili is definitely easy, healthy, and flavorful. We enjoy it in my house. However, it lacks the complexity of flavor that would make it 5 stars. It's a great basic recipe that you can adjust to fit your taste.

This vegetarian chili was not only really simple to prepare but it was also ridiculously filling. I thought it was pretty decent and it had a wonderful variety of vegetables included. The only changes I made from the original recipe is to double the garlic, added both salt and cayenne for extra flavor.

This is a tasty chili recipe. I used crushed tomatoes and only one cup of bell pepper. It was a little bland for me, so I added another tablespoon of chili powder. After that addition, I thought it tasted perfect. I bought frozen corn for the chili, but forgot to add it! I plan to make this chili again.

This was bland.  I added more cumin, salt, and chili powder...that made it ok. Next time I make veggie chili I'll be looking for another recipe.

I thought this vegetarian chili recipe was AMAZING!!! I followed the advice of others to double the chili powder and cumin. I think that alteration gives it a lot of taste. I a also added a pinch or two of ground hot pepper to give it a little spice. I ate mine with a baked potato and some sour cream. Deeelicious!!

The best vegetarian chili ever! I make this every week to take to work for lunch, and I love it. It get better every day. Easy delicious and healthy. Sometimes I put in the celery sometimes I don't. I used my home canned tomatoes. I usually put some sour cream and shredded cheddar in it after I heat it up. Several co workers have asked for the recipe.

My husband had a taste for chili and I had most of the ingredients...I used tomato sauce (2 15 oz cans) 1/2 can water, pinto beans, and no peppers, no mushrooms -  but I added 1/2 lb ground beef seasoned with season salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder.  He loved it!

I really love this recipe. I didn't follow it exactly, I more just look at the ingredients and decide on my own measurements. But the combination was fantastic. I left out celery cuz we don't really like it much around here, used onion poweder instead, and I did 50/50 kidney and black beans. And it turned out absolutely delicious.

This was very good.  I added two cans of beans and more corn, peppers and mushrooms, because I had these leftover from Christmas.  I also added a small amount of sauteed spinach, which I had left over.   I can't believe I didn't have chili power, so I had to make my own.  I think because I had more veggies and improvised on the chili powder, I ended up with it being pretty spicy, but lacking a little depth, so I added two teaspoons of cocoa, which I've seen in other chili recipes.  It added the needed depth.  I will make this again.

Great recipe!  My husband loved it.  I used black beans instead of kidney beans and did not have any carrots and it was still delicious.  I used the spices as recommended and thought it was good although I might put in a bit more chili spice next time.

Where's the meat in this recipe?  It did not say anything about being vegetarian.  Try using ground venison as it is not absorbed with antibiotics and hormones.

Great recipe, and easy to play with and get a delicious meal.  Like other reviewers, I added a can of black beans.  I also added a potato because I had just one and didn't know what else to do with it.  I didn't have a can of tomatoes, so I added 2 TBL of tomato paste, and a hand full of fresh cherry tomatoes, diced.  I prefer fresh herbs, so added those as well.  Thanks for the great start!

I'm not a chili fan but this stuff is really good! My husband really loved it, and so did my sister. I thought it tasted great with mexican cheese mix and in rice. I've made it twice. I really like it. I don't have any cumin, so I didn't add any of that, but it still tasted really good.

I as not a big fan of this chili and neither was my husband. I tried adding more chili powder, pepper, garlic powder, onion salt, red chili flakes, cayanne pepper and tabasco and it still tasted too bland. We did like the mix of veggies and the corn but i think I will stick with my original recipe :(

Fantastic, in our household we are like spices and we subbed the chilli powder with Really Hot ones the you can get at ethnic stores. We already made it 3 times and more for sure.

This is great. The mushrooms are different but add a dimension of texture that a lot of veggie chilis are missing. I cooked this the night before serving, as most chili "aficianados" recommend. Before serving, I sliced queso blanco in 1/4" slices and fried it both sides, Serving the chili in crocks topped with a slice of the fried cheese, slivered fresh habenero, and red onion slices, and served a wedge of haas avacado on the side. Good stuff!

I wouldn't say this was insanely EASY, as the chopping takes awhile, but it is insanely GOOD.
So good, in fact, my husband and I make this once a week, every week!
I also add a can of black beans. Adding a bag of Boca crumblies also turns out great, but it has so much flavor it isn't necessary.

I'm vegetarian but wanted something sort of like Cincinnati-style chili so I decided to try this recipe.  I left out the corn but not the mushrooms, even though the idea of mushrooms in chili sounded odd to me.  Actually, I think the mushrooms are important as they give this vegetarian chili a more "meaty" flavour and texture.  I served it over spaghetti with grated cheddar cheese on top and it was very addictive.

This chili was super - great flavour, very filling, perfect if you're doing the Weight Watchers thing. So good we added it to the weekly rotation. Thanks.

My boyfriend and I have been trying to find some meatless recipes that we both enjoy for a while and this one is a keeper.  I didn't have celery so I made it without it.  I also used a can of mushrooms instead of fresh....sometimes you have to use what you have on hand.  I cut down on the cumin a little too.  I also added a can of rinsed chick peas and a can of Maple flavored baked beans.  We enjoyed it so much we've added it to our weekly menu.

This was a tasty and healthy dinner!  I doubled the recipe for company and added an extra can of drained kidney beans, next time I'd add 2 cans.

This was good. I liked it better the next day, my husbund who is a meat eater really liked it. His response to alot of my stuff is "it's ok". I left out mushrooms only because they don't seem to go in chilie but maybe will try them next time. I also added some flour because broth part was to watery for me. I added some vegetarian style burger crumbles and i don't think my husband even noticed. Next time i think i'll try some jalepenos! Yum

I made this for some friends and they loved it!  You really don't miss the meat!  I didn't use carrots, but I did add some chopped green chilis and it really tasted awesome!  I will definetly make this chili again!
