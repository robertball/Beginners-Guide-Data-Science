Sur La Table makes these gingerbread cookies that I absolutely adore, but they are $2 per cookie! Once my son realized he likes them too, I decided it was time to learn how to make them myself. This recipe is very easy and the cookies turned out delicious, as good as the Sur La Table cookies. We decorated them with royal icing. I followed the recipe exactly.

Only made a few changes, instead of vegetable oil I used butter & coconut oil. Also, used Sorghum Molasses instead of dark molasses. Sorghum has a more mild flavor. We really liked this recipe since we were looking for a gingerbread cookie that wasn’t as bold flavored as some recipes.

I made no changes to the recipe. We made smaller assorted shaped cut outs which gave us a lot more cookies. This is the easiest recipe and  most delicious that I have used in 40+ years. My grand daughter and family had a blast decorating them all. Thank you!!!!!

I got 37  3.5” cookies. If rolling on granite use parchment between the dough & countertop, lightly floured. Keep dough refrigerated between rolling small batches. Enjoy my amateur decorating ..  first time using royal icing!

I did not make any changes to recipe. Yes, I would make them again.  This is an easy recipe with minimal ingredients.  

I made them (purposely undecorated)  to take to a Holiday children's party where they could decorate them themselves.

Delicious but there are a few errors in this recipe.  recipe says “lightly floured surface” but you’ll need more flour than that. Do yourself a favor. Cover the area with parchment paper where you plan to knead, cover that with 3/4 cup flour (but keep an additional 1 3/4- 2 cups on hand in a bowl) and add to that from bowl as needed. Then knead dough directly with rolling pin. Wax paper between rolling pin and dough is not necessary.  I found no “Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Spice Cake” mix at neither Target nor Market Street. But at the latter, I did find Duncan Hines Signature Spice Cake mix. All errors considered, I’d still make this recipe again as it was very tasty. However, personally, I preferred the cookies that I didn’t roll out as thin as 1/4 in. because I like them more soft than crunchy.

Wonderful easy recipe...
Instead of gingerbread man cookie cutter- I decided to be fun & make 'gingerbread pigs'... & instead of nonpareils... I used raisins for eyes...great fun with the family...
