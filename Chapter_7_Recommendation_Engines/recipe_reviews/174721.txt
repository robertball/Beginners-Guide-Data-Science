This is excellent.  I love it!  Bf liked it very much too.  I used bacon as I didn't have sausage, but I'm sure it would be just as good with sausage.  To make things easier on myself, I just chopped the sun dried tomatoes in the food processor with the rest of the ingredients that needed mixed with it.  Takes a few pulses and voila!  mixed together and chopped sun dried tomatoes all at the same time.  I used the jarred sun dried tomatoes in oil for this recipe as it didn't say one way or the other.  Worked perfectly.  At the written time and temp it got pretty dark; I probably should've checked on it, but it really didn't affect the taste at all.  Still very wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!  We will make it again.

DH loved it.  I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe for the crust.   Substituted chopped onion for the shallots.  Used dried tomato in a package-no oil-and snipped it very fine with kitchen scissors.  Used a mix of colby and mozzerella grated cheese because that's what I had.  Baked at 350F for 50 minutes in a French White quiche dish, let it set for 10 minutes.  Used mild sausage; it was very good.

Our new favorite dish, but I've made some changes.  I made it with vegetarian sausages, and added more garlic than the original recipe calls for.

This turned out excellent.  Only difference is I used spicy sausage since that's all I had on hand.  I was slightly concerned about the spiciness but it was perfect.  I used the sun dried tomatoes packed in oil.  While baking I tented with foil because I was worried it would brown too much.  I prepared this the night before and heated it up the following morning.  Great.  Will make again!

I used half-and-half instead of whipping cream, just because my husband has a problem with heavy cream. The result was really yummy; he couldn't stop eating it!

Wow!  I made this for my husband's birthday breakfast...so SO good!!  Instead of mozz. cheese, I used Provel (it's a combination of swiss, cheddar, & provelone-- a St Louis thing).  This will be a keeper!

This is an easy and delicious quiche recipe that can be altered to your own liking.I gave it 4 stars because i wasn't amazed. I think the sun dried tomatoes could be reduced.  I added my signature ingredients of spinach and cayenne pepper. It was great and cooked perfectly after 50 minutes, I did tent with foil for half an hour. I also chose colby jack cheese instead of mozzarella and used 2 boneless chicken thighs in place of the sausage at the request of my boyfriend. Tasted good, but would love to try again with the sausage.  Will continue to use this recipe as a base and switch up the meats and cheeses! Would be nice for brunch or breakfast with bacon.

This recipe is definitely a winner. I make a Quiche once a month and bring it in to work. This is a nice addition to the other flavors in the once a month lineup. The recipe worked for me just like it was written.

This quiche smelled delicious when it was baking and came out looking beautiful.  I was really excited to try it but ended up pretty disappointed.  I really thought it was only ok!  Kinda one-note to me.  Maybe the recipe relies too much on flavoring from the sausage, I'm not sure.  I've had better.

This was delicious and the crust was NOT soggy as in many quiches.  I did not have sundried tomatoes on hand so I used fresh.  I sauted them a bit in the sausage pan just to start their cooking. The flavor was wonderful and tasty. The whipping cream made it fluffy and light.  I did use 5 eggs because my pie dish was deeper than most.  This was a smart choice.  I baked the final step 45 mins.  The crust was perfect.  Try it, you'll like it!

This recipe was super easy and delicious. I made it for my boyfriend and some company to rave reviews. Boyfriend actually asked for it again so I used the second pie crust to whip him up another one. I added more garlic because imho too much can never hurt, subbed cilantro for parsley, and used a mix of mozzarella and provolone shredded cheese. Thumbs up!

This is excellent!! I took the chance and used a deep dish pie crust and glad I did. The flavor is so good with the sun-dried tomatoes. I used ones in oil and herbs. So perfect for a Brunch menu!

We made this for a light dinner accompanied by a spinach salad with dijon balsamic vinaigrette.  My husband(told him it was a frittata) said this was so good he can't wait to have the leftovers tomorrow for breakfast with coffee!  Only did 1/4 cup sundried tomatoes and 1/4 cup fresh spinach w/pinch cayenne as per other reviewers. Thanks great recipe!

I made some changes, but what a great recipe! I used sweet onion, low fat cream and skipped the parsley. I also sautéed spinache in with the sausage and sundried tomatoes. I used a variety of sharp cheeses instead of the mozzarella. I increased my eggs to 6, my cream to 1.5 cups, sundried tomatoes to 3/4 cup, and my sausage to 3/4 lb. The quiche had meat and spinache in every single bite. It took just under an hour to cook.  Took this to a girls brunch party and it was a hit! Mixed well with mimosas! Sounds like a strange combination with the meat and sundried tomatoes but it works and works well!

I am typing this as I am eating a left over piece for my lunch.  Fabulous!!! I did not have mozzarella so I used cheddar and I did not have shallots so I used a small onion.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will try the mozzarella.  Keeper!!! Thank you.

i didn't like this recipe at all. i found the sun dried tomatoes to be too much and the quiche didn't have much flavor otherwise. it would have been better with regular tomatoes - perhaps romas.

This recipe is great, but missing one instruction.  You must cover the edges of the pie crust during the 45-minute baking time, otherwise the crust will burn.  Also, 45 minutes was too long - the top was browned after only 30 minutes.  Otherwise, I followed the instructions exactly as written, and everyone in the family raved about how delicious it was.

This is an amazing recipe. I have now made it tons of times since Nov. 2011 never changing the ingredients. I have even made it in little tart shells (makes 24 easily) putting a parsley leaf on top before baking as apps for parties and literally everyone wants the recipe. I make two large ones at a time and freeze one or both so handy for last minute lunch or dinner. I will never make a boring ham quiche again - thank you tons Stephanie!

I've made this several times, and everyone always wants the recipe!  I usually mix it all together,  and use unbaked tortilla shells ( Tortilla Land uncooked tortillas),  in muffin tins to make it.  Bake 18-20 minutes when using the muffin tins.

I liked the recipe but I would make a few modifications. The taste was a little bland and sorta dry. 
I would use spicy sausage instead of regular. Store was out so I used regular. I would add another clove of garlic and maybe one additional scallion. I also was try a different cheese. Maybe a med. cheddar. I used smoked sun-dried tomatoes but will use sun-dried soaked in oil to make it more moist. Lastly, I would pull back on the cooking time. Recipes says 45-60 min. I would cook for 40 min then check every min thereafter.

This was really tasty and pretty easy to make.  I did make the mistake of following the instructions for the frozen pie crust here instead of following the pre-bake instructions on the crust label, so I had to make a second one since the first was a bit overdone.  I used regular milk since I forgot to pick up the cream, and I used a reduced fat colby jack, which worked very nicely with the sausage and tomatoes.

This is so super easy to make and absolutely delicious!  I substituted chicken sausage for the pork sausage.  My kids and husband love it!
