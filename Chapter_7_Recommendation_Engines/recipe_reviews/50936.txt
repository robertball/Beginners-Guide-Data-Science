I changed this recipe to the way that my aunt used to make it and we always loved it and still do...  melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a 13x9 pan in the oven @ 375 degrees F, once the butter is melted place the apples over the butter and bake for 10 min till apples are soft. (we use 1 1/2 lbs of granny smith apples)  When the apples are soft remove from oven and sprinkle a mixture of: 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg on top of apples. then set aside
blend eggs, milk, flour, sugar, vanilla, salt and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  pour mixture over apples and bake at 375 degrees F for 35 minutes.

This recipe does have an 'eggy' taste, so if you don't like eggs this recipe isn't for you.

This was so delicious! Similar to a recipe I made before, but just as good. This one with cinnamon in the batter was delicious! I did. blend the liquid ingredients until smooth, and baked it longer than the suggested time. I also added some cinnamon to the brown sugar topping. We devoured it. It's delicious cold or reheated as well. A keeper!

My family and I really enjoyed this one, but I made the changes Caire suggested (and added even more cinnamon since we love lots of flavor).  The 5 star rating is with the changes.  It really becomes a different recipe after being changed so much.  I kind of question how well it would work without those changes.  By the way, my apple and butter mixture floated to the top when I poured in the batter.  I didn't expect that, but it worked out great.

I've been making this for years and my family loves it.  I looked it up at Allrecipes today to find out how to scale it upward.  I modify this way -- I slice the apples and toss them with 1/4 tsp allspice and the cinnamon.  Then heat the butter in the oven to melt, then add the apple slices and heat apples until they sizzle.  Then I add the batter and and top with brown sugar and bake at 425 for 20 mins.  DELISH!!

This is not what I would call a pancake-closer to an apple ommlet.  I had a different recipe called the same thing and couldn't find it so I used this one.  I had to use a casserole dish rather than the pan it called for so I let it cook a little longer.  It puffed, was brown, looked done,set it on the table to serve it and the inside was still runny as could be.  It ended up taking almost an hour to get done. I will compare my other recipe to this one and maybe try it when I find it but will not make this again-apples and eggs do not go well with this family.

My nine year old got to take the first bite and I heard her shout,"this is soooo good!" That told me it was a success! I read some of the reviews and went by what a few people said, I reduced the milk to 1 cup, I also used only 1/2cup of all-purpose flour and added 1/2 cup of whole wheat pastry flour to make it a little more healthy. I substituted Stevia sweetener for the sugar for health purposes, and increased the cinnamon to 1/2tsp because we love cinnamon. This kind of reminded me of a caramelized apple upside down cake i make for Thanksgiving and I decided to caramelize the apples in the butter and brown sugar and drizzled a little honey over it and let that simmer on low heat for a couple minutes and flipped the apples over and let them finish caramelizing for a couple more minutes. I didn't have a 9x9in square pan so I just used a 9inch pie plate. I sprayed it with cooking spray first, thank goodness I did, poured the apples on the bottom and then poured the batter on top. I had to cook it for 23 minutes for it to get done all the way and it was beautiful when it came out. We loved it, didn't even need to put syrup on it. I will definitely make this again using my tweaks. Yummy and healthy, can't beat that!

Very dissapointed with the Apple Puff Pancake!  Perhaps this recipe should be re-evaluated. Possible ingredient errors: too much egg and/or insufficient flour. Result...definitely mushy, custerd-like texture, flat and tasteless. I would have liked to have seen as well as tasted a more spongy and sweet pancake. Overall, no positve feedback.

Thanks,
E.

This was a lot more dense than the traditional puffed apple pancake recipe I usually make from a recipe from my husband's grandmother. Not as good as grandma's recipe, but still good. It makes a pretty big pan and is extremely filling. Like some of the other reviewers mentioned, I also mixed the brown sugar into the apples at the bottom of the pan which gave it a nice caramel coating. Make sure you are hungry when you make it!

So delightful!  Not too sweet, but sweet enough that I ate about six servings!  Wow!  So moist.  If you like eggy pancakes, this is a great fluffy flavorful one!  I sprinkled brown sugar lightly over the top.  It didn't need anything on it.  It reminded me a bit of my mom's "Impossible Pie" that forms its own crust while baking.  This isn't quite a crust, but it gets thicker at the bottom of the pan which adds wonderful texture.  I will make this regularly!

This was only O.K. Tasted like an egg custard rather than a puff pancake. Ended up throwing away after one setting because nobody else would eat any leftovers the 2nd time.

This kind of pancake was good with apples, but this recipe has too much milk.  I didn't understand what some of the reviewers meant about it having a custard-like texture, and since I like custard, I thought I'd try it anyway.  In the end, the correct description for the texture is mushy and odd.  Most other recipes for puff pancakes use 1 cup of milk with the same (or similar) amount of eggs and flour, so simply reducing the milk to 1 cup should take care of the problem.    Even so, I'll stick with another recipe for puff pancakes and add the apples myself.

This has become one of my favorite meals to make for brunch. It is very unique and everyone always gets excited about! I will also make it with blueberry pie filling instead of apple.

After reading the reviews, I cut back the milk to 1 1/4 cup, and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and sprinkled a smidgeon of cinnamon on the apples before I poured the batter.  I’m so glad I did because the flavor was perfect.  I made this in a ten inch casserole dish and needed to add an additional 15 minutes to the baking time.  This recipe made for a wonderful Sunday morning fall breakfast.

Pretty good recipe. I followed the directions exactly as written and it turned out fine.  I have a similar recipe from a Crisco cookbook that I like a lot better. You partially cook the apples first and it has more flavor. But I like to try new ones, just in case. Thanks!

Great recipe! This is a classic and one that lends itself well to any number of variations. We make a version of the puff pancake in individual ramekins. This is a quick and easy weekend morning treat!  Cheers,  Steve & Jason

AMAZING!!! I used the Claire's changes and it was a huge hit. (Plus I changed the eggs to 4 eggs and 4 egg whites) Light and fluffy yet just sweet enough.

It was good, but didn't taste as I had anticipated. Very, very egg-like flavor. Could use more cinnamon, and honestly it would probably taste a lot better with some syrup on it like a regular pancake. (Followed the recipe exactly as shown).

I have never made a puff pancake before, or eaten one.  I made it exactly like the recipe but three of the eggs I used were duck eggs.  When I took it out of the oven the first time it looked too runny so I left it in for 10 minutes more.  It still seemed not quite done and when I tried to dish it up the egg in the middle gushed out to fill in the hole where the spoon had been.  We were able to eat the extreme corners and I put it back in the oven probably for about 20 more minutes which made the cooking time about doubled.  When I finally took it out it was really yummy, especially the apples with the brown sugar.  I wish the original recipe would have been correct.  I would probably add more flour and cook it in a bigger pan.  Usually the duck eggs don't make a big difference, so I don't think that affected the recipe very much.  I would think a puff pancake would have some pancake characteristics.  It seemed like an egg bake.

I've tried making a few different apple puff pancakes and this is the best one yet.  I think other recipes are too eggy in flavor but this one has a nice balanced sweetness and the brown sugar topping caramelizes nicely to provide a light, sweet crunch on top too.  Great recipe!

I agree with others about taking longer for the middle to cook.  Either use a larger pan or cook for 15 mins longer. I made it for dinner and served it with fried potatoes and bacon.  A nice treat,  no leftovers.

I loved this recipe... easy to make in the morning which is always good. Although I dont know how you would do it in a 9x9 or round... it filled me 9x13! I added 1/3 cup of flour (i dont know if that made a difference) and 1 tsp of sugar... i was making it for a crowd of sweet tooths. And i also added the brown sugar to the apples and cooked them for 10 min as Carie suggested--turned out wonderful.

SO YUMMY!  We love German (Puff) Pancakes at our house and with a couple of apples hiding in the crisper, I just had to make it.  I followed this recipe, using the changes that Caire suggested, I only used 1 cup of milk (which if normally what I use when making German Pancakes.  It was fantastic -- warm and custardy and appley.  With salty bacon and cold milk, it's a great Brinner (breakfast for dinner) meal.

This reminds me of bread pudding. I thought it would be more cake like because of the name. I topped with honey because it needed some flavor. I also had to cook another 15 minuntes at 350 degrees because the center was liquid. Even then the center piece still has liquid on top. This would make a great dessert with a scoop of ice cream

I made this for my husband and our friend for breakfast and it was delicious. I added nutmeg and used brown sugar rather than white in the batter.

The apple puff pancake tasted delicious.  My husband, however, didn't like the custard like aspect to it - the "egginess" that everyone else commented on.  He thought that the egginess of it was bland.  But, that was my favorite part.  I would make it again, but I might try using less eggs to make my husband happy.  Also, I only made half the recipe and it filled 3/4 of my 9X9 Pyrex dish.

There were quite a few eggs in this recipe which made it a little less "puff" than I was expecting. I would maybe cute the eggs to 4-I still need to play with the adjustments. The brown sugar and apples were great in the morning though!

I have made this several times with different recipes.  I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to improvise and my son and I ate the whole thing.  We did cut all ing. in half.  What I do is cook my apples in butter and sugar to heat up the pan as well before it goes in the oven.  I had to use half and half (had no milk).  After blending the rest of the ingredients I poured them into the hot pan and let that liquid heat up just a few minutes.  Into the oven at 415.  A few minutes before I took it out I put melted butter over the top to get a brown color and a crispy crust which we both like.  It raised like a champ!  I would have taken a picture but we ate it all!  Thats why it got 5 well deserved stars!

Four stars rather than five simply because I modified it slightly (using more apples and tossing them with some cinnamon and nutmeg before layering them in the pan - some of Caire's suggestions).  I baked this in a deep, 9-inch pie pan which was the perfect size and made for a nice presentation. (Photo posted)  The final product was a custard-like bottom layer with a layer of apples (they rise to the top) on top and a soft, bread-like crust.  It was delicious.

I loved this recipe!!  I did the changes that Caire made. To make it a bit lighter I made it with 6 egg whites, and 3 whole eggs.  After all the ingredients weree together I beat them a while longer as well.  The end result was a well baked egg pancake with a warm cin, nutmeg flavor.  My whole family loved it!!

The texture of this Apple Puff reminded me quite a bit of the pancakes my German grandmother made.  I'm giving the recipe a 5 even though I made a few changes because I liked it a lot and it's much easier than making individual pancakes. I sauteed the apples briefly in a skillet before layering them in the baking dish.  I added cinnamon to the egg batter and sprinkled the top of the puff with white sugar and cinnamon after I spooned the individual serving on the plate. I scaled the recipe to 3 servings (2 eggs) and ate the whole thing!

This was good. Will be making again. It is def. more of a baked custard than a pancake. There is a discrepency in cooking time. The top of the page (under the prep part) says 30 min while the recipe says 20. Go with the 30 min. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that I had to add extra cinnamon. It seemed a little bland as is. Still we all liked it.

This is not that good. Too egg-y. I cut the recipe in half and it puffed to 3/4 of a 9x9 pan. I don't see how a full recipe would work at all. There is a much better recipe out there that calls for pouring a batter over melted butter, topping that with thinly sliced microwaved apples and then sprinkling it with cinnamon sugar. It is fabulous. Our guests have all loved it. Great with peaches also.

This turned out great for me but was better the first day than as leftovers the next. I used 2-3 cups of dries apple slices that I have in my food storage instead of fresh apples. I think that might be the key to keeping from being soggy.

This recipe definitely didn't turn out as expected. Instead of a pancake like texture it came out more like panakuken (eggy and custard like). I baked it for 20 minutes as instructed but when I took it out of the oven it was still soupy. I ended up baking it for 50 minutes total and it turned out fine. If I were to make this again I would probably add more cinnamon, more apples, and only use 1 cup of milk instead of 1 1/2.

Very eggy! We have a smaller Japanese convection oven so I used the oven broiling pan instead of a 9 x 13 pan.  The apples cooked nicely, but the consistency was more like an apple omelet than a pancake it seemed.  Hubby eats seconds and thirds, but not with this recipe.  I don't forsee saving the leftovers.

I used all ingredients as provided, substituting 1 and 1/2 C plain nonfat yogurt, adding 1/4 tsp Nutmeg, and I didn't bother to peel the apples (Macintosh), nor did I top with brown sugar. Melted the butter in the largest of my cast iron frying pans... when the oven had preheated, there was smoke billowing out. I decided to throw down the sliced apples, leaving the oven open while I poured on the batter. 20 minutes later, drizzled with a little whipping cream and Vermont Maple Syrup, my husband and I ate fully 1/2 of the Apple Puff Pancake. It was AMAZING... no burnt taste, texture akin to a french toast that was drenched with egg. THANK you for sharing this recipe. I have filed it and will DEFINITELY be using it again. Laura

Sorry wouldn't make it again. Suggest taking people's ideas in the reviews. I'm a stickler with making "as is" the first time, but the consistency of this dish just isn't worth trying out alternatives.  Kids liked it.

I guess you shouldnt have named this a cake. If you have ever been to the original house of pancakes this is describing "the big apple" I have made this before but modifies alittle only taking butter,double cinnamon and brown sugar and add a tablespoon of regular sugar and roll apples in that and bake for 10 min then add egg mixture. end result will look like cake but quickly deflate . cover with powdered sugar and enjoy!

Fast and easy. My baby daughter loves it. Be careful scaling the recipe. I made the mistake of scaling it down and then using too big of pan.

before I begin, I apologize for not following the recipe this frustrates me, so it's not really a fair rating but I used the recipe as a guide to make it healthier one, not that this one is necessarily unhealthy I just wanted to make it match my diet. my guess is the original recipe is probably very good as well. so here are my changes: 

 1. I used 3 eggs + 9 tablespoons of carton egg whites.

 2. I used unsweetened almond milk instead of the regular milk

3. instead of using the sugar and brown sugar I use my own blend of stevia and erythritol and then I drizzled the top with about 1/2 teaspoon of molasses to give it the brown sugar flavor

4. I used sprouted wheat flour.

that being said , and this may be my fault for the different ingredients, but I did have to bake it about 50 minutes instead of the 20 because the egg did not set up but the results we're like a baked French toast. I really liked this!

my only thing that I would change would be to cook the apples before hand, they were still crunchy but that may also be my fault for using crunchy apples to start with.

with my changes the nutrition info is
128 calories per serving
5 grams of fat
12 net carbs
6 grams of protein

I topped this with sugar free maple syrup and it was wonderful!

Thanks for sharing!!

I usually make a more complicated German Oven Puff Pancake and was looking for a quick fix this morning. Loved the fact you just put apples in oven, verses cooking on stovetop. I found the apples floated to the top, as someone else mentioned but I diced up the apples vs slicing them in larger chunks. I liked seeing the apples, as this is how it should be. The apples were al dente which was enjoyed. Pancake puffed up beautifully. I added a considerable amount of cook time. I followed recipe exactly otherwise. Will make it again!

Overall the flavor on this is wonderful. For some reason, it always comes out with a slightly wet bottom. If I bake it longer, the top burns. But the taste is wonderful! I usually sprinkle a little cinnamon/sugar mixture over the top to give it a little color and extra flavor.

Runny. Had to bake for an additional 15 minutes and still had liquid sitting on top. Very “eggy”.

This has been a family favorite since 1980. I use 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) and make it in a 9x13 pan so it doesn't overflow. My mother-in-law used to can apple slice with cinnamon candies only to be used for this dish. Allrecipes is a wonderfull site to use when I'm traveling & showing grandkids how to make family staples.

Calling this a pancake is definitely a misnomer.  It would be more accurate to call it a baked apple custard. We made the recipe exactly as written (otherwise how do you give an accurate review?) and even though it wasn't what we expected it was still a success. My daughter loved it.

I made it in 8x8 dish, since that's all I had. Won't do that again! Had to cook way too long. Very tasty. My son rated it 5 stars! I also the in some cranberries. Tis the season! Next time I'll try following some other reviewer's advice.

Delicious! This is essentially a German pancake with apples. I baked the apples for a few minutes to soften them up before adding the egg mixture.  I have made it twice since finding the recipe about a month ago.

Reduced milk to one cup, added 1 tsp baking powder.  Sauteed apples in butter with 1/4 C brown sugar before adding batter, then finished as per recipe.  This gave a lighter, more bready consistency when baked.  Recipe as written yields a somewhat custardy texture.  Still delicious.  This is a family fave!

Just made this and the family is devouring it!  It is delicious!  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is,  this is not a 20 minute cook time dish.  by the time i got it out of the oven,  it was liquid in the center still.  They were all so hungry i had to cut the slices and microwave it the rest of the way!  I changed it up a little with putting cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder and allspice in the batter, and I sprinkled cinnamon on the apples too.  The family is loving it!  Just cook it about 45 minutes.

My family loved this!! 
It's an easy recipe with on hand ingredients. Good recipe for kids to help with.  My son & I made this a few times last week with apples from our apple tree (I don't know what kind).
*1st time made it exactly the way listed  except a slightly bigger pan. Tasted really good. We thought it came out like a firm custard texture & kind of thick. I used 3 med-lg apples & thought it needed more.
*2nd time I used reviewer's suggestions
I added 1/4 tsp allspice w/the cinnamon & mixed in with the apples & let them sit  while the butter melted in a 2qt glass rectangle dish. Then I put apples in dish & cooked them "until they sizzled" like a reviewer said. Then added the batter & baked per recipe directions.
Again delicious!! We are making another batch tomorrow. Bigger baking dish & 4 lg apples sliced is what we liked best.
Thanks for the recipe!!

I followed the recipe and even let it sit in oven 15 minutes longer but it did not puff as the name says.  Instead it became more like a bread pudding which I'm not a fan of.

This is exactly like Bickfords Big Apple pancake.  I made this true to the recipe.   I love eating this cold with maple syrup!  I did need an extra 10 minutes cooking time.

I like the taste of this, and I might make it again.  The apples and the cinnamon give it a wonderful taste.  But the consistency is much more eggy than I expected.  It was something between an undercooked pancake and a thick omelet, if that makes sense.

This is more of a clautifous, a custard with fruit in it that has flour to make it have the body of a custard pie.  That said, I loved it.  I am on weightwatchers . I don't do much sugar or fat.  Happily only the milk, flour and brown sugar counted for  points!  

We are also only two people in my house, and don't eat much of this kind of stuff, so I cut the recipe in half, used no white sugar, and used two ramekins (like you use to make rigatoni in).  I sprayed the two ramekins with pam (zero points) instead of using butter.  
I generously covered the bottom of the ramekins with chopped apples (zero points) in the bottom of the ramekins,  sprayed the apples with pam, and covered the apples with the batter, then sprinkled  both the ramekins with a scant tablespoon of brown sugar (three points), set the ramekins on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and cooked for  20 minutes, just like the recipe says, and served them with sides of turkey bacon.  Excellent use of the plethora of apples my tree pumps out this time of  year - I t made two generous servings. it rose nicely, was fast, easy and delicious, with a satisfying texture, and even though it felt like I was cheating, it is not high points!

I used white wheat flour, buttermilk, brown sugar in the mix ,1 Granny Smith and 1 gala Apple. I melted the butter in a cast iron skillet. I layered the pan with the apples and let them cook in the oven for 10 minuets before I added the batter. I covered the pancake for the last five minutes of baking.

Other than using whole flour, I made it as directed.  My results did not look anything like the photo shown.    Also I had to add 10 minutes to the baking time.   At 20 mins, the contents was still very loose and 'watery' looking.  I peeled 2 apples but could fit only 1.5 apples slices into the 9x9 pan.    The taste wasn't bad, but rather than topping with brown sugar prior to baking, I'm thinking that sprinkling confectioners sugar on top after baking.   I will try again but will make it in a round pan and make a few other adjustments.

This was delicious!  The apples were still crisp so I will precook them a bit next time and add more cinnamon and vanilla.  I will also try mixing the batter in my blender like I do for Dutch Baby Pancakes.

This gets 5 stars for flavor (I went for seconds) but 1 star for description and timing. It is definitely a custard. Not as loose as a flan, but a thick custard. Also, 20 minutes is way off. As others mentioned, it took more like 40-45 minutes to cook all the way through. The apples did fall off as it rose, so use a deeper pan or use a bigger pan and just watch it for done-ness. All that said, it does turn out super delicious as a custard dish and I will make it again.

I made a few changes as suggested by Caire [cooking the apples first in butter (I used only 3T) and adding the sugar and spices just after, as well as the oven temp and cooking time]. It came out beautifully eggy! I did this as a test run for myself as I had all of the ingredients on hand. Next time I make it, I will definitely be sharing with company. I do think it would taste lovely with a slightly sweet whipped fresh cream.  The pancake itself isn’t as sweet as all that.

I didn't love this recipe at all.  Maybe I did something wrong but I used a kitchen aid mixer to blend the batter and even then it was very dense and 20 minutes did not soften the apples adequately. I would not make again.

Looked not too bad, but it ended there. It waz not 'pancake-like'  at  all...more liked baked omelette with sliced apples on top.  The ratio of 6 eggs to 1 cup flour seems to be a problem.....it has now been chucked in the bin....what a waste of apples and eggs

I added ground ginger,& more cinnamon than called for. I Used coconut sugar, instead of cane sugar, and for the eggs , I substituted  chia seeds mixed w water.(vegan eggs) . Baked a little longer than called for as well. Then, drizzled ...  Smuckers, salted caramel topping. Yum!! ??

Love this idea however the pancake part was very dense, thick & tasteless overpowering the delicious apple cinnamon sugar topping. I would suggest reducing the number of eggs to get more of a pancake batter. Overall the flavors were great. No one in my family ate it :(

I made this recipe according to specification with one minor change, I reduced milk to 1.25 cups.  It did require more time to cook than specified:  For me about 37 minutes.  The recipe was quite good but not really 'pancake' consistency.  Rather, I'd liken the dish to something like a clafoutis.  Still very good.  I may make again but I'm looking for something more pancake like.

I've made "Puffy Pancakes" for many years and this recipe needs to be baked in 2 pie plates for about 15 mins. for it to be done.  It's more of a bread pudding consistency even after baking for 30 mins.

Cooking time is totally off! As seen in the picture, I used a fluted round pan. After 20 minutes I could tell it was still liquid in the center. Added 10 minutes. Still not done! Added 10 more minutes. Turned the heat down to 350 and continued to bake.
The apples came to the top and starting falling off the top into the oven. After 45 min. It was done.  I also left the white sugar out of the mix and put the brown sugar in the egg mix.  
After all that, it tasted delicious! Served with lemon squeezes and  sugar- cimmamon sprinkled on top. It would never fit in a 9x9 square pan, as stated in the recipe!

This was excellent, however it took 40 minutes to cook, not 20. I had to keep putting it back in for 10 minute increments. Maybe it was the apples I used? I cooked it in the square pan as directed but next time I will use a round pie dish like the photo. Excellent flavor!

This is an easy recipe and uses ingredients that are usually on hand- check!  Like others, I increased the cinnamon and reduced the milk to one cup.  I also had to bake an additional 10 mins.  Next time I will add another apple and increase the sugar and brown sugar.

This is an extravagant yet simple weekend breakfast treat with common ingredients available in most homes. I followed the advise of others who cooked the apples in butter first. Underdoness at the prescribed 30 min baking time is a common issue apparent from the pictures and comments for this recipe. I overcame this by:

1. Caramelize the apple in butter and adding 1 T brown sugar instead of sprinkling brown sugar on top at the end.

2.  Split apple and batter  into 3 Pyrex round containers (4 C size) and bake for 20 mins

The result is both beautiful and delicious. I love the fact that the left over is in a nice compact shape for storage to be enjoyed later.

5 for the taste, 2 stars for the instructions. I don't know how this baked in 20 minutes, unless it was spread out in a baking sheet. It took about 70 minutes when I made it. Also, I increased the temp after the first 30 minutes because it was still soup and had no puff, then decreased once it started to brown and puff.
But the texture was great: crispy in places, smooth and creamy throughout. But I don't think cake is the right description, definitely a custard. We're going to call it morning apple custard. Pretty sure I'll be making it again because the kids and I all thought it was really good.
To make it really pretty dust the top of each serving with icing sugar. I think next time I'll make a caramel sauce to drizzle over it....mmmmm can't wait.  Wonder if a splash of rum in the Carmel sauce or custard would be a step too far?

The picture shows the pancake in a round pan. The directions state a square pan to be used.

I didn't have milk so I used water and added an extra teaspoon of sugar and it turned out better than when I followed the original recipe. I also used almond extract instead of vanilla and it tasted ok.

My family loves it.  The only change I made was to use a convection oven and a bigger dish.  Convect cook 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Cooks perfect.

we really enjoyed this, but I did have to leave it in the oven longer to sett it up all the way in the center.

This is a great breakfast treat or good for a quick supper.  Serve with whipped cream.  I do the apples separately in a skillet on top of the stove as the pancake bakes.  Salute the thinly sliced apples in the sugar, butter and spices until tender.  When taking the pancake from the oven pour the apple mixture into the pancake, cut into slices and serve with whipped cream.

This was so AMAZING!!! My brothers and sisters and parents and even my dog loved it! This is our favorite breakfast meal and excited to eat it again. The only changes we made where to add some frozen blueberries, take out all of the sugars, use coconut oil instead of butter and we also doubled the recipe! :)

Very good - unlike anything any of us have had before.  Custard-like, which we were looking for.  Followed Caire's directions - made in a 13x9 pan, melted 4 tblsp butter first, baked the apples in that for 10 minutes (used 3 apples), then topped with brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg before pouring the milk (a little over 1 cup only, and I used almond milk)/eggs/vanilla/flour/sugar/salt mixture over.  Baked another 35 minutes and it was perfect.  Everyone had seconds.

Tastes good, but more like custard or bread pudding. It took at least 45 minutes to cook. I would put it in a larger, more shallow pan. Honeztly, though, I probably will look for a different recipe that turns out more like a pancake.

Mile High Adjustments: 
Raise Heat to 450 and use convection. May take 35 minutes+, to get a nice rise and  internal temp of 165 F. 
Use straight sided soufflé dish
Grease dish with butter, first, then toss apples with the rest of the butter and ~1/2 tsp cinnamon. 
Use fuji, galla, or eq. And leave out white sugar. 
In the batter: double the cinnamon,  add a pinch of mace, dash of all spice, and a bit of fresh nutmeg.

followed the directions and recipe as printed when my grand daughter who is a junior in college came to visit. We both loved it. I wouldn't change a thing. We both went back for seconds.

I would definitely make this in a larger pan, like 9x13, unless you enjoy thick eggy dough. I sprinkled cinnamon on the apples before adding the batter too. I would make it again, it's good.

This is the perfect breakfast for Saturday mornings. The body of it was like a custard while the apples gave it a great balance of sweetness. I will be making this again.
