5 stars for simple ingredients that contribute to a flavorful pasta dish.  For ease I substituted diced tomatoes for whole peeled tomatoes, added 1/2 cup of white wine, 1/2 tsp of oregano and cut back on the red pepper flakes to 3/4 tsp, brought the mixture to a boil, and then simmered until the sauce thickened and reduced down, around 30 - 40 minutes.  Added the shrimp and scallops to the sauce the last 5 minutes and let the heat cook the seafood (saves an additional pot to clean).  Any type of seafood, mussels, clams, etc., would do well in this dish.  Prior to serving stir in Italian parsley (flat leaf parsley) and 3 tbsp of fresh basil.  Buon Apetito!

This is not the original recipe I used in years past, but it is close.  I recommend the following minor modifications: fresh roma tomatos, not canned--(Blech!) a half cup of diced red pepper strips while sauteing the garlic.  Then a dash of half and half and capers at the end to thicken and give depth and body.  Finally, I grate fresh parmeasean and black pepper at serving time.  This made it much better in my family's opinion.  Sorry, no photos, the diners ate it before I could get out the camera.  They nearly ate it right from the pot on the stove! I served with white bean salad and a bottle of chianti and a hot loaf of foccachia with olive oil and fresh canollis for dolche!

I substituted 28 oz. crushed tomatoes.  Only 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes was spicy enough for us; I think 1 tsp. would have been atomic.  I'd suggest adding a smaller amount of the crushed red pepper flakes to start, tasting it, & then adding the amount that you (& your family) would prefer.  You can always add more seasoning as needed but if it's too much, the recipe could be ruined. Also I just added the scallops & defrosted shrimp to the sauce at the end without cooking them in olive oil first.  I served the dish over half a lb. of whole wheat angel hair pasta. Next time, I'm going to try adding some red wine to the sauce for a little extra flavor.

I've made this 3 or 4 times in the past couple months and it is just the greatest! I also added mussels to mine and this recipe is just so awesome! I also added a little red wine...to die for! My son who goes to college about 4 hours away called me up one day and said, "Mom, I'm coming up tomorrow for the weekend...PLEASE make that spicy mussel stuff!" Of course, he was referring to this recipe. We all loved it! Thanks

This was an excellent , simple to make recipe. I did add a can of Rotelle Habanero diced tomatoes to it because we like things REALLY hot, as well as a pinch of sugar for a little background flavor contrast. I doubled the recipe, and added the cooked al dente pasta to the skillet and tossed with the sauce for several minutes before serving. This allows the flavor to be absorbed into the linguine, as well as topping it with the sauce.

This recipe is a nice base for a diavolo sauce, but the sauce as written in the recipe I would only give 3 starts.  I made the following changes/additions which made it a 5 star, so I averaged it out and gave it 4!   Here are the additions/differences:  I put all 4 TBL of olive oil in the saucepan with 6-8 cloves of garlic(depending on size), but instead of crushing I used a garlic press and just minced it.  I also cut up a red bell pepper in strips and sautéed with the garlic.  I used 2 14.5oz cans of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, oregano in it.  I added 1 TBL of the "Itallian Herb" herb paste that you can buy in the produce section, and 1/4 cup of a Carbernet/Merlot mixed Red Wine, but I am sure any Red wine would be fine. 1 tsp of red pepper flakes was right on for my taste, but if you fear heat you might want to add less to begin with.  I simmered it more like 45 minutes.  Instead of sauteing the seafood, I just added it to the sauce with 10 minutes left in the simmering.  This sauce is very liquidy, and I liked it that way, but if you want it thicker I would advise using less tomato juice or simmering longer.    I think next time I might use fresh Campari Tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes.

Couldn't ask too much more from a recipe! Quick! Easy! Low fat (I reduced the amount of oil and salt I used) thus a great Weight Watcher meal! I add shrimp/scallops/etc. if I have them on hand, but I use this as one of the staple meals to help use up any firm fleshed fish my hubby brings home from fishing trips! I just cut it up in bite sized chunks and it works great for us!

Two words-SIMPLE and GOOD.  I used 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes as someone suggested. I only did 1/2 tsp of red pepper but will increase it next time. If you like alot of sauce on your pasta you may want to double the sauce.

Delicious!  My husband had "3" helpings!  Next time I will omit the salt. The seafood adds enough salt for my taste. I also added 1/2 mussels and cooked them with the shrimp and scallops until they opened.  Yum!

fantastic.  I am Italian and picky when it comes to all Italian cooking and this could not have been better.
I doubled the recipe using 1 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes and on can of fire roasted. I used 1 1b. of med. shrimp, 1/2 lb. of scallops, 1/2 lb. calamari rings and 1 and 1/2 lbs of mussels (which I steamed in advance and put in the sauce in their shells - key). I also amped up the garlic, cut back a little on the salt  and the parsley and added a few splashes of red wine.  Red pepper (2 tsp. for doubled recipe was not too much for my crew. In fact a added a little bit more.) This was served on Christmas eve as a first course and fed about 10 people.  Comments included "best I have ever had."
Thank you so much for this simple wonderful recipe. It's a keeper!

Very good!  Boil the tomatoes for about one minute to remove skins easily.  Did not use scallops.  Love this recipe.

This was really good.  We like things very hot so I added a lot more red pepper and also maybe a 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion in with the garlic.  Will make this again!!

This was amazing!  I did use frozen mussel meat instead of scallops as they are much cheaper and I feel more flavorful as well as adding a splash of red wine and reducing the olive oil.  This is the recipe I have been searching for!

This recipe is delicious and so simple.  I love all the garlic flavor in it.  It was great the next day reheated too.  The only change was I put 1/4 tsp of red pepper instead of a whole tsp.  We're from Minnesota you know and we don't like things too spicy!  Great Recipe!

This was a good recipe but not quite what I was looking for. I used 1.5 lbs of jumbo shrimp and didn't have the scallops but the sauce was nice. It had a good spiciness to it but there wasn't enough tomatoes so I may double the sauce next time.

This is AWESOME! I did make some mods in this recipe however. I think it really improved the taste. I added 5 minced baby carrots, 1/2 stalk celery diced finely, 3 baby sweet peppers also chopped, 1/2 pk cremini mushrooms chopped, fresh oregano, 4 links mild Italian saus-squeezed out of casing-in pieces. I added carrots and celery with the onion then after those softened added peppers and garlic to saute. Next I added my mushrooms. Then I added the sausage. Once browned I also added 3/4 small can tomato paste, about 1/2 c pinot noir red wine and seasons adding the fresh herbs then. I had 1 lg can whole peeled tomatoes and 1 lg can crushed tomatoes, and using the best brand you can find is important. San Marzano's is ideal! So yummy! I broke up the whole toms with my spoon, let it all simmer and finish cooking the sausage at least 40 mins.  When I cooked the shrimp and scallops I added 2 green onions to the pan.  This was superb! The sauce was outstanding! I will always make my sauce this way! I don't know that I will always use the seafood, but either way it's fantastic. The scallops really do give this dish a different, but very good flavor. Thanks!!

Tried this tonight yummy.  I used half the can chipotle peppers and a whole can of tomatoes with chilies. I used a hand blender to make this into a thick sauce.  I followed the recipe and some suggestions and it was wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe and everyone else for your recommendations.

GREAT!  I love this recipe and am a huge fan of spicy foods, so I always add a little more red pepper.  I also double the recipe and freeze it and savor every last bite, even when reheated.  It freezes well in portions and doesn't lose any taste!  Easy and delcious recipe!

This was fantastic! I made it this evening and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I used two jars of tomates that I canned from our garden. I also mixed in a little bit of cornstrach and water (1 tsp) just to thicken it a little bit. The flavor was great, it will be put in the menu rotation. Thanks!!

Delicious! Love the crushed red pepper in this. Like some others, I used canned tomatoes for the convenience. Sprinkled some dried oregano and dried basil in the sauce for flavor as well. When cooking the shrimp, I seasoned it with garlic salt, black pepper, and some cayenne pepper. The dish came out wonderful. Also good with some shredded parmesan right before serving.

The sauce is fantasic "as is".  Everyone raved about it.  Perfect amount of spice and salt.  We made some marinated grilled shrimp skewers, served them on top of linguini and spooned this sauce over the top and it was heaven!!

Even my mom liked this and she doesn't like pasta! Since I like things saucy, I'd double the sauce next time. I made the full 8+ servings of sauce and it was probably enough for 3-4 servings of pasta in my opinion. I also added 1/2 a large onion (should up to 1 full onion), a 1/2 tsp of sugar, a splash of balsamic vinegar (although I'm not sure this did anything), a tiny bit of cayenne (since I was running out of red pepper flakes) and a good amount of black pepper. At the end, I added a handful of spinach (should up to 2 or 3 handfuls) and some parmesan cheese. Yum!

I gave this a 4 out of 5 because I had to change the recipe a little for my taste. I added a can of tomato paste to add more body to the sauce & more flavor. I did not have scallops, so I doubled the amount of shrimp. & I added just a pinch of nutmeg & garlic powder to add even more flavor. After these changes the recipe was great, my DH & I both loved it. I can't imagine eating it as the recipe was originally written, it seems so bland that way & without substance.

I followed the recipe and I didn't like it very much. The taste was really off. I don't know if I will make it again, but if I do, I will definitely add sugar to balance out the acidity.

Really good-next time I'll add more red pepper flakes as we like it spicier. 

Also says it serves 8 but I'd say closer to 6 if you like it saucy (so basically one serving of pasta with 1 1/3 servings of sauce.) I threw in some fresh spinach at the end too which was really yummy. Topped it with a little feta and mmmmmgood!

Excellent recipe-we've been trying to eat healthier but don't want to sacrifice flavor-this is definitely a have your cake and eat it too entree.

As written just OK - there is no way there is enough sauce for 1 pound of pasta, I would start with a half of box.  Needs modifications, but decent.

Great sauce recipe and very easy!  I added more pepper flakes (I love it spicy!) and onions and green peppers.  It added thickness to the sauce that I believe it needed since the tomatoes were not drained.  I will buy diced tomotoes next time, it took more time to cut them up to get the same consistency.  I will also use larger shrimp, the small were slightly swallowed up by the flavor of everything else. This is a great recipe to use with other red sauce recipes where I purchase canned spaghetti sauce.  Taste just like the restaurant!

This was quite delightful...better than it smelled.  I was kind of worried, actually, because I thought it smelled too tomato-y, but it really wasn't.  I did end up adding a lot more red pepper (I started with the single teaspoon...and then probably added another teaspoon or so to the pasta on my plate) and still didn't find it overwhelmingly spicy.  I ended up making a few changes.  Like others, I used a 28 oz. can of tomatoes.  I also used pre-cooked shrimp (because it was on sale) and omitted the parsley (because the store was out).  I'd add the parsley in the future, but it doesn't ruin the dish if you can't.  It's pretty good stuff.

I, too used canned tomatoes (oooh, for shame!) and it tasted GREAT!  My husband had two heaping servings.  I only had scallops so I used them with no shrimp.  I added only 1/4 t red pepper flakes because DH doesn't like spicy.  I also added some other Italian spices (oregano and basil).  Yummy!

This was absolutely fabulous. It was better than local restaurant's Diavolo. As with most every recipe, I read comments and then followed the recipe as best as I could. I did not have whole tomatoes so used 3 cans of diced tomatoes. Other than that I followed the recipe and was very glad I did. It had a certain hotness, but not overpowering, that was great with the seafood. I will add this to my list of special recipes for guests. It was easy enough to fix and tasted out of this world.

Made this again the other night, but for the first time for my boyfriend. Yummy! We ate the whole pot and ended up in a food coma haha. I think the trick is using the seasoned oil as the base of the sauce after the shrimp is cooked.

This was a delicious, very simple recipe.  The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the amount of red pepper asked for in this recipe is too much, even for someone like me who enjoys spicy dishes!  I wish I had listened to another reviewer's advice and cut the amount of red pepper in half.  Otherwise, it was fabulous and I will be making it again, with that adjustment.  I made mine with some sweet Italian sausage and fresh clams, which was a variation on the typical shrimp fra diavolo.

I made this exactly as the recipe is written with the addition of 1/2 cup of white wine.  This was delicious!  We like things spicy and the tsp of red pepper flakes definitely gives this dish kick.  I was able to use fresh tomatoes from my garden.  I will definitely make again.

Great recipe, I used only scallops and added 1/2 cup chopped onions to the garlic and basil to the mixture.  At the end I stirred in 1/4 cup sour cream to make it thicker.  I will definitely make this again!

I have never been been more than a meat a potatoes cook for my family.  I am with a man who is a chef now, who likes spicy!  I have searched many sites for a recipe like this (I love fra diavolo). I have adjusted minor to our own taste, but did not find anything close to this recipe!  I made a surprise dinner one night that have turned into a regular.  WE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!

Very good. I didn't even bother with the scallops, but I am sure they would have only made it better. I did add some Parmesan cheese and fresh black pepper when serving as someone else suggested. Will definitely make again. Super easy!

I really enjoyed this for dinner tonight. My hot spice limit has always been 1/2 tsp. but next time I will up it a bit.  You can taste each and every ingredient both individually and how deliciously they taste combined. Unfortunately I had no scallops, just the shrimp. I'll for sure add them the next time. I like to add my cooked and drained pasta to the sauce rather than have the sauce poured over. The pasta will pick up more of the sauce flavour this way. Thank you marblet.

Ooooooooh YES!!!  This was wonderful!!  I had the most beautiful roma tomatoes that had been given to us by a friend and I used them to make this.  I’m lazy so I didn’t peel my tomatoes and I salted to taste, not using nearly the amount indicated.  I used shrimp only, and instead of parsley I used fresh basil.  I couldn’t resist adding a glug of dry white wine and I thickened the sauce just a little with cornstarch, just enough to give it some nice body.  Hubs grilled the shrimp, but in winter I can see just adding the shrimp to the sauce to cook – why dirty another pan?  Regardless, this one is worth repeating!!!

Was very good! Added some garlic powder and onion powder for extra seasoning.  Next time I might use crushed tomatoes (I ended up cutting the whole tomatoes in quarters anyways). Quick and easy. Enjoy!

I personally do not eat shrimp but I made this for my husband and he loved it.  I did modify it since most said it needed more spices.  I added approximately a tablespoon of Italian seasoning to my tomatoe mixture as well as 1/2 tablespoon or less onion powder.  He loved it!  Thank you...

This was decent.  I made this for my parents and they felt it was too spicy.  If you don't like spicy, you may want to cut the red pepper in half.

This is one of the first things I ever made off this site, and it's still one of my favorites.  As far as the sauce goes, I think this is a good basic tomato sauce.  I find that adding a few pinches of sugar balances out the acidity of the tomatoes quite well and rounds out the flavors.  If you don't want the sweetness, you could use a pinch of baking soda to cut the acidity instead.  Otherwise if your sauce tastes like it's missing something, it probably just needs more salt!  I used large shrimp (because small shrimp gross me out) and slightly undercooked them in the pan so they could finish cooking in the sauce.  I never get tired of this dish!

This was one of the best pasta recipes I have ever had. I like spicy pasta, so next time I would add more crushed red peppers in than what the recipe called for. 
Great with Garlic Bread!

This is a great dish Holly and just the perfect amount of spice for us. I used canned crushed tomatoes as I enjoy a smoother texture to my pasta sauce. Good one and thanks!

This was very good, with a little kick.  A couple friends who do not normally enjoy spicy foods thought this was good.  I used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of chopping whole ones myself--a great timesaver!

I will definitely make this again.

I also added diced tomatoes, but I thought it looked a little watery and I ended up adding a can of tomato paste to thicken it up.  It turned out perfect, but VERY spicy!

My husband whipped this up in no time, with outstanding results! He used 2 cans diced tomatoes to make it quick and easy, and followed the rest of the recipe to a "T".  While I like a little spice, I would prefer slightly less red peppers, but it was still delicious. While he was preparing it, I was worried that the sauce would be too watery, but once it was finished, it was a prefect consistency.  I can't wait for him to make it again!

We will eat this again, it's very good. For me, it was a little too hot - you might want to cut back the red pepper to 1/2 tsp - cook the sauce for a while and taste it to see if you want more. Also, there is no way that this will serve eight people and there is too much pasta for the amount of sauce.
Flavor is very good. It's very easy to make. We really enjoyed it. Next time, I'll saute up some onions and celery to put into it, also.

Excellent!  I didn't have scallops so I used 1 1/2 lbs. of jumbo shrimp.  I will definitely make this again with the only change being to double the sauce.  The pasta soaked up all of the sauce after combining, and felt it became too dry.  Otherwise, this was outstanding!

This is so fabulous and easy!!!   I thought it would be one of those "just ok" dishes, because there are so few ingredients and it is so simple, but I loved it!  The red pepper adds just the right amount of spiciness.  I used canned diced tomatoes with italian seasoning which I think added some extra flavor.  Will definitely make again...thanks!

This recipe is a great start.  I have made a few changes though.  I sauteed a quarter of onion in addition to the garlic.  After adding the tomatoes, I included about 1/2 t of oregano and thyme and just a touch of sugar for sweetness.  You can also add basil at the end if you don't have parsley.

This was a good basic tomato sauce- definitely a try because it is flavorful, however I wasn't as thrilled as I thought I would be from the reviews.  Don't skip out on the parsley addition at the last minute- a definite must.  I am going to try adding mushrooms or something else to the recipe next time as it was missing some kick.  Also, the spice wasn't quite enough for me, so if you like it to be a little more spicy, I would add another 1/2 tspn of the red pepper flakes.

Great simple recipe, but be careful with the red pepper.  I threw in a little too much and had to make more pasta to cool down the sauce enough to eat it.  The flavor was excellent, though.  I used two 7 oz. cans of fresh crab meat and it was wonderful.

Really good but WAY TOO SPICY!!  We normally all like spicy foods but felt the red pepper really overwhelmed the taste.  Will definitely make again but probably only use 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes.

Delicious and so easy!  I've made this many times and it's my go to recipe for shrimp. I love that I have all the ingredients on hand, except the shrimp.  Since fresh tomatoes aren't good year round and canned are often cheaper, I use two cans of salt-free diced and one can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes.  I cut the  red pepper to about 1/4 tsp., add 3 tsp dried oregano, 1/2 cup white wine, and double the shrimp.  I love the flavor of the sauce when its cooked down and my husband always comments on how good it tastes.  Shrimp dishes can be tricky and this one always comes out right!  Thank you for sharing Marbalet!

I suppose it would be 4.5 only because I did make a few very minor adjustments...and people say how can you rate something accurately if you've altered it.  I don't feel my adjustments were major enough although just enhanced just a little for what I know my preferences are...I added maybe 1/4 c of white wine and about 2 tbs of chopped fresh basil to the sauce.  I did choose to use a can of crushed tomatoes like many others and had half a can of diced tomatoes left over so added that-I don't see that altering the flavor. I tasted the sauce after it cooked about 30 minutes and loved it!  My rating is based off that.  I then opted to add maybe 1/4 tsp of sugar to see the difference since some mentioned it. Only because I had a taste for it and to stretch the seafood flavor (couldn't buy scallops but used 3/4 pounds of shrimp) I added a can of minced clams.  That took it to 5 stars for me, but bottom line it's a great recipe and if I ever have fresh tomatoes I may try that way :)

This was very good, especially considering how few ingredients and the ease of preparation. My family doesn't like big chunks of tomatoes so I just dropped the immersion blender into the sauce pan for a few seconds, giving this a bit more interesting texture.   I didn't have any scallops but threw in some frozen tiny langostino instead. I had large tail on shrimp so let those sit in some boiling water for a few minutes and tossed them in at the end so they wouldn't get rubbery. I think any seafood would be great. Added the red wine per other reviewers, a tsp or so of sugar and some italian seasoning. This would be a terrific recipe for last minute guests, too, since I keep these ingredients on hand and it really looks and tastes like a lot more effort than it is. All the kids and hubby commented on the great dinner. Thanks for a new go-to recipe!

Wow I have never gave a review. My family loved loved it. My husband doesn't care for seafood so I just put his in another bowl before adding shrimp/scallops.
  Side note my boys friend was over and ate.. He said he has never sat down as a family to eat beside christmas. He will be eating a lot more. glad he liked it

This was so yummy! Great recepie! My mom and I made it today, and it will become a new weeknight favorite: the seafood can be used frozen and the sauce doesn't need the full 30 minutes. We did increase the garlic to 8 cloves. Wonderful!

This was awesome!  I used can whole tomatoes from Red Gold and I also doubled the sauce recipe. I then also added Mahi that I precooked and cut into chunks (had it this way at Prawnbrokers in Ft. Myers) along with the fresh shrimp and scallops. Added a little extra red pepper and this dish was fantastic!!  Can't wait to make it again soon!!

You really need to double the sauce to make this recipe work. It is also a tad bit bland. Second time I made it I added onion, chopped red bell pepper (bottled), and a ton of fresh herbs (oregeno, basil, etc), and it was a LOT better (almost perfect!). I also added some mussels. Definitely a good "basic" recipe, but needs some help. :(

This could have been a 5-star review if the seasoning (as the recipe is written) would have delivered on the heat I was expecting with this being named "Brother Devil") but because we had to add extra red pepper flakes to even get a little kick on it--it's only 4-stars. Now, for the positives, really delicious, and easy enough I'm putting this in my non-cooking daughter's recipe box I'm building for her as she prepares to move out on her own. Easy enough for every day, but with the right sides (good garlic bread & a nice salad) you've got dinner for company without any sweat!

Good, but I found it to be a bit bland.  Possibly it some onions and basil can be added to increase flavor.  There is definitely not enough sauce for 16 oz. of linguine, which is possibly why I found it bland. Next time I will either double the sauce or use 1/2 the amount of pasta.  I did find this easy and healthy which was a plus.  I will make it again.

This was a tough one to review for me. I really liked it but my husband wasn't a fan, which is a reversal when it comes to seafood with pasta. I would give it 4.5 stars and he'd give it 3, so 4 it is. We used fresh, diced roma tomatoes instead of canned plus a splash of dry vermouth to make up some of the liquid, and Trader Joe's seafood mix instead of just shrimp. 1.5 tsp was way too much salt for us, maybe because of the vermouth? Next time I'll start with 1/2 tsp and go from there. I really liked the flavors and it was the perfect amount of spicy for us. This was great with garlic bread and fresh grated parmesan. I know that diavolo is a thin sauce, which I really enjoy, but next time I'm going to add some tomato paste and see if my husband likes the thicker sauce a bit better. Thanks for a tasty sauce--I think it would be great with sausage instead of seafood too!

Good recipe.  We actually used more red pepper flakes than what the recipe called for because we like spicy food.  I didn't have scallops and didn't want to make an extra trip to the store, so I just used all shrimp.  Thanks for the recipe

I did not feel that the proportions of measurements with (or lack there of) spices had a great result. I prefer my "DEVIL SAUCE" (or gravy) HOT!  This recipe DID NOT present the results... although...very fresh flavoured!

This was fantastic! My husband said it looked and tasted like it was from a top notch restaraunt!  I loved the spicy tangy sauce!  I added extra crushed red pepper and extra garlic of course!  I only used shrimp, but I give this recipe 5 stars!

So good and so easy.  I did cook the seafood in the sauce instead of separately because I wanted to incorporate those flavors, too.  But it added more liquid, so I ended up adding in a can of tomato paste to thicken it up.  Even with my modifications, this was delicious.

This dish was so good! I thought it was too simple but after reading some reviews I decided to make it. Everyone loved it and everything was gone before I knew it! I've made it many times since and have added other seafood such as bay scallops and it's still quite delicious! Thumbs way up from us!

I made this recipe exactly as written and I thought it had just the right amount of spice; however, I did no like how acidic the canned tomatoes seemed.  Perhaps fresh tomatoes would do the trick.  I would make this again but I would change the tomato part of it somehow.

This was delicious. I didn't add scallops because I don't really like them. I added a little balsamic vinegar to the sauce to sweeten and deepen the flavor. My husband and I loved it!

Fantastic!  This was super simple to make and came out great.  The only change I made was omitting the scallops, just doubled up on the shrimp.  I will make this often.

This dish is quick, easy, light, and elegant.  Perfect for a date night on a budget, the most expensive ingredient is the seafood.  I cheated and didn't skin the tomatoes, I just chopped them up and the sauce was very good.  I also left out the parsley because I don't think it's necessary and left out the scallops because of expense.  I used raw shrimp, little extra work while the sauce is cooking and the olive oil gives them a nice flavor.  I made this for my parents and they were very impressed, needless to say they won't be making fun of my college cooking skills again!

Loved this!  It was so easy, and healthy, and my husband couldn't get enough!  My son even liked it....at least the one who likes sea food.  I followed the directions exactly, except I used precooked shrimp, and just threw that in at the end , and I used sea scallops cut in half.  My husband would have preferred it a little hotter, so next time I might add a little more red pepper, but he really likes things very spice.  I will definitely make again!

This dish was very testy, although I do wish the sauce was a little thicker.  I think I will add some tomato sauce or paste next time.  I did add some sauteed, chopped zucchini, reduced the red pepper to 1/4 t., used a pound of shrimp and a pound of bay scallops.  Added a splash of white wine to the scallops when I sauteed them.

I LOVED this! I didn't use big tomatoes I used a ton of grape tomatoes from my garden, I just cut them in half and threw them in! I also threw in some white wine when cooking the shrimp and scallops and I put it in the tomato sauce. I thought this was great.

This is very very good.  I follow the recipe exactly sometimes, and other times I had some penne pasta to the sauce.  Either way it is excellent.

This was delicious!  I used both shrimp & scallops, as well as one can of fire-roasted tomatoes.  I also added Italian seasonings, cayenne pepper, and some dry red wine.  Per another review, I tossed the pasta and sauce and let simmer for a couple minutes before serving.  The colors in this dish made it look like it had come from a fancy Italian restaurant - not my busy household kitchen. This recipe does make a lot of food.  For a date night with my husband, next time I will cut in half.

Must make recipe - whether you stick with it or make variations!  I halved the recipe as it was only for myself and my bf. Added 1/2 lb. store cooked, cleaned & deveined shrimp during the last five minutes or so. Steamed a dozen clams in 1 1/2 tbsp. oil & few squirts of lemon juice, and then added them (juices & all) for the last few minutes also.  As a side note, I used a 14 1/2 oz. can of diced organic tomatoes and found this recipe WAY too salty.  I ended up adding another half can of diced tomatoes, doubled the parsley, added an extra clove of garlic, and some lemon juice to cut down the on saltiness. If your not using fresh tomatoes, it's probably best to add salt to taste and not the specified amount. I also suggest that if your using canned tomatoes, do not go with the petite cut as I think that would have a negative impact on the texture of the sauce.  I'm not big on tomatoe "chunks", so I just mashed the diced tomatoes every so often while it was cooking. And as another side note, I will continue making with the extra tomatoes as otherwise I don't think this would produce enough sauce. This turned out great, and looks great too.

This is a fantastic sauce by itself, and even better with a few changes.  We like things spicy, so I doubled the red pepper, as well as the garlic.  Using canned diced (seasoned) tomatoes makes it quicker on work nights.  I've also added various veggies to the sauce - onions and mushrooms one time, bell peppers and mushroooms another time.  Adding a little red wine never hurts either.  I like to add my seafood directly to the sauce to cook.  Just make sure not to cook your seafood all the way before adding it to the sauce - the heat from the sauce will overcook it otherwise.  If using bay scallops, make sure you don't add them until a minute or two after the shrimp as they will cook much faster.  I prefer to use jumbo scallops though - just put a nice sear on them, and then add them to the sauce shortly before serving.  Served with spaghetti squash and it turned into a very low-carb meal!

This was really good! I used ground cayanne pepper, crushed tomatoes, with one fresh tomato, cut up. A few gourmet sweet and spicy peppers from a jar, and red wine to the sauce. I did not use scallops because I had none on hand, but it was just as good without them.

GOod old fashioned Italian cooking - we loved this dish! The only thing I changed was the amount of red pepper flakes - I used 1/2 tsp instead of a whole tsp so that my kids would eat it. I will absolutely make this again.

Lesson the olive oil by 2 Tbs. Add 10-12 cloves of garlic.  Add fresh basil, add 1/2 Cup fresh parsley, add 1 Tbs Italian Seasoning, and sprinkle some fresh parmesan cheese on top.  Double the recipe.  It's not enough for lunch the next day.

This dish has become one of my most referenced recipes in my personal cookbook!
So simple and is great as a basic sauce that can be built up with other flavors or fantastic all on it's own.
Works perfectly over RICE as well.
I rarely have scallops on hand so I usually just add some extra shrimp. 
Constantly requested by friends and family alike!

Wow! This is a great recipe. Very spicy, very garlicy, a little sauce goes a long way. Even so, I cannot see how this would serve 8 people....we served 3 with this amount of sauce. Next time I'll make more, and will use less oil. Thank you!

This is a great easy version of Fra Diavolo.  I used all shrimp as I could not get scallops.  It was a bit watery but I let the sauce cook down before adding the shrimp.

First of all,I made this to go with the Parmesan Chicken 2 from this website,and it was delicious! I'd love to try it with the scallops and shrimp! I used diced tomatoes that were already seasoned with garlic,basil and olive oil and it was simple and tasted like I slaved for hours!

I'm not a big fan of scallops so i just doubled the shrimp in this recipe.  I also cooked the shrimp with some garlic also. It was a great healthy dinner and i was able to decrease the recipe easily so i could simply make it myself.  I will definatly be eating this again.

All I can say is "WOW".  I made a few minor changes.  I used a 28-oz can of crushed tomatoes with Italian spices, added 1/2 tsp of basil, added 1/2 tsp of sugar, and added 1/4 lb of imitation crab since I had it on hand.  My husband ate 2 large platefuls and said it was the best he's ever had.  Quite a compliment.  I'll definitely make this again.

This dish was excellent. The crushed red pepper is what really makes it great. My husband usually prefers more saucy dishes, but he really liked this one regardless. I cheated and used a 12 oz. frozen bag of shrimp and nixed the scallops. I may try it with some tomato sauce next time though just to get a saucier dish.

Deliciously spicy.  I would increase the amount of tomatoes if using fresh ones.  I also made this one with canned chopped tomatoes and it was great, although not as good as with fresh tomatoes.

This recipe was delicious!  I served it with steamed green beans with cooked almonds and this worked well as a side dish.  My groceries for this recipe were more expensive than I expected - but it was worth it!  I will definitely make this again.

I used a 12 ounce package of frozen, cleaned (but not cooked)shrimp and a 15 ounce can of diced tomatoes with juice. It was simple and had just the right amount of heat. A definite keeper.

This was absolutely delicious, however I will use less red pepper flakes next time because it was a little too spicy for me.

This recipe was good however I personally thought it needed a little suger to sweeten up the sause.  That's just my opinion.  My husband liked it.  My kids had red sauce with their pasta.  I probably would make it again.

Yummy!  We're going to try to make the leftovers into a soup by adding some okra and rice.  Very tasty.  I was a little heavy handed on the red pepper (we like things spicy), so I'm going to be more careful next time (I probably used more than the recipe called for... didn't measure).  I used one can whole tomatoes and one can stewed tomatoes.  Tasted fresh!

This was terrific!  I have been trying to cook more seafood dishes and this was so easy and tasty and my boyfriend loved it!  I did add some onion to the garlic and used crushed tomatoes in puree to make the dish more saucy.  I also sprinkled some feta cheese on top which was great.  Thanks!

My husband absolutely LOVED this dish.  It was pretty easy to prepare and didn't take too much time to cook.  My kids, however, didn't like it - said it was too hot.  Perhaps next time I'll add the red pepper flakes just for my hubby.  Thanks!

I love this recipe.  I used Angel Hair Pasta instead of Linguine.  My family loved the recipe, but next time I will use 1 can of Tomatoes, and 1 can of Tomato Sauce.  I prefer a more saucy flavor that coats the pasta.  I will definetly make this recipe again!

Delicious .. I'd been looking for a recipe and was very pleased to find this one!  I used lobster meat instead of shrimp because of an allergy and doubled the amount of red pepper for added spice.

Really simple and delicious. No need to get fancy with this amazing recipe It is spicy so if you don't like spicy cut back on the red pepper. My boyfriend said he could eat this every  night of the week. I can't wait to make it for family and friends.

DH declared this "outstanding".  I was concerned that there were no "Italian herbs" (basil/oregano).  Need not have worried.  Red pepper & parsley let the seafood flavors come forward.  I used "sea scallops" rather than "bay" as they looked better quality at the fish mongers. We used home grown tomatoes (frozen from last year's harvest) This will be put in the "favorites" list in our recipe log! It was quick, easy,and very, very flavorful!

Delicious stuff!  I made a few minor changes.  Sauteed the garlic in EVOO-added 2 15 oz. cans diced tomatoes-simmer 15 minutes-add shrimp-simmer another 15 minutes.  Done!  Also added red pepper flakes.

This recipe is great!  Just a note to those reducing the crushed red pepper, Fra Diavolo is supposed to be HOT.  Does anyone know where to buy the crushed red pepper without the seeds?

I made just the sauce portion and served it over roasted sausages and linguine, and added a splash of white wine while it simmered; delicious! I used the full teaspoon of pepper and enjoyed it very much.

we liked this recipe a lot!  we used crushed tomatoes.  added pinot to the sauce and used chicken instead of seafood.  in addition to fresh grated parmesan cheese we put a few teaspoons of whole milk ricotta cheese on top, viola, excellent!

Made this recipe with a few reviewer suggested additions: Red wine, fresh basil, fresh tomatoes. Superb. Served it on whole wheat pasta with freshly grated Parmesan. My husband LOVED it. He was disappointed to learn there were no second servings this time.

I subbed about 1/2 cup of organic pasta sauce for some of the tomatoes in the sauce and then I added Herb de Provence. After I sauteed the shrimp, I added them to the sauce, which had been simmering for 30 minutes and also added about 1/2 tablespoon of white truffle oil. I also added bok choy and green onion to the sauce originally. It was STUPENDOUS. Husband left no survivors.

This was very, very good. I would have liked the sauce to be a bit thicker. I used two cans of 28 oz. and lots of shrimp. Next time I'd add some tomato paste. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.

Easy and delish! I modified it by heating extra cloves of garlic and then added 1 large link of SoyRizo (brown it) + 2 fresh quartered vine tomatoes. Cooked the tomatoes down and added the canned peeled tomatoes plus 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes (I love a moderate heat on the tongue). Cooked spaghettini and added the fresh parsley and shrimp per the recipe. This resulted in a thick and hearty sauce - stick to your ribs kind of sauce that worked very well with the thin spaghettini (bonus if you get a nice Italian loaf to sop it up with). Pair this with a crisp Vinho Verde or Dry Riesling and you've got yourself a winner! If it was fall or winter I would have served a nice semi-dry, fruit forward red wine.

I made this with 2-28oz, cans of diced tomatoes. The tomatoes came seasoned with garlic, basil and oregano. I did use fresh parsley and 1/2 of a mined Vidalia onion. Used fresh shrimp and scallops and it was excellent. Using the seasoned tomatoes out of the can made the experience even easier.

Very Tasty.  I used a can of whole plum tomatoes that I had partially pureed, and a can of petite chopped tomatoes, also red wine and oregano.  Served over pasta with thinly sliced parmesan.

Scale back on salt.  I wasn't paying attention, blindly followed the recipe and regretted it later.  Oh, and I only used half the crushed red peppers and it was STILL spicy.  Yikes!

Very Good!  I only put in 1/2 teaspoon of the red pepper flakes per other reviews saying to hot.  I also used a mix bag of seafood which I think gave it a little more of flavor. Will make again.

I made this for my husband and he said it's one of the best things I've ever made. Of course I made some minor changes. Instead of scallop I added turkey smoked sausages. For the sauce, I added some basil, oregano and doubled the chili pepper as we love spicy stuff! I even added 1/2T of balsamic vinegar. I also sauteed the garlic with onions, mushrooms, and green pepper for extra flavor! just delicious!

YUM! This was absolutely amazing. So much flavor, so simple, and made me look like a chef extraordinaire in the household :)  I did omit the scallops, and doubled the shrimp because I am lazy. I used frozen shrimp from the supermarket, also because...I'm lazy.  The amount of heat in the dish was perfect. So delicious! Will definitely be making this again really soon.

I followed the recipe exactly. This is a definite keeper. It reminded me of the days back in college when I used to work as a waiter at an Italian restaurant. One of my favorite items on the menu was Shrimp Fra Diavolo. This recipe must have been what the chef in that restaurant followed.

This is a lovely, yet simple recipe!  I will say that I used crushed tomatoes (simply what I had on hand) and added fresh basil from the garden instead of the parsley. And I only had sea scallops on hand, so I used those after quartering them.  Oh, and took a reviewer's tip and added a sprinkle of capers at the end.  My husband loved it.  By the way, it was NOT too spicy for us, even with the entire amount (1 t) of red pepper flakes added.  Next time, I will try adding a splash of red wine at the end.

Quick, easy and tasty, made just as indicated (except used all scallops instead of combination).  Will make again.

I was skeptical that the sauce would be very flavorful because it seemed too simple but it was delicious.  I used the entire amount of red pepper flakes even though previous reviews suggest to cut back on it.  What can I say, I like it spicy.  I thought it was delicious.  I'm not even a huge seafood fan usually, but I'll definitely be making this again.  Next time I'll double the sauce though because I had tons of pasta left over.

Overall very good.  I will admit to a goof on my part, in that I misread the recipe and added one tablespoon of red pepper flakes instead of one teaspoon.  It obviously came out too hot.  Other than that, however, it was a really nice recipe.

This is good stuff! I loved it.  I like things spicier though, so I think in the future I will increase the amount of red pepper flakes, otherwise it is perfect.  It reminds of my favorite dish at a popular italian restaurant.

Not bad but I thiink it needs a little more flavor.  I added ripe plum tomatoes to the crushed and fresh parsley to the sauce as well at the end and a little kosher salt.

This recipe was GREAT. I didn't have a single leftover. I was afraid as I was cooking that the sauce would be too bland with just tomatoes, garlic, salt and pepper but it wasn't, it cooked up just right. I did, however, add  a little spinach leaves leftover from a previous recipe, Yummy. Difinetly a keeper.

This recipe is good...however the sauce is too thin.  Possibly I will add something to thicken it up next time.  It's very watery.

This was wonderful and easy to make! My sauce was a bit watery probably my fault, so I just add a bit of baking powder to it at the end. Just wonderful wanted to lick my plate afterwards. LOL Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful!!  It was too spicy for my 5-year old, which was surprising since he enjoys spicing.  He tried to eat it but kept choking and coughing.  Next time I might lay off the red pepper flakes a bit!  It was also a bit salty for us, so I'd probably lay off that a bit too.  But overall, it was great and I would definitely make again!

Very good. I used 2 cans petite diced tomatoes for the fresh, and added a can of tomatoe paste because I wanted it a little saucier. I only used one clove of garlic, because my husband is sensitive to garlic and would have been a baby if I put it all in :). Also I used all shrimp. Will most definitely make again and again.

I did follow this recipe closely.  I only changed it up by adding about a tablespoon and a half of chopped onion when I added the shrimp, and 3 tablespoons of red wine. I also cut the red pepper flakes down to about 1/4 tsp + a dash.  The wine really did up the taste, so I do highly recommend that. I enjoyed having some extra texture a  The shrimp and scallops were done perfect and tasted great in the sauce.  I liked having the extra crunch of the onions too.  This was tasty, but not quite 5 star tasty.  It needs a little something more.  Maybe some basil or added veggies to the sauce - green pepper or mushrooms maybe? 
 I will definitely make it again and experiment.  I will also try throwing the shrimp and scallops in the sauce directly and cooking them in the sauce instead of cooking them  separate. That way I can cut down on the amount of dishes used in making this recipe.

Excellent and relatively easy dish to prepare. I will definitely make this again! Please note that this is not a dish for people on a budget. The total cost of the dish was $34! We could have eaten at a restaurant for cheaper.

It is important to use fresh ingredients - we bought all the seafood fresh from fish market (scallops, clams, and huge shrimp) and the veggies from a veggie stand. Really fantastic recipe w/ tons of flavor. Served over angel hair instead of linguine.

Easy and so delicious.  I used a bag of frozen mixed shrimp, calamari and scallops from Trader Joe's, which worked just perfectly.  Very fresh tasting....elicited lots of "mmmmmmmmm's".

Huge hit!  We used Trader Joe's Seafood Blend (calamari, shrimp & scallops)and Garlic & Olive Oil flavored pettit diced tomatoes because it's what we had in the house. Delicious!  Will definitely be making again and again! Great "guest" meal! Impressive.

This recipe is really good...I added the red pepper flakes slowly to get just the right level of spiciness.  I also added Onions and mushrooms to the tomato sauce. And, I put it over whole wheat pasta.  Served it with quick garlic bread and a salad.  Great recipe!

This is possibly one of the best tasting foods I have ever eaten. I made two small changes. I omitted the parsley. That alone improved the taste a thousand percent. Also I don't care for scallops, so I used one pound of shrimp.  I make this recipe at least 3 to 4 times a month. It's that good!

I doubled the recipe, used about 10 tablespoons of minced garlic, 4 cans diced tomatoes w/Italian seasoning, added an additional 1-1/2 lbs. shrimp and sea scallops (halved). Fed 5 hungry adults with enough leftover to feed 4 lucky people the next day.  Really great recipe !

This recipe was a huge hit with my family! The only thing I changed was adding a few shakes of italian seasoning to the sauce. I did everything else exactly as the recipe called for. It was delicious! Also, it wasn't hard at all! The preparation/cooking time look deceivingly long, but remember that 30 min. of that is spent simmering the sauce!

My family, friends, and I really liked this recipe. If you don't like spicy use less then the recommended red pepper. But it was really good. Loved it. We will have it again.

Really good sauce recipe.  I didn't have scallops so used bag of cleaned and cooked frozen shrimp and was delicious.  Can adjust spiceness to any level.

I've been looking for a simple fra diavolo recipe similar to the ones served in my hometown. This came out great! It was exactly what I had in mind. The whole family liked it. I only used shrimp and cut the crushed red pepper to 1/2 tsp. This is a keeper!

This was easy, quick and made a nice presentation.  I was a little hesitant to add 6 cloves of garlic, but I did and it was surprisingly not overly garlicy tasting.  I will make this again.

Great recipe! If you are looking for a switch up from your normal pasta dish - try this!  It's got a spicy kick but not too much.  I made it with caned diced tomatoes and 1/4 cup red wine.  Will make it again!

Made this for my boyfriend because he loves spicy food and he loved it.  We didn't simmer the sauce for the time specified because we were soo hungry, but we still got the spicy hotness.  I didn't use as much red pepper flake as mentioned either and it was still quite spicy.  I also only used shrimp, no scallops.  Very good recipe, thanks for sharing.

***A*W*E*S*O*M*E***  I followed the recipe exactly except for the Scallions, didn't have any, and It came out supurb.  My 3 year old woke up the next morning and asked for it for breakfast!!  ha ha!  I will never make "Spaghetti" again, this will be our new pasta dish.  We thought it was the perfect amount of red peppers.... (hint, if you don't like spicy foods don't put so much in!) THANK YOU for sharing this amazing recipe.

I'm not a fan of seafood, so I made this solely for my family.  I had no idea what it was before I made it and found it to be extremely easy to make, but was somewhat disappointed in the presentation of it.  Looked exactly like spaghetti only with shrimp and scallops, but everyone enjoyed it, so I guess that's what matters!!

I followed the recipe to the tee, just added a little more crushed red pepper to taste. It was "OK", but I wouldn't make it again. The sauce was very "WATERY" it didn't stick to the pasta at all... if I knew this in advance I would have altered the suace's density.

So good and easy. Not too spicy for me or my husband. I used canned tomatoes and a lot less pasta. I also didn't have scallops so I doubled the shrimp. I used only 1 tsp of salt which was still a little too much. Next time I'll probably double the sauce, we love tomatoes! I will also be sure to get some scallops.

Declicious! however, When I made it the second time, I put in 2 cups of white cooking wine and 2 14.5 oz cans of delmonte diced tomatoes instead of the olive oil and the tomatoes the recipe called for.  served with 12 oz of whole wheat spaghetti! it was amazing! Oh i used shrimp and scallops and mushrooms!

This was restaurant quality. It tasted the same (or better!) as our favorite restraunt in the Italian Market section of Philly makes.  To save time, I used diced tomatoes as other reviewers noted.  I also used hot peppers my grandmother made which gave it the perfect "kick".  I did not have scallops on hand so I used 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp.  I also added basil.  It was very flavorful unlike some of the bland versions I've tried.  My husband could not stop eating it.  Thanks Holly!

Very simple and delicious recipe. The tomato sauce is really what makes it and gives the rest of the dish its zing. I added double the scallops but it still wasn't enough for all the pasta so next time I don't think I'll cook so much pasta as the recipe says.

This was a very good meal.  Quite different from what we are used to and a nice way to use shrimp & scallops together.  I only used 1/2 the pasta, but feel that we should have used all of the canned tomatoes (2 cans), it needed a bit more sauce.  We also didn't use so much red pepper flakes.  I can't do too much heat.  But, all in all, this was very very good.  Worth making again.

I substituted the three cups of chopped tomatoes for 1 15oz can stewed tomatoes--ran thru the food processor to coarsely chop and 1 15 oz can of tomato sauce. I also used 1/2 the red pepper and added 1 tsp old bay seasoning-to add back flavor without adding more heat.  Turned out great! I had never made a red sauce with seafood -always white or butter/wine.  It was a nice, healthier change.  Thanks.

This was an excellent and easy recipe.  I was wary because there aren't many seasonings, but the garlic and pepper produced a wonderful flavour.  I used all shrimp (tiger prawns) and added a tablespoon of capers to the sauce, as someone suggested.  I also sprinkled a bit of feta cheese on top of each serving.  Yummy!  We felt like were dining in a fine restaurant.  I recommend mixing the cooked pasta with the sauce before serving.

A very good recipe - I personally used more spices than the recipe calls for because it didn't have a lot of flavor, but plenty of heat.  But my boyfriend loved it - I will definately make again.  Thanks!

pretty good dish! I only used 1/4 tsp of red pepper-it was a good amount of spice! Lookin for a more "saucy" dish.  Maybe next time I'll add a bit of spag sauce or something! I also used diced tomatoes with garlic and onion instead of the tom the recipe calls for.  But good valentines dish~

Saturday is "Pasta Night" in our home; I first tried this recipe about a year ago and fra diavlo sauce immediately entered the regular sauce rotation. Variations we use include substituting stewed tomatoes for the whole tomatoes and/or substituting sauteed beef smoked sausage cut into bite size pieces for the fish. This fra diavlo sauce recipe has never disappointed my family and friends.

I can't believe that I hadn't rated this recipe after making it a dozen times.  Simple, delicious, and always gets great reviews.  Makes a great last-minute company dish.  I do decrease the pepper just a little and add just a tad bit more garlic. MMMMMM!

Fantastic!!!  Great flavor and so easy to make.  The whole family enjoyed it.  I used pre-cooked frozen shrimp and scallops.  Definitely cook in separate sauce pan before adding seafood to sauce...the frozen seafood releases a lot of water when cooked.

This is almost identical to the shrimp stir-fry with asparagus and noodles and tasted just as excellent.  I followed the recipe as is, except I sub. cilantro for the parsley and added some asparagus to the dish.  I also wanted more sauce, so I added a bit of chicken broth.  Everyone said this was tasty.

I used three cans of diced tomatoes with seasoning and 9 garlic cloves.  Without all of the additional seasoning, it would have been bland.  With the above method, it was full of flavor and a hit!  It taste better the second day!

This recipe is excellent and super easy!  The red pepper flakes add just the right amount of spice to the dish.  I made it for my husband and I and we both absolutely loved it.  I made it with the scallops and shrimp but you could add other seafood to it as well.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I've been trying to find a great recipe for this, its my husbands favorite dinner. I suprised him for Valentines Day me not being a seafood lover he thought he'd never get a meal like this at home. His praise and thanks was so overwhelming I have no problem making this over and over for him. Only difference is I ommitted the bay scallops, and had to add more red pepper flakes to zest up but overall great!!! (MY husband tells me)

Great when red pepper flakes reduced to 1/2 tsp or less.  Using canned tomatoes pieces with garlic worked fine and saved time.

Unbelivable!  Yummy and very easy.  I used shrimp only 16oz and it was great.  Next time (which will be soon I'm sure) I will use less salt and I was heavy on the red pepper and it was a tad too spicy.  I will stick to the 1tsp that the recipe calls.  Thanks Holly I'm adding it to my family favorites!

Excellent for a quick weeknight dinner. Both my husband and I like our dishes a bit spicy, so besides adding the red pepper flakes, I also added some Emeril's essence when I sauted the shrimp. I omitted the scallops but the dish did not miss them. And I added a bit less garlic. Overall an excellent delicious dish.

This came out great.  I fooled my significant other into thinking I could cook!  I love ordering this at restaurants, and now I can cook it at home.  Next time I think we will only use 4 cloves of garlic though.

I did scale it down to 2 servings. The garlic was a little over powering, I will just cut about 1/3 of the garlic next time but overall it was a very good dish.

This is a good base recipe, and I used it to build what I was looking for. Added chopped onion, basil and oregano, zucchini and peppers, and a splash of red wine (I used the cooking wine as we rarely drink). Omitted salt as there is lots in the tomato products. I used canned Marzano type and some red pepper stewed tomatoes as fresh is pretty expensive where I live. A definite great choice for the menu rotation!

This was another fabulous pasta dish. I did use medium shrimp since I couldn't find any small shrimp. I didn't see red pepper flakes mentioned in the directions, so I skipped it. Why is it listed there? I also use one skillet to cook the sauce and the seafood. I also passed on the parsley too. I would make it again.

Made this for a birthday dinner and used shrimp & scallops.  It was very good but deducted 2 stars because the measurement on the hot pepper flakes was so high in the written recipe.  We love spicy and I only used 1/4 tsp. which was more than enough, anymore and the spice would have overwhelmed the delicate flavors of the seafood.  Thank you for sharing your recipe....

Tried this recipe for my husband. He fell in love with this dish at an Italian restaurant we used to frequently visit  years ago. He says it tastes just as good as he remembers. Only change I would make is I might add just a pinch more red pepper to give a little more heat. Great recipe and it was very easy!

1.  Double the garlic
2.  Use about 1 additional cup of the canned SM tomatoes (whole peeled tomatoes that I chop).  Can use two of the smaller cans.
3. I use 1-1.5 pounds of scallops and 2/3 pound of shrimp.  
4. Top with Pecorino Romano cheese.
5.  Amazing

I’ll give 5 stars with my adjustments. I used 3 cups fresh peeled Roma tomatoes. I started with the garlic and also added cup of mushrooms. Cook that down a little then add tomatoes and I used a small can of tomato paste. Once that cooks a few minutes I added about 1/2 cup white wine and crushed red peppers. We love spice so I added 3 tsp of red peppers, we want our tongue to burn! I let that cook down for about 20-30 mins. I started the pasta and dried out the shrimp with paper towels. Once most of the water was gone from the shrimp, I seasoned the shrimp with cayenne pepper and salt.  I added the shrimp to the sauce and allowed to cook. Once the pasta had cooked for 5 mins, I added a splash of heavy cream and oregano to the sauce. I let that cook down until pasta was done and added the parsley. It was spicy and delicious!

Excellent!!  I had to leave out the scallops because my husband is allergic to them, but this is a 5-star dish even with just shrimp.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Although I did not eat this, due to an inability to eat spicy food, my family and a friend raved about how good it is was.   I used a large can of  diced tomatoes to save time!

I've been looking for a flavorful pasta sauce without having to add meat.  This is it.  I need low sodium recipes, so cut salt in half and family tastes dictate less red pepper

I wish I had read the comments before making this!
I usually enjoy a good kick but I followed the recipe to a T and it was way too spicy for me. 
Next time, I'll cut back on the crushed red pepper and try a little red wine. 
Overall, this was easy and not too far from what I've had in restaurants.
I will try this again with modifications.

It was great! Added more garlic, red pepper flakes and Old Bay Seasoning (instead of salt). Also added fresh basil and oregano.

I don't use any scallops, just shrimp.   I would definitely recommend using San Marzano tomatoes for the sauce.  I also just mince and add the garlic.  Great recipe!

I didn't have any scallops, so used 1 lb of shrimp. Substituted 29 oz of diced tomatoes. I served it on rotini pasta, but would use a different pasta next time. Also, it was calling out for the pan to be deglazed after cooking the shrimp!

First time I made this without scallops cuz they didn't have any at the store and I used zucchini noodles and no red pepper. Tasted great! Second time, used scallops and red pepper with linguini, and it was super yummy. I like spicy, but I will use only 1/2 tsp. of pepper flakes next time, just cuz I want to also experience the other flavors more too. Thank you for the recipe !!!

I followed other reviewers suggestions to add white wine, less red pepper, and canned tomatoes. I would have preferred it more spicy. I also added a red bell pepper and 2 diced Roma tomatoes after the garlic and before the canned tomatoes.  It was delicious!

I was extremely disappointed in this recipe. First, it was in no way "sauce", it was a bunch of chopped up canned tomatoes. Second, a good fra diavolo should have a nice kick to it, which this utterly lacked. I won't be trying this one again...

This is fabulous! It is spicy but that can be easily adjusted. I used linguine the first time, after that rice, it makes it much easier/neater to eat.  Have cooked it 3 times in the past few weeks. The sauce is a no brainer to prepare a few days in advance and then cook whatever pasta  you choose the night of the meal. Kudos to MARBALET

My husband is a spicy food fanatic and this really suits his taste for spicy.  Not TOO much spice that it overwhelms the great flavor of the shrimp.

This was good. I used precooked jumbo shrimp (it was what I had). Next time, I'll use fresh and a smaller size. Added Penzeys pasta sprinkle toward the end instead of parsley.

My husband and I really enjoyed this, made with whole wheat linguini, and Spinach-Strawberry salad from this site and 1/2 loaf of French bread- buttered, sprinkled with garlic salt, a big thick slice of fresh tomato and a thin slice of Havarti- broiled for 4 min on low. There were no left overs of anything

Very quick and easy.  Added shrimp and scallops to sauce to cook like others suggested.  Used 1 can diced tomatoes and 2 fresh I had, and definitely decreased the red pepper to 1/4 tsp.  was perfect and I like hot spicy foods.  Will make again.

I love it when simple recipes come together, and this one does! Two suggestions, though. Use San Marzano tomatoes if you can find them, and do not use shrimp, or scallops that have already been cooked. It makes a difference. Thanks, MARBALET!

Made this dish for Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit.  My Mom and brother are excellent cooks and both raved about this recipe.  I used canned Italian plum tomatoes and one can of fire roasted tomatoes, and doubled the shrimp because the bay scallops did not look too fresh at the store.  Excellent, will definitely make again.  Too bad I forgot to take a pic!

I rate things based on if my family gets up for seconds... and they all did on this one.  The only change I made was I doubled the shrimp because I didn't have any scallops.  I bet this would be even more amazing with both.  I will definitely try again as written.

We loved it! We used this recipe twice first, We added 1/2 of white wine, used fire roasted diced tomatoes and the red pepper flakes, soo good, they we didnt use any red pepper flakes used the wine and diced tomatoes but added feta cheese at the end, soooo good, not spicy at all!

YUMMY! I try to follow recipes as written the first time, then adjust. I didn't have scallops so I used extra shrimp. After the sauce cooked down, I thought I'd like a little more, so I added a couple more cups of fresh tomatoes that I had planned to freeze. We like spicy so both my husband I added a little more crushed pepper, but spiciness is a matter of taste. This will be a recipe I make again. Hubby LOVED it! I am looking forward do making it when I have time to make homemade pasta.

Great recipe! I used jumbo shrimp and about 1.5x the amount of seafood. The tomato juice reduced quite a bit, so I added a generous splash of red wine towards the end of the simmer. It was delicious! I'll probably add capers next time.

This was just OK. I am not sure if it was the brands of ingredients I used or if I cooked the seafood portion too long, but the flavors did not come together like I thought they should.  I will try it one more time before I give up on it.

This was simply delicious.  I read all of the reviews and made a few changes.  I added about 1/2c of finely chopped red onions to the garlic. I also used the diced tomatoes with garlic, basil, and oregano and added red wine to the sauce.  Finally, I mixed the sauce with the linguine instead of topping the pasta with the sauce.  My family said it was the best dish that I've made in awhile (and I'm a pretty good cook)!  This will definitely be in my recipe rotation.

I guess it's just me? I won't be making this again. The scallops were a rather nasty addition that I found inedible & the dish itself wasn't anything special. Very disappointed as I made this to impress the hubby on a rare visit home (Army)

I also modified this recipe a bit.  I sauteed the garlic in oive oil and used 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper.  I could have used 1 or 1 1/2 but it was good anyway.  I added a can of San Marzano tomatoes that I pulsed in the cuisinart with garlic and a touch of basil.  I didn't use an onion, didn't need it.  I added the shrimp to the sauce and added the linguine at the end to toss.  Excellant recipe and so easy!!!!!!   Thank you!!!!

It was really good, but cooking the scallops and shrimp at the same time led to the shrimp being a bit overcooked.  The scallops I had were a bit large through.  I followed the recommendations of other users and cut the red pepper in half which was perfect.

Yum!  It was scallop season here in Florida so I turned to this recipe to cook up my husband's catch and it did not disappoint.  I made the recipe mostly as is but used my stick blender to crush the tomatoes and added a little brandy to deglaze the pan where the onions and garlic were sauteed.  Thanks!

Quick and simple! I always have these ingredients in my kitchen. This will be an easy dinner to throw together last minute.  I used a heaping teaspoon of crushed red pepper. Which was a little much. So I cut it down with 2-3 ladles of pasta water.  I also used one 28oz can of whole peeled tomatoes.  And I omitted the scallops all together.

Very good dish!  I cut in half and decided to add some zuch that I had in the fridge.  Used a combo of shrimp, scallops and some trout.  Served over whole wheat linguine but sadly, no parsley in the house!

I preferred using fettuccine noodles since I find the texture to suit the dish better. May want to add more of a quick to the flavor with some red bell pepper or any other ingredient to give it more depth as I found the flavor a bit bland.

This was good.  I wasn't sure if the recipe was calling for canned tomatoes or fresh so I used canned and added two fresh ones.  I think I pureed the tomatoes too much because there weren't any chunks and I like it when there are some chunks of tomato in there.  I also only used shrimp because that is what I had.  It was delicious and I will definitely be making again.

Excellent recipe.  After dinner, my husband came directly over to give me a kiss.  I guess the way to a man's heart IS through his stomach!  I agree with the postings to cut back the red pepper flakes - I only put in a 1/3 of it and it was still too much.  It's filling, but also lighter than traditional tomato-based sauces.

OMG this was fantastic! I reviewed what others said first of course. I used only 1/4 t. red pepper (more would have been way too much). I also added red bell pepper. We loved it!

WOW - I'll be making this again. The only modification I did was to add a good dose of red wine as others suggested and some scallions to the shrimp and scallops as they cooked.

I love this recipe. It tasted just like the Fra diavolo sauce at our favorite Italian resturaunt. I did however modify it a bit to get that taste. I used crushed tom instead and added 1 can of fire roasted tom run through the processor very quickly. I also added basil and a drizzle of evoo. A+ recipe

Delicious! I used all shrimp since I had it on hand, 3 cans diced tomatoes, pulsed in the food processor, added extra cayenne to taste, 1/2 tsp dried basil, and 1 generous tsp of italian seasoning. Very yummy, served with whole wheat thin spaghetti. I highly recommend this recipe!

I've been using this recipe for a while now, and I love it!  It's really easy to throw together quickly, and tastes like it was much more complicated to prepare.  I just use shrimp in the dish, since that is what we like.  When I have fresh shrimp, that is what I use, but it also works to thaw frozen, precooked shrimp, pat them dry, and just toss them in at the end to heat through in the sauce.  And we always have a good, crusty bread to soak up that yummy sauce!

This was yum. I did the shrimp in the same pan as every thing else and used penne pasta. It was so easy and good.

Thought it was good, but had some difficulty with it.  Messed up in buying the shrimp, was shelled, made it kind of complicated.  With that, I overcooked the pasta, trying to peel the shrimp,  will give another try. Regardless had nice flavor.

Wow,sooooo good.  My only suggestion is to definitely watch the pepper flakes.  We like spicy food and this was pushing it a bit for us.  Thanks to all the reviewers who recommended using mussels.  Can't wait to try that next time.

Quote from hubby "tastiest pasta dish you have ever made."  I think that says plenty.  I did as some things that others suggested like mushrooms, capers, and red wine.  Very very good.

Very good but just short of sublime.  On the other hand, my husband loved it.  I used fresh tomatoes and enjoyed the spiciness of the red peppers. Fresh seafood important. Think I'll try a little wine and shallots next time. Also works well as a chunky soup.

My guests thought it was too spicy, but I thought it was perfect. Perhaps half the red pepper for those who don't do spicy, but those who do will go back for seconds!

Also, a chopped onion added with the garlic adds some interest to the sauce, but it tastes (and smells!) wonderful as it is.

Thoroughly enjoyed this dish!  I added calamari rings to this dish and added them with the shrimp and scallops to cook.  I increased the garlic and used all fresh diced tomatoes.  I added a splash of red wine and served this over spaghetti.  We LOVED it!  The calamari was super flavorful in this sauce and just melted in my mouth.  This is a nice, bold flavored dish with a bit of a kick to it.  Fresh tomatoes really send this one over the top in my book.  Great recipe!  Will make again.

This is a very good recipe. I made a few changes. First I added more garlic because i'm a garlic addict.  at the end i added cilantro instead of parsley.  this recipe is excellent.my family loved it and I know I'll be making this again and again.

Very, very good.  I used a pound of shrimp (no scallops) and only about 1/2 tsp. of the red pepper.  I also used penne pasta instead of linguine, as that's all I had on hand.  The tomatoes took exactly 30 minutes to cook down.  This was delicious-- subtly sweet with just the right amount of kick.  I will definitely make this again.

Wonderful!  I'll admit that we love spicy foods, but I did go overboard on the red pepper.  It tasted great, but I'm paying for it this morning.  I'll certainly make this again.

So good - silky, sweet and spicy. I added about 2 Tbsp. of dry red wine before I let it reduce and it was a nice background flavor.  Make SURE you let it reduce the entire 30 minutes.

Fabulous. Used 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and all the red pepper it called for. It wasn't too spicy for me or my family. The sweet shrimp & scallops are a really nice contrast to the spicy sauce. We will be making this often! Thanks! :)

Very good, quick and easy, and healthy!  We did use canned tomatoes as the fresh tomatoes aren't quite ripe in our stores but thought it tasted great anyhow.  I can see that fresh tomatoes would be even better.  Even so, definitely loved this recipe.  Paired well with green salad and a glass of red wine.

My family thought this was good but not great.  It tasted a little too fishy but I have to admit that I cooked the scallops and shrimp in the sauce rather than cooking them separately and then adding to the sauce.  I think some sherry or wine would be a nice addition to this sauce.

This is the best *****  A few minor alterations like using spegetti ,1 clove of garlic,1 cup of canned diced tomatoes,and 1/4 teaspoon pepper flakes with some cracked pepper and grated parmesan and romano cheese on the top.  This was the best seafood dish that I have ever had!!!!!!!!!! I did a 4 person recipe.

For being so simple, this tasted great. I cut the recipe in half and used one 14.5 oz. can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes. My only complaint is that after 30 minutes of cooking, all the liquid was gone and the sauce was pretty thick. Also I didn't feel it made enough sauce for the amount of pasta specified. Next time I'll use less pasta and a shorter cooking time for the sauce.

This was just "ok". The tomatoes were overpowering and the bay scallops were lost in the dish. I would decrease the amount of tomatoes and use sea scallops instead.

A wonderful, flavorful sauce!  My husband and I loved it (and he hates seafood)! I did alter it just a bit and used another cup of chopped roma tomatoes and adjusted the amount of red pepper flakes and salt accordingly.

I read ALL of the reviews and opted for 2 cans of diced tomatoes and 1/4 c. red wine.  I used the boat motor to smooth out the sauce and it was fantastic.  I highly recommend this as it gives depth to the sauce.  I didn't change any of the spices.  I would rate the sauce a 5 and would have rated the whole recipe a 5, but the seafood was bad and I had to switch to chicken, which was good, but I was disappointed.  Will do again next time with scallops and shrimp.  I loved this and so did my husband.  Thanks so much.

This was very tasty.  Made it for a dinner party.  I used pre-cooked shrimp and just added them at the end.  I can't wait to try again and add some red wine - I think that might be the ingredient that I felt was missing!

Great recipe.  Definately start out with less red pepper and add to your taste.  This can get very spicy and you want to make sure you can tolerate it and enjoy it! My husband loves this.

I give it a four star but hubby gives it a five.  I cheated a bit.  Did not use shrimp and scallops,  I used a mix of octupus, mussels, shrimp and crab.  I did not ad the parsley.  Husband said that it was even great the next day reheated.

When I made this I took the advice of others and cut the pepper down considerably.  I didn't want to have 3rd degree burns on my tongue (if at all possible) :) I didn't have whole tomatoes so I used diced and used 2 cans. I added oregano, basil and dry parsley as I didn't have fresh on han. After it cooked for the 30 minutes i added about a 1/4 cup of wine. I used shrimp, scallops and imitation crab meat. I also used whole wheat pasta (I think it tastes just the same) Over all, this was awesome! I will make it again!!!

This was very tasty.  I used whole wheat pasta for a little more nutrition.  You can easily adjust the heat by increasing or decreasing the amount of red pepper flakes.  My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe.  Very simple and easy.  We used shrimp only omitting the scallops (I don't care for them).  I also used pre-cooked shrimp that I just thew into the sauce.  Served with a crunchy salad.  Simple and fast...perfect for a busy weeknight.  Delish

This was super easy and super tasty.  The only thing I changed was I didn't have scallops so I omitted them and added extra shrimp.  I also added a few more cloves of garlic.  I will be making this again soon.  Thanks

This recipe was excellent! A little spicy for my taste, so I'll tone down the red pepper flakes next time, but even spicy it was delicious. I substituted chicken tenderloins sauteed in olive oil and balsamic vinegar with spices for the shrimp and scallops and it came out great. Definitely a new favorite in our house.

This was absolutely amazing! I prefer this recipe over any spaghetti recipe. I didn't have any scallops so I only used shrimp. Also, I added a little kick to the recipe by adding pepper flakes along with red pepper paste (i.e.red rooster sauce-asian). And I didnt have any fresh parsley so I used dried parsley. It was very delicious all together. Serve with garlic bread on the side! Will definately cook again!

Very good recipe! I too added red wine (about 1/4 cup) and a couple tablespoons of sugar to the sauce. I didn't use a full tsp. of red pepper and it was still pretty spicy. I will definitely make again!

Loved this recipe!  Replaced the whole tomatoes with diced tomatoes and used Sea scallops instead of Bay and the recipe still came out really tasty with just the right amount of spice!  This is a keeper.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  We thought it was very heavy on the garlic so I will scale back next time I make it. I sauteed about 1/2 cup finely diced red onion with the garlic which added a nice sweetness to the finished sauce.  A tablespoon of balsamic rounded the sauce off nicely.  Will definitely make this again!  Thanks!

I'm an amateur cook looking for recipes that are difficult to ruin and taste good--this is definitely one of them.  My boyfriend was impressed, and frankly so was I!  This recipe is better than fra diavolo I've had at Italian restaurants!  We both LOVE spicy food, so for us the stated amount of red pepper flakes was perfect.

Very good sauce. I had no shrimp so used a pound of bay scallops. Also had no parsley so used fresh basil, and added a splash of red wine. The sweetness of the scallops contrasted nicely with the spice of the sauce. I will definately make this sauce often.
Thanks for posting it.

This is a great, easy recipe.  I usually double the shrimp and omit scallops, since that's what we usually have in the freezer.  Whole-wheat pasta tastes great with this dish, too.

This was wonderful.  I only had a large can of diced tomatoes on hand, which I used in place of the whole tomatoes.  I also only had a pound of shrimp.  I can't wait to have it again.

This is a wonderful dish. My husband loves this dish everytime I make it he tells me how good this is. I always leave out the scallops and double up on the shrimp, it turns out great everytime. Thanks for the recipe.

I added about 1/4 cup red wine...yummmmm...and used a frozen seafood mix of shrimp, mussels, octopus & squid.

I think the guy who said this recipe was bland probably forgot to put in the crushed red pepper.

I followed the recipe to a tee, but instead pf serving the sauce over the pasta, I mixed the pasta into the sauce, so every one would get an equal amount of sauce. Well, there was not enough sauce for that amount of pasta, and that was the blandest stuff I've ever had.

Great recipe. I have four children and a husband. When we try a new recipe from "All Recipes", I let my family rate it. They gave this four stars and said they wanted it again. My husband thought there was too much garlic, but my children liked the garlic flavor. Thanks for the recipe!!

This was really good for how easy and quick it was. My husband and I are addicted to hot and spicy food so I think it could have used a little more heat but it's fine for most people. I halved it and used a can of diced Italian tomatoes and because I didn't have shrimp, I just threw in a can of kidney beans (should've halved the the beans as well though - too much). Otherwise I stuck by the recipe. Yum! Can't wait to make it again and maybe play with it a bit - mushrooms, zucchini, heck, maybe even shrimp!

i am making this right now,AND WOW! it smells sooo good! we usually make the cajun seafood pasta (on this site, spicy, with a cream sauce) but this is going to be a nice change. the sauce is incredible, too!!! i used all of the red pepper, added some garlic, and for good measure threw in some sliced olives. very mediterranean :-) love it!!! * just be sure NOT to overcook the seafood for even a second! Chewy shrimp are not a good thing :-)

Incredible!  And easy!  I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes and all the red pepper and it turned out great.  My husband and I decided that the sauce was a tad too zippy for the scallops and will use all shrimp next time.  This will become a staple in our house.

This recipe was very good.  We are not huge scallop fans, so we used mussels instead.  For the sauce, I put the whole tomatoes in the food processor and added a can of diced tomatoes.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent Recipe.  My husband loves it.  I have also made this for company and it was a great hit!  I add a bit more shrimp, and scallops along with a few more tomatoes for extra juice. I don't even peel the tomatoes!

Delicious!  I'm glad I read the reviews before I made this.  I used 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and I was glad I did.  1 tsp would have been too much for my taste.  I'll be doubling the ingredients next time I make this so I can have some left overs.  Thanks

Excellent!  I omitted the scallops & doubled the shrimp.  I also used 2 cans of petite diced tomatoes and added about 2 Tbsp. of chopped kalamata olives.  This is just sooo good - and I don't typically like tomato based dishes!

This was extremely easy and quite flavorful.  I added some italian seasoning and think that it would have been a little bland without it.  Someone else suggested using chicken in place of the seafood, and I imagine that would taste even better in this sauce.

The recipe uses a little too much salt.  I reduced the salt a little and it is wonderful.  Play with it and you can get it just the way you want it.

Maybe 1/2 teaspoon pepper would be better for the spicy-sensitive. I used frozen cocktail shrimp, and next time, I will use the smaller shrimp and let it thaw first because frozen shrimp gives out a lot of water and it boils. Also remove the tail from the shrimp so you don't have to do it as you're eating. I used a can of whole tomatoes, and let it cook for long enough so it wouldn't be so watery.

This was wonderful, i made it for my girlfriend one special evening, she loved it and so did i. The only change i made was to leave out the red pepper, i know i know, its supposed to e spicy but im not a big spicy food fan. Either way it came out delicious.

Looking for something quick with all the ingredients here at home.  So glad I made this.  I added more herbs as others had said it was a little plain, I also added more garlic b/c have alot of garlic lovers in the family.  I added some dried Herbs from Provence and some dried Italian seasoning to taste.  And instead of shrimps and scallops (don't eat them) I substituted sweet turkey italian sausage and served with fresh linguine.  Absolutely delicious!  Sauce is like a marinara thoroughly enjoyed it.  Loved how easy and tasty this was I will definitely make again.  Thanks Holly =)

This recipe is awesome! I work in an Italian restaurant and this sauce tastes just as good as the sauces at work. It's so easy and healthy too.

I love Fra Diavlo sauce!  And I do like this one. My only complaint would be that it seems a bit watery... but I think next time I'll try adding tomato sauce to it to thicken it up a bit... This is sooo easy... I do add some other seasonings (pepper, italian seasoning). I think this is a good recipe to build on...

I just made this for my fiance.  It was delicious!  I cheated a little and used canned, diced tomatoes flavored with basil and garlic.  I also doubled the red pepper.

I found this recipe was rather bland, but, it has some true potential.  The next time I make it, I will try and add some fresh basil, oregano, and red wine to season things up.

This recipe is easy to prepare and has an awesome taste.  My husband and I loved it, my kids even liked it.  I too cut the red pepper in half and it was spicy enough.  Next time I am making a double batch, it went that fast.

Good, simple, tasty weeknight dish if you're not in the mood to cook. The sauce definitely tastes better the next day! Great to leave in the fridge at work for something other than crappy lunchcounter sandwhiches.

My husband loved this.  I hated it because I didn't like the scallops.  I also used canned diced tomatoes which may have been a mistake.

This recipe was so good and so easy to make.  It was nice and spicy and I think the scallops added to the flavor making it more seafood-y tasting.  It was a big hit!

Great sauce!  I didn't think it was excellent, just great.  It needed something.  I just can't figure out what that something is.  Maybe sauteed mushrooms?  Extra garlic?

So easy and so delicious!  I had a bag of big scallops and so I used just those rather than a shrimp-scallop combo.  I also used dried basil because I didn't have parsley.  This will go on our favorite list!

This recipe was simply delicious.  I used fresh tomatoes instead, which I peeled myself and added tomato sauce.  I also added a bit more garlic which gave the sauce the right kind of flavor for the shrimp and the pasta.
