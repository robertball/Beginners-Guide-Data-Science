I did not have tapioca flour so I just used flour. Good flavor, but am wondering if the number of steps could be shortened with similar results. 

Used an air fryer oven and the listed cook time was accurate.

This is the best air fried chicken I have had so far. My boys loved it too. I made chicken breasts instead of thighs and they came out juicy and delicious.  I will definitely make again!

Very good!  I recommend it.  I also did not have tapioca flour so I used tiger nut flour .   The flavor was great.  The chicken was very moist   We will definitely make this again

I’m the author of this recipe, and would suggest the reviewer who said it was bland, likely has outdated spices (or didn’t make it). Please try making it with new spices. I’m sure you’ll have better success.
