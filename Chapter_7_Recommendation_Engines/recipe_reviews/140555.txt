This was very good, I have made it twice.Both times I used bonless breast because thats what we always have on hand. the first time I used regular  (spanish) Paprika, and it was pretty good. The second time i used Hungarian paprika, Oh my god what a difference. the second time i made it it was for 9 hungry firemen. They devoured it. I know alot of people say to make good paparikash you need to use bone in chicken, but i'm here to say that this was outstanding with bonless breast. I will be making this for years to come. Thanks for sharing

The traditional way is to sprinkle the flour over the cooking ingredients and give it some time to let the flavors mingle before adding the sour cream. It makes a big difference in taste. As one reviewed also noted they added broth which is also the way I learned. One key thing: the recipe doesn't specify Hungarian paprika. It is a totally different taste from Spanish which is what you typically get in grocery stores. It is worth the search as it really is the main flavor that defines Hungarian cuisine.

Yum! I had never even heard of this dish before, let alone make it. I had chicken and sour cream I wanted to use and I figured 'what the heck'. Turned out great! Never made dumplings before but they were good. I think I had too much dumpling and not enough sauce..either that or I cooked the chicken too long and reduced the liquid too much before adding the sour cream..I added water and it still was a little thick and seemed like not enough. Next time, I will use a little more water, and also add a little garlic when I add the onion to the chicken to cook, and actually maybe increase the paprika a little (using the cheap stuff :-(  ). But this had a really good flavor and I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

This is very much like my family's recipe (my grandma is an Hungarian immigrant), we stir the sour cream in before serving, as sour cream breaks when heated. I've altered my family recipe by removing the skin from the chicken (it gets flabby during the brazing)I dust the chicken lightly with flour and brown it in with the paprika, salt pepper and oil then ad chicken stock to braze. I remove my dumplings from the boiling pot after a 10-minute boil and put them into my large pan with the chicken. The starch fron the dumplings helps to thicken the sauce. (another reason to stir the sour cream just before serving or "on the side" some family members don't like sour cream, (yeah, I know?!) and leftovers..(yeah, I know?!) are easily reheated without the sour cream separating and making it greasy. (And buy the good hungarian paprika-it makes a difference). But otherwise, this is a good authentic version of paprikas!

I can not believe people who look at a recipe & then tell everyone it is NOT tradional.. This recipe "does not say that it is". If yours IS tradional, then pass it on so we can use. Don't just blast this one. We'd all love to see yours on this page. Thank You

Pretty straight forward to make. I'd make the dumplings small as in and of themselves they don't have much flavor. The sauce/gravy is what makes this dish for me. Really good, almost cheesy flavor. I found myself dipping my chicken into the dumpling sauce. (I also used boneless chicken breast and it was great). This is a heavy meal, you'll be tired afterwards.

I originally gave this recipe 4 stars. But I used Hungarian (1 1/2 Tablespoons of sweet and half a tablespoon of sharp)  I also used chicken stock instead of water. 

  If you are a newbie to cooking, the dumplings take a LOT more time and effort than you might think. It added 2 hours to my prep time and was a bit stressful. I'd likely just use egg noodles or mashed potatoes next time.

I fixed this for my wife and I and we found the flavor to be excellent.  Used chicken broth instead of water for additional flavor.  Other than that followed the recipe as written.  We both did find the dumplings to be very heavy but that might be the way they are meant to be.  Being from down south we are use to lighter dumplings.  Also, I brine the chicken for 1 hour before cooking.  It was very tender and juicy.  Always brine my chicken first, on matter what.  Makes a big difference.

Very good!  But not very visually appealing.  When I added the sour cream mixture, the sauce got chunky.  But it still tasted really great!

I just finished cooking this. I followed the recipe (except i used denny moore pre-packaged dumplings that i rinsed before adding). The sauce was a little bland even using authentic hungarian paprika. I added about a tablespoon more of paprika, and it is very tasty now!

This is just ok in my opinion. I would have given 3 stars, but my husband loves it so I upped it to 4. I don't care for the dumplings.  They're very flavorless.  I've never had dumplings before... maybe that's the way they're supposed to be?

Way too much butter!!  I had to increase paprika to cut down the taste which worked in favor of it but did not like the consistency with butter too thick and buttery..like the other reviewer grandmother's paprikash, my mother did the same and can't duplicate.  It was ok just enough satisfy craving but would cut back on butter next time or just use oil.  Boiled chicken first in water til very tender (almost falling off bone) and used that water to add more flavor to skillet to cook chicken even more.

this was a very tasty dish!  I liked that the ingredients are things that I keep stocked on a regular basis.  I used boneless chicken, and used bisquick dumplings instead of the ingredients listed here, but the outcome was very good!  a nice warm meal for a chilly night.

I loved this growing up.  I use hot paprika, because I just love that stuff, and skinless boneless chicken, because I do not like chicken on the bone.  The sauce is spot on.

I followed the recipe exactly and the result looked just like the picture--perfect directions.  My only complaint on this dish is that, for our tastes, it was rather bland.  Maybe I just don't have very kicky paprika?

Very delicious! and a definite keeper!!  I messed up my dumplings cooking them too long due to a distraction (too tough), so I made some egg noodles to substitute.  The chicken was so tender it was melting off the bone.  Next time, I'm going to try this with boneless breast and thigh cuts since we prefer our meat boneless anyway.

I hate rating this not following it exactly but I took others suggestions and I substituted chicken broth for water through the whole recipe.  I made the dumplings with chicken broth instead of water.  I also added an extra 1/2 T and it was great.  My husband thought it would be good as an added variation to add a little cayenne pepper to give it some spice.  I liked it as is!

I used chicken breasts for this recipe because it's all I had on hand. I also used Sazon and added a little extra regular paprika because I didn't have Hungarian paprika. I also put a little garlic powder on the chicken as well as a tiny bit of chili powder and a couple dashes of hot sauce to suit me and my husband's taste. I absolutely love this and will be making it again.

Very good flavor. Took a while for the dumplings to be made, they were very bland and dense, but the sauce complimented them. Give yourself two hours from start to finish...perhaps I'm a bit slow.

I grew up on this.. and as one reviewer said.. she uses much more paprika.. Over the years I also add orange juice... about 1/2 cup... we call the dumplings knockerlach.... easiest way to measure the ingredients for the dumplings... is as many eggs as you want... use the egg shells to measure the water... then slowly add flour until it is a very gummy and sticky dough...and then do the same.. this is just a variation of this basic Chicken Paprikash...

This recipe definitely has an unique taste which makes it SO good!!  The recipe was very easy to follow.  The only things I changed were instead of using water for boiling the dumplings I used chicken broth and I also added chicken broth to the chicken instead of water.  I added garlic pepper to the dough before cooking and to the chicken for flavoring when cooking.  I can't necessarily say that the recipe needed any of that, but I love lots of flavor so I added a few things.  Overall, the recipe was a hit with the family and I will definitely be making it again!!!!  Thank you for the recipe.

This was very good. I used boneless, skinless breasts because we only like white meat. I added extra paprika and doubled the sauce.
Thanks for the new chicken recipe!

I really liked this a lot! I used about a tsp more salt in the sauce and an extra tbsp of paprika as someone suggested. I found that these changes made for a more savory sauce. Also, I put both the dumplings and chicken together in the pan to simmer for a few minutes then serve together. I did this more out of convenience than anything and it was a hit.

It was a bit bland the first time, so I swapped out the water for chicken broth and added minced garlic and a TON of hot hungarian paprika. I didn't make the dumplings, but I thought I'd try pouring everything over the chicken and some quinoa...an interesting texture that didn't detract from the flavor of the paprikash. I had some leftovers for lunch and my coworkers are all quite impressed with my "amazing cooking skills". I didn't have the heart to tell them this is a pretty easy recipe!

This is a yummy recipe that is easy to follow and adapt.  For instance, simply reduce or increase the ingredients for fewer or more guests.    I would like to make a couple of suggestions.  First, the dumpling recipe makes LOTS of dumplings and could be reduced.  I find the using a teaspoon measure makes a nice, little dumpling which is tasty as the surface area to mass ratio is greater, allowing more sauce to cover the dumpling.  I found it better to use boneless skinless cuts.  While some flavor is lost, it is easier to eat a sauce covered piece of meat if you don't have to look for bones.  Also, in this health conscious age, many people discard the skin, thus losing much of the sauce.    I noticed one cook rated the recipe as bland.  It is important to have fresh paprika.  (In the past, I have grown my own peppers and ground it when needed.)  For this recipe I used Spanish Paprika which added a little sweetness along with some zip.  In most recipes of this type you can never use too much paprika, so be generous if the flavor is lacking.  ChefDave

Loved it! Dont use cheap paprika! Use high quality after all it is center stage! I used Penzeys smoked! Yummy! Dumplings were great too! Why season them more? They are just there to hold the sauce! Do Double sauce!

This was good. We love hungarian sweet paprika, so I was happy to try this dish. The dumplings didn't have the right denstiy for me. We prefer a lighter dumpling.(use a little milk and baking powder). If I make this again; I would use less butter and add marjoram, thyme, and garlic.

to make this even better, before you add flour and sour cream, take the chichen out, cool it and take the meat of the bone and then mix sauce and meat with the dumplings. also make sure you use hungarian sweet paprika and not the spanish, there really is a differnce in flavour between the two paprikas. have been making this for years , my grandkids and kids love this. goes a long way if you make double the dumplings for a larger family

I seriously don't get why this is rated so high. It's bland, has no taste, and isn't worth a bit of the calories. I can't even think of a suggestion to make this better. People who have rated this higher, did all kinds of substitutions and additions, which completely alters the recipe, thus making it's high rating a joke. The dumplings have no taste and are too heavy, and the chicken has no taste at all. Will never make again, will never recommend to anybody.

The dumplings were meh but a nice intro to the sauce, which came out well with yogurt swapped in for the sour cream. Also, I think the bacon-y smoked paprika is what's up in this dish.

I have to say I enjoyed the dish when I made a few adjustments to it. I used less water, and sour cream. I used about a 1/4 cup water and 1/4 sour cream. It turned out delicious every time I made it.

My favorite comfort food!  Great authentic recipe! My Grandparents are all Hungarian and this recipe is just about dead on!  The only thing I would change is the paprika- I use 3T.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I'm hooked!  This dish is so yummy, I can't stop "tasting" the sauce.  I used chicken broth which gave it plenty of flavor and I added closer to 2 TB of paprika (if not a bit more).  My husband absolutely loved it!  My only complaint is that the sauce turned out a bit clumpy.  If not for the clumps this would've been perfect.

Very tasty.  Used Spanish paprika because that's what I had.  Tasted even better reheated the second day.  Great creamy hearty dish...perfect for fall, and the dumplings were easy enough for my 4 year old to help make.

After reading other reviews I did not make the dumplings, used boneless chicken breasts, added a chicken cube to the water and you definitely need sweet Hungarian paprika, a little bitmore that called for. Other than very good.

Great recipe. I used chicken breasts and cut them in half- worked just as well as chicken pieces. Lots of dishes to clean up at the end, but worth it. I might use a hair less pepper next time, as I don't like my food too spicy... but you can't go wrong if you follow this recipe!

Not as good as I thought it would be. Would be MUCH better if chicken was marinated in salt and pepper overnight before cooking, much too bland. also the dumpling instructions need to be more specific. way too doughy and like biting into hard lumps.

I doctored the sauce by adding garlic and I used chicken broth instead of water. i doubled the sauce also. I wish I would have added some herbs to the dumplings, they were very bland, (I did add onion salt to them instead of regular salt), to the point i did not like them. I also sprinkled seasoning salt, pepper and paprika to the chicken before cooking. I made noodles to serve with instead. The sauce is yummy but only gave 3 stars because i changed so much.

Wow! This was fabulous. I was sure to use Hungarian Paprika. Also, I did as some previous reviewers suggested and made the dumplings/noodles very small and boiled them in chicken broth. We would have been happy eating the dumplings plain all by themselves - lucky for us we had just enough self control to wait for the entire dish to come together - YUM! I will definitely be making this again and again. Thank you Erin for the awesome recipe!

This was an exceptional recipe, the sauce was creamy and flavorful.  I had trouble with the dumplings being too tough so next time I will modify and make with homemade noodles.  I used chicken tenders since thats what I had on hand and only wish I had added more.  Will definately make again.

Great dish packed with flavor. I used hungarian paprika like someone suggested, which i think gave it some more kick. Also, threw some onion, paprika and garlic powder into the dumpling batter for some extra flavor. will definitely make again.

Well, I'm not so sure this review is very accurate because 1) I didn't use any onions, 2) I used chicken tenders, and 3) I only had vanilla yogurt (no sour cream).

Yet, I still think it was delicious.  The directions were very easy to follow.  I do suggest telling people to make their dumplings about the size of dice; any bigger doesn't allow the middle to cook properly. The directions for that are somewhat deceiving because it says to "use spoons".

I think I got away with using sweet yogurt because I did not have the sweetness from the onions.  I will definitely try again with the proper ingredients to see how it should really taste, but not bad for using what I had!

This recipe is delicious, my family was amazed, and want me to make it again. I used thighs and legs, and chicken broth instead of water as some recommended, gently simmered for an hour which made the chicken flesh fall off the bone tender and juicy, but it was the wonderful sauce that resulted in the end which made the dish and no one wasted a drop, I got all the dinner plates back wiped clean!  :D

Let me start by saying that I had never had Paprikash before so I have no idea how authentic this recipe tastes.  I really enjoyed this but my husband thought it was much too bland.  Next time I will add some smoked paprika (on top of the Hungarian paprika it already calls for) and some garlic among other things to appease his taste buds.  I will also cut back on the dumplings by at least 1/3.  I had plenty of sauce but I subbed the 1.5 cups of water for 2 cups of homemade chicken stock.  The best dumplings were by far the smallest ones.

This dish is amazing!  It's exactly like my grandmother's recipe. The dumplings do take a lot of time but they are well worth making. I always double the sauce (because it's SO good). I do add boullion and more paprika (Hungarian) for more flavor. Thanks for posting!

This turned out really good.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to season the chicken a little bit more before browning it.

My Oma and my mom make this. My grandpa was from Hungary so its  a family tradition. I haven't tried your recipe yet, but it is very close to our families!! Wanted to share a secret though... can use a little bit of cream of wheat in the "nooglies" as my family calls them :)

I grew up eating my grandmother's chicken paprikash - this is very close!  wonderful!  I have to doubble the dumplings and doupple the sauce because everyone in my house (6) eats way more than usual!  One thing - use chicken stock or broth instead of water!!

My husband is on a low-glycemic diet, so I substituted quinoa flour for regular flour in the dumplings.  Don't do it!  My mistake aside, this was AWESOME!  We only had smoked paprika instead of regular paprika and it gave the sauce a wonderful, rich smoky flavor. Loved this recipe.

This was good, but it wasn't fabulous.  I added the original amount of Hungarian Paprika, but there was no taste to the sauce.  I saw on other Paprikash recipes that you could use 3 Tbs, so I did.  One of my teens said it was then too spicy and hurt her tummy.  My suggestion would be to adjust the spice according to your family's tastes.  If you don't want to make the dumplings, just substitute a can of biscuits, cut into thumb sized pieces and cook according to recipe directions.  We probably won't be making this again, as we prefer the traditional (Kentucy/Irish) chicken and dumplings that I grew up on.

This recipe is fabulous! Only changes I made was adding 2 chicken boullion cubes to 2 cups of water instead of 1 1/2 cups water. I also used milk instead of water in the dumplings. Flavor was great! I've never made dumplings before and they were so easy and delicious!

This has a wonderful flavor. I use 1/4 cup less flour to make the dumplings less dense. I can't tell a difference between using bone-in or boneless chicken, except boneless cooks faster. Also, it's less greasy without the skins. I use the extra sauce as a topping for the chicken. Where do you buy Hungarian paprika? I didn't find it at my local grocery store. No matter what recipe I've tried, the flavor never seems to soak into the chicken. The chicken itself seems bland.

Made this for the first time tonight.  I used  boneless, skinless chicken breasts due to time constraints.  Turned out so yummy!  I used purchased dumplings, but wish I would have made my own.  I also used a little smoked paprika with the usual kind to add that smokey bacony flavor.  My husband loved it too, the kids liked the gravy, and chicken, but not the dumplings.  Will surely make again!

This was very good but I think I made the dumplings too big.  I'll use a smaller spoon next time.  These dumplings taste great though.  I also used more paprika.  Yumm.

Delicious! I added more paprika than called for in the recipe. The sauce was a little thin but the flavor made up for it! Will make again for sure!

Delicious!  My husband is a huge fan and excited for leftovers tomorrow!  I used boneless skinless chicken breast, wheat flour, plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream, and all the substitutions worked great!  I also took others' advice and made little dumplings and used good Hungarian paprika.  My only suggestion is to cut back on the salt.  I used 2 tsp in the dumplings, then skipped the rest of the salt called for in the recipe.  That was plenty!

Great recipe!!!  I don't understand the person who rated 1 star because it wasn't authentic!  It doesn't appear they even made it!  I loved it!  The dumplings (actually spatzle) are awsome.  The smaller the better, when boiled in chicken stock, they have an even better flavor.  My friends love it!  Great for leftovers also.

This is the worst Paprikash recipe I've ever laid eyes on.  In no way is this anything like true Hungarian Paprikash. There is certainly no sour cream in the hundreds old recipe made by my family. And you must SMOTHER the chicken with tons of onion and more paprika than you think should be in any one dish.

Very close to the classic from Vienna or Prague.  Try to add chicken stock, no salt or homemade, to be a bit more classical.  even 25% Riesling wine with 75% water for the sauce.

this dish is so amazing the way you can change it and its still good! i made the mistake tonight of starting to cook before i checked that we had ALL of the ingredients necessary because i knew we did but we didnt have enough of everything.. the changes i made had no negative effect it was still delicious -
didnt have enough flour SO the dumplings were a bit salty..
didnt have enough sour cream - added 1 cup milk with a little under 1 cup sour cream
didnt have any onions - 1 1/2 cups french's fried onions worked
probably put way too much paprika in as mine came out red instead of whitish as hers did so i added one of those bag and bake things of seasoning afraid it might taste funky 0 i used country chicken 

delicious..

only next time i will make SURE i have the right ingredients and ENOUGH of them to make this so i can truly try it without my last minute mess ups!

wonderfully versatile dish!

I was worried that my picky family would dislike this dish, but it earned five stars all around.  I was thrilled to see my youngest and pickiest eater gobble up three helpings!  This wasvery simple to prepare, though I managed to accumulate an impressive stack of dirty dishes in the process!  I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and fat free sour cream.  I subbed 2 tablespoons of olive oil for butter when browning the chicken.  I do agree with the reviewers who suggested making the dumplings very small.  Fantastic!

Great tasting dish.  I opted out of the dumplings. They just seemed like empty calories to me. Ironically, I did use egg noodles, but not many. This was delicious and a bit different. Next time I will add lots of mushrooms. Thank you.

I also made this with boneless chicken breasts and served it over rotini pasta and it was delicious.  I was a little short on sauce though, so next time I will double it.  Great recipe, thanks!!!

I have to admit, I've never eaten paprikash before so I wasn't quite sure what it was supposed to taste like. But if the real thing tastes similar to this then I'm sold! I used chicken breasts, because that's all I had on hand, and instead of water I used chicken broth. I had the cheap paprika so I added a little bit more to the pot to ensure I had enough flavor and coloring. I served over egg noodles (less carbs and fat than dumplings or rice). End result? No leftovers! Good and filling!

I substituted about 1TB sunflower oil for the butter and used low fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  Tastes good and much healthier.

Absolutely wonderful.  Only modified by using 1 14oz can of chicken broth for the 1 1/2 cup water.  Will surely make again and again.  You do not need to make the spaetzel before beginning the dinner...you  can do them at the same time.

I am not sure what I did wrong. I was so looking forward to eating this, but it had very little flavor. I followed the recipe exactly(I am not always a recipe follower) but it seemed like something was missing - very bland.

OMG this was so yummy even my picky 9 1/2 year old gobbled it up! I followed the recipe almost exactly except for a couple of details. In the dumplings I added chicken stock instead of water, and chicken stock instead of water to the chicken. also with the chicken I floured the pieces before adding them to the pan. I will be making this recipe again, and again! Ladies this is not a dish you want to eat when your dieting!

The sauce for this was fabulous but there were way too many dumplings. I've never made drop dumplings before and they came out too dense. Will definitely make the sauce again, maybe for pork chops.

My God-Father was Hungarian and I used to have this dish at his home as a child.  This recipe taste EXACTLY like he used to make and brought back SOOO many memories!  We aren't big fans of dumplings so we served it over shell noodles. YUM!!!  Even makes great left-overs IF there are any!  The family - even my PICKY kids loved it!  Thank you for sharing this!

I thought this was really very good.  I never made Paprikash before or the dumplings, so the recipe was new, but I love Paprikash.  It was easy to make and you just want to "drink" the sauce - as my boyfriend attempted to do !  I agree with another that there needs to be additional sauce with this amount of chicken/dumplings.  Thanks so much for the recipe - I will make this again.  Next time, I may stir in sauteed mushrooms in the end as well. Sue.

This is a wonderful recipe; I have made this about 5 times since I first tried the recipe about a year ago. I too use broth or stock in place of the water and add more paprika probably about a total of 3 ½ tablespoons. I use about 3 cups of broth and cook the chicken on low until is it falling off the bone. I then remove the meat from the broth and bone the chicken. This is when I add the flour to thicken the broth mixture and add the scour cream. I wait until the end to return the chicken to the pot (doing so too early has left me with only shreds of chicken) The dumplings are wonderful and my boys like to help make them.

Oh my word!  This was an amazing!  I added chicken bouillon to the water but I remained faithful to the recipe otherwise.  I am making it two evenings in the row.  I LOVE THE GRAVY!!!  I am salivating just thinking about supper tonight.  THANK YOU!!!

This recipe is so simple, so delicious, and the sauce will have you mopping up your plate with a soft bread.  I used bone in thighs, made mashed potatoes not dumplings, and tossed some thin sliced zucchini into the onion mixture. I know, I know, zukes are not part of the classic Paprikash but they are exploding out of the garden and so I put them into everything! 

I used white wine for moisture when the veggies were softening, and next time I may use chicken stock since I always have it in the freezer.  I did not mix the flour into the sour cream; I pulled the chicken out and floured the vegetables and let that thicken, while I ran the chicken through the toaster oven cycle to crisp the skin.  When those two things were done, I stirred in the sour cream and let it all blend but not boil because I didn't want the sauce to break.  

So while I'm telling you exactly what I did... in all, the changes I made were for my convenience and style but made no substantial difference to the recipe.

Very very close to the recipe taught to me by my Grandmother, although over the years I have taken to adding chicken stock, parsley and I stick strictly to Szgred Paprika.  
Also, something Very Important!  Driven home to me by "my "Ex", a grad of the CIA.  I wondered why my sauce sometimes broke, and without blinking he said "Don't Let It Boil after the cream is added"!!  This was our first date.  he passed the Foodie Test and taught me about cream sauces at once, so Please, while you may be lucky, Do Not Let the sauce come to a boil after the sour cream is added!

The only things that really make it Hungarian is using Hungarian Paprika (Szeged) and adding 3 canned plum tomatoes crushed by hand and half of a small bell pepper cut into strips. This is added after the liquid is poured over chicken.

This dish is quite similar to what I grew up eating, my mother being Hungarian. To be a little on the healthier side, I use boneless skinless breasts and chicken stock instead of water. I've been making this for over 30 years and have never had anyone NOT like it. The dumplings are awesome! Hint: if you use an iced tea spoon and dip it in the boiling water prior to scooping the dumpling dough, you can avoid having to use two spoons. It's much easier. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's a wonderful dish!

Excellent recipe! We purchased good quality hungarian sweet paprika from a local spice shop just for this recipe and I believe it was well worth it! Used vegetable broth in place of the water for simmering the chicken. Thanks! We will definitely be making this recipe again!

I doubled the recipe and ended up with way too much dough for the dumplings and ended up throwing away half of it since we don't care to eat too much starchy foods.  I will skip the dumpling and next time use some other type of pasta instead.  Also, I used boneless, skinless thighs...I cannot imagine why using bone and skin would make a big difference except to add more fat and maybe bone marrow juices.  In any case this dish was very good and will be added to my recipe staples.  I might add a bit more paprika as suggested by some.

My 4 year old just requested "that chicken with the sauce" - it took a while to decode the message, but here I am looking up ingredients for my shopping list. This is a recipe the whole family loves, from 90 year-old grandpa on down to 4 year old Maisy. My husband even shares it with his co-workers.   I substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream and add a couple table spoons of crumbled apple wood smoked bacon.  Delicious!

Yummy, but time consuming (I've only made it once so far since my husband wasn't as big a fan of it).  I was trying to find a recipe similiar to one I had at a Polish restaurant and it was close, although my dumplings need somework.  Mine came out on the larger size and were thus doughy tasting (they were cooked all the way through).

This recipe is great! I use chicken broth or stock instead of water, more butter and a little more paprika! Both on bone chicken and boneless skinless chicken breast ...Excellent! Have used this as a base recipe and personalized many times, many ways!

A guilty pleasure made healthy. 

I, too, used chicken stock instead of water. For years I have substituted low fat natural yogurt for sour cream and this was no exception. The sauce was so creamy it felt like a real luxury. 

I used one tablespoon smoked paprika, one of sweet paprika and 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne. Will up that to 1/4 tsp next time. 

I made the spaetzel (sp) from Nikki's review on Aug 18th and it was nice and light but hubby still asked for some potatoes. 

This is a keeper for sure and we look forward to having this again.

What a fantastic recipe. I've made chicken paprikash before, with egg noodles, but this was my first time making spaetzle, and man, what a difference. The spaetzle were SO much better than egg noodles. I did make a few small changes to the recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which I cut up into pieces before cooking them. I used olive oil to brown the chicken. I used reduced sodium chicken broth inside of water. When it comes to paprika, I don't bother measuring it out; I just keep adding it till I feel like I've added enough, and then I add some more. It's impossible to add too much paprika, especially when you're using the authentic Hungarian stuff. I didn't remove the chicken from the skillet before adding the sour cream/flour mixture; I just added the mixture in with the chicken and onions and boiled the whole thing. For the spaetzle, smaller is definitely better. And lastly, once the spaetzle finished cooking, and the sour cream mixture had been added to the chicken and onions, I threw the spaetzle into the skillet so they could soak up some of the sauce. I doubled this recipe and it turned out just fine, but I wouldn't triple it. I'll be using this recipe again and again.

This was tasty. I added some garlic and a dash of cayenne because my paprika is rather weak.

This is a great recipe - to add taste to the chicken, I salt the chicken and let it rest for at least an hour before cooking time.  Chicken thighs are the best.  Also, you can start with the onions, add a little water to them and no butter, cover the pot and cook them for 10-12 minutes.  The onions will be translucent and you don't need the oil or butter.  I also add a heaping Tablespoon of Penzy's Hungarian Sweet Paprika at this point.  Then add the chicken.  To give it a kick in flavor, I add a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and green chilies and some cut up bell or other type of sweet pepper.  This will add enough liquid that you won't need to add maybe 1/4 cup water.  Once the cooking is done.  Serve the Paprikas over the nokedli with a dallop of sour cream instead of putting it into the sauce.  It tastes great even without the sour cream and the calories will be less.  The nokedli can be made using a spetzel maker.   My husband is Hungarian and these are the ways my family have made this dish our tradition.

This was okay to prepare.  I kept thinking this has to easier than this.  I already make a chicken already cut up, I heat the oven at 375 - arrange the chicken in a corningwear, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and paprika, then add a can of cream of mushroom or celery and coat the the chicken pieces, rotate and repeat on the other side.  Put in oven for 40 minutes and done.  the dumplings would be a nice added bonus but the rest could really easy without all the mess that this recipe calls for.  I will rate it a 3 for great idea but there is a way easier way of doing this.  much!

I generally use chicken breasts with this and add chicken stock instead of water.  Also - must use Hungarian paprikash - a lot of it.  I double to triple the amount suggested.  Delicioso!

I'm giving this five stars on the chicken only with some changes I made reading previous reviews. (I know this upsets some people but isn't that why we review recipes?) I've made this twice now and the second time I used boneless chicken thighs, great flavor and no messy bones.  I browned the chicken in bacon grease and to the water added chicken bullion. I used the German Spatzel recipe from this site.  The second time I made it was for a girls night and the ladies went nuts for this!

The sauce from this recipe is out of this world good. I loved it. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that the chicken without the sauce is super bland. Otherwise I loved it. I did use chicken breast in place of bone-in chicken and replaced the water with chicken broth. Everything else is as stated in the recipe. I have never had chicken paprikash before so I can't speak to the authenticity, but this recipe is great.

Everyone loved the chicken and the sauce. The only reason I gave it a 4 was becuase of the dumplings. I don't know if it was the recipe or if it was me, but we were not a fan of them.

Made this w/o the dumplings, husband isn't a fan, and turned out great!  Served it over egg noodles.  I made it with the regular store paprika b/c I was out of my sweet Hungarian.  Really wish I had that paprika would have brought out the flavors more.  Other then that this recipe was wonderful!

a decent start.  MUST drain fat from pan before adding onions.  We did not like the bones and skin in this dish, so i plan to use boneless skinless and bite sized pieces of chicken in the future.  i also left the onion in strips instead of chopping it but i wish i hadn't.  finally, i think the flour should be added to the pan and cooked a bit before adding the sour cream.  it makes 4 HUGE servings, imo.

I did something wrong and the sauce began to separate but not even that could ruin this dinner. Boiled the dumplings in chicken broth.  Made them a little too big so I will change that next time. Both kids loved it also

Delicious, with a couple of things taken out: most importantly, the dumplings. I followed the recipe exactly, and the dumplings were dense and tasteless.  There's plenty of AMAZING sauce in this recipe to cover the chicken and more, so next time, I'm making it with rice.  1/4 cup butter seemed like a lot to me for browning the chicken, and it made the sauce greasy in a bad way.  (Trust me, I love a good rich sauce).  Try half that much butter, or whatever quantity butters the pan generously.  All in all, I can't wait to make this again. Scrumptious.

I've tasted this dish in a restaurant and it with pure bliss...so I've been looking for a good recipe since.  Gave this a try and it was not good.  No one in my household liked it.  The dumplings weren't fluffy and the sauce tasted like warm sour cream with a dash of paprika.  :(

I made this tonight having nothing to compare it to, as I'm not Hungarian and never had this before ... but it was fabulous! My husband liked it too. Because he hates onions, I left those out but it really didn't need them. The dumplings are a bit of trouble, but it was fun and different! (P.S. I'm making it again tonight, this time with egg noodles ... MUCH easier!)

My grandparents were Hungarian and the recipe that was handed down in our family was very simular to this one. It is important to use good paprika. Hungarian Paprika is best. If your recipe is turning out bland it could be because of the Paprika you are using. :)

I've been making my mother's traditional Hungarian Chicken Paprikas (with tomatoes, green peppers, and a hint of hungarian sausage) for years. My own family prefers this one - it is simple and delicious! I did need to add more chicken broth (instead of plain water) as it evaporated during the cooking process, I also added a small can (8oz) tomato sauce before adding the sour cream mix.  This is a really quick meal if made with boxed dried Spaetzle (found in the pasta or ethnic foods grocery aisle) - not as good as homemade granted, but very tasty non-the-less when making dinner after a long work day. BTW - its gotta be real Hungarian Paprika!

I thought this recipe was okay, not bad, not great, just okay.  It was blander than I thought it would be.  My husband liked it and the kids ate it (didn't complain but didn't rave about it) but I thought it was bland.  I did make sure I bought the Hungarian paprika and I added more than the 1tsp recommended.

This is one of our family favorites.  We use chicken broth rather than water and also include about half a bell pepper, chopped.  I prefer a red pepper.  We skip the dumplings and serve with mashed potatoes instead. Just our preference.

Great recipe...this has been in my family for years.  The first time I made it for my husband he snubbed his nose at the site of it, but when he tasted it he now will not eat any other recipe.  DELICIOUS were his exact words.

This was a good quick dinner.  I tried to lower the calorie count by serving it over pasta instead of making the dumplings.  I also substituted boneless skinless chicken breasts cut up, used much less butter and used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 plain greek yogurt.  Since people commented on the chicken being bland, I first used seasoned pepper and a little salt before browning it.  I also used chicken stock instead of water.  It definitely had a kick to it, but my family liked the extra pepper.

Very delicious! I used chicken breast and cut it into bite sized pieces. I think I made the dumplings a bit too big - they expand a bit when boiled. Still wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.

Instead of using water, used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup.  Used both Hungarian and regular paprika, 4 large boneless chicken breasts cubed (instead of bone in) and added some sliced fresh mushrooms (8 ounces).  Skillet cooked the chicken with Hungarian paprika.  Skillet cooked the onion and mushrooms separately from chicken in butter (2 tablespoons) with regular paprika.  Threw everything in a pot (including dumplings) and added the 2 cans of soup and then mixed in more seasoning and the sour cream.  This was amazing!!!

A hit in my home!! I made this for my family & my picky children (11, 12 & 17 yrs old) asked me to rate it 4 stars. They all agreed it was delicious but only problem was recipe does not make enough sauce. I pre-cooked my chicken in my slow cooker so it would fall off the bone. I also used egg noodles, but will be trying it next time with white rice. But this was a very easy recipe to make. Will definitely be making this more often, but will double sauce recipe. Thanks for such a good & simple recipe.

I looked over many chicken paprikas recipes and tried this one because it didn't include tomatoes. That's the way my Hungarian mom made it and hers was always wonderful.

I used chicken broth instead of  water and drumsticks.  Plus, you really need to "proof" the sour cream before adding it. Mix some of the hot sauce into it & stir until smooth; otherwise it'll be lumpy. Turned out just like my mom used to make!

I have made this several times now. My family LOVES it. I personally follow the recipe pretty closely, but tastes vary widely in my family. Some smother the dish with  cheddar cheese...some add bacon bits. It doesn't matter as this is one dish that everyone agrees on! (In my home; that's rare! A+!

Delicious!  The only thing I would change is to add a little leavening to the dumplings.  Ours were either too big, or they needed something to fluff them up a little.  The flavor of the entire dish was spectacular and I'm keeping this in my file to make again.

Made the  recipe to a T, except I used the hungarian paprika instead of regular.  I was very disappointed.  I've had this dish before, which was made by my hungarian friend and it didn't taste the same. The traditional is way way better.   I'd rather eat it with white meat, and a lighter fluffier dumpling.  I found the dumplings in this recipe were too stiff and dense.

This was fantastic, even my 2 yr old liked it!  I used more like 2 or 2   1/4 pounds of chicken because I wanted leftovers and there was still PLENTY of sauce, I will always use 2 lbs of meat from now on.  I live in a 3rd world country and there is no sour cream, only creme fraiche, so I used that and it was still great.

I have used this recipe many times and love it. I used regular paprika the first couple of times until I finally found the Hungarian paprika...man what a difference! I don't make the dumplings, as I love mine with Spaatzel (recipe on this site has a 5 star rating)!

I've only eaten this once before making it today.  Except for using Hungarian paprika, I followed this recipe exactly. The chicken turned out tender and much to my surprise, the dumplings were not bland- they were very tasty. All of my family liked it so we added it to the "will make again" list.

I'm American Hungarian, and my mom made Chicken Paprikash at least once a week as a child growing up.  I consider it to be a family heirloom recipe.  Needless to say, this recipe is incredible and by far surpasses mom's.  (sorry mom).  
For this recipe, I substituted chicken stock for the water.  And for the chicken, I used rotisserie chicken from the supermarket.  And like mom, I quartered the onion and then sliced it.  I absolutely loved the dumplings on this one!  
Hats off for a most delicious and satisfying meal!

This was delicious! I stuck to the sauce recipe exactly and was so satisfied I could probably eat the sauce as soup! I made bisquick dumplings though just because I had no eggs on hand and they are so easy!

Delicious- I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing. I made with egg noddles and peas but next time I want to try it with creamy mash potatoes.

Very good sauce except toooo much pepper! I will use half the amount next time. I used my Mother-in-laws dumpling recipe cause it's the best... Bring pot of water to a boil, not a rolling boil. Mix together    1 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup water, 2 eggs, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp baking powder. Let rest for 5 min. Drop with 2 teaspoons by scraping into water and cook for 15 min. Add to chicken and sauce after you drain!!! DELICIOUS

This was okay.  Everyone but me loved it.  Not sure what all the excitement is about.  I bought freshly ground Hungarian paprika.  I followed the recipe to a T and it tastes like the paprika.  The people at work thought it was excellent - "restaurant quality" one lady said..  I guess I expected more of a zing.  :-)  Just not my cup of tea.

The chicken and sauce on this recipe was great! I will definitely make it again. The only thing I will change are the dumplings... they were way too hard and a bit salty. I think next time I will use a much lighter, fluffier dumpling.

I absolutly love this sauce! I made it with chicken legs so it was hard to eat the chicken without getting messy. Will try with some boneless chicken next time. The only thing I would change would be not to cook the dumplings too long. I only cooked them for five minutes but that was still too long. They turned out quite tough but the taste of that great sauce made up for them.

I used chicken breast to cut down on the fat and cooked the chicken in a pressure cooker because I was short on time. 
We prefer things a bit more spicy so I more than doubled the paprika (I tasted it and felt it needed more) and added a couple of dashes of cayenne, just enough to get a little snap. 
I also substituted chicken stock for the water. 
Without these changes I felt it would be slightly bland for us.

Made this with chicken breast and hungarian paprika. Served it over egg noodles instead of the dumplings. Everyone LOVED it! Easy to make, delicious, plenty of sauce to ladle onto your starch of choice.

My Mom and Grandma made this and was delicious. Gave 4 star as I prefer stewing hen or mature hen. Hungarian paprika (sweet) is a must. Use mature hens and after browned simmer in water over low heat for 11/2 to 2 hours until tender. Cook dumplings in the stewed chicken at the end. Saute onions add paprika and fry a bit. Add with sour cream or whipping cream at the end.

I loved this!  I have never made dumplings before, so I may have to get the hang of making them a little better.  One thing to do is make sure you make the dough small when dropping into water and also cook it longer then 10 minutes.  Mine didn't quite get done all the way through.  Maybe I should not have added all the flour so it wasn't as stiff as a dough?   Despite that it was fabulous!

I'm not sure the Hungarian paprika made a difference, but it was tasty. The dumplings were kind of dry and weird. Might do kluski noodles next time as someone suggested.

Because so many reviewers mentioned using specifically Hungarian paprika, I made a special trip to get some and got sweet paprika.  Recipe was okay, but a little boring.  I'll probably add some hot sauce to the leftovers.  A friend told me there is sweet AND hot paprika.  I'd be interested in knowing which one the other cooks used.

Even though I personally did not enjoy this recipe, my family loved it, including my Polish mother-in-law. She said it reminded her of home. I found it rather bland but as long as my wife and mother-in-law liked it I will have to give it at least four stars.

A SOLID 4-Star dish!  Just one more tasty dish to add to your repertoire.  Something to use as a change of pace and different taste.  Let's face it, you don't use egg noodles every day and this gives you that alternative starch, instead of making the dumplings.

I've been making this for years, since I ate it at a Hungarian restaurant in Toledo in the 70's. It's my husband's and both daughters' favorite, To save time,I usually serve it over tuxedo orzo. To save calories, I use about a TB of olive oil, then add the onions, add all the spices when they are softened, and then the chicken. I don't add water or flour anymore, though. I remove the chicken    to a heated plate, then boil the liquid down to about 1/4 cup, turn off the heat and add light sour cream or plain yogurt (make sure it's not sweet) and blend it. Then add the chicken and turn to coat it. If you like it spicy, use smoked paprika. It's really good and authentic tasting.

My paternal grandparents came over from Hungary and this was one of her signature dishes.  I still make it today.  My grandmother used a lot more paprika and onions and no black pepper.  She used sweet paprika with a touch of hot version.  She put the batter on a plate and cut off bite sized noodles with a knife, dipping it in water often to keep the batter from sticking.  It's much faster than the spoon thing.  For maximum flavor I use dark meat and add chicken stock to the water.

This recipe was very good and turned out just like was described. I was not real fond of the dumplings though (but my husband liked them) so if I make this again I will skip the dumplings and make mashed potatoes to put the yummy sauce over. A wonderful way to make chicken!

I thought this recipe sounded really good but have to say it was way too dull tasting.  I made the dumplings and cooked them separately in a pot for 20 minutes.  I boiled the chicken first and cooked the dumplings in the broth from the chicken, they floated to the top and thought they were cooked.  They were so hard when I pulled them out of the broth, terrible they were.  Would not make this recipe again

I added sliced mushrooms, and frozen chopped mixed peppers to saute, thickened the sauce more, then added the chicken which was cooked and chopped into smaller pieces before adding reduced mixture into soft tortilla shells.  Came out really good.

My mother's side of the family is Hungarian--I grew up on this dish.  3 of my 4 children always choose it as their special "birthday dinner".  I was taught to make it using cayenne pepper to give it some "attitude".  You can adjust the amount to your own taste.  It is also good made with plain balkan style yogurt instead of sour cream (for the dieters).  It gives it a delicious tang!

Excellent.  We loved this dish so much!  Our modifications included 1/2 of the sour cream listed (substituted milk and flour), shredding the chicken, and adding button mushrooms.

I used 1 whole boneless-skinless breast cut in half long ways and cooked per the recipe until it was 150-155 degrees.  When it was time to pull the chicken out I cut it into large but bitesize pieces and put it back in the sauce for 1-2 minutes to heat it back up when the sauce was almost finished reducing.  I also added a bit more salt, pepper, and paprika to taste at the end.  The sauce was absolutely awesome and the chicken was moist and flavorful.

I changed it slightly by adding the onion,paprika, and sour cream mixture to the chicken.I also doubled the butter. My husband is Czech and that's how they serve it. On top of the gonchi"dumplings"Other wise everything was fabulous!

I found this dish to be very rich, and fairly tasteless. I think it was due to the fact that I used 'mild paprica' powder however, so I will rate this 4/5. I might try it again, however I will make sure to use more spices in the future.

I really wanted to try this recipe since I love dumplings and comfort food. I did exactly as the recipe called for and I was really bummed with the way everything turned out. Since I used chicken legs with the skin on, they skin became soggy and too slimy to eat. And the sauce calls for too much onion and doesn't make very much if your like me and like to lather your food with the sauce/gravy.

It was really nice and the recipe was great, but I think next time I will thicken the sauce slighty more or add tomato chunks.  Overall it was lovely and I served it with fusilli as a bit of improvisation.

Liked  the dish! Only thing I would change would be a different  dumpling(or maybe I did something wrong) they seemed too dense and heavy. Otherwise my  family  liked it. (I did use 2 tblspn of Hungarian Paprika 1 sweet & 1 spicy)   Thank you for sharing

Kids enjoyed it and said they’d eat it again. It’s not super flavorful. I added lots of pepper, added more paprika, but didn’t use butter. I’ll step up my paprika to true Hungarian stuff and add a dash of cayenne or hit paprika next time.

This recipe is amazing, my brother doesn't care for the tangy flavour of  sour cream, so I substituted that with heavy cream in its place. Came out perfect. This is definitely something I will make again.

This recipe is DELICIOUS BUT you MUST use HUNGARIAN paprika!! I don’t like to review modified recipes- but I did substitute chicken breasts and I added a little more salt. Other than that did it as it was written and it was amazing! Will definitely redo. Note- you can also also shred the chicken and mix it in to feed more. YUM!!

Looks great, smells great... However I wasn’t thrilled, nor were the wife and kids. First time making dumplings so could just be me eh?

It was a hit with my girls.  I'll definitely have it again.  One mistake I made was buying whole bone in chicken breasts.  Just seemed a little too big for my pan.  It was good but next time I'll try smaller pieces of chicken.  Maybe thighs or mixed pieces.

Delicious! I used chicken broth instead of water, as recommended in several other reviews.

Excellent!  Everyone in my family loved it.  Plan to serve it to guests. I made the dumplings while chicken cooked in sauce and took them out of water while they were hot and added to the sauce. First time I made it, I made dumplings too large. Second time I scooped the dough up in a teaspoon and they were perfect.

I followed recipe  exactly except I subbed chx broth for water. Just wasn’t amazing.  I even added more Hungarian paprika but still wasn’t amazed. Kids ate it and it got the job done but won’t make again.

I made this strictly by the book and it couldn't be blander especially the dumplings.  A spicier paprika and spice additives to the dumplings would help immensely.  I will give it another go, but with my improvements.

Made this recipe exactly as written and it was great! I actually surprised 2 people who are czech & hungarian and they raved how good it was. We'll keep this on our rotation and look fwd to the next time we enjoy this.
I am one of the people he made this for and it was so similar to what Grandma used to make. She used bone in chicken (what a mess) this was boneless skinless dark meat and hungarian smoky paprika, perfect!

Made it exactly first steps remind me of growing up but wasn't crazy about the sour cream in it.  I am going to remake it and use my dumpling recipe for it and omit the sour cream.  it wasn't bad just need to tweak it to our liking more.

This is a good recipe that Ill make again.  Next time Ill  heat it up a bit with some pepper flakes or a little jalapeno and wont make quite so many dumplings as we had a lot left over.  The gravy is really good and would probably go well with mashed potatoes, too

My "five kopiykas" to the discussion: 
Add a tea spoon of Paprika to batter. 
The raw dumpling  should be no bigger than the last phalanx of the small finger (I myself have no such manual dexterity) 
My auntie who lived in Budapest didn't add  sour cream to paprikash at all((( (though I have nothing at all against sour cream)

This was delicious and I will definitely make it again! Love the flavor! The major things I changed was like the other reviewers, use chicken broth for everything instead of water and it's more flavorful like that. And I used skinless, boneless chicken breasts - saves some fat that way. I ended up cutting the dumplings to make them smaller after they were cooked as a personal preference. Be advised that the dumplings are time-consuming and you should do them in batches. Interesting thoughts from my husband and daughter - they thought the sauce tasted like a cheese sauce so I guess if you like cheese you'll probably like it. I just know that it was very tasty. My husband was watching me lick that sauce off the spoon when cleaning up! I'm sure it was delicious even without the changes. Thanks for sharing Erin!

I made this for dinner tonight-sans the dumplings, using egg noodles instead.  It was way too spicy hot for me.  My husband liked it, but also thought it was a bit spicy.  He did eat seconds though!!!

My Grandmother (from across the pond) also made this for us when we visited.  The only difference she made was putting carrots in with the chicken and covering it with broth (instead of water) to finish cooking the chicken.  I later decided to add 1 tsp of baking soda to the dumpling mix to make them more fluffy as a personal preference.  Even without the slight changes this dish should be a fave with the family.

Made this yesterday and found it less savory than I remembered. Followed the recipe but made the following changes per other reviewers: 
1. Doubled the paprika.
2. Added about 1 tsp of minced garlic.
Leftovers today were more tasty.
I will make again and tweak a bit more.

NOTE: These "dumplings" are much more like spatzle, which are a dense noodle-like dish. A Hungarian grandmother taught me the 2-spoon method of preparing but I now have a spatzle maker...an inexpensive tool which resembles a grater with a sliding container to hold the dough. (Try amazon or other kitchenware dealers). This recipe produced perfect spatzle with this!

Made as written except used chicken stock instead of water.  Followed other writer who recommended putting the flour directly in the broth in the end to thicken it instead of the sour cream.  Added a small amount of cayenne pepper after to add some heat.   Absolutely delicious!

I made the dish the way it was written. I taste as I go and found that the dish was way to bland. I doubled the paprika, salt and pepper but it was still bland. I then added a little chicken bouillon along with more salt and pepper but still couldn't get it to taste great. The consensus was that the recipe has potential and was a good base to work off of , but it definitely needs more seasoning. The guys added some cayenne pepper and said that helped.

Easy, good, fairly quick. Definitely use Hungarian paprika. I've settled on a mix of 1 tsp hot and 2 tsp sweet. All tsp are rounded so the final result is at least 4 tsp of paprika. The sauce should be deeply colored ( which means you get lots of that wonderful paprika flavor). I serve with noodles or dumplings or rice or farro or.... You get the idea, something that will soak up that yummy sauce.

This is really a good basic recipe.  With my Matka and Babcia gone, I could not remember how to make it.  I remember the flour dumplings(you can also use rye flour)..but cant remember the rest

Remember this is a stew, so it can be slkow cooked in a crock pot.

It's a great starter recipe.

Thoughts on how to make it better:
Dumplings: add 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp onion powder to the recipe.

Sauce/liquid: 1/2 to 1 teaspoon HOT Hungarian Paprika and 1/2 teaspoon  SMOKED paprika
1 teaspoon thyme
2 medium onions or 1 LARGE onion.

Sour Cream: mix the flour in very well and let stand in the sour cream for 5-10 minutes as it helps with the mix.  You're actually making a thickened cream sauce.

**Note: for those folks who cannot have wheat or rye flour thickeners, you can use "Thicken Up" products and use the amount needed for pudding consistency.

I quartered a whole chicken, sautéed onion & paprika & Lawry's.  Added in Boxed chicken broth.  As the water was coming to a boil for the dumplings, I was eating the delicious chicken.   The dumplings with the chicken & sauce were as good as it gets...   I will surely make this again.   quick, easy, and delicious...

I didn't bother with the dumplings.  I instead served it over egg noodles.  It was wonderful!  I also took the skin off the meat and braised it that way.  I also substituted white wine for the chicken broth and it was so good.  Will definitely make this again.  Not for you if dieting!!

This is a great recipe, but needed a couple tweaks. As some reviewers noted, I used chicken stock instead of water and added some half sharp hungarian paprika (Penzy's) along with the sweet.  I did skip the dumplings and just served it over noodles.  This is going into my recipe rotation.  Reminded me of home.

This is a very flavorful and inexpensive meal.  I made this twice and made a couple of changes, which improved it for me.  First, I lightly covered the chicken with paprika before I fried them.  That gave them more color and added flavor.  Second, I cut the dumpling recipe by 1/3rd, as the dumplings overwhelmed the dish.  I love the dumplings, by the way--they are awesome.  Third, I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream.  It's healthier and has a bit more bite.

This was my first time making this recipe.  Would have given it 5 stars but  had to change a couple of things.  1 1/2 cups of liquid was not nearly enough to make enough gravy and that's the best part!!  I added a ton more Paprika to make the coloring more orange like my grandmas.  Lastly, I think it needs more sour cream or something so it's not so bland.  I remember my grandmas seem to have more "zip" to the flavor.  Over all it was a good recipe.  I made it with potato gnocchi and those were good!!  I will definitely make it again

Made exactly as the recipe says just used chicken broth instead of water and also added 1tsp Cajun seasoning. Delicious!

This is one of my favourite meals to make. Only thing I do differently is I use chicken stock in place of water and I double all the ingredients for the sauce because it's almost the best part!!! My husband and my extremely picky 4 year old love this meal as well.

Good basic recipe. I added 1/2 a finely chopped red bell pepper to it, which is closer to the true Hungarian version my husband's grandmother made.

First time with this dish in general, thought it was great! Used chicken stock instead of water as I saw another reviewer suggested.
I made a double batch - doubled all except the dumplings. Very yummy, thanks for sharing!

I made this using a few suggested changes from other reviewers. I used chicken broth, I made the dumplings small like noodles,  and I didn't mix the flour in with the sour cream because I was worried about bringing sour cream to a boil.  Instead I mixed the flour with extra water and mixed some of the hot liquid to the flour water and when it was hot stirred it into the liquid and then stirred until it was thick. I then added the sour cream to the sauce. 

My husband and one daughter really liked it and want me to make this again. I liked it, but  while the sauce was delicious on it's own, I thought it was a little bland and didn't flavor the noodles or chicken enough, but that could be my fault. The recipe didn't say whether or not to cover the chicken while it cooked in the liquid so I kept it uncovered and most of my liquid boiled away. I was concerned there wouldn't be enough sauce so I added another cup of water.  

I'll make this again and try cooking the chicken covered next time.

I hate to change a recipe but I did use chicken broth instead of water.  This recipe is delicious!!!  I did use my own Peppered Spaetzle recipe instead of the dumplings but think this would be so good even with mashed potatoes.  I will make this again but will continue to use the chicken broth as it just has more flavor.

I have made this dish twice now.  Once on the stove top and once in my slow cooker.  The first time I followed the recipe as written. While  authentic Chicken Paprikash has a bold,rich paprika flavor, this was a little bland as written but good nonetheless. The second time I made this,  I substituted chicken broth for the water, added 4x the amount of Hungarian Smoked Paprika, and added garlic and mushrooms.  It was AMAZING!  

I grew up eating Chicken Paprikash but my mother always put a German spin on it by serving it over fresh Spaetzle. The dumplings in this recipe are great however, the second time I made this  I served it over homemade Spaetzle.  My family preferred the Spaetzle over the dumplings. 

I accompanied this dish with homemade traditional Hungarian Langos (fried potato bread) and a cucumber onion and dill salad "Gurken Salat".  

My guests could not stop raving about this meal!!! FYI...super easy in the slow cooker.

It was ok. I wouldn't make this again. Changes I made was adding garlic & seasoned salt after adding the chicken to the pan. I used chicken broth instead of water.

My family loves this recipe! We like to coat the chicken with flour, salt and paprika. We double the sauce, add 3 cubes chicken bouillon, and temper the sour cream before adding it to the paprikash!

delicious! added a packet of chicken boullion, cayenne, and touch of smoked paprika in addition to the TBSP of reg. paprika. Will make american style lite fluffy dumplings or use egg noodles next time tho. not crazy about the dense thick chewy texture of these. Maybe i did something wrong? ??? Still was yummy!! Also I boiled the chicken legs and removed from bone, used the broth instead of water, and mixed the meat into the sauteed onion, spice, and butter mixture ....just made sense. Listened to some Hungarian Music while I cooked the Paprikash for a life enriching experience as well.

I always add extra onion & chicken thighs, just because it's my preference . This time I made a mistake and forgot the sour cream. I had to go to a convenience store because it was late when I realized & the dish was for a work party. They didn't have sour cream, but they did have French onion dip. It was wonderful.

good with changes as suggested by others... stir the sour cream in before serving, as sour cream breaks when heated. I've altered my family recipe by removing the skin from the chicken (it gets flabby during the brazing)I dust the chicken lightly with flour and brown it in with the paprika, salt pepper and oil then ad chicken stock to braze. I remove my dumplings from the boiling pot after a 10-minute boil and put them into my large pan with the chicken. The starch from the dumplings helps to thicken the sauce.

To save myself some time, I served over egg noodles instead of doing the dumplings.  It was a great substitute, though we did have a bit too much sauce (I will scale the water back if I do it this way again).

I make this all of the time now.  My advise is to follow the recipe.  The dumplings can be cooked in chicken stock for flavor.  I prefer the bone in chicken because it seems that there is a lot of water in the boneless packs.  It's just my opinion, but the bone in kind browns up better for this recipe.  I have read up extensively on this and I say you Must get the Hungarian kind, but both work.  For the recipe, I use double the recommended paprika... its the feature of the dish and its delish.

My mother always used to add fresh garlic and green pepper slices along with the sliced onions.  Makes it a little bolder.  She learned the recipe from a Hungarian friend in the Detroit area in the early 60's.  (Who also insisted "It is better if the chicken is stolen". ;-)

This was the first time I've ever ate dumplings, I think. Turns out, I don't like em! ; )

But the GF likes dumplings and said they were great!!!!
But since I do the cooking around here, I'll serve the chicken over noodles or rice next time.

The chicken was absolutely incredible! I kept looking into the pan every few minutes and couldn't believe how great it looked and smelled!
Every few minutes, I would ladle some of the onion sauce mixture onto the chicken

I will DEFINITELY use this recipe again!!!
Thank you!!!

Great sauce!  Definitely use bone-in chicken, otherwise, flavor your boneless chix before frying.  At the restaurant I went to, they had red bell pepper in their sauce and garnished finely diced red bellppepper.

Simply amazing! The first time I made this I used regular paprika and it was bland. The second time I used Hungarian Paprika and I couldn't stop eating. I made a few changes. I'm not a fan of dumplings so I skipped those. I added diced carrots, celery, and minced garlic with the onions & cooked separately because I wasn't sure how long it would take to cook the vegetables down. I also used chicken breasts and shredded them after they were finished cooking. Mmmmmmmm. This recipe does not disappoint.

I made this the other night and my kids and husband loved it. I used yogurt instead of sour cream and i missed the step about mixing the flour and cream. For this the look of the dish suffered but it was still good.

I thought this was very good.  I used 4 boneless chicken breasts.  The dumpling batter was really thick so I ended up using my dough hook on my mixer.  I then rolled it out really thin and cut into small bites using a pizza cutter.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I'd make it again. It has a mellow flavor so I might add more paprika next time.

I used bacon drippings instead of butter and chicken broth instead of water and thank God I did, that was about the only flavor I had in this dish.  I might try it again with the "real" paprika instead of the McCormick's I had on hand but this took a lot of time and I didn't find it particularly delish.

This was very yummy!  I did add extra butter and followed other reviewer's advice and used chix broth instead of water.  I added garlic with the onions like in other reviews.  I thought the dumplings were way to dense - next time I'll use at least half a cup less flour (not sure if it is the climate or what but it was really tough to get the 2 1/2 cups mixed in). I may also add some cayenne next time too to give it a little bit of heat. I finished the chix in the oven at 375 instead of just keeping it warm.  However this was soooo good, I'll definitely be putting it in the rotation.

Very good.  I used boneless breasts chopped into chicken chunks and it was really good.  The flavor needs to be stronger and it would be perfect for me.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe!  It had a very good spice level and was pretty easy to make.  I was pleased with how the dumplings came out.  Only changes was that I chopped up the chicken and used boneless thighs.

A fast, easy dish, and I did make the spatzel dumplings. Sauce for chicken needs something--more spices and garlic? Overall, very good.

I made this for the first time, for my Hungarian husband's birthday. It was good, but I think I should've left out the sour cream and just topped the dishes with it, as it gave a weird texture to the sauce. The dumplings came out great, as my husband and I couldn't stop snacking on them haha! It didn't taste quite right, so maybe I will add some tomatoes or tomato paste to the sauce and add full fat cream (since sour cream is a North American thing). Definitely good tasting though!

really good. dont cook the dumpling stuff too long because otherwise it gets really hard. even if it doesnt look done drain it as soon as the minutes are done with what they say on the recipe. the flavor was wonderful and it hit all the right taste buds.

To save time, I cooked skinless  boneless chicken breast beforehand. I used noodles, as I didn't want my dumplings to fall apart in the water. I also threw some frozen peas in with the noodles, to get some veggies in the meal. I lastly used greek yogurt in place of sour cream; same consistency and it's healthier. 
Good lunch, but salt, pepper and paprika zipped it up.

This recipe is excellent. I added 1 chicken bullion cube with the water.  The onion and butter made this just wonderful.  Use Hungarian paprika!  I made the dumplings and they were ok, next time
I will serve over wide egg noodles or spaetzel. I especially liked this because it did not taste salty.

I'm a foodie, my husband is not.  He had seconds, and then some, which is NOT TYPICAL at all!  This dish is very good and reminds me of my beloved Aunt Jan's dish (she's passed on and I don't have her recipe). I don't understand some reviewer's comments on "bland". Perhaps they did not use butter and skin-on, bone-in chicken, and real sour cream.  I used broth made from jarred chicken base so I reduced the salt (sea salt) to 1/4 t, used a cup or more of frozen chopped onion, freshly ground pepper, fresh Hungarian paprika, and added a little water from the wide egg noodles (I did not make the dumplings) to the sauce because my chicken wasn't done to at specified time so the liquid reduced further (which in turn, would have concentrated the flavors more). I had also stirred my flour into the onion mix to make a roux, then added the sour cream.  It was an error on my part, but in retrospect, probably a good one because that would have pulled flour taste out (something I do when making any gravy).

This was really wonderful.  I did make a few minor changes which did not affect the spirit of the recipe.  I had a couple of pork chops which I used instead of chicken.  I saw that a number of other reviewers had substituted some sort of stock for water.  I had boiled some ribs for Labor Day and had some leftover stock from that.  And I was not about to do all the work to make the dumplings, so I used wide noodles.  My guests and I were delighted with this recipe and I will be making it again.

This was pretty good after I tweaked the original recipe ever so slightly. I followed the recipe for the paprikash but only used half the sour cream & threw in two bay leaves. I also added mushrooms and 2 cloves garlic to the pan when I sauteed the onions.
 The dumplings were gummy and tasteless, so I added cracked black pepper, a pinch of cayenne, and a little parmesean. I also recommend using self rising flour. 
Ill make it again as the left overs are even better the next day!

Absolutely delicious flavor. After reading reviews I went and bought some Hungarian paprika and followed recipe as written with the exception of increasing the amout of sauce. Found dumplings a little on the heavy side but overall an excellent meal. Will make again for sure.

delicious!  it's amazing as it is, but except for special occassions, I'll make via a variation that's a tad healthier -- boneless/skinless chicken thighs and fat free sour cream served over egg noodles.  yum!

I did use Hungarian Paprika, and the sauce was fairly tasty. However, the "dumplings" (and I use that term loosely) were hard, flavorless lumps that even a liberal coating of sauce could not salvage.

My husband gets off work at 3:30, and I, 5:00.  He usually wants dinner right away.  I re-heated pot roast for him, while I made this chicken paprikash for my dinner and leftovers.  He ate all his pot roast and veggies, half of my paprikash and asked for another bowl of paprikash.  He LOVES it!  Best recipe ever and quick!!!  I used Hungarian Paprika and pre-cut chicken strips (pre-cut for fajitas in grocerery meat section).  Used 3.5 pounds of chicken and doubled the recipes...thank goodness I did!  He just said "that's the best I've ever had...(eat that ex-wife)  lol. (she use to make it too, but not this recipe) ;)  Life is good!

Wonderful! Fast favorite for years... For super quick version, just use grilled chicken from grocery store or leftover turkey meat ( make the sauce, add the bird, mix, enjoy!!)

I made this recipe on the weekend and the chicken was great but the dumplings were terrible.  Ended up making my own dumplings.  I have never used eggs in a dumpling recipe before and these were very heavy and tasteless.  Any suggestions.

I have been looking for this recipe for years.  The dumplings need to be small or they don't cook thru and the onions should be chopped fine.  Also, chopped fresh parsley is a nice boost to the dumplings.  Just wonderful!  Thanks.

This  was amazing!  My whole family and guests licked the plate!  I made it exactly to the recipe.  If you want it to be good, you MUST use the bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces.  Yes it is very fattening but that is what gives it wonderful flavor.  If you make it with de-boned breasts don't expect it to be as good.  The dumplings sounded odd but they were really really tasty!   A total keeper!
