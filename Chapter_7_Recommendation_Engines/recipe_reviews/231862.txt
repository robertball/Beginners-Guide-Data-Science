Great recipe: simple but delicious. (I'm no fan of olive oil to cook with, so I used butter. Worked fine.)

I just made this and followed the simple directions to the letter using very fresh cod. This was bland and tasteless. I cook salmon regularly in a similar way, but with cod this method infuses very little, if any flavor.

I am sorry I cooked the fish this way. I suggest making a glaze or pan sauce if you like your food to be flavored to try and rescue this dull recipe,

Clean up is easy,

We tried this and it and liked it a lot. The only thing we did differently was to put the fish in a pan rather than on foil, because the acidity in the lemons can react badly with foil.

This was a super easy dinner to make, and no dish to clean made it a hit with me!  I cooked this on the grill in the packets so I didn't even heat up the house.  They took less time to grill.  Plan on 12 to 18 minutes of cooking time, depending on the thickness of your cod.  I love cod for its mild, delicate flavor.  I was not a huge fan of the garlic in this recipe or I would have given it 5 stars.  Otherwise, a great dinner!  Thanks!

This is a tasty way to prepare cod, or any white fish.  I misread the recipe and put the garlic under the lemon, which made it rather strong.  It did take more like 30 minutes for my fish to bake and it could have used another 5 minutes, so I suggest you start checking at 20 minutes, but be prepared for it to take longer.  Nice recipe, Cinderella, thanks!

Good "clean" GF, Egg free dish that was easy and good for weeknight cooking  with  quick clean up! Not amazing, but pretty good. I made with fresh lemon and freeze-dried chives and garlic.

This was my first fish recipe ever, I made this for my in-laws and husband. In all honesty I didn't like but it was through no fault of the recipe I just learned I was not a cod fan. The ones I made this for, who are big cod fans LOVED it, it was a huge hit and I've already been asked to make it again next time it's my turn to cook. The only change I made was to add a splash of Pinot Grigio to each packet. Obviously I'll be making it again.

I didn't want to make packets so I made it in a 9x13 pan.  I covered it in foil and cooked it for 15-20 minutes.  Then I took the foil off and browned it a few minutes, until done.  It tasted great!  I'll make it again and continue to experiment.

Very quick and easy to make, but lacked flavor. I didn't use the olive oil. I just lightly sprayed the foil with butter spray. I loved how quick it was to make, but would add stronger flavors next time.

IT WAS SO BITTER. I used fresh thick-skinned lemons to make it. I did know that the white pith on citrus fruits is what makes them bitter, and I did wonder about it when adding my thick-skinned lemon slices to the fish, but I followed the recipe. It never occurred to me to peel the lemons. I am not so discouraged that I would never try making this recipe again, but I would surly PEEL THE LEMONS.

This was a great and simple dish to whip up together. I've used Aldi's frozen Wild Caught Alaskan cod. I've  made one tweak to it--instead of lemon and garlic slices, I've used lemon juice and minced garlic to top my cod. Delish! I'll make it again someday.

Made it without the chives, but added more garlic. Turned out great! Even my wife loved it, and she normally doesn't eat fish. This is a keeper.

This was surprisingly good to me - sans the garlic. I was on a low-calorie diet with limited food options. This was perfect, easy and tasty.

I WILL make it again. I used frozen (thawed) cod fillets that were not very big so used two to a piece of foil. I think next time I will squeeze a little of the lemon juice on the fish before cooking.
But really very good!

Followed the recipe exactly.  It was so easy and very tasty.  Will make again.
