This was just ok for me.  It needs a lot more zing!  The shrimp soaked up all the flavor and they were really good, but the pasta itself had almost no flavor and was pretty bland.  I probably won't be making this one again.

I didn't like this recipe at all.  It was very bland and plain.  Definately wouldn't make it again.

Very good but it really does need the 8 hours for the flavors to come together. We forgot to make it ahead and it was much better the second day.  Also we added some shreaded Parmesan cheese. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe had vegetables I had in my garden fresh. I used frozen shrimp and rotini pasta but the fresh veggies made it. I added the pasta and shrimp and it was ready to take to the patio on a hot evening.  Great!

This was perfect for our picnic at an outdoor concert.  I only let it sit for five hours and it was still wonderful.  My 21 month old loved it, though she spit out all the shallots, and my mother-in-law asked for the recipe.

A wonderful dish that would be great for a picnic or bar-b-que.  Very light and fresh tasting.This would be great on a hot summer day.

I love this salad!! In fact, I grow fresh basil every summer just for this recipe. It's delicious and fresh tasting, perfect for dinner on the patio.

I fixed this recipe in the late afternoon the other day and let it meld until the next evening.  It was fantastic.  My husband and I both like it very much and it was still very good the following day.  Definitely will make again.

I thought this recipe was just okay. I used freeze-dried shallots, which I think was a mistake. Regular onion probably would have been better and contributed to a fresher taste.

This recipe was pretty bland. I ended up adding more salt and pepper and even some lemon pepper to give it some flavor. If I make this recipe again, I will use some different spices and might even use cut up chicken that has been marinated instead.

This recipe is really great if you use a good quality sea salt, fresh dill, and avocado. As is was somewhat bland, but with a few minor tweaks it was awesome. 

I have also made this substituting the shrimp for salmon with good results.

This is delightful. I prepared it the night before and served it for a luncheon. For four people I halved everything except for the shrimp, served it up on a bed of lettuce, and still had some leftovers. "Soft Garlic Parmesan Breadsticks" submitted by Andi Flanagan on this website complimented the salad very nicely.
