Simple recipe. I altered it a little. I only used 1/2 cup of sugar.This recipe was plenty sweet just with the amount of sugar I used in it. I can't possibly imagine using 1 1/2 cups of sugar!  And I added cinnamon to the peaches and allspice to the batter. Also I used soy milk instead of regular milk. I cooked this recipe in a glass pan and it took about 20 minutes longer than what the original time calls for. The next time that I make this, I think I'll add vanilla to the batter like one of the other reviewers suggested. I tasted the batter before I put anythiing in it, and it tasted to dull. So play with your spices and doctor it up a little!

The initial appeal of this recipe was its simplicity and the fact that it called for low-fat margarine and skim milk.  In addition, as my husband is a diabetic, I substitued granular Splenda for the sugar - just followed the online Splenda info source (www.splenda.com) to add 1/2 tsp. of extra baking powder for every cup of Splenda used instead of sugar, and checked for earlier cooking time.  It turned out really well, except that the outcome was a little "paler' than it would have been with real sugar.  I suppose I can always sprinkle some sugar on top to add some color.

Also I added a tsp. of ground cinammon and vanilla as suggested by earlier reviewers. I will definitely make it again.

I saw all the good reviews and thought this would be tasty and easy to prepare.  Well, it was very easy.  It pretty much tasted like bread and butter with mushy peaches stuck in it.  Very disappointing, and a waste of ingredients.  Ice cream didn't even help it taste better.  Sorry...

Although this is not the most sophisticated peach cobbler recipe, it is a GOOD basic one to make...I added vanilla and cinnamon to the batter and was going to sprinkle with nuts but decided not to..maybe next time...cooking time was around 10 minutes longer than stated in the recipe maybe because I used a glass pan....good basic recipe...

This was such an easy recipe!  I was in a hurry and kind of screwed up and bought peaches in heavy syrup and completely forgot to put the milk in, but it still turned out great.  I love to bake, but I don't always like to put in the time and effort some baked goods require.  I love it when something labeled "quick and easy" turns out to taste really great, too.

This is a fast and good dish. Not the best peach cobbler, but I give it 5 stars just for the time and effort involved: all ingredients were on hand, 5 minutes to prepare and it was in the oven. Quick, easy, and tasty.

Quick and simple recipe and very tasty.  My wife ate the whole thing in two days so we will have to make again soon.  Cut the sugar to 1 cup and it was still fine.

I cut the recipe in half, used peaches from the backyard and almost burnt the thing, but it actually came out really well.

This was fast and very good.  I used 1 stick of butter because I don't use margarine.  I will probably cut down to 3/4 stick next time.  I used 4 cans of cheap store-brand peaches in light syrup, so I cut the sugar back to 1 cup, which was plenty sweet.  Everyone thought this was fresh peach cobbler LOL! I didn't let them know otherwise.  I forgot to add cinnamon to the ingredients, so I sprinkled some on top with a little sugar.  Great served with vanilla ice cream.  This is a keeper and is great because you can make it from pantry ingredients on short notice.

Really delicious. I used 2 cans fruit salad (took out the grapes and cherries)and a can of pineapple chunks(42oz in all)because I didn't have peaches. I mixed the fruit with 1tbsp vanilla, 2tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/4c brown sugar after reading it was bland and spooned it over the dough. I loved the way the dough crisped with the margarine. It was heavenly!

I have used this recipe numerous times over the yeas. Only I add 1 egg. Before putting in oven, sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon. Then carefully pour some of the fruit juice over all...bake. This is so good! I never fail to get rave reviews when I serve it. I also add vanilla.

Absolutely amazing! I wasn't at all sure how it would turn out since it's a "diet" dessert, but it was really great. I did tweak it a bit, like some of the other reviewers. I added 1t. cinnamon and 1/2t. nutmeg. Those spices together were absolutely perfect. It is a big doughy compared to most cobblers but the flavor is so great. And you don't have to prepare peaches! I'm going to be making this a regular in my kitchen. Thanks!

I use frozen peaches and all milk instead of milk/fruit juice in the batter, Which should not make that much difference in the dexture and flavor of the cobbler crust. This recipe has never failed me.

Great recipe! The best cobbler recipe I've come across! I did however add cinnamon to the crust mixture. Also I heated the peaches before adding them (and added some sugar and cinnamon to them as they heated ). My family loves it.

This was my first time ever making a peach cobbler. For years, I thouhgt peach cobbler was difficult to make. This recipe proved me wrong. This peach cobbler was delicious!! The only thing extra I added, was ground cinnamon to my peaches. My dad and friends loved it. The only thing I'll do differently next time, is serve it with vanilla ice cream.

Wonderful!  The things I did per previous reviews: 1t vanilla, 1/2 t nutmeg, 1t cinnamon in batter.  Sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Everyone LOVED this recipe and it is now "the dish" for family get-togethers, and I love how EASY it is.  Thank you!

I made this for my family and used the heavy syrup, and butter instead of margarine. I also sprinkled a touch of cinnamen, ginger, and nutmeg in the batter, and put a little ginger in with the peaches. I Sprinkled pralines ontop before baking, and cinnamen and sugar ontop afterwards. Mine came out a bit dry so I added the extra syrup ontop and it came out wonderfully moist!

made this for the first time today exactly according to the directions except I used real butter instead of margarine, and substituted 1/2c of blue agave nectar for that portion of the sugar. excellent, just the right amount of sweetness and crust!! I used a glass dish so I added 20 minutes more to the cooking time. next time I will try a couple of variations as per some of the other reviewers suggested. awesome recipe! thanks.

If you are having a dessert, go all the way.  Use real butter, cream, and fresh fruit.

Did not like it at all. It had good flavor, but was far too doughy.  We did not save it after one serving.

This recipe is awesome and easy!  I use splenda in order for it to be more sugar free for my diabetic parents.  I think it's even better with splenda!  I sprinkle on a little cinnamon on top for a little flare.

Half of my family loved it and the other half didnt like it at all. I dont think you can call this a cobbler, its more of a peach pudding. the consistency is jelly-like but the flavours are yummy.

Fantastic. Used a cup of sugar. Added a teaspoon of vanilla and a sprinkling of cinnamon to the batter; topped with some cinnamon, sugar, and walnuts. Everyone enjoyed it.

This was a lucious cobbler.  I cut the recipe in half and I'm glad I did because it really isn't as good the second day as the day it comes out of the oven piping hot and smelling so good.  Like others, I added vanilla and lots of cinnamon.  It's also a great recipe if you are dieting!

This recipe is simple  and delicious. I made it for 80 persons but did not use the low fat ingredients. I suggest adding some Cinnamon for more flavor but not too much. Be sure to use fresh bakeing powder!

Yummy! My son and I really enjoyed this recipe especially when it was warm out of the oven!  I used one large can of peaches and a 15 oz can, and I added nutmeg to the peaches.  On the top before baking I sprinkled on a mix of sugar and cinnamon.  Fantastic!

Highly recommend! Made this because I had the ingredients on hand. Substituted fresh peaches for canned, used Whole Wheat flour and added nutmeg. Cut the sugar in half and was perfect. Like other reviewers, baking time was much longer in my glass pan. Very good! DH loved it!!

I made this as an alternative to pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving. It was a hit!  There is still pumpkin pie left over, but the peach cobbler was gone before everyone left the table.  I will definately be making this again.

this was a great recipe. i actually doubled the dry ingredients and added a little more milk and peach juice because i like a bit of crust. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the top before baking and it came out perfect. served with vanilla ice cream and it was a big hit with the family! thank you :)

Wonderful and simple altho I did change it some. I used Splenda instead of sugar, wheat flour inside of white, fresh peaches and because I had no peach juice I used a little peach schnapps. Will make this again real soon. I have fresh peaches cut and hope to get some real juice. Thank you

I took this to a potluck for a bridal shower tonight and got rave reviews.  I used frozen peaches from last summer and will probably use more next time.  I like more fruit in my cobbler.  I microwaved the fruit and used the liquid like the recipe calls for and had just enough.  I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon but would add more next time.  It's a keeper!

Yummy!  I messed up the first time because I scaled it down, but didn't scale down the 1 cup of juice mentioned in the description.  I made it again, and boy...wonderful!  I did add vanilla and cinnamon to the batter like the other reviewers mentioned, and sprinkled the cinnamon and a little bit of sugar over top :)  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Because I only cook for myself, I cut this recipe in half. If you do this be sure to cut the amount of peach liquid to half (in the directions). I'm always looking for easy recipes.

This was REALLY good!  It was pretty cold last weekend and we wanted something sweet and warm but somewhat healthy.  I made this as written just swaping whole wheat flour for regular, and baking Splenda for sugar.  I also sprinkled a bit of Splenda brown sugar on top to brown it. And, as others suggested added some vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  We ate it warm with a little light ice cream.  My fiancee, who is anti-good for you food (fried chicken rice and gravy would be his meal everyday if possible) had two helpings of this he liked it so much!!  Thanks for a quick fix for our sweet tooth with out killing our diet!

I have made a bunch of peach cobblers before and I have always been unconvinced, but this was really good, even though I tried really hard to mess this up. I was having 6 for dinner so wanted to halve the recipe, no biggie until I forgot this when measuring ingredients for the batter and found I only had 3 cans of peaches and somehow persevered in putting this into the smaller dish I had planned to use.... managed to slide it into a bigger dish and pop it in the oven and it was fab!  It was quite difficult to wait until after dinner as it smelled fantastic as it cooked and looked great as it sat on the counter.  I did use only 1 cup of sugar - that was the only intentional change and it was great.

Loved this, but also thought it needed some "spicing up"  Added some fresh ground cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter along with some vanilla and ground some more cinnamon on top.  I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was plenty sweet.

I made this recipe yesterday for the Super Bowl, however instead of using 4 cans of peaches, I used 3 cans plus I filled one of the empty cans with frozen cherries. I also added cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg to the batter and cinnamon to the peach/cherry mixture.It was delicious!

This was very good, definitely a great "light" dessert.  I did add cinnamon and a tiny bit of nutmeg for extra flavor.  I think the vanilla suggestion is good, I might try that next time.

Super easy. Made for last minute potluck at work. Sister convinced me to make this since she had all ingredients to make. I didn't want to show up with it, but it ended up being the talk of the crowd. I personally have disliked peach cobbler since a kid; here I am a 30-year-old and this recipe totally changed my mind forever. Must I say it was super easy and ingredients are super cheap. Sister is now begging me to make and I just finish it the eve of Thanksgiving! (second time making)

I will keep using this amazingly simple and delicious recipe, until I can follow my grandmother's recipe and it turn out the same.  On that note, I will probably use this recipe until I'm not physically able to cook.

Very good! I sprinkled a little cinnamonon the top, but next time I will add it to the batter. Very light and not overly sweet. Served with ice cream. Will definitely make again! Thanks!

Quick and easy and absolutely delicious.
Calculated out the recipe to 3 servings. In the instructions, switch to a 5x7 pan and use only 1/4 cup reserved peach liquid. Vacationing with friends in another state and this recipe is going with me.

Super simple, yummy good. I made half of the recipe in an 8 x 8 glass Pyrex dish. If you do the same remember to cut the cup of reserved juice in half. The instructions don’t change when you adjust the serving size.

I've made this recipe more times than I can remember.  It is my go to cobbler recipe and with many other fruits. I most times half all of the ingredients and use a smaller baking dish.  You won't be disappointed!

I keep trying to find the perfect peach cobbler. This was good, but not perfect. It came out a little gummy for my taste. Everyone enjoyed it, though.

This was good but mine came out a little dry, Maybe it was my oven. I will make it again but add a little more juice from the peaches.
