Added garlic, onion , tabasco sauce and cilantro.  Delicious and very addicting!  Be sure to use in a crockpot that is slightly bigger than 2qt. or consider preparing the dip on the stove on low heat and then transfering to a preheated small crockpot.

I just tried this recipe and my whole family loved it! It would be just fine as you wrote it, but I added some finely chopped onions and some kidney beans. Thanks for a great recipe!

WE really liked this! After cooking, I took this in a crockpot to serve at our cabin and it didn't last the evening! Didn't change a thing BUT I might try salsa next time instead of picante sauce. Thanks Angie!

We make this all the time.  It is one of our favorite company snacks.  We have been making our own salsa so we put that in.  Thanks for posting.

I make something similar to this recipe and everyone asks for the recipe.  You use 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb spicy sausage, 2 lbs. velveeta cheese, 1 jar of salsa and 1 can of green chiles (drained).  Tortilla Scoop chips; Cook the ground beef and sausage â€“ drain excess grease; Cut the cheese into squares to melt faster; after you have drained the meats, add the velveeta cheese and stir to melt; add the salsa and the drained green chiles.

Great recipe!  I made a double batch for a potluck we had at work today and everyone loved it.  There wasn't a drop left in the crock pot LOL.   One thing I did though was I used the hot and spicy taco seasoning mix and hot salsa it gave it quite a kick!

This was good nacho dip. It was a bit salty the first couple of bites and we could not figure out why? We did not add any salt. We will  make this again though - but next time we will add jalpenos!

I decided to venture outside of my normal collection of cheese dips and try something new.  I am so glad that I did.  This dip is good and my family gave it the thumbs up!  I made it for the first time last weekend and this weekend I let my family choose which dip they would like.  Without hesitation they all picked this one.  The only thing that I did differently was to add more hamburger.  Thank you for a great recipe! :)

This dip was excellent. I could not stop eating it. I am not a fan of picante sauce so I used salsa instead (picante sauce is chunkier than salsa). I also added only half the beef the recipe called for. Very good, I will definitely make this again!

Great "basic" recipe to alter to your taste! I omitted the beef and substituted milk for water and salsa for picante. It's just spicy enough for a mixed crowd of picky eaters.

Very good! I doubled the recipe and there still wasn't enough. My guests gave this rave reviews! They asked me to give them some to go, and there just wasn't enough left for everyone to take.

Awesome! Used salsa instead of picante and added a can of chillies and some tabasco since I like spice! I halved the recipe for myself, husband, and brother and we scraped the bowl clean! Definetely will make this again and again!

Very good.  I had to play with the texture a little.  First I thought it was to thin and added a little more cheese, but then it was to thick...so I added a little more milk.  In the end it was great.  I should have just left it alone the first time!  ;-)

I made this for my daughter to take into her high school spanish class for Cinco de Mayo. I made it the evening before and refrigerated it in my crock pot. My daughter said it was definitely the hit of the party...a few teachers, including the spanish teacher requested the recipe. The only change I made was substituting chunky salsa for the picante sauce. A definite keeper, I am planning on taking to my sisters BBQ this weekend.

I added some extra cheddar that I needed to use up and a jar of jalapeno slices.  I also substituted the ground beef for a can of no beans chili (out of pure laziness). Turned out pretty good.  I will be making this again...both ways.  This completely satisfied my Mexican snack craving :D  Thanks for sharing the recipe :D

Perfect for upcoming Superbowl parties! You can choose how spicy by choosing a hot or mild salsa to make it with.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe was okay.....  The dip definitely needs to be kept HOT...cause the processed cheese tends to get a film over it, when it cools....  I think adding sour cream also, might give the kick that it needs!!!

This dip is insane.  I added a can of mild green chiles and a few green onions.  It barely made it out the door to the Father's Day BBQ we were taking it to. YUM!

I made this for a football party and everybody raved about it.  I used a little extra ground beef, but otherwise didn't change anything.  I used mild salsa, and it could have used medium to give it a little more kick.

Made something very similar to this. Used salsa and taco sauce for a little extra kick and cooked onions with the burger. It was the first thing gone at the party.

I have been making this for years, except I use 1 pound of lean ground chuck and 1 pound of hot sausage browned and drained. I don't use the water. If it is too thick, just add more salsa.

I have been making this for years and I love it!  I use mild salsa instead of picante sauce and just before serving I put in sliced green onions.   It's a hit everytime!

This was awesome! I made it exactly as the recipe said, except didn't use quite as much meat. I think the taco flavored meat takes this dip to the next level. Will definitely make again!

I LOVE this recipe!! I have made some changes since the first time I made it. Instead of picante I use salsa and I also add sour cream and a bottle of Taco Bell brand hot sauce. It gives it a nice tangy zing!

Very good!  Everyone loved it.  I added a fresh chopped green pepper and chopped onion, sauteed lightly, and used chunky salsa.

Really easy to make and really delicious to eat.  I made the beef part earlier in the day and about an hour before we were ready to eat, I thriugh the cheese in( I used cheddar and monterey jack, not velveeta)through in some salsa, not picante(I ussed medium salsa, and there wasn't much spice to it at all, I might venture and use hot next time)I also added minced garlic and sliced onion to the meat when I cooked it.  It came out delicious.  We had it with yellow corn chips, which made it salty, but I like salt, so no biggie.  I will definatly make this again.

This is a good starter recipe and so easy.  I used medium salsa instead of picante sauce.  Next time, I will do as another reviewer suggested and add garlic, tobasco, and cilantro.

To make this vegetarian-friendly for a party, I omitted the ground beef and the water, and this came out perfectly! My friends agreed that adding the taco seasoning gave this a little extra zing. It was nearly gone at the end of the evening.

Tasted like it was missing something, and it was a little too watery, maybe I just should have cooked it a little longer.

Delicious and simple to make! Makes more than a 2 quart crock pot though.
