I made this recipe as directed and our opinion was that it was far too sweet but overall it had potential. Last night I tweaked the recipe...and we loved it.
I used an entire can of whole cranberry sauce and omitted the sugar. I also cut the butter to 1 tablespoon and added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. My husband will now eat cooked carrots without rolling is eyes!

This recipe is wonderful.  I used a frying pan for my recipe.  I used orange juice instead of lemon juice.  The sauce was thick and the carrots just stayed in the sauce.

Awesome recipe! I made just enough for my husband and I for dinner. I didn't have any lemon juice, so I boiled baby carrots in half apple juice / half water for a lil added acidity and some extra taste. The key to the glazed sauce is to make sure your element is still hot and keep stirring to coat until everything has melted nicely. The recipe is easily adaptable for smaller portions. I will definitely make the larger portion of this for Xmas! Thanks ;)

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  The next time I made this, I used cranberry sauce with whole berries, and about 1 tablespoon less sugar.  We like it better with whole berries. This is a definite keeper!

I thought these were really good.  I only used 1 pound of carrots, so I halved everything, but I only used a tablespoon of brown sugar.  It was plenty sweet, but not excessive.   My husband  and I love carrots, so we are always looking for different ways to make them.  I will make these again.

I used cranberry-raspberry sauce.  It was delicious.  A great taste combination.

Thhis was good.  The flavor awful subtle.  My "sauce" was real thin and stayed at the bottom of the bowl - didn't really coat the carrots very well.

Husband and I both enjoyed!  Wonderful change from the same old carrots.  Will probably end up on our holiday menus.

I didn't care much for this.  Personally I would of preferred my carrots with nothing.  It didn't taste bad but it didn't taste good.  Not worth the trouble for us.

Took some of the advice from reviews.  This recipe is WAY too sweet with the brown sugar.  Tossed out the first batch and remade, omiting sugar.  Added a little more cranberry and a tad of water.  Delish!

Steamed ten ounces of tiny baby carrots and made half the sauce.  I needed to use both cranberry sauce (from another recipe) and carrots.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor of carrots and cranberries but that is just a personal preference.  Good recipe for those who like sweet carrots!!

Simple recipe worth making. I didn't add the brown sugar as other reviewers suggested but I wish I had. I didn't have lemon juice so used orange juice instead. I also used a whole can of jellied cranberry sauce. It was a bit too tart without the brown sugar but I still loved the taste. Will make again one day with the brown sugar and will give another review.

Had Thanksgiving for twelve at my house this year---everyone raved about these carrots!! Even the ones that hate cranberry--I just didn't tell them what was in it (: Thanks for the recipe! Will be using it often!

The carrots where good but I thought it had too much of a butter taste that over powered the cranberry taste in it. Easy and fast to make which makes it an accessible side dish.

This was not very good at all.  I couldnt taste the sweetness at all. Rather, it tasted sort of minty.  I will not make again.
