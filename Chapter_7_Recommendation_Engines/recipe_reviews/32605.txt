I served this drink at a "mama mia" theme dinner and it was a smashing success! Several asked for the recipe.

I liked this one! I didn't have Rose's Lime juice (sweetened lime juice) so I elected to go w/7-Up with IS sweetened (bubbly) lime juice right? I like how versatile this is. If you prefer a sweeter more limey drink use Rose's. If you'd like a little less sweet and more bubbles use 7-Up. In the future I'll probably use a combo of each. CHEERS LPPZZULLO!
