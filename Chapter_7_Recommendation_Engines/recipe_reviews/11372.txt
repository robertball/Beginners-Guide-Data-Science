I just made these today for a Christmas party this weekend. It was funny...when I was measuring the 1/4 shot of bourbon I thought, "what the heck, that doesn't seem like enough" and gave it a quick shot more. Do not try this at your home!! I used Jim Beam Black and they are strooooong! But whose complaining? I like them. But then again, I like the taste of Bourbon. These have turned out great and I will be making them often...using only the amount of bourbon called for, of course!

I've been making these for years as gifts and my family can't get enough. I used graham cracker crumbs and often add more bourbon than called for. The confectioners sugar soaks in so dust them again just before serving. a melon ball scoop works well for me, just scoop into batter, then tap hard into a plastic bowl, finish rounding off with buttered hands.

These are so good.  If you have trouble rolling into balls, just refrigerate for a little bit.  These have been a real hit in Iraq and brought some joy to my husband and the soldiers he works with.

This is a wonderful recipe! Even though I tripled the recipe I came out with 52 pieces instead of 154. I also will place them in a cool dark place and sprinkle with more bourbon once a week until Christmas! Be careful! I made these one year and a friend of mine got drunk eating too many!

We've made bourbon balls for years - without the 1 C confectioners sugar - much easier to pat into balls and then roll in the confectioners sugar.  We grind until fine 1 box of nilla wafers, 1 cup finely ground pecans, 3 T light Karo, 1 1/2 T cocoa powder, 1/2 cup bourbon.  Never had a complaint!

I made these tonight, followed the recipe exactly, except it didn't take quite all the liquid.Balled up nicely & they are now "aging" in the fridge. I'm sure they'll be a hit at tomorrow night's party.  I used a spiced rum. Thanks for the recipe, Pamela

These are always a hit in my Christmas gift baskets. I make them several days in advance and leave out for 24 hours. Then I refrigerate for a few days. I find that the taste mellows the longer you wait to serve them.Thanks!

Very good! I roasted my own pecans and added 1/4 tsp. of Penzey’s double-strength vanilla extract. I’ve made this recipe twice so far, with consistent results and rave reviews.

I've made this recipe with both bourbon and rum and both turned out great.  You definately have to like whatever alcohol you use when making these because every bourbon ball recipe i've ever tried has a strong flavor.

The best bourbon balls yet. I would not recommend putting too much bourbon in them. They are great to make ahead. These also make a great gift.

I followed the directions to a "T".  Ingredients did not form and I had to add extra wafers.  Taste was OK.  I think I'll try a different recipe.  Maybe I did something wrong.

Very good and very easy to make.  I used spiced rum instead of bourbon.  I used a plastic 1 Tblspn to measure each ball and they were a tiny bit less than an inch in size and I got 28 rum balls.  Will be making more.  I used my food processor to chop then grind the vanilla wafers and the pecans were ground small as well.  A keeper! Will add this to my holiday making list. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  Good and simple ingredients most of which you have on hand.. these are my faves! thanks again :)

Wow...these little delicasies are POTENT! They are very easy to make, but for "sissies" you may want to half the amount of bourbon especially if you use a better brand...

Wonderful, I doubled the bourbon. Make these a day or two in advance so the bourbon flavor gets stronger. I rolled mine in granulated sugar.

I did have some difficulty rolling them, but I followed the advice of another and put the mixture in the refrigerator for about 5 minutes.  Got rave reviews from others!

This one just didn't work out well for us. It was too crumbly and I added more corn syrup and it improved. Was a bit grainy and very stong tasting (used Jim Beam bourbon) - however, I served them along with another recipe of the balls at a party last night and the group praised both and seemed to eat both equally so it may just be a matter of individual taste.

I have made this recipe before many times with 1 change, I made mine with left over cake trimmings. I make a lot of cakes. Doesn't matter what flavor it is. I just wrap the cake trimmings in saran doubled and then wrap with foil and freeze until you get enough to do some serious baking. It will last for months.

Great recipie, hint: use double the bourbon and add a tablespoon of corn syrup. if the mix looks loose let set 15 or so min. also a cookie scoop(looks like a small ice cream scoop) works great to get them all uniform also speeds up the prosess.        Have fun

I did not have light corn syrup so used dark instead. The amount of liquor in the recipe is fine! They taste a lot like bourbon- I'd be scared to double it. My co-workers all loved this, except for one woman who just doesn't like bourbon. I also put the wafers into my food processor. About one-third of a box of nilla gave me the cup of crumbs. Also, I only got 30 balls and used a teaspoon for making them. Great recipe!

This recipe has been around for years. I inherited a version of it from my Grandma.  My version calls for the cocoa powder and light corn syrup in Tablespoons, not Teaspoons. So it's a bit wetter and chocolatier. Rum is also a good booze substitute

The finer you can get your vanilla wafers and pecans, the easier it will be to roll into balls. I use a food processor and this works great! I followed this recipe to a "T" and the bourbon balls were the hit of the party (for those who like bourbon to begin with). But I don't like bourbon - hate the stuff actually, lol - so I made some with rum and they were equally as delicious!

This recipe did not work for us.  The texture was too grainy.  I recommend pulsing for 2-3 minutes in the food processor.  We used Jack Daniels whiskey, and we thought they were too strong.  I will probably make rum balls next time.

Never had bourbon balls before, but these are pretty good! As I am allergic to corn (no corn syrup for me!) I used rice syrup instead, and it worked just fine.  Walnuts were subbed for pecans, and the bourbon was Southern Comfort. These will definitely be made again!

yes ,but I prefer my fathers it is close.  instead of bourbon he used rum and brandy (1c dark rum, 1c lemon hart 151proof rum, 1c brandy, mixed.) the two cups left over we would use for the tom and jerry's at Christmas or a hot drink after snowmobiling. -- Horsewithnoname

I make this recipe each year during the Christmas season. I love the outcome and people actually call me to see when my Bourbon Balls will be available!

This is a scaled down version of what is in my Southern Living cookbook. It's all the same ingredients, just less of each one. Like with what is in my book, I had to add a little more here and there to get the right consistency.

I made these for my husbands birthday instead of cake.  He enjoyed the taste but found that the cocoa they were rolled in was too bitter for him.  I loved the taste, but wasn't too sure about the texture.  I'll have to try it again to see if I can make them a little less grainy.

These were so tasty that they didn’t even make it all the way through the evening. My friends asked for the recipe several times. The only thing that happened is that I couldn’t get the consistency right. I ended up using closer to 2 cups Nilla wafers to be able to roll them into a ball and even then they kind of oozed into a super soft, deflated ball but the taste was great...no complaints, only compliments and the request to make more next time. Thumbs up.

I've been making these for several years, and trying different flavors: bourbon, rum, kahlua, creme de menthe (I've pretty much run the liquor cabinet!).  The most-requested version seems to be Chambord (black raspberry).  I've found I can up the liquor to 1/3 cup; but if I add even a little bit too much corn syrup, the balls lose their shape.

Good taste but  dry. I guess I expected the inside to be softer and more like a truffle.  Made as directed. I think that if I made these again I'd follow the other reviewers comment and not add the confectioners sugar to the mix

I made these for my 103 yr old friend 4 her b'day.   She absolutely LOVED them... & so did her 83 yr old daughter!!!  I used 1/2 cup of bourbon, 2 Tbs of corn syrup & 3 Tbs of cocoa powder.   After rolling into balls, I put in fridge for several hrs ...& then rolled them in powdered sugar.  Turned out pretty too!  She was putting her hand into the tin for her 3rd one as we were getting ready to leave!!  They supposedly get better w/age ..,so  THIS lil lady will probably enjoy them till her 104th b'day!!  They were definitely a huge HIT 4 the Birthday Girl, for sure!!

I just made these for a small Christmas party. They turned out great! I made a couple of modifications. The dough was a bit dry so I added a tsp more of light syrup and a couple tsps of melted salted butter. The salt was a good addition. It made the bourbon balls more flavorful. The addition of the butter and extra corn syrup made them less crumbly and helped the confectioner's sugar and coconut stay on them better.

Most popular candy from group of four types despite not having the second rolling in powered sugar which makes them pretty. Mixture was initially too sticky so I added what I had on hand: 1/2 a sleeve of crushed saltine crackers.  I could only taste a tiny bit of salt which nicely contrasted the sweet. Will make again!

Delicious and easy. We used a food processor for the wafers and pecans. Everyone asked for the recipe. Great party appetizer!

I made these for the office Christmas party 2 years ago.  Now everyone at work starts reminding me about the Christmas party and my bourbon balls in September!   These are delicious....just don't eat and drive!   :)

These were a huge hit at a holiday party this year. I used 1/3 cup bourbon and it was perfect!

This recipe really should be less then 3 stars. I ended up adding a 1/4 cup of corn syrup to make the balls hold together. I used rum and the flavor was good. It would probably work well with kahlua. I may try it again with a different liqour and no nuts. More corn syrup is a must.

I used Wild Turkey 101 and they were a bit strong...may try a lesser bourbon next time.
