The flavors in this were really nice, but the texture came out a little mushier than I had expected. I don't know if I needed to bake it longer perhaps, or if it that mushy tamale texture was how it was supposed to turn out. I'd like it firmer, though. If I try it again, I'll use a little less liquid, maybe 1 cup of milk instead of 1 and a half, or 1 less egg white or something. 

I used two tablespoons of the homemade Taco Seasoning I from this site, which was a lot tastier than store-bought, and substituted ground turkey. I also used a can of green chiles instead of a jalepeno since I didn't have one, and used 1 can of stewed tomatoes and one can of fire-roasted tomatoes, since that's what I had. The fire-roasted tomatoes in it were fantastic. 

It didn't need any salsa, but if it were drier, maybe. Definitely didn't for flavor.  

Will try it again.

Yummy!  Much easier to make than tamales and still the great taste.  I changed the recipe around a little by adding cheese to the inside and some extra veggies like scallion and poblano pepper to the inside.   I thought mine turned out a little mushy as well, but as you let it sit and cool down it thickens.  I will definitely be making this again!

This  was a hit for my family. I went pretty much by recipe except I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned because i just dont eat canned food. I also used a quarter of the the jalepeno thinking it was going to burn like fire- but it didnt and the flavor went right into the food and really didnt even notice it after it was done. IT WAS EXCELLENT and definitely a keeper!

My husband and I really enjoyed this casserole. My husband even called it comfort food (which I think says a lot considering he just had surgery less than a week ago).We didn’t at all experience mush or dryness. I used unsweetened soy milk (only because I was out of regular milk and had to pilfer from my lactose intolerant daughter’s stash), stone ground cornmeal, 3.8 oz can of olives, and McCormick hot taco seasoning (although I prefer homemade). I think serving it with sour cream and fresh cilantro would be a great addition as well. I do think this would be too spicy for my toddler. For what it is, we think it deserves five stars.

I haven't actually tried this yet, rated it by accident and don't know how to delete the rating, only how to edit it so gave it 5 stars in my idea of fairness. Sorry.

This was very good. I used 1 entire egg instead of the 2 egg whites and ground turkey instead of beef. Really good. A nice use of homemade salsa and jalapenos from the garden and inexpensive cornmeal. Update: Made this again but scaled down for 4 and made in a greased 9 inch round pie plate. Used 1 can of rotel instead of tomatoes and chilis, used 1 egg, and added chopped onion to the meat. Served with Mexican rice and sour cream, salsa, and sprinkled chopped cilantro on top.

I agree that the consistency was a bit unusual, but thought it tasted great. Next time I would throw in some onion and garlic with the "meat" (I actually used a vegetarian meat substitute). Or maybe use shredded chicken instead -- that could help a lot with the consistency. The other flavor I think this was missing is sour cream! I am very sensitive to spicy but didn't think the jalapeno was too much at all. I will probably make it again for myself but am glad there were no kids around today, as I can't imagine they would have gone for something so unfamiliar.

This is one of my new favorite recipes. So easy to make with such a great flavor. I too used Taco Seasonings l and added cayenne pepper. I cannot wait for leftovers tonight!

I usually make a few changes to recipes to lighten them up. I made this one EXACTLY as the directions indicate and it was fabulous! So tasty and so different from anything I've made or tasted before. I will definitely be making this one again. Thanks for sharing!!!

I thought it was a good and easy recipe. A hit with my son-there weren't too many leftovers! I used ground chicken instead (only because I don't eat much beef) and substituted a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with the green chiles all ready in it-I halved the recipe. In reference to one reviewer's response that it was mushy, I just added a few extra tablespoons of corn meal and cooked it a bit longer. No problem the texture was great. Thanks for sharing such a great dinner idea- definitely will be making it again!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for. I was very underwhelmed. The taste was ok, not amazing or anything.  The problem was the looks of the thing, and the texture. The texture was mushy, maybe less liquid would help. But the looks of it were the drawback. After the piece I cut out fell apart into pieces, it looked like a pile of glop.  I wanted to like the concept, but I don't think this is something that I'll be making again.

I modified this recipe a bit just because I didn't want to go to the store. I used a green and yellow peppers instead of the jalapeno, can of corn instead of frozen. box of cornbread mix instead of cornmeal, and 1 whole egg. It was pretty good I think I would have liked to have it thicker.

Super easy and delicious!  Cooked up quickly and was not too liquidy, which I was worried about. I used pork instead of beef and used Mexican Cojito cheese which was a great addition I thought.  I tripled the amount of jalapeno pepers because we like spice and it still wasn't really spicy at all.. I think because they cook in with the pork and lost some heat.  I think next time I won't cook them with the pork and see if that helps.  Also I think black beans and more tomatoes could be used.

Tasty recipe.  I only used 1/2 jalapeno thinking it might be too spicy for the kids and wasn't able to taste it at all.  Next time I will use the whole thing.  I also used regular cheese instead of reduced fat.  My husband enjoyed this recipe as well as two of my three kids.(ages 4,4 and 2)

Tasty when freshly out of the oven.  Not pleasing to the eye.  Does not taste good re-heated.

This recipe was okay. I will say you have to eyeball the texture. I put almost another whole cup of corn meal and a half teaspoon of baking powder to get it to the firm texture that I desired. Also, I added a little more seasoning. You really have to play this recipe by ear; know your oven and desired outcome and work from there. Overall, it was pretty tasty and not a total waste of time. An easier way may be to buy a bland box of cornbread mix,  dump the other ingredients in and bake.

I did not use the chilies, jalapeno's, or olives as my kids wouldn't have liked it.  I doubled the meat using one pound of ground steak, and one pound of bison.  My family loved it.

This was ok, but mine came out pretty dry. I dumped salsa all over the top, and then it came to life (maybe it was the salsa?). Would make again, but maybe lighten up on the cornmeal or include more liquids.
