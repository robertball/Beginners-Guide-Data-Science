It may be tasty but how can you call it "Welsh" without using sharp cheddar and ale or beer in the recipe?:)

Hey Thanks so much! This is the recipe I had 30 years ago. I lost it when we moved. Had it last night. It was like meeting an old friend. Yes I have other recipes but this was my favorite. Thanks again

Made this as a dipping sauce for sausage balls I served for the SuperBowl and this was great! I'm not sure the egg was necessary. It was good before adding it but still good after I added it too so you be the judge.
