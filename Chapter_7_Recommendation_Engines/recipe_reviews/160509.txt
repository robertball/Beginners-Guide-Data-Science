I love this recipe.  My girlfriend and I served this up at a men's BBQ for 80+ guys last fall.  It can be doubled, tripled, 10x so easily.

I love this recipe! Everywhere I take this dish people rave and want the recipe. It is so easy that I just jot it down on a piece of paper! I add some diced onion and about 1/2 c. of milk for some moisture.

Great Brunch Recipe!  I have used this recipe for roughly 10 years and have taken it to my local Mom's Club (MOPS).  Everyone loves it.  And as a busy mom,it is easy to put together and make.  It travels well.  You can also use cornflakes as a topping if your children ate all your ritz crackers!  Great recipe.  I have used as much as 16 oz of sour cream with it to make it creamier, and have also increased the cheese to 16 ounces just so it makes it into the "double by-pass" category of food!  The addition of bacon bits also makes it even better... ahh the possibilities are endless!

This is a very easy and tastey side dish. I add a little dry onion flakes for more flavor and instead of cracker crumbs I have used crushed corn flakes.

This is a great dish for a potluck & sure to be a hit. I have made this for years but I do add a bunch of chopped green onion in the mixture for flavor and instead of crackers on top I use crushed corn flakes.

I've made this using crushed corn flakes in place of the ritz crackers. This is a great potato dish for a large crowd or party and absolutely delicious. It definitely tastes better with the shredded hash browns as opposed to the cubed ones.

Essentially, this is hash browns au gratin. This is simple, easy, fast and would be a wonderful regular holiday staple. The fat content is a little high, but as a side dish with lower fat dishes it's acceptable.

Always looking for a different way to do potatoes. This one is a 'keeper'. My 14 yr old son loved it. Easy to make. Only deviation was in using Tex Mex cheese.

I thought this was really good, I used a cream o' mushroom soup and added some carmalized mushrooms and onions to the mix. I topped with french fried dried onion pieces (Frenches) brand instead of the crackers and omitted the butter. I also had to use velveeta cheese cubed instead of cheddar since it was all I had on hand. I used a 2%. Thanks!

I was really disappointed with this recipe. After following the direction exactly I thought the mixture was too dry. I added more sour cream and used a total of about 1 1/2 containers of 16oz sour cream. The potatoes were bland and didnt have much taste. I added some garlic powder and pepper on top just to finish what was on my plate and my boyfriend agreed that made it better. If I decide to make these again I will add the garlic powder and pepper to the mixture before I put it in th oven to see if that helps.

Just looking at the ingredients lets me know that we're going to really enjoy it.  Will probably add a bit of homemade hot sauce.  Think I'll make it when we visit with friends this weekend.  Thank you very much.

This was wonderful. my family and I loved it!! I did add some chives that I diced very fine. I also added some bacon bits and garlic powder. I didnt use the cream of chicken either. I used cream of celery. Im not a big fan of cream of chicken. It still turned out great!! Will be making this one again and again!
