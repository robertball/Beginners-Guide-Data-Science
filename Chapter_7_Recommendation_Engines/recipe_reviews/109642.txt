I  discovered something about this recipe.  While making it for guests who were late I left this in the oven covered with the oven turned off.  It probably sat for about 1/2 hour to an hour and when we ate it was falling off the bone.  My guests raved about it the entire meal. This is not necessary of course but will make the dish even better.  I also noticed that one important part of the recipe was left out....you need to leave the skin on the chicken. I just realized it's not specified in the recipe.  That may be while some reviews say it is lacking flavor. Sorry.

My sister submitted this recipe and I just wanted to add some good cooking points since we both have been making this for years. To get a really good flavor my husband and I normally add whole garlic cloves, by the time it has cooked an 1 1/2 hrs. the cloves are soft and so sweet they don't even taste like garlic anymore.  I alway add a lot of onions and season the chicken with garlic salt and pepper.  Parsley is a must.  The longer it can cook the better - if you are going to cook over the 1 1/2 hrs. you may want to add a little more water. Take the cover off the last 15 min. to brown the legs and crisp the onion slices a little. Enjoy we alway do.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  It takes a little time to cook but was very easy to prepare.  I changed it just a little.  We used leg quarters instead of just the legs and used red potatoes instead of white.  Leaving the skin on the chicken and potatoes saves a lot of time.  I didn't use baby carrots since we didn't have them and just used regular carrots, cutting them lengthwise and in about 1 inch pieces.  We just used the potatoes, carrots and onions.   Everything came out very good and the broth from the chicken was delish...it is perfect to dip bread into.

I love to make this.  I do a couple of things differently.   First, I use quarters and I do leave the skin on.  I also do not put very much water in the pan.  It makes its own juice.  I put a small pat of margarine on each piece of chicken.  I also sprinkle creole seasoning or some sort of rub on the entire dish.  This gives it a TON of flavor.  I put the broth from this dish into freezer bags and use it when a recipe calls for broth.  

One last thing, use any and all veggies on hand.  Some great additions to this are celery, tomatoes, and mushrooms.

I think the gist of this recipe is the method used to bake the chicken, which I've done for years.  Chicken and vegetables are "steam" baked using liquid, covering the pan with foil.  The proportions are too much to fit in a 9 x 13 pan, and 2 cups of liquid and butter suggested is way too much to use.  By the time the fat renders off the chicken the dish will be swimming.  I used 1/2 cup and it was just right.   It also lacked seasoning, so I gave it a good dose of herbs de Provence and a sprig of thyme to infuse some savory flavors.  Since I don't like soft skin, I increased the oven temp to 375, uncovered, and baked an additional 15 minutes to to crisp it up a bit.  For the basic cook, this recipe is okay.  Just be careful you either cut down on ingredients or use a larger pan.

Vey delicious chicken roast. We used chicken legs, sweet potatoes, red peppers, crookneck squash, carrots, lots of onion, and whole cloves of garlic. Used less water and more seasonings including thyme and oregano (omitted parsley), Cooked for hour and a half and it was perfect!

This dish is wonderful! I took the advice of the others and used TONS of veggies, broccoli, baby carrots, red onions, red, yellow & green peppers. The next time I think I will not use broccoli. I also think I will try sweet onions instead of the red and maybe even apples. You do have to use a TON of seasonings and maybe even marinade the chicken before. BUT oher then that this dish is great. Play with it.

I thought this was very good.  I did change some things based on the reviews.  I left the skin on the chicken, used red potatoes and omitted the squash.  I cooked mine for about 1 hr and 30 minutes to make sure all the veggies were cooked.   This came out very well.  I served it with sour cream and ketchup.  The broth was very good.

Just ok. Not much flavor. I added chicken broth instead of water. Chicken tasted like it was just boiled in the broth. Needed more spices or something.  Probably wont make again.

While visiting my daughter the day before they left for a trip, I did a little bit of refrigerator and veggie basket cleaning, and used  this recipe for the general makings of a great dish.  I used 5 chicken breasts (skin on & bones in), about a pound of redskin potatoes, one large sweet potato, a green pepper, about half a pound of carrots, one large leek, and one small head of savoy cabbage.  I seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, and Italian seasoning.  I was hesitant to add plain old water, but I added the half inch as directed.  After the initial hour in the oven covered with foil, it was pretty juicy, but as directed I took off the foil and baked for another half hour.  After that time, the liquid reduced to a perfect amount, and it was really delicious.  I would definitely use this method again and do some more experimenting.

Wow, so easy and so good; Put it in the oven and forget about it, your complete meal is ready when it's done. I didn't use potatoes as we had left over rice to have as a side; also did not use the squash as I didn't have any on hand, but added a couple stalks of chopped celery and a package of small whole mushrooms. Used 1/2 can of ready to serve cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 can of water; there was plenty of liquid. Baked for 1 1/2 hours all together. 15 minutes uncovered. Delicious.

This was okay.  Nothing really special...it needed more flavor.  I loved how easy it was to prepare though.  I'll try it again, but this time I think I'll use chicken broth and not as much of it, and use more spices...maybe marinate the chicken legs...it's a good start and it didn't taste bad, it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be.

This was great! I used whatever veggies i had on hand and used broth instead of water like others suggested. I also made a rub with my fav spices since we like our meat well seasoned. I will be making this again very soon.

I used leg and thigh quarters, divided.  I pulled the skin off and trimmed off as much fat as I could.  I know the skin and fat gives great flavor, but I'm trying to reduce my fat intake.  Besides, the cooked skin is not attractive, as well as awkward to remove from hot chicken.  I quickly browned the chicken in butter in my stovetop and oven safe casserole pot, instead of putting it on top of the salted and peppered chicken. I added whole garlic cloves after the chicken was a nice golden brown and sauted for only a few minutes, ensuring the garlic didn't burn.  I added the layers of vegetables as listed, parsley flakes, garlic powder, and black pepper.  Instead of adding salt and water I used homemade chicken broth.  I covered the casserole pot with it's tight sealing lid to bake in the oven.  This recipe reminds me of a rustic French dish I've had in the past. One could add wine as part of the liquid if desired.  It is a simple recipe that can be taylored to what one has on hand.  The smell is wonderful and tantalizing.  My family's mouths watered in anticipation of the meal.  I served with crusty french rolls and a salad.  The broth was amazing.  Thanks, Melissa.

Very easy - loved that it's a "one pot" meal!  Having read other reviews about it being bland, I used chicken broth instead of water and sprinkled the spices (basil, oregano, garlic salt, pepper) with a heavy hand.  Good comfort food.  Took every bit of 90 minutes; next time I may cut the potatoes smaller.

I didn't use squash. I put potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, onion and lots of garlic. I seasoned the chicken with garlic, salt and pepper spice and put italian seasoning and basil in. It was okay but needed more flavor.

I've made this recipe many times and love it.  Its so versatile because you can add as much as you like or omit what you dislike.  We like it a bit on the hot side so I add some jarred hot pepper slices to give it a little kick, and some italian seasonings (oregano and basil).  The juice is so good for dipping your bread into, and I don't even use the chicken stock (as some reviewers suggested) because we have to watch our sodium.

I gave this 4 stars because it would be very bland with water.  I used chicken broth.  This is a very plain dish and perfect for my hubby who does not like "fancy stuff"  Next time I make it I will try adding Cajun seasoning to give it some zio.  I was out when I made this.

I cooked it as directed, however, I did have to cook it for about 2 hours instead of one just so the carrots would be tender.  I also served it with rice.  it was excellent!  thank you for the recipe.

Very easy and tastes great.  I'm pretty sure I used more seasoning than it calls for and I put whole cloves of garlic in with the veggies.  I used thighs and legs.  For the veggies, I added zucchini and sweet potatoes in addition to what's listed here. We all loved it!

Awesome in all ways. Tastes great. I replaced organic Chicken Stock in place of water to extra flavor combined with fresh herbals. Easy to prepare. I baked in covered dish in place of foil. Leftovers just as yummy

this is so funny! I have made this for years as also my grandmas easy chicken dinner! I do add zucchini or green beans for a full dinner.  Yes the juices remaining are great for bread dipping. I used to put it over spaghetti pasta instead of red sauce! We used to call it "plain spaghetti". Try it!

I loved this recipe and it got rave reviews from the family. It's indeed very flexible, I didn't have garlic powder so I skipped the salt and used garlic salt instead. I didn't add water or cover it and still baked it for an hour. It didn't dry out and the chicken skin was so perfectly crispy and literally finger lickin' good. I will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe using butternut squash, sweet potatoes, carrots and potatoes. I sprinkled with basil and Italian seasoning, and spread butter on the chicken legs. I also used one cup of chicken broth. I baked it at 350, covered, for 90 minutes, then turned the oven off and left the dish in the oven with the lid off for another 30 minutes. The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the veggies were wonderful. I will be making this dish frequently!

This recipe is very practical all you need are the chicken legs and what ever vegetables you want. I used carrots, green bell pepper, green onions, onions, and potatoes. I served it with rice!

This didn't do it for me.  Was excited to try it after reading the reviews discussing the great flavor.  However, my family felt it was quite blah.

Made this tonight and overall it was pretty good. Only thing I did different was omit the squash (fam doesn’t like it) and I used chicken broth instead of water. This needs lots of seasoning. Cooking time was accurate chicken was done and moist. Will make again, and maybe play with different seasonings.

Definitely can’t underestimate that you have to play with this recipe. It is a keeper but... I read the reviews and overseasoned, like suggested by so many of the reviews, & it still wasn’t enough. It needs more garlic and more salt and anything else your palette desires. I will make it again and keep experimenting with seasoning.

The cook time and temp was way off for my oven, at temp given n 90 minutes, veg still too crisp.  + I added about one cup of stock to create juice instead of making fat gravy.

I like this recipe for it's simplicity and the fact that it is a one pot meal.  I think you could use thighs, small legs, breasts or whatever parts you like, but I would leave the skin on for additional flavor.  You can always remove for eating.  I also think you can use the spice, or other vegetables of your choice. Thyme is nice. I did not,  however, put water on the veggies.  I planned on using chicken broth, but didn't have any.  I used vegetable broth, because it is what I had on hand.  It was so delicious, that I wanted to drink the broth.  I will definitely make again.

Excellent!  I customized the recipe for our tastes and loved the results.  My husband doesn’t care much for dark meat, and even he gobbled it up.  Will make again for sure.  Thank you for the recipe.

Mine didn't get done in an hour and 20 minutes. My veggies were quite firm. But they tasted delicious! I will definitely be making this meal again! It was so easy! Just throw it in the pan and throw it in the oven. I did make one change: I use minced garlic instead of chunks of garlic and garlic powder.

Very bland, however that was ok for us. Each person got to season the chicken and veggies the way they wanted. I’d definitely say to cut the water in half or more and also use more garlic powder or garlic salt.

I just tried the recipe because I had such a good eating. And it came out great! I use chicken quarter instead of just the drumstick. The chicken comes out juicy and tender. I would make it again and not changing anything.

the best thing about this is the juice developed for dipping bread in. the chicken lacks any flavor. Put this into a large pot, add more water and you have a pretty ok  soup.

We really enjoyed this recipe but... I did make some adjustments as others posted & recommended. Really seasoned the chicken well. Seasoned the vegetables also. Used whole garlic which cooked down . Served with buttered egg noodles.

This was fantastic!!  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I didn't have whole garlic cloves so I used chopped cloves and instead of water I used vegetable broth and bone in skin on thighs.  Delicious!!  I took other suggestions and cooked it half an hour longer than suggested.  I'll make this again, thank you!!

Excellent!  Added no water.  Used Youkon Gold pptatoes and chicken thighs bone in.  After first hour, suggest you base every 10.  Turned oven up to 375 last 20 min.

I've been making this for years except that I season my chicken with a pretty heavy sprinkling of Cajun spice as well as some salt. You can pretty much use any veggies you have on hand.  It's really good with frozen corn on the cob as well as the other veggies. I don't add extra water or chicken broth since I bake mine in a large oven bag, the kind you use when baking a turkey or you can make a large pocket using heavy duty aluminum foil but may sure you close up the ends tightly or all your precious juice will run out.  For those of you who like your chicken a little crisper just open your foil packet for the last 30 mins. baking time. The chicken and veggies will make their own juice but I do add a few pats of butter.  Once I get all my veggies cut up in good size chunks, I put them in a large zip loc bag including the frozen corn on the cob and sprinkle them with a little salt and Cajun spice then smooch them around in the bag to coat. Place your seasoned chicken in the baking bag or foil pouch then add your seasoned veggies around and on top of your chicken pieces before closing up tightly. Be sure to place your baking bag or foil packet on a sided jelly roll pan just in case you have a leak during baking.  I bake mine per these instructions but do turn my bag over once halfway through. I generally use potatoes, carrots, whole or halved onions and corn on the cob since soft veggies like squash will tend to over cook when using a bag but if you like your squash soft go for

My entire family loved this.  I used vegetable broth instead of water, and for veggies I included onions, carrots, celery and zucchini.  I didn't use the seasoning in the recipe, but instead used Misty's original blend (and all purpose seasoning).  It was flavorful and the chicken legs were moist.  We'll definitely be making this again!

Since there were so many comments about the blandness, I decided to increase the salt and pepper and added dried hot peppers.  Delicious!  I also used mushrooms and celery in place of the squash, which I did not have.

I made this according to almost the instructions. Using chicken broth instead of water. Covered cooked at 1 1/2 hours at 3.50. Left uncovered for another half an hour. It was amazing, everybody loved it!  Next time I will reduce the broth to 1 1/2 cups. Other than that good to go, we will make again

Just ok.  Way too much water in the recipe, which made the vegetables taste boiled and the chicken taste steamed.  Will not make again.

Not sure what I did wrong.  After 80 minutes, my veggies were still raw and the chicken had blood running out of it.  We ordered out for pizza.

I thought it was bland. Maybe I did something wrong.

We really enjoyed this.  I added some extra veggies, cauliflower and mushrooms.  I loved the vidalia onions that I used with the potatoes.   Delicious!!  I omitted the butter on top of the drumsticks.  Probably why the skin didn't crisp up very well, but we take the skin off before eating anyway, so not a big deal to us.  The kids ate the parts of the skin that were crispy and there weren't any complaints from them.  I'll definitely make this again.  A great meal to pop in the oven before running the kids to wherever they have to go!   Thanks!!

a little bland needs more seasoning.
