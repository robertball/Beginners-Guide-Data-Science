This was a real winner with my family -- I made this along with the monkey bread for mother's day! Both were a real big hit and they both smelled so GOOD!!!

This cake is SO easy to make.  I did make a mistake, when I made my sweet potato casserole, I purposefully prepared too many sweet potatoes so I could use them in this recipe (I did not want to use canned sweet potatoes).  Well, I had to scoop come of my casserole to use in this recipe...it had pecans in it, Oh My GOSH!  It was great!  Thank you for sharing your recipe.
