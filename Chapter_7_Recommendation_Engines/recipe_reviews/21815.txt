I followed the recipe until it said to discard the marinade. I put it in a small saucepan, removed the garlic & simmered it until it was reduced to syrup. When the tenderloin had 10 minutes of cooking time remaining, I glazed it with the reduced marinade. It gave it more flavor & a nice color.

I've made a recipe similar to this for years.  I serve it to company all the time & it always gets RAVE reviews. There are a few changes I make: For one, I add a little more brown sugar to the marinade (I don't measure, I just throw it in). Next, it's best if you marinate it overnight (I do in a large ziplock bag). Then you MUST grill it (It tastes so much better this way).  Finally, the best part: Serve it with the following sauce: Mustard Scallion Sauce: 1/2 C. sour cream, 1/2 Cup mayo, 1 Tbsp. dry mustard, 3 Tbsp chopped scallions, 1 1/2 Tbsp. white vinegar, and 1 1/2 tsp. sugar. (You may need to add more sugar and/or vinegar to adjust-I don't measure) Enjoy!

THIS WAS WONDERFUL!! I chose this one, and it was made exactly as the recipe directed. I wouldn't change a thing. I made enough for 8 servings, so I used 2 1.5lb tenderloins. I pricked each with a fork before marinating for maximum absorbtion. I doubled the cooking time, but cooked at 325 degrees. Meat was very flavorful, with barely a hint of bourbon. I thought the soy would be too salty, but it wasn't. The brown sugar helped temper the soy sauce. Wonderful recipe. A guaranteed "will make again".

This is my favorite pork tenderloin recipe.  However, instead of brown sugar I use about 1 cup of apricot preserves.  It gives it the sweetness of fruit along with the soy sauce and bourbon.  I also rub salt and pepper on the meat prior to putting the sauce over it.

This dish is excellent! I used a little less soy sauce and little more brown sugar and let the pork tenderloin marinade for 4 hours. When finished, I used the marinade to prepare a reduction sauce. I added a 1/2 cup of reduced sodium beef stock and let it simmer at medium heat stirring constantly with a whisk. To thicken sauce, I added cold, cubed butter (about 2 1/2 tbsp.) stirring constantly with whisk. Serve tenderloin, pour reduction sauce over it and garlic smashed potatoes are a great side dish!!

I made this recipe for company and they all raved and wanted the recipe.  After reading what others wrote I doubled the marinade, let it marinate 24 hours and thickened the marinate and poured it over the meat after cooking.  It looked kind of odd with a weird consistency and I wondered if it was okay.  I had thickened it with corn starch.  Anyway,it turned out and was the best ever!

This recipe is easy, and it's great for entertaining.  I really recommend marinating it overnight.  I double the garlic and also add a TBSP of chopped fresh ginger as well as some fresh rosemary.  I have served it many times with haricots verts and creamy garlic-herb mashed potatoes.

This turned out okay.  I wasn't that impressed but it was tasty enough.  I make pork tenderloin quite a bit so I'm always looking for new ways to prepare it.  I marinated mine in a ziploc bag for about 3 hours and it did pick up the taste of the bourbon but it was not too strong.  I seared mine on my outdoor grill first and then finished it in the oven.  So this was good but not as good as my all time fav pork tenderloin recipe on this site, the Maple Garlic Marinated Pork Tenderloin.

WOW.  This was REALLY, REALLY easy, and my husband said it was "The best pork he ever had" (we are both great cooks, and also travelers and sort of "foodies", so that really IS saying something!)

The only things I did differently (because I decided last-minute to try this recipe) were to: 1) cut the tenderloin into 1-inch filets, 2) make the marinade for 12 servings 3) place the tenderloins single-layer in a glass baking dish, 4) pour the marinade over the entire thing (since I wasn't able to marinade it), and 5) add some pepper (hubby loves it).  

I then cooked the tenderloin for about 30 minutes at 325f, turned each piece over (and reversed the outside and inside pieces, to ensure all cooked the same), turned up the heat to 400f and cooked about another 20 minutes. 

Needless to say, hubby is glad we made extra--he snacked on a third of it before it even got to the table, tried to convince the kids it was horrible so he could have more, and then made sure he put the tiny bit of leftovers out of the way so he could have more today.  Now, if that's not a great endorsement of this recipe, I don't know what is!

Very good!  For the garlic cloves, I laid the flat side of a knife against them and whacked it with the heel of my hand, to break apart some cell walls to release more garlic flavor.  I noticed that many said it needed to be sweeter and had added extra brown sugar, so I just substituted teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce and left the brown sugar amount the same. I did as another  reviewer and simmered the leftover marinade until syrupy (I left the garlic cloves in it), then basted the loin with a silicone brush when there was about 10 minutes cooking time left.  Remember to let your loin sit for 10 minutes after removing from oven, or all the juices will run out when you cut it.

This was okay, the flavor was not as strong as I would have liked it though.  I marinated for about three hours.  Maybe it should have stayed in over night.  There wasn't a temp listed so I baked at 350 for 45 minutes and it came out perfectly done.  I don't think I will make again because I prefer my marinades to leave more flavor.  All I could really taste in the meat was the bourbon.

I LOVE this recipe - I make it all the time!  Try it with Red Stag bourbon for a wonderful, but not overpowering, cherry flavor ---- it's terrific!!  I marinate it for at least 24 hours and use the left-over marinade to make a gravy (I just boil the marinade,  use some cornstarch with water, and then thicken up the cooked marinade ----  I use it to glaze the tenderloin about half-way through the cooking process)    It's one of our favorite recipes!!

I made this 8 times, I buy at least 10lbs. I also buy the bourbon by the gallon(Jim Beam).  It lasts maybe 3 days in my house.  Very good! I love it

I cooked this in my crockpot - just added the ingredients and let it go.  Family loved it.  I have also used the recipe as a sauce when I haven't had time to marinate the meat.  Many rave reviews!

Delish! The pork was so moist and had great flavor with the bourbon mixture. I cooked the 
pork in my crockpot on high for 4 hours and it 
turned out perfect. I also marinated it for 3 hours. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I like to save my marinated and simmer it for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and stir in a pad of butter.  I serve this with mac & cheese and steamed broccoli.  Very tender & juicy pork and my 6 & 8 year old loved it.

This pork tenderloin tasted delicious.  I had to increase the baking time because it was still rare after 45 minutes.  I let it bake another 15 minutes and it was tender and pink in the middle. I wonder if 350 degrees would be better.

The pork turned out moist and flavorful.  I marinated appx. 20 hrs ... I would not marinate it any longer than that.  I did taste the burbon quite a bit ... maybe next time I'll add more sugar.  I'll make it again ... it's not often I get a moist tenderloin.

I used the marinade to make a gravy.  Just add the leftover marinade to a package of brown gravy mix and 3/4 cup of water.  It makes a perfect gravy to pour over the pork and even mashed potatoes!

Absolutely loved this recipe.  Followed the directions but doubled up on the marinade and added more sugar.  As suggested by many other comments, I used the marinade for a gravy and it was fabulous.  I added about a cup of chicken stock and it came out perfect!  Will definitely make again and again as my husband also loved this recipe and can't stop thanking me "for the best meal we've had in weeks."

I've made this twice now, both times I doubled all marinade ingredientsbut the brown sugar (used Jack Daniels as it was on hand) The first time I left the tenderloins whole and baked as directed. Today I sliced each tenderloin on the bias into 4 oblong medallions (flattened them a bit) and marinated them all day. They grilled up a nice mahogany. Grilled drained, canned pineapple slices along with them Both times this dish was VERY well received by my men! Thanks! :-)

Good Recipe!  More of a delicate flavor that compliments the taste of the pork, rather than masks the flavor.  I forked the meat to let the marinade infuse the pork, and put it in a ziploc in the refrigerator for 8 hours.  I doubled and minced the garlic, and also added hickory smoked mustard (same brand as the bourbon) and black truffle-infused olive oil to the marinade.  I seared the meat in a pan on the stove, then cooked it at 350 for 1 hour.  Very tender!!  I served it with the cooked-down marinade on the side, as well as a variation of the Mustard Scallion Sauce suggested by another reviewer.  Everyone from the picky teenager to the picky toddler ate a healthy portion.  We will definitely make this again.

This was awesome!  Like another reviewer, I cooked it in the crockpot, and the meat just melted in my mouth.  I had to prepare the marinade on the sly, because my husband would have had a fit if he had seen me use 14 cup of the Jack Daniel's, but after eating it, he told me I could do it any time I wanted!  I ran out of soy sauce, so I used Worcestershire to make up the difference (it was about half and half), and it was very good.  Being a diehard garlic lover, I doubled it and left it in to cook.  My house still smells like garlic, but boy oh boy did it taste good!  Thanks!

I marinated a pork roast overnight and then put it on the grill.  This marinade would be great on just about anything.  EVERYONE loved it.  A keeper!

This marinade had such a great flavor!  I followed exactly as stated, too.  The only change I will do next time, is follow what another review said, and keep the marinade and thicken it with corn starch to make a glaze. All 3 of my guys wished it was thicker!

I used this recipe on some pork chops that we had. We didn't have any bourbon in the house so I used peach schnapps instead... my husband had his doubts but we were both pleasantly surprised with the results.

This was an amazing recipe with a couple of minor tweaks...I used liquid smoke instead of soy and used a garlic press to release more of the garlic flavor. Reduced the marinade and added a half bbq sauce which made a wonderful glaze. Being a KY girl gotta love the bourbon...lol   Thanks, I'll be making this again...soon!!!

really good marinade. easy to throw together. I only marinated 45 min. we wrapped bacon around it and grilled it for about an hour on the green egg. we used a plate setter on the green egg and grilled 3 at a time. they didn't brown that well. temp 325. next time will do a warmer temperature and maybe no plate setter. we heated up the marinade and served with it. very good.

This is a keeper. I took an earlier reviewer's suggestion and made a sauce with marinade, beef broth, and butter. I would recommend using low sodium products (soy sauce, broth) if you do this, as it can be very salty.

Really, really good.  Marinated one pork tenderloin overnight, and cut into medallions.  The marinade, reduced in the pan, after the pork came out, was fabuous.  Great idea.

Great flavor! I used very thin pork chops and cooked in the oven on 350 for about 30 minutes. When cooking thin ones try 20mins first . I felt these were alittle over done but we enjoyed them.

My first review! 

My changes: put garlic through a press, used Jack Daniels, and added a splash of Worcestershire sauce. I only marinated 3 hours and turned the temp up to 375.

Results: The sauce started to burn in the oven maybe b/c i turned up the temp. The meat came out super tender but didn't have much taste. Luckily i reserved the marinade and heated it up with some flour to make a gravy. I think that is what ultimately made this tenderloin.

My husband seemed to enjoy it. I liked it. I will make it again but will try other recipes first. Def. save the marinade and use as a gravy!

This is a easy and fantastic sauce..  I let the tenderloin sit in the frige overnight in a ziplock with the sauce and the flavor was intense. Everyone loved it. I grilled over low flame and it turned out very juicy.  I love this recipe.  Thanks alot.

Both my husband and I were very impressed with this recipe. I did follow the instructions but with a few modifications. I added a little more brown sugar, extra garlic, and a dash of worstershire. I marinated it all day than baked it in the sauce, basting often and turning once. I then thickened the sauce a little and drizzled over the sliced meat. It was wonderful. The tenderloin was melt in your mouth tender and had a great flavor. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that I like the Marinated Pork Tenderloin and the Burgandy Pork Tenderloin recipes on this site a little better. Still worth making and will definitely make again!

I went to ABC store and ask how much is 1/4 cup.. gave me one of those little bottles that they give you on the airplanes of Jack Daniels..  I measured, exactly 1/4 cup..  this was a wonderful recipe.  The next time I will make double the sauce as it was a big big hit with my guest. I have done this twice, once with mash potatos, once with egg noodles and got raves.  As I read reviews I am thinking no way..I will try myself.. If you didn't like this you are very picky, funny about whats in foods..I forwarded this recipe to my Godson who is was a chef and said "this has been a closed secret, didn't last long in our house,my kids didn't realize they were getting booze for din din".  This is a keeper and I have passed to all the "so called" chef in family..

This was fabulous! I only marinated for 3 hours,  I think more than that would be too much. I also did not discard the marinade, but reduced it to glaze the tenderloins for the last half of baking. It did take longer than 45 min to reach 160. Might change heat to 350 for 30ish next time. Definitely a keeper!

yummy! I too left the remaining marinade in the pan with the pork. I used part of  a whole pork loin (that is what I had. They are a lot cheeper. We cut them into meals{4 servings each} before freezing. If you cook it right it can be just as tender as tenderloin)

This recipe for tenderloin is so much better than those pre-marinated ones from the store. I marinated it overnight. When my daughter was picking at the leftovers the next day the kitchen smelled great just from the bowl being opened.

This was pretty good-the alcohol in the marinade made the meat nice and tender and the combination with the brown sugar caramelized the meat nicely.

I enjoyed this, though it didn't totally knock my socks off. I could taste the bourbon flavor and would probably add slightly more brown sugar next time. I also thought the cooking temp and/or time was off. I cooked about 1.5 pounds of tenderloin, and it was not even close to being done after 45 minutes. I'm thinking the cook temp should be 425, not 325. With all that said, the meat was very tender and juicy, and the marinade does complement the flavor of the meat nicely.

I have made this several times and it always turns out great!  I have used as a marinade for pork, chicken, and steak.  It tastes great with all of them!  I have also put all the ingredients together and cooked it down to make a sauce and served it over filet mignon without marinading it.  Any way I've tried this it has been wonderful!

Very nice marinade - did not overpower the wonderful flavor of the tenderloin.  I did mince my garlic, used low sodium soy and marinated for about 6 hours.  We did them on the grill. Huge yums from everyone.  This was opening day for bbq season at my house - woohoo - finally!

I liked this dish, but my family didn't care for it.  I am outnumbered.  It took longer to cook than stated.  My Loin might have just been too big.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!  I did make a couple minor changes by adding in some all purpose flour (a small handful) and a little worchestire sauce.  I also used about 1/2 of the bourbon required (not a big bourbon fan).  I let it cook in my crook pot for about 2.5 hrs.  Boy was it juicy and flavorful.  My boyfriend is a picky eater...so when he requested to have this dish again, I knew it was a keeper.  Thanks a bunch!

This is a good recipe, in my opinion, however there are so many wonderful pork tenderloin recipes, I think this one is not among the best.    I followed the suggestion of others and made a sauce by creating a roux, adding the marinade and water and adding more brown sugar.  This made a nice sauce.  I even added a dash of vanilla.  If making this recipe I would strongly suggest making this sauce to accompany it.

I also marinated over night. We do not currently own a grill so we used a roasting rack in the oven. The key is to take the left over marinate and make a sauce. Use 2 tbsp. of butter and 2 tbsp. of flour stir until deep brown. Pour about one cup of water then your left over marinate, reduce to your desired thickness. Serve with cheese mashed potatoes.

I added a bit of extra brown sugar to my marinade, and used Jack Daniels (my favorite). It was delicious. I marinated the tenderloin for nearly 6 hours, then baked at 325 for slightly over an hour. (I used a bigger tenderloin.) Had guests for dinner and everyone loved it. The tenderloin was very tender, cooked perfectly. Will make it again. And the marinade would be great on chicken or steak as well. (I heated the marinade to boiling, added 1/2 cup broth and 2 Tbsp. butter, cooked for 10 min. or so, then added a touch of cornstarch to slightly thicken it. It was great poured over the tenderloin.)

Wonderful recipe, very easy to make. I used 2 1lb. pieces of tenderloin, and increased the marinade to the 3lb. amount. Grilled on the BBQ to an internal temperature of 145F because we like our pork with a hint of pink. Also made a sauce as suggested by someone else using the reserved marinade, added a 10oz can of beef broth and thickened with a beurre manier(4tbsps. softened butter mashed with 3 tbsps. flour). This made enough sauce for the meat and mashed potatoes. Definitally a keeper.

I liked this dish enough to make it again on occassion.  I still prefer the sesame pork tenderloin from this site by far over any other recipe including this one but as a back up this will do!  I found the measurements and cooking time to be accurate.

My husband and I thought this was really good, but we also thought it could have used more flavor or "punch".  I will try this again and maybe inject the marinade hoping for more "punch".  This was very moist though.  We served it with "roasted garlic grilled vegetables" (recipe from this site)and they complimented each other very well. I marinated for 24 hours instead of 2 and I think that helped a great deal.  Grilling it also adds a nice touch.

Very good.  I did add a little extra brown sugar.  Marinated approx. 24 hours and put on the rotisserie on the grill.  Nice and juice with a crispy outside.  May try using our turkey fryer injecter next time and injecting some marinate inside also.

This marinade has become a standard in my home.  I have recently been putting the pork with the marinade in an oven bag to cook. It helps keep it tender. We use the marinade/drippings for a gravy.  This recipe is also great for Salmon.  I marinade for 2 hours then grill.

Marinated this overnight by accident (didn't get to cook it the previous night). The tenderloin was very tasty and moist. I used two small tenderloins and upped the brown sugar and garlic a tad. Served with a sweet potato/apple side dish and Pat's Mushrooms from this site.

We eat alot of pork, so I'm always looking for new recipes. This one looked very interesting, so I made it and didn't tell anyone. The whole family loves it, I've even cooked it for a chef friend and pro football player and they loved it too. A keeper for sure.

This is GOOD!  Our 2 1/2 lb tenderloin came as two 1 lb + pieces.  Marinated about 4 hours and grilled maybe 20 to 25 minutes, until it came to temperature.  Very juicy, tasty, tender, etc.  Will definitely use this again.

I used a 1 3/4 lb. pork loin for this recipe and it turned out great!!  I marinated the meat for 2 1/2 days and the meat was so tender that it cut like butter!  The only thing I would do different is use less soy sauce, more brown sugar and more garlic.  This is a keeper.  Can't wait to try it on the grill this summer!

I made this and was pretty disappointed. I followed the directions to the letter. All you could really taste was the bourbon. I guess that's ok if you really like the taste of bourbon. The meat was cooked to perfection. I brought it to 140 degrees than wrapped it in foil for 5 or so mins. It was tender and juicy but lacked depth to the flavor.

I've been using this recipe for years with both pork and salmon.  When I don't feel like the burbon flavor I just substitute Apple juice.  Another nice twist is to add sliced Vidallia (or other sweet onion) to the marinade and grill the onion along with the main dish. Delicious!!

Very nice, be sure to cover it loosely with foil, and let it sit for 5 minutes before cutting into it... I did like the marinade simmered down to a sauce to drizle over the meat once cut into quarter inch slices for presentation and taste...

I was scared when my boyfriend yelled from the dining room, "What did you do to this pork!?" Turns out he loved it. The only thing I did different from the recipe was  simmering the marinade down  and brushing over the top of my pork for what I hoped was going to be the last 10 minutes. Ended turning the oven up to 425 for another 10 minutes. Turned out fantastic and and juicy.

I would have rated this a 4, but my husband LOVED it!  LOVED it!  So I had to give it a 5!  He said I could make this any time I wanted.  I had about half a pound of tenderloin and so used half of the marinade, using Jack Daniel's.  I thought it was missing something---maybe just pepper or a little fresh ginger or something.  I grilled it to make it easy.  I will be making it again!  :)  Thanks, Debbie.

This was awesome.  I used the "Jane & Rich" suggestion in their Review of Jan 11, 2008, as follows:  "I followed the recipe until it said to discard the marinade. I put it in a small saucepan, removed the garlic & simmered it until it was reduced to syrup. When the tenderloin had 10 minutes of cooking time remaining, I glazed it with the reduced marinade. It gave it more flavor & a nice color."  The only thing I did differently was I used minced garlic and did not remove it.  It was really fabulous.

I tried this recipe with thick cut pork chops, and the marinade really just stayed on the outside.  I would stick to the called for cuts of pork.  The bourbon was nice, but the brown sugar really made the chops too sweet for us!

This is the best pork tenderloin recipe. My picky husband deemed it "restaurant quality". Like some others, I reserved the marinade, boiled it, and thickened it with Wondra flour. Then I poured it over the medallions. Can't wait to impress company with it.

How to you write that sound Homer Simpson makes when something is delicious? Anyways, I sliced the tenderloin into 1.5" slices before marinading as directed.  Then, I wrapped each slice in pepper bacon and grilled it.  Try it!  You'll love it!

I followed the suggestion from a few  people, first, I did not have Bourbon, so I substitued balsamic vinegar, it was GREAT!!!!!! I did cook it longer than indicated. 45 minutes was was too short for these tenderloin pieces. I cooked it at 325 for 1 and a half hours for 2 and 1/4 tenderloin.

Very good! After marinating the pork and putting the pork in the oven, I poured the marinade into a pan without the garlic pieces and cooked it to make a syrup for the pork. It came out really good and the pork was very tender.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The only thing I would change next time is that the cooking tempature was really low. I cooked my tenderloin at 325 and it took 3 hours!!!! Next time I will increase the tempature. Other than that this recipe was great!!!!

My family loved this recipe (5 and 3 yr old kids included)!  I used a 1 1b tenderloin but kept the same amount of sauce.  I baked the tenderloin in the sauce basting it occasionally.  I had to bake it about 1 hr.  It was moist, tender and had a wonderful flavor.

The ingredients sounded interesting so I tried this recipe.  It was very good.  The bourbon gave it a distinctive, nutty flavor and the soy and sugar added zip.  Nice quick tenderloin preparation.

Excellent - a great tasting recipe that is fast and simple.  What a nice marinade.  I did add a little extra (+2 tbsp) brown sugar and peppered the meat before marinating, per the reviews.  Mine (3.5 lbs) took about 1 hour 20 minutes to be done, though.  I cooked the marinade for a glaze - really a nice addition.

This is the first time I have ever made pork tenderloin and it was wonderful. I didn't have any bourbon so I did as another reviewer did and replaced it with 1/4 cup of apple juice and tsp of vanilla. I had put slits in the meat and rubbed it with the garlic, salt, and pepper. I then marinated it with the sauce for about an hour. Cooked it for the time and the rest of the sauce I added a little more brown sugar cooked it on top of the stove and in the last 10 mins of cooking the meat I poured it on the meat to get a nice glaze. Great recipe!

I am just an average cook and when my husband took a bite of this I got an "Oh Wow!".  I took the advice of others and made extra marinade so that I could turn into gravy.  My kids, Mother in Law and husband devoured it.  I had a small chunk of meat left over so I took it to work the next day.  Not all that great as a left over but will make again as a main dish very soon.

I made more marinade than this recipe called for so that i could make a gravy/sauce with it, as suggested by other reviewers.  I made a couple changed to the marinade right from the get go..  just based on my taste.  I used about 1/3c. gentleman jack whiskey (because that is what we had in the house) about 1/2c. soy sauce and threw in like 3 or 4 heaping tablespoons of brown sugar. Also, I put in 4 smashed garlic cloves.  I marinaded for about 2 hours, put the marinade in a pot on top of the stove for the sauce then put the tenderloin in the oven for about 40 min. at 400 degrees..  
For the sauce, I skimmed out the chunks of garlic cloves, then added about a tablespoon and a half of butter, and used a whisk to stir in flour until it was the consistancy I was looking for.  I also added a bunch of water to dillute the taste.  
Overall, the meat itself was great. Very tender and juicy. However, the whiskey taste was overpowering, especially after putting the sauce on top.  I will probably try this again, but I will only put in a couple tablespoons of whiskey so it isn't so strong. Otherwise it was great!

This was really good. I marinated the pork for about 18 hours, used only 3 tbsp bourbon though. I also took other reviewers' advice and made a gravy from the left over marinade, which was great on top of the pork and garlic red potatoes I served with it, also from this site. Thanks for the recipe!

It was so gooood! My husband kept raving over it and he scraped his plate clean! I only tweaked this a little by increasing the brown sugar to 4 Tbs, the garlic to 3 cloves and threw in some fresh rosemary. Marinated for 4 hours and it took about 1.5 hours to cook in 325F oven. Served with the reserved marinating sauce by boiling it for 10 min and then adding 2 Tbs. of butter to the reduction. This recipe is a winner!

After reading the other reviews I was expecting more but this was good. The flavor was tasty but I agree that it is best to make a gravy out of the marinande and serve over mashed potatos. I had to prepare in the crock pot which gives the consistency of a pulled pork which my family prefers. I would make again.

I found the recipe very good, I made a minor substitution, instead of soy i used the bourbon to bind a dry rub.   Other than that, very tender and very delicious.

This was one of the first dishes I made and reviewed when I joined Allrecipes back in 2007. Made it again last night and the 5 stars still hold up. However, I feel I need to comment that my 2.5 lb tenderloin took almost 3 hours at 325 to reach an internal temp of 165. If I were making for company, this would have been a problem. I again marinated for a day and a half, saved it then brought it to a boil. I whisked in about 2 tbls of butter, 1 tbls of cornstarch, and a cup of beef broth. Delicious! 
Original review from 8/2007 - WOW!! Very good. After reading the other comments, I added flour to the marinade. I couldn't  get enough of it. My husband raved - said it was A++ / 5 star and can't wait to have it again.

I marinated this for about 20 hours.  The bourbon I used had to be 20 years old! It smelled o.k.  I then cooked it in the croclpot for 7 hours on low & served it with garlic mashed pot. & made a sauce out of the broth.  It ws good!

This was delicious. Marinated for a day and a half. Cooked in the crock pot on low for about 4 hours and on high 3 hours. Melts in your mouth. I added water to the marinade while it cooked to keep it moist and then put the marinade in a pan with a little corn starch to thicken and made a wonderful sauce to pour over the pork. Will definitely make this again. The meat and the sauce had a wonderful flavor. Did not have bourbon so used VO. Turned out great.

Very good! I didn't marinate as long as recommended (but I bet it would have been even better!). For a little extra, bake with pinapple rings on top. It looks great and the flavor is very subtle.

This was 'OK'... I do think it would be best grilled.  The flavor was very mild and quite nice.  I used very thick tenderloin slices for this.

THE BEST PORK ROAST EVER!!! OMG this was soooooo good!!!! Even my hubby, who CANT STAND pork roasts LOVED this recipe. My picky 4 yr old also gobbled it up. I give this 5 stars for its originality and taste. This a keeper! It was also even TASTIER for leftover 2 nights later. The juices of the apple jelly mixture just soaked up into the pork.. the pork was so tender. We were able to just cut it with our forks. Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe!

Excellent, but bourbon taste is too strong....cut bourbon in half.  An easy recipe, and very tasteful.

Wow! The bourbon gives it a very overpowering taste. Next time I won't marinate it as long and probably use a lot less bourbon. Other people liked it though.

Good flavor - the bourbon wasn't too strong.  I marinated one tender a couple of days and baked in the oven.  I think this would be better grilled.

This is a juicy and good recipe.  I used Jack Daniels since I didn't have bourbon.  It smelled strong when I put it into the oven, but worked out great.

I have made a slightly simplified version of this with just bourbon and soy sauce. It is so simple, but dinner guests love it! Don't be afraid to serve it to company. It doesn't taste anything like its individual ingredients.

This was very good.  I put it in a roasting pan and marinated with the sauce that it was marinating in.  It had a lot of flavor and was very tender.  I baked at 350 degrees until the temperature reached 160 degrees.  I made with Sweet and Sour Brussel Sprouts from this site and they complimented each other nicely.  Thanks

Port tenderloin was very tender, but the bourbon flavoring was a little too strong for my family's liking.  I might make again, but not at the top of my list of pork tenderloin recipes.

so simple, but so delicious!  This is my husbands favorite!  I substituted worchestershire sauce for half of the soy sauce, but other wise left it alone.  I marinated overnight as opposed to two hours

Tastiest pork ever!  I read several of the reviews and followed the suggestion of heating/reducing the marinade as a sauce.  I didn't baste the tenderloin towards the end of cooking with this sauce but definitely will do that next time to make it look better! lol

Crown Royal Black was the bourbon that I used in this dish. Instead of cutting the garlic in halves, I cut it in quarters to spread it out a bit more. I also added a bit of pepper before pouring over the tenderloin before refrigerating. 

When it cooking, I baked for 45 minutes just like what was called for, but once that was over, I used the remaining marinade that was left over and poured it over the tenderloin and placed it back into the oven for an additional 10 minutes at 350. I believe that adding the marinade to the tenderloin for the past 10 minutes added to the juiciness of the dish.

This was an amazing dish!!

Whatever you do don't plan this for dinner when you have a time crunch because the 325° for 45 minutes is a joke at best. I questioned it and should've followed my gut but didn't because I was in a hurry when planning and now an hour and a half later it's still only registering at 125°. Most likely should've been cooked at 375° to 425°.  The flavor is amazing the time just sucks.

I used honey bourbon and it was great!  Made the sauce with cornstarch and water to thicken as was suggested.  I only made one pork tenderloin.  I didn't have a roasting rack for my pan, so I rolled up aluminum foil. Cooked for 40 mins as we like our tenderloins on the rarer side.  This meat was so tender and juicy after I let it rest for 10-15 mins.  This may move to our favorite tenderloin recipe.

I had to omit the garlic because I live with a vampire, but otherwise I followed the instructions.  I am a big fan of bourbon and I have nothing against soy sauce, but this marinade really didn't make me happy.  The meat was tender but it almost tasted like I imagine rotten meat would taste.  I won't make this one again.

Took 45 min. to cook with only 1 1/2 lb tenderloin. Used Crown Royal instead of bourbon. Poured sauce in pot and thickened with baking powder, butter and cream.

Rave reviews from my guests last night when I served this tenderloin.  I added 1 TBSP of fresh minced ginger with the marinade and let it sit for 8 hours in the fridge.  I served the tenderloin with my personal chutney (i.e. frozen peaches added to a jar of Major Gray chutney).  Wonderful!!!

I followed everything in the directions and it turned out GREAT!!! We made this for a formal party and it impressed all my guests.  The only change I made was marinating it for about 8 hours. It turned out very flavorful and tender.  The only difficulty I had was it took about an hour and 15 minutes to cook.  I made two of them and each roast was about 2-3lbs each.  
It didn't have a strong bourbon or soy flavor. Everything mixed well together and had a nice slightly sweet taste. We will definitely make it again!

We've made this recipe before and enjoy it. This time I used all the ingredients for the marinade, boiled on stove-removed from heat and added light cream..1/4 to 1/3 C...I didn't measure. We used this sauce to dip Ribeye steaks in. We love it. When I do cook the pork as stated in recipe, I always do the same w the marinade and use as dipping sauce. It's very good.

I marinated the meat overnight and put it on the grill - it turned out tender and oh so flavorful. (Did I mention I used JD Honey Whiskey? Didn't have any bourbon.) husband also gave it a thumbs up!

I have been making this receipe for years. After I marinate it I rub it all over with Dijon mustard then roll the loins in sesame seeds seeds and bake at 350 for about 30 minutes or until tender. I serve it with a mustard sauce as suggested by another reviewer. Yum.

I made this for a dinner party and it was great.  Because of my guests who don't care for alcohol I substituted Apple Cider Vinegar for the Bourbon.  I then added one more tablepoon of brown sugar to balance out the vinegar.  Everybody loved it.  However, it did take longer than 45 mins at 325 deg to bring it to 145 deg internally.  I finally bumped the temp up to 375 deg at 45 mins and it had to go another 15 mins or so.

wow, so delicious!  We cooked it on the grill using advice on how to cook from the new Weber Grill book, and it was the most tender and awesome pork we've ever eaten!  We made the sauce reviewer Jill suggested and it was great too, although we added a few extras (a little Worcestershire, a small pinch of old bay and a small pinch of red pepper spice just to add a bit of flavor).  We already have plans to make it for friends in a couple days.  Can't wait to show off the new recipe..  Thanks!

Really good flavor after a three hour marinade, and a snap to put together. I think I would cut back on the brown sugar and soy sauce and up the bourbon next time, to make the bourbon flavor the star, but as written this is quite good.

This was easy and delicious.  I made twice the sauce and reserved half to warm on the stove and thickened it with corn starch.   I sliced tenderloin on a platter and poured the sauce over it.  Every morsel was eaten!

This turned out so incredibly tender and super flavourful. I let the meat marinade for 24 hours and added more garlic because I love garlic, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T - couldn't be happier at the result!

I have made this many times and it is always a winner. Longer marinating insures more flavor. I even made it in a slow cooker with the marinade. It was fall-apart tender and super good. My family was even excited to eat the left overs.

Delicious!  Family loved this! Didn't have Bourbon and substituted Burgundy cooking wine.  I know that is quite a difference, but since everyone loved it I will stick with it!  Also used garlic powder and added onion salt.  One of the best tenderloins I've made.  Thanks.

Unbelievably good.  This is so easy to make and is sure to be a hit.  I had to shop for some of the spices, but you will be well rewarded to do so yourself.  It is quite amazing.  It is great even for leftovers.

I tried it on chicken, marinating it in halve the sauce and cooking down the rest to cook off the alcohol. Hubby said not to add this to the "save list".  Just blah.

Another unbelievable easy recipe that was a hit with my family.  
After marinade the only addition I made was grilling the pork in a grill pan on top of the stove until seared, placed in the oven and baked for 45 minutes!  I served with grilled asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes!
A pot of Cabbage Fat-burning soup is simmering on the stove for tomorrow!

Great marinate! Had to use Cognac instead of Bourbon because that's what was on hand, but it turned out great. For me definitly a different way to prepare my port tenderloin.

This recipe is SO great! My aunt gave me this recipe last year and I was surprised to find it here exactly the same. Try it, so easy and so yummy. I only marinated for six hours and I thought it was great. The only thing I recommend is using low sodium soy sauce and make sure to grill rather than bake to add that smoky flavor. yum!

This was a huge hit with my family. Really easy to marinate in a ziploc bag while I was at work, then a quick grilling and we were ready to serve. Yummy!

The meat took longer than recipe said to cook it, by almost an hr as well as it needed a higher temp! Otherwise, it was OK.

I substituted a tbl spoon of stone ground mustard as I didn't have mustard seed.  Marinated the pork overnight, then cooked on the grill.  Flavor was great, but be careful not to overcook.  Made a small batch of same marinade and put it with potatoes, carrots, onions in the slow cooker - will skip that next time as the flavor was too much for the veggies.

I guess I didn't like the bourbon flavor as much as I thought I would.  This recipe was pretty good and the pork was nice and tender and moist, but I just didn't care for the flavor as much as some other marinades.  My 2 year old liked it though!

I had no bourbon so played around with this and it was So Good! To "replace" it I doubled the brown sugar, added 3 tsp-ish Bourbon vanilla extract, and added about 1/2 cup of coffee. The Bourbon vanilla has nothing to do with the liquor but is named after the plantations in France from which it comes. It has a smooth, smokey flavor.)

I followed this recipe exactly, but wasn't a fan.  My husband said it tasted like bananas.  Maybe it was the bourbon I used?  The flavor just wasn't what I expected.

I noticed in reading the reviews that most people really like this recipe and the few that didn't, really hated it. I, on the other hand, did not hate it but, didn't think it was all that great either. I really feel like the success of  this recipe all depends on the cut of meat and the quality of ingredients. So, I'm not blaming the recipe for how "not so great" mine turned out but, I don't think I'll be making it again. Thanks anyway:)

I made this the other night for dinner & it was a hit.  I didn't have bourbon but I did like someone else had and used apple juice & vanilla instead.  Excellent!  I turned the marinade into a sauce to pour over the pork.  Great!

Amazing!  I'm a big bourbon fan, but I was a little hesitant to use my Woodford Reserve in a marinade, but it was so good.  A little Woodford on the rocks while I slow cooked it on the grill made for a nice warm up and great accompaniment for the meal I had ahead of me.  I made a sauce out of the marinade (as someone else had mentioned) that went really well with both the tenderloin and roasted garlic mashed potatoes. (recipe from this site)

I'm looking forward to making it again soon!

I didn't have Bourbon so I substituted with 1/4 c blackberry brandy and 1 c of cheap whiskey and 1/3 c Brown sugar. Let marinade in fridge for 2 hrs. Browned them in electric skillet at 400 degrees, set aside, add 1 can of Albertsons Cream of Mushroom soup (condensed) w/ 1/2 water 1/2 low fat milk. Mixed well and add more milk/water to desired consist. Add pork meat and reduce to simmer for approx 1 hour. I used gravy in pan for carrot/potatoe mash, hot french bread, tossed salad with lt. dressing. Absolutely delicious. Thanks for theidea!

This wasn't what I expected at all.  In fact, I smothered the pork in BBQ sauce just to make it edible enough for my children to eat it.  The bourbon flavor was very overpowering.

Great recipe!  I marinated all day and baked exactly as described and the meat was perfect!  Made a gravy out of the marinade and that was good, but next time I'll add some water so the taste is not so strong.

I tried this marinade and thought it was just dreadful. The taste of soy sauce is overwhelming. Also, at 325 degrees it took a lot longer than 45 minutes to get the tenderloin to 160.

Nice flavor with a touch of "oomf".  Don't skimp on the marinating time.  It's worth the wait.

I let this marinate all day.  I didn't think it tasted like anything.  We will not be making this again.
