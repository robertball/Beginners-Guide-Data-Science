Yikes! Nothing like curdled fudge. My sister told me I did nothing wrong, that it's suppose to looked like that, cuz that's what margarine mixed with melted choc. chips does. It curdles, because of the water in margarine. I really hate to waste chocolate, so I threw them into a batch of chocolate chip cookies along with "normal" chocolate chips and told everyone that they were chocolate chip surprise cookies. The kids and neighbors loved the fudgy pocket surprise.
So, as fudge...NOT, but fudgy pocket surprise.......YES!

I actually thought that this recipe was quite good, but it is definately not fudge!!! I don't think that it tastes bad, though! the only problem for me though was that my microwave started to send out smoke and it set off our smoke alarm!

have to give it 4 stars for the concept, definitely not for instructions or ingredients. i tweaked this recipe last year and everyone loved it. first off, don't use margarine, use butter. For every 3c of chips, you need to use 4Tbsp. I made three types last year, and the most successful was the eggnog variation. you need to add more liquid after melting to keep it from resetting so hard. for egg nog, I used 1 fl oz of rum extract, nutmeg to taste. This still comes out more solid than traditional fudge, but worked since i had about 20 coworkers i was gifting fudge.  And use common sense when microwaving chocolate. if your frozen burrito comes out after two minutes, ready to eat, perhaps room temp chocolate won't take so long. i usually do burst of about 30 seconds, and stir each time.

This many poor reviews can't be wrong, so I decided to see if I could help this little recipe out a bit. I put the chocolate chips and butter (not margarine) in a small microwaveable bowl and cooked on high for only 1 minute, stirring at the 30 second interval. No lumps, no white spots, and not even super stiff. I then put it in a very small, foiled-lined, square Corning Ware dish until it firmed up. It did have the consistency of fudge, and even tasted kinda sorta like fudge. I would never eat this at one sitting, though, since it has 899 calories!
