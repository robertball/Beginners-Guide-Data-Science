Very good recipe, and easily converts to on-the-stove tenderloin recipe if you have a VERY large skillet with lid (or stock pot, maybe).  Just rub and braise tenderloin on hot skillet, then pour all the rest of the ingredients together into the skillet (juices, water, and veggies) and cover on medium heat until meat and veggies are done (about 30-45 minutes).  I also substituted apple juice for orange juice (personal preference) - not citrus flavor, just enhances the apple flavor a bit.  Wonderful recipe, husband has requested this for Christmas dinner.  Thanks for posting!

I only got as far as the pork, not the veggies, but it tasted amazing.  I used a Tyson pork loin rib eye, and my husband cooked it directly on a gas grill.  It turned out fork tender.  I can't wait to try the veggies.

I cooked this recipe exactly as written, with the exception of dried cliantro for fresh. It was delicious! Definitely a keeper and a recipe for when you're having others over for dinner. Don't leave our the apples- they are amazing!

Great Flavor.  I used 2 one pound pork centerloins, so the vegetables covered the meat.  The apple slices became an applesauce that added wonderful flavor to the sauce.  The only thing i will do differently is not preboil the vegetables .  they were quite mushy after an dditional hour cooking on the grill and didnt need to be pre cooked, but we tend to like crisper vegetables anyway.  Nice autumn dish, thanks

I also made this on the stove in a large pot. I did cook the veggies separately then added them to the meat with the apples & some of the water. It was ahhmazing!! Delish...I can't wait to try it on the grille. I'm sure it would be as good..definitely a keeper. Thank you for a great recipe..

This was wonderful.  One thing for people who can't handle spice...the dry rub comes out into the broth in the last step.  Next time I make it I'll use half or none of the red pepper because my acid reflux was not thanking me the next few days (even though it was delicious!).

I only used the recipe for the pork rub and then grilled the meat standing along to a temp of 160.  Very flavorful and juicy!

Great recipe! No need at all to precook the veggies. I didn't. After cooking in the grill for an hour, they were perfect! I reduced liquid to 2 cups: 1 c. chicken broth and 1 c. orange juice. Added juice from 2 lemons---along with about 1 Tbsp. garlic with the apples. I used a pre-seasoned Apple-bourbon Tyson porkloin and a package of fingerling

I only made the pork loin, on a CI skillet in the oven after searing on the stove. At 350Â°F for 45 min, it came out fabulous. Will definitely be making it again.

Following the recipe exactly you SHOULD use small sweet and white potatoes as well as only 3-4 carrots. A 12" cast iron skillet would never hold the the larger veggies. Additionally cut the boil time down to 10-12 min, MAX. The spice rub was exceptional w/ the veggies AND the apples. There is a LOT "going on" in this recipe. Great flavors w/ every bite. With these changes this would be a 5 star recipe. Definitely a keeper and will make it again SOON.

Made it exactly as provided at a smaller amount of servings. Definitely a keeper in the books. Loin came out so tender it's irresistibly delicious. Had to restrain my self from over eating. Great recipe.
