Saved this for the dressing alone. Very tasty! Had some of my own marinated pork tenderloin leftover and was looking for some ideas other than bottled dressing. Thanks for posting!

My family really enjoyed this Salad. The Smithfield marinated pork was a great addition to a very tasty salad. The dressing was really good, I didn't use all of it and was happy to have leftovers. I decided to cut the meat into medallion shapes as I think it looks prettier. I'm sure I will make this recipe again.

Very easy to make and a nice twist to Caesar Salad. The pork was very tasty and added a new level to the salad! Will make again.

This was so easy & simple to make, but, had great flavor!  The recipe was done within 15 minutes start to finish.  The Smithfield pork loin had great flavor and the dressing had a nice tang and was the perfect complement to the pork.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow this was great! Loved it, Smithfield did good on this one! I also cut pork in medallions as I thought it made a better presentation of the dish.

This was a fantastic salad. I made another recipe which stir-fried the pork with some garlic and red pepper flakes, so I used that leftover meat. The red pepper flakes were great in the salad. I liked the dressing and added probably double the amount of hot sauce called for. I've probably only had pork on a salad one other time, and this recipe makes we want to try it again!

We really enjoyed this salad for dinner. I prepared the pork a day ahead and it made dinner tonight super fast. Whipped together the salad and 10 minute meal! Will certainly keep this recipe on hand!

Quick and easy fir such a flavorful salad. The only change I made was cutting the pork into medallions instead of strips and frying them up.

I thought this tasted pretty good. It was a change from steak and chicken based salads. I will definitely make this again, but maybe try a different dressing. I also cut the dressing amount in half and it was enough for 4 salads. I broiled the tenderloin on a foil lined sheet, on high, until browned on both sides. I then turned the broiler to low and let it slow cook for about 20 minutes or so. That setting on my oven is really low heat. It made the meat so tender. I just cut it into about 1/4" slices after it set for a bit to cool down slightly. I highly recommend the peppercorn and garlic Smithfield pork tenderloin.

We LOVED this salad! I do think the dressing, which was delicious, was a bit on the thicker side, but that's easy enough to fix. Great flavor and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Excellent!  This was a huge hit with my family- such a simple dish but absolutely delicious.  My grocery store didn't have the flavor of pork that was called for so I used the Applewood Smoked Bacon variety and it was delicious.  I did up the amount of pretty much all of the seasonings in the dressing and add a little extra parmesan, but this was a really really delicious dish!

This was very tasty! Rather than cutting the pork into strips and then stir frying, we chose to grill the pork whole, and let it rest for 10 minutes (to not lose all of those delicious juices) before slicing. It was delicious!
