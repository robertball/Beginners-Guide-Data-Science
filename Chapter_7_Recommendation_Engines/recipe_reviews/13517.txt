Since finding this recipe two months ago, I have made these many times with great results!  Cutting a raw sweet potato lengthwise is NOT an easy task, so choose the more narrow ones.  Definitely use the ziptop bag method for seasoning.  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added more than just paprika.  We enjoy garlic salt, onion powder, thyme, salt and pepper.  Also I've found that you can cook these at 350, 375 or 400 and just adjust the baking time accordingly.  Foil on your baking sheet makes for the easiest clean up!

I like this recipe A LOT b/c you can be creative.  I am not a fan of sweet potatoes, but learned from this recipe that you can EASILY disguise the sweet potato taste and eat healthier.  After reading the recipe reviews from this one, I raided the spice cupboard and came up with a perfect combination.  I slice the potatoes in 1/4" round slices versus the sticks.  In a large ziploc bag, I combined olive oil, garlic powder, chili powder, salt, and pepper.  I tossed the slices in the mixture and baked them on a pizza stone for 15 minutes on each side.  In another bag I tried the brown sugar/garlic powder mixture someone else mentioned.  It was good, but not as good as the first batch.  MUST TRY!!!!!

These were so awesome! My family devoured them....I baked them at 350 degrees for 50 minutes and that prevented the outside from getting done too fast. A new family favorite.

I eat sweet potato fries at my favourite restaurant all the time, and while these didn't taste bad, they were not the same as a french fry - so if that's what you're expecting, you probably won't get it with this dish.  I used only two sweet potatoes because there were only two of us, and I used about 2 tbsp of olive oil, salt and pepper (no paprika).  I baked them at 400F, but they were done long before the 40 minute suggested time; it only took about 20 minutes to cook them.

The best way to eat sweet potatoes!  You can use any spices you like.  I usually cut mine into slices as opposed to sticks and I also toss them in a ziploc bag to coat with oil and spices.  Easy, healthy and delicious!!

I really liked this recipe.  I used a huge knife and easily cut the sweet potatoes into eighths.  I used a pastry brush to apply canola oil to the potatoes.  I made 1/3 with creole seasoning; 1/3 with nutmeg, cinnamon, salt and brown sugar; and 1/3 with salt only.  I baked them at 350 for 50 minutes and they were wonderful.  I liked the brown sugar mix the best.

One word. . .WOW! I have never like sweet potatoes, but my husband and I decided that today, October 1st, we are gonna start working out and eating healthier. So, today, for our first "healthy" meal, I decided to make baked battered fish with sweet potato fries and collard greens. Wow! I didn't think I would like them, but OMG, they were awesome! I actually added a little more to the seasoning in the recipe; garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper. I will definitely be using this recipe again and recommending it to my friends. Who says eating healthy has to taste bland!

I've made these fries for years, and my kids just love them. I use butter flavored spray and salt and pepper, but I will definitely try it this way, too!!

We liked them better when the sticks were cut thinner.  They had a better flavor.  We also cut up a regular baking potato and cooked it with the sweet potato.

I slice mine and use the ziplock bag method, I find that gets them evenly coated and not too greasy. Try curry powder - thats my favorite!

Ive tried this recipe before but instead we sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the fries just when you take them out of the oven while they are still hot.

This was very good and very easy. They do taste better at room temperature as Christine L said. I followed others suggestions and 1) added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp salt and 1 Tbls brown sugar for 4 average size potatoes. However, when I added all these additional seasonings, I found it too pasty so I added an additional Tbs of olive oil....worked out perfectly. 2) I cut the potatoes in 1/4 inch rounds using my food processor. I too found that they cooked in about 20 minutes. Thank you for this recipe and thank you fellow reviewers for all your suggestions!!! This is a keeper!

I guess I am just used to and like the brown sugar and butter method to sweet potatoes.  I just don't think this recipe was for us.  We did cook them a bit longer than the recipe called for and they did end up a bit greasy.  I thank you for the post.

I boiled my sweet potatoes first for about 20 minutes. Then peeled them, cut them into sticks layed on baking sheet and then drizzled olive oil over them, salted them and sprinkled brown sugar on them. Then baked for 30 minutes. They turned out crispy and wonderful.

I love these.  I cut my potatoes into much smaller slices than one quarter, more the size of regular french fries.  Because they were smaller, it took them only 20 minutes to bake.  One large sweet potato was enough for two people (as a side dish).  Very good!

Cutting the sticks thinner definitely helps. These were delicious! We dipped them in ranch dressing when served, and kept whatever was leftover...they're even better cold the next day! Thanks for submitting.

Really yummy and so much better for you than white potatoes. I like to add additional spices as other reviewers have suggested. I use cinnamon sugar on them when I'm serving pork chops. Add a green veggie and baked apples and you've got a delicious, easy autumn meal.

Loved this!  I sliced the potatoes into more of a julienne size (like fries) and took the advice of some other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of garlic powder, and 1 tbsp of brown sugar.  The smaller size reduced the cooking time to 25 minutes.  It was delicious!  Perfect with my chicken fingers.  Thanks for the idea!

With a few tweaks (following other reviewers' advice) this was a FABULOUS new way to do sweet potatoes. We skinned the potatoes then sliced them into circles (just easier to cut that way). Then I sprayed both sides with olive oil spray. In a zip-loc bag, I mixed brown sugar, paprika, chili powder, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to taste. Then I shook the potatoes in the bag, put them on a foil-lined cookie sheet and baked at 425 for 45 minutes. My boyfriend and I raved about them. Great, great treat.

These were great! My turkey was cooking in the oven so I made them in a toaster oven...still great! and I only used about 2 sweet potatoes but still stuck to the amount of olive oil and paprika, nothing is needed to be changed. Although, rather than stirring I put them in a plastic tuber-wear container with the lid on and shook it so the olive oil-paprika mixture would coat all my sticks

This is fantastic.... Things to note: 1) Slice the sweet potato as thin as you can manage.  Don't do wedges.  I quartered the potato, and then sliced each quarter thin.  2) I only used one potato for the first time. It was gone by the end of the night! 3) The thinner you slice the potatoes, the shorter your cooking time will be.  I went the whole 40 minutes and some of my potatoes were a bit blackened.  HOWEVER, I found the lightly charred flavor to be excellent.  Don't discard those until you try them. 4) I did paprika and salt.  5) I would agree that they're even better at room temperature.

HOWEVER, I found the lightly charred flavor to be excellent.  Don't discard those until you try them. 4) I did paprika and salt.  5) I would agree that they're even better at room temperature.

I cooked these up to go with some bacon-wrapped chicken tenders and a green salad with honey mustard. They were so good me and my dad ate them all, even though it was enough for 4! I added a little bit of seasoning salt and 1/4 tsp of cayenne and shook them up to in a bag to evenly distribute. Will definitely be making these again!

Was going to use smoked paprika but couldn't find it so I used half sharp Hungarian.  I used mandolin to cut rounds to make for easy flipping and even cooking. Really good, will be using this a lot.

My 11 year old daughter and I make these all the time. We add a liitle sea salt and cracked black pepper too. We spray them with olive oil spray to reduce the fat. We gobble them up in no time.

Made mine shoe-string and followed the recipe. I think the paprika was wonderful, though I did add some salt after trying them. For those saying they aren't crisp, just accept that they won't be. Nor is there anything in the recipe that says they will be, so please don't knock the recipe for that. These aren't fried they are baked. I baked mine on a wire rack and they still didn't crisp up. Fact is you have to fry them to get them crunchy. But though they aren't crunchy, they are very tasty. Surprisingly, even with them cut as shoe-strings, they took over 25 minutes to cook, so keep your timing in mind. Anyway, thanks for a great recipe. I will make these again.

I have been making these for years.  Typically I do peel them.  I add the spices of choice (usually paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, salt, pepper).  No matter how you spice them, they are good.  If you do not want a 'soggy'fry...then you need to find a recipe that uses a deep fryer.  These are 'limp'...but they are not flash froze, deep fried and full of chemicals.  Enjoy them as is.

I love sweet potatoes! They are naturally sweet and good for you. This did not take much effort to cut these up, season with paprika and a little olive oil. I was only serving two people so I had one large yam, cut up into sticks or wedges. I placed the potatoes onto a baking that I lined with aluminum foil. I used my hands to mix the potatoes up to ensure they were evenly oiled. Half way through the baking process I flipped them over to bake the other side. They were done and ready to eat in 40 minutes. We did not need to dip them into ketchup or other dipping sauces because are sweetened up already. No only did everyone love these sweet potatoes but they ate these up so fast right before my eyes! This is a very tasty, naturally sweet side dish that is also healthy for you too. Best thing about this is it did not take me long to make these and they were baked, not deep fried. I served these sides with Seasoned Turkey Burgers.

These were pretty good. Mine did not crisp like I wanted them to. My 3 year old did not approve. I will try again and see if I can get them more crispy.

I love me some sweet potato fries.  To cook faster I cut into half-rounds which down the cook time by about 20 minutes.  They tasted great hot, warm and at room temperature.

These were good, but I think I put too much oil because they came out a little soggy. Instead of paprika I used brown sugar and cinnamon. Very good!

Great way to eat sweet potatoes and get your fiber.  Like others, we cut them thinner and throw in some garlic powder, black pepper, and sea salt along with the paprika.  A ziplock bag is really the easiest way to get them coated well.

I used a slicer and sliced them thin. Mixed olive oil, paprika, and garlic powder. layed them on foil lined (sprayed with PAM) baking sheet, brushed on light coating of mixture and then sprinkled with Seasoning Salt.  Baked at 450 for about 20-25 min.  Crispy! Yummy!

Yum! 
I made the slices more like large french fries, turning once while cooking so they browned on more then one side. Used Olive oil Cooking spray on the cookie sheet and then once on the sweet potatoes themselves, sprinkled a pinch of salt on them. I then baked for approx 20 minutes, depending on thickness of slices. When out of oven and still on tray sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. I suppose splenda and sugar would be good if watching you calories. YUM! YUM! YUM! 
Great as a light lunch with a salad. 
I WILL make these again!

tasty, but I cannot for the life of me get these to be crispy on the outside!  I've made them at least a dozen times, and varied the cooking time and temperature in every way possible, but every time they come out mushy!

Mmmm!  I used a seasoning mix of onion powder, garlic powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne.  On the advice of others, I used the ziplock method and cut the sweets into rounds rather than sticks.

I really like sweet potatoes anyway so I liked these of course.  I did try adding a little garlic salt and that was yummy.  However...they weren't at all crispy..very soft.  I was hoping for crispy.  I tried putting them under the broiler for a few minutes, which helped but they were getting cooked too much. 
No one else in my family likes sweet potatoes.  Their take on this?  No one liked them.  Maybe if I could get them crispy. I will try them again to see if I can't perfect the cooking part.

I think that I cut the potatoes smaller than the original recipe because they were overdone following the directions exactly.  I did use chili powder, garlic salt and pepper for seasoning.  I'll definitely be making these again as I enjoyed the change of pace.

This is the best recipe I have found on the site.  I took the advice to use garlic powder, chili powder, salt and pepper with olive oil in a plastic bag.  It can be difficult to slice the sweet potatoes so use a sharp knife.  I recommend slicing the outside of the potato, the "skin", off in large flat sections like potato chips.  Cook at 375 for an hour and flip once, you won't regret it!

These cooked just as described, good texture. I added garlic salt and thyme (yes, thyme!)along with a little salt and generous black pepper, as well as the 1/2 tsp paprika. Everyone voted "keeper" on this recipe.

A bit greasy for our taste.  Used a spray bottle with olive oil in it and sprayed the potato sticks. For a twist I coated with Taco Seasoning (the light - less salt) variety.  They turned out great especially for those who don't care for sweet potatoes and are on diabetic diets, etc.  These are great and everyone I've given the recipe to always let me know how glad they are they have this recipe.  Thank you Christine!!!!

I loved these potatoes.  I would say to save time and clean up, brush olive oil on the potatoes and sprinkle with paprika.  I would also say cook for only 35-45 minutes.  They were fork done at that time.

Mine burned and I don't think they need to cook for 60 min., I'd say 40 min. - flipping the wedges half way through. I only used 2 sweet potatoes - so maybe this was too much oil. I used a ziploc bag to toss them in. I will try again with the decreased cooking time and less oil for the smaller portion.

These came out quite soggy.  I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes so only my husband and 4 year old ate them.  My husband said he would prefer them more crispy.  I noticed that a lot of reviewers had a similar problem even though trying different oven temps and times.  Hmmm, I'll go ask on the buzz.  I'm sure some of those fine folks will have some ideas.  Thanks for the recipe.

I LOVE these! I never thought I'd like sweet potatoes other than mashed, but I was wrong. This recipe lets you tailor to your tastes. I've made them a few times now, and the last time I cut them across into round slices and added cajun spices with a little bit of brown sugar. My whole family, from elderly to teen, has loved one version of these or another. Sweet potatoes are now on my shopping list every week!

I have to admit I did a couple changes, but it turned out so tasty!  :D  I added to the seasonings: salt, pepper & cinnamon-sugar.  I also microwaved the slices (~5 min) to give them a head-start on baking, before the oil & seasoning step.  Will make many, many more times!

I tried both the cinnamon and the spicy versions.  The spicy version won with garlic & onion powder & paparika.  I will add cayenne & chilli pepper next time. They were surprisingly good with ketchup. I baked one type in a glass pan & the other in a dark metal pan.  The ones in the dark metal pan came out the crispiest. Very healthy snack.

These sweet potato sticks were suprisingly good! I did add extra seasonings (salt, black pepper, season salt and garlic powder) to spice up the recipe though. Overall the recipe is a really good idea! I would have liked for the sticks to be a little more crispy, but I guess you can't expect to get that from oven cooking them.

These were really good, with some very minor modifications. I followed another reviewer's suggestion to add garlic powder, salt and pepper along with the paprika. I just made one for myself, cut it into eighths instead of quarters, and didn't measure the ingredients -- just enough olive oil to coat, and then I sprinkled seasoning on it. I was very surprised how good it was. I usually season baked sweet potatoes with cinnamon and sugar, but I'm on a diet and these were delicious and sweet enough on their own. One case where cutting calories did not hurt the flavor -- I will make them this way from now on. Also, I liked the taste of the bigger wedges better than the thinner fries I usually make. All sweet and perfect texture, with no burned fries. Thanks for the recipe!

These were so good, I cut the potatoes into 3/4 inch slices and covered them with oil, paprika, garlic plus, cumin and a bit of chili powder, salt and pepper. Mixed everything in a bowl, massaging the herbs into the potatoes. Baked in a 350 degree oven on a foil lined baking sheet for 40 minutes turning halfway. I baked at 350 because I also was cooking chicken and roasted cauliflower (from this site) and everything was done at the same time.

Seriously easy and preserves the flavor of the potato, the whole reason I buy them!  Tip: buy smaller sweet potatoes for less baking time.  Thanks for such an easy and healthy way to eat a great potato.

Made with extra paprika and added salt and pepper - was amazing!  Yes -  these little buggers are hard to cut, but well worth the chore.  Use a meat pounder for added help.  Love this and will make them again!

These were just ok. I made them exactly as directed and they were a little bland and soggy. My husband didn't want to save them, either. Thanks anyway, though! I bet they would be good with some revisions.

Sorry but these just weren't good. The cooking time listed isn't accurate. They were super mushy. I won't make them again.

These are addictive! I have used several different spices including Cajun seasonings, garlic, onion salt and even a dash of cayenne.  I have tried them cutting oil in half and used cooking spray instead to make even lower in fat.  Try them seasoned to your taste.  GREAT for snacking.

This is a good basic recipe.  I like it but there's no "wow" factor to make it a 5-star rating.  Like others, I put everything in a large Ziploc bag along with several other items from my spice rack: garlic powder, onion salt, etc.

The simplicity of this recipe implies that it would be good for a beginner, however the directions do not state to flip/turn the fries at any point. My budding learner followed the directions to the "T" and was disappointed they were black on the bottoms. She received an "A" for effort on her assignment despite the poor recipe results.

Eat them hot, cold, or at room temperature... they are good either way... but then again I love sweet potatoes... like other reviews I experimented with other spices... the classic cinnamon and brown sugar was good... so was garlic salt... and paprika was good.... I guess what ever flavor you want to go for give it a try... I put the sticks in a zip-lock bag with the oil and tossed to coat then sprinkled the seasoning over the top... experiment with this one to find what you like if your not a fan of paprika

This is a great recipe.  I peeled the potatoes and sliced them into round pieces.  I also used a ziplop bag to shake them in.  My husband and I love them!  Thanks for sharing.

Definitely needs more spices, perhaps a little salt.  Otherwise, I really enjoyed them, peeling and all.

The entire family loved these... I followed the recipe except for a cut them a little smaller (they were way too big to only be quartered).  We will make these often!

I love sweet potatoes, but not the sugary syrupy marshmallow-y kind, so I was looking for a more savory recipe.  This was awesome.  
I played around with the seasonings too.  I think my favorite (so far) was paprika, cayenne pepper, tarragon, and cinnamon.  I look forward to more experiments from the spice rack, this is a great and versatile base.

I love sweet potatoes! They are naturally sweet and good for you. This did not take much effort to cut these up, season with paprika and a little olive oil. I was only serving two people so I had one large yam, cut up into sticks or wedges. I placed the potatoes onto a baking that I lined with aluminum foil. I used my hands to mix the potatoes up to ensure they were evenly oiled. Half way through the baking process I flipped them over to bake the other side. They were done and ready to eat in 40 minutes. We did not need to dip them into ketchup or other dipping sauces because are sweetened up already. No only did everyone love these sweet potatoes but they ate these up so fast right before my eyes! This is a very tasty, naturally sweet side dish that is also healthy for you too. Best thing about this is it did not take me long to make these and they were baked, not deep fried. I served these sides with Seasoned Turkey Burgers.

the spice/herb combo is endless.  i won't list the many i've used, just use what you love!!  it's wonderful to get away from the butter/cinnamon/brown sugar/salt combo.  the recom. temp and time is great, then use your imagination!!  only reason didn't give it a 5 is because ingredients listed was limited.

Just did not work for us. Limp, no flavor from the paprika- might be good with other spices but we will not be trying that due to the limpness factor.

I don't like sweet potatoes usually but these were good.  I added salt of course and that gave it a salty/sweet taste which I like.  I wish mine had come out a little crispier on the outside so maybe I should have fried them but was trying to avoid the oil.

I have never been a big fan of sweet potatoes. I always wanted to like them because they are so healthy, but I don't really like them plain baked or in sweet concoctions. This way of preparing them turned me into a total sweet potato fan. These were so good! I have made them several times since discovering this recipe. The only change I implemented was adding a pinch of garlic salt as suggested by some other reviewers. My husband and my mom like them as well.

Fabulous! I was addicted to these for quite awhile. I usually dump on Chili Powder and a little Cayenne for some heat. I bake at 425 for 25 minutes. Made them when my brother was over and he couldn't get enough of them. Oh, and I usually use yams.

I baked these for a potluck and guests raved over the taste, even though I baked them a little too long so they didn't look pretty.  I added equal amount of cinnamon with the paprika, plus a dash of coarse salt, and used food processor to make lengthwise oval slices. Next time I'll stick to the steak cut fry slices, which will undoubtedly hold their shape better during transfer from baking sheet to serving plate.

I baked these for a potluck and guests raved over the taste, even though I baked them a little too long so they didn't look pretty.  I added equal amount of cinnamon with the paprika, plus a dash of coarse salt, and used food processor to make lengthwise oval slices. Next time I'll stick to the steak cut fry slices, which will undoubtedly hold their shape better during transfer from baking sheet to serving plate.

These were good, but I think I cut mine too thin.  They came out mushy.  I would prefer them more crisp on the outside like a french fry.  I used the brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon suggestion made by another reviewer.  I really liked it. We then dipped them in Honey Mustard.  YUM!  I will try again!

Yummy - these are delicious!  I didn't do it right - I way overcrowded my pan and cut them to skinny but they were still yummy!  Next time I'll try to make more of a wedge shape and use less so they won't overlap on the pan.

These were good, but never got crispy.  I did bake mine on a cooling rack on a cookie sheet, so maybe that was the problem.

These are so easy and fun.  A great way to add some variety to any main dish.  I've made them many times, and they are a family favorite.

I give this recipe 3 stars because I did several alterations after reading other reviews.  I think paprika alone would be too plain so here it what I did... Microwaved 4 sweet potatoes for 5 min Peel & slice into 1/4" slices. Brush lightly with olive oil Add 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp sea salt to a zip bag.   Put sliced sweet potatoes in bag & shake.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20 min, broil for 1-2 min. Great alternative to french fries, has a nice sweet & mild flavor.

easy, breezy, healthy! the smoky paprika works well w/ the sweetness of the potato (as well as ranch dressing), so i used a lot. i also liberally applied salt for more of a "fry" feel. using others' comments, i cut the potato into fries and used a ziplock bag to coat.

With a little tweaking this could be a 5 star recipe.  I had Sweet potato fries at a ski resort in Colorado that were fabulous.  These need more spices and oil, especially salt & pepper.  I've made these several times now and they are better when backed in round slices or thinner, fri-like strips to make them crispier and more flavorul.

AMAZING! I placed the sticks in a large bowl and mixed w/ the olive oil and lots of minced garlic and parsley and salt. The result were some of the most delicious fries - my husband even thought they topped the garlic fries at red robin. We will definitely make again.

Not too bad, as far as sweet potatoes go! They're no McDonald's fries, but they're pretty good. We used the honey butter for dipping as another user suggested, and that really helped.

I have been baking Sweet Potato Fries for a number of years ever since we tried regular Sweet Potato Fries at a weekend type of Farmer's Market. They were served with a dallop of honey butter. A spoonful of honey butter on each serving makes this a real treat. To make honey butter just mix two or three tablespoons of honey into a half cup of soft butter. Do not melt the butter, just serve it at room temperature with the hot fries.  You could add some cinnamon but we like it plain. Yum. Kids of all ages love this.

For how simple this side dish is, it certianly delivered! Everyone kept going back for seconds and thirds...and since the sweet potato selection at the grocery store wasn't too great, I ended up making a few batches with sweet potatoes and a few batches with yams. The yams were actually my favorite since they were a bit sweeter. For dipping I made an easy sauce by blending a couple of chipotle peppers (seeds removed) with a bottle of ranch dressing. If you want to make this dip you can buy canned chipotle in adobo sauce at the store, gradually add the peppers to blender until desired spicyness.

Very simple and quick fix if you feel like having healthy fries! You can really use a variety of spices to flavor them differently. I used some cajun spice mix and it was delicious. 

Also, I cut my sweet potatoes about McDonald's size and baking for 40 mins turned out being too long for them (they were burnt). Perhaps 30 mins for thinner strips would do.

Very good and healthy alternative to french fries.  I used cinnamon instead of paprika.  I slice mine a bit thinner than the recipe calls for.  They are better at room temperature, as another reviewer mentioned. My family loved them.  I've made them twice already and will make them again and again.

These were wonderful! I used my Big Mouth Chopper french fry blade and made small fries.  I sprayed them with spray butter, sprinkled paprika, garlic powder and salt & pepper. Because they were smaller they only took 20 minutes at 400.  I will be making these again.

We are really big sweet potato fans and enjoyed this recipe.  I cooked them on 350 for 50 minutes and topped them with brown sugar and garlic salt.  A great combination! I really liked the crunchy outside and soft inside.

Wonderful!  I can't seem to stop making them now.  Used lots of seasoning, especially granulated garlic, salt and pepper.  I did take the previous advice and turn the heat down a little.  love the crispiness though - so cooked about 50 minutes.  Also a great way to get your loved ones to eat antioxidants.  They are so very good for you!

I just took mine out of the oven and they're great! The recipe says best served room temperature, but they were pretty great straight from the oven.  I've never made sweet potatoes before, but will definately be making these again.

everybody likes french fries. I use a large Chinese cleaver for cutting. 
Cut thin like 3" long matchsticks, roasted for 22 minutes, quicker.

They were good, but too soft and mushy.  I think they would have tasted better if they were a little firmer.  I sliced them into waffle fries.  I used olive oil, smoked paprika, salt, pepper and a little cinnamon to flavor them.

I wondered why the recipe called for such little oil and paprika, thinking to myself as I put the sweet potatoes in the oven that they were barely coated. The paprika added just the perfect amount of kick to the potatoes. I can't wait to make these for my friends and family.

I made these today and they were awesome. The reason it gets a 4 star is because the recipe wouldn't be great without modifications. I added garlic powder, salt and pepper in addition to the paprika and oil. I baked at 350 for 50 minutes and they were nice and soft. If you'd like them a bit crunchier on the outside I would suggest baking at 400 for 40 minutes.

I peeled them and microwaved them for 5 minutes (so it was easier to cut them into strips).  I sliced them and put them in a plastic bag with olive oil, brown sugar and cinnamon.  Baked them for 30 minutes at 425 degrees (that was the temp I needed for my fish sticks).  They worked out great, but I would choose a different seasoning.  Maybe I should go with the recipe and use the paprika!

Was really excited about this recipe as a great way to get my toddler to eat this super food, however they just didn't turn out well. They were really soft when I expected them to be at least a little crisp.  The taste was okay, but I'd rather just make baked sweet potatoes.

This is a great recipe for an afternoon snack, while watching the game.  So much better with sweet potatoes than white potatoes.

Most of my family really liked this dish.  I sprayed the pan with olive oil first.  Otherwise, I went by the recipe.  We ate them with honey mustard and Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce.

They didn't go over the best. I have tried these twice using some different spices the second time. I overspiced it but it went well with the sweetness of the sticks. I won't be making this again. The kids won't eat it.

If you like sweet potatoes the way they ar (slightly sweet), this is a great recipe to use! I tried other other suggestions, such as adding different spices and powders, but preferred using just salt, paprika, and oil, with the sweet potatoes cut into 1-2 inch chunks. The sweet potatoes come out sweet with a slight taste of paprika. I've used this recipe over and over, and it's a popular side at the dinner table. Glad I found this recipe!

I made these in a toaster oven (no room for a standard oven in my apartment), so I adjusted the time and temperature, and cut the sweet potatoes very thinly. A great side dish to add excitement to a meal of leftovers. I think next time I will peel the sweet potatoes first, and maybe add some salt.

I liked these.  I didn't read carefully and sliced the potatos into fries-type sticks.  The cook time was perfect.  I couldn't tell that the paprika did anything for the potatoes.  I added a little salt. ***2nd time I cut them according to recipe. Still can't tell the paprika did anything, but they are a different way to fix sweet potatoes.

I made a few changes so I'm not sure I should even be rating it! I used one sweet potato cut in small pieces, lots of garlic salt and chili powder (about 1 tsp each), and cooking spray. I shook all the ingredients together in a bag and then baked as directed. Tasted awesome - crispy outsides, soft insides! I can't wait to make it again!

The paprika gave this a really great sweet flavor. I think my "sticks" were a little too Texas-sized (ie big) and didn't crisp enough as a result..  so next time I'll probably cut them down a little slimmer.. I also added a dash of kosher salt to these - YUM!

I found this recipe a couple of years ago when I discovered that I love sweet potatoes and I now make this all the time. I love how you can customize it for whatever spices you prefer, personally I use a little rosemary and salt, but they taste great with onion powder and garlic too.  I prefer to either cut them into thin wedges or discs rather than the sticks, so they get a little crunchier. I also usually put the heat a little lower, at 375, and then cook for about 50 minutes unless I cut them really thin in which case you can usually eyeball them and tell when they're getting crunchy:)

This was a great recipe! My 3 yr old and me ate the whole plate in about 10 minutes so I had to make another so we can snack on them during the week. I microwaved 2 large sweet potatoes then peeled them and sliced them so they were round. I lined my baking pan with aluminum foil and added olive oil, tony's seasoning, and garlic powder. I laid the slices down on the mixture and stirred them around until they were coated. I cooked them for 10 mins on 350 then turned and cooked another 10 minutes. Wonderful and healthy recipe. Thanks!

Great base recipe. Start checking at 30 minutes; for my stove, 40 minutes is too long.

The concept is great but they require more seasoning. I added garlic salt, but it could use more. The ziplock bag method is good for mixing. And definitely bake longer for a french fry crisp. Also, SERVE IMMEDIATELY - they were a soggy mess the next day.

Thanks for this. Simple and easy for the single guy. I didn't have paprika and wound up using garam masala, an Indian spice mix. They came out really well.

These were fantastic! I cut them smaller to make them more like sweet potato fries and they were perfect. Couldn't really taste the paprika. Once they start to cool off they have a great flavour. Will definitley make these again - great flavour, super easy and I have half a sweet potato left over. Maybe I'll make more today.

These are really good, a healthy alternative to french fries! They do need a little something to boost the flavor; I may add some cinnamon next time. I really enjoyed these!

I really enjoyed these, but made some changes to the recipe, because other reviewers complained of lack of flavor. I added some garlic powder and salt to the paprika, and may also try some with cinnamon. I cut my potatoes into 1/4" fries, and lined my baking pan with foil so that they wouldn't stick. The fries turned out well, but a couple burned because they needed to be stirred more often. All in all, this was a very tasty recipe, and I will make it again!

Even my husband who is not crazy about sweet potato took to this one... We love spice but didn't have paprika so used a Cajun seasoning which I used liberally. I probably cut the sweet potatoes a little too thin so will do the wedges next time but everyone in my family loves this at dinner and as a grazing snack!

This was fabulous!  I did a few modifications to speed it up and make it to our taste.  We'll definitely be making this again!  
  Modifications:  thinly sliced; microwaved for 3 minutes; brushed with olive oil, paprika, salt, pepper & a touch of cinnamon sugar; baked on broiling pan 30 minutes.  Delicious!

I made this tonight with pre-cut sweet potato sticks. I not only used paprika,
but I also used Johnny's seasoning salt, garlic powder, a little ground red pepper
and black pepper. I served it with the 
Secret Burger Sauce from this site and 
homemade ranch dressing.

I'll have to remember to coat the pan next time so they don't stick.

Kids ate them up. They especially liked that they were a pretty orange color, not like the normal oven fries I make. We all liked them, just with more seasoning. I'll be sure to make them again.

Hubby and I are on the South Beach diet and can't have white potatoes. However, sweet potatoes are allowed and this is the only way I can get him to eat them! This is a great base recipe -- I like to use different spices depending on what I'm serving them with. (Our favorite is chili powder with just a pinch of Splenda brown sugar.) Believe it or not, these are fantastic dipped in a little sour cream!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I was making for T-day meal I cut the potatos into french fry size slices and used the Savory option (paprika,chili powder etc.) and made also the sweet option.
I made the olive oil w/ ginger,clove,nutmeg,allspice and cinnimon.  Cooked as directed, then melted butter and added dark brown sugar and made a glaze.  After the potatos were done placed them in a serving dish and drizzled the brown sugar glaze on top, both kinds went over well. This was at a house where very few liked sweet potatoes

I modified this recipe and used some Old Bay instead of paprika. . .and it was delicious (if you like old bay).  I make them every time I cook big meals for friends, and they are always amazed that they like them!

As written, it's probably 4-stars, but with a tiny bit of tweaking, it was AWESOME at our house.  I peeled and cut the sweet potatoes in half and then into pieces slightly bigger than matchsticks.  Tossed them in olive oil, seasoned with paprika, season salt and garlic salt.  Baked at 400 for 35 min and broiled a bit with the main dish (Broiled Parmesean Tilapia from this site).  Delicious!!  We'll make them again often!

This recipe has the potential to be super yummy, but I've made it twice and haven't had great results with texture.  The 1 tbsp of oil resulted in them being too dry, so the second time I used a little more oil, but they came out too soggy.  I sliced the potatoes in rounds instead of sticks both times.  I'll probably give it one more go because they do taste good.

I make a large quantity (7 lbs) for a backyard barbecue. I started out making the "sticks" which were very good.  I was having trouble cutting the larger potatoes into sticks, so I decided to make smaller servings of round disks of the sweet pototoes. These were much better than the sticks, in my opinion. The fleshy side that laid on the pan had a slight "scorch" from the pan and was oh so good!

I loved this recipe.  I also baked some Yukon Gold sticks for my BF following this recipe because I was convinced  he wouldn't even try the sweet potato.  We ended up sharing half of each other's!  My only complaint is that it was very difficult to cut the sweet potato so next time, I will follow other reviewers and cut the potato into slices.

Wow! These are delicious! Healthy, natural food and easy to make with the exception of cutting the potatoes. For some strange reason, we couldn't find our Paprika so we just sprayed with a little olive oil and salt. We will definitely make these again! Thanks for the recipe!

It was so easy to make (well, apart from the cutting part)... I've made two batches today, one cut as juliennes and one as circles. Both are vanishing fast! Note to self: must learn to cut evenly. Otherwise some pieces are burnt while others are barely done. P.S. - Bless the reviewer who suggested using foil on the baking tray :-)

I just happened to stumble across this recipe and almost didn't make it because it looked too simple.  So glad I gave it a try.  These were fabulous (although they weren't crispy and never will be crispy unless you deep fry them).  I did add some garlic salt and sea salt, and cut them in rounds just because it was so much easier.  Also flipped them at 20 minutes and then let them cook an additional 20 minutes.  The college boy loved them and wanted the recipe to share with his girlfriend!  The vegetable hating 17 year old said they weren't bad, which is about the highest praise you can get.  Thanks for a simple and great recipe.

Yum!  The whole family loved this.  It's a lot tastier and healthier than butter and brown sugar drenched sweet potatoes.

I've made this recipe 4 times. 1st time I read the reviews, but followed the recipe exactly--except I cut the S.P. in rounds rather than wedges. Loved the S.P., but the paprika seasoning was not to my taste. I then tried: 1.cinnamon and brown sugar 2.Cajun and lastly, 3.curry powder. The curry is my favorite. As previously stated, these are not crunchy. It does not matter--they are delicious! Find your favorite spice to add with the oil, and you will love these! I'm making a big batch for a get together, and made raita for those who may want a creamy dollop on top to compliment the curry!

Bake them until they are well done - a bit crunchy was not as good as the smaller ones that were well done and very soft.  These are a fine product, but I will just boil and serve in future, no need to bother with baking the sweet potatoes, unless the oven is already on.

A big hit with everyone in the house, and that's saying something. My teen would have preferred them fried, but they are so much healthier this way that I wouldn't change a thing. I used two BIG potatoes and cut them in sixths or smaller. I left one unpeeled and used paprika, adding garlic salt and rosemary per others' suggestions.  The other potato I peeled (then had to use quickly, as it seemed to want to turn brown), and used brown sugar and a little garlic salt. Some of my family preferred them this way, although I liked the savory ones better. Microwaving them about 3 minutes before slicing made them easier to slice but a bit messy in a couple of places due to being too soft to handle well...will probably skip this next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was the basic idea of what I wanted so I took recommendations from other reviewers. I did not want to eat the skin so I peeled and thinly sliced 1 large Yam, more than enough for 2 people.  I also used a plastic bag to shake the ingredients. You can use your own preferred spices.  I copied another reviewer who used cinnamon, nutmeg, salt and brown sugar.  Don't forget the olive oil.  I was light on the olive oil and mine were a little dry.  I think a good coating will help with that next time.  Since I cut mine thin, I reduced the cooking time down to 20 min. which I found to be a definite time saver.  They probably could have been checked at 15 min.  Since yams are so good for you and my boyfriend liked them I will be making them again.  I may alter it and try new spices just to see what I'm missing.  Like garlic and paprika.

Tried slicing in the food processor like another suggested, but came out with dried up, chewy potato slices, not baked and crispy.  Needs tweaking if I were to make again.

The original sounded too bland to me, so I added garlic powder and salt - which made it pretty good. I found that the cooking time was too long for my oven though.. maybe 30min would have been better.

This is a winner!  Made mine with garlic powder and paprika.  Tossed in a baggie and let it sit until ready to cook.  I peeled the sweet potatoes until all the pale white was off the outsides and then sliced them about 3/4 inch thick.  400 degrees for an hour on a sprayed cookie sheet.  Will be making this again.

These were.... okay. Just ho hum. Granted, it was my first time having any sweet potatoes at all, so I don't have a base line to judge from. I found I did like the vegetable, but this was a little bland. I added some generic seasoning blend and it was better.

Awesome! I never thought to add paprika to them, although I couldn't really taste it. But nontheless they were very good.

I also make baked sweet potato fries regularly. I use the ziploc bag method as well.  To cut fat, I use a few sprays of butter and/or Canola Oil spray and usually spice with garlic powder, onion powder, fresh ground black pepper and a sprinkle of shredded asiago cheese.  I'm not a big fan of adding salt, but that's person preference. Most recently I've added a sprinkle of fennel seeds to the mix...adds a nice, unexpected flavor..

Also try this with yams! Any random variation of spices to suit your taste will do. I made a dip from vegenaise mixed with some garlic, rosemary, thyme and some other random spices. EPIC!

I love this recipe! I have tried these many different ways. My favorite is to use lipton onion soup mix instead of paprika. Also, if I am short on time, I cut them into sticks but then cut them in half or even thirds. They are also really good on the grill. I lay a piece of foil down (so they don't fall through) and cook them on medium heat until they are golden. :) Definitely Delicious any way you season them!

I enjoyed this recipe.  I used fresh garlic and olive oil and made skinny fries.  I also used some celery salt.  I will definitely be making this again.

The flavor was great but I couldn't get my fries to crisp like the ones in restaurants?? I tried several times with no luck! I also tried them 'sweet' with a maple syrup and marshmallow mix for dipping... YUM!

My family was divided on this recipe. My husband and daughter loved them. My 2 boys and I thought they were 'okay'. They are worth a try. I put my oil and spices in a ziplock bag. We used paprika, salt, pepper, and a little garlic powder. I sprinkled a few with chili powder as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Fantastic and so easy! This recipes just goes to show you don't need sugar for sweet potatoes. I couldn't stop eating them! I premixed the olive oil and paprika then added the sliced sweet potatoes and oil mix in a zip lock bag, shook to coat then spread them out on a foil lined cookie sheet to bake.  We ate these with the turkey feta burgers, delicious.

They burnt at 40 minutes (should have read reviews first). Tried again and done at 25 minutes. They weren't as crisp as I would have liked, so tried again and brushed fries with egg whites - crispy goodness!!!

I just eyed my spice mixture.  A dew tablespoons of olive oil, a tablespoon of garlic powder, some lemon pepper, and a tablespoon of paprika.  Put them all in a ziploc, put in one large sliced sweet potato and sealed ziploc bag, shook it all around to cover everything.  Poured onto a foil covered cookie sheet and baked at 350 for 40 minutes.  Came out soft, sweet and really good and filling!

I thought these were very good and would make them again.  I added salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I also reheated them the next morning for breakfast by lightly frying them in butter.  Very Yummy.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe. I made as written but added salt and peeled my sweet potatoes. They came out crispy and spicy on the outside and soft and sweet on the inside. I had to bake them a bit longer the written. Lovely!

Even better than I imagined! I suggest using much more paprika, and also adding salt. LIke others, I found 40 minutes to be way too long. I took them out at 35 minutes and already a few were burned, so I'd suggest 25 to 30.

I had half of a really nice home-grown sweet potato that I needed to use.  Had made sweet potato fries before, but with different seasonings.  I added a little garlic powder and salt to the paprika and it was great!  Be sure to cut the potatoes in thin sticks and stir several times during baking to make them crispier...

Very delicious! I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder as well. I do not particularly like sweet potatoes so I may need to increase the amount of spice and salt to 'mask' the sweetness a bit in the future. Also, I don't think the sweet potatoes I buy are organic so next time I will go safe and peel them before I cook them. The skins are delicious but I don't want to risk adding pesticides to my dish. Anyway, I'm having these as a snack and they are delicious!

These were alright, probably my favorite way to eat sweet potatoes - but I never was a big fan. They were very time consuming, and kind of limp and soggy. A great idea, but it definitely needs some tinkering.

Yummy recipe!  I made these for a family lunch on New Year's day and the garlic/onion/salt/pepper version was the hands-down favorite.  I was wary of trying that combination on sweet potatoes, but it was tasty.  Made great left-overs too.

I thought this was a waste of a good sweet potato.  They were limp and went cold very fast.

I really enjoy baked sweet potatos.  I use taco seasoning instead of paprika.  Sounds odd, but is very tasty.

These are one of my most favorite items to eat and they are soooo easy! I cut them thinner also - even my 10 yr old son loves them! This is a quick, easy, foolproof recipe (even though it takes a while to cook!) A family favorite.

Great recipe! I cut the potatoes thinner and added olive oil, salt, pepper and fresh rosemary. I also kept in the oven a little over 40 minutes because we like it better when is crunchy.

Pretty good, but nothing special.  We used 3 sweet potatoes and cubed then instead of making sticks.

My boyfriend usually won't touch a sweet potato.  He loved these!  I am making them again tonight because they were fantastic!  Such a delicious deviation from the traditional sugary sweet potato recipes - so much depth in flavor.  Unique and de-li-ci-ous!

I don't know why I never did this before.  They were great.  Went very well with the steaks we had last night.  The kids ate these much better than baked sweet potatoes.  I can't wait to play around with the spices I put on them.  Thanks Christine.

This is a great recipe.  The first time I made them like the recipe called, except I used cajun seasoning and they were delicious!  The next time that I made them, I only used a TBSP of butter and 2 TBSP of "sugar in the raw" and they were so yummy!  Goes great with a chef salad!

I really thought that I hated sweet potatoes until recently.  Anyway, I found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  I cut some into sticks and some into rounds, and have decided that the sticks are better.  Based on the advice of another reviewer, I got long skinny potatoes, and they were much easier to cut into sticks.  I also added garlic powder, dried basil, cayenne pepper and onion salt.  The flavor was excellent, but maybe a little to spicy.  I will probably use less cayenne next time :)

Cutting these in rounds are much easier and makes for a quicker cooking time. I season these w/ garlic powder as well, but they can be seasoned w/ any of your favs. I cooked them on one side for under 10 minutes @ 400, turned them over and broiled them for another 5-6 minutes to give them a crunch. I also did not poor olive oil on them, but rather sprayed them w/ olive oil cooking spray. I don't know how to make these crunchy, which is what I am trying for, but I will keep try, as I cannot stand sweet yams and sweet potatoes are so good for your health!

I tried these again after a preliminary failure and rotten rating.  Here is how I made it work out:  first - I tandem cooked so that they would be done when the dinner was:  20 minuites in the microwave, then finished roasting them with the rest of the dinner.  Finished with a broil to crisp them up, and used more spices.  Turned out better.

These were very good, and I thought they baked up nicely.  I'd read some other reviews where people were having problems with the amount of oil, so I cut down the number of sweet potatoes I used down to 5, and there was plenty (but you really do have to get your hands into it, and use a big enough bowl to where the slices don't keep popping out of the bowl, like mine did!)  I may have cut them a little smaller, because they only took about 30 mins to bake (I was baking them with a meatloaf, which needed to be cooked at 350, but they cooked quickly even on the lower heat).  As I said, they were good, but they seemed to kind of be missing something...not much flavor to them.  After tasting them, I sprayed them with a butter flavored spray and sprinkled a little salt and pepper on them.  Easy and a healthy alternative to regular potatoes!

My husband and I tried this with company and found it to be just OK.  We also tried it another time with different spices and it was a bit better but still lacking something.

My husband and I tried this with company and found it to be just OK.  We also tried it another time with different spices and it was a bit better but still lacking something.

SOooo Good!  Love these.  I added kosher salt and a tad bit of sugar.  I found slicing sweet potatoes lengthwise to be difficult.  I might try round slices next time.  I love sweet potatoes and this is another great way to eat them!

I'm sorry, but we couldn't even eat these. I checked on them WAY before the time was up and they were already burning. Also, they were stuck to the pan. I actually ended up just throwing the pan away.

We make this often.  Have found it easier to slice the potato.  Many times I just spray with a vegetable spray and sprinkle a spice of choice. Season-All works very well.

These were great! I read the reviews and added some garlic salt to mine and they came out fantasic! My husband loves these, he used to get them at a cajun resturant, but not anymore, they come from my kitchen now! We serve them with beef or onion gravy, but they are fantasic on their own. My only gripe is the sweet potato is so hard to cut, but well worth the work out wehn you first taste the outcome!

These were great.  I only made one potato and my husband was complaining that there weren't any leftovers.  The taste and consistency were great.  My husband was wary of eating the skins, but the flesh slipped right off them easy enough.  This will be my favorite way of preparing sweet potatoes.

I cut these much thinner than 1/4 of a potato and baked them at 350 so they wouldn't burn.  We like crispy potatoes though so I will bake them at 400 next time.  I used another reviewers suggestion of tossing them in a ziploc with the oil and I used paprika , garlic powder & salt.  They were delicious.  I'm going to make them as one of the many  side dishes for Thanksgiving instead of a heavy casserole with marshmallows....

Neither my husband nor I have ever been a fan of sweet potatoes but other family members are.  We tried this recipe  first to see if it was Thanksgiving-worthy.  It is, we liked them! So we made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.  The fact that they're better at room temp (and they are)  freed up  oven/stovetop space too.  Thank you!

So easy to bake. Great taste! My husband was not to sure about them at first because of strong smell of the paprika while it was baking. It's not a bad smell just the spice has an overwhelming spicy aroma kind of like too much pepper. He loved the taste. Definitely a keeper!

So good. I was skeptical of savory fries and made one potato savory using smoked paprika and sea salt.  Delish! One potato is jn oven and I made that sweet. Can't wait to try it.  Easy and quick.

Quite tasty! They do get a little browned on the bottom if you don't turn them, but did not affect taste. I used paprika, olive oil, garlic powder and onion powder, and shook in a bag.

Easy and delicious, and healthy as well. What's not to like?

I followed the directions other than I used just two sweet potatoes.  Taste was great.  Next time I will broil the last few minutes to make the potatoes crispier.

Delish! Hubby and I both enjoyed these instead of making mashed sweet potatoes. NOTE: I upped the oven temp to 425 to get them done faster - worked fine. Will make again!

This tasted yummy. Thank you! I've also tried them with avocado oil, cinnamon and stevia. (Or you could use sugar). Place all ingredients in large ziplock and mix with rubbing the bag together. Add potatoes and "shake and bake." Thank you everyone for such wonderful recipes. My meals are not so boring anymore! ??

Very good and so simple! I have tried sweet potato fries at restaurants and am always disappointed that I don't like them. I really like this version. I cut them into skinny wedges and reduced the cooking time. I'll make these often!

My favorite is seasoning with brown sugar and cinnamon and drizzling with honey, but this comes close. I doubled the olive oil and used olive oil spray to coat again

SOOOO Delicious! I LOVE these! I found that the thinner pieces were even more tasty because they got a nive crispness that the fatter pieces didn't, so next time I will slice it all thin. Also, I added some onion powder and black pepper and it was even more amazing. Thanks for a great recipe! :) My new favorite snack!

It was ok, but not great. I thought my twin toddlers would like them and they just took a bite and threw them down. We're kind of a "spicey" family and these were just a little too bland for us.

Not bad, I liked it with a little extra salt and spice or it seemed too bland.  I guess I just am programmed to like them with butter and brown sugar.

Like others I cooked for only 20 min. I cut them smaller than in quarters. I added less than 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder and salt. I also ended up adding a little more olive oil since the added dry ingredients makes it pastier and you need it to be liquid.  I would suggest brushing the potatoes with the oil mixture if you decide to do them lengthwise. It would also be good if they were cut in 1/2-3/4 inch rounds. Then maybe use a plastic bag. I had a very hard time trying to coat the lenthwise piece in a 10 in. round bowl. Eating at room temp or just a little warmer is ideal. Hot would be no good.

Good Recipe! I used this recipe as a base and added a few other ingredients: a dry rub of cayenne pepper, salt, cinnamon, and brown sugar.

SOOOO good! This is my favorite way to eat sweet potatoes and no, never really liked them before I tried this. My second favorite way is to just replace the paprika and other spices with cinnamon and follow this recipe otherwise. Do check them and turn them... might burn otherwise. YUM!!!

These are delicious, and a great alternative to french fries.  In fact, I'm not sure that I could tell the difference between the two.  In addition to the paprika (which I used more than stated), I added onion powder, garlic powder and chili powder.

We really liked these.  There's no wow factor like lots of seasoning, but it makes a great side dish anyway.  It is nice to be able to prepare sweet potatoes without all the sugar.

I thoroughly enjoyed these sweet potato sticks! I followed the recipe except for scaling it back for two potatoes and adding a bit of garlic powder.  I will definitely make this one again and experiment further. The only change I would recommend, based on the previous reviewers' suggestions, is to expect to use multiple cookie sheets.  I cut my potatoes into a steak fry size, and the cookie sheets could only reasonably hold about 1 1/2 potatoes.  Great recipe for sweet potato lovers!

Great recipe. I used the seasoning from the Kansas City Style Pork Back Ribs (from the all recipes site)to season the sweet potatoes. I ate the hot and cold. My family loved them. Great for a snack or with dinner. Thanks

Not bad. The taste was a little incomplete and I wasn't fond of the texture. They were less crispy than I anticipated. But I will keep this recipe as a starting point for next time I make sweet potatoes.

These were quite good, but I thought they needed more flavor.  I'll have to try them with some of the other spice suggestions next time.  I also sliced them thinly instead of sticks and I found they cooked very unevenly - some burnt others still wiggly.  I'll have to try them as sticks next time.

we love sweet potatoes and this is a VERY simple way to make a delightful snack. we cut the potatoes in circles, threw them in a ziploc with olive oil, onion and garlic powder, little bit of salt and a generous amount of red pepper. They made the most delicious spicy sweet potatoes ever!

I made these as a side dish for our "Luau" dinner party.  They had GREAT flavor (I used the paprika and added 1/2 tsp of Garlic Salt).  But they were a little mushy.  I would have liked them to be crispy, but I know that is hard with sweet potatoes.  Over all, really good!

This is a good 'method' recipe, meaning you can tweak the spices to own taste but use the oven temp, time, etc (ie method) as your guide.  I used chili powder, paprika, salt, and a touch of cinnamon, nutmeg, and pepper.  The cinnamon and nutmeg gave it a traditional taste but the chili and paprika really made it different.  YUM!

These were a welcome change for baking sweet potatoes.  I tossed with Old Bay as another reviewer suggested.  I made one huge sweet potato and one large white potato together and the sweet potatoes seemed to really soak up the seasoning and came out quite spicy.  YUM. :)

I loved the taste of these, and they are really good cold. I used some additional spices as some people suggested. Great idea and probably hard to mess up. I this recipe with white potatoes and I had to increase the baking time by 10 min.

Loved these. I've also used Chipotle powder which is great if you want a spicier flavour.
Thank you for this recipe

This is a good, basic recipe.  I also added garlic salt.  I love sweet potato fries!

This is a 5 star recipe.  Not because it's unique or complex but because it's so basic and delicious.  I love sweet potatoes!

This is a great recipe.  My sticks were done in 20 mins at 400 degrees.  I wish they were a little crispier though.  As far as flavor goes, this recipe does allow for alot of flexibility.  I went for the chili-paprika-salt-pepper-evoo mix....DELICIOUS!

These were quick and easy to make, but they really need more seasonings to taste better. I would add some cajun seasoning next time.
Overall I thought it was a good healthy snack, better for you than cookies.

These turned out well for me, but unfortunately I had forgotten what the reviews said & didn't add more seasonings.  It was a little bland, but I appreciate the idea...I will certainly be trying it again, with more seasoning. I don't know that I have the patience to slice it into thin rounds, though!

It is delicious, healthy and easy to make. Put in what ever spice or herb you like to your taste.  It tastes best when it is still warm.

Maybe it was just me, but I didn't like this recipe at all.  I love sweet potato sticks.  Maybe the ones I usually order were deep fried.  I will try that instead.

Not as crispy as I expected. I cooked these exactly as outlined, and they were good, but soggy, even when cooled. I expected "chips" sort of. But good, useful recipe, and the suggestions for using a variety of spices is exciting, and something I will try next time.

Nothing to write home about.  Everyone I made them for had to doctor them with butter and brown sugar.

This recipe wasn't what I thought. Sorry. The sticks were not as crispy as I would have liked them. I guess I don't like sweet potatoes made this way.

Wonderful flavor. I only cooked 4 large sweet potatoes for 4 adults and had lots left over. Seems like the ladies enjoyed this dish more than the men but they admitted they were the best sweet potatoes they had ever tasted.
