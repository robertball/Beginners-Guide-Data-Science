Great recipe, not as moist but still great...used it for my brotherÂ´s birthday and everybody liked it.  I used 1 cup less of confectioners sugar and icing came just as good, if you want to have more of prune flavor cut down both the nutmeg and cinnamon.  Overall really tasty and yommi.

Even people who grimace at the idea of prunes love this cake!  I took this to a party yesterday and even I was amazed that it was gone in 10 minutes!  Very good for using prunes that's been sitting around the house for ages.  I also wanted to use up my prune juice so I substituted prune juice for the buttermilk, and the cake turned out just as good.  For the icing, I didn't like the idea of putting in a raw egg yolk so I substituted a few more chopped prunes and added more coffee until I got the right consistency.  This works great when using buttermilk for the cake because the icing becomes more decorative.  However, when I make the prune juice substitution I no longer add prunes to the icing for fear of making the prune taste overbearing.

This recipe is for the cake only. No shortening, so I used butter. Otherwise, I kept close to the recipe only adding a little vanilla flavoring.  Very moist cake, rich in flavor. I frosted it with Coffee Cinnamon Frosting which is also on this site. Good combo together. Next time, I'll use the frosting from this cake recipe because the one I used was a little too wet. My mistake.
