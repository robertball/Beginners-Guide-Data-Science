I love trying out recipes from all corners of the world and when I heard this was an Ethiopian dish, I knew I had to try it out, especially since it was from Chef John. As always,  he did not disappoint. This spice blend turned the regular, bland chicken taste that we're all used to into something completely different. The sauce complemented it real nice. I served it with a bit of mashed cauliflower (we're  trying to watch the carbs) and my wife loved it.

My family makes the authentic Doro Wat from the time they lived in Ethiopia. This was a good take on it. Changed it by added onion to the pan with chicken and only 1/2 lime and whole hard boiled eggs at the end. No cilantro as that is not Ethiopian.  Will definitely make again.

We love Ethiopian food but this is the first time I've made it. Turned out great. Amazing appetizing aroma too. We all loved it.  I used 1 lb breasts, two to a pan (2 pans) but they  weren't cooked through in the times shown so I moved them to a baking dish (without the reduced sauce) and baked for 15 minutes at 350. I poured out all of the pan juices and put most of the reduced sauce on them, leaving some of the sauce so people could add extra if they wanted. The chicken was tender and delicious. FYI: I purchased the berbere spice  at the grocery store (Kroger) rather than making it as the video shows.

I love layers of flavors and this chicken had many. This will be made over and over again at our home. What an amazing treat.

I'm a bit suss on the berbere spice blend I got because it didn't have the lush red vibe going on here. It was still very yummy. I had it coupled with Chef John's Rice Ah Roni!!!

Too much tomato paste- the amount called for just overwhelmed the flavors of everything else, and it tasted like just.. tomato sauce with some spice. I kept adding more coconut milk and berbere but it was still lost to the tomato. Will try again with less tomato paste next time :)

Left out the cilantro because I don't like it, but otherwise did not alter the recipe.  I use berbere a lot on roasted chicken and pork.  Great, spicy flavor.  The tomato sauce is okay, but unnecessary.  I mix berbere with salt and use it as a rub.
