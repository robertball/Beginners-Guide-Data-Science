A very good way to use fresh herbs from my garden.  I used walnuts instead of pine and loved the results!

Don't rinse the pasta, the starch will help the pesto stick better.

This is the best pesto recipe that we have ever had! I took another readers advice and used toasted walnuts instead of the pine nuts and we actually prefer it this way. We served the pesto over cheese tortellini. Thanks for a great recipe!

The pesto was simple to make but because it does use fresh herbs, it is very strong and pungunt.  Very 'healthy' tasting which can be good and bad. My husband and oldest don't like that taste (and I only used 1/3 of the amount!) but my youngest and I don't mind it.  I won't be making this again because of that.

Too much salt, not enough parm or evoo. Was on the dry side so to keep it lite, I added some chicken broth. I did like the herbs the recipe called for. I too used walnuts (toasted) and served over mini seashell pasta.

I only used six cups of pasta and added boiled chicken breast.  It was great!

Good flavor, easy to make, I'd recommend it as a side dish.
