This was great! Love recipes that call for ingrediants that I have or can substitute easily with what is on hand.  I had a boneless pork loin that I sliced into chops. No lemon pepper so I seasoned with Montery Chicken Seasoning. Boullon instead of stock. Used the dried cherries and berries mix I recently bought at Sam's Club. Served over rice.  Everyone liked this, even the 16-year-old male child!

I did what this recipe said with two exceptions..I added about 6T of  sugar it was just too tart for my taste. I also used "Ocean Spray Craisins...orange flavor". I made double the sauce so that I would have left overs to use on other things.  Very delish.

This had a wonderful flavor and the pork chops were very tender BUT I followed the recipe to the tee and still the sauce came out really thin.  Is there a trick to making it thicken?

Very good! I took the advice of a reader and doubled the sauce.  Unfortunately, I had to use broth since I had no stock.  It was a bit tart for me (just a personal preference) and added 2T brown sugar.  I also like my sauce a bit thicker so I used a bit of cornstarch.  Do yourself a favor and try this.  It's a great blend of flavors.  Next time, I'll make sure I have stock on hand.

Outstanding!
It's just me so I divided the recipe down and it worked perfectly for me. I didn't have chicken stock, so used beef, and just couldn't find my garlic (it was hiding in the back of the fridge) so got frustrated and used garlic powder and even that worked great. The combination of flavors is just delicious! I wanted to lick the pan!

I served a cranberry-balsamic sauce with a pork tenderloin last weekend.  I included one onion, chopped and fresh rosemary instead of thyme.  I also used canned whole berry cranberry sauce instead of the dried berries.  The sauce really complimented the pork quite well.  I may try the sauce for our Thanksgiving turkey.

I mostly eyeballed the ingredients and added them to taste, but this was a really good recipe.  Even my husband, who doesn't like meat and fruit combinations, thought the savory flavor of the vinegar and chicken broth balanced out the tartness of the cranberries.  I used jarred minced garlic to make it simpler.  I served this with couscous, and only wish I'd made more sauce to pour over it!

I gave this recipe three stars because it was a happy medium. The meat turned out really well and we all enjoyed it. However, the sauce did not work for me and I made it exactly like the recipe. The problem was that I reduced it too much I think. The combination of balsamic vinegar and cranberries was too biting and acidic.  Next time I think I would try cherries or apples in the sauce and definitely leave the sauce less reduced. I will make it again though because I think it is a solid recipe.

I gave this 3 stars for the sauce.  I will try this with pork tenderloin next time. The 20min cooking time was way too long for the pork chops. They were very dry.

mmmm yummy. I impressed my mom so much we're using the leftover sauce and barbecuing more pork chops to cut up into little pieces with gorgonzola cheese for hors d'oeuvres tomorrow. It's gonna be GOOD!

Prepared for dinner tonight. I used bone in pork chops instead of the boneless, and put in a 300 degree oven to keep warm. Served with rice pilaf, green beans and side salad .. will make again

This was really good. I did change things a tiny bit. I used fresh cranberries that I made into a sauce, a little fresh lemon,used cornstarch to thicken things.
 My husband who really doesn't like pork gobbled this up and requested that I make this more often.

Easy recipe with great flavor.  I made one change I added a little bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce after it simmered.

Improvised a bit.  Use my leftover homemade cranberry sauce instead of dried cranberries.  Also, I slivered the garlic.  Was delicious!

I did everything the instruction said. But sauce seemed not to thicken. Too watery. Perhaps next time I'll reduce the chicken stock. But it still came out good. My son liked it

I liked the flavors in this recipe, but I agree with other raters that the sauce needs to be thickened a bit. As is, the sauce just sat on the plate and missed flavoring the pork entirely. Maybe I didn't reduce it enough? But I will def make this again.

This was good. Chops were juicy and tender. I guess I expected more from the sauce. It wasn't bad, just wasn't great. I would eat it again, but probably wont be in our regular rotation.

I did not have cranberries so I did not add them. I also used broth instead of stock because that is what I had. I followed the recipe adding a touch of brown sugar.  These were very good and easy.  It is perfect for a quick supper.  There was a lot of sauce so I might half it or serve with rice to soak up some of the yumminess.  My young kids really liked this too.  Next time I will thicken the sauce a bit at the end.I will definately make this again and again.
