I've made this a couple of times now. The first time I followed the recipe and it turned out great. The second time, I found I didn't have any canned tomatos, but I had a few roma's , so I diced those up and added a little tomato sauce. It still turned out perfect. Every one at my house loves it either way. I sometimes add a little Creole seasoning for a little extra kick. This is one of those recipes that's just real hard to goof up. Thanks for posting a great recipe!

I made this without the bacon and it was really simple to prepare.  I used fresh chopped tomatoes and red pepper flakes.  It kind of reminded me of ratatouille.

Great recipe.  I used Zataran's Creole spice to give it some zing.  I also omitted the celery since we didn't have any.  I liked as well as my husband.

Delicious, healthy, and filling!  I made a few modifications: used a full green pepper; omitted the celery; for the can of tomatoes I used "Hunt's Diced Tomatoes with Green Pepper, Celery and Onion".  I mixed up my own Cajun-type seasoning: 1 Tbsp all-purpose flour, 1 tsp season-all, 3/4 tsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp pepper, and 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper.  I stirred this into the mixture in place of the "salt and pepper to taste".  This was wonderfully hearty and I will make it again.  Thanks, Gwynn!

Very easy, quick, and tasty! :)  I was a little skeptical at first, but this turned out to be a great recipe for okra.  I don't like celery so I omitted the celery and used 1 bell pepper instead.  Also, I added some garlic powder, paprika, and a small amount of cayenne pepper.  I used canola oil for sauteeing instead of bacon grease (I omitted the bacon altogether to make it more healthy).  The result was very yummy!  And we didn't have a problem with the "slime" normally associated with okra -- maybe sauteeing the okra took care of this.  I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was very good - I had to add several seasonings to make it just right, or I would have given it 5 stars.  I added fresh parsely, garlic, pepper, seasoned salt and a pinch of chili powder.  However, I will definitely be making this again.  I served it over brown rice with a fried egg, and it was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

Super!!! A+++ If I could give it more stars, I would. I didn't realize okra could taste this good w/out being deep fried. I added green chilies because we like food a little more spicy. AWESOME!!

I hate Okra, that has always been the way with me.  Hate it!  Then I started a garden and someone gave me some orgaic Okra seeds.  I planted them - I don't know why but I did and they came up beautifully.  Well this receipe changed my mind on Okra.  My husband and I loved it.  I cut them fresh from the garden and did the receipe pretty much just as it is written , except for adding some creole spice and jalepenos for heat.  It was fantastic, I can't wait to make it again.  I am so happy for two reasons, one this great receipe and two - I didn't waste space in my garden planting this Okra, now what to do with the eggplants!!

I used Canola oil instead of bacon. Sauted green pepper,onion and minced garlic. I then added frozen okra. Sprinkled with cajun seasoning. Then added Hunts petite diced tomatoes, but used 2 cans. Simmered until I liked. So good! Thank you for the sharing!

I love this recipe! 14.5 oz of tomatoes didn't seem like very much once I had the veggies chopped; luckily I had another can so I added that. I also only used 1/2 the amount of okra and it was more than enough. I recommend Del Monte brand stewed tomatoes, Cajun Recipe. It adds a nice hint of spice :) As other reviews suggested, I served this with white rice for a bigger meal. I will be making this again!

Awesome way to get a heaping of vegetables easily.  I didn't add the bacon, and I ate about 2/3 of the meal!  With whats left over, I'm going to throw the veggies on some pasta and throw a chicken breast on it.  Great recipe, easy, and super healthy!

Not bad, but pretty bland as given so it needed additional spices. I added minced garlic and cayenne and it made it a lot better. It's a nice base for a lot of possibilities.

I have never had okra other than in gumbo before buying a bunch at a farmer's market at the prompting of my 4 year old.  Used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, added 4 cloves of garlic, and some "emeril essence" spice.  It was good - would make it again, but definitely needed both the garlic and the extra spice of the essence (hence 4 stars versus 5).  Even my adventurous 4 year old ate it.

I used fresh okra, sliced, and fresh tomatoes (4 medium).  I added about 4 cloves of garlic and a touch of cayenne, and omitted the bacon because I'm vegetarian. It was fabulous! It does cook down quite a bit.

Did not have celery, used fresh okra and tomatoes, add 1/4 cup of lemon juice and sprinkles a little cormeal to soak up the little bit of slim there was.  Very Very good!  Going to try with frozen okra and frozen tomatoes next!

I fixed this dish this evening with a few modifications and everyone but the babies cleaned his plate. 

I used fresh okra, doubled the tomato, added some leftover polish sausage and a bit of crushed pepper.  We served it over flavored white rice and ate every last bite.

Very good!  I used olive oil instead of bacon and spiced it up with Creole Seasoning.  My family likes it spicy!  It was wonderful!  I would definately make it again.

I made this to use up some fresh okra. Because I was literally making one serving, I didn't want to open an entire can of tomatoes so I just used some V8 veggie juice and some Pace chunky salsa. I didn't have the green pepper so I used a finely chopped jalepeno instead. Very good!

Amazing!!! Here's how I spiced it up my own way and made it an entree. In the bacon fat (i left it all) I fried a 1/4 tsp each of caraway seed, fennel seed, and mustard seed. Before frying the onion, okra, celery and added 3 large cloves of minced garlic and a diced jalapeno. After that cooked through I added roma tomatoes that I chopped and smashed with my hands and let marinade for 30 min in the following; 1/2 tsp of fresh grated ginger, 1/2 a lime fresh squeezed plus pulp, 1/4 tsp of lemon garlic seasoning, and 1/4 teaspoon seafood seasoning like old bay.  After the tomatoes cooked and released enough water to make it soupy I added a half pound of catfish nuggets that seasoned with the same as the tomatoes; lime, lemon garlic, old bay or mccormick Chesapeake bay and a pinch of ginger. I also added the fresh grated black pepper, sea salt flakes and some ground and crushed red pepper for some heat since I like things spicy. I served it over rice and found that if you like it saltier, soy sauce was a great addition. Great with a glass of South African Pinotage.

I hate okra. I hate it less after this recipe, which is really saying something. We used fresh tomatoes from the garden (8 roma and 3 yellow heirloom) instead of canned, because we had a ton of them - and for seasoning I used a Mrs Dash spicy pepper blend. I felt like it needed a lot of salt, which must come naturally if using canned tomatoes. There was still that stringy snotty slime essence, but, this is a REALLY great way to eat okra without deep frying it. Served with a side of Andouille sausage, over rice - next time, I'll cut the sausage up and cook it in the stew. Yes, I said next time! I'm surprised, too.

Made this recipe tonight with a fresh batch of okra from the garden.  This was my first time attempting to cook okra so when it got kinda slimmy I was worried but it tastes GREAT and after you add the tomatoes, the slimmy stuff disappears.

This dish is a great way to get your veggies without adding tons of fat or calories to your diet.  I recently discovered that I like okra (I never ate it as a child), and this is definitely a dish I will make frequently because it is delicious, healthy and SO EASY to make.  This is one of the yummiest "healthy" dishes that I've made, thanks for posting it!

I gave this four stars because I had to add Cajun seasoning to spice it up...it was too bland (for my taste) without it.

I thought this was a really great okra dish.  I did add about a tablespoon of butter, though (my bacon didn't produce a whole lot of grease).  I also used a whole green pepper and NO celery.  Yum!

This is good but it needs more tomatoes and more flavor.
I used some worcestershire sauce.

One of my favorites.  My grandmother's recipe was very similar - she used okra and her own preserved tomatoes.  I mix it with rice as a side or add some chicken or shrimp for a full meal.

Simple and forgiving recipe. Like many people have said, a little seasoning brings it up a level. I added paprika, extra garlic, and cayenne pepper.  A little splash of apple cider vinegar at the end makes all the difference as well. Delicious served over rice.

Love this dish! I have made this with and without the bacon and it's great both ways. The celery really compliments the okra. I recommend fresh okra over frozen. It tastes so much better. It's in season down here right now so I have been serving this a lot lately.

This reminds me of a dish my mom makes but in my opinion better. I did do a few things different to accommodate my taste. The recipe didn't make it clear if this was what you are supposed to do but I sauteed the veggies in the bacon fat. I caramelized the onions alone first because I wanted to make sure I would not come across any under cooked onions. I also used a combination of my own stewed tomatoes to use some fresh organic tomatoes that were getting over ripe along with a can of whole tomatoes which I chopped up and added to my tomatoes. I had those simmering on the stove while I did the other steps. I also left out the bell peppers simply because I do not like them and don't keep them on hand. Oh and I also used fresh organic okra which I got at the same time as the bacon and tomatoes at a local farmers market. I think part of the reason I enjoyed this recipe was the fresh ingredients I used and the bacon was actually a smoke cured bacon so it had a flavor that really added to the dish. 
I didn't cook the celery that tender but I liked the added crunch so it didn't bother me at all. I would start with the celery and onion if you want everything soft without letting the okra get too soft. Oh one other change I made was that I chopped up the cooked bacon into little strips and sauteed with the okra, celery, and onion.
Without my changes I likely would give this recipe one less star. If you want something spicier add a pepper seasoning or a jalapeno or Serrano pepper.

Only change was to skip the stewed tomatoes for two chopped roma and a good handful of sliced grape tomatoes; and I threw in the Creole seasoning as suggested by many. I saute the onions first on their own and when they've softened I added everything else. Nice!

I had the odd situation of having fresh okra in my backyard as a biology project but never having eaten it before. I was a little wary of the classic frying recipes, so I tried this one. At first I was worried that it would turn out bland as many of the reviews mentioned adding extra spices, of which I had none. But the end product was truly delicious with just salt and pepper - as said before, you really can't screw this up!   My only suggestion is maybe to add celery first or cut it up extremely small, as my okra and bell peppers were thoroughly cooked when my celery still had a fair amount of rawness.

We enjoyed this.  I left out the celery (personal preference).  I also left out the bacon to make it healthier and just sauteed in olive oil.  And I added some cajun seasoning.  I think this would be good with shrimp or a smoked sausage.

Absolutely yummy & a great way to use frozen okra. The best thing about recipes like this is how adaptable they are. For example, if one wanted more spice, Rotel tomatoes could be used instead of stewed tomatoes. I personally don't ever have stewed tomatoes on hand & cut up a can of whole tomatoes instead. The true secret to this recipe is sauteeing the okra and veggies in the bacon drippings - delicious!

It was so easy. I had leftover sausage from another meal so I added it. Family appreciated sausage. I really think it needed more tomatoes. Have 2 cans ready next time. Served it over noodles.

I used okra and peeled, seeded tomatoes from my garden, added 1 jalapeno (we love dishes with a little heat) and doubled the recipe.  With only adding the jalapeno to the base recipe, the flavor of this recipe was outstanding.

I had fresh tomatoes, okra, and green pepper from the garden and have found a recipe that used them all!  I followed the recipe and then threw in the fresh tomatoes, nothing else.  The tomatoes were juicy enough to provide enough liquid.It was really good.

This dish was the best okra and tomatoes I have ever tasted! I thought it was really easy to make as well. The only things I did change and add was, I added a little less onion and added some more spices which include parsley and chili powder to give a little kick to it!

I've made this recipe for years with all fresh ingredients and with the frozen/canned as this recipe calls for. The only thing I add is 1-2 tsp. sugar or sugar substitute. This time I used Kroger's frozen mirepoix mix (green pepper, onion, and celery). This is an easy, delicious recipe.

Made this according to directions and it was delicious.  We make something similar by frying bacon and then sautéing onions and bell pepper.  Then I add a quart of home canned tomatoes, probably 2 T. soy sauce, 2 T. port wine and let it simmer down some.  Sometimes I add 1 t. sesame oil for a different flavor.  Always add a shake or 2 of Cajun seasoning.  Really don't have a recipe, just what you like.  Anyway, let it simmer down a bit more and take your bacon (usually about 4 slices) and crumble it on top just before serving.  Hubby and I love it.

I removed the bacon and used dried rosemary and thyme for seasoning along with salt and pepper. Very simple and tasty!

This is a great side dish that hits the spot! I made a few additions to make it a little more like my Moms. I added 1 tsp of Cajun seasoning, 1.5 tsp of sugar, 1.5 tsp onion powder, and 1 tsp of white vinegar. I served it for friends this evening and they loved it!

This is s quick, simple and tasty recipe that the whole family really likes. I'm the only one that likes spicy so I can't add spice but I add a dash of apple cider vinegar for zing and it works great.

My father made this when I was growing up, it was his mother's recipe. I continue to make it and find it goes wonderfully with fish or chicken and rice.  I use items straight from the garden and put it all in a casserole dish and bake in a hot oven until veggies tender and brown around edges.  Although bacon grease is traditional, and wonderful, olive oil works well.  Thanks for posting a great old southern recipe.

I used fresh okra and whole tomatoes in sauce because that's all I had. I added some creole seasoning as someone suggested and didn't use bacon. It was great!! Can't wait to get more okra.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I make this dish often in the summer when we have okra from the garden and I use frozen okra in the winter.
