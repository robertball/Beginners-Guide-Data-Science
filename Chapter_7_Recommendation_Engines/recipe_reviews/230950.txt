Perfect for a quick and easy lunch!  I opted to use reduced fat cream cheese and mixed in a little hot sauce for that "kick".  And I added some chopped tomato and reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese.  I basically eye-balled the ingredients and it was delicious!  Kinda like a kicked up version of a classic club sandwich wrap - perfect with a tall glass of iced tea!

I made this for a baby shower in the spring and tweaked it a little. I removed the avocado, used regular cream cheese(also couldn't find the jalapeno flavor), added half slices of tomato, thin slices of red onion and used a variety of cheese. It was a HUGE hit with everyone. And is requested at the family 4th of July get together now. :D....PS. this is even great for young kids and creates very little mess when eating. Huge Plus in a family full of kids!

I do something similar and the family loves it for a nice change of pace in the lunch box. I would like to point out that the picture does not match the recipe in that it shows cheese but there is no cheese in the recipe. We personally always add cheese(not the processed american in the photo, but some type of mozzerella, cheddar, muenster-shredded or sliced doesn't matter but we love cheese), but again all in personal preference.

These are delicious!!! Also for the meat try grilled chicken.
You just shred it into strips.

I went to two stores and couldn't find the jalapeno cream cheese so used the chive and onion.  Rolled up like a jelly roll and sliced each in 1" pieces.
