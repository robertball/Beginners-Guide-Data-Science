Grilled fish tacos are great.  I used cod loins from Costco instead of halibut.  I seasoned the fish with the olive oil, a small squirt of lime and a sprinkling of Chef Paul Prudhommes Seafood Magic.  I grilled the fish on an inside grill / panini press.   I would recommend using cilantro instead of parsley and lime instead of lemon.  I used corn tortillas because that is what I had but either flour or corn would be great.  Thanks for a delicious meal.

So Good! This would normally be a recipe we would turn our head to as we don't do mango often. Boy, am I glad we didn't!! My husband's words were "I would never in a million years ever order or make this, but wow! very good!I'd eat it again."

Some substitutes we did were as follows: 1. We used cilantro instead of parsley. 2. Did NOT add honey to salsa or Jalapenos. 3. added a dash of salt to the mango salsa 4. chose not to drizzle taco sauce onto final product. 5. I am not a big measurer so I added one whole avacado and didn't really measure the seasonings. As you can see not huge modifications, but changed to our tastes. This is definitely a keeper and a make again for sure! Thank you for an awesome dinner!

This is an awesome recipe. Delicious!! I added one turn of a sea salt grinder to the mango salsa and it likely wasn't necessary but it cut the sweetness a tiny bit. The salted fish and taco sauce would balance that as well. It was fantastic. I forgot the lettuce but it was still great.

yum! maybe a little on the sweet side; I'll probably cut back on the honey a bit but excellent complement to the fish

I had never had fish tacos before, and I was a bit nervous, but this was a pleasant surprise.  Family went back for seconds!  The sweetness of the salsa balances any heat from the jalepeno - VERY tasty!  I will definitely make these again!

Very good!! I took out the jalepenos because my family doesn't like really spicy food. But with all the sweetness from the honey & mango it needs a little kick. I plan to add cayenne pepper to the fish next time along with the salt, garlic, and pepper. I also didn't  add lettuce and we substituted it for raw coleslaw which was a nice crunch.

Delicious, even though there were no ripe Avocadoes at the store and I had to skip that part. The mango salsa was delicious with corn chips too.
