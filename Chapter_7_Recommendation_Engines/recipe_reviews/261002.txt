Love these! Substituted swerve for the sugar to make them low carb. Taste like little marzipan cookies

Forgettable. As directed, these tasted like farina cereal with cinnamon sprinkled on top. No taste of almonds whatsoever. Since I tasted some before baking it all, I tried to salvage the rest by adding almond extract. This improved the  taste somewhat, but definitely not worth making in my opinion.
