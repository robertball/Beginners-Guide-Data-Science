I added chili powder and cumin to the meat and onion mixture (and cooked the beef and onions together). I had to put mine in a 9x13 pan since my cast iron was not large enough to hold everything. Overall this was a good recipe - easy to adjust the spiciness / seasonings to your tastes. We used Jiffy cornbread mix and found the sweetness of the mixture was a little bit of an odd combination with the rest of the flavors in the dish - so I would just use one without so much sugar in the mix next time I think.

I turned this into a lower fat vegetarian meal with more kick to it.  I used 12oz of soy/veggie crumbles instead of beef (veggie crumbles is ALWAYS a better option and a heck of a lot easier to cook with), and added a 4oz. can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  This absolutely carried the dish.  Also, took me almost 45 minutes to get the cornbread to set up properly. and I didn't use any cheese on top and thought it was still great.
Everyone loved it!

I thought it looked a little bland. So here are the changes I made. I sauté onion and 2 cloves of garlic, then put one tablespoon ground cumin, chili powder and added two tablespoons chili-o. Then added 8oz can of El Pato jalapeño sauce. Then I put only 1 can of pinto beans and 1can diced tomato and the added the browned ground beef. I didn't change corn bread but I did put more cheese on top corn bread. It took longer cook time 30 minutes at 20 minutes I covered with aluminum foil. With changes I this recipe 5 stars. My husband gave it a 10.

I found it was simple enough but the result was just "okay".  Not something I would prepare when having company over.  Note: Drain tomatoes - otherwise too wet at the bottom.  On the bright side, I was able to use gluten free cornbread mix and it worked fine.  I also felt like it needed more than one cup of cheese sprinkled on top.

I made this recipe part of my regular weeknight dinner rotation because it's so easy to whip up. I cook mine in a 12 inch cast iron pan. I use turkey meat (bc I dont eat beef) I cook the turkey with the onion and add garlic, paprika, chili powder, red pepper flakes, and cumin. I just throw them all In and measure by smell. Once the turkey has browned I throw in the beans and drained tomatoes and cook on high for about 10 minutes to marry flavors and cook down the juices. Once it's done I put a thick layer of cheddar on the meat mix before I spread my cornbread. I use gluten free corn bread because of an allergy that said this works with home made corn bread too (you're basically just omitting the milk and butter and using creamed corn in their place) I top my corn bread with a little cheddar and cook. So good! And super easy. This has replaced taco night in our house because its actually easier and far less messy.

Thank You! This was just what I was looking for! Perfect for those who don't care for 'too spicy' and easy to adjust for those who do.
This is a keeper for me quick to prepare as well.

I made a few changes. Taco seasoning (recipe from this site) to the meat. Refried beans in place if pintos. Added the cheese to the meat mixture. While I was cooking the meat mixture on top the stove, I put the cornbread in the oven in a cast iron skillet  the same size as the one on stove top. This speeds things up and insures the corn bread isn't soggy on the bottom. Also, for those of you that don't care for sweet cornbread, buy or make an unsweetend cornbread mix. I served this with sour cream, shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, sliced black olive, pickled jalapeno, shredded mexican style cheese and picante sauce

I made this following the recipe but realized after I put it in the oven that it would be pretty bland. It was. I would make it again possibly but swap one can tomatoes with a can of enchilada sauce to give it more flavor.

Yes, I didn’t have creamed corn, so i used frozen corn and pureed it.  I didn’t have crushed tomatoes, so I puréed those just to the point of being similar to crushed tomatoes.  I added red, yellow and orange bell peppers to my meat mixture as well as about 2 tablespoons of McCormicks Spicy Taco seasoning.

This is an easy recipe and has great flavor.  I used 1 can of Mexican diced tomatoes with green chili’s and 1 can regular diced.  It really adds more flavor as you say.
I only had a jiffy mix for cornbread and it was 8.5oz but it worked fine.
Thank you for the recipe!!’

It was pretty bland for our taste but a good base to start with.  I made it again and replaced one can of tomatoes with a can of Rotel tomatoes.  I also added a couple of cloves of garlic to the meat.  Instead of pinto beans I used Fiesta beans in chipotle sauce.  I didn't have creamed corn so I added 2 cups of fresh corn and a container of sour cream to the cornbread mix.  I had to add a couple tbsp of milk to think it out a bit.  .  I also added chopped jalapenos to the cornbread.

I didn't have pinto beans, so I substituted refried beans, spreading a can over the top of the meat mixture before covering with the cornbread mixture. My family enjoyed this dish very much and asked to put it in our dinner plan rotation.

I did not have a large iron skillet so I only used 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes, 1 can pinto beans & 1/2 can black beans.  I also added a little chili powder.  Make sure that your filling is not too wet or will soak into cornbread.  I sprinkled a little cheese on top of filling before I added the cornbread.  After that I followed the recipe.  I loved it.  The most I ever get out of my husband is "It's OK".  This time it was "That's pretty good, do you think it will still be good for lunch tomorrow?"

I mistakenly thawed ground sausage instead of Hamburg but it tasted even better.  I also omitted the pinto beans and added diced tomatoes with green Chile's...very tasty and not too spicy

This was delicious! I used my pan from breakfast with bacon drippings in it to cook the meat and onions in. Swapped out the cream corn with frozen whole corn. Plus swapped the can tomatoes with some rotel. Threw in a little more seasonings.

Okay! I mixed the cheese into the cornbread and creamed corn... Used tomatoes with okra and corn, black beans (it's what was in the pantry)... Doubled everything... And it was perfect for a quick and hot dinner! Will add more spice, next time. Very flexible.
