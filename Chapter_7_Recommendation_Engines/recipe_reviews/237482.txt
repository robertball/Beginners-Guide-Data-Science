Thanks Monieyo, I have not tried avocado in a smoothie before. I thought it was a bit funky but I liked it! I may try adding some blueberries next time because I think it needs just a little tartness. The almond milk goes very well here. I'll try this one again!

tried to make this taste work, but not working for me.  Ice helped, perhaps some agave instead of honey, but it's too creamy.    I don't think it works

Decent smoothie! It's not very sweet but I'm trying to watch my calories anyway. I followed the recipe exactly and found it a bit thick, so I added more almond milk but it didn't really help much haha. Then I decided to add some frozen berries and that jazzed it up a little. Thank you!

I love this recipe! First time making it. I used chocolate oat milk instead of almond milk, and 1 cup of ice, and local honey.

It was okay but very bland . I loved how creamy it was though , right up there with milk shakes but was just missing something .

This is a great base recipe that you can spruce up to your liking.  I used cashew milk which is a bit sweeter than almond milk, and I put about 3 Tbs of maple syrup because I had that instead of honey on hand.  I added two pinches of cardamom seeds and a sprinkle of cinnamon to the smoothie while blending.  The cardamom really gave it some razzle dazzle.  I'm in love with this smoothie!

I added some barley green and some powdered vitamin C just for good measure. It was delicious and satisfying.

Hmmm. Not sure how to rate this smoothie. It was too savory for my taste and I even added 3 packets of Truvia. The avocado makes it very creamy. I used a frozen banana and still added ice to make it really cold. I also think this makes at least 2 servings, maybe more, especially since 1 serving is 555 calories!
