I absolutely loved this recipe and will be making it again!  So simple and easy to make.  I followed the recipe to the point. It makes so much, that my son in law said, "Don't throw away any of it. Just make something else."

I had looked and looked for a recipe that tasted like my mother’s 7-minute frosting. This was it!!  I made our family’s  Peppermint Cake and was so proud of it. My Grandmother and mother would be proud. Thanks, it is my new favorite!!

This frosting was like a marshmallow satin cloud and tasted very good!  I put the egg whites together with the corn syrup and salt in a saucepan and mixed with a mixer until the soft peaks formed using low to medium heat.  Be careful the cord for the mixer doesn't get near the burner.  Remove from heat then added 7 oz. of marshmallow cream and vanilla and continued beating on high until mixed.   Everyone loved it!

Very light texture and taste.  Best not to double, I learned the hard way.
