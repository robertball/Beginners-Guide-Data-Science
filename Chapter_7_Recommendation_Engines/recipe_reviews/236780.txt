I made half a batch of this (I was almost out of red wine vinegar), but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  I really liked this, but of course I would because it had lemon in it!  If this is too lemony or acidic for you, you could easily add a teaspoon of honey or sugar to it.  I think this would be a good spread on a sandwich as well as on a salad.  So for me, this was thumbs up!  Thanks, lukeder101!

Made it as written, tasted it and thought, it really is good but needs just a touch of something. I added a bit of lemon zest, re-tasted, and thought just a touch of sweetness was needed. I added a tablespoon of Agave nectar and now this is my favorite salad dressing! Light, tangy, and full of flavor!

This is super tart.   i just made it to dress lettuce fresh from the garden, so I don't have a whole bunch of ingredients in my salad.  I ended up adding an unknown quantity of honey to it, which I noted another poster did as well.  As I was adding the dijon, my spidey senses were telling me not to use s o much, so next time I think I will try less mustard

Just tried this tonight and if you love mustard and lemons you'll love this. It's tastes like an expensive dressing at a very expensive restaurant! My new fav! Doubled the recipe and well worth it!

7-1-2016  ~Incredibly delicious! Light, refreshing and ideal to dress the greens and enhance them rather than to take over, as some dressings do. I can’t think of anything worse in a salad dressing than to have it too acidic, too tangy – and after looking over the measurements of the ingredients, I could see this would be the case here. In order to avoid that I adjusted the oil/vinegar to the 3:1 ratio I prefer. (i.e., I added a little more olive oil).  I thank Hubs for us enjoying this as much as we did.  The oregano didn’t appeal to me and I had planned to omit it, but he encouraged me to include it.  I’m lucky to have fresh herbs in my garden right now, oregano one of them. I used three times the amount of the dried oregano called for.  It was a great addition that gave the dressing a little more character.  Adjusting the olive oil/vinegar ratio as I did elevates this to 5-stars.

Very good, but for some reason the Dijon mustard overpowered the lemon flavor. I'll try adding a bit more lemon next time or cut back on the Dijon mustard. My guy really liked it.

So good!! I used this recipe in place of the Italian dressing that was needed for Greek garbanzo bean salad recipe on this site. I loved it! Could also be used as a marinade for chicken!! Delicious!!

I used this as a dressing for a potato and asparagus salad. I substituted champagne vinegar for the red wine vinegar because I wanted a more delicate flavor. WOW this is delicious.

I am strangely addicted to this dressing.  It is tangy, but if your salad has a sweet touch, like sweet tomatoes, or perhaps beets, or fruit, it add a really nice, bright tone.  It is also super easy to make, and I think it would be delicious with Meyer lemons.  My family is not as keen on sour flavors as I am, and that makes me happy because then I don't have to share! I use the recipe exactly as written.

I didn't have red wine vinegar so I used rice vinegar, otherwise made as written.  This dressing is addictive and my family loves it!  I have since tried adding lime juice as well as lemon and I think that is my new favorite but even as written this was exactly what I was looking for!

I actually used this as a marinade for chicken and it was delicious! Perfect balance of flavors! I didn't have any Dijon, so I used a squirt of yellow and a few squirts of honey- came out GREAT! Will try as a salad dressing next, with the Dijon. Thanks for sharing, GREAT recipe!

Only change is using a tad less Dijon. This dressing is awesome and I use it as my go-to dressing. Great with romaine and butter lettuce as well as arugula and any veggies. Add some cheese (Parmesan works well) and you'll be in heaven.

It's a really good lemony dressing.  However as others mentioned, it's a tad too tangy.  I added maybe a tablespoon of honey and it was just enough to take the edge off without making it sweet.

Very good and very easy to make. The only change I made was in adding about a 1.5 tablespoons  honey to a double batch. I used the dressing on a pasta salad.

This was so good! It was fast, easy, and simple. I had all the ingredients ( I added a pinch of sugar to balance the acid), so was thrilled to make it, just because I could. Wow, this is going to become our staple base dressing for everything. I think it would be great in a pasta salad, drizzled over red potatoes, pizza, salmon, or any fish. It can be modified to add anything from capers to lemon zest. The possibilities are endless. Go on...make it!

Very nice dressing! I make a very similar version but never thought to add the oregano.  I like to add crushed red pepper flakes.  This was great over a variety of salads, but went great with a Greek salad.

Delicious!  I drizzled over heads of halved romaine, grilled and served with fresh shaved parmesan and halved grape tomatoes, additional dressing on the side.  Wonderful along side grilled chicken breast coated in the same, (with a bit of extra Dijon for kick). I did add about half a teaspoon of garlic powder in addition to the fresh, the only variance.

I added a tablespoon of sugar that took away the sour. It was very delicious. Used my milk frother to emulsive the dressing. Served with romaine, pink grapefruit wedges and diced avocado. Spiked with Cilantro....needed red onion which I did not have.

I didn't have the oregano so I used an Italian herb blend and didn't have Dijon mustard so I used regular and put a 1/2 tsp of brown sugar. This was an excellent dressing! I will be making it again!

This is one of the few vinaigrette recipes I love -am usually a creamy dressing person. It's not too tart, very balanced. Easy to make and delicious. I used it on a salad made with baby kale.

Yum! I used Italian seasoning in place of oregano. Next time I'll reduce lemon to 1 T and replace with 1 T. water because it was a little tart.

I made half a recipe but knew the amounts of lemon juice and Dijon would be way too much for my taste preference. I just cut back considerably on them, and it was very good over a spinach salad. Thanks for the recipe. UPDATE 1/17/18: This time I used white wine vinegar and garlic powder. I found it really needed sweetening, so I gave it a few tsps of honey, and it was better.

Very good and simple to put together.  I had the added bonus of using my neighbors fresh Meyer lemons.

Great recipe! Just one minor tweak: i put two egg yolks at the bottom of my food processor (a blender will work too) and added all the dry ingredients- minced garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, & dijon mustard- and blended them for 10 seconds. I mixed all wet ingredients together in a squeeze bottle with a small tip ( a measuring cup will work) and emulsified the ingredients together. It's all about pouring a little out in a small steady stream into the top of the food processor while it is running. Perfect recipe. Will last for 5 days in the refrigerator.

I feel like I missed something with this recipe based off the other reviews. As is, once I added in the olive oil, that was all I could taste. I tried to off set with more lemon/dijon and some honey. that helped off set but it still didnt have much flavor to me.

Simple. Fresh. Delicious. Made this to go on quinoa, spinach and sun dried tomato salad for the office. Everyone loved it and many asked for the recipe. I do not like to rate recipes I’ve changed but thought it might be helpful since I didn’t change much. I used lemon-infused olive oil and omitted oregano.

This was really salty, bitter and flat. I added 1.5tsp of sugar, half a small shallot and about 1.5tsp of sugar and it was much nicer. Next time I would do all honey but I was experimenting on the fly.

This is delicious! I used garlic salt to replace the salt and garlic. I also agree with the others to add a couple tablespoons of honey to cut the tartness.

I made this - turned out really good, I substituted red wine vinegar, for the white instead.. I add fresh dill, lemon thyme & cilantro from my garden.  I added a pinch of red peeper flakes. I had pink Himalayan salt instead of the kosher.

This was delicious! After reading a review about it being tart, I opted to use white balsamic vinegar which has a more mild and sweet flavor. It was perfect!

If you love lemon, this is delicious (and I do!)! I did alter a few things based on personal preference  - I double garlic (because, YUM), didn't measure the salt and pepper,  amd used avocado oil rather than olive (it's what I have), but otherwise followed along.  This will be perfect over a Buddha bowl of green rice (brown rice cooked in lots of spinach and herbs pureed with veg stock), roasted sweet potatoes, black eyes peas, and chopped tomatoes and red onion for dinner tonight!

This really is the best!  After making it as written, we prefer using half the Dijon and twice the lemon juice.  This dressing is bright and fresh, just delightfully tasty.  Now  I plan to brush shrimp with it before grilling them.

this was a nice starting point for what we used as a marinade for chicken. other than the olive oil (which we just added a splash) we added a little more of everything bc we like big bold flavors. brought the leftover marinade to a boil on the stove top and used it to baste throughout the cook. ty for the recipe.

As written, this was not right.  You need something sweet to offset this.  I used a scant 2 tblsps of honey and with that correction, this dressing was pretty good.

This recipe was good but had to adjust for me taste. Too much lemon and red wine making it extra tangy. Had to add about 3 tablespoons of honey to minimize the tangyness.

I substituted 1/4 tsp of dry mustard and herbes de provence.  I added a squeeze of lemon grass.  This vinaigrette is going on my copycat version of Applebee's Cedar Grilled Chicken (& Tilapia).

It was good, but missing something. I think next time I'll do a little less mustard and a lot more lemon

This is absolutely delicious! I emulsified mine with my Oster stick mixer especially for dressings, etc. It also keeps well in the fridge for a week or so. My 9YO likes dipping veggies in it. I was surprised that she liked it! Make sure your clove of garlic isn't a giant clove.

Added 1 tsp of sugar to balance out the tartness and also grated the zest of one lemon for added freshness.

I used 1/3 cup Apple Cider Vinegar (raw, with the "mother") instead of Red Wine Vinegar and a half lemon instead of just two tablespoons of lemon juice.  I also eyeballed the oregano, salt, and black pepper instead of measuring them out precisely.  For me, these variations gave for a bit more flavor than the original recipe.

While I like this recipe, I find it to be a bit vinegary and the oregano seemed to compete with the lemon.  On my second try, I cut the vinegar in 1/2, used basil instead of oregano and used lemon pepper. I increased the oil to 3/4 cup and after combining added lemon juice to taste. Very satisfied with the result.

I just made the second batch and find it to be perfectly light and refreshing. I added the juice of one lemon and did not measure but as with others, I love lemon so it was great. I used it on a grilled chicken salad with strawberries and mixed greens and the lemon/mustard flavors were excellent with the berries.

Didn't have dijon, so I used spicy brown mustard instead. It was phenomenal and rivaled the Zoe's kitchen orzo tabouli salad dressing. Will definitely make again!

I will never buy another store-bought vinaigrette again. This recipe is PERFECT! I didn't even need to put it in a jar and shake it - I gave it a good whisking and it emulsified perfectly. I also love that there is no added sugar. This dressing works best on baby spinach or field greens - I wouldn't use it for an iceberg or romaine. Just my opinion!

This is a nice vinaigrette but I found it to be a little too sour for my taste. I added  approximately a tablespoon of granulated sugar to it and liked the balance it created. The end product was not sweet but was not overly tangy either.

I made this to bring to a party and it was a big hit. I mythis exactly as written and yes it is tart but it's a lemon vinaigrette,  add a tad more mustard if you prefer a less tart dressing. Served it with a mixed salad green salad with quinoa, strawberries, walnuts and feta. The sweetness from the strawberries paired well with the tartness of the lemon. Delicious!

This recipe is my all time favorite. There's always a jar of it mixed up.  I use it on salad, cold veggies and as marinade for meat. Every other recipe (and all store bought bottled dressing) suffers by comparison.

Good dressing. I made a half recipe which was about twice the amount needed for 3 servings of salad. I used 1/4 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh and found it needed some sweetness so added about 2 tsp of coconut sugar.

I made this for the second time the other day.  I made as stated with the exception of quantity and type of mustard. I thought two tablespoons was a bit much for my taste, so I cut back to one tablespoon, I didn't have Dijon, so I used what I had, which was a gourmet sweet and spicy mustard.  This dressing is wonderful, and I'll definitely put it in my rotation, the smell alone is heavenly!

The dressing turned out a bit more bitter than I expected. Perhaps it was the type of olive oil I used. Next time I won't use as much olive oil; the recipe doesn't need as much as it calls for

This has become our standard house dressing but, as many others say, it is very tart and we use 3/4 to a full cup of olive oil instead of the stated half cup.  The finished product is still tart.

Tasty but strong. This wasn't as good as expected. I found it too tangy. I had to soften it with some honey. It is a serious blast of flavour though. Some might find the mustard to be  bit overpowering. I would not describe this as lemony as the amount of lemon is small compared to the vinegar.

Great recipe.  Light and fresh.  We omitted the oregano the second time and added 1 T anchovy paste to make it more like a Caesar.  Delish!

I first made it exactly has written and when I tasted it, all I could taste was olive oil.  I ended up adding more vinegar and about twice the amount of lemon juice, but now I love it! It's great on salads and I can definitely see using this as a marinade for fish or chicken.  Next time I make it I will probably halve the amount of oil, but that's purely personal taste.  Otherwise I highly recommend it! This recipe made enough for me for possibly 6 salad servings (I'm not a huge salad dressing fan, but you still get a good amount out of the recipe).

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe and added a little extra olive oil to make it go further.  I used a good quality mustard to expand the flavor.

I wanted a simple, lemon vinaigrette and this was perfect (and I don't have to suffer guilt)!  The only addition I made, as someone else suggested, was to add a tablespoon of agave for a touch of sweetness.  Perfect!

The only reason I did not give this recipe a 5 was because it was a bit too sour for me.  I added 1 tsp of sugar and it was perfect.  So I guess between a 4 and a 5 I'd give it 4 1/2 but there are no half points to give here.

I doubled mine, and it was great.  I did not have the oregano on hand, but it did not seem to take that much away from it.  I also added a pinch more garlic (I love garlic) and I thought it was perfect. I put it over the kale and shaved Brussel sprout salad mix, and it is really amazing!  My favorite new salad!

I followed the recipe exactly. This is a new favorite vinaigrette for my family. We use it in the celery Waldorf salad that we make as well as any other salad. I also have used it for a marinade for chicken that I am going to grill. We also like to dip how are veggies in it for snack. So good!

Excellent dressing as is. The lemon gives it a little fresh tart flavor so that not very much dressing is needed. Others in my family like their salad with a little more dressing. Overall, worth the effort to make.

This dressing is simple and delicious. I had all of the ingredients in my pantry so thats why I selected tis recipe.I decided to make it lower in fat by using 1/4 cup water  and 1/4 olive oil. In order to keep the full fat dressing consistancy I blended it in my bullet blender for one minute. The water substitution will not work if you try to blend the dressing by hand. I also added a pitch more salt after blending to suit my taste.

This has a wonderful lite bright taste. I used Myer lemons from my own trees, fantastic. I used a tiny bit less oil than  called for &  a little bit more garlic. Tried this with some crusty Italian bread, as well as salad, oh my goodness!

Wanted something twangy and fast. Used what I had and only changed the lemon juice to half lemon half lime, and didn't have red wine vinegar so I used white vinegar. I think it's very good!!!!

Just made this and it's great, but I added a little more lemon, without thinking it will probably become more flavorful after a few hours of melding. Oh well. I love lemon!

Really good! Used on a fresh green salad and the family loved it. Going to try it as a chicken marinade.

Made this yesterday - it was really great! I probably put in a bit more lemon than the recipe called for (but I really really like lemon). But, it still came out pretty good. I think I may have used a little less garlic than it called for. I used the minced garlic in a jar, so may have judged the conversion badly. Either way, it was well liked, and plan on making it again sometime!
