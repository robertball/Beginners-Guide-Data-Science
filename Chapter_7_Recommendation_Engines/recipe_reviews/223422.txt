I used one very large red bell pepper instead of green, lowfat mayonnaise and chopped garlic dills instead of sweet pickle relish. I wanted to make this an all-in-one salad, so I threw in two drained cans of water packed tuna. I made this last night as I wanted it to sit as long as possible to really get the flavors to come out--I'm glad I did. Nice pasta salad where all the ingredients work together perfectly. Both my husband and I really liked the honey mustard flavor a lot.

I love making this the healthy way, using whole wheat noodles. I use fat free mayo, skim milk, and don't use the egg yolks. I also up the veggies (and sometimes add diced carrots and/or apples) and up the honey mustard to 1/2 a cup when I make it low-fat, to give it a little extra zing. Using fat free mayo does change the flavor, which is why I up the honey mustard. People don't even know it's low fat when I make it this way.

This was very good and a nice change from 'regular' macaroni salad! We really enjoyed the subtle flavor of the honey mustard, and all the flavors blended well together. When I first mixed everything up w/ the dressing, I was a little disappointed that it was so liquidy, but after chilling in the fridge for a few hours, it did become less liquidy, although next time, I will add less milk (personal preference) just because I like macaroni salad a little drier. All in all, this was a great recipe and one that I will make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

We enjoyed this and so did our company, the leftovers the second day were even better. I eyeballed the veggie additions and more than likely added in more, we like extra veggies. Also only had dill relish, we're not big fans of sweet relish. I added the milk in just until it reached the consistency we like, I only used a 1/2 cup total. Our company loved it, and they are pretty picky. Thanks Brandilynn for a great tasting mac salad.

My whole family loved this recipe!  Succulent flavor! I used bowtie pasta because I didn't have any elbow pasta on hand.  The salad was pretty with it, and because the pasta texture was softer, it worked well.  I only put in 1/2 of the milk; do that too, and add more later if you need to, or else you might find the salad too watery.  I made my own honey mustard by combining 1/3 mayo, 1/3 honey, and 1/3 brown mustard (like Grey Poupon)--just eyeball it in the 1/3 measuring cup if you are making the full 12 serving recipe.  That means you will need to add more mayo because the recipe calls for it as well.  My husband said I should have added more peas, but I told him there weren't any in it (we realized that he thought the green pepper was peas--haha).  So I added some peas (frozen and thawed) to the leftovers and it was even better!  I think salad shrimp would also be a nice addition, and then the salad (maybe with bread) could be a meal on it's own.

Delicious - love the extra flavor added by the honey mustard -- I used Dijon and honey.  My only recommendation is that you make it at least a few hours in advance to give the onion and bell pepper time to meld flavors.  I ate some right after putting it together -- it was very good, and then 5 hours later at the party -- it was even better.
  Will definitely make again -- maybe add some chicken or ham for a main course?

Great twist on classic macaroni!  The hint of honey mustard is just right...present but not overpowering.  New family picnic favorite!

The healthier version that another reviewer posted turned out fantastic! The sweet from the relish and the honey mustard makes this version better than all the other macaroni salads I have had. I am keeping this recipe for future use.

Yummy! I just made a double batch of this for a family reunion and it was a HUGE hit. I had people asking what my secret ingredient was (honey mustard puts this macaroni salad above all the rest.) I sent this recipe out to a bunch of family and friends after our reunion. Thanks so much for posting it!

This, as written, was an excellent flavored salad.  Especially if allowed to rest 5-7 hours before serving to meld the favors.  I gave it 5 stars for flavor, after I did my 1st try of it.  HOWEVER, it REALLY needs some color!  So, 1st thing I did next try, was switch out to the multi colored noodles (fusilli I think?).  They have ridges witch "catch" the sauce which adds even more flavor to the fun!  Then, red onion instead of yellow or white.  The celery takes care of the green, so I chop a red bell pepper & a yellow.  Getting the picture now?  I try to do a little homework on sweet or dill preferences, then, rather than just use relish, I cut or chop a few pickles so they show up a little better. Then, if I want, I'll dust with paprika, or fresh parsley.  A "little" more work, but it makes  a very pretty dish, and barely effects the flavor.  Too, if I want to make it into a "main" dish, I get the small shrimp from Whole Foods and mix them in...yet another color & texture.

Made this for a Super-Bowl Party. Raves from everyone! It was awesome! The only thing I did different was a half cup of milk instead of a whole cup. I figured I could always add but I couldn't take it back! ;-) Highly recommend this salad!

This was a big hit at our Father's Day get together.  I had never made macaroni salad before, but it turned out great.  Made it just a few hours before, so it tasted very fresh.  I think if I had to make it in advance I would not put the noodles in the mix until just before taking it to the event.  The noodles start sucking up the moisture in the salad right away.  I hate bloated noodles, so I will make sure I remember that in the future.  Had several comments by macaroni salad lovers that it was the best they have had.  It is not my taste if food, but it was requested by the hostess, and was received well by all who ate it.

This is delicious. I am a macaroni salad fiend, I love it and can and have had it and only it for dinner. I did do a few things differently to suit our tastes. I swapped out the milk for sour cream and used 1/2 cup, used a red bell pepper instead of green, 1/4 cup of chopped chives and 2 tbs of cider vinegar, I love tangy vinegary things and the honey mustard with the vinegar gives it a nice sweet and sour taste.

1/2'd the recipe for family of 4. Omitted milk all together since others said it was too soupy for them. The only ingredient I didn't half was the honey mustard and kept at 1/3 cup for the extra flavor and sauce. Decided I'd add milk if needed and it was just right without any.  I used half light mayo and half plain greek yogurt to cut calories.  EXCELLENT!!! I can't wait to bring to picnics.

The sweetness and the tang from the added honey mustard gave this salad an awesome flavor. I made it with light mayo and it was great.

This wasn't bad, but not stand up either.  I reduced milk to 1/2 cup per other reviews and found that I needed to add another 1/2 cup after it sat for a few hours.  Personally, I would also prefer without the egg.  I also added a bit more veggies than called for, with some red onion added to the mix, very finely diced to add flavour and crunch.

I halved the recipe and the amount of dressing did seem like a lot but after two hours the dressing had been totally absorbed and the salad was dry.  I added more mayo, honey mustard and relish before dinner.  I don't know that I'm blown away by this salad but it is a nice change.  I think it could use some tweeking but I'm not sure where to go with it.

This is the best yet. The only thing I changed was the green pepper, I used Red, the family don't like the green, and neither do I. I kept every thing the same. We all loved it.

I've made this twice now for a family barbeque - it was a huge hit and when leftovers were taken home, I was told that it was even better the next day!  Great recipe and so easy to throw together!

My family loves this recipe! I give this 4 stars only because as is, it would be sopping wet. Thankfully, since the liquid ingredients looked to be a lot, I cut those ingredients in half, and still didn't need all of it to coat the dish. I don't really even care for sweet relish, but all the flavors together are really fantastic!

This was as good as "Old Fashioned" macaroni salad.  I did everything by the recipe except the eggs.  Just wanted to mention that the milk makes the dressing very creamy but it takes about an hour for it to set up.  We did eat it right away and it was delicious, but was a little runny.  In 1 hour it was absorbed, rich and creamy!!!

Loved this mac salad! Left out the green pepper and chopped up sweet pickles instead for using relish. My husband and I agreed that the only thing that was missing was a little acid. Next time I'm going to add a splash of cider vinegar or white wine vinegar.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I used a cut up dill pickle instead of the relish as this was what I had on hand.  I will make this again!

I made this exactly as the recipe states. I was a little skeptical of the flavorings at first but this was outstanding.  My husband, son and wife and 2 grandkids loved it.  Only had a small container left when it was all done.

I added more onion, more relish, and forgot the eggs.  It made a lot, I shared with my neighbor, and used the eggs when had the leftovers.

I added probably too much salt and paprika, and used onion powder instead of onions, but it still ended out really good! Thank you

Prep was the longest part of the process. Had a few comments about salad being bland even after adding a teaspoon of Old Bay instead of the sea salt, added less milk than recipe called for. Did not want to over spice, guest list was very young to seniors, Bottom line, I liked it and the pan disappeared despite the bland comments. Star count should be 4 1/2 instead of a 4.

So good! And so flexible in terms of additions, substitutions and changes. I didn’t have elbow noodles or green peppers, so I used bow ties and a jar of roasted red/yellow peppers. I also didn’t have prepared honey mustard, so I made some using a combo of Dijon and yellow. Since I wanted to serve it as a main dish, I added deli turkey and crumbled bacon. It was such a hit that even my daughter liked it, and she never cared for macaroni salad before. Definitely a keeper for the recipe box, especially since it’s easy to make with things you’re likely to have on hand.

This is my "go to" recipe for pasta salad. The honey mustard gives it a surprising and delicious twist. I add a few strips of chopped crisp bacon or cubed ham when I'm looking for a main dish salad. Otherwise, don't change a thing--it's perfect!

This is my 2nd time making this recipe. 1st time I made 1/2 recipe and it turned out so well I made it again for a BBQ ending with empty bowl! First, don't skimp on the honey mustard or the pickle relish or you risk missing lots of flavor. You can go crazy adding any veggies that sound good, ( a friend added frozen peas) it is that forgiving as long as you have the dressing which I made as written. I added shredded carrot, colored peppers, shallot and finely diced ham. If the dressing remains the same you can't go wrong but the more veggies added, the more dressing you'll need.

This was a really good salad. But made some changes.  Added roasted red pepper instead of green.  Added olives and grated carrot. Salad was a little dry after cooling, so added ranch dressing to add a little more moisture to salads.   Good basic salad.

Nice change from ordinary macaroni salad. I prefer a little sweeter salad, and this fit the bill. I just left out the egg, since it's Easter weekend, and I'll have my share later. It's delicious now, but I know it will get better as it stands. I can also see adding other things to it, like shredded cheddar cheese, as a reviewer mentioned, or cucumber or radishes. Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely a great recipe! I doubled the dressing mixture but didn't use the milk because I prefer my pasta salad thick and creamy, I also used a red bell pepper to contrast with the celery and relish. Not only does it look beautiful, it tastes awesome! It kind of has a taste reminiscent of deviled eggs, which is just fine with me since I love deviled eggs!

I have made this recipe a few times and I really enjoy it.  My most recent batch was by far the best and it was completely because I bought a bottle of Woeber's Simply Supreme Honey Mustard.  What a huge difference it made.  Any recipe is only as good as the ingredients it is prepared with.  This is one of my favorite "summer time" salads but I will make it all year long.

This is Friday August 21, 2015. I was looking for a macaroni salad. I used the Honey Mustard Macaroni Salad. It is so awesome I just had to write a review. I don't care for green peppers so I added carrots for color & I always put shredded cheese in my salad. This will be my new go to Macaroni salad from now on. Thank You to who ever posted this one.

Very, very good. I made just as is, no change at all. The honey mustard flavor much contributed to a success of this recipe in my opinion. I also liked that this recipe doesn't require sugar at all. If you are looking for a very good macaroni salad with no sugar added, this is a go-to recipe!

So delicious! I put my own little twist on it too. I eliminated the onions and celery (because I don't like either) and replaced it with tuna and organic sweet corn. I'm allergic to cow's milk, so I replaced that with  flax milk. And I used honey mustard instead of regular mustard. It's a full meal deal and my boyfriend loved it too!

Awesome recipe!!!!!  A huge hit at gatherings and everyone asks for it for breakfast the next day!  I too followed a suggestion from other members and only used 1/2 cup of milk , added some chopped up garlic dills and used dehydrated minced onion instead of fresh...loved it!!!

Perfect recipe! Don't be afraid to add the milk. It will look watery at first, but as it sits in the fridge it will soak up all the dressing. Great tasting basic recipe. It makes a boatload, so for a healthy eating family of 4-5, half the recipe :) I myself left out the bell pepper and didn't miss it at all. Also, instead of honey mustard (since I didn't have any on hand), I made my own by adding a tablespoon of honey to regular old yellow mustard.

Pretty good.  I think I liked this more than the rest of the family though so, for that reason, I'm not likely to make this again.

Absolutely wonderful side dish for the summer, it's been a hit with everyone who's had it - myself included and that's saying something since I'm not particularly a fan of macaroni salad in the first place!

A nice change from the macaroni salad that we usually have.  Other than changing the type of pasta, I made this as written.  The dressing is very thick and I did need to thin it down, just a tad.  The honey-mustard gave the dressing a nice flavor.  The salad paired nicely with 'Whiskey Hamburgers' from AR and fresh veggies.

Made this exactly as written, except, I added olives and bacon...but everything else was the same. My husband, who isn't a big fan of macaroni salad, went back for seconds, and he wants it again for dinner tonight. The flavors meshed together beautifully and the consistency was perfect. I let it sit for about 3 hours before serving. All my other macaroni salad recipes got thrown out. This will be my only macaroni salad from now on. -Diane C.

Made this for my family get together is weekend.  My family loves a little spice in their food.  So I added Big Rick's Jalapeño Honey mustard that I found.  It was AMAZiNG.  Just enough kick to an awesome macaroni salad. Will definitely make again and again.

This was fantastic! A little runny might not add so much milk next time or try it without. I don't care for celery so I added celery salt.
Brought some to my neighbor and he loved it! Will definitely make tis again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was great- mine came out a tiny bit soupy, but seemed to thicken after a day in the fridge, I am going to omit some of the milk next time.  I used dill pickle and it worked well.  I really thing the honey mustard is the key to making this one great!

While the sauce was a little too "soupy" for me, I discovered it was decent if you'd leave it in the refrigerator for at least 5-6 hours.  I prefer a sweeter salad so I think next time I will add some Bread and Butter pickle chunks- I wasn't as big of a fan of the underlying bitter mustard taste but my family enjoyed it and it was easy to make.  Best advice?  Taste the dressing BEFORE you put it on the macaroni, fix to your taste and then leave plenty of time for refrigeration.

Turned out great. I made a few tweaks of my own since I didn't have all the right ingredients. I used bread n butter pickles I canned last year since I didn't have any sweet relish and I made my own honey mustard. I will be making this again!

This was delicious! I left out the eggs, only because I never have luck with peeling boiled eggs. The honey mustard, relish combo really makes this Mac salad stand out from all the others I've tried! This is now my go-to Mac salad recipe!

Made this just as written except used red pepper instead of green, it's what I had on hand and omitted the celery, only because I didn't have any. Will add that next time I make this. Best macaroni salad I have ever  made! It thickens up a lot after sitting in the fridge for a few hours to just the right consistency. My husband loved it too. Can't wait until summer to bring it to our next gathering!!

My family loved this. The only real change I made was to add shredded cheddar cheese to it(cheese makes everything better in my book). I used whole grain spiral pasta,low cal dressing/mayo, 1% milk, and egg whites only to make it a little more healthy. I am thinking about adding grilled chicken next time to make it a meal.

This is the best macaroni salad. It is fantastic.  I made it as the recipe called, except onion. It seems pretty wet, but by the time the macroni absorbs the mosture it is perfect even several days later.

Thank you for this recipe, even the pickiest eaters in our family loved it. I made a double batch for a family gathering (didn't double the milk) and it was loved by all even those who say they normally don't like homemade.
