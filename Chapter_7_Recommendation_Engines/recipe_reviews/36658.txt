Very tasty and different.  Guests were impressed (always good!).  Up the curry and cook the couscous in the broth (v water).  Thanks!

Overall, it's pretty good.  I only put in one apple (needed more!), omitted the banana (allergy), and added a handful of raisins.  Next time, I'll cook the couscous in the broth, add more apples, raisins and curry powder, and maybe a little bit of allspice and cloves.  All-in-all, a good side-dish.

Excellent.  I needed to add a little more Chicken stock and/or wine for the couscous.  Tasted great.  I used a strong curry powder, so next time I will back off a little on the curry.  Will definitely make it again.  I used it as a meal in itself

I only used one apple, unpeeled, but everything else the same.  This was very tasty!  I think the chicken broth really helps balance out the sweetness.  It was a nice accompaniment to my baked rainbow trout...

This was a great,unusual recipe.I am always looking for something new to give my husband in his work lunch.I didn't have all the ingredients on hand in the correct quantities but the recipe is very forgiving ! I added raisins at the end and next time will add some cashews or peanuts.Fabulous cold the next day.
