I've made at least a dozen types of keto/fathead breads which all have slightly different variations of ingredients. The flavor of these is delicious! The execution, however, is problematic, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I tried 1 bun using the stated method (cutting in half BEFORE baking) - the two halves turned out like small "cookies" and were very small and thin, about 3" in diameter, about slider bun size but thinner. It was also difficult to keep the dough from becoming misshapen when cutting it raw.  I baked the next three buns without cutting them in half first. I rolled the dough into a ball, flattened it to about 3/4" thickness and baked for 12 mins. Not only did these produce bigger buns, it was much easier to slice them in half after they had baked and cooled. Another issue: 425F was too hot (at least in my oven), so I lowered it to 400F and they came out perfectly browned.  I made my first one into a turkey sandwich - DELICIOUS!  These would also make great breakfast sandwiches with egg and sausage rounds, or shaped into biscuits.  They definitely have an eggy texture, but if you are used to fathead breads, you will love these!

This was awesome. Did as the other review suggested and sliced after baking-worked perfectly. Even my bread-loving husband who suffers through taste-testing my Keto recipes loved it. Thank you for the recipe!

I love this bread so much! I have been making it with different cheeses and adding things like bacon, onion, garlic... I made it into bagels. Love it!
I also mixed Italian seasoning into the flour.  Rolled it out. Baked for 10 minutes at 375°. I then put garlic butter instead of sauce. Topped with chicken, broccoli, mushrooms and mozzarella cheese. Baked it for another 5 minutes untill the cheese was melted. Turned out great! The family loved it!

We loved the flavor and texture, but were a bit disappointed in the size of the rolls created. We'll make double batches in future (at least!). Definitely a favorite, though!

Made as directed, but planned to cut the buns after baking at 400.  They were just right - no cutting, so I had 2 tops and 2 bottoms and 4 burger patties!  LOL. Will double the recipe next time, but it was delicious.  We haven't had bread for about 5 months and this was a super treat!

Thanks for the recipe!

Doesn’t taste eggy! Good texture. I made two large buns with the intent to slice them after baking, but they thinned out quite a bit, so I instead I just broke them in half to make tops/bottoms for two sandwiches.
