I'm not gonna give this a rating just yet beacuse I used spring roll wrappers instead of egg roll wrappers. When I went to the store to buy the egg roll wrappers they were out so I figured the spring roll ones would be just as good. WRONG!!! Trust me it was so incredibly greasey we couldn't eat them and had to toss them out. I do plan to try these again but using the egg roll wrappers. I just wanted everyone to learn from my mistake.

Wow, these are GOOD! Was hesitant to fry them (was thinking about baking), but am so glad I did. My only changes were that I used fresh button mushrooms, finely chopped and sauteed in pan coated with butter-flavored cooking spray; sauteed them with the chopped garlic and a little kosher salt. And, just because I thought they would be easier to eat that way, I diced the pepperoni instead of cutting them into strips. I almost always keep string cheese in the snack drawer, and now I'll have to add egg roll wrappers to the list of staples because these were delicious, fun and easy; plus, they're a great jumping-off point for more embellished variations. Already thinking about stuffing an egg roll wrapper w/ a quarter of a banana, a few caramel chews, a handful of salted roasted nuts and few semi-sweet chocolate chips - Doesn't that sound incredible? :)

I grew up eating these little treasures.  We called them Pizza Fingers.  I made them for my son's birthday party and there wasn't even one left.  The little changes I made were just that I used only pizza sauce, pre-sliced pizza pepperoni and a small stick of mozza cheese.  That's all that were in them when I used to get them back home.  I will make this again and again and again forever!  Thank you for sharing this.

I made these as a special treat for my Hubby. If you are not watching your weight they are AWESOME! I tried using half a cheese stick per roll at first to make it a lil healthier but they were not even half as good as the whole stick set. My son and Hubby ate them all and then asked when I'd make them again.

Neat idea. These were really good. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because the instructions did not state that in order to keep the cheese from oozing out is to cut the cheese in HALF, then roll up and pinch the ends. This is not going to be very pleasant on the eyes if your cheese is falling out both sides of the won ton wrappers. I also did this with ham and cheese. That was also delicious. I personally liked the ham and cheese combo a bit better.

I stuffed mine with bellpeppers, onions and mushrooms, diced pepperoni slices, 1 string cheese, and 1tsp of pizza sauce. Then I brushed them with olive oil and baked them at 400F for 15/20mins. They were great. My pizza-loving hubby loved these.

My 5 and 2 year old went nuts over these! I added sausage and green bell pepper only because it was easy to slip in unnoticed with the cheese. I will definitately make these again for a home-from-school treat. Thanks!

I made these for a wedding shower, and they were gone in 15 minutes!  I cut the string cheese in half to double the recipe and cut down on the serving sizes.  I forgot to add the garlic; but I don't think anyone minded.

I like to make these as special treats.  I slice green pepper, add mushroom, and pepperoni works really good.  Sometimes add a sprinkle of Italian Seasoning.  Watch the frying don't fry to long.

These were good.  I used 8 slices of pepperoni on each one and a sprinkle of italian seasoning.  Had to leave out the veggies for the kids sake, dipped in marinara sauce.

I can't believe I found this recipe.  When we lived in NY they were called pizza fingers and we were able to buy them at the corner bar.  Since we moved to Florida we haven't been able to find them.

Now, I can MAKE them anytime, they are sooo yummy!

I didn't have egg roll wrappers so I used phyllo dough instead and it didn't taste all that great.  I will say that in my case they tasted better fried than baked.

Delicious! As some other previous reviewers, I used phyllo dough (sprayed with cooking spray) and baked in the oven. I also sauteed fresh baby bella mushrooms and used 1/4 stick of fresh string cheese in each roll. Served with warm Trader Joe's marinara. A big hit at a football party!

These are awesome! Very filling! If you use fresh mushrooms, you may want to cook them first otherwise they'll poke thru the egg roll wrapper while wrapping.

These were amazing!  I simply spread a small amount of pizza sauce on the wrapper then placed the cheese stick on top.  Rolled them up and fried.  Who knew a pizza roll could be so simple.  They were easy to make and ready in no time.  Great snack.

Awesome.  I did change it a wee bit though.  I put some pizza sauce in the wrapper and just used pepperoni and a bit of cheese string (kids won't eat mushrooms).  Turned out great.  I used pre-sliced pepperoni mini's and they were a perfect size.  Will definitely make these again.

I just made these for a quick lunch due to we have been doing yard work today.Anyway...Very quick & my kids helped assemble them,I did the frying.We used turkey pepperoni,leftover sauce i had from dinner last night.While these were yummy we all agreed next time we will just use shredded cheese because the cheese sticks seem to be a bit to much cheese for us and not enough of the pizza taste we we are looking for.Great idea and easy for the kids to pitch in and help out & they are yummy as is yet easy enough to change to your family tatste.We all agreed we will be trying these again and we would like to make a taco version.Thanks so much :)

We made these today as a late lunch/snack hold over til dinner. Just used Sargento string cheese and lumpia wrappers, they browned very nice and were simple to make. Dipped in canned Hunts pizza sauce. Will make again, and vary ingredients for different tastes. but overall very good.

I tried the recipe using the pastry dough and thought it was too much dough. I only used the cheese sticks and mini pepperoni. The taste was good but too heavy for my liking.  I made these previously and used wonton wraps which was an excellent alternative and an easy grab appetizer. Bake at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, ovens vary.

So disappointed by the instructions for frying these. I got my oil up to about 140F and it started smoking, so I thought, screw the 365F instruction! I had them in for less than 5 minutes, both sides combined, and they almost burnt!  I'm not a novice cooker by any means, but if I burnt these then there's definitely something wrong with your instructions! I suggest revising ASAP so no one else bombs what should be amazing!

I made these last night and they were great.  My husband loved them and I will definitely be making these again.  I used mozzarella shredded cheese and pizza sauce.  My husband wants me to make more this weekend with different fillings.  These are definitely worth making and very easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family loved these. I used the mozzarella string cheese and pepperoni minis and a little garlic powder on each one before rolling them up. Be sure you are using egg roll wraps. Some reviewers said they had to cut their cheese in half. They are using won ton wraps which are smaller than egg roll wraps

I figured fried cheese HAD to be good, but I found the garlic and spices of the peperoni were overwhelming, and the cheese oozed out of the fried egg roll dough making them look unappealing.  Two of my kids didn't like them, and one picked the cheese out and ate only that.  I didn't use mushrooms, so maybe that was what ruined the flavor.  In any case, this recipe was not for us.

Really great idea. Made them for a birthday party and most liked them.  I think I fried them at too high of a temperature so the cheese was still stiff and not as oozy as I thought it should be.  Will make them again and try block cheese next time and put tons of veggies in them that I prefer.

Very easy, pretty good. Only thing I didn't like was frying it, maybe next time I'll try the phyllo sheets.
