This is an easy and quick recipe.  My kids love it.  Also, for those questioning where the almonds are, "Almond Bark" is the common name for white-chocolate baking and candy making squares that come in 1 pound bulk packages to melt for dipping and candy making.  The editors of this site chose to list this ingredient as "white confectioners coating", something people who use this ingredient would probably never actually call it.

Just a question - How can these be Almond Bark Cookies when there are no almonds in it? Most things with almond bark generally have chocolate in them....Kady

I made these cookies for a Christmas Basket and as part of a Cookie Exchange at church. They were a HUGE HIT! Everyone loved them. These are a definite keeper. I didn't have any trouble with the candy coating at all.

I've been on a total peanut butter kick lately and these really hit the spot. I didn't have pecans so I threw in some pretzels that I had crunched up. I think the little bit of salt on the pretzels REALLY made it yummy. TRY THESE!

Never use colored marshmellows in this.  They'll look yucky.  My mother-in-law gave me this recipe years ago and didn't know the name so we call it Mat's favorite cookies at our house (after my husband).  These are a holdiay staple at our house at Christmas.  I have taken them to several cookie exchanges and get rave reviews!  If you make your drops small, you can get lots of cookies out of this.  I double and sometimes triple the recipe.  My family is digging in my fridge or freezer to find these cookies!  Also, you can substitute cashews for the peanuts.

I thought this recipe was excellant, but I did not use the peanuts.  I have already made it several times, and have tried a few twists like using mini hershey kisses instead of white chocolate.  I even left out the peanut butter in a few batches and used cinnimon or butterscotch chips.  It was a big hit..

Very good and VERY easy to make.  I used the colored marshmellows....shouldn't have done that since those marshmellows had fruit flavoring ...so the cookies tasted a bit weird.  They would have been alot better if I would have just used the regular marshmellows.

I call this candy, and it is the best!  I have made this recipe many times and everyone loves it but I call it "Peanut Butter Elf Bites".  It makes a lot of candy but it won't last long.

Very good.  I used colored marshmallows.  Next time I will use more marshmallows.  Too much candy coating in this recipe.  Fun for the kids and the holidays.  What is the problem with using almond bark in the recipe?  candy confection??

These are pretty good - I followed the suggestion of somebody on here and chopped the nuts.  I also added ~2 Cups raisins.  I topped with a couple Christmas M&M's for color.  The recipe makes a ton!  I first used my larger Pampered Chef scoop and they were a little too big.  The small scoop was perfect.  (With one tray using the large scoop, I still got 106 "cookies" out of this recipe)

One word - yummy!   I saved this in my "candy" file as I think it's more like candy then a cookie.  I added a handful of chocolate and peanut butter chips to the mixture for a chocolatey flavor, I also chopped the peanuts for a finer texture.  Any recipe that produces a large quantity of candy quickly and with little effort using items you probably have in your pantry already is a winner in my book!

I really like these.  The sweet/salty taste is awesome with the texture difference as well.  They are super simple and easily can be halved.

I made these for Christmas and they turned out really well and taste great. I only used half the amount of peanuts to try to reduce the calories!  I put them in the porch to cool off because no room in the fridge. Also I decorated with the red cinnamon candies.

I made these with regular chocolate chips instead of white confectioner's coating.  They were very easy to make, but I personally think they turned out too sweet.  I may make them again, but I think I will add more peanut butter.

These are surprisingly delicious and easy.  I actually used white chocolate chips, which melted very easily in the microwave.  I also added about a half a cup of shredded coconut and an extra half cup of marshmallows.  Next time I'd like to try this with milk chocolate chips!

This was quick and easy and I liked it but it was just a little too sweet.  It gets its name from the brand of white chocolate, "Almond Bark".  It isn't supposed to have almonds.

I made these recently with both white and brown chocolate bark because I still had both on hand after Christmas.  I know how this bark sticks and I had to make 50 for a church function, so I put about 3 tablespoons in Valentine muffin papers.  These are very rich and yummy--I made them larger because they were being served as a dessert, instead of how chocolate pretzels or almond bark are usually made in smaller bites where people keep eating more and more.  These are delicious and actually much faster to make than chocolate pretzels because this all stirs together and then can be spooned out onto wax paper or into a muffin paper.  Another 8 thumbs up from our family!

I always make this at Christmas.  Can use most firm cereals (cheerios, kix, etc.)but would stay away from the sweetened ones.  My family prefers chow mein noodles in place of the cereal.

Excellent for "cookie swaps"...I add mixed nuts (instead of just peanuts) with 2 pound of white chocolate, I like the sweet/salty combination.

These are wonderful!  Turned out way better than expected.  Everyone that tried them loved them, even hubby who doesn't like sweets.  I wasn't sure about the peanuts, but added them anyway, and I am sure glad that I did.  Wouldn't be the same without them.

I didn’t have time to drop the cookies I put them in a 9 x 13 pan lightly greased chilled them then dumped pan upside down and cut into bars it worked well had a little bit of crumbs left over but they are great on vanilla ice cream

I used captain crunch cereal instead and left out peanuts.  Was a hit with friends.

I have made this for years and is 5-stars as is.  It is, however, easy to tweak according to taste.  I don't like marshmallows so put in more peanuts.  Kids don't like peanuts, so I divide the batter in half and drop the peanuts but add more krispies.  If this is too sweet for you, just add more of the other ingredients.  Sometimes I split the batter and add 1/4 c cocoa.  It truly is flexible.  Stores very well at room temperature.

This recipe is no more or less than its ingredients.  Perfect for an air conditioning day and ease of creating.  It didn't knock my socks off but it was a tasty treat.
