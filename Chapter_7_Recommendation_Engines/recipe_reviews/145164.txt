Another good broccoli salad.  I made up the dressing in the morning so that it had a chance to meld all day before adding to the salad portion of the recipe.  The only change I made was to use craisins instead of raisins as that is what I had on hand.  This held up well as leftovers for lunch the next 2 days.  Good leftovers are always appreicated in this house.

This is delicious with stevia!  I modified another reviewers advice to use 10 small packets of stevia by only using 8 packets. The level of sweetness was still too strong for my tastes so I will try 5 or 6 packets next time. I also adding grated carrot, and my family loved it.

Love it!  I made this out of a whim.  No raisins as I do not care for them.

I used ten (10) small packets of Sweet Leaf STEVIA instead and 1/2 bottle of Hormel "Natural Bacon Pieces". Taste Great! That's PROMISE :)

OMG, this salad was so delicious! I used bacon bits instead of bacon. It was better than the store bought at Albertson's

Very Delicious! I omited the almonds and used 6 packets of splenda because that's what I had. I also added 1 cup of shredded mozzarella. Definitly will be making again-over and over.

Made this for a family gathering and it was a hit!  Definately best if left to sit in the fridge a couple hours before serving.

I used half of a very small red onion, cut the Splenda back to a scant quarter cup and added a little fresh ground pepper. Tasty broccoli salad though even though I cut back on the Splenda, it was still quite sweet. Next time, I'll cut it back even more.

I made this recipe for the first time for a potluck.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins, blanched and slivered almonds instead of sliced, white vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, and real bacon bits instead of cooking my own bacon.  I loved it and I'm not normally a huge fan of broccoli. It has a really nice crunch. The bacon adds a salty flavor where the cranberries and the dressing are a little sweet.  Nice mixture of flavors and pretty to look at!  I will definitely make it again.  Leftovers taste great 2 days later.

My sister got me hooked on this broccoli salad many years ago. It was her "signature" dish which was enthusiastically received at every family get- together. I reduce the bacon to 4 strips, omit the almonds, use apple cider vinegar and add dried cranberries instead of raisins. As others have commented, this dish tastes best after a few hours of refrigeration and a couple of stirs. I also like to add the bacon just before serving so it doesn't get soggy. YUM!

I thought this recipe was VERY easy and VERY good. But when I went to look for my raisins, they were "gone". So, I substituted dried Craisins (dried cranberries). The only bacon I had was frozen so I used real bacon bits. I forgot to mention I used "light" mayonnaise to lessen the fat.  It was yummy. I received numerous compliments from my hubby. So I guess I will make this one again!

This is my favorite brocoli salad of all time. However, I improved the original recipe by using peameal bacon instead of regular bacon and used about a quarter cup of regular white sugar.  This is magnificent and loved by all who have tried it.

I made a couple personal preference changes.  I don't like  raw onions so I left them out.  I used dried cranberries and  just a few Splenda packets.  I also don't cook bacon (ewe) so I used half a bottle of Hormel real bacon bits.  I have made it several times.  I love the combinations of flavors and textures.

I cut the broccoli small. Use half a cup of mayo. Can use pine nuts instead of the almonds. Delicious!

Fantastic recipe! I will not eat anything that tastes like it has mayo in it..so I was skeptical when I saw that this recipe called for one whole cup of the stuff. To my surprise the dressing tasted nothing like mayo. Also, I only added about a half cup of raisins and switched out the original for the golden. This recipe is definetely a keeper!

I made this salad as a side with my pot roast last night. The family could not get enough. Wonderful flavor. One change only, I used a 1/4 cup of sugar in stead of SPLENDA. Definitely a keeper.

I was skeptical, I won't lie, but this really is tasty. I used 3/4 c of Miracle Whip in place of mayonnaise because that's what I had in the fridge, and 6 tbsp of regular sugar since we don't use sugar alternatives. Other than that I kept the recipe the same and it's great. I don't like overly creamy foods, so not having the full cup didn't upset me at all. I'll be making this again.

A favorite for sure, made it 4 times since May. Just minor modifications made it work really well for me. I really cut up the broccoli, small 'heads' not large ones. Added 1/2c of shredded sharp cheddar but not finely shredded, otherwise it just globs up. I used 'fake bacon' by Morningstar. Omitted raisins, added honey roasted sunflower seeds as a topping, not mixed in. I used very little onion being after sitting the taste and smell can take over pretty quick. Good same day, but great 2nd day

This is an awesome basic recipe for broc salad. For some reason the Splenda tastes better than regular sugar. No idea why, but it really does.

My own personal touch: I use a little less bacon. I don't use raisins or nuts, so I throw in some sort of cubed cheese (Swiss or cheddar work well) and grated carrot. You can also use either red wine or red wine vinegar if you want something with a stronger flavor than white vinegar. Cider vinegar REALLY doesn't go well with this recipe.
