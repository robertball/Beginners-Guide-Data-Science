Loved this recipe! The chicken was tender and moist inside with a crisp crumb coating (I used Panko crumbs) and it paired greatly with the roasted red peppers and asiago cheese. I definitely ate more than I should have! Plus it only took a half hour to throw together.

Great recipe. Before going into the oven I added a couple of spoonfuls of canned diced tomatoes over each chicken breast added slices of an oven-roasted bell pepper sprinkled some dried basil and oregano over everything then topped it all with Parmesan cheese (didn't have Asiago on hand). Served it over pasta.

Very pretty. Tasty but I'd do a Panko crust next time and season more heavily. Somewhat time consuming but could be started and finished later if company were coming. Served with Fettucine with a Trader Joe's Pomodoro Sauce.

I sautéed mushrooms till they were dry and steamed broccoli till just about done separately. Did not use egg or breadcrumbs (eating carb free) used rosemary s&p and garlic powder while sautéing the chicken. Sprayed a glass baking dish added the cooked chicken the warmed peppers mushrooms and broccoli around the chicken topped with some cheese. Broiled till cheese was golden. Came out great.

This was extremely easy to make and a very good basic recipe. I followed the recipe as written the first time and simply wanted to add a little extra seasoning. I would recommend adding some additional herbs depending on the side dish (since we used pasta I added some dried basil and oregano I would also like to try adding some rosemary or cayenne to change it up).

I needed a quick chicken thigh recipe. Only made the chicken part not the pepper part. Delicious! Didn't have asiago so I used Parmesan and it was so yummy and easy peasy. Added just a tiny bit of salt before serving. So good and easy. Definitely banking this recipe.
