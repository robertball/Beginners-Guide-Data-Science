This was absolutely delicious! Family loved it, especially the crunchy topping. For my self I had half spaghetti and half zoodles (zucchini noodles) very filling.. I also made my own alfredo, recipe from this site  which I made extra garlicky and added more like half a cup of pasta water because It was a little dry otherwise. Will definately make again.

Here is another one that is a great concept but I feel needs some tweaking for it to be successful. They did not have the correct pasta that the recipe called for so I subbed rigatoni. The dish was delicious but a little too dry. When you add the crumble on the top it soaks up a good deal of sauce so next time I would add extra.

While reading the ingredients I was like, "Really? Pistachios on pasta? That's kind of weird." But then I started making it and OMG, Yasss! I couldn't get this into my mouth fast enough. The flavors come together so well, and the crunchy panko and pistachios just really add so much and put this dish over the top. I did make my own alfredo sauce from scratch, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.
This is definitely a keeper that will be making a regular appearance in our dinner rotation.

Used alfredo sauce from a mix and milk, and used a different pasta, but the directions were spot on and it was all delicious.
