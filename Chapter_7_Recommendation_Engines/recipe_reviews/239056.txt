I cut back on the brown sugar a bit (personal preference) and since I wanted a thicker soup, probably used about 20% less chicken broth than recipe specified. The bread cubes do a nice job on thickening the soup, and I used my immersion blender instead of processing in a blender.   Made for lunch today and was quite happy with the flavor that came from canned tomatoes rather than making it totally from scratch.  Tomato soup has been one of my favs since childhood, and I'll be making this one again.  Thanks geode for a nice new recipe.

Great tasting soup. I substituted canned crushed tomatoes for the whole tomatoes - saved a little work mashing them. Came out perfect. Served it with grilled cheese. It was delicious.

Replaced brown sugar with white and instead of bread I added steamed cauliflower to thicken and give it a creamy look.

I made it as written except I used dried basil and white sugar as that was what I had. It was delicious, so simple I made it while chatting with my brother. Four of us enjoyed it with cucumber sandwiches.

I made this impromptu so had to substitute a few things.  It was my first time making it, but I don't think it suffered in the least from the substitutions.  I had fresh Beefsteak tomatoes from my garden so I used those.  I used my Vitamix blender and pureed the onions, garlic and tomatoes after lengthy simmering.  Vegetable Broth was used since my daughter is vegetarian (I cut the amount in half), and, since I had no bread, I used smoked gouda Triscuits; they worked great. I added them after pureeing, and they blended right in with no mashing.  Rich, creamy, yes, even decadent-tasting soup, especially for something so healthy, with the added plus of the whole -grain Triscuits.  Wonderful soup!

Absolutely delicious! I made this tonight using sourdough bread from Boudin's Bakery. And an immersion blender makes blending soups so much easier - no transferring between pot and blender that way. Highly recommend this recipe!! The fresh basil adds such great flavor that I wouldn't substitute for dried unless you absolutely must.

I would love to have done this as geome wrote it, but I made a few tweaks for what was on hand - and olive oil blender-emulsion style for the butter, dried basil instead of fresh, and sugar substitute. It was GREAT - I can only imagine how much better it will be when I do it "right".

We enjoyed this easy, delicious and creamy tomato soup.  I used homemade chicken broth, home-canned tomatoes and dried basil. Adding in the slices of cubed bread, resulted in a thick soup. Instead of a blender I used my immersion blender which worked beautifully on this soup. Thank you, geome for sharing your recipe. It is definitely a keeper!

This is a terrific, tasty, easy to whip up soup!  I’ll never use canned tomato soup again when I can make this flavor loaded soup with either bread or puréed cauliflower in place of the usually added cream in 20 minutes or so.  Thanks for a favorite recipe!

this was like pasta sauce - but without the tomato taste!
If I were to make it again (but I won't) I'd use less bread, more broth and more salt...that might make it less like sauce and more like soup.

I've been making this for a while now I think I should rate it, can't believe I haven't yet. I like this very much, I use tomatoes out of my garden (I do prepare my tomatoes as if I were going to can them first) I follow this recipe except I do not put the bread in it. I make my own croutons and add some to each bowl. This thickens it.  The croutons are also favored with parmesan cheese and that also adds to the soup.

Wonderful and easy. Did taste a bit like spaghetti sauce so I added Parmesan cheese to mellow out the saucy taste

I make this vegan so use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and Earth Balance instead of butter.  I double the recipe because my family loves it and the published recipe just isn't enough!

Did the directions exactly and it turned out fantastic. Instead of chicken stock I used a vegetable cube with two cups of water. And I used an emulsion blender instead of transfering small amounts to a regular blender

Loved this soup.  Turned out  much tastier than canned store bought.  I didn't have an onion, or fresh basil, so I substituted dried basil.  I also used sourdough bread and my immersion blender which was less of a mess or dishes to clean up after.  I will be making this soup again soon.  So easy when everything I need is always a staple in the kitchen.

I didn't add the brown sugar because I felt like it was unnecessary, and cutting down on the butter would be good, but other than that it was delicious and has the perfect texture.
