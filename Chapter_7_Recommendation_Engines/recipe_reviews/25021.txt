These really are good cookies, with endless possibilites for variations. I made mine without chocolate chips and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 c. nuts, and 1 cup raisins. I like my cookies a little bigger, so I used a 1/4 cup ice cream scoop, flattened them slightly, and baked about 12 minutes.

This has got to be the BEST cookie recipe I have ever tried.  I made some changes for myself.  I used chopped dried apricots and dried currants instead of raisins, and I also coarsely chopped the chocolate chips (I didn't have any miniature ones to use which I prefer over the reg size).  But it was the basic recipe for the dough that makes these cookies.  Mine turned out outstanding and I'm making another batch right away to ship to my daughter away at college.
Thank you so much for posting this!!!

My family really enjoyed these cookies. I split the recipe & added only raisins & peacans to 1/2 & raisins, peacans & milk chocolate chips to the other half. I also added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to they entire recipe. They were both delicious. Don't spray the cookie sheet, it makes them come out flat. My first tray did, but after that I didn't spray the cookie sheet & they came out perfect. This is my favorite Oatmeal Recipe now.

I loved this recipe. The cookies are very soft and flavorfull.
I think the key is to take the cookies out after no longer than 10 min. even though thet may not look done, they do continue to cook after they are out of the oven.

I liked another recipe in the oatmeal section better, but I didn't have the butter shortening it called for as well as butter, so I thought I would just use this as the base and only put in the raisins.  I did add some spice as another reviewer did.  At first I was disappointed because they turned out flat. But! they were delicious. So the next batch I did not grease the sheet, and this time they turned out perfect, nice cookies.  So..if your pan doesn't stick bad, I wouldn't grease it.  Unless you like the flat style. ;)  Thanks for a great recipe!

Tasted great, followed the recipe exactly. I don't understand why people around here add their own ingredients and then rate there own recipe as if it were the original.

This has become my favorite basic oatmeal cookie dough recipe with a few minor changes: I use 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup regular flour, 1 1/2 cup brown sugar and a little less than half cup of white sugar, use walnuts or almonds instead of pecans, and omit the salt.   I like this recipe because it makes a basic oatmeal dough to which you can add whatever you'd like.  One time I made oatmeal raisin cookies, the next time I used only chocolate chips and walnuts.  I've also frozen half of the dough (without any of the raisins, chips, etc.) and just took it out of the freezer, let it thaw, added what I want to it and baked for about 10-12 minutes.  The possibilities are endless with this dough.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This is one of the best Oatmeal Raisin cookies I have ever had! They are really moist and chewy! I changed the ingredients around a little bit. I put 1/2C of white sugar instead of 1C, 3tsp. of vanilla instead of 1tsp., 3/4C extra raisins, I melted the butter in the microwave before mixing, and added 1tsp. of honey to the whole batter. ( I heard it makes cookies more moist), and I excluded the pecans and chocolate chips. I have to say these cookies are spectacular! I read tons of recipes to find out which one I would use to make oatmeal raisin cookies and I liked the sound of all the ingredients so I tried it! Yum Yum!! I also took the last half of the batter and added one full mashed banana in and mixed it up well.  I cooked them about 10 min. It was delicious! Tastes just like a banana bread cookie!

DELICIOUS!! I have made these cookies over and over and they always turn out great! I also add about a tablespoon or so of honey to make it a bit more chewy and soft. They are wonderful and my family agrees!

As a pastry chef, I'm always playing with recipes.  I tried these at home and they were good, but were a little dry....next time I'd cut back on the oatmeal.  I also added additional spices to give the cookies another dimension.

These tasted exactly like a good quality oatmeal raisin cookie you would find in a bakery. Here are some helpful tips that I thought worked really well from other reviewers: Don't grease the cookie sheets or else cookies come out flat and also don't leave the cookies in longer than 10 min. I tweaked the recipe a bit by using about 1/2 cup of sugar, used 1 1/2 cups of raisins instead of the chocolate chips and pecans, added 1 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and added 1 tablespoon of honey. So delicious! I finally found my oatmeal raisin cookie to use from now on.

Very nice cookie! Followed the recipe except I split the dough for two kinds. Used 1cup Walnuts for both types but added a heaping 1/2 cup of raisins to the batter for the second type. Also left out the chocolate chips. I baked for a bit longer but probably just my oven. I got 4 dozen cookies using a #20 scoop. (little ice cream scoops) It is the only  way to get uniform cookies quickly and easily. PS. I used "Old Fashion" oats. I like the "chew" from them.

This is officially my favorite oatmeal cookie recipe because they don't come out like flat pieces of leather! I live at high altitude (7000 ft) and this is the first oatmeal cookie I've made that keeps its shape. I made the recipe exactly as written except I added a little cinnamon and didn't grease my cookie sheet. They came out perfect! One variation I've also made is to replace the raisins with craisins and the milk chocolate chips with white chocolate chips, delicious! I look forward to experimenting with this recipe some more to see how far I can take it since it is now going to be my go-to cookie recipe here. I'm thinking of adding peanut butter next... thanks for sharing! After hundreds of failed cookies, this is a keeper!

Being very picky about my cookies, I am often hesitant to venture beyond my tried and true cookie recipes which I have collected over the past 30+ years.  This recipe is hands down the best one I have tried.  No frills, no spices, etc. to distract from the wonderful and simple oatmeal taste.  This recipe has now replaced the one I have used for a good long time, and it needs no adjustments made to it.  Perfect as it is.  If you don't have chocolate chips when you make this recipe, don't let that deter you.  I have made these a few times without them, and they are still just as delicious!   Thanks for sharing a fabulous recipe that has become  a favorite of all the cookie snobs at my house!

I knew there was a cookie recipe on here that I've used many times and forgot to review; this one is it. Because I have three large ring-binders full of printed recipes I need to come up with an index of sort so I can find my favorites right away.  These are probably my husband's favorite cookies; they are just like his mother used to make. Whenever I make these I double the amount of raisins and chocolate chips, and also add toasted pecans.  Last night I realized that I didn't have any rolled oats in the house so I substituted with quick-cooking oats and the cookies came out just great. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.  I have to say that I think this is just the greatest Web site, and it's so nice having so many knowledgeable and generous cooks out there who are willing to share their enjoyment of cooking.

These were delicious! I made a few changes: melted the butter before hand, added 3tsp vanilla instead of 1tsp, added 1.5Tbsp honey (I was looking for a very vanilla/brown sugar-ish cookie), reduced the white sugar to 1/2C, and gave my oats a once over in the food processor- i think it makes the cookies easier to eat. I LOVE these.

These are great Oatmeal cookies.  I'm about to make a batch that will accompany my climbing crew up Mt Moran.

Solid work!


Oh almost forgot, I don't use any chocolate chips, the Nuts and Oats do a fine job all by themselves

Really good flavor! I found it a little dry. I used shortening instead of butter, maybe that had something to do w/it. IDK.

Everyone seems to love these cookies- they are easy to customize, as you can use white chocolate chips mixed with semi-sweet, or even butterscotch. They make a large batch and are delicious!

I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c applesauce, replaced white sugar with equivalent of Splenda baking mix, and omitted raisins. Added one tsp cinnamon, increased choc chips and pecans to 1 c each. These were great, although I may slip in even more choc chips next time. Not super sweet this way, but healthier!!! I also would decrease flour by 1/2 c next time, these were a little cakey for me, but they weren't dry!

These were good...and we finished off the entire batch in 2 days, but I'm still searching for that perfect recipe.  I added some cinnamon and left out the chocolate chips since I didn't have any.  I cooked the first batch for about 10 minutes and let them rest on the cookie sheet while they cooled and they came out perfect.  The other batch I left in the oven a little too long, and they were hard and crunchy, but we still ate them.  May sound silly but I've never had a better oatmeal cookie than the ones they served on a Continental flight I was on a while back.  The ones they give you with those little sandwiches and carrot sticks.  I'm gonna keep searchin' but your version was yummy Shannon.  Thanks

Delicious.  I wanted to be sure they were NOT the flat kind so I didn't let the butter get too soft and I made them larger than the recipe says (9 per cookie sheet, made 18).  They were perfect.  Personally, I prefer oatmeal cookies with some spices so I'll probably add cinnamon next time but still, these were great.

Great recipe.  I left out the chocolate chips and pecans this time around and added chopped dried apricots and cranberries along with the raisins.  Also a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice as well. Turned out wonderful.  Great recipe to adjust ingredients to fit the time of year.

A nice, thick and chewy cookie!  A real hit with my family.  The recipe made about 4 dozen and they disappeared fast!  I put in a few tablespoons less sugar than called for, and they were still sweet enough.  A keeper!

Very Good!  I found them to be really chewy, but unfortunately not very moist. They even stayed chewy after cooling. I think I would not add the full 3 cups of oats the next time I make these. I did not add raisins, which was a good thing because I don't think I could have gotten anything more into the batter. The batter was so thick I could not drop by spoonfuls but instead had to form balls in my hand. They were fairly quick, and made exactly the amount the recipe said.

I cannot count how many times I've made this recipe over the past years. I don't add pecans raisins, however, I increase the choc. chips and add some vanilla chips (sometimes I'll throw in butterscotch chips).  You cannot go wrong with this great recipe.  I ALWAYS use the old-fashioned Oatmeal. My grandkids help me make this recipe and we always double or triple the recipe (which helped them use their multiplication skills in a practical way).   :)

DELICIOUS! This is definitely my new go to oatmeal recipe with, like another reviewer mentioned, with endless possibilities. I used chocolate chips and cranberries in place of raisins, next time I will add pecans. My family and friends absolutely loved this recipe. Thank you!

I will never use another recipe when I want to bake oatmeal cookies!! These are the BEST hands down!! The only thing I did different was I used 1/2 cup (unsalted) butter and 1/2 cup shortening in the mixture instead of using 1 cup of butter and I added 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon right before dropping them onto a cookie sheet with parchment paper on it. Absolutely mouth watering cookies!!!

I cut the recipe in half~ and I didn't have any raisins.  (Wish I did though!)  I dropped a little more than teaspoon dough sized mounds on my cookie sheets.  These cookies turned out marvelous!! Oh my they are good!  5 STARS!

Really a great cookie!  I substituted butterscotch chips for chocolate (not a chocolate fan) but otherwise followed the recipe and they turned out great.  I will definitely make these again, perhaps eliminating the chips altogether and increasing the pecans...

The best oatmeal cookies I've ever tasted. Occasionally I try different recipes, this is the one I always come back to. I've made them with all the chips, raisins, nuts, and I've made them just plain and they are delicous both ways. The batter is kind of hard to mix once you add all the oats. If you don't have a heavy dutty mixer, your arm will be sore, but trust me, these cookies are worth it!

Very good recipe! For a little variation in flavor, I used toasted walnuts and also toasted the rolled oats...350 degrees for 8 minutes on a cookie sheet is all it takes! Yummy! Thanks Shannon!:)

Good!  My husband agrees!  I also reduced each sugar measurement by 1/4.  2 1/4-1/2 cups of oatmeal worked for me.  I increased the chopped nuts to 1+ cup and omitted the chocolate chips.  They baked 12 minutes at 365 degrees and did not spread!  I also can't believe I made exaclty 36 cookies.  Definitly a recipe I would use again and with a variety of add-ins.

The only thing I have to say about this recipe (other than it is SO good) is that it needs longer than 8-10 minutes if you make large cookies rather than teaspoon size cookies.  I have them in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes.
DELICIOUS Bobbie whoever you are!

I only added raisins due to a nut allergy and not having any chocolate chips on hand. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. With these small changes this recipe was wonderful. I will definitely make it again (maybe tomorrow!)

these were really yummy! I doubled the vanilla, added some cinnamon and omitted the pecans due to allergies, 12 minutes was perfect in my oven on Silpat lined sheets, I used my #50 scoop and got 51 cookies, flattened with the bottom of a glass, I also chilled the dough before baking.

Wow, are these dangerous!! In a really good kinda way! I was looking for yummy cookie recipe so i could finally use up my cinnamon chips! I used them in place if raisins, pecans and choc chips.  That's the only change I made..w/the exception of letting the vanilla spill over more than 1tsp. Froze most of the dough for later. Yummmmm

Made them. First batch, I didn't think was done, left in too long, and now they are crisp/dry. Do yourself a favor and take them out at the appro. time, let them sit on the sheet for 5 mins, then remove. That second batch is still chewy and moist. Overall, both types are still very edible and delicious. Entire family loves them. Thanks!

Like so many others have noted, these cookies are very easy to customize.  I have made them twice now and this last time I used half butter and half butter flavored shortening....which makes the cookie spread out (butter) and yet remain chewy (shortening).  I used dried blueberries, oatmeal, white chocolate chips and almonds.....yummy yummy!  Try these cookies you will not be dissapointed!!

I made these cookies with my daughters (4 and 6) on a lazy Saturday and they loved them! Very moist and thick! i did use a little wheat flour and next time will use half the sugar. A little too sweet for my taste, but definately a keeper! Thanks!

I never write reviews, but I had to for this recipe.  These cookies were amazing.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and they were by far the best oatmeal cookies I've ever made.  My flatmates raved about them, and they didn't last the night.  I seriously recommend these cookies!

I have made these several times in the last month and they are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made. I use dark brown sugar and dark chocolate chips to give them a slightly richer flavor. Wonderful!

These cookies are so good!  I split the batter and added only chocolate chips to half and chopped up banana to half and both batches were delicious.
TIP: if you don't want your cookies to spread out too much while cooking, put the cookie sheet (with the cookie dough on it) in the fridge for a few minutes before putting it in the oven.

Second time making these delicious cookies.  Made with the assistance of a Cuisinart and a 2.5 and 4.5 year old.  Second time around, subsituted with 1 c w/w flour, 1/2 c white flour, 1/4 wheat germ, 1/4 flax seed.  Only had chocolate chips this time around.  Baked for the minimum time.  Didn't look done, but it was.  Stayed soft for days and days, well, as long as it took before they were gobbled.  Probably put on a few pounds from these.  Thanks for the rockin' recipe.

These cookies were great. They baked very, very quickly on my silpat, about five or six minutes per batch. Try making them with cranberries instead of raisins, everyone loved them.

These are great! Moist and chewy. I used raisins AND cranberries  and substituted walnuts for the pecans. The dough will be very thick. Be careful not to over cook them. They should barely be brown when you take them out.

Great cookies. Very chewy. Do only use a spoonful of dough, though, as these spread out quite a bit as they cook.

This is a pretty good recipe, but please don't try crisco or margarine in this recipe, it may turn out okay but butter will make it taste rich...butter is essential in baking!  I think it calls for too much oats so I used 2 1/4 cups, and will cut it to 2 C next time for a chewier cookie.

I used 2 cups oatmeal, 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, and walnuts (instead of pecans). Following the advice of other reviewers, I didn't grease the pans. I was able to make 60 cookies with the batter. I brought 3 dozen to work the very next day and they were gone in 3 hours! Terrific recipe--thanks Shannon!

this was a great recipe.  i baked the cookies for 10 minutes, and they turned out nice and soft, and stayed that way the next day.  i added a 1/2 t of cinnamon as some others had suggested, decreased the oatmeal to 2 1/3 cups and didn't grease the cookie sheet, but lined it with foil instead (i do this to all my cookies, and they never stick).  i think next time i will use more than a half cup of nuts though, or bigger chunks of nuts, b/c i couldn't really taste them too well.

This recipe is the best!!!  I am pregnant and have been craving Otis Spunkmeyer Oatmeal Raisin cookies. These are so very close.  I deleted both sugars by 1/4 cup(just because I don't like things super sweet), also deleted the nuts and chocolate chips.  I then added about another 1/4 cup of raisins.  Thank you so much for curing my craving.  Another note, I can't believe this recipe actually made 36 cookies.  Cookie recipes never make as many as they say they will.

These were delicious! I used 1 1/2 c. Brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar as someone else recommended, and omitted the pecans and chocolate chips and used 1 1/2 c raisins. And the batter will be very thick, and just wanted to note that whatever shape you spoon the cookies onto the sheet is the way they will look when they finish baking. These are soft and moist and wonderful!

These are awesome! I changed it up just a tad, I added a little cinnamon & unsweeted cocoa (had seen another recipe that used a lot of cocoa and didn't think it was a bad idea!), replaced the pecans with almonds since that's what I had on hand & left out the chocolate chips since I was out,  but otherwise left the recipe as written. SOOO good. I don't think the chocolate chips/pecans would change it any and I'll have try it that way next time. My husband and I ate way too many the first night I made them and my three year old specifically said "these are delicious cookies you made mommy!". Definitely a keeper -- super easy and super yummy!

Wonderful!! Made the house smell good too. Family can't stop eating them. I tried one so I could write a review. Pretty dang good! Crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle. Didn't have raisens or pecans so I used dried cranberries and walnuts-super yummy. I loved reading everyone's tweek's to the recipe, I'll have to try some of those twists in the future.

After reading many reviews, I made these cookies exactly as written and found them to be extraordinary!  I've been baking cookies since I was 12 (I'm now 69) and this recipe goes to the top of my list of favorites.  It's a chewy cookie...just the way I like oatmeal cookie to be.  I did find that I had to bake them longer than the recipe required (14 minutes) and allowed them to cool the 5 minutes before removing them from the cookie sheet.  I did not grease my cookie sheets and they turned out fine.  I was babysitting my neighbor's children who gobbled them up and asked for more...a real testament of how good they are!

I originally tried this recipe for a cookie swap because my husband didn't like Oatmeal cookies and I thought they'd be safe in the house.  They were amazing and my husband loved them.  I swapped out the raisins for a cup of mixed dried berries.  The dark chocolate chips paired perfectly with them.  I also tried a white chocolate variation using white chocolate chips and a white chocolate liquor in place of the vanilla extract.

I thought it was strange to grease the baking sheets for cookies, but it is definitely necessary, as they are sticky cookies. Tasted very good. I used white chocolate chips and apricots instead of raisin (I made them for a new mom, and heard that oats, pecans, and apricots might help with milk production)

they looked perfect. There was just the right combination for the dough to maintain its shape, not to dry, not too wet. I didn't have raisins so thru in a cup of pretzel m&m's i had. The kids adored them. Dad did as well.

These are the best Oatmeal cookies ever.  Light and crispy and delicious.  Decided not to add the choc. chips, but otherwise followed the recipe to a tee. I don't think the cookies lacked anything without the choc chips, they stand on their own. I finely chopped the pecans.  They flattened out but to a nice thickness.  It's important to let them sit on the baking sheet for a few minutes otherwise they're too soft to hold their shape.  I won't be using any other recipe for Oatmeal Cookies in future.  Thanks to the poster.  Made 72 nice sized cookies.

The absolute best oatmeal cookies I have ever tested! All of my friends raved about them. The only thing I did differently was I cut the recipe in half and only used 5 tbs butter, still used 1/2 cup chocolate chips, and left out the raisins and nuts. Amazing and so moist!

These were great! Very moist.  The only changes I made were adding slightly more chocolate chips- 1 cup total and I omitted the pecans.  Plus I added 1 tsp cinnamon.  I baked them for 10 minutes

Oatmeal raisin cookies are my very favorite type of cookie-- and lemme tell you, these babies take the cake.  Figuratively speaking.  They're nice and chewy and so, so wonderful when they just come out of the oven with a touch of brown on them.

I've been baking these for my mom and my nieces and nephews for the past three years now.  I've finally opened myself an All Recipe member account just to let you know how much I love and enjoy this recipe.  

A very big thank you from my kitchen and me.

My 4 year old son and I just took the last batch out of the oven our whole family has eaten more than a dozen already.  I even used egg substitute and Splenda in place of the white sugar.  My husband who believes that cookies are not as good when healthy ingredients are substituted has admitted that he would never know the difference.  I also added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and soaked the raisins in the egg and vanilla for 1 hour to soften, but neither would be necessary, it is just our personal preference.  I wasn't sure about the chocolate chips, but they add the perfect flavor.  Delicious oatmeal cookie recipe, we will definately use this one again.

The finished product had a nice texture, but I think this recipe is a bit too heavy on the dry ingredients and needs some spices to give it more flavour.  If I were to bake these again, I'd try a third egg and add some cinnamon and more vanilla.

These cookies were pretty good, but a bit floury for me.  I ommitted raisins, as they were for dh, used 1 c. chips, and sub. walnuts, plus a dash of cinnamon.  The dough is really firm, and I used a small ice cream scoop to portion them.  Definitely flatten before putting in the oven. 12 minutes gave them good texture, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, however, they didn't really brown on top. May mess around with the dry ingredients next time.

I thought this was a great cookie recipe.  I left out the cho chips as a personal preference. I brought some to work today and they were gone by 9.

We LOVED this cookie!  I didn't change a thing of the recipe and the cookies came out soft, chewy and yummy.  I'll be making these cookies again and again.

Great cookies!  I soaked the raisins in hot water for about five minutes to plump them up.  I left out the pecans because I didn't have any on hand.  I was a little skeptical about the small amount of chocolate chips, but it ended up being a good amount for the recipe.

Turned out perfectly, followed the recipe to the letter.  Delicious, I can't stay out of them. I thought they'd be a little too busy but the pecans add *just* the perfect touch to the flavor.  I love them.

Excellent! Chewy and sweet! II used raisins and only 2.5 cup of oats as that is all I could make mix into the batter. I also used real butter. I will make these again and again.

I followed this recipe exactly, but for some reason my cookies taste like hardened oatmeal! :( I'm not sure what I did wrong, and I'm sad since everyone else's reviews are great! I'll give it a try again, and hopefully they'll turn out better. It's obviously me, not the recipe.

These cookies taste good. Made the recipe as shown except I got nervous about 3 cups of oats being too much for my ancient mixer to blend in. Thought it would get too dry. So I put in 2 1/4 cups. They were moist and chewy and did not fall flat. My husband and I both liked them.

A good cookie recipe, though not the best I ever had.  I will make it again.  The dough spread a bit more than I liked.  When making the second batch, I refrigerated the dough for an hour before baking.  This greatly improved the texture and reduced the amount of spreading.

Bobbie Rocks!

My fiance loves them - we make these all the time.  They were a huge hit at my aunt and uncle's 50th wedding anniversary celebration.  My father stole the last batch during his last visit and said we could make these for him any time we wanted.

I'd say these would be in my permanent recipe collection!  Thanks for posting, Shannon.

This recipe was pretty good..  The first day I made them they were really moist and chewy, but the next day they were not soft after I put them in a container.  I also didn't use the nuts, but I used more chocolate chips instead.  I used butter flavored Crisco too.  I use that will all my recipes that call for butter.  If you do, just make sure you follow the instructions on the package, you have to also add a little water.

I like it that these cookies didn't flatten out like some other oatmeal cookies and the texture was good.  
The only minus for me was that they were just a little bland.  It needs something.  Perhaps spices such as cinnamon.  

Otherwise, a really good cookie.

Cookies were okay (but not as I expected from reading other reviews.)  They stayed in a mound-shape from the cookie scoop and didn't spread out at all.  Had to flatten out to cook all way through.  Mine turned out a tad bit on the dry side for some reason.  Other than that, it was an easy recipe and the pecans gave it a very unique flavor.

Far and away the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made.  I used milk choc chips, instead of semi-sweet and also added about 1/2 cup of coconut for extra texture and taste.  What a great cookie.  This will be the only oatmeal cookie recipe I use in the future!!!!

These cookies come out just right if you follow the baking direction just as it says taking them out of the oven after 12 min and then cooling for 5 min on the cookie sheet before removing to the rack.  I added a little cinnamon and cloves to spice them up a little.  They were so crisp on the outside yet soft and chewy in the middle.  I didn't have any problems with the dough being too dry like some said.  Try them and watch them dissappear.  In fact......I think I'll go have another now :).

Wonderful recipe! Taste just like one I for some reason can't find anymore on this site, so I am so happy about finding this one! These have perfect sweetness and I addes chocolate chips and white chocolate chips too in half the batch. These are great because you can add any nut, raisins, white and regular chocholate chips and no matter what it tastes great! THank you!

This is an awesome recipe! Very easy to make. I love recipes that have 1 cup measurements instead of 2/3 cup of this, or 1/4 cup plus 1 Tbl of that.

My husband doesn't like nuts, and I didn't have any chocolate chips, so I used 1 cup of butterscotch chips instead, but they were awesome!  It's a great cookie recipe, and they bake up very nice.  Chewy and moist, and they keep very well, too. Definately a keeper! Thank you.

These cookies were delicious. I did have a problem with around the edges getting a little to hard, but I believe that was the pans fault. I baked them on a air bake pan.

I live in New Zealand, where people know of oatmeal cookies as a popular, kinda archetypal American food, but I don't know anyone who bakes or eats them. Because I'm getting into baking my sister asked me to try making oatmeal cookies, out of curiosity, and a search led me to this recipe. The results were *lovely* - I don't know why this kind of cookie isn't popular here! I used the basic recipe with chocolate chips and walnut pieces (because that was what I had handy, and I don't like peanuts in cookies) - because of the size of my cookies I found they needed a good deal more than the stated cooking time, but that was my own fault. I'll definitely make these again, and although my sister isn't home yet I'm sure she's going to like them! I think this would make an excellent lunchbox cookie; the rolled oats make them filling and sustaining, and the chocolate chips make them a treat =)

I've had better, but they are ok. Mine needed to be cooked about 12 minutes. They would have been better if I had chopped the oats in my chopper to a finer texture.

I just made these cookies and I followed the recipe exactly. I cut the recipe in half because I was skeptical about the wet to dry ratio of ingredients (it's not a problem) and it seemed like a lot. I reserved some of the dough to be without nuts and raisins and replaced them with more choc chips and broken pretzel bits. I highly recommend the pretzel if you like sweet and salty foods.  Both turned out really good!  I hand formed 18 dough balls about the size of a ping pong ball.  The cookies have a nice, chewy texture. This recipe is a versatile oatmeal cookie base to add other ingredients. Next time I'll stick to the choc chip and pretzels but that's my preference.  I didn't want to review the recipe unless I actually tried it as written.

These are crazy good.  I didn't add a full 2cups of sugar or 1c brown. Used an ungreased baking stone --10mins at 350. Moist and yummy.

All I had was quick oats so I use it instead of the rolled & dropped them by heaping teaspoons.  I ended up with 7 dozen cookies.  I sure was glad they were good.  You can do a lot with this recipe by changing the dry fruit, nuts & chips.

I added 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and allspice, no raisins and 1 cup of chocolate chips. Mine did not flatten and I sprayed my sheets with cooking spray , I like a flatter cookie so I pressed mine down with a fork after trying the first batch without.

Just made these for my family.  It is our favorite oatmeal cookie recipe (we have tried many).  Used full heaping real tablespoon to put on baking pan and cookies were done in 8 minutes.  Used 1 cup whole wheat flour in place of white flour to make little healthier, and didn't add chocolate, raisins, or pecans.

I was in the mood to bake something. I tried these oatmeal cookies, they were good. I don't know why but the batter was kind of dry. Maybe next time I will use 1/2 less oats. Other than that very tasty.

I did half of the recipe, replaced the flour for wheat flour and used 1/2 cup of sugar cane sugar and some honey. I also didn't put the chocolate, raisins and nuts because I didn't have any. Turned out absolutly delicious!

The first time I made them, they were a bit cake-y. The 2nd time I modified the recipe a bit.  I used a 1 1/2 cups of each sugar. (The half cup of white sugar I subbed  with Splenda and the half cup brown sugar, I subbed Splenda brown sugar) left out the raisins, used 1c. Milk chocolate chips and only used 2c. rolled oats. Level TBSP for 12mins, bottom rack.

The best Knock-You-Out-Of-The-Park cookies I've ever baked! Reduce the Oats to 2 Cups, and up the Chocolate Chips and Pecans to 3/4 cup, and they are to die for! 12 minutes at 350 is just perfect :)

This is the best oatmeal cookie.  You can change what you want to add as far as chocolate chips, raisins, and what kind of nuts.  I put coconut, currants and a few chocolate chips made out of carab the last time I made them.  There is only two of us.  So I just make them about once a month for us.  They are a great cookies to work with  and change around.

Soft and chewy, ever so lightly crisp  edges, good flavor.  This is exactly what I was looking for, although I did add a touch of cinnamon. Update: I've used this recipe many, many times and have found that chilling the dough for at least a day improves the texture, taste and appearance. For those who've had "flat" results, try chilling to decrease the "spread". Great cookie. A double batch fits perfectly in  my Kitchenaid 600, and I always use a scoop for the dough. I scoop the dough into a plastic container, then pop the scooped dough onto parchment-lined baking sheets the next day. I have also kept scooped dough in the freezer for freshly baked cookies on demand.

Fresh out of the oven, these cookies fall apart in your mouth and are absolutely delish!  After a day or so, they become a bit dry and dense, but still yummy.  I think they might be better with a little bit less oatmeal.  I altered this recipe by omitting the chocolate chips, raisins, and pecans so that I could feed them to my 15 month old son.  We all agreed that they were yummy!  Would definitely make again!

Very, very good cookie that I will make again & again. I've made this recipe with walnuts instead of pecans, chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips, and chopped prunes instead of raisins.  No matter what, they are wonderful. Next time I make them, I'll try adding some coconut.   Some reviewers have said that the cookies spread out too much when they are cooked -- I find that if I line the cookie sheets with parchment paper, they stay nice and mounded. Thank you, Shannon, for sharing this recipe!

OMG! WOW! These cookies are AMAZING! I made these cookies for my grandmother - she just wanted plain oatmeal cookies so I excluded the pecans and other things. This recipe doesn't call for 1 tsp. cinnamon, but I promise you it will make the cookie! I added a few chocolate chips and walnuts to some cookies for myself and baked them for 12 minutes to get a little browner - these cookies are so soft and taste so good! You must try these!

This is a GREAT cookie recipe; I omitted the raisins, chocolate chips and pecans and replaced them with 1/2 c sweetened coconut, 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts and 3/4 cup white chocolate chunks... the texture of this cookie is chewy, perfectly sweet- a perfect blend of oatmeal and chocolate chunk!

Great recipe! I did everything exactly as stated except I didn't grease my baking sheet. I already have a non-stick cookie sheet and it doesn't really need any grease for the cookies. I also didn't add the pecans due to a nut allergy in the family. My husband, daughter and I LOVE them!! I will be using this recipe again for sure. Thanks!

Definitely LOOOOVVEEE These cookies. I've been following this recipe for about 2 years (maybe more) now. I gave these for Christmas to relatives and bosses and everybody's asked for more! Even my GRANDMA and Aunt (who both used to teach baking and love to bake) are asking me to make more!

My bosses and colleagues can't get enough of this, even my husbands bosses and colleagues have been asking me to make more and are willing to pay me for it  hahah tThank you so much for this recipe!

I changed out the raisins for dried cranberries and the vanilla for rum extract.  Also used extra thick whole rolled oats.  Per earlier suggestion I didn't grease the cookie sheet and they did very well.

Really good!  Baking isn't my strongest suit, but these came out terrific.  We don't like chocolate chips in oatmeal cookies, so I omitted those, and added some coconut to the batter, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I made these last year for Christmas give-aways, but noticed that they are best eaten shortly after baking...this year we'll just eat them ourselves, and pick another recipe to use for gifts. I'm sure my family won't mind...they're delicious!

I enjoyed these cookies, unfortunately I'm the only person in my family who will eat oatmeal cookies.

These were flat, somewhat   moist and chewy and had a nice overall down-home oatmeal flavor.  

I would recommend them to oatmeal cookie lovers.

Great cookie!  I've been looking for an oatmeal cookie that is not flat after cooking.  This is it!  And it tastes great!  I did chill the dough for an hour or two before baking to make sure it did not spread too much on the cookie sheet.

I made the cookies for a road trip with my girl friends yesterday and they were a huge hit! I just had to make 2 substitutions based on my pantry: walnuts instead of pecans and Splenda sugar baking blend instead of white sugar.

These are by far the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I've made or had. They are really easy to make (my 5 year old helped me) and the batch is so large that you can easily only bake a fraction and keep the rest on hand for fresh baking when needed. I only made two changes to the recipe as written. I know many people who have 'issues' with raisins, so I substituted with craisins. I also reduced both sugars a wee bit, just because of personal preference. I don't hesitate to give it 5 stars because I know as written it deserves it. Happy baking!

this is a great, basic oatmeal cookie recipe that I have had a lot of success "altering" to suit my cravings and pantry. today I used  1/3c. w/w flour, 1/3c. wheat germ, 1/3 c. bran and 1c. white flour. I then ommited the nuts and raisins, but added 1c. mini chocolate chips and 1c. peanut butter chips... this produced such crumbly dough that I thought I had really blown it - but 9 mins in the on and *presto* the best damned cookies I have ever baked!

Thanks for the recipe.

The first time I used this recipe I left out the pecans and the cookies turned out great! Followed the recipe exactly and the cookies were chewy and delicious. The second time I used this recipe I adjusted the quantity and left out the chocolate chips and the cookies were crunchy and not so great. I will try this recipe again without adjusting the servings and see how they turn out.

I only made half the recipe b/c I was low in ingredients, and they really didn't turn out that good.  I used whole wheat flour which may have made a difference, and I don't think my oatmeal was quickoats, so they were very bland, not much flavour.  I'll try them again and use white flour.

Yum yum!  I had to give most of these away, because I couldn't stop eating them!  I made as directed, except only used about 2 cups of oats...I wanted to put the other cup in, but didn't have enough 'batter' to use it, I know it would've made my batch too dry.  So, other than that, the recipe is perfect.  I wasn't sure I'd like the chocolate in them, and I didn't...I loved it!  These were great for breakfast.  Great all the time really, that's why I'm not sure when I'll make them again.  Oh, I used golden raisins too, I love them in recipes.  Great cookies!

Oatmeal cookie recipes I've made before had spices where this one didn't. It gave me a chance to try something new. Glad I did.  It still was flavorful. It took a little longer for the centers to bake (was a little raw after cook time). They stayed soft. I'll make these again.  Thanks for the recipe. I left out the chocolate chips and nuts.

This recipe is on my all-time favorite list.  I omitted the pecans and upped the chocolate to 1 cup.  I used chocolate chunks instead of chips and big plump raisins.  These are my husband's favorite and he's very particular about his cookies!  This is a definite keeper.

Wow! These cookies are great. The only thing we did differently is we used 1 cup of chocolate chips and left out the pecans  and we baked the cookies for 12 minutes. They were nice and crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle. This is a great recipe. Thanks.

This is an incredible recipe!  My family and friends love them!  I've substituted currants for raisins, and I've also made them with chunks of white chocolate, dried cranberries and walnuts.  Always a hit... Thanks for sharing!

These were excellent.  I added choc. chips only since I didn't have any pecans or raisins on hand.  These are not too soft and not too crispy, just a nice consistency.  I will make these again and again.  Thanks

These cookies are pretty good!  I added about 1/3 C natural peanut butter to mine, with 1 C of dark chocolate chunks cut from a Ghirardelli hunk, and 2 Tbl flour.  They're tender and didn't spread, so I could probably have done without the extra flour.  I just flattened them with wet fingers.  Got an even six dozen from this recipe.

I had been looking for a good oatmeal cookie recipe, and I was very happy with these.  Recipe, with a few adaptations, produced a thick, chewy, and delicious cookie - two thumbs up for both taste and texture.  Adaptations as follows: 1) Substituted Splenda for white sugar; 2) Was out of brown sugar (too much holiday baking), so substituted turbinado sugar; I didn't notice a real difference on this point, and the molasses flavor was there - probably not as pronounced, though, as with golden or dark sugar (will use that next time); 3) Instead of plain Quaker-style rolled oats, substituted 3 cups of 7 grain cereal - much heartier, more complex flavor I think than the plain oats; would definitely repeat; 4) instead of semisweet chips, substituted very dark chocolate chips in equal measure; 5) omitted raisins - the oatmeal part of cookies always tastes good to me, but am not a fan of raisins in them.  

Changes/tips on baking method: 1) *if you have good nonstick ware*, greasing is not necessary - with the butter in them, these slide off like a dream; 2) found that rounded Tbsp makes a good size, thick cookie - tsp drops made too small for our tastes; 3) baking time is right on - in my oven, 9 minutes produced a great result.  

Thanks so much for a great recipe - I will definitely be making these again!

These were delicious!!  Everyone who tried them raved.  I used half butter and half butter-flavored shortening to make them softer.  Left out the chocolate chips and added extra raisins in place of them.  Added about 3/4 teaspooon cinnamon.  I will definitely make these again!

Wonderful!  You'll be tempted to cook them more than the recommended 8 - 10 minutes.  So much depends on your oven, but they are best when cooked lightly.  This keeps them tender.

Recipe is awesome.  I used shortening instead of butter because I prefer a softer cookie.  Everything's gone well, and I added a little cinnamon.

i took these to church for an after-brunch, and everyone raved. i used white chocolate chips, cranberries, and no pecans. this dough is so versatile, too! the only problem i had was mine took a little longer to bake, but i think that was because my kitchen was freezing. so i don't know about everyone else, but maybe you should keep an eye on them if it's cold in your house. thanks for the great recipe shannon! ;)

Wow!  My co-workers couldn't put them down even the extreme dieters.  I tried this earlier and modified some things (i don't remember what) and it wasn't that great.  2nd time I followed the recipe as is and they were fantastic.   I also have rolled them in saran wrap, stuck them in the fridge and they bake up just perfectly.

I have had this recipe for about a year now, and I've made these cookies soooo many times, and they have never failed me!  They are fabulous, versatile, and just the right amount of chew and crisp.  I love them!  My cookies always take 14 minutes to cook, but it may be that I make them a bit bigger than I'm supposed to.  Once I figured that out they have been about the only cookie I've made.

A nice, basic oatmeal cookie recipe, easily varied.  Reduced the sugar to three quarters of a cup each.  I use one level tablespoonful of dough, flatten and bake for 8 minutes, which yields about 4 dozen cookies.  Definitely follow the instructions and leave on the sheet for 5 min. after removing from the oven or they'll stick.

These are very good, but I think I liked the recipe for "Oatmeal Cookies I" even better. I think these need the touch of cinnamon that the other recipe has.

We enjoyed this recipe very much....
I changed it slightly by using 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortning.
Also tried it with pecans and butterscotch chips..
Very tasty....crisp outside and soft center... Lookout Keebler Elfs..Bobbie has a winner here.

These cookies are awesome!!!  Easy to make, the batch yields a lot of cookies, and they turned out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside (especially if you take them out just under 10 mins...).  I used chocolate chips and added 1/2 cup of coconut and they were wonderful.

Very good cookies.  My husband never likes anything and he asked me where I bought them!  That sealed the deal for me. I did however, eliminate the nuts (not a nut fan) and used raisins in place of chocolate chips.

Another great and very yummy variation is to make them with glace cherries, dried apricot and flaked almonds.  these are very popular with people who are not chocoholics!  However one cup of butter does seem like a lot of fat.

I made these with my children and they loved them. We added M & M's and nuts and they thought that they were great to take to school for a snack.

Loved these cookies.  I did make changes:
1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup granulated sugar, 1/2 cup coconut sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract (was a happy accident)
1/2 cup pecans, 1/2 cup dark chocolate pieces, 1/2 cup dried cherries, 1/2 cup craisins
1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon cardamom, a pinch of pumpkin spice (I may add more spices next time, perhaps increased by 1/2 teaspoon)
 candied ginger, cut to small pieces (I only had enough for my last four cookies...so I´d estimate 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup depending on taste)
I used the full 3 cups oats - no over-drying happened in my batch, perhaps to due my alterations that added moisture to the recipe, such as the coconut sugar.
  
With the addition of spices, I don´t think that the chocolate is actually needed.  This is coming from a chocoholic.

I used a scoop to measure them out onto parchment covered cookie sheets. My scoop is a medium scoop: 5cm (approx 2TBS). Baked in a convection oven (conversion is 325 degrees).  Cooked exactly 10 minutes, let them sit on the cookie sheet on top of a cooling rack for another 5 before moving the cookies to the cooling rack. 

The result: moist, chewie, aromatic oatmeal cookies.

I really liked these cookies. I tweaked it slightly by using only 3/4 brown sugar and I used dark chocolate. Nevertheless, the texture was great and the cookies were not too sweet.

Wow!!!  I was looking to finish off some ingredients in the pantry and make goodies for a teacher appreciation- this recipe was perfect!  I did 2 1/2 cups oats because some of the reviews said the amount of oats made the cookies dry.  My cookies were moist and buttery, so 2 1/2 oats worked!  I also used dark chocolate morsals... cause that is what I had.  And I upped the amount of pecans to finish off the bag.  The cookies came together easily, didn't mess up too many dishes; and tasted fantastic!!!  I baked them for 8 minutes and they were perfect.  Thank you!!!!

Great recipe! I kept to the same ingredients, but having read and seen pictures of results too flat attributed to greasing the pan, I decided to put parchment in. On my first two cookie sheets (in a convection oven) I thought they came out just right (crisp on edges, chewy on inside) but my wife wanted them a bit more done, so on pan three, I went to 13 minutes cook time. Turned out great as well. Not over cooked at all.

These were great! It isn’t necessary to chill the dough, and the cookies come out nice and plump, no flat cookies here!
The flavor is really nice and you could add some spices if you wanted to change it up a bit. Generous amount made, too. Oh! I left out the raisins, I don’t like them with chocolate chips.

I followed the exact recipe and the cookies were wonderful.  It made 60 good size cookies--not 36, but I'm not complaining.  I will use this recipe for oatmeal cookies from now on.

I loved it!
I swapped out --
- oats for gluten-free oats
- the flour for gluten-free flour
- the butter for 1/2 olive oil and maybe 2/3 applesauce because I deleted the chocolate (didn't have), raisins (hubby doesn't like) and the nuts (I love but allergic).
- and I baked it in a pan, so it came out more like something between a brownie and a muffin.
Great for dessert with decaf coffee in the evening or with breakfast. We are in the process of moving, so a fun way to get the daily fiber in...
So moist! My husband loved it too! :-D

Pretty pleased with how these came out. I did not add berries and chocolate chips, added a smattering of walnuts and reduced the oats by about 15 %. Did i 'make it'? Why not close enough.

I've made these 4 times now.  I change up the nuts and raisins but keep proportions the same.  I cut the white sugar 1/4 cup because I don't like very sweet cookies and they are plenty sweet enough for us.  I find they need 12-13 minutes in my oven- I pull them when I start to see the edges browning even though they may not look done- these cookies are great!  They don't get hard and crunchy after being stored like others I've tried- they stay firm but plenty soft enough- not chewy- but firm. Perfect cookies for my family! Thanks!

I left out the raisons. Only because I am not a fan of raisons. They were so easy to make and they taste great.

These are some of the best cookies I've made, just remember to check them at 8 minutes.  I've also used walnuts instead of pecans and they're also very good!

These cookies are delicious! I made them with butterscotch chips and without nuts. My family loved them! The recipe makes a nice big batch, so lasted a while for my family of four :)

This is my husband's favorite cookie. I have made it many, many times. I now make a couple of small changes: I add 1 tsp cinnamon, 2tsp vanilla ( instead of 1), and, most importantly, I toast the pecans. I never add chocolate chips ( husband does not like chocolate). All of these changes are personal preference. This is a great cookie! Update: still a wonderful cookie, still my husbands favorite. I make it so often I sometimes make changes. I have found I prefer 2 1/2 cups oats instead of three. Also, a tablespoon of vanilla.  Yesterday I added about 1/4 cup coconut. Ok, probably wouldn’t do it again, or would add more, but the amount I added did nothing.  Next time I am going to try all pecans, no raisins.

These oatmeal cookies are great.  I don't put in the chocolate chips or the nuts because I am allergic but the cookies don't need them.  These are better than the cookies we made as kids.

These or awesome. I made only half the recipe and followed everything according to the recipe except that I didn't add pecans because I don't like nuts and I used m&ms instead of chocolate chips. I filled other reviewers' advice and didn't grease the pan to avoid the cookies going flat but they still did, sorta. Please take them out in the time suggested by the recipe, they're done, trust me. I've never creamed butter and sugar before so I wasn't sure if I did it right but everything turned out great. These won't last long at my house.

I used golden raisins, as they are the ones I had on hand and are preferred in mouse house. These cookies turned out great, even I like them and I hate oatmeal raisin cookies. These will now be a regular during cookie season.

I've made this recipe a few times and the cookies always turn out great. I was wondering if anyone has ever tried making the dough in advance and freezing it. Will freezing affect the quality of these cookies?

These cookies were excellent. I did add a extra chocolate chips. Next time I would add 1 cup each of raisins, chocolate chips and pecans. The batter was thick so I made it into balls and flattened them slightly with my palm.

Omg. What a wonderful Oatmeal Cookie recipe. I substituted  non-hydrogenated margarine for the butter since I had no butter on hand and I opted out of the nuts since I wasn't in the mood for nuts today. This recipe is a  keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I made these for my boyfriend and we both loved the result! My oven runs hot, so I baked my batches for 9 and 8 minutes (first and second batch respectively). The first batch is still nice and chewy (not hard, except for the bottom), and the second batch is softer. Both batches have a nice light brown underside, which is how I determined if they were done. I varied the recipe slightly,  omitting the raisins, switching pecans for walnuts, adding white chocolate chips and chunks, and using 1 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar. I agree with other reviewers that this recipe is flexible; I'd like to try it with orange essence and dark chocolate, macadamia nuts and white chocolate, craisins and walnuts, and different spices. Of course it depends on cookie size, but I ended up with 48 cookies, not 36 like the recipe estimates.

Delicious cookies!  We double the pecans, omit the chocolate chips and use a medium size cookie scoop to make all the cookies about the same size.   This size of cookie required 12 minutes in our oven.  We use non stick pans and do not need to grease them.   We let the cookies cool 5 minutes on pan before moving to rack just like the recipe calls for.  Great instructions for the perfect cookie.  Thank you!

I loved the taste! I added a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and only added craisens to my batch. They turned out way too soft though. Can hardly pick them up without them falling apart. Hmmm, maybe I'll find out way and try it again (=

This is my first review after COUNTLESS allrecipes recipes over the years.  I've made a lot of oatmeal cookies but his IS THE BEST.  

I thought I ruined the recipe after discovering I only had about 1/4 c. of brown sugar left in the house.  I went with it and they were SO GOOD.  The cookies were plenty sweet..in fact, tasted much better, softer and chewier than any oatmeal cookie i've ever made.  I also used WHITE, whole wheat flour. No raisins or nuts in our cookies but I did add choc chips because that's what we like.  Moral of the story, if you cut the sugar in half, you probably won't notice it's missing!  That's a good thing!

I have to say this is the best recipe for oatmeal cookies! The cookie base is perfect and you can do whatever you want to it. She called for 3 cups oatmeal and I changed it up to 2 cups oatmeal, 1 cup coconut. My first batch I left out the chocolate chips, todays batch I added them. The family loves them. This is one recipe for the books and it's a keeper! Thank you SO much! Cheers to back to school lunches!

I made this recipe two ways: regular and gluten free. I substituted craisins and coconut for the raisins and cut the sugar a bit. The gluten-free ones were a hit with everyone; chewy and flattened just the right amount. The regular ones did not spread and were too crunchy. I must have overbaked them I guess. I will try them again and pull them out of the oven even if they look undercooked. A good base for cookies. Thanks.

The first time making this at the daycare I left it basic with no raisins added. This is the first oatmeal cookie ALL the kids will eat!  Next time I'll add things. It's great.

These are by far the best oatmeal cookies I've made from scratch! I've made them several times. With raisins, with dried cranberries & white chocolate chips, and tonight I made them with a mix of white choc. Chips,milk choc. And semisweet choc. chips, chopped pecans, sweetened shredded coconut and dried cranberries. I call them Loaded Oatmeal Cookies. But the real secret is this oatmeal cookie recipe base. You can use any mixins and make them to your liking. One tip: I lightly spray the cookie sheet to prepare, and then I take a napkin to evenly spread it all around the entire sheet. It makes the coating even lighter so the cookies don't go too flat as they bake. I've made these with both the small scoop and the medium size scoop by Pampered Chef. With the medium scoop I slightly flatten the dough balls so they cook more evenly, and with the smaller scoop. They turn out just fine the way they are.

The first time I try a recipe - I go exactly to the recipe. How else can you rate it?? Never got that part. So, it was really good. Many compliments. I did think it was a bit on the sweet side and could use a reduction in the sugars. Maybe will try the cinnamon like other have posted next time. All i all - Great recipe and a keeper! Thank you.

Not happy with the bland flavor and they are dry.  Could be me but I think a little cinnamon and/or cloves would be better.  Also, I doubled the recipe and it was more than my mixer could handle - the batter was so dry that I added two more eggs.  Perhaps the recipe called for large or bigger than my medium eggs, which causes me to wonder about it being "kitchen tested" - am I the only one who uses medium eggs.  Anyway, lesson learned: never double a new, untried cookie recipe.

these cookies tasted very good,but while quite moist they were very crumbly, they were really no good for serving as they fell apart. The ones I baked a few minutes longer were better,but still very crumbly,I will not use this recipe again.

I really liked the flavor of these cookies... I added a lil extra though. I diced up 2 small green apples and added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. They tasted great but the texture was a little more cake like than I wanted. But overall, Great, with endless possibilities as well.

These cookies are wonderful.  The flavor is great and the dough is quick to put together.  I do not like raisins and used cranberries instead, as well as added cinnamon as suggested by others. So good!

My husband LOVES oatmeal cookies so this recipe was a hit for him.  I am docking it a star because I didn't have enough oatmeal on hand (only about 1 1/2 cups) so that is all I used.  I think anything more than that would have made the cookies too dry.  I also omitted the raisins and pecans and used the same amount in chocolate chips instead.

I've now made these twice. They came out to Perfection both times. I did make variations, but the core ingredients are what make this a 5 star cookie. They came out perfectly soft and chewy in the center, light golden brown on the bottoms. I did have to cook about 12-13 minutes, not 8-10 as recipe states, they would have been underdone.
here were my variations-
added: COCONUT 1 cup(OMG too good), about tablespoon each of ALLSPICE and CINNIMON. 
Eliminated: nuts. 
For SURE this is my go to recipe for oatmeal cookies- and will keep trying more variations!

Quite possibly the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had. As previously written this is a fantastic base reci[e where you can add or delete as you please! I was out of brown sugar, so used 1 1/2 cups of white.  I used 1 1/2 cups of flour instead of 2, and added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 cup coconut, increased the raisins to 1 and 1/2 cups, and omitted the chocolate chips and pecans.

This is my first review as a member of Allrecipes. I made 1/2 this recipe today and they came out great! I cut down a little on the sugars and the oats, added Craisins (didn't have raisins) and cooled the cookie sheet ahead of time so they wouldn't spread...all great tips from prior reviewers. They sat high on the baking sheet, so I flattened them slightly with a fork. I baked 20 good sized cookies and refrigerated enough dough for about another 8! This will be my standard oatmeal cookie from now on. Thanks Bobbie!

I tried this recipe for the first time and everyone loved them. I did substitute the raisins for cranberries and added a bit more pecans. Very easy to make and most of the ingredients were already in my pantry. I will definitely be trying this recipe again and soon!

These are really good! I added 1 t cinnamon as some suggested. Cooking time was 10 minutes even though they did not looked done. Leave them on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes to cool and they will be perfect. Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't have the nuts, raisins or chocolate chips, but these were still really good.  I made huge cookies, so they came out a bit more like a mini cake instead of a big cookie, but still delicious, especially the next day.

Best oatmeal cookies ever! I left out the chocolate chips cause I fugured they'd be sweet enough. A home run! You would not mind if your kids on the go had a couple for breakfast. Better than processed food and although the sugar is high the natural ingredients balance that well.

I had made oatmeal cookies from the Oatmeal box but never found them not having much of a taste.  I try this recipe today and found that these were the best oatmeal cookies so far.  Instead of the chocolate chips I had use the small hershey's chocolate candy with almonds and had cut them into smaller sizes and also added pecans and one tsp of cinnamon.  These turn out fantastic!

I think it was my fault, but they turned out all lumpy.  They tasted fine, maybe a little gluey.

A little less flour and only 2 cups of oats, swap raisins for craisins and voila! Absolutely delicious, soft cookies :)

This is one of the best oatmeal cookies I've tried.  I added peanut butter and chocolate chips and omitted the nuts and raisins.  My husband said they were good and he is quite the cookie critic.  I'll definately be adding this one to my favorite cookie list.

Wow!  These cookies are easy and delicious, and I never have luck with baking!  As it were, I forgot the oats in my first batch, and wondered why they weren't firming up, when my roommate pointed out that they didn't LOOK like oatmeal cookies...LOL  In addition, I noticed the oven was at 250!!!  Despite these minor setbacks, after adding the oats and upping the oven temp, the cookies came out beautifully and were gobbled up in no time.  This recipe is a keeper!

I keep trying oatmeal cookie recipes to find one that's easy and good.  This is it!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, just added a pinch of cinnamon.  Very good, very easy.  My husband loved them, too.

Lovely recipe! I doubled it, cut down a bit on the sugar, added ground cloves and cinnamon, and omitted the chocolate and pecans. The result was an absolute mountain of chewy, spicy oatmeal raisin cookies with a toasted oatmeal flavor. Very nice! Would be excellent for a bake sale when doubled-- I got about 8 dozen!

This recipe is very basic.  There is no surprise ingredients.  It makes a cakey type cookie that is very good.  Mine did not come out chewy at all but were still good and the kids love them.

Absolutely wonderful!!!!  I had almost given up on making oatmeal cookies, as the recipes in the past that I tried were too bland.  This is my new oatmeal cookie recipe.  My daughter helped me make these, and she used the tablespoon instead of the teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.  They were yummy this way, too.  Thank you again for a wonderful recipe!

I used 1/2c butter and 1/2c Crisco.  Also, instead of 1c raisins, I added 1/2c raisins, 1/2c craisins and 1/2c chopped dates.  Finally, I added about 1/4 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Made these this afternoon. Quick, delicious, easy... I love it! I decreased the amounts of each sugar by a little and they turned out fine. Also didn't have any vanilla on hand so I added a tsp of water to accomodate for the moisture.

The cookies were great.  I don't like my cookies overly sweet so I reduced the brown sugar and white sugar each by about 1/4 cup.  I baked it for 12 minutes to get a slight golden brown to it to make it a tad crunchy when you first bite on it but the inside remains chewy.  Yum!

Won't try this one again.
The dough is way too crumbly to make nice shaped cookies.  They fell apart when I scooped them onto the cookie sheet. I put in only 2 1/2 c. of oats and that is probably too much.
Flavor was just O.K. I'll stick with my other oatmeal recipe.

I decided to try a homemade recipe instead of the store bought
bagged kinds.I wanted to try this one after reading the reviews and ratings.My boyfriend LOVES oatmeal chocolate chip cookies- and he just died over these ones!I didn't add the raisins, but I did however add EXTRA chocolate chips.I also think 3 full tablespoons more of vanilla made a difference!I recommend turning off the oven about 7 mins after you put in your cookies-then leave them in the heat for another 3 mins - then take them out.I really don't have a reason for why i do that other than they turn out really really good! oh, and ENJOY!!   :-) mmmmm....

These were excellent - soft and chewy.  I used Splenda sugar substitute and I refrigerated my dough before baking, and they held their shape very well. I also baked mine for a few more minutes than stated, but it was probably the size of the cookie I made.  Thanks for sharing, Shannon.

If you like a sweeter cookie, this is a great recipe. My kids LOVED them!  I added one tablespoon cinnamon and one tablespoon applebutter.
I also increased the cooking time a few minutes.

After reading all the great reviews about these cookies I couldn’t wait to taste them.  Boy was I disappointed.  After following the recipe exactly I found them to be tasteless.  I think something needs to be added but not really sure what.  Maybe cinnamon?

Fantastic recipe!  Finally, an oatmeal cookie that's not loaded with cinnamon!  I skipped the nuts and chocolate and raisins, just added butterscotch chips.  YUM!  Also, I did not grease the cookie sheets, and they were just fine.  Baking time took a little longer, though; it was more like 12 minutes per sheet of 12 cookies.  Anyway, altogether a fantastic recipe!

Awesome cookies!  I left out the raisins and pecans and added butterscotch chips instead of chocolate chips.  They'd be good toffee bits, too!  Definitely a keeper!  Try this!

These cookies are perfect!!  They spread enough to make nice circle cookies, but still had a nice thickness about them.  Loved the texture of these, too!! We don't like raisins, so I don't keep the around the house, so I double the chocolate chips to make up for the lack of raisins.  I love these, and will be making these on a regular basis from now on!!! Thanks for posting this recipe!!

I added a tsp of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg and I used walnuts instead of pecans. The cookies were awesome! They had a wonderful texture. Kids ate 'em up!

I didn't like these and will not make again.  I felt like they became stale very quickly and didn't have a lot of flavor.  I will continue my search for the best oatmeal cookie.

Not at all impressed. Stuck to pan. Didn't cook well and the taste could definetly be improved. Way to much sugar. I will go back to my old sourdough standby. Just wanted to try something different.

These were delicious but I thought a little sweet for my liking.  I think next time I will cut the white sugar back to about 1/2 cup.  Because I already have a few similar recipes combining oats with choc. chips., I used cinnamon chips and really liked the combination.  I may increase those a little next time.  I used a mini ice cream scoop to make the job easier and got nearly 6 dozen cookies.  Thanks, Shannon!

Awesome cookies!
I used spelt flour, added some cinnamon, substituted walnuts for pecans, and used organic dark chocolate chips.
I'll never eat anything else again!

Absolutely delicious, no need to ever look for another oatmeal cookie recipe.  I used chocolate chips and coconut, but they would be equally delicious, if not better, with raisins.

I made these cookies the other night, very,very good they came out chewy & soft. They were easy to make. I omitted the nuts and just used oatmeal & chocolate chips. Everyone seemed to like them. I will use this recipe again.

These cookies are really good! I made them with just the raisins, and left the pecans and chocolate out.  The cookies came out chewy and flavorful.  I used a cookie scoop and was able to make 4 dozen instead of 3, and they were still a good sized cookie.

This recipe was okay. It satisfied my want for an oameal cookie. It was very sweet and chewy. To my surprise, they came out thin and lacy, and very delicate if you underbake a bit for chewy cookies. They were okay, and one family member really liked them, the rest said they were okay. I did like the combination of raisins and choclolate chips with the caramely-ness of the cookie.

SO VERY YUMMY!!!!! I cooked them 12 minutes and made smaller sized cookies. I enjoyed these most the next day (for breakfast with my coffee, lol) When they were completely cooled. I loved the choc chips but next time I'm gonna make it without the chips.

I thought these cookies were tasty and easy to make. I was short on time so I cut the recipe in half and it still made plenty! My kids aren't crazy about raisins so I omitted them too and they were very good. Thanks!

This recipe was eay to make and turned out perfectly.  I used only raisins, but they were still awesome.  I took some to work and have gotten rave reviews so far.  This is a keeper!

These cookies are GREAT!!!  I'll have to hide them if I want some for the weekend.  I used a bag of chocolate chips, no raisins or nuts, and they are still wonderful.

The cookie dough was very dry and hard to work with.  The finished product didn't really turn out that horribly, however,  Not the best I've had...

Excellent cookies!!!  My friend and I made these and they came out awesome!!!  This is the 5th day since we made them, and they're still soft and chewy (the only reason it lasted that long is because we made a few batches of different cookies, so we had lots of goodies!!!)  And so yummy too!!!  Thanks Shannon!!!

YUMMY COOKIES!!! My daughter doesn't care for raisins, so I omitted them and doubled the chocolate chips. Also, substituted walnuts for the pecans and also doubled the amount of nuts. Excellent recipe! My teen daughter loved them. Will definitely make again and again. Thanks for sharing the recipe :-)

These are very yummy!  They are very soft and chewy & the chocolate/raisin/pecan
combination is wonderful!  My hubby was very pleased with this recipe.  We used 
milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.

Outstanding.  These cookies were moist, chewy and delicious.  I only had 1 egg, so I halved the recipe & it still made 29 cookies.  I omitted the raisins, but kept the chocolate chips.  I will definately make these again.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Very yummy and I don't like oatmeal cookies or raisins that much.  They did seem to take a little longer in the oven then the recipe said. (i did omit the nuts and added 1/2 t of cinnamon.)  I will definately make again.  Thanks!
