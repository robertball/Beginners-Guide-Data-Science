This was perfect! Especially with the feta cheese mashed potatoes on this website. I must still be a novice cook since I couldn't get my "pesto" to puree but the crumb mixture that I ended up with still was perfect on top of the lamb!

Yum! Great flavors! We used bone-in lamb steaks. They were a little tough so next time we will do lamb chops. We loved the crust! It was super easy and very tasty!

I followed the recipe exactly as the chef said to and it turned out AMAZING! My boyfriend mother and father loved it! I also made homemade gnocchi (with a vodka cream sauce) to eat on the side- delicious meal! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Best steak I have ever tasted. I did it with beef instead of lamb and it turned out great. One suggestion is to reduce the garlic and increase the rosemary it will give it more flare.

Family favorite. I can never seem to get the crust to stay on but it is still fantastic.

Fantastic! My lamb steaks were thin so the 10-15 min frying time worked well. For something thicker I think they'd need a bit more cook time. The rosemary seasoning is a perfect compliment to the lamb.I would make this again.

This was fantastic! I did 3.5 mins on each side for a 1" steak and it came out a beautiful medium rare. The only change I made was I didn't have parsley so I substituted dried thyme. Next time I'll try basil from my garden.

I tried it with steak but I wish that I had lamb. I used homemade pesto that was frozen in my fridge and it still tasted delicious! I used the leftovers the next day for a heady beef-gouda-tomato on baguette lunch.

I really enjoyed this playful dish. It was fun to cook and tasteful to eat. I bought a new knife for this recipe to make sure I was able to chop all the spices very fine. My only change I made was to hand chop and mix the pesto. It really gave the pesto variance in flavors. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Just finished making this i had to review it right away! Instead of lamb i used a nice beef strip-loin & EVERYONE was amazed at the taste. This was my first time ever making steak! I added a little more rosemary than it called for because it tastes amazing! It was super quick to make too... will definitely make it again!

I am guilty I changed the recipe but it still was GREAT! Really wanted to grill some beef strip steaks so I left out the bread crumbs and made a seasoned butter-pesto which I put on top of the grilled steaks. I figured if I tried to grill with the crust on it I wouldn't have a deck left. Can't wait to try it with lamb sometime soon too and I'll try it then the way it was written. Thank you!

Makes a very nice crust. I cooked it in the oven on 425 degrees (convection)for 15 minutes to avoid losing the crust and it was perfect. Meat was medium-rare and the crust had a slight crispiness. There's a lot of pesto for 2 steaks though I found the crust to be a bit thick for my taste.

Yummy! I sliced a lamb shoulder roast and added fresh basil\mint\thyme\rosemary. All sounded like a great compliment to lamb and I was right. Definitely making this again and again... XD

Worked perfectly. The lamb was tender and delicious. I used bacon fat instead of oil.

I gave it 4 stars for flavor but I used lamb steaks that were about 1 1/4" thick and the cooking times didn't work for them. I had to cook for at least 8-9 mins per side to get it to 72 deg. C (medium). Loved the pesto flavors with the lamb! I may try to broil them next time to brown the pesto side then bake them to keep the grease splatter and the smoking pan to a minimum. Otherwise delicious! The pesto is enough for at least 4 steaks and they're so good I would have loved to have eaten another one.

I'm giving this recipe three stars, not because the recipe was bad, but something's wrong. Everything worked right up to putting the meat in the pan. I think I had the temperature too high, so the pesto coating burned. Not all was lost. I was able to salvage some of the coating and placed it on my meat as a kind of dip for it so I got to taste what it would have tasted like if it hadn't burned the topping. It tasted good, I just wish I did a better job on the cooking.

I liked the crust but personally I think the lamb should have been lightly seasoned with salt and pepper prior to applying the breading mix. I will definitely try this again with the changes mentioned.

I ended up using dried herbs as nothing fresh was available. I had a 3/4 lb bone in lamb steak which I cut the bone out of and made two 3 oz steaks. Worked like a charm. Was tasty and easy to make.
