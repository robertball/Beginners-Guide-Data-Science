squeeze the potatoes, because my crust was actually very mushy.  Also, use the potatoes right away before they turn grey.

This is a delicious dish! It's something unique and different. However, it won't satisfy your craving for pizza. It will still taste healty and flavorful though.

This was a pretty good recipe!  I don't have all the topping ingredients, so I made it an all-around potato pizza. The shredding of the potatoes and onion were very time-consuming.  I squeezed them dry with paper towels.  I must have used fairly large potatoes, because I ended up using 3 eggs and a full cup of flour to make it all stick together.  Not owning any round pans, I made it on a regular cookie sheet with sides. I sauced it half with pesto (ran out) and half with pasta sauce.  Toppings included 4 sm/med sliced potatoes, two chopped sausages, mixed sliced bell peppers, and chopped onions, covered with mozzerella cheese.

Great recipe. Sauce is a little bland. Next time I will add more spices.  Other than that it's perfect. My husband ate it and he hates tofu!

This rating is for the crust. My husband hates veggies and thinks tofu is evil, so I used other toppings, but the crust was great.

Very, very, very good and easily made vegan.  However, I found that the amount of crust I had was not proportional to the rest of the recipe and had to add more than twice the suggested amount of pizza sauce and toppings.

I would make this again because it was a fun way have pizza without the bread...next time I would do the following:
1.  Salt the vegetables or the top of the pizza...lacked in flavour.
2.  You MUST squeeze out the water from the potatoes as it did not get crispy at all.

Very good.  Don't be afraid of tofu!  Just wrap it in a paper towel and put it under a flat, heavy object (like a cookbook on a pan) for a little while.  Then, I sliced mine into squares, about 1/4 inch thick.  Finally, I sauteed them by themselves in a little olive oil until they were nice and golden.  Then I added mushrooms, banana peppers, zuccini, and onion.  Next time I might add paste to the sauce, so the crust is criper.  Delicious!

This was so easy to make and everyone loved it. I did squeeze the extra water out of the potatoes. The crust turned out very crisp. Not soggy at all. I did not put any tomato suace on the top. I layered everything like a pizzia. Will make again!

This was a nice change from traditional pizza :) I really enjoyed the tofu. I used more sauce as well and had no problems with the potato not being crispy enough. I used some different toppings as well only for lack of having all the ingredients listed.

eh...I probably won't make this again.  It was a lot of work to shred potatoes and onions and wait on it to bake and bake it four different times before serving.  It was a decent potato casserole.

Not what I would really call pizza.  The crust wasn't crispy, and overall, I'd say it was a bit bland.  It was also a lot of work.  I'll probably still try it again, with some modifications.

Very unappealing and tasteless.  I will not make this again.
