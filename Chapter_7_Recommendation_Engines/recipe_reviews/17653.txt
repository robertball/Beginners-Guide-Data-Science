This is an excellent cake recipe that makes moist, delicious muffins.  I substituted 1 cup of Splenda Granular for 1 cup of the sugar, and I replaced 1 cup of the oil with 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  I got 18 large muffins out of this recipe, and the crumb is so moist, you won't miss the frosting!

I made this for my daughter's birthday.  It was moist and really good.  I used an Italian Cream Cheese Frosting recipe that I have been using for a long time.  I will make it again.

This cake is moist and delicious.  One little change:  I used 1 cup of oil and 1/2 cup orange juice instead of the 1 1/2 cup oil.  Also used chocolate fudge icing.  But it's good enough to serve w/o frosting.  Everyone loved the cake and wanted recipe.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  I used the full can of crushed pineapple (364ml).  And I took the advice of others here and used 1 cup if oil and 1/2 cup of orange juice. I also used a tube pan.  Excellent recipe.

My husband wanted chocolate carrot cake for his birthday but as we are in the process of moving, I couldn't find my cook book with the recipe.  This was pretty close to what I used, but not quite the same. I didn't have enough oil for the recipe and the amount indicated seemed like a ton so I substituted half for applesauce. I had just recently watched a cooking show where the pastry chef recommended mixing cake batter with a whisk instead of an automatic mixer. She said the mixer made the batter tough. I tried the whisk and it was easy and really did seem to improve the batter. It turned out really really good. Moist with a fantastic consistency. Excellent recipe!

This was AWESOME!  The pineapple keeps it VERY moist, maybe a little too much so.  Next time I will THOUROUGHLY drain and dry the pineapple before incorporating into the recipe.  Other than that, this was a great scratch recipe.  Rich, chocolatey and dense.  YUMMY!

My girlfriend gave this recipe to me a few years ago and it is the best I've ever had.  I like to make four layers with the cake so you get a bit of icing in every bite.

I really liked this recipe.  I did use 1/2 orange juice (sub for oil).  I really couldn't taste any carrots at all.  Maybe I grated them too fine.  I will make this again.  My mom loves carrot cake for her birthdays.

I accidently goofed and put in the whole can of pineapple and juice. And, I had already subbed applesauce for half of the oil. It was too wet, but totally my fault. Still had great flavor. Next time I make, I would prefer more texture....like nuts or raisins.

Chocolate Carrot Cake - never heard of such a thing.  I think we've been missing out on something pretty wonderful.  I came across this recipe trying to use up a bunch of carrots.  Was quite surprised to see it used unsweetened cocoa powder and crushed pineapple.  This cake is very moist with a nice light chocolate flavor.  I decided to add the chopped nuts to the cake rather than the frosting.  I made the frosting minus the coconut as some of my family members don't care for it.  This is a wonderful cake and most certainly will be made again in this house.

all three of us (bf, his daughter, and myself) thought this was very good.. unfortunately didn't have the pineapple and didn't feel like going to the store so left that out.. realized i didn't have any baking soda so used three times the amount of baking powder and it came out just fine.. bf's daughter said she felt this stood on it's own without any frosting.. we made muffins/cupcakes.. ty for the recipe

Yum! Very moist, not overly sweet, truly perfect! I followed recommendations and used 1 c. oil and 1/2 c. orange juice. Didn't have crushed pineapple so used drained pieces that I crushed in the food processor. The only changes I would make would be to use parchment in the pans (stuck even though they were thoroughly greased and floured) and to make extra frosting so there would be a nice thick layer of frosting between the layers. We will definitely make this again!

This chocolate version was an great change-up for the usual carrot cake recipes. The only thing I changed was the batter's sugar amount-instead of 2c. of sugar, I used 1 1/2 c. of sugar and 2 packets of stevia. It turned out well without being overly sweet. I will defintely serve this again.

I added a tablespoon of cinnamon and added a cup of walnuts. Deliscious . I made a chocolate cream cheese icing and made it in a bunt pan. It was a hit.

I did replace half the oil with unsweetened applesauce, cut 1/2 c of sugar and added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg...but this was still the best carrot cake I ever ate, even with the minor attempt to cut fat and sugar. Thank you Lynn for a new family favorite.

I made this as a birthday cake for a family friends child who does not eat vegetables. He loved it! It is very moist, so I would suggest being very careful when flipping the cake out of its pan.
