Made as written and these are really good. My only complaint is in the onions. They didn't get near cooked but cooking them longer would have gotten the peppers overcooked. I recommend cooking them a few minutes by themselves prior to adding the peppers. Overall good recipe and one I would make again.

These were very tasty and although we didn't use monterey jack cheese, there was still tons of flavor to go around! I like my food spicy so I heaped in some extra seasonings. This recipe taught me that swai is a versatile and tasty fish, and I keep finding it for a steal at my local store so I'm happy to add this to my rotation of midweek dinners! Thank you!
