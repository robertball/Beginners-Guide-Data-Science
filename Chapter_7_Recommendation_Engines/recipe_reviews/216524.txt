Let me start out by saying this:  We rarely eat beef at our house, maybe 6 times a year tops.  This recipe was so delicious, my husband ranked it as one if the best things I've ever made AND he was looking for more when we were finished!  I made it exactly as written, with the exception of discarding the veggies and cherries after taking the ribs out of the oven.  When you work hard at it, why throw away the delicious flavor from those ingredients?  Just pick out the bay leaves and herb stems, and serve with the ribs.  Divine!  Worthy of company, worthy of family dinner, and worthy of a 10 star review. Thanks so much for a delicious dinner!

This recipe took some time but it was WELL worth it.  I made it exactly how it was written and I'm so glad I did.  Great tasting, tender, the gravy was awesome on potatos.  LOVED it!

Excellent recipe. I substituted 1 (24) oz jar of Trader Joes dark Morello cherries in light syrup for frozen cherries and cherry soda with superb results.

I cooked this a day ahead and skimmed the fat off the sauce before reheating. It would make an excellent dish during the holidays when you want to have as much as possible prepared in advance. Serve with yams, green beans, rosemary bread and a Pinot Noir wine. 

Enjoy!

Very good!! Will make again.

I used 2 cans cherries, then used juice from the can in addition to the wine in deglazing. I used my pancake griddle to brown everything--best way to do it, everything is spread apart so it doesn't lose juice, only nicely brown. I really browned the veg to give flavor to the stew, used  no fennel, can't stand the stuff! I dbld the bay, and used beef consomme instead of demiglace. Also used beef broth instead of chicken, not sure why you would use chicken in this dish. 2.5-3h was more than enough, the meat was way over done at 4h.

I found some discounted short ribs at my favorite supermarket and was looking for a recipe that didn't involve tomatoes.  This was fabulous!  I followed the advise of another reviewer and used a jar of Trader Joe's morello cherries with their juice instead of the cherry cola and frozen cherries.  I also left out the rosemary (I can't stand it) and the fennel.  Also beef demi-glace is very difficult to find and when one does find it, it is very expensive.  I just used a can of beef consume which I reduced and that seemed to work fine.  I couldn't bring myself to discard the vegetable and cherry solids.  Why spend the money on the cherries just to throw them away?  So I served them on the side.  This was an incredible dish and my husband and I finished every scrap.  Thank you for the recipe, foodlover83!

This was delicious and the meat was melt in your mouth tender. I made my own demi-glace (much cheaper than buying the stuff) by using a can of beef consomme and a tbsp of butter. I boiled it until it was reduced to about 1/4 cup. Then I mixed 1/2 tsp corn starch with a tbsp of water and added it the reduced consomme and cooked until thickened. I also had to used a can of pitted tart cherries - as they were out of frozen at the store. I did not use rosemary or fennel because I don't like them. I used a Pinot Noir. No reason to spend a bunch of money on Burgundy wine, but spend enough so you want to drink what is leftover :)After browning the first 1/2 of the ribs, it wasn't necessary to add more oil to brown the other 1/2. I also used the fat that remained in the pan to saute the veges. I gave this recipe 4 stars because it only took 2.5 hours. They would have been overcooked had I left them for the 3.5-4 hours as suggested in the recipe. Also, there was just way too much liquid imo. Next time I am going to reduce the chicken broth by 1/2 and see how that turns out.

I made this yesterday for company (I called them my guinea pigs).  I did not have a dutch oven or a cast iron pot and wasn't going out to buy one...so I USED THE CROCKPOT!!  First I browned the ribs on each side, then sauted the onions, carrots and fennel (Only used 1/2 the fennel bc I was scared) and I omitted the celery only bc I didn't have it, and added all the liquid ingredients (I used beef broth and not chicken) and the cherries, which were sweet cherries, not tart, frozen bag from Publix.  I did not use demi-glace bc I didn't know what the hek it was, and I sure wasn't going to buy it only for 2.5 tablespoons.  Then I threw everything in crockpot, along w/ the rosemary, thyme and basil.  Cooked on high for 1 hour and then low for 7 hours.  Then I made rue w/ the leftover juice in crockpot bc w/ the crockpot I felt the liquid was too thin.  I took 1/2 stick of butter and melted it in saucepan and added wondra flour and whisked then I added a ladle at a time of the liquid from crockpot and kept whisking until I got the consistency I wanted.  Added salt and pepper and then served over the ribs.  IT WAS ABSOULUTE FREAKING AMAZING!!!  I made 3 lbs of short ribs for 4 people and there was none left over!  Two of the guys eating w/ us were huge eaters.  Everyone LOVED LOVED LOVED!!!   THIS IS ACTUALLY A 10-STAR DINNER!

I made these for my boyfriend's birthday and they were AMAZING.  The house smelled insane while I was preparing them - I felt like a chef.  That being said, I couldn't really detect the cherry-based ingredients in the finished product.  Just savory and delectable gourmet short ribs.  I think next time I will decrease some of the chicken stock and add the juice from the cherries instead (recipe didn't say to add it and by the time I added the cherries there was already a scary amount of liquid in my French oven).  I will DEFINITELY make these again, next time for company.  I served mine with caramelized shallot smashed potatoes and a green apple-gorgonzola-walnut salad.  Thank you foodlover!!!!

Excellent recipe! I followed the recipe except for omitting the fennel ( I'm scared of it) and the rosemary. It came out a rich dark mahogany color and the taste was out of this world good. I was driving him crazy with the smell of it cooking all afternoon he kept asking when's dinner! I served it with buttered egg noodles and hubby can't wait for the leftovers. A must try if you like short ribs.

This is excellent. I made quite a few changes but I think I stayed pretty true to the intended flavor profile. Instead of wine and frozen cherries, I used some brandied cherries left over from Christmas. I browned the beef (and then the vegetables) in the beef's own fat. No need for olive oil. I have always found short ribs to be intensely rich and beefy, almost to the point of TOO beefy, so I did not add the demi-glace. Instead of chicken stock I added more cherry cola, but only about 3 cups total. I wanted the liquid to come only about 1/2 of the way up the ribs so they would braise instead of boil. The sauce needed a touch of sherry vinegar and salt and pepper to finish. I served this with lightly carmelized fennel and garlic mashed potatos.

Did not have fennel or celery, used freshly ground dried herbs, used strawberry soda.  The ribs still turned out great.  I would agree with jrbaker- the carrots and cherries were a nice flavorful side to the meat.   We served it over quinoa.

I don't usually write reviews but this was sooo good I had to. I had never made short ribs before, only ordered them in restaurants. It was easy; although a little time consuming it was worth it. All my children loved them and even my brother said VERY good (when usually "okay" is his response). There was more than enough sauce, so I saved some in the freezer and served with turkey for another meal. YUM! I'm going to make these for X-Mas this year.

These ribs are well worth the effort. Such depth of flavor. The house smelled divine when cooking. I made a cherry cola using regular cola and adding a splash of Maraschino cherry juice. The meat you could cut with a feather, the sauce magnificent. Buttered egg noodles paired nicely. Thanks Jrbaker for the recommendation.

This was so great!  I couldn't find frozen cherries so I used sour cherries in a light syrup and replaced the syrup for the cherry cola.  Doubled the recipe and cooked in a covered roasting pan with no problems.  We also served the left over veggies instead of discarding.  they're not pretty - but oh so tasty.  Thank you for an outstanding recipe!

The ribs were fall off the bone tender and tasty but a lot of time and energy, not to mention the cost.

I did not have demi glace so I used beef bone broth. I didn't have cherry cola so I used 1 can cola and 1 can cherry soda. I made them the first day, let them rest in the fridge overnight. Then next day, skimmed the fat off the top. Then brought to a boil to heat up the meat, drained the veg off, reduced the sauce by 1/2 and added another bag of frozen cherries. This recipe is a keeper. Next time, I will follow the recipe more closely and perhaps add a bit of acid before serving (drop of balsamic?)

I did it as stated except I only put about a quarter of the fennel bulb and I added a teaspoon of minced garlic with the veg. I also could only find standard cherries in the frozen foods, so that is what i used and it was fine. I did use a very fine balsamic vinegar. I made mine in a classic dutch oven and it reduced while cooking, there was no need for reducing it more. My husband and I really enjoyed it!

That was pretty darned tasty!  I don't know if it might be varying degrees of temperatures in ovens, but like some of the other reviewers, I cooked the ribs for 3 hours and they were plenty done.  This dish is also very pretty to look at!

Couldn't find frozen cherries so I used cherry pie filling and it added a hint of sweet that blended perfectly with the sour of the wine and balsamic. 
Insanely good!
One of the best tasting dishes I have ever made!

By far, hands down, the BEST short rib recipe I have ever made! The friends that ate it were in awe. All they could say was "oh my God." That good! I did not use fennel, or Burgundy wine. I substituted the Burgundy for half Marsala and half Shiraz. Mainly because I could not get ahold of Burgundy wine.  I also substituted the frozen cherries and cherry soda for two 14oz cans of pitted tart cherries in juice.  I will make this recipe for years to come!

When I find short ribs on sale I buy them..  I followed the recipe but I used the instant pot.  I braised the ribs and followed the directions.  I cooked everything for 45 minutes on high pressure and allowed a 15 natural release.  I then pulled the meat from the bones and put the meat aside.  I took the vegetables and broth and used an emulsion blender to make it a thick broth.  I mixed corn starch and some of the broth together to make a roux and added it to the rest of the thick broth.  I through it all together and served it over mashed potatoes..  Wunderbar!!!  A awesome cold weather meal.

Used the gel kind of beef stock instead of demiglace and if you make yours in a la creuset of the size I use, it will spill if you do the full amount of chicken broth. I fix this by adding only half when it says to, then the ribs and cherries as instructed, and then filling it to about 1/8th of an inch below the edge. 

I've made this recipe 3 times, it is probably my favorite thing in the world. If you can easily fish out the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme branches there is no reason to toss the vegetables, they taste just as amazing as the ribs. (I still remove and strain them to make the gravy separately, I just serve them as a side dish). LOVE this recipe.

True there are several steps but was well worth it. My family really enjoyed this- from my two year old to my picky husband. Improvised a bit based upon what I had in my pantry. Used regular coke and 1/2 c pomegranate molasses (to sub for the idea of cherries). The recipe is perfect as written though- even with fennel which I absolutely love. The only problem is I didn't make enough! I needed to figure at least two ribs per person and 3 lbs did not cover our group of 6. Next time I will make double!

Not as flavorful/savory as I was expecting Especially for the amount of time involved to prepare.  I will continue to look for another recipe.

This was delicious!  I used cherry juice and beef broth.  Left out the cherries!  And I added some garlic.  It was a hit....

I made short ribs using this recipe yesterday (2/24/13) and the dish was fantastic!  The meat was fork tender and has a fabulous taste.  I didn't follow the recipe 100% because I couldn't find some ingredients, but I followed it for the most part.  I will definitely put this recipe in my rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

Received no feedback from the dinner table on this; made as written.  the meat was very tender but i feel there was a lot of waste as far as ingredients go. I couldn't taste the fennel, therefore don't know if it is as imporant of an ingredient.  i could not find 'tart' frozen cherries. had to use regular. i couldn't get the sauce to thicken after reducing for quite a long time; had to add a little cornstarch.  i guess this just isn't for us, delicious as it was.  thanks for the post foodlover83!**edit - just had the leftovers tonight.  i have to say the sauce is very good; maybe it's just that my ribs were very, very fatty making this not as enjoyable as they could have been.**
