I'm glad I tried this!  What an interesting and different take on an omelet which, after awhile, always seem to taste the same no matter what "recipe" you choose. Because I was a little nervous about the curry powder (didn't want to take a chance of having to throw a shrimp omelet out if we didn't like it!) I decided to be a wimp and use only half the amount of curry called for.  I'm glad I did.  It gave it a pleasant nuance of flavor and aroma, but any more and I know it would have been too much for us.  The recipe came together perfectly with the prep and cooking method as described.

Wow, what a nice surprise..  Nice taste, interesting texture!  I changed the recipe a little...  After the eggs has setup, I put the vegetables in including the tomatoes but not the cheese.  I put it in the oven @ 400 (frying pan) for about 20 minutes.  Then I put the cheese on top and broiled it for about 5 minutes.  Finished up like a caserole.  Yum Yum.

Delicious! I only used two eggs--single serving--and made ALL the filling with extra shrimp and a handful of fresh spinach, then refrigerated half the filling so I can enjoy for lunch with some pasta or rice!

This was a perfect lazy-hungover-sunday meal!  Thanks!  I wasn't sure about the curry powder but it is a very nice mild flavour!  Delicious!

Delicious as written!  I think I'll add more shrimp next time, though, and I'll keep the veggies warm while I'm cooking the eggs instead of removing them from heat completely.

(Even with the additional ingredients, I'm not sure how five eggs can feed four people. I make omelettes with three eggs per serving. Also, who makes omelettes in a suacepan?! Weird). Anyway, I made this for Husband, and was gonna fix myself a regular cheese and onion omelette as I thought the Aussie one would have too much going on. Wrong! The only thing I did differently with mine was to omit the green bell pepper. Thanks!

just finished making and eating this. wow!! great!! i had to modify because i had no mushrooms or peppers so i just used more shrimp (salad sized) and i added red pepper flakes and sauted the onions garlic and shrimp in a mixture of olive oil and butter and seasoned this w/ seasoned salt, peper, and garlic power.  
this was a great recipe and only took me about 5 minutes to prepare and took 5 to cook. great high protein low carb meal! great for breakfast lunch and dinner,too. i think i might experiement w/ it some more and will try shrimp and crab or even crawfish or lobster next time. i can't wait!

Whoah!!  Was this ever great!!  However, this cook had too much wine while putting it together and used cumin instead of curry.  Fantastic!  Second time I made it I used curry but have decided next time I'll use both - probably 1/2 t. cumin.  Excellent!

I personally don't eat stuff like this, but my boyfriend loved it!! There was so much stuff inside, it was impossible to fold like an omelet is supposed to be, but he didn't care!

This recipe is amazing!  Although, when reading the reviews prior to making it, I had to laugh at how many reviewers apparently cannot read and attempted (or thought the recipe stated) to make the omelet in a saucepan!  I hope they cook better than they read ;)

This was really a winner for my kids!  They loved it.  The only adjustment I made was to add more of the shrimp and I used canned mushroom since I didn't have the fresh ones.  I will definitely do this again since I got rated by my kids as "the best cooker" :-)

"A dang good omelet" said my boyfriend. He couldn't believe I added shrimp.He obviously never had an omelet with shrimp. Thanks for the recipe, I will make this again.

After reading the previous reviews for this I thought I couldn't go wrong, but what a disappointment!  I made this for Father's Day breakfast this morning, and it just wasn't good.  I started out following the recipe exactly as written even though I was confused about making an omelette in a saucepan and how 5 eggs would turn out 4 servings when all cooked together in a saucepan (it doesn't).  Upon noticing that the eggs were getting brown on the bottom and the top was still liquid, I dumped it out in to a fry pan.  If you try this, I recommend starting with a fry pan.  I think a teaspoon of curry was way too much.  My husband asked, "what is the weird smell coming from the eggs?"  I thought it was edible, but not wonderful, and a waste of the time it took to chop the vegetables and a waste of good shrimp!  My husband on the other hand couldn't even eat it.  So much for a wonderful Father's Day breakfast... he proceeded to make himself some Eggo Waffles!

Doubled the eggs to 5 and adjusted the other ingredients to taste. Replaced the green pepper with a deseeded and chopped, fire roasted jalapeno and cooked it with the mushroom, onion and garlic to give it the bite we like. Go with the curry. The curry and shrimp compliment each other very nicely.

I did what some other reviewers did and only used 1/2 of the curry powder and I thought it was a little weak. I will make it again but next time I will replace the curry powder with Cajun seasonings.

I didn't care for this meal. It seems to be to much onion and I didn't care for the shrimp. We'll see what the husband says.

I did this as a quick fix omelet, using just the onions and cheese and just adding the curry powder to the mix. It was delicious, but just enough for hubby and me.

My husband and I both gave this a 5*.  The slight hint of curry was great.  I thought the shrimp would be overpowering, but it was wonderful.
