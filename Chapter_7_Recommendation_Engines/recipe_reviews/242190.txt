This was a family favorite for Thanksgiving in my home.  We called it "Copper Pennies".  I lost the church cookbook that the recipe was in, and was so happy to find it here on the internet.  Not everybody loves it, but my family does!

This was a simple marinated salad to get together and was a nice change on the side of grilled chicken instead of just regular cooked carrots.   I thought the sauce did taste mostly like tomato soup, so, I added a few more splashes of vinegar and some extra worcestershire sauce.
