This is even better if you add in a large, drained can of mushrooms and one large onion, sliced. Very good over potatoes, rice AND egg noodles.

I have been making something similar for years.  I noticed several reviews mention that the sauce was too thin.  What I have done is put in a package of dry onion soup mix instead of the condensed onion soup and it comes out less "soupy."   Another thing I tried is to put the uncooked noodles in the crockpot with the beef mixture about 45-60 minutes prior to serving and cook the noodles with the beef in the crockpot.  The noodles soak up some of the sauce and it reminds me of the beef and noodles my uncle (a caterer/butcher) makes. When I did that, I ended up adding a little beef broth so there was enough moisture.   I serve the beef and noodles over mashed potatoes and my finicky children even ate it.

This recipe is hard to beat when you want an easy meal that is hearty when you come home from a long day at work.  I have added a little red wine or worcestersire as a variation and black pepper and that gives it nice flavor too.

This was great!  I used 1.5 lbs of lean stew meat.  This makes a lot of gravy, so use at least that much.  Next time, I may brown meat.  My teenage daughter was not too thrilled with the look of the meat.  But boy did it taste great.  We used on top of mashed potatoes.  Awesome!

So easy and so good! I agree to add  mushrooms for even tastier results. The sauce is thin so I mixed a tablespoon cornstartch and a little water and added it to make it thicken.

My family liked this.  I used a little over two lbs of stew meat so I doubled the soups.  It made a whole lot of gravy so I dont think that was necessary.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms.  Next time I will use low sodium soups.  Thanks for sharing!

I added a splash of red wine and fresh mushrooms.  Cooked all day on low, and served over egg noodles.  Yum!  I loved this one. So easy!

Excellent- I added some carrots and potatos in the last hour of cooking since some reviewers had said that it was a bit salty. My husband, who hates mushrooms, found some mushroom pieces from the soup and did not even care- he thought it was that good!!!

I just love anything that goes in the crockpot...Quick and Easy, however I did change the recipe a bit. I used a packed of onion dip mix when adding the beef and soup to the crockpot. Then half way through I added cut carrots, potatoes and an onion. Gravy was a bit thin; I added flour to thicken. I served over hot egg noodles. Yummie!

I wasn't crazy about the flavor the condensed French onion soup lent to this recipe. Added a sliced onion and sliced button mushrooms... will use beef broth instead of the onion soup next time.

Tried this tonight.  Left it in the crock pot all day - not bad with noodles.  It is a very thin gravy and I didn't have any flour or cornstarch to thicken it with.  I think it is missing a little something, just not sure what it is.  I would make again, maybe try it with rice.

I added a package of fresh pre-sliced mushrooms, half of an onion chopped, garlic powder, black pepper, and seasoning salt.  Served over rice.  Tasted pretty good and was easy so plan on making again.

I made this is on the stove instead of the crockpot but followed the recipe exactly as written. This was really good and easy to make. Hubby had it over noodles and I had it over rice. Next time I would double the soups for more gravy.

This was awesome!  I made as writen, but decided to add in some carrot chunks with the beef (so I wouldn't have to do a veggie at the end) and a few frozen peas at the end for color.  I also thickened it slightly with corn starch.    Not sure if its necessary, I just like things more gravylike.  I served it with the egg noodles.  Now I have decided that this is the easiest base to make Beef Stew and instead of noodles I will just be loading this up with carrots, potatoes and the like to make a wonderful stew. It was just sooooooooooooooo easy and yummy!!

Had this over white rice.  It tasted like comfort food on a cool fall day.  All I added was some fresh cracked pepper and the flavor is fine.  I suppose you could always add some veggies to this if you prefer, but flavorwise it works on its own.

This was an okay recipe, but I found the flavor kind of bland. As others suggested, I added a can of mushrooms. I wonder if the liquid from that diluted the flavor somewhat? Overall this needed a little something, salt or more seasonings or something. On the bright side, it was very easy to make!

This was good just a bit salty, next time I think I might skip the french onion soup. I used 2 lbs of stew meat, 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of french onion soup. I also added sauteed mushrooms at the end and served over rice with garlic green beans. Very filling and very easy to make. We will be making it again.

This wasn't bad. The meat was tender and I thought the gravy was good. I served it over mashed potatoes. It was certainly easy enough but I don't know if I would make it again.

I made this recipe with 1.5 pounds of beef.  At first, I thought it was a little too salty so I added some fresh mushrooms and a little bit of water.  Served over egg noodles and it was perfect.
made this recipe again,11-16-10, I used 4 large pork chops instead of the beef stew and again, it was excellent!

I doubled this recipe and used Campbell's golden mushroom instead of cream of mushroom (mostly because of the color, not the taste) and it was fantastic.  I will make this again and again.

used 2 lbs of meat and one can of french onion soup and two cans of condensed mushroom soup.  Seasoned and floured the meat, then slightly fried it in oil before adding it to the soups.  Also used half of a can of beef consommee'.  I deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of sherry.  The family loved this!  Will definetly add this to my recipe box.

This was really good. I cooked it on the stove on low instead of a crockpot. It was really tender, very tasty. I had to add extra soup because it dried out!

This was not good. The only thing I changed was that I used the Campbells cream of mushroom soup with the roasted garlic. Once we dished it up, we put lots of pepper and some sour cream on it. Won't be making it again.

This is a good, easy meal. I added fresh mushrooms. Also added sour cream (about a cup) right before serving. Served over egg noodles. Nothing fancy, but it does the job :)

Made this as stated. It was a quick, stick to your ribs meal served over egg noodles with fresh green beans. If I make it again I will "doctor it up" some. Needed more flavor or spice, or something.

This is a great crockpot beef recipe for busy days. I have made it in the past and hadded along with the mushroom soup, 1 small can of sliced mushroom( liquid and all), 1 package Lipton onion soup mix , and 1/4 -1/2 cup cooking sherry. Can be thickened the last 1/2 hour of cooking with 3Tablespoons flour to 1/2 cup water. Add and stir in well and cook til thick. Great over mashed potatoes.

I have been making this recipe for years. I cook the meat in the crockpot all day. Then, I shred the meat (removing any fat), mix the soups together in a bowl and pour over the meat heating through. We also serve it over rice or noodles. I find that I have to thin this with water as the gravy is very thick.

To make the meal healthier, I added sliced mushrooms, garlic, coarse black pepper, organic carrots, diced onions, mushroom bouillon and two cups of water. I served on spatzle (European egg noodle). Amazing!!!

This was pretty good.  I should have let it cook longer in the crockpot.  I added an entire bag of frozen pearl onions, and looking back that was WAY too many.  I added a jar of sliced mushrooms which made it really yummy.  I am definitely going to try this recipe again and not add so many onions and I will cook it longer... :)

I followed this recipe exactly and it was very tasty and VERY easy.  Will definitely make again, but will probably make a few improvements - a can of mushrooms for sure would be great in this and I think I will also add an extra can of cream of mushroom soup next time.  We served over egg noodles, but the sauce is a little thin, so I might try over rice or get some good bread to help sop up some of the yummy sauce.

Well, this is a really easy one.  I did add a can of mushrooms to the crock pot.  We had this over noodles, but we think we would like it better over rice, because it has so much sauce.  We kept the crock on low and we figured it was done cooking in about 6 hours.  I will definately make again.

This was excellent. The changes I made were: I added a second can of cream of mushroom soup and I used a package of dry onion soup mix. It was nice and thick and creamy and not soupy at all. In addition, I covered my stew beef pieces in flour and seared all sides before placing them in the crock pot. Served it over egg noodles. It was great!

Very good.  I cut the meat up in small pieces.  I sometimes flash cook mushrooms in a skillet on the grill and add those.  I also add the garlic cloves from the Med. bar from Wegman's and that's a delicious touch.  I sometimes add some fine noodles to soak up the excess sauce.  I have served over mash potatoes but rice or noodles would be good too.

This recipe had good flavor and the meat was tender....however, it came out really watery. Added the noodles to the crockpot an hour before serving. Also added an onion and mushrooms.

This recipe was so easy my 8 yr old daughter put all the ingredients together in the crock pot and made "Mother's Day" dinner. She was so proud of herself and I got the day free of cooking that day. (Minus cutting up the meat the day before). She also put broad noodles about 1/2 hr before we ate. Couldn't ask for a more simple and filling meal. Doubled the meat and mushroom soup and found the sauce to be perfect with the broad noodles mixed in. 
This is now my daughter's MOTHER'S DAY dinner for me. 
Thanks for sharing such an easy and delicious dish.

I have made a recipe close to this for years.  However, I add a can of golden mushroom soup to the other soups.  It makes a lot of gravy, but that is what my husband loves.  I serve it over brown rice.  Always a favorite at my house.

5 starts for easy (and smelled oh so good!), 3 stars for taste. Made exactly as written.

Been making this for a while now - found it on another site - and really LOVE it. Sometimes you get a bad batch of stew meat and its not as good. But the meat is super super tender otherwise. Its great over rice. The ONLY difference in the recipe I use is I use the fat free cream of mushroom and that makes it a lot less salty. Also add 8oz of sliced up mushrooms. Super yummy.

This was good and certainly easy enough.  I added a can of Golden Mushroom soup this time, and next time I want to add some baby carrots and cubed potatoes.  The gravy is thin but tasty - I think a shot of Worcestershire may be yummy next time.

Very easy and very good!  I always brown the meat first.  I use golden mushroom soup and double the amount, double the meat, and use one can of french onion soup, one can of beef broth.  I add Reame's frozen noodles to the crockpot about 30 minutes before serving.

I made this last night for a house full of children. They all gobbled it up and many had seconds. I served over rice as a personal preference. The adults enjoyed a different meal but a couple of them had the 'gravy' over their mashed potatoes and said it was really good.

Very good, and very easy. Tasted it part way through and decided it needed something so I added a 1/2 C of red wine. I also added a can of drained mushrooms like others. Had over garlic mashed potatoes and it was yummy!

Wonderful!!  The only changes I made were to add a can of water at the beginning and fresh mushrooms at the end when I added 2 cups of med. egg noodles.  Delish!

This recipe was so good and so easy. The only things I added were a 7 oz. can of sliced mushrooms, a sliced red onion, and an addition can of french onion soup. It's delicious over Amish-style egg noodles. My boyfriend was going to take all the leftovers for lunch the next day, only to find it half gone by morning. Your family will eat this up!
