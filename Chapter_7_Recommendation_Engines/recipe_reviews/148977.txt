I was excited to see this recipe because I had some wakame flakes. The flavor is pretty bland. I substituted sesame oil for the butter. I wasn't too impressed with the flavor and decided not to waste the avocado on this recipe. I'm gonna add some seasoned rice vinegar and try and turn it into a salad.

I love this concept! I felt like the original was a little bland but it has a lot of potential. We added in some ground beef but I think what this might really need is a dash of rice vinegar and maybe some furikake. A great start well deserving of a good review.

This worked great as a side dish with the nutty flavors of the brown rice and toasted sesame seeds. If you feel that this rice dish is bland just squeeze some lime juice in it or add some Sriracha.
