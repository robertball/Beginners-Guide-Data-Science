This was very easy to make and it came out great!  I did make one change, however.  Instead of using all white flour, I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour.  This gave it more fiber and a better, nuttier taste.  Also, I don't use bread flour in my bread machine.  Unbleached all-purpose flour is good enough for me because if I did have all these different flours, I wouldn't have any room in my cabinets.  Although I don't use bread flour, I do add vital wheat gluten, which is available at supermarkets.  This gives more volume to loaves and a more bread-like texture.  The rule is to add one teaspoon of wheat gluten per cup of flour or one and a half teaspoons per cup of whole grain(or whole wheat)flour.  I hope this tip was helpful for those who may be having trouble with the size of their bread loaves as a result of not using bread flour.  I will be making this bread again soon!

Hi All, I submitted this recipe a couple years ago and am just now checking back. We still go through a loaf a day (the kids even fight over the crusts!), but we do use 2 1/3 cups of flour not the 2 cups that I originally  wrote the recipe as.  A "heavy" tsp. of yeast is nice also.  Will try the butter in place of oil, sounds good. Enjoy!!  Merrilee Bell

I really liked this recipe - the bread was very tasty and had a good texture.  My only problem is that I don't like bread from a bread machine in general - the crust is too thick.  So the second time I made it, I let my machine just make the dough and then I baked it in the oven instead (350 degrees until nicely browned).  It turned out WONDERFUL!  I now make this bread all the time - at least twice a week!

WOW!  YUM!  I don't own a bread machine, so I did this:  * Proof one packet of regular yeast with the water and honey for about 8 minutes.   * Add the remaining ingredients all at once and knead in stand mixer with the dough hook for another 8-10 minutes, on a medium/low setting.   * Oil the bowl and the dough, cover it, and let it rise for an hour in a warm oven.   * Punch it down, plop in the loaf pan and rise another 30 minutes.   * Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.    FANTASTIC bread.  Makes a wicket grilled cheese.

I found this to be the best bread machine recipe yet. Not too dense like many are. I, too, increased the yeast and flour. I also have tried several variations that work well and give a different flavor. Try adding seeds or nuts (ie, sunflower, pumpkin, pecans, walnuts). They are delicious. Add them during the second kneed or at the add-in buzzer. Also, you can replace some of the flour (I generally use 1/3-2/3 cup) with either cornmeal or whole wheat flour. I also have replaced the honey with molasses. They all work well and you can mix and match! Enjoy

We love this recipe.

I make this bread 2x per wk. at least.  Family loves it plain, in sandwiches, as french toast etc.

Some small changes that work for me...

Add 1 tbsp brwn sugar, 1/3c whole wheat flour, 1 extra tsp yeast, reduce bread flour to 2c (or 2 1/4c depending on humidity).

Bake on white, med. crust setting for 1.5lb loaf.

Comes out PERFECT every time!

Perfect and foolproof bread.  One of the few recipes I found needed no changes or tinkering. I didn't like the description of its being lightly sweet, however, so I reduced the honey by about a third, only for my own preference, though I'm sure it's excellent just as written. Great bread for toasting or sandwiches with a mildly different taste because of the oatmeal. I used a new bread machine which I haven't mastered yet, but this recipe came out perfectly on the first try. This will be one to hang on to!

Great recipe, i found it very easy for such a delicious bread. I prepared this is my bread machine using the dough cycle only, then shaped the dough into rolls, letting them rise again for 30 minutes before baking (350 for about 35 minutes). I usually make bread this way since we really only eat it with salads or soup anyway. These were really good with a little butter and brown sugar.  Thanks Merrilee :-)

This is absolutely delicious!  Crusty on the outside and very soft on the inside.  Slightly sweet tasting.  I will be making this one a lot to use for sandwiches or to just eat as a snack.  Perfect!

Really tasty . . . I think I'll skip buying sandwich bread at the supermarket from now on and make this instead.  After reading the other reviews, I also added a bit more flour, oats and yeast and I baked the loaf in my oven at 350 for about 40 minutes.  Delicious!

I didn't change any of the ingredients.  I did however use my stand mixer instead of the bread machine.

I proofed the yeast for about 10 minutes in the water (warm), dumped in the rest of the ingredients, let it knead for about 4 minutes, covered and let it rise for 60, punched it down, shaped it into a loaf, and dropped it into a pan.  I covered it and let it rise again for 30 minutes, brushed the top with an egg white, and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.

This recipe is great, we'll be making it again and again.

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to make but with a few tweaks.  I doubled the recipe as my machine makes 2lb loaves.  Used 1 1/2 cups water, 1/2 cup milk, 1/4 c honey, 1 tsp salt (found it strange recipe didn't call for this), 1/2 of rolled oats, 1/2 rolled oats ground to powder, 4 1/4 c AP flour and 1 tsp yeast.  Taste is good, soft texture but it is a very dense loaf.  Will most like make again, tweeking the recipe

These make wonderful rolls.  Use dough setting on machine.  When cycle is done, place dough on lightly flourered surface.  Punch down to remove air.  Shape into 15 round rolls  (knead in slightly more flour if too sticky).    Arrange in 9x12 lightly greased glass pan.  Cover lightly with greased plastic wrap.  Let rise in warm place until doubled (about an hour). Remove plastic.  Bake 375 degrees for 15-18 minutes or until lightly browned.  Turn out onto rack.

*5* STAR RECIPE!! Makes a delightful sandwich bread! I made one little adjustment to make a large 2lb loaf in my Zojirushi maker. I adjusted the servings to 15 then followed the recipe exactly & it turned out beautifully!

I don't have a bread machine but I do have a Kitchen Aid Mixer. I used my mixer from beginning to end, starting out with proofing my yeast and then jumping to kneading with my bread hook.
I used a full packet of yeast in mine.
Turned out great. I covered mine with foil during the last ten minutes or so to keep the top of the bread from burning while the rest of the bread finished cooking. This is wonderful bread. I plan on using it for sandwiches and french toast tomorrow. EDITED: This bread was so good that I don't want to share it! I had some this morning toasted with butter and it was heaven.
Very wonderful homemade bread.

To die for! I usually have to tweak bread recipes to get the dough to that smooth, elastic, not too sticky stage. NOT THE CASE with this one. I followed the recipe amounts to the letter, except I was a bit shy on honey so I topped the measuring cup off with a squirt of light corn syrup. I doubled the recipe and made it by hand, no bread machine. I baked at 350 for about twenty minutes, then covered it loosely with foil to avoid a too browned crust and cooked it until it read 190 degrees internally. TO DIE FOR. Slightly sweet, a nice crunchy but not too hard crust and a moist, slightly dense (but in the most pleasant of ways... you know, it has that nice bite and chew to it, it's not all air or spongey) My new go-to Oatmeal bread recipe.

For those who want to know how to make this by hand: I put the warm water in a large bowl, dissolved the yeast on top and let it sit ten minutes. I added the oil, honey, and salt. Mixed gently, added half the flour and mixed on low in my Kitchen Aid (but a wooden spoon is fine) when it was smooth I worked in the rest of the flour and let it mix on with the dough hook about ten minutes. Turned out onto the counter and kneaded by hand for a few minutes. Put in an oiled bowl and rise in a warm place until doubled. Punched down, shaped into a loaf, put in a greased pan and let rise again. Bake at 350 until internal temp reaches 190 degrees. Loosely cover with foil halfway through bake time if you want a softer/lighter crust.

Heavenly.

Loved this recipe.  My incredible picky roommate about died from ecstasy!  I double the recipe for one loaf, adding 3/4 cup honey, 2 1/2 teaspoons yeast, and a little over 5 cups of whole wheat flour to make a whole wheat bread.  I don't have a bread machine, so I dissolved the yeast in 2 cups warm water first before adding the rest of the ingredients and 3 cups flour.  I took the mix out of the bowl and kneaded in the last 2 cups and then continued kneading for 15 minutes.  A great way to make sure of perfect conditions for the bread to rise is to turn on the oven to warm for one minute, then put in the oil covered dough and turn off the oven.  The first time I let the dough rise 1 1/2 hours, second time and hour in the pan.  The second time it rises don't put a cloth over the pan, the dough rises above the pan and a little over the edge (I love that look!) and a cloth will depress it, instead cover with an oiled piece of cling wrap. Great find!

By far the best bread machine recipe I've ever used!!  I have bread machine cookbooks and dozens of other recipes for bread machines, but this is the easiest and best of all.  My family loves it whether as a dinner accompaniment or for sandwiches.  I don't even buy sliced bread any more.  My daughter and I tried a variation the other day using some raisins, chopped dates, Craisins, walnuts and a dash of cinnamon...excellent toasted!  Thanks for the recipe!!

There is no better bread. This is the Queen of all bread machine recipes. Just tried it out and messed it up as much as anyone could [ ie, my honey was super thick, so the dough was too dry. Added little water mid-cycle. Then it was too moist. Added a bit of flour. Then it was too dry..etc. You get the picture] I added some sunflower and flax seeds and dried cranberries at some point with blatant disregard for the add-ins beep. I was sure it was going to be a flop. Well, I'm embarrassed to say that my husband and I devoured the loaf for lunch. the WHOLE THING! It's DELICIOUS, it's EASY. It seems pretty fool-proof. Try it! Thanks Merrilee!!

Delicious, my whole family loves it. I bake it in the oven so I get an easily manageable loaf at 350 for about 35 minutes.

This bread was a hit with the family.  I made the dough as directed in the bread machine using the "dough" cycle.  I then shaped it and put it into a greased loaf pan and let it rise in a warm oven for 1 hour.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and it turned out perfectly.

The texture of this bread is light with a slight chew, beautiful. The crust came out kinda dark, as I don't know what all the settings on my machine mean but it did NOT come out as a tough crust. I was surprised and pleased. I didn't have any regular oatmeal so 2 packets of apple cinnamon instant did the trick, although it hardly matters since I see no trace of it in the sliced bread. I suspect this recipe is extremely versatile, you could use any variation of oatmeals from steel cut to instant, dried fruits, nuts, seeds. I might increase the honey next time for a sweeter bread. Can't wait to try this recipe when I finally get a Zojirushi bread machine. This was dang good in my Mr. Coffee breadmaker that I got for $3 at a garage sale.

Awesome bread!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Turned out wonderful.  Followed the advice from another post and added 1 tablespoon brown sugar.  Came out perfect!  One of my favorite bread recipes!  Thanks again!

Too bad we can't do half stars, because I would give this recipe 4 1/2. This is because I did make some changes. I proofed one packet of Hodgson Mill Active Dry Yeast in  1/4 cup water with 1/4 tsp of natural sugar (per instructions) for about 5-10 minutes. I warmed up the remaining 3/4 water to add later to the recipe. I put everything, with the exception of starting out with 1 1/2 flour, in the food processor and mixed thoroughly. Then I added another whole cup of flour gradually and pulsing it til it was mixed. That brings the total flour tally to 2 1/2 cups. I also put 1 tbsp of vital wheat gluten per 1 cup of unbleached flour. Then I kneaded the dough for about 8-10 minutes of a floured surface, adding a little more flour each time it got sticky. Put it in an oiled bowl covered with a damp cloth and stuck it in a warmed oven for 1 hour, then punched dough down and put it in a 9x5x3 loaf pan lined with parchment paper and covered it again and put it in warmed oven for 45 minutes (I would recommend sprinkling a little flour on top before covering it a second time as the dough will stick to the damp cloth). Then took loaf pan with dough out and let it rise another 15 minutes while I warmed up the oven to 350. Baked the loaf at 350 for 35 minutes as recommended by another reviewer. Let it cool on rack for 5-10 minutes then put in into a plastic bread bag so the heat would help keep the loaf soft. Husband and kids gave a big thumbs up!! Thank you!! :)

**UPDATE***I have made this bread 2-3 times a week since I have found this recipe! Since I use WW flour I found that to aid in rising I put the bread in the oven (OFF) with a pot of boiling water underneath it. The result is a delicious, soft, moist, loaf that I can't get enough of! ---Original Review ----> Finally!!! The BEST bread recipe I have found hands down! My years of searching are over! The only change I made was to use 1 cup bread flour and 1 1/3 c whole wheat flour (added a bit more yeast to be sure it would still rise well). Made dough in bread machine but baked bread in an 8 x 4" pan for 24 minutes! Perfection!

This was great.  It is a very sweet bread though so if your looking for something not sweet, this isn't it.  I upped the servings to 15, let the bread machine make the dough and it made 1 large loaf and one rustic.  I baked it at 375 for about 40 min. (I don't like things baked in my bread machine but it's great for mixing and rising). I will make this again.

4-1/2 stars for this. Lovely flavor and moist texture. I did not find it to be a "sweet" bread as some earlier reviews said.  Perfect for sandwiches or toasting, and a good keeper. After 3 days it was better for toasting, just too crumbly for sandwiches, so use it as quickly as possible, or freeze slices for later use. Will keep well frozen for up to one month if wrapped securely (I put two slices in one sandwich sized ziploc bag.)

Very good but I did add a 1/2 cup extra flour and 1/2 cup extra oats and it was just a little doughy. But my family finished the whole loaf at dinner.

My family - and everyone else! - LOVES this bread. I make it by hand - whips up in no time. Dump dry ingredients into a bowl, add the honey (or brown sugar) and oil, then I just add a bit of hot water at a time until it makes a nice dough. Oil slightly, cover to rise, then knead for 3 min, shape, bake 350 for 35 min. I also use a partial whole wheat flour we buy in the health food store. It's fantastic bread, super-easy to make, and a real crowd pleaser.

This turned out great! I did do the following changes however: I used half wheat and half all-purpose flour, and I subbed apple sauce in for the oil called for in the recipe. I just put everything together in my bread machine and it came out wonderfully! This is the first loaf of bread I've ever made in a bread machine and I'm so happy with how it turned out! My boyfriend is currently eating the whole thing.

A really good bread that came out soft and light.  A little too sweet for my taste so I will use less honey next time.  This is a 1 pound loaf and it worked perfectly in my Sunbeam bread maker, which is for 1.5 to 2 pound loaves.  I used Quaker Quick Oats and the loaf still came out soft and light.  Used olive oil as well.  Probably one of the best recipes I tried since getting the bread maker a few months ago.  I think the sweetness of the bread will make a great sandwich with a salty meat like ham.

I really love this bread! The first few weeks I did everything the same as the original recipe (except I use 100% wheat flour), but it was always a little small for my machine, so I upped the servings to 16 and it fit much better! I think it must be for a 1 lb loaf, mine is 1 1/2-2lbs!

WoW! Best bread i have ever made.
I didn't want to alter this, as i do not make bread enough to feel comfortable in doing so, but, I LOVE honey, so I did add about a tablespoon more with the 1/4c. It turned out a tad bit darker on the crust than my liking, any ideas how to get a lighter crust? without altering the yummy perfect inside?
Thanks!

I've made this bread several times now and it has been perfect each time! This last time was actually the closest I've come to making it as the recipe is written - the only change I made was to use melted butter instead of oil. In other batches, I have substituted 1/3 cup whole wheat flour instead of the bread flour and that also turns out very nicely. This one is a keeper for sure!

Great bread! The easiest thing to put together, very good outcome! I am making a second loaf tomorrow, in fact..because mine didn't rise, but that was my fault for not checking the date on my yeast- so be sure to make sure your yeast is fresh for a big loaf!

I usually don't rate recipes but I had to rate this one...My family and I loved this bread!  I put all the ingredients into my bread maker + some chocolate chips   and set the timer  so that it would be ready for  breakfast the next morning.  I was so excited when I opened  the bread maker. the bread turned out wonderful.  The kids loved it! I'm going to make more today (w/o the chocolate chips) for dinner.

I made this bread yesterday and it was by far the best bread I have ever made! We loved it. I I have this one saved in my recipe box. The only thing I did a little differently is I topped the 1/4 of honey with about 2 Tbls of Molasses. Oh my...this one is a keeper.

tried with 1c ww + 1-1/3c ubleached white on a medium crust setting. Took out of pan & let cool on wire rack for 20 minutes before slicing.  It is the first time I used my Black & Decker bread machine after owning it for 3 years and I love this recipe; DH wants it w/o the rolled oats next time but still likes it.  Thanks everyone!!!  I love the reviews.

This turned out perfect! I used whole wheat flour for bread machines and the bread was beautiful with just a hit of sweet and a just chewy enough crust. This was my first bread machine recipe and the first loaf I've ever made in a bread machine and I don't think I can buy store bread again!

This was very easy.  I did the dough in the bread machine, but then let it rise while the oven was preheating, and I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 32 min.  Great loaf of bread.

I don't have a bread machine so I had to make some revisions. I warmed the water and dissolved the yeast in it. For one cup of the flour I did whole wheat, the other cup I did white, and I did 1/3 cup of ground flax seed. I kneeded it for about 2 minutes on a floured surface till it was smooth and a little firm. I then baked it for 45 minutes at 325. Sooooo yummy!!!!!! I will defenitly do this one many many times again.

*UPDATE* This bread is awesome. I've made it several times in both a breadmaker, and by hand. Each time I make it, it comes out great. My mate loves it. I do substitute the water with skim or 2% milk (whichever I have on hand)...it enhances the flavor and makes the loaf more dense. Definitely a keeper recipe. I use it at least once a week. Thanks!

This is the best recipe I have tried for the bread machine!  I LOVE the texture and lightly sweetened flavor of this bread.  It is great as morning toast with coffee.

Five of us finished this loaf in one evening, just eating it warm with butter. Followed the recipe exactly, except that I used whole wheat bread flour. The honey flavour is perfect.

This is the 1st bread machine recipes which made dense bread.  We used all purpose unbleached flour (not bread flour).  We made no other changes.  Easy w/ a great taste & texture.

this bread is excellent, although we preferred it the second time i made it, after all the changes- based on the reviews here. firstly, i scaled the recipe to 15 servings, then added more flour and more yeast (2t). i replaced half the flour with whole wheat flour with some vital wheat gluten, and also added a little wheat germ. used the dough cycle and then let it rise twice before baking it for about 40 minutes. ENJOY!

I like to use the dough cycle for this bread.  Then I bake it in the oven at 350 for 30-40 minutes after letting it rise once more in the loaf pan.  It's a great sandwich bread or good as bread & butter with dinner.

Wow! What an awesome bread! This is the first bread I've made in my bread maker and boy, is it ever some YUMMY!  I bought a bread maker second hand and had no recipes and really no idea how to use it, so I found this recipe, dumped all the ingredients in and it turned out awesome!

I really disliked the crust of this bread. I set my bread machine at the lighter basic bread setting and it was far too dark. (probably because of all the honey) When I ate a fresh piece, the bread part was good but the crust tasted as if I was crunching on burnt toast. If I ever try to make this again, I will use the sweet bread setting so that it won't come out so dark.

As all breadbakers know, most bread is great right out of the oven. The true test is what it tastes like when its cool or even one day old.....This bread stands the "test of time". It won't rise as much as you expect, but the end result is good.Thanks for sharing!

MMMM! Very good loaf! But it was a little on the moist side... you may want to try using butter or margarine instead of oil bc it does come out very moist.

My family love's  this bread, I bought a breadmaker at a yard sale  for $2.00. This  was the first recipe I tried it came out ok but a little dense for my liking so I add 1 more tsp of yeast and that did the trick. The first loaf with the extra yeast was light airy and delicious. I will definitely continue to make this bread.

This bread had a great flavor, but I had problems with the amount of flour.  It was almost soupy when it was kneading in the machine, so I had to guess and add more flour.  The final loaf came out a little tough on the outside, but I'm not an experienced bread maker (hence using a machine).  I don't plan to give up on this recipe, just fine tune how I can adjust the flour amount.

I recently went sugar-free so I substituted the honey with 1/4 tsp of liquid Stevia.  I was a little worried, since it was my first time cooking with Stevia, but it turned out delicious!

I really liked this recipe, but as I have a 1/5 - 2lbs breadmaker, the dough came out VERY sticky and I had to hand knead in more flour. (I only used the 'dough setting' as I like to bake in my oven) So next time around I'll be using 3 cups flour. 
However, the taste was amazing! The loaf only lasted a day!

Love it! I repeat every week. The size is great to put in the regular toaster. I prefer not to use the active dry yeast. I use the normal one.

Great recipe.  Have now made it several times. My kids love it. I made two changes that I think have improved it. 1. Use butter instead of vegetable oil. 2. Substitute 1 cup of bread flour with 1 cup of whole wheat flour. Good luck!

I made this exactly as written; but, I substituted 1tbs of low fat Country Crock for the oil.  It turned out great!  This is a fantastic low fat bread!  We will be making this again and again and again.

This is a very tasty and healthy bread.  Did not use the bread machine, so followed the suggestions of Cola, and added the honey to the warm water prior to proofing the yeast. Used whole grain flour instead of bread flour as well, for a really hearty loaf.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was fantastic. I don't have a bread machine so I just proofed my yeast in water and a teaspoon of brown sugar, mixed in oil,honey, salt, flour and oats and kneaded until it came together. Baked at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. Superb!

Excellent recipe! Wonderful flavour and body. Next time though, I am going to sub some of the all-purpose flour with some multigrain or whole wheat flour just to what kind of results I will get. Thanks for the recipe!

This bread turned out very light inside with a chewy crust. The loaf bakes into a dark shade at the Light Crust setting, so it's important to remember. I followed suggestion and threw in some pumpkin and sunflower seeds. It added some interest to bread, but it would have been tasty without them too. Overall this bread has the right proportions, just a bit too airy for my taste.

A delicious multi-purpose bread.  Bakes beautifully in the machine, is delicious hot and fresh with butter, great for sandwiches and toast the next day.  I followed the suggestions of increasing the whole wheat flour, yeast, and 1tbsp brown sugar.  Thank you for a great recipe and helpful-hint reviews!

I can see how you can go through a loaf a day!  This is great bread!  I made mine half whole wheat/half bread flour, but I am positive it would be even better with all bread flour.  Yum Yum, thanks!

A simple and excellent bread.  I like to use Scottish steel cut oatmeal for this recipe.

This bread is delicious! Easy to make and just the right consistency. I made the recipe without any changes to the ingredients. I made it in my bread machine and it was very easy. This will be my favorite recipe for bread!

Fabulous bread, great texture, soft, light and moist.  I substituted 1/2 c. whole wheat for bread flour and used overflowing 1/2 t. regular yeast and 1/2t. rapid yeast the 2nd time I made this and it rose to the top of my bread machine.  I think the rapid rise really made the difference, but still loved the 1st loaf with all regular yeast.  Also, liked it best with all white bread flour, but do prefer to make it healthier with whole wheat.

I found this recipe last night and am already working on my 3rd loaf. I put it in my breadmaker last night and set it on time delay...the best way to wake up on a Saturday morning is to the fragrance of this delicious bread. I made the following adjustments: used 2 c. whole wheat flour and 1/3 c. bread flour and increased the yeast to 2 tsp. based on comments by other reviewers. This has already been written into my recipe book.

I ended up using bran instead of oats because I had no oats but wanted a sweet bread. The bread was just ok, it barely rose but had a nice smell and tasted ok, even though it was dense. Could've been because of the bran, or because I used all-purpose instead of bread flour ... I don't know if I will make it again or not. Thanks though!

This is very good bread. After reading the reviews, I upped the salt just a little and upped the yeast to 1 1/2 tsp. I've made this bread 3 times now and have figured out that cooking it on the 2lb loaf/dark crust setting gets the bread done all the way through. I plan on making this bread every week instead of buying bread at the store.

This is wonderful! I have been borrowing my sister's bread machine, and I just love this recipe. For some reason, it bakes up very high so I have a funny top to it. It is a 1 pound machine, so I don't know why it does that, but it tastes wonderful. Thank you!

Much to my surprise, especially after reading some of the more negative reviews, the bread came out great in my bread machine!  A little on the heavy moist side, but the taste was great. My husband who is a white bread addict loved it too!!

I made this recipe last night using a Zojirushi bread maker using the Basic+Regular setting with medium crust.  It yields a good size loaf perfect to slice for toast or sandwiches. The result was great and everyone loved it.   The texture is more robust than plain white but not too much. I think next time I will use a little less honey as I prefer savory breads.   I also want to use part whole wheat bread flour to experiment.  Awesome recipe!

I just made this and it turned out perfectly! I did NOT use a bread machine though. If you do not have a bread machine, then follow these directions:
Pour yeast into a bowl. In a glass measuring cup, combine hot water and honey, stir.  Pour water/honey mixture on top of yeast and let it stand 5-10 minutes. Combine remaining ingredients in a separate bowl. Combine dry ingredients with the risen yeast mixture. Proof dough in a well oiled bowl till it has doubled in size. Once it has doubled in size, punch down and separate into 2 equal size dough balls.  Shape each dough half into rounded loaves  and put in a greased loaf pan. Let dough double in size in the loaf pans. Then bake in the oven @ 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Turned out beautifully delicious!

We love this bread!  I substitute 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup white flour and 1/3 c. oat bran for the white flour. I also add a an additional 1/4 tsp yeast and 1/2 tsp sugar for a fluffier loaf. I use the bread machine and set it to "dough" and then form it into a loaf and put it in a loaf pan. Let rise for another 30 minutes and then bake. Easy and Excellent!  Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent. I did use olive oil instead of vegetable oil because I didn't have any on hand. The bread was very moist and also plenty fluffy! I used an Oster bread maker.

Tried this recipe for the first time last week when I ran out of bread and decided to save some money and make my own. I am an avid user of honey, especially raw honey for health reasons, and came across this wonderful recipe. It was so easy to put together! I followed a lot of the advice about using melted butter in place of the oil, which I did. I chose to use unsalted Irish butter (Kerrygold), and it made it so moist and extra delicious. I also decided to add some extra oomph to the bread by adding ground flax seed to the flour measurements. That gave it a nice little nutty flavor and I am very happy with the results. I am currently making another loaf since the other one didn't last long at all (and I live alone). I highly recommend this bread to everyone who loves a nice change from everyday white bread. I love this recipe!!!

I'm re-reviewing this recipe.  I still love the texture and flavor of this bread but I don;t care for the hard crust from being baked in the bread machine.  So, I've been setting the bread maker to the dough cycle, removing the dough, breaking it into 9 even pieces and placing the doughballs into a 9x9 pan.  I Let them rise for about an hour or so, brush with butter (or don't) and bake for 10 min at 350.   Soft and fluffy!

My machine has the option to do a 1.5 or 2lb loaf so I doubled the recipe for a 2lb loaf. 10 min into the bake cycle the bread was touching the top of the machine! What did I do wrong?

Love this one. Yum!  I followed recommendations of other comments. This is the closest thing to store-bought I've made in terms of texture. But it was softer, tastes better, & without all the preservatives. Making this a regular thing in our house!

Disaster! I followed the recipe exactly but the loaf was a soggy mess.  The bottom half was almost completely uncooked, the top half had risen then collapsed. Shame as I was really looking forward to this one. Not sure if I will have another go as am not sure what to change...

Loved the bread! I hate when people do this, change the recipe, but it did add some dough enhancer ingredients. Stayed fresh a week. It's just me and I don't eat much bread so one loaf is perfect.

I think this is a good foolproof recipe.  The small size is perfect of a day or two.  It has a chewy consistency which is great with butter and a drizzle of honey.

This was only my fourth loaf of bread that I made in my new bread machine and it came out great.  The bread was done just minutes before my meal was done and I sliced it hot out of the bread machine.  There was only a few slices left after dinner; everyone loved it!  It was soft, moist, flavorful, sweet smelling, and the texture was perfect.  I will definitely be making this one frequently.  The only thing I'm going to change is put the oats in my food processor to chop them up before adding them to the machine, after the bread cooled down there were little spots of oats that were a little tough.

I've been looking for a wheat or multigrain bread. Saw this and after reading other reviews, tweaked it into my perfect bread. Used 3/4 c rolled oats, 3/4 c whole wheat flour, 1-1/3 c bread flour,  and added 3 tbsp vital wheat gluten. Rest same as recipe. I am sure the recipe is wonderful as is but I haven't made it that way yet. But will soon so I can rate the real thing. Just had to share because my tweaks made this exactly what I've been searching for!

This was an excellent recipe! I made it as a gift for my in-laws to go with some strawberry jam I made. It was a huge hit! It was very easy to make and works well with the delay function on my bread maker too. I've been told that I need to make this bread again.

I had no honey on hand, so I replaced it 1:1 with brown sugar and it worked very well. I also used olive oil instead of canola oil and it made no difference (AKA no olive taste); I think I'll try coconut oil next time and see if it adds a light coconut flavour. I also just noticed that the recipe called for bread flour. I used all-purpose flour. Oh, and I made a 2lb loaf.

This bread is excellent.  I have made it two days in a row.  I did use one cup of white whole wheat flour and the rest bread flour.  It is such a moist loaf with just the right amount of sweetness.  I will be making this often.

I increased the servings from 10 to 15 which gave me a 1 1/2 pound loaf and it baked perfectly! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Fabulous! Comes out perfect every time. I do dough cycle in my bread machine and then bake in a loaf pan. Moist, soft, light bread. I make this all the time now.

This was a hit with my husband and I.  I am going to try less honey next time and subbing some whole wheat flour for the bread flour just to make it healthier; it needs no alterations though!

Five-PLUS stars!! It's soft, moist, and DELICIOUS! Great texture, too! It's become, literally, my "daily bread." This loaf makes me glad I DIDN'T get rid of my bread machine after all! I've tweaked the recipe only a little to suit my personal taste. Instead of bread flour, I use all-purpose. Instead of vegetable oil, I use extra light-tasting olive oil, and, I cut back on the honey just a TINY bit because the full quarter cup was a tad too sweet for me. As I've said, these changes are just a matter of personal preference.

Made this yesterday and it is delicious!! The only changes I made were using whole wheat bread flour, and added a quarter cup of fresh ground flax seed(both for added nutritional value). Turned out perfect and completely guilt free!! Will definetly make again and again, Thanks!

I'm new to bread baking and have found my gold standard!  On my second loaf of this bread.  It is absolutely delicious.  Next time, I will try the alternate version and use butter instead of oil. Then on my next batch, I will substitute some of the bread flour with wheat.  This bread is so good!

A wonderful recipe.  Very easy.  I placed the ingredients in my bread machine as listed and the loaf turned out perfect.  It's a recipe I will make again and again.  Even my mother, who has always made her own bread, liked this recipe!

GREAT recipe!  Didn't use a bread machine, doubled the recipe for two loaves, and it turned out beautifully at 350 for 35 min.  The only thing I will try next time is cutting the honey by half.  Great texture.  Was a hit!

Holy Cow! This is some good bread. Not entirely sure what my review can add that the other 250+ haven't already said, but after I had this, I knew I had a duty to say something. The only alteration I made was to use 1 cup of whole wheat flour in with 1 1/3 cups of white. I also don't use bread flour, just plain old unbleached all purpose. But man is this delish!! Normally I find bread from the bread machine not as good the next day, but this definitely keeps. One note, though. I baked this on the light crust setting and it was still a tad gooey in the center. Not so bad as to render this inedible, but definitely enough that next time, I'll probably go ahead for medium crust. Because there most definitely WILL be a next time. And soon!

OMG - - - - OMG x2 - - - made exactly as directed except let rise in machine, took out, punched down, let rise in 9x5" bread pan again for 1 hr, baked @ 350 for 35 minutes.  This bread is without a doubt the most wonderful bread I have ever tasted.  Don't change a thing and TY TY TY!  If I could give this 10 stars, I would.

This was delicious!  Some the scratch recipes I've tried haven't risen very well or had the best texture but this was just about perfect.  Light, tasty.....I used butter instead of oil and added 1 TBL of dry milk powder.  And I didn't measure the honey exactly and used the light crust setting on my machine.  Will definiltey make again - maybe tomorrow!

This is a wonderful recipe! I modified it a bit though: I used 1 tablespoon of melted butter in place of the vegetable oil; I used sugar free honey (I have diabetics in my family); I used 2 cups of all-purpose flour and 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour; I added 1 tablespoon of Splenda brown sugar substitute; and I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of bread machine yeast. I set my machine to the dough cycle, and after it was finished, I kneaded the bread slightly and divided it into two loaves. I then further divided the dough into two more parts each, and braided each loaf. I let the 2 loaves raise for about another hour. Then I melted 3 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of sugar free honey and brushed it over the loaves. I sprinkled the loaves with oats and baked at 375 degrees for about 35 minutes. Everyone LOVED this bread, and it was all gone at the end of the meal! My fiance was even eating up all of the oats that fell off the top when we cut the bread! Thank you Merrilee for a great recipe!

We thought this was okay but way too sweet for us, even for our children who love honey.  I must say that the texture was superb which is why I am giving it three stars.  It was much better as toast.

I make this pretty regularly. It is a pretty forgiving recipe. I've made it as is and it's great, also have used brown sugar instead of honey when I'm out. Have used whole wheat flour in place of part of the bread flour with good results as well. I always make it on dough setting then turn into a pan and let rise, bake off at 350 for about a half hour.

I have only had a bread machine for a few months so am not an expert. I made this recipe yesterday and followed the recipe exactly, execept I added 1 TBS vital wheat gluten. This bread is so far, my favorite! It was light and just slightly sweet. Very yummy and I will make this bread often!

Since I strive to make my bread recipes as whole-grain as possible, I reduced the bread flour to 1/3 C and used whole wheat flour to balance out the rest. Set the machine for Basic, light crust and it turned out great.

YUMMY!! My loaf was a little dense, but I'm not sure if that's because I did half bread flour and half wheat. Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly to see if there's a difference. Would defintely make it again!

Fan-freakin'-tastic.  I am a new bread baker, and I made this two weeks in a row, it was so good.  I made it the semi-traditional way, proofing the yeast in a bowl and mixing and kneading with my Kitchenaid.  I definitely recommend the addition of a bit of whole wheat flour.  I used steel-cut oats as they were all I had about the house, and they just melted into the bread.  Man.  I want some now!

I doubled the honey for some extra sweetness and 1.5 cups oats (extra fiber boost).  I really like this better than the regular white bread recipes out there.  You don't even notice the oats because they cook into the bread.  I prepared this in my bread machine with the following settings: basic setting, light crust, and 1.5 pound loaf.  I turned off my bread machine when there were 7 minutes left in baking because I like mine a bit doughy.

Very good! I substituted a cup whole wheat flour for some of the bread flour and it was wonderful. The bread itself was a bit more rustic than I was expecting, but it was a good surprise! I will certainly make it again.

Update: 2016. This is STILL our daily bread recipe. I now bake this in the oven instead of the bread machine. I use a 9" Pain De Mie (Pullman) pan. Cover with plastic wrap, let rise till crown almost touches top, put lid on, bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Remove lid, bake 5 more minutes.
Notes:
1.use quick oats. if you use old fashioned you will need to increase the flour to 2 1/2 cups.
2. I replace a 1/3 of a cup of bread flour with whole wheat. when I replace  2/3 of a cup, I start having issues with rising without adding vital wheat gluten and more yeast.
3. I prefer to use Pillsbury bread flour for a more airy loaf. if I use King Arthur all purpose flour or bread flour I get a very dense loaf. 
4. if I use warm milk or warm water with milk powder I get a softer bread than just using warm water.

Original 2009 review:
 this has become our favorite bread recipe. for our everyday bread i replace a 1/3C b.flour with whole wheat. i bake on 1lb light or else its too dark and too thick crusted. for a supper light and airy bread heat the water to 110, otherwords 80 degrees is just right. our friends ask for this bread!

This recipe was very soupy! I have now made it 3 times and it needs more flour and more yeast. Making it exactly as specifed gives you a non-risen lump. I have added maybe 1/2 cup of flour (didn't measure, just kept adding until I saw a doughy texture like it SHOULD be) and an extra tsp of yeast. Now it has risen and looks great. I have no idea how the 4-5 star people got this to come out right with this recipe!

Very good bread.  We used our bread machine to make the dough then just plopped it onto a floured pizza peel to rise for about 30 minutes while we preheated our pizza stone in the oven.  We then cooked it for about 15-20 minutes I believe. 

Its a great, slightly sweet, bread.  It would make an awesome sandwich.

This is dangerously delicious and easy.  It has a potent smell and taste of honey. Very good! Next time I think I'll substitute some of the flour with wheat flour.

Even my picky eater loves this bread, which I have been making at least weekly since I got my first bead machine a couple of months ago. I have been replacing 1/3 C of the  bread flour with oat flour and 1 TB of the oats with flax meal and this variation has a nice look and texture and is really delicious.

Dangerously delicious!  This is the main bread I make in my bread machine, and have been doing so for almost 2 years.  I usually split flour like so:  1&1/3 cup white, 1 cup wheat bread flours. Today I cooked in my oven for the 1st time. I changed servings to 15 to make a 2lb loaf. I mixed in machine, but took out after 2nd rise, split in 1/2, placed in loaf pans, let rise another 35min, then cooked in oven at 350 for 35min.  PERFECTO!

Turned out excellent, wouldn't change a thing!  I changed nothing, and it was light, bubbly, chewy, and almost too big for my bread machine once it rose!  Next time I will try whole wheat flour in place of some of the bread flour, it seems like it would only make this delicious bread even better.

I did not have a bread machine so I put all the ingredients in my food processor and then put it in a greased loaf pan in the oven @150-200 with a pan of water. After it doubled in size I then baked it at 325 till it turned golden brown. Was delicious, perfectly sweet and not to dense.

This is probably the best bread recipe I have found at this site so far...  Followed the recipe exactly, except for only using the dough setting on the bread machine.  I put the dough in a loaf pan, let it rise, then baked at 350 for 30 minutes like someone else suggested.  Fantastic taste and texture.  I've made it twice already!  Thank you for sharing.

tried this recipe for the first time,I had to change ingredients to metric because we have a british Kenwood 250 and live in england, this bread came out perfect, it was so delicious and was ready for when I came home from work, I won't change a thing with the recipe, it was so good I have made it again and the second time came out better.

Good basic honey-oat bread - fluffy and moist. It is definitely on the sweet side, so I might experiment with the honey. I doubled the yeast based on some of the reviews and I'm glad I did. I'm making a second batch this morning :-)

Our favorite bread recipe yet for our bread machine. I used the butter rather than the oil. Best one we've used for toasting, sandwiches and snacking.

we've made this in the bread machine twice now & it has been a huge hit!  it makes a great sandwich, a tasty snack with a bit of butter, next stop is french toast!  we substituted whole wheat for half the flour, and all purpose flour for the other half, as i  was out of bread flour. we also tried the 15 servings as ours is a 2lb machine & it was the perfect size.  yum!

I have been serching for a bread with a good density...I've finally found it!  This bread is fabulous!  I'm a big fan of Pepperidge Farms Farm House Soft Oatmeal and I gotta tell you this is very close to it.  My only complaint is with my bread machine, it browned the outsides too much, but I'm one of these people that won't take the time to mix and need the dough, so next time I make this I'll just use the dough cycle and then bake it in the oven!  Thanks so very much for this delish bread!

Changed loaf size to 15 servings, this was perfect for two pound bread machine.
The loaf was tall in the machine, about 2 inches away from top of bread maker. The bread was  soft, moist, and a medium textured bread. Will Make again.

Wow. Possibly the best bread machine recipe I've ever had. I have a convection bread machine and it tends to make very thick crusts. Anyway, with this recipe it wasn't too bad! I even used the delay cycle and it still turned out perfectly. I also used salted butter instead of oil, and once it was out of the machine I rubbed the crust with some butter to help it soften. I also used a heaping teaspoon of yeast, and 1/4 teaspoon of powdered ginger to a)keep the yeast working and b)help preserve the loaf. That amount of ginger doesn't affect the flavor. So far, it's the only non-totally white bread I can get my DH to eat. Thanks!

This is my favorite bread to make.  It is also foolproof.  You can truly put all the ingredients in your bread machine and walk away.  No adding anything.  Most other breads I need to check to make sure it doesn't need more flour or liquids.  
I have gotten rave reviews whenever I make it.  The taste can't be beat.  
I can't go to my in-laws without bringing a loaf.

I adore this bread! Soft, just a little bit of chew ... and a light nutty sweet taste. I've made it Over and Over and everyone that's tried it has melted! Great warm with a simple spread of butter on a thick slice. Heavenly.

Good and soft.  This 1 pound loaf was fine in a 1 1/2 pound minimum bread machine with the basic bread setting and light crust setting.  Followed ingredients to the letter.  Not my favorite, but it is a good healthy snacking bread.

I only have two breads in my recipe box, and this is one of them.  It's simple (you don't need 50 obscure ingredients) and delicious - interior fluffy and soft, pleasant sweet aftertaste, filling, and healthy!

Of course, this isn't exactly healthy, what with all the refined flour, but it's totally yummy. Like the recipes says, it's soft and just slightly sweet. I think you could replace a little of the white flour with whole wheat without affecting the taste very much.

This is a FABULOUS bread recipe! I was worried about using such a small amount of yeast but I followed the directions exactly & it was great! 
We ate half the loaf while it was warm & I had to start slapping hands so we would have some for the next day! Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great bread! Makes me feel like I am fixing something healty for my family to eat. It took a couple of times to get it right for my 2 lb loaf machine, but now that I have it figured out, I make it often. Even my husband, who doesn't like the sweeter breads, loves this one.

Six stars for this one!
I have been making this recipe for quite some time now, and it is one of my family's favorites.  I use 3 cups of flour, though, and often a generous teaspoon of yeast.  The results are awesome.

This bread is wonderful.  I did add about 1/2 cup of flour and 1/4 more oatmeal so it wasn't so gooey.  I also increased the yeast by 1/4 teaspoon since the oats make it a heavy bread.  Turned out great we go through a loaf every other day!

Superb bread. I used only 3/4 tsp salt and increased the flour by 2/3 cup after reading the other reviews and it came out great. I can eliminate the jelly on my toast by using this bread. Less calories.It will be one of our favorites from now on. Thanks recipe .com.

I have baked bread for over 25 years. I fixed this bread yesterday (4-15-00) . . my husband has commented several times on how good it is. This morning he has not even had a piece and commented that it was the "best bread you've ever made!" I am in awe. I have tried fatihfully to cook 'healthy' for about 2 months now. Added 1 cup of whole wheat flour to replace one of the cups of bread flour. This is a great bread! Thanx!!~~ joy.h

Best recipe ever! Not only does it taste amazing, it's also easy to make. 

Make sure to select the option for a 900g / 2lb loaf for best results.

The first time I made this bread it puffed up too much so I changed the flour to AP which produced a tighter texture more to my liking.  I noted the dough ball was very wet and sticking to the side of the pan during mixing so I paused the cycle and sprinkled some flour on the dough, about 1 tablespoon, and pushed the dough off the side with a spatula.  Next time I will leave it alone and see what happens.  I set my machine to 1 lb, light crust, basic white setting.  The bread is soft and chewy.  The crust is not too dark, and soft on top.   It makes great toast.

As my Oster machine requires, liquids first. Unlike instructions, I make the yeast go before I add dry ingredients.
water
oil
1 tsp sugar
yeast (prove)
1/4 c honey
1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats 
1/2 cup whole oat flour (not stuff with bran removed)
1/8 cup oat bran
2 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour 
1 tsp salt
dash ginger powder 
(I always "ginger it up" when baking with honey)

Fresh out of the machine, now nibbling on my second slice before bed!

100% by hand by necessity; no mixer with paddle, no bread machine. Used a rounded teaspoon of yeast and instead of honey which I didn't have, used the packet of "pancake syrup" from a fast food restaurant.  Will update directions soon. Excellent - delicious - thank you!

Made this in my new Zojirushi Virtuoso Plus. I used half unbleached bread flour, half white whole wheat, and honey in place of molasses. Set the crust to light and removed the loaf as soon as it was done, cooled on a rack and lightly covered with a heavy kitchen towel, so that it would cool slowly and not harden the crust. Results: a perfect, Golden-brown 1.5 lb loaf, with a nutty, slightly sweet taste. The size of the slices makes them perfect for sandwiches, too. Thanks for this recipe, it will be the basis for many delightful variations!

This bread is delicious and I will make it again.  It's light and fluffy, yet has substance when you chew.  I made only two tiny changes--used 1 1/2 teaspoons of yeast, as many suggested.  Used 2 cups of bread flour and 1/3 cup of White Whole Wheat flour, along with 1 teaspoon of Vital Wheat Gluten to lighten up the wheat flour.   Up to now, I've only used the Dough setting on my bread machine, afraid to bake in the machine since my first loaf burned.  This time I used the Sweet Bread setting, as suggested by another reviewer, which helps to keep bread with high amounts of sugar from burning.   Even with a Light Crust setting, I still got slightly burned bottom and sides, so next time I'll cut the baking time short by about 5 minutes.  This bread is worth experimenting until I get it right!

EDIT:  After using the Sweet Bread setting, Light Crust, and cutting 25 minutes from the baking time (problem with my machine), I was so happy with this bread.  I've made it many times.

This dough reminds me of our grandfathers’s batter bread. I did add about a half cup more bread flour than the recipe called for as it was sticking to the paddles in my bread machine. I used the dough setting and then turned it out and divided into two loaves. I have eight inch bread pans and it made two perfect loaves. It has a nice chew and makes wonderful toast. I used old fashioned oats and I didn’t grind them st all, just used them right out of the box. Next time I am going to try 1/2 bread flour and 1/2 white whole wheat flour!!

This is pretty much the only bread I make in my bread machine now; my family might revolt if I try something new. I’ve tweaked it for my own tastes. Milk instead of water, softened butter diced up instead of oil, increase yeast and increase flour to around 2.5 cups. My favorite bread!

This is actually one of my favorite recipes, very tasty and moist.  I add extra seeds, flax, sesame etc.   BUT  I am annoyed with the lack of actual instructions on this and most of the bread recipes on this site.  Throw the ingredients in the bread machine is not baking instructions, it is a footnote.

I followed instructions from another reviewer and used my kitchen aid to mix the dough and then baked it in the oven. I kept the ingredients the same except I used all purpose flour. My family loves it and I've made it several times. A great recipe for new bread makers.

This was the first recipe I made in my bread machine when I received it as a gift several years ago. It's still the only recipe I make. When my family wants fresh bread this is what they ask for. I have to make several consecutive loaves because the first one disappears in a matter of hours. This recipe is so simple and the flavor is unparalleled. This is a recipe to be shared with generations to come.

Super good recipe! Flavorful, slightly sweet, hearty - yet plain enough that my white bread-loving kids ate it up like crazy. One slight modification: reduced salt to 3/4 tsp, knowing my bread machine (Oster) is prone to not having heartier breads rise enough. Turned out great.

I've made this sooo many time. I always use the doigh setting and bake in a loaf pan (350f for 30 minutes). It is beautiful, and still soft the next day. I like to use it to make french toast sticks! Yum. It's also a very good dough for rolls.

This was wonderful without any tinkering. I mixed it on the dough cycle and finished in the oven. I'm interested in turning this into rolls and trying it as french toast, as well. Thank you!

This is my go-to bread machine recipe. 
Everyone always loves this bread and I’m selling a couple loaves today:) It turns out best if you oil it after taking it out of the bread machine and then store in a paper bag. Since there are no preservatives use this bread within a few days. Also makes great croutons or crustini if it’s a few days old.

Turned out great!  Made it exactly as written except added raisins.  Made on light crust setting in my new bread maker.  Will make again.

Really loved it. Did equal parts of wheat flour and regular flour. Add in of chopped pecans, walnuts, and extra chopped oatmeal. It was a bit dense. When I make it again, I will cut back on the flour by 1/2 cup. Great taste. Really loved it.

I made this recipe as is and it is really, really good. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and a nice density to it that makes it so filling and wonderful. We've been eating slices with soup this winter and love it.

This bread couldn’t be easier to make in a bread machine!   It’s tender and moist with a crusty crust.  The honey makes it slightly sweet and delicious!

We really enjoyed this bread. I don't have a bread machine so I used the KA to knead the dough and then let it rise for about an hour, punched it down and formed it into a round loaf that I let rise for another 40 minutes.  I subbed in one cup of whole wheat flour and added a heaping tablespoon of vital wheat gluten.  I baked the loaf for 30 minutes @ 350.

I was concerned about the water to flour ratio, but it all worked out in the end! It produced a nice chewy inside with a very light crust I was very Impressed! 1.5 setting on my machine, and in Phoenix Arizona I used 2 extra tablespoons of flour.

This is the best bread that has come out of my breadmaker!  It rose well, the crust was beautiful, and the bread was wonderful right out of the machine.  I didn't make any changes in the recipe, other than the 'generous' teaspoon of yeast.  I also fixed it according to my machine's directions, which adds liquids first, followed by dry ingredients, with yeast going in last.

Made it today and used wheat flour and 1% milk instead of the water. Came a bit dense but very tasty. I also added 3 packets of Stevia just to make it a bit sweater to counterbalance the nuttiness of the wheat flour. Super simple to make.

I used another reviewers measurements for a 2lb loaf because that's what my bread machine makes.  Definitely use the light crust setting because my bread maker defaults to medium and the crust is a little tough.  Will probably make again but tweak the recipe more next time.  Overall it came out tender on the inside with a pleasant mildly sweet flavor.

I followed the recipe , except I scaled it to 15 servings to get a 2 pound loaf. My machine has a horizontal pan so I found that the loaf was very high when baked it in the machine . It was really just ok. the end piece was a bit doughy, maybe baking in the oven would have been better. I didn't notice the oatmeal in it at all. I will keep looking for others to try . I don't think I will make this one again .

Followed some of the recommendations. Use melted butter instead of oil, used 2 cups bread flour and 1/3 c of whole wheat pastry flour (what I had on hand), and heaping tsp of yeast. Loaf was a huge hit and didn't even last 24 hours

OH SO GOOD!  So easy to just put in the bread machine and push the button.  I did add 2 tsp. vital wheat gluten as I didn't have bread flour.  That was my only change.  It had just the right sweetness and the texture was awesome.   If you use the right ingredients and measure correctly, I don't know how you can go wrong.   Thank you Merrilee for sharing your recipe!

Wow so delicious! I'm on my 2nd loaf. I have a Sunbeam machine, and the first round was on the basic setting. The second loaf was on the sandwich setting, and it was so much better! It doesn't rise as much as I'd like, but that's just me being picky. I will be making this over and over!

I made this recipe using 3/4 cup water and 1/4 cup milk,  but no other changes.  I love the bread, it is one of the  few that I have found that I can eat without toasting.  I will be making it frequently.

I've made this several times and my family and I LOVE it. I don't bake it in the bread machine, but use the dough setting and take the dough out. I then bake in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.

Eta: makes great hamburger buns! Just shaped into little rolls. I bake them squished together in a pan, like cinnamon rolls.

As suggested by another reviewer, I added 2 t wheat gluten and used 1/2 wheat flour. It makes a decent loaf of bread, but nothing extraordinary.
I have a very similar recipe that uses almost the same ingredients but a cut up banana instead of the milled oats. I like it better than this one....try it!

The only change I made to this recipe was all purpose flour because I didn't have bread flour. I was a bit anxious to make it. The bread was delicious, moist, dense, perfect for sandwiches and toast. Right this minute I am making bread pudding with the leftover chunk! That recipe is also off of All recipes site!!!

This is the easiest and best recipe I have ever made in my bread machine. I HAD to use All-purpose flour (all I had) but I don't usually change a recipe on the first try.  Have made it 4 times and it is great!

It was delicious with the changes I made. I don't have a bread machine and made it like other bread dough (proofing the yeast, kneading, etc.). I one and a halved the recipe and only used 3Tbsps of honey, but it was still slightly sweet. I also substituted melted butter for oil. After letting the dough rise for about 45 minutes, I put balls of dough into greased muffin tins, then let these rise about 30 mins and baked them as rolls (it made 1 1/2 dozen, so the regular recipe should make 1 dozen). Perfect accompaniment for soup or any meal. I know it would make great bread for toast or sandwiches. It would be too sweet for me as the recipe is written, though.

Baked this today with the exact recipe. Made the perfect 1 lb loaf. No changes needed. Only problem is that we went through the 1st loaf so quickly that I had to make another one!

I am anxious to make this again.  It is all that others claimed it to be.  I would have been happier if I had read the review that indicated it wasn't a 2 lb loaf size.  I've starting using my bread maker for the first step and my oven proof option on my oven for the second step to wonderful preservative free bread. Before I read the review about the size of the loaf,  I tried making two loaves so they were much smaller than I had hoped they would be.  Regardless, this is very very good bread no matter what the size loaf you make!  :)

I've made this recipe a few times, adjusting it (adjust servings to 15 for proper measures) for my 2 lb machine. I replaced 1/2 cup of the water with milk which improved the loaf overall the 2nd time I made it. I also ground half of the oats as per a previous suggestion. I have used both honey and molasses and both are great in this recipe. We love it for sandwiches.

Yum! Used butter instead of vegetable oil and half self-rising and half bread flour because I was running low. I also used skim milk for added flavor. I only made the dough in the machine but baked in the oven, I just prefer the texture of doing it this way. Bread still came out delicious, moist, a little chewy and very lightly sweet. Amazing!!

Perfect sandwich bread. Only homemade bread that is still fluffy day 3! I substituted 1 c of flour for 1 c white whole wheat flour (and added a tiny bit of water to compensate). I also don't have quick oats, so I did half old fashioned oats and half baby oatmeal cereal. My family loves this bread.

This is a staple at my house! I do a few variations. I swap olive oil instead of vegetable oil and use a regular oatmeal packets (even flavored) for the rolled oats. My kids think it's fun to use the dinosaur eggs. ;)  It just adds variation to the taste and the family devours it. If I use a flavored one, I just reduce the honey a little. But as is, the recipe is delicious.

This was excellent, I made the recipe mostly as shown but with a couple of minor changes. I used melted butter instead of oil and also substituted about  a cup of flour with oat bran. My whole family loved it, will definitely make this again!

Amazing!! I followed the recipe as stated - except I changed the oil to butter. Next time I'm sprinkling honey on the top before it's done baking. Took an hour and it was gone!! I wish I could upload pictures.

So good! Have made many times.   I double the yeast, and added another 1/4 cup of oatmeal.  I also set my bread machine on dough setting and form into oval loaf , let rise , covered, for another 30- 40 mins. Then bake at 350 degrees until brown.

Omg!!! I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. It is fabulous! I have made this three times in 10 days. The first time I made it exactly as written and it was pretty darn good. The next time I made a few modifications so the whole family could enjoy it and to up the whole grains. Here are the changes;
*Pure maple syrup instead of honey (1:1 ratio) so the baby could have some. 
*Butter instead of oil (1:1 ratio) because I like the taste of butter more than oil. 
*1/2 cup  and 1/3 cup of whole wheat bread flour. 
*1 and 1/2 cup of unbleached, white, wheat bread flour. 
*and lastly I brushed about a TBLSP of melted butter on the crust right when I took it out of the bread maker. This resulted in the softest crust I have ever had on a bread maker loaf of bread. Seriously!! 
The bread was just as delicious the next day. I don't know about the day after that because it was all gone.

I recently bought a bread maker and have tried numerous recipes.  This is by far the best one I've found yet!!  SO GOOD!!  The only change I made was to add 1-1/2 tsp. of yeast....oh, and make sure to use warm water.  Also, just for my preference, I subbed 1 cup of white flour for whole wheat.  I threw all the ingredients into the bread maker and selected the dough cycle.  Took out, rolled out the air, placed in a baking pan and let rise for 1-1/2 hours.  Baked at 355°F til the inside of the loaf reached 190°F (approximately 35 minutes).  Amazing!!!!

This bread was awesome, moist and soft, super easy. Made a 2lb loaf by setting the servings to 15. Used 2tsp yeast a little more than the recipe said. Also set the bread machine to light crust. The loaf was done at 3pm and gone by morning. I would definitely make it again.

Awesome! I liked this bread very much! I just mixed white and wheat flour (2 cups white flour and 1/3 wheat flour). Thanks  for the good recipe!

Love this bread! Perfect texture (even though I just used all-purpose unbleached flour).  Just a hint of sweetness.  Delicious with a smattering of peanut butter.  I can see why the recipe poster goes through a loaf a day! I will be making this very, very often!!!!

I liked this bread. It was tasty. It is soft and a little sweet. More of a dinner type bread than for sandwiches, unless looking for a sweeter taste with a sandwich. It does have that classic bread machine taste though. I was hoping for more of a homemade bread taste, which I have gotten with other bread machine recipes. I am finally able to understand many of these bread recipes on this site and how they will work with my Zojirushi bread machine. Note the amount of pounds the loaf states on the recipe. My machine makes 1.5 or 2lb standard loaves only. It does not make 1lb loaves. So, I did 1.5 times the recipe and it worked perfect size wise. I just used the changed servings button and changed it to 15 servings. I got 16 slices of bread using my Presto bread slicing guide at 159 calories per slice. I did use the basic setting and light crust as suggested. My only change was subbing 1 cup of the bread flour with Gold Medal's white whole wheat flour and right before the baking on the machine started I sprinkled some rolled oats on the top for garnish.

Sooo delicious! I definitely recommend doubling the recipe because the quantity is pretty small for a bread maker. I set my machine to 1.5 lbs (there is a 1.5 or 2.5 option) and it still seemed like I needed a little more dough.  Recipe is delicious though!

This bread is the best I have tried yet, and I don't plan to look any further!  I use my kitchen aid because I make 2 loaves at a time and it won't fit in my bread machine.  I let the honey, warm water and yeast sit for about 5 min before adding everything else in the mixing bowl.  I use the dough hook and let it go on the lowest setting for 5 min, adding flour as it goes until the dough doesn't stick to the sides.  Then I let it rise for 30min to 1 hour (doubled in size), punch it down, divide into 2 loaf pans and let it rise another 30 min- 1 hour(the size I want my loaf).  I bake it at 350 for 30 min.  Thanks!!

Did great in a donated Breadman TR444 bread maker that's been hard to get to produce a good loaf.  For sweetener I used 1 T molasses, 3 T honey; sub'd 1/3 C whole wheat flour; the rest used King Arthur unbleached white bread flour; added 1 T water; used water warm; added 4 t gluten.  1.5 lb white bread medium setting.

Just made this for the second time. It's a great all-around bread recipe. Good for sandwiches, toast, and eating with butter. I'll make it regularly. The one pound loaf is a good size for sandwiches.

I've made using this recipe as a guide. I first made the recipe three different times in a bread machine, varying from exactly to almost exactly as written (higher oat:flour ratio, more honey etc.), and got delicious but extremely dense bread every time. The texture was not at all OK for sandwiches or toast. It became misshapen basically immediately after cooling and cutting it into neat slices was impossible. We still devoured it, but it was ugly enough that I wouldn't serve it to guests!

Today I finally got the loaf to exactly the right texture. I doubled the yeast (2 tsp) and definitely recommend trying that. In the past, I had also used extra honey because I like this as more of a sweet dinner bread than for sandwiches. It tastes good with 1/4 cup, but if you like more of that sweet roll flavor in a loaf, go for about 1/3 cup.

I use the white bread/medium crust setting on my bread machine. Do NOT use the quick cycle, especially without the added yeast. It needs that extra hour!

This recipe was good. I followed the recipe as written. I set the bread machine on the dough cycle. Once completed, I then removed the dough and punched it down a few times to remove the air. I formed it to fit into my bread pan, covered it, and let it rise for an hour and a half. I baked it for about 35 minutes until the top was golden brown.

I really liked this recipe.  I was so happy at how flavorful it was even though it didn't include any dairy or eggs.  My younger boys can't have any butter, milk or eggs in their diet so this worked out beautifully!  I followed the recipe exactly and I am making it again today!  I might add a little more oatmeal and a little less flour to see how this affects the flavor/texture.

What a great recipe! Made this for the first time and my family loved it! A nice change from plain white bread :) I don't own a bread machine so I followed the instructions left by another reviewer. The bread turned out wonderful, although I think i will make a honey glaze to coat the top of it next time.

This bread was good, but it had a very sweet taste to me. But I'm diabetic so some stuff does taste too sweet to me. It cooks up really good tho. If you like your bread sweet you'll like this one. I'm giving it a 3 because of the sweetness. But it is a very good bread. I give this to a friend of mine.

Awesome recipe!! I usually have whole wheat flour on hand but didn't so I used ground oats as half the flour. I didn't have oil either so I used butter like in one of my other recipes. I also used 1 1/2 tsp of yeast. I like that this recipe uses honey and not sugar. Hubby and daughter loved it and wanted more. It is not sweet and was a little dense and this was a small loaf.

Great recipe, turned out just fine. I used avocado oil for the oil. We don't use canola or corn oil because it is all GMO (genetically modified). I also substituted half oat flour and half spelt flour instead of what was called for. It was wonderful. I'm going to make another loaf right now and double the recipe. Maybe I'll try all oat flour this time.

Very tasty, soft bread.  The oats really do disappear into the loaf.  My only critique is that the loaf is REALLY soft and doesn't hold up well after slicing.  If you want a lovely loaf of bread to eat by itself or as toast, this is a great recipe, but I would not recommend using it for sandwiches.

This bread was really great. I added a little bit of cinnamon and it had a wonderful flavor. Next time, I will probably add raisins to make a breakfast bread. Thanks for the recipe.

I just got my bread machine not too long ago. This is my third or fourth recipe I have tried and it is a winner!  My husband said this is the best one, and so we will be using it as our go to for our main bread for sandwiches and such. I followed the recipe as directed for the first loaf I made and it came out beautifully. My machine can make a 2 lb loaf so I increased the serving size to 15 as another reviewer suggested and it made a perfect loaf for my machine. I will be making this weekly for now on.
UPDATE: I decided to try making the dough in the bread machine and then baking this in the oven.  It was pure heaven!  So delicious! My son and I ate through half a loaf as soon as it was out of the oven and on the cooling rack.

Amazing recipe, this is a Sunday tradition in my family.  We love it as is, but for an extra special treat I throw in 2 T chia seeds to give it a little nutty flavor, it's a huge hit!

This is by far the best bread machine bread I've tried so far. I used the sweet bread setting on my 1.5 lb bread machine since I don't have a light crust setting. It turned out scrumptiously delicious!

I made this for the first time last night. It turned out amazing not too dense yet super moist. I'll be making this my go to bread. I used a DAK bread machine and it's the first time I've had any good bread come of it.

This bread is delicious! I made it in the bread maker on the homemade setting. I had it bake it at 355 degrees for 45 minutes and it came out perfect. The crust was thin and soft. So yummy!!!

I modified the recipe as follows to produce the most AMAZING seven-grain bread:  the flour should be 1 cup (organic) seven grain and 1 1/3 cups (organic) all-purpose flour.  Then I added almost 1/2 cup roasted, unsalted sunflower seeds and another tablespoon of water.  My mother dissolved in praises, so this modified version will be a staple among my recipes!

Just finished several slices of this and it's my new go-to bread machine bread. Used half whole wheat and half white flour and added some wheat gluten to compensate for my lack of bread flour. I also had to add a little more flour (and I added an extra tablespoon of oats) to keep it from being sticky. It turned out soft and lovely, with just the right amount of sweetness. Add me to the list of people who will be making this regularly!

Worked fine for me; only changes I made were baking it in a bread pan in the oven and doing an egg wash and sprinkling oatmeal over the top before baking.

I made this with a stand mixer rather than a bread machine.  My only other change was only using 1/8 cup of honey and that was strictly for personal taste.  It rose beautifully, baked up light, fluffy, and flavor able at 350F for 35 minutes.  After eating this you will never bother with store bought oat bread again.  thanks, Merrilee!

This bread is fantastic. The texture and taste are excellent. Slightly sweet with a nice oatmeal taste. Homemade bread usually gets stale very quickly (I guess because there are no preservatives), but this bread was very fresh and delicious 3 days after I made it. A definite keeper!!

I thought this bread was very good.  Following other reviewers advice, I changed the servings to 15 for my 2lb bread machine.  I shouldn't have done this because it made too much bread.  I followed the ingredients exactly and I didn't think that the bread was too sweet at all.  I served this warm with butter and everyone loved it.

This is my new go to bread recipe! Fantastic! My advice on how to change it: at least double it because one loaf will not be enough! :)

FWIW I didn't use a bread machine, I use a Bosch- other reviewers go through the process.

Made a flour modification as I only have 50/50 (ww/white) and had no bread flour.   I added 1/2 teaspoon vital wheat gluten because I was worried it wouldn't rise.  It came  out of the machine perfectly.  And was gone in about an hour.  Made another loaf the next day so everyone could have some...it lasted about an hour.   Great easy recipe.

I double the recipe in the bread machine and then last rise in bake in two loaf pans. I use molasses instead of honey for a richer taste. I add vital wheat gluten. Egg the tops and add raw oatmeal and it makes a showstopper by taste and looks.

Not sweet enough to be a sweet bread, and too sweet to be a regular bread. That said, it is pretty good with honey and butter on top!

Good flavor, but for some reason it baked too long which made it almost burn to the pan, so I couldn't really get it out of the bread machine.  I never have had that problem before.  Next time I will end the process a little early.  I also want to try making into rolls as another reviewer commented.

I love this bread!  This is my first review so bear with me!  I am new to bread making but I mixed this up in my Kitchen Aid stand mixer, letting the dough hook do most of the work.  Then I kneaded it for a couple minutes on the counter.  The first time I made it I doubled the recipe, used only all purpose flour and added about 1/3 cup of ground flax.  This made one loaf and 8 mini loaves.  The results were great!  The bread was dense and moist, the crust wasn't overly crusty, just the way I like it.  After reading one reviewers comments on how she adds wheat gluten to AP flour rather than buy bread flour I tried to find wheat gluten at the grocery store but was unable to.  So the second time I made the bread I did everything the same, maybe I added a bit more flour as I was feeling cocky due to my past success and I wasn't being as careful with the measuring.  Again, the bread turned out wonderful.  My kids and I love it lightly toasted with peanut butter in the morning.   I'm still going to be on the lookout for wheat gluten because I am curious to see what effect it has but honestly, I love the way this bread has turned out using the all purpose flour.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't change this recipe a bit- this is perfect bread! Seriously soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. My kids loved it alone...then we tried it with pumpkin butter and that was great too. A new fave!!

This is THE Best tasting homemade bread yet!!  I double the recipe, mix it in my bread maker, then split it into 3 loaves and cook.  I make at least once a week, my family LOVES it!  If they are all home when it comes out of the oven, the first loaf is gone that evening!   Thanks for the great recipe.  Hasn't failed me yet and I've been making it for weeks now!

I made this exactly as directed. The bread itself is very good. Light and airy, and very much like store bought bread. However, the crust is thick and crunchy, with kind of a chewy texture. I am not too crazy about the crust, but this might be a bread machine thing.

This is absolutely wonderful as it is.  We tried a variation of this by adding 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon with the dry ingredients and added 1 1/2 cups dried mixed fruit (cranberries, blueberries, cherries and strawberries)  and upped the honey to 5 oz.  The aroma is to die for!

This bread is the best!!! I did add 1 T brown sugar like one reviewer said and I use 1 c whole wheat flour.  I can't make it fast enough for my very picky kids.  Thanks.  My bread machine will be working overtime although I do the actual bake in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes.

not good, not the lightest bread i try . i have high expectation for this but turn out a dense bread. but too dense but not as light as i like or hope too. i like the other recipes that i try from this site too. it also have oats but very different texture that one is very light and have a very nice crust.

Perfect as a compliment to our stew tonight.  Tastes even better when topped with butter and, or course, some honey.

Nice soft bread with a tender crumb and just the right amount of sweetness.  Did not use a bread machine and I will admit I was worried when it didn't rise in 60 minutes as I thought it should.  Luckily, all it needed was another hour (and some patience on my part).

I thought this was pretty good. I used milk in place of water. It made a fairly small loaf, which is fine for my family of four. It was gone within 24 hours.

Loved this bread!! The family loved it as well. I tried it the way it was written, and I also made a loaf with 2/3 whole wheat, and 1/3 white flour. Also added a couple tsp cinnamon. Wonderful! I would say no house should be without a loaf of this. Thank you so much for this recipe!!!

I loved this bread! I used the oven instead of bread machine and I sprinkled a little bit of oats and some honey on top. It rose and baked easily and looked wonderful. I usually mess anything with yeast up. Goes great with chicken salad for a sweet and salty taste. Will be making this again soon.

So delicious and so simple!  I love this bread. It smells so good while it bakes, you cannot wait to try it warm from the bread machine.  I have already shared this recipe with family and got rave reviews back. I followed the recipe exactly.

I made this bread for the farmer's market every week throughout the summer and had people coming back each week to purchase again and again!  I let the bread machine do all the hard work and then took it out and baked it in the oven!

This was a wonderful bread.  I used apple sauce instead of oil, and I split the flour between bread flour and white whole wheat flour.  I also added a couple teaspoons of gluten, and had a bit of a free hand with the honey.  This was a very good, soft bread with a nice crust.

I have tried so many bread recipes in my bread machine and this one was perfect! I will be making this for days to come. Instead of all water I did 1/2 milk  So moist. Great for Sandwiches and toast.

I really enjoy this recipe, it is wonderful.  I also mix it in my bread machine, then I shape the dough into loaves on a baking stone, let it rise one last time and bake it in the oven.  I get lots of great comments when I bake this!

I really do love this recipe! It's my go to bread recipe. I mix it in my bread maker, but then I move it to a loaf pan & let it raise. If I leave it in my bread maker, it doesn't raise enough and I am left with a very dense & small loaf (although it is still delicious).

What a WONDERFUL bread! The flavour is incredible and it rises really well. If your bread machine has variable size settings, do use the 1-1/2 pound setting as it rises up surprisingly high. I think this is my new favourite bread machine recipe.

I have made this bread twice a week for 2 months now.  I no longer buy store bought bread.   Everyone loves my bread and my grandchildren all comment about how "great" their sandwiches taste.  I always make the bread exactly as the receipe states, but I think I will begin trying with some whole wheat flour.  I let the machine go thru the dough phase and then rise once.  I then take it out and put in my pan to rise the second time.  Thanks so much for the "best" bread..so easy.

This bread is great!  I made it in the oven rather than the machine.  I think 2 small loaf pans would have been better than one 9x5, but it still tastes so good. My kids love it too because it has a slight sweetness to it.  Can cut very thin slices to make it last. I also used a little less than 1/2 whole wheat flour. It was a little dense, but the flavor is good. I'm determined to find a fluffy wheat bread!

This bread is so delicious!  Light and airy - I couldn't stop eating it!  The crust is so nice and has a hint of sweetness.  This bread goes with anything!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Great taste! It came out a little dense and crumbly but that was my bad because I was hesitant about adding the full amount of water to the dough. Next time I'll add all the water called for and I'm sure it will be perfect. I also used applesauce instead of the shortening. One more thing, I doubled the recipe to make a larger loaf. The original recipe might be enough for small families, but my family likes our bread!!! Thanks Merrilee!

Pretty good start to a great bread.  I doubled the honey and oatmeal.  I also upped the yeast to 1.5 tsp and added 1 tsp gluten.  Super bread!  My kiddos love this as a daily bread for sandwiches and whatnot.

This bread was great.  I just made it this morning.  I put the ingredients in my breadmaker last night and used the delay timer feature so the bread was ready at 6:30am.  The bread came out excellent.  This is the 1st time I have liked bread baked in my breadmaker.  I've tried several other recipes and I didn't care for any of them.  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in this recipe and added a little extra flour and yeast per recommendations from other reviews.

This is an easy, awesome bread recipe! I double the recipe and make the dough in the bread maker. Then I bake the loaves in the oven for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees. Super EASY!

Good flavor and texture, just not my type of bread. My mother-in-law loves it though. She has had me make it a couple of times for her.

I have now made this bread 3 times.  It took me the third time to figure out that the reason the bread wasn't rising much was because the recipe is for a 1 lb loaf.  So on the third try I made a 1.5 lb loaf and it turned out perfect.  I have changed it up every time a little bit.  I have tried butter instead of oil but now discovered coconut oil and am going to be using that from now on.  I also throw in 1 or 2 tbs. of flax seed.  It's going to be our regular sandwich bread for the week from now on.

Started this recipe late last night. It finished about midnight. The whole loaf was gone at breakfast the next morning. My 13 y.o. said it tasted like something from Great Harvest.  Now have second loaf mixing in the machine. Thanks!

The first time I made this bread, taste was good, but didn't rise and was very dense (made by hand).  Second time I used the bread machine (dough setting) and let rise again in loaf pans - excellent.  Third time I forgot the oat mixture (2 hours), was very thick like oatmeal, so I thought there would not be enough liquid and the dough would be too dry.  I continued anyway (the bread machine did struggle a little), and this was by far the best loaf (I did add a little extra flour, a few drops of water).

This is an excellent family recipe.  My 4yr old and 2yr old both loved this bread and requested another loaf immediately.  I did substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour for white flour to add a bit more nutrition.  It makes the bread a little heavier and nuttier in flavor.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

This is the best bread machine recipe I have used to date!  It turns out so good.  The whole family loves it and we are making it at least every second day.  Excellent for sandwiches, toast and ideal with soup or stew.  Jamie

I used milk instead of water. And I soaked the oatmeal in the milk for about 30 minutes before putting it in the bread maker.

This is THE BEST bread!  I always just use regular all purpose unbleached flour, a heaping measure of oatmeal and 1.5 tsp of yeast.  It has not yet failed me.  We love this stuff fresh out of the bread maker!!

We loved this bread!  I changed the servings to 15 and ended up with 2 medium size loaves - just perfect, 1 to keep, 1 to share!  A few little changes: I did decrease the honey to 1/4 cup as other reviewers mentioned that it ended up too sweet, used 2 1/2 cups reg. flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour (next time will decrease the flour - ended up needing to add more water), and increased the yeast to 2 tsp.  Used the dough cycle on my machine, but decreased the rise time by 15 min. as the dough had reached the top of the machine (oops, might rethink increasing the yeast!).  Formed 2 med. loaves and let rise a second time for 20 minutes.  Baked for 30-35 min. at 350 degrees.  I'm sure my husband will be requesting this one again!

This is a bit too sweet for me, but it got the thumbs up from the bf, so that's good enough for me.  I know I'll be making it again and again for him.  I did add 3 tbs of wheat glutin, which I may or may not do again.  It was a very large loaf in my bread machine as a result.  I also did change to 15 servings, however, as I have a 2 lb machine and some reviews seemed to indicate it wouldn't work as well with the written serving sizes. Worked fine as written and if I take out some of the honey I'll probably love it as much as the bf does.  Thanks!

My favorite bread recipe yet.  I use 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 1/3 cup of white flour for nutritional purposes.  Love it, kids and hubby loves it also.  They eat it at least twice a week for breakfast with fruit on the side.  I set it up the night before with the timer and when I wake I smell fresh bread.  Gotta love that!!!

Like many others, this delicious bread has become a household staple. I changed the scale from 10 to 15 servings and it consistently produces a nice, large loaf in my bread maker - and perfectly baked, too! As recommended by others, I've switched to using whole wheat flour and I think I'll try substituting the oil for butter next time around. Though it's a matter of personal preference, I also add  a bit of extra honey... mmm! A fresh loaf of this bread is one of the best things to wake up to at 6:45 on a weekday morning.

The taste of this bread was WONDERFUL! However, I had a problem with the texture. It was extremely crumbly even though I followed the directions exactly. I couldn't slice it for sandwiches, but we still picked at it because it tastes so good! Hmm...next time I'll try to add more water/less flour or something.

not bad! im still trying to figure out how my german bread maker works so i think if i make this a few more times it will be better. for some reason, the loaf was super small and hardly rose...so i think next time i will try 2 tsp of yeast like others suggested to see if that helps. thanks for the recipe!

Soft, good & easy to make. I love the hint of honey in the bread. The only change I made was I used canola oil instead of vegetable oil since that is what I had. This will become one of our favorites to make.

I used whole wheat flour instead of white and I added more oats. This bread was good. I unplugged the bread machine before the bake cycle was finish because this loaf was smaller than the standard bread machine loaf, but it was perfect for sandwiches.I also used olive oil.This will be the recipe I use for my whole wheat bread from now on.

Not quite sure what to say about this recipe. My partner absolutely loved it and said that it was possibly "the best bread that he had ever tasted". Personally I found it too dense and a little bit too sweet for my taste. Will more than likely try this recipe again, although next time I will only use half the honey.

This has become the staple bread in our house. The oats and honey make it more natural and healthy than breads with sugars, but it doesn't have much pizazz.

Excellent bread, very moist and light.  Used others recommendation of 15 servings on dough setting.  Used half in 2 mini loaf pans and froze the other half for later use.  Baked about 25 minutes. Another great recipe from AllRecipes.  I love this site!! Thanks!!

I made some changes to the recipe. I only used half of the honey needed and replaced the rest with brown sugar since I didn't have enough. Instead of rolled oats, I used oatmeal which I had lying around. I also increased the amount of yeast by 1/2 tsp and added 1/4 cup of wheatgerm. It turned out too heavy for my liking. I don't know why. Is it because I added wheatgerm? Or maybe because I used oatmeal? The dough doubled in size but would it be lighter if I let it proof for longer?? The flavour was not bad though. I MIGHT try it again.

Awesome bread! I followed the suggestion of Booey4U and changed the serving size to 15 for my Zojirushi.  Perfect. I used a basic course and light crust setting.  Next time I will use a medium crust setting as it was a little too light.  Also added a scant 1/4 c. more flour and 1/4 tsp. additional yeast.  Thanks for submitting, Merrilee.  This is a definite keeper.

This bread was absolutely great tasting bread. Mine however did not rise that much. Does anyone else have that problem? I think I will try more yeast next time. The taste was good though everyone in my house loved it and that is hard to do with 6 of us, usually someone doesnt like something that I have made. 
Thank You allrecipe for this wonderful site I use it all the time.

I really enjoyed this bread.  It is so easy to make and really delicious.  Many years ago I made a simular bread in coffee cans.  I believe this is lighter, but still has great texture.  I have made it several times since finding this recipe and will probably make it several times a week. Heck, when fresh bread is this easy, one can enjoy it everyday!

Wonderful recipe. I use the dough cycle and then shape it and bake in a regular bread pan. I do use 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of yeast. It is a very forgiving recipe. I actually forgot the yeast and added it on the second kneading in my machine and it still came out perfect. Thanks for a great loaf of bread.

I have made this bread several times in a bread machine and MOST of the time it turns out.  Needs to be a temperature on the water.  Other than the different size in loaf each time, bread taste very good.

Don't know what happened, but it didn't rise & even though it was set on "medium" it didn't cook all the way through. Smelled good tho. Probably will not try it again.

I'm experimenting with my new bread machine and have tried various other recipes but this one really stands out.  My husband says it tastes better than storebought and I've made it three times in the last two days.  Really great recipes.  Thanks

Great bread recipe!  I added a little flour because the dough seemed sticky.  My daughter asks for this bread all the time.

This bread is one of my favorites that I have used on this web page.  Very moist and not overly sweet.  Makes great toast.

Using this recipe, I turned out the very best loaf of bread so far since getting a breadmachine for Christmas!  The taste is delicious and the texture is moist.  As with every loaf of bread I've made in my breadmachine,the sides and bottom of the bread are harder than I desire even on the lightest crust setting.  I'm beginning to think it must be the brand of machine I own.

Wow, what a great recipe! Slightly sweet, definitely moreish, especially straight out of the bread machine/oven. Works well for sandwiches and fantastic as toast. This will definitely become a regular in my house.

Wonderful recipe.  Great bread for sandwiches or with dinner.  This bread tastes great even days after being baked. The only modification I made was adding a few more tablespoons of flour to the dough since it looked a little "wet."

Possibly the best bread I've ever tried. It is moist and chewy without being too dense, and has the right amount of sweetness.  I did as suggested by another reviewer and used 1-1/2 tsp. yeast instead of 1 tsp.  I added slightly more salt in addition.  It is great on its own.

Just finished this and its great.  I wanted a full whole wheat recipe so risked it by adding 3T  Gluten.  This may have been a tad too much due to side top split some.  However very moist,dense bread and no top caving. Yeah! By the way - its a bit rough on the machine as its a heavy recipe some hopping about on the counter but sill a great recipe.

It smells really good but it didn't work out for me. I only gave 3 stars because I am not going to be able to eat the bread, which is still in the bread machine. I have a 1 and a half to 2 lb machine and I tried to double the recipe, which didn't work. The bread is all over the top of the machine. I will try to make it again next week but only half the additional amounts.

Really good flavor, with just a hint of honey so the bread wasn't overly sweet.
The only drawback is you may have to play with the breadmachine settings.  My loaf was underdone using the cook time indicated in the recipe.  I think a medium or even a dark crust would have been perfect (about 10 - 15 minutes longer than light crust).  Also note, the recipe calls for "rolled oats."  I've heard of this before, but have never seen it/looked for it in the grocery store.  I used regular Quaker Oats and the flavor was fine...in fact, I'm not sure what the difference is, if any, between rolled oats and oats used for oatmeal.  I will make this again, but will alter the cook time.

This was the very first recipe that I put in my recipe box.  That was in April 2000.  But I never made it because I did not have a bread machine.  
I finally got a bread machine this Christmas and have made 3 loaves of this bread.  Easy to make.  Delicious!!!  Try it, you'll love it!
(I made the 3rd loaf yesterday and it's almost gone!)  Thank you Merrilee.

This bread has a fabulous flavor, but ended up being slightly underdone, and a little *too* moist for my taste.  I wish I had read some of the other reviews first!  I will be making it again, and I'll try some of the modifications suggested.

Takes a while to cook.  It took me three times before I actually cooked it for long enough. The first two tries were still pretty doughy in the middle!

After reading all the great reviews on this recipe, I couldn't wait to try it. I don't know what happened, I followed the recipe, but my bread was a complete bomb!! It did not rise, it tasted terrible, and was a complete flop....It went down the dispose all....

Recipe was easy, and turned out great!!  The dough seemed watery, but bread was a nice texture.  Good on its own or as a sandwich.

This bread was very good, although I had to add about 2/3 of a cup more flour than called for.  It was very watery.

This is a great recipe!  The loaf didn't last long after it came out of the pan.  Great with butter melting on it warm out of the oven. However, watch the water content and add a bit of flour if it is too batter-y; I also decreased salt to 1/2 teaspoon as I thought it tasted too "salty".

please check water amount, bread was very watery during cooking, and came out very dense at end of cooking time.  This recipe has a create smell and flavor, but I believe this amount of honey made it quite dense.

The whole loaf was gone shortly after it was made.  I guess that is a sign that it was good!

This bread was FABULOUS.  At first I was apprehensive, and thought that
there was a typo in the recipe.  Looking into my bread machine, the dough
was not merely extra moist.  It was a downright wet "batter", as opposed to
a dough.  Yet, I decided to let the bread machine do it's thing, and was I
ever surprised at the results.  The flavor was excellent, but what I was
most impressed with, was the texture.  Although the bread rose nice and
high, the texture was wonderfully chewy and firm textured.  This particular
bread was also excellent, after it was completely cooled.  I just want to
thank you, Merrilee, for submitting that recipe.
Sincerely yours,
Jeff

This was very easy and very good.I'm wondering if you could use apple juice instead of just water for a little more flavor.

I used 1 tablespoon margarine instead
of the oil...worked great!!  I had
friends rate this bread as well; it's
a definite winner.
