They were mushy - and I followed this recipe to a tee.  However, the reason this isn't a one star recipe is because the flavor is great.  I will probably apply the flavor to a real CRISPY sweet potato fries recipe.

Because I read the comments  to this recipe BEFORE cooking these absolutely flavorful sweet potato fries,  too avoid mushiness, I: cut pototoes big, boiked only 2 minutes&  skipped the steaming. They werent mushy but still a lil soft but delicious!

These were flavorful and we liked them (and my husband is not really a huge fan of sweet potatoes) but mine turned out too soft and were falling apart in the pan.  By time I served them they were somewhere between fries and mashed potatoes. I know for sure that I forgot the step of rinsing the potatoes with cold water after boiling them, but I don't know if that is the full reason by they came out so soft, as they were already falling apart a little when I drained them.  I think next time I will boil for less time and/or cut my fries just a but bigger. I had mine with ketchup.
