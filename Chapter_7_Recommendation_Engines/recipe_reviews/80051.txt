I made this and shared it with some coworkers and it was a huge success! I used about 2 pounds bulk Italian sausage and about 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef. My daughter didn't think it looked too good but tried it anyway and went back for more!  I will definitely be making this again.

As written this casserole makes a lot!  At 2-3 times a day, this pretty much lasted me all week.  But it's good.  I used regular ground pork.  Would have been even better if I had preseasoned it as suggested.  Italian sausage would have been amazing.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  Next time I'll use it as a stuffing for Cornish game hen and add some dried cranberrys to it.

My husband loves this dish. This dish freezes well too.  I made a few edits, changes and additions.  No bacon.  About 1 pound ground seasoned pork is fine (add italian seasoning to pork and mix if not seasoned).  Use about 3-4 chopped celerly and 3-4 chopped carrots, use fresh mushrooms, add a cup or more of chopped broccoli, a tablespoon or so of minced garlic, only about a cup and a half of half & half, I don't add the almonds (though they probably go well) or the diced pimentos (don't have those usually).  To give it a kick I add some white pepper.  Yummy!

Since I'm a vegetarian, we omitted the meat in this and also added some Italian seasonings to make up for the flavor. The boyfriend and I found that some of the recipe was vague, particularly the direction about adding the flour to the "remaining butter" which was quite hard and ended up with me straining out the lumps of flour. It might be better to just add the flour after you put in the half and half while stirring, but that is just something we ran into. It was super delicious. We served it with mashed parsnips and cornbread.

I usually give some leftovers to my elderly neighbour...today my family asked me not to...fortunately there was plenty left for tomorrow and my neighbour loved it. I did sub the pork for grilled chicken, it's what I had, 4 cups of chicken broth not 6 of water, 3 cups of whole milk and 1 of sour cream not 1/2 & 1/2, again it's what I had. I also made homemade mushroom soup (doesn't take that long to make) and fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Slightly healthier but equally delicious! I also added 3/4 cup dry white wine.

Excellent recipe.  Used regular mushrooms and saut√©ed them with the onions and celery.  Added chicken broth to the half-half. Used ground pork and did my own seasonings with salt, pepper, garlic powder.  Freezes well!!

This was really a good basic meal to use up the left over ground pork. I only used 1/2 pound ground pork and 1 cup rice. I also used fresh mushrooms. Hubby and I were content with it, but not blown away. I am sure we will make again.

Way too rich to have as a casserole.  Flavor is delicious but too heavy to eat as the main dish

It was okay.  If you are a fan of sausage.  But as a side dish leave It out.
