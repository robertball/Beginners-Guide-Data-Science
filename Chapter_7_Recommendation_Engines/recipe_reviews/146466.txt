Wow!  I made this exactly as directed.  EXTREMELY easy, cheap, healthy, and delicious dinner.  Literally took me 5 minutes to prepare.  Only added a dollop of sour cream and served w/ chips and salsa.  Husband and kids (3 yr old and 1 yr old) cleaned their bowls.  I wish every recipe was this easy and good.  I have made much more time consuming black bean soup recipes that did not taste as good.  Even emailed recipe to friends.

This is a fantastic recipe! It reminds me of the black bean soup they serve at Panera Bread. I doubled the recipe, which I would recommend doing if you are serving more than 3 people, just to be sure you have enough. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly. I used Bush's brand beans - 1 regular, 1 low sodium, and 2 seasoned. I rinsed off the beans from the 2 cans that I ran through the food processor, which I think helped to make it not too salty. Whatever you do, do not add any salt or else this could easily become too salty. I like a more uniform texture to my soup, so I added the salsa to the beans in the food processor. With cornbread, this is a complete meal. We didn't add sour cream or cheese and it was still great - although those would definitely add another great dimension. Will be making this again! :)

Great go to recipe for a busy day. I cooked simmered it and reduced the sauce for a thicker broth. I also added the corn, but felt it needed a little more flavor. I addd a tsp. of dried cilantro and a little extra virgin olive oil at the end. Before serving I added a splash of dry sherry. Yummy, I will make it again. I bet it will be even better tomorrow.

Pretty good as is.  I added some sweet corn to it for some color and substance.

Wow--this was so satisfyingly good, and it couldn't be easier, so this is going in my regular soup rotation! I wanted it as a meal, so I cubed two chicken breasts and cooked them with the salsa, seasonings, and chicken broth before adding the black bean mixture.

I made this before and didn't care for it but my 7 year old daughter begged for it so I made it again and I LOVED it. I used 3- 26oz cans. I used a blender to mash up 1 1/2 cans keeping the liquid in with the beans. Make sure to mash them up really good. This is the mistake I made by not mashing them up enough. Now that I think of it we didn't add cheese or onions the first time either and did this next time! Made a big difference. We also had a bit of leftover fresh very small diced pieces of jalapeno and added that which gave it some extra spice. Incredible taste! Used Bush's brand as well.

A member of my small group brought this to church as a side dish one night... it was so good!  I couldn't wait to make it, and I served it as a side as well.  It is very quick and easy to make and it tastes wonderful.  I added a couple of extra spoonfuls of salsa to ours.  I like adding a bit of shredded cheese and a small dollop of sour cream to my bowlful to make it a bit creamier...mmmm mmmm mmmm!

Very tasty soup. I took other reviewers advice and saut√©ed a finely chopped onion, 3 cloves of garlic, and one finely chopped jalopeno in olive oil before adding the beans. I also used hot salsa and the soup came out very spicy. Cilantro is also a must in my opinion. Works great as a main dish if served with bread.

FLAVORFUL!  But, perhaps a wee bit too salty.  Also, very soupy, which is pleasant.  I so often follow soup recipes that start off soupy, but wind up being a big bowl of mush because there was not enough liquid.  If you're in the mood for soupy, then this is perfect; and if you want more to chew on, there's enough room to add more beans, corn, or other vegetables.

MMMMM!  I sauteed a some onion and garlic first, just for fun, but I think it would still be fine without the additions.  I let it simmer down a bit to thicken up, and then pulsed it a few times with a hand blender.  Sooo good.

I followed the directions as written.  This soup is very good and sooooooo simple to make.  The only change I would make for next time is to add more beans (drained).  I like mine a little less soupy.

I sauteed some yellow onion & garlic at the suggestion of a previous reviewer.  With that and the cilantro, this was a yummy & easy soup!

Yummy!!!  Made this tonight and it was perfect.  I didn't have salsa, so I replaced it with a can of diced green chiles and a can of diced tomatoes. Always looking for a quick and easy recipe -- thank you!!!

This soup is very simple and I like that it's a great base recipe to really make it what you want.  I added green chiles, small onion, a bag of steam fresh corn and 1/2 tsp of dried cilantro.  It's delicious and I can't wait for my husband to try some!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I loved this recipe, and it is super simple to make.  I also thought it was a bit salty, and replaced it with a can of water instead the second time I made it.  I also skipped the chili powder and opted for 1/2 tbsp of cumin and 1/2 tbsp of garlic powder instead. I dusted it with pepper as well.  Lastly, I added onions and carrots to make it a bit heartier.  Overall, this is a great, simple black bean soup recipe.
