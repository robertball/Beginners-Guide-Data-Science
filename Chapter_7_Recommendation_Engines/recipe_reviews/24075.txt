I wish that I could give this just one more star for the sheer indifference it has to calories or fat content.  Oh. My. Goodness.  This was good.  I was in a pinch for bringing a dish to a party and happened to have most of the ingredients for this so I pulled it together, and it's my new favorite recipe.  I did substitute the cream for 2 cups half & half and one cup nonfat evaporated milk (ROFL, that makes it healthier, right?) and I used frozen spinich instead of fresh and I'm sure fresh would make it even better.  I also used diced portobello mushrooms and plain ol' chicken breasts.  Everyone ate this all gone and were fighting for the recipe.  Thanks a ton (and you know where that ton came from ;))

*Edited to add~  I made this again and used fat free half and half and 98% fat free creame of mushroom soup, skim mozzarella and lowfat ricotta, and it tastes just as good as the original.  I also omitted the mushrooms and used sundried tomotoes....yummy!  Still a favorite recipe for special occassions around here.  I've also found it's good to take it out after it's done and let it sit, covered, for a good thirty minutes to thicken up.

This is an excellent recipe.  To overcome the issue with the volume of spinach (I used 1 - 6oz. bag of fresh baby spinach leaves which worked out to be the perfect amount without overwhelming the dish... or kids ~ nice green speckles here and there), I added the spinach to the skillet of sauteed veggies at the last moment before turning off the heat  to slightly wilt the spinach.  This way all of the prepared ingredients fit perfectly into the 9" x 13" dish without the oozing that I've read about in other reviews. I also used a whole medium sized onion and the whole 5oz. package of sliced mushrooms from the produce dept.  This worked out perfectly for flavor, not to mention nothing wasted.  The mushroom slices (as  opposed to chopped) made it a lot easier for my little mushroom hater to pick them out.  Allow the dish to rest at least 15 minutes after removing it from the oven to allow it to settle for easier cutting and serving.  The sauce would be great as a base for other pasta dishes too.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again.  Thanks for posting it!

Although this lasagna is pretty good, I was expecting better after all of the work I put into it. The blandness that others commented on may be because there isn't much salt called for in the recipe. I may try it again with alfredo sauce packets instead because this sauce still tastes like canned cream of mushroom soup to me, even though I followed the directions exactly. The final product was a little runny because, when you put the spinach in fresh and then bake it, it exudes a lot of water into the ricotta layer underneath. In order for this lasagna to be worth the effort, it needs a few changes. But it has potential.

Very good recipe.  I, like others, took the quick way out and used a roasted chicken from walmart and a few jars of my favorite alfredo sauces.  I put the fresh spinach and the mushrooms in the food processor so my kids wouldn't really notice it.  I then put all of that in a pan, along with the chicken, diced tomatoes, chopped onions, and some frozen peas and sauted it with garlic powder, onion powder, adobe, and oregano.  I then added that chicen mixture to the sauce.  THE WHOLE PAN IS GONE!  My kids were fighting over who was going to take leftovers to school.  I had some leftover sauce so I am going to boil some fettucine and make a cassarole with the noodles, sauce, ricotta, and mozzarella.  Can't wait to eat it!

VERY GOOD!   Everyone loved it ages 5 - 70.  I used milk instead of heavy cream and it was still very good.

VERY good,This rich and cheesey dish is fantastic. I will use this simple alfrado sauce alone in the future (drop 1 can of cream of mush. and add 1 can of cream of chicken).The kids and wife could'nt stop raving, thanks.

This is going to be a much repeated recipe.  It is absolutely amazing!!!  It is a bit time consuming so I suggest having company over to enjoy what you spent so much time on.  That way you know your time was worth it because everybody with rave about it.

Wow.  A friend and I combined this with the "spinach and artichoke lasagna" recipe to tone down the richness.  It was so delicious, we couldn't wait to eat leftovers!  Combined with some tomato sauce, it is less heavy.  It is a special occasion dinner for certain!

I made this recipe for a large family gathering and everyone LOVED it! It is time consuming to make, but definitely worth the trouble. The finished product looks and tastes as though it came from a restaurant. Will put in my recipes for special occasions

I had heavy cream, ricotta cheese, & baby spinach that all needed to be used...so I did an ingredient search & came across this recipe.  It was SO good, & I will be making it again.  Such a nice change from normal lasagna!  I did make a change or 2 though from reading other reviews.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom & 1 can cream of chicken.  I also omitted the mushrooms in the dish, but served it alongside 'Mouth Watering Stuffed Mushrooms' from this site.  It was quite a delectable meal, & my whole family enjoyed it...kids & adults alike!

Loved this. As we ate it I couldn't believe I wasn't sitting in a restaurant. My whole family went nuts for this. I did leave out the mushrooms because my family is not a fan and it was terrific. It definitely deserves 5 stars.

I just finished making this and will eat it tomorrow. It looks like it will taste wonderful. One thing to note is the directions and usage of the ricotta. At one point it calls to use half, then the rest, then the remaining? Doesn't add up and I read the thing over and over but didn't catch that error until it called for the non-existant "remaining" ricotta. Oh well, it still looks very good and the way it smells it HAS to be great !

Very awesome, although not nearly enough mushrooms for us. We also found it easy to use bagged spinach to eliminate dirt, because apparently I'm not good at washing spinach. Lol

Tried it tonight and it was delicious. I used 1% milk instead of cream and low sodium low fat cream of mushroom soup. also used low fat mozzarella to make the recipe lower in fat overall. thanks for a yummy new taste brought to our dinner table and great to use for leftover roast chicken!!!

My family loves this lasagna.  They asked that I don't make lasagna with red sauce anymore!  The sauce is very bland so extra spices are necessary.   I don't use ricotta cheese because my family doesn't like it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I felt it was more work than it was worth but my family enjoyed it. I think next time I will cut the sauce recipe in half, using left over chicken, and serve it over fettuccini or angelhair pasta with a fresh spinach salad on the side.

This is tasty, but loaded with calories.  Next time I will use less ricotta and less alfredo sauce because there is simply so much.  I agree with previous reviews that the chicken needs spices while it's cooking.  The alfredo sauce and cheese is quick to overpower the chicken otherwise.

One of the best lasagnas I ever tasted!  Used frozen spinach since that is what I had and just thawed it in the microwave and squeezed out the excess moisture.  Try this one, it's a keeper!

This has great potential but needs something more - I think adding in some Italian seasoning or other spices would really help out the flavor. I didn't have enough cheese and I think that would have helped, but even still...not a recipe I'll make again without quite a bit of adjustment.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  After making it with a store bought chicken and thoroughly enjoying it, I experimented for company and made it with canned red salmon, salad shrimp and a half cup of white wine in the sauce....oh my!  With a romaine salad, garlic bread and white wine, my guests said it was "restaurant worthy"!  Thank you Sue, you've made my rep as a gourmet cook!

I loved this recipe, the minute I saw it I knew that I would have to whip up a version that I could eat! I am severely allergic to cows milk so I made a soy based white sauce made to replace the soup & cream sauce. Veggie Shreds Italian blend cheese replaced the mozzarella and I used goat cheese instead of ricotta. Instead of the mushrooms I used artichoke tapanade and taking advice from sorashell I added sundried tomaotes ~ soooo good!! Thank you for sharing your original recipe.. it was inspirational :)

This was delish.  Let's see, what did I do different.  I only had one cup of cream so I added a container of lite sour cream.  I cooked up some chicken thighs and had a 12 oz package of no cook noodles and 10 oz package of spinach which I did add to the chicken mix to wilt down.  I did misinterpret the layering I guess.  I thought the sauce counted with the layering, so I used half as it said, and then it said to layer again, so I thought that meant to use the other half.  But then it says to top with noodles and then the rest of the sauce, which when I realized there wasn't going to be any the way I was doing it, I made the second layer of sauce a little smaller so I could have a little to top with.  So I guess the sauce wasnt to be included as a layer, my bad.  So I covered with foil in an effort to keep the noodles from drying out.  Regardless this was very good.  It took a good little bit of effort, but it was worth it.  I fixed it for my girl friends and there were no leftovers after one of my friends took the last little piece home to her husband.

This recipe is fantastic!  I always buy the roasted chicken from Sam's when I make this and my recipe turns out wonderful!  *** update ***  This recipe freezes well too.  I made two lasagna's as directed (minus the cheese topping), let them cool and then covered with plastic wrap and froze.  On week later I set the lasagna's out at room temp. for two hours, covered w/cheese and then baked in preheated oven @ 400 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes.  They turned out amazing and were gobbled up fast!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! It is one of my FAVORITE things to make! I've made it for my parents, for friends and neighbors, for famiy get togethers, and for my husband and myself many times. It has become my "famous lasagna". This meal is so delicious, I don't even care about the calorie or fat count! I only do two things differently. I use Roasted Garlic Cream of Mushroom Soup, instead of the plain, and then I omit the garlic cloves. This change makes a yummy difference. The other thing I do differently is I use raw chicken that I cut into cubes. I only do this because I find it more cost efficient than buying a whole roasted chicken, and the raw chicken cooks fully anyways.

This lasagna was wonderful! I used jarred roasted tomato alfredo sauce instead of making my own. I also added some sliced tomatoes. I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker with italian seasoning and shredded it before adding it to the onion-mushroom-tomato-spinach mix. I took this to a friend's house for dinner and everyone raved about it. I like this recipe because you can change it up a bit like I did and still be fairly true to the original. It was not hard to make and the results are truly 5+stars. Really, really delicious! A keeper for this cook!

This lasagna is amazing!! Everyone in my house loved it even my picky 3 year old.  He didn't even realize that he was eating spinach.  I made it with non dairy creamer instead of heavy cream to cut out on the calories and it was very creamy and absolutely delicious!

An outstanding recipe for anyone, although I made it for someone who has an allergy to all dairy and meat protein products.  I used soy mozzarella cheese and it still tasted wonderful.  Very elegant looking and tasting.

I made this for my dad on father’s day. He loves Alfredo and spinach so this was right up his alley. This took a little time to prepare but was Sooooo good and I don’t even like aflredo. I did use a six-cheese blend and increased the amount to 2 cups cheese because I love cheese. I also used a ton more mushrooms than the recipe called for. I did not eat it the same day but let it sit in the fridge and we ate it the next day.  It was easy to make and the sauce didn’t separate in the fridge. I used a whisk and stirred it constantly till the sauce looked great. My dad said no need to leave to go out now he has a chef at home.
I recommend trying it.

I was shocked at how good the alfredo sauce was using canned soup!  I used half and half vs. cream, 1 pkg. frozen spinach squeezed very dry, and boiled chicken breasts on the bone.  I also use ziti or penne instead of lasagna because it is quicker.  I think it could have used a little more salt, so make sure you boil your pasta in salted water.  Very good!  Thanks!

I made this lasagna for a birthday party with 20 guests.  I did not feel I wanted to substitute your recipe, I had to because I forgot a couple things on the shopping trip.  I had to replace heavy cream w. light sour cream and mushrooms w. rehydrated dried shitake mushrooms.  It was a HIT!!!  I'm sure it's a great hit w/out these changes, BUT in case anybody gets in the same situation, this works beautifully.  Thanks for a great recipe Sue! :)

I just made this for the second time and made a few changes. I used frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh. The fresh spinach takes up so much space when you are preparing it, and then cooks to nothing, so I didn't end up with enough spinach last time. One box of the chopped spinach was perfect and allowed me more room for extra noodles. And instead of ricotta, I use cottage cheese which keeps it more moist. I also added one can of diced tomatoes (drained) which added just the extra bit of flavor it needed. It's a wonderful dish and great as leftovers too.

Excellent recipe!!!  Well worth the time.  The sauce is very good and creamy.  What a great way to use those ever-so-popular roasted chickens, however, I made this recipe once for some vegetarian friends and left out the chicken all together.  It was still a delicious dish.

In theory this is overall good!  Just needs some tweaking... the 2 cans of mushroom soup , I will leave out next time. I found the lasagna to have a really strong condensed soup flavor. I will try again, maybe using only one can in some homemade alfredo sauce. thanks

I made this recipe, and it was a great hit. I made a couple of changes though that I think made it better. I used 2 whole bags of fresh spinach, but I chopped the spinach coarsely and  cooked it first until the spinach wilted. Also, instead of 1/2 onion, I used a whole onion, that I chopped in a food processor, then fried. Another change I made was that I used one large package of chopped and ready to cook mushrooms. I think these changes made all the difference. The lasagna that I made had a better appearance than the one in the picture, and I think it's because of the color of the spinach. Another problem I had is that one large package of lasagna made two large pyrex-full lasagnas. Either cook half a package of lasagna, or plan on making it two separate dishes.

crowd favorite..friends keep asking me to make it again!
Instead of cooking the chicken, I use a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken from the supermarket which I clean and pull into pieces.
I also add an extra 1/2 c. of parmasean cheese to the sauce mix along with a pre-mixed Italian seasoning (consisting of MARJORAM, THYME, ROSEMARY, SAVORY, SAGE, OREGANO, AND BASIL)to taste.

I was amazed at how good this was, it tasted like something straight out of an expensive restaurant! My whole family loved it and we have some picky eaters! I only changed a few things, I used frozen (thawed) spinach as opposed to fresh, low fat cream of mushroom soup, and less of the heavy cream (I used 2 cups).

This is an awesome dish. I always add seasonings to any dish that I make. For this one I used garlic powder, onion powder, oregano and basil. I also used garlic alfredo sauce instead of cream of mushroom. Yum Yum. Will be having a Italian dinner party for my parents next mth, this will be on the menu.

Like any good cook, I modified the recipe to make it better according to me, but it's a great idea and wonderful combination. I used whole wheat (no bake)lasagna noodles, 2 jars of Alfredo sauce instead of the cream and soups, frozen spinach that I happened to have cooked the day before (drained) and I mixed an egg and the parmesan with the ricotta just like you would with regular lasagna. I cut up chicken breasts into bite size pieces and sauteed them along with the mushrooms, etc. Then I added the sauce to that combination of vegetables and chicken. Like tradional lasagna I layered noodles, sauce with meat, spinach, ricotta mixture, and then the mozarella cheese.

My son-in-law stopped over the next day and had some and I got a call from my daughter saying she wanted some of whatever he had. I shared some with neighbors who raved about it and requested the recipe. When my husband was eating the leftovers the next day he asked when I was going to make it again! It raised my blood sugar but it sure was good!

I am telling you this was awsome!! Use the rest of the recipe as shown and hey its even quicker and better!! By the way I rated this recipe 5 stars after I used the Bertolli alfredo sauce in the recipe. ENJOY!!!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit! I used shredded chicken breasts instead of a whole roasted chicken - just stick the breasts in your crockpot that morning and it's easier to shred when you start dinner!

I've made this recipe several times now, and have learned that some substitutions can save time and cut a lot of calories and fat.  I was bold and cut the cream completely, using 2% milk instead.  I use one thawed package of chopped frozen spinach instead of fresh (just because I always have it on hand), I use a whole 8 ounces of chopped portabella mushrooms, and 2-3 cans of chicken instead of roasted (who has time for that??)  This recipe is a hit every time, even with the substitutions I make, it is still very rich and delicious.  I've also discovered you really can't use too much mozzarella cheese.  :)

The first time I made this it took me 1 1/2 hours just to make it and another hour to cook.  The second time it took an hour to make cause I knew what I was doing.  Some modification: I use 3-4 chicken breast, 1 10 oz. bag of fresh spinach, 2 cups milk and 1 cup half and half, and more ricotta cheese (don't measure it, just spread it on the layers.  I have given this recipe out numerous times!!  Good with garlic bread.

This recipe tastes just as delicious as it sounds.  I used whole milk instead of cream to lighten it up, used only half the soup to cut the salt, and served it with fresh chopped tomatoes on top.... YUM!  I would recommend letting it stand for about 5 minutes before you cut into it, because it comes out boiling hot, and if it is a little cooler the sauce thickens and the slices stay together better.  It was a huge hit at a family party.  This is definately going into the regular rotation!

This is very good, filling and time consuming.  If you like alfredo sauce then you'll like this. The only substitution that I made was milk in place of cream since I ran out.  If I make this I think I'll try frozen spinach, and maybe sour cream in place of 1/3 or 1/2 of the cream.

YUMMY!!!!!!!!!  Too bad it is so bad for you.  My bf called it "death in a pan"  But it is so good and fairly easy if you purchase a pre-roasted chicken.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  We substituted 2cups of milk and 1 cup sour cream, and cottage cheese for the ricotta to make a lower-fat version with ingredients I had on hand.

I thought it was okay, but that doesn't say much because I am a jalepeno person (I put them on almost everything).  I found it bland, everyone else LOVED it.  I may or may not make it again, it needs a kick to it next time.  If it kills me I am going to find a way to cut corners on the preperation time!  Really though, it is a great recipe.

This one cost a bit more because of the ingredients. However the sauce is a real winner and everyone thinks your a chef with the right touch.  Sue thanks for sharing this winner wished I could look at your private cook book.  :)

I've made this many times and each time it's fantastic. I use more butter and less spinach (ie none) as my husband won't eat anything green. I've also made it with provolone slices, swiss, monteray jack cheese etc - anything on sale I think will melt well. I've always used canned chicken, left over Thanksgiving turkey, and leftover itailan baked chicken - all of which were different twists. Because it is SO time-consuming to make, I will make a large one for dinner and several 2-3 serving ones to freeze. Those has saved me many a time! I even gave several to a friend when she had unexpected company :)

So delicious!  This is a huge hit at church potlucks.  I did make a couple of changes to reduce calories and salt.  I substituted half and half for the cream and used a low sodium cream of mushroom soup.  Also, I used the whole 8 oz. package of mushrooms.  Barilla makes a lasagna that doesn't require pre-boiling - it make this dish incredibly easy to make.  Definitely cover the lasagna with aluminum foil (spray foil with cooking spray to prevent sticking) and remove it at the last 10 minutes.

This was awesome!  We almost made ourselves sick because we didn't want to stop eating.  This was not a hard dish to make at all. I used some fresh mozarella in between the layers with the ricotta.  A must try dish!!!!!

This was excellent.  I didn't have ricotta so I just added cream cheese to the sauce.  I also didn't have mushrooms.  The only problem with this rich dish is that it was greasy in the bottom of the dish from all the fat, even though I used reduced fat cream cheese.  All the same, it's still delicious!

This is definitely not 5 stars. It tasted much like tuna helper (without tuna of course). I think with a different alfredo sauce it could be better. The cream of mushroom soup just gave it a cheap taste. It was just too much work for what it was.

Very delicious, but plan on it taking about 3 hours to finish.  We ate late, but it was worth the wait.  Instead of 3 cups of heavy cream, I used 2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2 and one cup of skim milk.   Also added fresh basil & oregano because I have so much of it. We loved it.

Awesome recipe!  We made minor changes just to cut some (just a little) of the fat.  Used 1 can of lowfat cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of regular.  We poached the chicken for about 2 hours and picked/shredded it.  We used lowfat ricotta cheese.  We used part-skim mozzarella.  We also used 1 9oz bag of prewashed baby spinach with stems picked.  Really good.  Makes a huge amount.  Great for large get togethers.

I wanted to make Lasagna but my Mom was coming to dinner and she is not a fan of red sauce so I was looking for a recipe for Chicken Alfredo and found this. It was the best of both worlds so I decided to try it and YUMMMMMMM! Boy was it a hit! I made just a few small changes by omiting the mushrooms after lots of objections and used wheat pasta to make it a bit more carb friendly, I also bought a rotisserie chicken from Wal-Mart and used it. I will CERTAINLY make this again!

This is an amazing recipe that with some changes quickly made it even better.  I cooked and chopped the spinach to remove some of the moisture from the lasagna.  Also I added another cup of ricotta cheese and mixed it all with the Spinach (Good if you have picky eaters at home). I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to the Alfredo sauce.  I actually  cooked and shredded 3 chicken breasts because in my house we like the chicken more flavorful.
This all adds a little more work to the original recipe but if you find the original recipe lacking in flavor, the changes take it to the next level.

I kinda took a short cut with the recipe.  I chose to use jar Alfredo sauce rather than the heavy cream.  I also used cream of chicken soup and I mixed the spinach with both ricotta and cottage cheeses.  It was really good.

I used Skim Milk mixed with the mushroom soup instead of cream and used frozen chopped spinach (thawed and drained) and it was just as fabulous - with way less fat! I've also added diced up asparagus to the mixture for a few more greens and some extra yummy taste... Oh and can't forget using Spinach lasagna noodles!

I used milk instead of cream to cut back calories and that worked well.  The ricotta is hard to spread by itself, recommend mixing in an egg and some italian spices to make a ricotta mixture instead of glopping of chunks of ricotta.  Make sure to add salt, pepper etc to the chicken.  Could increase the spinach. I used 3 whole chicken breasts, that was more than enough meat.  Overall, very good.

this was very good. though i had to buy a lot ingredients for it and it took some time to prepare. to save a pot i cooked the onions and veg (used a red pepper instead of spinach) first then added all the ingredients for the cream sauce in the same pot. and instead of lasagna i used penne and just tossed everything together before i baked it. i would make this again but next time i think i will just use the cream sauce and chicken and veg without baking it and without the ricotta and mozerella. i felt the sauce was good enough on it's own and it would be fewer ingredients i would need to buy. also next time i will try using milk instead cream to save some calories.

This is a very unique twist on traditional lasagna!  I changed the recipe only to make a healthier version!  I used fresh baby spinach, reduced fat cream of mushroom soup, half and half instead of heavy cream, and reduced fat cheeses.  I also used an Italian flavored local store bought roasted chicken.  I will definitely make this recipe again for my family!

This was a wonderful recipe!  I have used slices of fresh mozarella, and also added bell peppers into the mix. I don't think it was too time consuming but if you are in a pinch for time, just substitute 2-3 jars of alfredo sauce in for the home-made sauce.  Also, as others have mentioned, use a chicken already roasted @ the grocery store.  That way you only have to to a little slicing, dicing, etc. of the veggies and you can just throw it all together.

As I was cooking I kept thinking, "This better be good," as it took over an hour and a half to prepare.  It was not great, certainly not worth the effort and fat/calories that come with it.  I am tempted to try to "redo" this recipe.  I would not use roasted chicken, rather chicken breasts.  I would use half the butter and milk rather than cream.  I was not sure how to define a "fresh bunch of spinach," so I guessed and now realize I needed much more.  Most everyone else loved this, so maybe you will, personally I do not get it.

Wow! Outstanding! I cut the white sauce amounts in half, because I don't like my lasagna too runny. I also used whole milk to reduce the fat. I added sliced black olives and a little fresh ground black pepper, too. My 3 year old and 22 month old even loved it! This one is a keeper! Thanks, Sue!

This lasagna was terrific! I made it for a small dinner party, and everyone loved it! The most time consuming step is shredding the roasted chicken. Per someone's suggestion here, I purchased a chicken that had been already roasted at the grocery store. Since the dinner party was on a week night, I assembled the lasgna the night before. That way, the night of the event, we merely had to pop it in the oven. It came out great! There were a couple of pieces left over, which we had for dinner the next night. That, too, was delicious! We'll definitely be having this again! Thanks so much!

Quite good and easy to make. Eat it all up on the first day though -- much better fresh than as left-overs (which I thought oddly enough tasted like tuna casserole). Guests loved it.

This recipe is labor intensive, but you can make several at once and freeze, then finish baking when they are defrosted.  I've had nothing but rave reviews every time I've served it!

I made a few changes to the recipe. Instead of using grated parmesan cheese, I used shredded parmesan and asiago cheese and added a dash of Italian seasoning.  I had to use a little more cheese though because it tasted too much like milk to me without the extra cheese. I also used a little more cheese on my layers and mixed in the asiago parmesan blend with the mozarella in the middle layer. I'm not a fan of ricotta cheese, so I used cottage cheese instead.

This was easy to put together, and it's decadent.  I wouldn't make it too often because it does require quite a bit of cream.  You can also mix up all the ingredients with spaghetti, and it'd taste just as good.

Thank you! My entire family had seconds! I only made a couple of modifications...I used a rotisserie chicken, omitted the mushrooms (bleck) and used one can each of cream of chicken and celery. I replaced ricotta cheese with cottage cheese. The sauce [itself] is great for other Alfredo recipes.

Very good! I subbed the  heavy cream and cr of mush soup w/ two jars of alfredo sauce (I didn't have h. cream).   Added as advised by others: chopped sundried tomato, extra mushrooms (1~ 8oz package chopped) and extra seasonings.  Plus I used up whole 16 oz container of Ricotta (didn't want to waste it!). Also, I wilted fresh spinach in w/ sauteed mushroom/sundried tomatos/onion/garlic mixture (I didn't cook spinach through).  I mixed this + chicken all together as a layer rather than spinach being seperate.  I also divided this so there would be 3 layers.  Rave reviews by all - young and old at Christmas Eve dinner!!!

So good!!!  All of my guests raved!  I used an entire pkg of pre-sliced mushrooms and it was great.  I also followed the advice of a previous review and used a bag of fresh spinach and it worked perfectly.  I will be making this again for sure...as soon as I burn off the calories from the last time I ate it! ;)

This turned out fantastic! Will make again, for sure. As tam 102602 suggested, I added seasonings and used roasted garlic alfredo sauce. I needed 3 15 ounce jars. It added to the cost, but the flavor was worth it. Also, next time will add more mushrooms, I used baby portabellos.

A big hit with all my friends!  I "lightened" it using a can of fat-free evaporated milk + fat-free half & half in place of heavy cream; fat-free cream of chicken soup concentrate & part-skim ricotta cheese.  Still plenty rich!

This is great! But a little too rich. I may use milk instead of cream like suggested the next time, and since I used no-cook lasagna, should have prepared more sauce, as it wasn't quite enough to cover the top layer, and it ended up a little uncooked.

Followed the great suggestions of several reviewers and made these 'minor' changes:
used 16oz jar of Alfredo sauce mixed with 1 can low fat mushroom soup; diced the garlic, sliced the mushrooms, used 4 skinless breasts (shredded), used 1 1/2 cup ricotta cheese, slightly cooked fresh spinach to wilt stage, used 1/4 cup of dry tomatoes (rehydrated), 1/2 tsp of basil and 1/2 tsp oregano, combined Reggio Percornio cheese with the mozzarella...other than that followed the recipe for a sumptuous meal and rave reviews.

This recipe was delicious!  I did cheat and buy an already roasted chicken from the grocery store to save some time.  It was easy to put together and it tasted wonderful.  The company I had had another type of alfredo lasagna before, but thought this one was better.

I LOVED this recipe, and so did everyone else that tasted it! I've never made a lasagna before, so I went a little crazy with the layers. I had a LOT more spinach and had a few layers of artichoke hearts and chicken sausage. But the end result was Fantastico!

I was so excited to make this, but I should have followed my instincts and not used the cream of mushroom soup. I think I would have preferred this with a more traditional alfredo sauce. It was good, just not spectacular as I was expecting from all of the glowing reviews. I did have to season it up quite a bit too, otherwise I expect it would have been very bland. Thanks, anyways - it is actually much better a couple of days later!

This was actually really good and not too hard to make.  I only used 1 can of cream of chicken and about 2/3 can of cream of celery, as I do not like cream of mushroom.  I only had 2 cups of cream (just regular, not heavy) so used a cup of milk instead and added a little corn starch.  I liked that this didn't taste like your normal condensed soup casserole, but rich like real alfredo.  I also added some garlic to the sauce mixture.

I made this because I wanted something different and I am a big fan of vegtable lasagna. It was big hit in my house. Even the left overs went as fast as the first night. Will be be in my rotation.

I served this for a dinner party and it was a big hit!! I did take the suggestion to add corn starch to thicken up the sauce but otherwise I left everything as it was.  Calories who cares this was very good.

The best 'white' lasagna I've tried so far.  Looks and tastes very good, but I would like to continue to play with the recipe:  cut down on the amount of sauce; cut down on the fat and cholesterol. (01.03.07)

This was SO good! I made it a little healthier by using fat free half and half, 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup, smart balance instead of butter and part skim cheeses. I used some cornstarch to thicken up the sauce a little. My husband and I ate more than half of a pan by ourselves. Will definitely be making again!

Awesome recipe. Used Broccoli instead of spinach, we love broccoli. 
Just a thought .... "al dente" means to cook the noodles until they're just a little soft. It only took 5 minutes for me. If you overcook them, they won't absorb as much liquid when you bake it, and your lasagna  might end up runny,as some have commented on.
I grilled my chicken, then put it in a slow cooker, then shredded it. It added an awesome flavor to the dish, and was worth the effort.

My family couldnt get enough of this dish.  I made a couple of changes.  One was to omit the spinach and use chopped broccoli and diced carrots instead.  I partially cooked them in microwave first. Second was to subsitute the heavy cream with milk as we dont need that extra fat. I also used the frest lasagna sheets to save time.  I covered it for 1 hour, then removed cover, sprinkled with shredded mozarella cheese.  Cook until light golden.  I found the recipe makes a very large pan. Next time I will use two smaller pans and freeze one, as Im a single working mom and want something easy and healthy for the kids.

This was an EXCELLENT base recipe!  I'm not a fan of pure cream sauces, so I made one big change, but other than that this was a great recipe! Instead of the cream of mushroom/heavy cream, I used half a jar of ready made alfredo, along with about a half cup of fresh pesto (I buy it ready made from my grocery store).  The pesto flavor goes really well with the other ingredients in this recipe.

Great recipe!  I used Ragu alfredo and fresh portabello mushrooms.  I've tried making my own alfredo sauce with this one but find the store bought does about the same and MUCH faster.  I often get asked for this recipe.  Thanks for sharing it!!!

Pretty good.  Made some adjustments to lower the fat and suit us: low fat cottage cheese, 2%milk,skim mozza and left out the butter. Had to add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I used 3 chicken breasts, which wasn't enough so I added couple of handfuls of frozen shrimp.  Added some nutmeg and thyme for spice and lots of spinach and mushrooms. Also, use no boil noodles and save yourself a step!

I thought this was okay. It turned out very well, looked delicious for presentation( I added the chopped tomatoes on top)but for my taste, it wasn't that great. I give it 5 stars because it wasn't the recipe's fault that I didn't like it that much. It took some ingredients that I don't normally carry, and it isn't the healthiest meal.So I probably won't make this again. Since I didn't use all of the alfredo sauce, I'm going to use it on noodles, chicken and veggies. I think that it will be good. I recommend using the lowfat half and half, 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and cream of chicken, and putting lots of tomatoes on top. I also used fresh spinach because that is what I had, but the frozen might have been faster. It is worth trying:)

It was good but I've had better...I'm just not sure how to make the better.  I will definatly continue to use this recipe and keep modifying it until I get closer to what I want.  I also did not make the recipe as written, I used two 8x8 pans and divided the recipe between the two.  I used 3 chicken breasts instead of the roaster and milk instead of the heavy cream. I also used one 10oz package of frozen spinach.  Next time I will use 2 packages of spinach, I will try to make the sauce thinner and add 3-4 more cloves of garlic.  But overall its a great recipe to build off of.

This recipe was so so good!  I used non-fat 1/2 and 1/2 for the heavy cream which did not take away from recipe at all.  And I used cheddar cheese because that was all I had at the time. And I used cottage cheese instead of riccotta cheese. Even with the changes it turned out to be fantastic.  I haven't made it with the original ingredients yet so it may be even better.  It was nice to have such a great meal and know that it was about 1/2 the fat.  I will be making this again and again.

I am really impressed with the results of this recipe.  I did, however, change one ingredient.  I substituted four cheese alfredo sauce for the heavy cream.  I love spinach, so I used a bit more than the recipe called for.  It worked really well.  Go easy on the salt.  The flavors blend well by themselves.

Excellent, and let me tell you how good.  My husband and I were installing hard wood floors this week-end.  When we were 3/4 of the way finished, I was bringing the last of the old carpet into the garage when I accidently knocked a picture frame onto our new floor.  It left a huge hole that we couldn't ignore.  To make a long story short, he enjoyed this recipe so much, he said he forgave me for what happen earlier.  Can't beat that.  I will make this again and again.

I made this for some friends and they seem to like it. It was very running though, and I had even added some flour to the sauce to try to thicken it up. I might try this again, but it was alot of work. Not a quick fixer.

I made this for a dinner party at the last minute.  It turned out great.  I replaced the chicken with artichoke hearts, and the mushrooms with celery (due to dietary restrictions).  I think that I will make it this way in the future.  A word of caution, there is a lot of alfredo sauce, so use a larger pan.  I actually needed all of it, so I wouldn't recommend cutting the portion down for a 13 x 9 pan.

This is by far the best recipe on this website!!!  I am so glad that there were such great reviews that inspired me to make this dish!  I added more chicken and spinach and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream.  The suggestion from someone to use a store bought roasted chicken was also a fantastic idea!  I will definitely be making this again!

This was an extremely delicious alfredo lasagna.  I had my in-laws over for dinner and everyone loved it.  I made it months ago and my husband has been requesting it he loved it so much, even though he is lactose intolerant.

Oh my goodness!!  This recipe was awesome.  Made it for dinner on Sunday, had it for lunch at work on Monday.  We're having an Italian theme Christmas open house and I will be serving this with my "standard" lasagne.  Great!

A really good recipe! The garlic was a little overpowering though. I would put in some other herbs because pepper and salt just don't cut it. It could also use a little more spinach. The sauce was amazing! I had just the right amount.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!!  I ommitted the spinach and used broccoli instead.  Used boneless chicken cutlets instead of a roasted chicken.  I used cheddar instead of mozzarella and only used it on the top layer - which cut some of the fat.  
Made a HUGE dish for my family and a personal sized vegetarian version for myself.  It was a bit too creamy, I'll only use 2 1/2 cups of cream and a 1/2 cup of milk next time - and there will be PLENTY of "next times".

Wow!  I rarely make lasagna because I don't care for tomato sauce so I was really happy to see an Alfredo version. The combination of flavors is mouth watering good.  We make this for company dinners now, too, and everybody loves it.

This is a great easy recipe. I changed a few things because I'm not a fan of mushrooms. I used chicken breasts, instead of a whole chicken, replaced the cream of mushroom soup with cream of broccoli & added fresh broccoli instead of mushrooms. Substituted half the mozzarella for cheddar. Oh yeah it's better with cheddar! I'll deff be making this again ????

Just made this, it was good but not nearly enough flavor for my husband and I for the time it took to make. The kids (5 and 1) loved it but that goes to show its was bland enough for them. I would make it again but next time use more herbs and seasonings.

This is the best Lasagna that my husband or I have ever had. The cream sauce really adds the extra 'kick and juiciness' that most lasagna is missing. 
The only thing I did different was use canned spinich because I I forgot to get fresh spinich from the grocery.
Thank you again "Allrecipes" and Sue for another great recipe : -)

We made this for dinner tonight. The cream sauce was bland in my opinion. We made extra sauce and it was still not enough to cover the top layer so it over cooked. Not worth the effort. This is the only recipe I've tried from allrecipes that we have strongly disliked. We actually threw away half of the pan.

5 stars for a unique lasagna.  I added sun dried tomatoes and shitake mushrooms to the chicken mixture as others suggested.  I made the lasagna the morning of a party and kept it in the fridge until about 4 pm.  I added 30 minutes cooking time because I was putting it in the oven cold.  I took another reviewer’s advice and let it sit for 30 minutes after removing from the oven.  It was wonderful - everyone loved it.  I also really liked the fact that I was able to enjoy visiting with my guests as all the prep was done in advance.  Have your guests bring a salad, bread, and wine and you are set for an easy dinner!  This easily fed 6 adults and 2 toddlers with left-overs for days.

I made this yes, it was time consuming.
So, I revamped to make it quicker.
I used jar or packages alfredo like Knorrs, chicken breast, mozzerella cheese instead of spinach I used hatch tomato and green chili to give it a different twist since many people in the family don't like cooked spinach.

Delicious!  Only problem was it overflowed my casserole and spilled into my oven.  Upside, that gave it a fabulous smokey flavor.  Going to try it with bowtie pasta next time (and a bigger baking dish).

I hate to say it, but it did remind me a bit of tuna helper.  It was edible, but definitely not good. Nobody was interested in seeing it twice.  Plus, it was VERY time consuming, especially given the outcome.  Huge waste.  Sorry.

My Fiancé was completely enamored by this dish. It really doesn't take too much time if you buy a pre-roasted chicken from your local grocery store. His favorite food is lasagna and I am now a "Keeper" because of this dish!!!

My husband says to give this 3 stars.  Just made for dinner.  I substituted 2 cans fat free evaporated milk for the heavy cream to make it lower in fat; added a packet of alfredo sauce mix in the sauce as other reviews suggested; and used frozen spinach-well drained.  I thought it was rather tasty and a nice change of pace vs. traditional lasagna.

I made this dish for the first time as a solution to feeding a group of 20 for a special anniversary party.  Though it was not the only main course, it was devoured!  I have since been asked many times to make it anytime our family gets together.  Though I try to make it in moderation due to the abundant fat content, it's a winner every time!

I have made twice now following the recommendations of using cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and cooking the spinach first. I pressed the cooked spinach between paper towels to get the excess moisture out. The second time I made it I put Prego marinara sauce in the center layer and then mushroom alfredo sauce on the others. It was a delicious combination!

This was very good and relatively easy to make. Everyone loved it. The only change I made was to mix the spinach and the ricotta before assembling. The sauce recipe does make alot. It was very good but I might cut back on the sauce just a little next time, just my preference.

We loved this!  Instead of making my own sauce, I cheated and used two packets of the mix and then I did not add mushrooms because my family is not a fan.  It turned out great.

My family doesnt eat anything they arent used to eating. Well i tried something different with this and it was a hit. I followed recipe exactly as is. Everyone had double servings and they even asked to take some home. it did take time to cook but it was worth it.I served it with salad and garlic bread and it was perfect and pleanty of food to feed 10 people and have leftovers.

I made this for my family for easter. I used more mushrooms and spinach and ended up with enough for two lasagnas. Everyone loves it, even with two lasagnas they are already gone! I think I may be making this every Easter!

I followed this recipe to a "T" and wasn't impressed...time consuming is true but for an awesome lasagna that would be okay.  The sauce tasted like Tuna Helper's Creamy Broccoli (without the broccoli and tuna of course).  Not BAD but I could spend less money on a box of Tuna Helper than I did making this...Otherwise the Lasagna did hold up well although it did overflow a lil out of my 9x13 pan - put your lasagna pan on a big cookie sheet and you won't have to clean your oven at least. =)

This recipe was really good. I didnt have the heavy cream or the ricotta cheese, so I used 2 cups of milk and  1/2 cube of cream cheese. Turned out really well. Everyone loved it!  Will make again.

I recently made this recipe for my husband and he loved it!!!!!!! I did as well. I had been waiting to try it and it was well worth the wait! I took the advice of another to make it as a cascerole. I cooked all the ingredients as in the recipe, mixed together and topped with more mozarella cheese. It was amazing! I will definately make this again!

I added additional Italian spices to the chicken mixture and it took a lot longer to prep than 30 mins but maybe because it was my first time.  It also turned out a little runny - next time I will add more Parmesan to the sauce and REALLY DRY my spinach leaves.  Otherwise it was the best lasagna I ever had!

As a few of the others stated in their reviews, it is a bit pricey to make but most lasagnas are.  We own a restaurant and truthfully, this is only the second meal I've made since we moved into our new home almost a year ago.  This lasagna is absolutely delicious.  I would like to try to reduce the amount of fat a bit each time I make it because it was more like 8 servings than 12 so you can bump up the fat per serving even more when the portions are larger.  I would highly recommend this recipe to everyone.  It's not the easiest recipe but definitely worth the effort.  The end result was REALLY good!

This was the best!!!  I used a roasted chicken from Costco and chopped it up.  I also used oven ready lasagna that didn't need to be cooked - just pop them in the oven.  My husband and son (11 yr old) almost at the entire dish.  I will make again and again.  Next time I will use half and half to cut back on calories.  (maybe :-)

Very good recipe. Not as time consuming as I thought it might be. Used 6 oz bag of baby spinach and added to mushroom/onion mixture towards the end of saute process. Used 2C FF half/half plus 1C evaporated milk.

My family and I loved this recipe!  I was so concerned about the amount of moisture from reading other reviews that it ended up being dryer than I wanted.  Next time I won't add any cornstarch, but will let it sit covered for a few minutes after baking.  Also, its easy to spread the ricotta on the noodles by placing the noodles on the counter (like on a paper towel) and spreading it on before placing them into the pan. To make it healthier I cut back on the oil, butter, used 1% instead of cream, healthy choice cream of mushroom, and part skim mozzarella. I seasoned the chicken well, and didn't think it was bland at all (alfredo sauce tends to be a bit on the plain side, so I don't think you can expect something with a lot of kick unless you want to add another flavor to it).  My family has already  requested to have this again soon.

Very nice.  It's very rich, but can also be a bit liquidy.  Make sure to let it sit for a bit before serving and this will solve the problem.  Tastes even better as reheated leftovers...the flavours really have a chance to come out.  I wouldn't exactly call this recipe healthy (3 cups heavy cream), so I only gave it 4 stars.  Absolutely delicious though, I have made it a number of times already.

This lasagna is wonderful and I always get asked for the recipe.  I made some modifications to my liking and of course a little more high in calories.  I added one more can of cream of mushroom.  Instead of fresh spinach I used 2 frozen/chopped spinach thawed and drained.  I also used 2 8oz pkgs of baby bella mushrooms sliced.  And last about 1 1/2 cup of Italian blended cheese mixed with the parmesan and reduced the amount of mozzarella and ricotta.

After reading all the reviews I expected this to have a more powerful taste.  It was good - but definitely not restaurant quality.  I also use half & half instead of heavy cream, which I'm guessing made it a lot less rich (that's good in my opinion!).

This is the my families favorite dinner. Add a salad and some warm bread and you can not get any better.  Whenver my kids get to pick what they want for dinner they choose this.

This was good, but not great. I followed the recipe pretty much to a tee, with the exception of using fat free half and half instead of heavy cream. I don't think the recipe suffered because of it... just needs a little extra spice or something flavorful. I found it a bit bland, but my husband loved it. Go figure!!

I also used half & half, and reduced-fat soup, and frozen spinach as suggested by other reviewers. I think I will add more chopped mushrooms the next time around. I am so impressed with this one. Thank you for sharing!!!

Very very good!  I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream and extra mozzerella cheese instead of ricotta and still turned out excellent.  Also added more spinach and mushrooms.  I have already made this recipie 2 times and I am handing it out to others!!  GO SUE!  Tastes even better the next day!

Okay, I have tried several main course dishes and have had moderate success with them, so I was hesitant about this one.  Well, I am so glad I tried this!  Sue, you have hit a home run!   I followed the recipe to the tee and even my picky teen went for seconds!!! I love the recipe and will make it again!

Very good, but a little too rich for me.  I also thought it needed more veggies.  Overall, a very good meal in and of itself.

This was excellent!  I made a few changes.  Used a combo of light cream and fat free half and half in place of heavy cream.  Used frozen spinach and chicken breasts.  Everyone loved it!  Froze some leftovers for quick lunches - just as good!

Very tasy and rich...possibly a bit too much. Next time I will cut down the portion of the white sauce. It does taste better the next day. My family loved it but commented that they could only have a small piece.

YUM!!!  This was great, even my picky 4 yr old loved it and keeps asking me to make that "white sauce lasagna" again. It is always nice to find new ways to sneak veggies into her diet! It got rave reviews from my boyfriend too!  I did use 1/2 milk and 1/2 cream to (slighty) improve the healthiness factor, otherwise made no changes.

This is one absolutely amasing dish! thank you fo the recipe! :) It's a little high in cholesterol but I use 1/2 milk instead of the heavy cream; reduced sodium cream soup and do not salt the chicken. That all helps to make it a little bit healthier.

Delicious, even though I lightened it up a bit -- used 1 cup whole milk, 2 cups cream, lowfat cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and lowfat soup. ALso used 4 chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken and frozen spinach -- this cut down prep time. May try fat free half and half next time and cut out cream entirely.

This is an insanely delicious lasagna! WOW! The only changes I made was adding more chopped mushrooms because I love mushrooms and I used chopped garlic instead of fresh; otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This is a new favorite in my house!!! You won't be disappointed!!!

I halfed this recipe as it was just me and my husband.  It could use a bit more sauce, because I found it a little dry.  My husband loved it, and I thought it was good.  Maybe halfing it caused the dryness problem (???).

We found this to be fantastic lasagne and a great change from the traditional beef and red sauce lasagne.  I didn't use ricotta cheese so I increased the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese to make up the difference.  I added some fresh basil, oregano, and Italian parsley to the sauce.  Came out great and actually far easier to make than I feared.

Rich and good...I used the seasoned cooked Fajita chicken strips that were preecooked and chopped them instead of the chicken. It had plently of flavor. I also added more mushrooms and cheese. I mixed the spinach and ricotta together. I will probably make again.

This lasagna is always a hit at our house! Just describing it to people makes their mouths water, and they ask if it's difficult to make. One thing I love about it is that I can buy ingredients in the amounts required, so all I have to do is pour the whole package in. I always make a double batch in my biggest roasting pan because we're happy to eat it for weeks. Also, it freezes really well.  I may have once defrosted some and reheated it in the oven and convinced my visiting mother-in-law that I made it just for her.

Made this tonight. It was okay...BUT, took FOREVER to to make-and was just edible. Was very disappointed myself. Will not be making again. Pretty bland, even tough I added jalapeños and green chilies. Kids did eat it though,I think just to be nice Tons of leftovers. Never again.

OHHH LOOOORD this was yummy. Even my little siblings ate it, and they hate spinach. My whole family absolutely adored this, especially my mother. She brought it to her work for lunch everyday until it was gone. It is one of my favorite dishes!

This was very good. I used frozen spinach, thawed, rung it out, then dried in a paper towel. Used garlic and onion powder instead of fresh. Bought a rotisserie chicken picked it clean. I cooked all ingredients in one pan to blend the flavors together. Will make again for sure.

Made it just as is except just sautéed some thin cutlets and everyone loved it- I used the lasagne that you don’t have to boil, and used regular 2% milk instead of cream and it was still thick rich and delicious and def cut out a lot of prep time

First, I had to laugh at all the reviews that lamented about how long this took to make - this took no longer than any other time I’ve ever made lasagne. That said, this came out rather bland, even though I read the other reviews and tried to add more garlic and onion. I ended up serving  mine with a little doctored up tomato-based pasta sauce (mushrooms, onion, red bell pepper, oregano, Italian seasoning) and that helped.  I will try adding Italian seasoning to the ricotta before adding it next time.

This is the freaking best. I’ve made it many times and impressed many a-people. Made a vegetarian version of it once by replacing the chickadee with roasted Porto mushrooms, zucchinis, and bell peppers. Came out great too.

I have made this many times and there hasn't been a single person that hasn't loved it.  It takes time, but if you want to wow guests... this recipe will do it. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta. Tastes really good the next day too.

This is really really really delicious!!! I was skeptical with the condensed soup but it's absolutely amazing! I used 1 can cream of chicken and 1 can of cream of mushroom. I added chopped tomatoes instead of mushrooms and sautéed my spinach just a bit with the chicken mix. I also added a little Italian seasoning. Yummy! Compliments from all. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was a nice change from a tomato sauce lasagna.  It was a bit time consuming but worth it.  My cheat for any lasagna recipe is to mix all the ingredients (not the lasagna) together after they are cooked and instead of spreading the liquids/cheeses/meat over the layers of lasagna, I have them all in one pot and just spoon it over the lasagna.  It cuts out a lot of time.

I've made this dish several times for company and it has always been a HUGE hit.  It's not a quick and easy dish, but well worth the effort.  The only changes I made were : I used 1 can cm of mushroom and 1 can cm of chicken, I used a rotisserie chicken from Wal-Mart (the garlic one if available) and sauteed a 6 oz bag of baby spinach in with the onions, garlic & mushroom once they were almost done (it wilts quickly).  I think part of the secret of the richness and tastiness of this dish is the homemade alfredo sauce!

This recipe is delicious!  I prepared it the night before with uncooked noodles it and put it in the fridge and it turned out great the next evening when I baked it!  I did omit the onions and mushrooms.

This is a delicious recipe however, the next time I make it, I will cut down on the butter.  I used real Parmesan cheese instead of grated so the combination made it a little more oily but of course delicious!

I made this for a dinner party, along with a beef lasagna, and because of a friend used gluten free pasta.    It was excellent, although I believe it would have been even better with the usual pasta.

Loved this dish...I did deviate from the recipe but still was good...I seasoned and grilled my chicken breast then shredded it. Did not have fresh mushrooms so I omitted them. I used Bertolli's Alfredo Sauce instead of the heavy cream and that eliminated me from having to season the sauce. My family loved it...

As suggested by another reviewer, I used one can cream of chicken and one cream of mushroom.  I will try with all low/no fat next time.  This was very delicious and I found it by searching for recipes that would help me use up mushrooms, spinach before they ruined.

I loved this recipe! I used a rotisserie chicken from Walmart and shredded it. Don't use the no boil noodles- I tried and they were still chewy. But this is one of my favorite new recipes.

I will not make this again.  The chicken added nothing, was in my opinion a distraction.  The recipe did not set up, was soupy.  I will look for a similar concept without the chicken, and with more spice.  This is a calorie bomb.

I make this every year around Christmas.  I saute' the spinach with some carrot sticks and onion, and drain the excess juice before assembling the lasagna.  I usually use 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can cream of chicken.  I too usually have some sauce left over, husband loves this dish.

I made a lot of the modifications everyone suggested (more spinach, sautéed onions, more garlic, more mushrooms, more spices, milk instead of heavy cream, etc.) and made two 9x13 pans of it, one to freeze and have later, it was fantastic! I brought one of them to a potluck and everyone raved and there wasn't a taste left! Thank you!

Excellent. I used 2 cups of half and half instead of 3 cups of cream. I also admitted the mushrooms. This was a big hit for my family.

delicious!!!
this is a favorite, and for anyone that doesn't like ricotta cheese I substituted with mozzarella and still excellent!
The alfredo sauce recipe is great for other uses as well.  I've used cream of shrimp soup in place of the c.o.m. soup for a seafood twist to use for other foods.
YUM!

This is by far the best alfredo lasagna I've ever had!  It is super duper fattening though, so I use fat free cream of mushroom and half cream and half milk, I don't put ricotta and I only put mozzarella cheese on top and it still tastes phenomenal, with less calories :)

I enjoyed this "quick" version of a spinach and chicken lasagna. Considering it used canned soups, I thought the consitency of the sauce was perfect and blended well with the other ingredients. I purchased a rotisserie chicken instead of baking my own in the interest of saving time. I will surely make this again but not too often as the caloric intake was more than enough for several days!

this is a time consuming recipe but worth it.  IT was fantastic.  I made two small casserole dishes of it.  I froze one and had it at a later time.  This is a good recipe to try on the weekend when you have more time to cook.

This recipe was a hit at a recent family dinner at which I was meeting my sister's fiance's family for the first time (sort of a meet the Fokkers night). The other family is Italian and LOVED this dish -- what more validation could you ask for? I substituted the cream of mushroom soup (since I hate mushrooms) with cream of chicken soup. 

I marked it down to 4 stars in stead of 5 simply because of the prep time - I probably spent a total of 2 1/2 hours preparing this dish, not including the hour in the oven.

This recipe is definately a keeper. Based on other suggestions I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. I also sliced 2 large portabellas for the mushrooms, and used baby spinach. Saute the onions & mushrooms in salt & pepper and then add more to taste after adding the chicken, don't skimp.

This is fabulous!!!!  Rich and delicious!!!!  I've made it several times now and there are never any leftovers.  It's a hit with my family.  My children are picky eaters, and they love this!  This is a long overdue review, but thanks for sharing your great recipe.

I have fixed it for my family and then for a BIG get together.  It is fantastic.  There were no leftovers.  Several people asked for the recipe.  Very good!

Have made this several times and have always gotten raves.  Also, I use this alfredo sauce in other dishes - it's just perfect.  Thanks, Sue - this is a lot of work but absolutely worth it!

Excellent flavor!  Mine turned out a little soupy.  I might try a little less cream next time.
