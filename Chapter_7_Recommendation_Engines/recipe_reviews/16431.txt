My mother is Mexican (born and raised) and immigrated to the US when she was 15.  My inlaws are also Mexican who immigrated 30 years ago.  This sauce is sooo NOT like anything my mom or my inlaws would ever make.  The sauce was 1.  Too runny 2.  Way too sweet  3.  Tasted like italian pasta sauce.  I tried to fix it by adding some chopped jalapenos and some splashes of tabasco sauce, but my enchiladas tasted like I made them with ragu.  
On the possitive end, I think this is a good base and will try again with some modifications.  Also, I think this is kid friendly and would be something young kids and non spicy tolerant people might enjoy.  

Sorry, I hate giving bad reviews but I appreciate the sharing!

I am so glad I read the other reviews before I made this dish.  This recipe makes an excellent enchilada sauce with a few changes: 1) use tomato paste instead of sauce 2) use chicken broth instead of water 3) blend the salsa to make it smooth 4) double the chili powder and 5) cook the sauce for several hours, adding broth to maintain a smooth consistency.  I made this sauce with Gerry's Chicken Enchiladas, also on this site.

First let me start by saying I am 1/2 Hispanic 1/2 White. This does NOT taste authentic as far as enchilada sauce goes, it DOES however taste really really good. Usually when I try any new recipe here I'll tweek it a bit to my own taste. This is so far the only recipie I have ever come across that I did NOT want to change anything. It is great !!EDIT: I have used 1 can of tomato juice and ommited paste/water. If you do it this way, I'd suggest a long simmer.Also my choice is CALVIN AND CLEOS™ salsa. Tried Pace™/Old El Paso™, even my own home made, but commercially, theres tasted best in at least this recipe. Be warned, the awsome smell it creates may drive you crazy for a while....dang it I'm hungry now ...Gonna make some again this weekend.............. 

Quick recipe. Make enchilada filling from 2lb hamburger, 1 medium onion, 1lb velveeta cubed, or shredded, and about 1/2 cup of this sauce, roll your filling up,Pour about a cup on the bottom of a 9x13 pan, Place rolled enchiladas in  cake pan, pour the rest of this sauce over it all, and top with shredded cheddar, bake for 30 min @ 350. YUMMMM.

If you really like Mexican food, authentic Mexican food, don't use this recipe.  It tased more like an Italian sauce, nothing near an enchilada sauce.

This recipe is a keeper. Like other reviewers, I will no longer be using canned enchilada sauce. I never liked using it because it has MSG in it. Now I can make my own MSG-free sauce. I did cut the chili powder in half, since my family does not like real hot things. It turned out to be the perfect amount of spice for us. The first time I made this, I used tomato sauce and it was very watery. The second time I made it, I used tomato paste. I noticed the recipe called for 6 ounces of tomato sauce. Since sauce comes in 8 ounce cans and paste comes in 6 ounce cans, I decided to try it with the paste. It worked out so much better!!! The sauce was not watery like when I used the tomato sauce.

I have been using this recipe for about 6 months and it is the best enchilada sauce I've ever had.  True in flavor and fairly easy to make.  I normally double or triple it so I can freeze the extra for future use (even better reheated).  I let it simmer for about an hour or two just to get it to a thicker consistency and let the flavors meld.  I always add some crushed dried chipotle chile pepper and it adds a great smoky flavor.  Also a bay leaf or two- just don't forget to take them out before serving.  This is a keeper for life-  Thanks!!

I made sure to read other reviews before starting.  I also decided to use tomato paste rather than sauce.  I measured out the 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock and added slowly until the sauce had the right consistency (about 1 1/4 cups).  I didn't care for the chunky texture the salsa gave, so I used a hand blender to smooth out the sauce.  I have to say this was so easy and I will not bother to purchase canned sauce any longer.

My husband dozed off to sleep dreaming of this sauce after a wonderful cheese enchilada dinner.  Thank you so much! I added about 2 tsp. of chicken boullion to the water and used about 1/2 cup of fresh Texas 1015 sweet onion.  For the enchiladas, we lightly fried corn tortillas, keeping them soft, and filled them with grated colby/jack cheese and more of the sweet onion.  We drenched the pan of rolled enchies with this superb sauce, topped with monterrey jack and baked at 400 until bubbly (10 minutes).

I thought the flavor of this sauce was great, though I did double the chili powder.  And, do we think the cook really meant to use tomato paste?
I think yes, as the 6oz amount refers to the can size of tomato paste.  If she had meant sauce, then wouldn't she have said 8 oz?  I made it with the tomato paste, and used 2 cups water, and it was just right.

Excellent!  I used a bit more chipotle salsa than was called for, and a touch more chili powder.  Definately an improvement over canned sauce!

This recipe is what we call gringo food. All you need is to soak a few red chile pods, preferabally from Hatch, New Mexico, in hot water. Put into the blender with onions, garlic, and salt to taste. Puree, and then put in a strainer and squeeze out the juice and viola enchilada sauce! The recipe has too many ingrdients and taste like it came from a can.

I really liked this sauce.  I read the reviews before I made it and several mentioned that it tasted more like a marinara sauce.  I noticed that a lot of people used their Hispanic background as qualification for ripping on this sauce, so I'll use my status as an Italian girl to say this: What the heck kind of marinara sauce has chili powder and cumin!  Those are both pretty strong, non-Italian flavors.  Anyway, I find this a great alternative to those nasty canned sauces at the store.  I only gave it four stars because I didn't feel like it made enough for a 13X9 dish of enchiladas.  I'll double it next time.  I may even try canning this.  Yummy!

Update 1/5/11--I have made this several times (omitting the basil) and it is always delicious. Tonight I made it again and when I was cleaning up after dinner I realized that I had forgotten to add the salsa. Yeah, a pretty big oversight. But I'm happy to report that it was still super yummy! It's just good to know.

I made this with my canned tomato sauce from my 2010's garden. And I used fresh herbs and spices. I cooked it on low for about 30 minutes, It was already thick because I make my tomato sauce thick. It was great! And I needed something quick because I was making chicken enchiladas and I did not want to go to the store. Thanks for posting

Very good sauce!  I tweaked it a bit, using chicken broth instead of water, tomato paste instead of sauce, and taco sauce instead of salsa (I didn't have any salsa on hand).  I also increased the cumin and chili powder to give it more of a kick and I added 1 square of unsweetened baking chocolate to deepen the flavor.  Next time I think I'll omit the basil, too.  I mixed some of the sauce with my shredded chicken (leftover meat from Roast Sticky Chicken on this site) before rolling in tortillas with shredded cheese.  Topped with the rest of the sauce and lots more cheese, then baked at 375 for about 20 minutes.  YUM! ** Update - I shared some of the leftover enchiladas with my parents and my father just texted me that they are "Out of this world" and "Must have the recipe"!!  WOO HOO!!!

Hmmm. This tastes fine, but is too runny to be considered "sauce." I wish I would have read some reviews beforehand, but b/c I was racing against the clock, I didn't. Many reviewers suggested that the ingredient list is inaccurate. I agree. Tomato paste is sold in 6 oz. cans & tomato sauce in 8 oz. ones. Those who subbed tomato paste for sauce yielded excellent results. I ended up adding a bit more salsa (1/2 c. total), hoping my sauce would thicken, but had no luck w/ that. I then dissolved 1 T cornstarch in 1 T cold H2O, added this "slurry" to my sauce, brought to a slight boil & thickened this way. Next time, I'll substitute tomato paste! And, despite GABESGIRL's comment about this not being authentic.... I can't attest to whether this is or not (I'm not of Mexican descent), but I CAN say it was not bland in the least (or sweet...). I considered Mrs. Epsy's enchilada sauce, but it seemed too spicy for my mom's palate (I was hosting my parents for dinner). Yes, maybe this is bland compared to the "real" thing, but it was perfect for what I needed it to be - a mild, sligtly seasoned sauce to top my spinach enchiladas wtih. NOTE: I subbed dried minced onion for fresh (why chop 1 t worth???) and this seemed to work just fine. :) Oh, and use Mexican oregano. It has a stronger flavor and therefore holds up MUCH better to the strong flavors of SW cooking. Thanks for sharing, Sal. I'm adding your recipe to my "keeper" file right now! :-)

This is a great Enchilada sauce!  I used to always make my enchiladas with a mix sauce, which I was happy to have, but then when I moved to England, there were no mixes to be found. So I made this sauce out of desperation.  Now the mix sauces taste terrible in comparison!  This sauce has raised the bar for me! :-)  Thanks!  I'll never go back. :-)

This enchilada sauce is EXCELLENT.  My family LOVED it, even my semi-picky son who doesn't like spicy enchilada sauce, enjoyed it.  It was easy to make, so easy that I won't be using those "bitter" can sauces again.  It had a milder flavor than I expected, but WOW!  I added a little bit of chopped cilantro and 2 tsp of sugar.  At first I thought it was going to be too thin of a sauce, but I left it alone and it cooked up just fine.  I will definitely make this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

Excellent!  I tripled the recipe since I was making 3 pans of enchiladas the next day.  I made the following changes. Ran the salsa through the food processor until smooth. Added a few more cloves of garlic & used a shallot finely minced instead of an onion plus some onion powder. Used tomato paste like the other reviewers recommended instead of sauce. Doubled the cumin & used a more chili powder. Plus added some chipotle sauce.  Used 4 cups of chicken broth instead of water & let the whole thing simmer for 2 1/2 hours.  Made chicken & beef enchiladas the next day.  They were to die for. Thanks for the great post.

I can’t thank you enough for this wonderful recipe.  This is the best especially if you use a chipotle salsa.  I didn’t use all the water; just one cup and I added a little sprinkle of flour to thicken it up a bit.  I know enchilada sauce is supposed to be thin, but since I can customize it, I prefer a thicker sauce.  My husband is usually the chef of the house, but I like to give him a break and make him my guinea pig.  I made simple beef enchiladas with leftover beef brisket and cheddar cheese.  I baked the enchiladas in your sauce and my husband will not stop praising me about it. I am not the experimental type, but I love a good recipe.  This is now his favorite meal.  Thank you for sharing Sara!

A lot of reviewers have said this is too watery so I reduced the water by 1/2 cup and discovered after baking that this almost ruined the sauce. Do NOT reduce the water. Instead, add the full amount and simmer for the required time. Enchilada sauce is SUPPOSED to be thin. 

Second, be sure to use quality salsa. I recommend a roasted chipotle salsa. This was an excellent sauce recipe, easy to make, and not too spicy. My husband is very fussy and he liked it too.

I did not have enchilada sauce on hand and found this recipe.  I had all the ingredients on hand except parsley (seriously, who needs parsley for anything).  This recipe was quick and easy and it tasted much better than the canned stuff you buy at the store.  I will use this again!  I, too, like super hot, so I just added sliced jalapeno's to the top of the enchiladas and then always use more hot sauce when I eat it.  Instead of parsley, you can always add cilantro after baking your enchiladas.  Yum!!

This was fantastic, I'll make this regularly! I did follow the advise from the review from mbphilli which was to use paste instead of tomato sauce, to use chicken broth instead of water, to blend the salsa with my immersable blender, and to double the chili powder.  I will follow all these suggestions next time too. they also suggested to cook for several hours but I wasn't able to take that much time so I did let it simmer 1 hour instead - it really came out fantastic!

I did not need an authentic enchilada sauce, just something quick to add a kid-friendly zing to "Mild Cheesy Chicken Enchiladas" on this site. A few alterations to this recipe: cut back on chili powder to appeal to kids’ taste buds (1/2 tsp. and will cut back to 1/4 tsp next time), and 1 14 oz can of chopped tomatoes, pureed, and two heaping tablespoons of tomato paste. Omit water. Simmered for 20-30 minutes, and used in place of chopped tomatoes in aforementioned recipe.

I thought this was really good!  I was making a dish that called for a can of enchilada sauce, but I didn't have any so I thought I'd give this a go!  The only thing I changed was that I only used a scant cup of water (instead of 1 1/2 cups) because I didn't have that much time to let it sit and simmer.  It tasted great!

This is better for an italian sauce, just leave out the chili powder. I am a Texas girl and this recipe was not good at all.  My husband is a fan of enchiladas, and he asked me why did i use spaghetti sauce? I will never make this again it was awful and I am not sure why it has five stars?!  Maybe some people do not know what an enchilada sauce is suppose to taste like......

This is one of the best enchilada sauce recipes I have found.  I made the drip beef sandwiches, also found on this site.  We had the sandwiches one night, and I used the shredded beef for the filling in my enchiladas the next night.  When the sauce recipe called for water I added the left over broth from the beef instead.  I used warm corn tortillas and filled with beef.  rolled them and put them in a pan with a little of the sauce in the bottom.  Pour the rest of the sauce over top and sprinkle with cheese.  Bake covered for 30-35 min. at 350.

Made as written. Tasted like spaghetti sauce with the oregano and basil. Made it again, doubled onions, added more cumin, chili powder and used tomato paste in place of tomato sauce.  Also used chicken broth (homemade) the second time in place of water.  This still tasted much like an Italian sauce to me, so I think I'll keep searching.  Okay, this time I added about 2T of cilantro and some "Spanish Paprika". It did seem to help, ALOT.  So I guess as a base recipe this is OK, but I did change it tons to be more my style.

I made sure to read the reviews and decided to make it with the tomato paste also. The sauce came out awesome! It was a bit like pasta sauce but with a mild kick. I made it ahead of time and simmered it for a few hours, half by itself and half with shredded chicken in it for extra tenderness. Great sauce!! I loved it and will definately use this one again. I also added a little bit of taco seasoning for just the right amount of spice for me. YUM!!

At first I thought everyone was being a little arrogant with their comments of "I grew up in Mexico and this is NOT enchilada sauce!", but this recipe just needed...more. More spices. More heat. More onion. More. It's a nice ingredient list, but I would double everything except the water and tomato sauce. Also, I made chicken enchiladas, so I cooked my chicken in the sauce; two birds, one stone!

This was my first attempt at making enchilada sauce.  I prefer not to buy sauces if I don't have to, too processed.  It was delicious! Even my father who hates "new" food and is weary of anything I cook because I like things spicy loved it! He went back for seconds.
The only thing I did was use a few shakes of sea salt rather than the measured out 1/8 tsp of salt.  Less sale is better.

This sauce has the perfect flavor and is easy to make.  I have never liked canned enchilada sauce and will never, ever buy it again.  This sauce tastes like high quality restaurant sauce.  I used it in the Cottage Cheese Chicken Enchiladas and it was supreme.

I read the other reviews and in order to avoid the "rague" flavor I omitted all the "Italian" seasonings (parsley, basil,oregano). I also followed the advise and used tomato paste as well as chicken broth. I also doubled the chili powder and onions. with those alterations it turned out great and much more authentic

Fantastic!  I simply replaced the tomato sauce with tomato paste and it was wonderful.  Great taste and consistency.  We had it over tamales last night and are having it with enchiladas tonight!  I won't buy or make any other sauce for a while, I'm sure!

This was a good recipe. I used tomato paste instead of sauce and used chicken broth instead of the water.  Also to spice it up a bit I added a little more chili powder, some cayenne pepper, and a few dashes of hot sauce.  I also simmered a lot longer than said.  A lot of people are saying this tastes like a pasta sauce.  Which I tasted it after about 10 min of simmering and it did taste more like a pasta sauce because the tomato flavor was very prominent. I think the key is to simmer longer to let the flavors meld together more. I simmered aprox. 45 min. and the tomato flavor had melded with everything else and it tasted like an enchilada sauce.  Good recipe. I will come back to this recipe when I need and enchilada sauce.

Extremely tasty and so much healthier than that store-bought stuff.  I followed suggestions to use tomato paste instead of sauce and upped the cumin and chili powder a little....and I added several good dashes of garlic salt...but other than that, followed all directions.  I mixed a little into my browned meat and then just filled flour tortillas with the meat and shredded cheese and covered the enchiladas with the sauce, sprinkled more cheese on, and baked for 20 min. @ 350.  Yummy dinner!

WOW!  Keep this recipe as a staple in your fridge!  You'll use it often.  As others suggested, I increased the amount of chili powder.   How much you increase it will depend on which type of chili powder you use (mild or hot) and how hot you want it.  Also use chicken broth instead of water and using tomato PASTE instead of sauce makes this recipe rich, rich, rich!  I used the black bean and corn style salsa, running it through the food processor to puree it before adding to the pot.  Thank you, Sara!!!

I ommitted the basil & parsley & cut down the oregano to 1/2 teaspoon as others have suggested to keep it from tasting "too Italian". I forgot to reduce the water to 1 cup. Next time I will make sure to do that. I had to add cornstarch to keep it from being so runny.

First a tip to all of the people who have been saying that it tasted too "Italian"...omit the basil and parsley, and if you have been using whole (leaves and pods) oregano instead try using about half the amount of Ground oregano (strangely, there is a Very big flavor difference between using ground oregano as opposed to whole oregano) and you're usually OK.  Personally, I don't use the basil myself and I only use a small amount (maybe 1/4 tsp.) of Ground oregano. I also use chicken stock instead of water just for the added flavor. This recipe always comes out wonderfully for me =) Thanks!

I will never purchase canned enchilada sauce again!  I used this recipe last night while making enchildas with Charley's Slow Cooker Mexican Style Beef (also on this site) recipe; the combination was fantastic.  Thanks, Sara, I can't wait to try this sauce in other recipes as well.

Very good enchilada sauce. I'm not even a huge red enchilada sauce fan but this was very impressive. Used this in "Beef Enchiladas" also on this site!! The only thing I changed was using tomato paste instead of tomato sauce and not only was it very tasty, but the consistency was great too! Thanks for the tips former cooks and thanks for the recipe Sara!

I had a hard time making sense of the split reviews for this recipe.  After having made the sauce, I feel that if you are looking for an alternative to an enchilada sauce in jar, this is a terrific recipe.  If you are looking for an "authentic" enchilada sauce, look elsewhere.  Since I fall in the former, I found that this recipe was easy and tasty.

This is the first time I've made an enchilada sauce and this is AWESOME! Had I known how  easy it is to make, I would have never bought the canned stuff.  I doubled the recipe with a few exceptions...I used 4 tsps. onion, one 8 oz. can tomato sauce (that's the size they come in in my part of the world...6 oz. would be tomatoe paste), and I used chicken broth instead of water (if I had pork  broth, I  would've used that instead).  I used my immersion blender to blend it to a nice, smooth consistency so didn't have the 'Ragu' effect that one writer mentioned.  I am using my enchilada sauce for a posole recipe that I am sure will be magnificent.  I'll report back.

The sauce was excellent, but I felt like I needed to make some changes otherwise it wouldn't have received high marks! I exchanged the tomato sauce for a 6 oz can of tomato past and used a can of chicken broth which I think gave it a much richer taste than if I would have used water. It was thick and rich. Excellent! I will never purcase enchilada sauce again.

This is very good. I used Goya brand salsa and added additional chili powder as other users suggested. I also used tomato paste, not sauce.

After reading LOTS of reviews, they are correct by saying that this doesn't taste authentic but it was delicious! I made a few tiny changes:  After combining all ingredients, I put everything in the blender to make it smooth (not just the salsa) and added some cayenne, crushed red pepper, and cornstarch to thicken since I did not want to use tomato paste and I like a little heat.  I increased the onion to a little over 1/8th of a cup and the olive oil to 2(ish) tablespoons.  It simmered for about 45 minutes.  The salsa I added was homemade.  We ate this poured over black bean and green chilies enchiladas and topped with colby-jack cheese.  There were no leftovers!

this  was nice and easy to make. I did add some tomato paste bc I felt it was way to thin so I added little bits till it was think enough for me. I didn't add as much chili powder bc it would be to spicy for my 18 month old.  He loves this stuff!

 people will like more or less of some seasoning but that is really your call when you making it. I like more cumin and garlic in mine ; )

This was very good.  Made exactly according to the directions.  Only gave 4 stars because I thought it was a bit thin, but the flavor was yummy and perfect over the top of the Chicken Enchiladas by Julie Moutray on this site.  Thanks for submitting Sal.  I will definitely make again.

Ouch.  This is so not what I am used to - which is okay as long as it works.  This didn't do it for me.  This reminded me of pasta sauce.  You are far, far better off getting the cellophane packets located in the 'international' section of the supermarket that are marked "Enchilada Sauce" and just add vegetable oil and water or tomato sauce.  Those pkgs are fairly inexpensive and are really the best way to go for a good, red enchilada sauce from scratch.

I just made this sauce and I used chicken broth instead of water like many suggested.  It is sooooooooo Yummy and it's not even finished cooking. I don't like canned sauce (tastes like metal to me) and now I never have to buy it again!  Thanks for a great sauce!

FIVE STARS!!!  This is an excellent alternative to the regular old canned stuff.  I love that I can make it right out of all the stuff in my cabinet.  I did make a few changes.  I subsituted the tomato sauce for paste & the water for chicken broth.  It did end up just a tad thicker than I wanted so I just thinned it with water.  Great recipe... not sure I'll ever buy the canned stuff again!

This is very good, and becomes AMAZING with the addition of one more ingredient... Take 2-3 dried guajillo peppers, which are smoky, not spicy. Put about a cup or so of water in a small frying pan, and rehydrate peppers at a slow boil. You should have about 1/4 of water left at the end, which can be added to the enchilada sauce. Then, scrape the meat of the peppers off their skins, and stir these in too - yummy! (And be careful, these peppers are dark red and will stain your cutting board, fingers, etc...but they are ssooooo good, and good in chili too!)

This was soooo good!!! Served over homemade tamales. I used ground red pepper and added a little cocoa. It was very spicy, but that's how we like it. I put it in food processor after cooking to give more of a sauce consistancy.  I will definitely make this again. Forget the can stuff forever!!!!!!!!

We loved this sauce!!  So simple to make and followed the recipe to the letter.  I did let "brew" on simmer about double the time suggested. I also doubled the recipe to use with the Chicken Enchiladas I recipe found on this site.  What an awesome pairing!!  I admit I was skeptical about the "Italian" spices but happily (and somewhat relieved) found they combined and brewed just perfectly with no resemblance to pasta sauce.  If you use this recipe to make the one mentoned, may I suggest also preparing the Mexican Rice II recipe and the Canned Corn Casserole recipe also found on this site for an awesome, complete mexican dinner.  Also, if you start wit boiling chicken first in water seasoned with chicken bouillon or chicken broth, you can use the same stock water for preparing each of these recips from that point forward using the stock where water is mentioned.   :O)

I thought that this was very good. I simmered it for a good amount of time and I did double the chili powder, as others suggested. I also should have doubled the recipe for my 9 x 13 pan full of enchiladas(12), but that is probably b/c I used it for seasoning the filling as well. I was able to dilute it enough for this time, butnext time will double so I can have extra. We will be making this again!! : )

This is good as far as being a tasty red sauce is concerned.  But growing up in a latino household...this is not grandma's enchilada sauce. It tastes like an italian styled sauce more than a latino one. But it is good, with a few tweaks.  As others, I used tomato paste instead of sauce, broth instead of water, and doubled the chili powder and cumin. Used it with Shredded Beef Enchiladas, also on this site.

I did change this recipe a little...I doubled the recipe & used 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of water...It was a little brown and watery so I added one 12 oz can of tomato paste to thicken it up and give it more of a red color...I also put the salsa in the food processor to make it smoother & I added a little more salsa than was called for...I put it on enchiladas & this was delicious! I usually do not care for enchiladas but I ate until I was so stuffed I couldn't eat another bite...I am glad I doubled this recipe so I can freeze what is left over...This recipe was fast & easy...I will never use any other sauce on my enchiladas...If I could give more stars I would!!

This was jut OK to me.  It was very simple to make, but I don't love oregano or basil....makes this sauce taste too Italian.  I may use this recipe again, but add a tad more garlic, and omit the oregano and basil.

This is good stuff! I took some suggestions from some other reviewers - used tomato paste, cut back on the oregano and basil, added a little bit more chili powder and cumin. I also think that whatever salsa that you use probably affects how good this turns out. I used a chipotle salsa - mmmmm! I used this sauce with the "chili potato burritos" recipe found on this site. It all got rave reviews when I took the leftovers to lunch the next day!

This recipe made a weird sauce.  It tasted too Italian, just like pasta sauce with chili mixed in.  Maybe I'm spoiled because I live in California but I don't see why people love this.  Luckily I made it last night for enchiladas that I plan to make tonight.  So when I get home and reheat it, I will add some more cumin, more salsa, and maybe a touch of cinnamon to make it more Mexican and less Italian.

This was wonderful.  I substituted 1/2 tsp onion powder for the onions, omitted the olive oil, doubled the amount of cumin, and used a bit more tomato sauce.  I did not even bother cooking on the stove top.  I poured the mixture over a pork roast in the crockpot, cooked all day on low, and then shred it with a bit of fresh cilantro and lime juice for a fabulous shredded pork to use in burritos.

I couldn't believe how incredibly easy and delicious this was! I used this over the chicken enchiladas from this site and it tasted so authentic! A small jar in the grocery store is almost $5, this cost me roughly $1 to make and it tasted so much better!

This is a very easy sauce to make....and it does taste better than the can stuff you get at the store.  I am still looking at for that authentic sauce that you get at mexican restaurants.  I liked it....and will use again.

You definitely need to thicken this - I doubled it, used chicken stock instead of water and added a little tomato paste - it was very tastey and I will make again.

I was a little disappointed in this sauce because it smelled so good when I was making it and it didn't taste the way I expected it to. I should have listened to the reviews and added more chili powder. (at least another teaspoon) I also found that most of the sauce evaporated while it cooked and left the tortillas a little dry. If the sauce was spicier and if I had used a smaller pan and less enchiladas (I made 8) I think it would have been perfect.

This is a wonderful recipe. I wouldn't recommend any changes. A previos reviewer wrote "use less tomato paste next time." It doesn't call for tomato paste in the recipe, only tomato sauce.

This is one of the best enchilada sauce recipes I've ever tasted. It beats just ab0ut an sauce I have been served in a mexican restaurant. I may substitute fresh cilantro for parsely next time I make it.

I followed the recipe, as I always do the first time I make something.  I was throwing together a tamale casserole and didn't realize it called for enchilada sauce and I didn't have any.  Anyhow, I thought it was really good and it was so easy.  I was really happy when it was simmering to see the beautiful color, exactly what I would want.  Thanks!

Not bad for a start, but it definitely needs some tweaking.  I added a couple of dried chiles as well as the seasonings listed at increased amounts.  I left out the basil since that seemed like it would make the flavor too Italian.  The sauce was still too tomatoey and not spicy enough to suit us, but it'll make a good start for something hotter.

This is VERY good.  I always make a lot and freeze it.  I've been looking for a long time to find something to replace canned enchilada sauce.  Sometimes I delete the salsa and add tomatoes and my own peppers.  It works fine.  Thanks!

This is an excellent sauce if you follow other reviewers' advice and substitute a 6-oz can of tomato paste for the tomato sauce.  Otherwise, it's way too runny.  With tomato paste it's a five-star recipe.  Since the original recipe calls for tomato sauce, I'm giving it four stars.

This sauce was pretty good though it was really really watery...I added a small can of Tomato Paste to it to thicken it up...should've added some additional seasonings but I didn't. It thickened up perfectly after adding the Tomato Paste and tasted pretty good.

YUMMMM!!! This is way better than buying enchilada sauce at the store. I also used tomato paste instead of sauce as some other reviewers suggested. Made a double batch and plan on using the leftovers later. Very good!

The only reason I'd take away a star is, I found it was really runny.  And, typically I don't read the reviews before making the recipe.  That being said, when it was on the stove boiling I thought it was soup.  I added some tomato paste, like others.. and it thickened it up.  I like my food -burn your tastebuds-hot so I added a couple teaspoons of tabasco and some additional chili powder, as well as some cayenne pepper.  Yum!

Being from California, I'm used to good mexican and can handle the spice.  I don't know if I somehow ended up with strongest chili powder on the planet, but this sauce ended up INEDIBLE!  My boyfriend just licked his finer after serving himself and began coughing and I ate one piece of zucchini and cannot get rid of the pain in my mouth.  

So much for dinner tonight.

Wanted something without sour cream or goofy ingredients, so found this one. Very excellent! I saw the 1.5 cups of water, so like others I used Paste instead of Sauce, but that was the only deviation. Turned out yummy. I used this on "Beef Enchiladas II" recipe. For half the enchiladas I mixed some wolf brand chili in the sauce and poured it over because I wanted some chili-style too. VERY GOOD. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great!  I used less chili powder and a little less water.  We like a thicker sauce.  And I doubled the recipe as we like lots of sauce.  We will make it again and again.

This is the first enchilada sauce recipe I have tried at home and it is great and easy. I followed the recommendations of using tomato paste instead of sauce, doubled the chili powder, replaced the water with broth and let it simmer for a long time. It didn't taste like pasta sauce as a few review said. Perfect!

I started out super-optiminstic, but for everyone else who gave this a poor review, you sure weren't kidding!  As written, this tastes like a bad combo between taco sauce and spaghetti sauce.  I honestly have no idea why this has been so highly reviewed.  I had to make so many changes to make it taste like enchilada sauce that my final version doesn't resemble the original at all.  Sorry, but I may have to go back to the stuff in the can.

I think this is a solid recipe and I love that it is all the things you "should" have on hand in your kitchen.  I do have to say that I find it funny when users rate recipes poorly after modifying them to begin with.  How does one know if the recipe is good if you don't actually follow the recipe.  So funny!

Yum! I made this sauce exactly as is, except I used chicken stock instead of water. Oh my goodness!!! My husband, who typically does not like most enchilada sauces went nuts over this!  After the sauce simmered for a half hour, I pureed it with my immersion blender to make it smooth and creamy and it was perfect.  For my enchilada filling, I sauteed some onions and garlic and added left over shredded/roast chicken meat.  To give it flavor, I added several spoonfulls of my enchilada sauce.  I dipped corn tortillas in the sauce, placed the filling in, rolled up and placed in a baking dish that had the sauce on the bottom and topped my enchiladas with the remaining sauce.  Perfection. I will never attempt a different red enchilada sauce again. I found the best!

Delicious sauce.  I didn't have any salsa so added another can of tomato sauce & used only one cup of water.  Great blend of herbs & spices.  Was great on my beef enchiladas.  I doubt I will buy canned enchilada sauce ever again.

I made and used this sauce with the Chicken Enchiladas I from this site.  I doubled this sauce and cut the chili powder down to 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon as we don't like things too spicy.  I also used tomato paste instead of sauce.  Very good.

Based on other reviews I used 6oz tomato paste and replaced the water with chicken broth. I had to scale back the chili powder due to my children so I added a little extra cumin and some onion salt. This is so much better than the canned sauces! I do understand the mixed reviews, the basil does give it an italian flair, next time I will replace the basil with cilantro (fresh is possible) and I expect instant perfection.

This was just the thing I needed for the enchiladas I was making. I followed the recipe except that I replaced one cup water with one cup chicken broth. Definitely gonna use this from now on instead of buying the canned sauce.

I have made this sauce many times and although I agree it has a tendency to taste a bit "Italian",  I add  extra cumin and a mexican seasoning which is made by McCormick, and I have to say it beats all canned and many mexican restaurants enchilada sauces! I love mexican food, and even though some may say this sauce is not "authentic", I don't care!  I make cheese enchiladas with mozzarella (I got the idea from a mex rest.) with this sauce and I always get rave reviews! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Sal...this is wonderful! I made what I call "enchilada chicken" with this sauce. I made the recipe as listed. I did use tomato sauce, and noticed it was a bit to thin so I added a can of mushroom soup. BANG! That made it just right...thickness perfect. I then added one boneless chicken breast cut into chunks and cooked the sauce w/the chicken chunks for about 20 minutes on the stove top. We put this sauce over bismatti or white rice,grated sharp cheddar cheese and crushed tortilla chips. My husband requested we keep this recipe around, and to make it again for our next family gathering! Thank you for this tasty, yummy recipe!

I used this recipe as a guide to make enchilada sauce for my kids.  When I make enchiladas for myself or guests, I only use NM red chile puree that I make on my own (chile pods I sun dry myself), and never just some random chile powder. I rarely cook with chile powder, unless I'm making chili dogs or frito pie, so I had no idea how much to use.  This sauce recipe will be extremely thin/runny if you don't start off with a little flour browned in oil.  I also used canola oil instead of olive oil.  Since I wasn't making spaghetti sauce, I left out the basil, parsley, and oregano.  If I wanted to use oregano in this recipe, I would use only Mexican oregano. I also left out the onions (my kids don't like them) and the salsa.  I used a pretty good quality chile powder, so it was able to stand on its own pretty well when using my own enchilada sauce making techniques.  I basically only needed the recipe to help me figure out how to make a sauce that wasn't too spicy for my kids.  I never thought of adding tomato sauce, so that was an idea I thought may work.  Armed with the tomato sauce info and chile powder measurements, I was able to make a sauce that my kids could eat.  Even though I didn't follow the recipes exactly, I learned that adding tomato sauce cuts down on the spicy factor.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This stuff is amazing! Doesn't take that long to make. We used to buy El Paso red enchilada sauce and this is soooo much better tasting as well as cheaper. A hint- try and find an Amish grocery store near you for your spices. It is amazing how much less expensive their spices are compared to the little bitty amount you get at the grocery store.

This was a wonderful sauce. I was making enchiladas one night and decided I didn't want the sour cream sauce like normal and I found this one. Not too spicy, not too bland. It was just right for me.

Custom version of an enchilada sauce I like to use in most mexican recipes, most often would be the Fabulous Wet Burritos. After finding out how easy to make my own was, I've never bought another canned sauce again.

Others may not think this is authenic, but as far as taste, it is absolutely wonderful on enchiladas.  Of course, I doubled most everything and simmered until reduced. All the children love it also!

Made exactly, but doubled. Was very spicy just tasting from the pan (I used a medium salsa). and it had a "tinny" taste. So, I added some chicken broth, a little sugar, and 1/8 cup chopped cilantro and liked it better. Texture was perfect: not too thin or too thick. Was not too salty, like some can be (esp. canned). Will defininitly make this in place of canned, but am still looking...

Very good! Was a little thin, but that was easily remedied by mixing a couple of spoonfuls cornstarch with a bit of water and stirring into the simmering sauce. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. Heat level can be adjusted to your taste by increasing or decreasing the chili powder. Make a double or triple batch of sauce so you can keep some on hand in the freezer. Much cheaper than buying canned sauce!

The enchiladas that my family has always made have been made with a white sauce. My husband is not a big fan of the white sauce, so I had been looking for a good red sauce to try. I found it!! I didn't tell him about it, but when I made the enchilads using the sauce, he raved about them for days! He even took some over to the neighbors to eat, because he said that they were too good not to share. To this day, he gets excited when he knows that we're having enchiladas for dinner. I added a little more water to my batch though, as it tasted a little too tomatoey to me and I like a little runnier consistenancy.

I'd been looking for a good enchilada sauce, because the canned variety doesn't come close in taste to anything homemade.  This recipe is very good as is, although next time I'd double the proportions as I made 5 enchiladas and the sauce was barely enough (I tend to like extra sauce to pour on top).

This was very tasty, but I'd suggest mixing all the spices in a small bowl (before you even start heating the oil) and set aside. Then once the oil and garlic saute for a bit, you can add the spices all at once.  I wasn't prepared with everything before hand, so it ended up a little burnt which came out in the flavour a bit.  Even then, it was still yummy, but next time I'll be sure to do a little prep work. :)

I can't thank the previous reviewers enough for their helpful comments! Totally made the difference! I used tomato paste (used tomato sauce the 1st time & it was as thin & tasteless as the Old El Paso sauce that I was sick of!). I used 1/4 tsp italian seasoning instead of the oregano & basil, and only used 1/8 tsp parsley. I doubled the cumin, used 3 tsp chili powder, used garlic salt & 1 cup water. It was THICK (most important to me!) & had a nice strong flavor. I can't wait to use it in my mexican lasagna recipe tomorrow night. Hope it makes all the difference in its taste. Am looking forward it using it in my enchiladas as well :-).

Oooh yummy! I made this recipe to go with the layered enchilada casserole on this site and it may have made the dish!  I used can of tomato onion mix instead of a can of tomato and minced onion as it was quicker and easier!  This sauce has a really wonderful rich deep flavour that can probably be used on lots of other things.... not sure what yet, but I want to try.

Really good recipe. I did add sofrito to this which makes it even better. A recipe for sofrito can be found on this site and I suggest using it vs. jarred. It really makes all the difference. Also, if it tasting to much like Italian make sure that Mexican oregano is used and not Greek. Greek is sweeter and used in Italian dishes where Mexican is pungent.

Great sauce!  I used it with the Shredded Beef enchiladas from this site, and was very pleased.  I didn't have the problem with the sauce being too thin that other reviewers had, but I used a thick salsa, so that might have made the difference.  I made no changes and like this sauce a lot better than the canned.

Easy to make, and was very good! Not thick but just right.  I froze what I had left and have already brought it back out to use, it froze up nicely.  Would make again and again and again! Thanks a bunch!

This was great - loved it.  I used the tomato paste like previous reviewers had suggested and added extra chili powder for spice.  One thing though, not exactly "enchilada sauce"... went great with the potato enchilada recipe on this site. My sweetheart and I both agreed - didn't taste so much like enchilada sauce, but still very tasty.

Do not be intimidated by making your own enchilada sauce!  This is so easy and a zillion times better than the canned stuff.  I follow the recipe to a T and it is just the best.  I wouldn't change a thing!

Great enchilada sauce recipe.  I have not been able to find ready made enchilada sauce anywhere in my neighborhood, so I decided to try to make some instead.  This was such a great recipe and tasted even better than the store bought stuff.  The only change I made was I put half broth and half water in the sauce since I had half an open can sitting the fridge.  Also, since the tomato sauce and the broth have salt in it, I didn't add any extra.

Very easy and good tasting.  Canned enchilada sauce is not as good and much more expensive.  For convenience sake, I doubled the recipe and froze some.

I will never buy the canned stuff again. This sauce is terrific, quick, and easy to make. I had to double the batch for how many enchiladas I made, but becuase of other reviews I only used 1 can of tomato paste. I will definately continue to use half the tomato paste in the future. The consistancy was perfect.

You will never want to eat canned sauce again.  Use beef or chicken broth instead of water for more flavor.  I also used tomatoe paste and added a little extra on the spices (i like spicy food though)

Our Family enjoys making our own Mexican dishes and after making this sauce we will never open another "can" of enchilada sauce again. We use this for burritos and chimichangas too. This is the best.  I have made it with substitutions, when I didn't have an ingredient or two.  My suggestion is to make this one as printed and then make adjustments - if any - after you have tasted this wonderful (easier than it looks) sauce.

Like other reviewers: We will NEVER use canned sauce again.  This MAKES our enchiladas--it's so perfect.  Even when I didn't have all of the spices and had to play around with the recipe with what i have, it comes out excellent every time.  The author does mean tomato paste, as stated earlier.

This recipe is excellent. I did not know how easy it is to make your own sauce. I did make a few changes, used the following fresh herbs instead of dried: 1 tsp. fresh oregano, 1 tsp. sweet basil and 2 tsp. of fresh cilantro and left out the parsley. Also used hot mexican chili powder. I doubled the recipe and simmered the sauce for about an hour. I will never go back to can enchilada sauce again. Thank you so much for the recipe.

Super sauce!  I usually use the canned sauce.  We were craving enchiladas and there was none in the pantry.  Used this recipe and will never buy canned again.  Didn't know that it was so easy to make homemade sauce!

This is a terrific tasting sauce, and very simple to make.  I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, since that is what I had, and I simmered it a little longer, because I like my sauce not-so-runny.  If I'm in a hurry next time I might cut back on the water a bit, but I like the flavours that are brought out in a longer simmer.

For seasoning, I "eyeballed" the amounts, and added a whole teaspoon of freshly ground cumin seed.  I probably used a couple of tablespoons of finely minced onion.  I ignored the parsley (would have added fresh cilantro if I'd had any, though).

It was delicious with ground beef/black bean enchiladas (with corn and pepper-jack cheese).  Rave reviews for my first enchilada effort!

This recipe is GREAT!  I will never by canned enchilada sauce again.  I do like my sauce hotter, so on a double recipe, I added a teaspoon of cayenne, a chopped jalapeno, and 2 T sugar.

This is dynamite!!!!  One of our favorite Meican restaurants has a sauce similar and I did what they do and added WHITE american cheese to the sauce, it thickens it some and the flavor is awsome, If you have not tried using white american cheese with enchiladas or tacos give it a try much better flavor than the cheddar!!!! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!

This was so good.  I slurped it straight from the saucepan.  A great way to make quick cheese enchiladas.  Much better than store bought--very easy too.  I omitted the parsley flakes because I didn't have any and it was still delicious.

I have eaten enchilada sauce all of my life and this is not very authentic nor does it even remotely taste like enchilada sauce. It is very sweet and reminiscent of spaghetti sauce. Basil is definitely never used in enchilada sauce, oregano very rarely and never tomato sauce.  I'm sorry, I could not use this sauce on my enchiladas, it went down the drain.

I followed what several reviews had suggested and substituted 1 1/2 cups low sodium chicken broth for the water. I also let the mixture simmer for an additional 20 minutes for a total of 40 minutes and then used my infusion blender to make the mixture smooth.  You can also use a blender. I also used a homemade fired roasted salsa.  Sauce is yummy yummy yummy.

I first tried this recipe a long time ago when I was visiting my girlfriend in Germany and wanted to make her Enchiladas Rojas, and the closest thing I could find to jarred/canned enchildada sauce in the supermarkets there was an Old El Paso enchildada kit. Just no. 

While I agree with others that this is not perfectly authentic, it was close enough and tasted quite good, just a bit different than I was used to. But while my Mexican dad would probably find it lacking, I grew up with red sauce and never actually learned to make it, so this recipe was a good start.  I thik of it more as a good recipe for a base sauce that I tweak to taste more how I want. It's a very flexible recipe, in that it can take the tweaking and is just about always improved. So obviously, I have adjusted it over time.

Like others, I have used tomato paste and chicken broth to soup the flavor up a bit. To make it thicker, I let it simmer to let the liquid evaporate and concentrate the flavor. I put more parsley than the recipe calls for. Also, I add a decent amount of cilantro.

Love love love this. But more so with the changes made from other reviewer suggestions.  I used tomato paste mainly because I would have had a half can of sauce left (doesn't come in 6 oz can). Used chicken broth instead of water and added one chipotle pepper.  I can only repeat what everyone else stated, I will never used canned sauce again.  Thank you for excellent   Recipe.

I knew without reading the reviews that tomato sauce and 1 1/2 cups water would make this too runny, and I also figured as other reviewers mentioned that the author probably meant 6 oz can of tomato paste, not sauce, since it comes in 8 oz.  I used 1 6 oz can tomato paste and 2 oz.cans of sauce,no water, and doubled everything else to make a larger batch, omitting basil because that didn't sound Mexican to me. I increased both cumin and chili powder to strive for a more Mexican flavor.  I really liked this sauce, and it will be my go to with the changes I made. Wether authentic or not, I really can't say, but most of the kids liked it so, there you go. It's a keeper with the changes I suggested.

I loved this sauce.  I added chicken broth instead of water and a T. of masa to thicken. Then add 1 T. sour cream stir well.

After trying another enchilada sauce recipe (that I threw out) I was very pleased with how this turned out. I used half a 6 oz. can of tomato paste and one 8 oz. can of tomato sauce because that is what I had on hand, omitted the parsley and basil, doubled the chili powder and used about 1 1/4 cups water. It is still simmering and when it is cooled, I will buzz it with the immersion blender and make enchiladas for dinner tomorrow night. The best part of making this sauce is that I know exactly what went in it!

Great sauce. Agree with the other reviewers that the author probably intended to use tomato paste. I did, and the recipe turned out great.

I like this using tomato paste instead of sauce and chicken stock in place of water, plus a few shakes of my favorite Mexican hot sauce. Perhaps not the most authentic sauce but very tasty and easy to make with items I keep in my pantry.

I thought this was a good base for enchilada sauce. For me, I felt it needed more spice, so I added more chili powder. I also went for a thicker sauce, so I used tomato paste versus tomato sauce. Overall a good recipe and I'll use it again in the future.

Great recipe!  Wanted to cook some ethnic food and my no salt diet would not permit.  Added some dried chili pepper to the sauce and whirled it all in the blender with some black pepper also salt substitute & some fresh basil.  Tasted great, satisfied my taste buds.  and I am a very picky eater, so try this great recipe.

This sauce was the most awful enchilada sauce ever. I even tried adding some unsweetened cocoa powder to the sauce in hopes of making it taste more like enchilada sauce to no avail. I will say though, the sauce itself was good (reason for 2 star rating) but would've been better on a pasta dish instead.

Went very well with the spianch enchillada recipe. As suggested by other reviewers -used tomatoe paste. Used stock instead of water - about 2 1/2 cups as it was too thick; 1/2 cup of salsa and added 1 tbsp. of brown sugar.

This sauce was ok. I didn't have minced dried onion or dried parsley, and used an entire 8 oz of tomato sauce, and used 1-1.5 cups veg broth instead of water. I simmered it in a wide, flat pan for 20ish minutes and it thickened up nicely. Next time, I'd try some of the recommendations:
1- chicken broth
2- double the chili powder
3- add a bay leaf or two
AND I'D DOUBLE THIS RECIPE. There wasn't enough sauce for Tomato Enchilada Bake.

Tast good. I agree at first it tasted more italian. Simmered a little longer and added 2 cubes of semi-sweet chocolate and added more chili powder, it tastes much better now. Think next time i'll reduce the basil and oregano a little.

This sauce was a bit too sweet and Italian tasting for me. I was looking for an alternative base for a sauce, but my husband and I didn't like it. I love Mexican food and Tex-Mex cooking, this is neither. This is more like an Italian sauce. I hate giving low reviews, but as a Mexican-American woman, I will not be making this again.

This was very easy and quite tasty!  Used the tomato sauce(didn't have paste) Salsa was also missing from pantry-so used Rotel tomatoes instead. Continued to reduce until I was satisfied with thickness.  Very forgiving recipe!

I obly had half the ingrediants (spices) for this and we still loved it. However I have never eaten a real enchilada. I literally made up my pwn recipe with ground mear, rice,beans. onions. peppers and cheese sause rolled in tortillas with this sauce on top and a good helping of grated mixed blend cheese on top. You don't have to be a chef in the kitchen to make something good, You just have to know what your doing. I rated this 4 simply because I am sure there must be something more like from the old country out there but I personally will use this again soon,

Awesome recipe!  So simple, with ingredients I already have.  (I did find tomato sauce at my grocery store recently that is perfect for this recipe.  It is Del Fuerte Tomato Sauce seasoned with Mexican spices, which only enchance the ingredients of the recipe.  It comes in 7.4 oz cartons and was only $0.33 per carton.)  This is a definite keeper!  LOVE IT!

This sauce is great!  It is much, much better than canned enchilada sauce.  I did not have any parsley or salsa so I added some extra tomato sauce.  I also added a bit of allspice and a few dashes of chipotle powder to give it a little kick.  The sauce was quite thin without the salsa so I simmered it on medium for about 20-25 minutes.  This gave it the perfect consistency.  Thanks for the quick, easy recipe.

Basil?  I left that out.  I don't think I have ever tasted basil in enchilada sauce.  Other than that the recipe is solid.  I followed the receipe with the following substitutions.  I used 1 thin slice of white onion diced very fine instead of the 1 teaspoon minced.  I probably had about 2 tablespoons of onion.  How do you get just 1 teaspoon of minced onion?   I used approx. 1/3 cup homemade salsa that consisted of tomatoes, onions, water, jalepeno and salt that were cooked and blended till smooth.  Very simple recipe I found online.  I also eyeballed the other ingredient quantities because I have been cooking for four decades and have a pretty good sense for measurments and my families tastes.  I used slightly less than 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, 1 and 1/2 Tablespoon of two different kinds of chili powder.  Blend of bright red and dark red chili powder.  NO BASIL.  Large pinch of salt and about 8 grinds of fresh black pepper on a very fine grind.  Approximately 1 Tablespoon of dried parsley because my dried parsley is about 3 months old and is losing some of it's flavor.  I also used 1 (8 ounce) can of tomato sauce because that is the way it is sold where I live.  I ended up using about 2 cups of water.  After bringing my concoction up to temperature, I tasted and found the result satisfactory.  It was a bit thin and tasted too much of tomato.  I read some reviews and added about 1/2 teaspoon of el yucateco chipotele sauce.  Now it is better, but still not authentic.

I tried this recipe 2 years ago and people can't belive this is home made. It is so simple, the reason for finding my own recipe for the sauce is because I can not tolerate too much heat and store bought is just too much. Plus there is nothing like homemade. I make a big batch and will use 1 portion then save 2 other portions for the next time. Sometimes I make 2 pans and will crank up the heat for others. Tons of flavor, easy to make, makes you a hero at dinner time. 5 stars for me

This sauce was AWESOME!!! It was easy to make and my husband told me they were the best enchiladas I had ever made. This sauce is way better than anything from a package or can.  Definately a keeper.

This was my first time to make enchilada sauce...we usually eat enchiladas topped with either chili con carne or a sour cream sauce, but I wanted to try a recipe that called for canned enchilada sauce. Rather than buying a can (yuck) I made this recipe. It was quick and easy and made with ingredients I almost always have on hand. It made enough for spinach enchiladas for three of us, with plenty left over to freeze for another time. Thanks!

This was a good sauce. A little more "Italian" style than I thought but still it worked out well with our enchiladas. It didn't make very much though and barely covered six enchiladas. I think I will make this one again as it was pretty good just a little different than I expected.

I tried this sauce and found it to be too sweet. I doubled the chili powder, used Mexican oregano and added a little cayenne pepper for a little heat.  I used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce as others recommended. I think that adding salsa is what may have affected the sweet flavor. I will either go back to using my favorite canned sauce or make a sauce from chiles the next time.

I read the reviews and added tomato paste instead of sauce.  It looked and smelled really yummy but in the end it ended up tasting like I put pasta sauce on my enchiladas.

this one is a keeper!!!  always struggling to get a good enchilada sauce and am not a fan of canned or jarred sauces, so i was so happy to find one i could make myself and this one took the cake.  even my picky husband loved it, his comment was maybe a little less oregano or none at all, but for him to say he liked it means its was good in my book.  my 10 year old complained about the smell of too many spices cooking, but after he had a bite he was sold too.  you just have to try it once.

Nice sauce.  It was very very spicy and I was worried that it would overwhelm the enchiladas but it was very nice.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of tomoto sauce to tone down the heat and I also added Cilantro instead of parsley.

After reading the reviews I adjusted it  so that it was not too watery and omitted the basil and parsley so as to avoid it tasting like spaghetti sauce.   My husband liked it + I found it easy to make= it's a keeper.

I made a few changes to this. I omitted the oregano and basil. That was all I did, and it turned out very great! I think I will add less water next time though. It seemed a bit too watery for me, but tasted good.

I made this last night with the following changes: tomato paste, chicken broth, 3 tsp chili powder (2 regular 1 chipotle) and 1 tsp cocoa powder and I was absolutely THRILLED with the result. A friend once told me to add half as much cocoa as I did chili powder to any dish calling for chili powder, and since this vastly improved my homemade chili I've been doing it ever since. It did start out reminding me of spaghetti sauce but when you put in the cumin and chili powder it stops reminding you of that! I'm not entirely sure the tomato paste/chicken broth changes need to be made though. I had to keep adding water to mine (I let it simmer for about an hour while I prepared other things, and it kept thickening up on me). So the "watery when you use tomato sauce" complaint may not always be the case. And, I think water would've been fine for me--I left out the salt in the recipe entirely and it was still a bit salty to my taste at the end, which must've come from the broth cause it surely didn't come from my salsa. So I think the modifications of tomato paste/chicken broth were not really necessary unless you plan to eat the sauce immediately on something very bland (I used mine in Layered Enchilada Casserole from this site and it was great). I will go back to the originally written recipe next time I think :-)

I am not a big fan of Red Enchilada Sauce in the first place, I much rather prefer Green Enchilada Sauce.  But this recipe was just odd to me, wasn't that tasty, didn't remind me of an enchilada.  But then again, maybe just me because I don't really like Red Sauce??  Who knows.

This recipe definately calls for a 6oz can of tomato paste, not tomato sauce. When the water was added to the paste it turned into the perfect consistency. Instead of salsa I added a quarter cup of chipotles in adobo sauce. I did not use the chili powder on account of the spice from the chipotles.

Def was not spiy at all...not even a lil bit..the kids didn't even think it was spicy. I added alot more chili powder to it to give it a lil something. Def will make again since buying it made is $4 a can while it cost next to nothing to make. But I'll just keep adding more spice to give it a kick.

Replace the parsley with cilantro and you've got a PERFECT recipe for red sauce. I also added some diced roma tomatoes and used less water than recommended (I prefer a thicker sand chunkier auce and taste).  Great recipe.  Thank you.

What got me intrigued by this recipe is that it seemed like a more healthy alternative to enchiladas that are often loaded with sour cream and cheese.  I made the recipe according to the directions, with 2 changes: 1. I doubled the recipe (and was very glad i did) and 2. I was concerned about other reviews that it tasted too italian, so omitted the parsley and basil (but kept the oregano).  I cooked it for about 4 hrs. to blend flavours and it came out fabulous.  I put a small amount of sauce in each tortilla prior to rolling to ensure the recipe was not too dry.  I would definitely make this again.

I thought this was basically good. Only changes was to add 1/2 tsp. chipolte chili for part of chili seasoning and added more tomato sauce less water.

Very good recipe.  I followed the ingredients exactly except didn't use any salsa but added 4 oz green chiles.  I also added 2 teaspoons of cocoa powder. I let it simmer for about 1 hour and it was perfect.  Not too spicy.

I forgot the basil when cooking and I only used a 1/4 cup of chili powder, but I will use 1/3 cup next time. Also I didn't have a green pepper, so I used a red one. I pureed the sauce after it had cooled down a bit. This sauce may not be authentic, but it is excellent. My guests thought so, and so did I. I used it with my black bean and cheese burritos. Definately a keeper!

Great recipe! Smelled exactly like the canned original one, tasted better and best of all: It was home made (so less preservatives and artificial stuff)! I omitted the dried parsley, as I didn't have any. I used it with Cottage cheese chicken enchiladas from this site - it rocked! Thanks a lot for sharing!

Very good!  I thought the water would be too much, so I initially left it out but soon realized I needed to use ALL the water.  This is so much better than the canned stuff that I don't think I'm going back.

I have used this to make both the Beef Enchiladas II and Enchilada Stuffed Shells, from this site.  Both were good, which was partly from the sauce and partly from the other recipes.  The reason I didn't give this a 5 was because of the slight Italian flavor as opposed to the strong spicy Mexican flavor I'm used to from the powered mixes or canned sauces.  I'm sure brand makes a difference (and I have a lot available in my area), but I didn't find this any better than canned and I think I just prefer the spicier versions.  I also had to cook this quite a long time in order to get it a consistency like enchilada sauce.  I was only trying to use up some tomato sauce and in the end didn't think this better or easier.  i.e. even though it's pretty good, I just don't feel it's worth the time to make -- I'm not out to be a gourmet.

I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and omitted the basil and oregano to lessen the Italian flavor and used paste instead of sauce. I also added a bit more chili powder and, because I didn't think it was spicy enough I added some sauce from canned chipotle in adobo. I also cooked it about an hour. I didn't have any salsa either so I minced up an Anaheim pepper and used that instead for some more spice too. It was a little thick after that time; I would have added a little more stock (which I substituted for water) later in the cooking to thin it out since I cooked it so long. Also, one big thing. It was NOT enough sauce to coat 8 tortillas and put some on the bottom of the pan and cover the enchiladas with some sauce. I had to use some jarred sauce just to have enough for a full recipe of enchiladas. I'd double it next time for sure.

I made some changes, like other raters suggested, and the sauce was great. I used tomatoe paste (not sauce), doubled the chili powder, and used chicken stock (instead of water). As an enchilada sauce, I would rate it a 4.5 (as in, Very Good) if I could. I also tried this recipe w/ changes (except doubling chili powder) as a pasta sauce and it was really great (definitely a 5). This recipe's a keeper.

I am also glad a read the reviews before trying this recipe.  I made a few changes as well.  Pureed 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chillies (rather than the salas), and i used chicken broth rather than water.  Simmers some shredded chicken in half the sauce used the remaining to pour over the enchiladas before baking..............YUMMY and the house smells fantastic!!!!!

This was very nice!  I have never had enchilada sauce before so I have nothing to compare it to...  Followed recipe except added about a 1/4 tsp extra cumin to get a more 'mexican' type flavor.  Also, simmered for about 1 hour which reduced it nicely to a not too thick not too thin sauce!  We used it with "Spinach Enchiladas" from this site and it was excellent!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This was really good! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and blended all of the ingredients to make a smooth sauce. I also let it simmer for approximately 2 hours. In the end the sauce was a little bit too runny so next time I would just reduce the water.

I am rating this based upon how it tasted before I doctor'd it up. I did the following: 1) used tomato paste instead of sauce 2) no parsley 3) 1 tsp chicken boullion granules 4) 1 T cocoa powder 5) 1 T brown sugar 6) 1/4 t cinnamon. When it was all said and done, my husband claimed it was the best sauce he's had & I myself would rate it a 5 star. Thanks for the good base to build upon!

Ok well I decided to make Chiliquilla (from this site) for Husband's breakfast tomorrow and I realized I didn't have enchilada sauce. I started off making this as written, and it was just horrible - WAY too herby, thick and cloying, and not nearly enough kick. I admit my chili powder is past it, but I ended up adding WAY more, and a boatload of Cayenne too. Thank you for giving me a basis to work with, but I thought this was horrible otherwise.

I made this recipe for some beef enchiladas and they turned out wonderfully. The first time I have ever made my own sauce, but I'll never buy canned sauce again.  lol, I  bought canned sauce just in case I screwed this one up, or it turned out horribly, but we didn't need it.  Ended up giving the can of sauce to my mom :D 

Oh yeah, I did add a little extra pepper because we like spicy. Yum!

To sum it up, this is amazing.  Use paste instead of sauce, and feel free to play with the spices.  I usually dump in whatever I have on hand.  (Lots of garlic and chili powder for sure!)  Try this with the Beef Enchiladas II on this site!

The sauce is simmering right now. So far it tastes really good.  I did alter some things, however.  Since I only have low quality chili powder, I used a 7 oz can of El Pato tomato sauce (spicy mexican sauce, added some tomato paste to thicken it up, and used dried cilantro in place of parsley.  This is a great base recipe that allows you to play around with to suit your taste, thanks so much for the post and member reviews relly help:)

Such a YUMMY, inexpensive option! All I had to purchase was the 40 cent can of tomato sauce. I mixed this sauce with 6 shredded chicken breasts for tacos and the flavor was great.

I went with the paste rather than the sauce, omitted the oregano (I only had Italian oregano and not Mexican), and upped the amount of cumin. It was really great. My friend who hates store bought enchilada sauce, loved this!

Yum! Delicious. We used it as an addition to "Easy Chicken Enchiladas" from this site. We used tomato paste, not sauce, as I suppose must have been the author's original intention, as I've never seen a 6 oz. can of tomato sauce. Farewell to canned enchilada sauce! Thanks for a great recipe.

I made a double batch of this using part for enchiladas and then using the rest as a marinade for pork medallions that were grilled. The pork turned out excellent! Next time I'll make a double batch again and freeze some so I'll always have it on hand.

Mmmmm... this was really good.  I used more salsa than tomato sauce, though, because I was afraid it would taste like pasta sauce, and I simmered it for about 45 minutes.  I also increased the chili powder.  I added a little sour cream and cheese to the mix before baking the enchiladas.  Way better than canned sauce!!!

Wonderful recipe!  This is the real deal, I simmered until thick and rich.  I love making sauces from scratch, controlling the sodium and leaving out the preservatives.  My only change was using low sodium chicken broth in place of the water.  You will be very pleased with this.  Thanks for a great recipe submission!

This was the best enchilada sauce we've ever had, first time I've ever made it. Took the advice of others, doubled the batch, used chicken broth, a bay leaf, added in a few chipotle chili's in adobo sauce to the salsa then blended. Also used pure California Chili powder. Simmered for about 2 hours. Next time I'll triple the sauce for 2 trays of enchiladas. I like to add a few spoon fulls of sauce into the ground beef once it's finished browing. Made with Sweet Corn Cake which was also a first and out of this world. Thanks so much for the recipe! I'm sure I'll be making this a lot.

While this does not taste authentic, it is very good.  I have no idea where the other reveiwers got that this tasted "italian" unless they used too many herbs and not enough chili powder.  I made this to go along with my store bought enchilada sauce that I didn't buy enough of and this was MUCH better than than the stuff in the can!!

I've never rated a recipe as terrible, but there's a first time for everything.  This sauce is just bad, there's no nice way to say it.  The funky smell of it didn't help either.  Please don't ruin your food by using this recipe.  Just use some salsa.

I thought this sauce was perfect with the beef enchiladas II recipe on this site. My only change was to reduce the water to 1/2 c and added an extra 1/2 c of tomato sauce. For added spice I also put a few drops of hot sauce while cooking.

Very good, lots of compliments! I do wish it would have had a little heat to it. I am scared to expirement w/ hot stuff so I just added a diced serrano to my chicken mixture and left the sauce alone. Will definitely do this quick easy sauce again, & I am open to suggestions on what to use to make it a little spicier. (but not too spicy)

This recipe was yummy. Pretty easy too! I used this with cottage cheese enchiladas from this site. Very very good. My boyfriend decided this meal will be a staple in our diet from now on. I won't be buying store bought sauce again!

The best!  My husband doesn't like my enchiladas till I made them with this sauce.  Only there might be a mistake in the original ingredient list.  I think the author meant to say 6 oz can of tomato paste not sauce.  Otherwise it is very watery.  I had to add more sauce till the consistency was correct and reduce down.  I'm going to try it with tomato paste next time.

Like other users, I used tomatoe paste.  I added a little red pepper flakes.  I didn't have any fresh onion or garlic, so I used ~1tsp. of each dried.  And I added a ~5 chocolate or carob chips, depending on what I have on hand.  This is perfect sauce for the Cottage Cheese Chicken Enchilada recipe on this site.

I tried this and it was very good with chicken and cheese enchiladas. I didn't have tomato sauce so instead I used tomato paste with water added to it to thin it out and just used that. It turned out ok, but next time I'll use the tomato sauce or tomato puree. Better than canned stuff, for sure.

Very good.  Cut up chicken breast, cooked in frying pan with little oil and added 1/3 cup of the sauce, cooked until chicken was almost done.  Then pre-heated oven to 350.  Dipped 4 gordita sized flour tortillas in remaining sauce, filled the tortillas up with cheddar cheese, green pepper, and chicken, wrapped them up, put them in a baking dish, then drizzled some more sauce over the top leaving about 1/2-3/4 cup sauce left.  Topped with more cheese and baked for 15 min.  Once dished onto plate I topped them again with the remaining sauce.

Awesome, easy, and very authentic! (And I know my enchilada sauce!)  I did decrease the water to 1 cup, and would definitely do that again to make it less runny.  I used this sauce on the "Chicken Enchiladas I" from this site.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

The best! Like many other reviewers have said, I will never buy the store bottle again. I had an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, so I upped the spices and salsa a touch, but kept the water the same. I used 1 tsp. of dried onion, but otherwise kept everything the same. I used this over the Chili Potato Burritos recipe on this site, and later this week I'll be using the leftovers for Chicken Enchiladas I. Highly reccomended.

Very good, but a bit mild.  I'll use more chili powder and salsa next time.  Sticking it in the blender isn't a bad idea either.

This was delicious and very, very easy to make.  I didn't have the separate dried oregano, basil and parsley, so I just added an equivalent amount of an italian spice blend.  Excellent with the chicken Enchilada II recipe from this site.  Really, really excellent.  Will definitely make again when serving any mexican dishes.

This was a tasty sauce and very easy to make.  I served it over the "Chicken Enchiladas I" also on this site instead of the taco sauce it listed.  It was a GREAT combo!  The yield was 1 3/4 c after simmering for 15 min.

My whole family loved this sauce.  I put it in a crockpot with 2 chicken breasts for 4 hours on low and yum!  Did a few substitutions (onion powder for minced onion, tomato sauce for paste), added 1/4 cup sour cream, shredded the chicken and rolled it up in microwaved corn tortillas with shredded cheddar cheese then poured the sauce over the top with more cheese and sliced olives.  Baked it at 325 (too long - about 20 minutes would be good) and it was a real winner.  Thanks, Sara! This is a really great red sauce.

Very tasty and hot!  I modified using suggestions of other reviewers including using 1 cup of beef broth, 1/2 cup salsa (Fresh Salsa I), and a little tomato paste to thicken it up.  I used this sauce in the Enchilada Casserole recipe and it was a hit.

Delicious!!!!!!  Only thing I did was reduce the water to 1 cup as suggested in a few other reviews.  This sauce goes perfectly with a beef enchilada recipe I found on this web site.  'Shredded Beef Enchiladas' submitted by Christy Campbell.

This was really good. I used this to make chicken enchilada's; I had my sister over for dinner, she doesn't necessarily care for Enchilda's however she LOVED these. She will be pulling this recipe for herself. The only alteration I made was increasing the salsa to 1/2 cup, and decreasing the water to 1 cup to thicken it up. Next time I make this I will double the recipe to make my enchilada's more saucy, and so there's leftovers after my sister is has devoured the entire pan (c:

This was a good and easy recipe. I nixed the italian spices and also added cayenne pepper and cilantro. I used my homemade salsa and let it simmer for about an hour. (as I was preparing the enchiladas) I thought it ended up with a nice consistency.

I made this tonight because I wanted to make beef enchiladas from this site and did not have any enchilada sauce.  This was great.  I didn't have all of the spices so I substituted italian seasoning for the parsley, oregeno and such.  This was great.  Thank You.  Very Easy.  I even took cold rice, poured a drained can of crushed tomatoes and the rest of this sauce over it (heated it) and made great quick spanish rice.

Thanks for sharing this recipe Sara..it was very tasty.  Old ElPaso has a red enchilada sauce that is my absolute favorite, but when I looked in my cupboard, I was out.  I didn't feel like running to the store so I whipped this up in about 5 minutes (not including the simmer time).  I doubled the recipe but only used 1 cup of water and no salsa (I was out of that too) and it was the perfect consistency.  Weird as it may sound, I still favor the canned stuff, but this will certainly do when I'm out of it.  Thanks for sharing.

Wonderfully seasoned enchilada sauce!  I also used a can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, per other suggestions.  This recipe doesn't need any other changes - it is wonderful just as it is.  I used this sauce over chicken enchiladas and it was excellent.  Will try using the sauce in chicken tortilla soup tonite - I think it will give the soup incredible flavor.  Definately better than store-bought enchilada sauce!

I used this to serve over the Beef & Bean Chimichangas from this site, and it was great. The only thing I might try to change next time is to try to thicken it up a bit, it was a little watery, but not too bad.

This recipe was fantastic.  I doubled the recipe because my family likes a lot of sauce on thier enchiladas.  ALso can't leave a recipe as is, so added a sprinkle of dried cilantro, 1/2 small onion diced in place of minced onion, and added a few semisweet chocolate chips (sounds wierd but sweetens it just enough).  Would highly recommend this recipe.

Incredible sauce! I made a few changes according to the other reviews. I used 1 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1 tsp cilantro instead of parsley, 1/4 taco sauce instead of salsa, 6 oz tomato paste instead of sauce, 1 can beef broth and added 1 can diced green chiles. My house smelled wonderful and my husband keeps asking when I will make Enchiladas for his buddies. Thanks Sara!

Great sauce, followed other reviewers and used chicken broth (making chicken enchiladas, will use beef when making beef enchiladas), no salt, red pepper instead of black, chipotle salsa, more chili powder, tomato paste instead of tomato sauce and an extra garlic clove.  Put it all in my blender, pureed it, then I simmered it.  Wanted a smooth sauce.  Turned out great.

I needed something quick and I only had shrimp, corn tortillas, and the ingredients to this fabulous enchilada sauce.  I have never made homemade sauce before, but my hubby's a chef and he said this was one of the best enchilada sauces he has ever had!  I added a little more salsa, and did not have tomato paste or plain sauce, but I did have a can of pizza sauce - :)  Excellent recipe!!!!

I really like the home made taste, but it was just way too bland for me. I tried to spice it up with some hot sauce and seasonings but it didnt do the trick.

This sauce made my husband propose to me again!  (We were married in Vegas-after this sauce, he has asked for a Mountain retreat... cozy!)  I used tomato paste & added extra chili powder and cumin.  My husband is from San Diego and we don't have the same quality of food here in TN but he said this was better than any sauce he had in San Diego or Mexico!  Thanks Sara for an awesome sauce!

Great!  I realized that I was without sauce at the last min. and whipped this up in a flash.  I used fresh chopped cilantro vs. the parsley.  I added it to "Jaimes Black Beans & Rice" (from this site)and it turned out fab!  I will use this again with enchiladas for sure.  Thanks Sara!!

Good flavors although I thought it had more of an Italian flavor, almost like a marinara sauce, even with chili powder. Tasted kind of unusual over chicken enchiladas.

This is a very tasty sauce!  I made only minor changes, using the tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, used a little more fresh onions, added green chilies, used beef broth instead of water and left out the salsa.

Not sure how to rate this recipe.  Since I like thicker sauce, I used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, as some of the reviewers suggested who said they liked it a little thicker.  I wouldn't recommend that - it turned out way too thick and a little too sweet.  Next time I'll use tomato sauce and just use a little less water.

This was really good.  I did make some changes though.  I didn't have salsa on hand so I added a small can of chopped green chilis.  I also used a bit more tomato sauce and less water, about 1 cup. of water.  I then added 1 chicken boullion cube to boost the flavor.  I'm not sure if it made much of a difference but I used Mexican oregano instead of regular.

Will never use canned sauce again!  We prefer our sauce on the thicker side, so I reduced the amount of water slightly.  I've made this numerous times and doubled the recipe everytime.  Extras freeze well for later use.

This is the best! I made cheese enchiladas tonight and used this recipe for the sauce. Yummy! I won't be using the canned stuff anymore. I added some ground beef to make it more like a chili sauce and I also added a can of Rotel tomatoes.

I omitted the basil, oregano and parsley, and added 1/2 tsp cayenne and extra chili powder.  I used one can diced tomatoes with green chiles and puree'd them with the tomato sauce and left out the water.  Cooked up nice and thick and very tasty!

Good for a tomato based sauce. My husband usually makes the enchilada sauce and he uses chilis as his base, but we enjoyed this less authentic sauce, and it was a lot easier to make!

YUM!  Used this in place of canned sauce in this site's *Enchiladas* recipe.  Far better than the canned junk.  My ONLY comment is that the yield on this is really about 2 cups...once you simmer for 20 minutes...the water reduces.

Excellent sauce - very quick to make - I spiced it up a bit just by doubling the chili powder and adding a touch of hot sauce.  We like our enchiladas spicy!  It was delicious with black bean & cheese enchiladas.

Nope. There are much better enchilada sauces here. This is Prego enchilada sauce.

I’m not a fan of canned sauces so I gave this recipe a try. I do t normally care for enchilada sauce, even authentic varieties. Maybe that’s why I loved it. So many negative reviews, which prompted me to include...recipes are products of the brand/quality of the ingredients you use and are used to. I used the varieties I like and mine was no sweet and it was low sodium. The only thing I did do that the recipe didn’t call for was putting it through the food processor to make it more of a sauce since my salsa on hand was a chunkier variety. Thanks so much for sharing.

This is a great alternative to store bought sauce as you can control the sodium & no MSG!  Definitely use tomato PASTE and not sauce.  I made this as stated and loved it, but next time I think using unsalted chicken broth instead of water would take it to the next level.  Also used fresh salsa that I made!

As per the very first review, i also used tomato paste, and chicken stock. After sauteing the onion and garlic, I put it all in the slowcooker for a couple hours.  It was my first time making enchiladas, and my husband graciously left me one whole enchilada out of the entire pan! Best compliment I could get from him! Thank you!

Simple and good. I saute the onion first, adding the garlic just as the onion is done lest the garlic become bitter. I use Mexican oregano giving it a more rustic and authentic flavor. Rancho Gordo sells Mexican oregano.

A little salty. Heavy tomato taste. I mixed it with the canned sauce we like and it was good. Was hoping to find a homemade version b/c we use 2 cans  every time we make and looking for a cheaper way. Will experiment with this again.

Compared to a can, this sauce is gold! The fragrances from heating the seasonings are a delight, and this makes a fantastic-tasting dish! It was a little runny, but I was okay with that, as I planned on baking my enchiladas anyway. We wanted a little more heat, so I added a few Chipotle peppers, and the result was perfect!

Loved this recipe. I did change some things, just because I didn’t have everything the recipe called for. I used some diced tomatoes and tomato paste instead of sauce and I used chipotle rotel instead of salsa. I also added extra chili powder, cumin, and some garlic powder. I added chicken bullion to the water to give it extra punch. This turned out amazing. I couldn’t get it super smooth with my stick blender, but it was great!

I have been using this recipe for 5 years for my cheese and onion enchilada. It has been wonderful each time. It may be a little running but sure makes dipping the corn tortillas much easier before filling and rolling. The thinness of the sauce works well during baking and the flavors come through quite well. The only change I have made is I add 8 oz of canned tomatoes sauce instead of 6oz so I do not waste any sauce (store bought comes in 8 oz cans). Thank you Sal.

We really enjoyed this sauce! I followed the recipie exactly the 1st time around, but I doubled it so I'd have some ready to go next time we want a No-Fuss dinner. 
I might use a touch more Chili Powder & Cumin next time, and maybe do all salsa instead of tomato sauce. 
I defintitely recommend following the recipie exactly the 1st time, and then adjust to your own tastes. :)

This is a great enchilada sauce.  The only change I made was adding 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder.  We made nachos and used it as a topping and there will be enough for chicken enchiladas the next night

I made modifications as suggested by substitute tomato paste and chicken broth for the sauce and water. I simmered it for an hour. I doubled the recipe so I would have enough since some said it didn’t make enough sause. I also added a can of Roten tomatoes instead of the salsa.  I will definitely make this again since my husband loved it as did my dinner guests.

This recipe exceeded my expectations! My super picky 8 year old raved about it. I did add however a couple of generous spoonfuls of cream cheese and simmered it to add some thickness and creaminess and let it simmer longer than the recipe suggests. This is definitely being added to our meal rotation ! I didn't find any Italian taste as the previous reviews suggest.

I enjoyed this sauce. I followed some  others posters suggestions and added a bit of bouillion and  a small can of tomato paste . I had already used a half can of regulAr tomatoes. After it reduced it was great. Just the right amount for a big tray of enchiladas.

I have not had enchilada sauce for a long time.  But this tasted good the way it was.  I made a second batch (which I liked better, but you might not) and changed it a bit.  I  ADDED:  A 6oz.  CAN TOMATO PASTE,  1 1/2tsp  smoked paprika,  1 tbsp brown sugar, USED ONLY 1 cup water with chicken bouillon mixed in.

7.13.17  There are many reviews on this recipe, and they’re all over the place.  I do a little bit of Mexican cooking, but I’ll admit I’m certainly no expert on it.  Confused by the reviews, I searched “enchilada sauce” on Allrecipes, and often found oregano as an ingredient, but never basil, so I left it out.  Also, I seriously have to wonder if there's a typo in this recipe, and  if tomato sauce really should be tomato paste...that would make a huge difference in taste.  Tomato sauce never comes in 6-oz cans, always 8 oz or larger, but tomato paste is sold in 6-oz cans.  It makes no sense to me to only use 6 oz of tomato sauce from an 8-oz can??   So I intended to use tomato paste, but didn’t realize until I started that I had no cans of tomato paste, so I used an 8-oz can of Aldi’s Mexican Hot Tomato Sauce, and cut the water back to 1 cup.  Let it simmer, tasted it, and I thought the tomato flavor was weak, so I added a couple Tbsp of tomato paste in the tube (really concentrated & rich) which I had in the fridge, and that kicked up  the tomato flavor.  Bottom line, this was OK, but I doubt I’ll make it again.

This was just ok. I have to agree with others that say this is more reminiscent of an Italian-style sauce. I did not use this to make enchiladas though, I used it to make Mexican rice and that worked out fine with the other seasonings I added to the rice. This was not horrible, but it didn't seem like the enchilada sauce that I'm used to eating.  This was fun to try, though. Thanks for sharing. :)

Not too bad with adjustments. I omitted the basil, used Mexican oregano, chicken broth in place of the water and El Pato brand tomato sauce for a little yee haw. Left the rest of the ingredients the same and blended well.

I'm going to give this a three star because I used another reviewers recipe adjustment. Instead of tomato sauce I use tomato paste, I doubled the chili, I blended the salsa till it was smooth, and instead of water are used chicken broth. I loved this recipe BUT I was the only one. My husband and kids thought it had an Italian flavor, which I can see with the oregano, basil, and parsley. Next time I will try a different one. Probably will never use this recipe again. it was better than my usual wolf brand chili canned sauce. Ha ha!

The flavors in this are delicious, but I had to cook it down for a long time to make it thick enough for my liking. Once it was thick enough (cooked longer than 20 minutes) it was DELICIOUS on our cheese enchiladas.

The best red enchilada sauce I've ever made is when I canned my own using green chilies allowed to ripen on the vine.  Those were the good old days and probably gone forever.  The second best recipe and really, the only one I've ever found that even compares to those red chilies is this one.  It's close enough for me to use and when I make it, I made it straight up with no alterations from the original recipe.  Highly recommend...

Use the fresh spices. & herbs, leave out salts & sugars.  It tastes better with the fresh garlic, onion & oregano from the garden or patio.   Leave out the parsley its red sauce not chicken soup. Tastes fantastic with my overhaul!

I used a faux beef stock and ditched the canned tomato sauce and instead used farm fresh baby tomatoes.

Then I greatly increased the amounts of  all the wonderful spices listed in this recipe and let the spices cook down over low heat til  sauce was rich and velvety.

I have made this twice and both times it came out great! One modification I made was doubling the cumin and added a teaspoon of turmeric because I love those two spices. I did not have salsa the second time I made it and substituted hot sauce as one review suggested and I think it turned out the same. As another reviewer pointed out, it appears as though it calls for tomato paste instead of sauce, therefore I used tomato paste. This recipe turned out way better than the enchilada sauce recipe I found on Food Network! I will use this recipe from here on out.

Definitely not authentic Mexican flavor. It had a slightly sweet taste that I didn't care for. Needed a lot more seasoning to try and salvage but still only fair after almost doubling the seasonings. Tasted more like a marinara sauce than Enchilada sauce. I used some of the sauce to make a pan of enchiladas but threw out the rest as it was not good enough to use again. Very disappointing!

Love this sauce. I have made it twice, once in my kitchen and once in my daughter's kitchen. The ingredients are  common to most pantrys  and spice  racks. I will never buy canned sauce again.

I did add tomato sauce and paste. I also added a can of diced tomatoes. I let it simmer for an hour and then pureed it in my blender. My husband loved it.

After reading the reviews from others, I doubled the chili powder, left out the oregano, added a chopped up fresh tomato, tripled the chopped onion, added a small can ofdiced green chilies, and replaced the salt with a double measurement of onion salt. I used a crock pot: on high until the sauce bubbled, then turned it down to low for several hours. It is quite spicy (tossed left over hot picante and hot salsa in, about 1/4 cup each). It DOES taste like enchilada sauce. It is just about as hot as I can tolerate, although my partner eats food much hotter than this. It complements the black olives that I use to bake the enchiladas. Next time I will  use tomato paste instead of sauce, as it turned out just a teensy bit  runnier  that would be optimal.

Instead of using salsa, I used a can of Rotel and put it in the blender first so the sauce would be nice and smooth.  I also left out the basil, because it is strange.

I made some significant alterations and doubled the recipe and followed many suggestions. I halved the pepper, added red pepper for the other half for a fuller mouth heat, upped the oregano and chilly pepper a bit, a dash or to of marjoram to round the flavor, traded the tomato sauce for tomato paste and water for chicken broth (I used a full container of chicken broth) and it helped with the constancy as I'd added more dry then called for, I also added handfuls of frozen corn. I used my homemade blender salsa.                                           Then used 5 frozen chicken breasts ( I have a large family and wanted some left overs) and pressure cooked it in oregano olive oil (I make my own), Johnny Salt, Johnny Salt Garlic, Taco seasoning, cumin and salt and cooked my chicken for 20 min and then shredded it. I then poured 1/2 my sauce in with my chicken, spooned my chicken into my flour tortillas, a handful of a nice shredded Mexican blend of cheese, rolled them width wise in my lasagna pan, nine deep and poured sauce over the top and then covered with cheeses and cooked at 350 for 30 min.  I made a second pan to save for latter... Half the children were gone. My husband said it was the best enchiladas he had ever had. My son agreed. They were tired and hungry but they did turn out beautiful. I recommend making sure to enjoy the taste and constancy of your sauce before for your best results. :)

Really, really good.  Kids liked it because it wasn't too spicy.  Used fresh parsley and basil and chicken stock instead of water.  Will never buy canned again:)

I double this recipe and freeze whatever I dont use. I also add fresh herbs instead of dried. I've subbed taco sauce when I didn't have salsa and it worked great (original Ortega Medium) These enchiladas are a hit in my house every time!

I've been using this recipe for about four years as I live where Mexican ingredients are very expensive (a store bought sauce like this would be about five dollars for one small can), so I make things from scratch.  It is excellent and so easy to make.  Variations can be made according to taste.  I don't think it tastes like Italian sauce at all--as one reviewer noted.

I'm from texas and my husband is mexican.  It wasn't great for him...the sauce was too watery so I had to add some flour to thicken it up.  Probably won't make this again.

So I didn't have salsa so I used a can of rotel and cut back on the water. Turned out great. My beef and bean burrito filling was one pound of hamburger, the remainder of the onion that I didn't use in the sauce and I used a can of refried beans and seasoned with s/p, Worcestershire, and a cup of the enchilada sauce. This satisfied my need for Tex Mex up here in Canada

Really good and flavorful.  I omitted the salsa because I wanted a smooth sauce. I stuffed my tortillas with seasoned chicken, onion, and white cheddar.  This is a keeper for me. My family loves it!

Used this recipe in place of a jarred sauce that another enchilada recipe called for. It was pretty similar to one that I have written on a 3x5 card, but was unable to find it so I was on a search and came across this recipe.  The only change I made to this recipe was using vegetable broth in place of the water and used a whole can of tomato sauce .. Will keep this for future reference .. thanks for the recipe ..

I needed a quick sauce for cilaquiles. This went together fast with ingredients I had.  I used a New Mexico chili blend, simmered it down a bit and pureed it smooth.  Maybe not "authentic" but it certainly is good.  I'll definitely make this again and can't wait to try it on enchiladas.  It has a great flavor.

We loved it! We substituted fresh minced chives, as well as fresh basil and oregano. Used only 1/2 cup water and used picante sauce instead of salsa. This was impressively easy and I couldn't be happier with how wonderful this turned out.

I followed mbphilli's recommendations and I am glad I did so.  The sauce was defiantly better the third day.  The day I made it, the sauce did have a slight Italian taste.  The longer the favors melded, the more the sauce tasted like enchilada sauce.  We loved it and will make it again, but I'll tweak it. Maybe I will add 1 can of tomato sauce and 1 can of tomato paste instead of 2 cans of tomato paste so the sauce will not be as thick.  This recipe is a winner!

The family liked this enchilada sauce.  I left out the salsa and basil, and did not add the salt.  My chili powder contains salt.  Used Mexican oregano.  I will use the recipe from now on.

I skipped the sautée step and omitted the oil Sauce was all I had on hand so I used a standard sized can and just enough water to rinse out the can. To this water, I added a small splash of liquid Au jus concentrate. I omitted the "Italian"- type seasonings. Had I any oregano, I would have used some; ditto cocoa or baking chocolate. For spices I used two or three heaping teaspoons of chili powder and an equal amount of ground cumin, one or two heaping teaspoons of onion powder, a heaping teaspoon of dry minced garlic, some chili-lime salt- a good few shakes, some white pepper, a dash of cinnamon and salted with garlic salt. I used a three-ounce individual snack-size cup of salsa because I had it on hand and perhaps an 8th of a cup of my "special" salsa (purchased from a Cuban restaurant on my birthday) for it's distinctive smoky flavor. Following the suggestions of  previous reviewers, I used my stick blender for a smooth texture and added a bay leaf to the mix- which was really quite thick, after transferring to a covered small saucepan over medium low heat. I also added a scant teaspoon of turbinado sugar after everything was in the pan and cooking to sort of soften the taste of all of the spices. If it's still too strongly spiced, I will probably add a second can of sauce. Made sauce to accompany crockpot enchilada casserole. I think that this recipe is a good jumping off point for experimentation. Will likely make again and continue tinkering.

I made this without the oregano, basil, and parsley and used 1/2 of a fresh onion. Doubled it, used an immersion blender, and added a square of unsweetened baking chocolate. It's really good!

This recipe is excellent! I only made a few changes.  As suggested by another reviewer I used 1) tomato paste instead of tomato sauce and 2) chicken broth instead of water.  I also decided to put in a jalapeno pepper instead of doubling the chili powder as suggested.  I topped it with jalapeno cheese and it was SPICY! but very tasty.  I'm definitely adding this recipe to the family favorites.

After reading the reviews I used tomato paste instead of sauce and also used 1/2 can of chipotle peppers. It was way to hot for our taste buds w/the chipotle, I had to tone it down by using grated carrots. The end result was delicious!

While not "authentic"...this is the best enchilada sauce I've ever tasted. I made it last week for the first time, and I'm currently cooking about a gallon of it right now to tuck away in the freezer. There is nothing more comforting in life than a cheese enchilada made with corn tortillas and red sauce. This is wonderful. I made Mexican rice at the same time as this, and just threw a cup of the sauce into the rice water while it was cooking. Delish. I'm doing the same this time around, except I'm using barley.

FIRST CLASS!!!  I tripled the recipe exactly as written (using homemade salsa) and homecanned two pints for future use.  Plan to make even more.  It was perfect for my Huevos Rancheros and tonight it will feature in my enchiladas.  It just doesn't get any better than this.  PS: for homecanning, waterbath for 35 minutes.UPDATE: 6/6/11: Have multiplied by 16 and am canning 9 pints.  Was confused by the 6 oz. of tomato sauce...which commonly comes in 8 oz. cans so originally used the paste.  This time I split it between paste and sauce.  Only used 5 c. water total but it is great.  Now I'm glad I canned homemade salsa in quarts last year due to running out of pint jars.  Will make more as gifts!

VERY yummy and EASY too! I used this on top of "Chicken Enchiladas I" (recipe on this website - I used this sauce instead of the recipe's taco sauce). Very yummers! I only put in 1 1/2 teaspoons of chili powder since my family doesn't like spicy stuff. This is a keeper!

First, let me say I am non hispanic, so for me authentic really doesn't mean much. All that matters to me is that a dish seduces my pallette into a frenzied state of ecstasy. After following the advice of another reader and changing the recipe from tomato sauce to tomato paste this recipe was excellent ... thank you   ;)

Used this for cheesey enchilada stack and it turned out great. I didn't need as much as the recipe made so I will have to make a small batch of enchiladas to use it up. I did use a mexican tomato sauce.

For how simple this is I didn't expect much out of it.  But it turned out to be surprisingly wonderful!  I used fresh onion  minced (the recipe didn't specify) and I added about 1/2 a chipolte.  I also used mojo de ajo (garlic infused olive oil) to saute the veggies in.

The amount of chili pepper was way too hot.. even for me who enjoys hot and spicy cuisine. Next time I think I will only use 3/4 teaspoon. I also substituted basil and parsley for fresh cilantro. It's a nice base recipe.

Very good sauce, and easy.  I took the reviewer PHREAKWARS' advice and used tomato juice since I don't have tomato paste right now and did not want to use my jars of tomato sauce (since it's not plain--it's spaghetti sauce).  I simmered for probably about an hour (I made this the night before) then poured it over bean and cheese burritos, topped with cheese then baked in the oven for a quick prep dinner last night.  Everyone except the 9 year old (we have 5 people visiting right now) ate one and seemed to enjoy the sauce.  I thought it was a bit spicy, but I think it was the salsa I used.  Other than that, it was easy and good.  Better than store bought!  Thanks for the recipe!

Used fresh basil, parsley and onion for added freshness and because I had those on hand. I also used broth instead of water. A great sauce for pasta, pizza and any recipe requiring a flavorful tomato sauce.

Absolutely incredible! I didn't have time to let it simmer since dinner needed to be out on the table in twenty minutes, so I just added 1/4 C. water instead of the recommended 1 1/2 cups. It was perfect!

While granted this isn't a traditional Enchilada Sauce I really liked it. It was different and a nice change. I made almost as directed except I had a 15oz can of Tomato sauce so used the whole can and only a bit of water. It was a bit thinner than Enchilada Sauce generaly is but thickened up nicely in the oven. Not too spicy for my 3 year old (but he does like spicy) but had great flavor.

I have always bought the canned enchilada sauce and have never been a big fan of it. I tried this recipe and although, according to many users, it is not authentic, the taste is excellent! I used tomato paste and added more water due to lack of tomato sauce in the house and the flavor was wonderful!

I kind of agree that it takes like Italian sauce... I made quite a few modifications (mainly jalapeños and tomato paste) to make it taste more Mexican and to make it thicker. This was okay but I think I'll try something else next time.

This was pretty good, not sensational, but pretty good.  I did not use the Italian type ingredients or the cumin.  I did not have tomato sauce so I substituted fire roasted canned tomatoes and pureed them in the blender.  It did have a nice consistency and pretty good flavor.

I needed a gluten free enchilada sauce and found this recipe, I am so glad I did! I didnt even think of making my own. I only had basil pasta sauce but this still worked great with that! I just omitted the basil called for. I did add an extra tsp of chili powder and used half the amount of water for a richer sauce. Thanks so much!

This is ok I tried what other reviewers suggested (More chili powder, use chicken boullions, bay leaf, and simmer for a couple of hours). There still isn't enough spice for my taste. I think I'll just keep to the enchilada sauce packet. That is a lot less time consuming and I like it.

5 Stars for ease and a good base to work with. I left out basil & parsley because they didn't seem to fit to me, and I used Mexican Oregano. Doubled black pepper, salt and cumin, although next time I will leave salt as is and double the recipe to make more.  I did not have tomato sauce so I pureed half a 14-oz can of diced tomatoes in their juice along with the salsa and used that instead.  I think this is probably better than tomato sauce IMO, might make it less sweet and less sodium if you use the unsalted kind like I did.

So Good. I almost didn't try this recipe because of the "its not authentic" reviews, I'm so glad I did! It may not be authentic but it is wonderful, and really easy to make. Thank you Sal for sharing such a great recipe. And for once, I didn't make any changes.

This sauce is pretty good, def better than anything canned. Making authentic sauce from chiles is time consuming and this is pretty close to the real deal, however, I use a stock instead of plain water. So I use chicken if I'm making chicken ench, beef for beef. Also, I use half tomato sauce and half paste.

Something about this just didn't quite work for me, but I'm not sure what. The consistency was great (I used tomato paste instead of sauce, like others suggested.) Maybe it was the combination of Italian spices with Mexican.

I have made this sauce now a few times and it comes out great. I prefer to make my own sauce as opposed to buying it because I control the ingredients and can limit the processed junk we put in our bodies, or limit salt if someone is watching that. I think it would probably just fine without the salt because it has so much flavor from the other spices.

I read the reviews before making this and was surprised that so many said it tasted Italian. I made the following mods, I doubled the chili powder like suggested but also used Mexican chili powder instead of regular, then added extra salsa and some cilantro for spice. I used tomato paste instead of sauce which I thought was what it was supposed to be. Trying it with the above changes does NOT make it taste like an Italian sauce.

I left out the basil. Doubled the chili powder. Added cayenne. added some cilantro. Used a can of paste instead of tomato sauce (am sure that's what was meant). Used 2 cups chicken broth (from one bullion cube) instead of water. Dumped whole mix into blender until smooth. Came out EXCELLENT. . This recipe is a good base. Everyone has different tastes, and a few tweaks will fit each taste. Oh, and have a few beers until there's no fear about tweaking taste. Peace out.

Glad I read reviews before making and with small adjustments was very good. Some reviewers noted an 'Italian' flavor, so I omitted oregano and basil. Although Oregano is regularly used in many hispanic dishes, I just couldn't see how Basil has any business being in enchilada sauce, and it's such a strong flavor, it would dominate. Also, once all the sauce was mixed up, I ran it through the blender... Isn't enchilada sauce supposed to be smooth? Other than that, followed the recipe and it was really good! I think next time I would use some kind of stock for the h2o though, it wasn't lacking flavor, but stock would deepen the flavor. Made Mijo's Slow Cooker Shredded Beef and did Wet Burritos and then another night spooned it over Dang Quesadillas :) Considering how easy this is and using ingredients typically on hand, I'll never buy canned or packet enchilada sauce again. I'm always looking for home made alternatives to typically store bought foods- I like knowing (and being able to pronounce) the ingredients in my food. This fits the bill!!!

I was disappointed in this recipe. The reviewer who said it tasted more Italian than Mexican was exactly right. After tasting it, I doubled the chili powder and cumin. I also cooked mine on very low heat for about an hour to let the flavors meld a bit more. It turned out well enough, but I think I'll try a different recipe next time. Thanks :)

Not really sure what was off but these were not a big hit with my family. I used the red enchilada sauce recipe on here. Since I am not sure it if is the sauce or the enchiladas that went wrong I am going to have to make them separately and see.

This was a terrible enchilada sauce!! The flavoring is more like an Italian sauce.  My first clue was when it called for oregano and basil.  Most authentic enchilada sauce recipes do not include these ingredients.  I was in a hurry to make dinner for a large group and had accidentally saved this sauce to my recipe file.  In my haste I used this sauce recipe instead of another authentic recipe I usually use.  (Clearly I should have payed better attention to the ingredients the recipe called for.  I take responsibility for that!)  It completely ruined my dinner.  If you are looking for an authentic sauce recipe, THIS IS NOT IT!!!!!!!!

We used a can of tomato sauce, and it tasted like nothing at all.  We had to add a bunch of stuff to it to make it taste close to decent. :(

I really loved this sauce! I had been looking for a good enchilada sauce in the store and could never find a good one. It was always bitter. I followed this recipe execept I did use tomato paste instead of sauce and I did add a little sugar and added a little extra chili powder. My family loved their beef enchilada's alot more with this recipe. I will use it again!!

SO YUMMY!!  I will never buy the canned enchilada sauce again.  It makes dinner so easy.  I buy the frozen chimichangas from Costco and make this recipe while they're in the oven.  It makes a really quick delicious dinner in under thirty minutes.

Yummy! Loved it. I love spicy and this is just what I was looking for as the Old Elpaso enchalada mix in Australia is mild and different to the one we loved in the UK. A keeper! Used paste instead of sauce though.

I have now established a new spaghetti sauce recipe as this was no where near a "Red Enchilada Sauce".  The red coloring in a "TRUE" red sauce is yielded from the use of Mexican Chili Powder.  I was very skeptical from the start as it calls for tomato sauce as the main staple for the base of the sauce.  My boyfriend and I both will be using this for our next Italian Meal instead.  Even though this did not rate as a "Red Enchilada Sauce" to add to my recipe box it does merit a new title and is still useful as a marinara and is rather spicy and an abundant of flavor.

First time making enchilada sauce, so I may be premature in giving 5*, but it was easy to make and very good.  Was in the middle of cooking this and six other dishes at once when I realized we didn't have tomato sauce.  I just threw in salsa in it's place.  Turned out good to us!  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful and will definitely make again and again.  I used chicken broth instead of water as others suggested, but stayed true to the recipe other than that.  I decided to use my crockpot though.  My family loved it as well, and the aroma in the house was to die for.....

Very good!  I used "hot" salsa and simmered the sauce about 40 minutes.  It was thick and delicious!  It was a little too spicy for my youngest son, but next time I wll use "medium" salsa and that will solve that problem.

Authentic or not, it does taste like the Mexican restaurant near-by.  My family likes the flavor so it has become a regularly used recipe.  When I want it thicker I use tomato paste or puree instead of tomato sauce and will reduce the water by 1/2 cup or so.    I also use home made salsa when possible.    You may need to play around with spices to get your personal taste.

OMG!!!   Just wonderful.  I had no idea how to make Enchilada Sauce. When I saw how inexpensive and easy this recipe was, I had my doubts.  But it was better than any store bought product we have ever bought.  So fresh, and with no added preservatives or fillers.  We could hardly wait 3 days to have it again!

Not only is this recipe quick and easy, it tastes great!  I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, but only 1 cup of water.  I also did not bother to measure the spices.  I just put what looked 'right' for each one.  I can tell you even without having measured that I used a lot more chili powder and cumin than what was called for.  And due to time constraints, I only simmered it about 20 mins, then added it to my own enchilada recipe.  I can see where it would taste even better if you had time to simmer it longer.  Even so, I won't be buying canned enchilada sauce anymore!

I also added a little more chili powder and used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. Added a Tbsp of chopped fresh cilantro. Delicious with vegetarian enchiladas made with a cream cheese/TVP filling. Served with a tomato, avocado, and mango salsa.

I must say, I think this enchilada sauce is better than the kind you buy! I like to add enchilada sauce to the meat for tacos...I added this sauce to our tacos last night. My family said these were the best taco's I'd ever made! I did use a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, 3/4 c water, and upped the spices accordingly. I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing!

This is fantastic! It gets better every time I make it. I use on the wonderful Black bean & Rice Enchiladas from this website, and it gets rave reviews every time. It fast, easy and forgiving, so you can make it your own. Thanks!!

The sauce reminded me of an Italian restaurant trying to make Mexican food. I took the other reviewers suggestions and substituted paste for sauce, but in my opinion it made the sauce too thick. In my opinion, the ideal sauce would be one that duplicates the bottled enchilada sauce sold at Trader Joe's.

This is my go-to recipe for enchilada sauce. I use chicken broth cubes to make broth instead of water, I don't put the salsa in, and I add 2-3 small squares of dark chocolate in for the last 5 minutes. You have to stir till the chocolate melts or it will sink and burn. VERY GOOD. The spicyness will depend on your individual chili powders. Sometimes mine comes out hot, sometimes mild.

Finally, an enchilada sauce that isn't too hot for me (since you can control the amount of zing)!  This is awesome and free of additives and preservatives!

I liked this and so did my kids. I omitted the salt since salsa/tomato sauce has plenty but other than that, I didn't alter recipe at all. I know it's not authentic but it tasted good anyway! :o) Thanks!

This was really good, I made it as written except I used a little less water because we were using the sauce on chilaquiles recipe and wanted a thicker sauce.  Had a nice bit of spice.  Will definitely use again.

This was a good recipe, but it did have a hint of Italian taste to it. I didn't have the salsa though, which probably would've helped. I added a can of tomato paste to the mixture, and it was the perfect combo/consistency. If anything, it is a great base to get the enchilada sauce the way you like it!

I made this last night for my husband who is a self proclaimed 'particular' eater and he loved it!  The first thing he said was that we needed to share this recipe with his mom!  I doubled the recipe to fit a 9 x 13 pan but I will probably use just a touch less water the next time so that the sauce is a little thicker.

I used only half of the chili powder suggested and it was very bitter. Had to add two tablespoons of sugar and more tomato sauce to sweeten it up.

With all the glowing reviews I thought for sure this was the sauce I was looking for.  It was not.  The sauce was to tomato-y and too thick.  I used the recommendation to use the paste instead of the sauce and I think the sauce might have been better had I used the sauce.  The enchiladas at my favorite Mexican restaurant is thin and tasty.  This was the exact opposite.  Will not make this again.

This was excellent. I left out the oregano and the basil just because those remind me more of an italian sauce. This will be my regular enchilada sauce from now on. It made the perfect amount too!

Maybe my expections were too high (I was lured in by the 5 stars...) but this tasted more like sphagetti sauce than enchilada sauce. All is not lost as I will will use it on a spaghetti dish.

I made this recipe to use in the Black Bean and Rice Enchiladas recipe from this site. Very easy to make and oh so tasty! I really think that the quality and heat factor of the salsa used really makes the difference. The heat from the fresh made picante sauce I used really toned down the strong tomato taste that is tomato paste and kept it from becoming too much like an italian sauce. Followed the recipe as written plus a couple of shakes of cayenne.

I use tomato paste, not sauce, and I blend the salsa in a food processor because I like a smooth rather than chunky sauce. Very good!

I sautéed all spices listed in olive oil along w/ the garlic. I also did as other reviewers suggested & used a 6oz. can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, as the recipe states.  The only additional change was a few drops of LA Gold (hot sauce) but that was for personal preference.  Overall, a good recipe which we’ll make again.

Delicious! I'm not a huge fan of red enchilada sauce in general, but after trying this, I've become one! The only minor change I did was exchange the basil for paprika and add a little more onions. This is a keeper.

This sauce is great, easy to make, and a wonderful addition to my homemade enchiladas. I've made this several times now and cannot imagine using anything else when a good enchilada sauce is needed. My three boys (ages 11, 6 and 2) and husband agree as well. As for any negative reviews, I would attribute that to the cook not the recipe, as this recipe is simple and far from flawed. Kudos!

Love this. So much better than anything you'll buy in a can. I make it just like the recipe says and it's always terrific. I serve my enchiladas with the sweet corn cakes listed on this site. Makes my tastebuds dance!

Great sauce. Didn't have any canned sauce for the soup I was making and had to come up with some pronto. This fit the bill and was great tasting. I won't bother with canned anymore.

I have always just kind of done my own thing when making enchiladas because I didn't have a recipe for the sauce and I didn't want to by the store brands.  When I found this recipe I thought I'd give it a try and it turned out great.  I made two changes I used chicken broth instead of water as some of the reviews suggested, also I didn't have any tomato sauce so I used a 6oz can of tomato paste and an extra 6oz of chicken broth. While the sauce was simmering I browned my meat added some of the same spices to it; after my sauce had simmered I added some of the sauce to the meat mixture made up my enchiladas and poured the rest of the sauce on top before baking them in the oven.  I'll use this recipe from now on.  Thanks Sara

Glad I tried this. I always bought enchilada packets before - never knew how easy it was! I only used 3/4 cup water, a bit more onion, chili powder and cumin, and added some diced chiles. Really really good!

This simple recipe is an absolute keeper. I will add it to my recipe collection to pass on to my daughters! I think this is best used on corn tortillas (I tried both) The great thing about it is that you can adjust it to your personal taste so easily and it still turns out great every time!!!!!!

This sauce was great. It will be my new recipe from now on. I actually did NOT double the chili powder...in fact, I may use just a touch LESS than what the recipe calls for next time. I found the sauce to be a little "strong" if you will, so I added 1T of sugar, and it was perfection. Also, I didn't have any chicken stock on hand, so I used beef stock (1 1/2 cups). A+ recipe. Some advise simmering this sauce for a few hours, but I only simmered mine for about 25 minutes since I was pressed for time. But I'm sure it can only get better if you simmer it longer. Thanks for sharing this one! It's a keeper.

I made this with shredded beef enchiladas and it was fantastic. I cut back on the water a little, like others had suggested. Also went out on a limb and added the full 2 1/2 tsp. of chili powder and it was just perfect. No leftovers!

Simply fantastic.  Used my homemade salsa and this turned out wonderful.  I am now officially done buying canned enchilada sauce.

This is soooooo good. I didn't have any salsa, so I omitted it, but it was still very very yummy!  I will use this again and again.  Thanks!

Sauce was so good.  We used it over our burritos.  My kids loved it to dip chips in.  We will be using this often.

Too much like spaghetti sauce for my taste.  I used tomato paste because the recipe said 6oz., so that might have been the problem.  I'll just go back to my own version.  Thanks

Delicious. Thanks Sara for introducing us to an easy and great tasting enchilada sauce.  I did cut the water to 1 cup and there was still plenty.  Thanks again!  We'll be using this over and over.  My husband was very impressed.  As suggested by another reviewer, I made this with Chicken Enchiladas I.   Fantastic combo!

What a great sauce!  I used a mild salsa and the chili powder gave it just enough of a kick for me.  I paired this sauce with the Chicken Enchilada I recipe on this sight.  Fantastic!

Really tasty and fast and versatile, could be used in place of many tomato sauce dishes.
This is the second time making it and I had forgotten how good it is.

These are the best enchiladas I have ever had. I used leftover potroast and the Red Enchilada Sauce from this site. For the tortillas I used a tip from another site and sprayed them with cooking spray on both sides and baked them on cookie sheets at 300 degrees for about 5 minutes. I will be planning this for my potroast leftovers every time!

Great recipe.  Start the sauce while you're cooking up the rest of your meal and it's done when your enchiladas are.  No more canned stuff for my family.  Thanks, Sara.

Really excellent base.  I'd never made my own enchilada sauce before, it always seemed like too much work, but this was very easy and totally worth it.  I made it the first time exactly like the recipe and it wasn't hot enough for me but the next time I made it I added more of all the spices and it was fabulous.  Best of all there's no vinegar taste like you'll find in almost every purchased sauce.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll be making this again!

This is the very best. I didn't measure anything, probably used less water and added some tabasco, and made a double batch. I used it for tacos and enchiladas. It was great and a great item to have in the fridge to spice things up.  GREAT !

my family doesn't react well to packaged mixes, so I am forced to make sauces homemade using my own spices and eliminating any MSG or ingredients that they react to.  This sauce is excellent.

Easy and excellent. Served it atop Chicken Enchiladas II.  Changed salsa to 1 cup; reduced water to 1 cup.  Better than restaurant quality!

This is definitly good.  Great flavor.  The only change I did was using 15ozs of tomato sauce.  Everything I follow to the T.  The sauce came out perfect not too runny and not too thick, just perfect.  Thank Sara

I love this sauce ! I have tried many different enchilada sauces from store bought to homemade , and this was the best . The only thing I did differently was I doubled  the recipe  and left out the water so I could add it to my dish. This is a great sauce !

This tastes so much better than enchilada sauce from a can.  Very quick and easy recipe.  NOTE: I used only 1/2 cup water and it worked perfectly for my 6 enchiladas.

This is great sauce.  I did have the same problem as others with it being too runny but sprinkled some flour in it to thicken it up... I am such a fan of Anne Marie's Enchilada Sauce on this site, but after trying this I think I will alternate between the too.  Thanks for sharing!

I tripled the recipe to use in my enchilada casserole, and felt it too watered down.  So next time I'll cut back on the water.  tasted pretty similar to something I threw together once.  Not bad.  Just will play around with it a little bit.

We really liked this, though my husband couldn't tell the difference between this and the Old El Paso canned version. So for all the effort I guess I will stick the can. If I am out, this is an excellent standby.

Yep, it's great!  I forgot to buy enchilada sauce when I was shopping and found this recipe - it was WAY better anyway and much less expensive.  Plus, you probably have everything on hand to make it.  I increased salsa to 1/2 cup and decreased water to 1 cup.  I'll never get the boughten stuff again.  Thanks Sara!!!

I was looking for a new sauce to use for my annual cinco de mayo party and happened to come accross this one.  It seemed easy enough.  I did not expect it to taste so amazing.  As I was cooking it, I kept sneaking a bite of it.  Will surely be using this again, as it is my new favorite sauce for enchiladas.

This is just a wonderful rich & easy sauce to make. It adds so much favor to your dishes. I used it with the "Gerry's Chicken Enchiladas" recipes on this site & it was a knock out!!

This recipe is good. But came out to watery for me so I mixed up some flour and water in a cup and added that to the sauce. Also it wasn’t spicy enough for me, so I add some cayenne pepper. Perfect!! Great recipe thanks.

I made this for the first time last night.  It required next to no effort, and the end result was smooth and aromatic.  I think it's a very versatile sauce, and being a mexican food lover, I look forward to incorporating it into future recipes.

Excellent.  I followed this recipe exactly as written.  It made my Mexican night all the better because my enchilada recipe called for a packet of enchilada mix instead of the homemade kind.  I will be using this recipe again and again.

This sauce is great tasting, easy & economical! I only add a pinch more of chili powder & cumin & is perfect for enchiladas made from leftover roast. I get raves from all & repeated requests to make over & over. Now we eat roast so we can have enchiladas the next day!

I love this recipe and have used it often.  The only change I make is to add a little less chili powder because my kids find it a bit spicy.

Very easy and yummy sauce. Used 1.5 Tblsp of Chili powder one time i did this which still gives you a bite and isn't as spicy, but if you want to cool it down which i did because my lack of chili powder I used 1 Tblsp. Great economical enchilada sauce!

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe.  I was a little skeptical about the oregano and basil in it--that seemed more Italian food than Mexican to me, but it turned out so good!  We ate it with black beans and rice and it was awesome. Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

A keeper!  Easy to make..very good.  The only change I would make is to add some cooked hambuger that is finely ground up.  This will give the suace a thicker and richer flavor.

I added some cayenne to give it more of a kick.  I just estimated the seasonings, and it turned out great.  I also added a bullion cube rather than salt - made the flavor a bit stronger.

A better name for this is reddish-black sauce. I made this tonight to top our chicken burittos and it was terrible. It was sort of greasy and tasted very bland.

This enchilada sauce was tasty and easy to make. Much better (and cheaper) than the store bought kind.

Quick and easy to make. My family really liked it. I thought the sauce was a little thin. Maybe next time I will try to thicken it a little. I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipie.

I usually use canned sause, but had unexpected company & no time to run to the store to get additional cans.  I was able to make this sauce from everyday staple items in my pantry & it turned out wonderful.  I like my sauce a bit thicker tho' so I added some Wondra.  No more cans for me!

Excellent!!!! Very simple, prep time maybe.. 5 mins. And then just let it go!! Served over beef and bean enchiladas. Next time I will double recipe. I also added a little more chili powder than it called for. Awesome!!

I don't know enough abbout enchilada sauces to give this a 5, but this was very good. I used this sauce with the Beef Enchiladas on this site (used this sauce for outside of enchiladas). Everyone loved how the enchiladas came out.

This sauce had excellent flavor.  It received rave reviews when I used it to top my beef enchiladas.
