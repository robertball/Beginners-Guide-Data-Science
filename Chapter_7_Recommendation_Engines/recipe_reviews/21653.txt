Ok I liked this recipe, but only gave 4 stars because you should NEVER soak mushrooms.  All that does is add more moisture to them....and makes them soggy.  They were a little dry, but the flavor is nice.  I will probably add to my recipe file...and make again.  Thanks for the post.

NEVER, EVER, soak mushrooms in water! This is a definite no no when preparing them as they'll end up soaking up all that water. Simply wipe them with a damp paper towel. The filling was very good, although I cheated and used Boursin herbed cream cheese instead of having to add my own seasonings. I also took it a step further and placed the mushrooms on a small square of Phyllo dough and wrapped them up into little bundles before I baked. Very nice appetizer Lynda and thanks!

I love stuffed mushrooms and thought this recipe was quite good, however, next time I won't soak the mushrooms first as it made them kind of soggy.

This recipe tremendously dissapointed me..I feel that the mushrooms were over wet..and that the celery played a horrible part in the overall dish. The filling left much to be desired..there are numerous changes to be made to this..please do not try this at home, unless under the eye of a trained professional...It was incredibly bland...I am glad I experimented before serving to guests.

Not a big fan of this recipie.  Soaking them in water and lemon made them extremely watery.
They were bursing with water when we ate them.  Also, the uncooked onion and celery made for an
unpleasant crunchy texture.  They were also bland.

Cut the recipe.  I used imitation crab and the flavor just wasn't there.  Next time I'd use real crab..and up teh spice a bit more.

This is a great recipe. I did change a few things though. I skipped the soaking in lemon juice and pouring the water over the mushrooms. Then I added 1-2 cloves of garlic and near the end of baking time I topped with mozzarella cheese until browned.

Very good...I didnt soak the mushrooms. Rinse and pat dry then put just the caps (unstuffed) in the casserole dish with a few pats of margarine. Put the dish in the preheated oven just til the butter melts and then toss the caps in it. This keeps them moist and flavorful. I had no celery, so I used scallion and added some minced jarred roasted red pepper (pimiento). Yum!!!

Great recipe.  I used 10 large mushrooms, instead of the small ones, and my husband even loved the recipe!

Crabs are too expensive for the taste of these mushrooms. No one liked them that much so I had to throw away a lot of the wasted crab meat. Plus it took so much time to prepare them I got a little discouraged to make the mushrooms appetizers anymore.

The filling is good. 
I added some shredded parmesan and some shredded mozzerella to it, as well as the chopped up mushroom stems and some finely chopped spinach for a splash of green color. I was not crazy about the actual mushrooms that the filling sat in. I think I left them in lemon juice too long (did not wash them in water, that's just silly) and they took on a lemon-y taste that I just didn't like. I think I would try a very light saute in butter for the mushroom bases the next time. I will definitely try this recipe again. I would leave the celery out next time because celery is just s strong flavor that I don't really like, and I would add some chopped roasted red peppers at Christmas to have red and green in the filling.

These mushrooms were SOOOOOOOO good! They were gone in no time. My sons, ages 16 and 18, gobbled them up and asked for more. They didn't even want dinner, just more mushrooms. Preparation was a little time consuming, but obviously worth the trouble. I will make these over and over! Thanks!

My review is for the filling only in this recipe. Spot on in flavor, texture. Family "stole" the filling and was putting it on snack crackers so I didn't have enough to fill mushrooms! I added a little Old Bay, as I like that flavor with any seafood. Solid A+.

Loved this recipe, definitely soak the mushrooms, just make sure you drain them well first, open side down on paper towel.  I added a few drops of tabasco and halved the recipe.  Used green onion instead and didn't use celery.

The recipe as written is pretty bland.

Regarding the soaking - I tried it soaking the mushrooms and not soaking the mushrooms and both ways were watery but soaking them was more flavorful. 

These are the changes I made: increase bread crumbs to 4 Tbsp, increase salt to 3/8 tsp., increase crab meant to 8oz, add 1/4 tsp parsley, add 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. When soaking the mushrooms I drizzled LIME juice on them because that is all I had and only rinsed them off with hot water, didn't really soak them. The texture and taste was much better with the lime soak/rinse. The extra breadcrumbs really soaked up the water and the extra salt let all the flavors really come out. 

Also, be sure to blend the ingredients as the recipe states, don't just chop them up. I HATE celery but you can't even taste it since all the ingredients are blended together.

I wish I'd read all of the reviews:  soaking in water was not optimal for this recipe.  The filling was okay, but needed some oomph, which might be attained by adding parmesan cheese.  I'll give it another whirl and see if the modifications make it better.

THe recipe is outstanding. To add a little zip to this recipe I added a pinch of dill weed and also a 4 oz. can of shrimp. For those that are not thrilled with mushrooms, I also stuffed tiny baked potatoes and cooked as directed. What favorite with everyone!

An excellent recipe for small appitizers.  I prepared it using whole Portobello mushroom caps and used it as a main dish with a small side salad.  It is very delicious and lends itself to variations beautifully.

Everyone loved these.  You can also use the filling to stuff new potatos that have been baked beforehand for those, "I don't eat fungus" people.

Tried this with the lemon juice/ boiling water and just rinsed and pat dried. The lemon juice does add a nice flavor and I think it is a good idea. The watery issue was evident using both methods... due to the raw veggies in the filling. I would suggest cooking the celery and onion , letting cool and then mixing with other ingredients. This did require more seasoning for my taste
