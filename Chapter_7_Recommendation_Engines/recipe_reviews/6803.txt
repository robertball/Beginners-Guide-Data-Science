I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for half the oil, 6 T. cocoa and 2 T. oil for the baking chocolate, cut the sugar to 1-1/2 cups and used chocolate chips instead of nuts. Even my kids who turned up their noses at the zucchini loved it!

This bread is wonderfully moist, everyone raved about it!  Only thing is it didn't taste chocolatey, I would suggest doubleing the chocolate added.  But it is so good that the chocolate really wasn't missed!

I made this today as muffins, and our children loved them.  It took a few minutes to grate the zucchini, but other than that, they were quick and easy to make.

A GREAT recipe!!  My 15 month old is in this "phase" where he doesn't want to eat veggies, and I try to get them inside him any way I can.  He loves chocolate, hence he loves this bread!  I modified it somewhat to make it lower in fat by substituting half of the olive oil for pureed prunes and put only 3/4 of the sugar required.

Best Chocolate Zucchini bread I've made.  I have pledged to make 25 loaves of bread for our church's booth at the local festival so I tried this recipe out on my Ladies Circle first.  They all thought it was great as did my family so part of my 25 loves will now be made from this recipe. I'm sure there will be some very happy people out there who are fortunate enough to buy my bread.

Made these as muffins, they were wonderful!!  It made about 20 muffins total. Few things I did:

1) threw in a cup of carrots instead of chocolate
2) They were ready in about 40 minutes, so start watching & smelling early. 
3) the sliced almonds were so good in this I would throw in more!

This bread was way too dry--we were all mightily disappointed!  I also didn't particularly like the addition of the almonds; it might have been better with pecans or walnuts.

A very nice moist bread. Have thrown out my old recipe for chocolate zucchini bread that my daughter gave me and after I gave her a partial loaf of this, she probably will too as she liked it as much as I did and immediately asked for the recipe.

This was okay.  I know if I put it in the break room at work and all of it doesn't get eaten, that's a problem.  It's good if you need to get rid of zucchini in the garden.  Wouldn't make it again.

This was a great recipe.  It's easy, quick, and sooo good!  I made it for my brother in law, who loves zucchini bread but won't eat anything I make.  He took half a loaf to work for lunch!  Even my kids ate it.  What a wonderful way to eat veggies.

Fantastic! Rave reviews and requests for recipe. The only thing I did different was to use 6 tablespoons unsweetened  baking chocolate powdered.  Also added more zucchini a cup more. and chocolate chunks! The best chocolate zucchini bread I ever had!

My family loves this bread.  I've made four batches in the last 3 weeks.  I omitted the nuts because my kids don't like them.  Instead of buying squares of chocolate, I just melted a 1/2 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips in the microwave.  I rarely buy chocolate squares but usually have chocolate chips on hand.  This bread also freezes well.  I put individual slices in zip loc bags for school lunches.

Very good bread.  I made mine with whole wheat flour, used 1.5 cups of brown sugar, added an extra cup of zucchini and threw in some chocolate chips.  Delicious.

I didn't have the nuts and left them out.  Result was still great. Will be making some as gifts when the rest of my zucchini comes in.

This was delicious, I used 1/2 cup applesauce in place of 1/2 of the oil, used 6 heaping tbsps of cocoa + 1 tbsp oil instead of chocolate squares.  Put 1/2 cup chocolate chips and in 1/2 of the batter I added 1/2 cup chopped almonds, therefore I had two varieties.  Cooked at 350 for only 50 minutes.  It was excellent, everyone loved it!!

This recipe was awesome! I used 6 tablespoons cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons melted butter instead of chocolate squares. I also didn't use almonds at the husband's request. I used a powdered sugar/milk frosting for the top. My husband said that it's like a big doughnut, and I agree. It's delicious! I'm definitely making more!

I recalculated for 16 servings, cut the sugar by half, used almond extract and half a cup of chocolate chips, a tiny bit of milk, and 1/4 cup of oatmeal to make muffins. Turned out perfectly, though I needed to adjust the baking time for the muffin pan. Yummy! :)

It needs more chocolate and it was a little dry.  I will probably add chocolate chips to this one next time I make it, oh and chop up my almonds a lot more.  Not sure how to fix the dry-ness, maybe the chips will do it.

I am not much of a baker, but this zucchini bread came out moist, did not dry out over the couple of days I had it, and the folks at work I shared it with said it was delicious.  Instead of mixing the chocolate in, I went the chocolate chip route, flouring my chocolate chips before adding to ensure they did not sink to the bottom of the bread.  This will be my means of making zucchini bread come the end of next summer when I have a bounty of zucchini.

Delicious bread.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  Tip:  put the chocolate and the oil into a medium-size microwave-safe bowl and heat for 3-4 minutes.  You will end up with beautifully melted chocolate.  One note, I baked this in a 9x13 pan instead of bread pans; baked for 40 minutes and it was totally done.  Oh and used walnuts (which I toasted before adding) rather than almonds b/c that's what we had around, and those were very nice in this recipe.  Oh, and also used whole-wheat flour (can't even tell; the bread is still very moist and delicious!).

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because we did put a bit more chocolate in it. It was still outstanding. The kids are destroying the whole batch like little vacuums as I type. Great way to get veggies in the kids!

This bread is sinfully good!  The only thing I changed was that I used walnuts instead.  I had them on hand and they are good for you too!  I froze them in slices for lunches.  It tastes great when in it's cold/frozen state---give it a try.

This one is a definite keeper--only changes I made was to add pecans in place of the almonds and added cup of semi sweet chocolate chips--the girls at work ate it up, you don't even need any frosting on this one--moist and wonderful--also I didn't have unsweetened chocolate so I used real cocoa--turned out wonderful!

I added a mashed banana and some oatmeal to the recipe. Made it into muffins for the kids' lunchboxes. It was a good way to hook some veggies into dessert.

My bread turned out well.  One change I made was that I traded the almonds for crushed walnuts.  Because this calls for 2 loaves and I only have one pan, I cooked my first one to the time on the recipe and it burned on the edges.  I cooked the second one for 45 minutes instead of 60 and it made a world of difference - it was not burned and more moist!  I'd make this again.

Really yummy! I ommited the almonds and topped with a powdered sugar/vanilla glaze. Kids never knew they were eating zucchini.  :)

Overall I thought this recipe was great, but I made a few adjustments when I made it.  I used twice as much chocolate, substitued applesauce for half of the oil, and ommited the almonds.  Even with the applesauce instead of the oil, it was still nice and moist.  I think next time I make it, I am going to put chocolate chips in it and then it will definately be five stars!

I didn't have any squares of chocolate, so I substituted some melted semisweet choc chips and some cocoa powder. I also stirred in some semisweet chips at the end. It was wonderful!

Very yummy!  I wanted to make it more healthy so I used  1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour, used egg substitute, and 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.  I didn't have the chocolate, so I used 6 tablespoons cocoa and 2 tbls butter.  I will definitely make it again!

I made this recipe last night...so yummy. I did do some swaps tho...I used 1 1/2 c. sugar in the raw, 1/2 c. plus 2 T of oil, 6 T. cocoa, 1/2 c. applesauce, and  1c. chocolate chips instead of the almonds. It was not overly sweet like some quick breads can be. I didn't use the glaze...just didn't think it needed it. It was "chocolate-ity" just as is.

Great! I didn't have any cinnamon,almonds or baking chocolate so I threw in a handful of choco chips, and used between 1/4 and 1/2 cup cocoa powder in the dry ingredients. It came out great! My husband and son love it, and we're gifting some to a family friend :D Thanks for the great recipe.

I agree that it's not chocolately enough to be called chocolate zucchini bread, but I added some mini-chocolate chips and that seemed to do the trick.  Also, I subbed applesauce for the oil, wheat flour for 1/3 of the total flour, and egg whites for eggs - healthier and still a big hit!  Will definitely make again.

Although this is a good standard bread, I found it to be dry. Even though I only cooked it for 50 minutes instead of the 60 called for. Maybe soem additional zucchini and less cook time might moisten it. The next time I will try it as a muffin recipe, it has a good basic flavor, just needs more moisture. The sugar glaze was a must, I used only a drizzle, perhaps more of a full covered "frosting" works better.

Great recipe! I wanted to make 2 full size loaf pans so I made 1.5 of this recipe and added more chocolate than called for.  For a 1.5 batch I added 4 ounces of melted semisweet chocolate and about 1/4 cup coco powder.  I also toasted the almonds for extra flavor and texture.  The bread turned out perfect.  Topped it off with a simple white glaze.  It's a keeper!

I have lots of zucchini to use up.  I halved the sugar and used cocoa powder/veg oil instead of bakers chocolate.  Cooking time is a bit long, mine were done in about 40 min.  Kids loved it!

i used 2 squares of bittersweet and it was a good chocolate flavor. I also made one loaf and 12 cupcakes. When I shredded my zucchini it seemed watery and therefore I squeezed out a little of the water. I used silvered almonds and just smashed them alittle, loved it. This is a great recipe and worth trying, you will use again and again.

Wonderful zucchini bread!  I followed the directions but I did add a little more cinnamon.  I also glazed this with a powdered sugar, butter, milk and vanilla glaze.  YUM!  I am making several more loaves this week.  Thanks for sharing!

This was decently good, but it needed far more chocolate and I feel like it had an awful lot of sugar and oil...I think I'll look for another recipe rather than making it again.  If I can't find anything better, then I'll make it again.

Good bread, I think I slightly increased the amount of zucchini, and it's definately not dry.  It is very stuck to the pans, though, and I did grease them; parchment paper may work better.  My chocolate solidified into little pieces, so I have not got nice chocolately looking bread, but it's still tasty.

I have this recipe as well and I have done a couple of variations to it. One, back when my daughter was very young, I made it into cupcakes and frosted them. She had no idea she was eating veggies! Second, just last week, I used yellow summer squash in place of the zucchini. It turned out great! Even the people at work couldn't tell the difference. I am going to try a few of my other zucchini recipes using squash now.

I made for or five loafs of this bread and gave them out to a few neighbors and friends.  Everyone said it was a number one recipe.  I use the Gardelie (not right spelling) chocolate squares, many felt it was best with that chocolate.

Awesome recipe!!! I had to substitue bittersweet chocolate squares for the unsweetened chocolate because that's all I had on hand, but they turned out amazing.  I made muffins and they are so moist and just the right amount of sweetness and chocolate flavor.  Love it!!!!

I only had semi-sweetened chocolate squares at home, so used these and used 1 cup applesauce and 1 cup sugar (instead of 2 cups sugar).  I doubled the recipe and it worked fine - made 2 loaves, 12 regular and 12 mini muffins.

This was really excellent.  I added the entire unsweetened chocolate bar, 4 ounces, I think.  I also added heaping cups of zucchini so it was a bit more than 2 cups.  The kids absolutely love it and it doesn't need a thing on it to enjoy.

I didn't have to glaze this, it was so sweet and yummy by itself!  I did at a little more chocolate, thanks to the reviews.  It was so moist.  Even my veggie and nut hating son ate this up!

Was very chocolaty but a little dry.  Those that like very dark chocolate will love this one.  Will try again, but will probably add something to aid the moisture content.

Definitely a keeper -- very moist, but not gummy. After reading other reviews, I added a 3rd square of chocolate and 1/8c of cocoa powder. Yum. I didn't do the glaze, but didn't miss it. Both loaves disappeared in the break room at work in less than 15 minutes.

I read the reviews for this recipe before I made it. My adjustments made it a perfect chocolate flavor and it was nice and moist. I added 1/2 can of pineapple and used 4 squares of chocolate instead of 2. I am a caregiver for the elderly and my client is the one that told me to use pineapple. I took her a loaf of the chocolate loaves I made and she said it was delicious. My neighbors really liked it also. We share things we bake and are totally honest about what we think.

Look no further, this is the only recipe you’ll need for a delicious zucchini bread!   
I played around a little and used 1.5 cups of white sugar and .5 of brown sugar along with almond extract.  Threw in some chocolate chips and it was absolutely delicious:).

I added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder to make these more chocolatey and they turned out great!  Made muffins and baked for about 16-18 mins.  May add some chocolate chips next time. Very moist and delicious!

Yummy, I made it with 2c whole wheat flour and unrefined coconut oil. Loved the coconut with the chocolate.

I made this as muffins, and I followed the recipe except for subbing applesauce for half of the oil. I wasn't so pleased with using melted baking chocolate; when you add it to the cold batter it shreds into small pieces instead of mixing. So next time I'll use cocoa powder instead. You have to watch this in the oven as it goes from underdone to overdone fast! I checked my muffins at 19 mins and they were still all gooey so I put them in another 10 mins and they were dry and hard!

A good base recipe! I used applesauce in the place of oil, egg beaters for 2 of the eggs, and honey and raw sugar in place of 1cup of the sugar....and only used 1/2 cup-ish of white sugar. They are moist and good. If I remake them I will use only one-ish cup of sweetener. I added chocolate chips to part of the batter for the kids. My anti veggie daughter ate one! (Yes, I told her they had squash in them before she ate!) I do agree with others to more cocoa if you want a true chocolate taste.

My kids love chocolate muffins from our local coffee shop.  This recipe is the closest I've come to matching those; these muffins are delicious and moist!  I substitute half the oil for applesauce to make them a little healthier and add a cup of chocolate chips.

This bread is a little on the dry side and not very chocolatey.  The "Chocolate Zucchini Bread I" recipe is moister and has a lot more chocolate flavor to it.  I won't be making this one again.
