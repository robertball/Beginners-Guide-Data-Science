Turned out nicely but we could hardly taste the coffee flavor. I'll definitely try it again but with more instant coffee granules. Turned out nicely but we could hardly taste the coffee flavor.

If you are looking for a chewy fat chocolate chip cookie this is it. Not thin and crispy or cake like - these are perfect. You don't taste the coffee - probably could leave that out. Thanks for a great recipe.

These weren't too bad. I had some pecans that I needed to use so decided that I'd try this recipe. I screwed up and added an extra egg (so added some more flour to try and counterbalance that out) and since I didn't have any instant coffee I used some Bailey's instead. They had a great flavor but weren't too different from most other chocolate chip cookies that I've had.
