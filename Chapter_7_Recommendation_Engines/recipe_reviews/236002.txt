This received a rare all family (of 5) approval! Even my pickiest went back for more. I doubled the recipe and based on what I had on hand used both shredded cheese and Campbell's cheesy soup. I also only had one package of cream cheese for the double recipe, but there was no lack of creamy flavor. Will definitely make again!

Delicious!   I followed the recipe, though I did use frozen white/yellow sweet corn, as opposed to canned, and I also prepped both pans (the white sauce and the veg) at the same time on different burners to reduce cook time.  I also couldn't resist adding 2 tsps of yellow mustard to the white sauce and I'm glad I did; it really worked well.  This is a very rich and hearty soup.  THANKS for the recipe!

This was so good! Such a great use of left over ham.  One of the reviews said they used half the cream cheese so I did the same since mine wasn't low fat.

Made this recipe tonight.  It was the easiest and fastest chowder I have made.  Substituted laughing cow Swiss cheese for the cream cheese (I didn't have any) turned out great!  I will definitely keep this in my repitoir :)

My family loved this chowder! I have 5 children 6 years and under, and we ALL liked it. I did leave out the corn though, only because I was not sure if the kids or my husband would like the corn in it. I imagined it making the texture wierd. But sometime maybe I will add it and see what they think. :) This also does excellent as leftovers!

We loved it!  Although, to start off,  I always saute my vegetables (potatoes, onions, garlic) in butter. I think it makes the soups taste better. Then I followed the recipe and absolutely loved it!

I'm sorry for the low rating but this was a flop here. It didn't have a ton of flavor & the corn did NOT belong in this. Def would've preferred this as a ham & potato soup without crunchy/chewy kernels of corn to chew, chew, chew.

Really yummy! I sautéed onions in butter before adding water and potatoes as suggested, added a nice rich flavor. I also added a little yellow mustard to cheese sauce as suggested, also a good suggestion. This will be made again, everyone agreed!

I did not use corn, but instead used about 1/2 head of cauliflower that I ran through the food processor. It was a hit!

We all really enjoyed this chowder!  It was a tad thick, so I just added water to thin it out a bit.  Other than that, it was a great way to use our leftover ingredients!!

I made this, kids loved it, instead of the flour to thicken, I puréed about a cup of ham with water to thicken the stock.

This tasted wonderful though personally I would have added a bit let cream cheese, it's a little over powering.  I know I'll be making it again in the near future.

This hit the spot on a cool October evening.  I chose not to peel the potatoes, I just scrubbed them and cubed them.  The optional diced carrots and celery were added.  I didn't measure them, just added a nice amount to the mix.  I had to add additional milk as it was so thick you could have eaten it with a fork.  I didn't measure it, I just added a small amount at a time until it reached the consistency I was looking for.  The recipe doesn't say if you should drain the corn or not.  Because of the thickness, I did not drain the corn.  Served this with a few slices of crusty beer bread and we had an enjoyable dinner.

My Grand Daughter loved this! Made it for her birthday as she requested. She is a very picky eater and I was so happy she loved it. I used the Green Giant Steamable Corn with Butter Sauce.

Angela, the author of this recipe, is right.  It's a great base.  As she suggested, I added carrots, celery, some ham stock left over from our Easter ham and extra sharp cheddar.  I used frozen corn and cooked it a bit before adding to the soup. Also added extra corn and ham.  Extra pepper and a little more salt gave it a nice round base.   Thank you!

I absolutely loved this recipe, both easy and delicious.  Both my husband and I think it's one of the best soups we've ever had.  A perfect winter's night comfort food.
