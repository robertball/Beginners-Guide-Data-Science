I made two small changes--I used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar and I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. Though my family didn't care for it I absolutely loved it. I'll make this again just for me. I'd make it in the summertime next time--I think this would be better suited during the warm months.

I hate to have to rate a recipe and then explain all the changes, but I rarely follow directions exactly as written.  So here's my take on this basic framework.  Doubled the vinegar and halved the oil.  Added some fresh basil, lemon zest, zucchini (yellow and green) and red bell pepper.  Excellent refreshing side dish for a summer meal.  My daughter and wife both went for more.  I served it with the catfish cakes I also found at allrecipes.com.

Delicious and a huge success at the passover meal. I made a little change for guests who don't like vinegar: I used a little balsamic vinegar and some lemon juice probably less than 2/3 cup. Also I slightly steamed the vegetables (cauliflower broccoli and carrot) to make it easier on the digestion. Since then everybody has tried to make it again.

This is excellent. I recommend blanching the broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots for about 90 seconds before adding to the salad. They are a little easier on your tummy that way but still nice and crunchy.  I changed up the veggies a bit to use up a few things I had on hand - skipped the mushrooms, added green and kalamata olives, red onion, sun dried tomatoes, celery, and pepperoncinis. I also added some pepper and crushed red pepper to the dressing. I would definitely make this again - and maybe try adding feta cheese and chopped pepperoni. Yum!

I made this a couple of days ago and I used more than the recommended amounts of vegetables but it seemed a little too oily. I will use the recipe again but cut down on the amt of oil.

I resolved today to eat vegetables and bought cauliflower and broccoli. Found this recipe and it was excellent! My adjustments: 1/2 the oil sub white balsamic vinegar 1/2 tsp oregano 3/4 tsp sugar used fresh minced garlic and added 2 mint leave. I didn't have the artichokes or carrots but added a sliced zucchini and a red pepper. Everything else remained the same except I blanched the cauliflower and broccoli. It was nearly half gone for an afternoon snack and I couldn't even wait to let it marinade once I tasted it.

I love this recipe. It is so delicious. Have been making it for four years now and I am shocked that there are not tons of reviews by now. This is a great side dish that can (and needs to) be made ahead. Definately do use a slotted spoon to serve as the recipe submitter suggests. You may even cut down a bit on the oil and add extra veggies as I do. But I totally love this and it is such a great way to eat fresh veggies. Great in the warmer months. Such a unique addition to my recipe box. Thank you.

Made exactly as written and this is one I will make often in the summer. The only change I plan on making the next time is to use fresh herbs in place of the dried. This recipe screams summer picnics!

Loved these marinated veggies and they just keep getting better each day, third day now.  I parboiled the broccoli, cauliflower and carrots too as others did and cut down on the oil a little bit.

This was ok but way too much oil. This definitely tasted the best after a couple of days in the fridge. But I would recommend 1/2ing the oil.

I will make this again! You can add red peppers green peppers of your other favorites. I also served it over some leftover spaghetti pasta. It was really good.

I sauteed vegetables in balsamic vinegar and lemon juice. Then added Dijon Mustard over everything then topped over brown rice. It was so good!
