I understand different areas of Germany had different recipes and I really looked forward to Christmas as that was when we got Lebkuckens from Gramma. Her recipe did not have citron! instead she used anise, molasses and hazelnut and dough was refrigerator before working. Her Lebkuchens were my favorite cookie and they were made with so much love.

My Stepdads Mother use to make these for him a long long time ago.  He's been baking cookies all weekend and can't stop thinking about these cookies.  I think I just made his holiday bright!  Thank You so much and Merry Christmas!

As a military family, who lived in Germany, these are traditional. They harden over night, so store them in an airtight container with a slice of apple.  This will keep them soft.  I made the glaze in a double boiler, this allowed me to keep it warm and not burn it. I didn't get the glaze up to 230 as suggested, but I did get it up to 200.  It turned out fine.  I substituted candied pineapple for the citron, since that was the only candied fruit available this time of year.  It gave the cookies a nice citrus flavor. I may even try candied ginger in the future. My mom also told me, after I made them, that you can substitute orange zest and juice for the lemon.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

There are as many recipes for lebkuchen as there are German grandmothers!  In my family Christmas wouldn't be Christmas without lebkuchen.  I make Grandma's recipe that she got from her grandmother.  She used the candied fruit that's used in baking fruitcake, but no nuts.  This is a four-day process with making the dough and chilling it overnight, baking and icing the cookies, and letting them sit for 48 hours in air-tight containers with slices of soft white bread to make them chewy.  Then they are shipped to family all over the country.

This was the best and most traditional Lebkuchen I've made. I did not use the Citron, and I've never seen it used. I served to my European friends and they agreed it was like home. :-)
Thanks will use this again.
