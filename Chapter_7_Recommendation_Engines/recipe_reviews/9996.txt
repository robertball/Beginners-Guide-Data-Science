Good recipe. But I do have a comment on the comments! I am astounded that people change a recipe for a baked item and then complain when it doesn't turn out well. Baking=chemistry. You cannot "decrease the flour and add more peanut butter" without changing the end result! It is not like soup where you can add some of this and take out some of that... soup will still be soup, albeit with a different flavor. Cookies and other baked good rely on fairly precise measurements--you can't just change things without the right sort of re-balancing of ingredients. Ok! End of rant.

It's true!  These are so chewy!  I, too, dropped them by spoonfuls and baked them for 9 minutes.  Hint:  Since they don't "spread," you can cram several onto one cookie sheet.  That adds up to less baking!  Definitely try these!

These turned out great!  For a Christmas cookie, I replaced 1 cup of chocolate chips with red and green M&Ms.  To get awesome texture, I chilled the dough thorougly, rolled the dough into 1/4 cup size balls, pressed some M&Ms on top, then baked at 350 for about 18 minutes.  Looked like they came from the store bakery!  Oh, and I replaced the corn syrup with honey.

This was a great recipe.  My husband is a peanut butter freak.  When a batch of cookies lasts more then a week, I know its time to find another one.  I made these last nite and they are gone by 9am this morning.  I didnt use chips though.  I had a bag of peanut M & M's and added them instead.  I also forgot I left some in the oven.  I expected them to be little rocks.  The were still as chewy and soft as they should have been.  Thank you Kathy!!

I added 1 cup crunchy peanut butter and decreased the choc chips to approx. 1 1/3 cups. Took them to work and received rave reviews.  I used a scoop that was a tad over 1 Tblsp. I baked them at 350 for 10-11 minutes. One batch I used a fork to crisscross. They came out fine but did not present as well as the scoop. This is a keeper!

I didn't find these any different from any other peanut butter cookie. Usually with this dough i wrap it around a hershey kiss and then roll in powdered sugar before i bake them. I think i like it that way better.

These cookies are very chewy and moist if you are not a crispy cookie person.  My husband and kids all loved them and gave rave reviews on taste and how chewy they were.

According to my boyfriend and his family... these cookies are "perfect" and "addicting". I replaced the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips for the extra peanutty flavor... and they've already requested I make them again :-D Wonderful recipe!

Awesome!  I did as other reviewers did and decreased the flour to about 2 cups and increased the PB to almost 1 cup. I sell my baked goodies for extra cash and these are one of the top sellers! I added toffee bits instead of choco chips.  ***My big secret to successful cookies: ALWAYS substitute 1/2 the ammount of butter called for in any recipe with shortening!!*** This makes them lighter and puff up more while still having the richness from the butter. Also, ALWAYS chill dough first to keep from spreading too much!

5 stars all the way on this one! Chewy, fluffy, and delicious. Love the chocolate chunks instead of regular chocolate chips, they look so nice. Perfect amount of peanut butter flavor if you ask me. Followed the recipe exactly (for once) and they turned out beautifully. Well, I guess I did adjust the size. Made one bath of 1/8 cup ones, baked for 12 minutes. Those were huge, so I used my cookie scoop for the rest with a 9 minute baking time. Perfection!

After so many glowing reviews and beautiful photos, I don't know what more I can add to this except for another thumbs up,  assuming I have a fair amount of credibility.  These.  Are.  Awesome good.  Thick and plump with appealing raggedy edges and tops. Gooey, chewy,  peanut buttery and sinfully chocolate.  Just looking at them makes you want to grab one and wolf it, and once you do, you're glad you did.  None of the regrets you thought you might have if you did.  These are the cookies GOOD, talented, old-fashioned home cooks used to make (and some of course, still do) and come with all the wonderful memories of some of those cooks, times, tastes and aromas associated with those days.  I can't say enough about these.  You want to know what I changed about the recipe?  Absolutely nothing.  Know what I'll change when I make them again?  You're right - absolutely nothing.  I know some peeps here in Naples who will have very appreciative, chocolaty, smiling faces tonight.  And that makes me happy.

I made these for a company picnic & everyone was still thanking me the next week at work!  I made them smaller and with milk chocolate chips.  They bake up soo thick & chewy.  I also added 1/4 cup extra peanut butter... yummy!  This is a must for any chocolate peanut butter lovers!

What a bizzare mix of reviews here...this in and of itself made me want to try the recipe.  I'm in the 'dry and cake-like' camp.  There was obsolutely nothing chewy (or addictive) about these cookies.  I did cut back on the flour and increased the peanut butter.  The only thing that I can think of that could give such a variance in the reviews is the type of peanut butter used?  I used natural. Will not make these again.

Great recipe!  I've made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty tasty.   The next time I made it with an extra generous spoon full of peanut butter, 1-1/2 cups of brown sugar (no white sugar), 1 Tbs. vanilla, and 1 cup of mini chocolate chips.  It..Was..Awesome!!

These are ok... edible and soft.  However, they don't taste very peanut buttery, and rather than the soft, chewy texture I was expecting, they turned out very dry and cake-like. I ended up giving them all away to neighborhood children, because my husband hated them and I couldn't stomach eating the entire batch.   I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Used 1C peanut butter, 2C flour, and 1 1/2C chocolate chips.  Lowered the oven temp to 350 degrees and baked for 8 mins.  Also used my mini ice-cream scoop and yielded 6 dozen cookies!!  The cookies came out perfect, were chewy, and very tasty.  The flavor was balanced -- not too much peanut butter, and not too much chocolate.  Just right.  This one is a keeper.

I just made these last night. They were great and my whole family thought so too! I had all the ingredients besides corn syrup, and ended up substituting it with 2 tbsp. of honey. Worked great! I also used less chocolate chips. Thanks for the great recipe!

My 3 year old daughter and I made these using the suggested changes of 1 cup PB and lessening the flour to 2 cups.  Instead of chocolate chips we used the Christmas M&Ms and reserved about 1/4 cup of them for her to put on the tops of each cookie.  We also used a smaller cookie scoop (1 TBS?) to make the balls and then kinda flattened them with the spatula as they came out.  They were fun to make together.  I also froze half the dough in a roll to see how that would work out if I ever wanted to make them in large batches.  The only drawback to this is that when you slice the cookies - you inevitably cut some of the M&Ms.  (Also, if you use this method - you can wait till they soften a little on the pan and your kids can still add some M&Ms)

These cookies are wonderful!  They stay nice and gooey, if you want them to.  Or just bake them a little longer for firmer cookies.  I sent a double batch to my husband in Afghanistan, and he said one of his NCOs said they taste like "love all mushed up and baked".  I did change the cookie sizes.  I rolled mine into balls only a little larger than a tablespoon, and only baked them for starting at 9 minutes.  When the bottom edges *just* start to turn golden, take them out for epic gooey goodness.  I baked some a little longer, because my dad loves his crunchy.  This recipe is a keeper.

I customized this recipe based on some of the other comments, and am glad I made these changes:  increased  peanut butter to 1 cup, decreased chocolate to 1 cup, 1-1/2 cups brown sugar (no white), honey instead of corn syrup, and 1 tbsp vanilla.  They are rich tasting, moist, and have a good balance of peanut butter and chocolate.  I plan to give some of these my crush, and I think they'll be a hit!  Note: I used 1/4 c. of dough for each cookie per the directions, but the yield was only 18, not 24.

I've never rated anything under a four on this site, but I have to say the title of this cookie is very misleading. A). It isn't chewy, it's very cake-like and B). It doesn't taste like peanut butter at all. I think that maybe people's definition of a "chewy" cookie must vary, because like one reviewer said, they should rise slightly while cooking and then sink flat while cooling. Slightly underdone in the middle. These maintained their spoonful shape, and even rose a little highter than that. The result was a somewhat dry, cake like cookie that didn't have much peanut butter taste to it. Next time I will search for just a basic peanut butter cookie recipe and add chocolate chips to it.

I was looking for a recipe that duplicated cookies like the ones our local bakery makes, and, boy, did I find it.  Since I was really in the mood for a plain peanut butter cookie, I omitted the chocolate chips and increased the PB to 3/4 cup.  The dough was very soft, so I refrigerated it for about an hour or 2 before baking (baked at 350 degrees for 12-14 minutes).  The texture of these cookies was absolutely perfect!  I think next time I'll try a different brand of PB (used Jif extra crunchy this time).  The crunchiness was great, but I would love a really rich PB taste, and this batch didn't quite have me reaching for a second glass of milk.  Thanks for the recipe.

The dough is nice to work with, as it is light and not tough or sticky like some other cookie recipes.  I use a 1/2 cup less chocolate chips but it all depends on how chocolate chipy you like your cookies.  It's not as peanut buttery as some other peanut butter cookies, but I prefer it this way as the peanut butter taste is not overwhelming.  For a little extra chew you may want to cut 2 minutes off the suggested baking time.  Everyone I gave them to liked it.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks a lot for sharing. :-)

I tried peanut butter chips instead of chocolate with a 1/4 cup more peanut butter and they were great. My whole family loved them include some who are not fans of peanut butter cookies. They were still chewy 6 days after I made them.

Fantastic, Chewy, Divine! I used 1/2 choc. chips, 1/2 p.b. chips :) Mmm mmm good! I used my reg. Tbl. sized cookie scoop and placed them 1.5" apart, they did just fine, not a lot of spreading. Baked for 10-11 min., cooled on the baking sheet for a min. or two, then to a wire rack. I love the cracked appearance these get when they cool! Perfect sweeteness & a perfectly chewy cookie! Goes great w/ a big ole glass of milk!

Really easy and good!  I used 1&1/3cup milk chocolate chips, and pure peanut butter (no other additives).  I was worried they wouldn't be sweet enough using the pure peanut butter but they were great.  The only thing with this recipe (as with all peanut butter cookie recipes) is that you really have to stay close to the oven to make sure the bottoms don't get brown.  I baked them on a pretty low setting (300 degrees) and they were done in about 12 minutes.

The BEST! Slight changes I made; increased PB to 1 cup, used all brown sugar, decreased flour to 2 1/4 cups.  I used a mixture of mini chocolate chips and M&Ms.  Rolled them into balls, flattened ever-so-slightly with a cup dipped in white sugar and topped with a few more M&Ms.  Baked at recommended temp for 11 minutes.  These turned out BEAUTIFUL and TASTED EVEN BETTER.  Yummy!

These are delicious but the recipe needs some tweaking to be 5 stars, imo. I agree that it could do with more peanut butter, and - dare I say it? - less choc chips. They weren't as chewy as I expected, but I don't mind that. I'll make these again. Thanks, Kathy!

These cookies have a great texture... soft and chewy (my favorite)!  However, I can't even taste the peanut butter in them.  I will make them again, and follow the adjustments another reviewer made, by doubling the peanut butter and cutting back on the chocolate chips a bit.

These are good but I didn't read the reviews before making them and I learned quickly that they burn if you cook them for 12 to 14 minutes as stated in the recipe. They only need about 9 minutes. Otherwise they are like little bricks.

I made these today and they are gone tonight, I followed the recipe and added 1 1/2 cup of old fashioned rolled oats and took the advice of others and made the peanut butter 1 cup they were wonderful with crispy edges and chewy middles. Daughter and college roommates came to visit today and when they left "accidentially" took the container with them much to my husbands disappointment. Guess what I will be baking tomorrow. With a recipe this quick I really don't mind thanks for sharing.

This is best cookie recipe I've ever used!  I made one batch with chocolate chips and another batch with toffee, and both were chewy and delicious, ever DAYS later.  Thanks so much, this will definitely be my go-to cookie recipe from now on.  =)

The title tells no lies, these are perfectly chewy cookies. Great texture and bakes off great (doesn't flatten out in the oven). This is a great pb base for adding mix-ins. Instead of chocolate chips, I put chopped up peanut butter cups in this dough. However, I think it really needs the chocolate chips to set off the peanut butter flavor. Either that or use some dark chocolate peanut butter cups. The combination of more pb/milk chocolate with the pb flavor in this cookie just struck me as a little bland.

When I first tried these, I didn't like them.  However, after letting them sit for a day or so, I liked them more.  I would make these cookies again.  However, if you want a strong peanut butter flavour, I would add more to the recipe, because I can hardly taste the peanut butter.

I made them regular sized (tablespoon+)and they were awesome.  We had company and they wanted the recipe.  The first time I made them I cooked them at the "correct" temp and they didn't spread or rise much at all.  The next time I lowered the temp to 350 and they spread more, we couldn't decide which way we liked them better.

I have made these cookies SEVERAL times and have used an ice cream scoop to make them all the same size.  Yes, they are large, but I have NEVER had them burn in my oven.  They take exactly 14 minutes and come out great.  If I take them anywhere, there are none to bring home.

Add me to the reviewers who were very disappointed in this recipe.  The batter tasted so good and I was so excited because chocolate and peanut butter are my thing and I love chewy cookies.  I just don't understand how one person makes it and it comes out chewy and my are not chewy at atll.  Will not make again.

In response to the last review (JAMESDAVE), I think it was extremely harsh.  These cookies were EXCELLENT.  They had a great peanut butter flavor, chewy texture and a great balance between chocolate and peanut butter.  It may be possible the reviewer didn't follow directions. And remember DAVEJAMES, sometimes it not what you say, it's how you say it.

FINALLY, after years of searching, I have found the perfect peanut butter chocolate chip cookie! This cookie is the perfect balance between a chewy and soft cookie.  I think the peanut butter taste is perfect but if you like ALOT of peanut butter taste, it is easy to add a bit more peanut butter!  YUM!

This recipe works as a base for a good chewy peanutbutter cookie...
Changes:
-Double peanut butter if you reall like to have the taste, I also use chunky to give the cookie more texture
-Take out 1/2 cup flour
-1/2 the amount of chocolate chips
-An I personally like to use honey instead of corn syrup.
We also had to bake longer but our oven tends to be that way for everything.  
After the changes I would give the recipe a 4 stars (I think I would use a little less surgar and add even more peanutbutter next time)

My family went goo-goo for this cookie. I loved the size as it worked great for my husband's co-workers. I thought I tasted a bit of soda, but my husband said he didn't. I may try some of the peanut butter chips with the choco chips next time too. YUMMO!

They're more like cake than a cookie and all the flavor just gets sucked out when you bake them. This is the second time i made them just to be sure i did it right and they still came out unsatisfactory.

This recipe was fantastic! Thanks for sharing.
I did however decrease the flour to 2 1/4 cups, and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup. Baked for 11 min. They were fabulous!!! Very soft and chewy, only problem is .....they don't last long..now you see them, now you don't!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I also used Peanut M&M's as one reviewer suggested and instead of using what is commonly called peanut butter these days, I used the all natural peanut butter.  The combination added a wonderful salty/chocolatly flavor, satisfying the salty/sweet craving.  I did find that 1/4 cupfull was a bit big.  The middles stayed a big too gooey for my taste, but friends said they liked them that way.  I'll be making these again, perhaps a bit smaller.  All and all, I think this is my new favorite peanut butter cookie recipe.

These were really good. Very chewy and chocolate-y, but could have used more peanut butter - will add 1/4-1/2 cup more next time.

YUM...I'm in the process of making these now.  They are fabulous!  I didn't have white sugar so I substituted with additional brown sugar.  Also, I used a med. size Pampered Chef scoop to place on pans and baked for 9 minutes.

These were really delicious!!  I used crunchy all natural peanut butter, and choclate chunks.  YUM.  They were gobbled up by my brother and husband within an hour!!  I also cut back on the sugar just a bit.  (I always do this one adjustment, and still tastes JUST as good). Only thing I would change for next time would be to use a bit more peanut butter...I LOVE peanut butter, and while the taste was there, if you are die hard PB fan like myself, you will probably want more!!  Other than that, perfection :)

I used my cookie scoop & got 44 cookies! They're very good, altho not huge on pb flavor the first day, by the 2nd day they were/are perfection! Baking time was spot-on! I love that they're soft & chewy but don't fall apart when you pick them up. Thank you!

DELICIOUS! I only used 1 1/2C of chocolate chips because that's all I had and I didn't miss it, still very delicious.  I made them jumbo as directed (I did a slightly heaping 1/4 cup) and still had to reduce the cooking time to 11-12minutes, so watch the first batch until you know how long they need in your oven : ) Everyone loved them!

These are THE perfect cookie--and addictive is the key word. I never get cookies to stay chewy and fresh for a couple of days after they are made but these do!! People are asking for them- I think I could sell them. Changed nothing except used half peanut butter chips and half chocolate chips. Absolutely wonderful!!!!!

These are awesome, and I love the fact that they stay chewy.  I made the recipe as is, but will need to adjust this next time and see if they're just as good if I add more peanut butter.  Some of our guests didn't seem to realize they were peanut butter cookies.

Very good texture...just the way a cookie should be. Very subtle peanut butter flavor, which is the only reason they're not getting a "5". I like to really taste the peanut butter!

Followed the recipe, but doubled it.  I rechecked it after the first batch came out flattened instead of stack-like as in the picture, and I had followed the recipe correctly. Not sure why they didn't stay mounded, but they baked faster and got too dark at 12 minutes.  Decreased size and bake time, and they are better, but still flat.  Not what I expected.

This was really good! It wasn't crumbly or thin. It was soft, SLIGHTY chewy, and just really good. Everyone loved them because they weren't that sweet and had just the right amount of peanut butter. But, I did make only half a batch so your cookies could turn out differently.

I'm giving this recipe a five star even though my cookies didn't taste right. They did turn out really chewy with great texture, my cookies tasted "waxy", and that is my fault. Instead of adding 1/2 cup of peanut butter, I only added in (what I had left) 1/4 cup. Also adding in chocolate/peanut butter swirled hersey morsels. Sounds like it would be an excellent swap? Not entirely. I reccomend sticking strickley with this recipe, I'm sure they will turn out delicious!

As much as we love peanut butter and chocolate in this house, I was surprised that I had never tried this recipe.  Followed it as written, and it is the best.  Soft, chewy, not flat, peanut buttery goodness!

based on the other reviews, I added one cup of peanut butter rather than 1/2 cup. That was the only change I made in the recipe. Perhaps I should have reduced the flour as well...not sure...because they didn't exactly turn out chewy. They weren't crunchy...but also not chewy. I made half with white chocolate chips and half with semi-sweet chocolate chips. I actually preferred the white chips. Good cookies, but not good enough for me to make again.

This recipe is amazing with a few changes.  I increased the peanut butter to 1 1/4 cups and decreased the flour by 1/2 cup.  They are chewy and delicious!  I will make these again....and again....and again... :)

As recommended by other reviewiers, I increased the peanut butter to 1 cup and decreased the flour to 2 cups. This Still didn't achieve the true peanut butter cookie base I was looking for...more like a chocolate chip cookie, with hidden peanut butter.

These were wonderful! Exactly the kind of PB cookie recipe I was looking for. I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1 cup of PB and cut the flour to 2 cups. To ensure they stayed chewy and soft longer, I cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup and added an additional 1/4 cup of brown sugar (dark, just my flavor preference) and baked for no more than 9 minutes. I also didn't make the whopping 1/4 cup size cookies, just used a regular cookie scoop. I would make this recipe over and over again.

Good cookies but not great. I added a little extra peanut butter and used bittersweet chocolate. I might make again but maybe use a little less flour so they will spread out some and be chewier.

I increased the peanut butter by another 1/2 cup. They turned out moist and perfect but I would have like a little more of a peanut butter flavor. I read some of the reviews saying they cooked quickly on the outside and were not completely done on the inside. This will be true if you don't flatten your cookie a bit. There may be chocolate but this is after all still a peanut butter cookie recipe and we don't just press our peanut butter cookies with forks so they look pretty. Any peanut butter cookie recipe would yield the same result if you simply left it in a pile. I rolled them into balls then flattened the cookie in the palm of my hand (I did not use the quarter cup). I will make these again and reduce the flour by 1/2 cup and keep the peanut butter at 1 cup to see if it can get a flavor boost. I am impressed with how soft these stayed.

Don't do what I did and double the recipe. It filled two glass covered Pyrex baking dishes. It makes A LOT.

Other than that, these came out great.
I used two packages of Kissables baking chips and a half package of semi-sweet
chips. Perfect! And not overpowering with
peanut butter, either. If I were to make this again, I would cut back on the flour by half a cup. They were a bit dry,
even when they were underbaked.

Was confused by the reviews, but gave it a shot- followed the recipe exactly, but went overboard with the peanut butter on purpose.  Turned out like beautiful store-bought cookies, they spread perfectly and were golden brown on the edges.  So easy to bake (approx. 9 minutes for large tablespoon-fuls).  Made them for a work meeting, and they were a huge hit!!  They stayed chewy and delicious.  Wonderful recipe, thanks!!

This was a good recipe, I liked the size of the cookies.  Not your average wienie little cookies, nice man sized ones for my husband.  I changed a few things, some reviewers mentioned the peanut flavor wasn't strong enough so I doubled the peanut butter.  I used a heaping teaspoon of baking soda, doubled the vanilla, omitted the water and used honey instead of corn syrup.  With the changes, it will be a permanant recipe with my family.  Thanks!

These turned out great.  I made them for the guys at work and there wasn't a crumb left over.  I thought they tasted much better the second day then the night I made them.

Yummy! I tweaked it just a bit. Instead of 2T water, I added Irish Cream instead. It gave it just a hint of complementary flavor. And I baked them in a jellyroll pan instead of individual cookies. My family has eaten half the pan already and they aren't cool yet. Thanks for a great recipe!

These are chewy and delicious. To make them five star worthy I'm going to add a cup of chopped peanuts next time. Also, be careful not to over mix the batter or it will it will make the texture more cakey instead of chewy.

these cookies were pretty good but I did double the Peanut Butter and I would also suggest using only 1 or 1.5 cups of chocolate chips. They kinda kill the peanut butter taste.  Also don't cook any longer than 10min if you make smaller cookies!

I started by making these for my ex, but they quickly turned into everyones favorite. Ive made them for the green room at a convention and now have requests to make more and more each yr. My current boyfriend loves them so much that he almost nabbed a few while they where in the freezer before this past weekends convention. Never changed the recipe except for using chocoloate chunks instead of chips. Great flavor, but do agree with the fact that they dont have a peanut butter taste really. Love the texture. Dont cook the whole time watch for brown edges and they turn out better I think.

Best cookies ever! My husband, a big peanut butter fan, loved them. I took advice and decresed flour to 2 1/4 cup, increased peanut butter to 1 cup, and used real milk choc. chips. Also, dropped onto cookie sheet by tablespoonful and cooked for 10 min. Simply wonderful!

Thank-you Kathy, these cookies tasted great and were chewy, as you said. I increased the peanut butter serving to 1 1/2 cups...as suggested by others, and reduced the flour to only 2 cups. I also reduced the cookie size of 1/4 cup...as suggested by others too...just a tad smaller. This was the first time I ever made peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, even though my boyfriend has been begging me for them, and they turned out great. He loves them!!! A tiny suggestion for others though: You might want to reduce the amount of chips in it by 1/2 a cup...esp. after reducing the amount of flour. 
Thanks again Kathy! :)

Batch #1 was good. Batch #2 was the best batch of cookies I have ever made. The second time around I mixed the margerine, pb, sugars, eggs, syrup, water & vanilla until it was very smooth and light, and limited the flour to 2 cups. Awesome recipe!

Yum, yum, yum!  These are GREAT cookies!  I added some peanut butter chips along with big chunks of Ghiradelli milk chocolate-incredible.  They stay pretty pale in color so don't be fooled when baking them-keep a careful eye on the bottoms of these.  Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing.

These were positively yummy! I doubled the recipe, and used chocolate chips instead of the chopped chocolate. There were actually too many chips (there wasn't enough dough for them to "stick" in). My husband LOVED them, and he is pickier than the kidlets! I will DEFINATELY make these again!

Wow! I was looking for a moist and chewy peanut butter cookie. These are great. With one cookie you are filled up so I will probably decrease the 1/4 cup drop. These cookies are so easy to make and yet look so professional when they come off the pan. Yummy!!!

These cookies were awesome and didn't last long!  They stay chewy for a long time.  I cut the amount of chocolate chips in half and they were still full of chocolate!  I've already been asked to make them again.

This was a great recipe! But there is one correction that I made. I used a rounded tablespoon of cookie dough, smushed them down with a fork and baked on 350 degrees.

Delicious!  These cookies are soft and chew and oh-so-good.
I used natural, no salt, no sugar peanut butter.  And we don't use corn syrup in our home so replaced with honey.  Also didn't want giant cookies so used my 2 inch cookie scoop.  Ended up making 40 delicious cookies.  My comment to people who say they were overcooked, burned etc is to know your oven.  I reduced mine to 350 degrees, they turned out perfect.

Amazing! I love these cookies, they always come out nice and thick, although not too dense or heavy. I like to use 1 cup brown sugar instead and 3/4 cup peanut butter, in my opinion it gives it better flavor. Always a hit with our guests especially when I bake them with chocolate bar chunks on the top.

These cookies are really great.  Honestly - I don't think I have a need for another choc. chip cookie recipe again.  I only made one change - trying not to use corn syrup and substituted brown rice syrup which I think made them even better!  These are the chewiest cookies ever! I also made them teaspoon sized and cook for a little less time.  LOVE!

Fantastic cookie. I used real peanut butter and that seemed to make a huge difference.  Will make again. Already have a request to, so I better hop to it.

Everyone loves these cookies!! I have read reviews and tweaked it as I've kept making it but, to me, that's just what happens when a lot of people bake the same thing! I DOUBLE the peanut butter because, even doubled, it is not overwhelming peanut butter. I reduce the flour by 1/4 cup. I switch the brown sugar and white sugar measurements...I have found that doing this makes them look more like a cookie and less like a ball! I chill the dough in the freezer (because I am impatient!) for 10 min. before and then in the 'fridge while another sheet bakes. I use a cookie scoop--much faster! I bake them for 10 min. at 375....and they turn out perfectly! So CHEWY and delicious! I have been told I should sell them in a bakery! Mmmm!

I loved this recipe! The cookie dough was firm and I was ab le to make large cookies without them going flat.
 I never used corn syrup in a cookie recipe, but I think that made the difference in this recipe. The cookies were very soft and chewy and Delicious!

I made this recently and didn't have corn syrup so just left it out, and they turned out fine. I baked part of the dough without the chocolate chips, for plain peanut butter cookies, which were a hit, and I added Ghirardelli bittersweet chips to the rest, and those were delicious too. I would definitely make this again!

yummy!
I used maple syrup, not corn syrup.  
Natural Peanut butter, with no sugar added.
I also made these with a 2tsp scoop not 1/4 cup scoop. 1/4 cup sounds yummy, but my kids would probably go into a sugar comma with a cookie that large.

An okay cookie, but tastes like my regular chocolate chip recipe, I can't even taste the peanut butter (I used extra, too.) I never use corn syrup, so I skipped it. Needs a little more something, maybe salt or brown sugar and certainly more peanut butter, atleast 1 cup. I used my mini muffin tins (24) and baked them for 9 minutes. I also made nine of the  1/4 cup dough size and  baked those for 12 minutes.

Chewy PB Chocolate Chip Cookies says it all. These cookies are super chewy with a nice peanut butter taste and chocolate chips YUM! I used milk chocolate chips. I did not make these large cookies as the recipe calls for. Used my Tbs cookie scoop, floured, because the the dough is sticky. Baked to perfection in 9 minutes. * Update * Also have made bars in a parchment lined 9x13 Baked for 23 mins * Chewy Good

This recipe is very easy and the taste is wonderful. They bake up so nicely - do not spread hardly at all, so you can fit alot of cookies on a baking sheet. I dropped by tablespoons and took 12 minutes to bake.

These were good but we couldn't taste the peanut butter.  They just tasted like chocolate chip cookies with a touch of honey (used honey in place of corn syrup)

These are good, but cut the sugar by half... plenty sweet for my taste buds.  I also used soy butter instead of peanut butter.  Very yummy!

I thought these were pretty good. They reminded me of the soft peanut butter cookie recipe from Allrecipes with chocolate chips. Just like those cookies these are soft and don't have a real strong peanut butter flavor. I actually like that they don't taste too sweet other than the chocolate chips. I make sweets for my husband's office a few times a month. I only needed about 1 1/2 dozen, so I halved the recipe. It ended up yielding 30 cookies, using a standard cookie scoop, with half the recipe. They baked in about 9 minutes.

I followed this recipe exactly and these cookies were not chewy at all, more cakey, with no flavor at all but for the chocolate chips! Very disappointing since I made these to give to family and friends on Christmas!

I made these cookies with my kids for Santa to have on Christmas Eve. They were easy to make with my small kids and the end result was good. The only complaint I have is that the cookies don't really spread (as noted by other reviewers), so we had to press them down if we wanted a thinner cookie.

This recipe was good, but I made some slight changes. I didn't have corn syrup, so I used 1 tbsp of light maple syrup, and one tbsp of honey. I changed the cooking time as well to 7 minutes because leaving them in for longer makes them a little too crunchy for my liking. When you put the dough on the pan, press it down just a little bit and keep them in for about 7 minutes. They turned out delicious with the modifications I used. Hope this helps you too!

Everyone LOVED these cookies.  I made mine with a ton of peanut m&m's and peanut butter m&m's instead of chocolate chips.  They turned out great and they stay fat, no spreading out in the oven.

This recipe is like watching a Justin Timberlake movie, good in theory but bad delivery. Bland very bland, little peanut butter flavor and cake-like even when undercooked.  I followed the recipe  exactly just was not impressed, there are much better cookie recipes out there.

These cookies are absolutely wonderful! I normally make the "tried and true" basic peanut butter cookie recipe which is always good. However, today I decided to venture out and try something a bit different. I am ever so glad I did. Everyone loved these and I will definitely make them again.

Excellent cookie!  Slightly crisp on the outside and perfectly moist and chewy on the inside.  Will use again, possibly with a little more peanut butter.  (If I had time to read the reviews, I would have known that!)  Not a real peanut butter cookie, but next time I will fix that.

Nothing spectacular.  I think they are a little bland.  I used agave nectar instead of corn syrup and added an additional 1/3 C peanut butter.  If I make them again I will add even more peanut butter and less chocolate.  I also used 1 T of dough at a time and decreased cooking time to 9 mins.

Would not make again :( I followed the recipe perfectly and they were just ordinary. Disappointed- not chewey, not enough peanut butter. People need to stop rating things with 5 stars when they make substitutions! :) rate the recipe as written- not the one you created! (but still share your subs) Still searching...

I took the chance of using light maple syrup instead of corn cyrup since I didnt have any. I used crunchy peanut butter since that's what I had. Next time I will try it as written but with these substitutions it still turned out to be the best cookie ever!!!

These cookies are excellent!  Not too much of a peanutty taste, but enough to make them chewy and wonderful.  I only had about 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips so I used milk chocolate chips to make up the difference.  Though they were great with chocolate chips, I can't wait to try them with the semi sweet chocolate chunks! I think next time I will add chopped, roasted pecans.  With that, I think they will rival the Doubletree Hotel's cookies!

While I thought these were just "ok", everyone at work thought they were absolutely delicious. I did change 4 things... I added a full cup of peanut butter because a half cup didn't seem like very much and I used chopped walnuts. The other two changes weren't exactly to the recipe. I reduced the oven temp to 350 because 375 was too hot and I used just a tablespoon to drop the cookies and not a 1/4 cup. They would have been huge! 




The comments I received were that it was just the right amount of peanut butter, not too over powering. My boss said that between the amount of chocolate and peanut butter, it was a balance so it wasn't too peanut buttery or too chocolatey. I'll keep this recipe for the holidays!

This cookies are great! Unlike other reviewers, when I made these, they spread beautifully during baking. As a result, my cookies were nice and big (and soft and chewy). I did substitute honey for the corn syrup since I didn't have any. I also loaded these babies up with chocolate chunks and chips (about 3 cups). I think I would like a little more of a peanut butter taste, but overall, these cookies were fabulous!

I made these for my boyfriend after he said some store bought cookies were better than any I'd ever made.  Adding some peanut butter chips and chopped reese's peanut butter cups made him quickly change his mind!

They're wonderful and our family's new favorite.

5 stars for this recipe.  I only made one change which was to increase the peanut butter because otherwise the dough was too stiff.  I used my tablespoon cookie scoop instead of 1/4 measure and had to bake these for 10 minutes.  Overall a great cookie with an awesome peanut butter-chocolate combination.

I did things a bit different here.. mainly because i wanted a good chewy peanut butter cookie.. didnt really want chocolate anything in it.  Instead of 1/2 cup peanut butter, I used 1 cup of crunchy peanut butter.. EVERYONE loved them at work!

after all of the great reviews i was disappointed that this cookie was just ok.  I had reservations about the low peanut butter to flour ratio but trusted the reviews and overall rating - turns out i should have trusted my experienced baker's instinct.  I actually can taste the flour in these cookies and the peanut butter flavor is very mild.  The best thing about a good peanut butter cookie is the intense richness of the peanut butter and the perfect combination of sweet and salty playing in your mouth.  This cookie delivers none of this.  This cookie is a very mild, forgettable peanut butter cookie.  keep looking.

These did not turn out for me at all. The flavor was good but they were very flat and crispy and not thick and chewy. I make cookies a couple times a week and cannot figure out why they came out this way. My daughters liked them but I will continue to look for a perfect peanut butter cookie. Thanks though!

My family liked loved these cookies. As others recommended, I doubled the amount of peanut butter and used regular chocolate chips since that is what I had on hand. I substituted honey for corn syrup. I also used a 1/8 measuring scoop in order to have smaller, yet uniformally sized cookies. Cooked for 10 minutes. Perfectly chewy and yummy. : )

Great recipe! Ive tried it with organic peanut butter in various flavors (honey peanut butter, white chocolate peanut butter) they are wonderful! They stay so chewy and moist even after a few days...not that they have ever lasted that long...

These are delicious.  The only changes I made were using mini chocolate chips as that is what I had on hand and I made smaller cookies as other reviewers had done.  I baked them for about 10 minutes and they came out great. Definitely one I will be making again.

This recipe was a lot of fun and really easy. I was a little heavy handed with my portioning, so I had to do it in two batches, but I still was able to make 23 cookies and they were huge! I'll definitely use this recipe again, but when I do I think I'll add more peanut butter. It was too subtle for me; I love to taste the peanut butter. But these cookies were definitely chewy, and they've maintained their chewiness even days after I made them.

I made these with 1 c. of mini-chocolate chips so that the peanut flavor wouldn't be overcome, as many reviewers have commented on.  It helped, but I would still like a more pronounced peanut flavor in my cookies.  Perfect texture.

I baked this recipe as directed and actually loved these cookies!  They did not have a huge peanut butter flavor, so next time I will add another 1/2 cup and possibly another 1/4 cup of oats.  I added about 3 minutes to the baking time too...but all ovens are different!  Over all, very easy and super delicious!

These are a breeze to bake. I made them with my 3 young sons. I did reduce the peanut butter to 1/4 cup and the brown sugar to 3/4 cups. We baked them in mini muffin pans a burried chopped kraft caramels in the middle for a suprise! Thanks for the great recipe!

Ok, here's the deal with these cookies.  1 c peanut butter.  2 1/4 c flour.  1 1/2 c chocolate chips, 1 t vanilla.  The original had too much vanilla; overpowering the peanut butter taste.  Omit water.  They are not as "cake like" but still chewy and very flavorful.

These cookies needed a few tweeks.  I increased the peanut butter to 1 cup and decreased the chocolate chips to 1½ cups.  I also used a 1/8 cup as a scoop and baked them for 9 minutes - and yes, they do spread while they bake.  Nice, fluffy cookies.

These were delicious nice and chewy as promised. I made just a couple of small adjustments thought. Instead of corn syrup I used mayple syrup because I didnt have any corn syrup available and instead of 1/4 cup scoops I used spoonfuls and shortened the baking time to 10 minutes. Will make again!

Not enough peanut butter flavor for me. Also I did not find the cookies to be chewy, rather they were very soft and cakey. I did not like the texture at all. Baking time is too long. Mine only needed about 9-10 minutes in the oven.

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I changed the amount of one of the ingredients.  I added 1 cup of peanut butter instead of 1/2 cup.   I've made them by dropping 1/4 cup on cookie sheets and they took 12 minutes.  I've also made them by dropping 1 Tbs. and they took 10 minutes  They were delicious either way.  I've also added peanut butter chips before to punch up the peanut butter flavor.  As far as one of the comments about people not knowing how to review, I think everyone's idea of the star system is different.  I would say 1 or 2 star is horrible while 3 three stars would be okay and so on.  I also thought these cookies had great flavor and I'm not sure why one reviewer thought they were bitter.  My husband is a peanut butter freak and he loved these.

Easy recipe and it yields great cookies!    I don't consider myself a big fan of peanut butter, but this cookies was great;  chewy, delicious, just sweet enough (or slightly less), and looks great as well.    I give this recipe 5 stars

This was a wonderfully easy cookie to make.  I followed the original recipe exactly - but did take Dianne's advice and added a cup of red and green M&M's to make them more festive for the holidays.  No need to chill the dough or roll them - just dropped them by large spoon fulls and add more M&M's to the top.    The recipe makes exactly 24 nice adult palm sized cookies.  They cooked up well in my oven at exactly 13 minutes and were soft and chewy to eat.  Big hit with the kids.  They taste like choc chips cookies with a nice sized hint of peanut butter.    These cookies look and taste great.  Will definately make again.  Double batch next time to share with others.  Great Christmas tin cookie for sure.

These cookies are absolutely the best I have ever made. Hands down. A coworker who had some said they were better than Paradise Bakery cookies. Tried modifications and believe me, the recipe is best the just the way it is. Don't change a thing. I've made them several times and they always turn out perfect. Thanks Kathy!

I too added more peanut butter and decreased the flour. I used mini chocolate chips that I had on hand. My teenage son said they were "good...very good" so that is a winner in my book!

1/2 C. peanut butter sounded a bit skimpy to me.  so, especially after reading reviews, I decided to add 1 C. peanut butter and decrease flour by 1/2 C.  I also decreased cook time to 10 minutes after the first tray came out too dark.  They came out chewy and peanutbuttery!  Yum!

Just so so, a bit too much flour, not enough peanut butter.  I will continue my search for the perfect chocolate chip peanut butter cookie.

GREAT COOKIES.... I DONT THINK DAVEJAMES KNOWS HOW TO COOK. OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS A BETTER REVIEW. THEY TURNED OUT PERFECT. CHEWY AND DELICIOUS. THE BEST PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE RECIPE I HAVE FOUND SO FAR.

Great recipe.  They were chewy and very hearty cookies.  Great for milk dipping.    I added walnuts and extra peanut butter.  I used an ice cream scoop (1/2 filled) to gauge the size.  It made so many cookies and they all looked uniform.  Yum yum!!

I made an account just to post this comment.  This is a terrible recipe if you're in the mood for "peanut butter cookies". I made the first batch exactly as the recipe called for and was very disappointed. So I read some reviews (should have done that first) and made some changes. I lowered the temp to 325 and extended the cook time to 18 mins. They tasted a little closer to what I was looking for but still not the good. This is the first recipe I tried from this site that I didn't like.

You don't need to 'know how' to write a review in order to tell people your thoughts on how a recipe tasted to you, or how it turned out for you.  I will agree, these cookies have a very subtle peanut butter taste, but I and many others (a truckload of children included!) have never found them bitter; always soft, chewy and delicious!  In my opinion, this recipe is perfect the way it is unless you do want a stronger peanut butter flavor, and in this case you can just substitute some of the butter for more peanut butter.  This recipe is a very standard drop cookie format, and with some attention to detail and practice, the cookies should always turn out amazing!

9/14/2008:  Mmmmm...my boyfriend and his daughter made these.  They added an extra 1/4 cup peanut butter.  They pressed the dough balls down with a sugared glass cup bottom.  They were VERY TASTY!
1/16/2016:  My now husband (yes, same guy as above!) made these cookies again today.  He made the same modifications of adding extra peanut butter and flattening.  Seriously so good.  They are HUGE when you make them 1/4 cup servings as stated in the directions.  They are chewy and delicious.  The peanut butter flavor is very, very subtle so they taste more like regular chocolate chip cookies and SO GOOD!

These cookies were very good. I used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate. I rolled the dough into 1 inch balls. I discovered that they don't spread much, so I flattened them with the palm of my hand. I baked them for 9 minutes and they were perfect - soft and chewy, just the way I like. Thanks for the recipe.

I doubled the PB in this recipe and still didn't think there was much PB flavor or any flavor at all. I much prefer the Chocolate PB Cup Cookie or PB Cup Cookie from this site if your looking for Choc/PB combo. They did stay soft and chewy, they formed perfectly round cookies (after fridging/rolling dough) and did not flatten but we just didn't think they had much taste. Worth a shot.

Delicious!  I used 1 cup of peanut butter and used honey in place of the corn syrup because I didnt have any.  These turned out extremely rich... just like we like them!  Cooked for exactly 10 minutes and they were perfect!

Very yummy!   I substituted brown sugar Karo Syrup and used dark brown sugar because I think it gives the flavor a bit more depth.

I also added chopped pecans.   Great cookies!

Yes, these cookies are the best!  I made one change which was to use 1 cup peanut butter instead of 1/2.  The texture is like chewy chips ahoy cookies, and they are also better the next day.  Some experimenting led me to reduce them to half the stated size.  They do not spread, so flatten them unless you like a tall drop cookie.

I really enjoyed this recipe but I did some modification. I melted the butter, added 1 C. of peanut butter, in addition to the 2 eggs I added an extra yolk. Also I substituted 1 T. of honey for the corn syrup.

I found these in the tried and true cookie recipe book from this web site. I used the 1/4 cup size and they are chewy and delicious. I like the touch of flavor the corn syrup gives. Next time I'm adding chopped peanuts.

This one is a keeper. I made it the first time to give away and was anxious about changing anything. So I made it precisely as given.  The size portions (1/4 c.) surprised me as I normally use a small scoop tool (approx 1 heaping T.) for cookies.  I 'adjusted' by dropping two scoops per cookie. I underbaked the first pan as some reviewers cut down the time. Those were gooey and melty. At 12 minutes baking and a good 3 minutes cooling they were perfect; soft but complete. The only 'complaint' I heard was, "There's peanut butter in there? I don't taste any peanut butter." Overall, though, everybody wants 'em again.

Absolutely wonderful.  The peanut butter flavor was not overpowering.  If you are looking for peanut butter cookies this may not be for you.  As for the reviewer that said they became crumbly the next day.. they must have done something wrong or didn't store them properly.. mine were wonderfully moist several days later after storing in zip lock bags.  My husband said they were the best and softest, chewiest, yummiest cookies I have ever made.  We are making again.  Also.. I used Dark Brown Sugar instead of light.. not sure if that makes any difference or not.  Thanks for the great recipe!

these cookies were wonderful! I changed a few things - used molasses instead of corn syrup, substituted 1/2 cup rolled oats in place of 1/2 cup flour and omitted the water and they were one of the best cookies ever!

These were great for M&M cookies!  I used 1.5 cups of candy instead of the chopped chocolate.  Also, I used a cookie scoop and made 36 cookies which baked in the 375 degree oven for 9 minutes. Perfect!

I baked for EXACTLY 13 minutes, at 375 degrees, and the came out TOTALLY black and burnt.    Then, for my second batch, I tried 10 minutes at 350 degrees.  They turned out perfect.  :)  (oh yeah,  and the dough was AWESOME!!!!)

I tweaked this recipe a bit and the cookies still came out great! Very chewy on the inside. I used 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter' instead of real butter and plain yogurt in place of the corn syrup. I also left out the water. I didn't grease the cookie sheet and they still came right off. Will use this recipe again!

If you like your cookies to have a "cake-y" taste then these cookies are for you.  I was expecting more of a chewy cookie.

My husband loved these!  I used about a cup of peanut butter and an extra 1/3 cup of flour based on other reviews, and these were soft and slightly chewy cookies, with a tiny bit of crunch on the edges.  I baked them until they had brown edges, and now I have a new cookie in "the cookie rotation"  I also substituted milk chocolate chips since that was what I had in the kitchen.

I made these cookies yesterday and just could not believe my eyes, they were the most perfect cookie I have ever made! When my husband came home, he thought they were store bought! I did not change a thing, and they are so good and tasty and they did not come out flat, and like another reviewer said I made sure not to bake too long...perfect cookies..thank you for sharing this recipe!

Very simple and easy recipe! I find that chilling the dough before dropping them onto the cookie sheet does help them to bake more evenly. As well, in addition to the corn syrup, I also added some corn starch to the flour mix to give it that added extra chewiness!

I agree with other reviewers that it is not very peanut-buttery, even after adding almost a full cup of Peanut butter, but still one of the best recipes. Chewy and delicious. They also store nicely in an airtight container and still maintain their softness.

I found this recipe about 5 years ago on this website (during maternity leave--it was great to be breastfeeding and able to eat an unlimited amount of cookies!).  It is STILL my absolute favorite cookie recipe--soft, chewy, flavorful and almost always a perfect product.  

I recently modified this recipe to take out the chocolate chips, and replace the water and corn syrup with honey (plus an extra 2-3 T of honey).  This gave a marvelous, sweet and chewy PB/honey cookie--something my husband has wanted since we first got married!

Made a double batch of these cookies... couldn't even taste the peanut butter and they were a bit heavy. Also, more fluffy than chewy. Still taste good, but not fantastic.

These were just OK for me.  Not bad, but not great either.  Mine didn't really turn out very chewy and I think they needed more peanut butter flavor.  I would probably just rather add chips to my regular peanut butter cookies.

Made these for my husband to take to work, and they were a huge hit.  I am not a fan at all of peanut butter, but I do like these cookies!  I've made them twice already and will be taking them to a family function this weekend.  I push the center of the dough down a bit before putting them in the oven.  They come out perfectly shaped.

YUM. These are perfect if you squish down the dough to make 3" cookie shapes before cooking. Watch carefully and take out as SOON as the EDGES are browning-- about 9 minutes in my oven. They will turn out like bakery style!

These were wonderful cookies!  My mother-in-law, who is a domestic diva in her own right said they were the best peanut butter cookies she has ever had.   Chewy, light and fluffy, chocolatety, yummy goodness!  I used Natural Peanut butter in mine and it turned out great.  I also stored half the dough in the refrigerator for a week and those turned out good too, except the baking time had to be shortened a bit.  The dough  may look a bit thin, but if you have followed the recipe exactly, it should turn out fine.

These are pretty good... like some other people, I did lower the flour to 2 cups and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup, plus I used a whole bag of chocolate chips (a little over 2 cups).  I also didn't have any light corn syrup, so I used maple syrup, which I think turned out good.  These were good, but I'd have to agree with some others that I wish they'd tasted a bit more peanut butter-y.  I also would have liked them less fluffy and more chewy - maybe use even less flour next time.

These are really good! But, I will reduce the amount of chocolate chips next time because I really couldn't taste the peanut taste. They are really soft and chewy. Oh- I also dropped tablespoon amounts on the cookie sheets instead of 1/4 cup amounts and reduced the cooking time by about half. They were fine.

This cookies were wonderful!  My  husband loves peanut butter chocolate chip cookies, but I prefer the regular kind.  These cookies are the perfect compromise because the peanut butter isn't too strong.

These cookies were pretty good. The taste was awesome, but they didn't cook evenly very well. If you go with the recipe and cook them by 1/4 cupfulls, expect slightly burnt bottoms if you cook them all the way through. I tried several different sizes and I think that they come out best 1/8 cupfull. For some fun try filling mini- or regular muffin tins half full, (but remember to use paper cups or else they won't come out.)

These were the BEST cookies I have ever made.  I scales the resipe up to 48 and made big cookies, using an icecream scoop.  I let them cool off & made icecream sandwiches with these.  My guests LOVED them.  Also, I used the mini hershey kisses instead of chips- which really rocked.  This recipe is easy & wonderful.  Thanks for sharing it with us!!  My only regret- Not making MORE!!!!!!!!

These cookies were a HIT during the holidays!  My chocolate chip cookie loving friends thought they were a real treat.  Next time I'll add more peanut butter though....for more peanut butter flavor (just for me).  I always use real salted butter for all my cookies and have never had a flat one.

The best! I made them twice and the second batch was better because I added 1/4c more flour and about 1/4c more peanut butter. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.   THE BEST!!!

This is a decent recipe however the temperature of the baking will ruin your cookies.

Everyone knows cookies are baked at 350 degrees not 375.   To prove it I baked at 375 for 12 to 15 min at 12 min bottom was burnt slightly 15 min bottoms all burnt.

This is an easy fix however for those non bakers following the directions perfectly will ensure you get burnt bottoms.

Didn't change the recipe and these cookies turned out great! Chewy (just as they are described) yet a little crisp when you bite into them. I'm not a fan of peanut butter cookies, but these are GOOD. (WARNING: The cookie dough is so sinful, don't taste it because you'll eat half the batter.) Next time, I might add oatmeal and nuts to make them feel healthier and to add a bit more crunch. Toffee bits would be delightful!

I changed the recipe because 1/2 cup peanut butter did not seems like enough. So, I did double the peanut butter. Having done that, I had to increase the flour to 2-3/4 cups. Also needed increased salt to 3/4 tsp. Used  all brown sugar (1.5 cups) except added 1Tbsp white sugar - used 1 cup chocolate chips. Baked at 350 for 9 minutes and used 1 Tbsp dough per cookie. Pretty good then. Probably could have eliminated the water, too.

Great recipe! Followed the instructions and used what chips I had (mini chocolate chips) and turned out amazing. Saving this one for later for sure! Next time I might try to swap out the butter for even more peanutbutter!

Followed the directions listed except used honey instead of corn sryup and only cooked them for 8 minutes. These are great cookies but not chewy. They turned out more cake like but still delicious and moist. If you use a cookie scoop, I would suggest flattening them out as they do not spread on the pan.

For me the cookies were sugary sweet, though chewy as promised. I wanted them to be more peanut butter flavoured than sugary, so I would increase the peanut butter to a cup. I did cut down the chocolate chips and as per others I did about 1/8 cup for a good size cookie.

Soo good! I am glad i didnt listen to the negative reviews. DONT change a thing unless its just the chips. I did half reese chips and half semisweet. I use a 4 tbsp scoop to make big cookies. I bake my cookies at 325 on a light colored pan with parchment paper. These took 15 min. Right when i took them out i pressed the tops with a spatula (they rise a lot like a muffin almost). I let them sit on the pan for about 5 min before transfering to rack. They are best the next day in my opinion. I am more of a "chocolate chip cookie right out of the oven" person. These are good warm, but awesome maybe say 12 hours later. So 5 stars....dont change the flour, pb, honey, etc etc DONT do all that. And they ARE soft and chewy.

These came out great. There isn't a real strong peanut butter taste. I wanted to make chocolate chip cookies for the family but was low on butter. This recipe was great and they didn't last long. Made a double batch to hand out to family. Stayed nice and soft.

I was looking for a peanut butter cookie recipe to use up some peanut butter.  Also wanted to add chocolate chips.  Found this recipe and it was exactly what I was looking for.  Followed exactly except doubled it.  The cookies were great but the chocolate chips overpowered the peanut butter - not a problem, just wanted to use up some peanut butter.  As for the baking time, I cooked them at 375 per instructions.  I noticed in reviews a lot of comments on the time.  I guess I have just been cooking long enough to know that all ovens are not created equal.  I also baked two sheets at the same time.  Some of them took up to 14 minutes, and others only 10.  Not a problem, just rotated one sheet out and one sheet up with the newest cookie sheet going on the bottom shelf.  The cookies came out just perfect and nice and chewy.  Just as described.

Ok I just made these tonight. I used chocolate chips instead of chocolate chunks. I didn't measure the amount of chips I just eyeballed it. I also substituted thick sugar water for the corn syrup because I didn't have any. Other than that the only thing I changed was the cookie size and bake time. I used my Tablespoon measuring spoon and made rounded scoops. It made almost 3 dozen. It might have made the full three dozen but I have a cookie dough addiction. I also only baked them for 11 minutes. the 1st batch I did for 9 but I had to put them back in. even after they were still not quite right they wanted to fall apart. the other two I put in for 11 minutes and they were perfect.They were not dry at all and I did not reduce the flour a bit. I do recommenced chilling the dough after mixing for less messy scooping though. I also kept in the fridge while baking previous batches. The kids love them... thanks for posting. Oh yes someone mentioned the type of peanut butter might make a difference in how they turn out... I don't know if it does or not but I use Skippy natural creamy.

2 whole cups of chocolate chips is way too much. The dough wouldn't even hold together. One cup would've been enough. I also didn't put any corn syrup.

These are weird! It must be because I used natural peanut butter. That's my only guess. My husband has been looking forward to these all day and we both sat down to try them and neither one of us liked them. I suggest that if you make these to choose your peanut butter carefully! Good luck!

The flavor had just the tiniest hint of peanut butter, and the texture wasn't very appealing. I should have heeded the suggestions from other reviewers and reduced the flour and increased the peanut butter.

These cookies were okay, just okay. I think they could have used a bit more peanut butter/flavor. I used honey instead of corn starch as well. However, they were chewy as expected... but not quite the "peanut butter chocolate chip cookie" I expected.

Great cookies!  I added extra PB (about 1 cup total) and kept the flour at 2.5 cups.  They DID spread and they are chewy and gorgeous.  Thanks!

Among the best cookies I've ever made! My boyfriend would disagree and say they were in fact, the best I've made. 

I made a couple of changes, I only used half a cup of brown sugar, 1 Tblsp of corn syrup, doubled the peanut butter, 1 Tblsp of water. Instead of chocolate chips, I used left over Christmas chocolate, so Lindor Truffles and the white/milk chocolate Toblerone bar, another reason these cookies were so decadent.

These are really good. I followed the recipe exactly and they are delish. Everyone likes them. As written the peanut butter flavor is subtle & there are lots of chocolate chips.  Next time I will reduce the amount of chocolate chips as it is a bit sweet for my taste and maybe add some peanut butter chips.

These were very good. Mine turned out more cakey than chewy, but they were dense. I used natural unsweetened PB and Nestle's chocolate-PB chips. Will definitely make these again!

YUM!!! Stay moist next day (didn't last longer; make 1 sheet at a time..).  Even used some white wheat flour which I think adds to the flavor.

A good cookie, but lacking a peanut flavor. This recipie tasted like an average chocolate chip cookie with a hint of peanut added too it. This cookie didn't turn out to be exceptionally chewy either.

These are outta hand. So delightfully delicious. Sad thing is I may never have em the same again because I threw in quite a variety when cleaning out my baking cabinet. So, made these per recipe with the following changes - used all brown sugar just to finish off a bag.. no other reason. Added a little extra peanut butter per reviews, threw in what was left of milk choco chips and mini semi sweet chips plus I had some mini reeses peices that I'd found at a local candy shop - I accidently poured too many of those in, so the cookies are quite full of goodies! Did fridge the dough so it was cold and firmer when I worked with it. Baked about 12-14 mins on 350. They are chewy as promised!

I changed it up a bit after reading other's reviews! I put 1 cup peanut butter (perfect amount, you taste the peanut butter but its not over powering) I cut out the white sugar and put 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar. I did not have corn syrup so I used vermont country syrup. Last but not least I only used 1 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips. 

Baked at 350 for 8 to 9 minutes! Rounded tablespoon sized! They were delicious! They were moist and chewy! Will make again!

Personally, I LOVED this recipe! They turned out soft, chewy, and simply irresistible! I am a peanut butter/chocolate freak, so i will most definitely be using this recipe again! And just a quick note for those of you who said that the bottoms turned black but the middle wasn't cooked--that has absolutely NOTHING to do with the recipe, its just your oven!

THIS IS A STAPLE  IN MY HOUSE A MUST HAVE CONSTANTLY IN THE COOKIE JAR, I DO DOUBLE THE RECIEPE AND USE 2 cups chocolate morsels and 2cups chopped Walnuts. Always wanted. SCRUMPTIOUS!  I increased the size by USEING soup spoonfuls which makes a meal out of each cookie and substituted Splenda for the white sugar, WONDERFUL!

This cookies taste amazing and are just the right amount of chewiness.  However, they don't taste at all like they have peanut butter in them, which was disappointing.  Next time I will try doubling the peanut butter.

Made these today for my husband and they are really good. Maybe needs a bit more peanut butter taste to them, but I like my peanut butter cookies to have a strong peanut butter taste. Other than that, they're really good!!

I made this recipe last night and my husband just phoned me from his job to tell me they are the best cookies he's ever eaten! I increased peanut butter to 3/4 cup, brown sugar to 1 1/4 cups and reduced white sugar to 1/4 cup.  Also, substituted maple syrup for corn syrup.  Thanks so much Kathy!

Used this recipe a few times now and it's a hit. The only change I made is I used pure maple syrup instead of light corn syrup (that's all I had). They always turn out gerat. As usual, the type of baking sheet/tray you use affects the baking time needed. Just make sure to start checking them starting 12 mins, and don't take them out until you actually see them browning at the edges. Really wonderful recipe. My boyfriend always asks for these specific cookies, so I'm really happy that I found this recipe!

I made these for Easter and they were eaten up quickly however I have to say that these cookies did not taste like peanut butter at all.  They tasted just like regular chocolate chip cookies.  I even followed the reviews and added 1 cup of Jif peanut butter and used only brown sugar.  I was really disappointed in this recipe.

So good! They don't need to bake for too long. Mine were done in 9-10 minutes. I added half chocolate & half peanut butter chips and topped with mini-Reeses chips. Now they're my husband's favorite cookie.

It's okay. It has PLENTY of chocolate chips. I'd reduce those. Strangely, even after adding in more peanut butter, I found that this recipe didn't seem to have enough of a peanut butter flavor to it. That may be due to the large number of chocolate chips.

These are nom nom tasty! I made a couple changes: 1 1/2 c whole wheat flour and 1 c all-purpose flour... agave instead of corn syrup since it's what I have... likewise with chocolate chips instead of chopped semisweet chocolate. To make them more peanut buttery I quartered 12 mini peanut butter cups (the Costco ones) as a substitute for one of the cups of chocolate chips. Baked for 10 minutes. Yum yum!

More like 4.5...I was generous with the peanut butter, but otherwise followed this recipe to a T. I'd say baking 12 min would have been just perfect as I baked for 13 min and they were a bit too done for my taste. For pillowy, pea-nutty deliciousness, this is the recipe.

Kind of disappointing. If by "chewy" they really meant to say a bit flavorless and "cakey" then I would have agreed. Yet it is possible that my dissatisfaction was not the result of a bad recipe as it can be easy to accidentally add to much flour when adjusting the recipe for the required ingredients available to you. But if you are going to go ahead and make them, be sure to lower the cooking time by a few minutes as mine did burn on the bottom on the lowest time suggested.

These were a little too sweet for us but delicious and peanut butter chewy good!  I would cut the sugar and corn syrup in half and add more peanut butter.  I would also reduce the size and bake for shorter time.

These cookies came out perfectly! They were delicious, gone as soon as they were cool enough to eat! The peanut butter is almost not detectable in the finished cookie, but gives the typical chocolate chip cookie some pizazz!

I was SO looking forward to these cookies!  ALL of my favorites, chewy, chocolate, peanut buttery...    And they were awful.  A waste of ingredients.  Thoroughly disappointed.  :(    

I followed the directions as written.  The peanut butter isn't noticeable at all.  They are NOT chewy. AT ALL.   Even with 2 tsp of vanilla, theses cookies tasted like flour and sugar.  blech.  

The cookies were tossed in the garbage.  

I WILL NOT use this recipe again.

Dangerously delicious.  I did not have any light corn syrup on hand so I used honey, which was suggested by a reviewer.

Too sweet. The chewy is from the corn syrup, I guess. Taste like state processed cookies from a supermarket. No peanut butter taste at all. Very disappointing.

these cookies are super yummy...they are perfectly crisp on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside...The only thing I will do different next time is to add a little more peanut butter, to my taste.  Otherwise, this is perfect as written.

These are absolutely the best cookies I have ever made and I have been an avid baker from the age of 10! 
I followed the directions from the other reviews and cooked them by spoonfuls for 9 minutes and they came out chewy and magnificently delectable.
I will definitely be making these again!

these are super yummy! i baked according to the recipe and they turned out very good. however if you are looking for more of a peanut butter flavor then you might want to add more to the recipe. but other than that..they are superb and easy to make.

Nice and chewy. Not very peanut buttery. More like a hybrid between a chocolate chip cookie and a peanut butter cookie than a full peanut butter cookie. 
Modifications: 
I only had one egg, so I used a little apple sauce. 
They were a little sticky and runny, so I chilled the dough first.
 I undercooked some of them at 10 and 11 minutes. My man liked those better. 
Will definitely make again. Yum.

These are pretty good, but definitely remind me more of a chocolate chip cookie rather than a peanut butter cookie. I would probably add a quarter of a cup more peanut butter the next time around.

I couldn't wait to make these after reading all the good reviews, but was very disappointed.  They were very ordinary, a lttle too sweet, and with very little peanut butter flavor. However, as others stated, 9-10 are all that is needed in the oven, and they should be cooled on a rack. They made about 40 cookies.

I rarely write reviews but I absolutely LOVED these cookies.  The only thing I changed was I put 1 cup mini chocolate chips and 1 cup peanut butter chips in them. I baked them for about 10 minutes and they came out so soft, chewy, and delicious and the best part is they stayed that way.  My family kept coming back for more up to an hour later and they were still soft and chewy.  Even the dough was yummy....absolutely a keeper!!

These cookies were definitely chewy and moist. However, they were lacking that true peanut butter taste that I was looking for. I  might try to double the peanut butter and see what happens.

These were a HUGE hit with my three kids (and one kid visitor), especially the 7-year-old who has told me at least three times that these are the best cookies he's ever had in his entire life. I kept the recipe exactly as stated except cut back the sugar to 1 cup (of demerara sugar; I don't keep white or brown sugar on hand) and cut the chocolate chips to 1 cup. I weighed the balls of dough, using about 50 grams per cookie and they baked perfectly in 11 minutes. They taste great and look awesome, just the way a "perfect cookie" should look. I will be making these again and again!

Soft and chewy and wonderful!  My only complaint is that they were not peanut-buttery enough for my taste.  Next time I think I will double the PB.  Otherwise perfect!

OMG! Yum. Followed advice to use 1 c. peanut butter. Added 1/2 t. baking powder (so afraid of flat cookies!). After two sheets of cookies, my bowl of dough fell into my dishwater! Guess who's making another batch tomorrow?! Got scared when I read the few negative comments, but the recipe is MAGNIFICENT!

Excellent, super-chewy peanut butter cookie.  I did double the amount of peanut butter because they're never "peanut buttery" enough for me with just half a cup.  They baked up huge, chewy, and perfect in exactly 14 minutes.  To the reviewer below who said "keep it real people," you obviously did something wrong.

Well, Im not a good chocolate chip cookie maker but this turned out pretty good.  All my cookie recipes I've made usually flatten thin with lumps of chocolate.  This did not.  They are chewy like promised but dont taste too much like peanut butter.  I did like them very much and will keep this recipe. Update:  its been 3 days since I made these cookies and they are still just as good as when I baked them.  STILL CHEWY!!! I think this is my new favorite cookie recipe.

Perfect cookies!  Excellent recipe. We like smaller cookies, so scooped out 1" balls of dough. Baked for about 10 minutes instead.  Made about 4 dozen, with dough sampling included!

As my husband puts it, these are "masterful."  I used 1 cup peanut butter, 1 cup mini chocolate morsels, and 1/2 cup peanut butter morsels.  I used my cookie scoop as well, but cooked them the full 13 minutes. These are very delcious, moist, and chewy.

These are sooo delicious! I have made them twice now and they disappear so fast. Based on other reviews I made the following changes: I used 1 cup of peanut butter, honey instead of corn syrup, 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips (the first time I used the full 2 cups, but it was just too much, there were extra choc. chips at the bottom of the bowl that wouldn't mix w/ the dough). I baked at 350 for about 14 mins. They are great the next day - they stay perfectly soft if you put them in an air tight container. I had several people beg me for the recipe :p

First off I didn't have any corn syrup so I thought why not use light molasses but dared to only put in one teaspoon. Dropped small amounts of dough on cookie sheet and baked for nine minutes and let cool for one minute before removing. The texture was so light and fluffy, definitely not for the crisp cookie folks. My cookies looked like the picture - I flattened the dough slightly before baking. And, I had left my butter out to soften and it was near a heat vent, still in its bar form but so melty when I prepped the cookies. Can't understand why some had trouble with their dough, I'm usually the one with flat cookies. Nice p.b. flavor, not overpowering, I might add chopped peanuts or brickle bits next time for added texture. Yum! Update: not as happy with this cookie the following day, seemed dry and tasteless as opposed to how good it was fresh from the oven. Agree with others now, that more peanut butter may be the answer.

Love that you don't have to refrigerate the dough -my kids don't have patience for that step. These came out really good even though I goofed and forgot to add water, vanilla and corn syrup before I added the flour. Still worked ok adding it later. I did find that some of the choc chips seemed to "fall out" of the batter but I just pushed them in when I put them on the sheet. I also made mine smaller and reduced baking time. My kids loved making and eating these!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Pretty rockin recipe, let's start with my changes.  I just used half a container of PB (I hate measuring things), definitely use honey instead of corn syrup (yum!), I like to cut the APF with some whole wheat flour to put some (ok, very little) nutrition into the recipe and it helps let the cookies spread out a bit more when being cooked.  I used a cookie ice cream scoop thing to make them all equal sized balls.  I used "White Chocolate Wonderful" Peanut Butter (it's ridonkulously delish) and ommitted the chocolate in lieu of a single white chocolate chip on the top of each ball.  10min, center of over, @ 375, they were perfect.  True story, before I even got out of the kitchen, I already had 3 engagement requests.  Ladies love em.

These are great,I substituted by adding a cup of peanut butter instead of half. I also changed it from corn syrup to honey,which tastes wonderful! Also changed bitter-sweet chocolate to milk chocolate chips. Beside that,they came out wonderful!

These were really good but I was hoping for more of a peanut butter flavor. I followed the recipe exactly with no substitutions. I will definitely keep the recipe but see how I can get the peanut butter flavor to come out more in it. Also, the next day, they really aren't chewy, which I was hoping for a more soft-baked cookie...

I was very disappointed in these cookies. Just as the previous write said they didn't have much of a peanut butter flavor. They were soft, but not pleasingly so and they weren't very sweet. I won't make this recipe again.

I just made these and they are very soft. But they were not very peanutbuttery for peanut butter cookies, and my first batch burnt. My suggestion: 1 cup of peanutbutter and about 7-8 minutes in the oven.

This recipe was a HUGE hit!  I made them for a party and everyone loved them.  The only change I will make next time is few less chocolate chips.  The chocolate kind of drowned out the taste of the peaunut butter.  Otherwise an awesome recipe!!  I will definitely keep this one on hand.

Added an extra half cup of peanut butter for added peanut butter flavor and partially melted butter and peanut butter.  Melted butter tends to always allow for chewy cookies by the way!  Great recipe!  Will add to my extended list of holiday baking.  Thanks!

These were really good! The only change I made was using chocolate chips instead of chopped chocolate and they turned out perfectly with 12 minutes of baking time in a 375F oven. Will definitely be making these again!

This recipe is great! I have made them twice now and the cookies come out so soft and chewy. I had no corn syrup so i substituted that with a bit of regular syrup, worked just as good. Thanks!

These are fantastic. Yes, the recipe is more chocolatey than peanut buttery, but it is still one of the best cookie recipes I've tried. I've been using this recipe for a while now and everyone loves them. I divide the cookies into 1/4 cups and cook them for exactly 12 minutes. They won't look done, but take them out anyway. They will be so soft and gooey for days. This recipe makes 28 big cookies for me.

Not sure if the people who reviewed these cookies as "not good" or "doesn't taste like peanut butter" made them properly, but these are one of the best cookies I have ever made. Super thick and chewy and taste like bakery made. I do a lot of baking and LOVE this recipe!!!! Would recommend to anyone :)

overall easy to make--not very peanut buttery-If I make them again I would cut back on the chocolate-I can't believe I just said that- taste like basic chocolate chip cookie--still tastey just not a great peanut butter taste.

These were good, but unfortunatly not peanut buttery enough.  The taste was more like chocolate chip with a slight hint of peanut butter.  The texture and chewiness was excellent.  If I try it again, I will add more peanut butter, probably a full cup and not add the 2 Tb. water.

Addictive, I agree.  Try leaving out the corn syrup for a crunchy cookie (I forgot it the first attempt), and add 2c oatmeal - and more peanut butter doesn't hurt anyone!  Everyone loved them either crunchy and chewy!  I've been asked to make more several times already!

These turned out really well.  I only used 1 egg, and added 1 extra tablespoon of water.  Worked just fine.  I also used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips and there were delish!  Try this recipe if you're looking for a solid peanut butter cookie recipe to add to your repertoire.

It's not usually a good thing when you misplace one of your favourite cook books, but in this case it turned out rather well. Since I couldn't find the cook book I needed, I just searched the website and came across this recipe. The cookies were really easy to make and turned out beautifully. They are pretty big cookies, but they're fluffy and moist and chewy, and you just want to keep eating them. You should have seen my husband's face when he walked in the door. They were a huge hit, and I'll be making them for years to come. I'm so glad I couldn't find my cook book!

I made this and I doubled them, cookies do not last long around here. So I used honey in place of the corn syrup. I used half whole wheat flour and half regular flour. I think chilling dough is a better looking cookie. I froze half of the dough. So I baked some really cold dough and they were beautiful cookies. I will make again!!

I like these cookies, and they lend themselves well to baking in a jelly roll pan (sprayed very lightly w/Pam)  when time is at a premium.   Baking as a bar cookie required approx 25 mins in my oven.

Fantastic cookies! I too used less flour, added extra peanut butter and used peanut chips instead of chocolate. I also baked for 9.5 minutes and the texture/color came out SO PERFECT! My boyfriend ate 5 in the first 5 minutes! This one's a keeper!

The only thing we changed in the recipe was that I used mini chocolate chips as that is what I had on hand. Both my kids and I liked these, they are not a really strong peanut butter flavor, for me it was just enough, but I can see why others think it isn't enough peanut butter flavor.

These were really good, I don't know why people would give them below 4 stars. I used 3/4 cup of peanut butter, semi-sweet and milk chocolate chunks, and 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead of white. My favourite thing about these cookies is how well they held there shape, no flat little discs here! They also tasted amazing, just the right amount of PB flavour.

I just made these and they are DELISH. I did make a few changes, however. As previously recommended, I reduced the flour to 2 cups and increased the peanut butter to almost a cup. I used dark brown sugar because that's all that I had, and 1 T honey instead of corn syrup (I also didn't have corn syrup). I burnt the bottom of my first batch (very wet dough) so I doubled up on my cookie sheets and the other batches were much better. I also decreased the cook time to only 9 minutes. Despite the MANY changes I made, I think these cookies would be good the original way, or with necessary/desired changes!

This recipes is a keeper in my kitchen! Have made quite a few times and love how they stayed soft and chewy. I did up the amount of peanut butter to 1 full cup and the flour to 2 1/2 cups for more flavor. Also I found that using all or half crunchy peanut butter gave more peanut flavor too because of the little pieces. They didn't spread out quite like some people said, but they stayed soft anyways so that doesn't matter to me.

Yummy and chewy.  We added 1 more cup of peanut butter but did not decrease the flour.  It had a good peanut butter choco-chip flavor.

I followed some suggestions from other reviewers and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup and reduced the flour also (I used 1-3/4 cups). They were good cookies and turned out soft. They still weren't quite as peanut buttery as I would have liked. I also added dark chocolate M&M's to the top in place of the chocolate inside the dough.  When this said "chewy" I think I expected crisp outer edges and soft chewy insides and mine didn't turn out quite like that. It could have to do with altering the flour I suppose. They were good cookies but not my favorite.

Very disappointing.  Not peanutbuttery enough, strange consistancy and way too large for normal human consumption.

I have one thing to say about this cookie recipe, it is pure perfection! Chewy with a good balance of peanut butter and then the chocolate flavor hits your taste buds.  They're wonderful don't change a thing. Thank you Kathy!

I was very disappointed in th PB flavor, there really wasnt much. I had people ask me which were the PB and which were plain Choc. Chip because they could'nt taste the difference! I believe in rating a recipe as written not how I "fixed/doctored" it.

I used about 3/4 cup peanut butter, only 1-3/4 cups flour (1 cup all-purpose, 3/4 whole wheat), and only about 1 cup choc chips b/c that's all I had left.  Dropped heaping tablespoons onto my sheet, cooked for 10 mins, and got 18 super big thick, chewy cookies.  I can't imagine using more flour or more choc chips or less PB b/c they were amazing w/these adjustments!

The flavor of this cookie is good.  I used 1 full cup of peanut butter instead of 1/2 cup.  I think  with 1/2 cup  there wouldn't be enough peanut butter flavor.  My cookies were chewy when they came out of the oven, but the next day they were not.  I was hoping for  them to stay chewy.

I really liked this cookie.  My husband...not so much.  I followed others' advice and cut the flour back to 2 cups and used 1 cup of peanut butter.  I also made much smaller cookies.  I just dropped them on the cookie sheet with a tablespoon and got 5 dozen normal size cookies.  Overall, I thought the cookie was great and I will bake them again.  So what if my husband doesn't like them....more for me!

I usually follow the direct recipe written by the submitter to appreciate their style of baking/cooking... these cookies were fantastic. I personally wouldn't say they're addictive, but very very good! I can't help but think of how much calories must be in these cookies because they're made so much like the ones that sell at the store and I've never added corn syrup to any chocolate chip cookies I've made before, but it's probably required for cookies with peanut butter in it I'm guessing... Overall, these cookies are fantastic in taste and texture. I couldn't believe how soft they turned out even after a day passed and they were all cooled off. My sister really enjoys them and I plan to make more in the future! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

I like the concept of this recipe, but I, like the other baker, added 1 cup more of peanut butter and cut down significantly on the flour. I have not tried this recipe as it is written so I can't give it a bad review but as a base recipe, it served me well. The cookies were a huge hit.

I have to agree with one reviewer.  I wouldn't rate this a 3 out of 5.  Very little peanut butter taste and tends to be a bitter cookie.  I do like the consistency of the cookie though.  Will have to play with the recipe

These cookies are amazing!   They're soft and chewy with the perfect balance of peanut butter and chocolate.   Just FYI, I put my dough in the fridge overnight, and I dropped the dough in teaspoonfuls (1/4 cupfuls seemed kind of huge) and I rolled them into balls. I knew they'd probably spread out quite a bit, so I didn't scrunch the dough balls. The end result was probably one of the best batches of cookies I've ever made. I'll definitely be making these again.

My family LOVES these cookies - the only thing I do differently is add a cup of peanut butter - I don't measure it, I just guess by the look of the spoonful!  These cookies are soft, but not crumbly and they stay soft for days.  The only reason I know this is because I triple the recipe for camping trips so that they last more than a day or two - I keep them in a tightly seal Rubbermaid container!  And our camping buddies love them too - I have been asked for the recipe more times than I can count.  Everyone who tries them says 'hey, these cookies have PB in them' because there is a very definite PB taste.  I always use a name brand peanut butter, not sure if that makes a difference?

I've used this recipe for almost five years and it's fantastic!  I'm not sure what brand peanut butter people are using, but I use only JIF or Skippy.  My Grammy taught me always to use the very best peanut butter when baking, and I think it truly does make a difference.  Usually I have trouble getting good results with cookies because I'm not great at baking, but I have no trouble with these.  I've had many requests for the recipe, so I pass on the web site to friends and relatives.

So so... they were a little too cakey, not enough peanut butter, and way too much vanilla (even with only 1 tsp). I was looking for something more like a chewy chocolate chip cookie.

These cookies were awesome... I made no alterations to the recipe, with the exception of the cookie size.  I dropped the dough about 2 tbsp size and baked for 10 mins. They came out super-yummy!  The peanut butter flavor was present but not overwhelming.  AND I love my cookies moist and chewy, and these were both!

These are some good soft/chewy cookies! Not blow-you-away peanut butter but enough to taste. Mine were not bitter or blah. (Bitter? Did you use soda, not powder, the correct amount, and mix well enough??) My family of seven loved them, so I will make these again.

If these had seemed like they had peanut butter in them, they might have been better liked. The person I made them for said they were an allright cookie but not much pb flavour. I was equally unimpressed.  They aren't *bad* they're just not very good.  That being said, I put most of the batch in the kitchen at my office and the staff gobbled them all gone in no time. I guess they must appeal to some folks!

This is a good cookie. I liked the texture, mine turned out chewy in the center, crisp on the edges. I did not use the corn syrup. My oven liked baking them for 13 minutes. May make them again.

This has become one of my standby, make a quadruple batch of cookies. I usually go heavier on the peanut butter though. Sometimes I leave out the chocolate chips altogether and place 1/2 a peanut in center of each cookie for plain peanut butter cookie, or, leave out chips and add cocoa to the dry ingredients. (they become penguin or reindeer poops at Christmas time.)Who doesn't love chocolate and peanut butter. Just don't flatten them. If you happen to have a 1 inch cookie scoop use it, such a time saver.

These cookies where hard as rocks the next morning. Nothing chewy about them and I cooked them for 12 min just like the recipe said. I doubled the peanut butter and still pretty bland tasting. I will continue my search for a really good peanut butter chocolate chip cookie. These just weren't it.

Very YUMMY!! I did like some others said and doubled the peanut butter to 1 cup. I also used honey instead of corn syrup. Only other thing I would do different next time is cut amount of chips to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2. My family LOVED this recipe!! It's definitely a keeper!

very good cookies. yes they spread a lot for me! and they cook really quickly.

i cut a little sugar and added a little more peanut butter (reduced fat kind) and it came out great. you can savor all the chocolate and pb without them being too sweet...!

I found not only do these cookies not have enough peanut butter, but they really were not that chewy.  I even put about 1/3 cup extra peanut better in because of all the reviews on here.  I baked the 1st dozen for 12 min. and the bottoms were almost burnt.  So I only baked the rest for about 10 min. and still not much better.  Only 1 of my 3 children liked them.  I will not make these again.

These were not that great.  They were chewy, but didn't really taste much like peanut butter.  I don't plan to make these again.

I run a small daycare, and my kids loved these cookies!  They are very soft and chewy, so even the smaller kids with fewer teeth could enjoy them.  I happen to like the lighter peanut butter flavor in this recipe.

I recently made this for our annual block party and they were a hit!  These cookies were huge-I used a 1/4 cup ice cream scoop to ensure they were all sized evenly.

Very, very good - a keeper as my daughter puts it. After reading the reviews I also cut back the flour to 1 1/4 cups, increased the peanut butter to 1 cup and used 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips. As the cookies barely spread at all, used heaping tablespoons full and slightly flattened them with the spoon and baked for 11 minutes on the centre rack of the oven.

The recipe is good but next time I'm going to try a lower temperature or less time in the oven. These bake nicely but tend to overbake quickly... which gives you less of a chewy cookie & more of a crunchy cookie. Good flavor though - will try again!

These are ok, they need more peanut butter. My daughter thought they were regular chocolate chip cookies. Might try them again, but with MORE peanut butter.

These are addictive, chewy cookies! My family loves them. The only thing I did differently the second time I made them was increase the amount of peanut butter to about 3/4 cup as my husband and I found the taste of peanut butter was a little too light for our liking. Other than that, great recipe. Thanks!

This was good and pretty easy. I read the comments about not tasting much peanut butter so i added more as well, wish i added even more! it was good, i also used a little less chocolate chips, but it was real fun! i made them big and thick and added vanilla ice cream on top while they were warm. so yummy!

These cookies are wonderful.  The only things I changed was adding 1/4 cup more peanut butter and I used 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening instead of butter.

I love all kinds of cookies. I am not a picky eater or food snob . However, these cookies were not good! The flavor didn't resemble peanut butter at all. Perhaps a little less flour would have helped or even a totally different recipe.

OMG!!! I just baked these..it's heavenly! I can't believe it turned out great i followed the recipe exactly except i didn't use peanut butter (i didn't have any at the time) and substitute 1/2 cup white sugar with brown sugar. I prefer the depth of brown sugar. I love chewy cookies and this babies deliver that. I'm definitely going to make these again and again. Thank you for this lovely recipe. :-)

These cookies are awesome!  SOOOOO chewy.  They lasted 5 days in a tupperware container and are still soft and chewy.  I took some of the other advice and cut down the chocolate chips and used 1 cup of peanut butter.  I also only baked for 10 minutes.  These are delicious.  I will definitely be making these a lot!

All I can say is . . . WOW!!!  These were the most amazing cookies I have made in a long time.  Followed directions thoroughly and cookies ended up nice and moist, even after sitting out for an hour or so.  Not quite enough peanut butter taste for my liking though, so the only thing I'd change next time would be 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 c. peanut butter chips.  Otherwise, a winning recipe . . . =)

These cookies turned out great! I have to say that the peanut butter taste wasn't too apparent in the cookie, it was just barely there, but they still tasted great. They were nice and chewy, even days after they were made. I reduced the size of the cookies and used a cookie dough scoop instead, I think they would have been way too big otherwise. I will use this recipe again when I need a simple and easy chocolate chip cookie!

Yummy yummy cookies!!! The only change I made to the recipe was to use 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of 2 cups of chocolate chunks.  That worked well for me.  I also noticed that the peanut butter flavor was very mild, but didn't really mind because the cookies were so soft and chewy.  Next time I might try adding a little extra peanut butter.  I will be making this recipe again soon!  Thanks!

Made these cookies last night...WHOA!!!
Amazingly soft and chewy...5 stars!
BRAVO Kathy! 
I am curious, have we stumbled upon a 'southern secret' using corn syrup in the recipe instead of shortening?
These cookies are going to the county fair!!!

Hands down one of the best cookie recipes I've tried on here!!  I cut the baking time down to 9 min. and used about 1 1/4 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead.  Perfection outta the oven!!

These are very delicious, and chewy. The only thing that I would change next time, and there will be a next time, is I found that the 2 teaspoons of vanilla seemed to be too much. It took away from the peanutty taste. Maybe I would do 1 teaspoon instead. I would maybe add pb chip, too. But thats only because I LOVE PBUTTER and chocolate together! But trust me, it wouldn't be too much Peanut Butter taste.

Nice change from a regular Chocolate chip cookies. Made as written and really liked them. Gives a mild peanut butter taste, not too sweet. Used a small ice cream scoop, cooked for 11 minutes till golden, yielded about 36-40 cookies,  not sure because my son kept taking one from each batch while still warm before I could move them to the cooling rack. Will make again.

These were excellent!  I added one cup of peanut butter instead of half a cup.  They are so awesome!!!!!  Try this and you won't be disappointed.

I agree with everyone else, these cookies were so delicious and chewy.  I made a few tweeks as suggested.
-I added 1 cup of peanut butter
-2 cups of flour
-added 1 teaspoon of baking powder
-I did not have corn syrup on hand so I used Honey as suggested and they turned out soooo yummy!
Thank you for the great recipe.

A great recipe.  I've been making them for about two years now and they are my husband's favorite (preferred above even the Toll House cookie recipe!).

Everyone love's these cookies. I add just a little bit more peanut butter, maybe a tablespoon or so, and take them out when they are just a tiny bit raw in the middle.

i made these last night with a few modifications.  i used 1 cup of peanut butter, a mixture of chocolate and peanut butter chips, and baked the cookies for 12 minutes, unlike the 9 that some people suggested.  they were so good and chewy yesterday, my boyfriend and i ate 6 of them with milk.  they weren't so chewy this morning but still yummy!  this one is going in the cookbook!

As I always do when making cookies, I subbed King Arthur organic Whole wheat white flour for the all-purpose flour, and this is the first time that I think it made a difference in the cookie.  My cookies came out cakey and dry.  They also did not have much of a peanut butter flavor. I should have read more reviews and added additional peanut butter.

We really enjoyed the chewiness of these. I made some without chocolate chips for my husband who really prefers peanut butter cookies without chocolate and I actually liked those better! But the chocolate chip ones were very good. I added about 1/2 teaspoon baking powder to give mine some "puff", but I think I'll leave it out next time. I also used honey in place of the corn syrup. Great recipe!

These cookies were good, but not as chewy as I was hoping they'd be.  As other reviewers suggested, I added a cup of peanut butter; they came out nice and peanutty.  I also baked the cookies for 9-10 minutes at 350.  I put chocolate chips in half of the batter, and left them out for the other half.  Tasted good both ways.

These are my new mainstay!  I halved the recipe and used what I had on hand: egg substitute and margarine as well as all white sugar (only because I was out of brown).  The finishing touch was to use special swirled white and black chocolate chips which really look neat.  The cookie doesn't spread much, which I happen to like, but stays soft and chewy with a little crispness at the edge. YUM!

These were not good at all. They came out more cakelike and not sweet at all. I agree to cut down on the flour by one cup and add more PB. At least a cup more. I will not make these again!

I made these without the chocolate chips. They have the firm but chewy texture I was looking for. I used chunky peanut butter but the next time I will use a bit more maybe 3/4 cup and add a few chopped peanuts....just for more peanut flavor. I recommend cooking it less at a lower temp. I did 325 deg. for 11 minutes. We all love them.  Can someone tell me if shortening can be substituted for my lactose intollerant son?

These cookies came out perfectly!  I couldn't have asked for a better chocolate chip cookie.  The peanut butter is subtle but adds a ton.  Especially good right out of the oven, they disappeared quickly!

I lessened the sugars by half and it still turned out delicious.   I also substituted the chunks of chocolate with chocolate chip morsels and the chocolatey taste was retained.

Good chocolate chip cookie, but I was looking for something with more of a peanut butter taste. I made mine using the small Pampered Chef scoop, baked for 14 minutes on my large stoneware pan. I got about 5 1/2 dozen cookies. Next time I will decrease butter to 1/4 cup & increase peanut butter to 3/4 cup & add chopped peanuts.

Easy to make and delicious.  Great texture.  Chewy but substantial. The only thing I might change is adding more peanut butter.   We have reduced fat Jif and 1/2 c didn't taste very peanut buttery. My husband said to keep this recipe.

I have to say, these cookies weren't really that good. They were chewy, yes, but the slight hint of peanut butter flavor was not impressive at all. They seemed lacking overall. I will not make these ever again.

Like other reviewers, I felt these weren't very peanut-buttery. I used extra-crunchy peanut butter, which added to the texture and made them better. I also baked them for slightly less than the time in the recipe. They were good, but I probably won't make these again.

These turned out great! (I made them last night and there are only a couple left thismorning *LoL*) I made a couple changes. I didn't actually measure the peanut butter, just spooned is as much as I wanted. I think I used more then called for (1/2 cup just didn't seem like alot) I then used 2 cups whole wheat flour, and only 1/2 white. I was lucky enough to have duck eggs that my boss gave me, so I used thoes. I was very careful not to overcook them, and the result was nice and soft, very chewy. Great recipe! :)

LOVE these cookies!  I modified them just a bit though by using 1 cup peanut butter and only 2 cups flour.  I never have to bake them longer than 10 min either.  I also made them with peanut butter chips and they were super peanut buttery and a hit with all my friends. My new favorite cookies!

These are the best cookies! Every time I make these I make a double batch because they are so good.  My boyfriend takes them to work and they're always a hit.  They turn out perfect if you follow the instructions just as they are.  Sometimes I replace the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips.

This recipe turned out very well; the cookies were firm and chewy with a very nice flavor.  Days later they still had an excellent texture (hadn't became stale and hard).  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I only baked each batch for eleven minutes, which probably helped them stay so soft.  If I make these again I will add more peanut butter, because these didn't have quite enough peanut butter flavor for my tastes!

These cookies were pretty good. I've made tons of cookies in the past, but not many peanut butter chocolate chip. I guess I expected them to be really rich and sinful tasting, but I was somewhat disappointed. The peanut butter wasn't a very strong taste, and I thought they were a little too dry. Like other people said, adding more peanut butter and less flour might help. Good tasting cookie, but I think I'll keep looking.

The corn syrup in these cookies gives them a weird texture...almost too chewy.  I don't think I will make them again.

Made the cookies with 1 cup peanut butter, 1 and half cup flour as suggested by other reviewers. Made smaller drops and baked for 12 minutes at 350 degrees. The cookies turned out chewy and delicious.

Simple to make and the cookies didn't turn out as chewy as I had hoped. However, they are snappy and chocolatey and delicious. Unfortunately, they're not peanut buttery enough!

These are delicious. Soft. Chewy. and not too sweet. They do not "expand" as much as normal cookies when baked. I made these for friends and they are a huge hit. I don't think the corn syrup is really necessary - corn syrup is way too sugary and not very good for that reason, so I cut that out. I really like how this recipe uses more brown sugar.

I've made these three or four times now, and they've turned out perfect every time.  They are one of the best cookies I've tried and my family loves them.  Follow the suggestions of 2 cups flour and 1 cup peanut butter and they come out perfect.

Hmmm.  Interesting, but not in a good way.  Not very tasty, strange texture.  Since I am a professional chef, i know it was nothing that i did wrong; the recipie itself was flawed.

My boyfriend has asked me to make these                                        2 times this week! He loves that they are a light PB taste, not too strong. they are really chewy and moist, a new favorite in our house!

I generally do not like peanut butter cookies, but these are FANTASTIC!  So chewy, I think that's what I like most about them.  I don't like cruncy cookies.  I used smooth peanut butter and didn't use chocolate chips (as I didn't have any) but I LOVE them and so do my family.  Definitely a do again and will have to try it with the chocolate (or pb) chips next time!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  Great recipe!  I baked the cookies on my stone cookie sheets (pre-heat them so the cookies cook evenly top to bottom).  I also did 1/2 c choc chips + 1/2 cup PB chips.  These have been a HUGE hit w/ family.  One other thing - when I take them out of the oven I flatten them out a little w/ the spatula - I like the texture better.

these were ok, but I didn't think they were anything fabulous.  The peanut butter flavor was pretty mild and they just didn't bake well.

This was a simple and tasty recipe!  I used semi-sweet chocolate morsels instead and the recipe still turned out wonderfully!  I baked these cookies on cheap grocery store aluminum baking sheets and on a pampered chef stone and had excellent results!  I highly recommend!

I just finished making these. I won't make them again. They don't have very much peanut butter flavor. Also, the top and bottom are really crunchy and the center is not at all chewy. I suspect I will throw away the rest of this batch.

WOW! These are good!  I used shortening since I didn't have butter.  The cookies were done after only 10 minutes, but I made them a little smaller.  I can't wait for my husband to taste them.

My daughter (3-1/2) can't handle hot foods, yet couldn't help eating these right off the cooling rack after only a few minutes!  This is an excellent cookie, chewy, just as the name indicates.  I will try upping the p-butter next time in lieu of some of the butter.  I opted for smaller cookies and used a small cookie scoop (about a Tbsp.)and baked the cookies for 12 min.  They came out perfectly.  Those of you who had trouble with them, I don't know why, because I can't ever make chocolate chip cookies correctly and these were too easy!

These cookies are awesome, I couldn't keep my husband away from them as they came out of the oven.  Someone had recommended using the Pampered Chef MeasureAll to get the right amount for the cookies, I actually used their large scoop and the MeasureAll is great for measuring the peanutbutter in.

I thought these were great!  I used a 1/2 cup peanut butter chips and a 1/2 cup of chocolate to take into account reviews suggesting a little more peanut butter and a little less chocolate.  I also had a handful of salted peanuts on hand, so I chopped them up and added them with the chips at the end of the recipie.  Yum!!!

This recipie was great after I made a few changes! I took the advice of others and added a whole cup of pb.  Then I added mini chips, decreased the oven temp. down to 365, and cooked them for 9 minutes, oh and added crushed up butterfingers!  They were great!!!

A little bland. Tasted like something was missing. Maybe more peanut butter would help.

These are the BEST peanut butter cookies I've ever made. Fast and easy to make which is a good thing since the diasppear so fast too.
Only change I made was to up the peanut butter to 1 cup and omit the chocolate chips.

These are really good.  But I'd add a whole cup of peanut better instead of 1/2 cup for more peanut butter flavor.  My kids ate 'em up in no time!

These cookies are the best!  I used an ice cream scoop to form the dough.  I also added 1/2 cup of chopped peanuts to the original recipe.

I have always had trouble with my cookies coming out of the oven looking like flat pancakes. Not with this receipe! The only thing I did the second time around was I used margarine instead of butter and I added 1 Cup of peanut butter instead of 1/2 cup. I will definitly make these cookies time and again.

I will make these again . I reduced flour to two cups and increased p-nut butter to almost one cup and also rolled them in powdered sugar before baking. My husband raved about them. They are now his new favorite. Thank you so much

I decided to not use the recipe that i usually use, you know trying something new. My initial misgivings regarding the sugar to flour ratio and the peanut butter to flour ratio were right on. I had thought, oh corn syrup, maybe that'll make up for the differences. Results: Dry, Not chewy in the least, Does not flatten or spread while baking. The pre-baked texture is like a refrigerator roll cookie. The ratio of flour to both sugar and peanut butter is too high. Also with the peanut butter ratio being so low, it is only marginally a peanut butter cookie, each cookie features a cruel tease of peanut butter. I'm not trying to be cruel in kind. It's just that the results simply do  match the description. A possible fix would be to increase PB by one cup and sugar by a cup possibly then increasing baking soda by a half tablespoon but i'd only try that after tweaking the PB and sugar content.

I do change it, I take out 1/2 cup of flour and add 1/2 cup of cocoa powder. I reduce the sugar (1/2 cup brown 1/2 cup white) and replace the corn syrup with just more water. They are thicker, but still super chewy and yummy.

Hoping these would be fabulous enough for my sweetie's birthday and they did not disappoint!  Thank you!  Changes others might be interested in that didn't make them any less delish: halved recipe; used "healthy" unsweetened organic peanut butter; didn't use water or corn syrup but increased vanilla to 1 tbsp. (for half recipe); baked in convection oven at 300 for 14 minutes; gently pressed cookies to flatten before baking so they'd bake evenly and baked on parchment.  Out of this world flavor and texture and so easy to make!

These cookies are amazing! The only change I made was to add a trail mix with chocolate candies, peanuts, and raisins (Monster Trail Mix from Target), instead of just chocolate chips.  Chunky chewy, and sooo good! Make sure you have milk in the fridge!

This makes a great cookie! I made a few changes due to circumstance: I substituted honey for the corn syrup, used chocolate chips instead of chopped chocolate, and used a small spoon to portion them out for baking. Also, I cooked them for 10 minutes.  I will definitely make again!

We are peanut, and gluten free so I do almond butter, palm or coconut oil and sub coconut sugar for the brown sugar and honey for the corn syrup and used Pamela's Bread mix for flour. They are so amazing. Everyone can enjoy them and asks for more! I'm making a batch every 2 weeks now and keeping a jar in the kitchen for a quick snack. My super picky eaters love them and I'm happy knowing they're low sugar and have protein

I make these all the time. I like using chocolate chips and peanut butter chips cause you can't have too much peanut butter flavor in my opinion! They come out chewy and delicious.

I wanted to love these, but they just didn’t bake up chewy at all ;(.  In fat, they turned out cakey and left an aftertaste of leavener.  Ick. I threw out the half of the dough I hadn’t yet baked. Not sure what went wrong.

This has become my go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. I have used both smooth and crunchy PB, both great. I also use 2c flour + 1/2c oats.  I put the batter in frig for a while to cool off before baking; or just leave it for a couple days if you like eating the dough! I use parchment paper and bake it no longer than 12-1/2 min to make them chewier.

This is an exceptional recipe. The only tweak I would make, the next time I make it, would be to add more peanut butter as I felt it lacked the desired peanut butter flavor. Probably an extra 1/4 cup would be perfect. I did use a 1 1/2 TBS  generous scoop, not the recommended 1/4cup so the cook time was approximately 11:30. Cookies are big and chewy. Great with coffee or heated up with ice cream.

This recipe turned out absolutely amazing. I substituted coconut nut oil for butter using 1:1 ratio & added extra 1/2 Cup peanutbutter. instead of cookies I converted it to triple layer peanutbutter toffee extra thick brownie bars. instead of chocolate chips I crushed up 2 butterfinger candy bars spread evenly inbetween layers of batter. changed settings for oven to 350° bake in 8x8 pan for bout 30 mins.

Yummy, chewy great cookie.  Note using this size only made 16 cookies but they are huge.  Will use recipe again but make smaller portions.   Ps... I used light agave syrup instead of corn syrup and milk chocolate chips.  Perfection!

These cookies were delicious!  My husband said I could sell these!  I made them exactly as shown in the recipe,  except I subbed honey for corn syrup because I don't really know what corn syrup is or have it in my kitchen.  Also I used white chocolate chips vs milk chocolate bc that's what the hubby wanted. I used Jif creamy as my peanut butter. I popped the dough in the freezer for a half hour after I made it.  Then I used tablespoon scoops and sort of formed them in my hands like flattish meatballs.  I cooked for the full 14 mins at 375, no burning. My cookies actually did spread some but not a ridiculous amount.  They were really kinda perfect.  This will be my new goto cookie recipe!

Cookies looked great! Texture was good. I thought the chocolate chips actually hid the peanut butter taste. If I make these again, I will add chopped dry roasted peanuts and save the chocolate for chocolate chip cookies.

I did not make any changes, and no I will not make it again.
Cookies were not chewy. More cake like, and not much flavor. Needs more peanut butter taste.

"Stacy Crocker" - I mean I'm not Betty but making this recipe sure made me feel like it. Lol I did tweak the recipe a little. I used 1 cup nut flour and 1 cup regular all purpose flour and 1/2 cup Lupin flour. I also didn't have any light carol syrup but I subbed in some Blue Agave low glycemic sweetener.  These cookies were soooo delicious and chewy and moist. Oh my goodness!

These are fantastic!  I am  gluten free, so the only change I made was using Bob’s Red Mill GF  1 to 1 baking flour. These cookies have the greatest taste and texture.  Chewy!  I used Costco’s organic creamy natural peanut butter. Nothing but organic peanuts and sea salt. This will be in my recipe file!

I have never used corn syrup in cookie and I did not like it. It made them oddly sweet. 
Also, the time of 12-14 minutes is too long.  I did 10 minutes and they were a little more done than I prefer.

I added 1/4 cup extra flour as I do to all my cookie recipes so they are thick and chewy. I have been using this recipe for years and it is a crowd favorite!  I have shared the recipe with many others.

This were okay, but the texture was too cakey for my taste. I wouldn’t call these chewy. Also the peanut butter taste was overpowered by the chocolate. I wouldn’t make this again.

I'm sure your cookie dough is tremendous, however, I have a shortcut.  I purchase a box of frozen cookie  rounds.  I cut em in half and place in the baking sheet as shown.  Immediately after taking the cookies come out of the oven, I insert the peanut butter Works very quickly.

Really easy and delicious recipe. I did 1/2 CREAMY AND 1/2 chunky PB and I used 1 C pb chips and 1 1/2 Csemisweet choc chips. These changes are excellent!! Exactly what I was craving and I'm sure they will be a hit!

I made these according to the recipe.  Easy to make, but I have to agree with a lot of reviews that the peanut butter taste is overwhelmed by the chocolate.  I should have used fewer chips.  But I baked them at 375 convection for 14 minutes, and the texture was perfect, so I don’t know what the review that was talking about baking them at 300 for 12 minutes was about.  I’d make them again, but not as much chocolate.

These are delicious. One mistake people may make is not weighing the flour. Packing it in the measuring cup will add too much flour and create a dry cookie. I often crave peanut butter things and Jif worked well with this recipe. I decreased the chocolate chips by 1/2 cup, used Earth Balance in place of the butter, flax eggs in place of chicken eggs, and played with the cooking time. Eleven minutes seemed to be ideal. I lightly pressed the cookies down before baking which made them more attractive in my opinion.

Very tasty cookies! I've taken them to work a couple of times now. The first time I made them, it was suggested that I should add more peanut butter, so now I always add extra peanut butter. Like others, I make these cookies much smaller than the recipe suggests. I usually end up with 50-60 cookies.

Followed the recipe as shown. Made one batch with chocolate chips and one without. Both were delicious! Soft and chewy. I over cooked one batch which made them crunchy but I just put them in an air tight container with a slice of bread overnight and they softened up and were just as good as the rest. Very good recipe.

Made the first batch perfectly, and they turned out great. Made the second batch a little differently. I ran out of corn syrup, so I subbed with molasses and I've got to tell you.....

These cookies are great,  chewy and a little different from the average choc chip cookie. 

Next time, I will add more peanut butter (double the amount) and leave out the corn syrup.

This is a really good cookie.  The only change I would make, and I am ready to do it today,  is to add some peanut butter chips.  I  want a more peanut butter flavor...adding peanuts might work too...maybe next time.

The cookies came out dry and cakey and didn't spread very much. I make cookies a lot and this recipe just didn't yield a very good result. I even tested my baking soda to make sure that wasn't the problem. I will continue looking for a better peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipe. :(

These were really tasty. I won't be dropping them by the 1/4 cup full onto the pan though next time. They burnt on the bottom before they could cook and they are much bigger than I need them to be.  I did one tray of smaller cookies for 10 minutes and they turned out perfectly.

Had to substitute honey for the corn syrup and they turned out perfectly. Also lowered the temperature to 350 and baked on shiny cookie sheet for 15 minutes.

I made a few substitutions:
applesauce instead of eggs
lite maple syrup instead of corn syrup
Dark Chocolate Dream peanut butter instead of regular

They turned out great. Perfect to eat warm, fresh out of the oven with a glass of milk!

1/2 the sugar, used maltose rather corn syrup. Refrigerated the dough and rolled them into balls for a more consistent shape. The letter pressure from rolling the dough made the cookies more chewy

They turned out great!  Next time I will try crunchy peanut butter in place of the regular.  I think that would be a nice addition to the texture of the cookies or just adding in some chopped pecans.

Super super good! I've made these twice and my husband begs for them!
I used honey instead of corn syrup (same amount)
I also made the cookies smaller and baked for 12-13 minutes instead.
They come out so GOOD and chewy and wonderful we love them.

I added a 1 gram of cannibus (CBD/THC) concentrate used a 12 oz bag of MINI semi-sweet chocolate chips and replaced the corn syrup with pure maple syrup.  I I gave  the cookies to my husband for valentines... he thought they were AWESOME (cannibus is legal here in Seattle)

These cookies were soft and stayed that way!! The best peanut butter cookies I have ever eaten.
I made one change and that was to swap corn syrup for equal amount of maple syrup. Highly recommend this recipe.

Fantastic! They disappeared almost as soon as they were baked. Like someone else suggested, I used 1 cup of crunchy Peanut Butter instead of the 1/2 cup suggested and Milk Chocolate Chocolate Chips. Just the right combination of Peanut Butter and chocolate. A winner!

these were delightful. i would give it an extra star if able to. very satiating to the taste buds ,I must say. the creamy peanut butter simply does the tango, while the chocolate does a cha-cha. a very elegant cookie when served with 24 carat gold shavings atop. they can also be quite relaxed if just served raw .  I do say they are most fantastical unbaked finally, to all those who gave it poor reviews : oh go boil your heads you old shark turds. especially YOU stuck up old hag Mr goodytwoshoes!!!!!!

I followed recipe to do exactly what was said and I couldn't taste the peanut butter whatsoever. Truly disappointing.  I tweaked recipe myself so I can taste peanut butter. I question the use of butter in this recipe, it doesn't seem like it was needed. I feel like recipe needs tweaked.

This is a great recipe! Lately I've been cutting down on sugar so I did use a tiny bit less sugar. I also used natural peanut butter with no sugar added. I substituted milk chocolate chips and peanut butter chips, I did half of each for the total amount. I measured them by the drop spoonfuls and baked for 9 minutes per someone else's suggestion. They are really good!

I made this exactly as directed except I used a spoonful rather than 1/4 c (which seemed huge).  The cookies are ok, but lackluster IMHO.  Not one of the better recipes I have made.  Good news-I won't be tempted to overindulge.

These cookies look amazing. Like they came from a bakery, they seriously look like you want to eat them all.  However, the flavor is completely lacking. Not sweet and barely a hint of peanut butter. I would definitely not make them again.

Baked the dough in a cast iron skillet to create a skillet cookie and it was delicious. My family couldn't get enough! Crispy but not burnt at the edges and gooey in the center. Only thing I changed is I left out the corn syrup. Will be making these again soon!!

I followed the recipe exact, stopping at exactly 12 minutes and baking on wax paper. These cookies are thick, fluffy, chewy, and oh so amazing dipped in milk. You lose no milk, it just absorbs it all! That said, my fiance wants more peanut butter flavor and less oil taste. He thinks removing the corn syrup and adding more peanut butter would make them perfect.

I followed the recipe except I used 1/2 cup chunks and 1/2 cup regular semisweet chocolate chips.  It came out very good.  I love peanut butter and chocolate, and this is a nice change-up from using Reese's pieces or peanut butter cups in cookies to make them peanut buttery.

Best cookies I've ever made by far! I'm not an experienced baker, but these turned out fabulous anyway. I followed the recipe to a T (except that I used a full tsp of salt -- I like the contrast it gives to all the sugar). The cookies were thick and chewy and so flavorful. They stayed fresh tasting for the four days that they lasted in our house. This may very well replace our usual cookie recipe!

I made these delish cookies yesterday for a small group gathering and they was a hit. I took some advice from others and used  2 cups  of flour,  a cup of peanut butter, and a cup of chips, and followed the rest  with the same amount.   I do like to add a bit more vanilla.  It just makes any baked goods taste so good. I will treasure this recipe, and make it in many different ways.

I used a full cup of crunchy peanut butter and baked them a few minutes longer.  Great cookie!

This cookie wasn’t salty enough. It was just sweet and there was hardly any peanut butter flavor. I like my cookies to have umami where the flavors are hitting all points of salty and sweet this cookie was lacking so not sure if I’d make it again.

These came out great! I had a craving for a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie and was thrilled with these :D. I did substitute pancake syrup for the corn syrup, and chocolate chips for the chocolate chunks since that was what I had on hand, and they were wonderful!

I will make it again for sure.  Next time I will only use 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips. Very rich and delicious. I wish I had an 1/8th cup measure to drop the cookies in the pan because they are so chewy and amazing that it is hard for me to finish a whole cookie. I didn't have corn syrup so I used pure maple syrup and they taste great.

This is not a bad cookie, generally speaking, but not what I was looking for. It has a good texture and is easy to make, but it has almost no peanut butter flavor.

Loved these cookies!! The only thing to change is that a 1/4 cupful is WAY too big for a cookie! Tablespoonfuls are plenty big enough.

Great texture and flavor. I made the first batch exactly as the recipe called for and they were really good but HUGE. I did another batch at half the size and half the time. Also really good. There’s a time and place for each size but it’s good to know that the recipe will work either way. This is a winner!

Made the recipe exactly as was written.
- almost undetecteable taste of peanut butter
- flatten those suckers, or they will burn on the bottom and be raw in the middle 
- 1/4 cup scoop size makes 18 cookies, NOT 24

Will not make again, they aren’t terrible...just...blah

Changes- substituted honey for the corn syrup, only added 1 cup of chocolate chips, and baked for 10 minutes.

Best peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever used. My boyfriend does not have a sweet tooth but when I make these, I have to set of them aside so he doesn't eat them all in one sitting. The one change I make is using honey instead of corn syrup. Thanks for the great recipe!

Made only the slightest change. Left out the water and added an extra half cup peanut butter. Made 24 cookies but found they needed about 17 mins in the oven. Perfection!

Bake time is much too long! I did 375F for 12 min and the bottom of the cookies were already starting to burn at 10 min but the top did not look done yet. Also, there is not much peanut butter taste. Will not do this recipe again.

I made the recipe almost exactly the same. Only thing is I doubled it! It made roughly 135, tablespoon cookies. They don’t spread much so you can cook more at a time. There isn’t enough peanut butter flavour, the pb flavour is very mild, so I think next time I will add more. Perfect amount of chocolate chips! Very soft. Fan favourite!

Very good and chewy. I used I cup semi sweet chocolate chips and 8 Reese peanut butter cups broken into pieces. I also chilled the dough for 20 mins  before baking.

excellent recipe.   perfect consistency, chewy.  Not cakey.   The dough is a little softer than I am used to and I wondered if I should have chilled it for a bit.  But I have never been known to voluntarily wait for cookie dough to chill.  I lucked out and it turned out perfect.

I just made these cookies for our quilt guild meeting.  OMG!  They are so delicious!  The only changes I made to the original recipe is I pressed them down with a fork and  baked them for 15 minutes as they are very thick. I used creamy peanut butter and chopped up about one cup of unsalted peanuts. The dough gets very thick as you add the last of the flour and the chocolate chips and chopped peanuts. You may have to change out to your bread hook on your mixer at the very end. I doubled the batch so there will be enough for every one at quilt guild meeting.  The picture is from the first two cookie sheets I baked.  It made approx. 4 dozen when doubled. They are like the monster cookies you buy at the bakery or supermarket deli!

I didn't have any corn syrup, so I substituted honey. The cookies were soft and very good. I made a double batch and my husband and daughter had them gone in a few days. Not much peanut butter taste, but still a delicious cookie

Took the advice of other reviewers and used a little over 1 cup of peanut butter, reduced the flour to 2 cups, and used 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips. I refrigerated the dough overnight to make it easier to work with. I made the cookies into thick disks before baking and it worked out that they didn't stay too mounded, nor did they spread too much. I used parchment paper (lifesaver!). My temp and time were different depending on the pan (dark vs light) so it's best if you know the personality of your oven and bakeware to get the right doneness. If I make these again, I might leave out the flour altogether, and will use even less chocolate chips. I do like the large size cookies. My husband said, "What's wrong with big cookies?" He's right, nothing!

Delicious, and baked up perfectly.  I used chicolate chips instead of chopped chocolate, 2 T of milk instead of water, scooped with a medium cookie scoop, and baked for 9 minutes.

This recipe is perfect for our taste preference. I decreased the drop size by half for a smaller cookie and ended up with four dozen cookies. No other changes makes this one a real keeper!

We thought these were great. Made just as directed... used crunchy pb because that’s what I had and realized I was short the chocolate chips so emptied a couple of partial bags of milk chocolate chips, Heath bar chips, and mini chocolate chips.  Delicious!

Delicious soft and chewy cookies. Simply follow the directions. I removed my cookies from the oven a couple of minutes early to get that chewy greatness.
I transferred them immediately to a cooling rack.

I replaced the corn syrup with 1tbsp vegetable oil and the water with a shot of espresso, and used white chocolate chips. Also accidentally made them WAY TOO BIG for the first set in the oven. Overall they turned out good, the espresso adds to the flavor depth without a strong coffee flavor.

I was disappointed with these. Maybe because I wanted peanut butter cookies and these didn't have enough peanut butter flavor. Can't even tell there is peanut butter in them. They came out fluffy but not what I would consider chewy. Sort of cake like.  Very blah. Would not make again.

I really enjoy the recipe - it's soft and chewy! Delicious!  Only complaint is that it could have more peanut butter flavour.  So, I made it today and used 1/2 mini chocolate chip and 1/2 mini baking Reese's pieces.  Also,  added a couple more tablespoons of peanut butter and no water.  So good!

I took out 1/2 cup of flour and added 1 cup of rolled oats. I also used molasses instead of corn syrup (because that's what I had on hand) and used one cup of mini chocolate chips. They came out great! Crisp on the outside, fluffy inside.

4 stars only because I followed recommendations of others, which changed the original recipe. Used 1 cup PB, 1.5 cup brown sugar (no white), honey instead of corn syrup, 1 tbsp vanilla extract, 2 cups flour. I used a mixture of peanuts, mini PB cups and chocolate chips. Baked at 350 for 12 minutes, which worked for my oven. Terrific soft, chewy PB-rich cookie.

For me, these cookies were too sweet. For my husband, they were the best thing ever. If I made them again for myself, I would use more peanut butter, use a little less sugar, leave out the corn syrup entirely, and add a 1/4 tsp more salt. Also, these cookies DO NOT spread. They will stay the exact shape they are put onto the cookie sheet. The first batch I made (using a cookie scoop), stayed in a mound shape, and weren't done in the middle even though the bottom of the cookies were browned. The second batch, I flattened the cookies and they were perfectly cooked after 13 minutes in the oven.

Yummy! I think my husband is going to love these! I have him spoiled because I love to bake and he loves his sweets! These will truly be a hit with him!

Update: He absolutely loves them! He said that that is how cookies are supposed to taste! 
Thank you for the recipe!

Followed the recipe with the exception I added peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips. The kids loved them and said they were better than my other peanut butter cookies....Ha. So, yes, I will be making these again. I read on some reviews these cookies didn't flatten, but they did for me?.

I followed this recipe exactly. It said to bake 375 for 12-14 minutes.  I put them in for 12 minutes and they were almost burnt when I took them out......they were very crispy.  So, the next batch I set the timer for 10 minutes and kept checking on them.  I ended up taking them out at 9 minutes.  They were nicely browned but not crunchy.  I like a soft cookie. They had good flavor.  I will make these again.

I followed the recipe, except for the cookie size and cooking time as others suggested. I dropped by large spoonfuls and baked for about 10 minutes. The cookies came out soft and gooey. I will use this recipe again.

The taste is awesome. However, I have some questions - the cookies didn't turn out to be cracked and for some reason, no matter how many batches we tried with the different combinations of oven temperature and timing (based on the recipe and the comment recommendations), the bottom sides of the cookies turned brown. Can anyone tell me how to correct the 2 mistakes

Delicious cookies that were even better the next day. Followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of splitting the dough before adding the chocolate chips to leave half as plain peanut butter cookies and add chocolate chips to the remaining half. Only tips I have is to smash the cookie dough flat on the baking sheet, and leave an inch of space all the way around as they do spread during the baking process. Will be making again.

Not worth the calories. They were totally bland. I could hardly taste the PB at all.  The only thing good about them is the chocolate chips. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a complete waste of time and ingredients. Told my neighbor I'd bring some over before I made them....now I don't even want to.

These came out pretty darn good. I followed the original recipe except I added 1 cup peanut butter chips and 1 cup chocolate chips. I love peanut butter so next time I may add a whole cup of peanut butter like some others have suggested.

Like others have mentioned, I followed the instructions closely but the cookies came out hard not chewy. I did not have any corn syrup on hand, so perhaps that was the defining difference.

Fantastic recipe! I was looking for a base recipe to make a gluten-free version of the large peanut butter cup cookies that Barnes & Noble sells. This worked perfectly. I used the proportions as stated, just substituting gluten-free baking mix for the flour and miniature Reese's cups for the chocolate chips. The cookies were a big hit.

Made this at least a dozen times, and still love them, wouldn't change a thing.... except maybe if you feel like using chocolate chips instead of semi sweet..... other than that, can't go wrong

I had a craving for peanut butter cookies and these really hit the spot. I love it that these have a nice balance of light peanutty flavor. They are halfway between a chocolate chip cookie and a peanut butter cookie, which is exactly what I was hoping for. I only strayed from the recipe by using dark corn syrup rather than light, only because that is what I had. I will make these again for sure. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Thank you for the perfect chewy cookie.  As a self appointed "chipologist" I like to think I know a thing or two about the perfect cookie. Sadly, I was NEVER able to produce one out of my own kitchen...embarrassing I know. However, this recipe is now the only one I use. Perfect texture! The only thing is the peanut butter taste is very subtle. Therefore, if you want that taste to be dominant, you need to add more PB. This wasn't a deal breaker for me so 5 stars it is!

Didn't use as much flour, cut the sugar by about half (still was very sweet... American recipes use too much sugar) and used maple syrup since I didn't have corn syrup. I also dropped spoonfuls and baked for 9 minutes, because I don't know how you're supposed to measure 1/4 cupfuls... and the end result was quite nice! Very soft and chewy, and the cookies don't spread. BUT I think they weren't as peanut buttery as I'd have liked. I could taste hints of it but imo peanut butter cookies should be IN YOUR FACE PEANUT BUTTER :D Anyway everyone seemed to love them, so I'll be making these again!!

They were good. I have a few nitpicks such as they didn't taste that peanut buttery. Next time I'll probably add a full cup of peanut butter. For the first two batches I baked them at the minimum suggested time.  They were a little too overdone for my taste so I took off three minutes like the other reviewers did. The third batch was much better for my preference. I would definitely make these again the next time I'm in the mood for peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies.

Absolutely Amazing.  I never leave reviews but these are worthy.  Made exactly as directed.  Used the butter as directed, instead of the margarine i usually bake.   Attractive, puffy cookie!   Will make again but need to hide them so I won't eat them all!  TRY THESE!

Turned out really good. Only thing I did was substitute the corn syrup (never have it in the house because I don't use it) with honey, and due to time restraints (was making a batch for my friend and she had to go home early) I made them into bars. Baking times did change to anywhere to 15-20 minutes, then after, I added a chocolate drizzle and they turned out good. Will be making this again.

This is more like a cake than a cookie. Although they baked up fine, I felt the recipe needed more salt. But was most disappointing was the lack of peanut butter flavor. I won't make this recipe again.

These turned out huge and deliscoius! They stay pretty true to scooped size so if you want more try dropping by  1/8 cup instead of 1/4 cup.

Not really good, not sure what I did wrong- very cake like.
Almost no peanut butter taste.I went back and double checked the ingredients, it was all correct. I lowered the oven temp to 350 and made them smaller, and that helped a bit.

Delicious!  These just have a hint of peanut butter. I love the chewy texture!  I followed the recipe, but I used the suggestions others had made and did it by the spoonful and then baked for 9 minutes.   Perfect!

I have made these about six times now! I have added a cup of white chocolate chips  with dark chocolate chips. I also add a half to 3/4s cup oatmeal and a cup of walnuts! My kids cant get enough of them! I have added only one egg and they were just as good and chewy! I just popped some in the oven tonight! You do have to make up for the liquid  if your going to use less egg but its real hard to mess this one up! :D

These cookies have come out awesome both times I have made them.  I did switch out the corn syrup for blue agave nectar but that was just for personal preference. I used the quarter cup both times as well which neither time gave me the 2 dozen yield, but if you know me I don't need 24 cookies at my disposal;)

Delicious!! They aren't chewy though. Still, that takes nothing away from the yumminess. The peanut butter was very subtle and well complimented by the chocolate. We didn't use corn syrup and replaced the baking soda with baking powder. We also omitted the brown sugar entirely. All in all, this was a great recipe. We will definitely make it again.

These are the peanut butter cookies I remember as a child. Yummy!  
This recipe easily makes three dozen but, of course it depends on how big you make your cookies. I made two dozen about the size of a ping pong ball and the last dozen (I got tired) more like a golf ball size. Because the cookies don't spread (just like any peanut butter cookie sans the fork marks) I slightly mashed down the balls before baking them. I baked one batch for 11minutes, the second for 9 minutes and the third for 10 minutes. 10 was just right as they came out brown on the bottom, more done in the middle bu still chewy. This week ll all depend on your oven-mine cooks a little hotter. Also, I didn't chop my chocolate chips (why all that work?) but only added 11/2 cup of chips. Actually I could have cut it down the o 1 1/4 and there would of have been plenty. All and all this was a great, simple, and tasty recipe.

Made as written. Wonderful cookie, DH and next door neighbors loved them. What can be wrong with peanut butter and chocolate...NOTHING. Did make the cookies smaller and baked for only 9 minutes.

I put in 1/2 cup less sugar than the recipe called for, half the chocolate bits and left out the corn syrup and it was still too sweet for us. We liked the flavor though, so I'll try them again with just 1/2 cup of the chocolate and even less sugar.

I love these cookies and I make them ALL  THE TIME. They don't really flatten out and they're very very chewy. However, I do add more peanut butter for a more peanut buttery flavor and I also add cinnamon and nutmeg, which makes it more delicious in my opinion.

I found the 1/4 cup sized cookie was far too big, so I broke them in half and baked them for 7-8 minutes.  I also substituted honey 1:1 for the corn syrup.
Delicious!

Made this for a family picnic. Followed the recipe exactly and the cookies were great. They all went and they were soft in the middle. Not an overwhelming peanut butter flavor.

I used a tablespoon measuring spoon to spoon them onto the baking sheet and cooked for nine minutes. They were perfectly done! Only thing I would change in the recipe is the amount of chocolate chips. Only needed a cup and a half of chocolate chips. They were definitely chewy, but nothing special!

This is the best cookie recipe ever.  After I mixed the ingredients I formed the cookies, using a ice cream scoop and put it in the freezer for about a half hour on the baking sheet.  I then baked for about sixteen minutes.  Husband loved them. Its a keeper!

I recently made this recipe and these cookies were a huge hit! I did halve both the brown sugar and white sugar and reduced the chocolate chips to 1 1/2  cups. I dropped by teaspoonfuls and baked for 9 minutes. They turned out perfect!

I loved the cookies, they were chewy and very easy to make. The only I would change if I were to make them again is to add more peanut butter. The cookies need more than just 1/2 cup of peanut butter, but other than that this recipe is great!

Way too sweet! I could barely taste the peanut butter. I would either cut on the corn syrup or white sugar amount. I would also add a lot more peanut butter and probably cut on butter next time.

They turned out ok. I don't like using Caro syrup in my cookies. I have a better chocolate chip cookie recipe. You can't really even taste the peanut butter in these.

Delicious! Adjustments made: Increased PB to 1 cup, lowered temp. to 350. My cookies were two tablespoons each, and I baked them for 10 minutes. They came out perfect.

I forgot to add the water.  Even so, they turned out great.  I made 2/3 of them tablespoon sized, baked 9 minutes.  The rest of the batch I used the suggested 1/4 cup size and baked 15 minutes.  Now those are some confections of Biblical proportions!  P.S.  Don't leave out the corn syrup because that is what helps cookies have that perfect chewy texture.  And, you CAN  add the traditional fork criss cross on top if you prefer, just try not to flatten them out much.

They were good but only one little problem with them.  They need a little more peanut butter taste and maybe a little less salt.  I will make them again and let you know how I made out.  
June-I made this recipe again but made some substitutions and just a couple little changes.  They turned out awesome.  I put a 1/4 cup of  cream cheese and a 1/4 cup butter to start.  Put 3/4 cup peanut butter and only an 1/8 t. salt.

I loved making these cookies! I made them without the corn syrup, and had to bake them for closer to about 15 minutes but they came out beautifully! I gave a few of them away to people and they got great reviews. Will definitely make these again!

I agree with the other reviewers- up the peanut butter to 1 cup, lower the flour to 2 cups, I also use fewer chocolate chips (which really says something because I am a complete chocoholic).  Also,  9-10 minutes baking time is perfect.  So good!

A really nice cookie, with a subtle peanut butter flavor. I followed the recipe to a "T" and it made 3 dozen cookies, using my 1-1/2 Tbls. cookie scoop. Baked for exactly 13 minutes. Kids will be happy campers when they get home from school! Thanks for the recipe!

Great basic chewy peanut butter cookie. Made with 3/4 c brown sugar and 3/4 cup splenda, used 1/2 dark choc chips and 1/2 regular. Made about 50 small cookies, did not spread much at all (30 on a baking sheet). Nutrition this way-106 cal and 13 carbs/cookie. Cooked at 365 degrees for 13 min.

Amazing cookies! Soft on the inside and have a nice crunch on the outside! We did like a lot of people have been recommending by making the cookies in tablespoon measuring cups and it works very well. We ended up having four sheets of cookies though.

These were tasty and ok cookies.  Worrying from the other reviews I added a bit more peanut butter.  They were cake like and tasteless.  Will need to add another half cup or more, I believe one reader even substituted more peanut butter for regular butter and I think that would work as mine became a bit "wet" with the extra peanut butter.  Has a lot of potential and I'm willing to try again.

This recipe has too much flour, not enough peanut butter, and the cookies are fairly hard and tasteless.  I see reviews which have 50-100% more pnut butter, less flour, and one with some orange juice which sound excellent.  Next time!

I made it twice, the first to a T and then I altered it. I couldn't tell there was any peanut butter in the original recipe, and they needed more to have it in the title. I dropped the butter down to 3T and doubled the PB to a whole cup. Now they are Absolutely Perfect! Enjoy :)

I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet choc. bits and increased the bits by 1/2 cup. I also took Moosemommys' advice and decreased the baking time to 9 min. They were out of this world delicious!!! My husband loved them and so did my co-workers!!! I am getting ready to make another batch right now!!

These were pretty good, and I like that they were nice and soft. I think I had bad peanut butter though, so I will try these again, and I might just add a little more peanut butter for a nuttier taste. Really good, thank you!

I used less flour (1/2 cup less) and omitted the water. I also used a medium cookie scooper and baked for 8-9 minutes. They turned out great.

This is my go to peanut butter chocolate chip cookie recipe. They end up REALLY large with a 1/4 cup scoop, but they are  chewy on the inside with the perfect crunch on the outside so the size is perfect. They need a little more time in the oven than what was listed though, just about 2-4 mins.

Great, basic cookie dough.  There is less peanut butter in these cookies than what I would call true peanut butter cookies, so the texture of the center of cookie is more chewy than traditional peanut butter cookies.  The baked cookie also tastes a bit less peanut-buttery.  This cookie dough lends itself to many possibilities for substitution of the chocolate chips with any sort of nut and/or dried fruit.  A good ratio might be half nuts and half chips/dried fruit to achieve the correct balance of sweetness. You could also go a bit heavier on the chip/nut/dried fruit combination if you prefer (like I do).  I made mine with 1/4 cup of dough for each cookie and I pressed the center of each with the 1/4 cup measuring cup (I did not sugar the cup before pressing).  They would have been prettier if I had also scored them with a fork or potato masher.  I baked for 12-14 min at the recommended temperature.  I froze them as soon as they were cooled in individual zip lock sandwich bags so they are easy to grab for on-the-go lunchbags.  I will be making these again, probably with cranberries, butterscotch chips and walnuts, a combination my family loves.

This is easily the best cookie I've ever had. I added a tsp of maple extract and over filled on the corn syrup and portioned the recipe amount into 16 cookies and they are a huge hit. I also used chunky peanut  butter which adds to it. I can't get over how delicious these are. Kudos to the creator of this amaing recipe!

they're crunchy on the outside, yet chewy on the inside. All around delicious! MY HUSBAND IS A PEANUT BUTTER FREAK. The whole batch was gone before I could say "Chewy Peanut Butter Chocolate Cookies".  I loved that I didn't even have to grease the pan! My half sisters step son's friend said they were the "best thing [he's] ever blessed [his] tastebuds with".

I have made many cookies of this site, and these are my absolute favorite! The only modifications I made were to substitute honey for corn syrup and mini chocolate chips for chocolate chunks. Keep them at the larger size, in 13 minutes they are perfectly crispy on the outside while still chewy and moist on the inside. Fantastic cookie!!!

Delicious and easy.   I used a dough scoop (looks like a small ice cream scoop) to drop the cookie dough onto silpat lined baking sheet.  The first dozen I didn't press down,  I just baked them in that form, kinda rounded for about 12 minutes and they were fluffy and soft.  Still chewy and delicious .  For the next dozen, I still used the scoop, but this time I made the classic criss cross with a fork as you would do with regular peanut butter cookies and baked the full 14 minutes.   These were a bit crispy around the edges, but still chewy in the middle in their flattend state, more crunch.  Both ways, this cookie was awesome.   Also, I used butter flavor cisco in place of the butter, and used half dark chocolate morsels and half regular chocolate chips.  I will definitely add this to my cookie rapport and it is sure to quickly became a favorite!

These cookies were a HUGE hit!! They don't flatten out ( I hate flat cookies), and are very chewy  and moist. I didn't change one thing.. The recipe is perfect as is.

I'm not a big fan of peanut butter, but these were fantastic! To add a you yummy taste put some condensed milk in the batter for a final touch (300 ml). Amazing

I really liked how these cookies turned out. I was a bit low on chocolate chips so I put in about a cup instead of 2, but if I were to make them again I definitely would add more chips because chocolate and peanut butter is such a yummy combination. I just wish they were a bit more peanut buttery.

I make cookies for  a 63 year old lady that does not have teeth and she loves these cookies. I make them a bit bigger but cook them for the same time.  That makes them very moist.

After reading reviews, I made the recipe as is but decreased the size of the cookies to about 1.5 teaspoons, baked for 10 mins and they came out great. They are very moist, but not as peanut buttery as I would like. More of a chewy chocolate chip cookie with a hint of peanut. But delish and I would make again!

This wasn't much of a peanut butter cookie. We could barely taste that. It was a wonderful chocolate chip cookie though. Substituted honey for the corn syrup.  Best cookie recipe we've tried yet. They came out looking perfect.

These cookies are so delicious! I followed the recipe as it is written. The only thing I did differently was make my own corn syrup. The first half of my cookies I made smaller and baked for 10 minutes. The second half I made larger and baked about 14 minutes. The larger cookies came out so thick, moist, and chewy, however; the smaller cookies are still super delicious. I will make these cookies again especially since my husband's favorite cookies are peanut butter!! Thanks for posting this recipe.

I didn't use as many chocolate chips. After the first batch I sampled a few and they tasted like bland shortbread cookies with chocolate chips. I added another 1/2 cup of peanut butter but it didn't make much of a difference. Still bland. I won't use this recipe again.

These are amazing!! I didn't have the syrup so I followed a previous review and used honey instead. These will now be a regular in my house! My husband took a little over a dozen to work and they were gone within an hour!! I even overbaked a tray and they still came out rather soft.

I made a slightly smaller cookie and baked them for 11 minutes.

Very easy, I used a Kitchenaid mixer and it went very smoothly.  Doubled the recepie and it made about 50 cookies.  

Very good, soft in the middle, not chewy but more cake-like

I would recommend putting this in the refrigerator for a while to allow the ingredients to meld and not be puffy, but more dense and chewy.

I baked these for my friends and they adored it! I replaced corn syrup for 1 teaspoon of sugar mixed into 1  teaspoon of water. For me they didn't spread to much or stick to the pan, and so it was perfection! Very good recipe, its a keeper!

These cookies were very good but my husband and I wish they had a little more peanut butter flavor. And I ate one of these cookies fresh out of the oven it was absolutely delicious. When I ate one later I thought it was a little too bread like. I share these with my neighbors and they told me they were delicious. I do recommend this recipe.

Its a good cookie but you can hardly tell that it is a peanut butter cookie.  My mother in law said they were amazing chocolate chip cookies!  So, if you are looking for a peanuty cookie with chocolate chips search elsewhere.  Oh, and I followed the recipe to the letter.

Love them I didn't crush the chocolate chips. I substituted the brown sugar  for splenda version. They were a hit. I want to use splenda sugar all the way around and try it that way next time

Absolutely delicious! I add a smidge more peanut butter and use a mix of mini and regular chocolate chips. People who don't even like cookies say these are delicious! I would definitely recommend these!

Oh my!  We're cookie monsters at our house, and this was a superb recipe! I profited from some of the other reviewers who tweaked the recipe a bit.  I used close to 3/4 cup chunky natural peanut butter.  I did not pack the brown sugar, just spoon/pour it in the cup.  Experience has proven that one can decrease the sugar in most cookie recipes by 1/4 cup with no noticeable loss in flavor.  I used 2 T. honey instead of corn syrup, and 1-1/2 cups of chocolate chips.  I mixed mini chips and regular sized ones.  350 degrees for 12 minutes was just perfect in my oven.  I have a multitude of cookie recipes, and this is one of the best, texture and taste. You're right, they are addictive.  Thanks Kathy.  I will definitely pass this one on!

Absolutely amazing. Not only did mine come out chewy and delicious, but they pleased everyone! However, I did put them in for nine minutes instead and I adjusted the size. Otherwise, bravo and thank you for the recipe.

These didn't taste like peanut butter cookies although they were good. Very little peanutbutter flavor and they were very sweet. They also were flat as a pancake when lrft to cool. Won't be making these again.

Amazing recipe.  This is literally the first time for me to bake cookies.  Im a rookie in the kitchen basically.  And i made this recipe . I however used honey instead of corn syrup and 9 minutes in the oven instead of 12. They turned out amazing! It was chewy and taste heavenly . My brothers, my wife and even my friends loved it

Great texture and smelled fantastic but not nearly enough peanut butter taste. If I made again I would double the peanut butter.

I had to adjust the Baking soda for high altitude but other than that they were perfect. I hate cakey or crusty cookies and these were neither. I added pecans second time around. This is the first baking recipe that has turned out right since I moved to Colorado from Texas. This is a keeper.

We enjoyed these cookies, but wished they had more peanut butter flavor.  The texture of these cookies - soft on the inside and just a touch of crisp around the edges - is a great feature of the recipe.  I will try it again (with some adjustments for peanut butter flavor!) for that reason.

I left out the corn syrup and it came out great.  Good peanut butter flavor, and the best looking ones are the ones I didn't try to smooth out.  Just drop and leave them!

I didn't care for these. The texture was odd. Fluffy, not chewy as described. The flavor was not great. Not peanut buttery enough, and not sweet enough. Too bland.

Followed the recipe exactly and loved everything about it.  I have also made the recipe substituting chopped up Reese's Cups for the semi sweet chocolate for an extra peanut butter rush! This is now a regular in my house!

Made according to recipe only I swapped out 1/2 the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips and then added some chopped peanuts. I also flattened the cookies before baking with the bottom of a 3" glass dipped in flour. They came out perfect.  Love these cookies, have made them before but just wanted to add my review.  Thanks for the great recipe Kathy

This was a hit BUT I subbed avocado for the butter and raw honey for the corn syrup. As someone mentioned, the temp of the oven in the recipe is too high- it made them burn on the bottom and under cook in the middle. I had to pull them out and cut off the burnt bottoms.  Then put them back in at 320 for 5 mins. Perfection!!!

Used crunchy PB in place of creamy and omitted the corn syrup. They were good, not great. Kids and hubby liked them - me, not so much. I also used tablespoon dropping not 1/4 cupfuls and baked 10-12 minutes.

These are great cookies! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderful. I didn't use a 1/4 cup measure for dipping up the cookies; used a tablespoon and my cookies were slightly smaller than the recipe. I got 4 1/2 dozen cookies. They smelled like peanut butter cookies while baking and tasted like peanut butter cookies when eaten. I use quality peanut butter, though--not store brand. My first pan baked a little long so were a little more crispy than chewy, but the rest were nice and chewy. Keep an eye on the clock after the pan is out of the oven and be sure to take up the cookies or they will become welded to the baking sheet. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

These cookies were a huge hit at work! They came out wonderfully chewy and tasty, and stayed moist in a tin (with a piece of bread) for a good week. Followed the recipe, except that I used crunchy natural peanut butter. One thing I would like to try next time is to use smaller chocolate chips--to get a more even distribution of chocolate. Or maybe even some big chips and some little ones!

I added 1 cup of peanut butter and extra 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. Left out corn syrup.  Amazing. Very chewy. My husband loved them.

This recipe is OK.  I have made it several times as I like more chew in my cookies.  The first time I made it it came out pretty good.  The last few times it was  too thick and cake like.  The only difference was I used a gas oven the first time.  Like others have stated there is no real peanut butter flavor, only a hint of it.  I would reduce flour by 1/2 cup or until texture is right.  Also leaving the dough in the fridge over night helps to meld the butter/sugar with the flour better and the cookies don't come out quite so fluffy. On the up side I can leave these cookies out for a couple of days and they don't get rock hard.

I loves this recipe! I almost though it needed a little bit more peanut butter. But still very good. My family finished them the same night I made them! I also used 2 chopped Hershey's bars instead of chocolate chips. it worked very well and added more flavor!

Where is the peanut butter taste? I even doubled the peanut butter. Others were correct when they said these cookies are cake-like instead of chewy. They're soft, but not chewy.

I didn't have any corn syrup, so substituted oil and it still came out fantastic.

The cookies turned out really good and stayed soft and delicious. My only complaint is that they peanut butter taste was drowned out by the chocolate chips. Next time I make them (and there will be a next time) I am going to try a mix of PB and chocolate chips or even PB M&Ms!

Delicious and very addciting cookies.  There are a few things I changed though.   I only used 2 cups of flower and used semisweet chocolate chips.  Also I baked them for 9 min.  They were perfect that way.  I think any longer would be too long.  They were very chewey and not undercooked.   They were a huge hit in my house!

Loved that these didn't spread so much so you don't end up with a flat cookie. I'm a mound cookie kinda gal myself. I didn't have any vanilla extract so I didn't use it but these cookies came out amazing without it. Delicious treats for the whole family and I got lots of kudos for these. The peanut butter and chocolate chips are truly a match made in heaven. So glad I found this recipe!

These cookies were OK...I don't think they had a prominent peanut butter taste even though I actually added more peanut butter. They were not bad, but I have definitely had better. Somewhat disappointed since I doubled the batch:-(

Very good.  My daughter loved them.  Dropped by spoonfuls and baked at 365 degrees for 9-10minutes, but I have never had success with recipes that use 375.  Also, they baked better on a pan that was NOT nonstick (dark).

I'm new to baking. I really through a lot of these reviews so made a few changes:
- did not have corn syrup so I used honey
-turned down the temp and cooked them longer
-smaller cookie size
-only used white sugar

The honey worked great, and the sugar doesn't seem to matter.
HOWEVER, baking at 375 is perfect but because I did make the cookies smaller (spoonfuls), I baked for ten minutes.
PERFECT!

I got it the second time. The first time they turned into rocks...

I didn't have corn syrup so subbed in some simple syrup I had in the fridge. These are some REALLY good cookies.

This recipe was super easy and super yummy.  My 12 year old daughter made the cookies herself.  We did however adjust the cookie size to large tablespoon drops and reduced the baking time to 8 minutes.  Perfect!

I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and the cookies turned out awesome.  Really light and fluffy.  The only thing I did different was to make the cookies smaller.  I used a 2-teaspoon cookie scoop and baked the cookies for 8 minutes.  Bake until the bottom edges are just turning golden brown.  Any longer and the cookies will be overdone.  Thank you for this recipe!  I will make again and again.

I didn't care for these cookies much. The flavor is definitely a 2-star rating because it needs more peanut butter flavor. I even doubled the peanut butter. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because they do have a great texture and stay soft.

I joined just to post my thanks to the chef! I used Agave instead of corn syrup and bittersweet chunks instead.  My husband really like these because he said they weren't overly sweet like chocolate chip cookies. The peanut butter taste wasn't overpowered by the chocolate either.  Very nice! Also, it was time to join since I use this site so much!

I just made this recipe. It said it only make 2 dozen so I doubled it and ended up with 96 cookies. I used a cookie scoop. I don't know what happened. They taste good, but could be a little more peanut buttery.

I accidentally decreased the flour to 2 cups (apparently I can't read) but they were a great texture.  I think next time, I'd increase the peanut butter by another half cup and reduce the butter a tad to compensate.  They aren't super peanut buttery, but they're a great cookie.  I used mini chocolate chips and dropped them by a regular-sized cookie scoop and baked for 10 minutes - they look like they came from a bakery.  I'll definitely make these again!

The only thing I changed was to use milk instead of water (I don't get using water when baking a dessert), and I did make them smaller, baking about 9-11 minutes.  They were a huge hit at work, people kept coming back for more, and two people actually called them crack.  Easy recipe, with great results!  And they are actually chewy!

I followed the recipe with the exception of using chocolate chips instead of chunks.  When these cookies first came out of the oven I was undecided.  Not sweet enough,  too floury. I set them aside to rest for an hour or so and when I tried the next one I knew these were the ones!  Yummy yummy.  I don't know how the resting helped but they seemed settled and most and chewy just like they're supposed to be!

Absolutely amazing! I read the reviews and did spoondrop (about 1 tbsp scoop) for 9 minutes. I added another minute because I like the cookies to be a little more brown on the top. I also reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup and I next time I will reduce them even further to 3/4 cups. I also want to increase the peanut butter taste so I am also planning to increase the peanut butter to 1 cup and reduce the amount of brown sugar to 3/4 cup. Not sure if these modifications will work but I will post when I do it.

Two words come to mind: "HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT." I was really looking forward to making these cookies; I absolutely love chewy cookies, not to mention chocolate and peanut butter. However, they were not chewy at all, they were lumpy (like a drop cookie), plus slightly hard. We managed to choke some of them down with a jug of milk; however, it was not an enjoyable experience. (My 4 1/2 year old grandchildren thought the cookies were good; however, at their age, they don't yet know what a bad cookie tastes like!)

Really chewy and moist - delish! I actually substituted almond butter for the peanut butter as I didn't have enough peanut butter on hand and they are really good. I'm looking forward to making them again, next time as actual peanut butter cookies! I did drop them in spoonfuls as suggested by other reviewers and baked for about 9 minutes and they were perfect!

Excellent, soft and chewy cookie. My husband who thought he didn't like peanut butter chocolate chip cookies can't keep out of them. I made a few changes...I used dark chocolate chips, chunky peanut butter, used my cookie scoop and baked at 350 degrees for exactly 9 minutes. They are perfect!

Followed the recipe as written. Didn't quite pack the peanut butter punch I was hoping for. Tasted more like Toll House chocolate chip cookies. But good nonetheless.

It's the basic peanut butter cookie that you can alter easily- Add nuts, peanut butter chips, chocolate chips, etc. I made mine using 3/4 C of peanut butter chips + 3/4 C of milk chocolate chips. It tastes pretty good but because the cookie batter turned same golden colour as peanut butter chips, it didn't look as good as 100% chocolate chips- my bad... I followed other people's suggestions and used 3/4 C of peanut butter and only 2 C of flour- result: soft cookie but spread a lot even with refrigeration prior to baking. My guess is that if I followed the original recipe, then the cookies wouldn't have spread as much. Good cookies but nothing that makes it to be superior than others... but still good cookie is still something to be desired. ^_^

Delicious' I like that the peanut butter flavor is subtle.  I did add an extra tablespoon of peanut butter at the request of my family. Otherwise, I kept it as is. Best with guittard semi sweet chocolate chips.

I made these a while ago and they were a huge hit! I dropped them by small spoonfuls, because quarter-cupfuls were simply too big. My family loved them and my best friend and her boyfriend had to visit me especially to take a lot of cookies home with them (her boyfriend has complimented me multiple times and my best friend has requested these countless times for different occasions).

This is a good cookies!!  But they tasted to me more of a chocolate chip cookies with a hint of peanut better.  But the chewy texture was very nice.  Be advidsed that cookies won't be chewy until they are competely cooled off.  I tried one while they were still warm and wasn't chewy at all!!  I thought I did something wrong but the same cookie turned chewy as it was supposed to be as it cooled down.  I'm NOT a huge chocolate chip type of person, so I thought it had too much chocolate chip but I think they're pretty good cookies.

These are definitely soft and chewy, but very plain tasting (I really can't taste the peanut butter at all). 

I have allergies so I had to make a couple of substitutions, and those could have made all the difference to the flavour. I replaced the butter with canola oil and used natural unsweetened peanut butter (the kind you have to keep in the fridge). I think part of the "plain" taste is from not having enough peanut butter in the recipe and also because with unsweetened peanut butter, more sugar is required (which I did not add - 1.5 cups seemed like plenty!). Next time I would try adding more peanut butter and more sugar and a little more salt.

I think this batter needs to be chilled somewhat before baking, or perhaps let sit for a couple of hours.  My mixture was very soft and the cookies did spread somewhat.  I'd prefer a "chunkier" cookie rather than a flatter one, so if I try this again I'll likely make the batter in advance and let it sit to allow the flour to absorb some of the moisture and/or chill it for a while to stiffen it somewhat.

I replaced the corn syrup with agave nectar, used spelt flour instead of wheat, and increased the chocolate chips to 2.5 cups. We loved them! Would have liked to taste the peanut butter a bit more, but overall a great recipe that I will use again.

These are great. I read some of the reviews and modified the recipe a little.. I used 3/4C of Peanut Butter instead of 1/2C.. 1T of corn syrup and 2 1/4C flour.  I made small cookies with one of my small ice cream scoops (I think melon baller size?) and baked them about 9 minutes.. I am learning not to overbake cookies to keep them from hardening the next day and these are still soft and chewy.. So good!!

The best peanutbutter choc chip cookies I've ever had.  Super easy to make.  They stayed soft but didn't fall apart.  My husband begged me to make another batch the very next day and the kids gobbled them up.  A couple of the neighbors complained there wasn't enough.  I think I made about 36 medium sized cookies.   I eyeballed the chips adding only just over 1 cup.

This was quite good, though I wouldn't recommend them to someone who loves peanut butter - there's only a faint taste of it. Also there are too many chocolate chips; the cookies barely held together. 1 1/2 cups would be plenty - and this is coming from someone who loves chocolate chips! Finally, I guess it depends on the oven, but for mine, leaving them in longer than 11 minutes meant the bottom was over-baked (though not quite burnt).

Very bad recipe.......used the 1/4 cup to scoop the dough onto the cookie sheet to bake.  First of all, using the 1/4 cup scoop method, only 12 to 15 cookies could be made, the recipe says 24.  The cookies were burnt on the bottom and raw in the middle.

These cookies are so delicious; my co-workers could not stop eating them. I skipped out on the corn syrup, reduced the flour to about 2 1/4 cups, added peanut butter chips, and refrigerated them overnight to get them firmer so they wouldn't spread so much on the pan.

Not a recipe I want to use if I'm looking for that real hit of peanut butter taste.  Nor were they chewy--more like a cake.  The baking time also seems to be off - at 12 minutes my cookies were burned on the bottom.  Try 9 or 10 instead for light golden brown edges.

tips to try:

Mix in milk chocolate with the semi-sweet, and

for a chewier cookie, add a few tablespoons more of peanut butter and only 2 cups flour, bake at 350 for approx 15 mins.

If you like peanut butter and chocolate, you need to try this! It's an easy recipe if you want to try something a little different than regular chocolate chip cookies. I liked this recipe, the cookies came out very chewy but I took them out before they were fully cooked because I didn't want to have them too dry. I didn't have enough chocolate chips, so instead of all chocolate chips about a quarter of the chocolates were the Wilton's candy melts in light cocoa. I think this was a great idea because the chocolate melted inside the cookie and even after cooling they were still gooey when you bit into it! You should try this if you like a gooey consistency in your cookies! Yummy!

A hint of peanut butter, but not too overwhelming.  Use cookie scoop and cook for 10 minutes~ cookies will look a little under done.  Let them sit on cookie sheet for 1-2 minutes then move to wire cooling rack.

made just as instructed. The cookies were light on peanut butter taste and were too crispy. As noted by others, if you like peanut butter you should add more and reduce the baking time and or reduce the temperature. I also believe the cookies would serve well if you keep the dough cold (in the fridge) until ready to use.  With that said, the milk container is now empty and the cookies nearly gone - love my teen boys.

My boyfriend and friends loved these. I didn't have eggs so substituted a flaxseed/water mixture instead (1 TB flaxseed and 3 TB water per egg) and instead of white sugar I used agave nectar and substituted honey for the corn syrup. Turned out great! Moist and delicious.

These cookies are perfectly chewy and taste even better if you switch the regular butter out for "Bud Butter", if you know what I mean... Righteous baking everyone :)

These cookies are amazing!
I substituted the corn syrup for honey, and use a few less chocolate chips, and I LOVE them!
It is about the 6th time I have made these and thought I must review them.

Great recipe but did follow the advice of some reviews and made a few changes. Cut flour to 2 cups and increased peanut butter to 1 cup. Used all brown sugar and whole wheat flour. Baked 9 minutes. Cookies were soft, chewy and delicious!!

Delicious, chewy cookies, just like the other reviewers claimed!  Sad thing was, I think 375 degrees was a tad too hot for the fat content and the bottoms of the cookies got really dark - almost burnt!  I also made smaller cookies, about 1 1/2 inches in diameter, and cooked them for 8 minutes maximum.  Next time I'll reduce it to 360 or 365 degrees F.  Otherwise, no complaints.  This recipe is a keeper!!!

Absoultly Amazing! Like others have said, I used an ice cream scoop to drop them and they only took approx. 9 minutes to bake. I'd make these again in a heartbeat!!

so chewy and soft. it's not too sweet, it's not too bland. i actually used 1 tablespoon of maple syrup because I didn't have corn syrup and it still turned out really well. I will def use this recipe again!

I doubles the peanut butter and omitted the corn syrup- if you use spoonfuls to bake you may want to flatten them a bit otherwise they will come out shaped like balls!

I've been looking for a new chocolate chip cookie recipe and I'm so pleased I found this one. I've been using a basic recipe for years, but really wanted something soft and chewy. This one is soft and the cookies come out like " Bake Shop" cookies. My family loves them I plan on making variations of this recipe with peanut butter or butterscotch chips. Thanks so much for sharing this Excellent recipe...It's a winner!!

Needs more peanut butter!! The pb flavor didn't come through very well with only 1/2 cup. Five stars if not for that! The cookies are wonderfully soft and chewy!

Best cookies i have ever made. And my c.c. cookies are known as "crack chocolate chip cookies". I went pursuing for a peanut c.c. cookie for my niece as she returns to college. I read the reviews on this one and just doubled up the recipe (she has a roommate after all). Came out wonderfully. Don't change a thing. This is truly a great recipe.

Great recipe.  My four year old loved making them with me and loved eating them even more.  The only thing I did differently was use honey instead of cron syrup since we didn't have any on hand and they still turned out great.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I made these cookies last night to give to a family member who just had a baby(she loves all things chocolate and peanut butter) THEY WERE A HIT! Her husband washed down at least 5 while we were visiting, along with 2 glasses of milk!  I followed the recipe exactly and was proud of my results. Soft and chewy cookies with the perfect chocolate/peanut butter blend. The recipe made about 4 dozen cookies, so I had more to share with others. My boyfriend had some today and said they were much better today than they were yesterday. :) Great cookie! Thank you for the recipe! It will be added to my favorites!

Loved these cookies!! I made these cookies one evening when my husband and I had a sweet tooth. They are AMAZING!! So soft and chewy!! They stay that way for at least 3 days, don't know if they stay soft longer because we had eaten them all before we could find out. Makes a large batch of cookies. They truely are addicting, its hard to eat just one! Made the recipe just as listed and was perfect!

Great Cookies, Very easy to make. Im 14 and my family loved them. i didn't add chocolate chips in a few of the cookies because my sister does not like them, even with out them they were delicious ! Definitely  adding them in my recipe box ! :) My only complaint was that some of the cookies burned on the bottom, but that could be because i overloaded the oven. tip Put them on the top shelf of your oven for just 12 mins !

These cookies are chewy and make a good chocolate chip cookie, but I can't really taste the peanut butter.  If you want a "peanut butter" cookie w/ chocolate chips in it, this is probably not the recipe for you.  Needs more peanut butter or less chocolate chips.

Pretty good recipe. I doubled the peanut butter and reduced the white sugar to 1/4 cup. I also did spoonfull scoops rather than the larger ones called for in the recipe. Baked for 11 minutes and came out perfect, lightly golden, but soft and chewy.

Very good. Made 'as is' and the whole family loved them. And, the hubby, who normally does not eat cookies, could not keep from eating the batter and cookies. That is saying a lot.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  Definitely a hit for my recipe box. If you don't want the cookies too big, I'd recommend using something smaller than the 1/4 scoop recommended but since I made these for my husband's work crew, they were a perfect size.
I also used butter flavored shortening and it worked just fine.

Very good.  I'm not a huge cookie maker but i found the dough's creamy texture very easy to work with.  I'll be adding this to my recipe box.  I used shortening and i frozen chocolate bunny i had in the freezer.  Very yummy.

This recipe was good, but I only gave it 3 stars, because I thought it could use more peanut butter flavor.

I made these a few weeks ago for gifts to give away to people. I also made 3 other cookies and while I got lots of positive feedback on the other cookies, these didn't really shine. I thought they were good, just not great. I used the additional 1/4 cup of pnut butter and used crunchy pnut butter which i think added a lot to the cookies because you could taste the little peanuts. They were chewy but it just feels like something is missing. Just not a fantastic cookie in my opinion. I wont make these again. When I put in work for a recipe, I want it to have a wow factor and these just didnt make the cut. :)

These cookies turned out very delicious and everyone loved them! I did replace the corn syrup with honey as that is what I hand on hand and cream instead of the milk. 
Thank you to the poster for such a wonderful recipe that will become a staple for me :)

DELICIOUS! These cookies turned out AMAZING! I omitted the con syrup all together, no substitution. I also made spoon drop size and baked for 9 min. Bring this recipe when you bring the cookies.... others will want it.

I make few changes to this recipe: double the recipe because they will go fast, cut the total sugar back to 2 cups of sugar (I use all white sugar, then add about a tablespoon or 2 of black strap molasses, add an extra egg, substituted about half of the chocolate chips for peanut m&ms (the dark chocolate kind). mmmm

I used my cookie scoop instead of making them so huge, and I cooked them for 9 minutes! 

They are KILLER!

These are fantastic! All I did was slightly decrease the amount of sugar I put in (left out white sugar all together and just used one whole cup of packed brown sugar) and they turned out divine! Everyone loved them, I had to make a second batch today. Simply yum.

BEST MONSTER COOKIES.  Very soft and chewy.  I've made several batches according to directions but instead of choc chips only, I add 1/2 cup choc chips, 1/2 cup peanut butter chips, 1/2 cup Reeses pieces, and 1/2 cup plain M&M's.   I also use a 2TBSP. scoop and they are the perfect size.  If I'm volunteering for a bake sale, I'll use the 4TBSP scoop and double the recipe!

Quite easily THE BEST cookie recipe EVER!!! I add extra peanut butter and roll in sugar before baking.  Without fail, they turn out perfectly!  You can't mess up this one.
Not only are they delicious but they look absolutely amazing--like a picture!  
The best part is, they stay moist and chewy for alot longer than other cookie recipes!
Thank you for a great cookie!

This recipe is one of the very best!!! I have made almost every chocolate chip peanut butter cookie recipe on this site. This one is perfect just the way it is. My husband is a chocolate and peanut butter fanatic.  These cookies touched his heart and soul.

Well, I followed the recipe exactly as it was given and the dough is great. My son wouldn't leave it alone. The cookies bake up beautifully and they taste ok. My husband tried one and couldn't believe there was peanut butter in them. You don't really taste it. I know people suggested changes, but I wanted to try it as it was given. I would maybe look for a recipe with more peanut butter in it or adjust this one.

These coookies are awesome.   I did not have unsalted butter so I omitted the salt and I did not have vanilla extract so I used rum instead.  They turned up absolutely wonderful.  Chewy and soft. Will defintely make these again.

Most good-looking cookies I've ever made. And perhaps the most delicious, too.

I used unsalted almond butter instead of peanut butter, which is very very subtle, but adds to the "heartiness" of the cookies.

I also used 1 T molasses in place of 1 T of corn syrup, dark (because I grabbed the wrong bottle) and it was perfect. 

I baked for 6 minutes, rotated, 6 minutes. Perfect.

I will definitely makes these again --

Good but not peanut buttery enough. I think I would add more peanut butter but not sure how that would affect the recipe. Also I didn't add all 2 tsp of vanilla because I thought that was too much but it definitely needs it. Baked them at 350 for 10 minutes.

Delicious. Only thing is they aren't very chewy, more soft and slightly chewy. Other than that, they are a hit.

Great recipe!  I tweaked it for more flavor and less sweet:  1) increased peanut butter to 1 cup, 2) omitted white sugar, 3) omitted water, 4) didn't have corn syrup...took other reader's advice and substituted honey.  The cookies maintained their  chewy texture.  Will definitely make these often.

It didn't turn out at all how we wanted them too. We were going for chewy, and they were hard and crumbly. Still trying to go for that perfect cookie, but not this one.

I am rating this 4 stars, not because it's a bad cookie, but because this recipe, on its own is nothing special. I made the recipe verbatim, and they were only so-so. After tweaking it a bit, it turned out amazing!

Instead of just two cups of chocolate chips, I added 1 1/2 chocolate chunks and 1/12 cups of peanut butter chips. Let me tell you, my husband wouldn't stop eating them! They turned out amazing. I highly recommend this change if you really want an extra peanut buttery cookie!

Thanks!

I have made these cookies a few times now and everyone has really liked them.  I wanted more peanut butter flavor.  I added about 3/4 cup peanut butter chips and about 1 and 1/2 cups of chocolate chips.  We liked them even better.

I can't fault the recipe, because I followed it exactly (with the exception of using chips instead of chopped chocolate but I wouldn't think that should affect the taste) and the cookies turned out fine. It's just that when I hear the word "chewy" I'm thinking more of your typical moist, dense, traditional chocolate chip cooke texture, and the most accurate word for these, I think, is "fluffy".  Which just isn't how I prefer my cookies.  Also, I'm baking in a gas oven and 10-12 minutes was far too long for this recipe. For my second batch I just did about 9 and they weren't as dark and dry.

I was excited to try these, good reviews and all, but while they were good, they were not GREAT. Quite ordinary. Not very peanut buttery tasting. Still searching for the perfect peanut butter cookie recipe...

I made a double batch of these for my son's varsity baseball team.  Gone in 10 minutes.  Actually, they devoured them.  Luckily, I had saved a few for my DH who said they were the best peanut butter chocolate chip cookies he has ever had!  The boys just gave me smiles! (with their mouths full!!)

My husband loves peanut butter cookies and has fond memories of making and eating them. He loved these cookies. I did make a few changes. I lowered the amount of chocolate chips to 1 cup and found that to be more than enough. I also added a little extra vanilla and kept out the water. Like other I made them into spoonfuls and cooked them for 9-10 minutes. Yummy...definitely a keeper.

I must say.... YES! I hardly ever am this happy with homemade cookies, but I must say these were something... they're beautiful, easily made, they don't spread obscenely, they have peanut butter and chocolate! OH MY! I replaced the honey with maple syrup because I had no honey... I used TBSs of batter and it was perfect.... cam out to a little over 32 cookies that size! you will be pleased!

Awesome cookies. I've been searching for a PB cookie that was not the traditional crumbly kind. This is it!! 
I've made them several times now and every one loves them.
I add Reese's pieces minis and PB&chocolate chips to make them even more addictive. 
I use a floured tablespoon measure to make perfect sized cookies every time.

Great texture/moistness.  Chocolate overpowered the peanut butter, though...next time I'll reduce the chocolate and they'll be awesome.

Great cookie:  I made them smaller than directed, just cooked them a bit less.  Rave reviews from all who tried them.  They have a nice chewy quality, I just wish the peanut butter flavor was stronger.  I gave it 4/5 for this reason.  It's just a personal preference.

I've been making these for years, they are always excellent - salty, sweet, nutty, chocolatey! Our favorite is to use crunchy peanut butter & a mix of dark & milk choc.

These were really good!  The only thing that I had a problem with was the chocolate chips!  They were so strong that I couldn't taste hardly any peanut butter, and that's my favorite part!  I also used chunky peanut butter and it was really nice to have those bits of peanut!  Next time I'm trying milk chocolate chips, or maybe no chips at all!

I made this with "green" butter.  Usually that make things taste weird.  I think the pb masks that completely. Tastes like a great, non psycho-active, cookie.  I'm renaming this "the sneaky green".

THESE...ARE...AWESOME
Very chewy and chocolatey. I'm sure I added way more chocolate chips then the recipe calls for. TIP: Add both milk chocolate/white chocolate chips for a taste out of this woorrlldd! They're flying off the counter as we speak =) A keeper for sure!

Excellent recipe. I used whole wheat flour to no ill effect (I always do this when baking and have never had problems). I also used just two cups of flour instead of the recommended 2 1/2, and only half a cup of (white) sugar, with no brown. I added two tablespoons of molasses and left out the corn syrup and the vanilla. Also, I don't know what kind of peanut butter the original poster used, but I used one made only from peanuts and salt. Results are extremely tasty. I'll definitely be making these again!

GREAT cookies! I didn't have any choco chips, so I threw in 1/2 cup of baking cocoa, and it turned out superb. They aren't as sweet without the choco chips, but we didn't care. They were super moist and dissipated quickly :)

These cookies hit the spot!  I didn't have corn syrup, so I used honey.  Also, I had some white chocolate chips, so I threw those in there.  When my daughter took the first bite, she said "These are perfect" =)

These were really good. My son loved them because they were so "soft and good". I almost doubled the amount of peanut butter and used my small cookie scoop, baked for 9 to 10 minutes.  I will make these again for sure.

I made these cookies based on the other rave reviews and made them gluten free! They worked wonderfully! I cut down the butter and increased the peanut butter, also used natural peanut butter. I cut the flour down as well as I always find gluten free to be heavier as it is, and so are most peanut butter cookies! I also substituted agave nectar in place of corn syrup and they still turned out awesome!!! Very happy with them, gluten free can be tricky, but these cookies passed the test!

I made these exactly as the receipe was writtin and they were perfect. They are so soft & light. I just used the mini chocolate chips because they tend to stay soft instead of bigger ones that get hard after the cookies cool. I love the recipe & I will definatley make these cookies again! Thanks :)

These are so good! Make sure to make your drops small though. I went a little wild and the bigger cookies weren't as good as the smaller cookies. Great recipe!

I really like this recipe, however, I give it 4 stars because I think the title is incorrect. As many posters have stated they lack a strong taste of peanut butter. I was actually going to make them as many have suggested using 1 cup of peanut butter, but I only had a 1/2 cup on hand, so I made them exactly as the recipe is written.  If they were titled Chocolate Chip Cookies then they would have 5 stars, as I think the hint of peanut butter makes them a nice twist on a chocolate chip cookie recipe. I will probably use this recipe every time now when I want chocolate chip cookies!  Thanks!

OMG! These cookies are excellent! I didn't have chocolate chips, nor did I have corn syrup, so I didnt use those 2 ingredients. I baked them on 350 instead of 375 and baked some at 12 minutes which were chewy and moist and those baked on 14 minutes were still moist but a bit crispier. Enjoy!

These were great!  I used 1 cup of natural peanut butter and 1 bag of mixed chocolate/peanut butter chips, but followed the rest of the recipe as is.  Definitely moist and chewy, with a subtle peanut butter flavor!  These will be a repeat, and I may add them to my holiday cookie list, too.

I have been using this website for years for my cooking and baking, this is the first time I have tried a 5 star recipe and been so severely disappointed. The name is certainly deceiving as these are fluffy and puck like rather than chewy. There is not nearly enough peanut butter taste, or any taste at all. I followed the recipe exactly and after the first batch came out burnt on the bottom and not chewy at all, I tweaked the cooking time and the size of the cookies for the following two batches. Still the outcome was unimpressive. When baking cookies I always set aside a dozen or so to give to friends so they can share in the yumminess!

These were a good cookie. I used cashew butter instead of peanut butter. I also increased it to one cup but should have used the entire jar. I decreased the chocolate chips and will used smaller ones next time. I also made them by the teaspoon and baked for 7-8 minutes. It was a good batter to work with. I will bake these again and may use actual cashews in them. As others stated, the taste is not overwhelming.

These were very good, you cant taste the peanut butter at all ! But they were chewy. I didt have light corn sypup so I made my own. Here is the recipe:2 cups white sugar 3/4 cup water 1/4 tsp cream of tartar dash of salt. combine all ingredients in a heavy large pan. Sir and bring to a boil.Reduce heat to a simmer and put cover on it for 3 mins to get sugar cystals off the sides of the pan. Uncover and cook until it reaches soft ball stage. stir often.Cool syrup and store in a covered container at room temperture. It will keep for about 2 months. Makes almost  2 cups.

This is a great recipe.  You can also replace the chocolate chips with 3/4 cup unsalted dry roasted peanuts, crushed and 1 1/4 cup peanut butter chips for a crunchier peanut flavor, or simply replace the chocolate chips with peanut butter chips for a richer, peanut butter flavor.  While the chocolate chip recipe is good, the chocolate tends to drown out the peanut butter flavor.

I don't like peanut butter.  That being said, I made these for my hubby and some friends who do.  Used peanut butter chips instead of chocolate and these are to die for!  I ate three right out of the oven.  Had to make myself stop.  Really great soft cookie.  Completely taken with this recipe just as it is and I know I'll be making these again.

These are quite tasty.  I substituted honey for the corn syrup and butterscotch chips for the chocolate.  I dropped them by large spoonfuls on the cookie sheet.  After 12 minutes of baking my cookies were quite dark, and they did spread, so space them apart enough.  I reduced the baking time to 10 minutes on next batch and they came out great.  I ended up with about 40 cookies.

I make cookies pretty often, and everyone keeps telling me these are their favorite yet. I have to agree. The texture is incredible and the balance of peanut butter and chocolate is pretty much always a crowd pleaser. I made them a bit smaller in size than recommended, added a bit of cinnamon, and used mini chocolate chips but besides that I stuck to the recipe. Yum!

These cookies turned out perfectly.  The only thing I changed about the recipe was that I added an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter-1 cup in all.  I think it's important to follow the directions on how and when each ingredient should be mixed.  I followed according to the recipe and they turned out great.  Also, I have a gas oven and my cookies only took 8 minutes to cook, not the 12-14 min.  Next time I might even use more peanut butter, but these turned out nice and soft.  Thank you!

These are not good at all. Way too much flour and egg. They were more cake like than cookie like. Would not make again.

These were great and loved that even the next day they were still chewy. I did bake them slightly longer then it says, the dough seemed wetter then most cookie dough.

Really great cookie as the recipe is written. It is a very fluffy cookie but still manages to be chewy and the peanut butter flavor is there but not overwhelming. My family ate the whole batch same day, next time I will have to double! Thank you for the great recipe!

These cookies were amazing!  Soft and chewy and a definite hit with all my friends and family.  I put in 3/4 cup of peanut butter as opposed to half and omitted the chocolate chips.  I will definitely make these again!

Meh. A peanut butter cookie ought to taste of peanut butter, no? These didn't have much of anything really going for them. They kind of failed as peanut butter cookies and simultaneously kind of failed as chocolate chip cookies.

these cookies were good, peanut buttery in a subtle way; I think the chocolate chunks distract from the peanut butter flavor.  Mine spread out though, unlike what everyone else is saying-and yes, they were chewy!

I was so excited to try these, but was sadly a little disappointed.  They weren't bad...they just weren't great.  More peanut butter is definitely needed.  They were quite cakey.  They could have used less flour.

Just made these cookies today and followed recipe exactly. I have to agree with the person that stated they are like a flour biscuit with chocolate chips added. No flavor other than the chocolate chips. Won't try them again.

...and some people don't know how to read and interpret a review. A rating of 3 stars is, logically, median (a.k.a. "okay"). These same people have very poor grammar skills. His punctuation is also subpar. :P The cookies taste great if you like a sweet rather than intense peanut butter flavor. I agree with other reviews that say the cookies are larger than average. I dropped the dough by spoonfuls and reduced baking time. Good recipe.

I liked the texture and the way these cookies baked up to a nice size without flattening, but I really couldn't taste the peanut butter, so I think next time I would add more.

These cookies were truly amazingg!. Although If I had not followed direction from the comment before telling people to add more peanut butter aand cut back on the flour, I'm not sure they would have turned out all that great. Another trick I used was to substitute half of the chocolate chips with Hershey's Reese peanut butter chips. doing so made the whole cookie turn out better,. they were a huge hit with my husband& everyone else who tried them :)  so thats why I only rated this cookie a 2. you shouldn't have to change the recipe if they are as good as everyone says they are.

These are the best cookies!  They are so soft and chewy.  I might try putting a little more peanut butter next time, but they already taste good the way they are.

I should have read the reviews before baking these cookies.  They were not what I hoped for.  The chocolate chips take away from the peanut butter flavor.  I also should have cut down on the flour because they looked and felt like biscuits.  I would recommend changes but there are so many other good peanut butter cookie recipes out there that I just didn't want to take the time to do so.

Very chewy and yummy. Good balance of peanut butter to chocolate flavors in my opinion. I was intimidated by the huge cookies, so I made with a cookie scoop, baking 9-10 minutes. I would like to try the 1/4 scoop next time.

Easy to roll without sticky mess. Used honey instead of corn syrup and left out the water. Didn´t need to chill the dough and the cookies held its shape pretty well in the oven. In fact, I even had to flatten the rolled balls a bit in the last batch.

I made these for co-workers yesterday and although they WERE chewy and they WERE a pretty good chocolate chip cookie, the peanut butter was hardly noticeable. It was present, but not what I expected. They were a hit, but next time I'll either increase the PB or omit it altogether for a nice and chewy CCC.

The kids like the cookies, but these didn't turn out like I was expecting. I followed the recipe and the taste was okay, but not very flavorful.  The texture was hard on the outside and sort of soft on the inside. I prefer the Crisco peanut butter cookie recipe. It has much more flavor.

This is truly an amazing cookie. I started baking about a year ago and pretty much everything I have tried since then fails the first time I make it. But this recipe was the first to work for me on the first try! (I even left out the corn syrup because I didn't have any at hand. xD) It's unbelievable. Mine turned out to be peanut buttery and chocolaty - a wonderfully chewy cookie that amazed everyone who tried it! :) I think even without the chocolate, this would be an amazing peanut butter cookie. Yay! :D

There are lots of rave reviews for these cookies but I don't get it. They're OK. Had company staying with us this weekend and still have a plate full of cookies. Made slight modifications based on others suggestions - doubled the peanut butter and reduced flour to 2 cups. Seem to be lacking something, didn't have that WOW factor for me. They weren't very chewy, a little, but more of a dense cake with a little chew. I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

These cookies were great. My husband and my dad gave them a rating of 4 and my little sister gave them a rating of 4.5 because she likes how nice and soft and chewy they are.

pretty darn delish! I cut the recipie in half and dropped from a tablespoon and it made like 30 cookies almost. instead of choco chips i put in one broken butterfinger. yum! take out before the edges get tan for chewy cookies. press down and sprinkle with sugar. I you put the dough on a still warm pan they will cook faster, be patient.

Not very peanut buttery, but pleasant tasting. Next time I will either make chocolate chip cookies or peanut butter cookies. I didn't make them large as suggested by recipe, but rather a normal cookie size. Disappointed.

Yummy....I made 2 batches of these cookies.  The only change I made was to add some M&M's to the second batch, I still added all the chocolate chunks also.  I also made the cookies in my second batch a little smaller.  The first batch I got 18 extra large cookies.  The second batch I got 24 large cookies.  I had 2 baking sheets, lined with parchment paper.  I only put 6 cookies on each baking sheet.  As one pan came out the other went in.  I baked the cookies for about 13 minutes, till golden.  They turned out great.  Another great cookie recipe that not only looks but tastes professional.  Thank You for this wonderful recipe. Also, Thanks for the idea of adding the M&M's, it makes them very festive.

I am really disappointed in this recipe! I did as others suggested and added 1 cup peanut butter and reduced flour to 2 cups. The cookies were not chewy or moist at all! I will not make this recipe again.

Wow these are delicious cookies. I followed the original recipie using Jif brand peanut butter with honey and omitting the small amount of water. Since I do not have the patience for drop cookies, I pressed the entire batch of dough into my jelly roll pan and made bar cookies. Very tasty peanut butter flavor enhanced by gobs of chocolate chip. Soft and gooey, too, just the way I like a cookie. It was difficult not to eat more than two while cutting and storing them! I will be making this recipie again and again.

I also added more peanut butter (a little less than a cup)and decreased the flour (2 cups) based on previous reviews, and I added orange food coloring to make them festive (Halloween).  12 minutes is way too long unless you make large cookies.  This made a dozen small cookies and 15 large cookies.

To the person who gave this recipe 3 stars and said they were just "ok" is completely wrong. They are amazing! Also one review said to use 1/2 to 1 cup of flour but you need to use at least 2 cups of flour or this recipe is not the same and the cookies run all over. These cookies were gone in a day and my family already wants more!

I added these in a chocolate cupcake and substituted the corn syrup with honey. This didn't turn out too well. The cookie is delicious on its own without the cupcake though.

I agree with most of the other posters that these cookies were NOT soft and moist but more on the harder/crisper side.  Fresh out of the oven they were ok, but for the calories/etc. I would add more peanut butter to get that extra taste.  I stored them in an airtight container and they were already hard the next day.  Trying another recipe from this site today and seeing if that works better!

I receive so many compliments on these cookies! They are great.  I don't know if it's the corn syrup or the hint of peanut butter taste or what but people beg me to make these over regular chocolate chip cookies.

these were pretty tasty- I used extra crunchy peanut butter and dark chocolate chips and they were  a hit. I found them a little on the greasy side and they cooked slightly faster for me (around 9 minutes). But overall good!

These cookies were good, but I couldn't taste the peanut butter.  Next time I think I'll put in either a cup of peanut butter or a cup of peanut butter chips to enhance the flavor.  Overall they were good though.

I am not a big cookie fan but I was looking for something to make with my 2 nephews when I can across this recipe. I am soooooo glad I did, the cookies turned out great. I changed a little of the recipe so I did not make the original, but I think they turned out great! I already ate 5! Not a good recipe if you are watching what you eat. I used 3/4 cup of crunchy peanut butter and instead of 2 cups of chocolate chips I added 1 cup of chocolate chip and 1 cup of peanut butter chips! Next time I will use less sugar as they are very sweet cookies. I will definitely make this again...only when there are more kids around to eat them!

These cookies are awesome!  After trying MANY different recipes over the years, this is a for sure winner to go into my recipe box.  Despite what I read from another reviewer, they DO taste plenty peanut buttery.  I believe that perhaps the person who complained about this recipe must have not done it right.  Try these cookies!!!

I followed the recipe exactly as written and they turned out exactly like the poster said they would!  They are chewy and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not spread out while baking. These are really good - nice strong peanut butter flavor - and super easy too.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is going in my cookie recipe box. These remind me of those cookies you buy in the little packages of two. Yum! I did not use the chocolate chips because I figured they would be sweet enough without. I was glad that I didn't, I think the chocolate would have been just too much. Also please check your cookies at around 8 or 9 minutes, leaving them in for 10 or more just seems to be too much. This recipe makes an awesome cookie tho!! :-)

These cookies were good but not good enough to be “addicting”! Something was just a little off. I would still make them again but maybe modify the ingredients like someone else suggested.

I doubled this recipe and dropped the cookies by spoonfuls. I baked some of the dough and froze the rest. A few weeks later, I let the dough thaw and baked it, and it was just as good. A great recipe!

I made this recipe as written.  The cookie is more cake like and not the texture of a peanut butter cookie. I also, as another reviewer stated, did not taste the peanut butter very much.  It's a good cookie, but not a great one.  It's far closer to a cake like chocolate chip cookie.

I made this as both Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip and regular Chocolate chip by swapping the peanut butter for shortening. Everyone at my office wants the recipe and said they were the best they have had.  Great flavor and chewiness.

Truly the BEST peanut butter cookie ever. I am not a peanut butter cookie fan.  Usually too crunchy and too much peanut butter.  However, this cookie is just right. Soft, chewy, and just the right amount of peanut flavor.

I just made these the other day- hubby loved them, I hated them.  I made them exactly as called for, and they were NOT chewy or sweet!  The title of these should include the words "dense and cakey".  If you are like me and prefer the taste of a sweet, sugary flake to your cookies- skip this recipe.

These turned out cake like and really NOT what I was looking for. I made a few adjustments so that was part of the problem. I reduced the sugar to half and used all natural peanut butter so it was way too much flour. I added a bit of milk to thin it out, but it turned out disastrous!

These are pretty good... not super great, but pretty good. I followed the ingredients and instructions to the tee, and they are definitely "cakey" cookies, and we could barely taste the peanut butter.

This is a great recipe, however not enough peanut butter taste for me. After some experimentation, I have changed the Peanut Butter measurement to 1 cup. I have not changed any other ingridents. Turns out chewy and great.

I've made these twice so far- I love them! They're tasty, but if you live at a higher altitude, make sure to take that into consideration. They'll be really flat if you don't follow some high altitude baking instructions.

These were just OK, probably won't make again.  If I do, I will cut down on the chocolate chips.  They over power the peanut butter flavor.

these cookies good.  I baked them expecting them to be chewy like just regular 3 ingredient pb cookies.  They were chewy, but the more time that passed after bake time, the more they were just soft cakey cookies than chewy.  Also, you could not taste the peanut butter as much as you would expect in a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie.  If I make these again, I will increase the peanut butter.  But still a good cookie, the kids ate them up!

I just made these cookies today and they were yummy to eat, they're already going fast! My fiance had this idea to use butterscotch chips so I used half of the recipe for butterscotch chips and other half I used chocolate chips. Also I didn't have any corn syrup to use so I used honey instead and it turned out to be a great substitute. Not only do they taste good but now I also have 2 dozen, 2 different types of chip cookies! Thanks for recipe!

These were good.  Next time I will definately double the peanut butter and half the chocolate chips.  The cookies I enjoyed the most were the very last batch I made because they had few chocolate chips.  Too much chocolate drowns out the peanut butter flavor.

These were fantastic. I added another 1/4 to 1/3 cup extra peanut butter, but that was the only change. I couldn't stop eating these. Oh, I also did milk chocolate chips as opposed to semi-sweet, but I always do milk chocolate chips in cookie recipes, personal preference. Try these, you won't be disappointed!

The search stops here - these are the BEST peanut butter choc chip cookies EVER.  Only change I make is adding an additional 1/4 to 1/3 cup of peanut butter.  Thanks for the perfect recipe :)

I would definitely recommend upping the peanut butter and adding a little extra flour. I also decreased the chocolate, and the cookies tasted great ! I only cooked them for 10 minutes and they were a little crispy, so be sure to watch them !

When putting these on the cookie sheet, I pressed them down, shaping the dough into perfect, little circles, making them a teensy bit thinner in the middle than on the edges. They cooked perfectly. I used Sugar in the Raw, Light Brown Sugar, unbleached flour, and all natural (organic) peanut butter but kept the amounts exactly as written. The next time I make these I will add a little honey (1/8th cup) to sweeten it up.

These cookies are almost perfect.  And that is what I look for in a cookie.  Personally I like the HINT of peanut butter flavor.  My variation was to add almond slivers and used mini morsels.  Unfortunately I also spooned out the batter rather than follow the directions.  And I wish I did because they came out so small.  That when the first batch was done my husband went half way threw the first dozen.  But next time I will know better.  My son ate and hummed with tasteful pleasure threw his three cookies.  He said that they are "the best cookies in the world!"
Point made.  And to add, I have also substituted the chocolate chips for peanut butter chips.  Which makes an amazing cookie as well.  This is the best cookie recipe.  My husband and son ate my first attempt at this recipe in three days.

I substituted peanut butter M&M's for the chocolate chips but other than that I followed the recipe. I ended up with cookies that were crisp on the edge and undercooked in the middle. I thought they lacked flavor and anyone else who tried them agreed quickly. Their exterior exceeded their taste. So although they turned out beautifully round and fat, they lacked the gusto I had expected.

omg delicious. 

i didnt end up using 2 cups of chips though.

it would have been too much.

i used Margarine rather than butter (i'm too cheap to buy butter) and i mixed it by hand with a spatula and it turned out so great.

amazing

After reading the other reviews, I doubled the peanut butter and kept the other ingredients the same.  The cookies were dry and tasteless.  Barely a hint of peanut butter...not sure why.  I will not make them again and feel I wasted my time.

These are getting a 5 because although I had to tweak it a little my boyfriend loved them.  He said they are the best cookies I've made to date and I bake ALOT.  After reading alot of the reviews and having a bunch of people say the same thing about them not having enough p-nut butter I increased that.  I used a cup of creamy p-nut butter and a 1/4 cup of crunchy.  I also used 1 cup of p-nut butter chips and 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I also only put mine in for 9 mins.  They were perfect!  Just enough p-nut butter taste.  Also, just the right texture or chewiness.  Thanx for the great recipe and thanx to all for the suggestions!  A definite keeper!!

unbelievably good cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly except used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour & 1 cup white flour.  THese are so moist and just addictive!!  I have had to force myself to keep out of the cookie jar all night(my kids would be furious if the cookies "disappeared")

Delicious, and perfectly moist and chewy! I halved the chocolate chips and there were still plenty. Not as peanut-buttery as they could have been.

The cookies were good.... BUT I will make some changes when I make them again.  The 2 Cups of chocolate chips was way too much.  I felt like it overpowered the peanut butter flavor.  I will probably add extra peanut butter next time.  In addition, I would change 2C of chocolate chips to 3/4C of peanut butter morsels & 3/4 C of Chocolate Chips.

These are super yummy! We added chocolate chunks as well as peanut butter chips and they are certainly peanut-buttery enough for our family. We also changed the size to a tablespoon and baked for 9 minutes

My family loves these cookies. I had a batch that came out flat due to my error, but they were still delicious. I have also used other recipes where the cookies are soft the day of baking, but became hard over time. These cookies do not do that. They maintain their softness and their flavor.

These were delicious! I agree with other reviewers in the peanut butter taste not being too apparent, but I somehow think it adds to the chewiness of these yummy cookies. I stuck exactly to the recipe except I made them about half the size stated (they are huge otherwise)and my oh my I had to stop myself at cookie #3. I accidentally baked them a minute or 2 longer than I should have, but it didn't have any effect on how they came out, 4 days later the few cookies I have left are still soft and chewy. Perfect for dunking in milk! This recipe is a keeper.

This was a good recipe. The cookie turned out crisp on the outside and soft and chewy in the center. The only thing I changed was cookie size. I did a heaping tablespoon and baked for 8 mins. Like others said, there wasn't a strong peanut butter taste, but I think it had enough to compliment the chocolate. Although I really liked the cookie, there was just something missing for me(not sure what). Good cookie, may make again, but will continue to look for better recipes.

Delicious!  Better the next day after they have sat a while.  Very moist and chewy.  I too made smaller cookies and doubled the recipe. It made about 7 dozen.  Huge hit at work.  Next time I might add chopped peanuts or use chunky peanut butter.

These were very good, and they stayed soft, which scored big points by my husband.  I think I might try a better peanut butter next time to give it more of a "peanuty" taste.

These cookies are okay, however, where's the peanut butter flavor? I followed the recipe perfectly and there is no peanut butter taste. My husband also thinks they are fine, but just normal chocolate chip cookies. If I make these again, I will use less chocolate chips and more peanut butter.

Really good cookies! I have 5 kids and we make cookies all the time. I mad this last night and my husband said they were his new favorite. 
I did add about 1/4-1/2 cup extra flour because the dough seemed thin to me. 
Turned out delicious!
Adding them to the Keeper Book!
Thanks!

These cookies are great, i love how soft they are! But, I don't think i would know they were peanut butter cookies if someone else had made them, I just don't taste it. Otherwise, a great chocolate chip cookie!

These didnt work for me.  As others suggested, I added about 1/4 more peanut butter to boost PB flavor.  But the first batch was dull- a little dry and not sweet.  So I mixed in some more sugar and melted butter, made another batch and they turned hard and not very flavorful.  Maybe too much butter.  And the chips fractured.  So I added some more salt and made the cookies super huge (others were regular size) and smashed them down and those were actually the best. Still, overall disappointing really.  This is partly my fault, I didnt technically follow the recipe, but the first batch was pretty close (only a little extra PB).  But I wont bother with this one again.

I decided to try a new chocolate chip cookie recipe, so I tried this one.  The reviews made it sound ok.  I tried them and I must say, I didn't really care for them.  I prefer the Award winning soft chocolate chip cookies or my own outrageous chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I'm sorry to have to rate this as average..but it really was to me. I've used dozens of choc. chip cookie recipes and this kinda just falls short. The peanut butter taste was too mellow for me. My husband did like these cookies very much, but not me.

Although these cookies were chewy as promised, they peanut buttery enough for me.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The reviews were so high that I thought I had found the perfect chewy peanut butter cookie. I was disappointed. The recipe calls for you to make gigantic cookies; I would highly recommend you downsize them! Not my favorite cookie recipe, but not horrible either.

This recipe was amazing! I am a college student and made these cookies for all the girls on my floor and they were a hit with everyone!!!

The only thing i changed was i used demera brown sugar and only one tablespoon of corn syrup (actually, it was called liquid glucose, but i figured it was close enough!!!) Also, i used chunky peanut butter and i thought it brought a nice texture to the cookies1

I will definitely be making these soon!!!

I gave up sweets for Lent so I didn't taste these and I am relying on my husband's palate.  I will say that they certainly looked wonderful - they didn't spread which was nice because I HATE a flat cookie.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup but I left everything else the same.  The dough was very nice to work with.  I used a cookie scoop and flattened the dough out a little bit because I also don't care for my cookies to be too tall.  My husband said that this was a good cookie with plenty of peanut butter flavor that is complemented by the chocolate.  I used 12oz chocolate chips instead of the chopped chocolate because that is what I had.  I will be making these again!

These were ok.  I added extra peanut butter after my first batch and that imroved the flavor.  I was just hoping for a soft cookie, but the "chewy" in the title is indeed literal.  They've got a more cake-like texture.  If you like that, then they're great.  If not, find a different recipe.  Still yummy though.

The recipe is quite good, though I used an entire cup of peanut butter because I read all the reviews that said that 1/2 cup wasn't quite enough to bring out the peanut butter flavour. Good!

This was an excellent recipe.  I made it for New Year's Eve this year and it was a great hit. Very chewy but I also changed the baking time to 10 minutes.

I took the advice of other reviewers, increased peanut butter to 1 cup, decreased flour to 2 cups, used Irish cream instead of water, honey instead of corn syrup, and used chocolate chips & reduced to 1 1/2 cups.  They are delicious and still chewy 2 days later(it's just my husband and me so it'll take us some time to finish them!).

I was looking for something to tie me over until I can get to a place that sells Uncle Eddie's Vegan Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies (The closest is an hour and a half away).  I'm not vegan or vegetarian so this recipe is fine in that aspect.  And the cookies are good.  They're just no substitute for what I'm craving.

GREAT RECIPIE!

I have to say I changed it up a bit.I used 11 oz bag of chocolate chips and that was more than enough choclate chips.The choclate chips didnt mix in very well so I couldnt imagine 16 oz (2 cups).Also I think this recipie would work easier if it was refrigerated.The dough was a little hard to mess with.I dropped them by spoon ful(streches better too)and baked for 9 minuets at 375.Also for a fancie look I drizzled melted choclate in a decorator bag over the top.YUM!

These went over very well!  "The best peanut butter chocolate chip cookie I ever had!"  I added an extra 1/2c of peanut butter, and I still think they could have been a little more flavorful.  Everyone else really dug them though.

These were okay. They weren't actually very sweet and you couldn't taste much peanut butter in the finished product. Others said their's spread a lot but mine hardly spread at all so they were lumpy/held the form that they were in when I dropped them on the sheet instead of getting nice and round like most cookies do. Also, the cookie was very cake-like and didn't have a very nice golden color on top like the picture shows. I only made about 16 of the cookies and decided to save the other half of the dough as is because the dough itself is delicious- sweet, slightly peanut-buttery, and chocolaty!

I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could.  These cookies had a nice flavor, but I was not overly impressed with them, and I have definitely tasted better.  The second time around I added 1 cup of quick oats in place of 1 cup of flour and this made the texture better.  I only cooked mine for 10 minutes - any longer than that and they ended up very crispy, not at all soft.  They do spread - they are not puffy cookies after they have cooled.  I may make this again, but I think I will probably keep looking for a softer peanut butter cookie.

wow, wow, wow!  These were so fabulous.  Just like Starbucks cookies.  I made some changes based on reviews and on what I was trying to simulate (the peanut butter cup cookies from the Barnes and Noble Starbucks).  I used 1/4 C butter and 1/4 C coconut oil instead of 1/2 C butter.  I cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 C total (next time I'll go down to 1 C).  I used honey instead of corn syrup.  I used about 3/4 C of peanut butter, and cut the flour down to 2C (I also used all whole wheat flour instead of white).  I used 1 C of semi-sweet choc chips and about 3/4 C of Reece's pueanut butter cup morsels (like tiny peanut butter cups).  These made big delicious cookies, I will deffinently make this again and might even freeze the cookies so I'm not tempted to buy Starbucks cookies next time we go there.

My friends and I made this recipe during the holidays; I didn't care for it. It says to drop quarter cupfuls for each cookie, but that makes for a VERY large cookie, so we made them a bit smaller. It was tasty, just not as delicious as I'd hoped.

This is a really great recipe, however I'm not giving it 5 stars simply because it's not peanut buttery at all. These are basicallly just chocolate chip cookies. Next time I will use peanut butter chips instead of chocolate.

This was a pretty good recipe.  I rolled dough into balls by the teaspoon size and then pulled them out and stuck a hershey kiss immediately on top.  They were good, but I wouldn't cook them as long.  When I pulled them out earlier they were so much better, but everyone's oven is different.  I thought it could have more peanut butter flavor, but all in all a really good cookie

Fun watching my boyfriend trying to make these :)  We also dropped smaller spoonfuls and baked for about 10 mins.  Ended up getting at least 3 and 1/2 dozen out of the batch.  Cookies are very chewy and rich!  We cooked them a little longer than the 9 mins suggested by other raters and they had a nice crispy exterior but still soft in the middle!

Everyone loved this recipe!!  I was hoping to take a photo to post, but they went so fast I wasn't able to.  Next time, I will have to bake these when no one is home and snap that shot.  I actually didn't change the recipe by much, I simply added more chocolate chips and vanilla.  This is a great recipe, a must try!!

Definitely needs the chocolate.  They are lacking in peanut butter flavor.  I will tweak when using this recipe again.  Thanks for your recipe.

Yummmmmmy! I made these while my boyfriend's friends were here watching a football game. There were no cookies left by the time I finished baking. The perfect amount of peanut butter and chocolate. This is a keeper!

These are the softest pb cookies ever!  The dough is almost fluffy!  My only suggestion would be to use more PB.  but all in all, excellent recipe.

I was a little disappointed.  The cookies turned out a little too sweet and not "peanut-buttery" enough.  Also, mine were more cake-like than chewy.

They tasted okay but definitely my type of cookie.  It was too cake-ish and I could hardly taste the peanut butter. Probably won't use it again.

These were delicous!  I baked them for about 11 minutes and they came out perfect.  They should be pretty soft when they come out of the oven...they'll set up and remain chewy that way.  I used miniature chocolate chips instead of regular ones because I like the texture better.  So good!  I will definitely make these again.

Seriously, these are the best cookies I've ever had.  I can't believe I baked them, normally everything I bake turns out horrible.  I followed the recipe exactly (aside from putting the baking soda in with the sugars and butter by accident) and they came out perfect.  I made them 2 nights ago and they are still moist and chewy today (so the person that said they were dry and crumbly the next day must have messed something up).  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you like chewy, soft cookies, these are for you!  I've been making these for years and always get rave reviews.  They never last too long in our house! I don't make any changes and they are perfect.

I'm actually a bit disappointed with these cookies.  I was excited to make them, after reading so many great reviews about them.  I agree that they were the best right out of the oven...because the next day they were dry and crumbly -- not soft and chewy!  I didn't bake them for the full time amount, either, because I love my cookies to be soft.  Did I make them wrong??  The cookie dough was awesome, just like the one reviewer said, but I have been disappointed with the result.  I was hoping to bring the cookies to a family gathering tomorrow, but I would be embarrassed to bring these cookies the way they are, all crumbly.  I know this review is a far cry from all the other raving reviews, but I can't say I would make these cookies again.  If you make them, eat them all right away!

Do you like peanut butter? Are you a chocolate chip cookie lover? Look no further for a yummy combination of the two. I used unsalted butter and milk chocolate chips. I baked them for about 11 minutes with great results. Everybody loved them.

These were great!  I don't understand why anyone would complain about these not being chewy, because they certainly are.  Only thing I would do is reduce the chocolate chips that it calls for, because the chocolate flavor overpowers the peanut butter flavor.  Otherwise, they were awesome and a huge hit in my household!

Good cookies, they taste great, but I'm giving them a 3 because they weren't very peanut-buttery, even though I doubled the peanut butter...hmmm...less flour next time?

I thought these were O.K. and the kids certainly weren't complaining. I initially balked at the idea of such large cookies and instead made rounded spoon sized cookies, but I found these them somewhat bland. I tried again using the larger size called for in the recipe. It definitely helped the peanut butter-chocolate chip flavor combination. I won't be in a big hurry to make these again. They weren't bad, I just prefer to have my peanut butter cookies peanut butter cookies and my chocholate ones cholate!

Definatly a five!! They looked absolutely PERFECT when they're done!! I thought there was a lot of chocolate chips, but when they were done, I thought those cookies looked even better!! I did not eat any, but my taste tester said the sides don't taste like peanut butter but the middles do. Oh well..he's bringing some for a party he's going to. 
Will for surely use again!! Thank you!! *ALSO:My dad loved them so much, it was the main course of his dinner!! The next day, it was his breakfast and part of his lunch. :]

I added 1/2 peanut butter and used 1 cup peanut butter chips and 1 cup choc. chips rather than all chocolate.  Turned out with a great chewy peanut butter taste.  Also didn't cook a minute longer than 10 min.

I am very impressed with this recipe. I made the cookies the other day and did not think they would be this good. I love chewy cookies and these live up to there name. The only thing I did different is use chocolate AND peanut butter chips. Like some others said they don't spread out much when baking.

not as chewy as i expected. i cooked them 10 mins on 325 and it made it a little better. i wouldn't put in as much chocolate chips b/c the middle doesn't seem to get done enough.

As written these cookies weren't chewy or peanut buttery.  After the first pan came out of the oven and I realized that, I mixed in an additional 1/2 cup of peanut butter and that did the trick.  I also baked for not a second longer that 10 minutes and that helped the texture.

Made these for Christmas...Very good, but didn't taste much of the peanut butter and I added as much as recipe called for.  You may want to add extra if you want the PB taste!

This cookie has a five star flavor, however I have to knock it down to four stars due to the baking time frame given.  Twelve minutes is too long, the whole first batch was overcooked.  I had to make more and bake for ten minutes, then we had a winner!  They make big, fluffy, chewy cookies that have a great taste--just keep an eye on them for overbaking!

My husband LOVES these cookies. I followed the recipe of the lady who added 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1/3 flour to the recipe, but the dough wasn't forming well, so I added 4 Tablespoons milk and baked them at 325 degrees until brown on the edges, and the cookies turned out famously.

These were o.k., but not enough peanut butter to taste.  The first bunch that I baked I threw away because they were overcooked.  I lowered the cooking time to 10 minutes and pressed the cookies into the cookie sheet so they wouldn't turn out so cake-like.

i'm not too sure about these. they definetely were chewy, i'm sure maybe its just something i did wrong, because they came out a bit tough, and the peanut butter taste was too mild, wasn't what i was looking for. it was a bit of a hassle to make.

very addictive cookies, not as chewy as I thought they would be, might   benifit from a shorter cooking time . The chocolate chip to cooki Ratio is just right to keep you coming back for "just one more."

What a great recipe.. Made them and hubby loved them. My family loves peanut butter, the peanut butter was not overwhelming for those of us who don't  care for it. I noted that cookies stayed soft and not hard like others after a few days.

Very good cookie.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except to flatten slightly, as previous reviewers suggested.  I forgot to do my second batch and the flattened ones were a much prettier golden color, and more evenly cooked too.  I used a Pampered Chef cookie dough scoop, as 1/4 cup seemed too big for me.  I got 3 1/2 dozen good sized cookies out of it

pretty darn good. i made half a batch with almonds and half with chocolate chips. Expected them to be more chewy, but they are delicious either way! Will put more peanut butter in next time as I didn't taste it as much.

my kids loved these.  usually we aren't a big fan of peanut butter, but after being given several jars something needed to be done with them.  Now we definetly have a better view on peanut butter cookies.  This recipe also makes great ice cream sandwiches

These turned out good for a craving by my husband. They are really rich, I found out that they come out better if you press them down like pancakes. Next time I will use less chocolate chips. Very yummy cookies.

I'm not a fan of peanut butter cookies myself, but I made these and took them to work and everyone raved about them. I used 1 1/2 c. of chocolate chips and a couple extra spoonfuls of peanut butter as other users suggested. Needless to say, they were devoured by everyone in the office. For that, I give this recipe 5 stars!

This is one of the best cookies recipes ever!  I used a convection oven and baked the cookies for 11 minutes so that they would be gooey in the middle.  AWESOME RECIPE!

I'm an avid baker, and I love both peanut butter and chocolate chips -- so I thought this recipe, with its high ratings, would be absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, I found them to be very middle of the road. I got about three dozen out of them, and they were fine, but nothing to really write home about. I do have to complement their fluffy texture, however. But baking them at 375 for 12 - 14 minutes is asking for a burned cookie!

I loved these cookies. They were really chewy and a big hit. However I found them a little too rich with all the chocolate chips, I used 1 1/2 cups instead and found them much better.

I have made these cookies a few times and have had great results each time.  I did modify the flour the 2 1/4 c like others suggested and they turned out wonderful each time.  Not too peanutty and not too chocolatee just great.

I am not sure if it was the peanut butter that I chose, or if it were the recipe.  The cookies did not turn out so well and the tast was too planned. Oh, they were not soft at all either. They also did not hold form, they ran when I put the scoops onto my cookie sheet.  Now for me, I was not too thrilled but for those of you that got it, yeah for you.  I now make my own peanut butter and I use the betty crocker PB Cookie recipe.  Soft & yummy cookies every time.  I love that Betty!

really good, though i agree with others that it could use more peanut butter flavor. also, since the recipe asked for such big cookies, it was hard to cook them enough on the inside but not too much on the outside. next time i'll make them smaller, but other than that, a big hit!

Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!!  These were wonderful cookies! Nice light peanut butter flavor, not too overwhelming. My friends who hate peanut butter even loved these! I didn't have vanilla, so i used 1 tsp. almond extract and 1 tsp. molasses instead... they came out great! Gone within a few hours. Thanks!

This recipe was very good and easy to make.  I took the advice of others and doubled the peanut butter because I like a strong peanut taste.  Wouldnt have been as good otherwise.  Its definitely something people should at least try if they like peanut butter and chocolate.

YUMMY! I made exactly according to recipe, using the 1/4 cup measurement and the 12 minute cooking time and these are amazing, big cookies.  Mine made 15 cookies. Not a big peanut butter taste, just enough to know it is there.

Awesome cookies!!  Very Chewy and very good!! The only thing I can suggest is to double the recipe because the cookies are gone so fast you're left wanting more!  Make sure you keep an eye on them in the oven because they quick very fast.

Fantastic cookies!  I doubled the recipe and dropped the batter by the tablespoon, winding up with around 65 cookies or so.  Changes I made: I omitted the chocolate chunks, reduced the flour by 1/2 cup, added 1/2 cup more peanut butter, and used skim milk in place of the water.  They still don't have a very strong peanut butter taste, but they are delicious.  They spread into thin, 3" circles that are soft and chewy with lightly crispy edges.  Highly recommended!

This recipe makes fabulous tasting cookies. I wound up a half-cup short on the brown sugar (which I replaced with white sugar), but they came out fine. I also used 600g (about 2.5 cups) of milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet chocolate. You might find the 1/4 cup drop size they indicate create more of a scone than a cookie, but they're soft and chewy in the middle. Yummy!

this recipe was horrible. the cookies were not all all chewy they were hard and burnt and i followed the direction exactly. I even used more brown sugar to make the cookies chewier, but they were like rocks. i will never ever make these ever again.

They were good cookies. I found the size hard to match with the time given to bake (although i do have a convection oven). Could have been more Peanut buttery ... i only used 1 cup choc. chips and my daughter helped make them... so that may be reason for lack of perfection. I will try them again however. Thanks for the recipe

Cookies were good, but not the best.  I found I had to flatten them out on the baking sheet, otherwise they were mounds.  I tried baking them at a bit lower temperature, as they seemed to bake fast.  Overall, not too bad.  I used crunchy pb too, it worked well.

This cookies were great !!!  I will definitly have them again.  I used chocolate chips instead of the chocolate chunks and they tasted really good.  The only thing I would change would be adding a little more peanut butter next time.  Thanks tons for the recipe.

The cookies were NOT chewy at all, and I followed the instruction to a "t".  Kind of bland.

These cookies were very good, solid and chunky. They are the closest I've come to creating upscale bakery-quality cookies. I made them for my mother's birthday. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this recipe with my 2 year old daughter and we loved them!  They were soo good and chewy!  It's a MUST make recipe.  I did find using a "Pampered Chef" measuring cup (round one that measures both liquid and solids) to measure the 1/4 of dough for each cookie very helpful,  they come out perfectly round!  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Wow!  I've been looking for a good chewy chocolate chip cookie recipe, and this is IT!  The peanut butter flavor is mild and the cookies are excellent.  These went fast!

This cookies are really good and easy.  (I have a tiny kitchen in Manhattan.)  I also made a couple of the changes suggested by some other raters - added 1 cup of pb and used a little less milk chocolate chips.  I like milk chocolate, but I would suggest melting them a little first.  They went over well at my job for snack day.

Recipe was very easy to make.  I baked them and sent them in Valentine care boxes.  They mailed very well and tasted good.  I doubled the recipe and it worked very nicely.

These cookies were great!! Almost a cake-like consistency, but not quite. I've never had a peanut butter cookie like that, but I'm glad I found this recipe!
They were a real winner over here :)
