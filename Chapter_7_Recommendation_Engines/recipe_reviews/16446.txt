I loved the marinade-however, I would not use skirt steak for this recipe.  Next time I make it, I will use T-bones or filets.

Thanks for posting this recipe, Deanna.  It was easy to follow and the garlic really does lift supermarket brand teriyaki marinades.  I followed the suggestion of others who were short on marinading time by nicking the meat before marinading - half an hour does the trick.

To life the marinade further, I added a dash of sherry and a teaspoon of brown sugar.  

By the way, grill some mushrooms in the extra marinade - they are delicious this way.

Very easy and good grilled on my George Foreman grill.  Only needed 1 cup of teriyaki sauce.

This has become a favorite marinade in our house - for steaks, chops, ribs, and chicken.  We use 1 cup teriyaki sauce, 1 cup soy sauce, 3 TBL red wine vinegar, a generous amount of granulated garlic and ground ginger (or crushed garlic and crushed ginger in jars).  It's a 5 star recipe with these simple changes.  Everyone asks for the recipe.

We didn't really care for this at all but ate it anyways (smothered in steak sauce) b/c I hate wasting steak! I should've known better...basically, the type of teriyaki sauce you buy determines the taste of the meat b/c the garlic didn't help much (and I added extra).  I used "Famous Daves Teriyaki Sauce" = I had never tried that brand before but I don't normally buy teriyaki sauce so I didn't know what's a good brand to use. Therefore, I'm giving this 3 stars because it's easy and quick and it's not ALL the recipe's fault. If anyone knows a better teriyaki sauce, I MAY try this again.

This was really easy to do.  The steak was good, but I don't see that the garlic added that much to the store bought teriyaki sauce.

Great recipe! I made this for my boyfriend on New Year's Eve and he loved it, too.  My grocery did not have skirt steaks, so I bought strip steak and cut it in half to get the desired thinness.  Easy enough to make again.

For best results, don't skimp on the teriyaki, use the full amount at least..make sure you marinate it long enough. Also GREAT on the BBQ!!

VERY easy to put together. I couldn't find the meat but after talking to the butcher whom cut got the meat for me and cut it up as well made my life even easier for this dish. I also found low sodium Teriaki sauce. It only came in a 10 ounce bottle so I just used that verses adding in the full 2 cups. One more thing that I did what to crush fresh garlic cloves into it. I used about 4 cloves. I love garlic so it really help to add to the flavor of this dish. I broiled it as it is too cold to use the barbq. VERY good and very easy to make. Thank you for sharing!

Used with the skirt steak and it came out great. If you can't find skirt steak use flank steak. Also I have added Italian dressing to the teriyaki marinade. This works great also

This is the way I make London broil on the charcoal grill during the summer months.  Only difference is that I leave it in the bag (turning every so often) for 2 days.  Making sure I have a cool spot on the grill, I sear the meat until there are some char spots on it, then move it over to the cool spot, cover the grill, let it cook to the desired doneness (medium rare for us) and then slice it into wafer thin slices against the grain of the meat, and ooooo-la-la! Leftovers make incredible salads and sandwiches.  Well, you already know that!Thanks for sharing your recipe and technique.  Al

Loved it! I never made skirt steak before, but this was so simple and delicious.  I used reduced sodium Kikkoman, 4 cloves of garlic and marinated it for about 10 hours in my foodsaver marinate container then broiled.  Made it for our steak loving company and there wasn't one bite left.  Served with homemade lo mein.  Will make all the time now!

I used a flank steak as I could not find skirt steak in local markets. Used Soy Vay Veri Veri Teriyaki Marinade and refrigerated the steak for 4-5 hours. As it was pouring rain outside, I opted to broil for 5 minutes each side. It was perfectly medium rare and tender when thinly sliced. And yummy! The only change I will make next time will be to marinate longer (over night) for a deeper flavor. Love that marinade!

Love the recipe, but missing something, in the oven what temperature setting and should I put it in the middle of the oven. (Sorry, but being new at cooking, I think all this info should be at hand for all recipes). TXS

Love the recipe, however I am also a lover of t-bone and Rib-eye I used the Rib-eye and had fantastic results.  Unless taking in large amounts of sodium once in a while is a problem enjoy it.

I did not have teriyaki sauce, I used 1 cup of Lawry's Sesame Ginger Marinade and 2 cloves garlic. My family was mixed on this. I think was texture of steak, first time we had skirt steak. Next time, we will try on sirloin maybe. Maybe put more garlic in to add more of a punch.

I thought it was good for a broil job. I'll have to try it on the grill. Another igredient that I added was some bar-b-que sauce in with the teriyaki sauce. It held on to the steak for a better glaze.

SOOOO GOOD and so easy.  But to marinate overnight would be too salty.

My son proclaimed "Mmmmmm, I have a new favorite food!"  That's saying something!  And, it was so easy and delicious.  Was great served with garlic mashed potatoes!
