These waffles aren't bad, they're just nothing special.  I added the vanilla as other reviewers suggested and they still tasted slightly bland.  Also, this is a dense waffle.  If you are looking for something light and fluffy, either keep looking or remember to separate your eggs, beat the egg whites and fold them into the batter.

This recipe freezes well, and can be doubled,tripled, etc.  to suit your needs. I made 80 waffles and froze them for later use. All you need to do then is pop them in the toaster. They are better than the one's at the store!

Very easy to make. Substituting whole wheat flour for half of the regular flour makes them heartier. I make several batches and freeze them for weekdays, since we're all on different schedules. Just pop them in the toaster for a quick hot breakfast.

Mmmmm!  These waffles are yummy!  I've actually made countless batches of this recipe's waffles before remembering to write a review.  Those who have rated this less than 4 stars have either expected more than plain old waffles, or aren't doing something right with the recipe.  Adding vanilla and/or cinnamon is a great idea, and depending on our mood, I do so, but without the additives, this doesn't serve me the right to score this recipe any less than what I have.  They're just great waffles!

We love  these waffles. On a Sunday I make triple the batch  of  waffles I put egg beater instead of eggs and a cup of ground  flex seeds .If I have blueberrys I sprinkle them over the waffle batter before I cook them. If there are any left I freeze them and they eat during the week. They are delicious and  very healthy.

I bulk made waffles last weekend so I had an idea of how the batter was supposed to look before I made it into actual waffles. I added 1/2 cup more flour and a touch of vanilla. I made no other changes. As a waffle, these are EXACTLY what I was hoping for in a waffle. These puffed up beautifully and were thick but also light and fluffy. I didn't have any issues with batter running off the sides of my waffle maker, which I REALLY appreciated. I made several batches of this particular recipe and I really don't have any complaints. I'll use this one again (with the added half cup of flour and teaspoon vanilla), once I run out of waffles in my freezer again. ;)

We throughoughly enjoyed this as a quick go to recipe. My husband was working late and the girls and I were looking for a fun, quick recipe and came across this one. It was VERY fast and I always have all the ingredients on hand. Everyone really liked them and even my picky 1 year old happily ate them. They were best eaten right away, nice and piping hot!

I thought I'd challenge my own tried and true recipe as it seemed similar to this one but was disappointed.  The changes are, I use the same flour, sugar, salt, but 2 Tablespoons of baking powder for the dry ingredients.  Then I beat 2 bananas to mash in another bowl(optional), 1/2 cup sour cream, the same 2 cups of milk and beat well.  Then I add the wet to the dry and beat just until incorporated ... do not over beat!!  I then gently stir in 1/4 cup butter.  I use this same batter to make pancakes.  The kids plop in their own favorite extras once the batter is poured on the griddle like chocolate chips, blueberries.  One of the big favorites is to chop apples and mix in a little brown sugar and cinnamon and then stir it gently into a cup with enough batter for a waffle before putting in the waffle iron.  Decadent!  What you will find is that this recipe doesn't sit in your stomach like a big dough ball but be prepared to eat more than your usual.  They are very light!

Very disappointing.  Too heavy and not crisp enough for us.  I'll go back to my old recipe.

This is a fine, but definitely ordinary, recipe.  I have always used the recipe from Joy of Cooking, because although it is a bit more work, the light texture and taste made it worth the effort.  I tried this recipe to see if I could save some effort.  The waffles were okay, but a bit heavy and rather ordinary.  As an aside, I was surprised by the controversy among raters over separating the eggs and whipping the whites, as recommended by Joy of Cooking.  I definitely have never noticed an "eggy" taste, nor does it make me gag, as another reviewer suggested.  Rather, it makes for very light, delicate waffles that are crusty on the outside and soft in the middle.  I also strongly recommend adding vanilla, cinnamon, walnuts, blueberries, etc., regardless of the recipe that you use.  One more suggestion for those who make their own yoghurt but have never found a good use for the leftover very healthful whey:  if you use yoghurt whey instead of part or all of the milk, the result is a waffle that is a little more crispy on the outside, along with a subtle, but interesting change in flavor.  It's also  good for you!  That whey also makes excellent pancakes.

Did you know that if you add 7-up instead of milk that your waffles will be much crispier.? This is a good recipe.

Tried recipe as written. Thought the waffles were ok, but nothing special.  I found the waffles much improved by separating the eggs. Blend the yolks into the batter, then whip the whites till stiff and fold into batter just before baking.

This is a very good recipe.  The only change I made was to add 1/2 tsp of vanilla and only because we love the flavor of vanilla.  They came out light and fluffy and very tasty.  I was a little surprised at some of the negative comments.  If you mix all of your dry ingredients and then mix all of your wet ingredients and then incorporate them together and make sure you cook the waffles in a good hot waffle maker, you should get beautiful, tasty waffles.  Much more fun that just buying a premade mix.

I think this recipe is very good.  When I remove the waffles from the waffle iron to serve, I toast the waffles slightly for crispiness.  Added blueberries, cinnamon or vanilla enhance the flavor.  I purchase my maple syrup from Vermont ..  Grade B.  This recipe is what I consider one of my favorite weekend "diner" breakfasts and always enjoyed with a good hot cup of coffee.

These are the best waffles ever. Its the only recipe I use now. Quick, easy and delicious.  I make them the healthiest I possibly can so I substitute whole wheat flour instead of white, Splenda instead of regular sugar, fat free milk, and apple sauce instead of oil.  THEN, I top them with whip cream and berries or banana slices :)

To improve on this recipe, seperate the eggs, beat the whites to stiff and fold into the batter just before baking. This improves the texture and makes them lighter.

These were delicious. I had fresh buttermilk on hand, so I substitued 1 cup of buttermilk for one of the cups of milk (used skim milk for the other cup) and also substitued 1 cup of white whole wheat flour for one of the cups of flour. My 4 year old says "these were the best waffles ever!" and my husband said they were excellent. I'm never buying bisquick again! :)

This was a super easy recipe.  I added 1/2 t of vanilla and a light pinch of ground clove to make the waffles taste more like my Grandma's to me.

Thank you very much for submitting this recipe.

I was looking for an easy recipe that would make a smaller amount.  I halved this and added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon as per other suggestions.  It made two perfect and one smaller waffle - just right for our family of 2.  Very easy and quick recipe for first-time waffler, they turned out great!

These waffles were very good. Definitely add 1 teaspoon of vanilla to your wet ingredients. I doubled the recipe which yielded 18 waffles and froze 13 for weekly breakfast. Next time, I may try added orange or almond extract instead of vanilla and see how that changes the flavor.

And they were Reeeaally *GOOD*!!! I cut the amount of ingredients in 1/2, and it still worked out *GREAT*!!! Best waffles I EVER tasted!!! Better then boxed ones FOR SURE :D!!!

*enjoy* 

God Bless ~Amy

PS: I used Skim Milk also and they were'nt to thin at all and I had NO flour to spare either!!!!

Made waffles with this recipe this morning.  Not crispy and way too spongy.  This one that we tried earlier is better http://allrecipes.com/recipe/waffles-i/

I picked this recipe since is was light on the oil.  I wouldn't say these were the very best waffles ever; but, I would make them again.  Any homemade waffles outshine those frozen discs in a box. I would suggest adding a bit of cinnamon or some other spice to give these a bit more of a flavor boost.

Just wondering about the "mix well."  May have thrown the recipe off for a few people......  I use a whisk, and very rapidly mix for just a few seconds....a little lumpy is better than over-mixing which loses the rising ability of the Baking powder.

Basic waffle recipe, but I always seperate the egg whites and beat till stiff and fold into the batter after everything else has been mixed well. This helps to create a fluffier waffle. So many possibilities when making waffles eg: add orange zest and the juice, take fresh raspberries and tuck a chocolate chip inside and bake. Add Vanilla, almond extract or malted milk powder and chocolate chips.

This recipe is fabulous.  I was worried about how runny they were before I cooked them, but they turned into big, fluffy waffles that tasted divine!  I didn't find them to be bland at all and my four year old loved them. The only thing I did was to add a tad bit more sugar, but I don't think they really needed it.  Tasted great with strawberries and whipped cream.

Our Family enjoyed this recipe.  The only thing that I changed is to add 1 tsp vanilla to the mix.  I also mix up the dry ingredients, add the milk, vanilla, and egg yolks.  In a separate bowl I beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form, then fold them into wet ingredients.  I believe that this is the key to fluffy and crisp waffles.

I thought it was pretty good. I did add a little cinnamon and vanilla like people had recommened, I think I got to much cinnamon, b/c it tasted like french toast waffles. But other than that they were fluffy and great....

Crispy outsides and light, fluffy insides - delicious! I do reduce the salt to about 1/4 teaspoon and I add 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. My family loves these on the weekends! But I usually make a large batch and freeze some for mid-week breakfasts because they freeze exceptionally well.

This recipe is very similar to what I have used for years.  The only differences are I use about 1/3 stick of butter instead of oil and add 1/4 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.  I also use only about 1 teaspoon of sugar.

If your goal is to make a waffle that is only "better than a mix," then I'm sure these may qualify. But when compared to other "from scratch" recipes that are just as easy to make, this recipe yields dry, tough, and limp waffles. They were helplessly pathetic little creatures that cried out, wanting to be put out of their misery. It was necessary to smother them with heaping amounts of butter and maple syrup in order to help them slide down my throat easier. Thanks for the recipe but I think we'll pass.

Of the many waffle recipes I've made, this is my favorite.  The consistency is the best - crispy on the outside and soft and moist inside.  As mentioned in the other comments, I made this with 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I also substituted 1/4 cup wheat germ for a 1/4 cup of the flour.  These turned out great and I can't wait to make them for our extended family.  Yields 8-9 waffles with a standard waffle maker.

I would suggest seperating the eggs and beating the egg whites till firm but not dry - gently fold in the egg whites after all other ingredients have been incorporated. I would also sprinkle some freshly ground nutmeg over the top before baking in the waffle iron - and like others, I would definitely add some vanilla. The egg white creates a light and fluffy waffle. Waffles are a great dessert as well as breakfast treat. My grandmother made all sorts of flavors of waffles - pumpkin, chocolate, etc. Enjoy!

If you like just plain waffles, these are pretty good. I tried the recipe even though I didn't have to because just looking at the ingedients told me they were nothing special.
I add vanilla and a hint of cinnamon and change things up by adding blueberries or cranberries or whatever sounds good at the moment to the batter.

The easiest recipe for waffles.  Finally, I don't have to separate yolks from whites and whip the whites etc.  I added vanilla, 4 tbsp sour cream, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and used butter instead of oil.  Batter seemed thin at first, but fluffed up nicely in the waffle iron.    Lacked the crispness that I get when I go through the pains of whipping egg whites etc.

OH my goodness these waffles are AMAZING.
They're perfect for weekday mornings when you're in a rush to get to school.
Usually what I do is make tons of pancakes on the weekend freeze them and eat then toast them and eat them during the week.
Remmber:If you're going to pre-cook them to not cook them fully so that when you put them in your toaster they don'y become hard and chewy. CHEERS TO MOM'S BEST WAFFLES!!

I've just hosted a brunch and made these waffles. They all disappeared before I could even taste one! I was told they were the best waffles ever and asked for the recipe. I'm giving 5 stars on trust and promise to make them again to try them.

This recipe is SO good! My son eats waffles every day for breakfast and I got tired of buying them. Now, I make a batch every few days and freeze the extras. They freeze pretty well. I also sometimes use 1 cup of whole wheat pastry flour in place of 1 cup of white flour and they taste even better!  Thanks for the recipe!

These waffles were quite good.  Light and fluffy.  The batter was thinner than I was used to so the first batch I overfilled and it overflowed the waffle iron.  As noted by a few others I added 1 tsp vanilla and also added some chopped pecans.  Yummy!

Santa finally brought me a waffle iron and the recipe that came with it was HORRIBLE- tasted like cardboard.  I knew I'd find a treasure here, and I sure did!  These waffles are quick, easy and super yummy.  They even taste good with nothing on them- the true taste test.  Thanks!

I did not care for this recipe. Batter was way too thin. It never bakes up in the waffle iron to fill the voids, ending up looking like a mess. I tried this recipe to save some time, as I usually make the Belgian Waffle recipe on this site. I didn't want to wait for the yeast to rise, but all this accomplished was wasting time and ingredients.

I made it before with the recommended changes, then again as is.  Loved it as is.  Just added a little extra vanilla but it is delicious as is.  It's a waffle, it's not supposed to be super flavorful, but it is fluffy on the I side, crispy on the outside.. Thank you for an excellent recipe.

Easy to make.  Separating the eggs makes it fluffier. Add bits of bacon and real maple syrup and you might think you are a lumberjack in the forests of Canada.

I make these all the time-they're quick and delicious with strawberries and whipped cream.  I usually use at least 1 cup of whole wheat flour with it to make them healthier. Even with all whole wheat flour they taste great!

I personally add about a teaspoon or so more sugar than called for, but that's just preference.

This batter was hard to get smooth. After 10 mins in the waffle iron I gave up on them getting that golden crispness and pulled them out. They were soft and thick. I won't be using this recipe again!

Delicious, fragrant, and light. I made them with 1 cup milk and 1 cup buttermilk. The hint of cinnamon was just right-will definitely keep this recipe!

First time that I tried this recipe and it made a delicious product!  The only thing that I did different was add 1 tsp vanilla and I separated the egg and beat the egg whites then folded them in to the mixture.  I will be keeping this one around for sure!

I've made these twice now.  Both times with half AP flour and half WW flour since I have some whole wheat flour that I really need to use up.  Very very good!  Next time, I'll try it will all AP like the recipe calls for.  I also had a small orange I wanted to use this time, so I zested it and added the juice and zest to the batter.  Also threw in a 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  OMG.  This recipe is a keeper and a great base to modify.  Thank you for posting!

I have been making these waffles now for well over 2 years...when I ask my 3 year old in the morning what he wants for breakfast, he always asks for these waffles!!!  I rated this 5 stars because they are a great tasting waffle just as they are, and because they are so versatile...  Just add chocolate chips, fruit, spices or different flavored extracts and you have a different flavor everyday to suit your mood!!!
Absolutely love it!  Thank you so much!

Love, love, love these waffles! They are a perfect amount of sweet and give just the right fluffiness! I think I've made them 5 times within the last month!  Adding strawberries and fresh fruit makes them even better. For me, they make 6 waffles (1 waffle=2 squares)

This was a good recipe but I kicked it up a notch by makeing the batter fluffy by folding in the egg whites instead. It is simple to do and makes a big difference!

I am giving this recipe with 3-star with reservations. First, I think this recipe is better fit to 1 1/2 cups of milk as opposed to 2 cups. My problem with this was they were BLAND. I did add a tbsp of vanilla but would have been better fit with 2 tbsp of vanilla. However, the consistency of the waffles were good. I think this is a good base for a recipe but not so great as is.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used half buttermilk and half 1%.  Does buttermilk affect baking powder?  Because my waffles were overflowing but not full.  I'm a pretty good judge as to how much batter to put in (use Bisquick quite a bit).  They were spongy which I liked because they soaked up every bit of syrup.  Try them with peanut butter and real maple syrup, yum!

OMGoodness, these are great.  I halved the recipe and added a teaspoon more sugar.  I quickly whipped these up this morning; a weekday.  They were so good & way simple. They easily blow any box mix outta the water.  I will try freezing them for a guaranteed tasty-quick breakfasts  And next time, I'll add cinnamon and vanila just to follow some of the suggestions of other reviews.

I only added 1 3/4 cup of milk, and I added 2 tsp of vanilla.  Then I added food coloring to make them marble waffles!  The kids loved that!  The waffles were great!  In any recipe you have to make it your own!

Excellent, quick and simple waffle recipe. All three of my boys (ages 11, 6 and 21 months) scarfed these right down. My (extremely picky) 6 year old has named this our official new waffle recipe. The best recipes are often the most simple, and this is no exception.

The only reason I put 4 * is because they didn't puff up as much as I'd like. Other than that, they were very good. I added vanilla, a dash of cinnamon and used melted butter instead of oil. I also used buttermilk. I liked them very much and they are so easy to make!

These were really good waffles.  Turned out crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  I chose this recipe because it had considerably less oil than the others on this site.  I sprayed the waffle iron really well with cooking spray, and the waffles didn't stick.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Thanks for sharing!

These waffles were exactly what I was looking for - plain old waffles. They were great! They took slightly longer to become crisp than some other recipes I have used, but that was no big whoop. I will certainly be making these again next Sunday!

These are a keeper!  They turned out light, fluffy and had crisp edges.  I added a tsp of vanilla, but followed everything else exactly to the recipe.  I HIGHLY recommend these.  I won't be using the box mixes any longer.  Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe!

My husband and I love these waffles. They make so much, if there is only two of you, you have to freeze the left overs. Just pop them into the toaster the next time you want waffles and YUMMY!

Yum!  I was looking for a new waffle recipe and this was good!  I added a little 
bit of vanilla and nutmeg and gobbled them all up with my two-year old.

Made today (8/27/17).  Easy.  Tastes pretty good--just a hint of sweetness.  This is only the second waffle recipe I've tried recently (haven't made waffles for many, many years) so didn't know if I should give it 5 stars when there might be a better recipe out there.  But, it's a recipe I would definitely make again.  I can always downgrade if I find another recipe that knocks my socks off.

Really happy with this recipe which we always use now with our new waffle iron.  It doesn't take any special ingredients and works great.  The real trick is making sure your waffle iron is good and hot.

We made a double recipe and used a small Sunbeam electric waffle maker.  As waffles for us are meant to be a vehicle for delicious real maple syrup, I don't really see the need for a specifically amazing waffle-alone taste, so the reviews that mention that don't matter to me.  The taste, consistency, ability to fill out the waffle maker, etc. all were just fine!

This is a base recipe where you can add additional flavors. I did a savory waffle by adding a cup of sharp cheddar, 1/4 cup of green onions and a 1/4 cup of diced ham!  Delicious!  FYI the secret to crispy waffles is to have the waffle maker as hot as possible and to grease the waffle iron or add fat to the batter. I substituted the oil for melted butter!  Yummy!!

Excellent recipe!!!  I only made two simple adjustments. Added brown sugar, instead of white.  Also, added three shakes of cinnamon. Yummy!!!  Made chicken and waffles for dinner with this recipe. My family loved it!!!

Great basic recipe to expand on! I added 5 tbs of sugar and only 11/2 cups of milk and 1 tbs of cinnamon. Also exchanged the oil for butter. Drop some chocolate chips on there too.  Next time I'm adding brown sugar.

My family and I have made these now for the passed few weeks as a weekend breakfast go to. I like adding extras so we did cinnamon and vanilla one weekend and this week we made them with lemon extract and poppyseeds. Added some extra sugar for the lemon poppyseed... Phenomenal!!!! I have added this recipe to my personal written recipe book at home. Definitely a keeper :-)

Failed to rise to the occasion.  Easy recipe to follow however, the batter was thin and watery.  They didn't rise and were gooey in the middle.  I followed the recipe exactly as is.

came out perfect! But I need a double batch for my family of 4. 
I'm not sure how that first batch makes 6 servings. I got 5 waffles out of it. Unless you split one in 2 for 2 little kids?

All in all, quite good. I'll definitely make these again. Nice flavour with added cinnamon. Goes well with plain syrup or with plain yogurt, banana, and syrup together. Substitutions I used: 1/3 white whole wheat and 2/3 white flour. Added 1 tsp cinnamon--great addition. Wanted to add vanilla and will next time, but didn't have it on hand. I think the recipe might be lacking in flavour without the cinnamon, but great texture, crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside; hence the 4 stars.

I followed the recipe to a T. They were very dense and  seemed to a tad bit under cooked inside while the outside was browned just fine.  They were ok but I would try to perfect the recipe somehow next time.

This is a very good recipe for waffles.  I have a "waffle stick" maker and this recipe made them very delicious.  I did add cinnamon and vanilla to the batter which made them extra good.  Definitely a keeper recipe which was super easy and super fast.

I wonder if the nay sayers know how to cook. They are mostly in the minority. I usually find the people most critical are poor cooks themselves. Thanks for the recipe.

Also good if you take time to separate the egg yolks from the whites, beat the whites until stiff and fold them in gently at the end.  This makes the waffles even lighter!

Husband is VERY picky, but loved these!  Wanted to know when I was going to make them again.  I made the batter the night before, just stirred and poured.  Couldn't have been easier.

These are easy and quick to make, especially on Sunday morning before church. As other reviewers suggested, I did add a tsp. of vanilla for added flavor. No complaints here.

These were very quick and easy to make and turned out perfect for us!  I used coconut oil for the vegetable oil and used half whole grain white wheat and half all purpose and doubled the recipe.  In half the batch, I threw in some chocolate chips to surprise the kids.  

I plan on keeping this recipe and making it over and over.  Thanks!

This recipe for waffles is average.  I prefer a true Belgian waffle and there is no shortcut for that.  You have to use a recipe with yeast or they don't taste the same.

These were a little too dense for me.  They felt like bricks in your stomach.  I like the fact that it was easy, but I think a recipe where you are asked to whip the egg whites separately and then fold them in would make them lighter and crispier.

I add some vanilla and double the sugar in this recipe. I always end up with 8 waffles. Always freeze waffles then put them in toaster at a later date- they come out slightly crisp, the way I like them.

I thought this would save me money from buying the box pancake mix.  Tried it with my grandsons who eat waffles every Wed. when I'm homeschooling them.  "Grandma--what's wrong with these waffles? They are so heavy. They aren't nearly as good as the ones we usually have. They usually eat 1 1/2 waffles each --today not even a half.  Never again will I make these.

If you separate the eggs and whip up the egg whites separately and then add at the end, they are much more fluffy and light.

I ONLY GAVE IT 3 STARS FOR THE EASE OF THE RECIPE, BUT DID NOT LIKE THE OUTCOME.. WAFFLES TASTED TO CHEWY FOR MY TASTE.
I USUALLY LIKE TO WHIP THE EGG WHITES FIRST AND ADD TO THE REST OF THE BATTER.  I GUESS I WILL STICK TO MY USUAL RECIPE

I add a bit of cinnamon, some sour cream or yogurt and a couple of tablespoons of oatmeal and increase the flour.  If I feel like it, I also add some melted butter with the oil.

These were good, but not very crisp coming off of the iron.  The batter was very runny.  But still a good, basic waffle that was easy to make with simple ingredients.

My family loved this recipe! I replaced one cup of flour with 1 cup ground quick oats. These were my first attempt at waffles with a new waffle iron and they were perfect. Also the leftovers froze well to be reheated in the toaster later.

I thought this recipe was great!  I gave it 4 stars because I added vanilla and also some nutmeg.  I also separated the eggs and beat the egg whites before adding them.

I had been looking for an easy put together waffle recipe for years and this was an answer to my prayers.  I followed the suggestion of some of the reviewers and added vanilla to the recipe.  My family loved them and request these at least twice a week.  I am no longer the "awful waffle" maker!

They taste fine (nothing terribly special - I did add vanilla) but the batter is WAY too thin.  I would recommend decreasing the milk by at least 1/2 cup.  You can always add more if you need it.

Made them for the second time this morning.  My family gobbled them up.  I did add a little extra baking powder and used half whole wheat and half white flour and added a tsp. of vanilla.  I whisked the eggs together before adding the oil and milk.  Then whisked the entire recipe together....really quick and easy.

I used this as a base for my waffles and just add chocolate chips for one batch and blueberry/walnuts for another batch. I also use whole wheat flour because that is what we keep in the house.

Very good flavor!  Much better than the Bisquick or Krusteaz mix and just as fast.  Per other reviewers, I added 1t. vanilla and 1/2t. cinnamon.  My new go-to recipe!  PS. I used a classic, thin waffle maker

WE altered the recipe a little bit. We added 4T of white sugar, we only put in a pinch of salt, instead of 2T of oil we put 30 grams of butter and we also added 1t of vanilla essence. We followed the recipe but at the end we blended it with an electric mixer

This recipe was pretty good, easy, and quick...  I added 2 tsp of vanilla, about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and doubled the sugar, because my family likes sweet waffles...  I also tried a batch with chocolate chips in it, and they were very yummy.

Nice, basic waffles that were quick to make this morning.  I doubled the recipe since my brother and sister in law were staying over and between the four of us we ate 6 waffles and had 4 left over.  I just froze the remainder and they'll be good quick breakfasts later.  I have a belgium waffle maker, and it worked well.  The batter was a bit runny, but it was fine with my waffle maker.  We added strawberry syrup and butter on top and they were a hit.  Thanks for the recipe!

Definately too thin, so I added an additional cup of flour and 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  Fast, easy, and tasty.  I put 1 cup batter into my 8 in square waffle iron, made 4.

I think this recipe is great because it's so simple and easy. They taste alot better than the frozen waffles, and I know what goes in it. The recipe is real easy to remember because it's two of everything. However, there's nothing in this recipe that makes it stand out compared to the other waffle recipes. I'm still looking for the BEST waffle recipe, but this will do for now.

I usually purchase the Krusteaz waffle mix, but this was almost an identical replica.  Great waffles! I use a round single-waffle iron, and I was able to make 6 waffles.

These were good, but fell a little flat. If I make them again, I will separate the eggs and fold in the beaten egg whites at the end.

These waffles are our favorites!  They're great, a little sweet.  Forget mixes.  These are delicious and wholesome!  Eat some now and freeze some for later.  We even had to make these with rice milk for a while due to some allergy issues and they were still delicious!  Highly recommend!  Do add vanilla.

I followed the recipe exactly and although it did NOT taste bad, there was no substance to it.  The batter was thin which made it difficult to use the right amount without making a drippy mess.  Trying to open the waffle maker, they pulled apart eventhough it was sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  I will not be making these again.

Nice, simple recipe. I subbed buttermilk and brown sugar. I also added vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The batter was thick because of the buttermilk, but my non-stick waffle iron was up to the task. The whole family enjoyed these. 
We have also made these with self-rising flour. The twos really make this an easy recipe to remember! It really lends itself to variations. Blueberries, pecans, spices, you name it. This has become our regular waffle recipe!

I halved the recipe, used whole wheat flour (with an extra bit of baking powder), and added a few dashes of cinnamin, allspice, and vanilla extract. It comes out tasty and really hearty, perfect for a quick dinner!

I used this batter in my belgian waffle iron. WOW! These turned out very light and airy. I did let it stand for about 15 minutes before I made them. I got 6 from this recipe. These were fantastic! Thanks for sharing your Mom's recipe!

This is a good recipe when you want to make waffles fast - not using a hand mixer, or beating the egg whites separately saves time. What you save in time, you do lose in the extra fluffiness the other methods allow, but still a good waffle. I did add 2 tbsp extra flour because I didn't have time to let the batter stand for 5 minutes or so; this likely would have thickened it up enough.

Easy recipe that I've used many times.  I like to use when I have oil (out of butter).  I make for kids and get lots of compliments.  We freeze the leftover ones to heat in toaster on busy mornings!

I followed the recipe exactly and the batter turned out really thin, so I had to add about 1/4 cup more flour. In my opinion, these were bland and chewy not light and crispy. I still like Waffles I better (on this site) so I would not make these again.

I have a better recipe, but this was good for a quick waffle on a school morning.  They were a bit dense, but still tasted good.

The kids were begging for waffles this morning and I was out of my regular mix.  I got online and found this recipe, thought I would try it.  Trying to take into account what some of the reviews said. I slowly added the liquid afraid it would be too runny but I ended up using all of it.  It was perfect.  My whole family loved it.  No more ready made mix for us.  It was easy and quick.  Tasted wonderful!

Just acquired a new/used waffle maker and had never made waffles before.  This recipe is easy and tasty and they turned out light and fluffy.  I gave 4 stars because although they tasted fine without it, I think some added flavoring would enhance them.  I used almond extract for the last few of the batch.  You could use whatever suits your taste.  These waffles will show up on my kitchen table frequently from now on.  YUM!

Three stars because they are easy and have basic ingredients most people have on hand.  The taste was okay, the texture was way off.  They were way too dense and 'bready'... my husband immediately asked, did you change the waffle recipe? (I tried these because I was out of ingredients for our usual waffles) he only took two bites and the rest went into the garbage.  I found they taste best when very lightly browned and immediately buttered and doused with syrup.  If you make them golden brown they are over done and way too chewy.  They aren't that bad if you aren't picky, but we have waffles all the time and these just did not cut it.

I just made these for breakfast. They're quite simple to make, which is a definite bonus.  I thought they tasted great, too.  My husband thought they needed a little bit more flavor, so next time I'll add some vanilla and a bit of cinnamon to the mix.  His favorite is the William's Sonoma Beligium Waffle Mix - but at $7.00 a can (and you have to use 1/2 of can per batch!) it's kinda expensive. Like I said, I'll tweak this and I'm sure we'll have a winner!  Thanks!

This was a great recipe for waffles. My boyfriend kept giving me compliments on them! They were easy too, which is good in the morning.

I added half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and half a teaspoon of almond extract. 

I also made the cinnabutter from another recipe and we put it on top of the waffles. 

I would definitely make these again.

Waffles usually smell good, but even with the added vanilla there was no waffle aroma.  The finished product was rubbery, and I found them pretty tasteless.  I will use Bisquick before I ever make these again.

I'm an experienced cook and I had trouble with this recipe.  Even when I cut down on the amount of milk, the batter came out rather thin.  This made it diffucult to put enough batter in the waffle iron, which meant that I had a mess with the excess batter dripping down the sides of the waffle iron.  The window between done and burnt also was very narrow.  The taste was good, the texture average, ease of cooking poor.

I've been making home-made waffles since i bought my waffle-maker years ago. I've tryed this recipe today for breakfast and we loved them, this were the best so far. Just a bit to sweet, next time i'll cut down the sugar, but other than that great texture and flavour. I also added a bit of lemon to the batter and it was so good!

This was a really great recipe!  It was so easy and only took 10 minutes from start to finish.  I set the waffle iron to preheat and made up the batter.  I added fresh diced strawberries and some cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  Mmmmmm...it was delicious!  The only thing that I am trying to improve on is that I like my waffles kind of crunchy on the outside.  These made a good crust, but the crust got soft as soon as I put syrup on it.  Maybe I'll put a little bit of melted butter instead of the oil, next time...and there will definitely be a next time.

Maybe it was the skim milk, but my batter came out thin so I added more flour.  They were still delicious and easily the best homemade waffles I've had in a while!

Easy to make and pretty tasty! One note that I wish was on the recipe is that the batter will be fairly runny. This is perfectly fine but I think it is good to let people know. Just so you're not wondering if you messed up.

They look great! I make the batter in a blender:
- whip up egg whites till frothy
- add egg yolks at low speed
- add wet ingredients & blend
- add pre-mixed dry ingredients & blend


Healthy  substitutions:
- kamut wheat flour
- 3/4 c. kefir + 1.25 c. water for milk
- add 2 T. apple cider vinegar
- 3 t. baking powder + 1 t. baking soda
- equivalent sugar substitute (stevia, monk fruit, erythritol)

These were tasty and so easy... no whipping egg whites, etc.  I added about a tsp of cinnamon to ours. Since i use a 9 inch Belgian waffle press, i needed a slightly thicker batter, so i only used 1 3/4 cups milk. Turned out great, and golden brown with a nice firm, crunchy crust.

No changes but the addition of vanilla extract and/or cinnamon might make them even better.

A really great recipe! But my only suggestion is that I added 1 tablespoon of vanilla and that brightened up the recipe.

These were easy to make and tasted good. Would make again. I followed the recipe as is but added a couple of tsp of vanilla. I used a double Belgium waffle maker and got 16 waffles when adjusting the serving size to 12 and 13 waffles when adjusting to 8. Adding some cocoa to make them chocolatey is good too!

Made as per recipe, except added 1 tsp. Vanilla.  My family thought the waffles were very bland and ended up pouring the rest of the batter down the drain. I thought I would try this instead of my usual recipe but it was not a hit. Would not recommend even trying this particular recipe. Instead use "True Belgian Waffles" from Taste of Home.com.

The texture of these were a bit off.  Very gummy and I followed the recipe.  My kids didn't like them at all and I added a tad more sugar.  I will stick to buttermilk waffles.

when we first made it the waffle batter  was very thin and made the waffle soggy so we had to add a half cup of flour. even after we did that the waffle was very bland and wasn't fluffy. I don't recommend.

halved the recipe and swapped vegetable oil with melted butter and it worked out just as well! Added cinnamon to the batter which improved the taste.

I don't know if it's because this is the first time I've made waffles or if its because I played with it but I doubled the recipe so I could tweak it I also added an extra 1/2 cup of flour and a teaspoon of vanilla the first one came out VERY dense so I started thinning it little by little to my liking. Next time I'm gonna stick to the original amount of flour but I might add a little more milk. Like I said I'm learning lol

Good basic recipe.

I used 3 eggs, 1 cup of apple juice, 1 cup of milk, ginger, cinnamon and vanilla (1 tsp) and 1 tsp baking  powder and a pinch of salt.

Add blueberries (about 1 cup) and heat up your waffle iron for light, tasty waffles.

Very heavy, dense and tastes rubbery. Batter also didn't work in my waffle maker. I won't make this again. My Mom hated them.....lol
Do NOT let them sit long before freezing. I made them all before eating my own, then prepared to freeze.....they were turned hard as a rock by the time I finished eating.

This is a very boring waffle.  The batter was very liquidy, and the waffles were pretty flimsy out of the waffle maker.  Even with a little vanilla added, I was not impressed.

Light and fluffy when you separate the egg whites and yolks. I doubled the sugar and vanilla to suit my tastes. They came out fantastic! I cook them in my Belgium waffle maker. If you pull them out a tad early and refrigerate, they can later be reheated in the oven successfully.

This has been my go-to recipe since the first time I made it. You can't go wrong. Easy, only a few ingredients and delicious!!! I just add a dash of vanilla extract.

The recipe is ok. This didn't come out as firm as we have seen in other recipes and could use some tweaking. A little vanilla did help the bland flavor. This would work better as a base for a fruit topping rather than by itself.

I tried this recipe and it was okay. Maybe, because I used half wheat flour. I also whipped the egg whites. Next time I will make just as recipe stated and no changes. But good basic recipe. I halved the batter and used vanilla extract in one half and Orange extract in the other. I did cook all the batter and froze the rest. My daughter thought it was good. Will definitely try again.

I made these last night and they did not come out well. They were very dense and even when cooked they were not at all light and fluffy, but rather dense and tough. They were not good at all! I will not be using this recipe again.

Wonderful recipe. You can also leave the eggs out if you need to; you get a light, crispy waffle. Just add more milk until it's right.

Anyone who gets a too runny batter in any recipe it's because your flour already absorbed some moisture so you just need to add less liquid (ie milk in this case). Add the milk until the batter is just right.

The original recipe is bland.  I modified it the second time around.
Substituted melted butter for oil and added two tbls sour cream and vanilla.  Everyone thought the the flavors improved.

Recipes looks same as boxed mix -- I had sugar and vanilla.  The waffles are good, but not anything extraordinary.  Definitely add the vanilla.

Excellent and easy! Two descriptors that make for a killer breakfast recipe. Especially when you are tired, but you still want to impress the family.

This is a good basic waffle recipe, which was exactly what I was looking for. No, it's nothing fancy or exciting, but it's perfect if you're just looking for a basic recipe and is extremely easy to make. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the recipe in my Better Homes & Gardens cookbook is a bit better taste-wise, but as that's packed away in a box right now, this worked out well in the meantime. As long as you're looking for an easy, basic recipe, I would recommend this one!

I had never made waffles before, but because my son has been eating tons of toaster waffles I bought a waffle iron when I saw one on clearance. I needed a basic starter recipe and this one worked awesome! The waffles were tasty and produced a soft waffle. I'll experiment to see what other textures I can come up with.

Because these are so easy and because my family never notices when I work really hard on waffles or don't - these are our favorite.. add sugar and vanilla.

Great waffles!  For a slightly healthier version I subbed 1/4 flax meal for flour, stevia for sugar (check the label for sub info), and added vanilla.  Because of the flax adds moisture you'll have to cook the waffles a wee bit longer.

I found these waffles to be very good and super easy to make.  I whole wheat flour, and added 1 tsp of vanilla.  Topped with Chocolate Gravy (another recipe on this site)  One word....YUMMY!!!

this was not good for me, the consistancy was wrong from the start (way too thin) and the waffles were soft and chewy not crisp infact I could not get mine to brown in the iron.  I added flour and butter and some vanilla they tasted ok but not my favorite.  I froze the extra and put them bak in the toaster to brown.

I made these waffles for my family this morning and they were gone before I even sat down.  Husband raved about them, grandchildren devoured them and I understood why when I finally got to sit down myself.  Great recipe and so easy!

These waffles have good flavor, as I did add 1 t of both cinnamon and vanilla.  The only negative part of this recipes is that I had to add additional flour to the batter because it was too runny w/ using ingredients as is.  I did also add a scoop (eyeballed it) of cornstarch to give it some crisiness.

Awesome basic recipe that helped my very first waffle making experience! It was crunchy and fluffy, though all I did was mix and pour!    I added vanilla as suggested by other reviewers. And to make it special, sprinkled the top of the batter with diced almonds, as seen in belgian waffle stands here in Tokyo. THIS was an excellent addition!

These were awesome!!  I was skeptical when I made the batter because it was rather thin (a reviewer who only gave it 1 star said it was thin so I was worried because mine was too).  After trying them my son said "no wonder it's called Mom's Best Waffles".  They were awesome, best waffle recipe I have tried.  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon in mine because my son likes cinnamon waffles.  It wasn't overpowering, just a hint, I will add a little more next time.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I make it all of the time.  I exchange the milk for soy milk (silk) and it turns out beautifully.  We have a milk allergy in the house and the kids that drink milk can not taste the exchange.

These were good but I'd try a different recipe next time.  I added an extra TBSP. of sugar and used a combo. of brown and white sugars.  I also added some vanilla and a few shakes of cinnamon and nutmeg.

I made these for dinner the other night. I thought they were a bit rubbery but everyone that came over for dinner absolutely loved them. They also didn't rise very much so they were very thin, but that may have been the result of my waffle maker, which is rather old but new to me, so I'm not familiar with it. If it was just me, I'd give this a three, but the rave reviews of my guest were a five, so I'll average it out.

These were pretty good.  I usually use the yellow box mix for convenience- hey, go easy, I have 2 under 2!  I forgot I was out and needed a quick and easy recipe that didn't require separating eggs or creaming butter since my 2 yr old was already waiting.  I only used 1.5tsp of sugar, and I added mini chocolate chips.  They are pretty good.  I find them to be just a little bit dense, but I might try whisking them next time to lighten up the batter a little.   All in all, a great go to recipe.

Easy recipe to throw together in the morning. They puffed up in my Belgium waffle maker and came out crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. I substituted a T melted butter in place of the oil and added an extra dash of sugar and vanilla extract.

turned out well i added 1 and 3/4 cup milk since someone else commented on them being to runny and it worked well. I added a splash of vanilla and almond extract. I ran out of box mix and so luckily i had these ingredients on hand.

Perfect recipe! These waffles a wonderful. I like homemade waffles because they are fresh and not too sweet like frozen waffles.

This is a FAST recipe! It's meant for those of us who don't like to buy buttermilk, and never seem to have batter mix on hand. :) I didn't make any additions for flavor- nothing is bland by the time my son and I are done adding maple syrup and butter! I thought the point of a waffle was the toppings anyway. The only change I made was for the milk- used 1.5 cups instead of 2 because my old school waffle iron doesn't do too well with runny mixtures. I would recommend these to a family on the go that wants a quick and tasty breakfast, but not necessarily to someone who is looking for something super gourmet.

Really good basic waffle recipe. I added a bit of vanilla and a touch of cinnamon as per other reviews and they turned out pretty good. My only complaint is that they are a bit heavy but with a bit of tweaking, I'm sure they could be great :)

really good! And so fast to whip up! For those who find the batter too thin, this is what I do... In a 2 cup measure, I put the eggs, oil, and vanilla. I then add milk to the 2cup line. I find this gives the perfect amount of liquid. If it is a bit thick, I just a little more milk to the batter.

I added a lot of vanilla and more sugar. Ended up being one of the most dense waffles I've ever had. Flavor's not bad, but will not be making again.

These waffles were very yummy.  I did add an extra tablespoon of sugar and a tsp. of vanilla.  They were not fluffy, but that didn't matter to my family as the taste was so glad.  I'm going to freeze the leftovers as others have suggested.

Of it's own this is an average waffle. HOWEVER, the key to making them magnifique is add more vanilla, use buttermilk, and grate some orange zest into the dry ingredients.  This will transform any waffle recipe into terrific.

I would say that this was pretty marginal. I did not add all the milk that this recipe called for. It seemed like it was too thin that way. Other than that, I made it as is. Next time I make waffles, I'm going to maybe add some more sugar or some cinnamon with it to make it a bit sweeter, although waffles aren't really meant to be anything more than crispy pancakes. (in my opinion)

I got up Mothers Day and looked on the website for a quick breakfast idea for my Mom, and I saw this. It was quick and simple. It was good, keeping in mind how simple it was. I would recommend it to people as a quick simple, yet good breakfast idea.

Quick, easy recipe for waffles.  I only had whole wheat flour on hand and these turned out great!  I did let the batter rest for a little bit while I dusted off the waffle iron and let it heat up.  Great with some real butter and syrup. GO MOM!

These were okay, but kind of spoungy (sp?!) and I'm not sure why because I followed the directions exactly. I was hoping that these would melt in my mouth or something. Alas, these weren't anything special.

This recipe makes good, but not great, waffles.  I like mine undercooked, while my boyfriend likes his crispy; these waffles got VERY crispy, and quite dense.  Next time I'll probably add vanilla and/or cinnamon to give it a little more character.

This is a very good basic waffle recipe. It is easily jazzed up with strips of cooked bacon for bacon waffles or whatever ingredient you want to add. I used some leftover eggnog in place of the milk and used 2 tsps of sugar instead of the tablespoon called for in the recipe.

mmm...not bad...a little tough and dense.  I think if I made these again I would take the suggestion of separating the eggs and adding them separate.  

I also added cinnamon and vanilla extract for flavour.

We love these waffles! I recently got married and we received a professional deep pocket belgian waffle maker as a gift.  We didn't like the recipes that were included with the waffle maker, or the mixes we tried.  After mixing up a batch of these, we knew we found our waffle.  We have tried them with plenty of add-ins, too...blueberries, chocolate chips, Reese's Pieces...  They are the best!

I added a tsp of almond extract to the batter for flavour which helped.  The biggest problem was that the batter was too thin so I had to add a good handful of flour to it.  Overall it was "okay" but I don't think I will be making this again.

My family is gobbling these down right now! This is a great tasting waffle recipe that only takes a minute to put together. If you want a crispy waffle I suggest you seperate the egg and whip up the whites to a soft peak. Even without the whipping they are great.

WOW....So easy!! No beating egg whites just throw it all in a bowl and beat it all together!!! My son is a Nutella freak so I use Coconut Oil and also I throw in some dessicated Coconut into the mix - the Coconut flavour is delicious AND it makes the waffles extra crispy

I give this five stars:  although I had no milk so used evaporated milk (straight) and I put in two Tbsp cinnamom along with the vanilla. I had only one complaint.  We were out of maple syrup!

I don't know what happened with these waffles but they turned out horrible.  They cooked, seriously, for about 10 minutes in the waffle maker and were still raw around the edges and moist in the middle-even tried turning up the temp.  GREAT taste-added some vanilla and about 1/2 cup blueberries.  But had to throw the batter out-very disappointing because they tasted so good.  I've made lots of other waffle recipes and never had this kind of trouble.

I really liked the flavor and will make these again.  The only reason it wasn't a 5 star rating is that I had to use a lot of nonstick cooking spray!

THe waffles were SO delicious, and super easy. This recipe is virtually goof proof. I added a teaspoon of vanilla (with a 4 serving batch), and did a cup of all purpose flour and a cup of wheat flour. Mmmm!

My first try making waffles, and these were bland.  Nothing special about the taste at all.  I did like the texture though-- crisp outside, soft inside.  Not sure if it helped but I followed the suggestion of another review and let the batter rest.  I also seperated the eggs and beat the whites real fine and then folded them into the rest of the mixture.  I was careful with the milk too-- added just enough til it had a nice semi runny consistency-- it turned out to be 1.5 cups.  On the hot iron I sprayed canola oil spray and I could hear the batter sizzle.  Now how do I get the batter to taste better?

Although these waffles were very easy to make and a good substitute for the quick mix kind, my family didn't think they were anything special.  Although I added 1 tsp of vanilla, they were still pretty bland and chewy.

These are pretty bland without any changes. I made this with 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of all-purpose. I used 2 tablespoons of brown sugar in place of the white, added 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter. Much better flavor with these changes.

I was shocked to discover that these waffles were tasteless!  Considering the good reviews I had high hopes!  I will NOT try this recipe again because there just HAS to be better out there.  In fact the Aunt Jemima mix is better even though it comes from a box.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for.  Good ole classic waffles.  I topped them off with fried bananas in white wine and butter.  Tasty!!!  This is a great recipe for those who are going to top there waffles off w/ fruit, or anything for that matter

These were not light and fluffy, they were heavy.  I like them light and fluffy, with a light crispiness on the outside.  I will keep the recipe I normally use (it's the best!), and I will share it with everyone at AllRecipes!

After trying this recipe, these are the only waffles I'll make.  They are wonderful!!  You know it's a good recipe when the waffles taste great without anything on them.  The only change I make is to add a tsp. of vanilla.

Fluffy and delicious. Even using my dumpy little waffle iron they turned out wonderful. They even freeze and reheat beautifully, my 1yr old LOVED them. I'll never buy waffles  from the store again.

I used this recipe on my first try making waffles with my new waffle iron....a great recipe.  Very easy to make and yummy!!! My husband and picky eater son loved them.  I did add about a teaspoon of vanilla and may add some cinnamon next time.  They came our crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.....close to the restaurant waffles!!
