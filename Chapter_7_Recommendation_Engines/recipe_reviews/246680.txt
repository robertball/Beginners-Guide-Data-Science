I  used  spiral sliced ham which i had an abundance of.  I  substituted Guiness stout since we have that on tap. I used ColbyJack  &  Parm  it was on hand. The kids raved and my husband promised to make love to me later on. I declare  a roaring success!

I made this for a French-themed potluck. It was very easy and delicious! I decided to peel and cut the poratoes before boiling which I thought was easier than trying to peel cooked potatoes. Also, I used brie to top. Otherwise, I follwed the recipe. Very good!

This is an excellent dish, the flavor profiles are so striking, and go together so well, that it almost overwhelms the taste buds!!

For the onions, I suggest using Vidalia, if available.  Also, for those having problems finding a cheese, Whole Foods carries Oma, from Von Trappe Farms.  This wash rind cheese is soft, and paired excellent with this recipe.  Plus the orange rind is quite striking!

WOW!!  Amazing,  seriously.  The only substitutions I made were sour cream instead of creme fraiche and Brie instead of Reblchon cheese (which is impossible to find) I also left the skins on the potatoes.   Make sure you drain some of the bacon fat,  the rest I followed to a tee.  Sooo good!

I used the best brie I could find, but brie alone is very easy to overpower with so much flavor. I might add gruyere or swiss with it next time. I also used sour cream instead of creme fraiche, and it kind of took over. I would substitute heavy cream or just some milk instead if you don't have fraiche. But overall, it turned out extremely well. My family was wary wit

This is a lovely recipe. Had a Christmas gathering and people loved it! I have to say The chefâ€™s voice over is quite entertaining too...
Since I live in Egypt, Rablechon is not available. So I used the grueyere and Brie mix. Fantastic!

Delicious and straight forward to make.  I will boil the potatoes for another 5 min next time around.  We used Gruyere and Brie and it was awesome!

I did make changes because I didn't have the correct ingredients.  I thought I could substitute, but don't!!
The only substitution should be the cheese, since 
we can't get it here in the USA.  The final result just
gave me a hint of how good this dish could be if I
used the  correct ingredients.

This was incredible! Easy to make but you need to drain off a lot of the bacon fat. I placed the rind side down because it looked kind of unappetizing with the rind side showing.

Awesome ! As a French guy coming from near the Alpes, this tartiflette recipe is very good. If you do not have a reblochon with you, feel free to use some Brie or Camembert. The taste with Brie is way less stronger so personally I add a little more wine .
Skeptical about the quarter parts on top of the dish, you can for sure put thinner slices to just look at the over to keep the top from burning.

I made this today for Thanksgiving. Delicious but oh way too much. Halved the recipe and instead of boiling and peeling the potatoes, I cooked the bacon in the oven first, then, with the bacon grease on the baking pan, I put sliced unpeeled potatoes on and in the oven to cook. Loved it but it is not an everyday dish. So rich! But good.

Followed the recipe to the letter including the Reblochon cheese that makes thin, crispy wafers when baked to complement the tast of the maple smoked bacon, onions and potato. Would do it again.

I used gouda. My family thought this was so-so. If I were to make it again, I'd put both cheese and sauce on both layers. I feel like it needs something... maybe some mustard in the sauce?

I loved this recipe.  It is great comfort food.  It comes out really nice and creamy.  It's not hard to make.  It takes a little more time doing the potatoes this way, but they were so nice and soft.  The bacon adds a nice salty meaty flavor to it.  I went with a whole pound of bacon.  I will definitely make it again.

Disappointing. Sounded so good but sure didn't turn out. Potatoes under  done. Cheese crusty and dry. Nothing creamy. Bland overall even with the bacon. I won't try it again.

Great as a side dish. The potatoes are moist and the creaminess comes from the cheese and cream fraiche. Important to put cheese brine down so the cheese melts in the potatoes. When cooked, you can easily take the brine out of thr dish as the cheese has all melted into it :) yummm
