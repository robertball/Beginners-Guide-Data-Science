This was very good but I guess I was expecting something a little bit stiffer. This pretty much fell apart when coming out of the pan. The picture provided is not at all how mine lookes. However, it was very light fluffy and tasted really good ecpesially for being low-fat!! I will make this one again.***

***I made this cheesecake again using light cream cheese and the light cool whip. The cheesecake came out much firmer then the non-fat kind. So if you don't mind a few more grams of fat and a few extra calories I would use the light version of each. I also switch it up with chocolate gram cracker crust and used some mini chocolate chips....yum!!!

This recipe was delicious! I usually make a similar cheesecake, which is my husband's favorite, but decided to try this recipe to lower our fat intake.  I took it to a family party last night and there wasn't one piece left.  My daughter and niece each had two slices.  We like to serve it with strawberries or cherry pie filling over the top.  Very Yummy!!

By far the best no bake cheesecake around!!! I added some lemon zest into the mixture to really punch up the flavor, and I found that this cheesecake tastes 100% better if you eat/serve it about one day after you make it!!! Therefore, it's a really good idea to make it the night before you plan to serve it because then the flavors will have time to mingle around with each other--I guarantee you'll taste the difference from doing so!

This is a good recipe, but it does NOT need 1 cup of sugar. I will try it next time with 1/3 of a cup. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, which gave it a nice flavor. 
To cut down on the fat, this can be used as a pudding - just spoon it into individual ramikins and forget the crust. Top with berries!

This is the perfect trifecta of delicious, healthy & easy.  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!!  I would recommend beating the cream cheese & powdered sugar on high speed for 2 minutes to ensure no lumps remain before adding the whipped cream...

I was wondering when someone was going to put this easy recipe on here. I use regular sugar and a little vanilla. I don't always add all the coolwhip either, less fluffy and more stiff that way. Thanks for putting this up alot of people don't know about it yet, now they will! :-)

This is really more of a cream pie than cheesecake.  The picture with the firm little cheesecake squares has to be from a different recipe- this is no where near that pretty but it is delicious.  I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I also arranged strawberry slices around the top which made it even more guilt free.  Oh, and I used half light cream cheese and half fat free and light whip cream.  With half the sugar and the strawberries I would rate it as 5 stars but I think it would be too sweet for me as written.

When I first made this I was very bias, thinking it was just okay. I still think the recipe above all was very easy, very nice, light but fluffy thick. Not thick as in dense heavy. The thickness of the cream cheese mixture hold very well and doesn't fall flat. This recipe reminds me of the instant no bake Jell-O brand cheesecake pie. Over all, very good. I had to re-rate this because I was a little bias at 1st to the box...then came back after a day or so and re-evaluated my previous review. While the flavor came through with the cream cheese. It is light in flavor, it needed that over the top pa-zazz. Where the box has more of a malted milk cheesecake flavor and the graham cracker crust in the box is very sweet and wet. This is lighter, with fresher ingredients and the crust is nice and dry. This a winner as far as the easiness to assemble and only having just 4 ingredients to work with. However, in the box brand, I don't have to have or want extra toppings because it's way sweeter and much more dense.....this one screams "top me with flavors" which is what I did. I made fresh blueberry and strawberry sauces. So, after thinking very clearly and honestly and seeing my family's reaction to this cheesecake topped with berry sauces. I choose this one verses the box. The berry sauces totally won me over with making this recipe again and again.

Yum really good - hard to tell it is non-fat. I used about half a cup of sugar instead of a whole cup and it still turned out great.  The only downside is that it didn't firm up very well. I eat it more like a pudding than a pie :). This is after 12 hours in the fridge.  Next time I am going to try adding a bit of gelatin to it and see if that firms it up a bit.

Rave reviews - My husband was very happy with the results. His mother makes something called cherry squares, and this was very similar. The only variance used was I used real whipped cream. Thank you for imputting!

I only had an 8 ounce block of cream cheese so I used that, 2/3 cup of confectioner sugar and eyeballed 2/3 of the container of whipped topping.  I added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  The reduced mixture still filled the crust.  I sprinkled the top with mini chocolate chips to decorate.    My husband and I both loved this pie.  Would serve to guests too!

OMG!  this recipe is awesome!  i used 8 oz of the 1/3 fat free cream cheese along with 3 oz the fat free cream cheese.  i substituted splenda for the confectioner's sugar.  make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature first.  then i used a mixer on low-medium setting to blend the cream cheese and splenda.  when it was nice and creamy, i folded in the lite cool whip.  then i spooned that into the low fat graham cracker pie crust, but instead of putting it in the fridge, i put it in the freezer for about 4 hours.  then i took it out and placed it in the fridge.  the cheesecake was nice and firm and tasted great!  thanks for the recipe!

I used reduced fat cream cheese instead of fat free and 1/3 cup sugar.  I use either a reduced fat or a regular graham cracker crust.  It usually needs to sit over night and then by the next day it's great!

Aside from being very easy and economical to make this is an excellent recipe. I did add a bit of lemon zest. Other than that I would not change a thing. This is ideal for diets and a cool summer dessert. Thank you !! Now I can eat cheesecake and not feel guilty.

I made it with 1 cup of sugar first time as recipe.
Then reduced to 3/4 cup, then 1/2 cup, then, 1/4 cup, then I am now reduced it to the 1/8 cup.

I use:
One 8oz Creamcheese
One 8oz~10oz Whipped Topping
1/8 cup of sugar


You can adjust the softness by adding and subtracting the Creamcheese or Whipped Topping.

You can Adjust the sweetness by adding or subtracting the amount of sugar.

It's very simple and you can make this with small children too.

You can create this by simply adding the fruits sauce and fresh fruits, caramel, and etc.

It's nothing but your creativity!!

This cheesecake was amazing! Best one I've ever made and incredibly simple to boot! The low fat content is an almost-impossible-to-believe bonus. This will now be my go-to dessert recipe, for SURE.

My family loves this cheesecake! They had no idea it had less fat either. My husband is picky as is my 9year old. They love so much I make it once a week. Havent' tried it with lemon zest just as is, so I think I will try it with the zest tonight.

I made this pie for my Bunco group because I liked that it wasn't a heavy cheesecake (which I love, but wanted something lighter for summer).  Everyone LOVED it including one friend that said she didn't like cheesecake, but she really liked this one!  A recipe to keep and make again and again for sure!

Easy recipe, I have done it many times and everyone loves it. I didn’t have graham crackers the first time I made it, and couldn’t find any at the nearby supermarket, so I decided to  crush some oat bran crackers and mix with sugar and melted butter to make the crust.  Came out wonderful,  is cheaper and I always have them on hand, so I continue to use them.  For the cheese cake mixture I add about 2 oz more cream cheese,  and for variety, a 1/2-1 tsp lime juice or lime zest (if I have fresh limes), or a teaspoon  of either Kahlua or cognac,  and  always top them with red and green cherries. I made a large one the first time, then decided to use cup cake liners in the pans to hold the shape.  Much more convenient and easy to serve, no slicing, little clean up  except for the spoons, and my family and friends just like that they can take one and enjoy with a spoon.  I have also tried them in mini, jumbo cupcake sizes, and glass or hard plastic cupcake size dishes, depending on the occasion and how many individual servings I need.

I like a bit more of a cheese taste so I added more creamcheese and less sugar.  But this recipe is fun and easy to make.

I had already made NY style and was looking for something really simple to try Philly's pumpkin flavored cream cheese. This was perfect. Followed directions to the T with the  exception of the pumpkin flavored cream cheese and whipped up the whip cream from heavy whipping cream, no sugar . Very light and fluffy, delicious!! Will make again, would recommend.

I did change this recipe a bit...I used (2) 8oz. blocks of cream cheese, 1 1/4 cups of powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, and 1 tsp. lemon juice.  I blended it all together with the cool whip.  It came out thicker and had more of a cheesecake flavor.  Everyone who tasted it raved about it!  Thanks Amy!

I just made this cheesecake and it's so simple to make and taste so good! I usually make cheesecake that calls for eggs and a bunch of other ingredients but this one literally only has 4 ingredients!  I think I found my new recipe for cheesecake!

Excellent cheesecake!  I did cut the amount of cool whip by 1/2 cup, and the cake still came out light and fluffy.  Served it with chocolate sauce and cherries.

This is the way I've make no bake cheese cake since I was 13, the only difference is I use lemon juice after adding sugar. It seems to bring out the best in this simple dessert to me. This is the only reoccurring dessert at holidays other that sweet potato and pumpkin pies!

I completely agree with everyone on this wonderful cheesecake recipe!  I used a chocolate graham cracker crust and it was wonderful.

This is the first cheesecake I have ever made, and it was very easy and as delicious as everyone says.  The only problem I had was transferring it from the pan to the serving platter!

This was so easy!  We had some friends over for dinner and they loved it.  We topped it with some fresh strawberry jam  and it was a hit.  So easy to make.  Anytime I make cheesecake I will use this recipe.
