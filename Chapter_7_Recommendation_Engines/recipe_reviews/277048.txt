Hearty but lacked a bit of flavor. I added garlic and oregano and it topped it off well.

This was easy and delicious. I had to deviate from the recipe... I used green lentils instead of red, unfortunately. I think that kept it more solid. Red would have made it more soup-like. Also, I added a dash of cinnamon. Other than that, stuck to the recipe and will be making again. Note: don't shy away from the amount of onion. It's perfect.
