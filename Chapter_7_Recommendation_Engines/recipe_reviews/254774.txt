7.29.16  Thought the feta cheese might bring a little more tang to this, and I couldn’t taste the coriander at all, even after giving it an extra sprinkle.  This is very mild with a pop of sweetness from the cherries and sugar, but I wasn’t thrilled serving it on the suggested pita.  For my personal taste, I could see serving it on a croissant or even a toasted English muffin, or heading into the other direction, on a savory cracker.  I like how easy this is to make and enjoyed it.
