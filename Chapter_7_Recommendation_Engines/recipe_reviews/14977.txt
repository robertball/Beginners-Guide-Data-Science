I don't know what the heck everyone is talking about - this is the worst cheesecake recipe I have ever tried.  I have made tons of different cheesecakes and have never had them turn out as awful as these cupcakes.  There seems to be something missing or too much of something.  The cheesecake was undercooked even when I followed the exact directions, the sour cream topping did not "set" and the overall consistency was poor.  Do NOT use this recipe - you'll waste time & money

These mini cheesecakes were an immediate hit. I also used the standard 1 egg per brick of cream cheese rule and they turned out great. I also made the sour cream topping early and refridgerated it so it would thicken as per another reviewer.

I made these last night with high hopes.  I really wanted to love these as I love anything and everything cheesecake, yet had never made one in my life.  I let them cool on the rack in the pan, and as soon as I was sure they were room temp, I just had to try one.  I immediately noticed how overwhelmingly eggy they were.  Not wanting to give up on them so soon, I refrigerated them overnight per peoples' suggestions in their reviews.  They are better now for sure, but not QUITE the dense cheesecake texture and taste I was hoping for.  I swirled some melted chocolate in some of them, which cuts the egg-like taste and texture some, but it unfortunately also cuts the cheesecake flavor as well.  I may try these again with less eggs, but I won't try them again as is.

Good idea, but needs some tweaks or it is too eggy.  I used the standard "1 egg per 1 brick of cream cheese rule" for these and they turned out fine.  I added the sourcream to the mixture and skipped the whole topping process.  I also added 2 TB flour to help set them.  I halved the batch and added cocoa powder to half the mix for chocoloate cupcakes.  I let my daughter top them with sprinkles, strawberries, chocolate sauce or caramel sauce.

I'm sorry, but this is the worst cheesecake recipe I've ever used. It tastes like eggs, not cheese cake. I now have 48 egg cakes.

Never use that many eggs for cheesecake.  One egg per pkg of cream cheese seems to work the best.  I used real bourbon vanilla for the topping and it tasted way better than the artificial stuff.  And definitely serve these cold.  Cheesecake should be cold!  I made these for my son's 13th birthday party and everybody loved them, but only with 3 eggs (actually one batch only had 2 eggs oops!  but tasted great).

Great basic recipe but I made a few changes.  Like other users had suggested, I used 3 eggs instead of 5.  I also added a crust to the bottom of my cupcakes using 1 cup crushed chocolate Teddy Grahams, 3 tablespoons sugar, and 1/4 cup melted butter (mix together, sprinkle in each cupcake liner, then gently press down.)  I then spooned the cream cheese mixture on top of my crust.  I did not make the sour cream topping.  Instead I sprinkled chocolate chips on top of each cupcake.  I baked them for 25 mins and they came out perfect.  Everyone at work loved them!!

This recipe is quick, easy, and always a hit! I make these all the time for office parties, meetings, and other events and get asked for the recipe all the time (pineapple topping if a favorite!). One tip: if you refrigerate the sour cream topping a bit before you put it on the cupcakes it thickens up and the sugar in it is much less granulated. Other than that, this is a fantastic recipe and I recommend it to anyone!

I changed this to suit my diet plan by substituting Splenda for the sugar (cup for cup).
Since there's no graham cracker crust these have only about 2 grams of carbs per serving!
Satisfies the sweet tooth!

I make these often to serve at my
bed and breakfast "tea time".  I can 
have them made and ready to eat(warm)in
45 min. That's allowing 35 min. of 
cooking time.  My customers love them
and I've given out the recipe several
times.  I usually double the recipe and
have enough for two teas. I also have to
double the cupcake papers as the bottoms
tend to burn in the 30 mins. cooking.
I love the sour cream topping and use it
on lots of different breakfast breads.

I was scared due to several of the reviews but I couldn't be happier!  I altered the recipe based on the other reviews to 3 eggs and 3/4 cup sugar - no sour cream topping.  I used three different toppings:  caramel drizzled over some, strawberry preserves on some and a kiwi lemon jam on others:  YUM.  Going to a fancy dinner and proud to take them.

I gotta say, I was impressed. This was so easy, my daughter did most of it. I did use just 3 eggs instead of 5, and I crushed up some oreos, mixed with a little melted butter, and pressed into the bottom of the cupcake liners b4 i added the cheesecake mixture. I sliced up some fresh strawberries and put them on top once they were completely cooled.

I really did not like these at all.  The frosting on top never set, though I followed the directions.  It was a liquidy mess. I don't recommend trying these.

i loved these!! i used 3 eggs instead of 5 and they were amazing.the sour cream topping didn't sound too great so instead i mixed in the sour cream and second cup of sugar to the mixture and baked it. they came out perfect. they dipped down in the middle, because i didn't cool them before i took them out of the pan, but it was ok, i put chocolate dipped strawberries  on top so it ended up looking and tasting amazing!!!

Four stars for the idea, five stars once corrected. Definately only use one egg per creamcheese block. I was feeling home sick for one of my mom's cheesecakes but its just me and hubby so I didnt want to make a whole cheese cake, then I found this recipe and combined the reviews with my own taste. I used mushed up oreos for a crust and swirled strawberry fig preserves in before baking and it turned out great! I've been experimenting and Nutella works swirled in, really just about anything would. Also, chamborde mixed w/ left over filling and poured on top in delicious.

This is an effortless and appetizing little dessert.  I would prefer it to be a little less sweet but I’ll just adjust the sugar to our specific tastes the next time I make it.  The texture was great and was good plain or accompanied with a fruit topping.

I followed the reveiwers advice and used three eggs instead of five, and my cupcakes turned out great.  I also made my sour cream topping ahead of time, and I had no problems with it, it was very, very good.  I have to say I liked them warm better than cold.

I made these for my husband's birthday b/c he's not a cake fan.  Everyone raved.  will be saving this recipe for sure!

I accidentally put in a Tbsp of vanilla in instead of a tsp, but they were great, so I'll be doing that again.  

I didn't keep them in the pan until they were cool b/c I only had one pan and had to get them done.  They still turned out fine.

I used strawberry, blueberry and apple pie filling.  Blueberry was the favorite of most people.

I made the cream cheese topping first and put it in the fridge.  It really does need some time to set up.

I cut the eggs down to 1 egg per box cream cheese like the other reviewers said.

It's a time consuming project, but very yummy!

I lost my old recipe, so tried this one, the cupcake part turned out fine, the topping did not. I recommend only 1/2 cup of sugar for the topping, 1 cup was too much, it thinned it out and made it a dark color, the top should be fairley white, also just use 1/2 tspn of vanilla in the topping.

Very important! Use 3 eggs and not 5. I saw the 1 egg per brick of cream cheese rule on other reviews of this recipe and I followed it and my cupcakes turned out great. I added strawberries to the top and drizzled some more of the sour cream on top.

this recipe is not extraordinary but it is not bad, it is just not the cheesecake I expected.  I would call it a cream cheese custard.  If you want something a little different from your traditional cheesecake- try it , it actually tastes fine.  I do however, recommend a fruit topping or mixing some fruit in- it is fine without it but a little boring.  It is a great, simple, quick and easy base recipe that will do fine on its own also.

This can be done with Splenda and be sugar free too.  They were good but a little too bland.  Next time I'll try adding some lemon or lime juice for some spark.

I'd found a mini cheesecake recipe I liked in Pillsbury Baking cookbook while searching for something to make for a gluten-free friend, and came to allrecipes to check the gluten section and found this recipe which appears to be nearly identical except in scale and size.  (the cookbook used almond instead of vanilla)

If you're having problems with the recipe, I'd suggest making them smaller in size - the original recipe  uses only 6 ounces of cream cheese for a dozen cheesecakes, and bakes them for 15 minutes or until set.

I found the recipe easy and tasty, and great for those who can't handle gluten (no crust, no flour for thickening, makes it perfect).

Update: I made these recently and we used mini-muffin pans instead of cupcake pans. More work, but perfect little bite-sized cheesecakes! Still need the liner cups though, or they won't come out. -barb

Worst recipe I've ever tried.   Cupcakes sunk very low in the center.  When I added the sour cream mixture on top they completly collapsed leaving only the walls of the cupcake.  What was  left was mushy.

I cut it down to 6 servings and did not do the toppings.  IMPORTANT: Use 1 egg to 1 package of cream cheese (room temp)  I peeked in at 20 minutes and they had puffed up and were ready. Also added a table spoon of flower to give it something to firm up on.   Taste is fine.

These are fast and so good.  If you want one, you'll have to put it on the side before serving, because they don't stay on the table long.  I made them for Thanksgiving, and the pumpkin pie didn't have a chance.

This was a super easy recipe but tastes way too much like eggs even after refrigerated. i wont be making this recipe again! Also I noticed that the bottom of the cupcake wasn't there. It seems like the cheesecake rose and just left empty space at the bottom.

cheesecake came out delicious.. I just added about 1/4 cup more of sugar, maybe a little less than that.  also the sourcream mix gave it that extra spark.  I make my own strawberry filling and peach filling which is always good.  
Overall better recipe than the one in the cream cheese box :-)

These were fantastic, and a big hit at my party.  I went with the advice of 3 eggs for the 3 packages of cream cheese.  For the topping, I used lime curd.  Scrumptious!!

4 Stars because I followed the advice of several other reviews, using only 3 eggs to the amount of cream cheese used, I added a few squirts of lemon juice to the recipe.  I also made a cookie crust (gluten free) out of Pamela's ginger cookies and melted butter- made a cake instead of cupcakes.  Baked closer to 45 minutes with a water bath in the oven.  Lastly, on top of the sour cream I poured melted lemon curd.  Refrigerated and served with fresh blueberries.  Delicious!!

These things are so delicious! I try to make them for every party I have and they are always gone by the end of the night. I like to make a raspberry sauce for them as well. Recently I have tried adding a dash of rose water to the batter. So tasty!

By far, the worst cheesecake I ever made and tasted. I should have known it would be be TOO MUCH EGGS and the sour cream topping is way too sweet. Janice Reesman's "mini cheesecakes" is the one to follow.

I'm on a low carb diet, and this was a lifesaver!  I cut the recipe in half, only used 2 eggs, and Splenda.  I also omitted the sour cream topping.  I have to agree w/others that said they are better cold.  Will definitely make again!

Extremely dissapointing recipe.  I ended up with egg cupcakes.  2 eggs propbably would have done the trick.  Although I tried a second batch and put them into a water bath, they turned out like actual cheesecakes and were liked by all.

This recipes is perfect for something quick to eat. I don't know how anyone could say anything bad about this recipe. I usually cut this recipe down to just making 10 cupcakes and I don't uss sour cream (the sour cream doesn't sound that good). I've made these cupcakes 3 times already and I've found that it's best not to let them brown on the top and make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature before using!This isn't a dense cheese cake, it's on the creamy side so don't use the recipe if this isn't to your liking!

I made these for our company halloween party using food coloring to make the cupcakes orange and the sour cream mixture green.  I was 20 minutes late to the party and hardly any were left!  I kept some for myself so I was still able to enjoy them.

Too many eggs.  I was thinking that when I was mixing them too! The cups fluffed up and then fell and the sourcream topping did not set.  Will continue to go with my recipe, for every brick of cream cheese add 1 egg and 1/4 cup of sugar.  

Flavor was good though.

Great taste & so easy to make! Guests could not get enough of them!

Even though they appear small after cooking, it is a perfect size for a bite size treat, and you have room left in the muffin cup to scoop fruit on top without it spilling out everywhere.

Will save & make again!

amazingpitbull doesn't sound like a user name that would be creating cupcakes, sounds more like the name of a professional fighter.  However, these are very good.  I made some the other day and yes people love them.  I recommend anyone reading this to try this recipe.

Prepared the cheesecake according to other reviewer's suggestions of 1 egg/1 package cream cheese.  Otherwise, would have been too eggy. The cheesecake itself is delicious, but gets completely overpowered by the sour cream topping.  Also the topping does not hold up well at room temperature.  Would suggest skipping the topping and using fresh fruit or a chocolate drizzle instead.  I will not be making these again.

I used three eggs instead and only half the quantity for the topping seeing as the recipe was already quite rich. Amazing nonetheless.

We enjoyed these--made them for the Superbowl and used food coloring to create themed cakes (yellow cheesecake with green sour cream topping to support the Packers). 

I took other reviewers advice to use 3 eggs instead of 5, and I'm glad I did. 

We also made these a day ahead of time--by the time we served them, the cake and topping had both set beautifully. The cheesecake wasn't quite the best cheesecake I'd ever had (perhaps because adding the food coloring led to us beating too much air into the batter, which might have caused the air bubbles in the actual cheesecakes), but they were still delicious and they were a nice change from a traditional cheesecake. 

I plan to make them again the next time I'm asked to bring a dessert to a large party...people can grab a dessert and go without having to deal with slicing.

My mom always made a similar recipie when I was younger, so I was excited to find this.  However, they turned out awful...way too messy and did not set.  The taste wasn't too bad, but I had to throw them away because the topping was so juicy and didn't set at all, even with refrideration overnight.  It ran all down the sides of the cupcakes and made them too sticky to handle.  I did use light sour cream, which may have caused the problem, but I won't be trying this recipie again.

I did not care for this.  Way too much egg and baking times were too short.  It never became an actual cheese"cake" but more like egg batter. The sourcream topping and cheesecakes were all too sweet.

I thought these were very good. I used less egg and I only did the topping on half of the batch. I think it tasted better without the topping. Excellent!

I used 4 packages of cream cheese to make it a little more thicker and creamier and I used 4 eggs. It turned out really good! I made them twice. The first batch I used a mint Oreo cookie for the bottom for a little something different. The second time I just did cinnamon graham cracker. Everyone I gave one to loved them!

Did 3 eggs, 5 seemed way too many...Topping didn't set well in the oven either. But the cupcake itself was really sweet and set well. Went well with everyone at home. =D Sister-In-Law wanted them for her birthday instead of cake. Topped it with cherry pie filling, go easy on the filling or it'll overpower the cheesecake taste.

This recipe was easy and the results were really delicious.  I followed the suggestions made by other reviewers to use one egg per block of cream cheese.  Since having to choose gluten free desserts this one was very satisfying.  It is also a versatile recipe that can be modified to add different toppings.  I will be making this one again.

i agree with the other reviews, only use 3 eggs. the sour cream topping never firmed up for me, but it still tastes good if you drizzle a little bit over. i made a triple berry sauce to go with it. i also made regular graham cracker crust in the bottom of the cups. i think they are fun little desserts for parties.

I have made these on several occasions and everybody from kids to still-wannabe-kids really, really love them.  I sometimes put in some amaretto di saronna in the batter or almond flavoring. i also put in ginger snap at the bottom and it makes an awesome crust.  love love love this recipe

I teach a cooking class for high schoolers after school and they get to choose their recipes, they chose this one. The kids did like the result. They felt it tasted good. They commented that it was not the cheesecake consistancy they had expected but still really enjoyed the taste, so did the principals and teacher they took them too :)

I love this recipe.  To make the perfect little finger food desserts, rather than cooking in a regular size muffin tin, I cook them in the mini-muffin tins.  I spray the tins with cooking spray, coat with graham cracker crumbs and then fill as directed in the recipe.  They are simply delicious.  Everyone always loves them when I bring them to parties.

I made them today for an Easter party and I wasn't to sure how they would go over.  Needless to say...Everyone just loved them.  I had many requests for the recipe.  I did add a vanilla wafer cookie to the bottom of each cup before baking for a mini crust and I topped each one off after cooling just slightly with a Maraschino Cherry.  These were great!

I could see the potential of this recipe but I also had to tweak it. It called for way too much sugar.  You only need 1/3 cup  of sugar and one egg per 8oz block of cream cheese . I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and a couple teaspoons of lemon juice. As for the topping. I made it ahead and again the recipe calls for way too much sugar. I used a couple Tablespoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. I baked them for 15 minutes BEFORE I spread the sour cream topping on them (carefully) then turned the oven off and left them in for another 7 minutes. . They turned out perfect.

Reliable recipe. Actually made it with some adjustments. I was worried they would be a bit runny so I put an oreo in the bottom of each one and poured the batter over. This let me make closer to 23 cupcakes.
I used about half of the recommended amount of sugar in the cupcake topping which was fine.
Also, noted that they came out much better in a my highest quality baking tin - so invest on good tins to make these for the best effect.

Read all comments before making and decided to use only 3 eggs instead of 5. Got the cupcakes out of the oven and tried one. Still too many eggs, can't taste the cream cheese at all. Very disappointing!

We changed two things only 3 eggs and putting a vanilla wafer in the bottom of each cupcake. Turned out very good. Thanks!

This was a good recipe. You need to chill the cheesecakes once they're completely cooled. They will be SO SO SOOO much better once you chill them for a few hours. The sour cream topping didn't go so well for me. It didn't set very well. It turned into a jello-y consistency, sticky, tacky topping that didn't seem to go well with the cheesecake cupcakes. I didn't have any problems with it tasting too eggy. I will definitely use this again.

These are probably the best Cheesecake Cupcakes out there. I make a full cheesecake that has spoiled my hubby to all others. It has a layer of sour cream on top like these cupcakes and they are like a mini of my full one. A hit all the way around. Thanks for sharing.

The egg ratio to the rest of the recipe is VERY overpowering. When they bake it rises in the oven and once it's out it deflates and turns into a flan type consistency. I really would not recommend this recipe at all. Please take heed and do not make.

These were really good. I only ended up using 3 eggs (one per brick of cream cheese)and skipped the sour cream; they came out super yummy. I also made my own graham cracker crust and topped half of them with chocolate glaze.

I decided to edit this mix and made pumpkin style with 1 packet of pumpkin pie pudding mix and a cup of pumpkin pie mix in it. I sprinkled cinnamon chips over the top of it and caramel on others it was a BIG holiday hit and a great thanksgiving substitute.

LOVE this - it's easy and yummy.  Modified it by the one egg for one cream cheese rule, and used almond extract instead of vanilla.  Put a whole oreo in the bottom of cup.  Mini choc chips on top.  Bake for 8-10 minutes.  YUMMY!

These were ok but they indeed only needed 3 eggs and I probably could've gotten away with two.  Plus I overbaked them so they were a little tough but that was my fault.  As well, they could've used a graham cracker base maybe?

These were a little sweet for my taste, but everyone else who tried them loved them. The sour cream topping may sound odd, but is actually quite good. I topped each with a marichino cherry-looks great and tasty too!

I made this as a gluten free desert option for my husband and I who are very envious of those who can eat cheesecake. This is cheese cake. I will make this again and again. I made some homemade jam to put on top with blueberries and blackberries. So good. I took them to a worksgiving party and everyone loved them and could not believe they were gluten free.

Ive been makibg this recipe for years now the only thing I changed was I put them in for 40 minutes instead of 30. I also use the Silicon cupcake molds instead of a tin it makes them come out a bit better.

First time I have tried to make mini cheese cake cupcakes and boy was I disappointed! Doesn’t taste like a cheese cake AT ALL! I used 3 large eggs. Should have probably used two. The mixture never quite set.  I definately agree with doubling the cupcake liner to two! Sour cream topping is too liquidy and too sweet. I used smashed nilla wafers at the bottom of the cupcake liner and they burned in 20 minutes. Would not recommend making this. Will not be making it again.

These cheesecake cupcakes are delicious and were a big hit with a large crowd!  We made them with three eggs, as many here suggested.  They sank in a little more than we expected, but that gave us lots of room to add strawberries on top. DO include the sour cream topping; it makes the cupcakes taste more like a New York cheesecake. Great recipe, but with three eggs instead of five. We will be making them again and again.

Very tasty and easy gluten-free dessert.  I substituted yogurt for the sour cream-make sure you do not use low-fat yogurt (like I did), as it'll take much longer for topping to set.  I added fresh blueberries as a topping, and added apricot jam to glaze the fruit.  I warmed/strained the jam and topped the blueberries with the glaze.  It was a hit and will make again!  We only had another couple for dinner, so I adjusted the recipe to make only 6 mini cheesecakes (1 block of cream cheese).

At 4/5 stars I thought these would be great. I can't even get the paper off without the whole cupcake falling apart. Very sweet, too, which is probably part of the problem. Too much sugar which turns into syrup. What a waste of ingredients.

It has too many eggs which cancel out the cheesecake and make it a weird texture, yet yummy cupcake.

I followed the advice of several other reviewers and only used 3 eggs-one for each block of cream cheese. This is crucial, because they would definitely be too runny with five eggs. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  It was absolutely delicious. I made it for dessert for some friends of mine, and everyone loved it. I cut up some fresh strawberries and placed them on top-a nice extra touch. I also made the topping ahead of time and refrigerated it, and put the cupcakes in the fridge for an hour once they had been made. I will definitely make these again. UPDATE 8/2/16 After spending 24 hours in the fridge, these were amazing.

Liked it with changes.  Per most of the other reviewers one egg per 8 ounces of cream cheese is plenty.  If you drop a vanilla wafer in the bottom of the parchment cupcake cup  you get a quick and easy crust.  1 cup of sugar for 1 cup of sour cream is ridiculous -  I cut it down to 1/2 cup but I believe it could be cut down to 1/4 cup.  I actually got 23 cup cakes out of the recipe which was nice.  Baking time seems about right although I added a couple minutes to the second baking after the addition of the sour cream, which made it a total of 9 minutes.  I also turned my oven up to 400 for those nine minutes as opening the door twice to pull them and put them back in dropped my temperature fairly significantly.

I have used this recipe in the past and am pretty sure it was edited from the original so these changes took it back to what it used to be.

I used a little over 1/2 cup sugar for the cupcakes, and only 1/4 cup for the sour cream topping.  Also, there was way too much of the topping, could becut in half.  Otherwise, yummy!

I made the topping but added about 3/4 cup of mini chocolate chips and next time would add a little less vanilla to the topping. The amount recommended  was just enough to fit into the dip of the cupcakes. It was so sweet that I could not even taste the cupcake itself. Next time I would use 1/2 cup of sugar. The actual cupcake I was gooey and very good. I used the rule 1 egg per brick of cream cheese rule and only used three eggs.

I used 3 eggs as suggested and they were fine.  Next time I will double the liners and cook them higher in the oven to keep bottoms from toasting too much. Make sure each cup is at least 3/4 full.  Added strawberries of course before serving:)

Tried this, good basic recipe, but here are my alterations:
I used 32oz cream cheese (4 packs)
1 cup sour cream
3 eggs, 1 yolk
1/4 cup flour
1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon nutmeg
1.5 teaspoon lemon zest

I did use a graham cracker crust and baked it beforehand.  I let oven cool, and baked @ 225 degrees for 3 hours and 40 mins with a water bath.  Yes it's a long time, but cheesecake shouldn't be baked at high temps and in my experience, 350 or above caused cracks and sinks.  It came out perfect!! I am topping with strawberry topping from the can, bc I won't have time to make it from scratch.

I thought these turned out well, but definitely just use 3 eggs, and let the sour cream mixture chill for at least 10 minutes beforehand. After adding the sour cream mixture to the cupcakes, I baked them for close to 20 minutes to get it to set. It came out a bit like a meringue. :)

I tried the sour cream topping -  it never set. When I tried a second batch without that, I found that the recipe was bland and oily.

I made these while I was testing different cheesecake recipes for my boyfriend's birthday and they were amazing! I added a thin graham cracker crust- just crushed graham cracker with melted butter- and it really helped balance it out. The only issue I had was how much excess batter I had, but that can easily be adjusted. After they baked I put them in the refrigerator to cool (I'm impatient!) and it helped them set up a lot. For someone who's need made a cheesecake before, I had absolutely no issues with them! Everyone loved them! I would 100% recommend this recipe!

Really good IF you use only three eggs and more vanilla (at least another teaspoon) I also put a scant cup of sugar. Probably I would only give 1 star if I hadn't changed the recipe.
This probably is best to use as only a guideline for cheesecake cupcakes.
Four stars because the recipe should be changed.

This recipe was a huge dissipointment. It called for way to many eggs, and too much sugar. The batter was too runny, and did not rise enough for the amount that you put into the liners. After it's all made the amount of money you spend on the ingrediants,does not rise to the standards of the recipe.  Do your self a favour and just make a regular cheesecake, and I also found it weird that there is no gram cracker crust, which a cheesecake is supposed to have.

This is a crowd pleaser! My husband is gluten intollerant, so I wanted to find a recipe that he can eat. It's his favorite. So easy to make. I don't change a thing about it. I took a batch to work today and had three people ask for the recipe. It's also really good with lemon curd on it.

it sounds wonderful!  did you make a graham cracker crust or use vanilla wafers like a lot of bakers use on tiny cheesecakes?
