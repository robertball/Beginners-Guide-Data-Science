I liked these beans, especially for the ease of prep. I don't normally use the microwave to cook my veggies, or any food for that matter, but I wanted to follow the recipe exactly. Keep in mind microwaves will vary, so I think 4 minutes would be perfect next time in my 1000W microwave.  The servings size is a little on the small size, so I made 3/4 lb instead of 1/2. I kept the chicken granules the same though, and it turned out much too salty for my tastes. This could just be the brand I used (Knorr), but next time I will use about half the stated amount, and also use unsalted butter. I also used less garlic than called for, since the garlic is raw and therefore quite potent.  I will definitely make these again with the minor tweaks.  Even though they were too salty, I ended up eating 4 servings (SHHHH, they were SMALL servings!)  Thank you Chelsey for the quick and tasty recipe!

Deluxe Garden Green Beans Haiku: "We DO love garlic, just not a tablespoon's worth. Killed the beans for us." Love garlic, love butter, love green beans - really, what's not to love about this recipe? Oh and did i mention it's super easy?? Unfortunately 1/2 lb. green beans to 1 TB of garlic was just too much garlic for us. Will definitely make this again and again w/ garlic reduced!

5.12.18  Just 2-1/2 minutes in my microwave pot, a little butter  and chicken bouillon, some chopped garlic, and on the table.  Love side dishes like this one, and itâ€™s delish!

Use only half the chicken broth. Too thin with 2 cups even after cooking time.

4.5 I love garlic so this was great!!!  Would halve the amount of chicken granules to cut down on the salt.

I diced a fresh garlic clove, but otherwise followed this basic recipe.  Fresh tasting, quick, and easy - what's not to love?
