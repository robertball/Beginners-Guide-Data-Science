I thought this was very good, but really felt it was much, much better the second day. They definitely needed more seasoning. I think I just added more black pepper and salt. I love all the different veggies and the rice of course is what stuffed peppers is all about.

These are good, even for bf and I, who aren't big fans of stuffed peppers.  I think my issue with stuffed peppers is the rice, so I just left it out and used another 1/2 c each of cabbage and zucchini.  I'm surprised bf asked for these, as he doesn't like peppers at all, but he really seemed to like them--he had two.  I added seasoned salt and Old Bay to the veggie and meat mix, but it still seemed a bit bland.  I did, however, use ground turkey and it often needs more seasoning.  I'd just use a lot more garlic and seasoning next time.  I used fresh tomatoes and added V8 tomato juice to add some liquid; I think I added a bit too much, though--two cans would've been fine as opposed to the three I used.  I like the method of boiling the peppers--baking always seems to toughen them up, but they were the  perfect texture.  Bf only bought 6 peppers, so we ended up with leftover filling.  We think it would be good on tortillas for a different type of fajita, so we'll try that next.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used Orzo instead of rice.  I also topped the peppers with fresh mozzarella and then baked them till the cheese was melted.  They were delish!

This was really good.  I only had green peppers, and I think red and yellow peppers would have been much better.  The filling was really tasty.  I forgot to drain the beef which made the dish pretty greasy, but next time I still wouldn't drain it thoroughly and leave behind some juices.  I also seasoned the meat just a little with some garlic powder, salt and pepper before adding the rest of the stuff.

While I'm not normally a big fan of peppers, this recipe looked really good so we decided to give it a shot. We used brown rice and it was absolutely delicious and filling. Thanks!

This recipe was easy and delicious!  A great spin on the winter dish my mom used to make.  I substituted with ground turkey and added yellow squash.  The only problem I had was getting the rice to cook!  It took waaaay longer than stated.  Eventually, I had to add water to get it took cook at all.  I will make this dish again, but cook the rice while the first part is cooking to save time at the end. Thanks for the new recipe.

I was excited about this recipe, but found that the beef needed way more seasoning than I expected, and even still it was bland.  It was okay, but I'll most likely not be making this again.

I think this is a perfect summer recipe with the mild sweetness of the added brown sugar. I've made this for several family members and they've all loved it.
