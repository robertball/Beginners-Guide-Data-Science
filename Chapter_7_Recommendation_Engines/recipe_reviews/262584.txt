Made this for Easter.  I  was excited to see a Babka recipe made without yeast.  However, I found it a bit dry and not a true Babka.  Babka with Almond?   I brought it to an Easter brunch and people who have never had a real Babka thought it was delightful.  They probably would give it 5 stars.  Will I make it again?  Probably not.
