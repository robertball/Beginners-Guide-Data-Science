The taste was good, but the asparagus really needed to be cooked a little bit longer.  Maybe 8 - 10 minutes.

I added a sprinkle of Romano fresh grated cheese (Parmesan fresh grated works too) and it really peeked flavor...just a sprinkle for flavor and donâ€™t smother it.....YUMMMM.  My husband who hates vegetables even liked it.

Super simple and full of flavor. My only complaint is that 5 minutes was too long. It got overcooked and soggy. My micro does seem to be pretty potent though. Next time I will start at 3 minutes and go from there.
