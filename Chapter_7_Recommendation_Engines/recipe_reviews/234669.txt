Great way to use leftover quinoa! Added nice crunch and made it feel healthier! I used white whole wheat flour, filled one loaf pan 3/4 full, and there was enough for 2 small pans as well. Plan to make again! Thank you for the great idea!!

This was very good. I replaced the canola oil with coconut oil and left out the walnuts because hubby is allergic to them and kids don't like them. It was moist but a bit crumbly. I love pumpkin and it was delicious with all the spices. I am new to using quinoa so was looking for recipes to use some and think this is a winner. It looked to me like there was too much batter for only one loaf pan so I baked mine in 2 loaf pans. They came out shorter, but just don't think it would have all fit in one.
