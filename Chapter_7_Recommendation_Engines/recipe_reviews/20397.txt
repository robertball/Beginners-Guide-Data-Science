Excellent generic BBQ Sauce.  By the way, Brown Sauce is a generic term for a British all-purpose table sauce.  Americans call it Steak Sauce (A1 Sauce, Heinz 57, etc).

What is brown sauce? I substituted black sauce and used light soy sauce instead of dark. Hoping it would even out.

I was confused by the brown sauce also and just left it out. Was good, my family liked it with fried chicken. Thanks for the post!

This was really good. We enjoyed it very much! I made homemade brown sauce: which is apparently steak sauce. I also used diet soda. It was a bit thin.. but it worked for us. If I wanted to thicken it.. could just heat on stove with corn starch. :)
