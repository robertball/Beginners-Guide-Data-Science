I wanted to fix it in a way that I knew my family would most enjoy - I cut up my apples and put them in the crock pot, then topped with the mixture, and then poured the apple juice over it all.  Cooked on low for almost three hours - Perfect!  We served them with some delicious vanilla ice cream - Sooo good!

...can't type right now...too busy drooling and licking my spoon!  This was so very yummy!  It wasn't overly sweet and paired nicely with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  And while cooking, this made my house smell like heaven!

This is so darned easy!  Tip: If you peel a strip of the apple peel around the middle of the apple they actually hang together better - it allows room for the apple to expand.  3 hours was just perfect for my apples.  The slow cooker liners make clean up a breeze.  I didn't use raisins, some of my eaters don't care for them so I just left them out.  I did 4 apples in a 6 quart crock and there was actually room for at least two more.  I can see doing these on practice nights, start them before leaving for practice and by the time you are home and had dinner they will be done and waiting to be devoured.  Thanks for a nice recipe.  I love those slow cooker liners!

This was ok for us but maybe this was my fault for using quick cooking oatmeal but Idk if that would make or break this recipe. I also believe we would have enjoyed It more if I would have removed the apple skins completely before cooking.  I'm not sure if the apples are supposed to be tender or downright soft and mushy because that's how mine turned out after 3 hours on low.  The flavor was good and not too sweet so as others mentioned, very good on vanilla ice cream. I would make this again as it is a great dessert recipe that takes minimal work and attention, but peel the apples before cooking and also check their tenderness after 2 hours or so.

Super easy recipe & with the Reynold's liners, snap to clean up! Rocks with vanilla bean ice cream or by itself (I had to test both out ;) ) I added pecans to the crumble filling/topping for a bit more texture..  YUM! Will make this again for sure.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. I didn't have high hopes for this for some reason but they smelled fantastic cooking. These reminded me of apple crisp made easy. The slow cooker liners make for easy clean up. Love them little gems!

I took a cue from another reviewer and sliced up my apples and layered them on the bottom.  Other than that change, I stuck to the recipe.  My house totally smells delicious and the vanilla ice cream pairs so well with it!  Easy dessert and anything in the slow cooker makes my dayâ€¦especially when I don't have to CLEAN said slow cooker.  Great fall dish - will make again, possibly with dried cranberries next time!

Made this for a big group and it was an unqualified success.  Used golden raisins and the 50:50 brown sugar & Splenda mix, cooked for only 2 hours not 3, and served with icecream- yum!  Had to use quick-cooking oats because that's all this rented vacation home had, but it didn't seem to make a difference. The gang scarfed them down anyway.
Don't forget to make a slit around the equator of the apple to allow it to retain its shape more gracefully.

The picture does not do justice for the taste or ease of this dish! Great ingredients and the best part is no clean up! The apples turned into a wonderful dessert that was a nice surprise with minimal effort! They went fast. I will always use Reynolds Slow Cooker Liners for anything I make in the slow-cooker from now on. And so will my family- I shared some with them and we wonder why we soaked after every use. We soak no more! With the cold months coming I plan on using my slow cooker every day and this makes it so easy. Best idea for the slow cooker since the slow cooker!

I like the smell of the house, but the taste of the dish was not to my liking.  Even with all the sugar from the raisins, brown sugar, and apple juice, it was very tart and not sweet. Not sure where I might have went wrong. Also, I recommend checking them after 2 hours as mine were complete mush at 3 hours.
