Alright.  This recipe has an additional, unecessary step.  The lime juice cooks the shrimp fully, so the frying of the shrimp just adds an extra step and extra fat.  Skip that and just let it sit in the lime juice for extra time (overnight really helps the texture).  Also, I did this with 1/2 shrimp 1/2 scallops...and I added a dash of splenda.  Try that - really helps the otherwise good recipe!!

If zero stars were a choice, that's what I would give this recipe.  Completely inedible. We Love shrimp and love new recipes, but this one had us ordering out to cover the recipe's blunder.  

Shrimp were VERY tough from the overnight marinade, and only got worse with the frying.  Stay away from this one.

I didn't have any cilantro and really don't care for it much so I just used some parsley mostly for color.  Didn't realize I was supposed to marinade so long, so it only got about 2 hours in the lime juice, but it was still good.  Not my favorite way to have shrimp, but it was refreshing and good for something different.
