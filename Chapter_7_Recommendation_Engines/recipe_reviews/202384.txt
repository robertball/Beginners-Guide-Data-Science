I should have stressed more in the recipe the importance of the tomatoes being firm and meaty -- not juicy.  If you find your tomatoes to be juicy, drain the juice off before adding the tomatoes to the pot.  The more juice you add to the jam, the more watery the result will be.  The first time I made this recipe my jam was a bit more like a sweet spicy sauce - never watery but just more saucy. So, don't give up.  If you liked the flavor try again with firm, meaty tomatoes.

Thank you for this old time delight!  Grandma used to make this for us; always a treat to pop a jar open in winter & remember what a great summer we had.

Mine came out very liquid. I'm going to call it spicy/sweet tomato sauce and serve it on cream cheese. If I make it again I'll drain any juice from the tomatoes after chopping. Flavor is good though.
