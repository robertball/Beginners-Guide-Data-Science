Oh my goodness, I loved this recipe.  It is so easy and tastes so good.  I don't think that I would have thought to pair squash and zucchini with balsamic.  But they go so well together.  I used EVOO instead of butter and I added a clove of chopped garlic.  I have made this two times in two days and I will definitely make it over and over!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was the only one in my family that liked this.  I would of given it a 4 but my husband and kids took one bite and wouldn't eat any more so I'm only giving it a 3.  I followed the recipe exactly but it sure seemed like there was too much vinegar.  I'd recommend using 1 T. and then adding more if you feel it's needed.

Loved the simplicity of this recipe but made a few changes for kicks. Stick with the butter in the recipe and add a couple teaspoons of sugar to the squash while its frying - this will help it caramelize and brown. When it's done, mix in about 1-2T of goat cheese and 2T parmesan. Cheese makes everything better.

My husband is not much of a vegetable eater, and Squash is on his no list. What I did was chopped up two carrots ,let them cook in the butter until they were almost soft. Then added the squash along with two small chopped up leeks that were ;eft from another recipe. And followed the rest of the recipe.  He loved it.  Thank you for this recipe.  I'm going to make this again especially when my daught and her family come to dinner.

This was delicious! I am from the south, and of course have never had fried squash like this. We cover it in salt and either flour or cornmeal or even both and fry the devil out of it. This was so good, that my brother who hasn't took a bite of squash in 23 years ate it and he loved it. Has asked for it several times. Thank you so much for helping me find a way to get my handicapped and very sick brother to eat his squash.....

This recipe was disappointing.  I added one clove of garlic but kept the rest of the recipe the same.  I used a quality Balsamic but the veggies were swimming in the vinegar.  I transferred the veggies out of the pool of vinegar but the flavor was still overpowering.  I will not be making this again with the Balsamic.

This recipe is amazing! Summer squash that actually tastes delicious! And so simple, too. You could also try mixing the browned squash cubes with cooked green peas, corn, or diced carrots. A keeper for sure.

When I made this I really cut back on the balsamic vinegar.  I added about 1/2 of a tablespoon and the taste was pretty good.  I added another 1/2 of a tablespoon and the recipe went to yuck.  Then I tried to add more salt and grated parmesan cheese to salvage it and to me it came out with a strange taste.  It tasted like I put mayonnaise on it.  I don't like mayonnaise so this didn't work for me at all, even after the revisions.      I was thinking that if you used a very sweet, desert style balsamic it would work, but not with your regular primarily sour balsamic.

A recipe in AARP magazine called for julienning zukes and yellow squash.  Didn't know how to julienne, so watched a demo on youtube.  I was dismayed to find out I was supposed to throw away the parts of the squash that I squared off, so I saved them and found this *wonderful* and simple recipe to use them in!  I used olive oil instead of butter, added two cloves of garlic (I love garlic and it's so *good* for you), and a bit of shallot.  Yummy!  Thanks for the recipe.

My family hated this recipe.  I suppose it could be personal taste, but I didn't even use as much vinegar as the recipe suggested and it was way too much of a vinegar taste.  No one would eat it.  :o(

I made this for a dinner party with a very diverse group of people and everyone liked it.  I did add a little sauteed garlic and onion to the recipe.  It is important to use a high quality  balsmic vinegar.

The balsamic vinegar just didn’t work with these vegetables, it smelled and tasted weird. I tried adding some parmesan cheese but it didn’t help. I won’t be trying this again.

Not bad, but not great (but I'm not a huge fan of balsamic vinegar unless it's in salad dressing).  If I make it again I'll probably cook on higher heat; I though the veggies were too soggy but I liked the crispy texture of the browned parts.

Pretty good.  I used nowhere near the amount of balsamic vinegar--it would've been drowning in it, and I sliced instead of dicing the squash.  No other reason that I prefer how it looks sliced.  I also tossed in some already steamed green beans to the dish for a little varity.  Even though I used very little balsamic, bf was a bit turned off by the vinegar, so a nice recipe to try but apparently not one to try again at our house.  He's picky about vinegar though, and that is not the recipe's fault.  I liked it well enough.  Thanks for the recipe!

This receipe was excellent. I usually cut my squash in rounds but I try to follow recipes so since this receipe called for the squash to be diced that’s what did, in medium sized chunks. I didn’t have zucchini so I diced four medium sized yellow squash. After the garlic, I seared the squash in about 2 table spoons of butter on medium for about 3 mins then an additional minute on medium high to brown it. After it was finished I used half the suggested basalmic vinegar the receipe called for, only because other reviewers indicated it was too much. The squash was firm and delicious. Also, instead of dumping the squash into the plate along with all that butter or oil I used tongs to pick the squash from the pan and placed it in the plate.

5.22.16   Spiraled the zucchini and squash and added some sliced onion.  It looked so bright and fresh that I was concerned regular balsamic would darken the color, so I used milder white balsamic.  And I will use white balsamic again, as it doesn't overpower the flavor of the mild veggies.  Totally fresh tasting with just a subtle layer of flavor from the balsamic, so easy, so tasty, and so good for you, too!  Sautes quickly, so don't overcook, or you'll have mush.  If you like zucchini and squash, you really should give this a try!

I've made this twice, the first time exactly as written, which I found had too much balsamic for my taste.  The second time added the balsamic to the pan at the end, and used less of it.  It was excellent.  I find the key is timing - don't over cook the zucchini and serve it right away or it can get soggy.  Great recipe overall, and one of the quickest ways to add flavor.  Thanks!

I sautéed two cloves of garlic in the skillet before adding the zucchini (no squash). I added the balsamic to the skillet and cooked it down. Added sea salt and dill, removed from skillet and sprinkled with grated parmesan. Delicious.

this would be good as broiler roasted with olive oil. seasoning salt roll the vegetable's in olive oil. about 1 tbsp just to coat the squash lightly (should look shiny  preheat oven at 400 put squash in a non stick cake or pie tin. pu tin oven let roast 4  to 6 min stir let cook another 4 to 6 min should have some brown roasting color when you pull out of oven sprinkel with lemon juice fresh or bottled and some seasoning salt johnies is a good one. and serve I do most fresh garden vegetables this way

This is a very easy and tasty way to prepare summer squash.  The balsamic vinegar and butter are both necessary to get the right taste, though.

I really liked this, but was the only one in my family who did.  I only add about 1 or 1 1/2 TBSP of vinegar.  Its a little time consuming.
