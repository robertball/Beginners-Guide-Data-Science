I tried this recipe as-is the first time, and found it to be a little too sweet for my taste.  So, I used fresh blueberries in place of the preserves and opted not to top it off with anything more than a dusting of powdered sugar and a little dollop of fresh whipped cream.  The fresh fruit toned down the sweetness and was a really nice contrast to the cheese filling.  This was a fun dish to make and I think the possibilities are endless, as far as the fillings and toppings go!  Thanks!

So Yummy!! Could not bring myself to use mozzarella cheese so I used Queso Fresco. Worked Fabulous! I added a dash of vanilla and powdered sugar. My DD doesn't like hot fruit and pastry/bread types together so we added chocolate chips. Cheese n chocolate all in one was a winning combo! How do you satisfy a house full of Hungry teenagers?? Serve stuffed french toast for Dinner!! Thank You Renee :):) Keeper!
