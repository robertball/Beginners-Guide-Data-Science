When asked how this recipe compares to just the regular Rice Krispies bars, my granddaughters declared that these are the best!  I do think that if left to their own devices that they would have finished off the whole pan by themselves.  I cut mine into heart-shaped pieces with a cookie cutter, and they started out just wanting the remnants!  So they learned a new word at the same time they more than satisfied their sweet teeth!  Thanks, CLField!

I made this without the peppermints and it was excellent, the kids loved it. I think I'm going to try mixing in a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips next time... yum :)

I used an entire 16oz bag of mini marshmallows, 4 Tbsp butter, and 15 red and 15 green chopped up hard peppermint candies. (Did not add vanilla.) I buttered the pans first, sprinkled some red and green chopped candies in patterns in the pans. Made the treats, adding the rest of the red and green candies separately, then squishing the treat into the decorative bundt pans. Very tasty and pretty!

I LOVE these! I used soft peppermint candies that I crushed and thought it was perfect. I think hard peppermint, like candy canes, would be too hard and not compliment the rice krispy treats very well but the soft peppermint candies were perfect. Have taken them to several get togethers and people are always asking for the recipe.
