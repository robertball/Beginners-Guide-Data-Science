My Jordanian husband makes this all the time.  I don't care for the chicken with bones so he uses boneless skinless chicken breast and just reduces the boiling time.  He also uses a pinch of saffron while soaking the rice... it gives it a nice flavor.

I submitted this recipe, and I would just like to say that you can add chopped carrots to this dish as well The sweetness is wonderful. Also, most of the time I do add maggi cubes (chicken bouillon cubes). Use at least one cube, remember to salt after you add the cubes since chicken stock is salted. Also over the years I have started to add a little more spices, try adding 1 tsp of cumin or curry. It's great.

This recipe is for a difficult middle eastern dish that i have had for years with friends and its perfect.  I recently made it for my friends and they absolutely loved it, i gave this recipe out to many people.  And as for the measurements of allspice its perfect it tastes just like how arabic food should taste, not bland!!  Thanks imankay, look forward for more recipes from you.

Makloubeh is a traditional Middle Eastern dish that I first had in Jordan.  I remember my mother making it and am now making it for my children.  A few steps but fairly easy and so yummy.  Plus the house smells great while it's cooking!

Good recipe.  It is a bit time consuming and frustrating since you need 3-4 different pots to make it the wasy suggested but I am sure the end result is very pretty.

Mine did not look that pretty but tasted good.  I'd make it again.

made exactly as described. Smelled nice. Was EXTREMELY mild - could use a lot more spices. I was disappointed. My kids ate it the first night, but wouldn't finish the leftovers. Had to throw the rest away - and this makes a LOT. Won't be making again.

Absolutely wonderful!  I substituted beef instead of chicken.  The only thing I think it could have used some salt and oil.

Good recipe!  I usually mix the rice and cauliflower together and, instead of potatoes, I use fried eggplant between the chicken and the rice.  After flipping this dish over (maklooba), I brown some pine nuts and sprinkle on top.

This dish is the family favorite. A few ingredients I would like to add. For veggies, you can also add eggplant. Califlower is the more traditional way, but my husband prefers broccoli, and it's very good. I also add chick peas with the vegetables. Spices, I add ground cinnamon, salt, chicken bullion. I add this to the chicken, while its boiling, and I also sprinkle all the spices to the rice before adding it to the pot. Sprinkle toasted silvered almonds before serving.

Great recipe thanks a lot. I had this on my visit to Palestine and this recipe was much better than what I had. I used eggplant and cauliflower.  I also saw some people use carrots in it.  Its good that way too.

This dish was both bland and odd tasting and all the allspice gave it a dull appearance.  DH  went to make toast for his supper.

Very good.  It looks and smells delicious, but I have to admit that it needs more spice...especially salt.

Wow is this ever good! I cheated and used a 10 pound turkey instead of a chicken (it's what I had) and doubled the rest of the ingredients, but it turned out delicious, probably better than with chicken.

I made it with chicken breast instead, and I didn't have the tomatoes. It had a good flavor, but next time I would add some salt to the recipe.

I had a few issues : I made it and added carrots like  many of the other posters.  That was good. It was so bland I needed to add 1 Chicken bouillon cube To the chicken cooking water  and a Tablespoon Of curry and then another bouillon cube when adding the rice. That worked.  But I noticed when it says to add 1 1/2 tablespoons allspice in the second half of the recipe but the ingredients say 2 tablespoons.  So I just went with the 1 1/2 T In the second part. The other issue is that the photo looks great.  But my chicken, rice and most everything else was all brown from using all that allspice. The last thing is I decided to check it at 15 minutes because I brought the broth to a boil before adding and wouldn’t you know that the rice was tender. I carefully let it cook about 10 minutes longer but there is no way to cook an hour since I used boiling broth.

I made a version of this with a Jordanian friend of mine and it is truly amazing. It was my first experience with Arabic cuisine. My friend stuffed the bird with a mixture of spiced rice and ground lamb and used fried cauliflower and fried eggplant. I also think she used some tumeric. This was for a post ramadan feast. Thank you for posting!
