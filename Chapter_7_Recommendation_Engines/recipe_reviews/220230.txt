This was good, but I changed the cooking method to make it, what I thought, a little easier:

Cook the garlic and shallots.  
Lower the heat and add the spinach.  
Add the artichoke hearts.  
Add wine (not sure the wine is necessary).  

I cooked the salmon on the grill without the pesto, but added more pesto to the entire dish.

My husband and & I really liked this, but it was a little complicated.  Not wanting to turn the oven on, I pan fried the salmon, then used the same pan for everything else - removing as much of the pesto from the salmon as possible so it didn't burn & turn the meal bitter.  It worked great and the flavors worked well together.  I look forward to having leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

My husband and I loved the recipe.  I actually doubled the red pepper flakes, because we do like the extra spice (and it was a definite added kick!).  I also added  extra olive oil that was suggested. Unfortunately I bought the 6oz bag of spinach by accident, but it still turned out great.  It did take a bit longer to cook than expected, but it was well worth it.  We will definitely be making this again! (I would skip the red pepper flakes if you want your kids to try it).

The family really enjoyed this one.  We added about 1/2 cup of chopped sun-dried tomatoes and a tablespoon of capers, also, which we thought were a good addition.

loved this. Baked salmon as recipe indicted with a touch of lemon.   In a pan I sautéed the olive oil a little bit of butter chopped garlic and chopped fresh dill and red pepper flakes. Smelled amazing by then. I added to the oil mixture the artichokes a can of clams and a can of sliced black olives and a chopped tomato I needed to use, Dumped a  big handful of fresh spinach to pan. Once all was warmed I added the salmon and wine. and let simmer for a bit

 Served a nice spoonful over some thick pasta pappale noodles and added the Parmesan cheese   This was so good, would make again Very healthy dinner

I also simplified recipe by sautéing garlic and shallots first then adding in spinach after 3 minutes. I also added 1 tbsp capers with wine and finished with some green onions on top. Cut cheese in half so not too cheesy. Delicious way to serve salmon!

Fresh everything! Wow!  I had to bake the salmon a bit longer. And we had a whole pound of salmon so added it all. Different pasta. Delish! and will do this again. My husband says this is a perfect marriage of many favors. Excitement in every bite.

I was looking for a pasta recipe to use up  a half can of artichoke hearts and some pesto that I had made from this recipe:  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/13937/pesto/

This pasta recipe fit the bill precisely especially with the timdall's recommendation to add sun-dried tomatoes and capers.  So the 5 stars are for the recipe with those additions.  Also, since I was only cooking for one person today, I used 1/3-1/2 of the quantities of the ingredients.   Since  I'm a huge pasta and Parmesan fan and I didn't have much fresh spinach in the frig and I wanted to use up the  artichokes, I halved the pasta and cheese and used the 1/2 can of artichokes.  Everything else, I used 1/3 of the quantity.   Instead of baking fresh salmon, I used a can of Costco's Wild Alaskan Sockeyed Salmon to make it quick and easy.  It worked great, but then, as canned salmon goes, Costco's  is really high quality canned salmon, so don't think I would try with just any canned salmon.  I also used  red onion  instead of a shallot and that worked well too.   It was huge bowl of pasta for one person (and I ate every last bite), but it  could have served two people by adding a salad and some bread.

Both my husband and I really liked this but I did make some changes. I used what I had meaning I didn't use artichokes (my husband doesn't like them) but added sliced black olives.  Instead of just parmesan cheese, I used a mix of various Italian cheese and I only used a small bag of spinach.  Will make again.

I ended up making this recipe as a casserole.  I added the spices in the same pan as the cooked down spinach and also added cayenne pepper and turmeric (cause my husband is Indian and he likes these two spices).  I didn't have artichoke hearts but I did have green olives so I used those instead.  Combined the salmon/pesto, cooked fettuccine noodles, and spinach together with white wine for 10 minutes to blend together and cook down the liquid (even added a little bit of olive juice).  In a casserole dish, I crushed saltine crackers to layer on top and then sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and baked for 15 minutes.  The liquid was dried out and the crackers/cheese gave a good toasted topping.  Hubby liked it!
