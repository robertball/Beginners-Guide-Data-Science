I found Tina's peach cobbler to be exceptional.  It is appetizing in appearance, very tasty, and quick to prepare. Until this recipe I was never able to make homemade crust for a cobbler.   You can use peaches in the can, and I like it served with vanilla ice cream on top.I have gotten several requests to make it for others............Gwen

I re-calculated this recipe for 4 servings.  For the pastry, I only used shortening. I chilled my pastry for about an hour. I removed from the refrigerator and rolled into a rectangle, sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. INSTEAD OF PLACING THE PASTRY FLAT ON THE PEACH FILLING, I rolled the pastry into a log.  I took dental floss and placed it under the log, lifted both ends of the floss, crossed over and made my slices. I greased an 8" x 8" glass baking dish and poured about half of the peach filling in the bottom of the dish. I placed each pastry roll on top of the peach mixture, spooned the remainder of the peach mixture on top of the pastry rolls and baked until golden.  Delicious with vanilla ice cream!

The recipe said to roll out the crust to 9 x 13 and put on top of the peaches but the picture shows the crust appears to be rolled up into "rolls" and placed on the peaches. Does this picture go with this recipe?

Fresh peach filling was very good. Topping was more like pie to me, that's the first time I've done cobbler topping that wasn't crumbly. 
I added cinnamon to the topping as well, and also used all shortening instead of shortening/lard mix.

I made this recipe a couple of weeks ago it is great quick and easy. The previous time I made it I was short on time and just use the prerolled instant dough from the store. The filling is so fovorful it still came out great. Acinnamon sugar mixture sprinkled on top makes it pop.

My first ever peach cobbler that I've made from scratch and it was awesome!  I made it on a whim, didn't have lard, so I subbed shortening for it.  Sooo good!!!

This peach cobbler was absolutely wonderful! I took this to a potluck party and everyone raved about it! the only hard thing was rolling out the crust to fit the pan; for once you place it on the peach sauce you really cant take it off.

This was my first peach cobbler from scratch and I almost was tempted to use pie crust but Im so glad I didnt. My husband is a peach cobbler fanatic but he only can get it around Thanksgiving holidays when his mom cooks it so i wanted to try it for myself. I followed Tina's recipe and i add 1/2 tspn of cinnamon to my peach cobbler mixture and topping crust and all shortening instead of Lard it came out great!!! My husband loved it. I took some over to my mother-in-law's home and let her and my sister try it and they were amazed that it came out so great..My husband said, "it will make you go back for seconds." Now that made my night...Thanks for the recipe

Delicious! I made the crust like the picture...rolled it out to a 9/13 rectangle, sprinkled a little cinnamon on the dough, and then rolled it up and made 1/2 inch slices. The cobbler is beatiful and tasty. I did substitute 1 tsp of cinnamon for the nutmeg because I didn't have any but the flavor is delicious. I will definitely keep this recipe handy.

I was looking for a peach cobbler recipe with more of a pie crust topping. This one was it. This cobbler is SO good. The only thing I did different was to add a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Delicious

Tina, your Peach Cobbler recipe came out exactly like you said. It was such a hit during the Christmas Holidays, I am doubling the size for the Super Bowl.  Thank You So Much.

I grew up in Texas, and this is how my family did cobbler--basically a sweeter, runnier one-crust pie.  I cheated and used a premade pie crust on a extra-deep 9x9 pan, tucking the edges in where the crust hung over, and added cinnamon, ginger, and a splash each of lemon juice and bourbon to the peaches (which I usually can't be bothered to peel).  It sat about an hour and a half before I put it in the oven, and the fruit had plenty of time to mascerate--yum!

Great recipe. Only used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and it still came out plenty sweet. I also replaced the lard with more shortening, and that worked out fine.

My family loves fruit cobblers, and this one is the best I have found.  Don't care for the "cakey" toppings in most recipes.  I used butter Crisco and sprinkled a little cinnamon sugar on top...delicious!

This recipe is fabulous. The crust was wonderful. I rolled it up and made rounds and it was so easy. I put salt in the crust and also put a little cinnamon sugar on top.  Also I did not have enough peaches so i made it with blueberries and strawberries. Still fabulous.  I cut the sugar back as two cups is a lot and added a touch of lemon juice.  I also added some corn starch as that made it a little runny.  This recipe is forgiving and extremely easy to execute.  A dollop of vanilla ice cream... Heaven.

We loved the fruit portion of the cobbler, I thought the crust was bland-so when I heated it for serving I added a spoonful of sugar-and it made it especially yummy. I also used this recipe and stuck it in a pie--the neighbors raved!!!
I am going to use it again today and use a crumble topping.

I used butter not Lard or shortening! Mine looked nothing like the photo. Must be wrong photo. Too sweet for my taste. I would  not make this again
