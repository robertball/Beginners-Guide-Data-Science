I am the submitter of this recipe and I take food safety very seriously! Before submitting this recipe I consulted the Canadian Food Guide which states that fiddleheads are perfectly safe to eat if steamed for 10 minutes. Fiddleheads are a spring staple on the east coast, where I grew up, so I'm very familiar with this product.
