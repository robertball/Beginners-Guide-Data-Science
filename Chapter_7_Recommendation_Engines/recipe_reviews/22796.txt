I have never made theiis recipe  before but just from reading it Have a few suggetions.Beat your whiped cream with 2 teaspoons of sugar and maybe some vanilla. In a glass or dissolve 1 1/s teaspons of plain gelatin in cold waterin a micro waveable safe cup. Its going to congeal but dont worry. pop it in the microwave for 10 seconds and your good to go. I would mush the strawberries up with sugar and let them sit for at leat and hour. Next push the, throuh a strainer. I have seen recipes with as much as 2 cups of sugar before.  you can really youse any amount you whish.combine the liguid gelati whit the strawberries Beat your eggwhitesover a pot of boiling water .they should be stiff peaks. as soon as the eggwhite are warm to the touch remove them but keep mixing untill you get the stiff peaks. for 6 egg whites I would use like 3 teaspoons of sugar. Finally fold the strawberries into the whipped cream and fold the strawberry whipped cream with the eggwhites .refrigerate. That's how you make mousse

I loved the recipe. Having read the other reviews I added extra sugar. I also added a package of of gelatin to help it set up better and prevent weeping. It is still without shape but it does not weep. Next time I will add two packages of gelatin.

Not what I was looking for in a "mousse."  Not sweet enough and I used 3 T. This recipe needs fine tuning--not ready for prime time.

A bit too runny. You probably have to let it chill for an hour or two and use 1/4 tsp cream of tartar.

I was not very happy with this recipe.  The mousse did not set at all and it was not sweet enough.

This recipe needed more sugar or Splenda to bring out the strawberry flavor. I would suggest adding up to a quarter cup to the strawberries, depending on tartness and 1/8 to 1/4 cup to the egg whites and the same amount to the whipping cream. The egg whites and cream would whip up much better with the added sugar.

This is an easy recipe and very quick to make.  I used "Only Whites" instead of real eggs and added kiwi fruit also.  My spouse just love it.  It was very light.

This is so great! Light and quick! I too added a little more sugar to increase the sweetness. I left out the egg whites and froze the mousse. I let it sit on the counter for about 15 minutes before serving and it was great - it had a nice soft and fluffy texture.

I used this as a frosting and added 1 cup unsalted butter and heated the egg whites and sugar.  I used only a little heavy cream just enough to whip the frosting.  I used one cup pureed strawberries and folded them into the frosting.  Very yummy, like real buttercream.

I followed many of the extra suggestions by others and it turned out well.  The original recipe needs to be 'tweeked' however.  Good base, but needs work.

This recipe is succulent. The sugar is enough if your strawberry are sweet. The light taste makes you appreciate  the taste of fresh strawberry. An hour in the fridge will help the texture. We can also add cream of tartar.
