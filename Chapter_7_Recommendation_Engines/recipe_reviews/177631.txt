This was a simple recipe, how ever it lacked some spices. I made a 2nd batch after making the 1st one to a T. So 2nd batch with my tweeks were yummier. I added 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan Cheese to the ricotta along with 1/2 cup Mozzarella cheese, 1/2 tsp salt, 2 tsp dried parsley, 1 tsp dried basil, 1/4 tsp black pepper. I also increased the ground beef to 2 pounds and added 2-3 cloves of minced garlic and increased the jar of sauce to 2. We loved the 2nd batch better then the 1st. It was much more meatier and filling. And followed the instructions on the basic set up. But will agree that it is simple to make and the cost is better then buying a pre-made frozen lasagna any day.

This is a very tasty lasagna, I followed the recipe, the only thing that I changed was that I added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the ricotta cheese mix. And into the ground beef I added chopped onions. It was a very good change. Everyone that was eating just loved it.

l-o-v-e-d it! It was an interesting mix... I've tried other lasagna on this website, but this is my personal favorite!--It had better, softer, and a more squishy texture. I thought it was great compared to the other ones. I did add some triangle jalapino pepperjack cheese on top, cuz' i like spicey foods. Don't get me wrong, it's a favorite in my whole family!

I was only able to fill one of the 2 qt dishes with 1 lb of ground beef.... and even with that, just barely.  I personally like a little more meat in my lasagna, so that could be why, but I still suggest doing at least 1.5 lb.

ALthought asty, i founf the proportions to be waaay off. Barely made one pan's worth. i used around 1.15lbs of meat (recipe says 1 lb)and i only got a layer and a half of meat sauce. that being the case, i scaled back to 2 layers, only 6 noodles used. this was the same with the cheese..not enough.  i will make this recipe again, but with the corrected amounts

I used the "lasagna ready" pasta and cooked the specified time and it still was not done.  I also think the 3 cups of ricotta cheese was too much for this dish.  I baked it uncovered as instructed and it just didn't seem to hit the spot for me or my boyfriend.  Semi-good taste but it needs changes.

I'm a novice cook and I'd never made lasagna before, so I was really nervous about how this would turn out. I followed the basic recipe but made some modifications. Instead of using sauce from a jar, I used 2 15oz cans of tomato sauce and 2 6oz cans of tomato paste seasoned with garlic powder, pepper, and italian seasoning [to taste]. I also used the ricotta modification that mis7up posted and added dried onions, fresh garlic, pepper, and italian seasoning to the beef. I cooked it in a 13x9 pan and had more than enough for the 6 people I served. It was a HUGE hit!

I used this as my template for my first attempt at lasagna. I added chopped spinach to the ricotta and mushrooms, garlic, and onions to the ground beef. I feel that if I had left those ingredients out, I would have had a much more boring dish. My lasagna was amazing!

No thrilled with this recipe.  I doubled the ground beef as suggested and added Italian spices to the cheese mixture about three hours prior to baking.  Seemed bland and blah.  If you're really craving lasagna, it might hit the spot, but I wouldn't serve it too proudly.

It was a good basic recipe. I used Ragu garden mix instead of Prego. And I followed Mis7up's way and it tasted so amazing!

Love this Lasagna, I add  1 cup more of riccotta & Mozzarella and 1 more egg plus 2 cloves of fresh crush garlic, some basil and oregano, and it is fab, and I have enough to freeze for another day. I also need more noodles.

Ok, i made it for my family of 5.  Only difference i had was more meat (was cheaper to buy a big quantity rather then 1 lb each) so i used 5 lb's (ish) of burger added onions but everything else was the same.  Oh i forgot to mention i tripled the recipe. I made 2 9x13 pans and 1 ..roasting pan full (if not overfull) was great for someone who hasn't made lasagna before and wonderful taste. I admit could use spices but if your a family who likes to taste their meat ... then this is the recipe for you.  All 5 of us liked it

My Grandmother is ill and my Grandfather is on his own for a few months, so I made massive quantities of this, and it was excellent. I've heard great reviews and freezes really well apparently. I add some basil and oregano, and used more meat as some people siad it wasn't meaty enough, and it worked out wonderfully! I'm making it again today for a birthday supper! Definitely reccomend it!

This was great!  I used LaFamiglia Del Grosso "Sunday Marinara" sauce, and it made all the difference.  An expensive sauce, but totally worth the money!  I also used a six-cheese Italian blend instead of plain Mozzarella cheese.  This was a great recipe!

First time ever cooking lasagna, I had some trouble figuring out the layering portion (What goes first, second, etc.) but I did what I thought looked good, either way it was going to be eaten and it came out AMAZING. Best lasagna hands down that I have ever eaten. GREAT recipe. Gonna use it again and again.

Just took it out of the oven. The only changes I made was to add minced onion to the hamburger as it was cooking, minced garlic and dried basil to the meat sauce, 2 cups mozzarella to the top. I would have given this a 5 but the measurements were off a bit. Next time I will use 2lbs of hamburger and 2 cans of the sauce. {I prefer Hunts 4 cheese blend for sauce, not as sweet as the jar sauce. Tastes more authentic). And 4 cups of ricotta cheese.

It's a LOT more cheese than meat sauce -- which might be ok if it wasn't called "hearty" lasagna and look very meaty in the photo.  Also, while I like Prego sauce for spaghetti, it was too sweet for lasagna.  I'll find another recipe.

This was a very good recipe! I only made a few tweaks for my taste. I added garlic salt & italian seasoning to the cheese mixture. I also used a combination of ricotta, mozarella, pepper jack & parmesan. I sauteed onions & 2 large cloves of minced garlic with a 1/2 pound of ground pork sausage & a pound of ground beef. I used 1 1/2 jars of Tomato & Basil pasta sauce and added some oregano, parsley & basil. I used no-cook lasagna noodles. I  baked for about 35 minutes until cheese on top was starting to brown.

This made one huge lasagna.  I added fresh garlic and oregano to the sauce, used fat free ricotta, and sprinkled extra mozzarella on top for the last few mins. of baking, and it was great.

I was hoping for something a bit more exciting given the reviews. But the cheese was bland, a bit runny and the jar sauce lacked the punch as I expected. This really wasn't any different than the recipe on the box of lasagna noodles or even the frozen S brand lasagna. I'm still looking for the perfect recipe.

Very easy & very good!  Made some minor changes....I used Prego three cheese sauce, and used half ground beef & half Italian sausage to give it just alittle more flavor.

This is the first time I've made lasagna with egg and ricotta.  No wonder my OTHER lasagna wasn't very good (made it like my mom used to).  Well, it was terrific.  I actually made 16 pans of this for a dinner and even the mayor complimented the "chef" during his speech.  I will use this from now on.  BTW...I made it a week ahead, I did NOT cook the noodles, I then froze it.  I took it out the night before and placed in the fridge and then let it sit out all day.  I baked at 325 for two hours and let sit 30 minutes before serving.  Perfect.

Wonderful recipe and so easy to make. I threw in some spinach with the cheese and egg mixture and it's to die for!

I cooked 2 pounds of ground beef with 1 yellow onion. I used 4 cups of cottage cheese (lower cal than ricotta)  and added a few tablespoons of PHILADELPHIA Creamy Pesto Cooking Creme to the cheese layers. I used about 2 cups of Parmesan-- a little to mix in the cheese layers and the rest for the top. I used our own favorite brand of spaghetti sauce. Turned out well.

Easy, cheesy and so good! Made mine in a 9x12, so I didn't use all the lasagna noodles, but oh well! Cooked it covered with foil for about 30 mins at 400, and then uncovered for another 10-15 mins.

Doubled the meat, and used ground buffalo.  My family likes it hearty!  Also used whole wheat pasta, for a healthier alternative...kids didn't even notice!   Otherwise, followed the recipe and made two pans...froze one for another night.  Family loved it!

I just made this 30 minutes and my family love. I'm only 15 and I'm passionate about cooking so for me this food wasn't so hard but it takes a while to make...

It was my first attempt at lasagna and it was amazing! Used a 3qt pan and a 2qt pan and it filled them up. I will definitely used this recipe again and maybe add some cottage cheese to it.

Good, okay, nothing to write home about.  Will try one of the other lasagna recipes next time, maybe one with spicy sausage.
