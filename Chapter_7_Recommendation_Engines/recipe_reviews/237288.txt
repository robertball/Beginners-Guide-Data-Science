The flavor is dead-on chai and smells delicious!  I had to add a bit of sweetener right before eating bc I used unsweetened almond-coconut milk. This definitely requires way more liquid though. I made it exactly as written and ended up having to add another 3/4 cup of milk. I made it the night before around 11pm and when I went to eat it in the morning around 7am, it was one big solid mass that could barely be stirred. With the additional milk though, it was still thick, but a very good consistency. Normally for overnight oats, the standard guideline is a 2:1 ratio of liquid/yogurt to oats, so this recipe would work best with 2 cups of milk.  Cardamom is quite pricey, but it definitely makes this recipe so don't leave it out!

Easy to make. I don't recommend steel cut oats.

I used this on regular  quick oats on the stove top, not overnight and it was delicious!  Took 6 minutes from start to finish.  Spices were perfect!  
I added honey for sweetener (probably 2 Tablespoons) and just regular milk.  Yum!

This tasted good after I added another cup of milk and heated it in the microwave. It was just too thick for me, and I did not like it cold. The spices were good, but I think those could have been doubled too. I really liked the cardamom in it.

This was delicious!  I agree with others that an extra 3/4 cup of milk is needed to make the consistency better.  I add a touch of agave to sweeten it, skip the cardamom (sub an extra 1/4 tsp of cinnamon) and add a touch of cloves, since I love them. It smells and tastes more like an oatmeal cookie to me, so next time I'll add raisins too!  I portion this out for breakfasts at work, and add a few slivered almonds or walnuts on top.  So good and filling! This will absolutely remain on my breakfast rotation.

This recipe was very good! It took less than one minute the night before to mix everything up and put it in the fridge to be ready for the morning! I threw in some raisins to add texture but other than that I kept everything the same. The only thing I would recommend is to add a fourth of a cup or so more of the milk because it was a little too dry for me as written.

I LOVED this - although admit I made a couple of major adjustments.  I didn't have any almond or coconut milk, so used full milk because that's what I had on hand.  I wanted this to taste sweet so added 2 tsps. of Swerve. I didn't have shredded coconut, and honestly, am not sure I would add it to my next batch even if I did have it.  I will, however, get some almond milk for the next batch and see if that's as good.

This will definitely be my go-to breakfast.  So DELICIOUS!!!

I made this recipe, the only thing I changed was that I halved the recipe and added some fruit. For me, the full recipe would have been too much. But it was very easy to modify the amounts. I think it tastes great which surprised me because there weren’t any sweeteners added :) (the coconut came sweetened already). I do agree with other reviews that it needs a little more milk- I added more in the morning and it worked out fine. I will definitely make this again! So easy

I followed it exactly. It came out good. My almond/coconut milk was unsweetened, so not that much sugar. I topped with golden raisins and walnuts. I did add a little stevia sweeter, which gave me the type of sweetness I was looking for. I have half cut oats. Next time, I'll try it with steel cut oats and wholes oats to measure consistency. Very healthy way to start the day.

I add chopped dates to it for sweetness. It is the addition that makes this recipe perfect.

Made this exactly as written and it’s very good - but would increase the spices (double?) for my personal taste.  Loved the crunch, too!  Thanks for a good recipe!

amazing! I put crushed black tea leaves & a bit of black pepper in mine, dropped the coconut, (I didn't have any) &  used milk & honey. It tasted great, all the same. I put blueberries on top, too. My brother wanted to make him one the next day!

I didn't have cardamom or nutmeg, so am going to try it with those when I make it again. It was a little dry - maybe add a little more almond milk this time

definitely tastes like chai but it needs a sweetener like honey. I made it in 16 oz jars and just filled the milk to the top which made it a bit runny. I also added pineapple which I DO NOT recommend. overall it was a bit bitter but I have another jar with raisins which I think will taste better.

This was the first time I'd ever tried overnight anything. Turned out pretty tasty. I had old fashion oats so that's what I used. Tried the 2:1 ratio for liquid but I think next time I will use a little less. It was a tad too soupy for me. Other than that the spices were very flavorful.

Excellent! I did add some Sugar in the Raw since I used unsweetened coconut and unsweetened almond milk.

This was very good, and easy, but I will make a few adjustments for next time:

Adding about 1/4 cup of almond milk per serving
Reducing the amount of ginger
(If using unsweetened almond milk) add 1 tsp white sugar per serving

Much more flavorful and healthy than the average bowl of cereal or oatmeal.  Will be making again

I loved it, but I made it without the cardamom. I could not afford it at 12.45 per spice jar (at Walmart for heaven's sake.) It was pretty good anyway, but I should have waited till next pay day to spring for it. I'll bet it will be even better then. I'll let you know.
