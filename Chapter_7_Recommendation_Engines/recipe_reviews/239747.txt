Yum, yum. Authentic Italian "fast food". This catapulted me back to my time in Rome and Genova: hot focaccia and mortadella at any time of the day or night! The addition of tomatoes, basil and mozzarella are heavenly. I made this in a gluten free version for me and regular versions for everyone else. I left them out for the kids' after school study group and got unanimous thumbs up! I suggest using semolina (course ground) rice flour for dusting a gluten free version. It will keep your dough from drying out too much. I didn't use a baking stone, just a regular pizza pan with holes in it. It took me about 16 minutes (total) for the gf dough and about 18 minutes (total) for the regular dough. Thank you Kim's Cooking Now! for bringing the panificio into my home!
