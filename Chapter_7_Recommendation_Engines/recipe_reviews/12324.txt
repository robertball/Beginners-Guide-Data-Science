This was delicious!  I added a few touches to it, also.  I mixed the apples with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, stirred in the sugar and 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken the juices.  After adding the top crust, I brushed on an egg wash ( 1 egg beaten with 1 tablespoon milk)and sprinkled 1 tablespoon of sugar.  I placed the glass pie dish on a baking sheet to prevent any spill-over from dripping onto the oven's floor.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I added 1-2 TBLS lemon jiuce, 2 TBLS flour, 1/2 teas vanilla 1/4 teas nutmeg and used brown sugar instead of white. Then mixed the seasonings with the apples before putting it in the crust.  I won first prize at a local Farmer's Market apple pie contest so thanks! I cooked it longer- more like 55 minutes so next time will do the 10 minutes at 450, then 40 minutes at 375 I think will work great. It might be my stove so just wait until it is bubbling.

I have made this pie several times to the point of not needing the recipe anymore. Even though it's simple, people rave over it! 

I recently began to add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, and it gives a wonderful flavor. Also, I spray my pie pan with Butter flavored nonstick spray, so it's easy to serve (I do cheat and use the refrigerated crusts).

I like to dash the crust with a little butter, sugar, and cinnamon.

I changed some stuff and it came out a lot better the 2nd time. I did 2/4c brown and 1/4 white sugar instead of 3/4c white sugar. I put some nutmeg in it also. On top of the latice i mixed 1 egg and some milk and egg washed the top of the pie and then sprinkled it with white sugar. I had to bake it about 10 minutes longer. Just wanna make sure you wait for the juices in the pie to bubble before removing from the oven.

This turned out wonderfully!  Thanks to all the AllRecipes members who suggested adding some flour to the mix!  I tossed the apples in the sugar, cinnamon, nutmet and 4tbsp flour together before pouring it into the crust and the filling turned out juicy but not runny.  Delicious!  My husband wondered how I had gotten his grandmother's recpie!

I used premade crust and added two tsp flour, a little nutmeg, and sprinked the apples with lemon juice. I also used 2 tsp butter and sprinkled the top crust with sugar before baking. My family raved about it. I used granny smith apples, but want to try other kinds.

This pie was very good but we don't understand the layering of the apples and sprinkling process. The second time we tried it we just mixed the apples with the mixture and it tasted much better.

This turned out super!! :)  What a fantastic pie.  It's a keeper!  I did add a few tbsps of flour to the cinnamon sugar mixture so it would "jell" and it turned out perfectly, not runny in the least!

Didn't realize how easy it is to make apple pies. Made this over 5 times already. I added half teaspoon nutmeg to the sugar mixture and 1 tablespoon lemon juice to the apples. Lovely! Everyone loved it.

Made this for thanksgiving and it was delicious! I followed 'Ellen's' alterations and added an extra 1 tsp. of cinnamon so the recipe was as follows: 6 cups Sliced Apples, 3/4 cup Brown Sugar, 2 tsp. Cinnamon, 1.5 TBsp. Lemon Juice, 1/2 tsp. Vanilla, 1/4 tsp. Nutmeg, 2 TBsp. Flour, 1 TBsp. Butter.  Just mixed the apples with all the ingredients except butter (dotted this on top last) and placed it in the shell, made a nice cross-thatch top and popped it in the oven for 45 mins. Mmmm delicious!!

Unfortunately, I read the reviews while my pie was baking. I worried the whole time that it would be runny. I did everything according to the recipe, but did leave it cook about 10 minutes longer until it was brown. We cut into it while it was warm, and it was perfect! The worrying was for nothing. I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing. This is a keeper!  UPDATE:  I put all the sliced apples in a zip-lock bag and poured the cinnamon sugar mixture over them; shook gently, then filled the pie shell.

Wow Carol, this is so much more simple than I thought it was going to be in making homemade apple pie.  Granted I cheated and used store-bought pastry, but I was always intimidated with the filling.  How much easier could it get than throwing 4 ingredients together into a pie plate? My husband didn't believe that I made this!  He actually made me show him the apple peelings in the garbage can LOL!!   Talk about a back handed compliment :-)  This was awesome and I will be making again and again.

The first time I made this pie, I followed the directions and ingredients exactly, and got lots of compliments. The second time and every other time thereafter, I made the following changes to rave reviews...now my whole family requests my apple pies in the fall.
I used 1/3 c. brown sugar and 2/3 c. white sugar, and added small pats of butter throughout the pie as I layered it, and my whole family raved over this pie! This was my first time baking a pie, and it was incredibly easy...this is an excellent recipe!! Thank you, Carol!

Added 4 Tbsp Flour
Added Handful of brown sugar
Added 1/4 Tsp nutmeg 
Added 1 Tbsp Lemon juice to Apples
Added 1/4 tsp of vanilla to Apples
Basted crust with milk and sprinkle with Sugar

Everyone who tried it loved it.  I served it with vanilla ice cream. Mmmmmm.

I added a little more sugar & increased the amt. of cinnamon a bit too.
I used Paula apples(b/c that's what I had on hand)& sprinkled a handful of flour over the top before completing w/the top crust...just so the apples wouldn't be too liquidy!
It was one of the best apple pie I've ever made & I've baked a lot of them!
I highly recommend it.

I followed the advice of others and added 2 tbsp flour and 2 tbsp lemon juice and about 1 tsp of nutmeg.  My husband and 2 kids LOVED this.  My husband said that his whole life, apple pie wasn't his favorite, but if he had been given THIS pie as a child, it would have been his favorite all his life.  Next time, I might add another tbsp of flour just to thicken it up a little bit more, but the flavor was wonderful.

This was my first apple pie and while it did turn out good it wasn't as gooey as I'd like.  I added a couple tablespoons of flour like others suggested, maybe I added too much.

GREAT apple pie recipe!  FAST & EASY!  Everyone asked for the recipe, and then they thought I was holding out on them when they heard how easy it was!  I used the exact measurements and it had wonderful results. Also...I bought pre-made crust in the cold section of the grocery store.  Can't beat this recipe for SPEED OR EASE!  BIG HIT!!!

This was the first "homemade" pie I've attempted, and I'm glad I chose this recipe.  It was so easy and so yummy.  Once I got going on the basics, I tweeked it up a bit adding nutmeg, brown sugar, just a dash.  I used Golden Delicious apples because that's what I had on hand and they tasted great.  Don't know if they are "cooking" apples, but I did it anyway.  Thanks Carol!!!!

I think this is a simple an easy starter recipe. I made adjustments so thats why I gave it a 4star instead of 5 stars. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 cup of white sugar, 2tbsp of flour, 1 tsp lemon juice, and 1/2 tsp of vanillla, once in the pan I sprinkled generously with nutmeg then dabbed with 2tbsp of butter. I finally have a recipe my family loves and can TASTE!! they always say apple pies don't taste like anything.. this has done the trick and am currently making my second one this week right now!

Simply scrumptious. I read through alot of the reviews before I made it and made note of several alterations, which all added to the deliciousness of this pie. The alterations I made were: adding 2 T. flour and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the cinnamon and sugar mixture, sprinkling the apples with 1 T. lemon juice, and dotting the top crust with butter, cinnamon and sugar. My family raved! I'll definitely make this again.

Perfect apple pie recipe, very simple and easy to follow recipe. I've been making apple pies for a while now and find the simpler recipes are better. They let the quality of the apples shine! I also add a little nutmeg as well.

This was my first apple pie. Made it for my friend and his son. He loved it! His exact words were "it's outrageous!"  I just made another for me. I'm sure it will be delish! Thanks to all the people that left reviews. It makes it so much easier.   :)

Thank you to the original poster and also the reviewers for helping me make the perfect apple pie.  First, I used a pre-made pie shell, brushed it with egg white and pricked the bottom and sides.  I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  After thinly slicing the apples I mixed them with 2 Tb of lemon juice to stop them from oxidizing (turning brown).  Then I added 2 Tb of flour and the sugar and mixed it with the apples in a bowl.  Then I poured this mixture into the pie shell, dotted the top with butter and added the top shell.  I also brush the top shell with egg white and sprinkle some sugar.  Then I baked it for about 55 min.  When the edges browned I covered them with foil so they wouldn't burn.  It's very important that you cook apple pie until there is no flowing liquid inside.  This way your pie will not be soggy and will hold up like pie when served.  I serve warm with a scoop of vanilla icecream.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was wonderful.  I don't know why some people are adding flour. I used Granny Smith apples (3 LARGE made 6 cups). Perhaps other apples are a bit more juicy.  The only change I'll make next time is perhaps 1 more apple. (my family said it was just fine like it was!)  And like another review, I used Pillsbury Pie Crust (two in a box) and it was great! This was my first apple pie and I really impressed myself!

I baked two pies using this recipe as written. Used Pillsbury Refridgerated Pie Crusts and Ida Red apples. Took them to a birthday party and got rave reviews from everyone! My sister had more the next day and had to call me to tell me just how wonderful it was. PERFECT recipe for apple pie! Pure and simple. I'm baking another now, using apple pie spice instead of just cinnamon. Yum! Great with ice cream on top too, of course. I also found I had no need to cover the edges of the pie with foil for some reason. I'm not sure if it's the crust I used, or because I turned the oven down to 325 and just let it bake a bit longer. Either way, we were quite happy. And to make sure your bottom crusts are totally done... use a pyrex pie plate, so you can take the pie out and LOOK at the bottom to check for browning. Works every time!

Wow! This is one good apple pie.  I followed the recipe and took the advice of others and added 2 tablespoons of flour and 1 tsp of nutmeg to the sugar/cinnamon mixture.  I've never baked a homemade apple pie before and received raves for this one.  My sister-in-law has asked for the recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

This apple pie recipe has quickly become the ONLY apple pie that I'll ever need!   It's perfect every time!  I use at least two varieties of apple for a varied crispness/sweetness in my pie!  You're gonna love it!!

I have been using this recipe for the past 3 Thanksgivings, as my responsibility is always to make a great apple pie.It has always turned out great-tastewise and look. I have found that if you want your top crust on your pie to look nice and golden-brown, you should brush some milk onto the crust and then sprinkle with sugar. I use Granny Smith apples and toss with 3-4 tbps. flour, sugar, cinammon, and a small amount of nutmeg. This year I have been requested to make 2!:)

This was the first time I tried making my own apple pie and to let other first timers know, put the whole 6 cups of apples in the pie crust even though it looks like there are too many, they cook to fit. I did what others said and tossed the apples in the sugar, cinnamon and flour. It came out great! My 14 yr. old ate 6 slices so I had to make another one. 

Thanks for a great recipe!

Cover the crust edge with strips of tin foil until the last 10 - 15 min. to avoid burning.

This was amazing, however it's important to add flour, or cornstarch and the fact that the original recipe doesn't include this is why I docked a star. I added 3 tablespoons of flour. Lemon is a personal preference, some add it to prevent browning but it isn't (in my opinion) a necessity. Depending on what TYPE of apple I use, I may or may not use lemon.  I added a touch of ground ginger and ground cloves to this (maybe 1/4 tsp each) and a pinch of freshly ground nutmeg. I also brushed the crust with egg white and topped it with a little sugar. I served this with "homemade" cinnamon ice cream (French vanilla ice cream that I mixed with ground cinnamon). After my renditions this pie was superb! But the one time I made it as is, it practically drowned in juices and had a soggy bottom crust.

I too added the lemon juice, cinnamon, nutmeg and flour and then did a sugar glaze on the top crust.  My husband loved it as well as the kids.  It turned out perfect and my husband wants me to make another one as soon as possible.  Can't wait to try again. Thanks

Good basic recipe and very easy.  I used Granny Smith apples and half white, half brown sugar.  I also added a bit of nutmeg and brushed the top crust with egg/milk.   It took nearly an hour for this to be done baking.

I do not particularly care for apple pie as much as my family.  However, I must give high accolades for this tweaked recipe.  Love-Love it!  As some of the reviewers suggested, I added a splash of orange juice, 3T of flour, few shakes of nutmeg, brown sugar (1/2c) the rest white sugar, 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and topped off with an egg wash. I cannot wait for my family to get home from work/school to try!!  I will definitely prepare this apple pie recipe again, and again! Thanks for sharing!

I had never made a pie before so I was quite apprehensive about choosing from the hundreds of recipes on this site. However, my aunt once told me "choose the simplest". It was so easy, turned out great, and the taste was outstanding. I did add nutmeg just because I love the taste of it, also 1/2 c brown sugar and the rest white, and lastly 2 Tbsp of flour, although I suggest adding 3-4 because mine was almost on the too runny side. I did have problems with the top layer of apples being dry for the juices did not quite reach them. I am not quite sure what I did to cause that but, hey, it's my first pie. Honestly, it was one of the best pies I've ever tasted (if I do say so myself).

Great recipe!  

I melted the butter and mixed it with 1 teaspoon of vanilla and drizzled it over the layered apples.  Also, I used a 10 inch ceramic pie plate, so I cooked the pie for 10 minutes at 450 then for about an hour at 350 and it came out perfect!

Yummy and easy as pie (no pun intended).  The only reason this was not a 5-star pie is that it was a bit too "soupy" for my taste.  After reading some of the other comments left, I'd definately try adding a couple of teaspoons of flour to thicken next time.  Other than that, this recipe is fast, easy, and simply DELICOUS!!!!!

I am 42 and this is the first apple pie I have ever made. And the second completely homemade pie, crust and all. I followed some of the other suggestions to add flour to the sugar/cinnamon mixture and added some fresh squeezed lemon juice to the apples. Instead of regular cinnamon I used a blend of cinnamon and other spices I bought from Penzy's called Apple Pie. I baked for 10 min. at 450, and then 35 minutes at 370 and it came out just fine. My teenagers and husband said it tasted better than my mother-in-laws. I also used the Never Fail Pie crust II, the recipe is for 16 servings which is 2 double crusts. I adjusted for one pie, but put in for 10 servings. I'd rather have a little left over pie crust. I also did a lattice top on this pie - SO EASY, and it looks so pretty too. Much better than the traditional top. I love making pies now, I told my family I am making one a week for them!

Upon removal from the oven, I discovered I had made "Apple Pie Soup!" It needs flour or something to thicken the natural apple juices that bake out of the apples.  There is also too much sugar/ cinnamon in the recipe.

This was awesome! Made it for Thanksgiving. I did follow some of the suggestions and I added two tbsp of flour and half a teaspoon vanilla extract. I also used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/4 cup white sugar. I used a pre made crust, it was the type in the refrigerator and it came with two you could roll out. The bottom I just rolled and for the top I cut it into strips and layed it across. My husband said it looked and tasted like a deli pie. Thanks for sharing this! I'll definately make it again!!

If using juicy apples, add a little flour with each layer. It absorbs the excess liquid, keeping your pie from being soggy. Also, topping the crust by spreading a litle butter over it and adding left over sugar and cinnamon is a great touch.

I have used this twice now and both times it has turned out lovely. Using the advice of others I added between 2-4 TBsp of flour total between layers of apples and made a simple egg wash to brush the crust with.

a lot of people on here gave this recipe 5 stars, but most seemed to have been smart enough to add flour. well i didn't, i just followed the recipe as it said and it turned out really watery in the end. tastes good, but i think it would have been better with the 4 tbs flour. =(

Well, maybe I'm not meant to be dessert chef but this pie turned out simply awful. I was skeptical about the recipe because it does not call for any flour (I always thought pies needed flour as a thickening agent), so I didn't add any being that I assumed the author knows more about pies than I do. Anyway, I baked it for a visit from my in-laws and it smelled pretty darn good in the oven. I went to serve it and it was terribly runny. The pieces basically slopped onto the plate in a disgusting lump and I was woefully embarrassed. Won't be serving this one again, sorry :o( (PS: The author of this post does not discount that I may be a total buffoon and did something wrong that I cannot recall while preparing said pie).

This is a great basic apple pie recipe.  I used nutmeg in mine and also lemon juice- it keeps the apples from turning brown and adds an interesting flavor.

This was really good.  I really would rate this a four point five.  I used a pilsberry crust and that turned out pretty good.  I added about two tbsp of vinilla extract, very good.  And a little more butter than I shoud have.  I will add a little lemon juice next time.  :-)

Simple and delicious! I used Fuji apples instead, but it still came out pretty good (I did have a lot of excess cinnamon-sugar apple "juice" soaking my crust even when I had egg washed the crust. I need to somehow make it solid instead of liquid).

This is the first Apple Pie I've every made.  I followed the recipe the first time, and the second and third I altered it to fit my family's tastes.  
I agree with everyone else ... this is a great base recipe.  
Yumm!

Great pie! I did tweak the recipe a bit. I looked at the reviews and a lot of people mentioned brown sugar. I couldn't think of apple pie without brown sugar! I did 1/4 white and 2/4 brown sugar. I also just added a bit more butter and cinnamon on the inside and top of the crust!

Followed another reviewers advice and added 3 T flour to the mix, also squeezed a little lemon juice on apples, and a couple drops of vanilla extract. I was lucky to get a slice at the party I took it to, it was a big hit.

Sooo good! I made the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" with this. It's a great combo. I've made this with and without the butter, also with and without a top crust, either way is fantastic.

My first time making any kind of pie... easy breezy! Just a little too sweet, so next time I'll halve the sugar (I used brown). I added, as Ellen did: 1 tbsp lemon juice, 2 tbsp flour, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Thanks! Enjoy!

Made this recipe for a family member using Macintosh apples.  It was awesome.  Did like others suggested and used 3 TBS of flour to thicken up the juice a bit, and also 2 TS of lemon juice on the apples.  DELICIOUS!

This recipe was very easy.  I baked my first pie using it and it was delicious.  I used the pre-made pie crust and only needed 4 cups (vs 8) of apples.  The next time I try this I will tweak the recipe a bit and use some of the suggestions in the other reviews.  I added 1 teaspoon of flour and it was a bit juicy.  2 teaspoons should make it turn out just right.

Loved it!
I used a little nutmeg and brown sugar instead of white sugar. VERY good with whipped cream or ice cream. I made my own crust and it was delicious with the pie filling. When making crust, you should put some egg wash over it then sugar and it is the best. Thanks for the great recipe! (:

Apple pies are best made simply.  Classic recipe.  I like to brush my top crust with a honey butter mixture toward the end of baking.  Another way to make a fancy top is to roll out the dough and use a shaped cookie cutter (hearts, leaves, xmas trees, etc.) and just layer those all over the top.

This was great! I tossed the apples w/ lemon so they wouldn't brown as I was slicing them and then added a little bit of flour to the apples.  I also used half brown sugar and  half white sugar and the pie came out perfectly. The filling was great, not runny at all. Everyone loved it.

I tried this recipe, followed it to the T.. What I got was apple SOUP in a pie crust. complete waste of time and money. Thanks. I hope no one else tries this exactly, it won't be pretty.  I have tried several recipes on this Website, all have been succesful. This is the only one that has been -completley- disasterous.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I added lemon to the apples and flour to the sugar/cin. mixture as well as pouring about a half cup of cream over the layered apple slices before adding the crust.  It was seriously the most delicious apple pie I have ever eaten!!!!

Fantastic! This was my first apple pie. I didn't realize it would be so easy to make. I added 2 tablespoons of flour & a bit of nutmeg to the cinnamon/sugar mixture. I also added chopped walnuts 'cause I like crunchy. I took the pie to my group bible study and everyone absolutely loved it. Will make it again and again.

Followed the advice of others and added 2 Tablespoons of flour.  I made the pie three times now, with different apples each time...depending on the apples, you may need to add more flour.  I believe that you might be safer adding that third tablespoon of flour, if you don't want the pie to be watery when you cut it.

I originally thought the ease of the recipe would result in so so results... This pie is fantastic. I used a ready made crust so prep time was minimal. My husband couldn't wait for it to cool so it was a bit runny the first night, but perfect after sitting in the fridge overnight. Will definitely make again.

Maybe it was the apples I used (Gala-I love them and had them on hand) because my pie came out super watery. I had to drain my pie! I even used four tablespoons of flour! And the apples, although I sliced them thinly, were still a little raw and crisp! The pie had a nice flavor though. With caramel sauce, ice cream and nuts, no one cared that the apples weren't soft. Still, I think I'll try another recipe or try this one again using Granny Smith apples. (uh, I just learned from another reviewer that sweet/soft apples make runny pies. Be sure to use a tart apple!)

I was looking for an easy recipe for an apple pie for our Thanksgiving dessert. I had NEVER baked a pie before.  This recipe was wonderful!  I got soooo many compliments!  I used Granny Smith apples.  I took the easy way out for the crust..Philsbury Pie Crust.  I took the advice of others on this site and added 4 tablespoons of flour.  I used a few more thinly sliced apple slices and made it heaping under the top crust.  I was generous with the cinnamon and sugar and pre mixed them in a bowl all together and then put it in the pie shell.  Added 1 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice over the top before added the bits of butter and the top crust.  Gave it an extra tang/zip.  LOVED IT!!  I've been asked to bring TWO pies to Christmas now!  So if you wanna get out of being asked to bake a pie..don't bake this one..or you'll be stuck for life! (hee hee) :) Happy Holidays!!!

Absolutely fantastic! For the record, I've never baked a pie in my life. I took the advice listed in the other reviews, such as including 4 tbsp. flour and also mixed the cinammon/sugar mixture with the apples prior to putting the apples in the crust. Now, if I could just master the crust part of it!

This was my first apple pie and was it a hit!  My only recommendation is to cover the pie with foil for the latter part of the baking.  The center of my crust started to get really brown, almost black.

This was a really easy apple pie recipe.  Honestly, you just toss everything into a pie shell and bake.  I cheated and used a store bought pie crust, which I know took a lot of the taste away.  I normally bake my own pie crust and that makes all the difference.  It was a little on the sweet side, so next time I will not use as much sugar.  I had the same issue with the pie being a little runny, but the next day it was fine.  Next time, I will wait a full day before I cut into the pie, if i can wait that long.

Great Apple Pie recipe. I too tweaked it just a little but that is the fun in cooking. I also cover the edge of this pie with Reynolds wrap for the first half of baking so the crust there does not get too brown. My husband is a diabetic and I substitute Splenda sugar (both brown and white) for the regular sugars I would otherwise use. Thanks for the recipe!

My sweetie and I used to drive a couple of hours to a place that had terrific apple pies. I would like to thank Carol for this recipe because it's like the pies my guy loves and I don't have to drive for hours! And it's easy to make. I didn't change a thing. Great recipe!

Delicious pie! My sister & I made this with my mother in law's famous pie crust recipe. We added 1 tbsp. lemon juice, used 1/2 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup white sugar, added 1 tsp. vanilla and 2 tbsp. flour. The apples were not as done as we would have liked but that may be because we sliced each apple into 16 slices, may work better sliced into 24 slices per apple. Delicious when warmed with vanilla ice cream!

This recipe is super easy and come out with delicious apple pie! I followed other reviewers and put a little flour in the mixture to make sure it doesn't get soupy and sometimes add some brown sugar to the mix as well!

I sprinkled some lemon juice over the apples to keep them from turning brown and placed them in a large bowl and tossed with the rest of ingredients.  I did add two Tbls. flour to the sugar mixture but wished I had added more as the sauce was still very juicy, so much so that it made the bottom crust taste doughy.  I will make this again but I will add more flour to the mixture.

Delicious and sweet without being too sweet. Only change I made to original recipe is I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. My apples didn't get done enough in the time specified, so I kept the pie in for an additional 30 min. Something seemed amiss with the liquid; I didn't see the pie bubbling like I'm used to, but it may have been my apples or oven. At any rate, it was a great tasting pie, and even better the next day reheated and topped with vanilla ice cream.

My neighbor has an apple tree that drops apples between both our yards. I didn't realize they were not crab apples until her grown sons told me we could eat them! So, I discovered this recipe and made our weight in apple pies last year!   This is fabulous and is now my family's new favorite of all my dessert pies. If I recall, mine turned out a bit watery, so I have to work on that this year. My husband and I peel and slice together, then I toss the apples with sugar and cinnamon in a large bowl before putting them into the pie shell. I also dust the inside of the pie shell with sugar-cinnamon-flour mixture before laying out the apples in our favorite spiral pattern. I alternate between the full crust with decorative slits with shape cutouts and the basket weave. Either way it's topped and decorated, it's a fabulous recipe that makes mouths happy!  I highly recommend this awesome classic apple pie!

FANTASTIC! I am always nervous to alter recipes, but everything I did made this pie the BEST apple pie I have ever eaten! This was my first attempt at fresh apple pie...I added 2 TBSP of flour, changed the sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, added a cap full of vanilla and sprinkled in nutmeg. I used granny smith apples, which gave this pie the best, slightly tart flavor!! I cooked it for 45 mins as well!! I WILL KEEP THIS RECIPE FOREVER!

My family loved this pie! I made my own crust, the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site. It took me a little more than an hour to make, and my family ate the whole pie in about five minutes! It was so tasty that all the work was worth it! The only change I made was to add some extra sugar, because that is how my Grandma makes hers, and she makes the most awesome pies! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

This makes a delicious apple pie - the flavor is wonderful! I sliced 8 Breaburn apples into a large ziplock and tossed with 2 TBLS of lemon juice. Then I added 2 TBLS flour and tossed. Lastly, I added the sugar and cinnamon and tossed that. Dumped it all into my pie shell that I had brushed with egg wash. Brushed the top crust with egg wash and sprinkled with sugar. Cooked exactly as specified and the apples were still a little firm so it could have cooked a bit longer if you want a softer apple. I thought the finished product (firm apples and all) was Marvelous!!!

This pie was AWESOME! It was my very first try at an apple pie, and it turned out perfectly.  We served it to company, and after they left, my husband and I finished it off--we couldn't help ourselves!  Thank you for making me look a pro pastry chef!

This pie is beautiful! I used about 6 cups of Granny Smith apples and a store bought crust and added 1/2 t vanilla and a little lemon juice.  I also brushed the top with milk and sprinkled it with sugar before baking.  You can use the sugar pretty liberally for each layer and still have enough.

Great, simple recipe.  Pie was a bit too runny though.  How do I make the insides gel more so the juices don't all run as soon as I serve a piece?

Oh so simple and oh so tasty. As the saying goes, "this was as easy as pie". My husband kept raving how awesome this was and going on about it being the BEST apple pie he's ever eaten. This was my first time to make apple pie without opening a can of filling. A lot easier than I thought and after this, I'm never going back to canned again! I used frozen pie crust and Granny Smith apples. I'll make this again and again, thanks, Carol.

My fiance loves apple pie and he said this pie was OUT OF THIS WORLD it was so good. He practically inhaled it. I  sprinkled some vanilla over the apple/sugar/cinnamon and I used 1 cup of sugar instead. I also used more butter - I placed pats of butter on top of the filling instead of little pieces. The thickness of the sauce was beautiful WITHOUT flour. There is nothing better than homemade! Definitely a five star recipe that can be modified to how you like it! Next time I will use some nutmeg and ground cloves. A winner if I ever made one!

Great pie! I made it with the added vanilla mentioned above (I just sprinkled it on) and left out the butter, but it still tasted unbelievable. Works really well with an apple-crumble type top.

Easy to make.  I did add 2 tbs flour, but left out the butter.  Tasted wonderful.  I used Mackintosh apples.

I loved this recipe. It was my first time baking apple pie and I was a little nervous. I added 3 tablespoons of flour to the sugar mix to keep the pie from being too runny. Everyone loved it!

I followed recipe directions exactly and it turned out great. There was a bunch of liquid on the bottom of the pie crust pan, and we ladled it over our ice cream. Next time, I'll try adding the flour/allspice/nutmeg - which might make it less juicy. But honestly, we didn't mind the juice - 5 stars for simplicity & taste!

This is a GREAT recipe. It was my first time baking pie, and it turned out wonderfully. I was kinda scared to try it because on my first attempt I used flour instead of sugar (that is exactly how clueless I am when it comes to the kitchen!) but when I saw my family digging into it, I couldn't resist. If I can make it taste wonderful, then anyone can!!!
IF I would change anything then it would be to put less sugar than it says in it cause it was extremely sweet, but thats just me.

I am so glad that I chose this recipe to be my first apple pie ever. I made it for a small Thanksgiving party this year, and received great reviews from my husband and friends. I decided to make it a second time for a Christmas Dessert Open House. I was told by several guests that this was the absolute BEST apple pie they had ever had. Here are a few things that I learned between the 2 bakings: Add the 3-4 tbsp flour. Be generous with the "sprinkling" of the sugar mixture on each layer. If you do an egg-wash glaze, be generous with that, too in order to get a shiny brown crust. Make the pie early in the day or the night before to help the pie slices to keep their shape - although it will probably be eaten so fast that may not matter much! Lastly, I had no idea what apples to use, so I went with Macintosh. And from the reviews I received, they seem to be the apple of choice for this recipe. Enjoy!

This is the first pie that I'd made by myself, and it turned out GREAT! After reading the reviews, I added a little flour (about 2 tbsp.) to the sugar mixture, and the juice from one lemon to the apples. I also put on a glaze on the top crust, which helped it brown just right. This pie is also very good with vanilla ice cream.

my pie also turned out watery even with the 2tbsp of flour. I would rather coat the apples with the sugar/flour/spice mixture then layer the slices in the pan instead of sprinkling on each layer. Mine also took a lot longer than 30-35 mins to bake with jonathan apples.if you dont already have one, invest in a pie shield because my pie stayed in the oven almost an hour

This is the best Apple Pie I have ever tasted. It was easy to make too. I used Granny Smith apples and added a 1/4 tsp. cloves in the first pie and in the second pie cut the sugar in half, it still was the best. For the crust I used a no shortening crust which is also the best...really light and flakey. For that I used half and half instead of whole milk.

This is the first fruit pie I've ever made, and although I cheated and used frozen pie crusts, it was delicious. Like other reviewers, I added 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 2 Tbsp. flour to the sugar mixture. I also tossed the apples in the sugar mixture instead of layering it. 
So simple to make, I might even try my hand at homemade pastry next time!

Tried this recipe today used Granny Smith apples but change it per some of the reviews added 2 tbsp flour and mixed flour sugar and spices together before adding to apples. I also used frozen premade pie shells. Had a problem with top crust but that worked out ok. Turned out fine other than the issue with crust which was my fault. All and all this recipe with adjustments was pretty darn good. Tangy apples were better than the too sweet delicious and not as juicy which helped. I also used ½ cup brown sugar to ¼ cup white sugar and added nutmeg and lemon juice. Will try again next weekend and will use the pie crust in a box/frozen not in the pan/frozen. Thanks to every one who made suggestions. My husband was very pleased.

I was skeptical about trying this recipe at first, but I needed a quick dessert for the Fourth of July and I had a plethora of Granny Smith apples left. The recipe is a simple one, but I tweaked it a little bit. I added a couple of dashes of nutmeg, used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar. I also added two teaspoons of cornstarch to help thicken the juices a bit. I made the "Butter Flaky Crust" the day before. As for baking, I started it off at 450 degrees for ten minutes then reduced the temp to 350 and let it bake for about thirty-five minutes. It's important to make sure the juices are bubbly before removing from the oven.

PS-Brush the crust with one egg mixed with a tablespoon of water to make it nice and brown. (Makes for great presentation)

I love this recipe!  The only change I make is that I put all of the apples in a big bowl and mix the dry ingredients with the apples and let it sit while I roll out my crusts. Then I put the apple mix in dotting the layers with the butter.

I add raisins plumped in water.  I then heat the raisin water and add some dissolved cornstarch to thicken, a tiny bit of lemon juice, and some nutmeg and a dash of brown sugar.  Before putting the apples into the crust , I use a fork to poke  holes in the bottom crust, then add this thickened "sauce" to the pie, dust the apples with flour, then close the crust. There have been raves.  It's a tweak of an original found here.

I actually have a question about this recipe.. this would be the first pie Ive made.. I have apple pie spice can I use that in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg? If so Im not sure how much to use.. And someone told me if you use the premade pie crust you should bake the bottom crust a little first has anyone done it like that?

Eyeballed a little orange juice, flour and pure vanilla extract. You'll want to spread a thin layer of flour on the bottom crust before filling to absorb some of the juices so its not TOO runny. FABULOUS and easy, will make again for sure!

simple, which i like. One of my first attempts at apple pie. The flavor was very good, however a bit runny if eating hot. Thickens when cooled. Friend suggested i coat the apples with flour before baking.   will make this one again

I love this pie recipe.  I make sure when making it, I use a lard pie crust recipe.  There is no substitute!  Always remember to brush the top crust with egg to give it that golden brown look, and sprinkle a little turbinado sugar on top right as it comes out of the oven.

This was the first apple pie I have ever made, and it is delicious!! Mixed the cinnamon sugar with the apples, then added the nutmeg then put them in the pie shell. Did the egg wash and sprinkled sugar on the lattice, made it nice and brown and a little sweet...great recipe!

Delicious, I did mix in a little nutmeg with the cinnamon and sugar.  Also sprinkled a little sugar and nutmeg on the top crust before baking.

This recipe was really good on its own but it ended up a little flat. I think it needs more apples.

Exceptional pie. This was my first time making a fresh apple pie. The receipe is quick and delicious. I loved this recipe. I added 2 tbls pf flour as suggested and lemon juice (fresh squeezed). Everything else I left exactly the same. It was fantastic. Everyone raved. Oh...I also added a egg wash to the top crust-1 egg and 1 tbls of heavy cream)- for extra flakiness. It was fabulous....

Much like the other reviewers, I added lemon juice, flour, vanilla and nutmeg.  I had never made an apple pie before, and let me tell you - I have now made two of them in less than 24 hours!  It is THAT GOOD!!!  I cheated and used premade crusts, but that was the only short cut.  The first time I cut each and every apple, but the second time, I used a cheese grater, the long cuts, and that worked very well!  I added milk and cinnamon sugar to the top and it made a nice color!  Definitely a keeper recipe!!!

This was a fantastic pie. I made it with the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe found on this site. Make sure to use fresh apples, as when they are too ripe the filling gets runny. Also allow to set after baking. It will retain the structure better.

Very good starter recipe. I used pre-made refrigerated crust, and chopped up 7 apples. I took a reader's suggestion and added vanilla extract and mixed it with the apples. I think the sugar is too much - even 1/2 cup may be too much. Next time I may experiment with oats in lieu of extra sugar to retain some sort of binding element. I felt the pie missed something, perhaps more cinnamon to add flavor. Very good pie - will make again with modifications!

My 18-year-old daughter's favorite dessert is the apple pie. When I told her I was trying this recipe, she cringed.  I went exactly as described and now I am "not allowed" to use any other. My daughter states the cinnamon is what does the trick, plus fresh apples, which my other recipe called for neither. (It is now referred to as 'the fake recipe'.) I have made your apple recipe a few times already and each time, it is very delicious. It is going down in my hall of fame recipe book. Thank you!

Great recipe. First time for me to make apple pie from scratch. I don't think I had a deep enough pan because with the filling I was able to make two pies. This one impressed my inlaws. They took one of the pies home. EASY and yummy....definitely I do again recipe.

I don't know what I did wrong but my came out a litt runny. I did add 1 tbl of lemon and vanilla and two tbl of flour so that it wouldn't come out runny, but it still did. I think my apples might have been too juicy. I will try again with different kind of apples, and maybe that should fix it. It was still super yummy though.

Here's what I did for 2 sour apple pies with a heart lattice top crust (see picture): 

Mix thinly sliced Granny Smith apples and double the remaining ingredients along with 2 Tbls. Flour, 2 Tbls. Lemon Juice, ½ Tsp. Vanilla and ½ Tsp. Nutmeg in a large bowl. Add this filling to 2 pie pans and top with lattice and hearts made from leftover dough. Brush top crust with egg wash (1 egg and 1 Tbls. milk beaten) to get a nice golden brown crust. Cover crust edges and hearts with foil held on with toothpicks so they don't over-brown. When pie comes out of oven, remove foil and toothpicks and sprinkle crust with a cinnamon sugar mixture. I used brown sugar instead of white for the filling. Add more sugar to get a sweeter pie.

I would give this recipe another star if it mentioned flour or cornstarch in the ingredients. Otherwise your pie will come out very runny!  I add allspice, ginger, and nutmeg as well. It's better to mix all of the dry ingredients first and toss them with the apple slices. With these additions it comes out amazing every time.

I baked this for a gathering this week.  I was worried it wouldn't be good enough, but it was PERFECT ! I wanted something that the "older" folks could relate to as "old fashioned" cooking and it did so VERY Well ! TY It did though take forever to cook I am not sure why.

good recipe--easy, but being diabetic, i used splenda white-1/2 cup, splendid brown sugar-1/4 cup, lots of cinnamon-studies show it is good for diabetics--a touch of orange rind & 3 tbs of flour. i also used 8 cups of apples, the pie was huge. oops also instead of using butter or margarine. i sprayed the top liberally with parkay fat free butter spray.  it turned out fine. i am hoping that i wont feel quite as quilty eating a piece of this at Thanksgiving.

Fabulous...though I did use some ideas from other reviewers to tweak the recipe; such as using brown sugar instead of white, 2TB flour, 1/2 tsp vanilla & 1/4 tsp nutmeg and then I brushed crust with 1 beaten egg mixed with 1TB milk and sprinkled with white sugar.  Won't be disappointed at all!

This pie came out very watery, despite the flour I put in the layers.  I should have put more flour in.   
Also,  I would have used brown sugar instead of white sugar (it carmalizes like caramel!) 
but it still came out OK,  just watery.   Use 4 tbsp of flour, some on bottom, and be liberal with it.  I like Apple Pie II on this site but it's a little more complicated to make, and uses more butter.

Very easy and yummy. I used pre-made crust for bottom and made my own short-bread crust for top...

This is the way I've always made apple pie... I may add add a bit more cinnamon and sugar, and there usually IS juice on the bottom, but after I refrigerate it there are no problems!

It was good apple pie, but nothing "WOW"!  Which is what I was looking for.  Definately use a crisp, tart green apple.  I added 2T of flour to the mix before putting in the shell, just for wetness insurance.  I did not need to,  maybe that is why the pie was only so-so.  Crust is paramount, I used frozen ready made. I will try homemade next time.  I probably will not use this recipe again. Not because it was bad, it just was not great.

just like the others, i added 2tbsp flour and 1 tsp nutmeg. the sugar mixture seemed like a lot when i poured it on the apples but it was perfect. so make sure you use all the sugar!!! i used the pie crust recipe off a crisco shortening box and it worked great. this was the best apple pie i've made.

My husband and I were looking for a simple recipe to use up some apples in the frig.  I found this and we made it together and really enjoyed the finished product.  I basted the crust with melted butter and put a little of the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top.  Thanks for the old fashioned apple pie recipe!

Very good! It's so easy to make! I bought the Pampered Chef apple peeler corer slicer product and it helps the apple process to be that much easier! This is always a classic recipe that you can't go wrong with!

This was excellent!!! I tested this recipe out before making it for christmas and it was sooo good! I took some advice from other reviewers and added some nutmeg and brushed the crust w/ some milk before putting it in the oven. I had never made an apple pie before, but the way this one turned out you would think I was a natural. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I added nutmeg and mixed the sugar, apples, spices and 4 TBLS flour in a large bowl BEFORE filling the crust.  It turned out perfect.  Adding the flour keeps it from getting runny.  It sat on the counter for three or four days and even the very last piece was wonderful.  A very simple recipe with amazing results.  You have to give this one a try!

This recipe made a delicious apple pie.  The only problem I had, the pie came out with a lot of extra watery sauce.  Should I have added flour or cornstarch to prevent this from happening?  I did not add any water.

All in the family agreed this apple pie was great.  I followed some of the suggestions (love that part of this recipe community) and it was not runny and just the right combination of sugars and spices.  Thank you all.

This being my first pie, it took me a while to figure out why I was supposed to prepare the pastry for two crust pie when the ingredients called for a single crust pie.
The crust portion of the recipe went downhill from there.  I used the Tenderflake frozen pie shells and for some reason, the entire crust was burnt after 20 minutes of baking.  Using the Ring of Foil was of little help.
Tastewise, this apple pie *is* awesome (added lemon, brown sugar, flour).  Will try again.

What can I say that hasn't been said 65 times before?  

Easy, and delicious.  The best apple pie I've ever tasted, and the first one I've ever made...

(And yes, I added the 3 T of flour too... just do it...)

This was the first time I tried making apple pie, and a pie with top and bottom crust(they're not very common here in Portugal). I didn't know it could be this easy and turn out so good.

As many users advised, I added more than 2 tablespoons of flour. However, since I had to use less apples than those called for(about 500 grams) because of the plate size I used, I suppose that if you are to use the original amount it would be better to add flour, butter, cinnamon and sugar to get the same great flavor I got - and it wasn't runny at all after baking.

I also followed a user's advice and used the oil pie crust recipe you can find in this site. I second that advice, it's easy to make and matches really well with the filling.

If I could give ten stars I would. I've used different types of recipes a couple times, but this basic recipe continues to be the best. This time it was the best apple pie I've ever made. I probably use more cinnamon and butter than the recipe calls for, but the more, the merrier, right??  ;)  Excellent, nice and easy pie recipe

Excellent pie recipe with the oil crust recipe from this site, as another reviewer suggested. Definitely add at least 2 Tblsp flour to sugar mix, next time I would add more.

Overall, this apple pie turned out nicely.  I followed the suggestions of other viewers and added some flour to my apple mixture to make it less watery.  Maybe I didn't add enough flour, but my apple mixture still turned out watery.  I would also suggest making sure that you use one type of apple for the pie, instead of mixing a few different types.  You really can tell the difference.

So easy! I've never made pie in my life, and this turned out fantastic. But please, know your apples. The first time I made it I mixed Jonathan and MacIntosh. You could taste the difference in the pie. (Jonathan = tart, Mac = just right) So I made it again, with the same mixture of apples, added 1 cup of sugar to tame the tart. I added lemon juice (sprinkling), 12tsp of nutmeg, 1TBS of cinnamon and a "half a handful" of brown sugar. I also heavily sprinkled the top with flour. (These apples were very wet.) Fantastic!

As a beginning cook I found this recipe very easy and very good.  The second time I made this I mixed some of my homemade cranberry sauce in with the apples and a little more sugar, cinnamon and sme lemon juice to taste and it turned out fantastic!  Also, ready made pie crust I used  was brushed with butter before baking for a golden brown color.  I will continue to use this recipie for a flawless pie every time...

I literally love this recipe sooooo much. This was the first pie I ever made and I would rate this 200 out of 10 easily. I changed a few things. First, I used about 6 apples in total because they were kind of small. Second, I added about a teaspoon of nutmeg after my cinnamon and sugar were mixed. And finally third, I placed my apple slices not neatly, but mixed around the area to really get a lot of layers and the sugar mix in. After the top crust was on, I used my extra cinnamon and sugar and nutmeg to give it extra flavor. Again,  just letting you know that I would absolutely  make this again.

This recipe definitely needs some flour mixed in with the apples.  Without the flour the pie is too juicy.  It is good, but too juicy to be able to serve up a nice piece of pie.

This pie is missing the flour. Flour is important so all the liquids from the apples thickens and doesn't end up in a lot of fluid in the bottom of the crust! One-fourth cup of flour would work nicely.

This recipe is great. I only added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg because I like that it combined with the cinnamon. I made this for a pot luck and everyone that had a piece loved it. The pie set perfectly with NO ADDED FLOUR. My husband complimented
the recipe more than twice. We will be using this in further pies. This filling would work very well in apple turnovers!
Thank your for the recipe!!

I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except I added 1Tbsp. of lemon juice as my apples were not tart. Next time, I will mix in 2 Tbsp. flour to the sugar mixture to thicken the juices. I like the suggestion to bake the pie on the lowest oven rack. Because this pie recipe is tasty and simple and I will make it often for my husband.

We’ve made this pie twice now and it’s been delicious each time. We used 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2/3 cup white sugar, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1 teaspoon of vanilla,  1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and 3 Tablespoons of flour, all mixed in with the apples. We put a little bit of brown sugar and cinnamon on the bottom pie shell before we put the apples in, and then sprinkled some white sugar on the top pie crust before baking. We used more sugar as we put about 8 cups of apples into the pie crust. This is our go to recipe for Apple Pie now!

This was a super easy recipe. I added more butter on each layer of apples. Like others, I added about 2 Tbs of flour to the cinnamon and sugar (part brown). I also added about 1/4 tsp of ground ginger and 1/4tsp of ground cloves. Yummy!

Wow, this pie was awesome!I've made it about seven times. I didn't change it at all, except I added A LOT more (to my taste) cinnamon to the sugar. I made a homemade crust, Perfect Pie Crust Recipe, on Simplyrecipes.com. This was the first apple pie recipe I've made, and everyone is saying it's a really easy apple pie recipe, which I can agree with, although I've never made a different apple pie recipe. I'm glad it was my first!

This was delicious!! I never...ever bake anything, but I really wanted to make something for Christmas. My 9 year old daughter helped. I'm not sure the kind of apples, but I used red. I also used  50/50 mix of brown sugar and white sugar(the brown sugar came into play because my daughter gave me the wrong sugar). I also stirred about two teaspoons of lemon juice into my apples prior to adding to the crust and adding the mix. I showed the finished product to my coworker, the baker, and she was very impressed with the color and crimped edges. Thank you for the recipe Carol!!!

The pie was delicious!!!! The only thing I did differently is I added more nutmeg. I also added a little bit of cinnamon because I think cinnamon brings out the flavor in Apple's.

This was my first experience making apple pie and I loved that this recipe was so simple. Following the advice of other members I added 3TBSP  white flour and nutmeg to the sugar and cinnamon mixture (I also used brown sugar instead of white since that's what we use at home). Once that was done I tossed the apple with the mixture (also suggested) and brushed the top with an egg wash made with an egg and some milk. I finished by sprinkling the top with some sugar. The pie was gorgeous!!!! This is definitely my new favorite dessert to make because of how beautiful it looks and smells :-)

Excellent ! Excellent! Made for Christmas dessert and it was a hit! I've tried many more complicated recipes that was far more work and far less delicious!  Starting with good apples and a good pie crust (Sprouts store bought) with Trader Joes pie crust as a latticed top was the perfect combination.  This is keeper and a recipe that I will always come back to.  Adding some vanilla  and also 1-2 table spoons of flour is also a good addition, to thicken the filling.  Just yummy!

Great recipe especially for my first time making Apple pie. I read extensively through the reviews: I added 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 TBL flour, 3/4 teaspoon ground cloves  to mixture.        I mixed it all in a gallon ziploc and tosses until evenly coated. I layered the mixture with several tablespoons of unsalted butter. I chose Braeburn apples, 6 did the trick and they were perfect (a bit tart but plenty sweet, perfectly balanced.) I also did a 1 egg white and 2 tablespoons milk mix to brush on top of final pie crust, sprinkled white sugar on top. I covered the edge of pie with foil for 40 minutes of bake time, and added turned the heat up to 375 for 20 more minutes at the end of bake time. Also let it sit for 10 additional minutes with the oven off. Lots of modifications but you guys it was DELICIOUS!!!!

The first time I made this it came out perfect! But it being my first try at apple pie, I was shocked by how much sugar it called for so on my second try I decided to reduce it by half (big mistake).  Next time I will follow the recipe to the letter and know Ill get a good result

Made this recipe using Pilsbury Gluten Free Pie & Pastry for the crust.  I did not layer the apples, just mixed them all together with the ingredients.  I left out the butter and I also added 2 TBLS lemon jiuce, 2 TBLS Gluten Free All Purpose Flour, 1/2 teas vanilla 1/4 teas nutmeg and used brown sugar instead of white, just to give it a bit more flavour.  Next time, I will add 8-10 cups of apples instead of 6, as the pie ended up falling.

This pie was perfect! I'm glad I read the comments and added 2 tbsp of flour the the mix, and tossed the apples in the sugar-cinnamon-flour mixture. My whole family and my boyfriend loved it, and it was very easy to make. I'll definitely be making it again.

I always make a recipe as written the 1st time I try a new one...with that said. The top was nicely browned and the apples were cooked, but there was so much liquid it looked like soup. I suspect that the author omitted flour, I kept thinking as I was making it that something was missing.

I made this pie with only the most suggested tweeks from the reviews, 1/4 cup of flour tossed in with apples, sugar and spice. Bit of lemon juice and eggwash with sugar/cinn sprinkle and it was AMAZING omg . yummmm the tip of putting it on the lowest rack and cooking it at a high temp the first few minutes saved me from ruining the bottom crust like i always do . Thanks !

My first attempt was fairly decent (according to my dad!) I used a store bought crust mix. The filling was really good- the only thing I didn't like was how crunchy my apples were after all was said and done. I like a soft apple filling. Bet it had something to do with the type of apples used, don't know what kind they are exactly but they were from our neighbors' tree. We'll be trying this again and researching how to get those apples soft!

Very good, altho I should've added more cornstarch, was kinda runny, but apples do cook down quite a bit and I stuffed that crust!

If you are looking for a basic apple pie recipe, you found it here. Sometimes we need comfort food and this pie with a scoop of icecream is all you need. Easy recipe, I do add a little extra cinnamon and I also brush my crust with a little honey diluted with a few drops of water to give it a shiney glaze, this is done as soon as it comes out of the oven.

I needed a bit fewer than 6 cups of apples to fill the pan, but in all other ways the recipe could be followed exactly.  It has a very traditional flavor.  However, its nothing remarkable or super memorable.  Just a regular cinnamon and sugar apple pie.

Excellent pie.  I made x1.5 the amount of crust I usually do and had enough to cover the whole pie.
I used half white and half brown sugar.
Instead of layering the apples and sugar mixture, I mixed the apple, sugars and cinnamon in a bowl and let it sit for a good half hour.

Will definitely redo!

Loved it so much. I have to make it a few times a week now. I followed the amount of sugar to T, and added some vanilla extract, and some flour. I also like to sprinkle a little cinnamon on the crust, and the crust is really popular.

I'm 21 and am not exactly a good cook or a baker =). We have an apple tree in our backyard with fuji apples. So for thanksgiving I figured I'd do something with them...I don't like pies too sweet and my apples are already really sweet so I added a little less than 1/2cup sugar. I also added 1 1/2Tb cornstarch because I was afraid of it being runny. I also used store bought crust because I have no idea how to roll dough and things like that. For a first timer, this recipe was extremely easy and turned out great! next time I may put in a little lemon juice and vanilla, and maybe more cinnamon. All in all great pie!! My family and my boyfriend's family was very impressed =]

Very Runny!!! I even added flour per other reviews.  However, the apples tasted delicious.  I made mine a la mode and poured the juice over the ice cream--yum!  But I can only give it 3 stars as the juice made my crust soggy and even after sitting overnight in the fridge it was still runny.

As recommended by other reviews I did add some flour. I used a mix of granny smith and golden delicious apples. I also glazed the top with milk, cinnamon and sugar. It was very good.

This was my first time making apple pie and I loved it!  I wish I would've read the reviews, though, because mine too was a bit runny when still warm.  I also reduced the sugar to about half a cup and it was the perfect sweetness (I used golden delicious apples).  I also added the pinch of nutmeg as suggested.  yummy!  I will be making this again for sure!

For my first time making pie from scratch it turned out very good. It was very watery like everyone else stated but I didn't mind. I forgot to add the butter at the last layer,  it still turned out fine. 

I made the crust from a recipe on this site( Pastry for single-crust pie) and it was very good.

This was delicious!  I'm not exactly an experienced pie maker, but we had a lot of apples from our tree, and baking is better than painting the greenhouse (my other alternative), so I decided to make apple pie.  This is definitely a keeper.... straightforward and easy. Next time I will slice my apples a little thicker and see what happens, but they were great thin also! ;D

Not quite as good as the ones my mom made when I was growing up... a little too bland and too watery but easy to make and still good enough to eat.  Add more flour and nutmeg or something to it.

Excellent!  I made this for a dinner party of foreigners...they wanted to taste a real American dessert.  They were all very pleased with this recipe and so was I; it was so easy and very delicous!

This was so easy to make, and it turned out SO good. I made it on Thanksgiving, and my boyfriend had three *hugs* pieces. We only had 4 people and the entire pie was gone almost instantly. I used granny smith and fugi apples. It was a perfect mixture of tart and sweet. I will *definitely* make this again.

this was my first apple pie and it was a huge success. I used about 4 medium sized Granny Smiths. I will try Cortlands next and then a mixture of apples after that to find the perfect blend. Definately do a egg wash (1 egg and 1tbsp milk) with leftover sugar/cinnamon mixture. Thank you for posting.

i followed other reviewers recommendations and used granny smith, mix the apples with flour, cinammon and sugar together before assembling in the crust, but it turned out runny. I used golden delicious in the first time and it was ok. somehow i think with granny smith, you have to mix less and add more flour. ( I added only 2 tbsp) will add 4 tbsp of flour next time. Mixing longer seems to draw the moisture out from the apple and cause it runny in the end.

Very easy to make.  I make one crust pies to cut calories... it was a little runny for my taste, and next time I will try some cornstarch or something to thicken it?  But it had a wonderful clean taste.  I also added a bit more butter than called for, and only used about half of the sugar mix.  I think this is a lovely, simple recipe, and super easy to make.  My daughter and I had an easy and fun time of it!  I'll work on it to get it to where we'd like it, but it was yummy!!!  :)

I followed the recipe using Granny Smith Apples. It was easy to make.I did however sprinkle a few drops of lemon juice concentrate to the top of the apples before placing the top crust on it. Also after taking it from the oven I glazed it with a mixture of powdered sugar & water with about 3-4 drops of lemon juice concentrate added. I thought it was a wonderful tasting pie. Next time though I will make it in a deep dish and make my own crust.

Since I changed this recipe a bit to make it perfect, I had to give it 4 stars. I did add some flour to the sugar mixture, and a pinch of nutmeg. But other than that, this is a GREAT recipe. I made it using the Oil Pie Crust recipe also on this site.

This was my very first apple pie and it couldn't have been easier.  I was a bit disappointed though. I used all Granny Smith apples and squirted a bit of lemon juice on the apples before adding the sugar and cinnamon.  Can you say, "soup"?!  I was very disappointed (and embarrassed) to find all this liquid at the bottom of my dish!  Although my friends said it was very good, I decided to try a different recipe and it turned out much better.  This recipe is great for first-timers.

I used apples from my backyard apple tree that I had sliced and frozen last fall.  When I defrosted them I eliminated alot of the juice that would be produced cooking fresh apples.  Therefore I didnt need to add any flour to the recipe- it was perfect!
I did, however, use only about a third to half of the sugar.  Served it with vanilla frozen yogurt. It got rave reviews at our game night gathering!

This apple pie was AMAZING! it was my first time ever making a pie from scratch and it was surprisingly pretty easy. After reading the reviews, I decided to add 2 tbsp of flour to the apples to  thicken up the mixture (I cut the recipe in half). I also had to bake it for 15 minutes longer at 350 degrees F since the crust on the bottom was under cooked. Other than that, the apples tasted amazing (I used about 6 small green apples) and after dividing the recipe in half, I didn't add any extra sugar (even though I used green apples) since I'm not a fan of overly sweet things.

Looks and smells delicious. After reading reviews I decided to add lemon juice, nutmeg, and brown sugar. I also egg washed the crust and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. My first time ever baking a pie. Will update after I try it

This was my first attempt at an apple pie, and I really wasn't sure how it would turn out or if I was doing it right at all! I mixed the 2/4 of white sugar with one 1/4 cup brown sugar and I also mixed some egg to brush the top of the pie with.  After that, I sprinkled some of the sugar/cinnamon mix on it.  It looks absolutely stunning, and tasted perfect!  I used Ambrosia apples, but they're not too mushy at all :)

Very good pie. Made with apples off my own tree as well. Only con is it wasn’t a “wet” as I thought it would have been but it wasn’t a bad thing as it held together very nicely.

This is an excellent recipe. As Carol suggested, I added a dash of nutmeg. I also doubled the cinnamon, because I just really love that flavor, and the sugar mixture seemed not quite cinnamony enough for me.

After picking apples with my family,  I made this simple pie exactly as written. We wanted the apples to be the star of the show. It took an extra 15-20 minutes in the oven to start to bubble, so I covered loosely with foil to keep the crust from burning. We thought it was delicious, served it warm with vanilla ice cream and it didn't last long. Next time I will probably mix the sugar/cinnamon mixture with the sliced apples and dump it all in just to make it a little easier.

I love this recipe. I did modify it slightly. I added a mounded tablespoon of flour and then cinnamon and a little nutmeg. I mixed everything thing in a bowl and then tossed with the apples to get them evenly coated. I use half Granny Smith and half Johnathon apples. It makes a great flavor. I would also cover your crust with a pie crust shield and remove it the last 15-20 minutes.

I never knew it was so simple! But i did tweak the recipe per my family's opinion.  used store-bought dough 
I added more sugar (only brown), more cinnamon, added little lime juice and nutmeg mixed all with the apples. And brushed the top with an egg & milk, sugar! 

I have to thank all of the people who commented on those things, thanks, and i knew it would help because my family loves sweets

Absolutely delicious! I don't like apple pie but my husband does however he refuses to pay the regular prices in store. I received some apples from a coworker and decided to whip up a pie for the greatest man in the world. I used just over half the sugar/cinnamon mixture because I love the tart apples and it turned out beautifully! I have found a pie recipe that even I enjoy eating. Thank you for posting this recipe!!!

This is a GREAT pie. I used Pie Crust IV for this recipe. I didn't like the crust as much as I thought I would. The crust could of been more sugary. The pie filling was delicious, but I will use a different pie crust.

I made this apple  pie for the second time. I took Kim advise and added lemon & flour to make less watery to the apples in bowl & also brushed on the top crust egg wash and sprinkled with 1 tablespoon of sugar wow what a difference the second time around. This pie was delicious  by the way I used granny apples. Thank you for another great recipe.

Came out delicious!!! I changed the recipe a little bit. I put a whole stick of butter with sunflower oil in a pan on very low heat, with cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, and a small amount of granulated sugar. I whisked it  to a perfect spice sauce,  poured the thinly sliced apples in and tossed them in the butter sauce. Then I  let the mixture cool for a few minutes while I prepared the premade dough into the pie dish. I also sprinkled a little more cinnamon on to the unbaked dough, placed apples on top, with small amounts of butter on top of apples, placed top crust, melted butter and sprinkled granulated sugar on top. Baked according to directions.

I made this pie yesterday and it turned out to be a soupy mess the additional butter it called to be placed on the top layer proved to be not worthy. Typically cornstarch or flour is used to help thicken the syrup. I should have done that but I didn't, I followed the recipe.

I followed the recipe religiously. But I should have read the review before making it. It was kinda runny but good.  Will follow other suggestion to add flour and lemon juice next time. And egg wash the top before baking.

This recipe is nice because it is simple and has few ingredients. I peeled the apples. I used my friend's apple slicer/corer. Then I diced/cut the apples. I put the apples, sugar, and cinnamon in a huge measuring cup and stirred them with a spatula.  
The apple pie turned out looking good. We will eat it tonight for dessert with French vanilla ice cream. I hope it tastes as good as it looks.

I was looking for a tasty apple pie recipe that showcased the heart of this classic dessert, the apple. This recipe does that without extra frills or excessive sweetness! I used Haralson apples that made the filling perfectly tart and the filling was well set. The only change I made was adding 2 tablespoons of lemon juice to prevent apple browning. Overall, an excellent recipe!

It was great! I would definitely make it again, but I would only use 4 cups of apples.

I made it exactly as written, and the only thing I didn’t like is the nutmeg.  I think I’m not a nutmeg fan.  I used a pre-made Pillsbury crust, which I would only rate 3 stars.  Just a note: this is the exact same recipe as in my Betty Crocker cookbook, which is 58 years old.

This recipe was the easiest and quickest apple pie recipe I've ever used.  It tasted amazing! I will use this from now on.  It cut out extra steps and kept all of the flavor!  Excellent!!

The only recommendation I would make is that mine cooked faster (by 10 minutes) being on the bottom shelf.   Next time I will move it up a little.

I don't know what I did wrong but this didn't work. I've made apple pie several times and often have to tweak the recipe but this gave me slightly sugared apple slices in a bunch of liquid. it didn't carmalize or hold up.

This recipe works well for me. After making it a couple of times, I started adding about 2 tablespoons of flour and using 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. I mix the cinnamon, flour, and sugar in a bowl and then toss the apples in to coat them before putting them into the crust. I often forget to put the butter in - I don't know why. It seems to be fine without it.

My family raved about this pie. I don't bake that often. So when I heard all the oooo's and awwwws, I knew I had a hit. I used 1/2 cup of sugar, and 2 tblsp. Of cornstarch. Will make it again.

This pie was delicious, but needs a little flour or cornstarch. The filling did not thicken at all during baking and was much too watery. Would make again though!

Found this recipe when I realized I was out of lemons  ... I added the vanilla as previously suggested and added a dab of nutmeg for that holiday smell .. I was skeptical without the lemons BUT hubby said it was better then the other pies I've made so I now say lemons who?

I was supposed to make mini apple pies for a dinner and overslept so I looked up the simplest recipe and this was it! I made mini versions in my Pampered Chef mini pie pans and they cooked so quickly!!!! I had leftover filling and used it in another recipe from Pillsbury! Awesome recipe! Thanks alot!:)

Instead of layering the apples with the sugar I just mixed the apples, sugar, and cinnamon together. I forgot to put butter on top of the apples but never the less it turned out delish! I make my own crust. 
I cut strips of tin foil and cover only the crust to bake; this makes sure the crust doesn't burn. I remove the tin foil for the last 5 minutes.
My family always loves when I make apple pie!

I've made this pie so many times and it's great every time. I never read the reviews, but when I did it made sense to add the flour. My pie always came out soupy. I still loved the flavors and so did everyone else!

Made mine with granny smith apples and a solid top. Next time I make it I'll add a little flour to the sugar to thicken up the juices. Excellent flavor.

I made this according to directions, except I used only 1/2 cup of sugar.  It was good, but slightly dry.  Next time I will use the 3/4 cup sugar, a little lemon juice, a little water, and mix it all together before putting it in the pie.

Got these fresh apples and made this pie, used light brown sugar, pie was delicious.  Simple to make. Used store bought crust. Gonna make my own crust next time and use a glass plate instead of metal pie plate. First pie ever made.

This recipe is just like the apple pies my mom used to make.  The secret is the apples.  You must get the right apple.  Don't use a Macintosh as they will cook to mush.  I bought mine from a local farmer in Pa.  I don't know what the name of the apple is but it has green mottled skin, firm and slightly tart flesh.  Absolutely delicious and easy to make.

It is delicious!! I used coconut sugar instead of white and it was delicious.  As I transition to a healthier lifestyle, I worry that some substitutions won't taste as good.  This was NOT the case this time!

I added a little lemon juice. The pie was delish, but the filling was a little runny, so will try a tablespoon of flour. Easy recipe, will most definitely make again.

This recipe was  so easy and simple.  Did add the flour to help filling "set" and tossed the apples with the sugar (used brown sugar)/cinnamon mixture.  Actually had extra filling leftover, so added a bit of water and some butter, reduced over low heat, chopped up the apples slices with a pastry blender and voila, caramel apple topping to pour over the ice cream and pie.  Will be making this one again!

So I tried this recipe, no idea what kinda of apples I used. I just picked up the ones sold in bags of 8. On the outside the pies look perfect! But on the inside it was quite wet and runny, especially towards the middle.

I did as suggested and used 2 tablespoons (I was afraid it would be too dry if I used 4) of floor with the cinnamon sugar mixture but that didn't seem to help much. The pie is delicious. Just wet as hell. =) I'll use 4 tablespoons next time.

I would like to give this recipe 4.5 stars. The only changes I make are adding a tablespoon or so of lemon juice to the apples if they aren't very tart. Instead of sprinkling I coat the apples in a bowl before dumping them in the pie shell. Also add 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken juices and do a milk/ egg wash on top.

I didn't change a thing. I even used the nutmeg.  The first night the nutmeg was a little different and my husband said no on the nutmeg, but the next night he changed his mind. He told me not to change a thing.  The apple pie got better as it aged. Did I mention it was my very first home made pie crust and all.  I used the "Easy Flaky Pie Crust".  The pie was gone in three days.  Thank you Carol for sharing such an awesome pie.

We love the taste of this recipe.  The only problem that I had was that the pie was very soupy and runny.  I added 3 tbs. of flour but this was not enough.  I would like to make this again as my family really love it, but not sure on how to make less runny.

This apple pie was super easy to make. I made it the night before thanksgiving and it probably could've stayed in the oven a little longer as the crust seemed a little under done. I simply through it in the over for 20 additional minutes on low before serving it warm to my guests.

Perfect, simplicity is best!  I've made pies before and I don't like to get fussy or have the filling turn out tasting like the canned stuff.  Special thanks to my neighbor who has an apple tree (Haralson apples).

This was my first-ever apple pie from scratch and it was so easy and simple.  The only very mild complaint I had about it was that it was far too sweet, I'm going to use half the sugar next time I make it.  I did add a dash of nutmeg and a lattice top crust, but other than that stuck to the recipe and it wasn't watery.  I'm very pleased with how it came out and will be making it again (with a bit less sugar).

This recipe tasted great but it ended up a bit soupy. I think I added too much butter. Other than that I loved it! My friends kept asking me for more. I felt bad when my mother didn't get to get a piece because my Dad ate it all! I'll have to make it again some time!

Very good. I added some corn starch so that it wasn't runny and used about 8 gala apples. I might use more sugar next time.

This pie, coupled with an awesome crust, was a big hit at a recent dinner party.  I added 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the filling for a truly magnificent pie.

This is a pretty basic apple pie recipe but mine didn't come out the way it was suppose to. :) Well this WAS my 1st time making a pie of this kind so I blame it being my 1st time and I learn as I go. Mine came out dry though and I added about a bit of flour to each layer, about 2tbsp total to entire pie. I used Gala apples and they are suppose to be juicy but for some reason mine came out dry. :( oh well. I'll try again next time! Maybe I won't add but a pinch of flour maybe none at all! I also totally forgot to add butter :-/ so maybe that is why? I am not sure..Ill try again in the future and as I said I learn as I go but what I did come up with was pretty delicious anyways ;) especially after cooling down and being in the fridge over night :)
I added cardemum along with cinnamon!! Mmm!

This was a very simple 123 step recipe.  Very delicious.  I forgot to add flour to thicken juices as everyone suggested.  So I just poured some of the excess juice out of pie about 20 minutes before removing.  It came out perfect, not runny at all. Everyone in my family loved it.  Thanks for the recipe and taking the intimidation out of pie baking.  My first time baking an apple pie.  I know I will use this recipe again and again.

So, so, so simple.  I was going to add a little flour, forgot, and was perfectly happy with the turn out.  There was a bit of juice in the bottom of the pan, but it scooped out fine.  I didn't add all of the sugar (roughly only 1/2 cup's worth).  It would have been too sweet with all of the sugar.  Great recipe.  I'd make it again.

Very good basic pie reicpe.  I added some fresh lemon juice to keep the apples from browning (I also just like the way it contrasts with the sweetness), and added a bit more cinnamon than was called for, as I like a spicy apple pie.

Easy recipie and my pie was a hit!  I coated the apples with a little flour before layering them in the pie, so that it would't be watery.  However I also added a little more butter than called for.  This recipe even tasted good with lactose free margarine, I highly recommend it!

Excellent!  Very easy to make, the hardest part is preparing the apples.  I used two frozen pie crusts from the store.  I filled one frozen crust and I topped the pie with the other one.  It turned out great and my wife thought I actually made the crust!

I (like everyone else!) added 4 T. flour to the dry mixture, but I didn't toss the mixture with the apples like other reviewers- I layered like the recipe called for. Not runny at all like my other apple pies have been. I've found my new staple recipe!

Everyone loved this pie!  I used Jonagold apples and added 4T flour, another teaspoon of cinnamon, another tablespoon of butter, and one teaspoon of vanilla extract.

So simple, and so delicious.  I used Cortland apples, and didn't change anything other than mixing everything in a plastic bag before layering in pie crust.  This is the best pie recipe I've ever made.  And my Thanksgiving guests agreed, too.

Great pie. Used macs. I added 4 tbs flour and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and mixed as others suggested. Will brush egg or milk on crust next time.

Nice and easy apple pie.  I used commercial tenderflake crust (works out perfectly).  I added 4 tablespoons of flour with the sugar and cinnamon and toss with apple pieces before putting into crust instead of sprinkling them on.  the pie was still a little runny, maybe I need to let it cool and set longer...but flour is defintely necessary.

This pie was very good, but I used Gala Apples instead of the typical Granny Smith. Well that was my fault. Oh well, besides my mistake, the pie was wonderful (and even better when topped off with vanilla ice cream!) :)

I used this recipe the first time I ever made pie, and it was so easy.  I made three of these over Christmas last year and gave one away as a gift and had two at home, the second of the ones I had at home was a request by my mother for a dessert for Christmas dinner!

This was a FANTASTIC recipe and I’m not a big apple pie fan! I used Johnagolds for the apples. I haven't used them before and they were delicious. I should have added a bit more flour to make it less soupy on the bottom but after the pie cooled a bit, it wasn’t as noticeable. I omitted the lemon juice as one of the recipients is allergic to lemon and it still turned out very tasty. Make sure to bring the vanilla ice cream to top this pie and you’ll have a huge hit on your hands!

I was very pleased with this recipe. We had to cut the pie almost as soon as it came out of the oven. There was a little juice in the bottom, but as the pie cooled it was absorbed. Would recommend adding a little flour as mentioned by others, especially if you want to eat it hot. Overall, a very good recipe. My husband and kids really enjoyed it. Will be making often. Thanks Carol!
