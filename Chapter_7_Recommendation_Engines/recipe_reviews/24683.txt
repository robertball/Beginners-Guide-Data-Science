This was good! Pay attention to the instructions since it neglected to tell you about the second layer of beans.

This was GREAT! I used two tortillas on the bottom and only one between the other layers. I probably will only use one on the bottom next time. I also omitted the red pepper, and it turned out just fine.
  It has a nice "kick" to it, and even my husband liked it (he's very meat and potatos). Next time I might try some Rotel tomatos with chilis mixed in with the chorizo.

This recipe is great.  I used turkey sausage to omit some of the fat; turned-out great!

I gave the basic recipe 4 stars, as I always change things as I try them, based on our preferences.  Anyhow, I cooked the chorizo with the garlic and onions, then when almost done, I added a can of black beans, drained but not rinsed.  After they got a little tender, I then added our own homemade salsa, very spicy and that became my sausage mixture for layering.  I also used Mexican "melting cheese" instead of pepper jack and mixed in a little cheddar.  Lastly, I fried my tortillas and layed 2 of them out side by side in the bottom of a glass casserole dish, no problem cutting them as others had mentioned.   From there I followed the directions for cooking, ended up with three layers, not really "torte" like, but turned out very good, topped it off with a little sour cream, we loved it.

I 1st have to give out a shout to "mauigirl" for emailing me this recipe when she found out I was making the "Tweaked Homemade Chorizo"recipe from the site...I totally am glad I made this. It was wonderful. I had a few little bumps in order to stay to a T with this recipe. But it wasn't something I was looking to tweak at all. But it was worth the 4 days I had to wait on the chorizo to try this. It's excellent. My hubby got the wrong size tortillas, and after a suggestion from mauigirl, I did the same as she did. I used a springform cake pan, it was just awesome doing that...note to others: better then a pie plate and more presentable. Layers hold up better and you can easily put thing in evenly. So I had the 12-in tortillas, and I knew the mixes & toppings wouldn't accomendate. So I used the whole batch of the chorizo recipe, increased the onions 1/2 cup, garlic to 4 cloves, cheese by 1 cup more, refried beans 1/2 a can more, and well I didn't have enough roasted red peppers, so I accomendated with 1/2-3/4 cup of mild chunky salsa. It turned out awesome. I could have reduced the amount of tortillas to 4, as my opinion. And I think I'd totally try it with corn tortillas too. hmmm. Thank you. It was fabulous.

I have a healthier version from a long ago Family Circle recipe.  It's meatless, which is great for  going vegetarian.  I've been making it for years, and my picky daughter liked it too.  Preheat your oven to 374 and heat a bit of olive oil in a cast iron skillet.  Chop an onion, add it to the skillet & saute for 5 min or so, add 3/4 C. frozen corn kernels and saute another 5 min. until lightly browned.  Then add 1 tsp of dried oregano, 1/4 tsp of ground cumin and a crushed or chopped garlic clove and saute for a minute.  Add 2 Tbsn flour and cook 1 min., stirring.  Add 1 15 oz can of chopped tomatoes, undrained, 1 can of black beans, drained, & 1 small can of chopped green chilis.  Cook 2 min. or until thick. Remove all and place in a bowl.  Then cut 6 6" corn tortillas (you can use more if you need them).
Spread about half a cup of the bean mixture over the bottom of the skillet, half of the tortillas overlapping if necessary, then half of remaining bean mixture over that, sprinkle w/ a few green onion, sliced and some chopped cilantro if you want.  Then place the remaining tortillas and remaining bean mixture.  Top w/ 1/4 c corn, 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese & 1/2 tsp paprika.  Bake for 30 min. Let stand for 8 or so min.  Serve w/sour cream, salsa or whatever you want.  

Note the only fresh things you put in were the onion & the scallions.  Straight from the cabinet & tastes fresh and great!  Trust me!  I also shred some cabbage,mango & lime juice to serve with it.

I've been looking for this recipe for weeks (I had this a long time ago).  Anyway I made this for Cinco de Mayo and it is so good! I used an 8" cake pan with 2" high sides and it fit in there nicely. My store didn't have chorizo, so I used regular sausage and added some crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper and hot sauce to spice it up and it turned out just how I remember-DELICIOUS!

Awesome!  I made this for dinner last night and my husband and I both loved it!  He quickly packed up the leftovers and declared them to be "his lunch for tomorrow".  

I always try to make a recipe exactly as it's written the first time I make it, but I had to make changes to this one based on what I had on hand and what the other reviewers advised.  So here's what I did:

Instead of chorizo, I used leftover shredded chicken because that's what I had

Used whole wheat tortillas because we always use whole grains

Used low fat Mexican blend shredded cheese

skipped the red peppers

Added a can of corn because we love all "corny" things :)

So I used a glass pie pan, sprayed it with PAM.  Laid down one tortilla rather than two based on prior reviews, and I'd say they were spot on with that recommendation.   Then I put in 1/2 of my chicken mixture, to which I added 1/2 can of enchilada sauce because is just looked like it needed it!  Sprinkled with cheese and then laid down the next tortilla and spread that with 1/2 can of beans and sprinkled with cheese.  Next tortilla and remainder of chicken and a sprinkle of cheese.  Last tortilla and remainder of beans topped with the other 1/2 can of enchilada sauce and then the remaining cheese.  I then took a sharp knife and poked holes down through the layers for the enchilada sauce to seep into.  Baked at 350 for about 35-40 minutes.  It was FABULOUS.  We will make this one regularly for sure!

This was fabulous!  I only layered one tortilla at a time since they were lo carb and very filling, used two different cheeses, cheddar and hot pepper, and loads of roasted red peppers.  This is a new favorite!  Thank you so much!

I don't know how this was supposed to fit in a 10 inch pie plate.  I put mine in a  9x13 and I couldn't even fit it all in there.

This was just Delish!  Earlier in the day, I had  made home made salsa and put a layer of that down first.  I used 2 layers of flour tortillas and in between  I put shredded sharp cheese. I mixed the chorizo with the beans and layered it all the way up the casserole pan. I popped it in the nuker  for 10 minutes and dinner was Done! The family Was skeptical when I told them what it was. After one bite, they were hooked! Super Yummy! I will keep this one around for Sure!  Thanks Tsfoust!

I made this AGAIN last night. This is down right delicious! Only thing I changed...I sprinkled a little cheese in the layer where the peppers are to keep it from sliding off while eating.

We loved this. I made it for breakfast and served it with two over easy eggs and salsa. I also used my own refried beans. Had no roasted pepper, but it was great without it. YUMMY! UPDATE.....I use a springform pan to accomodate the size of the tortilla I have on hand and It also holds together better. I do use the double layers of tortillas as directed. I have done this with ground turkey or ground turkey seasoned with taco seasoning. I do not do the roasted red peppers cuz I think it doesn't need it. The canned mild green chilis are important though and for those who think they might be hot, they are NOT. Just a nice flavor. I serve this with sliced black olives, Sliced green onions, sour cream and salsa. ONO BTW I make this with the refried beans without the refry from this site. They are way better than canned beans and so easy to make in your slow cooker.

I made the following alterations to make it more to my tastes: used corn tortillas instead of flour, used Chihuahua cheese instead of pepper jack, and omitted the green & red peppers (I just mixed a can of Rotel in with the cooked chorizo instead). I did three layers - first chorizo mixture & cheese, then beans, then chorizo mixture & cheese. I cooked it in my cast iron combo cooker and it turned out great. What I really loved about the corn tortillas was that they didn't get soggy and the bottom ones crisped up a lot, which added some great texture. If you have a Mexican grocer near you, buy house-made chorizo. The quality is far superior to the pre-packaged stuff you can buy at the store (and it's much less greasy).

This was very good. I used monterey jack cheese instead of the pepper jack. I didn't understand dividing the beans. There was no further directions with the other half of beans so I used the whole can instead of dividing it.

A Home Run!  Great meal!  Easy to prep.  I only used 1 tortilla between layers, expect for the bottom - used 2 there.  Chorizo is difficult to find here in redneck country, so I used hot Italian sausage - outstanding!  And the cheese?  Sorry I probably used a little more at each step it was called for.  I used a "fiesta blend" usually found at the market instead of pepper jack, since I had it on hand.  I also used one of the other reviewer's suggestion and used a can of Ro-tel tomatoes and chiles (drained), but I still used the called for 4 oz can of chiles, drained.  It's a "Keeper" and will go into my recipe book.

First time using Chorizo. We enjoyed it. I would however, enjoy another texture with it. Something with a crunch.

I used to make this all the time out of my Betty Crocker cookbook before my husband and I were married.  It was one of our favorites.  The chorizo can be really salty(which I forgot about), so you can just do ground beef with taco seasoning.  Tonight I switched out the Pepper Jack and used Colby Jack, and left out the chilis so it wouldn't be too spicy for my kids.  If it were just the hubby and me, I would make it as written except maybe use taco meat instead.  Awesome!

Overall, very tasty & spicy!

I had to modify this recipe a bit b/c i didn't have a 10" pie pan. I had a 9". That didn't make a HUGE difference, but I thought the ingredient amounts were WAY to much for even a 10". With these quantities, I believe you could get away with making 2 tortes (using 2 pie plates). OR you could halve the recipe. I only made one torte but I definitely had leftover sausage mixture.

Because of my pie plate size limitations, I could not use 2 tortillas on EVERY layer. Instead I only used 2 on the bottom, which I figured needed to be sturdy. 

If you are making 2, I would do it like this:
Line (2) 9 or 10" pie plates with 2 tortillas
Sprinkle sausage mix on tortillas
Sprinkle cheese over sausage mix
Cover w/ a tortilla
Spread refried beans over the tortilla
Cover w/ a tortilla
Put 6oz of roasted red peppers on tortilla
Place another tortilla on top.
If you have any sausage mix left, then top w/ that and more cheese or just top w/ a little cheese.

* I only made 1 torte and I used 1/2 pound chorizo combined with 1/2 pound ground beef and I still have a little over a cup of the mixture left, so you could definitely halve this recipe if you are only using one pie pan.

If you follow it as written the charizo completely over powers all the other flavors and is very salty; using the two tortillas with each layer makes it really hard to cut.  My family and I love Mexican food but this was a no keeper unless it was drastically altered.

This was excellent, but the roasted red peppers got to go. husband would not eat because hot stuff causes problems. The rest of us enjoyed it, but had to drink water with every bite. (We are out of milk which I know helps more)I like med. spicy and had no idea those canned peppers were that strong. I will tweak it next time to bring down the burn so we can all eat. the recipe was easy and quick so still gave it a five because of that and tasted wonderful, plus frugal.

This was sooo good!  Instead of onion and green chiles I used a can of Rotel, omitted the red peppers, and added fresh cilantro and cumin.  YUM!! My family loved it!

Absolutely wonderful, but I used fresh jalapenos, and topped it with shredded lettuce, yogurt and sliced tomatoes.  Everyone had seconds!

Delicious! My whole family loved this recipe and my 11 yr old son keeps telling me I have to make it again VERY soon! I did not have the red peppers or refried beans so I omitted them and after reading some reviews, added a can of drained black beans and some green enchilada sauce. I doubled this recipe since we have a large family and I made one torte in the pie dish and one in a springform pan (following recommendation from another reviewer) and the torte in the springform pan turned out better. It was more solid in its consistency, easier to cut and serve and had more depth.

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome - What a yummy meal that is quite filling. I omitted the roasted red peppers since I didn't have any and used corn tortillas instead of flour. Note: I only used 1 tortilla per layer and instead of the torte I made this more like a casserole layered in a casserole pan.  I also added roasted corn to the layers and for the last 10 minutes of the bake I added a homemade enchilada sauce with green chilis and tomatoes.  
To serve I topped these off with sour cream, black olives and guacamole.

This was great and my kids loved it. I used a mixture of chorizo and ground turkey and added taco seasonings with the meat onions and garlic. I did not use the green chili's because i did not have them but added a medium salsa. i also did not add the roasted red peppers. I used a combination of cheddar, Colby jack and Quaso cheese. I also only used single layers of tortillas and used a spring form pan. Looked great and tasted awesome.

Loved it.  I made smaller individual tortillas, building each on a salad plate, then baking for less time (20 minutes covered).  Put the hot salad plates on non-hot dinner plates to serve so no one gets burned.
The last 10-15 minutes without cover is important to brown the cheese.
I will make this again and it's easy to make your own tweaks.

Easy and delicious! I used 8 inch tortillas without any problems. 2 tortillas on the bottom, 1 between the meat and beans, then 2 between beans and red peppers (both under peppers & over), 1 between beans and topping of meat & cheese. Mine just fit into the pie pan! Not hard to cut. I used spicy chipotle refried beans.

This was really really good! I did make just a few slight changes. I was worried about the tortillas getting hard on the bottom layer so I used a few spoons full of salsa then used 2 tortillas. I layered the meat mix minus the green chilis, just one tortilla,  half the beans and some cheese, a layer of green chilis rather than red sprinkled with garlic salt, another tortilla, the remainder of the beans and chorizo mix. Nothing huge changed just cut back on the amount of tortillas mostly. Family enjoyed it will be something I make again!

I think I expected too much with this.  It was just so-so with me.  It was way too over-done on the bottom and it didn't have a lot of flavor.  Also, it didn't tell you what to do with the other half of the beans.

Well before making this I knew ahead of time I'd have to make some adjustments... so I can't really give a true rating for this exact recipe.  I substituted 1 lb. hamburger for the sausage, used Colby/Jack cheese, and omitted the roasted red peppers all together. (my kids and I don't do spicy too well).  With that being done, I seasoned the hamburger with about 1/2 tsp ground cumin, to give it some flavor (in addition to the onion and garlic).  When I went to layer everything, I realized that my pie pan (even though it's deep dish) wasn't tall enough for that many tortillas or layers... so I minimized it.  One daughter liked it, the other didn't, my husband ate it but didn't want to save the left overs (good indication not to make it again), and I thought it was just 'ok'.  It's not a bad recipe, I'd make it again, but not too often, maybe just once in a while for something different than taco night.

As soon as I read this recipe I knew I had to try it. Problem is...it’s mid-summer and I really didn’t want to use the oven in the kitchen. I assembled the torte in a cast iron skillet and baked it outside on the gas grill! My only mistake was I should have not used the burners directly under the skillet...it got a bid charred. But, since it’s in layers, we just didn’t eat the bottom layer and the burnt flavor did not permeate the rest of the torte. I’m going to try it this way again...just adjust my cooking method.
I've since made this a second time using two tortillas on the bottom only one tortilla between each layer. It's much better this way and less "doughy." Also baked it in a regular over.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I did change it up a little though. First, I browned hamburger meat (instead of the sausage). I added the roasted peppers to the chile meat mixture. I had only one layer of beans so overall I had only 3 layers but it was great! I think using fewer layers and less tortillas cuts out a lot of calories.

I substituted diced chicken breast for the chorizo and  added 3 T olive oil, 2 t. Montreal Chicken seasoning and 1 t. ground chipotle pepper to Step 1.  I also used corn tortillas instead of flour.  The chicken made it a little harder to get all the layers into a pie plate, so I had tortillas-chicken mixture-cheese-tortillas-beans-tortillas-chicken-red peppers-cheese.   Served it up with sour cream and salsa.   DELICIOUS!!!

I made this for a Mexican themed Superbowl potluck.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 pie plates.  I also followed some of the other users reviews and used only 1 tortilla instead of 2 for each layer.  It looked beautiful.  I got many compliments at the potluck.  Everyone enjoyed this dish and I will definitely be making it again.  Oh and for those people who are nervous about the spiciness, it's not too spicy either.

If your family doesn't like spicy just use ground beef seasoned with salt and a little cumin and omit the chilis and red peppers. Without the peppers I end up using 6 tortillas.  I also spread the beans on two tortillas and sprinkled cheese on the beans.  My kids do not like beans, but they love this recipe and always clean their plates!

The Spicy Mexican Torte was very easy and tasted wonderful!  I used salsa in place of the peppers and chilies.  If you don't like it spicy I'm sure plain hamburger would work just as well.

This was delicious- even my four year old ate it (with sour cream to cool down the spices). Only substitutions were chopped green bell pepper cooked with sausage in place of roasted red pepper and mozzarella cheese, both due to not having recipe ingredients.

This is really good. I did not make it with the chiles or roasted peppers, as I couldn't find them easily at my grocery, but it could only add to the flavor. I used gluten free tortillas and didn't double them up as written in the recipe (simply because GF tortillas are pricey); also added a 12 oz. can of chicken to the chorizo as I didn't have a full pound of the sausage, but otherwise I made as written. We cut like a pie and put each slice on a bed of chopped lettuce and topped with slices of avocado and sour cream. Would be good with salsa too.

Super simple and delicious, received repeated compliments!  Assembled the torte in a round casserole dish, more like a lasagna.  Layered the refried beans onto the tortilla, topped with the chorizo mixture and then used a can of diced tomatoes and peppers (Rotel type mix), two layers is plenty.  Only used 1/2 pound spicy chorizo, and one tortilla for each layer.  Reduced baking time to 30 minutes.  Cut up black olives and cilantro to add once the dish was plated.  The only complaint was, that I didn't make enough.  Definitely a keeper!

Yummy, will make again or sure. I added green bell peppers to the mix & would have used jalapeños if I had them. I also only used 1 tortilla for each layer, since that's all I had left. Very good!! We used venison chorizo ;)

I really enjoyed the flavor of this dish.  It was nice and spicy.  However, the texture was very mushy and not really appealing.

Very good! I did add a pound of shrimp to the chorizo mixture when it was just about cooked. I will save this recipe and make it again.

This was super easy to make. THe only change I made was using 1 tortilla on the bottom and between layers. If you are like my family this recipe serves 3-4 people. Next time I make this I think I will use jalapenos instead of chiles to add a little more kick to it.

This is good and easy to make.  I only used one tortilla for the layers and it was fine.  My husband thought it would be better with less refried beans but then he's not a big fan of them anyway.  I thought it was a perfect amount.

My very picky husband loved this!  Since he does not like red peppers, I instead did that layer with fat free refried black beans and thin slices of tomato.  Wonderful in outr opinion.  When my brother made this the next time, he added jalapenos instead of the green chilies to make it hotter.

I thought that this recipe needed a little more spicy and texture variety.  I rotated between a corn tortilla shell then to deep fried crispy strips.  I also added sauteed green onions.  Jalapenos add more of kick.

I left out the chilis and peppers. It was pretty good. I got a lot of raves about it. Probably wouldnt make it again w/ chorizo - maybe seasoned ground beef.

(Note: I made this with vegetarian chorizo and soy cheese)

Excellent taste, very easy to make. A wonderful "meal in itself" dish. Everyone here loved it. Very filling and inexpensive.
