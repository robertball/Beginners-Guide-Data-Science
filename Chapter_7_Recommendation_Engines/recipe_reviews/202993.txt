I love quinoa, although I have never made it before.  My husband is not very adventurous and probably wouldn't have tried it if I had told him what it was before I set the plate in front of him.  I just told him it was "like pineapple fried rice, but with a different grain" and he gave it a go.  He loved it, which says a lot!  My kids and I loved it, too.  It makes a lot, or at least I thought, but everyone wanted extra helpings, so it didn't last long.  I will definitely be making this again (and now I'll probably be able to get the hubby to try more quinoa dishes, as well.)

I made it exact to recipe, except I used probably a full cup of canned crushed pineapple -- however much was in a standard size can.  Crushed is the perfect size so you get some pineapple in each bite.  This was fantastic, and very easy, and I will definitely be making it again.

Very good. I added frozen peas to get more veggies, used yellow onion instead of green, and only 2 eggs. The flavor was excellent! So glad to have a new way to use quinoa!

This was amazing! However, i think that 3 cups of liquid would be too much, as the normal quinoa ratio is 1:2. So i only used 2c water, used sesame oil b/c i didn't have peanut,  used a yellow onion as that's all I had on hand, and didn't have cilantro. Also, didn't add pepper flakes as I thought it was spicy enough. My husband and I loved it and will be making this often!

Five cloves of garlic is overkill.  I would recommend one clove, maybe two if you really like garlic.  Also, there is too much extra liquid in the recipe.  The texture was too soft right out of the skillet and the leftovers were very mushy, more like oatmeal than quinoa.  I'd recommend leaving out the cup of water.

One word - YUM! My boyfriend even loved it which is a huge deal as he's a meat and potatoes guy. I made the quinoa in the rice cooker ahead of time. Then I added chili flakes and oil to a pan and cooked up chicken, added the garlic, onions and cilantro, then added egg. When the egg was cooked, I added quinoa to the pan, used a couple dashes of soy sauce and a few squirts of Siracha sauce. So good. I've been telling everyone about this recipe!

Fabulous!  I did decrease the chili oil by 1 Tablespoon to lower the heat, and I don't think it needs that much oil anyway.  We are meat eaters, so to make a heartier meal I also pan fry some chopped Mango Chicken Sausage (from Trader Joe's) to add to the mix.  Have made it multiple times to rave reviews - thanks!!

Very good with a bit of a spicy 'bite" to it!  My son-in-law begged for the recipe.  Due to what I had on hand, I subbed olive oil for peanut oil, more broth for the water, a small diced white onion for the green onion, used canned pineapple tidbits and added 1 1/2 cups diced cooked ham to make it a satisfying main dish.  Blend of flavors was just right!

I also added ham like another reviewer for more protein which was great.  Yummy with a good mix of flavors.  Not quite a 5 star for me - I tend not to measure too much and just toss things in and ended wishing I had added a bit MORE spice.

Boyfriend LOVED it! Asks for it constantly. I've made it several times, but last night I made it with deep fried tofu also and I even loved it. It's a great recipe to play with!

This dish is delicious!  I went ahead and gave it a try because it required all of the odd-ball ingredients my bare pantry had to offer tonight -- I was prepared for mediocre but wow, am I happy to report that this is fantastic!  I had only 2 eggs so I diced up a left-over baked chicken breast, and I added a stalk of celery that needed to be eaten.  Heeding previous reviews I didn't used as much soy sauce as called for initially but really, it needed that 1/4 cup; and I added a TBSP of canola oil because I didn't have enough peanut oil.  My boyfriend and I are ready to make this again with pork, or shrimp, a little ginger, red bell pepper...you get the idea.  This recipe is a keeper!

This is actually pretty good! I overdid my quinoa and didn't chop my pineapple as much as I should... but it was still great. Could be healthier without the yolk. Easy.

OMG this is good! The sweet pineapple, combined with the heat from the chili oil and red pepper is the perfect combo. Do not use 3 cups of liquid to cook your quinoa - you will end up with mush. Use 2 cups (the usual ratio for quinoa to water) and your quinoa will turn out perfectly done!  I used more cilantro than called for, and added it in right at the end after I took the skillet off the heat. I can see this working well with added shrimp. Also, you're really going to need to crank the heat when stir-frying everything together; medium-low isn't going to cut it and is just going to sit there and steam.

Have made this several times now, but made quite a few changes.  I use 2 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth or even just water) to cook the quinoa and it doesn't change the flavor.  2 cloves of garlic is plenty, 2 eggs and I don't bother with the onion or cilantro.  Have yet to try the peanut oil or chili oil, I just use 2 TBSP EVOO and then add chili powder.  Also, I only use 2 TBSP of low sodium soy sauce.  I prepare it on Sunday night to have for lunch during the week.  I usually just eat it cold.  So yummy and easy!

Delicious! I added some extra vegetables but I'm sure it would have been very good without them, too. :)

We didn't expect much from this recipe, as quinoa doesn't have a lot of flavour on its own but has my hubby said "It was the surprise star of the meal!".  Everything worked well together and even after a day in the fridge, the quinoa didn't get all dried out like rice sometimes does.  We would serve this to guests!

Absolutely delicious! I used the recipe more for inspiration and have a few recommended changes. Liquid to quinoa should be a 2:1 ratio. It came out to mushy and wasn't able to fry as well.  I also used a miso-ginger broth from Trader Joe's instead of the chicken broth. I added some more veggies, including mushrooms and red bell pepper. To make it a more complete meal, I poached chicken in the miso-ginger brother and added it on top. Yum! I would definitely make again.

My guy, who's not yet used to the texture of quinoa LOVED this... Nice flavor, used fresh pineapple. Used sesame oil + canola oil instead of peanut oil. Used garlic chili sauce instead of chili oil as I didn't have it on hand

Great recipe! I made two changes to the original recipe to make it a little healthier - 2 eggs or eggbeaters and 1/8 cup soy sauce. I also didn't have chili oil so I used 2 tbsp of peanut oil and added some chili seasoning. The quinoa dish came out delicious!

So it TASTED great. However, I followed the suggestions by other users to omit the cup of water and it was STILL wayyy too wet.  Maybe it was the type of quinoa I used, but I ended up having to let it boil off a ton of liquid at the end. 
I knew it would be it little but wetter because I used crushed pineapple, which has more juice, but the liquid problem was before I added it in.

However, it tastes amazing. Lots of flavor. I used more pineapple and pepper flakes than it recommended. The amount of eggs was perfect. I think it is better as leftovers because the chili oil has some time to really develop the flavors.

This recipe was awesome!! So yummy! I was craving pineapple fried rice, but only had quinoa and I am so happy I found this recipe!

 I didn’t have any of the oils in the recipe so I prepared mine with butter instead. Also did not use the pepper flakes. Instead I substituted with a little siracha. It was so good, even my husband loved it and he is not a quinoa fan!

I made this for our Friday night supper club as a side dish with Five Spice Chicken  (recipe from my cooking class.)  Everybody (all ten) absolutely loved it . I especially love this site because it changes the quantity of ingredients based on the number of servings you enter.  I did make changes.....used 2:1 ratio for the quinoa, so only the chicken broth (reduced sodium) any more liquid and it would be too mushy or soupy. I cut the chili oil from 1/4 cup to 2 tbsp. and it still had a bite to it.  I used garlic powder instead of cloves and didn't use the red pepper flakes as in my world that would be overkill with the chili oil.

I thought the flavors in this were very good and worked well together.  Personally, I would prefer it with rice over the quinoa.  I only used one cup of water and one cup of chicken broth instead of two because that is the ratio I normally use.

Great flavors! I cooked the quinoa with a 2:1 ratio like other reviewers and added chopped carrots, frozen peas and chicken. I also doubled the chili garlic sauce because I like spicier dishes.  Great recipe that you can tweak to your personal taste.

This was the first time I made/ate quinoa, and it came out really good.    I didn't have peanut oil or chili oil, so I used olive oil, as another reviewer suggested.  I also used crushed pineapple vs chopped, and it came out good.  I will definitely make it again, but next time, I'll use half the amount of crushed red pepper flakes.

This was delicious & easy to make. Even my picky 3 year old ate it!  I cooked the quinoa in broth only - I didn't add the extra cup of water - and it was still pretty wet once it was cooked. I omitted the pepper to keep the heat down for the kiddo, used low sodium soy sauce & reduced it to 3 Tbsp, and subbed 1/2 of a yellow onion since I had no green onions on hand. We got almost 5 (just shy of 1-cup each)servings out of this recipe - it makes a lot. Served it with grilled teriyaki chicken & steamed broccoli.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good, but I added half the soy sauce and it was still fine that way. Very creative recipe!

If i make it again, I would use less quinoa. I added tofu, which definitely helped. I used crushed pineapple but would have been better with tidbits. Quinoa just didnt have a lot of flavor and there was too much of it compared to other ingredients.

A very good and unique way to cook quinoa. I thought it was great, but i think i'll add less soy sauce next time. It made the quinoa too salty.

SO GOOD! Loved this recipe.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and omitted the cilantro. I also added in some seitan (faux meat) because I am a vegetarian. This was so tasty and I will surly make it again!

my wife and I made this today and it was really good, we both like quinoa and look forward to cooking it more often although there does'nt seem to be a lot of recipes for it.
