I used my crock pot and fresh apples from my farm.  I used 3 pounds apples, cored, peeled and cut into chunks, 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup water, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and a few sprinkles of cinnimon.  Cook on high for 4 -5 hours, just perfect!!!

Excellent! I only used a dash or two of sugar and added a couple of 4" cinnamon sticks to the simmering apples (mmmm!). I didn't process the apples - I mashed them up with my potato masher for a great chunky applesauce!

This is very tasty applesauce! I agree with the other posts about cutting back on the sugar. As it does depend on the apples your using. I would suggest that when you add the sugar, start with 1/4 c., add a little bit more sugar as you go along, tasting with each addition of more sugar. You can pretty much judge at that point how sweet you want it. I also added cinnamon. I also strained the apples before processing. There's nothing like fresh applesauce, thanks for this recipe!

YUMMY!  This was a big hit with my whole family.  My kids are fighting right now over who gets to eat the last bit of applesauce.  I drained the water once the apples were tender.  Didn't need to put them in the blender, just stirred with a whisk and the consistency came out perfect.  I added about 3 Tbs. brown sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, a pinch of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  Delicious!!!!

This was the best applesauce I've ever tasted. I would suggest cutting back on the sugar, though. It may have been that I had very sweet apples.

SUGGESTION: Save the apple broth after cooking the apples. You can make cidar or something with it. I used it in place of plain water for steamed rice a couple of days later. AWESOME!

Great, and so easy to make! It does take a bit longer than the recipe says, however. Next time, I'm going to make it in the slow cooker. It was a bit too watery, so don't use too much water! Try it with cinnamon!

Great recipe.  EASY, I used macintosh apples with one granny smith.  I did not put in the food processor or food mill.  Did not have to.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is wonderful.  I read the reviews first & cut back on the sugar. I'm using sweet eating apples so I added maybe 4 tablespoons of sugar & a little cinnamon. I highly recomend it.

Great applesauce recipe. I drained off the water and put the apples in my blender. Mine was sweet enough so that no sugar was needed.

My 7 year old just made this, and it and it's delicious!   We only added about 1/2 cup of sugar, and we DID NOT PEEL THE APPLES!!   I used my blender to puree the cooked apples, and it's super smooth.  Leaving the skin on didn't affect the texture at all, and it left in all the great vitamins!

Too much work. Save all the work of coring and peeling. I simply quarter apples WITH peel and core, fill crock pot to the top with apples, add 1/2 cup water, let it cook till apples soft. Pour all into apple mill and press through.....best and sweetest applesauce ever and only a tablespoon of seed and skin will be left in the mill.  Amazing use of all the apple without any peeling.  If you want to add sugar or cinnamon, return to crock pot and season.  I cook it down from here to make applebutter also.  I also can the applesauce straight from the crock pot when I bring back to a boil. I have apple trees and never peel or core when canning applesauce.  Everyone is amazed at how sweet it is without any sugar.

This is a very easy recipe for applesauce.  Mine didn't turn out very smooth (that's my own fault), but my toddler loved it anyway.  I only used half the sugar, and it was sweet enough; the kind of apple you use probably makes a difference.

For those of us who are novice enough to need a recipe for applesauce, this one should mention something about straining the apples (saving cooking juices) before processing, and adding back juice as needed for consistency. Otherwise you'll wind up, as I did, with apple soup. I would also reduce amount of sugar by half.

You can't get any simpler than this recipe. It was so fast and easy to make. I used a combo of Granny Smith and Pink Lady apples. I used a hand blender to puree my cooked apples, leaving it a little chunky. I added just 1/4 cup of sugar and that was plenty of sweetness for my taste. I think the one cup the recipe called for would make a sickeningly sweet sauce (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). When you make your applesauce, start with a small amount, taste and add a bit at a time until your desired sweetness level. I served these with latkes.

I'd never made applesauce before.  This became my "go to" recipe this fall.  We use freshly picked apples of a sweet and tart variety - 8 lbs total.  I used my smoothie maker to puree and the consistency was wonderful.  I added no sugar, 1/2 tsp each nutmeg & cinnamon and juice of 1/2 a lemon.  I also drained the apples and thank those who added that helpful hint.  I kept back some of the water, refrigerated it and replaced normal tap water with it to make morning oatmeal and cream of wheat. My kids can't get enough of this applesauce!  Thanks for sharing.  This was really easy to make.

I never knew applesauce was so delicious until I made it myself! I used Jonathan apples (NOT peeled or cored), filled a 12 quart stockpot, added just a bit of water (half cup?) and just a bit of sugar (half cup?) and sprinkled on the cinnamon. Let it simmer for an hour or two, stirring it down occasionally, then put it through my kitchenaid fruit & veggie strainer, and canned it in a waterbath canner. It's so much better than anything you can buy at the store. YUM.

After reading all the comments about the water, when I made this, last night, I drained the apples and put the cooked chunks in the food processor.  I suspect the draining part was left out of the recipe's instructions.  I added the juice of half a lemon to the cooking water, and the juice of the other half to the pulp in the processor.  I used no sugar and old Granny Smiths.  It was wonderful, just like that.  Then I tried adding a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to a 1 cup serving, which was also wonderful.

So, just drain the cooked apples and forget about the water quantity--just use enough to cover the apples, for simmering.

The first time I used golden delicious apples and lowered the amount of sugar and it was just ok. We used cinnamon to make it better.  The second time I made this I used Granny Smith apples and kept the amount of sugar as stated in the recipe and it was soooo good!!!  We didn't need any cinnamon that time.  I will never use store bought applesauce again.

I don't know if it was my apples, or if the lemon juice just really comes through in this, but I found it a bit tart. I guess I could have added more sugar, but the taste was a little off. The second time I make this I'm going to do it in the slow cooker without the lemon. UPDATE: I made this a second time in the slow cooker and barely had to add any sugar. I mashed it with a potato masher for a chunky applesauce and added a heavy sprinkling of cinnamon. This is how I'm going to make it from now on!

Not happy with it as written. Found that brown sugar instead of white and an addition of cinnamon make it more palatable. Also drained my apples.

Excellent!  I have been making applesauce using this basic recipe for years though with much less sugar.  But save yourself some time and trouble.  If you are using a food mill there is no need to peel or core the apples.  Just cut into chunks and cut out any bad parts.  The seeds etc will not go through the food mill.  For variety add cinnamon, or melt some red hot cinnamon candies into the still hot applesauce. Usually no need to put back on the stove if you run through food mill just after boiling.  The sugar/candies will melt just fine.  Enjoy!

I've made this many time during the fall when I didn't know what to do with all the apples from our apple tree!  I add only about 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of sugar for the best applesauce ever.

I loved this recipe, It was so easy, the only thing I did differently was put the apples in a bowl of water with the lemon juice so they didn't brown as I was peeling and coring the rest. Will make again.

Perfect for my homemade latkes!  I strained some of the water out and used my immersion blender.  Cut back a lot on the sugar because the apples I used were super sweet.

SKIP the sugar altogether, especially if you're using a sweeter apple.  There's no need for any sugar at all. I also use apple cider instead of the water (and cut back on the liquid - 1 cup maximum). It's incredibly easy if you core and peel the apples and put them in a crockpot overnight on low. No stirring, just let it cook.

This recipe is quick & easy, but too sweet. I halved the amount of sugar. I would also suggest using apple juice or cider as the liquid instead of water and adding cinnamon and a bit of ground cloves or nutmeg.

Great basic recipe - I used Empire apples, treated in lemon water to prevent browming, so at first I added no sugar but after cooking and pureeing the apples I found it too tart for my taste buds, never mind my daughter's.  So I added half the sugar and it came out perfect - not too sweet, just slightly tart, and very fresh-tasting.  I'll probably make a sugarless batch to use in baking, regardless of the apple type.

Try making this without sugar (or with very little).  The natural sweetness of the apples would be enough without adding more.  To really make a great applesauce add cinnamon and nutmeg   - YUM!  I've been doing this for years including when my girls were babies and they've grown up on it.

Excellent & easy recipe to eat right away, freeze or can.  For 20 years I've peeled & cored my apples & placed them in microwave w/1/4 Cup of water for 11-12 minutes on HI.  Simply remove bowl from oven, mash & add sugar & spices as preferred.  We like our sauce on the chunky side.  I often toss in a handfull of Red Hots candy in place of sugar & cinnamon.  It adds a rosy color. This year I used Honey Crisp apples....yummy!

Easy to make and very good. I boiled several granny smith apples until they were translucent. I picked up the apples with a slotted spoon and put them into a bowl. The apples broke apart as I stirred. Added 1/2 cup sugar, lemon juice, and cinnamon. Delicious!

I use a combination of apples with lots of red mackintosh. I core. cut in quarters and leave the skins on, gives the sauce a nice pink color. Strain them after cooking  We prefer a bit less sugar.  Also add cinnamon. (To taste)

Very good, but I didn't use that much water or sugar--I cut both in half.  I didn't want to strain the apples, and I had Red Delicious, which can be sweet, so I didn't want the applesauce to be too sweet.  There's another recipe on here that I tried that I like a bit better because it calls for cinnamon (I LOVE cinnamon), but this is a plain applesauce you can add almost anything too.  I had to simmer for another 10-15 minutes to get it to the right mushiness for applesauce.  It would be good for recipes since it is so plain.  I smoothed it out in the food processor for a lovely applesauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious...  And I usually don't care much for applesauce! I used granny smith apples and because I didn't have enough white sugar, I used a mix of both white and brown sugars, and it turned out amazing!

I also added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to to the applesauce...  And I took the advice of another reviewer and just used one cup water and 1/2 cup sugar.. And mashed the apples with a potato masher!

Really good and easy to make!  I've made this with and without sugar, using white and brown sugar and a combo of both.  Any way I've made it has been good.  You can also throw a bit of cinnamon in there for a bit of a change!

My modifications: used Granny Smith's, no sugar, no water, no lemon juice. Just popped the cooked apples into the blender and pureed. This "naked" applesauce came out just fine - the lemon juice can be added at serving time if desired.

This sauce came out Excellent!! I took advice from other reviews and used only barely enough water to cover and glad i did. It came out nice and thick, not runny. Also used 1 cup brown sugar in place of 1 cup white and 2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp apple pie spice. Will make again, can't wait to make this for my Dad next time i go to visit.

Yum!  I left the skins on and just cored the apples.  I used an immersion blender to mix.  I used Granny Smith apples and doubled the recipe.  It filled four widemouth bottles which I steam canned for 20 minutes after cooking the apples and adding the sugar.  I also only used about half of the cooking liquid.  If you put the sauce in bottles right away you don't need the lemon juice.  Mine turned out yummy!

I had some apples left over from visiting the orchard that were getting soft. I made this recipe and the whole family loved it. I think its going to become an annual tradition at my house. It was the best when it was still warm.

Great recipe and tastes great!  This was super easy and a great way to use up some apples that were on their last leg.  I only had 1 lb of apples so I just barely covered with water as the written part of the recipe states and add just a little under a 1/4C of sugar (I just added a few teaspoons of sugar to taste approx. 1/4C) and the juice of 1/2 of a lemon. I also added a couple of cinnamon sticks.  Will definitely make again.

I had six gala apples that needed to be used. Instead of water, I used 1/2 can Gingerale to cook apples (about 1/3/ way up in saucepan. I added 3 packets of Splenda, dash of cloves, 2 tsp. lemon juice, and about 2Tbsp. cinnamon (to taste).  I just mashed down and left chunky!  Delicious!!!

It was awesome.  Did not peel the apples, just put them in the Vita-Mix and it was great.  Did not use as much sugar as suggested, and rather put in sucanat sugar.  Loved it!!!

Super quick and easy, and so good! I used half the amount of sugar and substituted brown for white, as well as adding a bit of cinnamon. For those complaining of too much water, drain your apples before mashing them.

Turned out great!  As other viewers said though - cut down the amount of water!  I added less water but still had too much.  I also added cinnamon and nutmeg and used honey instead of sugar.  Great and easy recipe!

Basic recipe is good, however, this called for way too much water. I had juicey Melrose apples and only need a quarter of a cup of water. I also cut back on the sugar and added a goodly amount of cinnamon. Because my apples were so tender, I didn't need to run them thru the food processor. A simple mashing with a potato masher did the trick just fine. Great thing to do with all of those apples after a day of apple and pumpkin picking! Thanks Rachel!

I chopped up a few HUGE Fuji apples, with the skin left on, and threw it into a saucepan.  I used less water than the recipe specified, but it still turned out great.  I ran the apples through the blender to chop up the peels and it tasted great!  I didn't add any sugar as the apples were sweet enough.  Yummy and super healthy!

Homemade applesauce is SO good. It's great for using up apples that are going soft. Sometimes I skip the food mill and leave it chunky. Great warm!

Absolutely delicious!  This recipe has quickly become a family favorite.  I used a potato masher to make the sauce more chunky as another reviewer mentioned.  I also used Granny Smith apples so I thought the sugar amount was fine.  Sprinkle cinnamon once in the serving bowl and you have a simple yet impressive dish to compliment any meal!

This recipe was very easy. Although the recipe says run through food mill or blender, I whisked the apples while they were cooking, and the sauce turned out smooth. I found there was no need to drain the apples after cooking, because they thickened naturally. I will use this recipe again.
I only added about 4 TBSP. of sugar.

Followed the instructions exactly.  It came out perfect.  We did have some green-ish apples from our tree, so maybe really ripe apples would need less sugar.  I also hate cinnamon, so no additions were needed to this recipe.  PERFECT!

This is a great recipe!  My son loves it!  He's such a selective eater, too!  I would cut back on the sugar and water next time, though.

I skipped out on the sugar altogether because I felt the apples would be sweet enough.  I did modify, but this is a great base recipe otherwise.

made this today, it was so good and easy to make Like other reviewers I didn't use the full cup of sugar I used 3/4 and added a sprinkle of cinnamon. My kids could not eat it fast enough. I just used a potato masher to break up the apples to the texture I was looking for.

I buy 6 bushels of apples in the fall and freeze applesauce to last all year.  It is much easier to just quarter the apples and cook them with the peels on, then run it thru the food mill.  Saves alot of time.

Instead of sugar and cinnamon I use the little red cinnamon heart candies that I buy around Valentines Day. Stir in to taste and you will have a beautiful pink coloured apple sauce that has cinnamon as well. Looks and tastes great.

I did everything the same except that I didn't peel the apples since I like the pinkish color for homemade applesauce. :) It was pretty good, but it wasn't gobbled up right away. Easy to make!

When making this be sure to follow the other reviewers addvice and watch the amount of water that you choose to add. I didn't add any sugar despite the fact that I used Granny Smith apples as I like my applesauce very tart. A great recipe - I won't go back to store bought.

Didn`t add the lemon juice, and added a little cinnamon and nutmeg. Not sure how much sugar I used... I just sorta added until I was happy. My Japanese friends, teachers, and students all loved this. They`ve NEVER had applesauce before. My Canadian friend also thought it was really good.

I used half the amount of recommended sugar, and it was still really sweet.  But it was great otherwise.  When I make it again, I will use less sugar.  And since this was my first applesauce attempt, I appreciated the tip from a previous review to drain the apples before blending!

This recipe was fabulous!!!!! I'll never buy the pre-made applesauce again. Instead of running the cooked apples through a blender, I mashed them in the pot using a potato masher. By doing this, little chunks of apple were left in the sauce. I also added a bit of cinnamon for a twist.

OMG, why have I been buying Applesauce.  I do admit that buying it is so much easier, but when I make it, I get to decide what goes in it.  I didn't follow the recipe entirely, in fact I omitted the sugar and the lemon juice.  It tasted just like the unsweetened sauce that I would buy at the store.  Now I know what to do with my apples when no one is interested in eating them!

my contribution to the Thanksgiving meal is homemade applesauce, I use a combination of Granny Smiths, Macintosh and Honey Crisps,tasting and adding any spices or sugars after cooking to taste.If making for a crowd don't forget to add a little lemon juice to the apple slices to keep from turning color

I found this recipe simple to understand and easy to follow. However, I used overripe Gala and Fuji apples, which are already very sweet and tart - which made it possible to make the applesauce without any sugar added! Also, some cinnamon would have made it a bit more palatable. But it did go well with my latkes!

I've made this several times and love how easy it is to end up with a GREAT taste!  We like a super-smooth appleasauce, so I use my immersion blender right in the pot.  Sugar can be adjusted according to taste/type of apples; can add cinnamon or red hots or as written: all are winners!

Very good! I did cut down to water to about 2 cups and still had to drain a little at the end and I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup. It was pretty sweet but very good.

The 1st lot I made I added some cinnamon & the 2nd lot I added fresh strawberry's. It was a huge hit with the kids. I got 4 8oz jam jars & then I gave them a boiling water bath to seal them, so I could put them into my food storage. I drained some of the water before I put it into the blender, I also added the 1/4 cup sugar & lemon juice while I was cooking the apples so I didn't recook them.

Not bad.  I had to blend the apples in a food processor after cooking to get correct consistency.  I did use a little cinnamon and will probably for go that next time, even a small sprinkle turned the apple sauce a brown color and gave it a bit of an over whelming cinnamon flavor.  My son loved it but my husband said it was too sweet, almost like a dessert.

Delicious!  My kids could not believe how wonderful this was.  I served it with Thanksgiving dinner.  It did not take the full three cups of water, just enough to barely cover the apples.  I also added cinnamon, which was very tasty.  Thank you  for sharing this!!  It will be made again!

This was SOOOOO good but I didn't use that much water.  I doubled the recipe and probably used 4 cups of water.  I also used 4 T. of brown sugar and 2 teas. vanilla, per another reviewer.  I also used a potato masher followed by my immersion blender to keep it chunky.  I wish I had made MORE!

Tasty and easy.  I halved the sugar and should have eliminated even a little more-very sweet.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I didn't add any sugar and I drained before blending the apples.  The sweetness and texture was perfect for the birthday pupcakes I was making for my fur baby, Bear.

No need for sugar. We cooked the apples with a cinnamon stick and three or four pieces of candied ginger. Then we added ~1/4 C of canned crushed pineapple and 2 Tbsp of lemon juice while blending with a stick blender. Delicious!

Also cut the sugar, added cinnamon, and used an apple corer. Did not chop apples further to boil. strained cooked apples of excess water.  Then I mixed in the sugar and lemon juice. Used a pastry blender to cut the pieces.

Turned out well. Will make again.

As others suggested, I reduced the Sugar. I used 3/4 Cup (next time I will use 1/2 Cup as it was still pretty sweet), I used Macintosh apples. I added 3 Tbsp Brown Sugar and approx. 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. This was soooo good, I served with breaded pork chops and everyone raved about the applesauce!

I would use less water next time as i drained quite a bit off. I am saving it to make beer bread with so will see how that turns out. I only used ½ cup sugar and it was a perfect amount. I also added one drop of therapeutic grade cinnamon oil to give it a little bit of cinnamon flavor. My daughter said "there's nothing better than  homemade applesauce" and that is the reason I gave it 5 stars!

I made this in my slow cooker, reduced the water to 1/2 cup but otherwise followed the recipe.  I didn't spend too much time chopping the apples.  I cut them in chunks and mashed them with my potato masher once they were soft.  This applesause has a very fresh, clean apple taste.  Although I love spices, this recipe is perfect as is.  I will make this again.

I loved this recipe and so did my 3 year old. Before it even cooled, she asked for 2 servings of it. She is my best critic!  What I did was use approx. 2.5 to 3lbs of apples, some were Macintosh and few were Red Delicious. I also included the only pear that I had.  I followed the directions and placed them iin the blender.  I did peel 4 peaches, freshly picked and added those to the mixture in blender. I added 4 tbls of sugar a dash of cinnamon and I grated fresh nutmeg to my taste!  It is absolutely yummy!  I will make this again next time with 1.5 lbs of pears and 1.5 lbs of apples!  Can't wait!

I only put in 3/4 of a cup of sugar and it was still too sweet.
