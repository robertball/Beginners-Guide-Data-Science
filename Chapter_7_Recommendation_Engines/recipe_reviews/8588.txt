I found this recipe useful although I made several changes to it that the rest of you may like to try. 

Someone gave me a bottle of ready-made spicy mango sauce. And following the steps to brown the chicken etc, I did just that. Later, scoop the chicken up and do the sauce. I added the orange juice 3/4 cups only instead of 3 cups. Then added the spicy mango sauce. Add more salt to it so that the OJ won't be too overpowering or too sour/sweet. Next, put the chicken back in and stir in sliced carrots and red capsicum. It looks good and enhances the taste. 

Oh and before that, make sure the chicken is marinated with Worchestershire sauce, salt, pepper and dark soy sauce. Try again! :)

Unfortunately the taste of this dish is flat.  The OJ overruns the mango, so much so that the mango ends up tasting like OJ.  Maybe a mix of OJ and pineapple?  Don't know, but at the price of boneless chicken breasts, I don't think I'll experiment.  There are too many other excellent chicken mango dishes to rely on.

This recipe is digusting.  Do not waste your chicken on this one!  For some reason I think it does not taste good because of the orange juice.

I agree that using the 3 cups of orange juice creates a liquidy sauce and overpowers the mango. I boiled the sauce with corn starch for 3-4 minutes until it thickened. It is refreshing and fruity, though.

Didn't really like this dish.
You couldn't taste any mango flavor.
It tasted more like OJ chicken.

i used this recipe as an outline and then added only 1/2 a cup of orange juice pineapple juice and small pineapple chunks and finely chopped garlic, a weird combination but actually tasted very good...

With the exception of cutting up the mango, this was a really easy meal. I halved the recipe, but left the amount of mango intact - that seemed to solve the lack of mango flavor that others mentioned. I didn't want to overcook the chicken in the process of browning it, so erred on the side of not quite browned in favor of allowing the chicken to poach in the delightful orange-mango sauce. I found it delightfully fruity and light-tasting. No rice needed - just added some steamed veggies for an excellent summer meal!

I made but substituted green onion for the red onion.
Use olive oil instead of vegetable oil--must healthier and better flavor.  Omit the orange juice and cornstarch all together--lower the calories--improve the flavor.

It was ok. I wish i HAD used pre-cooked shredded chicken. Heated mangos diminiishes their unique flavor. I am going to try chicken -peach dishes. My husband who loves mangos asked me to not make it again

This recipe is good but needed a few revisions. I cooked the chicken and then removed it before adding the onions. It was much easier to stir this way. I took the advice of a few of the other reviews and only used 1 1/2 c. of orange juice/pineapple juice combination. Make sure you only use half of the cornstarch (use 1 tbsp + 1 tsp w/ the 1/4 c. hot water). After I added the cornstarch, I put the chicken back in, covered and simmered for a few minutes to let the chicken absorb the juices. I thought it was really good and I definitely got the mango flavor. Next time I will definitely try marinating the chicken in soy sauce first!

I added sherry wine and mushrooms.
This recipe turned out awful. I actually threw it in the garbage.
This is the only recipe that I have ever tossed.

I made the Mango Chicken tonight.  While it was ok, I think the OJ over powered the mango.  The next time I make it(and I will)
I will marinate the chicken in Mango juice. I love this site and your Magazine.

We used 5 chicken cutlets, and still found that even 3/4 cup of orange juice was too much. I highly suggest making the following small changes: marinate your chicken for a few hours with worcesterchire sauce, kikoman soy sauce, parsley, black pepper, and freshly chopped garlic. 

When you're at Step 2, only add 1/2 a cup of orange juice, and 1 and a half tbsps of cornstarch to the 1/4 cup of hot water. 

Add salt to taste as it simmers. it will definitely need it if the orange taste is still too overpowering! 

This recipe is still worthy, it just needed some alterations.

The chicken is very bland and needs to be mildly seasoned before browning, figured the OJ would overpower the mango so added 2 Cups of OJ & 1 Cup Apple juice. 
I also like the suggestion to add prepared spicy mango sauce to the recipe to enhance the flavour of the mango; or perhaps a mild mango sauce for the kids and those who can't tolerate spices.

I love chicken and I love mango... but I don't think I'll be making this recipe anytime soon.. it had way to much orange flavor.. I even cut the orange juice in half and only used 1 1/2 cups... not something I'll put together again...
