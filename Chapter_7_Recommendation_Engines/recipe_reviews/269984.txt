Taste very good. Need to cook on silicon or spray aluminum foil.  Couldn’t get off foil in 1 piece lost the crispy bottoms.

These were delicious. I made them last night and even thought I screwed up and bought maple sausage by mistake, which I hate. These came out great. I made some mini frittata’s along with these
