I didn't like this recipe at all but my boyfriend thought it was okay, but nothing special.  The recipe is easy to follow and was simple to make.  This had NO flavor.  Even after adding more cheese and salsa or hot sauce afterwards...it was bland.  This could be good if you were serving a bunch of people and you don't have a clue about their tastes.

I made a few modifications. Instead of sausage, I used bacon. I added a fire-roasted jalape√±o and Anahein chile to the veggie layer. And I had only the potatoes and cheese on top, kept the bacon and veggies in two internal layers (so it went: 1/3 of potatoes, 1/2 of bacon, 1/2 of veggies, 1/3 of cheese, 1/3 of potatoes, 1/2 of bacon, 1/2 of veggies, 1/3 of cheese, q/3 of potatoes, 1/3 of cheese). It had a pretty good flavor and it certainly was convenient. Leftovers tomorrow!

I made this last night for potluck at work. I made with hot italian sausage which was very good. If I make again I would use a few more eggs and more cheese.  Took a little longer than 8 hours to cook all the way.

Easy to make for a brunch or potluck. My family liked it. It did take closer to the 9 hour mark to cook. I served it with salsa and sour cream.

This was excellent. Not sure why it has gotten low ratings. I cooked it in my Ninja slow cooker and it was done before 8 hours. It actually was done within 7 because the top was really brown, but everbody loved it. I am making it again tomorrow with chorizo.

I thought this was very easy to make. I brought it to a baby shower. The leftovers were very good too. It is very good with hot sauce, salsa or green chile. I cheated and used frozen potatoes, onions and green pepper blend. I also used turkey sausage crumbles. I am also a fan of garlic salt and would probably use a little more seasoning next time. I will make it again and might add a few more eggs and/or cheese.

Worked better with bacon than sausage I thought.  I may try it with linguica soon though.

Definitely needs some modifications. It was ok the first time I made it, but the second time I substituted spicy chorizo for the regular sausage. And added extra cheese. Also needs a lot of seasoning. I added chipotle Chiles, regular chili powder, and ground ancho chili powder. And top with salsa

Disliked the texture of everything and was tasteless, despite making modifications from other reviews. Would not make it again.

I have made this receipe with a few modifications for Christmas morning, for a few years now.  Instead of two packages of sausage, I use one sausage and one bacon, it just gives it a better taste, after all what isn't better with bacon?  I have used shredded and cubed potatoes, both work well, although I prefer the cubed.  I have used all different types of cheeses as well.  Will make it again.

I and my family love this recipe. I've made it about 4x now and it is great to have on Thanksgiving and Christmas mornings. I just made it for my coworkers and they all want the recipe. I do nothing different.. follow the ingredients and you can't go wrong.

Easy enough to make, I used turkey sausage to reduce the fat content. A dish you will want to use salsa with.

We were in a hurry, so we did this in a glass baking dish at 375 in a convection oven for 25 minutes.  The edges got nice and golden and crispy and the center was perfectly done.  I prefer to use fresh shredded potatoes so there are no additives.  We seasoned each layer with steak seasoning, and we used extra sharp white cheddar.  I also made a dairy-free version, simply using almond milk and leaving out the cheese.  It was delicious.

I will make this again. I will probably add a little more seasoning of some sort and a bit more cheese. Great recipe for a large group. Easy to make and easy to clean up. Ready for the morning when you wake up.  Serve with some fresh fruit and maybe some toast, a bagel, or English muffin.

My husband is an extremely picky eater, and he LOVED this dish! He told me I could even make this every day if I wanted to. lol  This dish reheats really well also! Add a little Salsa right before you eat it, and it's perfect! Enjoy!

It was good, but bland like many reviews. You can always add seasoning at the table, if you over season it, you can never remove it.
It cooked well, and had a good texture.
I think next time I will add bacon or perhaps hot Italian sausage, it all depends on what the leftovers look like I guess.
