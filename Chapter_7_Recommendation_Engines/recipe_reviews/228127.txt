This is a solid recipe - however I would recommend toasting the bread under the broiler flip and top then back to the broiler for just long enough for the cheese to start to melt.  I think I prefer to dice up the tomatoes with the basil and some olive oil.  It is easier to eat without a knife and fork.  Thanks for a tasty recipe.  BTW - I served this with a balsamic glaze.

This was delicious. I served it at my holiday party and everyone couldn't get enough. We really like the crunchiness of the bread.

This recipe is really easy and really good. I originally made this to bring to a friend's party, but once I tried it I ate the whole plate in one sitting! Making again soon. The only 'change' I made if you can call it that was to drizzle balsamic glaze over it when it was done. I like that with caprese salad but not a must by any means. Great recipe!

I have made this recipe a few times now and always get rave reviews.  Like another reviewer, I broil the bread to crisp it up on the back side, then just put the prepared rounds with the tomato and cheese in the broiler until the cheese melts and the edges of the bread turn brown, about 5 minutes.  Then I top with chopped fresh basil and some balsamic reduction.  They are a bit of work, but always a hit!

Delicious fun lunch.  Hubby was surprised and delighted.  Easy to prepare and serve to make an impressive presentaion.  I scooped out the baguette soi could lay tomotoes in the "trench".  Saved a few calories!

This is a perfect use of the fresh tomatoes and basil in your garden.  I slightly toasted the baguette before adding the ingredients.  I also drizzled a little balsamic vinegar when finished for a fabulous lunch.
