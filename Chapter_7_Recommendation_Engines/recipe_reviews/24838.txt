Four stars rather than five for the simple reason that since lobster is a delicate, sumptuous (and expensive!) meat, I can't see adding strong white onion to it. I left it out, but chose to add some chopped green onion instead - just enough for a hint of its flavor and color contribution. Otherwise, this is an excellent salad, simple with just a few ingredients and unadulterated with distracting seasonings. The yellow pepper and celery are mild flavors, so they add color and texture without being imposing. Because I used lobster tails I did not shred the meat as directed, preferring to leave the lobster in nice, meaty chunks. That too, contributed great color and made the salad especially pretty. I served this on a bed of mixed lettuces alongside a scoop each of egg salad and cottage cheese, and a few sliced tomatoes. That and a bowl of creamy tomato basil soup made for the perfect, decadent, light summer meal.

I love lobster salad and this is delicious.  The only thing I did differently was omit the onions because my daughter doesn't like them.  Yummy-thankyou!

I subed scallion for the onion and added both red and yellow bell peppers. This made a delicious salad. That said, about half way through making the salad I decided to serve it on rolls. So I added fresh basil and parsley, a little lemon juice and a (big) splash of hot sauce. Not a true lobster roll but still good.  I rated the salad 5 stars as it was delicious before my additions.

I had some left over Lobster from last night's dinner and made this at work!!! I used Scallions instead of onions, didn't have celery, it was still delicious, I used less Mayo and added hot sauce to the Mayo before mixing it and it was perfect, crusty bread and Yum. Wish could have had the Chardonnay suggested!

I am from New England and love lobster salad. This recipe was so, so. Of course it is delicious just due to the lobster. You absolutely need to add a squirt of lemon juice to it. I agree with another reviewer who commented on the onion being too strong. I made this recipe as written and added less onion than called for and it was still too prominent and competed with the delicate taste of the lobster. Leave the onions out or use the green ones.

I only had 2 cups of lobster so I significantly reduced the other ingredients especially the mayonaise and it was very good but could of used a little more spice.   I took the suggestion of omitting the onion and replaced it with a few shallots. Next time I will try adding some more spices like tabasco sauce or a pinch of cayenne pepper.

I don't like to deviate from a recipe, but if something doesn't appeal to you, why add it? I'm from New England, and I like lobster. The yellow pepper here didn't appeal to me, so I left it out. I notice that others replaced the white onion with green scallions, for a less strong flavor, and I did that, as well. I also added a little splash of lemon juice for some freshness. This came out great, and I would make again with the small changes.

Dynamite.  I  took some of the suggestions and added a bit of lemon juice.  It brought out the flavors very well.   I also substituted red bell pepper for yellow.  It was what I had on hand.  The red pepper added some color.

Great recipe but it needed a little something.  I read that a previous review used Tabasco sauce.  I am going to try that next time.

I love this recipe! So simple and so tasty. I added a bit of fresh basil for hint of its flavor, yummy!
Make sure to use a hearty roll, butter and grill it.
