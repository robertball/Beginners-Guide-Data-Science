1.14.18  I ate a lot of this as a kid growing up in the Midwest and still enjoy it today.  Didn’t measure, just eyeballed everything, but cut back on the butter which is something I’ve never included before.  Our family always added corn, so I did throw in a handful of frozen Birdseye® Baby Gold & White Corn.  Also, since ham is loaded with sodium, I didn't add any salt, but did season with  pepper toward the end of cooking.   For me, this is just good, old-fashioned comfort food, and I always serve it with cornbread and a garnish of freshly-chopped onions.

Made it exactly as written and it was quite bland. If I had to do it again I would do something to add flavor like garlic and herbs and use a thickening agent to make a gravy . It was just potatoes, meat and vegetables in a watery sauce.  Nothing special.

This was an easy recipe - on the table in less than an hour with prep and cooking.  Definitely a comfort food recipe - no salt added or needed
