Loved it.  I took previously reviews and added blueberries and made muffins.  Very tasty and moist.

I’m not one to complain but this recipe is bland...it had very little taste..couldn’t taste the maple in it at all...loved the density of the bread and it was very moist but it was lacking in taste..I had all of the ingredients except cinnamon..but I had allspice and used it but it just didn’t have any flavor..going back to my old recipe!

We were running really low on sugar AND brown sugar, but I had overripe bananas that needed to be used, so this recipe sounded perfect. I thought the sweetness of the bananas and the maple syrup would be enough for the bread, but I should have doubled it to 2/3 cup to make up for the lack of sugar. I couldn't taste the maple at all, which was disappointing. It was still pretty good, although it got a little overdone. I checked it at 40 minutes and it was still very gooey in the middle, so I let it bake another 10 minutes. It looks borderline burned on the bottom and sides, but at least it doesn't taste burnt! Still, it could have used a few less minutes, maybe 45-47 total. I'll make it again with the proper amount of sugar and maybe just lower the temp a little. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is the lack of mapley flavor.

The first loaf smelled so good cooking, and I still had 3 more bananas, so a second loaf went into the oven! The second loaf i used 3/4 cup blueberries instead of nuts; it's delightful, too. I didn't have any oil, so I used melted butter instead. I always at least double the cinnamon in any recipe. I doubled the nutmeg, too, though that may have been too much. It is the perfect sweetness.  Love the texture and moistness.  I will definitely make this again.

This was really good.  I made it healthier by subbing 1/2 cup whole wheat for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour.  I also substituted homemade applesauce for all but about 1/8 cup of the oil.  I added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg because I like it spicier.  I only added walnuts to half because my kids don't like nuts.  It was very good and moist.

This is a tasty banana bread but no one tasted the maple.  Also, against my better judgement I followed the recipe and only sprayed the pan, so my bread stuck to the bottom (and I liberally sprayed it to the point of a puddle on the bottom).  Next time I will grease and lightly flour the pan, as well as kick up the maple syrup.

Not impressed with this recipe. There’s nothing particularly bad about it, I’m just not fond of the flavour & will stick to a more traditional banana bread going forward which I know & love.

This was very easy to make and quite delicious. I like a bit more banana flavor so next time I will add another banana.

I absolutely loved this recipe. Just the perfect amount of sweetness. I increased the spices a little bit since I like it and it turned out to be great. The walnuts added a nice flavour and crunch to this bread.

Was better the next day after refrigerating, but preferred my old old standby banana bed recipe.

Very tasty bread, great recipe,my hubby loved it too. Very moist and I love the maple flavor with the bananas. The only change I made was to save calories, so I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil.

I made these without changing a thing. Moist and flavourful. I made 12 muffins. Same oven temp but for 25 mins. Definitely a keeper.
