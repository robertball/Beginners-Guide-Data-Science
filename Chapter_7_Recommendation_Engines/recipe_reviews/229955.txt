I've been making my roast like this for quite some time. I like to coat the roast with flour along with the salt and pepper before searing. I then remove the roast and cook the onion and carrots for a minute or two to get them slightly browned. I didn't use the garlic. Tossed in some fresh thyme along with the rosemary - the fresh herbs make all the difference. I like to thicken the pan juices into a gravy to serve over the potatoes.

Excellent!! I did take the advice of one reviewer and coated the meat with flour, salt and pepper before browning and then removed and browned the onions, carrots and garlic. I made the rest of the recipe as is and it was fantastic! Will def make this again.

Used garlic salt, additional garlic and left out the rosemary.  This is a new family favorite!

Delicious!  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried.  Also added a green pepper to the pot that I needed to use before it spoiled.   I didn't add water because my roast was only 2 pounds, but it was flavorful and aromatic! This pot roast was so tender it fell apart when I tried to lift it out of the pot.  This quickly became a family favorite!

Turned out delicious! Would wait to add carrots and potatoes though, as they became a bit too mushy.

Instead of the water, I used 1 cup of red wine.  "Oh my, SO delicious"! Also, (optional hint) I added mushrooms.
