I am the submitter of this recipe. 1.) Make sure to use real cheese, as the powdered stuff in the green can has a lot more sodium, and will cause the dip to be salty! 2.)If you don't like spicy, or if a lot of kids will be eating this, I would use about 2 oz. of jalapenos. If you like a little kick but not overpoweringly spicy, 4 oz is the way to go. If you can't get enough of the heat and like almost-inedibly spicy, you can try 6 oz. 3.) The best thing I have found to dip in this is sliced french or sourdough baguette. 4.)Also, if you want to use fresh jalapenos, it gives a wonderful texture. Enjoy!!!

Three stars as is but five stars with some easy changes. Having made this recipe several times before, I recommend the following changes/ additions: Substitutie 1 ( 8 oz) package of soft cream cheese, and 1/4 cup of sour cream to replace mayo (mayo is too sweet and sour cream adds a needed tang), bake this in a greased casserole dish instead of a bread bowl and then serve with toasted french baguettes (dough wont get soggy then and dip forms a golden brown layer on top).  Divide the parmasen cheese into two half cups.  Incorporate one 1/2 cup with the cream cheese mixture and save the other 1/2 cup for a topping (also my addition).  Mix 1/4 tsp garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste into cream cheese and sour cream mixture.  For the topping, combine 3/4 cup Italian bread crumbs, the 2nd 1/2 cup of parmesan, 4 TBS melted butter and salt and pepper to taste. Once you have transferred the dip to the baking dish, spread the bread crumb mixture evenly over the top. Bake uncovered in a 350 oven for 30 minutes (or until the top is bubbly and golden brown).  Serve with toasted baguettes.  I would highly recommend doubling this recipe for a crowd.  I always run out even after doubling and literally have people licking the bowl.  SO GOOD! Thanks!

Woo-eee! Girl, this dip is MONEY! Picked up most of the ingredients for this in the a.m., including a bread bowl which had been marked down. I used Cracker Barrel's 2% sharp white cheddar and reduced fat mayo. Man. My husband and I were fighting over the leftovers. I'm already thinking of when would be a good time to make this again! This one is a definite keeper fo-sho'.

We really enjoyed this one. Instead of a full cup of mayo I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo. Also, I used 5 small jalapenos from my garden for a really fresh taste. Just popped in the oven in a baking dish (did not use a bread bowl) until bubbly and served with a french baguette. Delish... I'll make this next time I have company, if they like spicy.

So easy and great tasting! I made a double batch for my last party and happened to have some left over. The next day, we split some chicken breasts, stuffed them with the dip, then baked the stuffed chicken until it was done. You could also flatten boneless chicken breasts, spread with the dip, then roll, hold in place with a pick, cover and bake. Mmmm!!

Insanely amazing is right! Wow! So good! I usually can't handle much heat, but this tasted so good, I didn't care. I couldn't find a round loaf of sourdough, so I used a crusty Italian instead. I served this to a group of men during their fantasty football draft and it was devoured. Thanks Happywife, I will be making this very often during football season! :)

I made this recipe early in the day to take to a get together.  I ran out of time and didn't get to pick up the bread bowl so I microwaved the ingredients at my destination and served hot in my mini fondou pot along side of sliced sourdough baquettes.  Everyone thought it was excellent, I even got some "I like this better than that other one your bring" comments.

I didn't use a bread bowl, just make sure to drain the liquid from peppers if not using a bread bowl. I used asiago cheese instead of parm more flavor and medium cheddar, next time I'll use 1 cup of chedddar. I also added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. Very good! I'll make this often, thanks Happywife!!! ♥

Made as written. DH and son ate quite a bit. Nicely spicy with 4 oz. jalepenos. Pretty oily (mayo) so will try with 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream next time.

This is so good! Everyone at the party loved it. I am making it again this weekend and I am wondering if it would work to put it in a crockpot.

Delicious!  Very easy to make.  Made it on the weekend and it was a hit!  The only thing I did differently was, I had some 3 cheese blend already, so I put that instead of the cheddar, but it had cheddar and monteray jack.  Also I sliced fresh jalapeno rings and put them on top of the mixture before I put it in the oven.  Only do that if you really like it spicy!  I will definitely make this again.

We thought this was pretty good but not great.  I am going to try again with fresh jalapenos, roasted green chilis and replace the Parmesan with a four cheese mixture from my deli hoping to add more depth to the taste.  For us, sourdough bread is definitely the best for dipping.

This dip has been a hit at every family get-together we've taken it to!  The fresh jalapenos add a lot of flavor, but the heat is mild enough for everyone to enjoy.  Bring this as a dish to your next pot-luck or get together and it is sure to be the most popular snack or appetizer on the menu!

I did not like this at all, I followed the recipe exactly and even read the submitters review saying to buy the expensive parmesan which I did.  I ended up just tossing it out.  I think it was the taste of the mayo, I just did not like it.  Sorry!!

I had a little extra sour cream on hand so I added it into this dip, otherwise I followed the directions exactly. I really, really enjoyed this dip and will make it many times again. I loved the kick of the jalapenos, and felt the Parmesan added a nice taste. Thank you happywife! It was delicious!

This was VERY good.  I baked it in a dish instead of the bread, that way we had more bread for dipping.

This was FABULOUS!  I took it to a dinner party tonight and LITERALLY everyone there commented MULTIPLE times how much they enjoyed this dip!  I live in rural PA and therefor couldn't find a bread bowl on a Wed afternoon, so I had to make due w/hollowed out Italian bread...AWESOME!  Like other reviewers, my fav part was the crusty bread at the bottom of the dip (but it's ALL good!).  THANKS, HW, for a keeper!!  Oh yeah, I used fresh jalaps and a hungarian wax pepper and will, in the future, leave a little seeds/membranes for heat when it's just for us!

Stupid me.  This is my fault.  I should have read the sodium content ahead of time.  1,137 is just way over the hill for us.  I made it based on other reviews and used half mayo and half sour.

It was good but not "insanely amazing" - but I'm rounding up to 4 stars 1) because hubby liked it and 2) I used low fat mayo and I think using the real deal would have been much better, so not the recipe's fault but my own :) I did go 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and agree if you go all mayo your dip will probably be on the oily side.

On my 3rd revision of this recipe now.  So far I've ditched baking it in the bread bowl in favor of a shallow casserole dish then transferring to a browned sourdough bowl.  Also since I have no taste buds left I have upped the pepper count to 6 roasted, peeled & chopped jalapeños, 2 fresh chopped jalapeños & 2 roasted, peeled & chopped Poblano peppers along with 2-3 cloves minced garlic, 1/4 cup grated yellow onion (patted dry between paper towells) & 1/4 cup chopped green onions.  For the truly ambitious, substitute 1-2 Habanero peppers.  I also substitute 1/2 cup sour cream OR Greek yogurt for the mayo, nix the Parmesan cheese in favor of a 1/2 cup jack & "almost" a full 8oz. log of softened cream cheese & then add about a 1/4 cup of panko crumbs to to mixture to offset the additional moisture from the fresh peppers & onions & just bind everything together.  I also find that panko crumbs, a few tablespoons of Durkee fried onions, dry jack cheese ( & yes, some cayenne pepper)  quickly toasted with butter makes a really tasty topping.

The cheese didn't melt well together, the greese from the cheese and mayo rose up so that it looks like nothing but melted butter.  We tried with both bread and chips and after only a few, we decided it wasn't what we were after.  I am really sorry.  It sounded wonderful, but I won't make again.

Finally I made a baked dip in a bread bowl!  How lucky I am that it was happywife's!  It is SOOO good! The only thing I did different was to add the whole 7 oz can of diced green chilies I had.  The first few bites are hot, but after that it goes down easy!  I can't wait to share this with my friends/family!  Loved it!  Happywife, thanks!

This is yummy! I added a layer of panko bread crumbs on top to give it crunchiness like a jalapeno popper. I also garnished with a sliced fresh jalapeno. Served with sliced French bread.

My family devoured this at Thanksgiving!  We only used about 1/4 of a can of jalapenos due to taste preference, but mixed it up the night before, so the flavors really blended.  Very important to use SHREDDED parmesan and not the powdered stuff.  Will definitely make again.

Very spicy.....might be better with cream cheese instead of mayo.
Mayo gets a bit runny & oily .

Wow!  I used 1/2 canned jalapenos and 1/2 fresh jalapenos.  I think the fresh crisp really added to the already amazing taste!

Love it! I have had many requests for this recipe! FYI: If you make this a day ahead the "heat" level doubles (at least)!

I took a recipe that could've been extremely simple to make and made it a tad more time-consuming... I bought fresh jalapenos and roasted them in the oven... removed the skins and membranes, then diced them up... I haven't a clue if it made a difference in the recipe, but this was sure a fun and delicious dip that went over well! Will keep on hand for future parties! Also, I was using a 3-in-1 buffet crockpot to hold a few things so I just baked this in a casserole dish and then transferred it in the crockpot to hold warm. Worked perfectly!

I really liked this, as did my company. I went for a few less peppers since I like the flavor or a pepper, not just the heat.

Excellent flavor. Nice combination with the bread bowl. My guests loved it and wanted the recipe. It is a nice appetizer when you are tired of the same old ones that have been around for years.

My fiance loves this! The only thing I did different than the original recipe was as suggested by others and do 1/2 sour cream and half mayo. Delish!

I didn't make this in a bread bowl because my store didn't have any.  I followed the recipe exactly other than that and it was a big hit!  Next time I will get the bread bowl I hope, and make it as it was intended.  Thanks HW!

Made for a tailgate party and the recipe was for by several people.  I baked in a casserole dish until it was bubbly and slightly browned on top.  Used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream. Also added a minced fresh clove of garlic to the dip.  I took fresh sliced sourdough bread and lightly brushed melted butter with a little fresh minced garlic.  Cut into bite size pieces and put on a cookie sheet and baked until lightly toasted.  A keeper!  Will double the recip next time.  BTW...as another reviewer mentioned, do not use the canned parmesan cheese.  Either grate yourself or get in a bag in the dairy department of your grocery.

Made this for a party - the first one to take a taste never left the table, just kept eating it.  Pretty soon there was a line waiting to try this amazing dip.  I actually served this in a hollowed out round loaf of bread.  Looked very attractive.  Happy Wife, more recipes like this and I am a guaranteed hostess of the year!

If I were ever on death row with one last meal request, it would be this dip. They wouldn't even have to administer my punishment, I could just eat myself to death. 
I use the biggest round sourdough loaf I can find, hollowed out with the dip in it, and throw the cubed-up sourdough in the oven with the dip/loaf for about 15 min. Deeelicious.

Great recipe.  I didn't use the bread bowl.  Just put in the oven until hot and bubbly.  First I topped it with 1 cup of crushed crackers mixed with 4 oz. of melted butter and 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  Served with crackers.  Everyone loved it.

When I made this for the first time it was because I had fresh jalapeños to use up! Took some cues from other reviewers & replaced the mayo with soft cream cheese & greek yogurt. Baked in a 350F oven with some extra parmesan on top, then decorated with a few jalapeño rounds & served with thin sliced baguette. Got rave reviews. A definite keeper!

I made this as written, and used real Parmesan as per the submitter's recommendation. While the flavor was fantastic (spicy and savory), it came out extremely oily.  If I make it again, I'll have to do some tweaking to cut down on the oiliness.

Made this for my family a week ago.  AMAZING!  We scarfed it up.  I am making this for a family get together tomorrow.  I will double the batch because I know this will be the main attraction prior to dinner.  It is SO easy to make and SO yummy.  Thank you happywife05 for this recipe.  It will become a staple at my house!!!!!

I made this recipe for a gathering and most people seemed to like it. I made it as directed except I used 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c mayo since mayo kind of grosses me out to begin with. I thought it was really good with the sour cream. And I think I used some kind of Romano blend instead of parmesan, from the local Italian grocery store.

Made this yesterday for girls night out.  This is very hot, sipcy and addictive.  Do not use the powdered parmesan cheese (like I did) because it gives it a "sandy" texture.  Use the shredded parmesan cheese.  The bread bowl is a must to soak up the grease.  Everyone loved this recipe.  I have made this about 5 times and everyone "loves" it.

Followed this recipe exactly, but the dip came out very oily and with a very strange texture. It sounded great, but I won't be trying it again.

VERY good.  I used 6 oz of jarred-jalapeno and it was delicious but a little much.  Next time 4 oz for sure.  Plenty.  Also, I added a little extra cheddar---let it bake until it browns some.  Serve with bagette.  We ate it ALL.

I made this for a get together and EVERYONE LOVED IT!!! I mean when I tell you there was NOTHING left, they ate the WHOLE bread bowl!  Sourdough a must! I hollowed the bread out, sprayed some olive oil on top and added a pinch of parsley to the top! I also added a nice chunck of cream cheese and sour cream and half of the required mayo!  Fresh green chili and jalepenos a must next time- so I can get the REAL feel of the dip!!! Absolute best!! I make it just for the taste now... who needs a party?? LOL!!

This IS delicious.  I used a bit more of the cheddar cheese and mixed in diced fresh jalapenos to make a grilled cheese sandwich.

I made this for a party this weekend and it my new FAVORITE dip!  Can't say enough about this one!  I made it exactly like happywife05 except didn't bake it in the bread (seemed wasteful).  I just cooked it in a dish and served with tortilla chips!

I thought this dip was REALLY oily.  I had to dab the top with about 10 paper towel sheets.  The flavor was fine, but I will not make this again.  I am wondering if it should always be made in a bread loaf to soak up the extra oil.  I made mine in a glass dish and all of the oil rose to the top.  Not very appetizing.

Followed the recipe exactly..... This was fairly good,  but I am wondering if fresh jalapenos would have been better. I took this to 2 different Christmas gatherings, and while some of it was eaten, it wasn't raved over and I brought home some each night.  I might or might not try again - there was just no WOW factor in this one..

I thought was going to be such a winner but when I made it for a group, warming it in the oven then putting it in a chafing dish, it separated and had a thick layer of oil on top.  I used regular cheese (not the light kind) and followed the recipe faithfully.

This was great. I did have to bake longer as the parmesan wasn't melted yet. I also used Veganaise in place of mayo for some family members but I think it would be even better with the real deal. Also, the longer the dip sits the spicier it seems to get. That was fine for me but a little spicy for some guests. Another keeper!!!

So easy and absolutely delicious!!  I really couldn't stop eating this.  I served with sourdough bread slices and the hint of jalapeno chips and both were delicious.  I made a double batch and have been snacking all day on the leftovers, reheated in the microwave.

Made this for a potluck and it got RAVE reviews... and disappeared in less than 15 minutes. Huge hit. I followed the advice of some of the other reviews and did 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 mayo. Turned out well! And it's SUPER easy to make. Definitely a crowd pleaser! However, due to it's extreeeeemely unhealthy properties, I'll be saving this only for special occasions :)

I really liked this recipe! I only used half a can of jalapenos because I was afraid of the spice. It was still spicy, but oh soo good! I may just used the green chilies next time to keep it mild. I did bake it in the bread bowl, I think next time I make bake it in a small dish and then put it in the bread bowl as the bread bowl was too hard to eat. I liked others ideas about using baguettes too. My husband loved it and will probably be asking for it during football season! Thanks for sharing!

I have made it 3 times in less than a week...Everyone asks for the recipe and can't believe how easy it is. Didn't keep the bread bowl, baked it in a glass pan and worked out just fine.

I really like the flavor, but it seemed to take longer than 30 minutes for the cheeses to melt.  Next time I will try it with some garlic added.

This was awesome! I didn't use the mayo and instead used 1/4 cup sour cream and 1 8 oz package of cream cheese like some of the other users recommended. You can't go wrong! I highly recommend doubling the recipe if you plan to serve more than 5 people. I did NOT use the chilies and I used fresh jalapenos instead of canned. That way I could determine how spicy I wanted to make the dish. I think I ended up using about 3 small to med sized jalapenos and only used some of the seeds and some of the insides to get a medium type of heat. I chopped the pepper real fine. I also only used 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan (instead of 1 cup) and 1 cup of shredded mexican blended cheese (instead of 1/2 cup) (the kind that doesn't come with the seasoning on it). I mixed all together and placed in a dish instead of the bread bowl. I actually refrigerated overnight. When ready to bake & serve,  I layered some more cheese on top and sliced the last bit of jalapeno to garnish the top of the dish. I served with bagel chips you can find in the grocery store (usually by the bakery area) I also had tortilla chips on the side, but most used the bagel chips. I made it as a Christmas Day appetizer and everyone loved it! It was gone in no time and everyone asked for the recipe!! I plan to make for our new years eve guests!

I have never bothered to leave reviews on here, but I couldn't resist today. This dip was amazing! While I normally follow recipes to the letter, I chose to heed the advise of other reviews. I used half cup mayo and half cup sour cream because I wanted to avoid an oily dip as I was making for a family get together. I also love cream cheese so I snuck some in there along with some freshly diced jalapeno for added texture. Once I filled the bread bowl I topped it off with additional grated Parmesan cheese and panko bread crumbs to create a crispy topping (you'll love the crunch). The cheese mixture was enough to fill two 7" bread bowls. I served them with sliced French bread and my family loved it. They especially enjoyed slicing the bread bowl once the dip was gone to enjoy the toasted sourdough. A MUST TRY!

Fabulous!  I opted to sub the mayo with cream cheese and sour cream like one reviewer suggested.  Also, I had fresh jalepeno's, sweet banana peppers and habanero's so I sauteed them in butter with fresh garlic and finely chopped onion.  Oh My Gosh! I cooked it in a cassarole dish and served it hot with blue corn chips, amazing.  (I did drain the green chili's per reviewer suggestion).  So I'm writing down my version of this recipe and handing it out to all whom stood around the cheese dip at my party and ate it until it was GONE!!!

This is some seriously good dip!  I had to modify the recipe only because I needed to use what I had on hand.  I subbed mozzarella cheese for the parmesan and I completely left out the chopped green chiles.  My jalapenos were fire roasted.  This dip was really, really good and obviously versatile, as well!  Thanks so much for sharing happywife05!

So Great! So many compliments when I have made this.  I did sub 1/2 c sour cream and then just did 1/2 c mayo.  And, if you let it sit in the fridge for a day, it heats it up! So darn good! :)

Love this! Used fresh jalapenos and I made on the stove instead of baking (it's summer, who wants to use the oven?). Also, you can use whatever cheese combo sounds good and it will taste good!

it was pretty good, but i wouldn't say insanely amazing. i made it as the recipe stated, but used a sliced open baguette in a square dish instead of a bread bowl. i will make it again for gatherings.

This is awesome! I had a jar of sliced of jalapenos already so just threw what looked like enough in it. Used a mix of shredded parmesan and mozzarella with the cheddar. Couldn't find sourdough bread so just bought a cheese bread that was basically round. Took it to work and they went crazy! Thank you!

Definitely too spicy for many people, but I liked it. Eating with celery tones down the bite. I baked in corningware and served with a sourdough baguette, as well as celery. I would like it more creamy, and may add sour cream/ cream cheese next time.

LOVE this one! Make it quite often for gatherings! I use real parm. I use more cream cheese then mayo, i use fresh jalopenos and I bake it in a bread bowl. I also slice up a bread and toast it because that is what everyone seems to eat it with over the corn chips. This is a huge huge hit. EASY and I highly recommend. I even make it ahead of time and take it to parties and bake it there.

I made the dip half a day ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge -- made a couple of small changes due to necessity.  I switched the cheddar and parmesan amounts I baked it in in a layer that was only about an inch or an inch and a half thick, in a glass dish in the oven for 15 mins and voila.  A dip so tasty that my friends now think I can cook...

This is good! I used half mayo, half sour cream to cut down on the mayo "flavor". I couldn't find a sourdough loaf so I used a Hawaiian sweet bread loaf. I mixed everything together, heated it in a saucepan on the stovetop for just a few minutes to help it get warm and melty, then filled the loaf, wrapped it in foil, and left it in the oven for a good hour. It was nice and hot when it came out, and the foil kept the bread from burning. I really like the flavor the parmesan cheese gives it. I'll definitely make this again. That being said, this isn't as good as "Jalapeno Popper Spread", also found on this site. ;-)

I made this today to take to a gathering.  I don't love spicy things since my sweet tooth seems to conquer all, but I couldn't stop eating this.  I made as directed and it was perfect!  It was just the right amount of heat, not overpowering, very flavorful!  I will be making this another one of my go to appetizers.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Wow-wee what a treat for the tastebuds!  We loved this dip.   This made me a star at the play-off party.  The bread bowl works best. Almost didn't make this because one review said it was greasy.  When I analyzed the ingredients, I realized it sure would be. Can't figure out why a "healthy eater" would make this and say it was too greasy without realzing before hand that 1.5 cups of cheese mixed with 1 cup of mayo might just do that.  Vivia la rich food !  Try this dip!

I don't know what to say about this.  I think it would be better with fresh jalapenos because the pickled ones made the dip taste like pickles.  It didn't really come together and the cheese didn't melt well.  No amazing taste and it definitely needed more flavor.  As is it's not for us sorry.

I hate mayo but I love, love, love this dip!  Crazy I know.  Thought about substituting sour cream but did not due to all the positive reviews on this dip.   I did not even have a bread bowl just ate with tortilla chips. Also, I would always use real mayo not Miracle Whip.  To me there is a huge difference.

Holy cow, this dip is AWESOME!!!!!  Made it just as it says and it is perfect.  I have taken this to four Christmas parties now and at every single party, everyone wants the recipe!  And I must say, after everyone eats the dip, the bread with the warm baked-in dip is outstanding!!!

I tripled this recipe for a potluck at work and also used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream. I then put the cold mixture in my slow cooker and turned it on in the morning for lunchtime. It was insanely good. Excellent recipe!

This recipe was just "okay".  It just tasted like cheese... even though there was some spice from the chilies, there was no "wow" factor to this recipe.  Also, the bread boule got very hard when I baked it, which was disappointing because nobody could eat it.   Maybe a solution would be to bake the dip before filling the boules.

A huge hit at a party!  Instead of baking it in the bread, I put it in a small casserole.  When I tasted it, it needed a little zing- so I added a few sprinkes of tabasco.  Very Yummy!

Yummy!!!  It was very good and could easily be prepared minus the bread.  Everyone who eats spicy at my house loved it.  As far as being oily - it wasn't until I reheated the leftovers.

I just love this dip.  The first time I made it, I made as written.  The second time I used half mayo- half sour cream.  Both were delicious.  I am making it this weekend and will throw in crab and chopped artichoke and maybe a tad of cream cheese...such a great recipe to play around with! UPDATE:  I did make with chopped artichokes and crab with a little softened cream cheese along with the sour-cream-mayo.  It was so good each and everytime! I've made it in the bread bowl and without. So very good.

I LOVE this dip!  I took it to a party and even people who weren't big on spicy or jalapenos loved it!  I made it exactly according to the recipe and it was gone within 15 minutes!  Next time I will double the recipe I think... thank you for this easy tasty recipe!!!

I made this for my sissy's bridal shower and of all the fancy dishes I made, people went nuts for this.  I did use fresh jalapenos instead of the canned and I added a can of artichoke hearts. So 5 stars and I will definitely make this again, and again!!

Really good and very easy.  It looks like it took a long time to make.  In my opinion, the best part is eating the bread bowl after the dip is gone.  The flavors soak into the bread and make it sooooooo very tasty.  It is very spicy, so if you don't like heat, it's probably not for you.  The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 was that it seemed to me like it was missing just a little something.  I think next time I might use mexican-blend cheese or maybe even a little taco seasoning, just to give it a bit more of a complex flavor...but all in all, it's really good as is!

Thank you Happywife!! This dip was the hit of the party. I pretty much followed the recipe but didn't have quite a cup of mayo so I added enough sour cream (per reviewers) to make a cup. I used fresh jalapenos because I had them but I think the canned ones probably would have added more heat. I baked this first in a casserole dish and did notice some grease on top but once I transferred to the bread bowl you didn't see it as the bread soaked it up. I think the cheeses more than the mayo cause the little bit of grease. The only thing I'd do differently next time would be to triple it!

It did not get very hot at 350 for 30 minutes. I wrapped it in foil at 450 for another 10 minutes and it was still luke warm. Finally , I heated it in the microwave for two minutes.  The flavor was not bad. It was not great. Maybe missing cream cheese?  Out of several dipping options, toasted bread is the best.

Insanely easy too. I mixed up the ingredients and kept it cold in a microwave bowl and took to a party. Then I just microwaved it when it was time for it with a spoon to spoon on sliced french baguettes So INSANE good for sure. And by the way, I even liked it cold.

Not a mayo fan.  Used sour cream and was good flavor.  Would be a lot easier without the bread bowl.  Took a lot longer than the recipes says to  heat in the oven.

This was a huge hit at the Library Volunteers Luncheon.
Everyone wants the recipe. I’m giving it four stars only because I made changes. Besides the cheddar, I found “smoky bacon cheddar” which I think added another flavor, and I used fresh as well as canned jalapeños. I also omitted the mayonnaise for the cream cheese and sour cream another reviewer suggested as well as adding a topping of Italian bread crumbs, melted butter and grated Parmesan. I also made the mixture the day before so it would have a more intense flavor.
Definitely will make again and again!

I really expected to love this dip based on other reviews but was somewhat disappointed.  Both my husband and I thought it lacked flavor.  I used all mayo, didn't find it too greasy.  Maybe if I had been more selective of the ingredients, it might have been better.  I did not place in a bread bowl simply because i already had all the ingredients on hand.  Easy dip to make for sure.  Worth trying again but will spend a little more money.

Took this to a football party and it was a huge hit. I used 1/2 c mayo and 1/2c sour cream, and threw some ricotta in for good measure. I baked it in a silicone baking dish and served it with sliced French bread.

I substituted 1 ( 8 oz) package of soft cream cheese, and 1/4 cup of sour cream to replace mayo. I baked this in a cake pan instead of a bread bowl and then served with toasted french baguettes. It was good but I would add more spice to it next time by adding freshly slice jalapeno in addition to the canned.

I took the advice of omitting the mayo and subbing 8 oz cream cheese and 1/4 C sour cream.  I also chopped 1 large jalapeno instead of using canned and added 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  For the topping, I omitted the butter and just used panko bread crumbs and grated parmesan.  Couldn't get enough of this dip.  I served it with sliced celery and baby carrots.  Chips are always good too.

I have made the original recipe in a crock pot pan which I then transferred onto the heating unit, with slices of sour dough bread on the side and also as reviewer "Princess daBurgh" suggested and both have turned out deliciously. When doubling this recipe I didn't double the chopped jalapenos and it was plenty spicy for me, though I'm not a very spicy gal!

This was a great dip according to my husband. I do not like hot foods, so it was not for me. I used fresh jalapenos out of the garden and followed the suggestions of some other cooks and used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup of sour cream. Will make again. Thanks for sharing!

I was surprised how much I liked this. My SIL gave me some fresh jalapeños, we needed a snack for company, and I had all ingredients on hand. After reading reviews, I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo; fresh jalapeños and fresh unknown pepper from hubby, and half loaf of leftover Italian bread. I sliced the loaf lengthwise, scooped out part of the center, poured the cheese on top, sprinkled on paprika for color, and baked 25 min. Worked best to just slice it.  Fantastic. Got rave reviews. I only used 2 jalapeños and it was not at all hot. Will use more next time. Thanks for this one!

Grateful for the recipe! Everyone always loves it. I usually double the recipe and 1/2 the mayo, add sour cream and cream cheese. I serve with crackers, fresh sliced bagettes or melba crackers. Easy to impress with this one.

This was OK.  I prefer making hot dips with cream cheese and sour cream in place of mayo for a more tasteful dish, but even with these changes, this dip just didn't have a lot of flavour.  I may try again and add spices.

I've made this several times exactly as written and it is awesome!  Don't need to change a thing.  I usually serve with nacho chips and sometimes the bagettes.

I'm giving this 5 stars for as good as it is, for as simple as it is - all premade ingredients, comes together in no time at all.  And it IS good!  I used 4-5 oz of jarred, pre-diced jalapeno with seeds, and it WAS spicy!  It reminds me of a deconstructed jalapeno popper.  I used half mayo, half sour cream just because that's what I had; worked well.  I served it in a tiny crockpot to keep it warm, which worked out well (can't say if it stays yummy as it cools).  I wasn't sure about the untoasted bread dippers, so I buttered and toasted half of the baguette slices, took it to a party with both options, and polled the audience -- split vote:  some preferred toasted, while others liked the plain bread.  So either way works!

Absolutely delicious, especially in the bread bowl. I also used lite mayo and fresh jalapenos and it was great! I also recommend eating it with a sliced baguette but tortilla chips work too. thanks!!

me & my boyfriend loved this dip.. as huge jalapeno popper fans we were excited to try it! i did add fresh jalapenos, which added a little zip. i also baked it with the shredded cheddar on top, then stirred it all together before serving.

Amazing!  I have made this recipe about 5 times and every time people asked me for the recipe, now my co-workers beg me to bring it to the potlucks.   I followed other reviewer’s advice and used ½ cup mayo, ½ cup sour cream and add a dash of garlic powder but follow the recipe other than that.   I don’t think it’s too spicy, no one has ever complained and it’s always the first thing gone.  I think it’s a must to cook in a bread bowl, looks very nice & doesn’t get greasy.

This was very easy to prepare and tasted great. The dip went well with bread. I didn't expect the bread bowl to come out rock hard though. Not sure if it is a result of my tiny toaster oven. I will make this dip again, and again for parties and for just me and the wife.

Really good recipe! We did add one real jalapeno instead of the canned version. My only issue was that I thought it would turn out more like queso, but instead it was like spinach dip without the spinach. White cheddar might be something I will try next time as well.

I made the dip without the bread bowl and heated it in the microwave. It was still amazing! I also added some sour cream to keep it from being too cheesy and a little cumin to taste.  Thanks for a great quick recipe.

What a great recipe! Not too hot but just enough kick to make you want to go back for more! You can also add a can of regular artichoke hearts...yummy. I served mine with tollhouse crackers and small slices of french baguette.

I really loved this dip, but I also love extremely spicy foods. I would suggest that if you don't like spicy foods, cut down on the chilies and peppers, and substitute with a milder pepper.

As per other reviewers' suggestions, I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream. I also baked in a glass pie pan rather than a bread bowl. I put it out for a few friends while I was preparing dinner and it was gone in 15 minutes. Very tasty. I used the exact amount of peppers and chilies, but the jalapenos were mild, not hot. The spice level was perfect.

Made this during the Christmas season for an appetizer gathering. Loved making it, loved testing it right out of the oven, loved displaying it, loved watching everyone gobble it down, loved feeling like a hero.  I did cut the mayo in half and did the other half sour cream but that’s really all I changed. Fantastic.

this is AWESOME. it's really really spicy, i think you could get away with using 2 oz of green chillies and 2 oz jalapenos vs. 4 oz..unless you really really like the heat...it was really good either way also very easy to prepare and the bread tastes so good with it!

What an amazing combination of flavours.  It was so good i even received calls from people who were Not at the party for the recipe!  Easy to make and great for a novice like myself.

Very good! I used just a little more than half the jalapeno's called for & it still had kick. I also used 1/2 mayo & 1/2 low-fat sour cream.

I do like spicy..but this was a too strong in the "kick" department. Perhaps it's because I mixed everything up ahead of time so the flavors developed more but I would scale down the jalepenos in the recipe. Next time I will probably add a creamier white cheese since the parmesan didn't do much to enhance the flavor. A little tweaking and I think it would be a hit.

For those who complain about it being greasy--the ingredients are mayo and cheese, what do you expect! It's not fair to penalize the recipe because you aren't reading the ingredient list! That being said, this was sooooo good. No leftovers! I baked it in a bowl and sopped it up with fresh bread. Absolutely the perfect football food!!!!!

I made this for our tree trimming and was quite disappointed not only in the texture, but the flavor.  The texture was very much like the mayo that you put in it.   I'm not sure what to subsitute, but the dip wasn't thick at all and was SO spicy that all you could taste were the jalapeno's.

I've been making this for the last few weeks and we LOVE it! It's like our new family favorite. I usually will cut into strips whatever kind of bread we have in the house and toast them for dipping. I also took the advice of some of the previous reviewers and substitute half the mayo for sour cream. It's excellent. Also, it's not necessary to have a whole cup of Parmesan... I run out of the shredded alot and I'll just supplement extra shredded cheddar for it. EXCELLENT!

I made this dip as written and give it 4 stars because it doesn't match it's title.  The dip was very good and had zero leftovers but the title gave me the picture of people huddling around the dipping barely being able to say, "Oh my god this stuff is insane!!" between bites.  That didn't happen ....  I think it needs a mixture of cream cheese and sour cream in place of the mayo.  Possibly a shot of Tabasco too.

This really was Insanely Amazing!  Made it this past weekend for a football party and it is a new favorite.  After reading reviews I used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream and then I put extra parm. cheese on the top before putting it in the oven.  I used fresh jalapenos (seeded and diced) and really liked the consistency.  It was not spicy, next time will add more jalapenos probably, but even those who don't like jalapenos really enjoyed it.  I couldn't find a bread bowl so put it in an 8x8 glass pan and it fit perfectly and was great after 30 min in the oven.  Served with triscuit thin crisps,  townhouse crackers, and celery and it was gone within 5 minutes. Next time I will make at least a double batch!

Very good, this tasted great with bread, served this with homemade jalapeno corn lava bread from another site. Added onion powder for more flavor. The recipe didn't call for the items to be drained, I drained them thinking that it will be too much liquid if I didn't.

This dip is absolutely delicious.  I didn't make it in the bread, because I only made half a recipe for myself to try.  It is quite greasy just baking it in a bowl, because I believe the bread would soak up some of the grease.  I also cut down on the jalapenos a bit because I don't like really spicy food, but next time I will definitely add more for a little more kick. I can't wait to make this in the bread bowl, because I know it will only be better.

Really, really, really good!  I did use half mayo and half sour cream and I used the light variety of each.  I baked it in a dish instead of a bread bowl but would love to try the bread bowl next time.  Delicious!!

Insanely delicious!! I didn't make in the bread bowl, just baked in a dish. I'm the only one that loves peppers so I halved the recipe. Bad decision. This is so yummy. I did use fresh jalapenos. Will make again for sure.

This is spicy but somehow people snarfed it up like there was no tomarrow.  I went a little heavy when I was measuring out the mayo and cheese just to stretch the recipe and cut the spiciness and it was turned out great.

I had a hard time finding a bread bowl and substituted French Bread. It tasted great, this is a very rich and satisfying dip. I added green onions on the top for some crunch. I found this recipe just in time for football season!

Had to heat it up in the microwave after being in the oven.  It was taking too long to heat up and the bread was getting hard but the micro worked great :)

If I could give this a 4.5 I would. I took this to a football party and it was a big hit. I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream, and only half the jalapeños. Couldn't find a bread loaf so I baked in a glass dish and served with French bread on the side. This dip is very easy and very good. Will definitely make again.

Very tasty and very spicy. I will probably make again. And maybe use fresh jalapeno :) I only gave 4 stars because of the heartburn! LOL

This was a big hit at our Labor Day party. Followed receipe exactly and used fresh, real parm cheese. Nothing was left! Really quick and easy to make!

Delicious!!  Even my mother, who doesn't like mayo and dairy products, loved this dip.  I only had the grated parm cheese in the green can on hand, and it tasted great!  I will try it with shredded parm next time, and maybe a little crushed garlic!

This dip is insanely amazing. I made it just as the recipe said and had no problems at all. Everyone at the party requested a copy. I will be making this again and again and again. Thank you for sharing happywife05.
