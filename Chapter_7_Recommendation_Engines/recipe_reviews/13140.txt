One of the best chicken soup recipes I have ever tasted.  I do this, buy a roasted chicken at the grocery store, (the ones they cook in a rotisserie)let it cool, remove all the skin and bones, then dice in big pieces, put in the stock pot with the ingredients, cook and serve.  Really a great flavor.

Two thumbs up!  My subs: I used one pkg of chicken (~1.5 lbs) - this seemed like plenty.  I did double up the ham to please my meat-loving fiance.  I also subbed a can of diced tomatoes for the fresh (though in retrospect I think the fresh would have been much better.)  Overall, I think this soup took almost 2 hours from pot to table.  Next time I'll increase the rice and use cilantro for the parsley.

Awesome Recipe!  We selected this receipe for an international dinner at our church.  EVERYONE loved it and many asked for a copy of the recipe.  We used bouillon cubes to enrich the broth and added a rib of celery (chopped).  It was delicious!!!  There were about 50 - 60 people at our dinner so that gives you 300 stars!!!!

This was a great chicken soup. I added 1/4 can of tomato sauce to give the soup a little more tomatoey flavor. It reminds me of a spanish stew my mother made when I was growing up. I may add a few potatoes next time. Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first try at making chicken soup, and it was delicious!  I only made some slight changes, I used a can of diced tomatoes(strained) instead of fresh, and added a little more rice and ham.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful !!  I used leftover chicken and leftover ham.  Did not have fresh tomatoes; so added some homemade canned stewed tomatoes from the garden.  We absolutely loved this and was easy to prepare for a busy day.  There are leftovers for tomorrow; soup always tastes better the next day.  Thanks for adding a new soup recipe for us, CORWYNN DARKHOLME!!  This a keeper and one that will be used many times.

Pretty good. I used a little under half a lb of diced pre cooked chicken which seemed like the perfect amount and used only a quarter of the onion. Yummy soup thanks.

This dish was amazing.  I followed the recipe quite closely, and it was great.  Even better the 2nd day with more of the ham flavour coming through. Highly recommended.

This Canja is delicious!!!  I have added the following items to add texture to the soup : celery, fresh spinach, and instead of rice I use Acini de Pepe pasta noodle ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acini_di_pepe ) which works great in soups and cooks in 5-10 minutes! Tonight I'm adding a little cilantro instead of parsley for a little flavor variation-  yummy!

very good BUT 3 pounds of chicken for just 6 servings is way toooooo much.  that is almost double a normal portion of meat; and this doesn't even include the ham.  I used about 1.5 pounds of chicken; when I added this recipe to DietPower using the revised amount of chicken the calories dropped by almost 200.  My other change was using cilantro instead of parsley--only because it was what I had.

I was skeptical of this recipe at first, but I tried it and was pleasantly surprised!  I halved everything because I was only cooking for two people and it was great!! Very delicious!  I will be making this again!

Turned out great but as a good Brazilian I rather stick to the original version which does not include ham and tomato! Sometimes fewer ingredients result in a better flavor!

Delicious, easy soup recipe.  It is pretty much a basic chicken soup recipe, but the flavor is awesome with the ham.  2 1/2 pounds of chicken is plenty.  It needs more rice - 1/2 cup is perfect.  I like to double the parsely to 2 T.

Lovely....but.  It's just chicken soup!  With a sexy name and the promise of Brazillian flavours, I was expecting something magical to happen with the chicken, rice, veg and ham.  But it just cooked up into a tasty  (but regular) chicken soup.

This chicken soup is great! It's a little different from the ordinary, which is just up my alley. I think the fresh parsley is what makes it taste so great. The fresh tomatoes are great, too, better than canned. I follow this recipe exactly, except I don't bother to make sure I have exactly 3 lbs. of chicken. A little less doesn't make any difference. It's just a matter of preference, really, as is the amount of ham. Just don't substitute or leave out the fresh parsley!

A nice simple soup recipe, I used mini pasta instead of rice and cilantro instead of parsley to make it more Brazilian.

This is one of the best soups ever. I did
add 1 can of petite tomato's instead of fresh and even my husband who refuses to
anything different tried it and really liked it. Can't say enough about how good it was.

Very Good!  I felt it was a little too salty (with very little added salt), but hubby thought it was ok. Definitely an interesting flavor with the ham - we'll probably make this again.
