I made this last week, and it was amazing. I just mixed everything into the pasta, so all the pasta was covered in the pesto. Instead of lemon peel, I just squeezed some lemon juice into the pesto mix and instead of onions, I just used some chives, sprinkled over the whole thing. It was absolutely amazing and tasty. I recommend this for everyone to try.

So good! I made this for lunch today it's awesome. Probably the best super simple recipe I've ever used. I used some dried pasta that I had in my cupboard and used lemon juice instead of peel since it's what I had on hand. I used precooked frozen shrimp and it turned out great. Great recipe for someone that is just learning how to cook and wants to easily impress someone. YUM!

I was kinda bummed about how little flavor this had. I fallowed the recipe exactly. After that didn't seem to work I added to it more pesto and lemon. After that was still to bland for my husband, I finally just added a jar white sauce to it. It was pretty good after that but was still lackig for us. Don't know if it was the pesto I had or if it just wasn't a good recipe for us. But I don't think I'll be trying it again anytime soon.

The only change I made to this recipe was cooking my own linguini rather than using the pre-cooked Buitoni linguini.  I thought the meal was very boring.  The only positive is that this meal is super easy.  I used medium peeled cooked shrimp from a bag and I think thats where the recipe goes wrong.  I would recommend that you cook and season your own shrimp. Some sort of lemon garlic mixture would be good.  Either way, I would not recommend this recipe as is.
