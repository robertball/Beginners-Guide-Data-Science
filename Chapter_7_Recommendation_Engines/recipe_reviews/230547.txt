I agree, surprisingly delicious!  If you love pickles, you will love this drink.  When I shared this with followers there was some negativity, but this is not that far off from the dirty martini.  Definitely garnish with a couple pickle slices.  :)  I used home canned pickle slices.  Will definitely have it again!  My motto:  Don't knock it til you've tried it.

i guess the key here is of course the dill pickle juice, i tried both ways with actual pickle juice from a nice home made preserve pickles and the one you just buy from your local liquor store, let me tell in my personal experience, the formal was awesome but the latter i couldn't drink it was really salty and just lacked the nice flavor, so i guess try it both ways then decide.

As I was saying. I followed the recipe to the T. I loved it as is. I have a few suggestions. 1. If you do not “love” (and I do mean “love”) pickle juice, do not make this drink. 2. Use a good quality vodka. It is a martini mind you.  Bottom shelf/Plastic bottle vodka and pickle juice will hurt. I used Ciroc. Next time, I will use Grey Goose. I think that would be perfect. 3. If you are a light weight when it comes to vodka, decrease the ratio of pickle juice to vodka. Instead of 1 to 4, try 1 to 2. Otherwise, enjoy!

As others have stated, the success of this depends on the pickle juice yo use. I've used Claussen whole pickles/juice  with the most success. Steer clear of any of the green colored pickle juices as they are just not right for this drink. 
I also make sure to put a couple of the pickle rounds in the bottom of the glass as well.

Move over dirty martini! 
I love a good, ice cold, dirty martini. I am also obsessed with bloody Mary's (extra pickle juice). So when I saw this I had to try it....and it's amazing.  Like another reviewer suggested, I used Claussen pickles and juice, which I think makes this delicious and not too salty. Measurements are perfect. Also, if you're not a huge fan of pickles, you probably shouldn't try it. Thank you for the recipe! I wish I would've thought of it! Cheers!

I made homemade pickles and loved the brine so much that I couldn't bear to throw it out. Happy to have found this way to use it! 

Rule of thumb: If you like the pickle juice you are using enough to drink it, you will likely enjoy this recipe.

Let me say that I love pickles. I drink the juice out of the jar. I will put pickles on everything. I was very curious about this Martini as I love a good extra dry and dirty martini. This was awful. I didn’t want to waste the vodka so I did drink it all but it was the worst martini ever and will never be made again. It’s an A effort on a new twist for a martini but def not a good combo.
