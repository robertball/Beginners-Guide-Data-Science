I was excited about this recipe too. I love gingerbread. I replaced the oil with pumpkin. I added 3/4 c. currants (because I needed to use them) and when I got to my zucchini (thawed and drained) there wasn't quite 2 1/2 cups so I filled in with grated carrot. I'll make this often! Thanks Sarah-May!

Could not wait to make this!  Only changes I made were to use applesauce instead of oil, and I turned down the oven heat to 350 once I put pans in (thought 425 way too high for baking.)  This makes a very moist and tasty bread, more of a spice bread than a gingerbread.  You do not even know there is zucchini in it after it finished baking.  I would make this again.

This was great! I used a tablespoon of vanilla and sour cream for the vanilla yogurt. Made me feel like it was the holidays.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, except that I used a Korean squash from my MIL's garden, and swapped 1 c. of whole wheat flour, with excellent results.  Very moist with great gingerbread flavor - everyone loved it.  I had never cooked Korean squash before and wasn't sure it would turn out, but you couldn't tell the difference.  I'll be making this one again!

Great recipe! I used buttercup squash from my garden in place of the zucchini and it was delicious! I also tried this bread with sour cream in place of the yogurt and added pure vanilla extract (I did not have vanilla yogurt on hand) and it was just as good. I omitted the cloves, I don't care for their overpowering taste. Great versatile recipe!

This a fantastic recipe! I only had a cup and a half of zucchini. I used a cup of fresh plums to make up for the rest. I also increased the ginger to 3 tsp. The bread came out moist and tangy (from the plums). OH MY GOD SOOOOOO GOOD! thank you so much Sarah- May!

Great recipe! My kitchen was rather bare, though, so I substituted a couple things: subbed sour cream for the yogurt and butter for the oil. The bread turned our great.

I made this for the first time, doubling the recipe as I had so much zucchini to transform into something delicious. And this was the trick! This is not the typical zucchini bread that I often find dense, sweet and oily. It is a wonderfully light and spicy gingerbread. At an elevation of 7600' I sometimes have to adjust recipes, but this worked fine just as written. The only difference is that I used 8 1/5" X 4 1/5" pans, and even doubling the recipe I only got 3 full-sized loaves and 1 half-sized loaf. I like this so much that I will be freezing some grated zucchini to make it later in the fall and into the winter. This is definitely a keeper recipe for me.

I wish I'd copied the recipe after the temp change was made; but good I was keeping an eye on the pan (I made one bundt cake out of the batch) while it was baking.  At 425 it came out pretty dark and crispy; but the inside is still light and fluffy.  I, too, had a ton of zucchini to use up (yes - people DO actually leave ginormous zucchini in your car if you leave it unlocked).  I then made a double batch (in the oven now) and forgot to double the eggs!  We'll see what happens.  If it works, I'll get back to you.

Different than traditional zucchini bread, but so delicious.  I used half zucchini and half yellow squash because that's what I had on hand.  This is a keeper.

This was so delicious!  I was looking for something other than regular zucchini bread and found this.  I used a fat free vanilla yogurt, added raisins and used half whole wheat flour.  This was so yummy toasted with cream cheese for breakfast.  This is a keeper!!!

Made mine in 5 mini loaf pans at 325 for 35 minutes.  Really moist with strong spice flavor (maybe a little too strong).  I'll try it next time with less molasses.  Unlike other reviewers, I thought it was sweet even with the healthy substitutions of half whole wheat flour, unsweetened applesauce, and brown sugar splenda.  For a breakfast item, still pretty high on sugar at nearly 10g per serving.

This bread had a moist texture, but not as sweet as I'd prefer. I suppose this is a "bread" and not a "cake" so I guess this isn't a serious infraction. Other than the sweetness, I thought this bread was tasty.

Better than any recipe I've made. I kept trying to remember what I did differently last year, that made the bread so much better. Now I realize, I was just using this recipe! Holy cow is it good! It reminds me of cake more than zucchini bread, I could eat an entire loaf! Now no one will eat the 4 loaves I baked with other recipes yesterday. They just want this, I may give them away.

When I made this recipe I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and 1 1/2 cups of wheat flour plus 1 1/2 cups of all purpose instead of 3 cups of just all purpose.Other than that no changes.It does not last long in my house.(surprise surprise)

I love this bread! I always use heaping measurements of the spices and molasses. I like to add raisins when I have them. Other breads seem so bland. This one certainly isn't bland! This is one of my favorites!

This is one of my absolute favorites.  I've made it several times and it always turns out moist and delicious.  I do use Honey Vanilla flavored Greek yogurt instead of regular vanilla yogurt because that is what I always have on hand, but otherwise I follow the instructions exactly.

Very tasty and moist. I wanted to make  traditional gingerbread and ran across this recipe instead, which was a great way to use up some frozen zucchini.  Recipe is a nice  cold weather variation on a regular zucchini bread for something a little different. I made it in a 9" square pan instead of a loaf.

No changes, nice and moist but with that thick gingerbread flavor.  Will make again, it's a nice alternative to all the same old lemon zucchini breads and chocolate chip zucchini breads in the world.

I had a lot of frozen zucchini in the freezer so figured this would be a great way to use some of it up and was very excited when I came across this gingerbread recipe because it fell in the Christmas theme.  I followed the recipe and baked them for 55 minutes and when I took them out of the oven they completely deflated and went flat.  They ended up tasting horrible and I was so disappointed...I had made up enough of the batter to make 8 loaves....next time I will do a trial run of 2 loaves first before planning on making to give away.

This was very good. We made it in our school cooking class today.  We made a dozen cupcakes and two small loaves.  We used homemade crystalized ginger which we chopped up fine and piped some frosting made with powdered sugar and a little milk and vanilla.  The students loved it even though several were hesitant because of the zucchini.  It's not very sweet, which I liked.  However, if I make it again, I just might add half again or double the amount of sugar.  Thank you Sarah-May for sharing this recipe.

I would suggest baking at 350 degrees instead of 325.  I would try recipe one more time since it sounds good. Too bad I wasted all my ingredients & my time.

The original recipe I printed out called for a 425 degree oven.... I thought that was a bit high but,  I tried it anyway......well,  as you can expect--the bread was dry and burnt.  I'm glad the recipe was revised.  I will definitely try it again as my boys love anything gingery.

Good gingerbread taste, but bread seems bland to me. Needs more sugar or salt or something.

I did not care for this recipe. I took this to a multi-family tagsale and shared it with friends. I was SO embarassed when I served it (I hadn't tried it before hand...big mistake.) Nothing about this worked for me...the taste or the texture.

I followed the recipe exactly with one exception.  I only had plain yogurt so used that with 1 tsp of vanilla.  Very tasty - everyone loved it.   I'm packaging grated zucchini in 2 1/2 cup portions for the freezer and will be making this long after my garden is bare.

Good, next time I will add more sugar though.
