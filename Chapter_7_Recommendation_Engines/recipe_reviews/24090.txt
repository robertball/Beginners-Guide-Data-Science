I own a restaurant and recently started making all our desserts in house.  This is one of my best sellers.  Two changes I recommend - (1)skip melting the caramels, I use the Smuckers caramel ice cream topping, and (2)reduce sugar to 1/2 cup.  I use a 4 cup measuring cup, put all ingredients in (except pecans), and mix.  Once mixed, stir in pecans and pour into crust.  I use a convection oven, and my bake time is about 45 minutes.  Once the entire pie jiggles as one I remove and cool.  Absolutely delicious!

I made two of these pies, with a few changes--one using the regular recipe (and substituting brown sugar for white) and one using 40 unwrapped Rolo candies in place of 36 caramels. I also put in more pecans than were called for (about 1.5 cups). Both were DELICIOUS!  I also took 6 caramels, a dash of milk and a pat of butter, microwaved about 30 seconds, stirred until smooth, and drizzled over the tops of the baked pies for a caramel topping.  The results were amazing!

Absolutely delicious, but very rich--a small piece goes a long way.  A couple of reviewers noted that melting the caramels took a long time.  Five to seven minutes over low heat is not long.  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, may cut it a little more the next time.  The amount of filling was perfect for the 9 inch shallow pie crust--just handle carefully, and put a round pizza pan in the oven while preheating, and place the pie on the pan.  My friends and family raved about the pie.  I am 73 years old, an accomplished cook and baker, and will definitely make this again for special occassions.  Thanks Corwynn for sharing this recipe with us.  Chef Gordon.

I used this as a filling to mini pecan tartlets.  I chopped my pecans into small pieces.  I made a cream cheese/shortbread crust:  beat 6 ounces softened cream cheese, 1 cup softened butter, 2 cups flour, 3 teaspoons sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Chill the dough for 30 minutes and then shape 1 tablespoon of dough into a ball, flatten and press into a mini muffin pan.  (My muffin pan is silicone.)  Fill the cups with 1 tablespoon of the caramel/pecan mixture.  I had enough leftover filling to fill 6 more cups, so you may want to decrease it a bit.  Bake at 325 for 40-45 minutes or until crust is very light brown.  Makes 36 tartlets.

I found this exact recipe on another website about 2 years ago.  I make it frequently because it is delicious and easy.  It is very sweet.  The only downside to it is the unwrapping all the caramels and cost of the nuts.  I always use Kraft brand caramels, though I have tried using cheaper ones a couple of times.  I did not get as good a result, so I would recommend only using the Kraft.  Also, I add slightly more pecans than the recipe calls for.

This was yummy!  It's a perfect recipe for fall weather.  I expected the pie to be "caramely" and chewy, but it was more like a pecan pie. I baked it for the time recommended, though, and it wasn't done yet. So I baked it 15 minutes longer and it was great! YUM!

I made this pie tonight for my family for dessert.  Everyone thought it was awesome.  I have never made a homemade pecan pie before and this was so easy.  It turned out perfectly and tasted so good.  As suggested by other reviewers I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I also only baked it for 40 minutes and used a deep dish pie plate.  I will definitely be making this pie again. Thanks Corwynn!!

This pie is to die for!!  It will be too sweet for some, but to me it was great.  Also, it makes a difference which carmel you get.  I have made this twice.  The first time I used the classic cooking carmels, and the second time I used carmel candies.  Don't use the candies.  When I did so it did not harden like it should, and also was too much carmel.

I've made this recipe a number of times and everyone always LOVES it--even when it comes out runny, which it has when I've used too many caramels.  Follow the recipe exactly (and use the smaller caramels, not the oversized ones you can sometimes find pre-bagged) and the pie will come out perfectly set.  this will always be my pie of choice, even when it's not the holidays!

I'm from the South so my family members have grown up on pecan pies. I bake these for family gatherings as well as for work potlucks and they're always the first to go. I make one change though. I use one container of fat free caramel dip (16oz) rather than the wrapped caramels. It has a better consistency and doesn't have that odd aftertaste that the wrapped caramels sometimes give the pie.

The caramel was not creamy when it was cooked in the pie.  It looked like pumpkin .  It didn't taste as sweet as caramel usually does. I made it for labor day and my family and I did not think it was very good.

This is an excellent recipe! Everyone who has tried it, my husband, friends, and family have said this is the best pecan pie they have ever tasted. I did modify the recipe a little, since I unwrapping the caramels were too time-consuming, I just used the Smucker's caramel topping for ice cream. It worked just fine. It turned out the same as when I actually used the little caramels but less work!

I convinced my husband to make this pie with my son for a "men's only" pie baking contest at church.  This was very easy to do, so he agreed, and it ended up winning FIRST place for "tastiest" pie!!!  Besides having excellent flavor, the texture had a perfect chewiness!!  So worth the effort by two inexperienced bakers!

I have to admit I was nervous about the carmel - I thought it would be too sweet.  This was the best, and SO EASY!  I used whole pecans for more crunch, and you know what - it just got better after being in the fridge.  SO quick and easy!  I wonder if you could use carmel in the plastic tub instead...  This is a great pie if you like pecan pie but don't like the super sweet kind. This was just perfect!

Excellent and easy... this will probably become my standard Pecan Pie recipe.  The only caramels I could find were Milky Way Chocolate Covered Caramels so I used 36 of them instead of plain caramels.  That gave it kind of a "Turtle" taste which was fabulous.  I also used a few more pecans (closer to 1 1/2 cups) since I used a deep dish crust.

This pie is amazing! Its so easy to make and everyone just loves it. It's bad to say but I couldn't help but eat almost the whole pie by myself! Instead of pecan halves, I put pecan pieces which worked just as well. Hats off to this pie!

What a great pie!  
I substituted brown sugar for white to enhance the deep color and flavor and was pleased by the results.

This was very easy and very delicous. 
I gave it four stars because there ended up being too much pie filling, and I had to discard the excess.

I made this three times this Thanksgiving weekend and it was well received.  The first two times I used 36 of the caramels, Milk Maid brand.  The pie had a dense consistency but was delicious.  The third time I used 30 of the Milk Maid caramels and the pie was smoother.  I used about 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans because I think it is easier to cut the pie if the nuts are chopped.  I baked for 45 minutes to perfection.  I used a brown sugar combo for the first two pies, but used all white sugar in the third pie.  I don't think there was too much difference.  All were delicious.  Highly recommend this flavorful pie!

This is the first Thanksgiving dinner I have made (or had - I live in Australia), and this recipie is absolutely delicious.  It is amazingly simple to make. The only changes I made were to use 1/2 a cup more pecans (to fill a slightly larger dish), and I used the basic flaky pastry recipe provided by this site.  All my guests loved the pie;unfortunately no leftovers though! I have several requests to make this in lieu of birthday cakes, so I will definitely be making it again.

My first pie, and it came out perfectly!  I recommend double the pecans, chopped rather than halves, half the sugar, and an 11 oz bag of Kraft meltable non-wrapped caramel pellets.

I've been making this pie for years and it's awesome, but a little runny. I found a solution. Instead of using caramels, you can make your own with sweetened condensed milk. You pour 2 cans into a pot, cover with foil and place inside a pan with 1/4" of water. Bake at 400 degrees for 1.5 hours and you have yourself some THICK caramel and then just follow the recipe exactly! Refigerate overnight and this pie comes out FANTASTIC and stays together VERY nicely!

This recipe was great!  I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  My husband's mother (an older southern woman) said that it was the best pecan pie she had ever tasted.  Great recipe!  I would recommend cooking for about 5 to 10 minutes longer than suggested.  Enjoy!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving this year.  It was a hit!  I had to cook it about 15 min less than the recipe called for, used brown sugar instead of white and used a deep dish pie crust. These were all suggestions that I got from the other reviews.  I'm glad I follwed them because they were all great hints.  Everyone loved it and it was even up against two regular pecan pies and still came out on top.  Thanks so much!

First pecan pie I made was a corn syrup style from Betty Crocker’s cookbook summer 1969. Pecan pie is my dad’s favorites. In the mid 80’s I GOT THIS RECIPE – my next-door neighbor from Michigan had NEVER seen a pecan pie (I am from where pecans grow!) I jokingly called it cockroach pie, as pecans can look like roaches if you wear heavy eyeglasses, and he does! We are now married –24 years later THIS is his favorite pie – AND  the review to use Smuckers caramel ice cream topping- OMG that will make it so much easier  THANK YOU restaurateur FLORENAS –for your great review- I also understand why this pie is your best seller – it outshines all - one time using caramels -all other ‘types’ of pecan pie making starting more than 40 years ago – I abandoned! Occasionally I send this pie by mail to my dad in Tampa FL - it holds up pretty well. NEW EXPERIENCE- I accidentally over cooked this at least 20 minutes. The custard was solid enough when cutting pieces - they held together GREATLY - good for giving to guests as a take home with only saran wrap. I did use aluminum on crust edges to keep from burning.

Best pecan pie I've ever had!  I followed the recipe exactly - except I used a bag of Kraft caramel bits that were already unwrapped and ready to be melted.  Such a time saver and this pie was a HUGE hit for Christmas dessert!

WOW!!! This was a major hit with my family. I used a deep dish pie crust and it filled to the top. Next time I may lessen the sugar amount slightly but all in all this pie was 2 thumbs up.......Way up!

The caramel flavor takes attention away from the pecan flavor. As a preference, we'll stick with a more classic version.

I loved this pie so much!  I made it for Thanksgiving, and had a very hard time not eating the whole thing myself.  It's probably the best pie I've ever eaten ever.
I doubled the amount of pecans and used light brown instead of white sugar.
I definitely recommend making this!  You won't regret it.

I made this with condensed milk instead of regular, 1/2 cup light brown sugar, and 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans - it came out fabulous!  It is the first and only pecan pie I have made that cooked in the recommended time and set up like it was supposed to.  I've given up on the Karo syrup recipes, and will stick with this one.  It is even better the next day as it keeps very well (the crust was not mushy as is the case with a regular leftover pecan pie).  I will try it with 1/2 cup regular sugar next time as my husband said it was a bit too "caramely" for his tastes but I thought it was great with the light brown sugar - just depends upon personal taste.  I would not go with more sugar though, it was definitely rich enough.  Will absolutely make again!

YUM! Nice change of pace from regular pecan pie! I made exactly as stated and then topped with 6oz melted chocolate chips! Kept in fridge to tighten up pie until ready to serve - I always have trouble getting pecan pies completely done in the middle! Thanks for the post!

This is such a unique and wonderful pecan pie. The pecans rose to the top and so the pie was actually like a creamy filling with a pecan topping. Hubby said he likes this one better than the Kentucky pecan pie that we had already given 5 stars to. This is an EASY recipe, worst part was unwrapping 36 caramels! Thanks and Enjoy!

CHOCOLATE CARAMEL PECAN PIE

This was the first pecan pie I ever made and I loved it (everyone else did too!). It was so easy and it tastes wonderful. I recently got some inspiration to add chocolate to this already sinful recipe after having a chocolate pecan pie at a restuarant. I added 1 cup of chocolate chips to the caramel misture when adding pecans. Stir in the chocolate chips (they will begin to melt) untill the chocolate and the caramel mixture are completely mixed together and smooth. Continue baking as instructed

Pecan pie is my favorite desserts, and I have tried many recipes, but I have to say this is probably my favorite.  I have brought it to work for several potlucks and given the recipe numerous times.  It's a big hit!

This was easy to make and very tasty, however the ingredients for the filling make too much for the pie crust and it ended up overflowing, be careful.

I'm not a big fan of pecan pie, mostly because of the heavy doses of corn syrup involved. To me, they're like eating huge globs of corn syrup with nuts! However, my family loves pecan pie and I needed a compromise. This was it! Replace the corn syrup with caramel and you actually have a delicious treat - in small doses of course. We grow our own pecans, so I used them fresh from the tree. The pie was so good that my family wants another one again real soon. It was the star of the Thanksgiving dessert table. Thanks!

This pie is delicious. I do not even like pecan pie but the caramel changes everything. I made my own pie crust. The only thing I changed was to use jarred caramel ice cream topping instead of the individual caramels. So much easier. I bought a 17 oz jar and used around 3/4 of it. (By the way, I still used the butter and milk to make the caramel sauce). I baked this for 45 minutes and let it cool overnight before eating it. It held its shape (no gooey insides) and was very tasty. I would recommend this pie, especially to those who have never liked pecan pie before.

I used 40 Rollos, that's an entire bag, and instead of white sugar I used brown sugar.  It turned out delicious!  I don't even like Pecan Pie, but I ate half of this!

Best recipe ever!! First time making pecan pie and I will go back to this recipe again and again.  I chopped the pecans and used 1 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup.  Normally I do not like pecan pie but this recipe changed my mind.  Can't say enough good things about this.

AWESOMEEEEE!!!! It was sooo scrumptious! I DEFINITELY suggest cutting the sugar in HALF though. It is already a VERY rich pie so it came out perfect doing just that. I also added 31 pieces of caramel and actually would suggest cutting that to about 27 pieces. I also added a half cup more of chopped pecans, but found that was a bit much for my liking (it came out pretty nutty) so maybe just add a third cup if you like your pecan pies less nutty. To help set the pie PERFECTLY (I like mine to hold its shape instead of a bit runny) Cook at 275 for 1 hour:))) Cutting out a few caramel pieces helps out too:) I took all of these suggestions from other reviewers and found they were SUCH a great help!

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a little too sweet and rich.  For some people, I know this isn't a problem!  But it was hard to eat more than just a few bites before it just to be too much sugar.  I will probably stick with a more traditional pecan pie for myself, but this was a really neat and different recipe.

I had never made a pie in my life and chose this recipe. It was easy and fun and a smash hit at the big family Thanksgiving feast. I used a pyrex glass pan and the Pillsbury crust from the dairy case. My sister's mother-in-law thought I made the crust from scratch! I did do the thin-layer-of-melted-chocolate-chips-in-crust modification and it added a wonderful touch.

This is a wonderful pecan pie.  The only change I might make next time is to use smaller pieces of pecans.  Maybe quarters instead of halves.

This is the best tasting pecan pie I have ever had.  It made Thanksgiving dinner at my boyfirend's home a complete hit.  His entire family loved it!  Now I just have to make a one for me so I can have more than just a little taste.  It went so fast.  Thanks allrecipes; you came through for me again!

It was a little time consuming melting the caramels.  However, it was well worth the extra time.  I liked this receipe and I don't really like pecan pie.

I made this two times. First time turned out awesome. Second time I put in too much butter. Don't make that mistake. It tastes good but very runny. Also, break up the pecans. It makes it easier to cut.

I made a total of 6 pies and two were messed up. Not all the carmels were fully melted and I missed it. Those pies went to friends and the they LOVED it. They said it was great becasue there were small morsels of carmel in the pie. So you maye want to reserve 20 camels and cut them into smaller pieces and addthem after the parts are combined. Also I mixed twice the amount or pecans into the entire mix.

Absolutely wonderful!  I also cut back on the sugar, to half a cup - one quarter white, one quarter brown sugar.  As I like to fiddle with recipes, I went with one jar of Trader Joes' Fleur De Sel Caramel Sauce - which is only 10oz, so I tossed in a handful of milk chocolate chips and a splash of dark rum - cutting back slightly on the milk.  Did not add salt as it was in the TJ's caramel sauce.   Came out wonderfully, even in my convection oven - I did not want soup, so I made sure I had a very firm center, then chilled it for four + hours.  A quick reheat right before serving, with vanilla ice cream - it was delicious.   Experiment with this this recipe, read the reviews and tips - all were very helpful. so I felt compelled to contribtute - not just read and take!   Enjoy!

This pie was EXCELLENT! I made it as per the recipe with the exception of substituting 1/2c brown sugar for the white sugar. The pie turned out sublime - not overwhelmingly sweet like so many Pecan pie recipes (it was plenty sweet - don't get me wrong - but not completely overwhelming). I made this pie for Thanksgiving this year and now it is on the "must-have" list for next year. Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

I used the suggestion to use caramel sundae topping in the jar. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. FABULOUS! I was told this was better than both my aunt and my grandmother's version! Definitely a keeper!

Yummy! I made this into mini tarts and used a cream cheese/shortbread crust. It was a bit time consuming but overall, it was cute and satisfied my sweet tooth. All the tweaks I did was to reduce the sugar to a half and chopped the pecans into smaller pieces. Definetly add a little bit more pecan.

Made tarts instead of a pie for a birthday. 
Used "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" from this site. I had a package of Werthers Crewy Caramels (app. 28 pc) and it worked a wonder. Since I made tarts I chopped the pecans.
Couldn't be easier and everybody was impressed .. Who could ask for more? (Me - I want a tart NOW lol)

This had a great taste, unfortunately though I followed the advice of another review that said to use Smucker's caramel sauce instead of real caramel.  I don't know what happened but I used that in place of the caramel, baked the pie for 1 hour at 300, refridgerated overnight and when I cut into it on Thanksgiving day it was just a liquid gooey mess.  The parts we could scoop up did taste good, but if I make again I will try it the real way with melting the caramels.

So easy and absolutely delicious!!  I used the Kraft Unwrapped Caramels and added extra pecans.  For the crust I used a Deep Dish Marie Callendar crust.  Huge hit, everyone raved about this.  I will definitely keep this one for future holidays.

Use Kraft Caramel Bits 11 oz package in place of the 36 wrapped caramels and it comes out PERFECT. Great recipe! I also used brown sugar instead of white and thought that made it even better. I also increased the pecans (because I love them!) and put halves on top. Served at Thanksgiving - everybody loved it more than traditional pecan pies. I didn't think it was excessively sweet or caramel flavored either. Everyone just asked how I had made such a great pecan pie!

Delicious but VERY sweet! The inside didn't completely set because of the caramel, which was okay with me but made the pie a bit messy.

The recipe was great with my alterations. I ended up using 28 caramel pieces and substituted water for milk (I was running low) I also used 2 eggs instead of one. And I used 1 1/2 cups pecans. I did have to leave the pie in the oven longer until it stopped jiggling and it turned out dangerously perfect (I had two slices in one day and I made it for dinner desert) my family loved it! I would give it 5 stars if I followed the directions the way they were wrote down. But I will definitely be making this again. Thanks

One word describes this pie.....WOW.  I live in Edgewood, NM, which is a very high altitude location.  I have not been able to bake a pecan pie that didn't end up runny. This one not only came out with the perfect consisitency, but it was also incredibly delicious. My husband's favorite pie is pecan and this is the first one I've been able to make that he wants me to make again and again. I have never been a pecan pie fan, but this one was fabulous. We will add this to our personal recipe collection!!!!!

Such a delicious pie!  I used a regular 9 inch pie tin and it filled it perfectly.  I did use 1 1/2 cup pecans as suggested.  I can't wait for christmas so I can make this again!

This is a great pie! Everyone loved it! Yes it is sweet and rich, but it is worth it. I'll say that it sets up better cold, but even gooey, it is delicious. This Thanksgiving test drive was a success.

Ahhh, divine.  My sister and I couldn't find pecans at the store so we substituted walnuts.  It was one of the best pies I've ever eaten.  I'm sure it is fabulous with pecans also.  I don't think I'll ever go back to regular pecan pie again!

I have been making this recipe for about 2 years now, andI am finally getting a chance to write a review. This is my husband's favorite pie, and I make it for Thanksgiving every year. It's definitely sweet, so beware if you aren't that big on the "rich and sweet" flavors. But if you're like me, you'll just top it with a nice scoop of vanilla ice cream and savor every moment of it. Mmmm...

I dont care for pecan pie but my father-in-law does and I made this for him using chopped pecans instead of whole because they are easier to slice. He loved it. Thanks for a great recipe=)

I do not like traditional pecan pie so I thought I would give this a try. I am so glad that I did because it was wonderful! I added a thin layer of chocolate to the bottom and it was scrumptious!

I thought this was amazing and very easy to make. It was time consuming to melt the caramels but it turned out so well. i didn't think that one cup of pecans was enough so I doubled up. Perhaps a little too much!! I also used a 1/2 cup of Brown Sugar instead of the white sugar (thanks for the suggestion) it was amazing. My boyfriend consumed the entire pie in two days. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Wonderful! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I've made two in the last month and both turned out great. I did change the sugar to brown sugar - like suggested in other reviews but it's the only thing I changed. Thanks again.

This Pie was so great! I made it for dinner tomorrow (t'giving) and my husband was driving me crazy, he couldnt wait to try it.  Secretly neither could I.  It was AWESOME.  Totally yummmy. Highly recommend it, easy too.I think you should watch the time though as I baked for 45 minutes and found crust a little overdone. Otherwise Top Notch.

Lots of Pecan Pie lovers in my family so I planned to make one for Thanksgiving. Then I thought how good it would be if one were to add caramel. I couldn't believe it when I actually found a recipe here! This was SO yummy! I would have given it an overall 5 but I didn't like the idea of buying the crust. The flavors blend so nicely and it is a real treat.I have always liked Pecan pie but now it will be my favorite!Ohhhh, so good!

I LOVE this recipe!!  I am always asked by my sister to bring pecan pie for the holidays.  (My sister LOVES pecan pie!)  This year she said, bring pecan pie but don't put anything "strange" (she meant brandy) :) Anyway, that being said, I didn't tell her this had caramel in it although she loves caramel too.  Well she Loved this.  More surprising I was never a big fan of pecan pie as I found most of them so tooth jarringly sweet that I just couldn't come to like pecan pie.  That is until this recipe!  I did cut the sugar to 1/4 cup of white sugar and a 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I made 2 on 2 different days and both turned out PERFECTLY!!!  Both baked at 350 degrees for 50 minutes.  I used Werther's soft caramels and used 33 pieces (I couldn't find any of the Kraft caramels) but the Werther's worked great.  I also cut the caramel to 33 pieces.  I was surprised that some had bad luck with the pie being runny and not setting up or taking longer to bake.  I always use an oven thermometer even though my oven has always been spot on for temperature (there's always a first time). Also, I find now days, the "large" eggs today are the small to medium eggs of "yesterday". I ALWAYS buy "jumbo" eggs in the super market, (but usually buy my eggs from people who have "backyard flocks" and these are ususaly heavy hens and lay BIG eggs). Possibly the runny pies that didn't set up were due to small eggs? To those people, I say get jumbo eggs and an oven thermometer! This recipe? AMAZING

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup like someone suggested. I also put a few semi-sweet chocolates on bottom of pie crust before adding the filling. Very yummy I would make this again.

This is awesome! I only use 1/2 cup sugar and I double the pecans. I use a Marie Callendar pie crust and it is super easy! Ever time I've made it, I've had people beg for the recipe!!

I thought this was awesome!  It was the first pecan pie I've ever made.  I did use Kraft caramels, and only 34--which was perfect.  I will try SF caramel icecream syrup next time as many suggested, but it really worked out perfect as written.  I used crushed pecan pieces because that's my preference.

Only thought would be to use a deep dish pie crust.  While a normal crust is fine (pie inflates, then levels out upon cooling), it was VERY full and I spilled a little getting the pie into the oven.  Perhaps that was just my own clumsiness!

Pecan pie is my all time favorite dessert and this pie is definitely a winner!! I've made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas the past two years and it is always a top hit. I usually use a few less caramels. 36 is a bit much. 30-33 will do it. DELICIOUS!

Voted the best of 4 pies at Thanksgiving this year.  Very rich!!!  Used Werthers caramels and 2 cups toasted pecans.  Husband insists that the unwrapping of the caramels is the key.  Have an expert do it :)

I made this pie to bring to a friends for Thanksgiving dinner. I forgot to rate it at the time but here goes: The taste was great but REALLY RICH. It was eaten by all as it was the only homemade pie we had but......It was sooo sweet. I could have just a small sliver and I even have a sweet tooth! I've tried other pecan pie recipes and enjoyed them for not being so sweet. Not sure I'll make this one again.

This was really very excellent. A slightly different take on a pecan pie.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out nicely. Must have ice cream to go with.

I halved this recipe and put in phyllo cups just to try it. DELISH! Took about 10 minutes to prepare and about 15-20 mins in the oven. The halved recipe called for 1/4 c and 2 tbsp of sugar.  I used 1/4 c brown sugar and 2 tbsp. white.
I also chopped the pecan halves. Because they were basically bite-sized, they were not too sweet. Because I was only trying this out, I had 15 phyllo cups. I halved the recipe and I think I had enough for 15 more. Good way to use up my pecans from the sweet potatoe casserole I made for Thanksgiving. Beats anything you can buy in a bakery.  A keeper.

I've made this pie for 5 years in a row during Thanksgiving and this pie gets rave reviews and never outlasts the pumpkin pies.  In face, a couple of years I didn't a piece so I had to resort to making two of these to meet the demand.  Do yourself a favor and make this pie.  Even if you don't like regular pecan pie you have to give this one a try.  It is delish!

I first made this recipe about a year ago and have made it for every family get together since!  I was never a pecan pie fan but this pie is amazing, my b/f begs me to make it all the time.

THIS IS THE BEST PECAN PIE EVER!!! The only addition that I did was mixing 6 caramel candies, about 1/2 Tblsp of butter, and a little milk in a bowl. Melt contents in microwave and drizzle topping on pie. FINGER LICKING GOOD!!!

A terrific recipe! I use 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the white sugar called for, and now my family asks me to make it every Thanksgiving. I even won an 'iron chef' competition at my local coffee shop with this pie. And I don't cook very often!

This was so yummy! I made it for the first time for a work picinic and I was a little worried that 'pecan pie fundamentalists' wouldn't appreciate the caramel base, but everyone LOVED it.  It was super easy to make and tasted great! This will definitely become a staple in my dessert arsenal.

I made this pie THREE times over the holidays and I could not get it right.  I liked the flavor enough to keep trying.  I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and it was like soup.  The second time I cooked it longer and it was still runny.  The third time I put less camel in it and it didn’t taste good and was still a little runny.  I always follow recipes exactly and I’ve never had a problem even with the most difficult recipes.

I'm giving this a 5 after slight changes as suggested by other reviewers. I used about 2/3 jar of Smuckers caramel sauce, cut the sugar down to 1/2 c, and added another 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. I baked this pie on the bottom rack and increased the time by about 15 min. I was scared that it wasn't set, but after it cooled I had the most perfect pecan pie ever. Each slice was rich and gooey but the filling didn't spill out when you cut into it. For those wanting a traditional pecan pie, the caramel flavor was not so obvious as to turn people off. I made both this and the Irresistible Pecan Pie, but this is the recipe I have been looking for!!! So easy, yummy and pretty. I will be making this from now on!

With a few alterations, this is the best pecan pie I've ever had! Instead of using caramel pieces, I used half a jar of Smuckers Ice Cream Caramel Topping. I cut back on the sugar, using 1/4 cup Splenda and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I used fresh pecans from my tree and chopped them up instead of using halves. It almost melts in your mouth! I will be making two pecan pies for Thanksgiving!

It was fantastic!  Just like the restaurant's were the comments from the guests!  I made my own pie crust ( used a new recipe which included sour cream in the dough)..it was fantastic.  The filling in the pie is so tasty you want to have more!  Was easy to make, except the peeling of the 36 caramels, but well worth the effort!  Being new to making dessert, I was not sure of myself, but ALLRecipes.com has yet to disappoint me.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie is great! I made it once for friend as a thank you and now he is always asking if there is any thing else he can do for me. I follow the recipe exactly but cutting the sugar won't take to much away from the taste.  Make this pie i promise you will not  be disappointed

This came out really runny and we couldn't eat it.  I think it was my fault though.  The bag had a few more than 36 caramels, so I threw them in the mix.  Either way, it was still the ugliest pie I've ever made and we nicknamed it "butt ugly nut pie".  I might try this again because if it comes out, it's a better alternative to the gloopy congealed stuff in the middle of most pecan pies.  I wouldn't whip it so much with the mixer so the top wouldn't get so poofy and ugly and I would probably put some pretty pecans on top.

I don't even like pecans, but this pie is out of this world! I did find that it would be helpful to use one of the deep-dish pie crusts, because the filling almost overflowed. My guests all loved it!

MAJOR MAJOR hit at Thanksgiving, everyone loved it I did cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup next time I might try the brown but the white was so good I am afraid to change it!! The only time consumming part is melting the caramel mixture. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe TRY THIS YOU WON"T BE SORRY!!! I made a new pie crust recipe from the Barefoot contessa show in the processor with this and it was THE PERFECT EASIEST PIE CRUST I have ever made For you that have food processors try it also!

This has to be the BEST pie I have ever eaten.  Thanks!

I poured the mixture in the pie crust saving  a litte of the syrup then decorating the top with pecans and pouring the remainer syrup over the  top. It looked beautiful!

Hubby wanted to know where I bought the pie - lol!

This pie was really sweet and delicious but I was looking for a gooey buttery pecan filling, which I think this desert is not. It taste more like caramel than anything.

This was incredibly delicious! I used 1 1/2 cups of walnuts instead of the 1 cup of pecans (because they were much cheaper). Wonderful!  Make sure you whip up a huge batch of fresh real whipped cream to go with this pie. Worth every fattening calorie!

Never thought I'd replace mom's Pecan Pie recipe, but this is the new family favorite.

My first Pecan Pie and it was great.  A must now for all holidays.  We found that we liked it best a bit warmed so we heated it up in the microwave.

I used twice the specified amount of pecans in a deep dish crust and made this pie along with my old standby pecan pie.  This one was the winner hands-down.  My family loved it!

This pie is AWESOME!!!!  Anytime I ask "is there anything I can bring?" when attending a party... without hesitation, Carmel Pecan Pie is the response.  This is great with whipped cream and a little bit of chocolate sauce drizzled on top.

Well, this pie certainly lived up to it's reputation.  I did 1/2 c brown sugar in place of the 3/4 c white sugar after reading the reviews and that was plenty sweet and had great flavor. I only baked for 41 minutes and it still set up nicely. I put a tin foil strip around the edges of the pie crust so that it wouldn't get too brown before the filling was fully cooked, but when I went to take the foil off, most of the pie crust edge came with it.  So if you are concerned about the edges browning too much, put the foil on after it has baked a while and the edges are firmer so they don't fall off like mine did.  Nobody cared about the lack of a beautiful presentation.  There are only 3 of us here and it will be gone today.  Obviously I won't be able to comment on whether or not it is better the next day.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Heavenly pecan pie!  I used 1/3 cup brown suger instead of the 3/4 cup white sugar, as I don't like really sweet deserts.  Also used deep dish pie crust.  I have tried other pecan pie recipes, but this one is way better than all others I have tried.

This pie was so scrumptious! I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  My husband who doesn't even care for sweets much, practically begged me to make another.  It's very easy to make delicious.  The only difference I did, was left it in about 15 more minutes for it to set a little more.  Other than that, I loved it.  Great recipe, thanks!

Very good and it didn't last long at our potluck. It didn't firm up though and I'm wondering if there's a trick to this? Will try again since the flavor was wonderful and rich!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and then again for my family at Christmas!  It is absolutely delicious, if you like a rich, caramel-y pecan pie (which I do!).  It turned out beautifully, and there is nothing I'd change about the recipe.

So easy to make, and so delicious to eat!  After pouring into pie shell, I added additional pecan halves to top of pie for prettier look and nuttier flavor.  I personally like more pecans than recipe calls for.  Rich, buttery taste!!!

I love this recipe! I have made it three times in two weeks and it always comes out great. The kids love to help me unwrap the caramels...and eat a few too. They get to help and we all enjoy. It is simple and everyone raves about it!I plan to make it a few more times before the holidays are over.

Incredible!!  Even my kids who don't like pecan pie enjoyed this one!  It seems to have fewer pecans than most pecan pie recipes, so there's lots of other good stuff to enjoy.  I loved it and know this recipe will be used again and again.

This was the first pecan pie I have ever made and I will certainly make it again!  It was so delicious and if I had known it was this easy, I would have done it a long time ago.  It was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner!  A big thumbs up on this one!!  Next time making it I would reduce the time to 40 minutes as it was a little dark.

This is the first time I have made a Carmel Pecan Pie and only the 2nd pie I have ever made. This turned out perfect,  my wife said it was the best pie she has ever had. I made this on 11/4/19, I have saved this recipe and will always make this one, it is fabulous.

My brother-in-law won't let me in my sister's house for holidays until I show him this pie through the peephole. It's very good, ignore the naysayers. I tried the ice cream topping caramel and personally found it to be inferior to the wrapped caramels. It's not that hard, just open them and slowly melt them, it's worth it. Let the mixture cool a bit before adding it in unless you want scrambled eggs in your pie. I boost the amount of pecans a bit and add an airline mini-bottle of Gran Marnier to take it over the top. Don't over bake it.

I stumbled upon this recipe when I was researching pecan pie recipes to make for thanksgiving. I used to work in a bakery, and they sold the best pecan pie. I knew it had caramel melted into the filling, so I used that as my guide to choosing a recipe. This one certainly did not disappoint! I think it tasted almost exactly like the bakery one I missed, only perhaps with more caramel? I might reduce the amount next time to 28 caramels, as that was suggested in a few of the other recipes I looked at. The only change I made was to add extra pecans, as they are my favorite and one cup was not enough. I probably used more like 1 1/4 cups, and then added a bunch of halves to decorate the top with. This pie received rave reviews this thanksgiving...everyone adored it!

I have made nearly every pecan pie recipe out there and this is by and far the best.  Wonderful texture, not at all that layer of corn syrup you find in every other pie and not so cloyingly sweet.  Thanks so much for sharing this!!

I made this according to the recipe and I loved it. I have tweaked it to make it more *I think* worthy of a decadent christmas gift :) I substituted the caramel for dulche, white sugar for brown, AND the kicker, heavy table cream for milk. It's in the oven now and smells DIVINE!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was so delicious!  I never made a pecan pie before but I love caramel and mixing it with the pecans was so tasty, it just melted in your mouth!  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe and I just might make one for Christmas too!

Fantastic!!!  I love caramel, and pecan pie so this combination was fantastic for me!!  I added ground sea salt to the caramel (about 5-6 good twists of the grinder) for that salted caramel taste.  It was amazing!  A new Christmas tradition in our family!

After reading the reviews I must say it has to depend on your oven because I made this recipe the exact same except I used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of white...it looks great and I cant wait for it to cool and slice and eat!!!! I will post pics later..THANK YOU ALLRECIPES.COM

I have never written a review despite trying some amazing recipes from this site.  This is the first pecan pie I have made, and all I have to say is....AMAZING!!!  It was gone in less than 10 minutes between my 4 boys and my parents (I got to taste one measly pecan).  "This is the best pie EVER!!!" from my picky eaters.  Great recipe!

Really good pie.  Wasn't sure what to expect, but the caramels in lieu of typical corn syrup adds a very nice complexion to this.  Just keep your eye on the crust for burning, as 45+ minutes is a long time.  I'd suggest getting your foil ready for the crust before you pop it in the oven.

My boys LOVED this pie!!! I found it a bit too sweet but they were in heaven!  We served with a scoop of lightly sweetened whipped cream.  

I will definitely be asked to make this one again but maybe next time I w will use the caramel sauce or rolo as suggested by other other reviewers.

Made this the other evening and was glad I did and so were the friends visiting.  I made a few simple changes on the fly, and really wasn't sure how it was going to turn out.  The end result was great, it’s a keeper.  The only changes I made, I used 1/2 c milk, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 1/2 cups pecans.  I cooked it at 350 degrees for about 30-40 minutes; every oven is different so I kept a close eye on it.  When it started to get brown and crusted on top I pulled it from the oven and placed it directly into the refrigerator.  The center of the pie was still loose, it did set and made a great pie.  Thanks Corwynn

I had a tub of Sheriff's Caramel Spread I needed a recipe for. I used a cup of the spread and reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup as per the restauranteur. I made 12 tarts and threw a few Pecan halves in each tart. The result was amazing. The filling fluffed up and became light and airy, not overly sweet. I made a batch in the morning and they were gone before lunch. Baked 30 minutes at 350.

This was a very yummy pie! I followed previous reviewer's recommendation to use ice cream topping instead of the caramels (I have a 1 yr old so prep time needs to be quick!). I used butterscotch caramel topping and reduced sugar to 1/2 c. It's a very sweet pie (especially with the caramel), so I probably could've decreased the sugar even more. I also prefer to use pecan pieces when making pecan pie because it cuts easier. Lastly, I also increased pecans a bit because it didn't look like 1 cup was enough. Made this for my husband's birthday and he really enjoyed it!

This recipe is perfect. I lost count a couple of times unwrapping the caramels but the pie was still amazing. .

Wonderful recipe and super easy! Followed the recipe exactly, except I made my own pie crust from scratch. I'll be making this one again and again! Very strong caramel taste...

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was very good! If you like a gooey, rich pecan pie, then this is the one for you. The caramel makes up a majority of the pie so if you don't have a sweet tooth, you might do better with a traditional pecan pie, but if you want a tasty twist for those with decadent taste, then try this :).

This was such a good pie. This was my first time making it and my family loved it. I took other reviewers advice and cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup and I used brown sugar instead of white. For the caramels I used Werthers Chewy Caramels 36 pieces and since I was using a deep dish pie I added 1.5 cups pecan pieces. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think I messed up on the cooking time. The 50 minutes that it calls for doesn't seem like enough for my oven so I finally took it out after an extra 10 minutes and I think I left it in for too long. My family didn't notice it but I do think that I left it in for too long. Anyways, this is a very yummy pie

Yum! Rich and sweet. I actually ran out of sugar, so I used half white and half brown. Turned out fabulous. I served with vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle.

First time I followed directions to the "T".  Pie was super sweet, tasted total caramel, and when the first slice came out the remaining pie gooed to the middle (it sat for at least 3 hours before we ate ).  Second time I used 28 caramels, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/2 tsp salt.  Pie held its shape and the sweetness was just enough, just borderline.  I might go down to 26 caramels next time.  I was looking for a flavor of caramel, not such an absolute.  This is a good recipe as a base.  It does lend itself to adjustment for taste.  I'm glad I found it, thanks!

This is a wonderful recipe and a nice alternative to using corn syrup.  I am serving this for Thanksgiving and I am sure it will be a hit!  
**It was a hit!  Everyone loved it, it was the first pie to go!  It has been requested to make more appearances...thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, it was very good and well-received. Even those who said they do not normally like pecan pie enjoyed this recipe. I will be interchanging this one, with my other standby recipe which is also from this site. Thanks!

MMMMmmmm... This is YUMMY. To be fair, I have a ridiculous sweet tooth, so the sugary goodness doesn't overpower my taste buds. It is very sweet though. I've been nibbling on a slice slowy. Like most other reviewers, I reduced the sugar to a half cup and increased the pecans a smidge. Overall, a very decadent desert for the less cavity prone of us. Thanks Corwynn!

Best served with an insulin drip;) Just kidding.  With a name like Caramel Pecan pie I expected this to be rich but was a little blow away.  That said, it was really pretty tasty.  I doubled the amount of pecans, and I may give it another go and reduce the sugar as suggested in other reviews. Serving small pieces with ice cream makes sense now--I cooled my pie at room temp, and the pie filling had an ice cream topping consistency--a good mix I would think.  This probably won't replace traditional pecan pie, but could easily become a "sometimes" option.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie is AMAZING. My husband loves it and I have to make him his own personal pie so he doesn't have to share. The only change I made after reading reviews was using the caramel ice cream topping instead of melting the caramels.

This pie is fantastically delicious! It was instantly the favorite dessert at Thanksgiving AND Christmas...I've made it 5 times and determined that, as another user mentioned, the Kraft caramels are by far the best to use.  After varying the sugar amount, I settled on 2/3 cup of white sugar as the ideal for me.  I'm a horrible cook--but I haven't screwed this one up yet! Easy AND delicious.

If you love caramel then this is definately the recipe for you!  I made it for our family Christmas dinner and it was dee--lish! I would recommend cutting the baking temp by 25 and adding on about 15-20 minutes of cooking time, though.  The top of the pie was perfect, yet the inside was still very gooey.  I also wrapped foil around the edges of the pie for the majority of the baking time.  I removed the foil for the last 20 minutes.  Perfect!  Another suggestion is to use pecan peices for the filling of the pie and then top with a handful of pecan halves, just so it cuts "prettier".  :)

This was a tasty pie.  The filling was thicker than your standard gooey corn syrup pie and not quite as sweet.  It has a subtle caramel flavor to it.  I have a huge sweet tooth, though, and prefer the corn syrup pecan pies to this one!

I made this for Thanksgiving a few years ago.  It is very tasty and easy.  The hardest part was unwrapping all the caramels.  I do think it is more expensive than other peacan pies that are just as good.

I`ve made this pie for the second time and I can`t say how amazing it was. For the first time I didn`t like this pie with a traditional pie crust. I made this with a cookie crust and it was wonderful. Made this pie with a chocolate cookie crust, you have yourself a real winner. Reduce sugar to 1/2 cup.

This was great!  Tasted just like regular pecan pie (in case you are worried that it would be too caramel-y).  I made it for Christmas dinner, and it was the first time I EVER made pecan pie, and everyone loved it.  My dad even finished it later that night!  Very easy, I will definitely be making this again!

I made this pie for my pecan pie loving boyfriend who was a huge fan! The only thing that I might recommend (and that I'll be sure to do if I ever make this again) is to use a deep dish pie pan- the regular sized one was overflowing after baking!

I cut the pie crust into little circles, so they would fit into a mini muffin pan.  I used Smuckers topping like someone else suggested.  The mini-pecan pies were a BIG BIG hit!!

My future husband requested a carmel pecan pie for Thanksgiving. Having never heard of such a thing, I thought he was loony, but then I found this recipe! It was absolutely delicious, in fact, the decision was it was as good or better than the standard pecan pie I've made for years. (Karo style) I took the advice of the other reviewers and made the quick carmel sauce to drizzle over the top...YUMMO! This is absolutely going in my recipe box. My FH told me this pie was so good it made him fall in love all over again!

Like Leila I too used 2/3 of a jar of Smucker's carmel sauce cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used an 8oz bag of pecan halves.  This pie was really great!  I was worried it would taste to carmelly (if that's a word) but it tasted just like traditional pecan pie.  Delicious!  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

mmmm.....taste of heaven. i didn't think there was too much sugar. i used the same amount that the recipe called for, but i did adjust the way it was cooked. i lowered the temperature to about 325-330 baking it for an hour entirely covered for the whole time it was in the oven. this allowed the pie to bake perfectly without browning the top or the crust too much.

The most delicious pie I have had in a long time!  I did cut down the sugar to 1/2c white, also instead of the milk and butter for the caramels, I used 1/2c evaporated milk.  The taste with 1/2c sugar was spot-on; I can't imagine using the full amount and the pie still being edible.  It cooked for 45 minutes even; it was jiggly and seem unfinished when it came out, but it set up perfectly and we were able to have small "Test" slices 30 minutes later!!  Hey, you have to test it before you bring it to the party, right? :)

This pie was great, especially warmed up with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!! When I made this I changed a few things, I lowered the sugar to 1/3 cup, exchanged the milk for bourbon, and upped the pecans to 1 1/2 cups. And make sure you cook it long enough so that the consistancy is just right.

I found this pie to be just ok, not great. I prefer the traditional pecan pie texture. This pie had a sweet potato pie feel to it. It was good but not great.

Everyone always requests my "special pumpkin pecan pie" for the holidays. I don't care for it as much as everyone else does, so I decided to try and make this for myself while everyone was eating the other. But, everyone ate this instead! They now have a new favorite!

My husband, who normally doesn't like pecan pie, loved this pie.  It's pretty sweet, but to me the caramel flavor makes the sweetness easier to handle than some other pecan pies.  The first time I made it I was in a rush and took it out  5-10 minutes early - it's still great even when the middle isn't set!

Very tasty and easy to make, but my pie did not set completely. It was runny in the middle even after completely cooled. I placed it in the fridge and served it cold to thicken it.

Best Pecan Pie EVER!!!  Every single family member that partook in this dish absolutely loved it (even those sceptical of Pecan Pie thoroughly enjoyed it)!! It was the first dessert eaten up and the first requested for the next family event!!  Thank you!! : )
Tip: I did add about 10 extra caramel pieces so not to waste any in the bag. YUMMY!!

I loved this! Sweet but I suppose that's how pecan pie usually is.  I might try to blend this recipe with the normal cornsyrup approach to see if I can achieve perfection.  If you do this with the Best Ever Pie Crust (I use half butter and half shortening and sugar in the crust also) it will be outstanding!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a VERY big hit with all the pecan pie lovers! Everyone wanted the recipe. I didn't think it was tough to make at all. It was a tad long melting the caramels but that by far was the most tedious part. I used brown sugar rather than white and used a deep dish pie crust. I used pecan pieces because the pecan halves were WAY too expensive! And for pretty presentation I placed a few chocolate chips and extra nuts on top when I took it from the oven. Tasty! Will make again!!!

Happy Thanksgiving! Everyone loved it and said it was the best pecan pie they've ever had! So easy to make and so delicious!!!
I think the magic was in the caramels. I used these caramels called Fleur De Sel Caramels from Trader Joe's that are flavored with French sea salt. Sounds weird, I know! But it was great!

I never would have thought I could have made a pecan pie.  Using caramels is a great short cut.  I had a very hard time not eating it all at one time.  This is so yummy.  My husband even asked me to make this for Thanksgiving this year.

This was really good  and it had a fantastic texture; however it's a bit too sweet for me.  I'll look for a more traditional receipe next time.

Excellent!  Per earlier suggestions, I used brown sugar instead of white, pre-baked the pie shell a little (5 min), covered edges with foil for the last 15-20 min of baking, and sprinkled a layer of mini chocolate chips on top (before baking).  WONDERFUL!

This was so delicious! I made 3 kinds of pecan pies from this site, (for a large THanksgiving gathering) and this one was my favorite. I only wish I could have gotten to it before it went cold! I'll have to make another one for just my family. Thanks!

I'm a big fan of pecan pie, and this pie is absolutely delicious! I made it for the first time today for Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit.  I took everyone else's advice and used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Also, I used 1 1/2 cups of pecan halves instead of 1 cup, and I'm glad I did.  This pie is so easy to make and the results are fabulous! Definitely a keeper!

This is the best pecan pie ever!  I've made it the last 2 Thanksgivings, and it was a hit.  I've been asked to make it again.  I did substitute for brown sugar, but I also made one w/ a graham cracker crust!  It was great!!

This was my first time making a pecan pie and I found this recipe to be great! I made one for Thanks Giving and it was gone in seconds. I had to make another one (by request), and that one did not last much longer than the first.

Wow! This pie is sweet and rich! We had too many sweets at Thanksgiving dinner this year and when I ate this I almost fell over cause of the sweetness. But as I got hungry again after hours and I started craving this pie again and realized just how much I like it. It is soo gooey and rich. It is best if you serve it without other sweets. Maybe after a meal of meat and potatoes or hamburgers, but mixed in with other sweets is a no no.

Very good recipe.  My husband and brother-in-law both love pecan pie and they both liked this recipe.  I had never made a pecan pie before because I thought they were hard to make, but this recipe is very simple, quick, & easy.  I'll never buy a pre-made pecan pie again!  When I make this recipe again, I'll probably not use as much sugar, because it was pretty sweet.

I wish I could give this more than 5 *'s!!!!  My crust got a little dark, so next time I will put foil around the crust during the first 30 mins of baking, but wow, the filling was EXCELLENT!  Wonderful creamy carmel center with perfect crystalized pecans on top.  Couldn't ask for a better recipe, and I am not even that big of a fan of pecans...  Thank you!

I've now made this twice.  First for Thanksgiving and it went over extremely well.  And then for a progressive dinner when I hosted dessert and put it into petite pie crusts.  I will definitely make this one again.  I added a few more carmels...just because I could, and it turned out wonderful both times.  This is a keeper!!!!

Not bad!!  Very rich and much sweeter.  Makes way too much for a 9" pie though, I made 12 tarts out of it as well.  Next time I'll cut back on the caramels and use only two eggs.  I thought cooking time was too short.  Needed extra 5-10 mins for me.  Fairly easy to do though.  Will make again but I think I'll stick with Pecan Pie V that is on here as well.

I made this pie for my boyfriend's birthday and he said it was the best pecan pie that he has ever tasted...and he's pretty picky!  It's fun to make and easy too.  Definately not for the health nut, but hey, you've go to indulge sometimes! ;)

Tasted great, but it didn't really set for me. It was really runny. But it did taste good. I may try it again sometime and hope it comes out right.

Excellent.  It taste even better when you take a slice and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds.
Put some whip cream on top and it's out of this world!

I have never made a Pecan Pie before and this one was pretty good.  It was a little different than anything I have had before because of the caramel, but very good.

I am a real pecan pie lover.  I was looking for a more gooy caramel like filling.  The filling was too custard like.  Taste was good.  I will make again using only two eggs.

Oh. My. Goodness! Followed this recipe to a tee. I've tried several pecan custard reciped that went straight from the oven to the compost. 
This pie is too pretty to cut although I did gently move a top pecan over and stole a spoon ful to taste. Delicious little pieces of pecan throughout, lovely melt in your mouth flavor.
The mix is super loose going into the pie shell but don't worry. It comes together beautifully after 40 minutes. Will jiggle when coming out of the oven.LET IT SIT. LET IT SIT 
A couple of hours at least until it thickens...yummy!

I made this last night. it is really good. The pecan flavor comes through very nicely and I made it less sweet than it calls for. I used 40 of the individually wrapped Kraft camels. The result was not a huge carmel flavor, but good. I think next time, I will see if I can find better carmels with a stronger carmel flavor. The recipe calls for 3/4 cup of white sugar, but I strongly recommend you trying less than this. I used 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet for me. Sweetness is a tough one though as everyone likes different levels of sweetness. The main thing to keep in mind here is that its easy to add sugar after the pie is done, if you find its not sweet enough for your taste. You can always add some powdered sugar on top. But its impossible to make the pie less sweet once the sugar as already been made. So best to add less sugar and add more if needed. Its also hard to find a good pre-made store bought crust, so I always recommend making your own. This recipe is a keeper to be sure.

This is so delicious!  I don’t like the proportion of regular pecan pie (filling vs. pecans), but the extra thickness of the filling here suspends the pecans and makes it a nicer texture.  And the flavor is amazing!

Wish I had taken a photo of  this pie before it was devoured. This recipe turned out perfect.It wasn’t runny like a few people have said. The only thing I did was add maybe 2 less caramels than it called for but that was because I ate them. Everybody raves about this pie. Absolutely the best.

I made this pie! it is fantastic! I altered the recipe a little. I used about 44 caramels & 3 cups pecans. It fit perfectly into a deep dish pie crust.
A hack I used in mixing the Carmel mixture into the eggs and sugar: I set the pot into cold water in the sink until the mix was WARM to the touch. I then poured about 3/4 into egg mixture to temper it. Once I mixed that, I poured the egg mixture into my Carmel. it worked brilliantly! 

This is the first "homemade" or "from scratch" pie I've ever made.

I took my pie to church to get the opinion of a baker in our area. She said it was the best pecan pie she’s ever tasted, but I’m not allowed to get a big head over it. Too late. Ha! Thank you for the AMAZING recipe!

This was a very easy recipe. Upon reading reviews I did make a few changes. Used brown sugar instead of white and reduced it to 1/2 cup. Omitted salt (salt in butter).  I did use caramel candies (Brachs) which took awhile to melt. Just b sure to melt on low.  Other people have suggested using Smuckers caramel topping to lessen the time. I cooked for 40 mins as my oven cooks fast. After 20 mins, I covered edges of crust with foil so it didn't burn. It will be puffy when you take it out. Don't panic. It will settle down as it cools. I also microwaved 6 caramels, pat of butter(1/2 Tbsp) and dash of milk for drizzle on top of pie. This was first time I made it and will make it again.

I added more pecans but everything else in this recipe is spot on.  I used a 50/50 mix of brown sugar and white sugar like some of the traditional recipes for pecan pie.  

Pop the bubbles in the mix when you put it in the pie crust before baking.  It will puff when you cook it and might look like it's going to crack when you take it out but it will settle as it cools and end up looking beautiful.

I add in more pecans (almost 2 cups) and split the sugar 50/50 white and brown to give it a more traditionally "pecan pie" flavor.

This was excellent.  Used 8 oz of caramel topping like others suggested.   I found the consistency to be a little "jelly" like but the longer it was in the fridge the better.  It still tasted fantastic.  Will make again.

I usually have a hard time with pecan pies being runny.  I was more fortunate with this recipe.  It was delicious.  I use an ice cream caramel drizzle over the top of the slice as well.  I love caramel.

I made this and let me say it was a big hit with everyone! If the only downside is unwrapping the caramels, then we are in good shape. I love how consistent this cooks as opposed to some of the 'wetter' versions of Pecan pie. Big fan!

Everyone that ate this pie raved about how good it was, and I loved it too!   I followed a  previous suggestion to use the caramel ice cream topping instead of caramels and to cut the sugar to 1/2 cup- and it worked so slick.

I make a pecan pie every year for Thanksgiving along with other pies.  I was looking for a little change this year and found this recipe.  Not difficult at all....the changes I made were to rough chop the pecans in the mixture then makes a concentric circle of pecan halves on the top.  When I say this pie was spectacular, well that's truly an understatement...family said it's a game changer!!!!  Unbelievably delicious...everyone raved about it.  Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!!

I wanted to love this recipe.  Caramel and pecan pie, two of my favorites combined.  I made for Thanksgiving and it was okay, not great but not bad either.  Just okay.  Followed recipe exactly and didn't have any problems, used a homemade crust.  There wasn't anything wrong with the pie, it just didn't "wow" me like I was hoping.  Good enough I wasn't embarrassed to serve it, but not good enough to take the place of my regular pecan pie.  Really glad I made and tried this recipe but probably won't make again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Yummy
I used the Kraft ready to melt balls.  The wrapped caramels has about 36 in the bag, the bag of ready to melt balls weighs the same as the wrapped caramels.  So I used the entire bag.
 
Per other reviewers, I used 1/2 cup of sugar, Brown sugar. 
I added the brown sugar to the caramel mixture so it would dissolve.
I doubled the pecans and used a deep dish ready made crust.
I cooked it for 10 minutes at 400°.  10 minutes at 350°.  Then lightly covered, 30 minutes at 300°. 

It wasn't too sweet or too caramelly (is that a word?)
Next time I might add some chocolate chips. Mmmmmmmm
Will definitely be making again.

I've made this three times so far. The flavor and consistency really improved, in my opinion, when I substituted brown sugar for white.

I had to make my own crust, to avoid a problem that's been plaguing me recently. I accidentally used salted butter in the crust, so it was way, way, way too salty. Haha, it was a surprise for mother's day, so I couldn't ask for guidance on salted or unsalted butter. That is the only qualm I had with my pie, but it had nothing to do with the recipe. The filling was amazing, mom loved it! The caramel was a journey and lesson learned in melting and mixing.
If you have any trouble mixing the caramel, boil a bowl of water and put the bowl containing the mixture and caramel onto the pot, the caramel will melt again in time and it will be easy to stir together, it took me about fifteen, twenty minutes. Once it was melted together, it was all good.
So, melting and mixing was a little challenging for the beginner (me), but overall, the pie was wonderful!

Made this by the book and it turned out perfect! I did however spend hours on the internet trying to figure out how many caramel bit I needed instead of the squares ! I couldn't find caramel squares. but it turned out perfect! and I served with reddiwhip and vanilla ice cream. Question for the holder of this recipe since I am now back in the uk what is a substitute for caramels I used Kraft in the US but here in UK I don't have a clue what to substitute with can you help please.

The pie was very good but my filling was runny at room temperature. After refrigerating it set up. After reading reviews I didn't count the caramels that I used so I'm guessing that was my problem, which is my fault. But I will make this again, it was a great tasting pie!!!

Nope, the top was beautiful and my crust was flaky buttery goodness. Yet when I cut into it the next day the middle oozed out all over. Maybe if I'd planned on serving it with ice cream and used the center of the pie as a caramel topping....

Wow. This is a keeper. I doubled the recipe, used a bag and a half of the Kraft Carmel bits so I didn't have to unwrap candy, used only brown sugar and extra pecans. This is an amazing recipe.

Tried this recipe twice and couldn't make it work. Very runny both times. Used caramel chips that someone recommended to avoid the unwrapping and think/guess/wonder if that was my downfall. Gave it 3 stars because I think yours truly was the reason for the issue. Overall very well rated. Make a decent regular pecan pie so may stick with that although I take these things as a personal challenge sometimes to either fix it properly or adjust it to my liking.

Hubby LOVED it and surprisingly so did I! The only changes I made was used brown sugar instead of white and decreased the pecans to 3/4 cups. DH doesn't like a lot of pecans. He has already ask me to bake him one by New Years.  Definitely will put this in my favs. Thanks so much for sharing!

My husband loved this pie!! I used a deep dish pie crust, and a bag of caramel baking pellets instead of wrapped caramels. I used brown sugar, and reduced it to 1/3 cup, although I may not use sugar at all next time since I think it would be sweet enough with just the caramel. I also used 2 cups of pecans, a mixture of pecan "cookie pieces" and chopped pecans. I will definitely make this again!

Best pie I've ever made.  Unbelievable.  I lessened the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of Kahlua.  Sooooo good!

For Thanksgiving I had to make the dessert and my family requested a pecan pie.  I don't normally like pecan pie, so I did a lot of searching and found this recipe. It was awesome!  I actually loved it, and so did the family.  The only change I made was that I topped it with hot fudge and topped that with some flaky sea salt.  It was like a huge turtle pie. Delicious!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving day and it was a really big hit. I will definitely make it again. I did do one extra step. After making the Carmel mixture I pored a little in the pie crust and swirled to cover the bottom. Family members are still talking about it.

I was looking for a pie to serve on Thanksgiving along with the pumpkin and after reading a review that said they used Rolo's in place of the caramels, I decided to try it with that alteration. OMG Everyone who has tried it loved it. I was sooo very glad I made 2 (and will even admit to making a 3rd a week later). It will now be a staple for the holidays and I am going to try a mini version to add to tins of cookies and fudge that are my regular holiday gifts.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was AMAZING!!!  I followed others advice and used 1/2 cup sugar and 1 1/2 cups pecan halves that I chopped myself to make a little smaller.  I used a package of caramel bites that don't need to be unwrapped and melted them with butter and milk as directed.  I baked on convection for 45-50 mins, wrapped crust in foil to avoid burning and it was perfect.  I've made pecan pies before with corn syrup and they never seemed to set right.  Everyone loved it, even those who don't like pecan pie.  I can't wait to make it again!!!!

My family has requested me to make this pie for 15 years at Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners every year. It must be kept away from warm kitchens and rooms with fireplaces though. Also, it is a good idea to wrap the crust with foil before baking to prevent over browning the crust. I use chopped pecans instead because it is easier to cut into the pie than the whole or halved nuts, which usually destroys the look of the pie with the first slice. It's a real crowd-pleaser for those with a sweet tooth. AIMS

I made this for my family's Christmas dinner. I was asked to do the pies which is scary because I am no chef. This pie was easy to make, used simple, common ingredients, and tasted fantastic. I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. It's chewy and has a perfect caramel/pecan balance. The hardest part was unwrapping 36 caramels.

I have been making the same delicious pecan pie for a very long time and decided to try something new. This is wonderful. I used an entire 10oz bag of pecan halves and I really think it's perfect. My husband is not a big pecan pie fan and he really liked the pie. I will definitely make this again.

I made this on Thanksgiving 2013 and my husband loved it. He is not a fan of sweets but now I have to made this pie for every occasion. I'm making 2 for Christmas. They go so good with Bryer's natural vanilla ice cream. I used about 1 and 1/2 cups of chopped pecans instead of halves. This is a great recipe!

Great recipe! Very simple and a delight for my Louisiana soul. I've always loved pecan pie and this one is the best I've ever tasted. The only thing that I wasn't happy about is the time it took to firm up. Although, it may not be fault of the recipe but fault of my own because it took about 3 hours one time and 6 hours the next. Maybe it was the temperature of the room or something but other than that it was perfect.

I am not a fan of pecans however, my Hubby is. He adored this pie and wants me to make it from now on. He had nothing bad to say at all. I followed the recipe exactly except for reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup.

Ha made it for the first time today. Wanted to try something new and this was defiantly it. I made lots of variations off the original recipe from peoples reviews. And let me tell you I'm a bad dude at making pies. only thing i didn't like was the middle was a bit soft and didn't set fully so i may have to tweak it a bit. but other than that a great pie my wife told me she fell in love with me all over again. Great recipe.

I'm not a baker, and this was one easy dessert. So yummy. The hardest thing about this recipe was unrolling the dough.

This was my first attempt at making a pie and I am incredibly pleased at the results. So easy and super yummy! I will be making this many many more times. The only change I made was using chopped pecans instead of pecan halves (at the request of my family). :)

Absolutely fantastic.  Stupid easy and tastes like you slaved over it.  The most time spent is shelling those darn caramels from the wrappers.  Thanksgiving will never be without this dessert!

I loved this pie. I followed the original recipe except I added special dark chocolate chips...it was a big hit and I will definitely make it again. Next time I will try the caramel ice cream topping like one of the reviews suggested.

Great recipe. I accidentally bought Smucker's fat free caramel ice cream topping in stead of the real thing, and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup per another user. The filling looked a little runny and I was afraid it wouldn't set up firmly so I added a little cornstarch to the milk. Turned out great and most importantly the family loved it. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I thought this was a great recipe. I've made it two times now. I took other peoples' advice and did 1 1/2 cups of pecans. I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 white and 1/4 of brown sugar! Yum. One time I did the pecans whole, the other I chopped them up. Personal preference.  It's quick to make as well!

I love the recipe.  I started making it about 3 years ago and it has been requested every year for family get togethers.  Like others I also reduced sugar.  Also I used mini pie shells once.  Follow the same directions except just sprinkle pecans on top of filling after poured into shells.

I made this recipe several times and everyone loved it! I've been told that I should make them and sell them because they were the best anyone has ever had. The only thing I did differently was add a few more pecans... this is the best recipe ever... a MUST try.

This recipe was very tasty! The guests loved it and my husband did to. I used the suggested 3/4 brown sugar to cut down on the sweetness and used Werther's chewy caramels because my husband loves them. I was slightly disappointed that it does not taste like caramel just because they are more expensive than a traditional recipe's ingredients would be.

My husband loves pecan pie and loves caramel, so I had to try this. It was my first time making pecan pie, and I didn't realize it was this easy! Following the advice of others, I used a 1/2 cup of white sugar, and it was definitely sweet enough. I'll be making this again!

I've made this for 2 consecutive Thanksgivings & at various potlucks, always a hit & its usually always all gone. Use individually wrapped $1 caramels at the local bodega, turns out just wonderful.

This is the best pecan pie I've ever tasted. I followed the recipe as written aside from adding a few more pecans. Super easy to make.  This is now my standard pecan pie recipe. Thanks for submitting this!

I made two of these for Thanksgiving, following the recipe exactly as written except I used pecan pieces instead of halves.  The results were amazing!  Pecan pie is my fiance's favorite and he said that once we get married I'm to make one of these pies every week...with that kind of endorsement this is now my pecan pie recipe!  Thank you so much!

Oh my....I love pecan pie and this one was supper easy and very good...the only thing I did different was...I used half white sugar and half Brown sugar total of 3/4 cup. Only because after reading other comments I didn't want it to be too sweet...very good. must try.

This is a super recipe. I decided to try it in place of the corn syrup recipe. Just as easy to make and it tastes better. I husband liked it way better than the corn syrup recipes.

This was fantastic! The first time I made it the pis was a FLOP! So I altered the cooking method the second time and it was PERFECT! I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown suger as others suggested. I made sure the butter and eggs were room temp. I blind baked the pasrty and toasted the pecans. I then cooked the pie at 275 slow bake for 1 hour. You know the pie is done when you hold the sides, twist gently. The outer filling should not move but the inside jiggles a little. Cool completely. PERFECT!

I have made this pie several times and it gets better every time.  I substitute the 3/4 cup sugar with 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar.  I also bake the pecans first for 20 minutes with cinnamon and raw sugar.  This pie gets rave reviews wherever I take it!

This is the best pecan pie I've ever had!! I actually don't think it's quite as sweet as traditional pecan pie; I was able to eat a much bigger slice! I didn't mix the pecans into the filling, I just sprinkled them on top and was able to get away with about 3/4 c. of pecans. Saved a little fat and calories but was still really pecany tasting.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out great! My family loves pecan pie so I thought I would try something a bit different. I did change recipe a bit and used 2 C pecans and only used 1/2 C sugar. It does have a different filling than traditional pecan pie, but it is excellent. I found it to be less sweet than the traditional pecan pie. Everyone loved it!

I made this for a pie contest at work and won!  I used Rolo's instead of individually wrapped caramels, which gave it a chocolatey taste, but it meshed well. I've made this pie three or four times now, and it always a hit. Thanks!

I hate pecan pie. But I ate most of this pie by myself.  Not too sweet and has a great texture.  I can no longer say pecan pie is gross. Thanks!!!

Chewy and rich!  My husband (a pecan pie lover) thought it was great.  I like the chewy caramel texture much better than the traditional gelatinous fillings.

this was not good.  the texture was weird.  i'm not sure if maybe i did something wrong, but i followed the instructions exactly.  the texture was too thick, and not like regular pecan pie at all.  my dh is a huge pecan pie fan, and i made this for him.  he didn't like it at all.  his sister also tried it, and she said it was ok.  we threw most of it away.

I've been using this recipe for 3 years now.  I use brown sugar instead of white and add an extra 1/2 cup of pecans.  It's easy to make and it's always a hit.  Follow directions exactly.  You don't have to use my changes above.

This is the best pecan pie. I was worried that it would depart too much from the traditional pecan pie which I love, but it's better to me. It still has the classic pecan pie taste, but the filling has that hint of caramel and a better texture. I've never been a fan of the jelly-like texture that corn syrup gives the traditional pecan pie.  This pie's texture is creamier. It's delicious and so easy to make.

This was AWESOME!!!  My family and I are really big pecan pie fans, but no one has tried to take on the task of making one from scratch.  That is until Thanksgiving this year, and I made this Caramel Pecan Pie.  Don't let the name fool you...this tastes like regular ol' pecan pie, but you make the filling with caramels instead of the traditional method.  It is the most fantastic pecan pie that my family and I have ever eaten!  And it was SUPER easy to make.  This was the first pie I have ever made, and it turned out perfect on the first try.  

I did make a minor substitution.  I am not a fan of regular pie crust, so I prepared this in a graham cracker crust instead.  Delicious!  I actually think this added to the flavor dimension of the pie.  I highly recommend this recipe, and I will make it again and again!

Although the pie turned out picture perfect, the consistency was just strange.  I guess I'm partial to southern gooey pecan pie.  This version was thick and not very sweet. I would use a traditional recipe over this one.

Ok..this recipe was a T-total disaster for me. I used the bottled smuckers caramel topping instead of melting the caramel squares...and when my pie was done the outer part was cooked but the inner the caramel poured out. So I didnt care for how this one turned out! 
Maybe better luck next time!

I made this for my grandson and he loved it. The entire family went back for seconds. I left out the pecans because he doesn't eat them, so it turned out to be a great caramel pie without boiling the cans of evap milk.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was half gone when I came by the next day. I also cut the sugar to a half cup, and used 1.5 cups of pecans that i toasted. I also just melted the caramels w/ a half cup of evaporated milk instead of what the recipe said to do, b/c I was more familiar w/ doing it that way. It was a hit!

Pretty good. I followed other reviews and halfed the sugar and used brown instead of white, and I thought it was not sweet enough.  Next time I will follow the recipe as it is written.

Perfect combo of caramel and pecans.  Hubby didn't think he liked pecan pie til he tried this.  Never leftovers of this in our house:-)

Delicious! As stated in the original recipe, I left the frozen pie on the counter while I prepared a quick meal. By the time we finished eating our meal the pie was perfect for cutting. Everyone loved it!

This was delicious. But as time consuming as it was to unwrap all those caramels (100) since I baked two pies, it is not THAT much better than a traditional pecan pie. Also, I did cut the sugar a bit, and I'm glad I did. I cannot imagine how sweet it would have been with all that sugar, because my pies were plenty sweet and I am a sugar fiend!! Very good though, just too time consuming.

I've made pecan pie many times before, but I made this one for Christmas dinner because it sounded like fun to make.  Everyone loved it!  Next year I'll have my grandchildren help by unwrapping all the caramels!  I can't wait!  Great recipe!

I made this the weekend I had a cocktail party. I decided to put about 8 pieces on the table thinking people probably wouldn't want pie, and it was completely gone in the first hour. And people kept asking what was in it and savoring every bite. I have made it three times since! Great recipe!

I am still learning the ropes on how long to bake this, but I LOVE THIS PIE!!!! My next door neighbor is a pecan NUT and she said that she's tried pie all the way across America and this is the best she's ever had. I agree.

I was really looking forward to this recipe.  I LOVE pecan pie and caramel but I thought this recipe was just "ok".  I just didn't think the flavor was that wonderful.  I brought it to Christmas dinner.  Only one other person (out of 18 people) had a slice and chose the other desserts available. I would rather have the taste and texture of a tradional pecan pie and drizzle caramel on top.  I'm deleting this from my recipe box.

LOVED, LOVED THIS RECIPE.  I MADE 2 AT THE SAME TIME...EASY TO DOUBLE, JUST SPLIT INTO 2 PIE CRUSTS.  I DID ADD 1/2 CUP TO 3/4 CUP EXTRA PECANS TO THE RECIPE AND IT CAME OUT FINE.  I'M GLAD I ADDED THEM.  THE PIE'S PUFFED UP WHILE BAKING, BUT SHRUNK WHEN RESTED. PEOPLE RAVED ABOUT THIS.  NOT TOO SWEET LIKE OTHER PECAN PIE'S.  DEFINATELY RECOMMEND.

Oh Wow! This pecan pie is awesome -- my favorite pie is pecan and this is my favorite recipe for pecan pie! It's easy to make -- the hardest part is taking the wrappers off the caramels (and not eating any of them).  It comes out really pretty -- a little hard to cut but oh soooo good.

I was looking for a great recipe for a desert to take to my dad's 50th B-day party, he loves pecan pie, but when he tryed this he loved it and even passed on his own birthday cake for 2nds. My husband also gave it fav reviews and insists that I make it again this weekend for Christmas. This really is a great pie, and very easy to make, the hardest most time consuming part was unwrapping the 36 candies.

I reduced the sugar to 1/2c, per many other reviewers, and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white; and I upped the pecans to 1.5c.  I paired this with the Butter Flaky Pie Crust from this website which was very good.  This pie should be baked in a shallow pie plate as there is not a large quantity of filling.  While it tasted very good, it is not a traditional pecan pie, so if you are expecting that, don't.  The filling is basically a soft caramel candy filling.  As others have said, it is very rich and a little goes a very long way.  My stepdaughter, who wanted a pecan pie for Thanksgiving dinner, loved it and would give it a 5-star rating; I don't have much of a sweet tooth and probably wouldn't make it again unless requested by her, so I wouldn't rate it that high.  Am compromising with 4 stars.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Corwynn!

I agree that it is a little to sweet/rich for my taste, but the fact that everyone else who had it just raved means that it's a hit!  Thanks for the recipe.

WOW!  This was an excellent pie.  It tastes sweet but good.  I was used to buying the store stuff and was a little dissapointed in the look...it looked like pumpkin pie in the center but it was delicious.  Maybe to bake a little longer but then it would be really hard on the top.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Holy Moly!! This is so delicious! I used sugar free caramels to cut down on the carbs and 1/3 cup brown sugar. Absolutely wonderful. I took a nap after Thanksgiving dinner, came back downstairs, and 3/4 of this pie was gone already.

Outstanding! Quick, easy and absolutely delicious! I used Reisens chocolate-covered caramels, which were perfect! I didn't think one cup of pecans was nearly enough - I used about double. This would be great with some good quality vanilla ice cream. Thanks, Corwynn! This one's a winner!

Easy to make.  Wonderful carmel taste.  I made it for a Thanksgiving Diner, and I was told I should have made 3 or 4. There was and assortment of dessets and this was the only pie that was fought over.  AWSOME RECIPE!

I just tried it yesterday. It was wonderful. The only change I made was using only half the sugar and substituting the white sugar for brown. The pie taste so much better after being in the fridge overnight. Thanks Corwynn!

This is a very good pecan pie.  I recommend anyone to make it.  It goes very well with Vanilla Ice cream.  Almost taste like sweet potatoe pie.

the second time around was better...covering it with foil after 30 min or so helped to keep the top from burning. it was fun making it~

I made this dessert last week and my family couldn't believe it was home-made.  It was gone in a flash!  It was my first attempt at making a pie and the recipe was so easy to follow. Sinful to eat.  Thanks for the amazing recipe.

Delicious pie - the caramel and pecans are a terrific match!  Be sure to serve it with plenty of vanilly ice cream, though...it's perfect addition to the sweet, gooey pie.

This pie is great!!  I have one in the oven now for a neighborhood cookout this afternoon, and I made one last Christmas that everyone loved!  The only change I made was cutting the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  Everything else is perfect!  Thanks for sharing this recipe Corwynn!  It's the best!

This is a most excellent pie.  The first one I made, and the first one gone at Thanksgiving.  I made mine with a very good homemade pie crust recipe I received from my grandmother.  I will definately make it again for X-mas!

This pie was very rich and goes great with a big glass of milk. Would probably use a deep dish pie crust next time.
