I like this marinade.  I have actually used it to marinate meat for stir-fry, not just yakitori.  I didn't have sake, so I used white wine instead and it still turned out good.  I will definately make again.

Fantastic! We used this to marinate chicken for 45 minutes and then grilled it. Had a great slightly-sweet flavor to it. Will definitely use again!

Great marinade! It's quick and easy to make and tastes wonderful on boneless skinless chicken breasts and really any vegetable. Though I did add an extra clove of garlic and a squirt of chili sauce. Definitely one of my new staple meals.

This had a really good flavor... BUT I would not recommend using it on chicken wings. I think the flavors of this marinade would be better for beef or pork -- I marinated wings in this for half a day, and the skin on the wings was more like rubber when the wings were cooked.

Very tasty!  Made it with skirt steak on the grill.  A very nice flavor to the marinade that is not too sweet.  My entire family enjoyed it.  I will be trying this again with chicken.
