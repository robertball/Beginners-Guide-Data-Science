I got ahead of myself and didn't read all of the recipe. I combined all of the ingredients  but it still worked out really deliciously  good. Next time I will follow the directions.

I had to substitute several ingredients.  For Mike's Hot Honey, I used honey + pepper flakes; Cardamom, I used 5 spice.   Cook time was 22 minutes or a little longer.    I would make this again!

Really liked this. I had no trouble getting the kiddies to eat them. I will keep this recipe.
