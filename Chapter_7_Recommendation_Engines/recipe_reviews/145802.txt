Did not change a thing. These are some of the best burgers ever. Perfect for the grill. UPDATE: We've made these a number of times now, so we don't always have all the ingredients on hand.  You can substitute italian style bread crumbs for the garlic and herb, any type of full bodied beer will do (we used Michelob lager, beer just gives it more moisture). You can use parmesan instead of romano and you can use 1/2 to 1 Tbsp. of dried basil vs. fresh or just leave it out depending on your tastes.  After mixing everything together and making the patties we always leave them in the fridge for a half hour to let all the ingredients time to settle before grilling.

These are fantastic Burgers!  Here are my changes:  I used a 3 cheese blend of parmesean, romano, asiago.  I did not add any of the beer.  I used a white onion instead of green, and added a green pepper (very finely chopped so the meat holds together).  I also put the meat in the fridge for about an hour before grilling because it helps the patties hold up.  Other than that I followed everything, and these were some of the best.  I have tried the dried basil, but stick to the fresh basil if you can, it has a much fresher taste, and really comes through in the burger.  DO NOT RUIN THIS BURGER WITH A CRAPPY BUN, buy a nice kaiser or something from the bakery, butter it and toast it on the grill.  You will not be disappointed.

We served these burgers at my son's first birthday party.  It was a hit.  My six year old nephew loved them and he has refused hamburgers for his whole life.  He liked them so much he ate two and they were easily 1/3 lb burgers.  I would definitely makes these again.  No changes necessary!

Best burgers I've ever had. Made a few minor changes, but pretty much stuck to the original recipe.

I don't know what I did wrong, but my hamburgers would NOT stay together... They tasted good, but fell apart too easily. I'll try them one more time...

It sounded better than it tasted in my opinion.  I do like the fresh basil in the burger.

I followed the recipe with the only difference being the type of beer. The burgers completely fell apart and were near impossible to flip. I think the coals got more than I did. The flavor was quite good though. This recipe would make an excellent meatball but it just doesn't work well for grilling.

Flavor was good, but they fell apart way too easily on the grill.
