Fantastic!! We love blue cheese, and this dish was amazing. The only change we made was we used half & half instead of heavy cream to lighten up the calorie load just a bit. AWESOME RECIPE - will definitely make again! (and again, and again..)

This was an awesome, easy recipe. 1 oz blue cheese = 3 Tbs. For this recipe I used 2/3 cups of blue cheese. We didn't have walnuts, but chopped pecans went well. Thanks for the new dish!

Made this tonite, gourmet quality easy quick and versitle , added about 3 oz cream cheese to sauce and also doubled. Sliced up a couple steaks on top of pasta, but options are endless.shrimp, chic, bacon, or veggies would work fine. It's VERY filling. The guys liked it, hubb said keep this recipe;)  will make again for sure

So tasty! I stuck with the recipe except I used milk with corn starch instead of heavy cream just because it was what I had in the fridge. It was fantastic. For the leftovers I decided to add some grated tofu to just give it some substance, still super tasty!

The blue cheese sauce was phenomenal. Easy to make and absolutely delicious on the pasta. I actually made a little extra of the sauce , saved it and rewarmed it on the stove stop the next evening. I made grilled chicken and put the sauce on that too!

Yum! So easy and delicious. I served over butternut squash ravioli (bought in the frozen foods aisle) and it was delicious. I didn't change a thing except the pasta.

It was OK... This recipe ended up far too heavy, and became cold and solidified before I knew what was happening. Flavor was alright, but the sauce was too thick and didn't turn out well.

Wonderful!  I had to improvise due to having no heavy cream.  I used plain greek yogurt with some milk.  Also, I added some steamed veggies to the pasta.

Maybe a little more blue cheese and I tried with a little bit of extra pepper. But it's a really good, quick and easy recipe

This was amazing!! It was my first time making a sauce, and I was a little intimidated to try it out, but it ended up so well! The texture is great, the taste is subtle but easy to recognize, and its presentation is so easy to perfect! I did it WITHOUT the walnut topping unfortunately; however, I did make a little stir fry on the side that goes great when mixed with the noodle, or just used to clean the unused sauce. Would recommend, and will certainly be making again soon!
