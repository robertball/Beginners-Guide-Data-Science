These cookies are budget-friendly and simple to make and are therefore perfect for last minute guests, because they are also surprisingly delicious.  These cookies had the perfect amount of sweetness, especially when I sprinkled powdered sugar on them.  They were not too puffy OR too crispy.  Perhaps I made them too large, because I didn't get 40 cookies out of them.  In fact, it was more like 10-12 cookies.  However, I thought mine were a good size.  Oh, and they make a very sticky dough, but don't worry about adding extra flour.  They are good as is!  I will definitely be baking these again.

Amazingly good! I wasn't expecting much with so few ingredients, but I am pleasantly surprised. These are a definite answer to my after-school snack dilemma. Thanks!

Quick,easy, and delicious recipe! These do spread, so be sure to not use more then a teaspoon of dough.  Baked for 8 minutes at 325  degrees using nonstick pans. These are very fragil cookies and need to be handled with care. Cooled for 1 minute before loosening them with a thin spatula, left on pan until completely cooled.   Since they are such a thin cookie I decided to make them into sandwich cookies using a chocolate ganache that I had on hand.  I then coated some with powder sugar and drizzled others with melted chocolate chips. I was able to get 30 individual cookies (15 sandwich cookies).

Simple and quick but I was not a fan of the flavor and scent of these cookies.  They had too much of burnt butter & egg flavor/aroma.

These would go great with ice cream!  I made two changes to the recipe.  I added one tsp. of vanilla extract and 1/8 cup finely diced walnuts.
