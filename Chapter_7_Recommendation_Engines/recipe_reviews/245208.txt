Pretty good! I didn't add the corn syrup, but it was already sweet enough. It was very clean tasting and a great way to start the day!

It turned out really nice. It was really sweet and I wouldn’t recommend this for breakfast if you don’t like sweet breakfasts. Next time I wouldn’t add vanilla extract because it’s already so sweet and flavorful. It’s also very filling.

A bit thick but still great! I added a bit of milk second time and it can be drunk like a shake that way

I wanted to make sure I rated this!!! It was delicious.  It was very quick and easy because there is limited fruit dicing or chopping.  I used half almond milk and half coconut water for the liquid due to previous recommendations.  This was so tasty and satisfying. I will look up the author of this recipe for more like it!

This was delicious! The coconut really gave it something special. However, I would add a little milk to the smoothie mixture just to make it blend more easily.

Most delicious thing I've made for breakfast in a long time! I feel super full and satisfied as well. I skipped out on the toppings and the  vanilla extract and it tasted amazing while saving on some calories. Mine totaled to only be 294 calories :-)

It was a little sweeter than expected. Nevertheless, it turned out great! Beautifully decorated, and healthy too! I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this today and doubled it for my husband and myself.  The only difference was that I used frozen bananas and alternative milk rather than water.  This was superb - gorgeous color, superb flavor and was filling because of the toppings.  I suspect the sweetness is dictated by the ripeness of the bananas.  Excellent and healthy!  Thank.s...

I like to use milk instead of water and peanut butter instead of cashew butter. Sometimes I like to add in yogurt and a handful or oats to give it a superb texture and taste.

Good breakfast bowl! But I made it tonight for a late night snack, increased servings to 4 and toasted the almonds and coconut as suggested by the previous reviewer, next time I'll reduce the vanilla to 1tsp as it was a little too strong for our tastes. Thanks for sharing your creation Alli!

Great breakfast recipe! I used mixed berries instead of just blueberries. Next time I'll toast the almonds and coconut. Thank you for the recipe.
