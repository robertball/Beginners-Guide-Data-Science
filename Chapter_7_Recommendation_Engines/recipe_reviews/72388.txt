I made these for a luau themed party at work. I almost didn't take them b/c I was afraid too many people wouldn't like the pineapple or coconut but then figured oh well I made them so take them and I thought they were good. Of all the items I've made from this site over the years, this one got more positive results than any other. I had so many requests for the recipe and the men loved it!!! One told me to go into business and sell these cookies. Even my kids loved the crumbs that were left over so I guess I'll be making them
again. Not a difficult recipe and so worth the time.

I made these yesterday, with a few changes. Brandy for rum, lime juice for pineapple, vanilla for coconut extract, walnuts for pistachios, and 1 c. coconut instead of dried pineapple. I know that changes a lot about the recipe. But the basic ingredient measurements and baking times were dead on, so 5 stars.

Great texture and great taste!  It is a change of pace without being too strange for most people to enjoy.  The chewy pineapple pieces really add to the texture.  I found that both oiling and flouring the pan is crucial if you don't want overdone bottoms.

This was my first time making biscotti, and they came out great! I love pina colada, and pistachio nuts are my favourite, so I thought the combination would rock. It did! Next time, I will double the pineapple. Btw, I used fresh, not dried. Thanks sooo much for sharing this recipe!

Mostly followed the recipe.  Substituted vanilla for coconut extract, left out the salt because I used salted, roasted pistachios which I left whole and used coconut rum instead of just plain rum.  Would probably be good with any tropical flavored rum.  Fantastic result, can't wait to share with my co-workers.

I made these as party favors for guests at my mom's 60th birthday. Personally, I thought it was good, not great, but seriously, I got asked for the recipe no fewer than 12 times that evening! Everyone was opening up their packages and eating them even before dessert was served! They are definitely unique vs. traditional biscotti.

Perfect Biscotti! So flavorful, I messed around alot with this but still followed the directions and they were a hit. I threw in cranberries, coconut, anise seeds & salted peanuts! (maybe unsalted would be a better idea & roast them first) Wonderful..this one's definately a keeper.

I would consider myself somewhat of a biscotti connoisseur and these biscotti were absolutely amazing! The texture was wonderful and the flavors were perfect. The ingredients worked so well and I couldn't have asked for anything better. This was the perfect biscotti recipe. Thank you!

I have modified this recipe to exclude the nuts, and include a dipping in white chocolate mixed with a bit of pineapple juice and  malibu rum. Yummy!

Really great! Since I could only find the artificial coconut extract I cut the amount to 1 teaspoon. I was afraid the the artificial flavoring would be too overwhelming.

LOVED IT!  While looking for a coconut biscotti recipe, my eye caught this one.   I did make a couple changes.  I didn't have pineapple juice so I used crushed pineapples.   Also, i added an extra cup of coconut and left out the pistachios as I didn't have them either.  Other than those two changes, I followed the recipe.  The chopped dried pineapple is awesome and the extra coconut's a real treat.  Hubby was very happy with this selection.  Thank you McCoy for sharing your recipe!  This will be added to my Christmas collection!

I followed the recipe except increased the dried pineapple to 1 cup as when I tasted the batter I couldn't taste the pineapple.  Friends came over when the loaves had just come out of the oven and as I was licking with a sharped, but not serrated united, they wanted a taste.  The Italian husband said, "Why do you have to bake them again? They are perfect just the way they are!"  I let them sit several hours before the next baking, because I ran out of time.  I baked them when I came home, and they were delicious.  The only change I would make next time, is if I had to do a two-step baking, I would increase the second baking time.  However my husband things they are wonderful without being too crispy!  So this recipe seems to work in all of its stages and no matter what you do to it.. Thanks, this is a real keeper!

The flavors are great, and I give it four stars for that.  I made it today and I think the dough is too short (too much butter). When I sliced it it crumbled even after letting it sit for more than 10 minutes. The only change I made to the recipe was using pineapple that I had in the freezer.  It's not easy to find dried pineapple at the local big grocer.  I make biscotti every Christmas, so I thought this would be no big deal to make bake this recipe.  It' has a great flavor, but I'll have to make some adjustments.  The biscotti recipe I usually use is chilled for 2 hours for the dough to be handled easily.  10 minutes is not long enough go handle this dough, unless one puts it on a floured board and works the flour in the dough before dividing it.  But my husband likes it because of the flavors.  I'll make it with my changes.

I made these once before, delicious. I now have another batch ready to go but on re-reading the recipe the ingredient list calls for 1 1/2 cups of sugar BUT the instructions say to add 1 1/3 cups sugar to the butter! OOPS, I find no where else to add the remaining sugar unless I'm missing it.

I liked the flavors a lot, but the rum didn't come through. I adjusted for 24 servings so amount of rum was 2 T. I used a vanilla rum. Perhaps dark rum or just more would be better. this is a softer biscotti, didn't get super hard.

These are delicious!  The recipe makes a lot, which is good because they won't last long.  Will be making them in December to take to my cookie exchange (we can do more than just cookies.)
