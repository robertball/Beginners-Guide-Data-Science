Sorry, I get the 'shakes' whenever I see sugar in a recipe.  It has ZERO nutritional value and we consume far to much of it without realizing it. Therefore, you can substitute honey in a 1:2 ratio (in this case, 2 tsps) or less and make this VERY delicious and nutritional.

The cantaloupe has to be very-very ripe in this, or else the dressing comes out 'grainy' and messes up the salad. The taste combination is nice. I omitted the sugar.

Taste is nice. Light and not too sweet. Used organic Yogurt and came out a little more watery that I would have liked.

Next time I'll have the  melon and try to get a consistency more of a dip than a dressing.

This was a quick and easy recipe, but needed something to make it pop.  Totally dependent on the taste and ripeness of the melon.
