Very tasty and easy! I first had this at a funeral and I hunted the church lady down for the recipe! It reminds me of the candy bar dessert salads minus the nuts...which is an amazing find when you have a peanut allergy in the family! I like the pretzels mixed in, but alas, they do get soggy if you are toting leftovers. I thought the prrtzel crunch mixed in have it a very caramel like flavor. Try this you won't regret it!

I actually got this recipe from an aunt.  It is a tasty addition to a potluck.  I do not stir in the pretzels to serve it because if you have leftovers, you will have soggy pretzels.  It is much better to sprinkle some on top as it is served.

This is excellent and a favorite at family gatherings. You must wait until before serving, to mix the crunchy pretzels in with the rest of it, so they don't get soggy. Some will use the pretzels, as a crust, and put the rest on top, with some of the pretzels crumbled on top as a garnish. EXCELLENT!

This is such a wonderful salad. I have made it for years and a favorite of many I share it with. I agree, you can't add the pretzels until ready to serve. I typically use pineapple tidbits.
