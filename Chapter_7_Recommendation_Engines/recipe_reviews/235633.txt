It was so tasty, we did make some changes, we added mushrooms, and use tomato sauce because we got sauce instead of paste, we did follow someone suggestions about add wine and potatoes! We will make this again

The taste was fine but I knew as soon as I saw it, they were clueless on the cooking time. I am at almost 2 hours and it look slike it will take another hour. 1 1/2 hours? Nope. And where is every one seeing red wine vinegar? Yuck! Use something like a nice Cabernet Sauvignon. Good Luck

This fell a bit short. The meat choice didn't seem like it fit the recipe, should've went with a different cut. And the flavor unfortunately just wasn't there. Just was really lacking something.

Small changes as I made it for two.  I cut the portions and added the wine the last half hr along with a few small red potatoes.  Killer dinner.

I'm planning to make this, but using red wine like the recipe says. I can imagine that red wine vinegar wasn't too good.

We made this exactly as called for but started the cooking process earlier since we need we needed to tack on at least another hour onto the cook time,  Outside of that the recipe was great as written and the meal was delicious!!!

This was a delicious recipe and meal .  I pretty much went by the recipe but at the last minute didn't have tomatoe paste and used instead...v8 tomato juice.  I was a real hit with my family and I look forward to making it again.

This was old fashioned comfort food.  I used red wine and added carrots, onions, leeks, & mushrooms (because that is what I had in the refrigerator).  Served it with mashed potatoes.  Yum!
