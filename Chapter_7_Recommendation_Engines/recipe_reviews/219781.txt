I loved this - the onions melted in your mouth!  It was a little sweet for my fiance's taste, but I think we'll just try it with a chardonnay next time to see what a difference that makes.

This soup was so good. The port wine & thyme added a delicious unique flavor. Really enjoyed it!

This was a good soup but I prefer one with a richer flavor, not so sweet, and more depth.  I will try again with the Chardonnay.

Thanks for the recipe post!  I was trying to remember a similar recipe and didn’t know how much Port to add.  This turned out excellent!  I did make a few changes, I used yellow onions, did not add sugar (who needs the extra carbs)?! Besides, the port makes it truly scrumptious.   I did use 50oz of beef consommé, added a splash of liquid smoke, and let the extra liquid cook off w/the lid removed for about an hour.   I’m sure my changes only slightly changed the results - it was delicious!!

A very good soup, with lots of flavor. I  used sherry wine in place of white wine.
