I have tried it out and it's not really tasty..... Coz the favour was very strange and a little bit sour. However my friend said that is okay.

This recipe is really pretty good.  Not too sweet like a few chocolate cheesecake recipes, I didn't have any almond extract, so I used vanilla,I also didn't have any cherries but I had some  candycanes my grandma gave me, so I threw some crushed up ones in the crust, then topped it with crushed candycane, great holiday twist!  I would definitely suggest baking it in a water bath, just the straight oven gave me some serious crackage! all in all, a quality cheesecake

This recipe is out of this world!  Don't exclude the almond extract - it's the secret.  You can even add a little more for extra flavor.  I made this for several parties and potlucks and people who said they didn't like cheesecake were telling me it was amazing!
