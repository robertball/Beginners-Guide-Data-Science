This recipe needs help. But with a few minor modifications, it can be terrific. First, don't cook the shrimp separately - you're losing a lot of flavor that way. I heated up about 1 tbls of olive oil and 1/2 tbls of butter and sauteed the chopped garlic, chopped shallot (because I had it), red pepper (and I even added a little cayenne), a little basil and then the shrimp. Saute for just a couple of minutes then remove the shrimp into a separate bowl - leave garlic/everything else in the pan. Then I added the wine (a bit more than 2 Tbls) and reduced it before adding the tomatoes - here I added a touch more olive oil as well. Simmer/cook down and when ready to serve w/ pasta, add the shrimp back and cook for a couple of minutes. I put drained pasta directly into the sauce and it soaked up the sauce wonderfully. I also made only a 1/2 batch and it was enough for two meals for my husband and me. With these changes, it was delicious!

A pretty good recipe- very similar to my mom's shrimp fra diavolo.  My recommendation is to cook the shrimp in olive oil and a little light margarine with crushed red pepper prior to making the sauce.  The shrimp just seem to soak up the spicy flavor of the red pepper infused oil.  I love spicy though.....  I always use cheap but relatively good red table wine (love that Concha y Toro!) and plenty of it, though if it becomes too thin you can add tomato paste. Overall, very good with those changes.

Good, spicy, simple recipe! I added just a couple of things that turned this into a 5-star, "quick and easy" for my family - 1 pureed red bell pepper, and chopped fresh parsley and basil. The guys are loving the heat - and told me it's a keeper. Thanks!

This is the beginning of a good recipe.  The garlic taste was a bit too strong.  Next time, I'll sautee the shrimp in the garlic, then add the garlic to the sauce to simmer.  I added a little Italian Seasoning to the recipe, and that filled in the "missing flavor."  I might season the shrimp just a bit, too.

I loved this recipe and everyone I made it for couldn't get enough.  I held out on using the red wine and just sauted the garlic in a pan with olive oil.  I then added whole tomatoes which I cut up prior to putting in the pan.  I let that all simmer while I boiled my pasta and gradually kept ading hot pepper flakes and fresh basil.  I also added scallops and hot italian sausage(for that extra kick) to the sause along with the shrimp. I will definitely be making this recipe again soon!  AWESOME!

Good start to a recipe that ended up being fabulous. I sauteed garlic and onion in evoo and then added in my shrimp and red pepper flakes. Just as the shrimp turned pink I added the sauce and a little red wine. Loved by all Margaret and thank you!

i liked this a lot BUT and it's a big BUT after i tried it for the second time with some major modifications. the first time i made it it was sooo spicy and the flavors were right and then it lacked some in other departments. i modified with using only 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 7 cloves of garlic, 1/4 tsp of basil, 1/4 tsp of cayenne, 3/4 tsp pepper flakes (i can't believe this called for 2 tsps!), and i substituted the red wine for white. i also added about 1/4 tsp of brown sugar, then sprinkled some lemon juice over it once served. it was awesome!

Good for such a simple recipe to prepare. Will definately make again, next time I will not use the full amount of red pepper flakes. It was a bit too spicy (and I like spicy). Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome! I sauted garlic, chopped onions and a chopped fresh hot pepper from the garden. I made the sauce as directed but cooked it a little longer, I also added a little more wine at the end. For fish, I used shrimp, bay scallops and chopped clams. I served it over linguini. Simple, quick and delicious. This recipe is a keeper!!

I've made this dish several times with some changes.  I use less garlic, add in basil and sometimes oregano.  I use white wine instead of red.  I also use a little less pepper flake but use one can of regular tomatoes and one with diced chilis.  I've had several rave reviews from friends who've had it here.
Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Saw this on Giada's site.  Very easy and good.  As suggested, cook shrimp a bit in olive oil and red pepper for extra flavor --add when complete.  I use the Costco frozen shrimp and this becomes a very quick, easy meal the whole family loves.

this recipe needs help. there is WAY too much garlic and it just overpowers the dish. i think it is missing depth in it's flavors as well. i would definitely add oregano, basil, parsley, and sauteed onion to this and reduce the amount of garlic to maybe 2-3 cloves max.

I've been making this for years, but I make a smaller batch, using only the diced tomatoes. My kids don't eat real food, but if they ever start. I'll add in the crushed tomatoes to make the larger batch!

I followed some of the instructions that Jasmine posted in her review, and this turned out really good! I'm a beginner cook, so I didn't know that making a tasty tomato/wine sauce was so easy. I didn't have to measure anything, I just estimated how much I would need for 4 servings. I'm sure the way I made it isn't the best way, but I'll post my process and ingredients for reference:
First, I heated about 1 tbs of olive oil and a sliver of butter in the pan on medium heat. I put in 4 chopped cloves of garlic, 1/2 onion, 1/2 lb shrimp (halved, tails removed), and some spices (salt, pepper, parsley, basil, chili powder, generic spicy rib/chicken seasoning). When the shrimp was almost done, I took them out and added the red wine. I had a few frozen cubes that probably added up to a few tbs. I kept it on medium until most of the liquid was gone, then I added a can of diced tomatoes and the other 1/2 onion. Simmered for 20 mins, then re-added the shrimp, some ketchup (the sauce was a bit tart), and about 1/2 cup of pasta water and simmered for another 10. I only had spaghetti, so I went with it. The sauce turned out almost brown, so I was a little unsure at first, but I liked it more than any jarred sauce I've had. It was a little tart with a spicy aftertaste. Yum!

Just okay. If I were to remake this recipe I would grill the shrimp - or at the very least heat them up a bit.

Very delicious my family loved it! I followed a combination of other reviewer's recommendations. I used penne instread of linguini and used sour cream and some flour to thicken the sauce, didn't hold back on the crushed red pepper and added paprika and garlic powder. I used half of the garlic to saute  shrimp, butter, parsley and some more red pepper and paprika. Came out spicy but just right! Absolutely delicious!

This is a good recipe. Per other reviewers' suggestions, I added Italian seasonings to the sauce along with the garlic. Skipped the wine because I don't keep it on hand. Very tasty dish!

Decent recipe, although I followed the suggestions and sauteed the garlic with the shrimp. It certainly gave it a lot more flavour. I wasn't a huge fan of how chewy the shrimp was, but I think that had more to do with the ones I bought and not the recipe itself. I also put in more red pepper flakes to give it more of a kick.

I just whipped up this easy meal.  I altered the recipe a bit.  I didnt have any red wine on hand so I substituted that ingredient with balsamic vinegar.  And instead of crushed pepper flakes, I used the seeds and juice of 1 cherry pepper then chopped the pepper and sauted it in with the garlic.  I also added sundried tomatoes...it was fabulous!

Very good! A little to spicy for me. Next time I will use less red pepper. I also did not have wine so I used 2 dashes of red wine vinegar. I also used basil. This is very simple and easy. I will definitely make this again.

Watch out for to much red pepper. I'm from Texas and we love spicy food but this recipe does pack some heat. I prepared it for  gusests and I coud tell it was to spicy for one of them but the rest of us loved it. Maybe use half and add to it as you cook. (?) I did use fresh jumbo shrimp and cooked them til pink, adding to sauce at at the very end...don't want to eat dry shrimp...its like dry chicken. No buneo. Also...we added fresh mushrooms to the sauce and it was awesome.  Didn't have the crushed tomatoes or linguini so I used tomatoe sauce and bowie pasta and it was delish!

I gave 4 stars because I did make a few modifications as per previous reviews.  I sauteed the shrimp in EVOO, garlic, butter & flakes.  I also used canned Italian diced tomatoes.  Quite yummy!

This recipe was very tasty but too powerful for my taste ( and I do like spicy food ).  What is the taste of this recipe?  HOT!  Maybe, using all the pepper flakes was a bad idea.  I recommend trying this recipe a little more on the mild side at first and then see what your taste buds can handle as "heat".  Yes, this recipe could be very good if a little tamed.

It was a really light and refeshing taste compared to marinara or traditional red spaghetti sauce. I used sweet red wine but I also tried it with out and I would definitely say it's not optional. Without it, it was really bland, but altogether it worked well.

This only gets 3 stars because it’s a good base recipe.  I don’t understand people that give 4 or 5 stars and then go on to say they made a million changes. A recipe only deserves 5 stars if you don’t have to make any major changes. The one major flaw is that it doesn’t say how to cook the shrimp.  The dish is is going to taste different with each cooking method.  I sautéed the shrimp with oil and red pepper flakes( I doubled the shrimp because 1lb wasn’t nearly enough and I doubled the red pepper flakes because we like our spicy food really spicy, but that’s just our tastes) until almost done and put them aside on a plate.  I used the same oil to sauté the garlic and onions with a little salt before boiling them with the tomatoes and wine.  Then  to the sauce I added the linguini, a little pasta water for creaminess, and the shrimp and cooked for a few minutes to blend the flavors together, most of the red pepper flakes had stuck to the shrimp and I wanted them to integrate with the sauce. It was spicy but a little bland so I also added a little more salt and some black pepper, basil and oregano.  Maybe that’s not true to “authentic” shrimp fra diavolo, I don’t know, but it made the dish a million times better.  I reduced for another five minutes to make the sauce less watery.

This is the worst recipe I have made from Allrecipies. The sauce was terrible. I would not recommend it.

Very good with modifications. Took advice of another reviewer and cooked shrimp with garlic and onions etc. I modified the tomato sauce by adding a touch brown sugar and about 1/4 cup of chicken stock. Finally finished it with fresh spinach when reintroducing the shrimp to the sauce. This felt light and was a hit with everyone

Very little taste to this recipe. I had to add some spices at the end of making this which help to improve the taste. Not sure I’ll make this again.

Excellent recipe.  It tasted delicious and it was quick and easy to make.  I eased up on the Cayenne pepper and used both Italian bread crumbs and Panko.  Next time I think I will put in under the broiler to get the breadcrumbs brown.

I have made Shrimp Fra Diovola many times, but this was the worst one I have made.  The pasta draining did. Not cook the shrimp enough, and I only had 3/4 pounds. Of shrimp.  It was joy spicy enough, and also needed more salt and pepper.  Also added Parmesan cheese hoping to improve the flavor but didn’t help enough.

Way too much garlic!  Never thought I would ever say that about garlic, but maybe my cloves were bigger.
Pretty bland recipe.  I like the idea of adding onions, red pepper etc.

Very tasty. I used the tomatoes with jalapenos, and it was quite spicy, but delicious! Great for the sinuses! I also added the shrimp to the simmering sauce when it had about 2 minutes left.

It was really yummy (so says my girlfriend...oh...and me too). Bought extra shrimp and had some cocktail sauce, so had a good excuse for an appetizer. Kudos!
