Ok, I didn't follow the recipe but it was delicious and I'm sure it would have been even if I did. The changes I made: I doubled the recipe and used an entire box of elbow macaroni (whole grain). I used light cream cheese instead of regular and skim milk, and a combo of Swiss and Monterey Jack cheeses (4c total) instead of all cheddar. I also used white pepper (¾ tsp) and a generous swirl of siracha instead of black pepper and hot sauce (the cheese I used was white). The topping could be reduced to 1.5c bread crumbs (I used Panko) with 3 tbsp butter and fresh parsley. I omitted the jalapeno (for kids, although I'll use for adults in the future) also used a bit more Dijon (2tbsp for the double recipe). Even with my "healthier" changes, this recipe was delicious and raved about. Oh, and I made the cheese/macaron mixture a day ahead and run added the tipping and baked for 1h at 325 degrees before serving in a 9x13in disposable aluminum pan. Will definitely make again soon. Thanks!!

I made this dish tonight for the first time and loved it. I made a few changes after reading through all the review. Since the jalapeños were too spicy for my wife I left them out and substituted in one cup of pepper jack cheese with one cup of cheddar; reduced the cream cheese down to 4 ounces (half the amount). I crushed up a cup of stuffing mix to sub for the bread crumbs requested. This last step was done on a few other previous recipes and not only adds great flavor but a little crunch to it. This was awesome and will definately make it again.

Winner! I replaced the jalapenos with peas. Even my pickiest scarfed this. Oh, and we didn't make it to the crumb topping and baking bit, either. One day when they aren't starving TO DEATH I will make this properly, because I imagine it will be even better.

Very good! I only used 4oz. of cream cheese b/c I didn't want it to get too thick, and I did have to omit the jalapenos, but only because my girls were eating it and it would've been too spicy for them (I do plan on trying it w/ the jalapenos next time). This came out nice and creamy, not too thick and VERY tasty...I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I thought this had a fantastic flavor. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that I felt it had way too much sauce for the amount of pasta. Some of the older reviews mentioned that, but I only read the ones on the first page, so I missed it. When I was making it, it seemed like a lot of sauce, so I used about 3/4 of the amount on all the sauce ingredients, and half the recommended cream cheese. Even with that adjustment, it was too much cheese sauce. Next time I would use half the sauce ingredients (or double the pasta if I have more people), and maybe 1/4 the cream cheese. Full disclosure: I did throw some sautéed onions, garlic, and hot Italian sausage in, which I usually do for macaroni, and used a little Asiago cheese with the cheddar.

After reading the reviews I decided not to make any changes in the recipe's ingredients.  I did double the entire recipe as I was taking it to a full-moon snowshoe party pot luck.  Everyone LOVED it.  Many people mentioned that they don't like spicy food in other reviews.  I felt it was cheesy enough that the jalapeños gave a little kick, but didn't overwhelm it or taste too hot.  I did make changes in the cooking of the recipe in this way . . . after assembling the recipe I put it in a crock pot to keep it warm and transport it to the party.  That worked out very well.  I didn't feel there was too much sauce, as many other people did, as once it's heated through and mixed well, it absorbs the sauce.  My husband said I can make this recipe once a week as far as he's concerned:)  If you have young children, add broccoli, spinach, peas, carrots, cauliflower, any vegetable you want them to eat and I'm sure they'll eat it!!!

Fantastic white sauce although I can't imagine this with so little pasta! upped it to 2.5 cups and followed the recipe otherwise. Delicious!

I love mac and cheese. It is one of my favorite foods and I have been making many self made recipes for years... I have added broccoli, cauluflower, mushrooms, tomatoes, corn, (all at different times, some together). While my home made dishes were delicious this recipe was perfect. For those that say there was way too much sauce I completely agree... but if the directions in the recipe are followed you will find after cooking it is perfect. When pasta is cooked a little shy of tender it will absorb the sauces and continue to soften if baked. I used a can of green chillies and omitted the jalapeno as I do not like spicy food. This recipe is definately worth a go!

This is the best macaroni and cheese recipe I've tried.  I doubled the recipe to fill a 9x13 pan and omitted the jalapenos and halved the mustard.  Next time I'll reduce the amount of cream cheese ever so slightly.

This is a creamy and tasty mac and cheese that is easy to make and oh so good to the tummy!  I added a little more mustard and hot sauce the second time I made it, great both ways. Thank you for sharing! It's my new go to mac and cheese ??

I used the whole 8 oz box of elbow mac & then added a small handful more cheese to cover the extra oz of pasta. Skipped the topping-not a fan on mac & cheese recipes.  We all love this recipe!!

Giving it 5 stars to be fair since I did change some things...... As others suggested,  I increased the macaroni to about 12 oz instead of 7.  This completely ruined the dish!  It was so creamy when first mixed up to go into the oven but after baking for the short time it indicates, it turned out dry.  I did cut the cream cheese by half and I think that would be fine but should definitely keep the noodles as stated- 7 oz.  This was such a disappointment on Christmas.  Should have stuck to the original recipe, cutting cream cheese by half.  The flavor was really good, just dry.  I used Cabot seriously sharp cheddar cheese I will use it again when I follow this recipe as stated (minus half the cream cheese).

I really liked this macaroni and cheese.  I did make a few alterations like using 2 cups of uncooked pasta, only 4 oz of cream cheese, added a little bit of garlic powder and I omitted the jalapenos and hot sauce (kids).  Very creamy and at first I thought there was too much sauce, but when the macaroni cooled down the sauce thickened and I think the left overs will not be dried out like others I have tried.

I have to say, this is going to be my new base for cheesy casserole goodness...didn't have the spicy additions (jalapeno's or hot sauce) and I doubled the recipe, and used one block of cream cheese, and a package of laughing cow cheese.  Needless to say, the results were great, I split the results in two and had one plain mac and cheese and the other a tuna noodle casserole.  Both were big hits!  Can't wait to try with a different kinds of cheese...really awesome!!

Awesome recipe. Very creamy & the jalapeño adds the perfect amount of spice to cut the creaminess.

Absolutely sinfully delicious!  It was a home run for the family!  Only addition I gave it was I added some parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.

I really like this recipe and so does my family.  Basic recipe works well, however, I did make some changes.  My husband didn't care for the "mustard flavor" so now I leave it out.  Not a fan of hot sauce or jalapenos, so left that out too.  And also use a full box of macaroni (12 oz.) because recipe does make a ton of sauce.  The cream cheese really makes it creamy and I vary the other cheeses depending on what I have on hand.  I make it ahead and do the final heating in a crock pot which gives it a nice bottom crust.  Obviously doesn't have the nice crust on top this way,  but that can be remedied by baking the crumbs on a cookie sheet and then adding before serving.  So I guess I'm basically saying this recipe is very adaptable to individual tastes and equipment.

This was just ok.  I was expecting it to be creamier, but it turned out a little dry.  Instead of a half box of pasta, I used probably about 3/4 of a box.  Spicy is not my thing, so I left out the jalapeno and hot sauce.  Instead, I increased the cheese to 1 cup mild cheddar and 2 cups of sharp cheddar.  The topping of the bread crumbs was too much.  Itt definitely ovewhelmed the pasta.  Next time I would probably double the rest of the recipe, but still cut the topping in half.  I lowered the temperature to 350 and baked for an hour.  This is a good starting recipe.  The next time I make it, I probably won't bake it, just add the sauce to the cooked pasta and serve for a creamier mac and cheese.  Oh, and I will probably add in some American cheese as well.

This is my favorite mac and cheese recipe so far.  I doubled the noodles and used 3 cups of milk and 1.5 blocks of cream cheese.  Everything else was pretty much the same.  I used cheddar, shredded parmasan and some of another bag of cheese for the sauce.  Everyone loved it.

Holy cheese sauce!  While I was personally salivating over this dish, I'm not sure everyone would...especially if they have high cholesterol haha.  Twice as much cheese sauce as you need but I love that.  Very good.

This is DeeeeeLISH! I did double the recipe, but this is so rich, we'll be eating it for days--might try fried mac n chez bites with the leftovers. Only a couple of changes--mustard powder for Dijon, smashed crackers instead of bread crumbs, covered with foil for 20 minutes, then broiled, uncovered, for 3 or 4. And used a bigger pan than 9x13, of course.
You've made my family SO Happy!!!

This stuff is addictive!  I followed it exactly, right down to just barely cooking the noodles so they'd absorb some of the sauce.  Also put in the 4 chopped jalapeno slices... if you're worried about it being too spicy, don't be.  It adds a nice background flavor, but no heat.

Without a doubt this was the worst mac & cheese I have ever eaten. Made it exactly like the recipe and now throwing the entire mess away. Over powered by the taste of cream cheese, there is something about cooking cream cheese (which I love on bagels and in icing) that just is revolting. It shocks me that it has gotten these rating. Next time instead of cream cheese, I will use something different.

I give it 4 stars only because I didn't add the jalapeño (just a preference). We loved it and will continue to use this recipe. I love the little bit of heat you get as a result of the hot sauce. The first time, it was a little weak on flavor, so I used extra sharp cheddar this time. Delicious!

I did make this dish.  I did follow the recipe for the most part.  I would have liked it much better if I would have left off the bread crumbs and cut back a little on the cream cheese.  The dish was very good though.

This is a great way to spice up plain old mac and cheese.  My family loves spicy so this was a hit! I used a lot more hot sauce (Franks) than it called for but that's our taste, and I didn't have milk so I used Almond milk and it still turned out crazy good!

Best Mac and Cheese!  I used regular shredded cheddar and about 10 oz of elbow mac and had lots of leftovers with Chloe gone.  (almost enough for another meal without her).  Added leftover ham.  Used Panko with the 2 T. of butter mixed in to sprinkle on top.  Delicious!!

I made this according to the recipe but we didn't care for it.  Texture was unexpected.  Color was more white than orange. It tasted more fettuccini alfredo than macncheese.  And we were wanting...macncheese.

I made the recipe, as written, except for jalapenos because I worried about the family not eating it.  The only thing I would change is using sharp cheddar next time instead of mild.  Great taste and extremely simple recipe. Thanks!

I absolutely loved it and so did my husband. I kept the seeds for the jalapenos , but it wasn't spicy enough. I want to increase the spice. I am from Louisiana and LOVE spicy foods :) This freezes soo well and probably tastes better reheated haha

This is my go to recipe for Mac and Cheese. I've been using it for a few years  now because it does not use processed cheese.  I now add onions and garlic to the butter and saute until translucent.  Sometimes we add ground beef, chopped ham, smoked sausage, andouille sausage...  whatever we have handy. Peas and tuna are good too!  I also double the recipe because my husband and son take it for lunch the next day or we have the grandsons in town and they can power through some Mac and cheese.

This is the best homemade Mac and cheese I’ve made! I took the advice of other reviewers and used about 12 ounces of elbows, and I also used a lot more jalapeños (maybe 4x?) than the recipe called for. Leftovers were even better than fresh out of the oven! Will definitely make again.

Minus one star only because the bread crumbs toasted in only five minutes in the 400 degree oven. I put foil over it and baked it for another 15 minutes to make sure it was hot and bubbling before serving.

Absolutely delicious! I thought I was going to butcher it but it turned out great, I added banana peppers instead of jalapeno and forgot to add hot sauce but I'm sure it didn't make a big difference

Definitely making this from now on! Only changes I made was I used about half the recommended amount of jalapenos, and I substituted mild chicken wing sauce for hot sauce.

I introduced it as Buffalo Mac-N-Cheese at our memorial day meal with neighbors. Everybody raved and needed recipes and my own family couldn't stop telling me how good it was.

I felt it was a big risk since I made 4 3X19" pans and don't like anything spicy or jalapanos- but as it turned out, even I can't stay away from it- it's SO good.  The texture and flavor are better than any mac and cheese ever- I can't believe I love this so much- as I am a huge fan of regular mac and cheese- of every kind, I was fairly sure sauce and peppers would ruin it...but wow....I will never make it any other way. 

Thanks for a fabulous recipe! 

I should mention, it was too spicy for my little girl- 7yrs old...super sensitive to spice- but not to me nor my teenage daughter who generally avoid spice at all costs.  All the spice lovers were crazy over it...so hitting the hot but not too hot mark was pretty miraculous.  

Maybe I should add that I did throw a lot of prayer into the recipe since I made 42 servings on my first effort. Turned out to be a great gamble! Thank God!

Macaroni and cheese has never been a favorite for me, but this is the best version of the dish I've ever had.  The real fanatics in my family vote this as a solid 4.5 of 5. I've made this dish twice. 
The first time I made no changes. This recipe adds dimension to an otherwise simple, if not juvenile dish.  I made some additions to add even more depth.  Excluded: peppers  and bread crumbs.  Bread crumbs was too much. 
 ADDITIONS: Needed more pasta, added 2 oz. All to taste - Onion powder, granulated garlic, for the cheese, I used extra sharp cheddar cheese and medium cheddar cheese.  Topped with parsley.

My wife's family is catholic so very picky about their Mac N cheese.  I made this for a family dinner and all was super impressed.  This is a great recipe, you will not be disappointed.

I made this for a pot luck and everyone loves it. It's rich and creamy. I did not put jalapeños in it though. Still really good.

Pretty good, I made it without the jalapeños so I’m thinking if I did put those in it would of had more flavor. Would of put less breadcrumbs

I doubled the batch.  I used Romano, Cheddar and Gruyere, as well as 8oz. cream cheese. I believe more cream cheese could be used to create a dreamy consistency. I've been trying to duplicate a mac n cheese recipe that I had in Denver. Truly the best to date. I will continue to play with this recipe until  I achieve  "wow ".

I used twice the amount of pasta - small shells. Only need half the amount of cream cheese. I used half small can of  green Chile’s instead of jalapeños. And Italian herbed Panko crumbs on top. Amazing!

Amazing! But too much sauce for the macaroni. Had lots of leftover sauce.
Tripled the recipe, baked for about 40 minutes, came out great. It did not need that many bread crumbs on top, just a few.

I made this last night, and everyone got seconds!  I substituted the Dijon mustard with a couple of dashes of dry mustard, the jalapeno peppers with 1/2 small can of mild Hatch green chilis, and dry bread crumbs with herb seasoned classic stuffing mix.  Very tasty!  My MIL even wanted the recipe to hand out to her friends.

Very rich, but absolutely delicious. Instead of 2 cups milk, I added just 1 cup milk along with 1 cup heavy whipping cream. I used light cream cheese and no jalapenos. Would definitely make this again with a few spice tweaks.

I had some leftover pulled pork and wanted a mac and cheese recipe to throw the pork in. I made this without the mustard and jalepenos (I don’t like either of those things), and it was bangin. Brought it to a potluck and it was a hit! Might use less of the bread crumbs next time.

Best Mac & Cheese I've ever made!  I used 1 fresh jalapeno pepper, removed all seeds (instead of canned jalapeno) and added 2 cloves of garlic, finely minced the pepper and garlic together and cooked in the butter before adding flour.  I will be using this as my new go to recipe for Mac & Cheese!

I made it for 22 servings, 2 pounds of pasta. I had a lot of leftover sauce because my pan wouldn't hold it. It thickened enough that the dish could have used the remainder of the sauce, so I won't reduce it next time, just will use a bigger pan to bake it. I used yellow mustard and omitted the chopped peppers, and subbed some mozzarella for some of the cheddar since I was low. It would have been better with cheddar.

This is probably one of the better mac and cheese recipes on here. I really enjoyed it and it was easy to make. I didn't care for the jalepenos, so I omitted them. There's so many mac and cheese recipes to try until you find the perfect one for you and this one is worth trying out.

Turned out excellent though I'm not sure if my 2-quart casserole dish was taller and more narrow than average but I found the amount of breadcrumbs in the recipe was too much.  I'd cut it in half.  Other than that, it was excellent and kept very well in the fridge.  I spread it out over about a weeks worth of meals.

The flavor of the sauce is good, however as other reviewers said, there is WAY too much sauce. I had to double the pasta (luckily I had extra) otherwise it was like cheese soup. Aside from the extra pasta I had to add, since I doubled the recipe overall, I made extra breadcrumb mixture too. There was too much of that as well. I'll be using a different recipe next time.

Everyone loved it! We didn't do the jalapeno peppers and we added a bit more hot sauce. It was amazing! It does have a strong dijion mustard and cream cheese taste, though, so we might do less of those in the future.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was great! If I could find a way to get it a little more creamy I would give this five stars. Of course my four year old still claims this doesn't beat kraft mac n'cheese but this is a kid that views hot dogs as high cuisine. Thanks for recipe!

We had dinner planned and I came across this and it sounded so good I made it anyway.   I have a very good recipe already but this was so easy and the jalapenos enticed me.  DELICIOUS!!  Based on other reviews I doubled the pasta and was glad I did.   Easy and very tasty!!

Really did not care for this.  There are so many better recipes out there.  Because of reviews I did add more pasta and used roasted red peppers because that is what I had on hand. Everything else as written.  But I do not think that was the problem. It just had way too much cream cheese taste and hardly any cheddar.  If you want a Mac and Cheese with a kick I highly recommend Chef John's.

I particularly LOVE the jalapenos because they added a nice zing/zest to the  dish. I will try it with  cream cheese next time because I substituted that for shredded cheese. Overall, I still liked it and so did my family. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I used Lactaid instead of regular milk and fat free cream cheese. I omitted the Dijon mustard and the jalapenos. I also used white pepper instead of the traditional black pepper.

I need to preface this review with the fact that I'm a huge Mac & Cheese fan. As far as I'm concerned it's the ultimate comfort food so I've been looking for a recipe for awhile that gives me that creamy, cheesy goodness from scratch. This wasn't it.

Now, my review: I made this for Thanksgiving and although my S.O. enjoyed it, I was disappointed. As per the other reviews, I doubled the macaroni and there was a ton of cheese even for the amount of macaroni I used, so for anyone thinking of trying this, half the ingredients for the cheese for this recipe

The real trouble was the cheese sauce. It was all going well in the sauce pan - it was creamy and thick and gooey and everything I'd want for my mac & cheese, but that wasn't to be. I wanted gooey, but after coating the macaroni this dried out before I could serve it! The texture was off too--it was definitely not creamy. Also, in my opinion, the flavor was too mild, even with the jalapenos it was too mild. It needs something else. Maybe a stronger cheddar, maybe less flour so it doesn't set up quite as fast. I don't know.  

 I won't be using this recipe again. I guess I'm back to the hunt for the perfect mac & cheese recipe.

Love this, very similar to mine. I make a large batch with 1lb mac, 1 full jar sliced rinsed and drained jalapenos, 8 thick slices cooked and chopped bacon and a small bottle of mesquite smoked flavoring. After all is mixed add shredded colby and Monterey cheese then bread crumbs on top (chese mixture is the same except I use evaporated milk instead of regular).

Great base recipe that can be added upon. I used a cup of chopped roasted pablano (instead of jalapeno) and half a cup of chopped sauteed onion. I omitted the Dijon and hot sauce because I did not have any- didn't miss them. Great flavor, just had a little too much flour-y taste for me (the rue seemed quite thick). I definitely recommend doubling the pasta or halving the sauce!

I didn't like it very much because I thought it tasted rather sour. I'm pregnant at the moment so I'm not sure whether it's because of my tastebuds - milk is tasting sour after awhile atm. I'm going to redo it later again. My hubby really enjoyed it though, he did say it was different but he was looking for more the next day. Sadly or not really :) I accidentally left it out that night so it went bad next morning. The recipe was great. I used Italian bread crumb mix because that's all I had but it still worked out well. Other than that, give it a try. If you like it or not, you won't know until you do.

The only changes I made were omitting the jalapeños and reduced the hot sauce (I don't care for spicy foods) and it came out pretty well. I didn't think there was too much sauce, but I made it a day ahead and knew the sauce would thicken. The only thing I would do differently next time is half the crumb topping, there was too much for the dish.

Made this for thanksgiving last night and it was very disappointing. There's way too much cream cheese, it over powers the cheddar. It was basically like eating macaroni and cream cheese.

The cheese sauce ended up being like 5x too much compared to the pasta...  It was tasty but I prefer another recipe.

I followed the recipe and tasted it after mixing everything together.  My boyfriend and I both agreed that there was not much flavor to it.  We added even more jalapeno, and more pepper than recommended.  After adding this, it was still a little bit bland, but still good mac and cheese.

Used red peppers instead of jalapeños. Put half of cracker crumbs as others didn't want crumbs. Overall, everyone thought it was bland.

I found this kind of dry and bland, but the overall flavor was pretty good. I think it needs some more creamy cheese. I'm not sure if I'll make it again.

This was very good. It came out creamy and a nice amount of savory- and not too heavy. I didn't use the peppers. Next time I'd also use pepperjack cheese, 1/4 less cream cheese, and use 50% less bread crumb than what it called for. It appeared to be a lot of sauce at first but once it was finished baking it was perfect! We paired it with BBQ chicken and veggies.

I loved this recipe and so did my guests. I did add a mixture of Italian cheeses and used Panko bread crumbs as a topping.  I thought I would have enough leftovers for the next couple of days since I doubled the recipe however, my guests made sure that didn't happen.

The taste wasn't bad, but there were way too many bread crumbs. They gave the macaroni a bit of a sawdust consistency. After I scraped a bunch of them off  the top the taste was much better! If I make this again, I will only add half of what's called for

This recipe is great, especially as a base for various macaroni dishes. For example, I added a pound of ground beef and 8 oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes, used Mexican blend shredded cheese for a bit of Tex Mex flavor; and garnished with cilantro from my garden. Can't wait to try it with other ingredients; such as bacon, chicken, diced tomatoes, broccoli, peas, shrimp, etc.

It's really good, but the amount of bread crumbs was insane. I will make it again, but only use half (if not 1/4) of the bread crumb and butter topping (or omit it completely). It's rich enough without it.

This turned out awesome. Huge hit at BBQs and super simple. DO NOT make only 7oz of noodles. Way to much sauce for that. I did 16oz and kept the rest the same and it came out perfect.  good recipe

The only change I made was using an entire box of elbow macaroni instead of half the box. It came out delicious and I'd definitely make this again. But next time I'm using more hot sauce!

I know that the recipe should be judged as it was written but I had to deviate only slightly. I like spicy food so I used a little more jalapeños, and I fried up some bacon to crumble in. Because, you know...bacon. It was great :-) Thanks for the recipe.

Even my pickiest eater loved it. I did make changes - we like heat so I upped the amount of jalapeños . I also upped the cheddar cheese about a cup and added about 1/4 cup sour cream. I didn't have breadcrumbs so I crushed up Ritz crackers.finally found a recipe the whole family loved. Thanks!

Made recently and based on the other reviewers, I increased the mac to 1 cup.  Still too much sauce for the mac.  The dish looked salmon colored and not appealing.  Perhaps I'll try it again using white cheddar instead of yellow.

I really like the kick this Mac and cheese recipe has. I used fresh jalapenos and with the hot sauce, the dish turned out super tasty. The bread crumb top turned out deliciously golden and added some great texture. This recipe really knocks regular Mac and cheese up a couple notches.

so I wish the Macaroni was translated to cups. I made it as a chicken casserole added frozen Spinach, canned Chicken, and Mushrooms. Omitted the Jalapenos, and hot sauce. Delicious! Also I used a mixture of regular and whole grain pasta.

Delicious and super creamy. I used homemade breadcrumbs made from a stale baguette and they added a nice crunch. The recipe is perfectly seasoned.

I've made this twice now, and it's been a big hit! The first time, I omitted the jalapeños because I have a toddler, but otherwise made no changes. Everyone loved it. The second time, I added broccoli and cubed cooked chicken to make it more of a complete meal, and it was great! Very creamy and delicious.

I changed a few ingredients (I used mozzarella instead of cheddar cheese, coconut flour instead of wheat flour and rice bread instead of wheat bread as the bread crumbs) to make it safe for my food allergy son but it was still wonderful! I also added cooked bacon just before putting it in the oven. It was a hit with everyone!

Great recipe, but the 7 oz of pasta is not enough noodles for the amount of cheese it makes.  I would use at least a few more oz of pasta next time.  Sautéed about 1/2 cup of chopped onion into the butter.  Used only about 5 oz of cream cheese and it was still a wonderful flavor.  Sprinkled Panko bread crumbs on top instead of measuring a full cup and omitted the parsley and butter.  Added grape tomatoes on top - a nice touch.

I didn't  really  like  this  recipe  that  much. I followed  the  recipe but the  only  ingredients  I left out  was the jalapeño  and hot sauce. When  I  tried  it, it was  way too  thick. I had  to  add a little  more  milk to thin it out. It was  also  a little  too  bland. I  didn't  really  care  for  this  recipe.

I left our the jalapenos because my littles don't like spicy and it was still delicious.  DO NOT add any salt.  the cheese gives plenty.  I did salt the water while cooking the pasta.

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I would make a few changes but it is a kick- recipe!  I used a 16 oz. package of large elbow macaroni. 14oz. would have been just right with all that sauce. Everyone who said to cut the cream cheese to 2/3 to 1/2 were right. It needed more cheddar-probably one more cup. I used Cabot's white sharp cheddar and would have prefered Cabot's Seriously Sharp Cheddar instead.  I cooked at 400 for 20 min.- It didn't bubble around the edges but the topping was brown & crispy. I only had some buttery crackers so I used them (ground up) with the 2Tbsp. butter and parsley. It was not too much because I used more than double the amount of pasta.

It sounded a lot better than it turned out. The dijon was a little overpowering to me, I'd recommend cutting it in half. And I would also also go light on the bread crumbs. I'll probably omit them entirely next time.

I thought the mac and cheese was very good and I did not think there was too much sauce.  The problem I had is with the bread crumbs. I think 1 cup of bread crumbs was way too much. I will definitely make this again, as we really liked it...just will cut way down on bread crumbs, or just leave them off.

I have a favorite "go-to" macaroni and cheese recip but decided to give something else a try on a whim.  I made this recipe but opted to not bake it in the oven. My super picky daughter loved it and requested that I make it again for her school lunch. This recipe was a win-win for my family!

Finally a Mac and cheese that isn't bland! Mine was a little dry, but I had a partial box of pasta and my ratios were likely off. I will make again and keep an eye on that. The flavor is spot on!

Delicious, but a bit heavy on the crumb topping. I think 1/2 cup would be plenty for our tastes.

Love baked mac&cheese and this recipe hits it! Didn't have jalapeño or hot sauce so I sprinkled in some red crushed peppers. Used 1/2 C. Italian bread crumbs & 1/2 C. Panko. Used about 14 oz. elbow noodles (cooked a 16 oz. box but I could see it was too much when I was adding the noodles to the sauce mixture) and a 1/2 stick of butter to mix with bread crumbs. I kept all the other ingredients as called for. Baked @ 350• for 35 minutes. Everyone was quite happy! FYI, the dark areas on top (in my pics)  is from my sprinkling some paprika on top.... won't do that again!

Outside of using whole wheat pasta and panko breadcrumbs I followed this recipe completely so I can know if I need to make changes. Everyone really liked this; from a 2year old to a couple of  early 20s to middle aged . It's creamy with that little bit of crunch. The only reason I am stingy with 5 stars is because we all need to be "WOWED " and this didn't get us there, but we all still really enjoyed this recipe. It was gone in 24 hours. My 23 year old son ate the other half the next morning-in one sitting. I think it would be just fine to use low fat cream cheese or a cream cheese substitute. I also used 2% milk, not knowing which one to use for the recipe. I always use real butter if a recipe calls for it. I think it makes a difference in richness and a little bit once in awhile is not a bad thing! I read once to always buy blocks of cheese rather than pre grated for absolute freshness and taste. So I did that. The left over block was quickly devoured with crackers!

I used an entire box of macaroni like others suggested, it was too much pasta. Next time I will use less. I could taste the jalapenos when I first ate it but not when eating a second time so I will double the amount next time. I used panko bread crumbs for extra texture.

Yummy!!!!!! I didn't have Dijon mustard so honey mustard was used. Also instead of hot sauce I used smoked paprika for a smokey flavor instead. Turned out great, that cheese sauce is pretty amazing! Happy cooking ??

I tried this recipe last night. It turned out great. At first I thought a cup of bread crumbs was a bit much, but they settled in nicely as I let the dish stand awhile.

We did not add the jalapeños and used 16 ounces of pasta.  Really good!

Didn't really care for this recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  Still trying to find one I like.  The taste wasn't right for me and I didn't like the texture.  It certainly wasn't dry.
