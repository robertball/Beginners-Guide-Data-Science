This was wonderful! I changed a few things only because I wanted to use what I had in my pantry and frig: My package of stew meat was a little larger than 2 lbs, so I used it all; I used an entire can of chicken broth to avoid waste; my cabbage came in a 16 oz pkg and I used most of it (next time I will use all of it); I used a 16 oz can of diced tomatoes since 8 oz cans are hard to find; my tomato sauce had garlic, basil, and oregano in it. This is definitely a keeper and a stew I will make again!

This is one of the best stews I have ever made!! Bursting with flavor, thick and savory. I made it exactly how the recipe said and I will most definitely be making this again.

This is a great low carb meal.  After browning the meat, I took the meat out and sautéed the onions in the dripping until they were brown --which added another dimension to the taste.  After the onions were brown I added four cloves of garlic and the greek seasoning and sautéed those spices for a few minutes.    I almost doubled the cabbage, used the whole 14 ounce can of tomatoes.  A splash of vinegar and a splash of wine enhanced the finished stew.  Yum.

I made this but didn't want to use the beef bouillon cube so just used beef broth instead. I had a green head of cabbage leftover so used that instead of bagged so I had to double the liquid to cover all the cabbage and beef. The Greek seasoning I had to find on this site by another reviewer. Added that after I browned the beef. It was delicious! My mistake was adding a can of diced tomatoes to it since I didn't have plum tomatoes or sauce. It changed the flavor dramatically! It was okay according to my husband but will try again without tomatoes. The Greek seasoning made this recipe.

I grew up on this stew! My Russian grandmother made it all the time! Sometimes she would add carrots if she had some on hand, and there were always potatoes too, otherwise this is spot on and delicious!

I started this recipe by making my own Greek seasoning using the seasoning recipe I found in this app. Yummy! I then doubled the stew recipe and used fire roasted tomatoes rather than plum. I cooked in a cast iron Dutch oven and my cooking times were a little shorter. I had unexpected visitors while it cooked, and they thought it was delicious! The broth is quite flavorful and it makes a hearty meal.

Made a few changes and the outcome was very delicious. I didn't have greek seasoning, so I looked it up and made something pretty close to it. I added the seasoning to the meat as it browned, along with the juice of one lemon. I realized at this point that my meat chunks were too big so I took them out of the pan, poured out the drippings, cut the meat into smaller pieces, then added them back to the pan along with a couple splashes of italian dressing. Once the meat was browned, I removed it from the pan and sauteed the onions in the new drippings. I also added about 2 tbsp of greek dressing that was leftover from a takeout meal. I had 1/2 a green bell pepper left in the fridge, so I chopped it up and threw half of them in at this point. After the onions and peppers were soft, I added 3 cloves of garlic, minced, and more of my "almost" greek seasoning mix. Then I added the beef back to the pan and poured in enough low sodium beef broth to just cover the beef (about 2 1/2 cups). After the hour and 15 minutes, I added the rest of the chopped green pepper and 1 1/2 cups sliced baby carrots along with the celery and two 10.5 oz bags of shredded cabbage. I needed a to add a little more liquid at this point, but didn't have anymore beef broth, so I used about 3/4 cup chicken stock because that's all I had on hand. Had to let it simmer for 45 minutes instead of 30 so the carrots could soften a little more. With the 8 oz can of tomato sauce, I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes wi

Great hearty soup - I did make a few changes. Based on reviews, I also used beef broth. I also used 16 oz of shredded cabbage (which happened to be cole slaw mix so a bit of carrot in it) to use the whole package, and a 16 oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes. I increased the Greek seasoning to 2 tsp and used additional broth (I think due to additional cabbage it needed extra broth which diluted the original seasoning measurement). I also cooked the celery and onion in the runoff from browning the beef and then added tomatoes and everything but cabbage in the beginning to allow the onions, tomatoes and seasonings time to combine flavors . I cooked on low simmer for an hour, then added cabbage. I cooked a little longer than instructed just because I had time which allowed broth to reduce and thicken a bit, which intensified flavor. A big hit - will make it again!

We live in a small town. Most of the time the price of steak is spendy. I used 1 Pound of 93%-7% lean burger instead of steak. Everything else it the same.

Turned out great!  I probably simmered it too high and lost too much broth, had to add some broth when I added the cabbage.  Still came out very good!  Just wish it didn’t take SO LONG to make!  But I will make it again

Great on a cold evening! I didn’t have Geek Seasoning in the house so I used Allrecipes recipe and made it.  Since I only had a 32oz container of chicken broth I used all of it and made a soup instead of a stew.  This was delicious!  Meat was little tough but that one is my bad, I used an oblong pan not a stock pot, didn’t simmer evenly so the meat wasn’t as tender as it should have been.  Flavor was great though!!

This made a fantastic stew.  I had to add a lot more water (and so also bouillon) than the 1.33 cups listed for 2 pounds of meat.  I ended up using 5 cups to barely cover everything.

This came out WAY better then I thought! My hubs and I are doing Phase 1 of the South Beach Diet and this was a GREAT dinner. I did add carrots and mushrooms only cause I wanted to use what I had left in addition to the ingredients listed. I also added a little more of the Greek seasoning because it's really good! Full of flavor and hearty!

I never much cared for cabbage.  But I have to admit, this was really good.  I cooked mine in an electric pressure cooker. One pot.  Browned meat in cooker pot, drained, returned meat and added everything else.  Set cooker on 30 min STEW function.  I didn't have builion cube so I used 8 ounces low sodium beef broth.  Put more cabbage in.  I used 2/3 head purple cabbage.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

I believe this is the best beef stew I have ever eaten! This recipe has replaced one that  have used for many years.  I did add a few sliced carrots,  a bit more cabbage,  and a 14-15 oz. can of both the tomato sauce and canned tomatoes, rather than the 8-oz. called for in the recipe.  But this recipe is wonderful just as written.  Even my son, who's not big on cooked veggies, eats 3 big servings. Don't think I'll ever need another recipe -- will use this one from now on.
