I love this recipe! This same recipe is in a magazine I received a few years back! Delicious! Instead of making the chocolate ganache, I made a cream cheese frosting and used this for my little girls birthday party. I had some trouble initially getting my top layer to be flush but after some strategic moving of some of the oreos in the filling, it looked great! I had all the moms and even a grandpa asking me for this recipe! 5 Stars!

Rave reviews from my guests! Made the cake from scratch. See extreme chocolate cake recipe on this site. Made a slightly different chocolate glaze. 2T melted butter, 2 squares unsweetened baking chocolate, 1 cup powder sugar, and 2T milk. Blend together and pour over the top of the cake. Refrigerate shortly to set the glaze. Filling as instructed. Amazing!

Loved this cake. Used my own chocolate cake recipe and smothered it with chocolate ganache (combination of chocolate and heavy whipping cream). I made the cream cheese mixture and let it set in a springform pan in the refrigerator while I baked the cake. This made it so much easier to stack the cakes.

I used the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe from this site for the cakes (it's a doctored devil's food)and mixed some crumbled oreos into the batter, used "Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting" instead of the cool whip filling, and used more like 30 crushed oreos in the filling. It looked just like the picture and was a huge hit.

My son wanted an "Oreo cake" for his 13th birthday, so I tried this one.  All 6 boys gave this 5 stars!  One of them even commented that it looked like I spent a lot of time on it.  (How nice!)  This looks & tastes so good, with not much more effort than just frosting.  I didn't use all the chocolate & even after letting it cool for 7 minutes, it was still too liquefied & drizzled down the edges of the cake.  No complaints, though.  Might only use 1/2 the suggested amount next time, which apparently will be very soon!  I'm also thinking about what other flavors of cake mix to use... maybe yellow?   Of course it wouldn't like an Oreo, but as long as it tastes good  : )

Used twice as many oreos in filling- be sure to break the cookies into pieces rather than crushing in a bag so the filling stays white in color.  Used chocolate brownie cake recipe from this site to doctor up the cake part- otherwise it would be pretty bland.  About 30 minutes in 350 oven for 2 9 inch round cake pans.  Don't overcook!  The ganache was simple and delicious (I used ghiradelli choc).  Because the cake was pretty thick next time I will spread the ganache as usual but then frost the entire cake with rich choc frosting from this site.  Worth making again with mentioned changes- not so sure it would be all that as stated

Everyone else in the family raved- but it was really sweet, needs more crushed Oreo and the chocolate on top was a bit thick. That said, it has been requested for three birthdays in a row...

I made this for a get together and it was very tasty...a little heavy, but good. Devil's food cake is a little dry for my husband and I so I used regular chocolate cake mix instead. The chocolate topping was good but next time I will make with milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.

Where did all the reviews for this go before 2012? This has been my DH's birthday cake since 2009. It's fantastic, I use less sugar in the filling as per my preference. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious, and easy to make (effort to reward ratio). I made it for a birthday party for a bunch of ten year old kids, and they all loved it.

I used the "Too Much Chocolate Cake" recipe for the cake as well as a whole package of Oreos and heavy whipping cream instead of Cool Whip for the filling. My daughter LOVED this as her birthday cake, and my family wouldn't stop raving about it, even though they are really not cake fans. I think I will be making this for more birthdays!

The cake broke into pieces when I was assembling it.  The inside frosting was good but I could still taste cream cheese and it tasted more like cookies' n cream flavor than the traditional Oreo filling.  The kids were not big fans of the cake.

super rich. my family loves it. i don't like using box cake mixes, so i followed another review and used dark chocolate cake II. i also doubled the number of oreos called for in the recipe. make sure not to pulverize them. you want big chunks.

Very easy and very yummy.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cake looks fantastic. The chocolate glaze is a little runny so let it sit and cool slightly before pouring over the cake.  Spoon it slowly as it will drip down the sides.  I always add a little instant coffee granules (1-2 tsp..dissolved in hot water) to any chocolate mix (cake or brownies). The coffee compliments the chocolate well and gives a box mix something extra.

My friend and I were bored one day so we found this recipe on this website. As we were making it, it looked perfectly fine. But when we started to put it together, there was too much cake! The oreo mix was very small, probably more than 1/2 the size of the picture. Unless you're a pro cook, I wouldn't make it.

New family favorite! Simplified by using ready made chocolate fudge icing (half of tub) and have used real whipping cream. Second time tried cutting the cakes horizontally for four layers and it looked fabulous! Third time made with gluten free mix and cookies for a party with a gluten free crowd that raved about it.   Just made today and created two layered Oreo cakes by cutting each round cake horizontally for two separate events. Love this dessert!

Delicious! Love this cake and it looks awesome. Really great for those who don't care for frosting. The hard chocolate shell is yummy and the filling is also so good. I prefer this type of filling over frosting any day.

I made this cake and it was easy to follow. I followed instructions for the glaze but it did not look anything like the picture. According to directions it is only chocolate and butter. No sugar.   It just ran off like water. Are instructions listed incorrectly?

This was a delicious , absolutely brilliant recipe! I love oreo cookies, my favorite. It was very simple to make. It was moist and flavorful and actually quite light. Not dense like some cakes can be. 
Fantastic. Will make it again!

I'm going to call the police because this should be illegal!!! This doesn't need any more reviews telling people it's amazing, but I wanted to add one quick thing-even though I'm sure others have mentioned it.

I didn't have the bar of sweet baker's chocolate, so I just melted nestle chocolate chips with a big spoonful of crisco in the microwave and just poured it over the top. I then stuck it in the fridge for about a half hour to set it.

SO GOOD.

It takes a couple times of making it to figure out the adjustments you want to make to get this the way you want it but it is fantastically decadent! I used a fudge cake mix that I liked more than the devil's food cake mix.
