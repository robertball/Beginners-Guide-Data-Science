I tasted the finished product (after exactly halving the recipe--even half egg white-- so I could write a valid review), and found a good foundation recipe. If the recipe was clear, it would rate four stars easily. To make things fit our family's tastes, I added 4 oz more cream cheese (we like a heavier cream cheese flavor over the sugar). The lemon flavor was faint, so I juiced one lemon and added it. I also added some lemon zest. It was perfect for us. I wanted to eat it with a giant spoon and ignore the fruit. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe receives a 5-star rating from the little girls who ate it all up!  They thought it was so very delicious!  Just follow the recipe because it works just like it is written up.   I made only a partial recipe, but I've been instructed to make more!  Thanks so much for making me look like a winner!

Added the zest of one orange. Yum!
