This review is for the meatballs portion of the recipe only: I made exactly as written except I subbed grd. Turkey for the pork.  These meatballs held up nicely!!!! I made them on the weekend and froze them raw.  Today, we popped them in the oven for an hour at 350 then, put them in the sauce to simmer for a while. I originally froze them to put in the crockpot to simmer all day but that plan was thwarted when we forgot to make that happen.  I used jarred sauce for ease but the sauce above looks great.  I've made the anyday potato ceaser salad form the Canadian dairy farmers and it was 5 stars too!

Bread crumbs all clumped together after being moistened with cream.  They also fell apart in the sauce.  I would cook them separate next time before adding to sauce.
