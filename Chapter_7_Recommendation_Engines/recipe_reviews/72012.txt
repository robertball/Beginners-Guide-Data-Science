Outstanding! I did not have onion soup mix, but using the general recipe, I added dried minced onion, garlic powder, sea salt and pepper. Good extra-virgin olive oil is important, too. My husband asked that we have this again, next week!

What I loved most about this recipe was that it was so quick and easy! I added garlic powder and some salt and pepper to the flour/onion soup mixture for flavor. They came out crispy on the outside (careful not to burn though!) and moist on the inside. Thanks for the idea!

I also tried this on chicken, very good...just had to cook it longer.

This was a good dish. In my experience, the onion soup mix and flour mixture didn't offer enough flavor. Once in the oil, it didn't really stick very well. I think I will try vegetable oil next time instead of olive oil. It didn't seem to cook quite hot enough. The meat was done no problem, but the cuts didn't get crispy at all and actually stayed a bit oily. I will try this again. Maybe it's me and not the recipe.

Thank you for this awesome, so easy to make recipe!  The ingredients listed coated 6 pork chops for me.  After I coated the chops, I lay them in a dish, covered with a plastic wrap and placed it in the fridge for an hour.  I also didn't do too good a job in crushing the big onion pieces in the packet, but that worked out well for me.  I opened up a canned chicken gravy. While that was heating up, I took the burnt onion pieces out of the oil and mixed it into the  gravy.  That added an extra punch to the gravy.  I served with Fried Rice and steamed broccoli.  Next time, I'll try to serve it with tomato and mango salad (diced tomatoes + chopped onion + diced mango + chopped cilantro + juice of lime).  
This will definitely be a part of the meal rotations list.

Good basic recipe, but I added bread crumbs for a little more crunch to the coating.  These were very tasty!

I was going to give this a low rating but my partner really liked it.  It was super easy to prepare, the meat was very moist - my complaint was that I knew I was tasting Lipton Onion Soup mix.  I make Lipton's Onion Dip all the time and love it but didn't appreciate that same flavor in the pork chops.  It reminded me so much of the dip that I ended up dipping my pork chops in sour cream!  So if you like Lipton Onion Soup mix - go for this recipe - it was liked by my guy so I will make it again when I need a quick recipe.  Thanks submitter.

This was a very quick and easy recipe.  I put the ingredients in a bag to coat evenly, then after cooking the chops I added water to the leftover onion and flour mixture, added that to the pan and heated to make an awesome gravy.  My picky daughter liked it.  Thanks for the recipe:)

I found this recipe enough for 5 - 6 pork chops. I used bone-in and they were delicious. My husband loved them. I would definately make these again.

Im not sure i can fairly rate this recipe. I failed to check the temp of the oil first. And therefore i had to cook them alot longer that stated in the recipe. The onion burned and it didnt taste very good at all. I might try again cause i love onion soup mix.

THIS IS A VERY GOOD RECIPE! GARLIC POWDER WORKS TOO IF YOU DONT HAVE ONION MIX. I MADE THIS FOR MY BOYFRIEND AND ALL HIS FRIENDS THEY LOVED IT. I WOULD DIP THE CHOPS IN EGG BEFORE THE FLOUR, THEY COME OUT CRISPY AND MUCH TASTIER I DECIDED THIS HALFWAY THROUGH COOKING THEM. EXAMPLE: THE CHOPS THAT HAD BEEN DIPPED IN EGG WERE ALL EATEN FIRST WHILE THE ONES THAT WEREN'T KINDA SAT THERE!

My family and I loved this recipe. Even my picky kids ate them! I had 4 medium boneless chops, so I doubled the flour, but still only used 1 envelope of onion soup mix. I also added a little garlic powder, and black pepper to the mix.

These were so simple to make. I had 6 bone in chops, so I used 2 packets of the lipton onion soup mix and 1/2 cup flour. I also seasoned the mixture with garlic powder, black pepper, and season salt. I dipped the chops in egg first then coated. Be sure to keep the pan on medium heat so that the onions do not burn. My came out delicious!

This was EXCELLENT!  I didn't have the dried soup mix on hand so I improvised by adding garlic salt and onion powder to the flour until I had a good flavor.  I am sure that if I use the dried soup mix, it will be equally great since we love that flavor.  So easy to do also!  THANK YOU!

This is simple and delicious, providing you add spice to your personal tastes.  I never follow a recipe to the letter because I know my family's desires.  So, I added some garlic powder, breadcrumbs, cayenne pepper to the existing ingredients and only used about 4-5 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to cook 4 sort of thin chops.  Wow, was this GREAT!  It's a nice way to keep the chops moist.  My (21-year-old) son carmelized some onions and we served some of that on top of each chop.  Excellent!  This will be a repeat dinner.  :)

This is a great way to change it up a bit. I have made them as directed and tonight ventured off on my own with this recipe...Oven baked. I sprayed my baking dish with cooking spray first and then sprayed the top of the chops before placing in a 425 degree oven for 20min. Everyone loves these chops. Thanks for the recipe

This is always one of my husbands favourite when it comes to pork chops. I did everything in the recipe, except for crushing the bits of onion. The pork chops come out juicy and full of flavour!

Great recipe!  I was worried that the flour and onion mix wouldn't be enough flavor, and that it wouldn't stick to my chops, so i tweaked this recipe by doing the following:

Pat the porkchops dry with paper towel

rub each side with clove of garlic cut in half

sprinkle each side with salt/pepper and rub in

drag through the flour/soup mix mixture and fry as directed

I should also mention I used veg oil instead of Olive.

I used thin sliced chops with Lipton's Herb and Garlic instead of Onion Soup mix.  Tasted good.  I fried each chop 1 minute, flipped and cooked another minute, and repeated this two more times (total cook time 4 minutes).  Toward the end I decided to just cook each side 2 minutes instead of flipping every other minute (bad idea....edges got too brown and curled up).  Will make again because it was very easy and my husband liked it.

Very good, quick and easy!  I don't care for pork chops and on the rare occasion I make them, I bake them.  Husband brought home some bone in chops today and I wanted to try something different.  These were so good - my picky kids ate them.  I made 10 pork chops, so I used 2 packets of dry onion soup and 1/2c flour.  Also used vegetable oil instead of olive and seasoned chops with pepper and garlic salt prior to putting in flour mixture.

This recipe was ok.....a little salty. I actually gave my boneless porkchops a quick dip in milk before coating in the onion/flour mix. This helped it stick alot better. I added garlic powder and black pepper. I also fried in canola oil because some reviewers were saying the olive oil didnt get hot enough. Afterwards i rested them on a paper towels to dry up any excess oil.

Yummy & easy recipe. I didn't deep fry, only used a couple tbsp of oil and pan fried - 4 minutes was a bit much, so I did about 3 and it came out great. Added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning because I love a lot of flavour. :) Served with onion sweet potatoes on this site.

Can I have an Amen on these truly Delicious pork chops!!?? They were moist for one thing and they practically made themselves they were so easy to fix.I didn't measure the flour, I just put some on a pie plate and add the onion soup mix after I crunched it up a bit,Perfect Perfect!! Thank You to Ms. PecanGirl for creating these Fab. chops!! My photo would have looked fine but Carli's is even better!

I added the 1/4 cup of bread crumbs as other suggested, and these pork chops ROCKED!  I did have to cook them for much longer than the recipe said.  I usually don't care for pork chops, but this recipe was great and I will definitely use it again.

Very good recipe.  I would give it 5 stars but I did modify it just a bit. Instead of frying the porkchops I baked them in a foil covered pan. I rubbed some oil at the bottom of my pan so the porkchops wouldn't stick. I also added some garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper to the chops before flouring them and added a bit of season bread crumbs to the flour mixture. Finally during the last 5 minutes I put some french onion potato chip  dip on the chops and added some half and half to create a bit of a gravy.

This recipe made my chops delicious. I mixed my onion soup mix with some flour and then fried them and they came out great. My kids really liked them. Next time I think I will add garlic powder to enhance the flavor. thank you!

quick and easy is what these should be named. Very good, family loved it. Thanks for adding this simple recipe! These are the kind I love. I was a little nervous it would be salty but they were perfect. I used 1/2 a package of the onion soup mix on 3 tiny pork chops. I only used 2 T of olive oil.

There was not much flavor but I still gave this recipe a 5 star rating because it provided a different and very enjoyable way to serve pork chops. I'm not a fan of pork but this recipe allowed the pork chops to remain moist. All this recipe possibly needs is some garlic powder and onion powder mixed in with the flour and soup mix. Thanks!

This recipe resulted in some very moist, tender and flavorful porkchops.  I did add some garlic, pepper and salt to taste.  Served with creamy mashed potatoes and cheesy broccoli.  Even my daughter, who 'hates porkchops', was caught grabbing a couple bites of these.

I was shocked at how much my fiance and I enjoyed these!  I was worried about it tasting too much like onion soup mix, but it didn't.  I had no problems with the batter sticking, either.  My fiance proclaimed this was a remake, so I'll be making it again!

This was so good!!  I was looking for something different to do with my pork chops and came across this.  It has such a different taste to it, not your normal pork chops and the whole family LOVED it.. including my 3 year old and 2 year old... Definitely going to make this again.  Thanks :)

Love having these recipes available for a quick meal.  This was really good.  I added a little more flour because I had 6 pork chops.  I thought I would not need any more salt because of the soup. I was wrong.   Needed more. I added it at the end of frying and also added garlic and pepper as suggested (minimal changes)  Delicious!  Thank you!

Made this for my boyfriend and I, we both loved it!  I added garlic salt, and it sounds odd, but a packet of ranch dressing mix.  I also fried it with onions and mushrooms for a topping when served.

This was great! Everyone loved it. I used bone in and sprinkled some salt over each side. I made four chops and there was still plenty of mix for more. It was a hit so I'll try it again.

I have been doing this same thing (exactly, right down to the olive oil) for years. It is SO good and it works great as a dredge for fried chicken as well (use vegetable oil for chicken instead of olive oil). I am making these tonight with some nice thin bone in chops. Can't wait!

I liked that these were very easy to make. I just thought the texture was a little different. Next time I try making them, I'll have to make sure to completely crush the onions.

We tried this, but my husband and I were not impressed. The onion soup made them VERY salty, it was too much. Next time I would cut down on the soup mix.

This was a pretty good recipe :) I added a little to it though to give the pork chops themselves more flavor, because if by chance the flour/onion soup mix comes off while frying, the chops would be left without much flavor. I rubbed them with some all- seasoning, cumin, and pepper. Before I dipped them in the flour mixture, I dipped them in a little eggwash so the flour mix will hold better...I also added some breadcrumbs to the flour mix (I know a previous commenter here said they did that so I decided to try)...It came out very moist inside, crispy outside, and very flavorful :)

These were very good. My husband, who doesn't like pork chops (I think I converted him.. they are my favorite), even liked them very much!

I absolutely loved this recipe...my 8-year-old picked all the breading off and ate it...I thought the breading was the best part.  I did substitute bread crumbs for the flour and added some garlic salt and garlic pepper.  I also dipped them in eggs before the dry ingredients.  Make sure you don't cook too high or you will burn them!

Mmmmmm!  Awesome!  This is fast, easy, delicious, and I had all the ingredients in my kitchen already.  I didn't need to make any changes, and they came out perfect and well-seasoned.  This is going to be a new stand-by.

Easy! Fast! Yummy! What more could I ask for?  Well, how about the fact that it is fool-proof? Now that I found this recipe I will never again have to eat pork chops with the consistency of shoe leather!

I made this one week night for dinner.  It was excellent!  
I was hesitant to use Lipton Onion Soup (MSG) but I did as well as I tweeked the recipe just a tad (not that it needed it), that is just me.  I added garlic powder, grated Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs to the flour/onion soup mixture and fried it as instructed, but on my side burner on my Gas Grill to alleviate the fried food smell inside.  It worked out great! My husband and I loved it.  And as the other reviews stated, nice and crisp outside and moist and juicy inside. No need for a steak sauce on the side. The next day I reheated one pork chop in the Microwave and it was just as good as the night before.  
I plan to use this recipe for Chicken Cutlets and Cubed Steak in the future.  It seems guilt free as you are using EVOO (olive oil) instead of the artery clogging vegetable oil.

Thank you MSPECANGIRL417 for the great recipe!!! :-) This one is now on a recipe card as well as in my favorites.

Another recipe that I make at least twice a month!  I add about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, but that's the only change I make.  These have a wonderful flavor!

These pork chops were really good! We used vegetable oil instead of olive oil and they turned out great! I recommend coating the pork chops in egg before coating them, the coating stays on much better when cooking them. Also, make sure you do not overcook them because the onion bits from the onion soup mix will burn. I will make these again!

Very good, my husband loved them. Used 1/4 cup of ital.bread crumbs mixed in the flour & soup mix. Put pepper & garlic salt on chops before frying. Nice flavor.  Had enough coating for 4 med. thick chops.

I had to sign up just so that I could write a review for this AWESOME recipe!  I added the 1/4 cup of dry breadcrumbs as suggested, as well as salt and pepper, and cut the onion soup down to 1/2 package.  I also added about a tablespoon of butter to the pan as the chops were cooking.  My husband says this is one of the best dishes I have ever made for him (and he likes ALL my cooking!)  It is so simple and so flavorful, and we'll definitely be cooking this again and again.  In fact, I'm going to premix a container of flour, onion soup mix, and breadcrumbs to have on hand. Thank you!!

We enjoyed this recipe, however I did add a few minor changes.  I added garlic salt and ground black pepper prior to frying. Also, I initially found the french union soup by itself to be a bit "much"...So I took about a cup or so of french fried durkees onions (crushed), mixed with about half the french onion soup.  DELICIOUS!  Tender--most and very flavorful.

This was a great recipe. I followed others advice and seasoned the chops before breading and added breadcrumbs to the flour/onion mixture.
Very tender and juicy on the inside while keeping the outside nice and crispy.

I really liked this idea! I used half bread crumbs and half flour, and ground black pepper in addition to the onion soup  mix. I also coated the chops in a beaten egg and buttermilk mixture to make more of a breading. The chops were moist and tender, and very flavorful. My husband hates pork chops but asked for seconds this time!

I coated the chops w/flour seasoned w/garlic salt, & pepper. Seared them in a pan w/about 2 TBSP oil, about 3 minutes on each side. Spray the crock pot w/Pam cooking spray, add chops, onion soup mix, I cooked this in the crock pot on low for 8 hrs & it was great & really tender!! About 15 minutes before done, I preheated oven to 325, place chops on a platter & cover w/aluminum foil, put in preheated oven while making gravy.. Pour liquid into a sauce pan (only because I can't be bothered waiting for the crock pot to heat up to make gravy) Mix about a cup of milk & 1/2 cup flour w/a wisk (don't want lumps),gradually add to liquid WITH A WISK stirring constantly until desired thickness (will thicken as gravy cools.) Can be served over rice or noodles, serve w/fresh salad & rolls.

Like other reviewers stated, this recipe was fantastic!  I was also surprised b/c it was SO simple....only thing I did differently was to sprinkle chops w/ poultry seasoning before dredging in flour mixture...next time I make them, (& there WILL be a next time!), I'll try some cayenne w/ the seasoning...thanks for a great recipe!

Delicious! Since I have Celiac, I used gluten free all-purpose flour. I also coated the chops in unseasoned flour, then in egg, then in the seasoned flour. Even my picky eater enjoyed them.

This recipe was quick and delicious.  I had only read a couple of the reviews so I didn't realize that the onion mixture would make more than 2 pork chops so I added 6 buttery round crackers to stretch the mixtures.  I will make this again with the crackers as it was wonderful.  My husband doesn't care for breaded, fried pork chops but went back for a second on these.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Simple and fast!

I did not follow the recipe as stated but adapted it using other spices since I didn't have the onion soup mix.  I also added whole wheat panko breading for more crunch as another reader had suggested.  I found this to be fairly good, easy, and would make it again.

Excellent!  I did add garlic powder, salt, pepper and a little bit of bread crumbs, also I dipped in an egg before breading.  Just make sure your oil is really hot...oh and I used veg oil instead of olive...my husband LOVES them!

I made this the other night and the whole family loved them! I tweaked a little. Make sure that you season your flour or even better yet, what I used was a "southern fry" mix (all sorts of brands make it and it's seasoned allready). I was using rather thick pork chops. I dipped them in egg then the onion soup/flour mix - back in egg and did it again. I fried them for a few minutes on each side till a nice golden brown then stuck them in a pre-heated over on 375 for a few more minutes until the meat thermometer read 160. (use a broiler pan so you keep crisp bottoms too). This let the grease drain and really crisped up the coating. DELICIOUS!!!

This was easy and my husband and I both loved it. I didn't have onion soup so I used a dry onion-mushroom soup and I added some garlic powder! Yum!

My family LOVED these pork chops. This is so easy and good. I have never written a review before, but for this I had to. I did dip my chops in egg and milk first. I also took others advice and added a small handful fo Italian bread crumbs and a dash of garlic powder to the mix. Once again Really good.

This was great!  I did add a little more flour the second time I made them so they wouldn't be quite so salty.  They do come out very tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Great recipe!

GOOD EASY RECIPE. I ADDED FLOUR TO THE CRACKER AND ONION SOUP MIX, AND DIPPED THE CHOPS IN EGG BEFORE THE BATTER. THE FAMILY LOVED IT. MY 5 YEAR OLD SON WANTED IT THE NEXT NIGHT.

I added 1/4 c. breadcrumbs as mentioned in other reviews and made sure I seasoned the chops with kosher salt and pepper before breading. They were excellent! The onion flavoring in the pan with drippings made great gravy!

I gave 5 stars for the potential.  I made it pretty much as is from the recipe, and found it lacking in spicy flavor.  Next time I will season the chops with salt and pepper or seasoning salt before I coat them in the flour mixture.  I'd also love to try bread crumbs for more crunch texture.  The chops were very moist and wonderful.

large pork steaks.  I used half of the onion soup and added garlic.  My son gave it 10 stars.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Very good! Simple, easy, AND I made a gravy with the drippings by adding a bit of flour and 1/2 -n- 1/2 or, whole milk.  Hubby and Father In Law liked it!  Will make again, thanks for the recipe!

Definitely add the 1/4 cup bread crumbs as suggested by others, it will make the onion soup less overpowering.  I've made them twice & find I have enough coating for 4 pork chops.  If you can find Golden Onion soup mix, I think that would work better, but I usually have a hard time finding it.

My 4 year old daughter gave this recipe a high compliment (for a little girl, that is!).  She said, "Mommy...this is better than chicken nuggets!".  I added breadcrumbs as suggested by other reviews.  This was very tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent, simple pork chop recipe. My whole family loved them and we will be adding them to the regular meal list. I added italian bread crumbs and some black pepper to the onion-mix/flour mixture and this came out delicious and moist.

Pork chops like I've never had before.  Very tasty, definitely new twist. In additiion, I added some flavor breadcrumbs to breakdown the oniony taste a bit and it was still good. My guest enjoyed them.

Very good, very fast, very easy! I used less flour and added garlic powder and cayenne pepper. I had to cook mine longer than the recipe called for.  Will make again!

I will definitely make this recipe again.  Boyfriend isn't much on fried pork chops said hes only had fried pork chops that he actually enjoyed one other time this is the second recipe I've used for fried pork chops and he's loved both of them.

This was easy and quick.  Both the husband and our 6 year old son reached for seconds.  I served it with shredded zucchini and butternut squash, salt and lemon pepper to taste.  I put 2tbls of butter in a pan on medium low heat and steamed it for 4-6 minutes.

Disappointed. Way too salty for our taste and soup/flour coating came off in chunks while cooking. Will not be making this again.

This was good. Not great. I feel it lacked flavor. Everyone did like how the chips got crispy with it. Next time I may add to it to get more flavor. It’s a good start.

Super easy! 
 I made these for my husband and he loved them! I cooked mine only 3 minutes per side and they were tender. I think 2 1/2 will work best next time. Mine were about 3/4" thick. I'm not a fan of pork being cooked this way, I prefer tenderloin, but these are good as long as you do not overcook them, then they get chewy.

I’m not very familiar with pan frying like this recipe calls for, and my pork chops were very thick so I had to cook them longer than the recipe says. I didn’t want them to burn so I finished them in the microwave.  I had 4 pretty big pork chops so I added more flour as well as adding onion powder and garlic powder. I dipped the pork chops in milk first, as another reviewer recommended.  Afterwards I used the remaining milk and the flour mixture to make a gravy (plus more milk and onion and garlic powders and pepper.

I'll have to admit, I didn't follow this to a "tee"; but the changes I did do wouldn't change the taste. The only thing I did different was "double dip"(flour mixture, egg, flour mixture). I thought this easy recipe tasted great! Yes the onions in the soup mix did burn, but that didn't over power the flavor of the soup mix. At least not to me. BTW, I use chops that I cut up, in slices from a pork loin; about an inch thick.

Made it and the entire family loved It! I forgot to add the flour so it made the onion flavor stronger. It was a little too salty though, therefore, I think I'm going to get the low sodium next time. I am definitely going to make this again.... yum!

Yummy! Used one packet for 4 pork chops and as someone suggested, added garlic, pepper and kosher salt to it. For the leftover  onion soup, I  borrowed another reviewer's idea of mixing it in cold water and adding it to the saucepan and simmering it to make the gravy. Definitely will make again. Thanks!

I made this for the family and it made the chops nice and moist.  Just make sure that you really crush the onions because they tend to burn.

Very good and easy!  I dipped the chops in milk to help the coating stick. Also added 1/8 C bread crumbs, 1/8 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic salt and 1/4 tsp seasoned salt to flour-onion soup mixture.  Came out so moist and juicy!  Definitely a keeper!

Great as directed.  Cooked on medium high heat (6) for 5 min on each side.  Half EVOO and half veg oil.  So yum!  Ate with a side of rice and steamed broccoli!  Great for a quick dinner night.

I did a batch of 8 boneless pork chops and two packages of the onion soup mix and left out the flour.  Cooked in a large electric fry pan with cover and it was delicious.  Maybe a little salty for some.  Next time I think I will pan fry some onions first and then add the pork chops.

5 stars for ease AND taste. Everyone loved them made this way. I've made them three times and they've been a hit each time. I love how easy they are. I've not altered the recipe one bit.

This was okay. It tasted like onion soup.  It's a different twist on sautéed pork chops but I probably won't make this again.

I made this exactly as written, and it was just okay, to me - nothing fantastic, nothing awful. I used boneless top loin pork chops for this. I will note that I thought the coating mixture would probably suffice for 3, if not 4 chops - I was pretty generous with it, and there was a good amount left over after coating 2 chops. All in all, a decent quick dish.

I added the onion soup mix to some seasoned bread crumbs (instead of flour) and coated the chops before frying.  Once everything was removed, I added the remainder of the breadcrumbs and soup mix combo to the pan, plus 2 cups of beef boullion. Stir to mix, then let it boil down a bit and you have a nice pan gravy.

I used vegetable oil (less than what was called for) and added Montreal Steak Seasoning + garlic powder to the dry ingredients.  Excellent, and so easy, too.  Thanks.

Great Recipe. Used milk to help the soup/flour mixture stick to the chops. It was great. Husband says I'm not allowed to make pork chops any other way now. Thank you.

This recipe has pretty much changed my life!  I didn't have enough of the onion soup mix to make the amount I wanted, so I added it to a flour/bread crumbs mixture.  I also soaked the pork in a buttermilk egg mixture prior to starting.  The onion soup mix gives the perfect crunch and taste.  It was delicious!

I loved this and the husband LOVED this! I followed the recipe exactly. It was perfect. I also sliced an onion and cooked them in the oil after the porkchops were done. I piled the onions on top of the chops when serving. So good and SO easy!

Deeeelissssshhhhh!  I have never pan fried pork chops before.  These were crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  I had 3 large chops, so for the coating I used 1 envelope of the onion soup mix, 1/4 cup of flour and 1/4 cup of bread crumbs.  I also seasoned the flour mixture with garlic powder and pepper.  I coated with egg before dredging and then put them in the fridge for about an hour before frying them up.  I used vegetable oil for frying, flipping every minute for a total of 8 minutes.  Unbelievably good!

This was so easy.  I had a 1/2 package of soup mix left from awhile ago, so I decided to use that along with panko bread crumbs.  I used about 1/2 -3/4 cup of bread crumbs.  It was tasty and not too oniony.  I let the breaded chops sit in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to help keep the breading on the chops while frying.

yummy! I used canola oil instead and cooked each side until browned on medium heat about 7 minutes. I then covered and cooked on low for another 5 minutes on each side. So tender and juicy!!!!

This was quick and easy and very good too! I followed directions as written. Used Olive Oil as it does not smoke at higher heat. Worked perfectly. Had no problem with onion soup/flour mixture adhering to the chops. Just added some garlic & onion powder and pepper and I did cook the chops for about 20 minutes, flipping every 3 or 4 minutes. These were great! Thanks for the recipe OP!

I was looking for a quick and easy recipe.... that's the best thing I can say about this one. It is quick and easy. 

I made it as prescribed. 
With lunches in mind, I made 3 boneless center cut pork chops. 
I forced myself to eat one. . 
We all like different things I guess.

Quick, easy, & delicious! I made a simple pan gravy with the left-over soup-flour mixture and the dish was outstanding. My husband raved over it, particularly how juicy the chops were, and he went nuts over the gravy! The dish also went over well with my toddler, so this will definitely be part of our regular recipe rotation now. I plan on trying it with chicken breasts as well.

A pretty solid recipe, but it could use a bit more flavor. Next time I'll marinate the pork very briefly in malt or cider vinegar and add some black pepper.

I followed the receipe exactly (except I used veggie oil, I didn't have olive oil). This was so moist and flavorful. I'm not a pork person but I loved these! The bf loved it and that was very important to me. He said it was the best meal he ever had :-)

I made some changes based on other reviews.  I 1) seasoned chops w/ a little salt, garlic powder, lemon pepper  and a little Worcestershire sauce.  Let it stay for about 45 minutes.  2) I added 1/2 Cup of Italian bread crumbs and increased the flour also to 1/2 Cup.  It turned out very good.

Really better if you add some bread crumbs for crusty texture! Scaled way back on the olive oil and still came out pretty tasty...will try again!

WOW!  These were great! So easy and very moist and flavorful.  I added breadcrumbs as well to give it a little bit more of a crust and it was perfect.

yumm..these were good. i mixed the lipton golden onion mix with bread crumbs like suggested and they came out so tasty. if your familiar with these onion mixes and dont care for them then dont bother. the flavor was strong. but we liked it very much.
