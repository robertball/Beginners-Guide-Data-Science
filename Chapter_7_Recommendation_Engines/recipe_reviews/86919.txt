My boyfriend and I love this recipe. We added black olives and left out the avocado, only because we did not have one. We used turkey bacon too and it was fabulous. My 5 year old loves is also a fan!!! Great recipe Sarah.

I was loving the idea of this salad.  It wasn't as good as I had hoped though.

I followed the recipe exactly... and it was just off.  My husband and I even tried it the next day with more dressing... no go.  Just no flavor. Very dry.

So easy, and pretty good.  You could easily add lettuce (or basil--one of my favorite herbs!) and make this into a BLT pasta salad.  I'd serve this immediately unless you want to keep adding ranch dressing--I made it a few hours ahead of time, and when we were ready to eat it was pretty dry so I added more ranch dressing.  It is a bit bland--bf and I were adding salt and pepper at the table.  He does that a lot but I generally dont, so I'd add salt and pepper prior to serving next time.  Chives or green onions might be nice in this too.  thanks for the recipe!
