Love, love, love this! As did the family at Christmas. I used the given cupcake recipe and pattern. I skipped the filling and used my own frosting and flavors based on my family’s tastes. 
The cupcakes were awesome! Easily one  the best from scratch chocolate cupcake recipes. The Yukon pattern and directions were easy to follow, though I decided to switch up the styling. Next time, I will follow the author’s frosting style because it’s adorable! 
Because I was traveling pretty far with this, I used royal icing to glue the cupcakes to the cake board. A half-sheet cake board worked perfectly, as did the half-sheet box.
