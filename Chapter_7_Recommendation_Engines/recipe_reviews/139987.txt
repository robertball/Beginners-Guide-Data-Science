Thanks for reminding me of the basic proportions of butter, flour, and milk.  Can be seasoned 1000 ways to serve as a base for zillions of dishes.  I use it instead of condensed cream of mushroom soup to bind casseroles when I don't want the mushroom taste.  With a little nutmeg it is the "creamed" part of creamed spinach.  It surrounds the main ingredients in chicken pot pie.  It isn't much by itself--its glory is what you can do with it and the rich, comforting texture it gives to a dish, especially casseroles.  I looked up the recipe for something to use to bind a salmon casserole, and of course I will add minced onion and seafood-friendly seasonings like Worcestershire to it.  If it is too thin for your purpose, simply turn the heat down as low as possible (or put it in the top of a double boiler) and continue cooking and stirring until it thickens more, and/or add grated cheese.    For the guy who found it didn't work for pastitsio, that is because the sauce traditionally used for that dish is not actually bechamel, but more of an unsweetened, soft egg & cheese custard.  Unfortunately many recipes for moussaka and pastitsio incorrectly refer to the topping as bechamel simply because some flour is used in thickening the milk base (as is done in bechamel) before the egg and cheese are added.

I was comparing Bechamel Sauce Recipes and this is similar to the one I found on Food Network by Mario Batali which I've made before with the exception of an increase in the nutmeg by 1/4 tsp.  This recipe is fabulous and I have added a splash of white wine as I used the sauce for Spinach Lasagna.  Decreased the salt to 1 tsp. due to the parm and romano I used with the Ricotta in the filling. Wow and Excellent!!

This turned out perfectly but you have to be patient and cook it the recommended time. Next time, I might put in a little less salt.

Excellent instruction for those new to this kind of home made sauce base and the taste of this recipe is very good while also easy to spice in different ways.  However, still like our family recipe a bit better.  I puree a sweet onion until it's literally pulped, then saute the onion in a bit of butter and olive oil or coconut oil (the oil keeps the butter from burning).  After the onion has cooked down and out for a good five minutes or so, we add the nutmeg.  We put nutmeg is almost everything and the 1/4 tsp called for here is a good amount.  Also helps the "onion" flavor to mellow for those who aren't fond of onion (like my boyfriend before I started cooking for him; I began pureeing the onion simply because he does not like the texture of onion and thought he didn't like the taste - now he knows better).  After the onion is pureed we add the amount of butter called for in this recipe, or thereabouts, and begin incorporating the flour straight into the onion, all the while mixing and mashing like it up together.  The flour and onion mixture will begin to smell a bit nutty and turn slightly golden - this is what ya want.  Then whisk in your milk or cream and there ya have it.  Excellent rendition of this simple bechamel sauce with a bit more panache.

This turned out wonderful. Simple recipe and great results! I made it for a party of 2 with only one cup of milk and it thickened faster than I expected. Really watch it on the stove if you make a smaller portion. Seemed much faster than 20 minutes to thicken.

Wow, this is great. This is what I expect from a bechamel sauce recipe!  I think the user who thought it was too water maybe didn't give it time to thicken up, because mine was perfect!

I thought this was a great recipe! I have made many attempts at making white sauce and this so far has been the best. The only thing I did was add 1/2 an Onion to it during the simmering part. It absorbs alot of the onion flavor. Then I removed it. Thanks for a good recipe.

This was a cinch to make.  I stirred in fresh basil and grated parmesan to the sauce after cooking (did not add salt due to the parmesan and omitted the nutmeg).  Tossed it with gnocci pasta, chopped ham and peas.  My family loved it.  Thanks!!

I wasn't paying attention and it boiled over once. Otherwise, I followed the directions exactly (except that I only made 2 servings-which was more than enough for 2 people). I also added some grated Parmesan cheese and a dash of garlic powder. My husband (the more advanced cook) said it turned out better than his sauces.

This recipe was great for lasagne.  I thought it was helpful in explaining how to actually prepare the sauce.  Easy, but does take some time.  Well worth the effort!

This is a good basic recipe.  Take your time making it.  Rushing it ruins it.  So does the salt!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and what a mistake!!! Do NOT...do NOT....use 2 teaspoons of salt!!  One is plenty.  Also, if you aren't too fond of nutmeg, add maybe 1/8tsp.  The 1/4 was fine for me.   Used this to put over shrimp and crab omelet for a special brunch.  Just tell everyone not to salt anything if you are going to use the sauce.  ( after finishing it, I added some swiss cheese and a pinch of dill to complement my seafood omelete.  it was pretty good).  Would definitely use this same recipe again.....minus all the salt!

Easy, common ingredients (no rush to the store for that strange thing you'll never need again).  I used this in a vegetable lasagna, worked great.

This bechamel recipe was easy enough and worked well for what I needed it for, BUT I found 2 tsps to be too much salt.  I think 1 maybe 1 1/2 would have been just right.  Just goes to show, ALWAYS taste before salting.

Excellent and easy.  I used this to teach my Home Ec class, reworking the quantities for 16 servings and it turned out fabulously - they even ran through a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors to see who would get to "lick the pot" LOL.  A perfect beginner's sauce.

I believe i am reaching an age of incompetence when it comes to tech stuff as trying to figure out how to alter my recipe and cant so here is a side note for this recipe... When using Salt I did not use table salt hence why so many upset over the saltiness.... trust me i am not looking to turn you guys in preserved fish.... Always add to taste and adjust for different salt variety.  For the watery part all I can imagine is you need to make a good Roux before adding liquid and let it cook at proper temperature since if one really wanted could make this as thick as block of butter if determined too... And finally yes this is only a foot in a door to many other variations to recipes add or take away as much as you want personally I always add a "onion cloute" basically a halved onion spiked with whole cloves. but to each their own. thank you very much for the positive reviews on it. Hopefully it entices people to do more home cooking then K.D. cooking  :-)

Sincerely Matt,

This was what I used tonight to prepare lasagna. The bechamel turned out absolutely lovely,smooth,thick and creamy. Because bechamel is a delicately flavored sauce I needed to heighten the flavor for use in such a robust dish as a lasagna. Another reviewer JodieNMain advised sauteeing a pureed sweet onion down and adding a generous 1/4 tsp nutmeg before adding the flour so that's what I did and the result was delightsome!

I have been making Bechamel Sauce for years for Greek dishes like Mousaka and Pastitsio and always add an egg yolk or two, beaten with the milk as this makes a thicker and richer tasting Bechamel... And for extra flavor try grating a small amount of Parmesan Cheese into the sauce...

Above is the basic recipe, but for the two of us I used 1/4 cup butter, 3 tbsp. flour, 1 small onion studded with 2 cloves (or use 1/8 tsp. onion powder and 2 cloves,) dash dried thyme, salt & white pepper to taste, nutmeg to taste.  Make basic white sauce with these ingredients, remove onion & cloves after thick, about 15 min.  This is delicious with the addition of chunked leftover chicken or salmon and served over spinach pasta.   FLB

Easy, easy; just remember to whisk well and often.  I only added a pinch of salt instead of 2 teaspoons, but otherwise a great recipe.  Threw in a handful of grated hot pepper jack after I took it off the heat - my husband ate the leftover sauce and licked the pan!  Definitely making this again.

I gave this recipe four stars because it was good, with HALF the salt. If I had put in the full amount of salt, it would have been awful. I used it for traditional Manicotti and it went over great!

Great recipe, but found that from previous posts to be patient with it, but if you are too patient it tends to get too thick :) It would have been done from bubbling for few minutes then simmer. I also tried with whole wheat flour, it was alright but I am sure would have tasted better with white.

Does this only work with whole milk? I used reduced fat milk and whipped butter and made 1/2 recipe. It never really thickened up. What made matters worse is it tasted like a mouth full of salt. I can't believe I actually put the full tsp of salt in this. Strange, as I was making this to doctor up potatoes that didn't turn out. Guess, I need to stay out of the kitchen today. :-(

Very good!  I recommend cutting back the salt, especially if using a salty cheese to make cheese sauce, but otherwise simple and very good!

This makes a great basic sauce. I used it over buttered thin spaghetti. I didn't need that much so I used 2 tbls butter 2 tbls flour and 1 1/2 cups milk. The cooking directions are prefect, but I did warm my milk up in a saucepan while the butter was melting.

I had to use an electric range and cut the heat back for the first 10 mins to about 3-4 out of 10 and about 6-7 for the next 15 minutes. I cut back on the salt because I was putting into a white, 4-cheese lasagna with Romano cheese.   The sauce was perfect for my application. Thanks.

What a lovely sauce! Perfect over the spinach and prociutto tortellini I had on hand. I messed up slightly by adding all the milk all at once, which made the cooking process much longer, but it did thicken eventually. I had no nutmeg on hand, but I added some shaved gruyere and loved the result.

Perfect bechemel; it’s a great base that can go in many directions. I made a large batch and used with various modifications in multiple meals (poached eggs and polenta topped with bechemel; then added garlic, onion and shallot and used as a white pizza sauce; added parm, garlic and a ton of white pepper to make a pasta sauce to go with a pancetta, onion, pea, zucchini pasta). It’s basic and flexible, and this recipe is exactly what a good bechemel should be.

I have a  gas stove so I turned the heat down more when melting the butter and added a half cup of flour total to balance out the quart of milk. Once the quart was added it was thinking so I turned the heat up to medium high & it finally thickened up nicely.  A good recipe that I will go back to.  Don't be intimidated by the name, it's the same type of base you make for cream chip beef or sausage gravy but omitting the meat.

OMG!! The salt level was through the roof! Other than that it is a great quick Bechamel Sauce. I only looked up the recipe bc it has been so long since I made it and I thought the recipe I remembered had to much sauce, so I tried this one. Could be my taste buds, but Wow so salty

Great if you're patient.   But I used only 1/4 tsp of salt and I would reduce that too.  Pros manly just a big pinch next time.

For those that found it to be too much salt..the type of salt used can make a difference.  Not sure what kind the recipe intended, but if using regular table salt, it takes much less than if using kosher salt.

I thought this was an excellent recipe. I used to be able to make Bechamel without even thinking about it, but too many years out of practice and I needed a bit of reminding on proportions. Made the perfect Croque Monsieur. To person who thought it was "too watery," I'd have to ask if you cooked it long enough. You do need to stick to the times given or perhaps adjust your cooking temperature.

I couldn't believe how simple it was to make this sauce! First time I had ever tried and it turned out perfect. However, I can't say I'm a nutmeg fan so next time I'll either put in much less or omit it altogether.

Made this to moisten up some chicken drumstick baby food I was making.   It came out creamy and delicious, and my little one loved it.

Although this was my first time using this recipe, I made three changes.  1. I reduced the amount of milk from 1 qt to starting with 3/4 cup, allowing some time to sit and thicken, then added another 1/4 c (whisking to mix well both times).  2. I also used whole milk not half/half.  3.  I added 2 to 3 oz of Cream Cheese - allowing it to melt slowly and whisking  periodically to avoid sticking & ensure there were no lumps. Balance of recipe and cooking instructions were kept the same.  I recommend and will make again.  (Due to spur of the moment dinner choice, I had to utilize what I had in my pantry.  Thus, I used elbow macaroni.   Although a very good substitute choice, I'm going to try the egg noodles or linguine next time.  Good Luck

Wonderful basic bechamel sauce! Before going gluten free, my rule for making this type of sauce was 1 tbsp flour for every tbsp butter.  To make it gluten free, I used Better Batter all purpose flour blend and had to add a little more (about 1/8 of a cup more). The end result was a very nice and creamy sauce. Will use this as a base for future bechamel sauces! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made this recipe to use in 'Creamy Potato Lasagna' from AR, rather than using jarred Alfredo sauce.  It worked great, and I would do so again. Patience is the key to this recipe, cook it too fast or too high of temperature and you will have a scorched pan.  You can add cheese to the finished sauce and get a nice cheesy sauce for veggies or to use in another recipe.  This is a great recipe to have in my recipe box.

The reviewer who lowered the amount of milk to a cup for serving 2 people needs to lower other ingredients as well.  If you start with equal amounts of flour and butter, you will be fine, increasing it or decreasing it, then just add milk as it cooks to the consistancy you want.  This is a basic quart recipe----and works well for MANY things!!  I like to add cheeses---parmesan and use it in lasagna.

I made this for myself and it was absolutely great! i had plain cooked spaghetti, and needed a sauce with it, and i tried since it was absolutely easy, and i tasted it, and i was so delicious. I think it may just need more than just salt for taste, like black pepper, but still magnificent recipe, and will be adding other flavors next time. Thanks

Wonderful! This is only the second time I have ever made bechamel but this one is getting bookmarked for keeps. 

I will echo previous posters who say cut the simmer time when making smaller amounts. I only made 4 servings and 10 minutes was definitely all it needed. I let it go longer and the sauce was a bit too thick for my purposes, but the meal came out delicious anyway!
