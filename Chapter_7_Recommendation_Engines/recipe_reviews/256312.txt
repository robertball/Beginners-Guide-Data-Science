Love this recipe!  A friend of mine shared raise we are both on weight watchers and recipe has zero pts (if you omit the oil). I had some left over corn on the cob, and made a few changes to suit our tastes... added sweet vadallia onions slivers, used fresh diced tomatoes and layer on top of a bed of lettuce. Not only delicious, itâ€™s a beautiful meal too!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

It is very good but I only had a lemon and by using lemon it made it sour but i fixed it with a pinch of sugar, don't use lemon use lime as it says,  I will have to make it again and then  possibly do a different ratting, the only thing I changed was I added some red onion along with the green onion and some orange pepper, it was very good !
