This is the same filling I've used for about a year for making strawberry pie (the sugar, cornstarch, water, and jello).  However, the amounts listed are what I use to make ONE pie!  I have no idea how this amount of filling would cover enough strawberries for 2 pies.  Also, my recipe calls for cold water (when mixing it with the jello, cornstarch, and sugar), bringing it all to a boil and boiling it for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  I've never had one turn out soupy or rubbery.

this pie is amazing!  i have a great idea for DIABETICS. my grandpa is diabetic so i used sugar free jello mix and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, it turned out wonderful.  my mom (who watches her weight) took a piece because it was so low in calories.  even my picky brother gobbled it down.  it goes great with a shortbread pie crust.  thank you so much janice!

Definitely only enough for one pie! I thought this was absolutely delicious... with a few adjustments :) I followed the advice of others and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and sliced my strawberries (they were from the farmer's market, so they were different sizes). I also added a lemony cream cheese layer on the bottom which was a fantastic counterpoint to the sweetness. One more thing- homemade crust and real whipped cream are an absolute MUST with this recipe. Store bought crust and Cool Whip just won't cut it... Everyone was absolutely raving and wanted the recipe immediately!

Out of the strawberry pies I've made which called for Jello, this one is the best. Double up on the strawberry gel if you are making two pies.

This pie turned out wonderful, with the following changes to the recipe: I used a baked graham cracker crust, cut the sugar down to 1/3 c. and used all the filling/glaze for one pie. Very fresh finish to dinner!

This is good.  I thought I had completely screwed it up, as the glaze mix quickened very quickly (came to a boil very fast and I didn;t mean for it to) but then was runny after I added the jello. So I heated it back up again to thicken it. Heating it the second time seemed to help it set quickly; it seemed to be setting as it cooled so I just poured it over the strawberries and refrigerated. It was very set and I had no problems with it not gelling. I did as some reviewers suggested and doubled the sauce. Not sure if I like it that way; it did almost overflow the pan. Very good, and everyone at the bbq I went to tonight liked it.

So simple, yet this pie has such an amazing flavor.  For pies, I use the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust," also found on the Allrecipes Website.  The crust is just exceptional with this pie.  Yes, as other reviewers pointed out, the filling does become slightly rubbery in the second day - but it would take more than a little consistency change to keep me from eating it.  If you love strawberries, try this recipe - you won't regret it.  It rocks!

Addendum: It's been three years since I last prepared this.  I don't remember not having enough glaze the first time, but when preparing two pies--ABSOLUTELY double the glaze.

This was a great recipe! I did slice up the berries and I used a ready made shortbread crust. I also used raspberry jello to make the pie a deeper red color. This recipe is a keeper!

Absolutely fabulous. I made one large pie instead of 2 pies and the glaze was just enough. I thought the glaze would be too sweet but it turned out just perfect. My boyfriend and his parents were pleasantly surprised since they don't usually like sugary sweet desserts. This doesn't keep too well. The only comment my boyfriend made was to put more graham cracker crust. Next time, I will make this into individual cake cups and serve it that way.

This was a very good pie.  I made a shortbread crust and used all of the glaze on one pie.  However, this pie does not keep well.  Plan to use all of it at once as the glaze becomes VERY rubbery by the following day.

This is the same recipe my mother in law gave to me 35 yrs. ago. I had to go looking for a recipe for my daughter in law this year. 
I combine the ingredients a little differently though. I mix the jello, cornstarch and sugar in the pan and add cold water. I stir it until the corn starch is desolved. I bring it to a boil and allow it to boil for 3 about minutes or until it's clear.  After it's cooled I pour 1/2 of it into a bowl of berries. I pour that into my pie shell and then pour the remaining  glaze over the entire thing.
I've given this recipe away so many times and I'm still approached evrery year to make pies for people.
I've always used the standard Crisco pie crust but my daughter in law wanted to try somethng different so she's using the "French pastry pie crust"
To be continued...

Delicious but you MUST DOUBLE THE SAUCE! This is a fabulous recipe but the sauce is only enough for one pie so make sure you double it. Here are a few tips for the recipe. 1. Make sure that you follow the instructions for baking the pie crust and let it cool completely. 2. I like to cut my strawberrys into halfs and quarters so that the pie shell is stuffed with strawberrys. Also make sure that all of the strawberrys on top are face up for a nice presentation. 3. This is the most important -  you must let the sauce cool completely before pouring on the pie - otherwise you cook the strawberrys. So, I try to stir out the steam and then I put the pan in the fridge and stir every 5-10 minutes until it is almost starting to gel. Then I put it on the pie. Also, you need to allow the pie to be in the fridge AT LEAST 5 hours before serving so the sauce can gel. Serve with cool whip and enjoy!

I couldn't find my similar version of this recipe until after I had made this one. The rubbery texture may be due to the amount of cornstarch/gelatin, as the recipe I always use calls for 1 Tbsp. cornstarch and 3 Tbsp. strawberry gelatin, not the entire box. It also states to cook over med. heat until clear, 2-3 min. I always get a scrumptious pie that doesn't last more than a day or so this way.

If I could give this recipe more stars, I would.  I grew up in Ohio where we ate fresh strawberries in everything from hoememade jam to pies.  This recipe is Authentic, just as I remember enjoying soo much as a child.  Ive made it several times without fail, and am asked by my parents to make it everytime I see them.  If you are looking for a strawberry pie recipe, THIS IS THE ONE!  Try the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe found on this site for the perfect crust.  Chill completely, top with whipped cream, and fall in Strawberry Love.

My husband rated this 10 stars!  Very good recipe.  I did only use 1/2 Cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet for us.  (I don't like super sweet)  Very very easy.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a great recipe and SO EASY!  I made no alterations.  I cut the stems of the strawberries, turned them upside down (points up) and drizzled the sugar/gelatin glaze directly over the strawberries for the TWO pies as recipe suggested.  It turned out perfect.  I noticed other reviewers added all glaze to one pie and I could see how that would not turn out well.  The glaze is a gummy texture and works well when using in TWO pies over WHOLE strawberries.  It doesn't overwhelm it, just adds that nice sweetness.  It would be too much gumminess if all the glaze was added to one pie over sliced strawberries.  My whole family LOVED it (even my picky 4 year old).  This will definitely become a family staple.  Thank you!

I found this had not enough strawberries for two pies (looked 'naked' almost) and entirely TOO sweet.  Not to our liking.

Incredible. We had this for breakfast because I was afraid the filling would be wet if it sat overnight and all day. No worries, I don't think it will wet the crust for 2 days. Definitely not enough sauce for 2 pies, these amounts were perfect for one pie.

This was the first strawberry pie I have ever made, and it was wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! The next time I make this I will Quarter the strawberries though. Having them whole made them a little hard to cut, and I had some really big berries. Thanks so much!

We really enjoyed this pie and it looked so pretty. I plan on fixing a couple for Easter dinner. I made a couple of changes. I used a graham cracker crust and sugar free Jello because that's what I had. The amount of glaze didn't seem like enough for two pies, so I made one pie with a lot of glaze and then poured the rest over some strawberries in a dish. This gave me a low calorie and fat dessert as well as the pie. 

As Dublin stated, it is a bit rubbery the next day. I wonder if using a bit less Jello would help.

turned out great! For those of you who had trouble with the pie not setting, do not bring the cornstarch mixture to a hard boil. Cornstarch becomes thin again if allowed to boil long.

Super easy!  I've made this recipe several times following the avice of others...used a graham cracker crust.  Cut my berries in half, and used the whole filling recipe for 1 pie.  Came out perfect every time.  Its a great refreshing recipe for a hot day and people always love it!

This is good, I only wish I had sliced the strawberries instead of placing them point up.  The pie looked too sparse.  Next time I will slice them and see how it turns out.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!   Just like the pie from the little mom and pop restaurant i went to as a  kid.  I did slice the berries instead of using them whole.  I did cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup (and it was plenty sweet. Does depend on your berries).  This does make only 1 pie worth, so i ended up using more berries and doubling the gelatin mixture.

I've made this pie twice this month, and here's what I like.    To sum up my adjustments: 3/4 c. sugar instead of 1 cup, 1 store bought graham cracker pie crust - no need to make or bake, about 1 1/2 quarts of berries - not 2, and I only used enough gelatin mixture to cover my berries - not all of it.  I've done this pie before and sliced the strawberries and didn't like the result.  I mostly halved the strawberries this time, adjusting as needed to cut out soft spots, etc.  I tried to make the strawberries point upward so the gelatin could flow through and reach every spot.  I filled in empty spots with smaller pieces of strawberry.    I've used the prepared gelatin from the store before, and I thought it had a tang to it.     For those who said their pie was runny there are two possibilities.  Either their strawberries were still fairly wet and the moisture was too much for the gelatin, or the gelatin cooled too much before it was added to the pie.  Gelatin has a matrix that "sets up" to give it the firm texture.  If it already begins to set up, and then it is stirred and poured over the pie, it may not set up again.  In defense of the original recipe - it really is just fine as written.  Most of us fill our pies to the top with berries, but it's probably just as good with large berries in a single layer.  You can always fill the void with Cool Whip.  I might even try it that way next time.  It's a low fat dessert, and even low calorie if you use sugar-free gelatin!

Delicious recipe just like my Grandma's Strawberry pie.  I used all the glaze with only one pie.  You would need to double the recipe for two.

Use cold water. Only use the amount of sugar you need based on sweetness of berries. For 1 pie do all the same but 2 tablespoons of strawberry jello.

Cook the sugar, cornstarch & water until it's clear. It's not going to be completely clear - rather not white anymore. It will bubble slightly & then get it off the burner. It will be thickened fine. Then add your jello. All should be well unless you took your berries out of the fridge & tried to use them cold. They will weep & you'll end up with a mess.

Yum!  I made this tonight & just had my first bite.  It is delicious.  I followed MrsKWaters advice & added a bit more sugar to the glaze mix as my strawberries were tart.  I also discarded the extra mix.  I mounded the strawberries like the directions said, but the filling did not spread out like I thought it would...maybe that's because of discarding the extra glaze mix?  But regardless, it is so good.  Oh, and I just made the topping as directed, but used brown sugar, & a dash of white.  Thanks for a great recipe!

So yummy!  4 or 5 people at the family party I took it to asked for the recipe, and everyone said it was delicious!  Very pretty too.  I did follow the recommendations of some reviewers and cut up the strawberries, I think it worked well that way.

this was so good! it took me a really long time though, because i used frozen strawberries and didnt think to thaw them out ahead of time. i made it with a whole weat crust and i think that just perfected it! it cuts the sweetness just enough to make it even better than before. oh, and also, this recipie really only makes one shallow pie, i dont know why it says it makes two.

I put the 1 cup water into the package of strawberries to make some natural strawberry juice; stir together 1 to 2 minutes, remove the juice then add the cornstarch and heat it up in the microwave.  You don't need any gelatin for this great recipe.  I used my Miracle Baking Powder Pie Crust II recipe on AR for the crust.  It was perfect!!

Yum, yum, yum!  We LOVE this recipe!  I just finished making another two pies for Memorial Day tomorrow.  I made this recipe exactly as written, except I cut up the berries instead of leaving them whole.  It still makes a very pretty pie.  I guess it's a matter of personal taste, but I disagree with those reviewers who said you need to double the gelatin part.  I think it's absolutely perfect like it is.  You get such a great focus on your fresh strawberries, and not so much on the gelatin.  I was actually worried about it the first time, that there wouldn't be enough to hold the pies together, but after setting for a few hours, they were perfect.  Just enough, and not too much.  Like I said, we love this recipe and definitely consider it a keeper!  Thanks, Janice!

I had a few problems with this pie. It was way too sweet and didn't set up right. Maybe I did something wrong, but I wasn't sure how "thick" it shoud be before taking it off the heat. I cooked it until it for at least 15 minutes and it didn't seem to be getting any thicker. Seemed thick enough when I put the pies in the fridge, but this morning it's running all over the place! Also, I cut down on the sugar and it was still way too sweet! Sorry.

Sooo good! I made this for a potluck and got rave reviews. Like many reviewers, I sliced the strawberries. I also doubled the glaze filling amount but didn't use all of it, so maybe I would one and a half it next time. It took a much longer time to set in the fridge than suggested in the recipe, but maybe that's because I used extra glaze. I used a store bought shortbread crust. Delicious!

This is my first review of a recipe here (I've tried a few recipes)and I have to say that this was fabulous! I halved the amount of sugar, sliced the strawberries, and used the whole recipe for 1 pie only. We had my brother-in-law and his wife over for dinner, and I brought this out after a huge meal. Everyone immediately declared they couldn't eat a bite as they were so full, however I made them all try a little piece each. Well! The pie disappeared in under 5 minutes! It was great!!! I will defintely make this again, and again, and again...!! Thanks for the great recipe - much appreciated :-)

I've never had strawberry pie before, but had plenty of strawberries and no idea what to do with them. This was a HUGE hit with my friends and their children, all 4 kids 4 and under. I used a shortbread crust too and cut back a little bit on the sugar (my strawberries were very ripe) and it was absolutely delicious!

OMG!  Fabulous recipe!  Hubby is not a dessert eater but asked to take a piece with lunch the next day.  I bought a shortbread crust and added a small jar of lemon curd on the bottom as other reviewers had recommended.  The lemon added another dimension of flavor to go with the sweet of the strawberries and sauce.  Used the creamiest whip cream in the can.  WOW.  What a great recipe.  I will be trying the diabetic version someone added, for my mother.  She is going to love this too.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Janice! :)

I used a ready made pie crust but it still tasted good.  The only thing was the jello didn't set right, so it was a litte runny.  It still tasted good, though.

Only had enough strawberries to make one pie.  It was incredible and gone in one day!  The filling set perfectly and had just the flavor I was looking for in a strawberry pie.  I used the Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site, and it was the perfect base for this pie.

This is a perfect end to any cookout. I smashed about six strawberries and had them cook with the cornstarch, which added a nice flavor. Next time will slice the strawberries, because it was almost impossible to eat with a fork.

although the recipe says "1" package of jello, 3 ounces is several packages. i used two (1.2) ounces, and that was much too much in combo with the cornstarch. the filling was hard to get through, even with a knife. much too thick and sticky.

This was an awesome recipe!!!  The only thing I would change, like other reviewers, is to cut back a little on the sugar.  I LOVE sweet things, and even though it didn't taste bad in the least, it was just a tad much.  I even used sugar free jello, but I probably would cut the sugar back to maybe a 1/2 C.  I also used a homemade gram cracker crust.  I used 1 package of gram crackers, 1/2 cup of ground walnuts, 1/3 C. Sugar, cinnamon to taste, and 6 tablespoons of melted butter.  There might have been some salt in there somewhere too, but I can't remember.  Mmmmmmmm. . . Goooooood!!!!!!

Quite good!  I thought the sweetness was perfect, Grumpy thought it was too sugary.  I used the full cup of sugar, but I used sugar free raspberry jello.  I did not make two pies - I made 1 deep dish pie.  I would make this again.  I love the fresh strawberries in the pie.

So glad to find this recipe again.  It is the best and freshest tasting strawberry pie I have ever tried.  Also, you can cut back on the sugar to suit your taste.  Thanks.

This was great!  I also cut up most of the strawberries as some others suggested and that worked well. I used a grahm cracker crust and I thought it was a tasty combination.  This recipe is fast, easy, and delicious!

This is a long time family favorite.  I have been making it for 25+ years and it is always perfect.  Let me say however, this recipe makes 1 pie, not 2.  
Also, for those that say that it didn't set up,  when using cornstarch as a thickening agent what ever you are making must boil for a couple of minutes.  Just adding boiling water or bringing it to a boil won't work.  Rule of thumb with this recipe is boil until clear, remove from heat and stir in jello.

Mine turned out too gelatin-like.  I found another recipe like this and it had all the same ingredients, but their recipe called for 2 cups of water instead. Most of the reviews for this other recipe changed the water to 1 1/4 cup water so I think that would help if you don't like your pie filling tasting like Jello. So disappointed!  This is so easy to make, I was hoping for a home run.

My family used to make a pie like this when I was a kid, so I decided to try it for my family after coming across this recipe. The pie is good for if you want a fresh dessert that is not so many calories. This Jello mixture though did not fill 2 pie shells, not even close. I ended up finishing the pies and then having to quickly make more of the mixture to be able to fill the gaps in the pie shells/ cover all of the strawberries. The strawberries are plenty for 2 shells, just double the Jello mixture when you're making it.

This makes a great pie!  This recipe is so simple and fresh!  I only needed one pie so I halved the recipe.  Even though I halved it, I used the whole 3 oz. package of gelatin along with a little more sugar since its winter and the berries right now aren't very sweet by themselves.  Making the filling a little sweeter really made up for the dull winter berries and you couldn't tell that the berries weren't at their peak season.  The filling amount wasn't enough to fill the entire pie shell up all the way.  But it was still delicious.  I may double the filling next time.  Such a great, light, and easy pie!  With a large dollop of whipped cream on top and you have an excellent dessert!  Thanks for this great recipe!  I will make again and again!

This strawberry pie turned out a little rubbery right out of the refrigerator--the filling.  I doubled the filling and had enough for just one pie with the 1 1/2 quarts of berries.  Maybe if I'd allowed the pie to sit out and warm up just a bit, it wouldn't have been so firmly jelled.  Next time, if I use this recipe again, think I'd add just a little more water, but that is such a hit and miss operation.  Just don't think I'd use this recipe again.  It was pretty, though!

So good & easy to make. I followed other's advice & cut the amount of sugar in half & it was still plenty sweet. I used a half cup, any more & it would have been way too sweet. Also I used one 9 inch pie crust and half the amount of strawberries. I did make all the sauce but used only 3/4 of it, again, that was more than enough. Perfect for summer, will definitely make again.

Very easy and beautiful! I cut the berries in half and arranged them in a circular pattern working from the outside in, with the points facing up. I followed the recipe and because I could fit the berries together more closely, didn't find it necessary to double the gelatin sauce. It was perfect. Because I made mine the day before, I spread a little soft cream cheese over the bottom of the cooled, baked crusts before filling to keep them from getting soggy. Turned out perfectly. Will use this recipe again and again! Thanks!

Not sure what went wrong but my pie came out tasting like jello in a pie crust.   I used the 2 tbs of cornstarch as called for but maybe it needs to be increased.

SO GOOD! Not good with math so I wasn't sure how much 2 1/2 qts where- store only sold 16 oz pkgs. I ended up using about 2 pkgs & it had plenty of strarwberries in it. The glaze was just enough for both pies, ended up being a lil less on second cause I wasn't paying attention. Next I will try on a shortbread cookie-crunb crust like others have suggested-prob give a even more fablous flavor! Loved that it made two! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a good pie. I used a lot more stawberries, and at the bottom, right on top of the crust, spread a layer of cream cheese mixed with cool whip. People are still talking about it months later.

Best strawberry pie I ever had.  After you add the gelatin, put the pot in a cold water bath, stirring the whole time, then pour over strawberries.  Only takes about 5 minutes to do this step. I like the shortbread crust the best.  The Strawberry Kewi Jello is awesome with this pie too!

Warning! The sauce mixture is not enough for 2 pies!  Either make 1 pie or make more sauce.  Other than that, it's great!

Perfect strawberry pie...I did double the filling but I didn't use it all. I did use raspberry jello for the darker red color. Homemade crust and REAL whipping cream make this delious! I won a pie contest with this baby!

I double this recipe and double the cornstarch. Then I put it in a 9x13 pan using the shortbread crust from this site. It tastes heavenly!

Terrific! One of the best strawberry pies considering the time and effort that you have to put into making it (easiest recipe you'll find). Will definitely make (and gobble down) again!

Very good pie.  My dad loves shoney's strawberry pie that's his favorite food of all time.  I made this and he said it was even better.  Made 4 pies for father's day and not a drop left! :)

Fresh Strawberry Pie has always been one of my favorite summer desserts.  This recipe is a fool-proof version.  It was only enough to make 1 pie, but it was yummy!  I found strawberry daiquiri jello and it was a good change.

I made this pie alongside a more traditional baked strawberry pie. To be honest, I was a little worried about the no bake approach at the beginning, but it definitely turned out fantastic! Compared to the traditional pie, it tastes much more fresh, and the taste of the strawberries really come out. I will definitely use this recipe the next time I make strawberry pie. By the way, I didn't have strawberry gelatin on hand, so I substituted with one envelope of unflavored gelatin, and it came out great.

Delicious even after I made some changes to reduce sugar content.  Substituted 1/2 cup SPLENDA for the 1 cup sugar and used a sugar free strawberry gelatin.  The glaze was a little thick, so I whisked in approx. 1/2 cup water.   Exactly enough filling for 2 8" crusts.

this pie was AWFUL!!  i made it for Easter for my family, and it never set up even though it was in the fridge for 24 hrs.  i followed the recipe exactly except i sliced the strawberries.  when i took it out of the fridge to cut and serve, the whole thing looked liked mush.  it was so soupy i was embarrased to serve it.  i had to put it in bowls and use spoons.  i would never make this pie again or recommend it to someone else.

I've made this recipe several times and it always turns out perfect, not sure what some of the other raters did wrong, but the recipe is perfect.  I use a deep dish crust and put in extra strawberries to fill it to the top.  It's become a true family favorite!

Very easy & good. For 1 pie I used a frozen pie shell (not deep dish). I used 1 lb. of sliced fresh strawberries. Then I halved the glaze ingredients and used 1/2 TBLSP of sugar free Jello. It was just sweet enough.  Low fat Redi-Whip was a great accompaniment.

This was just like my mom use to make when I was a kid! I only used one Nila pie crust and 1 lb of strawberries which I quartered and arranged in the pie crust.  I made the gelatin sauce as directed and poured in pie shell when luke warm.  It turned out great when served with a spot of extra creamy redi whip topping.

I made 2 of these pies for a block party and they were the first things to go. Everybody raved about this pie and asked for the recipe. I used a graham cracker crust, doubled the amount of the filling to make 2 pies(except for the sugar)and they turned out wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

Not impressed. Wasn't nearly as good as I hoped for. Thought it was very plain/boring, whipped topping was definitely needed.

Tasted good - I used a graham cracker crust and sliced the strawberries as others had suggested.  I'm glad I didn't leave them whole.  However, I too, found that the gel was not nearly enough.  I will use this recipe again, but will double the sugar, corn starch, water, gelatin part.

Good pie, but I was a little let-down, probably because the other reviews are raving. I had no technical problems preparing this at all. I halved the recipe and made one pie in a graham cracker crust. Substituted Splenda for sugar and cut the calories way down, though like the user who said she only used 1/4 cup, I think slightly less sugar could be used for those who are not sweet lovers.

Very good and very easy!  I used an already prepared frozen shortbread pie crust instead of making my own.  I was only able to make one pie with this recipe, but it was a huge hit.  I will certainly make this again.

This was very easy to make, though a little time consuming because I cut up the strawberries.  It looked beautiful, too.  My husband loved it!  I used ready made shortbread crust, and I thought that was the best part.  The gelatin mixture was a little sweet for me, but overall, pretty yummy with great presentation.

I made this yesterday for dessert & sliced the strawberries as suggested & laid each slice w/ the berry side up throughout the crust for perfect placement instead of just dumping them in the crust.
The recipe calls for 2 tbsp cornstarch..I think if I didn't make the 2 tbsp LEVEL, it would've been a bit thicker.  Next time, & there will be a next time, I will put 1/4 tsp more cornstarch in the mixture to be a tad bit firmer, as I would like.
I did use heavy cream to make whipped cream for the topping instead of the whipped cream in the can or cool whip. 
I give this recipe 5 stars because it's a refreshing dessert for these summer days.

AWESOME!!! I only had 1-9" pie shell, so I went with it, using 1/2 the strawberries (which I opted to slice), but making the whole amount of 'glaze' (which I used almost all of). This set up quickly and cut beautifully. I garnished this with some whipped topping that was in the fridge. Strawberry pie is one of my hubby's favorites, and this was my first time making it as a surprise to him...he raved! This was so simple, that I will be making this again, for sure v(hubby already informed me of that, lol)! Thanks for sharing. :)

Amazing!  One of the best pies I've ever made!  I followed the recipe exactly and added fresh whipped cream when serving.  I found the filling was for one pie, also.  I made two pies today with fresh picked strawberries - this as my "uncooked" and another from allrecipes as my "cooked".  This was the winner hands down!  The strawberries' taste did not get lost in the jello and just tasted fresh, light and like the begining of summer!

Awesome Awesome pie. Made 3 of them and they are gone because they were such a hit. Thanks for sharing. I did use cold water that I brought to a boil like others suggested and the amount of ingrediants listed was good for 1 9" pie.

Super simple and extremely yummy! I cooked the glaze a little too long so it was a little too sticky. But, that was my fault.

This is the best strawberry pie!!!It is so light and fresh, and awesome the next day as well ( that is, if you have any leftovers ). I made one pie instead of two, because I had enough glaze for only one pie. My suggestion is to double the glaze if you want two pies. I simply cannot believe that this pie has only 167 calories per serving!!!It is so tasty!!!Thank you Janice for this wonderful recipe.

Best Pie! Easy & delicious! Used Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this site. Both complemented each other. AWESOME! Brushed Crust w/egg white, sprinkled w/sugar, prebaked for 30 mins. Dunked 8 extra large berries into cooled gelatin & set aside. I stirred in cut berries in cooled gelatin til well coated then poured back into crust. Arranged 8 dunked berries around on top of crust. Whipped up fresh cream 1/2 c. heavy cream beat on high then stirred in sugar (sprinkled a little at a time) & vanilla (drops at a time) to taste. Dolloped between large berries I arranged on top. So Pretty! Professional looking! My family thought the pie came from a bakery couldn't believe I made. I have gotten so many raves & compliments!Told better than restaurant & better than the famous Shoney's Strawberry Pie! Have already put both recipes in my personal cookbook.

I have made this pie 3 times now, twice with graham cracker crust (too hot to bake) and once with baked pie shell.  Delicious both ways.  I read other reviews prior and did cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup and cornstarch to 1 tbl.  I have also made with fresh wild raspberries and raspberry jello--Excellent!!

This has amazing flavor. Making the filling or glaze was very simple and the only time consuming part is waiting for it to cool. My entire family enjoyed and I will use this recipe over and over again. Thanks

This is an easy and delicious desert for any summer evening.  The part that took the longest was the baking of the pie shell itself.  I highly recommend this desert to anyone and everyone.  I had plenty of filling for two pies. Big hit!!!

Not bad.  I had to use powdered sugar instead of the normal granulated kind because I didn't have enough.. but I don't think it made a difference in taste.  The filling was a bit thick, so I might decrease the cornstarch some the next time.  The taste, however, is divine.  This will be an excellent choice if you're looking for something light and not too sweet.  Note:  the glaze portion will NOT make two pies as written, it's not possible.  One deep dish pie, however, most definitely.    A keeper.

I followed the suggestions of MrsKWaters review and mixed the sugar, jello and cornstarch, added 1 cup of cold water,  and boiled for 5 minutes.  Let that mixture cool and pour over sliced strawberries and refrigerate a few hours.  My family loved it.  I was afraid the jello would make it too sweet or artifical tasting but it did not.

This is a delicious pie.  I used a store-bought chocolate graham cracker crust that was collecting dust in the pantry and I spread cream cheese on the crust for richness like others suggested.  I loaded up my pie with strawberries and had enough leftover glaze for a second pie...but no crust.  So I made strawberry "pudding".  Thanks for sharing this recipe.   Four stars only because it's so simple.

After reading all the problems that others had, I was pleasantly surprised when my pie turned out wonderful!  But as stated by others it only made 1 pie.  I thought since it thickened so fast it would be rubbery but it was perfect!  I did not put it in the refrigerator to set up but simply left it on the counter.  Everyone raved.

This is a good recipe! The pie turns out so pretty and it's so easy to make. I suppose you could use a jar of strawberry glaze instead of the gelatin, cornstarch, sugar, and water, but making it from scratch can be just as easy!

Cool, fresh, and tasty best describes this pie.  Was in a pinch for a quick dessert when one of my sons announced he had invited someone to dinner.  Very basic ingredients that are usually always on hand.  Turned out perfect and didn't last through the night.  Can't wait until strawberry season so I can make again.  Thanks for sharing.

I've made this several times and it always comes out great.  You can easily half the glaze recipe if you don't mind throwing out a half a box of gelatin.  The cooking time for the glaze is not very long, 5-8 minutes, max, until it is clear and thickened.  Those who have trouble with this recipe may want to drop by your local bakery--it's pretty fool proof.

Following some advice, I used a graham cracker crust, and the recipe filling for one pie. I made two, one with a layer of cream cheese + powdered sugar + vanilla extract. First of all, I left it in the fridge for only 5 hours or so, but it had already turned so rubbery and all I tasted was jello. The one with the cream cheese turned out even worse... something(I think was the crust) tasted really salty in contrast to the extremely sweet everything else, so I wouldn't suggest the cream cheese thing. Good thing there was some Cool Whip to top it off, or else it would've been a total failure....

I made this over the weekend and it way very, very, good!!  The best Strawberry pie I ever had, and of course you must top off that "lil ol piece" with whipped cream!!  Great summer time dessert!  My son Joey went crazy for this pie,(and he looked so cute with the pie glaze all over his face...another Kodak moment!!  Thanks!

Pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I made this and another strawberry pie on the same date.  The other was gone and this one was barely touched.  The directions were easy to follow directions and it was fairly inexpensive to make,  but I too only had enough filling for one pie.  I think if I make it again, I would definately use a graham cracker crust instead of a regular pie crust.

This was such a hit with my guests-they finished it in 20 min. I made one pie with all the ingredients, but reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, it was just the right amount of sweetness. Sliced the strawberries like others suggested. My next goal is to find a low fat crust and then this pie will really be light!

Delicious! I've made this two times already (no leftovers). For the second pie, I used less sugar. The filling is alittle too sweet.

I get great raves when I make this pie! I slice the strawberries instead of leaving them whole. I also use a graham cracker crust instead of bake shells. Super easy!

Great pie.  I know some people said the glaze got rubbery, but we let one pie chill overnight and thought it was much better once the flavours had set.  We also added a layer of cream cheese (creamed with powdered sugar, some vanilla and a little almond extract), and used a shortbread crust.  Since we had odd-sized strawberries, I sliced them all, and layer strawberries with glaze. It was a "picture perfect" pie, but VERY yummy.

This recipe was wonderful!  I cut the recipe in half to make one pie and  chilled the glaze before adding to the strawberries.   I didn't have any trouble with the glaze becoming rubbery the next day. Will definately use this recipe again!!!!

WOW!  This was so pretty and so good.  I made it for Mother's Day and it turned ut perfectly.  I did take the advice of others and made it the same day since there were comments that it can turn "rubbery" when sitting overnight.  I topped each serving with a dollop of Cool Whip.  We loved it.

This was very good. I added a little cream cheese (whipped smooth with a little sugar) to the bottom of each pie crust before adding the strawberries and jello mixture. Very good. A definate repeat at our house!

This pie is so quick and simple to make.  It's beautiful and delicious.  My family loved it, it didn't last more than an hour.  I wouldn't change anything about this recipe...it's perfect.  Whipped cream is a must!  I am planning on making this again next week!

This recipe was delicious.  I only had sugar free strawberry kiwi jello so I added some red food coloring.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and made one pie and I sliced the strawberries rather than putting them in whole.  It turned out beautifully.I am going to try the graham cracker crust next time. YUM!

This pie was really good, however, for this pie to be full, I found the need to use all of the gelatin.  For two pies, you would need to use 6 oz of gelatin.

Not bad for the first time making a pie.  Next time I will reduce the sugar or use a sugar free jello as I personally thought it was overly sweet.

I made a couple strawberry pies for my ladies Bunco group and they're were begging me to make it again!!  I combined the cornstarch, water, jello and sugar in a saucepan- brought to a boil over med heat, then once it reached a boil, I let it cook for 5 more min, whisking often.  Make sure you let the glaze completely cool before pouring over the strawberries.  I used a 9" pie pan and about 4 baskets of fresh strawberries.  I made a crust out of shortbread cookies and topped the pie with fresh real whipped cream!!  DELCIOUS!

No changes were necessary to this recipe, it comes out exactly as promised and is delicious!  From my own errors, use slightly larger pie crusts or smaller pie plates so the crust is uniform, and spray or butter the pie plate before baking the crust into it- this pie sticks like crazy (but was worth every crumb).

This pie was amazing and so easy to make. I halved all of my strawberries and arranged them with the uncut sides facing up. Made with the “Basic Flaky Pie Crust” recipe from this site... after baking the shell I coated with a thin layer of melted chocolate chips. A thanksgiving dinner hit!

I never realized how easy it is to make strawberry pie! Instead of a regular pie crust, I bought a pre made  kebbler shortbread crust, and after putting Ready whip on top, i added a few blueberries. DELICIOUS!!!!!!

My husband, and everyone else, absolutely loved this pie. I made the addition that his mom did, when she baked it for him as a boy. She spread softened cream cheese over bottom of the cooled crust.  I also cut the strawberries in quarters and then spread them out over the cream cheese. The gelatin mixture was only a thin layer, but gave just enough to complement the other ingredients. Topped with real whipped cream. It was a huge hit for hubby's 70th birthday and took him back to his younger years.

Pretty good pie. Easy recipe till you get to the glaze. Mine was too thick by the time it was at room temperature. I had to add some hot water to thin it out, enough to be able to spread it over the berries. I will cut the corn starch amount by half next time. I will also reduce the sugar by half, the jello mix is plenty sweet..

This is the easiest winning-est recipe ever.  I've made it numerous times, always with no recipe adjustments.  I use pre-made (refrigerated) pie crusts.  The pie is pretty with the strawberries standing up.  Everyone who tastes it wants the recipe.  It is best when berries are in season, of course, but is even very good (and a surprise) when the berries are purchased from the grocery store any time of year.  I always make two pies and serve with whipped cream.  Fresh taste.

I used sugar free  strawberry Jello and "cook and serve" Jello Vanillla pudding in my strawberry pie.  That sure cuts down on the calories.

My mother made this same recipe for years, however she cut the sugar to 1/2 C and the Jello to 1/2 small package. The amount called for are for a single pie as many others have noted.   It's the best strawberry pie ever in my opinion.

This was a good base recipe, but as some others did we changed it up just a bit.  This was only enough liquid for ONE 9 inch pie; and we even added 1/2 cup more boiling water.  The only other change we made was 1/2 cup sugar instead of 1 cup. It solidified and was perfect tasting for our pie. Thanks for sharing!

I left the strawberries whole  - just cut off the green bit, and piled them high (2 lbs for 1 pie), then poured on the glaze. It set beautifully and looked so decadent! Serve with fresh cream to bring on the ooohs and ahhs! (I might use less than the cup of sugar next time, it was very sweet... but delicious!)

It looked and smelled good, but it was too soupy! I made it for a co-worker's birthday and was disappointed with the results. Lesson learned: take the thickening step seriously. I pulled it from the heat and added jello as soon as it started showing signs of thickening because, foolish me, I thought adding jello would ensure it would be quite thick. I was worried it might become too thick and would be difficult to add to the strawberries. Now it's just a sugary soup mess in the bottom of the pie shell.

Have made a few different versions of this pie and this is my fave!! Agree, the amounts for the filling are enough for ONE PIE ONLY.  Love the berry points facing up & piling extra -  it was perfection. I also made a graham cracker crust (FAR better than pastry crust) and put it in a spring form pan. Makes such a gorgeous pie - took it to a dinner party last night and everyone was amazed I made it myself (embarrassed how easy it is!).

This is my mini tart and pie to go to recipe if i want a strawberry pie!! I loved it. Everyone loved it. I should rate this a 4 due to the fact one recipe was enough for 1pie i found so i doubled the filling recipe then it was enough for two pie but had alittle extra filling. I also used frozeb strawberries and unthawed and drained the extra fluid from srrawberries. This was a hit and i will always use this recipe again and again

Great taste and easy to make, but there is no way this makes enough filling for two pies. I would use this as a one pie recipe, especially if using the 9 inch crusts.

I replaced all of the sugar with Splenda for one batch, and while it does set up normally it has a strong aftertaste. I'd recommend mixing the sugar with Splenda in a 50/50 ratio.

I make this pie multiple times every summer.  It is a huge hit at cook outs and pool parties, especially on patriotic holidays!  As others have said I also use all ingredients for ONE pie.  My husband's Aunt is diabetic and I've made it with the sugar-free jello for her and it turned out great.

Sooooo Good!  This was well easy as pie to make and turned out so good!!  The only thing I will change the next time I make this is that I will slice up the strawberries because I had big handpicked strawberries.  This is definitely a keeper!

Delicious.  I made one deepdish  9" pie.  I sliced strawberries in half so the sweet gelatin mixture would flavor all of them.

I've been looking for a good glaze recipe for years and finally found one.  This tastes good, but doesn't overpower the berries. Easy recipe and well worth trying.

Far too sweet. I even started out with less sugar than called for and the sweetness was overpowering. Would be good with less sugar or more berries.

I made this with no modifications, and it came out great.  I combined it with a shortbread crust, which I think really complimented the strawberries well.

Fantastic! Also, cut the strawberries in quarters instead of leaving them whole. Made one pie instead of two. Unlike another strawberry pie recipe I tried from this site, the method and cornstarch amount for this recipe was perfect...no clumping!

Two words...Cold and Refreshing!  This is the perfect summertime dessert!  I added cold water, sugar, cornstarch and jello at the same time and let it come to a rolling boil and then timed it for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.  My husband and my twin 15 month old sons loved it.

Great recipe -- delicious pie!  I used a 10 inch pie plate with two quarts of strawberries.   I used a flaky pie crust recipe of my mom's and the combination of pie crust and strawberry pie was fantastic. Thank you, Janice for a great recipe.

Quick and easy and turns out great!  I did cut up my strawberries because if you do it like the recipe says you have a lot more gelatin  than strawberry in your pie.  AND I only made one pie and there still wasn't enough gelatin for it, I made out with what I had but could have used a little bit more. I also only used 3/4 cup of sugar and it is definately sweet enough. YUM~!

I took this pie to work and its was gone by the time I went home. But, personally, I think there was too much Jello. The pie reminded me a bit of a Jello fruit salad. So next time I'll just ease up on the "glaze" a little.

I just got rave reviews on this pie.  I followed the suggested changes and cut the sugar to 1/4c, sliced the strawberries and used sugar-free gelatin.  I made this for my friend's birthday and with the changes, it made a nice low calorie treat for all us girls at the office.

A quick and easy pie to make...I used raspberry gelatin since that's all I had.  As others suggested, I'd recommend reducing the sugar to 3/4 cup.

This recipe was so easy and so good!! I did double the filling like others have said and I sliced the strawberries. I made it for Memorial Day and threw in some fresh blueberries for a patriotic touch. It was delicious! It will be a staple around my house during the summer time.

I made this pie, and it turned out so good that my husband asked me to make another. We picked way too many strawberries at the strawberry patch, so I had plenty to make another.  I didn't have any more strawberry Jello on hand, though, so I used cherry Jello.  Wow!  It was even better than the pie made with strawberry Jello!

Phenomenally delicious and easy pie.  Substituted 4T flour for the cornstarch because we did not have any on hand.  This made enough filling for 1 pie, not two.

This pie was scrumptious with Cool Whip topping. I found that the ingredients did not quite make for 2 pies so I increased the fresh strawberries to 3 quarts, the cornstarch to 3T, the boiling water to 2 cups & used a large box of sugar free strawberry gelatin.

I agree with the previous reviewers...the ingredients were only enough to make 1 pie.  But, boy was this pie delicious!!  I served with homemade whipped cream and everyone raved!  Even my husband and brother-in-law, who are not huge fans of strawberries, thought it was delicious.  Thank you so much for the recipe!!

This is the very first recipe on this site that I did not like.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and I was disappointed with the results.  The glaze was nice and clear while it was warm, but then turned opaque and rubbery when it cooled.  I will not be making this again.

this pie was rather bizarre, because the jello filling was rather hard and the strawberries were soft (I admit that they were frozen). But the flavors worked pretty well, and I suppose if this recipes was followed exactly it will prove to be good, but unfortunately not the best...

I know the original recipe makes 2 pies, but I don't see how.  I used about 2.5 lbs. of whole/halved strawberries and the glaze measurements from the recipe for one pie. I also used raspberry jello for a darker red color. It came out looking beautiful and plan to serve it tomorrow with cool whip at my son's birthday barbecue!

Only enough for one pie.  I used less sugar... 1/4 cup sugar.  I would adjust the sugar according to how sweet your strawberries are.

Tasty but runny.  I've made it twice as written (divided by two for only one pie)and it was runny both times.  It would make a better ice cream topping than pie filling.

Made this pie with the french pastry pie crust also from allrecipes.  I doubled the pie filling part.  I liked the crust :-) 

I don't think I enjoyed this as much because it tasted much like strawberry jello pie with a little extra sweetness; but not enough to bring out the actual strawberry.   Just didn't do it for me.

I really liked the recipe and felt it was easy as I consider myself a novice cook with not too much experience in making pies.  I did read the reviews and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup (still used regular jello) because I was afraid it would be too sweet and also sliced the strawberries as we had just picked fresh ones that morning.  Our fellow diners liked it, even one who is a great chef so I would definitely make it again.

We enjoyed this a lot!  I made a bunch of changes though.  I made a mix of cream cheese, lime juice, and powdered sugar to layer the bottom with, which was excellent.  I also topped it with a cool whip/sour cream mix and roasted almond slices.  I wished I would've cut the sugar, but I forgot.  My pie had too many flavors.  I might leave the jello part out next time.  I'm not sure.

This was one of the best strawberry pies that I have ever eaten!  I ended up making only one pie, and used a Nilla Wafer premade pie crust and splenda. I also used fat free cool whip.  It was to die for!  My daugther, who normaly does not care for strawberries, loved it!

I used the entire gel mixture for one pie which had strawberried piled high.  After pouring the gel over the strawberries I was afraid it would not set up as it seemed a little soupy.  However, it set up perfectly in a couple of hours.  It is as someone said "fool proof".  My husband said I used a little too much gel mixture but it was needed to hold the strawberries together. It was quite tasty!

So easy and delicious! Using a graham cracker crust is the best! I also cut down my sugar to a little less than 1/2cup and the filling was still pretty sweet. The pie filling is enough for only one pie. I would double the ingredients in the future.

Good recipe but not clear enough. For those whose mixture didn't set...how the recipe should read is after adding boiling water continue to boil under medium heat until desired consistency. I boiled mine for about 8 minutes stirring occasionally. Also, this mixture works best for out of season fruit that isn't as sweet naturally. Besides that, it's a pretty simple recipe. I added a homemade crust as well.

Slurpy and sloppy!  I read the recipe, and compared it to an old one I already had - they were nearly identical (how hard could it be?)  Like the other person, my pie was a disaster.  Just LIQUID, never "set"...while I was stirring the "glaze", the sugar started balling up in the saucepan....I tried AGAIN, made another pan of glaze --- it did the same thing!  I put the Jello in and threw it together anyway, hoping it would set in the fridge....never did.  I wouldn't bother trying to make this again....I still don't know what I did "wrong"....maybe the heat was too high???  I don't know, it still should have set!

I'm still looking for a good strawberry pie recipe, although my nine-year-old son, bless his heart, he ate the pie anyway, after I scooped it up IN A BOWL with whipped cream on top.

This recipe tasted very very good... I actually used store bought shortbread crust and coated the bottom in vanilla pudding and placed the strawberries in that.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the glaze did turn out to be a little rubbery (just after a few hours for me).  HOwever, I think it had an excellent flavor.

Fantastic!!  This pie looks beautiful and tastes great too!  I cut the sugar by just a bit and also added a thin cream cheese/ sugar/ vanilla layer like one of the other users.  My husband and I ate more than 1/2 of the pie in one sitting!

When strawberries are in season, I have such a taste for strawberry pie, but not being a great baker I usually go to a Bakery to purchase one. This recipe has put a stop to that because it is easy, sets up firm and is better than all those pies I purchased

This is a good recipie if you adjust it to make only one pie.  I agree with the previous reviews that there was not enough glaze to cover both pies. I had to mark it down overall because you shouldn't have to adjust a good recipe in order to make it work. Next time I will make one pie and use only 1 1/2 quarts of strawberries.

This would be a good recipe except for the fact that the filling is not enough.  I had to take off a star for this. You shouldn't have to alter a recipe to make it come out right, so I gave it 3 stars instead of 5.

A very tasty recipe.  I would like a bit more glaze though and would try it again with a bit more water and cornstarch.  The whipped cream is a must.

I made this adding sliced strawberries (instead of whole), using half the amount of strawberries, it was very good. Thanks for the recipe.
