Wonderful taste!  I used a combination of spelt and sorghum flours to make this bread, so my product wasn't quite like the recipe. This was my first experience with kohlrabi, and I loved it!  Thanks for the recipe!

I don't have a bread machine, so I just put everything in my mixer bowl and used the bread hooks to mix and knead. I let it rise,  then shaped and baked for 30 min at 350. The bread came out great with a wonderful texture, but the rosemary taste was a bit heavy -- I would reduce that next time.
Update: made it again this year with fresh out-of-the-garden kohlrabi and rosemary. This time, I used my food processor to make the puree and used fresh minced rosemary -- probably a full tablespoon. Then I misread the recipe and put in 2 T instead of 2 t of yeast. Didn't change the taste, but it sure rose fast and high! Baked for 35 minutes and it came out beautifully! It is not a sweet bread that hides the taste of the veggie -- you absolutely get the kohlrabi and rosemary taste! (Good toasted, with eggs and mushrooms for breakfast!)

Loved the flavor but needs a few tweaks. My loaf collapsed, I believe this was secondary to excess yeast- will probably decrease to 1.5 tsp if I get to make this again. The dough was also VERY wet, I ended up sprinkling flour during the kneading cycle until it finally formed a ball. I did not meassure how much extra flour I added but my best guesstimate would be close to 3/4 of a cup. All in all, if I find myself with a kohlrabi in my hands, would love to make again.

This bread was delicious!  It is a terrific way to use kohlrabi .  The bread was great for breakfast and sandwiches.  I did not change a thing except that I was out of wheat bread flour so I used just white flour.  It came out almost like a wheat bread.  I am making another loaf today.

Followed this recipe ‘as is’ except used just 1 tsp of yeast.  We have an SD-YD250 Panasonic bread maker, which does a reverse order of ingredients.....The flavor was excellent, just enough Rosemary. Definatley one of the best tasting loaves made.  I too got a boatload of  kohlrabi at a CSA and had no idea what to do with it. This helped me use some of it.  Will make this again!

I'm giving this 4 stars only because the bread, as made in a bread machine, is a bit too dense for me. The flavor is wonderful, but I think next time I'll put it in the machine at the dough setting, and when done I'll put it in a bread pan to rise and bake. Thanks for a delicious recipe that I can make when my garden over-produces kohlrabi again!
