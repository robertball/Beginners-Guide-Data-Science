BF was not a fan of these but my co-workers loved them. I replaced the shortening with butter and left out the nuts.

I didn't have any buttermilk so I mixed milk and lemon juice before I started so it'd have time to curdle. Other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out wonderfully. I like the molasses and chocolate together. But next time I'll leave out the chocolate chips. They were a bit too rich for me with them.

These are good, but I would have preferred them to be more dense - they turned out fluffy and cake-like.  I did use butter instead of shortening, so that may have impacted the fluffy factor.  When I tasted the batter, I was concerned that the molasses flavor would be too strong, but after baking they were not too molassesy for me.  They were quick to prepare - I had them in the oven within 20 minutes, and they really did take just 12 minutes to bake.

These were good, but the walnuts make it a little bitter, and I am a nut lover.  Next time I will leave them out.

Very easy and delicious!  A surprisingly great combination of flavors.  (Great without the walnuts, too!)

I like molasses and I like chocolate, but I learned from this recipe that I don't care for them together.

Very good cookies, rich and brownie-like.  The molasses flavor really comes through.  I used half of the chocolate chips, and it turned out great.
