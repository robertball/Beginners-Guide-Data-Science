This was easy to make, however I didn't like the orange with the dates and raisins. I can see how it could go well with the Heritage Jam Cake, but I wasn't a fan. Next time I try this filling, I will use tart apples - not sure if that will work. Otherwise, I'll just make the cake with a different topping altogether.
