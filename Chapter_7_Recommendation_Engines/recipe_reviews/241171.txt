I am having my own personal little tea party right now with these scones and some Earl Grey tea. These little darlings are delicious! So many undertones of flavor, yet not one overpowers the other. I put the drizzle on top only to make them pretty, but they certainly don't need it for taste. These are tiny, so I was afraid 30-35 minutes would be way too long; however, they were ready in 25 minutes, so watch them carefully when you bake them.

The result was really good, but I'm way too lazy to follow a recipe with this many ingredients again.
