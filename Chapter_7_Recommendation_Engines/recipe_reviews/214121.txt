I have never made lasagna before, so I was worried about how this would turn out.  To my amazement, it not only turned out delicious, but it actually looked good, too!   I followed the recipe exactly.  I don't have lasagna experience, so I'm sure other reviewers will have different ways of making this, but I can't think of any changes that should be made. Also, I recommend taking the time to make your own sauce, rather than using a jar.  The sauce was wonderful and really made the dish.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was great, though needed a little more seasoning than the recipe called for, especially salt and pepper.

I mistakingly bought a butternut squash instead of a spaghetti squash so I came here looking for a way to use it.  Came across this recipe and absolutely loved it!  I am a full time working mom with two young kids so I did the speedy version.  I did not make my own sauce, I used Newman's Own Sockaroni sauce.  I microwaved the butternut squash whole and then peeled and sliced it into thin slices once it cooled.  Next time I will buy frozen spinach and thaw it to speed things up even more.  Also, I did not use all of the cheese mixture, the lasagna was plenty big without using all of it and I figured it would cut down on the calories as well.  Still turned out wonderfully and I love that this is a much healthier version of traditional lasagna.  Thank you for sharing!

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED all this garden goodness! The sauce turned out a little thick for me, but this may have been because I used fresh tomatoes; I will just add more water next time. I crushed the butternut squash and this helped it to not be so chunky. I loved the sweetness of the squash, but my hubby and kids did not, so I would probably leave it out next time. Otherwise it was wonderful, wholesome, and delicious! It is lots of layers, so make sure you have a deep dish to cook this one! Thanks for a great keeper!!

This a really good lasagna- And the first time I made one myself! I would omit the zucchini next time. Many said this was somewhat bland or needed more seasoning, so I seasoned to taste. The sauce I used a few more cloves of garlic, increased the spices (added marjoram, thyme, chili flakes, bay leaf & rosemary), used ground pork (worked well enough since it's a white meat- I would drain off the fat a little more next time though) and since the recipe called for 7.5 cups of liquid total, I divided it as such: 1 can diced, spicy tomatoes (with onions & seasoning), 1 cup tomato gravy (made with fresh tomatoes & bacon grease- had leftover from another recipe/meal), 1 cup spicy tomato sauce, 2 cups tomato paste & 2 cups water + beef bouillon cube. I forgot to mention that along with the meat portion, I had added the remains of a pack of cremini mushrooms. I only cooked it for roughly 45 minutes as the sauce had reached a consistency that I liked. I opted to boil my butternut squash after peeling and dicing for roughly half an hour, then mashed with a little butter and seasoned with sage, salt, garlic powder & pepper. Instead of simply wilted the spinach we opted to crisp them a bit and used 2 bags of fresh spinach. Opted for low-fat cottage cheese instead if ricotta and used low-fat mozzarella. Baked as directed, but you need deeper than a 9x13 and there will be leftover sauce (little bit). I seasoned the mixture with S&P. We served it with "Herb Spread for French Bread" from AR.

This was great, and took a lot of work, but could be even better pretty easily.  I used bottled sauce.  I cooked onions and garlic in a little evoo, then added the turkey, drained a little, added the sauce.  Then made the ricotta layer and sliced the veggies.  Also used frozen spinach well drained.  And I used whole milk ricotta which made it better.  Next time I'd use a peeler to get thin slices of zucchini, and season each layer (add s&P and maybe something else).  I also mashed the squash which worked nicely.  I used regular lasagna noodles and didn't add any water.  It was pretty dry, but I like it that way.  Will be making this again!!!

I wish I had added salt. And it definitely needed bigger than a 9x13. It was already at the top of the pan when I had only done 2 layers. So I flipped it over into a 10x15.

Whole family loved this recipe, including my 10 year old. He would prefer the zucchini chopped rather than sliced and I agree. It does take quite a while to make. Prep time is NOT 30 minutes, yes, maybe if you have everything already pre-chopped. Great recipe!

Fantastic recipe! I made this for my sister after she had her baby and it was the perfect dish for new parents! They loved it. I added more vegetables like bell peppers and mushrooms which counter-balanced the fact that I used whole-milk mozzarella (hopefully!). It does get a little watery at the bottom but I figured that this would set in as the dish cooled.

This was a great recipe! The only change I made was that I mashed the butternut squash instead of cubing it.  It definitely took much longer than 30 minutes to prepare, but it was well worth it.

Followed the recipe almost exactly.  I layered it differently and chopped the zucchini based on one reviewers suggeston.  The veggies were all over the top layer too.  Everyone loved it except my daughter who enjoyed the lasagna itself but not the fennel seeds.  I'll skip them next time.  We will make this again, but on a weekend.  It is a lot of cleanup for a weekday meal, but we do LOVE how we got all of the food groups in one dish.

This tastes like a very traditional lasagna.  I actually did this thinking that it would be a little heartier with the squash, zucchini & spinach, but you really couldn't taste those things.  So, if you have a picky eater, than this is a great alternative.   I believe the fennel gave it more of a sausage flavor as well.   So it was very good for a lasagna, but I like more chunky vegetable lasagna myself!

Wonderful!  This was a great recipe.  We made it minus the squash as I didn't have any on hand and it was superb.  My husband said he would give it 10 stars if he could.  I just made another batch of it tonight but substituted the turkey for ground duck.  I'm hoping for even better results.  Thanks!

This recipe was okay but not outstanding. After all the prep work and dirty dishes it created, we had alot higher hopes. Next time I'll just add butternut to my usual lasagna recipe. Thanks anyway!

Yummy, the men want more meat in it, add fresh sliced cherry tomato and bacon on top for added flavor, it is especially tasty when you warm it up with bacon on top and add fresh tomato pieces to each bite.

Fantastic and turned out perfect!! We are a small family so I halved the recipe and made it in a 8x8 glass dish using Barilla flat rolled no-boil lasagna noodles (2 noodles covers the 8x8 pan perfectly!)  The sauce is very thick to begin with, so we only let it simmer about 20-30 minutes before assembly.  Leave in all the veggies for the health benefits - the kids won't even notice them!!

It’s pretty good and it is definitely healthier than the alternative. But for all the work and time this recipe calls for, I’d rather have a cheesy meaty rich lasagna.

Used ~10 lasagna pasta sheets,  or half a box. Added a pound of mushrooms to sauce. Sliced butternut squash thin and baked well. Used green and yellow zucchini,  salted and squeezed to drain. Mixed spinach into sauce right before removing from fire or spinach will dissolve.  Added bay leaves and available spices. Eaten with side of tzatziki just because it was around and it complemented well!

I used frozen spinach (and squeezed out the juice) instead of fresh, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It turned out freaking healthy and delicious, and held its form better than any other lasagna I've made.

Very good stuff, good ingredients, but could be improved. Based on reviewers I added some salt. Maybe some of acidity, like a little vinegar or  lime would help. Next time I'll squash the squash, leaving less air inside the dish.

This lasagna was delicious and easy to make!! I did add salt to both the sauce and ricotta mixture, it definitely needed it. I also had left over beef broth so I added that in place of the water for added flavor. I also julienned 2 large carrots and added them to the sauce for some more veggies. TIP: start making the sauce first and while it's simmering, dice up all your veggies!

As is, it's a four star. I made this again using full fat ricotta and cheese and it was definitely a 5 star recipe. The spice combination in the turkey sauce is really divine. I'm going to use the sauce recipe to make a turkey spag bol!

I did not make any changes to the ingredients other than cutting the recipe in half. Although, I only cooked the sauce about 30 minutes after browning onions, garlic & turkey. I am not a fan of turkey, but I loved this. Great dish, I will definitely make it again.

This was a Wonderful lasagna that I will keep making. I did make a few changes as I prefer fat free cottage cheese instead of ricotta. I just prefer the texture, taste, and it's creamier to me. The 1st time I made this I used sliced mushrooms as I did not have butternut squash and it turned out fantastic. I also slice my zucchini into thin 'coins' & that worked better for me.  The 2nd time I used the butternut squash and I got major raves from family! This is versatile, works with the fresh vegetables you have on hand, and is a keeper in my recipe box!

This recipe turned out amazing! This was my first time using butternut squash in  lasagna, my roommates went back for 2nd.  None of us thought it was too bland, I also used twice as much  ricotta as the recipe called for and a jar of pasta sauce since I ran out while assamblimg

Very tasty lower calorie, healthy lasagna.  I modified it slightly by adding 1 chopped green pepper, 3 cups chopped mushrooms (sauteed), and using Pam instead of oil and 3 T. Egg Beaters instead of eggs.  I also increased the quantity of butternut squash to 4 1/2 cups total and used 12 lasagna noodles instead of 9. Also used 8 oz. mozzarella, rather than 6 oz.   The noodles were not the pre-cooked variety, so I boiled them before assembling the lasagna.  I cooked this in a larger pan, roughly 13" x 16".  It made 15 servings, at a total of 290 calories per serving.

I made this recipe for supper last night.  I used two packages of ricotta and 12 oz of shredded mozzarella.   I used 2 jars of marinara sauce but also spiced the turkey according to the recipe.  My family prefers butternut squash so I increased the amount by half.  Otherwise I followed the directions exactly and added about 3 oz of parmesan cheese to the top.  BEST LASAGNA MY FAMILY HAS EVER TASTED!

Absolutely amazing! Made it for my family dinner, hoping it would be any good.... And we stuffed ourselves! We couldn't get enough! Reheated the next day at work famously also! So pleased, I already bought another squash to make it again! Thank you so much for sharing!

This was such a success. Especially being my first time ever making a lasagna. I tweeked the recipe a bit but the taste I'm sure is still the same.

- Used Whole Wheat Lasagna pasta
- Sliced both zucchini and squash (Did not use microwave, just baked it all together so its not so soggy. The texture was perfect coming out of the oven)
- Added a little more of all the seasonings above
- Added garlic powder to my ricotta/mozz mix
- Definitely need a higher pan, my 9x13 was over flowing

Enjoy! This recipe was amazing

LOVED this!  I used coconut oil to cook the onion and garlic, used 2/3 spinach and 1/3 kale, and one yellow squash and one zucchini.  Walmart sells cubed butternut squash in a 4 C bag with microwave directions to cook it in the package, which was really convenient.  Next time I'll cut the squashes up smaller for my picky son.

This recipe get 5 stars for being a tasty healthier alternative to a typical lasagna.  My husband is not a squash fan but he still ate this.  I used onion powder in place of onion.  I steamed my butternut squash instead of microwaving because I have read that it retains more nutrients that way.  I also used a little extra mozzarella cheese.

One of the best lasagnas I have ever made and that my father has ever had. I'm still shocked by that compliment from the colonel.
