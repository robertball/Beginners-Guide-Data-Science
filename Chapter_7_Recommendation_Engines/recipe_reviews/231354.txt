I thought I should really write a review for this recipe (my first one!) since I make it at least a couple of times a week.  With apple crisp, peach cobbler, bread pudding, stewed rhubarb or just a spoon - it's delicious.  Sometimes I add less sugar if it's going on something sweet.  We have chickens so in the summer when we're being buried under a landslide of eggs, I will double the number of yolks - still perfect.  Thank you so much for giving the temperature, no more deciding if it is thick enough coating on the back of a spoon or straining my custard because of lumps.  Sometimes I add the brandy and zest and sometimes not - always delicious.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!

This is an excellent sauce.  If you add the zest and extra brandy make sure to let the sauce rest overnight to develop the flavour.

Delicious! I made it while the souffles were baking and I guess - based on belatedly reading the comments below - it'd make more sense to make it the day before and let the flavor develop further overnight. In any case, it was absolutely delicious. Oh, and I didn't have heavy cream, so used half & half - still came out perfectly, if a little more liquid-y. :)

I love your recipes because as much as I screw up recipes, I can't seem to do it with yours. 

I added a pic of mine. I added orange and nutmeg at the end. The thermometer was reading 160f when I decided to strain it.  I also used triple sec. I'm allergic to brandy type alcohols, beers, etc. You know, anything with gluten. 

Also, my heat was at 4 for the most part until it tried to boil and turned it down to 3 for the last minute.
(I thought I over cooked it but I didn't. )I didn't see the color lines until the last minute .   I have a gas range. Keep this in mind when you make it. 

Also, HOLY  IT'S GOOD!

I'd never made creme anglaise before and this couldn't have been easier.  I had all the ingredients on hand and whipped this up quickly.  I used bourbon instead of the orange liqueur and it was perfect.

I used 1/2 tsp vanilla & didn't use liqueur.  Awesome but need to double next time.

I made it as recommended with a substitution of homemade lavender extract in place of vanilla and liquor. The extract is made from 100 blossoms of edible lavender soaked in 100 proof vodka for six weeks. So there is liquor involved. It was lovely. I put it in a shallow dish upon which I put a round of lemon cake filled with raspberry and lemon (separately) curd between layers. I topped it with three fresh raspberries. Very rich and creamy creme anglais. Love it even without the cake.

I added the orange zest and used this sauce over Egg Nog Bread Pudding for a Christmas Brunch.  Absolutely delicious.

One of my favorite ways to use this = drizzle over carrot cake.  YUM.  This is so versatile though, and works for just about anything.  Except ribs.  Gross.

YUM, YUM and more YUM.  The sauce was super easy to make and really delicious.  Waiting until 180 degrees is crucial for the right thickness and full flavor.  The orange and Grand Marnier flavor is wonderful and the small amount of vanilla doesn't overpower it.
We thought we might need extra of this but turns out the recipe is more than enough.

This was delicious and didn’t have any lumps! (I was a little worried since we weren’t tempering the eggs)
Only thing is I wished the recipe had an estimate for the cook-time. If I hadn’t had a thermometer I would’ve been clueless as to when to stop cooking.

I didn't put any orange but did add softened cream cheese, and reduced the sugar.  It was delish with a pear bread pudding that I made.

I made this to top bread pudding and it was delicious. By itself, it was a bit to “eggy” for my taste.

I did not add the orange liqueur or zest. Used vanilla sugar and vanilla extract. The method was so easy and the recipe is right on. Stirred for 10 minutes, strained, cooled and it was TO DIE FOR.
