This was great!!!   Hubby had been asking or Beef Stew so I tried this one!!  Good choice!  I didn't bread the Beef because we don't particularly like that and I was out of flour!!  LOL I made it as is otherwise.  Next time I will add more and different veggies.  We like to experiment.  But this was great as posted!!  Thanks!!

Perfect soup. I thickened with corn starch & water to thicken a little to make more like a thick stew. We loved it!  Just like my mom made for us growing up.

I did not use tomato juice, I used vegetable broth, beef bullion and skipped the frozen veggies and used potatoes, cabbage and carrots. It was delicious served with some sesame french bread and the whole family ate it.

Disappointed! I ended up adding more spices just to add flavour! I don't think I would make it again

Made this stew 3 times now. Tweak it a skittle each a time to my taste. Each time it gets better. Great, easy recipe. Trying your pepper steak tomorrow.

I doubled the stew meat, potatoes and cabbage. With those exceptions, I followed the recipe. I used a slow cooker in which I browned the stew meat and then added the other ingredients. I would decrease the amount of tomato juice required by at least a cup as I am used to beef stew being less soupy. I thought the stew was tasty and I would use the recipe again.

I used fresh veggies, no cabbage, 1 pound meat and added 1/4 cup Sofrito. Hubby says it's the best ever.

Great stew, my family loved it.  I did have to modify it for health reasons, I didn’t use salt but it was still quite tasty.  I would say the other ingredients helped. Also, I used fresh veggies rather than the frozen and my son that hates veggies ate everything.  Thank you for providing this recipe it’s amazing.

This is the way I remember beef stew tasting when I was a kid. This is a very good base recipe. I substituted V8 reduced sodium vegetable  juice for the full-sodium tomato juice and cut back the amount to around 2 - 2.5 cups. I did not decrease the beef broth. As a result, I did not have a lot of juice left over after the meat and veg were gone. It all came out even. I also used no-salt-added diced tomatoes.  Instead of the package of frozen mixed veg, I added chopped carrots, green pepper, and celery along with the potatoes. I kept the leftovers from supper in the crock pot overnight on warm and it tasted even better the next day for lunch.

Made it like the recipe, but added some celery and a little garlic when browning the meat. But did not brown with the flour. Turned out really good. Will be making this again, good for cold days.

I made this for my camping club with rave reviews!  I did add more meat than required and extra garlic.  It was delicious and people begged for the recipe.  This will be my go to beef stew from now on.

I added more meat and I put in a parsnip to add my own touch. Got rave reviews at a pot luck and I am already planning to make this recipe again!
