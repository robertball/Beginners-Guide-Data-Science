So so easy! The hardest part was waiting for it to cool in the fridge. I separated a small part of the peaches & cream into a ramekin and put it into the fridge so I could test it early. I left the rest to chill overnight. :)


I also discovered that a little bit of cinnamon adds so much to the flavor. I agree with Chef John that this dish doesnâ€™t want for sweetness, but go ahead and sprinkle some cinnamon on top! I think any more sugar or vanilla flavoring would be too much. This dish is heavenly as it is.
