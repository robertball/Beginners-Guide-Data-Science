I had access to a thermometer and based on some previous cheese making experience warmed the goat milk up to 195 degrees Fahrenheit. I had never worked with Basil before and as I was cutting it up I was surprised at the strong aroma. I cut back a bit but upon reflection the creaminess of the cheese really does subdue the basil and now wish I had added all the Basil that was called for. Garlic added a nice touch!! Super easy to make!!! I used about 6 pinches of course salt (without additives; like the kind used for pickling). Thanks a bunch for sharing!! Next time I will try with different herb combinations!!

This is absolutely devine! I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings as a trial but next time I will make the entire recipe. I did 4-1/2 cups (1 L) goat's milk 2 tbsp (30 ml) distilled white vinegar 2 heaping tsp fresh chopped basil and 1 large minced garlic. I let it drain too long (became distracted by kids) and it was a little dry. To moisten it up again I added a few teaspoons of whey back into the curd until it had a 'spreadable' consistancy again. This is great with salted crackers. My two year old couldn't get enough of them. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe Ranchgurl! This is going into my Keeper File.

This was my first time making any kind of cheese and it turned out wonderfully! I will definitely be making this again. I followed another review that said to bring the milk to 195 degrees. I couldn't find any cheesecloth at my local grocery store so I used coffee filters lined in a metal strainer and that worked perfectly. Can't wait to try some more herb varieties.

Great! My first time making cheese and it turned out fabulous. My partner bought goat's milk but it was not a pleasurable drink so I figured I better do something else with it! Perfect texture spreadable but still firm.

I made this yesterday but used lemon juice in place of vinegar. I also took the advice of someone else and made sure my temperature reached 195. I didn't want to waste a gallon of milk. It turned out perfect. I plan to use the left over whey today to make ricotta cheese.
