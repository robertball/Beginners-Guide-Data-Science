One of our favorite quick meals now! I do bleu cheese dressing with bleu cheese crumbles with diced mushrooms for the topping.

LAMB chops are amazing with the bleu cheese topping! I prefer to cook my chops to medium rare so the times may have to be adjusted to accommodate the thickness. Emmy this is a great recipe thank you! 5/24/14

I had never made lamb before and I was a little nervous. The recipe was very easy and delicious.

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it! I grilled our chops then spread the cheese/cream spread on one side and broiled them in the toaster oven, along with a couple slices of  Italian bread with the same spread on one side. I served it with steamed broccoli, also mixed with the spread. All delicious!

I was surprised this turned out so well. I wondered if the oven broiling would cook the meat properly but it really was great even for thicker chops (took a little longer). My cheese mixture turned out great too - I cooked it a bit longer and it ran off the meat and made a delicious brown gravy.

Worked extremely well.  Used gorganzola, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Very easy and tasty.  Cheese topping would also work well on broiled steak.
