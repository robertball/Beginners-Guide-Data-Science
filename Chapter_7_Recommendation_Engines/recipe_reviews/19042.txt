This is a wonderful ice cream recipe. I used my 1-qt. ice cream freezer and it worked very well. This ice cream stays relatively soft in the freezer (if there's any left over, that is) so you don't have to get it out ahead of time to let it soften. DELICIOUS! (Update: I tried it today with caramel sauce instead of chocolate -- scrumptious. Can't wait to try strawberry ice cream topping -- or even . . . well the choices are endless now.)

I think this was a good idea for people who don't have ice cream machines. This ice cream is pretty sweet, because of all the sweetened condensed milk. I Would cut down a little on the sweetened condensed milk next time I make this. But overall pretty good.

I have found that tossing this into my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker is a quick solution to needing a  desert ASAP.  It tastes like a more elegant version of Wendy's Frosty's.  My family loves it!

ok, for those who experience problem like i do - ice cream wont freeze - u need to take it out, beat using electric mixer at high speed and re-freeze. perhaps next time reduce the condensed milk and avoid using hersheys choc syrup..some said if the content of sugar is too high, it wont freeze.

I have been making this recipe for 25 years and still love it!  It's creamy, tasty, easy and quick.  Now that I have a Cuisinart Ice Cream maker, I combine all the ingredients and put it in the ice cream maker...no whipping the cream.

I love this ice cream.  My family makes this, but we have always added mini marshmellows and chopped up almonds to make Rocky Road.  It is so creamy and delicious!

This was delicious! Everyone loved it! I made half da recipe and I couldn't use choc syrup cuz we never by em. I used cocoa instead and it was great! My parents said its real sweet but they still liked it. My sisters and I love it and I was just eating some a while ago :D. I made this in a matter of minutes in our ice cream machine. This was our first "proper" ice cream we made! This is definitely a keeper! Thx for posting the recipe!

Very simple, very sweet!  The third time I made this I just added the ingredients into a 1qt. plasic bowl with a tight lid and shook it for two minutes. I found it needed to be stired every two hours twice, then froze overnight.

YUMMY!!! Tastes like a heavenly smoother version of a Wendy's frosty, only 10 x better!! My husband made this in a matter of minutes in our ice cream machine and even the neighbours were lining up with spoons after someone bragged about my hubby's homemade ice cream!  Terrific recipe and highly recommended for kids to help, too!! Thanks a bunch!!

Very yummy with few steps.  I have had better chocolate ice cream, so I'm not rating it 5 stars, but it is close.  I made mine in my ice cream maker.  One important tip: refrigerate your canned sweetened condensed milk and your chocolate syrup ahead of time so you get the ice cream colder quicker than using those items at room temperature.

I have been making this recipe for years.  I pour the mixture into ready-made pie crusts for an ice cream pie.  Makes enough for 2 pie crusts, so I always have one on hand 'in case of emergency'.  I usually buy one graham cracker and one oreo crust.  Great recipe and everyone loves it!

I agree with the Frosty comment, and it definitely is VERY sweet. Since I didn't have any choc syrup I made a substitute of it using choc baking cocoa- which made my ice cream taste a bit like frozen choc frosting- not that my husband and I minded :o)

Delicious! Used a darker chocolate syrup to make less sweet. Made into strawberry  ice cream with strawberry jam and syrup and diced strawberries. Will try plain with vanilla next time. Very creamy! Made into ice cream pie

YUMMY! Thanks for posting this delicious recipe. Just made it with kids for a treat. After reading reviews, made substitutions of 1c half and half, used baking cocoa and fat free condensed milk. Mixed up well and tastes delicious. Waiting for it to freeze.

The consistency is not like a true ice cream.  This is a clone of a Wendy's frosty.  Easy, delicious and tastes wonderful. Made it in my Cuisinart ice cream maker.

This is fantastic....I halved the recipe and made chocolate with mini chips and raspberry (just using jam) and it was DELICIOUS! Wouldn't change a dang thing except to add all sorts of goodies to the basic recipe ;) For those of you who may be wondering....1/2 can of sweetened condensed milk (for splitting the recipe) is just short of 3/4 of a cup. My neighbors and myself think this is the best EVER! (not to mention so easy)

Exceptional!! I did not use chocolate syrup however, I dribbled Nuttela Hazelnut spread and added a tsp of vanilla. This recipe gives a person the freedom to add whatever they like. We love it and it s now in our family recipe book. Thank you so much for sharing!

Wow! This is really sweet! It's basically frozen chocolate whipped cream. It's not terrible, but not that exciting either.

This worked great especially since I do not have an ice cream maker, and this is a bad time of the year to find them in stores.  I did have to add milk because the ice cream tasted like I had squirted chocolate syrup in my mouth (which is great, but not the taste I was going for).  I also took out the ice cream every two hours for six hours and beat the mixture with an electric beater.  It turned out great!  I am actually getting ready to make this for a second time with the help of my two year old.  This recipe is so easy for kids to help out with too!

This was my first attempt at homemade ice cream. I found this recipe to be very easy. I read all the reviews first and made some changes to the ingredients. I used 1 c. of whipping cream and 1 c. of half and half instead of 2 c. of whipping cream. I also used 1/3 c. of Hersey's unsweetened coco instead of the syrup. I really enjoyed the flavor and the ice cream didn't seem to be real rich like some of the reviews. It was a huge success with my family. The texture was excellent and creamy.

Not bad tasting, just not really ice cream.  Like others said, it was exactly like a Wendy's frosty in consistency and taste.  I cut back the syrup to a 1/2 a cup since others said it was too sweet and subbed half and half for the heavy cream.  I just mixed the ingredients with a whisk and then dumped into my ice cream maker.  It was still very sweet, so I might try omitting the sweetened condensed milk next time.

This ice cream was pretty good, though not nearly as good as Wendy's Frostys. It had a distictive syrup taste but made it up with its ultra-smooth and creamy consistensy.

This is definitely a recipe to keep around. Very simple, and easy. I changed a couple things, though. I used 2/3 cup of Smucker's Hot Fudge topping instead of Hershey's chocolate syrup. I had read in a previous review that there was too much sugar content in the Hershey's for a proper freeze. The Smucker's has 3g less sugar in it, so it did help a bit. I also added about 1 cup of miniature semi-sweet chocolate chips. I added them after everything was mixed and folded together, just before freezing. We tried it after only an hour in the freezer and it had hardened enough in places to take a taste. It was delicious! We will definitely use this again!

Pretty good. Does taste similar to Wendy's chocolate frosty, but reminds me more of a thick chocolate mousse or chocolate pudding.

This is better than ANY of the expensive ice creams you buy!!   So-o-o-o creamy!!  You could use fruit in place of the choc. syrup or add oreos or candy pieces.  So versatile.  I can't get over how creamy it was coming out of my freezer!!  I'll never need an ice cream freezer.

Love, love, love it!!!  Soooo easy and soooo yummy!  When I make this recipe I use the three ingredients but DO NOT follow the method.  I mix everything up and pour it into my Deni ice cream maker...how easy is that?  It always comes out wonderfully.  My family loves it!

WOW!! Really easy and very tasty.  We did not find it too sweet at all. I don't care for Wendys food so I have never had a Frosty. To me it tastes like a chocolate milkshake that has melted and  partially refrozen.I made it exactly as written and froze it over night. Delish!

Other than being very simple to make, this ice cream recipe is just waaaaaaaaaay too sweet.  I was worried about it being sweet but I tried it anyway and I was right.  Maybe unsweetened chocolate (melted) or unsweetened cocoa powder next time.  Not recommend it.

My son was asking for chocolate ice cream so I went looking for a recipe that was not only easy enough that he could help make but also used what I had on hand. 

Only thing I changed was use half-n-half.
I used my blender to combine everything. Really, really easy. Reminds me of Five Minute Ice Cream.

Both he and I tried a little of it. It tastes just like a Wendy's Frosty! He and I can't wait for it to be finished.

I love this ice cream. I make this recipe with half the sweetened condensed milk; combining all three ingredients and then beating with a mixer. I also put in a 9 by 9 pan and freezing overnight (in an ordinary freezer). Still, its great ice cream any way you make it!

Just three ingredients....beautiful simplicity!!  Give it a try.  I have a Kitchen Aid ice cream maker and I pour the mixture in for 30 minutes and it comes out like soft serve.  It's in the freezer and will be eaten before you know it!

Too syrupy sweet for my family.  I tried it in my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker and it didn't set up -- which is my own fault.  Just not the right Chocolate Ice Cream recipe for me.

This was definetly easy...which is what I was going for on the particular day I was making it.  The kids loved it.  I found it a bit rich.  I will likely look for another chocolate ice cream recipe for those days when I have more time.  But, for a quick easy recipe with only thre ingredients I was pleased.

We've done this recipe a few times and everyone loves it.  I followed the recipe the first time, but wasn't happy with the texture of the ice cream. The cream and syrups weren't mixed well enough.  Also, I'm not sure what the tin foil accomplished other than to annoy me.  After that, I've used my ice cream maker to churn it, and it's much better.  The texture is smooth and creamy.  This couldn't be any easier.

This recipe would be great for kids, easy and fun to make. The end result is OK, but seems more like a mousse rather than ice cream. It has a very distinct chocolate syrup flavor, and the texture is far too "fluffy" to pass for ice cream. Again, it isn't bad, just not what I would make when craving ice cream.

Absolutely divine!  I used a homemade chocolate sauce from Williams Sonoma cookbook and added some chopped peanut butter cups.  It stayed smooth and creamy everytime we pulled it out of the freezer - never hard.

This is delicious and not too sweet at all.  I'm thinking the people who are saying it is too sweet did not whip their cream enough.  I whipped my cream for a good 8min with a mixer until it reached whip cream consistancy.

I didn’t like the soft texture and taste of the ice cream. The mixture is extremely rich and a few substitutions should be made. After eating two or three tablespoons I had to drink large quantities of water to get rid of the thick and creamy residue. However I will give this recipe 3 stars because it looks nice in a bowl.

This was easy and we all loved it.  I will definitely make this again.    It has the consistency of soft-serve.  I read one of the reviews and lowered the temperature in the freezer.  I gave it a 4 out of 5 because the taste of the syrup is very pronounced.  You can tell it is made with syrup, and not baking chocolate or cocoa powder.

OK... the flavor was ok. I used cocoa instead of syrop to cut back on the sweetness and I found it just sweet enough. I noticed many people commenting on how it was too sweet. I'd like to add that my BF found it slightly under sweetened with the cocoa. I'd suggest playing around with the amount of syrop/cocoa to control the sweetness to your liking. I added a tsp of both cinnamon and cayenne to turn it into a nice mexican chocolate which was very nice, but tasting it before adding those ingredients was nice and chocolately. The thing I didn't like about this dessert was the texture. It's too foamy. You don't get that nice cold mouth feel that should come with ice cream. Like when you eat cold and creamy frozen spoonful and you can feel it slowly melt to a liquid in your mouth. It's more like a frozen whipped cream, for sure. It melts back to whipped cream, aswell. So, flavour was good, but the texture was 2 stars.

Husband complained it didn't have traditional "grainy texture" of homemade ice cream - that's the best part!  Very smooth, flavorful, doesn't take much to satisfy sweet tooth.  OUTSTANDING.

This is the best! You don’t have to mix the condensed milk and chocolate syrup together before hand you can pour them right into the whipped cream and it tastes the same. Used this to make peanut butter ice cream and other variations. You can omit the chocolate and add whatever you want!

This recipe was easy, especially with a stand mixer. I used the metal mixing bowl in the freezer, then mixed everything again two hours later, and it was ready to eat four hours after starting.

I gave it four stars because to me it had a bit of an oily feel, and slight aftertaste. But my husband LOVED it.

I love this recipe.  My only suggestion  is add am additional cup of heavy cream, or milk because  it is a little too sweet. I think this is a better suggestion  than using less sweetened  condensed  milk because  it will also make a larger quantity.

Was made in an Ice cream maker.  Was the consistency of a Milk shake when done and then placed in the freezer at 1 degree Fahrenheit for about 8 hours. Came out nice and had a great flavor.

So easy and so rich and creamy!  Instead of chocolate syrup, I added 2 TB cocoa and then mixed in crushed oreos, poured it in an oreo cookie crust....ice cream oreo pie!  Yum!

It's great as written, but my modification is cutting the chocolate syrup in half, and adding 1/3 cup strong espresso.

I made this ice cream but as mentioned it was very sweet and I confused "heavy cream" for old fashioned cream in Quebec instead of whipping cream  It wasn't too bad but not the right thing. So  for us Canadians please say Whipping cream.

Didn't really love this recipe. The syrup gives it a fake chocolate taste and the sweetened condensed milk gives it an unpleasant sour milk aftertaste.

I made this exactly as the recipe is written (so I can give it a fair rating). It's good, but it's rather sweet (my daughter wouldn't eat it for this reason and she LOVES sweets) and I had a hard time getting the whipped topping fully mixed in...I had topping lumps when I had some...not a problem for me though! It may have mixed up better if I'd used a mixer instead of folding it in by hand maybe. I might try making some homemade chocolate syrup so I can cut back on the sugar a little to cut the sweetness, or maybe try special dark cocoa. I also think maybe just a touch less whipped topping might give it a better texture. All in all, this is great if you don't have an ice cream maker and want homemade ice cream. It's similar to a recipe my mom made occasionally when I was a kid. I think it might also be great for an ice cream cake or pie. Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make it again!

I used to make this for my kids but lost the recipe. Thank you, my grandkids love making this special "Grandma's Ice Cream" I will try the rocky road version next time.
