I don't understand the negative reviews either. I too have made this dish over and over again and everyone who eats it absolutely loves it! The flavor has just the right amount of "kick". Many of my friends who have tried it have asked for the recipe. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I have to agree with previous comments.  The seasoning is not very flavorful and doesn't really compliment the pork.  I would leave out the sage and creole seasoning and add in some red pepper flakes, onion powder and thyme.

These are a very good (and fast) weeknight meal!  I don't like pork chops fried with flour, so I eliminated the flour, and substituted cumin for the sage, which i think goes better with the other seasonings.  Also, I never fry boneless chops (too dry) so used bone-in instead.  Browned them up in a hot cast-iron skillet, and they were delicious!

These cajun pork chops were out of this world, my family was looking for more after dinner. I added a little more cayenne pepper because we like spicy food. It was delish....

This is probably my favorite way that I've ever had prok chops.  I added double of everything except flour and paprika because we like things extra spicy.  I double dipped them in the flour mixture (flour, milk, flour) and allowed them to rest for about 30 minutes before cooking them.  I cooked them in an iron skillet with only 1 TB of olive oil, but I did spray the pan liberally with Pam first so it would not soak up all of the oil.  They cooked for about 6 minutes on each side for a 1/2 inch thick chop.  Wonderful!

These were very good, the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because we were expecting it to be a little spicier. Had a nice mild flavor, recipe followed to the letter. Easy enough to make, I also made 5 good sized chops and still had enough season to cover at least 2 more. I will make again. Thanks.

Definitely would make again! I had to make a couple of modifications - I didnt have either sage or cumin (which someone here mentioned as a substitute), which I omitted, and I didnt have any cayenne pepper so I doubled the Cajun spice mix; consequently, the pork chops were a bit milder heat-wise than a true Cajun flavor (I consider it hot if my lips go numb, lol). 

Someone posted that there was enough breading to coat more like 8 than 4 chops - I'm not sure if the recipe has been modified since this comment was made, but I had the perfect amount of breading for three good-sized bone-in chops...definitely not enough for 8!

I also believe, like someone mentioned, that the oil amount was a typo. No way would that be enough oil to cook these.

I also used almond flour in place of regular flour (husband is diabetic and this cuts back on the carbs).  Great flavor! Hubs ate two! :)

These were excellent.  The only thing I omitted was the sage and creole seasoning.  I just didn't have any on hand.  I did use 1 tbsp. bread crumbs and 1 tsp. red pepper flakes.  These were very delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Nothing to write home about - did exactly as recipe stated and pork chops ended up tough and not very seasoned.  I had to sprinkle extra creole seasoning to get any flavor while eating dinner.  Probably wouldn't waste the $$$ on the pork chops to do this recipe again.

I used 1" thick boneless pork chops instead of 1/2" and I didn't have any sage. I cooked them 10 minutes on each side and they came out nice and tender. However being a Cajun myself next time I cook these I will use double the amount of Cajun seasoning and cayenne these were pretty bland to me and my wife.

I made this recipe exactly as written. (The flour I used was unbleached, and the olive oil was extra virgin.) I fried the chops for the full 8 minutes.
This was a pretty tasty recipe. My quibbles are with the amounts of the ingredients. When I shook the chops in the bag, they were pretty well-coated, I thought. And still there was a lot of the flour/spice mix left. It looked like the amount could coat 6 or even as many as 8 chops, not just 4. Also, the "2 teaspoons" of olive oil looked like too little - perhaps it was a typo for "2 tablespoons"? If I make this again, I'll try 3 teaspoons instead of just 2.
But those are secondary issues - the taste of the dish was very good.

I thought 1 tsp of ground sage sounded way too much, so I halved it, and decided I should have omitted it altogether. I added a little bit of salt, and did them on the Foreman grill. They were good but not outstanding. Thanks anyway.

These were just OK.  I didn't dislike them, but also didn't think they were that good either.  I don't think I'll be making or serving these again.  But, they were very easy to make.

Wow these were great!  I make fried pork chops all the time and these proved to be better, AND made less of a mess.  I have a new fried pork chop recipe!  (I left out the sage becuase I didnt have any and they were still delicious.)

This recipe provided a quick, easy way to cook up delicious pork chops. I used bone-in chops and let them cook a little longer. They were really good.

Our local grocery had pork loin on sale, so my freezer is filled to bursting with boneless chops.  Used half-inch ones for this delicious recipe -- they turned out juicy and just spicy enough to please my husband and me.  I'll make this quick recipe again.

I made this for the first time a couple of weeks ago and omitted the sage as I did not have any on hand. The chops were a huge hit with my husband and parents. Since, I've used the flour/seasoning (minus sage) for thin sliced chicken breasts and it was just as big a hit as the chops. An new family favorite.

Made it according to directions with one minor unexpected change. Was out of Sage, substituted with Thyme.
Absolutive incredible. Whoa, what a Cayenne kick! Perfect. Can't wait to do it again!!

Yum!  Lots of flavor!  I used smoked paprika, added 1/2 tsp of salt, and reduced the cayenne pepper slightly.  We thought it was plenty spicy!

Really good!  We like spicy food so I added more cayenne pepper.  My first time cooking pork, and I'm now a convert.

Hubby and I really enjoyed this recipe. I also doubled the ingredience,but I doubled all of them even the flour. I, also, double dipped (flour,milk,flour). My pork chops were self cut from a tenderloin. So,they were 1" to 1 1/2".So, I had to use more oil and cook longer. They are not tender but not too tough either. I guess if I wanted them tender, I would jab/stick them with a fork several times; before flouring and frying them. Will definately make again.

I was in a rush so I found this and it was a real hit! I was out of paprika and used cumin instead and it wasn't overpowering at all. I will make this again and again.

This recipe has no marinating recommendation? I think for meat to really get the flavour of its seasoning you need to put it in the fridge for 2-6 hours or overnight is best. Also 1/2 a teaspoon of cayenne won't give you a spicy recipe you need double that if you like it spicy! Be careful not to over spice it though.

I love this recipe.  It is very tasty.  The only thing I did differently is I soaked the chops in buttermilk for 2 hours before doing anything else, this was to help tenderize them, as I have trouble digesting pork...

I also tried these pork chops and found them a little bland on the seasoning.  Could have used salt and needed some heat.
