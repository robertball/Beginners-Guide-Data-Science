I used dill pickles instead of sweet and grapes instead of apples. The crushed red pepper is a key ingredient, very faint taste, but a great addition. I also found that one onion is a little too much, especially on the 2nd day of the salad after the flacvor has intensified. I get compliments and requests for the receipe everywhere I take it. Great idea for showers.

i made this for a baby shower and it went over quite well. the only thing i changed was adding a bit more mayonnaise, as i like my chicken salad a bit more moist. i also added a little extra almonds and apple bits to add extra crunch the day i served it. i'll definitely use it again.

I used equal amounts chopped garlic dills in this recipe instead of sweet pickles. I did add a little onion powder, garlic powder and some fresh ground pepper. After mixing up the salad with the mayonnaise, I did add a little more mayonnaise than what was asked for to make it a little wetter. All of us really liked this chicken salad, it was inexpensive to make, was hearty and filling and there were NO leftovers. I'll make this again.

Omitted the crushed red pepper.  I wasn't sure about the pickles, but the apples gave it a great crunch.  A little heavy on the onion and I only used 1/2 of one medium sized one.  Almonds were an extra special touch.  I had grilled chicken already cooked so I used that instead of the boiled chicken.  Thanks!
