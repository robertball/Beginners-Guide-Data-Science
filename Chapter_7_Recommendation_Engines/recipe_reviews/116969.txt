I usually just mix the sauce into the beef because I forget to marinade it, but it doesn't matter--these are very good! I think mixing the sauce in with the beef patties keeps them light and has a cooked-on-the-grill taste!

I do not care for legitimate complaints about a recipe being edited. If there is no point in the 1 1/4 cups of barbecue sauce listed in the patty portion of the ingredients, perhaps it should not be there.

My boyfriend said " these were the best burgers he has ever eaten.' hands down. I did change it a bit. I did use 3/4 cup bread crumbs, and only 1/2 cup bbq sauce as I thought 1/4 was too much. I also did not drain the bbq sauce and I pan fried the burgers for 5 minutes on each side. Then added thick slices of smoked cheddar and put a lid on the pan for 2 minutes) I toasted, and heavily buttered the buns, then fried them in the pan with the burger for a few minutes. MMMMM it was so good. better than any burger I've had out and I live in NYC!

We follow this recipe to a T and it is AMAZING!!  Let the dressing for the burger set in the fridge for a couple hours and it blends the flavors together nicely. And we add bacon to ours, which you cant ever go wrong with. This recipe always impresses all the burger lovers we know.

I made this recipe last week for myself and the boyfriend.  We both agreed that this burger tastes better than some of the burgers we've had out at restaurants.  I liked the addition of smoked cheddar...it gave the burgers that extra touch of the "something special" that made these stand out from an ordinary burger.  The grill ran out of gas so I fried them up in a frying pan on the stove and they still tasted great.  Very moist and the sweet onions were to die for!

I only used one onion and had more than enough onions.  Two probably would have been too much.

Unless you like your burger sitting in a puddle of sauce, you can cut the bbq/mayo sauce recipe in half.  I still have a container of it sitting in my refrigerator (tasted great on the bbq chicken sandwiches I made last night though!)

For the most part I made this recipe as written - I changed the smoked cheddar to provolone (what I had on hand).  Here are the issues I had when making these burgers:  it says to mix the crumbs, onion salt & brown sugar, then add the egg, crumble in the beef & mix.  This method made it very hard to get the bread crumbs mixed in evenly, I had to really work it into the beef and the burgers ended up quite "compact" - my method would be to crumble the beef into a shallow dish, sprinkle the crumbs, onion salt & brown sugar over it, then pour the beaten egg over it and mix as little as possible, and form into burgers.  I liked the marinating in BBQ sauce, but the minute I put them on the grill over meadium heat the sauce started to burn, so I turned the heat off on that side and turned the other side up to high (indirect heat method).  That worked well.  We didn't even use half of the sauce mixture, so I would recommend cutting that down.  Now the onion topping:  What a mess.  I usually carmelize onions with a little bit of sugar, and I was wishing I had just gone about it my usual way.  These turned out way too sweet, with too much "sauce" in with the onions.  Very sloppy.  I threw them away, and we waited to eat until I had done my usual carmelized onions:  2 large onions, 3 Tbsp. butter, and 2 Tbsp. sugar.  Other than these changes, hubby and I both loved these, and I'll make them again!  Good flavor!

Very good!  The husband enjoyed them too.  They remind me of a "western" burger we get at a local restaurant here in town.  Note:  I did not have any fresh or frozen onions so I just used some french fried onions for the topping.  VERY good!

This was an extraordinary burger. A little messy trying to eat it and hard to keep sauce off your fingers, but hey, it was delicious! I didn't have onion salt so I used half onion powder and half sea salt and made my own. I used Bullseye Kansas City style sauce and shredded cheese. DH outdid himself on the grill with this burger. Thanks!

5 stars is not enough for how good these are!  I only used egg yolks so that I wasn't adding too much moisture to the meat mixture.  I also used homemade breadcrumbs so that I wouldn't get a super dry texture to the burger.  Just amazing.  Definitely use smoked cheddar...the depth of flavor is essential.  Oh, I also used about 1/8 c. of agave nectar in the onions in lieu of the honey so that it lowered the glycemic index of this indulgence!  :-)

OMG! These were awesome! We have soooo much venison burger meat in our freezer and I don't really like regular burgers made from ground venison....this was the perfect thing!!! The sauce recipe made way too much sauce though-Im sure you could easily cut that part in half and still have tons of sauce to put on the burger. Didn't have the smoked cheese-although that sounds good-subbed colby jack slices. Used Hunt's bold bbq sauce (never had it before but it worked for this-our norm is sweet baby rays)

I did not make the mayo sauce to go with it, as hubby hates mayo. I did spread BBQ sauce on both sides of the bun before putting them together. And I still got plenty of groans and moans as he was chowing down these burgers! They were outstanding!!  In the words of my hubby, "These are a definite do-over".

These were great!  I did not have smoked cheese, but regular cheddar worked fine also.  My husband did not like the onions sauteed with honey (something about how meat doesn't go with sweet), but I liked them (and I don't generally like onions).  The BBQ and mayo sauce was very good, we both really liked that.  I will make this again.

These are delicious! I used less BBQ sauce and just mixed it right in the burger - they were moist and juicy and awesome. I ended up with way more onions than we wanted to top the burgers with, so I'd make less next time.

Best Burger EVER!! I followed the recipe exactly, but I chose pan frying vs grilling. Its worth the marination step DONT SKIP it. The portion of onions may seem like a bit much but after you try them its not enough. A+++

These were very good! I did not have onion salt, so I just used 1 teaspoon salt instead. The onion topping was great. I ended up cooking my onions for about 30 minutes, because I was waiting on my oven fries. The fries were good dipped in the topping too!

These were quite good. The onions and sauce were super yummy -ooey and gooey! The only thing I did not care for was the smoked cheddar. I think next time I will try adding liquid smoke into the patties themselves and just use regular cheddar cheese.

do not like the wording in the recipe. i made the mistake of mixing the bbq sauce with burger ingredients, and that led to the burgers falling apart when grilled. im sure they would have turned out better, had i made them correctly. if you want to try this recipe, be sure that you want an extra sweet burger. it was almost too sweet, and i didnt even end up making the the sauce topping.

I have never been a fan of bbq sauce, but I made these for guests and they were fantastic! The only change I made was mixing in 1/2 cup bbq sauce into the burger mix instead of spreading on top just because I made them a few hours ahead of time and stacked them between pieces of foil. I also had bacon on hand so I put 2 slices on each burger. Will be making these often this summer!

i usually end up disappointed with these online recipes, but this time i actually had to sign up to say that this was delicious! I used the sauce and onions on my veggie burgers and the taste blended so well with my molasses-drenched baked beans and the potato salad. Veggie burgers with taste! Thanks for the recipe!
