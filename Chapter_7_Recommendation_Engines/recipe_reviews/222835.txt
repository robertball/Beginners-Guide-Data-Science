Every one loved, even though it was super hot!  I think next time I'll try cutting back on the spices slightly.  I added some extra virgin olive oil to the butter, and cut the amount of butter in half.  I also used Tilapia instead of the catfish, because that's what I had on hand.  I also added a bag of jumbo shrimp, already deveined but with the tails on.  For the side I had asparagus.  I placed the tilapia and shrimp together on a baking sheet on tin foil, and the asparagus, to the side of it, but in the same pan.  I baked in a 400 degree F. preheated oven for approximately 20 minutes.  
The rice I had pre-made and reheated back up in a steamer container in the microwave (took about 4 minutes) and timed it so every thing would be done at the same time.

I was not expecting this to be anything special, but after the first bite I found I was in for a surprise!  My picky husband and I have very different tastes and we both LOVED this dish--he said it's one of the best things I've ever cooked (I consider myself a decent cook).  I came on looking for a different recipe for blackened catfish that we use whenever we find catfish on sale, stumbled on this recipe, and I don't think we'll ever go back to the other recipe!  I did only use about 3 Tbs butter and that was plenty.  High marks from our house!

This recipe makes more rub than is needed for the 4 filets (16 oz.) I wanted to cook. The blend of seasonings was very good but it was too much heat for us even with reducing the pepper and cayenne to 3/4 t. (Next time will reduce to 1/2 t and use less salt.) I coated the filets with 1/4c melted butter, sprinkled the rub on both sides then baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 mins. Part way through I turned the fish, drizzled with the remaining butter and finished baking until flaky.

The fish was very well received, if a little greasy and the rice needed a bit of butter. All in all, this is a new family favorite!

This came out well - simple for even a novice.  They just have to keep an eye on the fish, so it turns out flakey and moist.

Will use some Extra-light Olive Oil when cooking the fish, and halve the butter, next time.   There will still be enough butter, after basting the fillets, to add to the pan to help impart that smoothness.  It was good, and all, but we like to use a lot of pan sauce over the rice and fish and it was very buttery.  Using the Extra-light OO would cut some of the extra calories and such, yet still allow the great flavors to come through.

Quick and easy and loved the spice. Added red pepper flakes. Used 1/2 the butter with some EVOO. Yum

This recipe is so good. It’s very spicy so, if you are meek about hot food, then you better cut back a bit. The rice was a beautiful compliment to the fish. I couldn’t find my powdered onion so I used Adobo. It was a perfect substitute. I didn’t drizzle any butter on top as I thought it was already hardy enough.  I did use the lemon and that tied it all together.

Really delicious! I love the spice combination on the fish! Only changes: I reduced the cayenne to 1/2 tsp (we wanted a little less of a kick), didn't add onion powder (none in the spice rack), and went for fresh minced garlic (4 cloves) over garlic powder. 

I definitely recommend going for fresh garlic. The way it cooked into the blackened fish was a great, strong flavor. This was also a great recipe for our cast-iron skillet. I served it with roasted corn on the cob. We'll definitely be making it again!

I made the spice rub exactly as shown and we all loved it!  Yes, it has a kick, but boy oh boy was it yummy! I had four catfish fillets left over and was tired   of deep fat frying.  This seemed more healthful and allowed the flavor of the catfish to shine through, complemented by the mixture of spices. No rice for us tonight.  Just fish, fantastic!  I did used a dribble of olive oil and sesame oil in the cast iron skillet instead of more butter. Thank you for the recipe!

This just didn't work for us. The flavors just seemed off.
