Delicious chicken! I had too cook it for about 35-40 minutes, not 20-25, but other than that the recipe was simple to make and tasted excellent.

We LOVED this easy to make delicious recipe!  It was quick, simple, and tasted unbelievable!  My family is sooooo picky, and they'd never willingly eat ranch dressing.  But because they couldn't see it, it wasn't an issue.  They just kept saying how delicious it was, and how much flavor it had!  I cut my chicken pieces smaller, more like tenders, which obviously meant I was going to need more breading, so I tripled the amount.  Definitely bake it on parchment so you can get all of that cheesy goodness off the pan!  The chicken was nice and juicy, and the cheese and panko got nice and crunchy.  The ranch underneath almost tasted like there was a sauce on it.  Will DEFINITELY be a goto meal, especially when I'm in a rush!

Yes, made this and turned out delicious. Use foil or parchment on bottom of pan for easier cleanup as the cheese melts and sticks to it.  My friends enjoyed this recipe very much and was moist and had good flavor.

This recipe was not Good, The measurements were off, and the breadcrumbs didn't stick to the chicken well...The only thing I liked about this recipe, is the flavor of the chicken. Will not be making again.

Did not have ranch so I substituted Creamy Caesar. Breasts were large and thick so an additional 10 minutes were needed. Flavor was super.

Very tasty & moist.  I had to bake it 35-40 mins. When I checked chicken after 25 mins., it was raw inside. Also, I mixed all the ingredients (except butter) together to coat chicken. Yumm!

The recipe sounds amazing, and maybe I did something wrong, but it didn't turn out very well. First, the cheddar cheese didn't stick to the chicken at all. Second, the coating on some of the pieces of chicken came out a little burned, while others were very soggy. I've used mayo as a binder before and I made sure to get the excess ranch off the chicken before breading it to avoid the sogginess. Next time I try this, I'm going to mix half mayo and half ranch. I'm also going to try cooking at a lower temp to avoid uneven cooking.

Simple and fast!! I for once was amazed at the flavor. My kids loved it. Make sure to use the parchment paper it helps the melted cheese come right off which is the best part!!!

This was really good. I only had plain Panko so I added a little season-all, pepper, and smoked paprika to the crumb mixture. Will definitely make this again.

My family enjoys this recipe.  It is very similar to the one I have made over the years.   I use an addition one cup of panko to completely cover each chicken breast.
