This was insane!  Okay, if you are watching you waistline, keep looking for a different recipe but if not then this is something I for sure recommend!  The only change I made to the recipe was to add an extra 1/2 cup of pecans to the top.  SOOO good!  Everyone at dinner devoured it.  I was worried it would be too sweet (and it was sugary), but it worked out really well in the end.  YUM!  :)

I am from Indiana. My aunt introdused this recipe to the family some 35 years ago when I was a little girl. We have all used it at differnt Fall gatherings. Some have thought it to be served at dessert but we say no it goes right along with the main meal.

Recipe Group Selection:  05, November '11   This is very similar to other sweet potato casseroles that I've had.  I baked mine in the toaster oven, but baked for 35 minutes rather than 25 and let rest for about 10 minutes before serving.  It held it's shape great when served on the plates.  My sweet potato hating husband asked if it was something pumpkin.  I said "yes" and he really liked it and had 2 helpings.  I will never tell him what he really ate! I love to try receipes from Indiana since that is where I'm from.  This was a little on the sweet side, but very good none the less.

I made this for Recipe Group and followed others reviews and cut the butter and sugar both in half, while still quite sweet this was tasty. Could even pass as sweet potato pie filling in my opinion especially with the topping. I recommend using a shallow 2qt. dish not a deep one, to spread the topping out. Definitely a nice alternative to the usual marshmallowed version.

Made for Recipe Group. I actually didn't find the sweet potatoes to  be overly sweet. The topping however was very sweet and crunchy. I subbed in walnuts being out of pecans, it was just as good. In fact the topping was the best part of this. I cooked it for 30 minutes as it didn't seem to be set. It was runnier than I thought it should be with eggs in it. When I scooped out for plating the rest 'oozed in' to fill the void. Taste wise for me this just doesn't do it. Thanks for the recipe.

This was not one of the better sweet potato casseroles I have eaten. It is extremely sweet. The topping is a bit thin. A thicker layer would have been better. Also, I had to cook it much longer than 25 min. for it to set. All in all, I will use my stand by recipe instead of this one in the future.

Made this for Recipe Group and it was ok, but VERY sweet! For some reason, my mixture was a little on the runny side too, but once baked it firmed up into a custard-y type thing, which was good, but I agree w/ others that said that there was too much sugar. Oh, also I only used 1/4 cup of butter in the base part b/c  I thought 1/2 cup would be too much for only 2 cups of potatoes. I'm glad I reduced it b/c there was a little pool of grease that formed around the edges, so I couldn't have imagined using the whole amount in there. We liked the topping and the overall flavor was good, but I don't know that I would make this particular version again. Thanks for sharing.

Recipe Group selection of 11/5/11.  I am sorry, but this was much too sweet for our taste.  As I was reading the recipe I had it in mind to only use half the sugar in both the base and the topping, but I got busy and my DD whipped the yams for me and followed the recipe.  After tasting, I think I would omit the sugar in the base and just use half the brown sugar with the pecans if I were to make it again.

Delicious!  All I did was substitute walnuts instead of pecans and squeezed the juice of half a fresh orange into the mix before baking.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Use a 8Ã—11 dish. Double the topping. Cook for 30-35 min. Heavenly!
