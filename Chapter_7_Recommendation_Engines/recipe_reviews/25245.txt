Made salmon patties a stand out meal. Also really liked it on sliced tomatos. I also added another 1/2 tsp. dill and used a little less mustard and a little more mayo than recipe specified.

Great dill sauce - I love the dijon mustard flavor and you can adjust it to your liking.

A great alternative to plain old tartar sauce.  This recipe makes more than enough.  Next time I'll cut it in half.  Very tasty!

This was excellent...however a little too spicy for me. I think I just should have got a less spicy dijon, however, I simply added 2 tablespoons of honey and it cut the spiciness perfectly..

i made this recipe without the buttermilk and it still tasted great. the more dijon mustard you use, the spicier it will be. i was trying to re-create the veggie sandwiches from Atlanta Bread Company,using the dill sauce and it tasted pretty similar.

I was nervous when I first made this as it was for company, I thought I was way too mustardy, but once poured over baked salmon was really quite good.  I didn't quite use 1/2 cup of mustard, probably closer to 1/3 cup.  Made very large quantity.  I had salmon for 4 people and threw out probably 2/3 of sauce afterwards.  Next time I might cut recipe in half.

THis is fantastic.  I went halibut fishing yesterday and made this to put on the fish after frying in tempura batter.  Add some lemon juice for a little extra zing!

Yum!  I added an additional 1/2 tsp of dill so I could taste it through the mustard.  Great sauce!  I used fat-free buttermilk and fat-free mayo and it was amazing!

Easy and tasty. I was looking for a quick way to dress up some tilapia, and this worked wonderfully. I had all the ingredients sitting already and it was done  in a matter of seconds.

Too much Dijon for me (tangy).  I will try it again with less Dijon Mustard (and FRESH dill).  I actually ended up heating it up for a warm sauce with Salmon...added a splash of white wine and let it cook down a wee bit.  Thank you for submitting it.

This was okay.  The dijon was a little to tangy for me.  I did not have fresh dill so maybe that was it.

I made it with yogurt instead of mayo, less mustard, and used fresh dill from my garden. It was very good. I put it on tomato and avocado slices, and that was so good that I put it on a B.L.T. and avocado sandwich. So good!

Made as instructed. Tangy mustard dominated this sauce. Prefer a sauce that’s more dill-focused. Won’t make again. Thanks anyway.

It was tasty but had WAY too much mustard. I love mustard but next time I will reduce the mustard by half. Other than that it is great drizzled over salmon and green beans.

Yum, yum, yum.  Outstanding on salmon cakes, but would probably be great on any kind of fish (especially breaded).

This was excellent. I substituted sour cream for buttermilk as I didn't have any on hand, so it was thicker than probably intended, but it was lovely!
