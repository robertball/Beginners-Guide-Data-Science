I added a can of diced green chilis, some garlic powder, and salt (some of the cans I used were low sodium).  It was a hit at the party!

Ingredients in pantry. Check. “Super easy.” Check. Brown sugar complimented spices. Enjoyed it over rice. Will try it over fish next. Thanks, Jessica.

We have made this a couple of times. And had it New Year's Day. It was a great hit within our large family. My 18 year old son asked for it and everyone else loved it!
