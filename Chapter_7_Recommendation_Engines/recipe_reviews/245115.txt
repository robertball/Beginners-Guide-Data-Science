I thought the package I pulled down from the freezer was thighs but it actually ended up being breast so I had to make one change. We prefer our breast grilled over stovetop and so grilled is what I did. My review is based strictly on the veggie portion of the recipe. This turned out great and screamed healthy and freshness.  A tip on spiralizing  carrots is that it works best by using only the fat end. I tried to make it work with the skinny end but ended up saving them for another use. Speaking of the carrots, as written they are still pretty crunchy (that is how we prefer them) so you might want to put them in first and let them cook down some if you do not like the crunch. The onions too.  Overall great recipe and I'm anxious to try it again with the thighs cooked in.

I love meals with strong flavor. This one has a nice tangy kick to it. It's really easy to make and forgiving if you want to toss in your favorite flavors. I didn't see a recipe for the vinaigrette so I used Martha Stewart's basic recipe. I added garlic and some parmesan to mine. Yum!

This came out a little soupy. I'm not sure why. I used boneless chicken breasts in place of thighs because that's what I had thawed. The completed dish was delicious and I will make it again.
