This is so easy and fast.  I had my sister coming over and needed something special and fast.  We love Ricotta cheese and this recipe sounded great.  On such short notice I had to use regular bread, but it was fine. Had one leftover and my husband loved it the next day! I used blueberries I had in the freezer and garnished the dish - looked great! Maybe next time I will add a couple of tablespoons of Grand Marnier Liquor to the egg mix - Then it may deserve 5 stars!

Awful.  Cheese filling was just plain bad.  I tasted it while making it and hoped for a miracle, but no miracle here.  It's a dud.  Go for a cream cheese based filling instead.  We had to throw it out-- and we never do that!

It may be that a good brand of ricotta is needed.
