I just want to say that this is not my mothers succotash which was disgusting and the reason I haven't eaten lima beans in 30 years.  But my local farmers market had them so I decided to give them a try in this recipe.  I'm on my third helping and can't wait for lunch tomorrow. I actually had doubled the recipe and added a little celery salt.  The whole family loved it, even my meat eating guy. will make again and again!!

This is a great alternative for those evenings when you are tired of eating meat. For those of you that don't have good tolerance to spicy foods, you might want to do 3/4ths or even half of a jalapeno pepper, I liked it fine just the way it was but I am a bit of a spicy food fan.

I didn't have Lima beans and I added some brown sugar to mellow out the heat from the japs and cayenne. It went over pretty well, this one is a keeper.

Made this as a side dish to some grilled steaks, and loved it. So fresh and flavorful, with good snap to the veggies. We decided it's the new potatoes to our steaks.

I skipped the jalapeno and cayenne because we're not into spicy food.  Add liberal amounts of cumin and pepper. Delish!

This was a great mix of veggies and flavors!  The only thing I will change next time is to cut down on the amount of cumin (and don't get me wrong, I love cumin!)  The flavor of cumin overwhelmed the flavor of the veggies, but overall a great recipe.  I also love how flexible this recipe is--it lends itself to many different veggies.  YUM!

It's snowing outside in the middle of May, so fresh vegies were not an option. I do however freeze everything we grow and what I find at the farmers market.  I used canned drained stewed tomatoes, and frozen everything else so omitted the water addition since it wasn't needed.  Served this with sliced smoked dinner sausage that I added to the mix for a complete 1 pot dinner and it was delicious.  So easy to make and such a forgiving recipe - a little more this and less of that for personal choice.  I used a whole and large jalapeno with the cayenne and we didn't think it was that spicy - it was the perfect amount of heat.  Thank you Chef John, this one replaces my own standby.

Very good recipe.  A great summer veggie saute.  I did not add the " heat" peppers.  Family enjoyed.  Will add to rotation for summer treats.

We liked this pretty well. I had to sub for what I had, but it didn't effect the outcome too much. Whole cherry tomatoes for the diced, peas for the lima beans and serrano for the jalapeno. It turned out pretty spicy to me but the BF likes things hot so it worked out. Great summer side!

This is more complete in some ways (zucchini for one) than the succotash I grew up with the Blue Ridge Mountains of home.  I like the fullness of the recipe, though I must cook some ingredients (zucchini for sure) softer than called for as I have no teeth.  It is a well seasoned and well put together (color, texture, taste, etc.) recipe that I highly recommend.

Soooooooo delicious exactly as is. I planned to make this as a side but ended up putting it over brown rice and eating it as a meal. I can’t give it enough stars.

I left out the jalapeño, and otherwise followed the recipe word-for-word. It was delicious! Everyone really liked it and the subtle heat from the cayenne was nice.

I made this for a family gathering. I doubled the recipe but pretty much stuck to the recipe. I like succotash and this is definitely one of the best I've tried. Everyone enjoyed it.

I could only get canned lima beans here in my small Swedish town and did't have any tomatoes but it was very nice and even better the day after. My husband said it tasted better than the main dish. (I thought so too!)

This was very good, but mine turned out a little bland.  I had dry beans that I cooked, and so I think I did not adjust the seasonings well enough.  I did not use the cayenne or the jalapeno, but other than that I tried to follow the recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

I didn't care for the cumin and cayenne - next time I will omit and try to add parsley and rosemary or thyme...
