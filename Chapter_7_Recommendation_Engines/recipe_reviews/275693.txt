It was not sweet enough in my opinion, and was more like a spice cake. I ended up drizzling it with warm cream cheese icing and then it was delicious! I also considered making a coffee cake topping for it. I would not make this again.

Update to my previous review below:

I made this yesterday using one 8 ounce package of cream cheese, and that appeared to be the correct amount. After it had cooled completely, I refrigerated it until shortly before it was served. It was absolutely wonderful! The flavor was superb, it was very easy to cut narrow pieces in addition to “regular” pieces, it was nice and moist and the flavors blended very nicely. I followed the recipe as written (except the aforementioned cream cheese issue). This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This turned out perfectly!   For a change, I used the recipe as is and did not alter a thing, and it was spot-on.  A beautiful, tasty cake for the fall, the cream cheese filling really is a nice addition to the delicious spice flavors.  Will be making this again....this weekend....for a friend's birthday.

Not a great option if this is your very first attempt at a filled bundt cake, but if you're an experienced baker it's great.
