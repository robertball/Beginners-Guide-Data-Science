As the recipe author, I would like to correct the recipe. As a few reviewers have noted, the baking powder amount is high. This is indeed an error. Not sure if that was my original doing or from Allrecipes posting. The amount of baking powder should be 2 teaspoons, not 2 tablespoons. Also, if you would like to omit the baking powder all together, use self rising flour. Using self rising flour would omit the use of all-purpose flour and baking powder all together. This substitution makes for a super fluffy onion ring batter. I've used both variations and never had anyone not like them. An additional note: After removing the onion rings from the hot oil, one can quickly shake some additional onion salt if you prefer. Also, these can be dipped into original batter and then quickly dipped into bread crumbs for crunchier onion rings. It's all about preferences.

These were great!!  Not like your typical rings, these had a really light crispy batter once fried.  I only had one onion, but I was really craving onion rings so I halved the batter and it was perfect.  I also used garlic powder in stead of the onion salt because 1. I love garlic powder in almost everything and 2. I didn't have any onion salt!  lol  I also only sprinkled some salt on the top at the end instead of in the batter (I'm not much of a "salty" person).  Quick and easy. . . definitely a keeper!  : )

This was my first attempt at making onion rings at home, and I was quite pleased with them!  I used half a cup of flour and half a cup of panko (Japanese) bread crumbs which increased the crunch factor.  My husband loved them, too!

I think that these turned out relatively well for my first attempt. I didn't have onion salt, so I used regular salt. They could have been more flavorful. I also tried to halve the recipe, however I found that 1/2 an onion used all of my batter. Perhaps my onions were larger than usually, but I'm greatful I didn't peal and cut 2 onions.   Thanks for the recipe.

I would like to hug whoever MIDNIGHT_ANGEL is! These onion rings were exactly what I was craving. There was only one thing I did differently. I didn't have any onion salt on hand, so I used garlic salt instead. Talk about accidental genius! I will make this again and again and again. :)

Easy to make, but there is a definite trade-off in taste.  These are way too "poofy" for us, and almost the same consistency as a corndog batter.  Take a little more time and make real onion rings.

I think the taste of the batter was very good.  If you hold the onion in the grease for a second when you put them in they won't go to the bottom, I used tongues for that.  I also like the little crispy pieces that were left behind in the pan as I fried them, they were great on the burgers we made.

We thought these were pretty good low sodium onion rings,used garlic powder instead of salt. Next time will add low sodium salt and increase garlic powder slightly.These also freeze well.Make sure yo drain well on paper towels.

Sorry, there's something not right about this recipe.  I'm not sure what the 'proper' amount of baking powder should be but there is WAY to much of it in this recipe.

I used the recipe to make onion strings. I cut the onion into thin rings then halved them. Then dredged them in flour and into the batter. Turned out great! Add some chili powder or ceyenne pepper to the batter for a kick!

I added a dash of black pepper and garlic powder. I also dipped onion rings in Italian Style bread crumbs after dipping them in the batter. Then, I fried them.

Also, I didn't have onion salt so I used 2 teaspoons of table salt & 2 teaspoons of onion powder.

I like how they taste, but the batter had the consistency of pancake batter which made things a little difficult when I went to dip the rings in the bread crumbs. I will make this again but I need to figure out how to keep the batter from falling off of the rings!

I made a gluten-free version of this using the 1-4-1 all purpose GF flour. Took someone else's idea and used garlic salt (as i did not have onion salt either)and salted after taking out of the pan. also had to add a 1/4 cup of water because my batter seemed too thick. With all that, my family LOVED these. There was nothing left over and I made 4 lg onions worth. Thanks!

I'm not really a fried-food fan (and making it at home kind of scares me a little), but I was craving onion rings and decided to give this a try.  My whole family loved it!  One important note - you MUST dredge the onions in flour before putting them in the batter.  Otherwise the batter will just fall off when it hits the hot oil.  Also, I halved the batter recipe and it was just enough for one onion.  I loved the puffiness of it, but if you don't like that you could omit the baking soda.  I sprinkled with some salt when they came out of the fryer.  Delicious!  I'll use this batter for other things, like mushrooms or zucchini.

I love these! I omitted the salt and used a table blend of spices, dipped in flour, batter and then flour again! Deep fried until golden and served with special sauce: mayo, ketchup and horseradish with a dash of cayenne! Delicious! Def. will make again!! Easy.......

Tried this for the first time -- and I have many many an onion ring in 45 yrs of marriage and I thought it was great! I thinned the batter just a bit with a little more milk. Had no problem with them being "donuts" or batter not sticking. Tasted great and will use this again and again! Thanks Angel for a gr8 recipe!
