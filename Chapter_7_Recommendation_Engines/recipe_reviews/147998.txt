I would have given this 5 stars, but the bake time is WAY off. I had one dark non stick pan and one glass pan, and the nonstick took 40-45 minutes, the glass one took an hour. I think there is a typo in the cook time because other breads I make, banana etc, take an hour. If these were made into muffins, I think the 20-25 minutes might be right. Great taste though. I added the Heath Bits along with the chocolate chips. Will make again.

I would have given this 5 stars, for it was excellent, but the bake time was way off. It takes a full hour. I would have to change the name for my version, for I replaced the chocolate chips morsels with filbert pieces. They were a great substitution.

Definitely not cooked in 20-25 mins.  Needs more like a full hour (like most pumpkin bread recipes).

Excellent recipe, very nice!  But I would have to agree with the others about the bake time.

Thank goodness for all the reviews i read AFTER I Made it! I ended up with a tasty soggy mess that I had to throw away. I thought my oven was broken. Then I read comments that it needs to cook a LOT longer than indicated. I will try again.

Delicious bread...very moist and flavorful.  My friend claims it to be the best pumpkin bread she's ever had in her life!  (This is saying quite a bit since her recipe was always at the top of the list!_)  Bake time was 75 minutes for my oven.

Awesome flavor combination!! I subbed out 1/2 the oil for unsweetened applesauce. My two loaves took 1 hr. and 5 min. to bake at 350 degrees. The bake time is indeed off. Yummy and delicious. It's a big hit in our house :)

The Bread came out all right.  But, I have to agree with the others.  The baking time was WAY OFF.  Not 20-25 minutes.  More like 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes, depending on your oven.

This is an excellent bread, just be sure to bake it until the toothpick comes out clean.  Mine took about 65 minutes.  Great recipe- thanks!

Cook time way off! I ended up cooking them for 1 hour and 20 mins. The flavor was nice but I might try it without the pecans next time.

The bread came out very moist and rich tasting. A little sweet for every day though. The bread baked in about 50 min. then I tested with a toothpick. The 20 to 25 min would be just right for muffins.

I made this recipe with the chocolate and without and it was delicious. My kids loved it too. My large loaf took about 1 hour 20 minutes to cook. I will try making this as another suggested 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil.

I made this as muffins instead of a loaf, and was terrific!  That helps cut cooking time down.  It is even better with a cream chesse frosting!  YUM!

This recipe was a DISASTER!  I followed the instructions almost to the "T," with the exception of adding an additional 13 minutes bake time for a total of 38 minutes.  Obviously the timing is clearly wrong!  I not only wasted my time but expensive ingredients and had nothing to show for it.  I tossed both loaves in the garbage.  I am much more hesitant to try any recipes off this website again.

I used pureed fresh pumpkin instead of canned and raisins instead of chocolate chips, both in the amounts listed in the recipe.  It came out really good.  The only change I would make would be to use an additional 1/2 cup of sugar when using fresh pumpkin.

I made this recipe as muffins instead of loaves.  I see a lot of other reviews stating the suggested cooking time of 20-25 min. is way to short, but for muffins, this is the correct cooking time.

This is a fall family favorite. I added some vanilla flavor and it really enhanced the over flavor of the bread.

These were so good! I made a few changes... 1. I made them into muffins, baked for 20 mins at 350. 2. I used 2 cups of mini chocolate chips instead of any pecans. 3. I put in one teaspoon of ground ginger as well. Next time I would put 1.5 teaspoons for a stronger taste, just my opinion. These are so good though!!

I tried this recipe, I made it in a bundt cake pan.  I cooked it for 40 minutes and the center was still partially uncooked. After it sat for about an hour it molded a little more, but other than that this cake was AMAZING!
