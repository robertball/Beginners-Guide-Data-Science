I made this exactly as written. It was very good. A little "nippy" due to the red pepper flakes. My husband suggested that the next time I make this, the meat needs to be seasoned...so I will add a little salt and maybe onion powder or garlic powder when browing the meat. Thanks for the great recipe. It was easy to make and I will definately make this over and over.

This is a variation on a Nebraska staple.  In the US we are talking ground round steak which is ground beef.  We used to make them with 2 pkg. of Pillsbury Hot Roll Mix, 1 head of cabbage, same ground beef, no red pepper flakes and a little Worcestershire sauce for seasoning.  Use a handful of dough, , 1/4 c. filling, pinch the sides, let rise 10 min., and bake on a greased cooked sheet, at 375 for 20 minutes.  Just like the ones at the Runza Hut!

These are really good!  And filling!  I ended up using more ground round (2 lbs), and 2 medium onions because my half head of cabbage was kind of large.  These really came out delicious.  My wife really dug it with sour cream, but I ate it naked.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Have to admit I have never had a Runza before but they sounded yummy (and I needed to use the head of cabbage in my fridge!).  I scaled back on the red pepper flakes for the kids, but added some red bell pepper and a bit of shredded carrot, both for taste and a bit of color.  It was WONDERFUL!!

This recipe sounds very much like a German dish called Bierocks, only using flour tortillas instead of dough.  Bierocks are really tasty and this recipe sounds like it would be also

Yummy! A quick and easy way to make "Runzas" if you've got a hankerin' for them! Thanks for the idea Virgil! I never would have thought to use tortillas in place of the bread. Love it!

I don't give 5 stars often but this deserves it... even though I did change it a little... That being said... Who would have guessed that ground beef and cabbage would make such an awesomely good burrito!?!  I changed the recipe slightly... because some people said that the meat can be a little bland, I simmered it in chicken broth instead of water, added a dash of salt and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce.  I also added about 1/2 a cup of shredded carrots because I had a small amount that needed using.  Quite spicy but if you like heat, these are perfect.  How can attest to their deliciousness?  My son who loathes veggies ate 2 of these burritos!!!

These were really good....I added a can of tomato sauce because I thought they might be a little dry and they turned out tasting like cabbage rolls...Anyone who loves cabbage rolls should try that the next time they make these....Yum!

Very good and different. I left out the red pepper flakes (don't eat anything w/hot spice) and used a bag of cole slaw cabbage since the store I stopped at didn't have any heads of cabbage. It worked out perfect. I added garlic powder and onion powder as someone suggested since I left out the pepper flakes. Husband and I both liked it a lot but he gave it only 4 stars because he said it wasn't as yummy as some of the other recipes I've been making lately. Will be making this again. I know our kids will like it too.

I really enjoyed this recipe, though I have to say that I only tried it because the ingredients sounded like a strange combination. I tasted the filling and found it a little bland, so I added pepper and garlic powder (not sure how much, just to taste) until I liked the taste. They were so handy to have in the freezer for quick lunches. A definite make again.

Don't know if I missed something or what, but I added tons of extra spices and these still just didn't do it for us.  I really wanted to like these, but we won't make them again. :(  Sorry.

I did not like these at all. It was really easy to make, but that was the only good thing about these burritos. I thought they were extremely bland. I cooked the onions with the ground beef and seasoned the meat with garlic powder, onion powder and red pepper flakes. It still came out really bland. All I could taste was cabbage.....

Really good overall.  I added more black pepper and some Tony's.  Otherrwise, it would have been kinda bland.  Also, sharp cheddar is the way to go with these.  Good and really easy recipe!

I used ground turkey and served with sour cream and salsa.  It sounds strange but is so good!  This also makes excellent leftovers.

This is an easier version of Bierock or Kraut Bergers from the Nebraska area.  The original recipe does not have the red pepper flakes, cheese, or garlic, lots more black pepper and the filling is wrapped inside roll dough.  Farmer's wifes would make these for Saturday night supper because they were made up earlier in the day and baked at supper time so cleanup was a breeze and then off to town they could all go for Saturday night.  Love the flavor and now can enjoy them without all the mess of making the dough.

Delicious.  My six year old who LOVES macaroni & cheese and rates all other meals against it says it's even better than mac & cheese.  I was not exact in my measurements and did add steak seasoning in lieu of salt & pepper to add a little pep (while still staying rather true to the recipe.)  I also added the shredded cheese to the meat mixture just before putting in the tortillas  (for simplicity sake.)  Will absolutely make again!  Could be an easy go to make ahead meal.

Just made these for dinner tonight. Excellent recipe, with just a couple small changes. I seasoned the ground beef while it was browning, as some other reviewers recommended, and I added a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce as well when I added the veggies and water and seasonings. I added chopped green pepper as well with the cabbage and onions, the more veggies the better, I think.  Really tasty dinner, even my 7 year old ate it. Thanks!

I probably screwed it up by shredding the cabbage and onion in a food processor. I cooked it for 2x the length it was supposed to cook for but I still felt the texture was sloppy.  I unfortunately did not like the taste and mooshy texture.  Shredding vegetables releases WAY too much moisture; I should have just chopped it instead.  Also, I added some fresh grated nutmeg which I thought was tasty.  And I did like the taste BUT the shredded veggies were just sloshy.

I accidentally left off the cheese and it was still great! The whole family enjoyed it!

I thought this had very little taste other than the red pepper flakes.

Wasn't one of my favorite dishes. Was easy to make. Added sour cream. Not sure I would make this again.

Love this. I added a couple of chopped shitake mushrooms and julienne'd carrot coins to the veggie portion, and used smaller tortillas...rendering a serving as two smaller stuffed spinach tortillas. I served with Yogurt Spinach Dip from this site. Excellent combination of flavors.

Alternatives:  Crescent rolls, hamburger buns, sauerkraut for cabbage, turkey for beef, chili powder instead of red pepper flakes. Might try mild cannned chopped chili peppers.   Since it's a burrito I'd also check out different kinds of salsa, guacamole, sour cream, olives, taco chips or maybe a layered bean dip.  Accompaniments might include orange or watermelon with lime juice, or a salad of fruit, a potato or macaroni. or fruit salad.      Can't give it 5 stars because red pepper flakes usually aren't to my taste.
