I made this a 4 because I added things I thought it needed, at least for my tasting. I like more flavors but this was a great base recipe. I did use half real eggs and half egg beaters. I added garlic salt, paprika, chili powder, basil and rosemary to the egg mixture. Not much of each but just enough to add some extra flavors. I added raw chopped onions and peppers after it had cooked in the pan for about a minute. Then I added some turkey bacon bits, mushrooms and then the cheese. Covered and cooked for a few minutes longer and then added the diced tomatoes with chilies. Was great!! Served with a dusting of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.

Delicious!! I made it for one..me! I added some pepper, and chili powder to the eggs. I was out of canned diced tomatoes with chilies, so I used some diced up tomatoes and salsa. Also topped with shredded mexican cheese. Will be making again!! Thanks, A.

I had to make some adjustments, as I don't have an oven safe skillet. So, I started out on the stove, as usual. Then, I transferred the egg to a microwave safe dish, threw the cheese on top, and nuked it for a minute. Came out perfectly. I topped mine with fresh pico de gallo from Trader Joes and for the cheese I used a taco blend from Sargento.

When I made this for my husband's low-carb diet I didn't have any cheddar cheese on hand so I substituted pepper jack.  I used bacon grease to coat the pan to mask the taste of eggs (which get old really fast on this diet). Also, I didn't want to turn on my oven so I just carefully flipped it over once one side was done. And I added salt, pepper, and onion powder. He loved it!  It's one of the first things I've made for him that he enjoyed.  Next time I'll add sauteed onions as well.

Simple but tasty!  I have a load of egg whites left over from making eggnog.  What to do...what to do.  This was an excellent way to make use of them!  My only change was to use salsa instead of the can of tomatoes.  Thanks!

I made this for lunch one day when my husband came home from work,and it was really delicious. The cheese made a nice crust on top, and the tomatoes made it nice and juicy and added lots of flavor. I also like the fact that it is a lighter dish, made mostly with egg whites, though I am still trying to figure out what to do with ten yolks! : ))

WAY tasty! I used full calorie cheese because I couldn't find low-cal at my local grocer and I added 1/2 cup of fully cooked bacon pieces.  The tomatoes and chilies were PERFECT..LOTS of flavor!
