Made this for my family and everyone liked it including my 7 y o grandson. Served over rice and side of brocoli. Next time I will add mushrooms and maybe even a little bacon for extra flavor. Great recipe and easy to boot. However not really very healthy or it sud be 5 stars.

The chicken was tender and tasty although seeing the oily ooze of the mayonnaise after it had been in the slowcooker for a while was a bit off putting.

I followed the recipe.... and was quite disappointed. The chicken was very tender, but it was bland... and was not visually appealing. My family thanked me, but didn't want to ever have it again. I agreed.

Reason I give 5 is..... I choose this recipe because I wanted something different than cream of soups or bbq.  I however added 1 can of corn drained and 1/2 c of parmesan cheese and 1/2 small onion an hour left. I did not cube the chicken n left whole. Afterwards yes was very oily but anyone who knows mayonnaise is made up of oil. So I drained most of the oil n sauce into my food straps outside dog dish. Severed over egg noodles. We loved it. Will make again. Thank you for sharing something different.

My kids love this stuff. I use Miracle Whip instead of plain mayo. We also like it better from the pressure cooker. Semi-frozen chicken for 13 minutes on the poultry setting. It was perfection!

It s a super easy recipe I leave my chicken breasts whole and let the meal cook over night on low. The next morning it s ready to go for lunch that day! I use the mayonnaise with avocado oil for a healthier spin on it. (I also add rice to my slow cooker and it turns out well for a full easy meal)

I made this in my Instant Pot using the slow cooker mode since it doesn't boil the food like a Crock Pot does. Good flavors however next time I'll add some crushed red pepper flakes to the Italian dressing mix.

The overall taste was a bit in the sweeter side for my liking. It also seemed like it needed something else to flavor it.
