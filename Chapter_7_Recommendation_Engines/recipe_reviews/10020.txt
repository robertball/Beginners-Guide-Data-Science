This sugar cookie recipe was very good.  I used one cup of butter instead of the shortening and I didn't have any buttermilk so I used 3 tablespoons lemon juice and put it in a one cup measuring cup and then filled the rest of the measuring cup up with milk (a buttermilk subsitute) and the cookies turned out great.  The only thing that surprised me was that the recipe stated that it makes 2 dozen, I ended up with over 40 cookies and had to triple the frosting (and the cookies I made were very large).  That's okay because I had plenty to give away to family.  Overall, it's a very yummy and soft cookie that I will make again.

I was very excited to make these cookies. Everyone said they were "cake like", just what I was looking for. I guess I should have paid more attention to the reviewers comments on the "bland flavor".

This is a very specific kind of cookie - for most people's taste, it MUST be frosted.  It is dense and cake like - without frosting, it is decidedly bland.  With the addition of  the sweet frosting, it becomes a killer cookie.  I actually use a slightly different buttercream frosting, and frost heavily - often adding sprinkles, coconut or other finishing touches.  My advice - if you are looking for a traditional "eat it plain" sugar cookie - this is not it.  If you're looking for an dense, cakelike base cookie to add a sweet frosting - awesome!

These were more like little cakes than cookies.  A bit bland as well.  I added melted chocolate to part of the batter to flavor it up!

This is my favorite sugar cookie recipe.  It is excellent, and I have used it countless times.  It is a soft cookie and excellent frosted.  It can be decorated for the different seasons of the year by changing the frosting color.  Again, it is very delicious!

This recipe creates very cake-like "cookies;" they're really more like little sponge-cakes. The cookies are also really bland, so frosting is the only thing that adds flavor to them. This is the recipe for you if this is the type of "cookie" you want. It seems like the cake you would use for Boston Cream Pie or a sponge cake filled with strawberries. In fact, I think serving these topped with fresh strawberries and whipped cream would be delicious. If you're going to use these as cookies, I suggest substituting real butter for the shortening to add more flavor and baking them for 12-13 minutes to create a little more of a cookie texture, but they're still going to be little sponge cakes!

My kids loved making these cookies!! We love soft cookies and these were perfect. The prep time for us only took about 15 minutes...we used a measuring spoon to scoop the dough...it worked like an ice cream scooper! And we lightly sprayed the cookie sheets instead of using parchment paper. The 1st few batches we made we added sprinkles before baking...the last couple batches we added the icing and then set them in the frige to harden. In less than 2 hours we had all the cookies made and passed out to our neighbors for the Holidays! And they all loved the cookies!!! So thanks so much for a great easy and fast receipe!!!!

The recipie was easy to follow and made pretty good cookies. The baking time needed to be doubled before the middles were no longer goo (even after they were cooled.)

I found this recipe about five years ago.  I started making these cookies and giving them away.  Now people request them.  They are so good.  I love the fact that one batch makes a ton of cookies.

I took these into work and they were a huge hit!  Everyone liked how soft they were and how they weren't like the average sugar cookie.  Everyone loved the icing too.

I was very disappointed in this recipe--the cookies had very little flavor and had to be baked quite a long time to keep them from being doughy in the center.
