Followed recipe. Pre cooked chorizo as per recommendations. Added garlic powder and cubes of Emmentaler Swiss cheese. 10 extra minutes of cooking. Turned out very moist and flavorful. Will cook again.

I made this and really liked it. I added some cheese and COOKED the chorizo before using it. Cheap Chorizo has a lot of fat that needs to be cooked out before eating. Also I don't it's real safe to put pork sausage in the middle of a roll up without precooking it.

I altered the recipe slightly.  I used Andouille sausage instead of Chorizo and also added some sliced swiss cheese before rolling the chicken.  I added a drizzle of brown gravy at the end which made the dish more moist.  It was delicious!

I was looking for something different tonight that used minimal ingredients as we just returned from vacation and I had very little to choose from.  This fit the bill perfectly! It was quite easy to make and very tasty.  I followed recipe exactly, except I did sprinkle some garlic powder on the slices and then some very finely grated swiss cheese.  This made a pretty presentation and hubby said we could have these again anytime!

Very easy to do. My husband enjoyed. We eat a lot of chicken so any new way to prepare it is a good thing. Since then, I've also used hot Italian sausage and works out well. Have made several times!

Loved this recipe!!! I made it for my hubby and it's been a weekly favorite since! I used turkey sausage instead since I don't eat chorizo, but the dish had such a nice flavor. Yum! Sever it with plain rice and a veggie, and your beau will be begging for thirds!

I made this yesterday and it was yummy. I cut back on the fat I used soyrizo which is a soy based chorizo.  I couldn't really taste the dill or the pinenuts so next time I'll leave them out and add some cheese. Since I cooked mine a little too long, they were a bit dry so I drizzled it with a little salsa verde to moisten it up

Pretty good but very very greasy. I pounded the chicken breasts as thinly as I could, added the stuffing, folded, and secured with toothpicks; the stuffing would have fallen out had I tried to slice it and pan fry. I ended up baking for about 40 minutes. Good but not great. Thanks!

Did not really like this receipe at all. I found the whole dish too salty. I am going to try the roll again with ham, cheese and spinach in it.

I love this recipe! I did alter it after the first time. I use soy-rizzo which is far less greasy and half he sodium/fat. You find it with the meatless products. We also wanted a crunchy coating so we did he weight watchers baked fried chicken recipe on the outside of the roll. Delicious!!!!  I serve it on top of cheddar mashed potatoes with asparagus as the side. Enjoy!

Such a great way to branch out from the everyday chicken breast and I always liked chorizo, but never knew how to cook it or what to cook with it.  I highly recommend this dish as it was definitely a family pleaser.
