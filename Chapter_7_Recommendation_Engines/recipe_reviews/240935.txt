I haven't made vegan brownies before so my three star rating is in comparison to regular brownies from a box. I used a generic mix because it is what I had on hand. I also used an immersion blender to cut down on dishes. The overall taste of the brownies was pretty good only a slight beany aftertaste which I suspect would be covered by frosting the brownies or adding chocolate chips (my friend didn't notice she didn't know what was in it until afterwards) The texture however was pretty gummy. You won't get crispy edges with this recipe the texture is uniform throughout. I might try cooking for less time or rinsing the beans and replacing the water to see if that makes a difference. Overall a good result for a vegan brownie that is so easy to make.
