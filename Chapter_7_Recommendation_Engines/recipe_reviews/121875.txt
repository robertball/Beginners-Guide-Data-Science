I've never made gingerbread cookies before, but these were delicious!  I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for nutmeg and/or cloves, and I'm so glad I found this one!  The cookies were wonderfully soft, but firm enough that the gingerbread man's arms and legs didn't break off.  My husbad says they're the best gingerbread cookies he's ever had.  I will definitely make them again.

I have been making these cut-outs since 2007 and I haven't changed a thing!  They are so moist yet they hold their shape well; I get compliments on them all the time.  I usually pipe royal frosting on them to decorate and it adds just enough sweetness.

These were great!  I was looking for a gingerbread cookie recipe that allowed the cookies to be soft, because I really don't like hard gingerbread.  After the first batch, I realized that the cookies will be more soft if I didn't roll them too thin and if I only left them in for 8 minutes.  They were perfect this way!  I iced them with the Sugar Cookie Icing recipe from this site.  What a tasty combination!

These turned out great.  I was a little worried because I am not accustomed to using molasses and thought it smelled/tasted terrible.  The cookies turned out really soft and mild and pretty.  Thanks!

I will admit that I couldn't find the ginger, and so changed the spices to 3 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and called them spice cookies.  They were beyond good. 

Then made them, again, with ginger, as stated in the recipe, and also incredibly good.

Wonderful cookies, couldn't get them to set up enough to roll out(I'm assuming its cause I used margarine) so I just dropped them by spoonfuls and they were absolutely delicious. Very tender and flavorful. Dipped the tops in a powdered sugar/milk mix for a little extra sweetness.
