This was devoured at Christmas when served with cream cheese and crackers. The only changes I made were reducing the sugar by half and using canned whole cranberry jelly because I couldn't find fresh or frozen cranberries for whatever reason. I tripled the recipe - to use as gifts - and still thought it was a bit too sweet. Fantastic overall. Great as a condiment as well.

Cheryl, you are the Cranberry Queen! Here I sit, on the morning of our Thanksgiving here in Canada (October 12), and I'm in heaven! I wasn't sure about this recipe but was committed to diverting from the standard berries, water, sugar combination no matter the cost. I stayed with your recipe for the most part, though was shooting more for a cranberry apple sauce so used two Granny Smith apples and reduced the sugar by a modest 1/4 cup. Again, I wasn't sure about the idea of serving the chutney on crackers with cream cheese, but I had some cream cheese left over from making a cheese cake so decided to give it a try on regular Ritz crackers. Yes! Absolutely divine, no doubt about it. I used all the spice called for in the recipe, and with some tripidation I must say, but I've no regrets at all. The reviewer who insists that the spice is overpowering and that the use of cream cheese is a waste of time because the spice drowns the flavor? Balderdash! It's sublime. Highly recommended. And a Happy Thanksgiving to you Cheryl!

This was EXCELLENT and I'll definitely make it again and again. We served it on top of cream cheese and used Triscuits to eat it. So delicious! I'm tempted to finish off the half sitting in front of me, but I'll resist. Anyway, this makes a sizeable portion, so keep that in mind when you make it. Definitely very, very good. :)

Super easy and wonderful taste!  I got raves over this at Thanksgiving, but would be wonderful with pork or poultry.

I wouldn't change a thing!  I served this with Triscuit cracker and cream cheese - even the kids loved it and I had enough left over to serve with the Thanksgiving turkey. Update: Made this again for Christmas dinner to go with ham and used 1/2 cup water and 1/4 cup of orange juice along with some orange zest and 1 Tbsp. of orange marmalade - fantastic!

Very good!  I made this today to practice for Thanksgiving Day.  I try to make things at least once before company comes over and eats them and let me tell you, this chutney is going in my permanent holiday recipe album and I will serve this every Thanksgiving and Christmas from here on out.  Wonderful flavor, beautiful color, and it smells soooo good while it's cooking.  I will make another double batch to give as gifts too.  Thank you for a new holiday tradition recipe for my family, Cheryl.

Very good and simple to make and is very attractive.  I used two granny smith apples for the tartness.

This is a wonderful recipe! It smells awesome while it's cooking, and it thickens up into this chunky yummy cranberry spiced goodness. Very good. I even accidentally left out the cloves and it's great.

Easy to prepare and always a hit with poultry or with cream cheese and crackers.  Spoon hot mixture into sterilized jars and it seals itself.  I usually sub oj for part of the water and add some orange zest.  So much better than basic cranberry sauce!!

This was awesome - we ate it with turkey, ham and with some soft cheese on a wheat thin.  I think I cooked mine a little longer than the picture with the recipe but it tasted so good!  I'll never go back to canned cranberry sauce again.  Highly recommend.

Very good recipe - I would have rated it 5 stars, but the cinnamon was a little overpowering. Teh second time I made it, I reduced the cinnamon, and it was fantastic!

Delicious!  I made this to serve over cream cheese with crackers.  I made it as written, and it was very good.  But I thought a little heat with the sweet would be interesting, so I added about 3/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes.  My family loved it.  It also was a great condiment for our roast pork loin.  Delicious!

Tastes Great!  For those who are canning, this makes just under 2 pints.  I used orange juice for the water, cut the sugar to 3/4 cup, added fresh grated orange peel and grated ginger, I also added 1/4 cup honey and an extra apple.  Yum! By the way, a 12 oz bag of cranberries is about 3 cups.

Delicious! So far, we've tried it on bread, and over basmati rice -- but I think it'd be great with anything, really!    I used probably twice as much apple, and maybe just a pinch less sugar.  I used 'superfine' sugar because it's what I had on the shelf.  Instead of ground spices, I used high-grade (food safe) essential oils -- cinnamon bark, ginger, and cloves, just 1-to-2 drops of each.

Made this for Christmas and we could not stop eating it! The only change I made was to reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup because we like our cranberries to be tart. Served with Ritz crackers and cream cheese and it was divine. My husband said "it's like Christmas in my mouth", which is pretty much all you can ask from a recipe. So easy to make, this will become a holiday staple!

Amazing! Nothing but compliments from the whole family! Make sure to use a large enough pot so the mixture can reduce without overcooking. The first time I made this recipe I had to pour it into a cake pan to evaporate some of the extra liquid.  Great over cream cheese, strawberry cream cheese, and my favorite - Port Salut cheese with a crunchy baguette.

I too could not find fresh or frozen cranberries, so I used canned cranberry sauce that had whole cranberries, I reduced the sugar to a little over half and added about a 1/4 tsp of apple pie spice. This recipe is really great!!!

Delicious!  As suggested, I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup, used a Granny Smith apple, and substituted pumpkin pie spice for the ginger and cloves.  It was a big hit at both parties I took it to.  I lined the dishes with the cream cheese and put the chutney in the centre as per the picture.  It looked lovely and very festive!  Thanks for the recipe and the helpful reviews.  FYI I used frozen cranberries the first time and fresh cranberries the second time . . . no noticeable difference.

Loved this recipe.  Made it at Christmas and it was a big hit.  At first I thought the cinammon was a bit too much but after a few bites it really seemed to blend in with the other spices.  It also fills the entire house with an amzing smell while cooking!

This was very good. It does make a ton so you can definitely freeze some for later or give some away.  I usually prefer my chutney's to have a little spice to them so next time I may add some chipotle sauce or something else to give it a little kick. It was very good though, I even served some graham crackers with it and it was like a desert type cheese ball that way.

Definetly with the cream cheese. It was a bit strong on the spices, but very good. It didn't get eaten up as much as I though, but maybe everybody didn't try it.

I took others' advice and used orange juice instead of water, added apple cider vinegar and orange zest, and popped the cranberries against the side of the pan as they cooked.  Somebody better send me a padlock for my refridgerator because if this makes it to tomorrow's dinner it will be a Christmas miracle!

Loved it!  And, I'm not a cranberry person. I halved the entire recipe cause I didn't need that much, but am making another batch yet again.  I served it over a simple baked brie found at this website.  I wish I could have shot a picture.  Very pretty.  It also made a nice side to the turkey dinner.

Wow!!! I have to agree with madsister....you should be crowned The Cranberry Queen!!! I love this recipe. It is so easy and fresh. I never understood the canned cranberry thing and I am not a great cook so I figured that this would be so hard and it is the easiest recipe ever! I will make this every Christmas from now on, and I love your gifting idea! Thank you so much for this recipe. Suddenly gift giving just got easier! Merry Christmas!!!!

After making this as written, I decided something was missing, so I checked my standby recipe "Cranberry Chutney I" from this site. I added some cider vinegar to this at the end, and for me, that made it terrific. I did have to simmer longer than 20 minutes and I also had to manually crush the berries on the side of the saucepan with the back of a spoon in order to get it to thicken. (I believe the seeds are where the pectin is, and that's what allows this to thicken up.) Thanks for the recipe -- we plan to enjoy this Sunday with cream cheese & crackers, and also spooned over roast pork.

Excellent recipe. This is breakfast on some home made bread. I have added the juice of one fresh lemon, and 4 peel strips of the lemon. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Other times I have replaced the lemon juice with orange juice. I have only used dried cranberries from Ocean Spray (original & the one infused in pomegranate juice). Make sure you put sugar last after the cranberries & apple are almost cooked. It came out great.

I was serving a ham slice and wanted to make it special.  I use 1/2 water and 1/2 orange juice as suggested on this website and reduced the sugar to 1 cup.  After cooking, I cooled slightly and served warm spooned over the ham slice.  This was served with mashed sweet potatoes and broccoli.

I cut the water back to 1/2 cup and it yielded the perfect consistency.  When I make again, I believe I'll add the zest of an orange and can by waterbath method probably 25 minutes.  Flavor is very good.  This yielded 3 cups.

not very pleased w/ the outcome of this recipe.  The taste was a bit bland and bitter.  The apples didn't add anything to the recipe.  Needs more texture and flavor. Will move on to another recipe from this site.

Delicious!  I think it took all of 5minutes before it was all gone off the plate once I put it out!  I did make two changes as I didn't have ginger or cloves.  I used about 5 shakes of nutmeg & about 6 shakes of pumpkin pie spice instead.  My mom made it the following day for a dinner and I'm saving it for next year!

Ok, cranberries are not my favorite, but I could drink this recipe...almost. I reduced sugar to a cup (might try using honey next time) and loved the smells of cooking this dish. 5 star for ease, holiday presenation, smell, and taste!

First let me say I am NOT a great cook. When trying anything new, I look for easy recipes with basic ingredients. I needed a recipe for a holiday party, and this recipe fit my "easy/basic" criteria, so I gave it a try. (I don't even like cranberries!)  I'm always surprised when something I try turns out great, and this really surprised me. Not only did it look really festive, but the spices gave the tartness of the cranberry a little different twist so that even I was gobbling it down! Friends suggested serving with bagels for breakfast too.   The left-overs are going into work with me tomorrow to remove the temptation from my refrigerator.  Leah Price, Hampton, VA

This is the perfect cranberry sauce.  I am not a fan of cranberry sauce at all, but I can eat this all by myself.  The blend of flavors is absolutely perfect...just the right hint of spice and sweet.  It makes your house smell just like the holidays.  I have made this two years in a row and everyone raves every time.  I serve it with cream cheese and triscuits. Thanks Cheryl for sharing your recipe that has now become part of our tradition.

I loved this recipe and so did the guests at my holiday parties.  The only change I made was that I used Craisins (dried cranberries) instead of fresh cranberries since they weren't available at the time and I reduced the sugar.  It was so easy and very yummy!

This chutney was awesome. It is now a fall/holiday tradition in my home. It is healthier than loading up on cookies and satisfies your sweet tooth. I caned a few batches and gave them as Christmas gifts and everyone loved it. Also it is great with ham.

I loved this recipe and it was so easy.  It put to shame my cousins cranberry sauce that was much more difficult with more ingredients.  I was a little skeptical of putting it on a cracker with cream cheese, but that was so delicious.

AMAZING!!  I made this for our "couples" Thanksgiving last year and liked it so much I made it again a few days later for my fiance's family Turkey Day - none of them like cranberry sauce, but they all raved about this!  I used Empire apples once and Granny Smith once - both worked out well and tasted great!  The spice mixture is perfect and makes the house smell amazing!

I needed something interesting to go with the pre-dinner drinks for New Year party. Found this recipe and tested it. Made exactly as written. Tasted good but lacked that something. So for the big day I made the same chutney except instead of water I used sauvignon blanc. I also added a cup of homemade preserved  orange peel. Served it with Brie and crackers. Everyone said it tasted great!! It ran out way before dinner was ready.

I thought this turned out great! It made a bit more than what I expected (maybe 3-4 cups), but I was pleased with it. I made this recipe for New Years as a condiment for Turkey Croissants. I added a bit of orange zest to the mix and used small macintosh apples because it's what I had (left the skin on). It turned out less chunky than some of the other pictures, but maybe I cooked it down a bit more. Will love to make this again for Thanksgiving.

Makes a great Thanksgiving/Christmas hostess gift with a wrapped chunk of creamed cheese & box of crackers, also maybe baby knife & plate.  Gave to several people this year.  Smells awesome cooking, very pretty, tasty, unusual, holiday-ish, and some people just devoured this stuff =)

Delicious.  I used just under a cup of sugar and ended up adding more because I got a bitter taste of cranberry!

Delicious, thank you for sharing the recipe.  I only changed the amount of sugar to 3/4 cups.  We love it with cream cheese & crackers, taste like cherry pie. YUM!

Ok, this was wonderful! I cut back on the sugar by about 1/4 cup, used 2 small red apples, and added a dash of cayenne and a little more water. My only complaint is that there's a little too much cinnamon. However, I will definitely make this again. It was so yummy with crackers and cream cheese as well as on the thanksgiving table as cranberry sauce, and it made enough for both!

I followed this excatly, I made it early for Thanksgiving, I wanted to see if anyone in my house would like it. (because none of us like cranberry sauce).  That was the problem...it is so good it was gobbled up before the holiday.  Even my 2 and 4yr old loved it.  I will def be making this every year and even use as gifts.  Thanks

Oh. My. Gosh. This is still scalding hot from the stovetop and I can't stop taking bites. AMAZING. My husbands coworkers family owns a cranberry farm so the cranberries I used are super fresh (he raked them just for us!). The only thing I changed was using two medium apples versus one large. Not much of a change, i suppose...Actually next time I make this I think I will use more apple. Maybe three or four even. I can't even wait to make this again and again!

This was delicious and super-easy! I followed the recipe exactly that I used 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices, and I added a little orange peel. It is delicious warm or cold with cream cheese and crackers. I am also going to try putting it on top of some brie, sprinkle some pecans on top and warm it up to serve with crackers or crostini. Yum!

This was super easy to make but it was almost too flavorful for my taste. I see why people like it so much with cream cheese...It helps to cut down the stronge flavors a little bit.

I made this almost exactly, with the exception of cutting back on the sugar by half as per other reviewers comments. It didn't quite turn out as well as I had thought. Its nice, serving it with cream cheese, but you can't count on it to be your only appetizer. I read one review prior to making it that said it reminded them of potpouri, and I too found that after a few bites. Its so fragrant and smells like Christmas, which is great to smell but not necessarily to eat.

Make this several days in advanced. It improves with age. Delicious with crackers served over cream cheese and pretty too especially during Xmas.

I made this to serve with crackers and cream cheese, which by the way, was a big hit. Then I noticed several people using it as a side dish with the turkey and ham we had for Thanksgiving. Either way, it was a big delicious hit!

Absolutely fantastic!  Everyone that I have made this for just loves it!  I like the texture to be a little more jam-like, so I do run it through my hand-cranked chopper just a little to get it a bit more smooth.    Make this, play with it to find your favorite prep method and sit back with a smile when everyone raves over it!

This had a little too much zing for me by itself but it was delicious with cream cheese. I made little goody bags with a one cup tupperware of the chutney, a brick of cream cheese and a sleeve of crackers for christmas gifts. Everybody loved them! Thanks so much for sharing.

Yum, yum, YUM!!  This tasted better than I expected it to.  I made it the day before and the house smelt wonderful while it was cooking.   This tastes better as the days go by - the flavours calm down and meld together.  I served it as a condiment for turkey on Christmas Day and on cold meats for Boxing Day.  Will be making this every year from now on.

This is a wonderful dish. i cut back on sugar as some have suggested. To make it a bit spicy I added a pinch of red chilli powder. Those of us that like spicy food enjoyed it.

I love love love this chutney. Over the holidays, I took it with crackers and cream cheese to all our parties/gatherings. One batch worked for 2 parties. Very good and flavorful, and makes the house smell just wonderful. Many people who tried it commented that they had never had anything like it, but they all loved it and asked for the recipe.

Wow...needed a quick chutney for baked brie and came across this recipe when I realized the only fruit I had was frozen cranberries...it was so easy and so delicious...used it with one ambrosia apple and a couple of whole cloves (because I didn't have the ground or any other apples) and it was incredible...used it as an accompaniment for the brie and then decided to use it warm an hour later as a chutney/sauce for the holiday ham....like someone else said--it was devoured....simple but yummy.... will be a go-to favorite from here on..

I followed the recipe pretty closely, except used orange juice instead of water. Gave it a deeper flavor, and added an extra dimension. I also pureed it with an immersion blender, since my family doesn't like the chunky parts (mom says in the chunky kind the skins shrivel up and feel like splinters). The verdict from my notoriously hard to please mom was that it was even better than the stuff in the can - and she's never said that before.

I made this to take to the family Thanksgiving feast and served it over cream cheese with crackers. It was so delicious & well received, I am making a double batch for Christmas morning. It makes the house smell festive and simply divine while it is cooking. This will definitely be added to my special recipes.

Served it at two parties, and had requests for the recipe. I think a neat twist would be to add a little horseradish when serving with cream cheese and crackers.

This chutney is fantastic. I first made it (as directed, no modifications) last Christmas and it was a huge hit! Thank you Cheryl for such a wonderful recipe!

I only had 7oz of cranberries, so I used two (small-med) granny smith apples to make up the missing volume. Also cut the sugar in half to reflect the lower amount of cranberries. Delicious and a big hit!

This was so easy to make and tasty too!  I made mine to eat with brie instead of cream cheese. It was wonderful!  Also, I tried to skimp on the sugar but it was too tart.  Will make this again.

This was fabulous. It worked well on turkey, on cream cheese (as suggested), on a roll, but best with this all together! Will be making next Thanksgiving again. Though, I'm likely to use less cinnamon.

Yummy, best cranberry side dish for turkey I've ever made!  The apple helps to cut the intensity of cranberries just enough to make them even more appetizing.

Very good dip.  Took to card party and everyone really enjoyed it.  Would definitely make again.  Adjustments for my tastes - reduce sugar to 3/4 cup and use a couple tart apples to put the twang in it.  Spice levels were great.  You could even add orange zest for another flavor. Or you could follow the directions and it would still be very good - really cant miss with this one.  Would be great along side pork chops.  My son came in the kitchen  while I was making this and said it smelled like xmas

Delightful!  Used 1/2 the sugar, pumpkin pie spice instead of various spices, granny smith apple for tartness, and crushed the cranberries while cooking to release the pectin.

Prepare yourself because these are very potent. I've never used cranberry with anything before so I can't compare it to anything. It was good but in small doses.

Way too much cinnamon and cloves.  All I could taste was cinnamon.I went to the store and bought another bag of cranberries and cooked them up with sugar and water and cut the first batch until they were suitable.

This was a big hit with the family. I served this as an appetizer over cream cheese. Only suggestion would be to drain any excess liquid before serving with cream cheese.

Thanksgiving Day hit. Seasoning perfect. Used a scant 3/4 C sugar and everyone thought it was a good amount. Took suggestion to replace water with orange juice. Perfect. Might try some orange peel next time I make it.

I used whole berry canned cranberries and 1/4 cup of sugar, 3/4 cup of water that I used to plump up my dried cranberries, prior to adding the canned berries and used cinnamon and allspice with some rosemary sprigs. I love the apple, but I only use 1/2 of a large gala. Excellent recipe.

Didn't think I'd like this but I made it, poured it over a block of cream cheese and served it with crackers and all I can say is it was like heaven at first bite!! I could eat the whole thing by myself! The spices add just the perfect holiday touch to the cranberries, making this irresistable! I will definitely make this for holiday get togethers!

I made this for Thanksgiving but I think I’ll be making this more often than just the holiday.  I changed this a little, substituting orange juice for the water and adding a little orange and lemon zest.  Some reviewers had mentioned that the spice amount was overwhelming, but I found it spot on, but I love cinnamon and cloves.  Try this on a bagel and cream cheese, it’s wonderful.

Truly amazing! I serve with fave crackers and cream cheese, oh who am I kidding? I eat it with a spoon until it's gone! Only changes, I reduce sugar to 3/4 c, it helps to reduce guilt when eaten with a spoon, and add the zest of 1 orange. Delicious!

This was my first attempt at homemade cranberry sauce and it smells wonderful while cooking, thickened up nice and looks great.  I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup as some recommended and that seemed fine.  I may have put too much cinnamon/spice in as it seemed a bit 'gritty' with the turkey - next time I would reduce the spice a bit.

Made this today.  Made it almost exactly as written, the only changes were only added 3/4 cup sugar and a bit of orange juice.  Made the house smell wonderful.  Made this to take to an office party on Wednesday, will re-post after the event.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

This was very good. I used less than a cup of sugar. I filled a cup measuring cup and added sugar until I felt it was right. I think it was about 3/4 cups of sugar.  I also had to cook this longer than the original recipe, but that could be because I cooked it covered at first so there was liquid that still needed to be cooked off at the end of time. Oh, and I only had whole cloves so I tossed two in and took them out afterwards. Then we baked it with brie and chopped sugary, spicy pecans. Wow, this was a spectacular combination.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, the only thing I add is I mix in some chopped walnuts when I serve it...it really adds a great flavor.  I also thought it would be a great gift so I canned it!  One recipe makes 3 half pints...I boiled my jars and cooked the cranberry mixture for 15-20 minutes, ladeled it into my jars sealed them up and hot water bathed them for another 10 minutes.  It makes a great gift!

One of the best appetizers I've had, combining sweet, tart, creamy, and savory into one perfect dish. Plus it's absolutely beautiful and makes the house smell inviting. Very easy to make, can make the day before an event (or 2 or 3) which is always nice. I couldn't find ground clover so went without but was still extremely happy. All of my guests asked for the recipe. Can't wait til I can get my hand on some more fresh cranberries to make it again!

This was a HUGE hit at two recent events.  At one, I used this as an appetizer over cream cheese with crackers.  At another, I served it over pork.  Both were EXCELLENT and I received many compliments!!

I just finished making my 3rd DOUBLE batch to give as gifts for Christmas. Only change I made was using about 1/2 C. less sugar.  1 cup less if doubling the recipe. (a double batch makes 5  12oz jars) This stuff is soooooo gooood!!! Deserves 10 stars!!! I sprinkled toasted chopped pecans just before serving over cream cheese

Made this chutney for Thanksgiving d'horves accompanied with a matching bowl of soft cream-cheese surrounded by gourmet crackers and bagel chips.  There was enough chutney to put in an elegant crystal bowl giving it a place of honor near our festive turkey and calling it my "custom-made-cranberry-sauce" !!  When making this scrumptious spread/sauce I used TWO large granny smith apples chopped the same size of the cranberries  then cooked it down till the  cranberries "popped" at this time I stopped cooking it.  This made the sauce the absolute right consistency in texture. Lumps with "no crunch"  Yumm-mmy !!  Oh! nearly forgot I had NO ginger  no one noticed but EVERYONE raved about my d'horves and cranberry sauce.

This was a perfect thickness- not too 'soupy'.  I added dried blueberries and dried cherries.  Used it with double cream brie, on poultry and for christmas gifts.

I LOVE this recipe!! Family and I have to take it easy on the sugar, so i put a lot less, maybe 3/4 a cup, and it was still SO DELICIOUS!! My mother & sister watched me make this and voiced their doubts, but it barely made it past dinner time! Everyone LOVED it, glad I made a big batch! Making it again this year, even the kids are asking for it! Thank you so much!

This is really delicious and easy to make. I made this last year for a Thanksgiving appetizer and again this year. Last year I made this exactly as stated. I noticed it was a bit difficult to get the chutney on the cracker with the whole cranberries, so this year, I ran it only for a few seconds in the blender and it was still chunky, but easier to eat with cream cheese and a cracker. Everyone always loves this one no matter which way you make it!!

I was unable to find any fresh or frozen cranberries, so I used whole berry canned cranberry sauce as suggested by other reviewers. My guests looked at me a bit strangly when I told them what it was, but once they tasted it they were won over. The combination of the tart cranberry and cream cheese is really very tasty. This is a nice dish for something other than the usual.

This is OMG good!  I was out of apples, so used pears instead.  I also put the ingredients in my little slow cooker, and let'er cook overnight on low.  Today, I'm planning on using the leftovers in a basic quick bread recipe for a holiday bread.  They are too good to compost!  Enjoy!

This was awesome. I made it for Thanksgiving instead of our usual cranberry jelly, and everyone went crazy for it.  Leftovers were really good on turkey sandwiches or with cream cheese on crackers.  I am definitely making again for Christmas!  Super easy, really yummy, you won't be disappointed.

This one is simple and fast to make, but it looks and tastes like you spent lots of time on it.  Really dresses up a holiday table.  My husband and his brother are hooked on it.  It also goes great with venison.

When I was a child I did not like cranberries but I tried this and WOW!! This is unbelievable! I made it for the first time last year. I think I will try to can it and make it a gift like someone suggested. This is delicious with your turkey or on a cracker with some cream cheese.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving.  It makes a lot though.  I brought it to 2 seperate dinners.  I served it over cream cheese and put crackers around the platter.  I used fresh cranberries instead of frozen.

I made as directed but let it simmer for about an hour to reduce the cranberries more.  Served with cream cheese on crackers.  The cloves were overpowering for my taste, so if I make this again I will use just a pinch or leave them out.  Such a nice ruby color when finished, and it did make the kitchen smell good all day.

Great recipe.  I wasn't completely sure about the cinnamon but I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.  It was wonderful with the turkey dinner and it was really good with cream cheese and triscuits.  I will cut the apples a little smaller next time so it will fit on the crackers better but this is the one I will make from now on.

I made this tonight but replaced the 3/4 cup of water with orange juice. It is delicioso. Wonderful with crackers and cream cheese, but so good as is my daughter wanted to eat it right out of the jar. It would be also good with chopped pears instead of apples or a little of each. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

I totally agree that this is absolutely fantastic!  It keeps fine in the refrigerator as well, so it’s great for making a day or two ahead.  I actually went back to the store and bought a few bags of cranberries and threw them in the freezer, so when the holidays are over I don’t have to go without it.  It’s just a shame you can’t give it more stars!  Thanks so much for sharing this with us all!

I couldn't wait for cool weather and fall so I could make and eat this recipe again!  I had been looking for a new and different way to serve cranberries last Thanksgiving when I stumbled across this recipe!  Yum!  Although most of my friends and relatives were skeptical at first, they all asked for it again this year!  And oh the smells it puts in your house while cooking!  I've made this numerous times, and the only thing I add is pears.  Other than that, this dish is fall perfection as is!

This was a big hit with Thanks Giving Dinner, it smelt wonderful and tasted just as good.  I used 2 apples and would even serve it as a dessert topping with ice cream.

This recipe is fantastic! I will definitely be making this again! I added some fresh nutmeg to it as well. Using freshly grated spices are the way to go!

AMAZING! Full of you favorite holiday flavors! So easy to make and makes your kitchen smell heavenly! Beats the cranberry in a can any day! I served it with plain Triscuits and cream cheese; then moved it on to the main course and made an awsome side dish... Fresh cranberries are the way to go!

I made this for 3 holiday parties we hosted this year and it was a hit each time!  The first party was a Progressive Dinner and everyone insisted we bring it with us to the next house, LOL!  I served it over a brick of cream cheese (let it soften first) with an assortment of crackers.  Our kids also liked it with pretzels.  It's really easy to make, the recipe makes a TON and it freezes very well.  I will be making this many more times I'm sure!

The perfect appetizer to get you in the holiday spirit!  Smells absolutely fabulous while cooking, and tastes even better.  We tried it over pork too, which my husband liked- but I prefer it over cream cheese with triscuits.  Try it- you won't be disappointed!

This was really good. It's sweet but tangy and when you pour it over cream cheese, it's smooth and creamy. I served this with Wheat Thins and it was gobbled up quickly.

I cut back on the sugar as previous reviews suggested by 1/4 cup.  That was the only change I made.  From the reviews I was expecting it to be fabulous.  It was disappointing.  Brought it to Thanksgiving dinner and although it made an attractive presentation,  it was barely touched and there were only 2 appetizers there and alot of people!  I won't make it again.  It was probably my fault as I found it very sour, probably because I cut back on the sugar?

I think I cooked mine a little longer than needed as most of my cranberries "popped."  It tastes wonderful!  My kids who both told me they wouldn't eat cranberries gobbled it up!  I made this exactly as written and it was wonderful.  Next time I might cut down on the sugar, it is sweet.

This recipe is soo good.  A few people posted that it was a bit too sweet so I substituted one cup of honey for the sugar and added a table spoon on orange zest.  And if you over cook it don't worry because it makes a wonderful cranberry sauce.

I have made this recipe a few times at Thanksgiving and/or Christmas.  In fact, I just finished making a batch!  We use it as a condiment with our turkey dinner instead of canned cranberry sauce.  BTW, I cut back just 1/4 c. on the sugar and use granny smith apples.

Yummy recipe!  Thank you for sharing, Cheryl.  I took this to a potluck and it was devoured.  To make it a little more healthy, I used half Spenda and half sugar.  I have plenty left over for Thanksgiving.  I might take other peoples advice and make it for friends/neighbors around the holiday.  It also smells wonderful when it's cooking.  Yummy!

Festive, quick and easy.  I've served it four times since I found this recipe on Thanksgiving.  The fourth was y request!  It's easy, quick and tasty and it's even better when fresh cranberries are in season.

Delicious and easy. I made this for a Christmas party last week and served it over cream cheese with Toppers crackers. Everyone loved it. My best friend eats it all by itself! I'm making it again this week for a Secret Santa gift, it looks really pretty in a clear jar. Highly recommended!

Thank you for this recipe! 
I just made this for tomorrow's Thanksgiving dinner! Wow!  I can't wait to hear what my guests think, because it's so good I'll be resisting digging into it before the meal!  
I added one pear as one reviewer recommended, and I used Splenda's Mix of sugar/splenda.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  
I'm going to serve it as an appetizer with Whipped Cream Cheese on a gingersnap  The cream cheese plays well against the tartness of cranberries, and I found a decorative gingersnap that is thin like a cracker that compliments the chutney nicely.

Absolute favorite. I use less sugar to taste. I've  also used honey or brown sugar, doubled or tripled the recipe to share with great results.

I've made this delicious cranberry chutney every year for at least 5 Thanksgivings now.  My family loves it.  I've made one change though.  I reduce the sugar by a half cup to 3/4 cup and use orange juice in place of water.  It is quite yummy this way.

This was so delicious and simple.  I prepared as written the day before serving and used as a condiment for turkey dinner.  Wouldn't change a thing.  I'll definitely try the leftovers with cream cheese and crackers.  Thanks for sharing, a winner!

Have done several years now for Christmas and Thanksgiving and it has become a traditional favorite not just with friends and family but with the children. I took the suggestion to serve with cream cheese and cracker and the combination of flavor is wonderful. I take any left over and use for on bagels and/ or toast for the kids. A must have in our home   :)

One of my favorite recipes EVER! I made this in 2010 for a holiday-themed recipe club, and it was the winning dish that night! Since then, it has become a family favorite, and not just for holidays. We love it with biscuits or toast at breakfast as much as with turkey, chicken, or pork at dinner. DELICIOUS. People gobble it up at brunches/parties served over cream cheese with Triscuit crackers too. Definitely a lifelong keeper!

Awesome and easy recipe, just the way I like them! Our friends and family love this. I usually double the recipe, reduce sugar to taste.  Any leftovers are divided up, and sent home. (I think they make sure there will be leftovers..) It freezes well, so they can pull it out whenever they want it. Always gets rave reviews  Thanks for a great recipe Cheryl!

This is the third year that I have made this chutney.  It is exceptional.  I added teaspoon of lemon zest to brighten it up just a bit.

Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe. Based on everything I read, without having made it before, I doubled the recipe and added an extra apple. I am so grateful to finally have a cranberry recipe that actually tastes great. I tried it with the cream cheese on crackers as suggested, and made it a couple of days before Thanksgiving. I only hope it lasts until this Thursday! Thank you again!

I tried this recipe out because I was thinking of including it in christmas gift baskets.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and the taste turned out fantastic.  Unfortunately, I think I over cooked the chutney.  Once it cooled, it had a consistency like cranberry sauce.

I make this whenever cranberries hit the shelves.  I have a batch going on the stove right now, but I do recall one time where I was making this in a friend's kitchen, but they were out of sugar.  In a pinch, I grabbed some Coke, it being a sugary drink.  It turned out to be a very tasty misfortune.

Delicious!  First, we had it with ham on Christmas day and then used the left overs over cream cheese with triscuits and it was delicious both ways! I decreased the sugar to a little under 1 cup because I like the tartness. I'm making it again for a New Year's Party! YUM!

This was great!  It was extremely easy and very tasty.  I used it as a bagel spread with cream cheese too.  I only used about half the sugar.  I used part brown and part white.  It would be good as is too, but I prefer more tartness.

You HAVE to try this recipe this holiday (or anytime..lol!)  I made this to serve as an appetizer at a Christmas party.  I made it the night before and let me tell you, the smell of my kitchen while this was simmering was heavenly!  I tried it after it had cooled and wow, was it delish!  I served this over whipped cream cheese, I used 2 blocks.  I poured the chutney over top and served it with crackers and a fresh baguette.  Yummy!!!!  I could not stop eating this...The only change I made was to use nutmeg instead of cloves.  Thanks so much!!!!!

This was awesome, everyone loved it, definitely put it on top of triscuits and cream cheese. But even without it you can serve as a cranberries for thanksgiving or christmas dinner, and they are the best you'll ever have. I didn't change a thing, even though I wanted to mash it, I didn't and it turned out perfect!

I made this for our Thanksgiving meal this year and it was fabulous!  I did modify slightly by adding about an inch of minced fresh ginger root during the cooking process.  It works great on bagels too!

This is a wonderful recipe! It's also really flexible for adding other types of fruit. I added a whole orange (run through a food processor) and 1/2 cup walnuts. It's fabulous on it's own w/o the cream cheese and crackers.

Don't wait for the holidays! While this "tastes like Christmas" in a sense it also puts me in mind of my grandmother's apple butter. The seasonings do that of course. With turkey, I don't want to cover the cranberry flavor as this does. It is excellent though served as suggested. It's also great just with toast. Given the health benefits of the cranberries, I think I'll keep this on hand throughout the year! Thanks.

This was delicious!!  I used a granny green for the apple.  I served it over one block of cream cheese, and should have used two and more triscuits! One box wasnt enough.  It was gobbled up so fast and was a huge hit.  I am making it again tonight for another family gathering.  I didnt have any issues with it being too sweet at all.  I was a bit concerned at first that there wouldnt be enough water, but once it started cooking, it was perfect!!  This is a must!!

This smells divine when cooking and it tastes just as good as it smells.   I got rave reviews from everybody who ate it at our thanksgiving dinner.   I served it with wheat thins, poured over two blocks of softened cream cheese.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup and used a granny smith apple.  Everybody who tried it liked it.     I might even make this for christmas gifts this year!

I love this recipe!  I made it the night before thanksgiving allowing it to chill over night.  Then softened a block of cream cheese and poured the chutney over it.  I probably should have use two blocks of cream cheese because I had so much chutney.  I served it with wheat thins.  It was so easy and beautiful.  It was a big hit and will be on my thanksgiving menu from now on.

I served this alongside Thanksgiving turkey. While I really enjoyed it, I received mixed reviews from my dinner companions. PROS: Quick and easy with attractive presentation. CONS: Too sweet. I used a Macintosh apple and reduced sugar to 1 cp. based on reviews. Still too sweet. I added about 2 tea. cider vinegar [I'm southern, we add vinegar to everything!] and that really helped it, gave it a zing and spark it needed. NOTE: I put this in fridge overnight and it congealed to consistency of canned variety. Not a bad thing, but be aware of it. COMMENTS FROM DINERS: One said it was too floral and he felt like he was eating potpourri. Another said too much cinnamon although I used only the amount called for in the recipe.

This is delicious and very easy to make.  I followed the advice and decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and used pumpkin pie spice.  I also cooked it a little longer so that all the cranberries had popped.  I could eat it by the spoonful!

This is the best cranberry recipe!  I made this for Thanksgiving and it was almost gone before dinner. I didn't have ginger or cloves so I just used some pumpkin pie spice that I had in the cupboard and it turned out perfect!  I can't wait for Christmas now. Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful! Thanksgiving is very big at our house and I make sure to include this recipe. Not only does it taste wonderful, it makes the house smell divine for guests! We serve it over cream cheese and crackers. The only person who did not like this recipe was my sister- she said it was like eating potpourri. Too aromatic for her. I love it though.

I have made this several times since first experimenting for Thanksgiving.  I added some apple the first time and pear the next batch.  Each time it turns out wonderfully.  We are going to more holiday parties and I have been asked to bring the "cranberry stuff".  It is wonderful on bagles, crackers, with fish or ham.  Smells wonderful cooking and is so EASY.  Thanks for the recipe.

The flavor was just wonderful.  Even the children loved the flavor.  What I did was spread some spreadable regular cream cheese over a cinnamon graham cracker and then dolloped the chutney on top of that.  I could not keep any due to it being a hit!!  

Will definitly make this again and again!

I've made others that are better.  The flavor of the cinnamon and cloves were very overpowering.  If you reduce the amount of spices, then I think it would be quite good.

I thought it was pretty good, a little too sweet though.  My guests thought it was way too sweet they said and that they don't see the reason for using cream cheese because the other flavors were so overpowering.  I wouldn't make it again, although glad I did because I would like to find something like this to serve at christmas and new years next year.
