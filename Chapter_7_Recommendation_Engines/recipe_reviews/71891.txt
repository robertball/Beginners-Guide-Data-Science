This was a fabulously tasty way to cook halibut! My boyfriend made this one. He only cooked two halibut steaks, and did the whole thing in the skillet, using probably 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Even though it was only two steaks, he used all of the other vegetables, all of the pepper instead of half, and cut the tomato into wedges instead of slices. When he served, he just ladled all of the vegetables over the steaks, and it presented beautifully. It was a wonderful dinner!

We liked this recipe.  The only thing, the vegetables were over cooked for our taste and would prefer more garlic.  So when I make this again I will briefly saut√© the vegetables hoping they will come out a little crispier.  Thanks LittleAsta!

Great recipe.  Because I hate mushy zucchini - I added it during the last min. when the onions/garlic/mush./grn peppers were almost done and cooked to a tender crisp.  I then brushed each halibut peice w/ a little olive oil, layered the vegetables around and atop of the halibut.  Finally, I omitted the tomato altogether - for fear of mushy. Overall very good and here you have you maindish and veggies all in one! (However, I did serve with a side of rice pilaf).  Thanks!

A WINNER!!!  This is my favorite halibut recipe yet!  I don't add the tomatoes b/c my husband does not like them.  Other than that omission, I make it exactly like the recipe.  I've already made this 2x in 2 weeks!

This is an easy/fast recipe that gives great results! I agree with other reviewers that you can change the vegetables with pretty much what you have in the refrigerator, but i think that the mushrooms are great in it!  The only change i made is that i marinated the veggies (the recipe i used is for grilled portobella mushrooms): olive oil, lemon juice, balsamic vinegar and chopped basil. I then used the marinade to saute' the veggies and poured all on the fish. It was delicious

This makes a real nice summer dish. I love how versatile it is...you can really use just about any fish and any combination of vegetables. I was looking for a way to serve up some frozen boxed haddock fillets and used this recipe. I didn't have mushrooms or zucchini but did have yellow and orange bell pepper and asparagus. So with the red tomato, it made a beautiful looking dish. I also had some fresh basil and lemon thyme growing so used that instead of the dried basil. With a side of rice (cooked in chicken stock and some chopped green onions stirred in afterward) it made a complete meal. The only down-side was that I didn't make enough! Everyone liked it and it went fast.

Great dish. Family said it looked and tasted like something from a fancy restaurant. Didn't have any zuchini at the time I made the fish, but it was just as good without it. Maybe next time I will drizzle a little olive oil over the top before baking.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I just made this for dinner tonight, and I have one word for you...WOW!  After reading the reviews, I decided to rub the halibut steaks (yes, I used steaks, not filets) with olive oil, salt and pepper, and placed them in the bottom of a CorningWare dish.  Then I sauteed the veggies (carrots, zucchini, snow peas, cauliflower, onions and lots of garlic) in olive oil for just a couple minutes and dumped them over the fish.  Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes (omitting the tomato) and it was fabulous.  I'll be making this again.

Halibut is one of our favorites and I had all the ingredients on hand, so I decided to try this out.  It turned out quite well.  I lightly sauteed my veggies separately so they wouldn't get overdone.  I seasoned my fish with salt, pepper, and Old Bay and added a couple of thin pats of butter on top of the fish.  I then added the veggies over the top and added a glug of white wine around the fish.  I baked this covered for 15 minutes and then uncovered for 15 minutes (my halibut was a little larger than called for in the recipe).  This was very tasty and we both enjoyed it, even though I forgot the basil.  I wouldn't hesitate to make this one again.

Worked perfectly although I didn't have the zuchini, used more garlic and had to cook it longer because my halibut must have been thicker.

Tried this one out on my wife since she wasn't crazy about many of the other "fish" recipes I have tried. When asked, she said she would prefer this recipe over any of the others I have tried. Really liked the vegetable topping and I have them in the fridge all the time anyways. Great recipe and very easy to make and put together.

This is a healthy staple in our house - hubby likes to go halibut fishing.  I omit the tomato and mushroom and double the zucchini.  It is amazing how much flavor comes from these simply sauteed vegetables.  We also use red bell pepper, and use less oil.

Looking for something healthy, and packed with layers of flavor... this is the one! Halibut here in Northern Illinois was $16.99 a pound today and DID NOT smell like the sea!  I substituted the Halibut for Cod... Very nice, dusted with fresh basil and a squeeze of lemon at the end and served with brown rice... The results were a restaurant quality dinner for about $10.00 total.

My husband and I liked it, but didn't love it. I thought it lacked flavor and I didn't care for the halibut. Next time may use grouper like others suggest and tweak (add butter or basalmic vinegar) to add some flavor.

I will definitely make this again. I used vegetables I had on hand and didn't cook them as long so they would remain slightly crispy after baking with the fish. I also put put about 1/2 tbsp of butter in with the fish while it baked. Gives a nice rich flavor.

This was a perfect recipe for a quick & easy meal.  I had a halibut filet to use and was too tired to make anything fancy so I tried this recipe.  I used carrot instead of zucchini and fresh basil.  Very tasty!

This was very good. I don't know that the veggies did much to enhance the flavors of the fish, but I loved that this was an all-in-one meal. The veggies all complimented each other and the fish was a huge bonus. Thank you for posting this.

This is so easy and good. I didn't have green bell pepper but did have the red which is sweeter.  It made a colorful presentation and so tasty. I think you could probably add any other veggies that you had around.

I made with with Alaska whiting filets as I could not find halibut.  I also left out the zucchini as I forgot to buy one.  This was excellent.  The vegetables were very tasty.  I would definitly make this again and I will try it with halibut next time.

Used what I had some kind of root vegetable that looks like garlic but tasted sweeter than a potato? Red pepper, sea salt, black pepper, lemon pepper, garlic pepper, onion, juice from a squeezed lemon half, and 1 roma tomato on 3 halibut steaks.

Basically followed recipe exception for following:  used shallot instead of garlic, used talapia instead of halibut, and sprinkled a little grated parmesan cheese over tomato at end.  Adjusted cooking time for fish as talapia is thinner.  Will definitely make it again - very good, tasty, & filling.

These were really good! Very fresh and healthy. I used grouper filets instead of halibut with nice results.

I thought this was really moist and tasty.  Healthy enough to merit raves from my healthfreak son.  I loved it. My cream sauce husband said good but not great.

This recipe was good but lacked a little flavor. I drizzled balsamic vinegar over the top at the end and it deffinitly helped!

I guess I just don't like halibut...I will try this with a different fish like tilapia or red snapper.  I even put the fish in a frying pan for a couple of minutes so that it was less "poached" and I still didn't really like it much.  I love veggies, so that wasn't the problem.  My husband loved it though.

My family loved this recipe! We used orange roughy instead of halibut (we had it one hand) and the orange roughy gave the dish a buttery broth. It was fantastic.

Great recipe. It chould be used well with any white fish.  Left off the tomatoes as my husband isn't a big fan and worked fine. Definitly a keeper.

I altered this dish just slightly because we are in the process of moving and I didn't have the appropriate dishes unpacked yet.  I cooked the halibut on the stove over med-high heat until it flaked.  Everyone in the family loved this dish and the fish was incredibly moist and tastey.  I will make it again and again!
