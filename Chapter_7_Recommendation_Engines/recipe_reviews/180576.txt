This one is company special. I could not manage to pound my chicken to 1/4 inch (and I was beginning to think the neighbors might be wondering WHAT was going on over here), so I slit the pieces and stuffed the slit meat, pinning with toothpicks and proceeding as instructions indicated. Had to substitute craisins for the apricots this time, but this worked well with the apple flavor. (Oooh, wonder what dried mangoes might be like!) Also, we are not the brave souls we once were, so reduced the cayenne by half with no ill effect. Truly beautiful, fairly simple (if you work around the 1/4 inch thing), and very, very tasty. Thank you for posting, Jack.

I took a gamble on this one and I am so glad I did. Even my picky, fruit-loathing hubby LOVED this. My only complaint is that the pistachios were not listed in the ingredients when I first tried this - so I guessed and just threw in a handful of them.

I used 1/2 cinnamon and 1/2 nutmeg in lieu of the full amount of mace. I also subbed dried figs for dates. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. It makes a great deal of filling, FYI - we probably only used 2/3 of it.

A fun, different recipe that looks and smells delicious. Thanks Jacki!

This is a pretty different, good recipe. A lot of work to prepare; I thought the cardamom was a little overpowering and the cayenne somewhat distracting, i'd cut that in half next time although usually the spicier the better for me. I felt it was missing something and that another spice might have been an appropriate addition but couldn't quite put my finger on it... definitely needed more apricots and more than the 1/2 cup of pistachios I put in since it wasn't specified in the recipe. I'd use at least a cup.

This is wonderful and different.   Remember that the recipe calls for 2 breast HALVES.  That's one breast cut length-wise in half.  You could not pound to 1/4 inch otherwise.

I sliced a slit in my chicken then opened it up and sliced open the edges until it lay flat, then I rolled it around my stuffing, otherwise I followed the recipe as written, no only was it delicious but it presented beautifully as well.

Too much spice!!  Made this for the first time found the spices to be much too overpowering.  I'm not sure which spice it was, but it wasn't the cayenne, as I didn't feel much heat.  It has potential to be good, but if I make it again, I will use half of the cardamom and mace.

Used skinned & deboned thighs instead of the complication of breasts without even using a mallet and worked pretty fine -  great recipe!

I made this last night. So incredibly easy and the flavor was astonishing. It took me 20 mins and my chicken breasts were oven ready.  I sliced the chicken breasts crosswise since they were fairly thick and pounded to more like 1/2" thick when I called it good enough- and it was. Served this on a bed of wild rice. 
Stupendous! 
I see people commenting on the powerful spice flavor. This dish does have that and needs to be served with something like wild or brown rice to temper the strength of the flavor.  I love swiss cheese in combination with the ingredients in this dish so the last couple minutes I layered a slice of swiss over the top. 
This truly is a healthy flavorful delicious dish. 
It's on my mainstay menu now.

I doubled this recipe to serve 4 people and, in the absence of mace, used 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg in the stuffing.  My guests loved this dish and it is so elegant.

LOVED the combo of fruits/spices & will definitely make again, so why only 3 stars?  Tedious prep,  that "something's missing" thing others also noted & the presentation (stuffed anything always looks nice, but the plain exterior of the chicken was lacking & could border on appearing/tasting dry if one isn't careful, IMHO) .  I made it "as-is" to start, other than reducing cayenne & served it w/veggies + brown rice that I tossed into the browning pan after adding OJ to deglaze -- the melded flavors were scrumptious.  In the future, to make this 5 star-worthy, I'm going to play with the following:
* Combine stuffing ingredients & partially cook on stovetop, using chopped pecans or walnuts when pistachios aren't on hand & adding a light touch of seasalt to balance sweetness of dried fruits-perhaps the missing ingredient?
* As a timesaver, consider opting NOT to pound/stuff chicken breasts - instead - just lightly season breasts or thighs (include a light sprinkle of turmeric for color/health benefits),  brown in pan & then top with 'stuffing' to make a more pleasing presentation (covering w/foil while baking so as not to dry it out)
*Other ideas: (1 )hubby suggested slitting breasts & stuffing w/mild cheese prior to topping with stuffing & baking. (2) consider turning the "stuffing" into a sauce by increasing OJ & thickening on stove...pour this over plain or cheese-stuffed oven-baked breasts just before serving, reserving some for rice  (3) consider subbing pork - stuffing por

loved this.  Use fresh breasts to roll though.  Had frozen so quickly browned one side of breast and made sandwiches -sort of- with 2 flattened breasts. Great filling!  Thanks for this recipe.

I have been making stuffed chicken breasts for many years.  I use all kinds of ingredients as stuffing.  I prefer to use skin-on chicken. The skins, wrapped around the stuffed breasts keep the meat juicy and tender.  And... the final result is more visually appealing.  I usually dollop some jam or jelly on top about 10 minutes before removing from the oven.

Wonderful textures and tastes. Love how the sweet of the date and hot of the cayenne balance each other and add a complexity to meal.

I made this wonderful recipe tonight and used the juices with chicken broth to make a gravy.  Mashed sweet 'taters as a side dish complimented this dish well, too!   Add some greens and glass of a bull bodied red wine (19 Crimes accompanied my dinner) or a Blue Moon with orange slice and you've got yourself a really nice meal that's super easy elegant, easy to make and delish!  :)  This would be great with wild rice or couscous, too!  Next time I'll make it with a Pork Loin or turkey breast - bet it would be really good!!   :)

This was easy and delicious but also looked "fancy"....... It is a bit expensive to make with the dates, apricots, raisins, but you can use these up in a fruit filled pork roast or chops or cookies, etc. The filling was a little too "wet" with the orange juice, but acted as a liquid to steam the chicken roll ups. Next time I would reserve the liquid until AFTER  the chicken rolls are browned a bit, then use the liquid to finish steaming them in the saute pan. I put a lid on it. The flavors were very good and the cayenne gave a  really nice bite, but not too hot at all. This is a dish I will make again.

I'm confused as to why so many people have mentioned pistachios in their reviews.  I don't see pistachios in the ingredients list.  I haven't made this but I'm wondering if the calorie count is at all accurate given the list of ingredients.

Five stars for sure! I made this for Valentine's Day and we both loved it. I didn't have dried apricots on hand so I left them out, and used a medium-sized apple. I didn't pound and roll the chicken either - I just cut each chicken breast horizontally to create a pocket for the stuffing. I made a glaze with some blood orange infused balsamic vinegar and served with a side of brussels sprouts. Sometimes I worry about chicken breast recipes turning out dry, but the chicken was melt-in-your-mouth tender and moist. This is an easy, special recipe that we will enjoy again and again. Thanks for sharing!

When I cooked it to an inside temperature of 165F as suggested, I found the chicken rather dry. Does anyone have any ideas for a sauce that would complement the dish, and also make it moister?

I have not made this yet but it looks tasty and after reading the reviews I definitely will try this. My question is about the pistachios. I keep reading about them not being included in the ingredients. Is it just me or what. I don't see them anywhere in the recipe. Are they suppose to be there? If someone would let me know I would appreciate it. Thanks

This is soo good just remember to not touch the hot pan while taking it out of the oven. I made this for my husband on Valentines day and ended up burning both my hands on the pan....i think i needed to be more focused.
