This is very tastey. I was afraid my veggies would get mushy if I continued cooking for 45 min. prior to precooking so, I threw them in 30 min. before end of cooking time. I did not precook them. I like a lil firmness in the veggies. I also added 2 tsp of basil and barley. Where I live couldn't find orzo pasta so I used mac. noodles. Thank you Joanna for sharing.

very tasty! didn't have cabbage, orzo or zucchini. I added minced garlic and used better than bouillion soup base, as I was out of beef broth, go figure! Overall, very good soup, perfect for a cold day.

I made this exactly with only one variation - I left out the orzo pasta.  It was great!  I made xtra to freeze it was so good!

Delicious soup. I did make some changes based on what I had on hand and personal taste preferences. I left out the corn and orzo, didn't have any orzo and used kale instead of cabbage. Added sweet potato.

Made a large pot of this soup last night--IT WAS WONDERFUL.  Made it almost as written, I did not have any zucchini or peas on hand, and only added one can of diced tomatoes.  I did not want it to taste of tomatoes.  Everything else was the same.  I didn't think the orzo would work, but I added it anyway and it was perfect.
The recipe makes a large amount so I will freeze 3 quarts and have plenty on hand for other cold night suppers.
Thanks for posting such a good soup recipe.

Good, but made some adjustments:

1)  Added about a tablespoon of minced garlic (per the suggestion of another reviewer) with the onion
2)  Towards the end, mixed about a cup of the cooking liquid with about 3 tablespoons corn starch then stirred back into the pot to thicken
3)  Added about 1/4 cup of white vinegar at the very end to make it "pop" a bit.

All in all, very good!

Good, but somewhat simple flavor.  I added Parmesan at serving to boost the flavor.  The vegetable combo was very good.

Absolutely loved this recipe! We don't eat tomatoes so I used tomato soup and tomato juice. I cut fresh corn off the cob and also used fresh carrots and green beans.  It was so delicious! I will be making this again! Thanks for sharing.

Best darn homemade vegetable beef soup I have ever made! I did some home made noodles I used in mine. And my husband and grandkids loved it.

This recipe was awesome, I made it in a slow cooker.  I substituted the cabbage with kale. Served it with cornbread and the soup was eaten up so quick that I was only able to get one bowl to eat. I definately will be making this soup again next week.
