This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  I'm not much of a baker, and was a little intimidated to try biscotti, but to my suprise it was quick,easy & absolutely delicious.  Everyone loved the cookies and I will definately make them again.  When I made it according to the directions, I found it made about 25 cookies, not the 15 as the recipe states.  I also think it would taste good with a little orange zest, maybe I will try adding that next time.  A great recipe, you should try this one!

these are awsome. I used margerine, and they turned out great. I used white chocolate chunks instead of chips, and boy are they rich. These sweet treats will be made often at my home...particularly around Christmas. YUM!

These were good.  I used cherries.  I also drizzled white chocolate on one of the sides.  Had to keep my husband away from them, he could have eaten them all before my company cam over.  Will keep.  Maybe add almond extract when using cherries.

mmm. these were devine!
doubled the recipe and made thoughtful, homemade christmas gifts for my aunts! Piled high in a nice, clear cookie jar and paired with some gormet or homemade hot cocoa mix, and it became a treat-turned-gift that everyone was impressed by. Fantastic recipe for biscotti!

I love biscotti and this is an easy and delicious recipe.  I did line a baking sheet with tin foil and spray with cooking spray, made it easier to shape. I also put a little cooking spray on my hands.

i was looking for something to ship to my sister overseas.  i was anxious that i hadn't tried the recipe out first, but it was even better than i expected!  i'd never had fresh, homemade biscotti, and now i wouldn't even touch the packaged cafe stuff.

i made this with a bar of white chocolate chopped up into chunks because i couldn't find any chips here in the london.  i followed the recipe exactly otherwise.

the only complaint i have is that i now have to send them across the ocean!

Wonderful flavor!  Lightly sweet, light texture.  Easy to make. Everyone in the office wanted the recipe. I want to try them with pecans.  Should also be excellent with dried apricots or cherries instead of the cranberries.

These were excellent! Drizzle dark chocolate or dip one end in melted dark chocolate set on wax paper, watch them disappear. Great to dip in your morning coffee! Will make again!

This is great if you like biscotti. It's easy to make.  Biscotti is very hard. But I guess I'm not the most biscotti fan.

This recipe was easy and produced terrific results!  My family is Italian-American, and my mother said she couldn't wait to tell her mother, my Nonnie, that I made them because she would be so proud. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great but was pretty bland when you didn't get a bite of white chocolate or cranberry. Next time I am going to add a little bit of chopped orange zest and a bit or orange extract to perk up the bites that don't have bits of yumminess in them

Fantastic!  The white vanilla chips added such a great flavour to these! Some people commented about them falling apart during slicing.  The trick is not to let them cool down too much as they harden as they cool. Be gentle and every piece will be intact!  I did a test and stored the biscotti 3 different ways - ziploc bags, tupperware, and a tin.  They stayed perfectly crisp in all three.

First attempt at biscotti. This was pretty good. Each of the three 10x2" logs broke in half when transferring them to cool (even though I used a large spatula). They also crumbled quite a bit when slicing...perhaps my baking time was off. Delicious recipe and I will try again - next time I'll add more cranberries than the recipe calls for.

An excellent recipe! I was a little skeptical to try it as I had never made biscotti before, but it worked out great! I used white chocolate chips and the biscotti is delicious! I ate one of them after the first baking, and it tasted like a cookie- delectable! Love this recipe and will use it again! Thanks!

This was better than I expected! Great! I did add 1/2 tsp salt and I used margarine instead of butter because that's all I had on hand. I drizzled with chocolate after they cooled as well. Will def make again!

This was my first attempt at biscotti, and I thought it was excellent!  A little crumbly after the first baking step, but that could've been me leaving it in the oven too long.

My family LOVES this stuff. I make it for our Christmas Eve get together and there is always enough left to dunk in the coffee when the kids wake up at 4am Christmas morning. I have tried it with cranberries and candied cherries, delish both ways! It isn't hard and dry like most biscottis. You will love this one if you are a biscotti fan.

There were good, but not exceptional in any way. I have a hunch that incorporating some finely grated, fresh orange or lemon zest would improve the flavor which, as is, is bland. Good light, crispy texture.

I've only tasted a few bites of this, but it tastes very good.  Can't wait to try some more.  I had  major issues with making logs.  It could be because I tried softening the butter in the microwave.  Next time I will be sure to let it soften on the counter.  I put it in the refrigerator for awhile and then put blobs of it into logs on parchment paper.  In the end, I think it will be just fine.

OH MY GOODNESSS!! These are awesome.  I drizzle with dark chcolate and I think it just adds a bit of something to accent the other flavors. These are great. They do not get to that super hard crunchy break your teeth. There is a bit of softness. I cannot explain the compliments that I get. Everyone RAVES about them. I have never made anything that gets people going like this. A friend on a diet said she would break one in pieces and have a little piece. She had to eat it all. They are addicting. I had a couple I gave some to literally wrestle for the last one - The wife proudly stated she got the biggest piece. Another friend came over to my desk and stated "Best Biscotti Ever" and she is Italian. Thank you Thank you Thank you.  Great recipe. Use oil on your hands as you shape the loaves. The dough is a bit sticky. I also use parchment paper. The ends that one time went over it got overdone while the part on the paper came out great. So now I make sure I have totally covered my pans. I melted dark chocolate and put in a ziploc bag. Snipped the tip and drizzled over the finished biscotti. Very pretty and yummy.  TRY THIS RECIPE!!

My first attempt at making biscotti was a success! These came together really quickly and easily.  The dough was a bit hard to "shape"- I ended up kind of blobbing it into 3 logs on my baking sheet. It still ended up looking good, though! Not to sweet, nicely crunchy, and a little cranberry tartness kick.  I got about 25 good-sized cookies out of this recipe.

This is an easy, wonderful recipe. It was my first time making biscotti, so I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but they were so good they vanished from my house in under a day. To give it a little bit of a kick, I dipped the ends in dark orange chocolate. I will be making these again soon!

These were delicious! Not quite as dry and hard as some biscotti. A bit hard to slice after the first bake-be very careful, use a serated knife and go slow or they will crumble. Christmas guests loved them so much, I made more for New Years brunch.

I very rarely follow a recipe as it is printed, but besides drizzling white chocolate over the finished product, I didn't change a thing! They are fantastic every time! I get asked for the recipe whenever I serve them. I almost feel guilt with how truly simple they are to make.

These were yummy! I used dried cherries and vanilla baking chocolate pieces... The only problem came when I was slicing the "loaf". The slices sort of fell apart when I cut them. Otherwise, delicious!

I loved the flavor as did everyone who tried them.  Great with coffee.  We had it with our brunch on Christmas morning.

I make this with dried rasberries rather than the cranberries.  Everyone who has had some thinks it's terrific.

I wanted it not so tangy and used dried cherries and it was great. It held together nice and baked up wonderful.

I made this for my kids and they loved it so much they had eaten the entire batch within a few hours. I did make one slight alteration in that I added sliced almonds. Fabulous recipe!

These were pretty good, however, for our tastes, we felt that the amount of cranberries and white choc. chips should have been larger.  We didn't really get much of the cranberry or chocolate taste with each bite.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Brenda Keith!

I've never made Biscotti & don't remember ever eating any. But I don't think it can get any better than this!! Wonderful!!!! On a side note, I wasn't sure how thick to get it. I looked at some other recipes & 1/2 in thick seems to be the best. It turned out great. Thanks :)

Thank you for such a great recipe!  I look forward to trying this again with another type of chocolate.  These tasted better the next day, when they were able to dry out a little bit more.

This recipe is awesome and so easy. Everyone I sent it to at Christmas loved it. A friend of mine even wanted me to make more and she said she would buy it from me. It's my new daily treat with my morning coffee. So wonderful!

Just made this for some Christmas gifts. Making biscotti is so much simpler than it seems, I'll never buy it from a coffee shop again!
Other than using dried cherries rather than cranberries, I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great. I'd probably add more dried fruit next time, and maybe leave out the vanilla chips, they don't seem to add much to the flavor.

Awesome recipe!  I cooked them initially on 325 for 30 min, then cooked them at 350 for 10 min, flipped them, then 10 min on the other side.  I found it kept them from burning.  I also drizzled them with white chocolate...My kits when NUTS for them!

This is a nice variation from the usual biscotti that I bake.  I made the recipe exactly as written and was very satisfied with the results.  The biscotti has nice flavor and is excellent with a cup of coffee.  For ease in shaping the logs I recommend lightly flouring your hands and lining the baking sheet with parchment paper.

I am new to making biscotti. This was such an easy recipe! I didn't realize the dough would spread so I had all three "loaves" on one sheet. They were just crowded and thankfully didn't run into each other. Next time I will use two cookie sheets. They were very crumbly when I was trying to cut them so I "lost" a few and had to eat them. I added a whole cup of cranberries because I love them so much in bakes goods.  Next time when I cook them, I will keep it at 350 but after I cut them and cook them a second time, I will reduce the heat to 250 because they got darker than I wanted them to get.  I will use this again and again! Thanks!

These are great - love the flavour and texture. I would probably add more "stuff" next time (cranberries and chocolate) though maybe it's because I ate some of them before I added them to the mix!!!
