Really good and simple sauce!  I cheated and used concentrated lemon instead of reducing fresh lemon juice.... it turned out wonderful!  Will use this again and again!

I'm so glad I found this recipe!
I made it last night and it was amazingly simple.   The only thing I did differently was that I used Challenge European unsalted butter which was available at the regular grocery instead of going to the specialty store for Irish or Norwegian butter.
I served it with salmon (like Chef John suggested) and sea scallops .  I seasoned the food with sea salt and black  pepper  then cooked it in a skillet with some more butter and a little olive oil.  It was delicious and could easily rival a dish from an upscale restaurant.  I will absolutely be making this anytime I make seafood or fish.
Thanks for sharing. Chef John:)

This was a delicious sauce - before I ruined it.  I think I overcooked or cooled it too fast -  it separated, my standard MO.  It was sooo good before I killed it.

This was DELICIOUS! I used skin on salmon and served over rice pilaf and sauted green beans.  I may have used a bit too much lemon juice but with this technique the sauce was perfectly velvet smooth. It was so good I served it on the side and dipped my green beans in it too! Amazing, thanks for the recipe!

We melted the butter first, almost got it to brow, then added garlic to the butter. Added lemon juice.   After a minute or two we whisked in the cream. When it thickened, we added black pepper and parsley and served. Was great on our flounder, asparagus and rice. Delish!

Loved the final flavor of this! I used it as the sauce for a vegetarian pasta and it tasted great. The flavors melted together wonderfully. I will definitely use this one again.

I didn’t have to change anything. My family loved it. I made it to put on top of the skillet sautéed pork chops.

Basically you made a buerre blanc. I'd use dill. More Norwegian/Scandavian that way.

I  liked the recipe. Never made a butter sauce before, or ever. The recipe was simple to follow and easy for a first timer like me. The only thing is the lemon was a bit strong for my taste. Next time I will use one lemon instead of two.  Thanks for the recipe, it was great!!

I absolutely loved this sauce. I made it as the recipe directed and used it with large sauteed shrimp. I couldn't stop eating it. Will definitely make again. In fact I may make it tomorrow.

This is the second time I have made this incredible sauce.  I couldn't find parsley in my grocery so I used chives instead.  It was still amazing!!!!  Thank you Chef John you have never let me down!!!!!!!
