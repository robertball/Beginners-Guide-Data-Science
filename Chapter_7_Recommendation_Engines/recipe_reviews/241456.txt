Homemade granola puts store bought granola to shame! This one is very good, and I'm having a hard time keeping from nibbling on it. I did halve the recipe (which still makes plenty), and added a sprinkle of cinnamon before mixing together. After the 20 minutes in the oven, I stirred it one more time, put if back in the oven, shut the oven off  and cracked the oven door open a bit. It cooled and crisped up perfectly, and was golden brown. Will make this again!

Great breakfast or snack. Using all maple syrup tastes great as well

This recipe is a keeper. This granola makes a great topping for my homemade yogurt. It even tastes good by itself as a snack.
