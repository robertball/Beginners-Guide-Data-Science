I had to make it without the broccoli the first time because of a friends allergy but it is even better with the broccoli! Great dish!

This seemed like a lot more work than it was worth.  You've got the oven on, pasta boiling on one burner, milk and flour and the cheeses trying to burn up on the other burner, and melted butter shooting all over your microwave--all for this one SIDE DISH.  I made a double batch so I could share with a friend and their family seemed to like it. I was just happy my husband was doing the chicken in the smoker because no other food could be prepared in my kitchen while this was being made.

Excellent dish!  Rave reviews from my whole family, including my very picky son who hates trying anything new.  Everyone asked for seconds!  Was not difficult to make - I started sautéing my onions & garlic after the pasta & broccoli had cooked, so I wasn't trying to do everything all at once.  It came out just fine doing it that way.  I also used chickpea pasta instead of regular pasta...couldn't even tell the difference.  May add a touch more salt next time, but will definitely make again!

Picked this recipe to use the broccoli I had at home. It had been sitting in my freezer for a while due to my husbands extreme dislike for broccoli. Thought how could you go wrong with macaroni n cheese! This was a perfect for my 1 1/2 year old too. Shopping for ingredients - Easy. making it - u will use about four pots including the casserole dish! This was the only down side! Besides the big clean up it was a hit for my little family! Jr ate a whole cup :)

I make something very like this but never thought to add the cream cheese and garlic. Great idea! I do use more cheese (some aged Gouda US nice with the sharp cheddar) and my secret ingredients: mustard powder and a touch of hot sauce in the cheese sauce. Glad I found this version to riff off of.

I made this over the weekend. I doubled the recipe so I could put in kids’ lunch over the week, and I ended up inviting friends over for an impromptu lunch. First, I had almost no leftovers because people loved it! I personally thought it could be a bit cheesier, but obviously I was in the minority. Only change: I used Brussels sprouts instead of broccoli because that’s what I had on hand. Thank you!!

Stouffers was our go to and then I decided to attempt this!! I handmade the pasta and used dark meal chicken, also fresh broccoli. I mixed the cheese recipe up a little and used half Italian blend and half medium cheddar. The results are in! MY FAMILY LOVED IT MORE THAN STOUFFERS!

Great recipe!
I cooked the noodles and left them in strainer while I used same pot to saute onions,garlic, and broccoli and make cheese sauce. Then I just poured the noodles back into the pot, mixed it with cheese sauce, and poured into a disposable pan. Like another user suggested, I melted butter for crumbs in the microwave. Didn't find it to dirty too many pots.

Changes:
White whole wheat flour instead of all purpose
Smart balance instead of butter
Frozen broccoli instead of fresh
Whole wheat panco crumbs and mixed it with Italian seasoning
Shredded cheddar mozzarella cheese mixture

Delicious! I used plain greek yogurt in replacement of cream cheese, and I used sliced pepper jack cheese in replacement of shredded cheddar cheese. SO good! I highly recommend trying my version, especially if you like a little spicy kick to your food. :)

This is a very good dish.  A smidge labor intensive though.  Lots of pots/dishes used to make it.  I added some roasted chicken, which turned out well.  Not as much of a cheesy punch as I was hoping for, I think next time I will use extra sharp cheddar and see what happens.

I am surprised to read some reviewers complain about too many dishes and alot of cleaning up. .!
This recipe doesn't require more work or more dishes than most mac and cheese recipes ! You will need a pot to boil the pasta, a saucepan or skillet to make the cheese sauce and a casserole dish to bake the casserole . For melting the butter, honestly, use a soup bowl in the microwave and put it in the dish washer when you're done !
This recipe didn't take me any more time or effort than my usual macaroni and cheese recipe. I liked the  flavor from the onion and garlic and the addition of broccoli made this an easy one dish meal. My minor changes were using  4 wedges of the "laughing cow" cheese for cream cheese and Panko bread crumbs for regular. I was out of those 2 ingredients.
