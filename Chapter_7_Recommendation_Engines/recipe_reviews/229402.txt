This is a good recipe for cinnamon rolls.  I left out the pecans and maple extract, because I didn't have any, and I accidentally rolled the dough the wrong way, so I came out with 10 giant rolls, but I just cut them in half to serve.  :)  The bread part came out fluffy, and the taste was sweet, but not too sweet.  My glaze was too thick to drizzle, but (since I didn't have a lot of time to continue adding butter), I just smeared it thinly with a spoon, and it melted a bit.  I would use this recipe again.

This recipe is really great!!!!  This is the 3rd or 4th cinnamon roll recipe I've tried and it was by far the best. Definitely a plan-ahead thing as there is a lot of time for rising of the dough, but it's totally worth it. I used the "perfect cinnamon roll icing" recipe because I wanted cream cheese icing that was a bit thicker so I cannot comment on the maple icing but I will probably try it next time. My family said better than cinnabon in the mall. I would not skip the butter and sugar in the bottom of the pan if you are going for that Cinnabon buttery sugar crusted bottom, but the rolls would be more bready on the bottom if you skipped it- i would at least put 1/2-1/4 of the sugar and butter on the bottom of the pan if you were going for less. I took the lead of another person that commented and used brown sugar in the filling instead of white and it turned out amazing.  this will be my go too cinnamon bun recipe. The search is over!

I doubled the filling but used brown sugar. I put 1/2 the mixture on the bottom of the baking pans. It makes a caramelized base preventing sticking or burning. (A trick I use from baking in a camper oven).

Good basic recipe but needs tweaking- first of all, to make as directed for 18 rolls the dough was very thick. I think you could easily make 24 if you roll the dough out thinner, and I will next time. I will also remember that after the second rise, the rolls will double in size again in the oven, so leave plenty of room in the pan. Need to use a deeper pan or leave room around the edges, because when they bake the filling will melt and may drip out over the sides if you put too many rolls in there.

Bella, I'm betting your yeast was bad. There is no way this recipe could produce anything but terrific cinnamon rolls!

I enjoyed making this and it turned out very delicious but there are a few things I would change in the recipe. When I first started mixing the 8 cups of flour into the dough it worked out fine, then when I was supposed to knead the remaining four cups into the dough it started to get super dry and I ended up having to mix at least 3/4 of a cup of water in to get the right consistency. Second, when making the frosting at the end don't use four cups of sugar. After my flour incident, I decided to add in three cups at first instead of the four that it said to add in the instructions and it still ended up incredibly dry. I had to add almost a half cup butter in for the consistency to be thin enough for me to pour over the finished cinnamon rolls. I hope this was valuable advice for anyone hoping to make this dish in the future.

Good recipe! I used brown sugar instead of white for the filling and the bottom of the pan. The one thing I will try differently next time is to spread softened butter on the dough instead of melted butter.

Awesome recipe. The real deal. I will try baking it in two dishes though because it was overflowing the 9 x 13 dish as it baked. They were mutant rolls! Also not sure about the glaze - I added milk to it for a frosting. The maple extract is an amazing touch though! So delicious!

My family loved these.  They were very big as others stated so I did cut them smaller and made two pans.  One pan for now one for later.  I froze them before the last rise.  When we wanted them I put a pan in the fridge to defrost and rise overnight.  They were perfect.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is super scrumptious! Towards the end of the recipe it asks to spread butter (melted) and 1/3 cup of sugar on top of the cinnamon rolls; instead I used the cinnamon and sugar and pecan filling on top instead to keep the flavor going.

These took four hours to complete.  I liked the end result but will probably only make them occasionally because of the time involved.  
I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar for cinnamon mixture.  I probably will leave dough a little thicker next time.  Spreading dough according to measurements in recipe made them too thin between layers and the end result was harder sugar centers.  The dough portion was chewy and soft, just like a cinnamon roll should be.  By far best dough recipe I've found.  I made my icing thicker but because it was so late by the time I finished I wpread it on top while rolls were still too warm.  End result was more of a glaze topping.  I will continue to tweak this  until I have the desired roll.  It's an excellent base recipe.

Don’t think I will ever again buy can cinnamon buns. The best buns ever.  Lots of work but soo worth it.  I did as others recommended, sort of!  I used 1/4 cup of white sugar and the rest brown sugar for filling.  I also used used less than s 1/3 cup of white sugar on the bottom of baking dish. Oh and I almost always use a little almond flavor w/ vanilla.  With out a doubt one of my favorites.

You know you have a great recipe when you receive compliments of "you could put these in a box and sell them!" 
The dough is slightly sweet and tender. Buttering and sugaring the pan is a great touch. 
This is one of the best recipes I've used on this site. Thank you for sharing!

These are amazing! After many attempts with different recipes, I’ve landed on this one as the only recipe I’ll use. I’ve been making them for years now, and always get rave reviews. They’re absolutely delicious! The dough is a dream to roll out—very easy to work with. I use cream cheese frosting instead of the glaze in this recipe. I’ve also made these two different ways—using the butter/sugar mixture in the bottom of the pan, and omitting it. Both ways are excellent, though I usually omit it—I haven’t noticed a categorical difference in taste, and it saves a step.

Best recipe I have found so far. Made cream cheese icing for on top. Also switched a cup of the white sugar for the center with brown sugar for that traditional cinnamon roll look and taste. Definitely not something to do very often as it takes a while for prep and rising. But worth it nonetheless. Nothing but rave reviews for breakfast!

I substituted the white sugar for brown sugar for the filling and eliminated the white sugar for the bottom of the pan. It turned out o. k.  I got 12 rolls instead of 15 since I like the rolls bigger 
For the icing I used only 1 C. of icing sugar, 4 T butter and 1 tsp of vanilla and a few drops of milk. 
The only problem I had was that not all the buns were golden brown after baking it for 35 mins. Maybe I should have brushed the top with butter before baking them.

These cinnamon rolls came out great!  I used part of the dough cycle on my bread machine to do the kneading for me.  I added the last cup of flour after putting the dough onto the floured surface.  This recipe makes a huge batch of soft, fluffy, high rolls.  The sweet spread sticks nicely to the sides of the rolls after baking.  The maple icing was a delicious match to what you'd get on bakery maple donuts, but a better consistency.  So many nice things could be said about this recipe!  Was especially fun to make the sugar-coated baking dish for the rolls.

Made for our Easter morning- delicious smell throughout the house.  Have made many different versions of Cinnamon Rolls- this one was about the same as most of the others- BUT these rolls were heaven. Did not have any maple flavoring- so just omitted that.  Made mine very large- hubby could not wait until I pulled them out of the oven!  Girls, these will get a man to marry you!!  Enjoy!  :)

I made these tonight. I added 5 tsp of yeast and mixed mine in a stand mixer. There was way too much sugar cinnamon to sprinkle. This can be reduced so you don't have much left over. I did not put butter and sugar in bottom of pan. Glad I avoided that. Turned out perfect...

I just made this - my first cinnamon rolls ever. I adjusted the amounts for 9 servings, which made one spring form (10 inches I think?) full. They were just excellent! I used brown sugar and no nuts, but I don't think it would have been different with white sugar. Everybody loved them. I didn't use the glaze, but "The Perfect Cinnamon Roll Icing" recipe (also cut down to 9 servings). I don't live in the U.S., so I thought cinnamon rolls were too advanced or just not doable with good results, but these are fantastic. THANK YOU so much for sharing the recipe!

I've made these several times now and they are amazing. Super easy to make and fun to share with my co-workers and family. Used a different icing recipe because I wanted to use a cream cheese icing but otherwise these are great!
