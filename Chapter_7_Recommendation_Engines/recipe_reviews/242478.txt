These were amazing! My husband and I raved about them! They were EVEN better the next day! We've already made these twice more this month! A quick and easy lunch! Perfect wraps and super simple with the use of Uncle Ben's Ready Rice!
We used lettuce from our garden instead of shredded. I also julienne cut the carrots and added them into the wraps. It was a perfect addition. Thanks for a great recipe!

Whipped these up for dinner after a long day at work and they came together in a flash. It is not often that I am in and out of the kitchen in less than 10 minutes and I thoroughly enjoyed the break. These are full of flavor and make for a perfect summertime meal and using the Uncle Ben's Ready Rice makes them that much easier to prepare. Can't wait to try them with barbeque sauce!

Made this to eat on my break at work the other day. Absolutely delicious and filling enough to help me survive the rest of my shift. The buffalo adds a tangy kick to it. Will be making this for my breaks for now on!

Yum! I can't believe I've never thought to do this! I usually always have these ingredients around. I only had Black Rice so I cooked it in the oven earlier in the day. I also added some avocado that needed to be used. Very easy and fast dinner. It will also make a wonderful lunch tomorrow! Thanks for sharing the recipe.
