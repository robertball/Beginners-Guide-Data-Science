This recipe was good but medium is too high to cook the eggs thoroughly on the inside.  I had to turn the heat down to medium low so that all the egg was cooked properly.

Very good and easy to make! I cut this down to one serving for a three egg omelet.  I didn't use turkey meat and just eyeballed the ingredients.  I added a little salt and pepper.  Perfect with a side of multi-grain toast and orange juice.

This is similar to what I did but I won't eat hard types of cheese in omelets. I use nacho cheese sauce.

This was super yummy! I cooked the onion and meat in a bit of butter, also adding diced turkey sausage patties, for about 5 minutes, then added the bell pepper and two shakes of dried parsley since I didn't have fresh, and cooked for another 7-8 minutes. I also added the tomato, salt and pepper in the last 2 minutes. Once done, I placed a small layer of finely shredded fiesta blend cheese on one half of the cooked egg (sprayed pan I used for egg with an olive oil spray and beat egg with salt and pepper added), then placed the mixture on top and folded the egg over that. Served some with sour cream and salsa. GREAT breakfast, thanks!!

I had never made an Omelet before and this recipe was helpful! I followed another review and cooked over med lo heat. I should have let it cook a tad longer though. The only thing I didn't have on hand was tomato but it was still tasty!!

Easy to make.  I sauted the pepper, added sweet onion and 1/4 c of chopped pineapple.  Also used only ham. I also added blue cheese.  It will be a Sunday morning staple.

I didn't have the turkey or the tomatoe, so I just left that part out. Still, very good though!

My husband said I really raised the bar with this recipe.  I didn't have any ham or turkey, so with just cheese, tomato, bell peppers and green onions, I still found this recipe easy-to-use and had excellent results!

I left out the sliced turkey because I did not have any. I also used red pepper instead of green. Very filling.

This was my first time making an omelette. I used cut up deli shaved ham and two kinds of grated cheese.
It was delicious but huge. Next time I will use just two eggs.

Simple and delicious! I just used ham, cheddar and pepper jack cheese, b/c that's how hubby likes it.  I topped it with cheese hearts, which turned out really cute. Served with hash browns~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
