Found this to be rather bland and not at all gloopy like a sloppy joe should be.  I added about 1 t. salt and some course ground pepper.  Added a bit of vegetable juice, still sorta boring.  Then tried a healthy shot of bbq sauce and that seemed to do the trick.  Now, I do admit to using fire roasted diced tomatoes vs. crushed, could that be a factor?  And glad I only used 2 t. chili powder, still big chili powder taste.

We loved this. Made it with beef instead of turkey.  Thought is was even better the next day.
