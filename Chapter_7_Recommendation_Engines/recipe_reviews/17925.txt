I had to do some tweaking with this recipe, but it's the closest I'd found to what my grandmother used to make. It took 3 tries to get it, but it was worth it. I reduced the water and butter to 1/4 C. Otherwise the roll is too mushy. I also cooked the roll til brown, about 45 minutes, then removed to another cake pan. I cooked the milk sauce until thickened and then poured it over the roll.. Yummy!

Growing up in MS I had the luxury of both eating this recipe and witnessing the cooking methods of many-an-ole white woman....Different people would use slightly different approaches--NEVER read from a recipe mind you--techniques taught to them as kids and passed on.  For those that have problems with this one: pretend you are making a thick cobbler pie/with no fruit.  Between each layer of dough-add a splash of the milk sauce.  Cover the entire top with dough, and keep this "top" moist while cooking by spreading milk sauce over it every few minutes.  Hope this helps out!

I have made this recipe for years and I had to come on here and bring some light to the recipe. First if you use carnation milk it will be a thicker sauce and make enough to pour over once you start serving.  Now with the roll, you need to make the dough, roll it out and layer it with sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon and pieces of unsalted butter over the entire roll.  You should be able to make 2 rolls with this recipe.  Once you layer it then roll it up.  Cut it in small rolls from this and put it in a baking sheet.  Bake the rolls for 30 min by them self  until its golden brown, then 15 more min with half of the cream sauce poured over it.  This will prevent it from being mushy and you will be able to have a light flaky crust with a semi moist center.  AGAIN save additional sauce for later.

Good basic start, which means that one can "customize".  Use brown sugar and evaporated milk; instead of milk and white sugar this makes a caramel sauce.  Umm!  Use a raisins, pecans or granola with a sprinkle of cinnamon on the flat dough before you roll it up.  In the milk sauce use a teaspoon of vanilla.... Lord have mercy!  All of which I have tried with great results.

My aunt has been making butter rolls for years.  This summer she finally made another.  I stood by and wrote down everything she did.  This idoes not turn out like hers.  She adds baking powder so they rise and are very fluffy.  She also adds cinnamon along with the nutmeg , doesn't heat the milk (whole milk) and we cut the butter into small slices and layed on the dough instead of spreading it over the dough.  Try this and I think you will love it.

This was o.k.  It's nothing more than pie dough (therefore, it shouldn't rise)slathered in a custard sauce.  One could save time by purchasing prepared pie dough.  I think it would taste much better if butter were used in place of the shortening.  The amount of butter spread over the dough is too much & could easily be cut down to 1/2 a stick, especially if butter were substituted for the shortening.  Also, creaming the butter, sugar, & spice together would keep the sugar/spice from falling out when transferring the rolls to the baking dish.  This recipe has potential & I am wondering what other flavors besides vanilla would be good to use - orange, lemon, or perhaps banana pecan flavoring.

This recipe is a flash back to my grandma! This tasted very similar to hers however but she always added cinnamon to hers and used evaporated milk.  She taught me how to make a quick version of this...take a can of regular store bought biscuits, roll them out on a little flour so they are flat, put butter sugar and cinnamon on the dough, then fold over and press the sides together.  Then cook just as you would the homemade version.  SOOOO Good! Thanks for the recipe!

When I was a little girl my grandmother would make butter rolls every Sunday before church.  After church we would my family would look forward to after dinner for our butter roll delight. This recipe is very similar to what we had.

After more than an hour in the oven the centers were still not quite done leaving a sugary sauce/biscuit soup.  Some of the sauce bubbled over even though I used the right size pan.  Not a good result.

My husband has told me about his Mama's butter roll since we were married ten years ago.  His Mom didn't have a recipe so I never tried to make it.  He loved this butter roll.  The only changes I made to the recipe were I used butter and shortening verses just shortening, I added one teaspoon of baking powder to the dough and I also added cinnamon over the rolled dough.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I have been reading the comments and pondering whether to use this recipe as the basis for an attempt to recreate what I remember as one of the most delicious and favorite dessert memories to come out of my late grandma's kitchen.  It was, no doubt, one of the most requested items in our family.  My grandma told me she recalled watching her mother make it when she was growing up in the hills of Kentucky in the 1920's.  It was a childhood favorite of hers.  There was no recipe, of course.  Like most old country recipes, it was all by look, feel and generations of intuition.  She has been gone for over three years now, and I would love to serve this to my dad on his birthday, as there are just so many memories attached to this in our family.  I remember that she did not roll it up into a jelly roll shape.  Hers were individual longer pieces folded over in the middle and spread out on a baking pan.  She would spread butter, sugar and cinnamon and bake until they were nice and brown.  I don't recall her pouring any liquid over it when it cooked.  The sauce was served warm, on the side, in a big glass pitcher.  So many of the comments I read on this recipe are coming from people like me, who are trying to reach back in time a pull out a very cherished memory.  It is always amazing to me how much of a connection there is to food and some of our fondest memories.  It can be a powerful and emotional link to our past.

I've made these rolls many times now, and I just love them. If you're looking for something like cinnamon rolls, these are not it, they have a flaky biscuit-like texture. I have another recipe very similar to this that calls for vegetable oil instead of shortening, which works very well if you don't want to take the time to cut in the shortening. These are good with or without the milk being poured on before baking. You can pour a little milk or cream on each individual serving after they've baked.

This is a recipe that my grandmother used to make us after much begging and pleading...we knew she would fix them much to our delight. I've not tried this recipe but I do remember that she poured her milk mixture over the rolls when they were about done. Looking forward to trying this with my tweak on adding the milk.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I was raised by my grandmother, and she used to make the best butter rolls. She is no longer here to give me the recipe, and this is just like she used to make! She would be proud!

these are very unusual... you're kind of expecting cinnamon rolls...but they're not! they were good - but we cooked them an extra 8 minutes so they weren't too gluey.  i am betting this is some traditional dish i was never exposed to!  i will try making one more time - they were all eaten!

I wasn't crazy about these rolls right out of the oven. They were much better after hardening in the fridge for about a day. Then they tasted more like a shortbread cookie. Otherwise, they were just greasy and mushy.

I made these for my family, and although they look good... we didn't get much out of them. We didn't like the milk mixture poured over it, and my dad thought they were a little "blah". Although I have to admit. After a couple of days of them sitting in the fridge, they tasted better...

Had been searching and searching and found this on the site a few years ago. For those who know, this is it! My mother, (the expert), added a bit more milk, and as an occasional variation, canned peaches and a bit of brown sugar! Gives it a creamy peach cobbler type appeal. Thanks much!

I am officially in a food coma!

My mother in law said she made it and so I decided to see what was all the fuss about. I'm glad I did :D  I made it twice; once as written and once with evaporated milk. The evaporated milk is better...It lends a caramel rich taste. This is real.home.cooking. 

Thanks!

Thanks for the recipe, my grandmother used to make butter roll for my mom when she was little. Mom got to talking about that delicious butter roll one day when she was missing her mom, said she still remembered how good it tasted. I surprised her with this version, only I did it like her mom did - not cut into rolls but made longer and skinnier, rolled up, then placed whole in the pan, starting in the middle and going in a circle till all in. Since most of the milk sauce is absorbed and we like things saucy, I made an additional sauce with a can of tart cherries and the liquid, sugar and water, little lemon juice, thickened with cornstarch and stirred in a little butter when done, served on the side. Mom just ate hers plain as she remembered and loved it. Thanks again for helping give my mom a taste of her childhood!

I remember On Sunday's after church my Mother would make a Butter Roll, But I Don't quite remember her heating the milk I think heating the milk makes the dough gummy so it does not cook evenly.

This was my first butter roll. it came out good except for the fact i couldn't get my dough to roll out in a rectangle shape and i was confused about how to do a jelly roll so i ended up with 6 rolls instead of 12

I added 1/2 cup of milk and some cinnamon to the recipe because when I made it before, it was dry.  Cooked it a little longer also so the dough would get done.  I love this recipe !!!!!

I followed the recipe but had to get a substitution for the buttermilk since I didn't have any. It came out delicious!
