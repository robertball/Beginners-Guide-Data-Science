A good blend of flavors for a change. I added fresh ground black pepper to the mix.

This was great with Mahi Mahi on the Foreman  grill. I threw it on top of a salad with a balsamic glaze. Next time I'll make some dressing with the sauce.

Great flavor!  Didn't have cumin but really flavorful without.  Added some black pepper and voila!  My husband asked for seconds before he finished his "firsts".

I didn't put the ingredients in a blender, I just mixed it in a bowl and used it like a marinated rub.  This is delish!  This is my first recipe from this site and turned out Great!

Very good and very easy.  I didn't find it as sweet as some other commenters did it, the sweetness was necessary for the barbecue taste. The spice mix was quite good.

Seasoning is way too sweet and overpowering. Would've been better with half of the amount.

Found this recipe by using the "search by ingredients" feature (love, love, love this feature!!!). In the freezer I had a package of Trader Joe's Chana Masala (Indian chick pea dish) and garlic naan (Indian flatbread). Searched for (fresh caught sockeye) salmon and cumin, and voila, this recipe! Even when marinated in juice for only 20 minutes and grilled indoors in a George Foreman, it had great nuanced flavors and made a perfect entrée to go with my sides.
