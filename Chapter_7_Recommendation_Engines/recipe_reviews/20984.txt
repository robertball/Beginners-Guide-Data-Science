My husband and I LOVE this dip!  The only reason I put 4 rather than 5 stars is because we add quite a bit of parmesan cheese to the original recipe.  Otherwise, it is fantastic.  We have served it many times to guests, and it is always a hit.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was really good and rich.  I did add a little mozzarella cheese about 1/4 cup to it though. And I sprinkled a little grated parmesan cheese on top.  Really good recipe though I suspect the quality of crab meat you use makes all the difference.  I used Kroger's "private selections" lump crab meat and was pleased with the quality for about 5 bucks for a 6 oz. can.  Served alongside Tostitos restaurant style tortilla chips.

After a while we stopped putting it on crackers and just scooped it right into our mouths on spoons!  It was so good we were embarassed at how much we ate.  I highly highly highly recommend this recipe.  You can add a bit of chopped celery to it if you like.

I used half an 8 oz container of spreadable light cream cheese, light mayo, no onion, 1 can of crab, and a lot of lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste.  I just microwaved the mixture for 4 minutes, stirring halfway.  It came out perfect with warm (microwaved) whole wheat pita bread.  So easy, and so delicious!  Thank you!

Excellent! I served it to 15 adults and 6 children with "wheat thin" crackers and I should have made a double batch.

I baked this in a hollowed out round bread loaf, reserving the the removed bread chunks for dipping, and baked it with the heated filling 'till the bread was lightly toasted on top. Yummy! Thanks

This was okay, but nothiong special. I thought the worchestershire flavor was overpowering and the crab was lost. Also, it could have used a little kick.

Loved this recipe and after reading reviews I decided to reduce the mayo to 1 Tablespoon and added several swipes of cheddar cheese from a stick I had in the refrigerator. Since I didn't have a green onion, I used one tablespoon of chopped onion and sprinkled paprika on top. I split this into two small bowls to fit the serving tray. Once brown on top the dip looked like little souffles.  I brought this warm to a party and did not make it out of the kitchen without the first bowl almost done and within the first few minutes the dip was nearly gone.  I had a dip recipe that I had been using for years and just thought about changing it up a little and was very pleased with the results.  This is our New crabmeat dip.

Really good flavor and very versatile too. I sometimes add some quartered artichoke hearts and some firm cubed tofu to this recipe, when I do that I double the worcestershire and lemon juice. When made like that it is more of a meal than a dip. Sometimes it's my lunch and dinner.

Very good. Made it at a party and it was a huge hit. That being said it could have had a bit more taste to it other than the taste of cream cheese as delicious as that is.

Yumm-o! My only complaint is that I can't stop eating it when I make it so it's only a once in awhile dish! I serve it with Xochitl tortilla chips (a fancy organic brand that tastes amazing) for a delicious gluten free appetizer.

I made this for Christmas eve.  It was good.  I made some changes.  I used garlic powder. I also used more lemon and a pinch of old bay.  I used the suggested amount of mayo and to me it was a little runny. So, next time I am gonna cut down on mayo amount.

I made this, following the recipe fairly exactly, maybe adding a bit of Old Bay. I did not enjoy it, but everyone else at the party did.

I tried this because I couldn't find my recipe and it seemed similar. I thought it was a tad bland but figured out it was because mine called for Red Hot and Old Bay Seasoning.  I loved it with those 2 additions - just a suggestion. I also doubled the crab.

Excellent!  I made a few adjustments to suit my personal tastes adding two more green onions chopped, a tsp of Zatarain's Creole Seasoning, a dash of kosher salt and a light dusting of garlic powder.  A definite do again!

This was really bland---I used an entire bunch of green onions but it was still blah.....maybe some tabasco or horseradish or Old Bay would help? The crab alone was 18 bucks. Glad I made a test batch before serving for Xmas.

Put ingredients the night before so they have time to meld together.  Bring mixture to room temperature before baking.  Be sure to double the receipe because it will go fast!

I used an 8 oz. can of crab instead of 6oz. I added some cheese into it as well, like cheddar or Monterey Jack. Just a handful, a little less then 1 cup. I also sprinkled parm cheese on the top before baking. After done baking, I also turned the broiled on for like 2-3 minutes just to brown the top.

Easy to make and delicious!  A huge hit!  I added a couple of things that were delicious as well.  I added grated cheddar cheese (1 cup) and folded into the mix as well as 2 tsp of hot sauce.  That added a bit of zip to it without changing the overall taste.  Turned out really well.

Excellent crab dip recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and loved the results only I thought there was a little more mayo than necessary.  I'll happily make it again and cut back on the mayo and let the crab/Parmesan shine a bit more.

Delicious on toasted rye bread.  I mixed in a handful of shredded Parmesan cheese and browned a little extra cheese on top. I will make this again.

I made this in my mini crockpot. Left it on low & it stayed great for the entire football game. Only thing I did different was added 3/4 C of chopped cooked shrimp. End of game it was all gone.  Great recipe. Thanks!

We really didn't like this at all.  I ended up throwing it away and wasting the ingredients.

Very good, but needs some help. Made as written & for me it was under seasoned. I doubled the lemon Worcestershire, and green onion with a free tablespoons of sour cream. Then baked it with a top lated of Italian cheese blend. Then it was outstanding!

Good receipe, as most people i did alter it a bit.  I used Fresh Maryland Blue claw crab meat (KEY to any dip) Used Fresh Dunker cream cheese (another Yummy)  Omitted the green onions and added a couple dashes of onion powder and garlic powder, a squirt of mustard and some heavy dashes of Old Bay..

Absolutely loved this! I added some leftover roasted garlic I had in the kitchen...about 3 cloves of it, and the flavor was nice.

Very good. Easily doubled.  Equally as good substituting tiny shrimp for the crab. I felt adding a few dashes of hot sauce was just what it needed to make it zing!

Quick and Easy yummy recipe. It was a hit at our family gathering.  The only thing I might do different, is add extra crab meat to make it chunkier, but other than that it was exactly what I was looking for.

This was really good.  I read some of the reviews that said there wasn't enough crab taste, so I used more crab than called for.  Shouldn't have.  I like a creamy dip, and it wasn't creamy enough with the extra crab, but it was STILL DELICIOUS!  I WILL be making this again, according to the recipe, and just enjoy it!

Very tasty!! The only problem is that there wasn't enough...if you are planning a party I'd suggest to AT LEAST double it. I also added about a tsp of garlic powder for some more flavor

This was great, I added horseradish to it as had no worcestershire sauce & it worked well.  I did make the mistake of using a smaller can of crab & it was a little cheesier than I would've had it, but I'd definitely make this again.

This was great! I wanted an easy appy to take to a dinner. I doubled the crab and added a bit more green onion. I've made this twice now, and will make it again! Thanks!

This was a little bland, def needed more crab meat. This was my first time making ANY type of seafood dish, so it was actually pretty good and easy to make. I will make it again, however I will add more spices and meat to make this a 5 star recipe.

This was pretty good.  I added the cheese that was suggested.  I used white cheddar, it helped to thicken it.  It still needed something else.  I liked it enough to keep playing with it until I get it to where we want it.

I thought this recipe as is was very bland and too high fat without the zing.  I doubled the crab and I used the fresher kind you find in the refridgerated section of the fish department (the kind with an expiration date).  I used 3/4 the amount of cream cheese (and used low fat).  I added two tablespoons of sour cream, a little Old Bay seasoning, one clove of fresh garlic, and kosher salt.  I also used more green onion that it calls for.  Next time I'll use even less cream cheese, maybe 4 oz.   It's much more expensive to make it this way but otherwise, to me, the calories aren't worth it.

This recipe is quick and easy. My husband and I love the flavor. But we would like it a little more meaty so I'm going to add a extra can of crab next time.

I made this when we had friends over for a casual evening of TV and drinks... what a hit! I agree - another cheese might be tasty, and maybe less onion.
I am making again for girl's night this week!

This dip went over big! I used imitation crab and it was fine (just took some work to flake it). Next time I might add some cheese. Served with water crackers and pita chips.

Very tasty - although I probably would have doubled the recipe.  Didn't make tons... I used quite a bit more lemon than the recipe called for - felt it added some needed zing.  Quite good though - and very easy.
