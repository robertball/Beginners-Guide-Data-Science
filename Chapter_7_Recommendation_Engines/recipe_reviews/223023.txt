I apologize for having used oatmeal instead of Italian seasoned bread crumbs, but when I saw all the wonderful herbs in this recipe just I had to try it - regardless that I lacked bread crumbs in the pantry! I would have liked these flavorful little meatballs much more had they not been so salty. I will make these again (the oatmeal worked fine, by the way), but experiment by cutting the salt in half. Made per recipe, the salt is waaaay too much.

Way too much salt in the original recipe! I don't like using much salt in my food anyways, so I only used 1/2 tsp. I don't care for the chili powder, but the cilantro was certainly a unique addition. I think the sauce is key. As this is more a take on a Tex-Mex meatball, I think the sauce should be less Italian. Maybe an enchilada style sauce. Not a recipe I would repeat.

I took the previous reviewer's suggestion and halved the salt but it was still too salty. I really don't think you need any extra salt for this recipe.
