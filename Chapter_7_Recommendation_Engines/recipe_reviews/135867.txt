This is a good base recipe, but I had to make a lot of changes. I doubled it, added 2 tablespoons of sugar to the rice and coconut milk, used a tablespoon of butter, sauteed the tofu with the curry powder, and added garlic, ginger paste, salt and a little sugar to the sauce. I also used light coconut milk, steamed the green beans before adding, and added some baby corn. It turned out to be fantastic. I'm definitely making this again.

I really liked this recipe, but agree it needs salt and a little extra curry powder. I added about a tsp of sugar, raisins, and onions too. When I make it again, I will definitely steam the green beans before I add them to the mixture. They take forever to get tender and the sauce nearly disappears!

This recipe was great once it was tweaked.  I was afraid it would be too bland, so I added 1/4 tsp Madras curry powder (in addition to the regular curry powder), 1/4 tsp cumin and 1/4 tsp salt.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup coconut milk for more sauce.  I will definitely make this again!

A fantastic aroma fills the house during cooking and the taste lives up to the reviews. I added a sweet potato and baby corn for some extra color and nutrients.

I changed the recipe, but it was a great starting point. I used coconut curry marinated tempe cooked first in olive oil. Then I took that out of the pan and added large cut onion pieces and cooked those for a little while while steaming green beans, chunks of carrot and just 1/8 of a green bell pepper. I used about one cup of coconut milk and more than doubled the curry. I also used about1/4 tsp of garlic powder, 1/4 tsp-1/2 tsp of cumin and a pinch of red chili powder. I let that simmer for a while and served it over rice. YUM, YUM!!!

Very good recipe once it's tweaked. I love coconut and I love spicy food, so I feel I saved the recipe by adding salt, more curry, a little cilantro, and a little cumin to the tofu and beans. I also served it with a touch of coriander chutney on the side. Otherwise, it would have been far too bland.

Looking at the ingredients to this recipe, it looks like it should be a Thai curry rather than an Indian one.  I'm going to try this using green curry paste instead of curry powder, and I bet it will be fantastic.

I cook a lot of curry and this was awful. I did a lot to dress it up, added peas, corn, chili powder, cumin, cashews, salt/pepper, ect. Nothing could make it good.

This was very easy to make and really, really delicious. I added some dried basil and garlic salt to the tofu and green beans while they were cooking. Otherwise, no changes were needed - this is an excellent recipe. Thanks!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It sounds so easy and tasty, but the flavor left a lot to be desired.  I modified it as other raters suggested with extra coconut milk and curry, but still did not enjoy the dish.

A great basic recipe that just needs a few changes.  Following others suggestions, I added 1 teaspoon of sugar to the coconut rice and the following additional ingredients to the tofu & green beans: 1/4 teaspoon more curry, 1/4 teaspoon cumin, 1/4 teaspon salt, and a dash of garlic powder.  I also added more coconut milk to make it saucier.  Also, I steamed the green beans for about 2 minutes in the microwave before adding them to the tofu.  It came out delicious!

My only issue with this recipe is that it is far too small for a meal. For my husband, myself, and our toddler to eat I need to triple the recipe.

Srumptious flavor in this easy recipe! My hubby doesn't usually care for the texture of tofu, but he really liked this because the crunchy green beans masked the tofu texture.

I think this recipe provides a great base and starting point, but i think there needs to be more seasoning. I added  a lot more curry, probably about 2 tablespoons total because the tofu absorbs a lot of flavor. I also added a little soy sauce, salt, and pepper.

I liked the simplicity for a curry newb like me. The coconut rice was very good. I did, however, learn that I don't like tofu. Oops.  I'll try this again with chicken and more curry powder.

Pretty good.  Used chicken instead of tofu.  Need to cook raw green beans for a while.

Very good!  Both my daughter and I enjoyed this dish.  I added cilantro to give it a little more zip.  The green beans worked well...which surprised me!  Next time I will probably play around a little and add some different vegies, maybe some pine nuts or even a few raisins.

Love this recipe. I added carrots, garlic and cayenne. Alse used coconut Silk milk instead of the shelved canned coconut milk and coconut oil rather than butter. It made the recipe vegan and added to the targeted flavor.

I followed the advice of others and added more coconut milk as well as some veggie broth. I also added salt, garlic and ginger. I threw in some potatoes to the mix and it was all delicious. A bit hit all around.

Will not make again.  There are much better recipes using curry and coconut rice.

This was a little too bland for me.  Unfortunately, I can't suggest how to improve it since this was the first time I tried making a curry dish... though I've had plenty in restaurants.  I wouldn't make this again, but would rather keep looking for a tastier recipes.

Didn't care for this recipe.  It ended up being dry and kind of bland, despite adding extra curry powder.
