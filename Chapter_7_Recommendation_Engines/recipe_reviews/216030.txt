Not exactly what I was expecting.  I was looking for a recipe with lemon verbena because I have it in my garden.  Be prepared for a dryer batter.  The muffins turn out almost scone like.  Not as sweet as most muffins.  I was nervous when I pulled them out of the oven.  Once we started nibbling, we were pleasantly surprised.  I really like this recipe.  I'll use it again.

I have lemon verbena growing in my garden.  Made this recipe and everyone (even the skeptics) loved it.  Smelled and tasted fabulous.  Different and very tasty.

I didn't have lemon verbena so I put in some fresh lemon zest instead. Turned out very good this way. I might add a little bit more sugar doing it this way next time though (unless you don't like muffins very sweet). Either way, it turned out good.

Quite tasty! I would definitely call these scones, though, rather than muffins. Will definitely make them again.

I also grow lemon verbena in my garden and wanted somethg to try it out on. A lovely recipe, but you really can't taste the lemon verbena. Maybe I will add more next time? The batter is scone like but I pored mine into oiled mini loaf pans and they turned out perfect, they do have a slight green color to them which is a novelty and they will be perfect with my tea tonight, :)
