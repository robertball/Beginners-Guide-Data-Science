second time making this recipe.   I didnt have any fresh herbs so I used dried.  we added baking powder to the dough.  when we form them into patties we put a tiny bit of water on the outside while forming them, add the sesame seeds then deep fry them. no issues of falling apart. I even brushed a couple with a small amount of olive oil and baked them, they turned out wonderful.   reminds my Egyptian husband of home.  thank you for this recipe!

Came out fabulous!  The mix held together well and fried up nicely.  Delicious flavor.  I only had a white onion, but that worked out just fine.  I know I should't change the recipe, but thought the dill would be strange, so I did omit that.  The cilantro and parsley added the perfect  green color and herb flavor for me.  This will be a new staple food!

These were delicious, but I could not get them to stay together once I began frying them. The mixture came together beautifully and held together great until I put them in the oil. They never really crisped up and they began falling apart. Still tasted great though. I'm gonna try to figure out how to keep them together better next time b/c they are definitely worth trying again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this the other night and as other people have said, the taste was good (I used chickpeas since that's what I had) but they completely fell apart while cooking. I read on another site that you CANNOT use canned or cooked chickpeas(which I did) and you should stick it in the fridge again for about an hour before cooking, so, that answers that. I gave it 3 stars because I feel that's an important note left out and even though it tasted good, it wasn't great. I'll try again though to make it better.

5 stars From my Egyptian Husband ! Omitted the Dill and Sesame Seeds and made a simple tahini sauce. Served with Pita and all the traditional accompaniments!  Rabena Ka-Lieky Habibity

Tasted great, but I had an issue with consistency. I wound up baking these instead of frying them as they sort of melted in the pan. Sadly, baking dried the recipe out a bit, so I would need to think of new ways to make this recipe work.
