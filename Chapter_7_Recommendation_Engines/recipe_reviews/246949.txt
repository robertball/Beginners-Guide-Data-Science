A well rounded and tasty salsa. Hatch Chile's have a bit more kick than an Anaheim Chile.

I thought this was great, though I substantially cut back on the tomatoes (one 15-oz can) based on other reviews. (Note that this change made it quite spicy, by upping the ratio of peppers to tomatoes.) Added plenty of salt at the end as well.

Left out the tomatoes with roasted garlic and it came out perfect.  Also needed salt and pepper to taste.

I like thinner Salsa. This has great taste. I use an emulsifier or hand blender. You can use Food Processor...  .

Really good and super easy. I cut the recipe in half and liked the ratio.  It was pretty spicy though I removed some seeds. Obviously size of your chiles might be different but I think I used some big ones.
