Like most others, I used cream of mushroom  soup and added at least 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  I left out the flour and baked the dish once everything was mixed.  We have made it quite a few times already.

This recipe was WONDERFUL as is!!!! But I am a huge garlic and mushroom lover, so I added minced garlic and LOTS of chopped fresh mushrooms (I sauteed the garlic, onion, and mushrooms first to make them more tender however).  Great recipe, so easy!!

Very good, simple and quick recipe.  I added about a half of a cup of fresh grated parmesean cheese and a teaspoon of celery salt.  Perfect for a last minute addition to any meal.

Sorry, but my husband and I thought this one needed a little help and extra flavor. We used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery. We did not add extra salt due to the salt content in the soup. We used minced fresh garlic instead of garlic salt and added 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/3 - 1/2 cup parmesan cheese.  Still bland. Next time I will experiment more and use fresh spinach. I think I will also add some chopped bacon for additional flavor.

I like that it was easy to fix.I used 
97 precent fat free soup and Promise light margiarin so it is lower in points if you are on weight
watchers.It is  1 point per serving. My husband loved it.

Good recipe. Added mushrooms-yum! Sauce was a bit thick, I added water to thin out. Will make again with chicken broth next time.

It's really delicious and easy as it can be, but I expected it to have more of a creamy consistency, as though it had cream cheese in it. Next time, I plan to add cream cheese and more garlic.

This is really good. I saute the onions in the butter before adding the other ingredients. This is great with Brown Sugar Meatloaf on this site and mashed potatos

I thought this was very good.  I used cream of mushroom soup, and I added a little sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  I also forgot to chop the onion, so I added a little onion salt.  Made it kind of salty, but I'll know for next time!  Thanks!

I thought it was just wonderful.  Instead of the Cream of Celery Soup I used Cream of Mushroom and omitted the flour. Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  Will make it again and often.  Thank you

This is a good quick way to make creamed spinach.  The longer it cooks, the thicker it gets.

I thought this was really good- of course, I couldn't resist the temptation to "doctor" it up a bit.  I added a couple of shakes of crushed red pepper, and about 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.  Wonderful!

i can't really rate this because i didn't make it as the recipe directs. i feel that this is a good start and like many others used this recipe as a base. i needed to use up some fresh spinach on hand so i started by sauteing [sp] minced garlic in olive oil and cooked down the fresh spinach. removed it to a bowl and it wasn't enough for the recipe so i added canned. heated olive oil again in the pan and added the flour [even amount with the oil] seasoned it with some salt and used the drained liquid from the spinach to make the thickening. i added about 4oz. of CREAM CHEESE to this until encorporated and then added the soup, blended and then mixed in the well drained spinach and put it in an oiled casserole dish to bake. i didn't use any onion.

Liked the recipe as written but will add cream or cream cheese next time.  Next time is Christmas and I'm going to put it in a crock pot after it's made in order to free up burners and keep it hot.

This recipe is AWESOME! I took it to Thanksgiving lunch and got many comments on it. I also sauted the onions before adding the remainder of the ingredients and I also added some extra flour to create more thickness. Very GOOD!

This dish was well received. I used Atkin's bake mix instead of flour to cut the carbs.  Thanks Holly.

Too soupy as the recipe is written.  I added 1 cup of bread crumbs, 2 beaten eggs and 3 T of flour.  This improved the texture in my mind (but it turns it into a different recipe, of course!),

I made this for my family at Thanksgiving, and I couldn't believe how easy it was. I had set aside tons of time to make this, but it was done before I knew it, and my family absolutely loved it. The soup gives it a nice smooth taste without crushing the taste of the spinach. Before I left, I caught my mother (who adamantly believes I can't cook) copying down the recipe!

I did not have frozen spinach, so I used the equivalent of three bags of fresh.  Once it was wilted down I added a can of cream of mushroom. Followed by a can of mushrooms which were diced to a medium chop. 1/3 cup of parmesan cheese and a single container of the garlic dipping sauce from Papa John's Pizza.  All of this was seasoned to taste, and stirred together in sauce pan till thoroughly heated & mixed. Then transferred into a baking dish. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes. At the 10 minute mark, I topped it with a cup of shredded mozzarella and finished baking. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.
Used the leftovers to top a baked potato sprinkled with bacon bits. Yummo!

This was good! After reading all of the suggestions I also used Cream of Mushroom instead of Cream of Celery. And I also added mushrooms as well. Turned out great!

I just found out that I am biabetic and I need to be on a low barb diet. So I went surching for new ways to cook and found this recipe. I did add some garlic salt to it but that was my only change. My entire family loved this, even my 16 year old daughter!

Must not be much of a spinach casserole fan. It was good but not amazing and didn't taste like Boston Market, in my opinion, at all.

Unfortunately, this recipe did not go over too well in my family.  We are HUGE spinach fans, but found this too soupy and just not to our taste.

Considering this is spinache, and I don't care for it much, this was really good!  I added finely chopped almonds just to add texture. Was a nice touch! :)

I made this to go with a chicken dish and it was great!  My husband and I both loved it.  If you're not a huge onion fan, you could add less onions, but it really is delicious and quick to make.

Used cream of bacon soup instead of celery soup. It was a hit.

Yep.. I loved this.  I always make the cheesy creamed spinach from this site but it's not near as healthy as this one.  This did not lack in flavor.  I will for sure be making this often.

I'm glad I read the reviews first before I made this.  This is a good starter recipe, but if you really want this to be tasty, you need to doctor it up whichever way you choose. My husband is a cheese lover, so I didn't use the flour; I added 2 tbl of minced garlic, garlic salt, pepper, about a half cup of sour cream, 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese, a sprinkle of Feta cheese, and I used a 1/2 cup of Chive and Onion flavored cream cheese because I was out of onion.  It turned out good!

Great side dish. I substituted the cream of celery soup with cream of mushroom because it's what I had on hand. I also used fresh minced garlic and fresh grated Parmesan cheese.

I used fresh spinach that I wilted in hot water first.  I cooked a large red onion in 1 tsp olive oil with minced garlic, then added the spinach, soup, and butter.  I omitted the flour and used broccoli cheese soup instead of celery.  Mine was not too soupy, but I think that's because I used such a large onion.  I also added a quarter cup of bread crumbs when it was done.  This was good, but I think it would be better cooked in the oven than on the stove top.

I found this to be too salty as written, next time I will use garlic powder or minced garlic instead of garlic salt.

We love spinach at our house, but this dish we unfortunately didn't care for. Can't quite figure out what the problem was, it just didn't have a really good flavor. Still, thanks for sharing the recipe, we love trying new things.

I hate spinach so I didnt try this, but everyone who did have it said it was great! It took me only 5 minutes to throw together and they said it tasted just like Boston Market's.

This is great!  I halved the recipe but used the entire can of celery soup.  I also added parmesan cheese.  It was wonderful.  Next time I'll make the full recipe!
