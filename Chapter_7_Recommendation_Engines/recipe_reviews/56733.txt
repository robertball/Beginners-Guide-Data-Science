My review is only for the dumplings and not the cheesy casserole. I had leftover mashed potatoes to use up and needed a recipe for dumplings. The recipe was pretty easy to follow and the baggie definitely helped with the forming process. I kept the cooked dumplings in the fridge and just took out a single serving when I wanted to use them. I pan-fried them in a little oil until they were crispy on the outside and then served with kielbasa and sauerkraut. Very tasty! I would definitely do this again if I had leftover mashed potatoes on hand. Might try the cheesy casserole next time too.

This recipe just didn't come out very well.  Not sure if it was me or the recipe.  The sauce was grainy and tasted unpleasant and the dumplings were gloppy.  Maybe one day in the distant future if I'm feeling brave I will try this again.

I made this for a post-Thanksgiving leftover party and people ate it in about five seconds. A huge, decadent hit. I made it with leftover garlic mashed potatoes.

This was more time consuming than I anticipated, but I did not have leftover mashed potatoes to use which would have helped considerably with the time. It is delicious though and looks good too. Think potato dumpling married with scallop potato flavors and sauce.

This was ok.  A lot of work and didn't have a very distinctive taste.  I won't be spending my time making this again.

Perfect potato dumplings. I made only those and then used a pesto sauce to create my Italian favorite. YUMMY!
