I thought it was super easy and super simple. I made some changes but only because I had to.  I used angel hair pasta because it was all I had and wanted to use up shrimp I had on hand. I also didn't have parsley but did have fresh basil so I added that. Otherwise made it exactly as recipe said and it was delicious.  Topped with some parmesan since I didn't use ravioli with cheese. 

Will definitely use this recipe again.

This is amazing.  I used a homemade Alfredo sauce instead of pre-made, and that is fantastic!  I love the lemon flavor, I did add just a little more of it as I love lemon.  I caution you not to cheap out on the ravioli that you use, because I can see that making this dish with cheap ravioli could take this recipe down a lot.

pretty yummy... lemon flavor was a little heavy for our taste. will reduce lemon juice and bit next time. Other than that it was a nice dinner option.
