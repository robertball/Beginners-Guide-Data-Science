I made these as an appetizer for son's birthday party, and they were a big hit.  They were even good without any kind of suace.  Thanks!

I enjoyed this. I had to use red onion, so it had a bit more bite than I it might normally, but overall the flavor was good with some plain rice. I blended it all in the food processor on high and the corn stayed chunky. (Also, didn't have the peas on hand.)

We really liked these.  We skipped the shrimp but did add the sliced red chile peppers and also just a tsp or two of freshly grated ginger.  Awesome.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

These are wonderful!  I used 1 lb of shrimp and less hot peppers. I also only used whole wheat flour.
