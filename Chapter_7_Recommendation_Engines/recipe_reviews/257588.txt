Such a great shortcut to this comfort food classic. I used frozen pearl onions and that cut down on prep time.

For the wine, I used a syrah from Washington state, and it tasted great!!

Because I didn't have potato starch, I subbed cornstarch and it worked just fine.

I will definitely make this dish again!!

I know this goes against the "quick" part, but I made this  in the crock-pot. Great recipe. Very tasty. I had time to kill.

My husband loved it! 
I used boned and  skinned thighs and breasts.
I made mashed potatoes and had buttered French bread on the side. 
I also used a full bottle of French Grenache (less the glass I drank while cooking) and added 1/4 cup of Cognac for richer flavor. 
I added frozen carrots at the end.
Only part that was time consuming was the pearl onion prep. My local grocery stores do not carry frozen any more.
This was truely delicious and I will definitely make it again.
