Butter flavor Crisco shortening works great in this recipe. If you want a healthier cookie with more flavor, use half brown sugar and half white sugar, half whole wheat flour and half white flour, decreasing the shortening to 3/4 cup. For a spicier cookie that tastes more like pumpkin pie, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, and 1/4 tsp ginger (or just use 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice).  Cream cheese frosting goes very nicely with these cookies, per suggestions from prior reviews.  Thank you for a great eggless cookie recipe!!!

Thanks for a great recipe!  My daughter is allergic to eggs and she loves this treat.  I made it with half brown sugar and half white sugar for a chewier cookie, and also subsituted half of the recommended amount of shortening with margarine.  They tasted great!!  I left out the chocolate chips for half the batch and they were still delicious!!

I had no eggs in the house and wanted to make pumpkin cookies to send in my college daughter's Halloween care package so finding this recipe was serendipity! I made a few changes: I halved the recipe and substituted margarine for the shortening. I also added a half cup of toasted chopped walnuts and a half teasp. of nutmeg and a pinch of allspice. I chilled the batter while I cleaned the kitchen and then rolled the batter into balls. I rolled the balls in granulated sugar and then flattened them with a fork. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us Arlene!

Everyone that tried them loved these cookies. I also used pumpkin pie filling instead of the puree, half the cinnamon, 1c. white sugar, and 1c. brown sugar. It was also easier the second time around because I creamed the sugars and shortening first, then added the pumpkin a little bit at a time. Otherwise it was hard to mix and the pumpkin was so wet that it splashed a lot. It is a very fast and easy cookie to make from scratch. The first time I used chocolate chips, the second time I dressed it up for the holidays by dipping the tops in white chocolate and sprinkling with green edible glitter. They were very attractive and you get a bit of chocolate in each bite.

I love this recipe. I made some without chocolate chips and many with. I liked both however I added to teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and less flour. I used 3 1/2 cups of floor instead of four because someone said they were a little floury. Let me tell you less flour really worked. Also I didn't have any shortening so I used butter instead. Well guess I changed alot but in the end they turned out great anyways.

For an egg free cookie this works great with coffee.  It's kinda like pumpkin bread, but easier.  The chocolate chips add a nice sweetness to the cookie.  My toddler is allergic to eggs and picky to boot, but he LOVED these!  He always wants "two more cookies".  Make sure that you store them in an air tight container/cookie jar, as they will harden within a few hours.  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

Woooo Hoooo, This is great! I was craving cookies today and when I started the basic base recipe for cookies, I then noticed I had no eggs, ugh!! Then I looked for a cookie recipe that did not require eggs, and BAM~~ Here it is, and just let me say these are very yummy, I did like others, by adding some extra, ginger, allspice,cinnamon and fresh nutmeg, I also just used some county crock spread instead of shortning. I also used a sugar coated fork to gently press down on the cookies. (also I did two batches with chopped walnuts on top, mmmmm good) They came out so good, I can't wait for my kids to get home from school for this tasty snack. I will so make this again and again... ;)

This is a fantastic recipe!  My oldest daughter has multiple food allergies (egg included).  I had been looking for a pumpkin chocolate chip cookie recipe, as my mother had lost hers (which had egg in it, of course).  When I found this recipe, I was very excited!  I did make a change to the recipe - used 1/2 c milk-free margarine and 1/2 c shortening.  I also used part cinnamon and part pumpkin pie spice to jazz them up!  The recipe made a ton of cookies! They were very soft (which was fine with us!)  And, they froze very well!  Both my kids (4 and 1) really liked these cookies, too!

I didn't care for these. I think they would be much better without the cinnamon. They would also be good with the cinnamon but without the chocolate chips. It's the combination of the two together that I didn't like.

I've been making these cookies for years, and they're always a hit! The first time I made them, I followed the recipe exactly and they were great. Now, I use all real butter instead of the shortening and they are AWESOME!! Today, I'm portioning out the dough into a bowl and adding different things. Mini choc chips, dried cherries, I may try some nuts. They're always moist and satisfying. For those getting a "dry, floury" cookie, don't cut down on your flour. Just bake them for less time! They really don't take very long at all.

Fabulous cookies!  I didn't change anything but add a tsp of salt.  I did however back off the oven to 350F and baked for only 12 min ads I do not like overbrown bottoms or dry cookies.  These are the best cookies I've ever tried on Allrecipes.  Thanks Arlene from me and my grandson who is allergic to eggs.

Thanks for the recipe.  My daughter is allergy to egg and wheat.  So I use 2 cup rice flour, 1 cup soy flour, 1 cup tapioca flor and 2 teaspoon xanthan gum istead of 4 cup all purpose flour.  And I use brown sugar instead of white sugar, and the cookie turn out great.

I was looking for some type of dessert/treat recipe that didn't call for eggs(as I was out of eggs) and called for pumpkin puree...this was perfect! My 2 year old son helped me make them and he was so proud to eat them once they were done! They were very good, but more on the cakey, fluffy side, which is perfect for people who love that(like my husband) but I prefer the more dense, chewy kind. But overall they were a hit and easy to make!

These were easy to make but were a little bland for me. The chocolate chips are the main flavoring. I also pressed each dough round down since they dont spread.

Everyone who tried them LOVED them and I had so many compliments.  My changes were:  
1. Used Butter (some melted and some really soft as I forgot to let it sit our for awhile to get room temp) instead of shortening
2. 2 cups fresh pumpkin puree instead of 15 oz of can pumpkin
3.  My flour was unbleached all purpose flour if it matters
4. 350 degrees not 375 (1st batch mis were all burnt on the bottom so I tried the lower temp which worked)
5. baked smaller cookies for 12 mins and let the bigger one stay in while I put smaller cookies on cooling rack so the bigger ones were in 13-14 mins
6. I used my silicone mats on my metal pans.

Great recipe. 
I didn't have plain flour so I used bread flour and added 1/2 cup of water. 
I used a small scoop and the recipe made over 100 small cookies. (and I forgot to add the choc chips.)

Everybody loved them.  Tender, not too sweet, stay puffed up, makes a lot!  Doubling the recipe for a 29 oz can of pumpkin takes a big bowl to mix!

This is a good recipe. I love pumpkin and the ease of this recipe w/out the eggs is great. They hold their form really nicely and are a great snack with a cup of coffee or a glass of milk for the kiddos. I just made these for the first time and took the advice of others and added cloves, allspice, ginger...very good. I also used 3/4 C of butter and 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar. 
It is a great base to tweak here and there and it is a lovely moist fragrant delicious cookie! Thanks.

i just made these for a thanksgiving get-together, and they disappeared very quickly.  i made them without the chocolate chips, however, and did half white sugar and half brown sugar.  they didn't spread at all though, so i squished the dough balls for the later ones.  they are very soft and chewy (although i didn't cook them too long because i love gooey squishy cookies and hate crunchy ones).  i might use a bit less flour next time though... the batter was very thick, but then again, everyone loved them and wanted more.

I love this recipe. I've made it a few times now, twice with the original recipe (which is very good) and twice with a few changes - I replaced 1/2 cup flour with 1 cup oats, the chocolate chips with raisins and added some 2 tsp ginger and 1 tsp cloves. yum yum yum!

This recipe is great. I will have to admit that I changed it up a bit. I was originally making the Toll House chocolate chip cookies when I realized I was out of eggs. I searched and found this recipe. Thus, I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 tsp salt, and 1 cup softened margarine. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as given. They turned out great and even my picky eaters liked them!!! Thanks for the egg free recipe!!!

I consider myself a chocolate-chip cookie expert and, in my not-so-humble opinion, these cookies are FANTASTIC.  If you want to be extra healthy, you can substitute oat bran for up to 1/3 of the flour and use olive oil for the shortening.

This recipe it fool-proof. The cookies are actually little bit-sized cakes and are so delicious.  Try them with dried cranberries and walnuts instead of chocolate for a holiday touch.  I also added cream cheese icing after they cooled and they are scrumptious!

This is more like a free-form muffin or coffee cake than a cookie. It was also a little bit bland, and I did not care for the chocolate pumpkin combination. It could use a kick of spices (likes cloves and ginger), and maybe some dried fruit like raisins, cranberries or tart cherries instead. On the plus side, it was easy to make, and it made a lot. Not bad, but not what I was expecting or looking for, and I doubt I'll be making them again.

Good all-around egg-free recipe!  My son's allergic and he (we) gobbled these up.  They came out kind of dry, so I may add a little glaze or frosting next time.  Would definately make again!Thanks for the recipe!

I had some leftover pumpkin, I had no eggs and I wanted something sweet for me and my husband. These were PERFECT! I cut the recipe in half because having all those cookies around could be dangerous. :) I used butter instead of shortening. I used about 12 oz. of canned pumpkin. And I used about 3 oz. each of white chocolate chips and semisweet chocolate ships. SO SO GOOD! These cookies are moist, soft and chewy. I would love to make these again! Thank you, Arlene!

The texture is very good and it's very easy to make, but I found it very bland and far too sweet. I think brown sugar pairs with pumpkin better than white flour, and it definitely needed more spices. I think it could use more butter as well. I wouldn't make this again.

These are really good. I did make a couple of slight changes - I used half whole wheat flour. I added 1/2tsp clove & nutmeg too which went really good with the other flavors.  I dipped these in a warm frosting which gave them a nice light coating - everyone loved them!

So Wonderful! Easy and not as sticky as with eggs, plus great when you have to bake cookie for a public school class. No eggs, no peanut butter, or dairy.  The only thing you have to worry about is a cinnomon allegy. Plus if you add 2 ounces of carrot juice more nutition and you kids and husband are none the wiser! Just cook them an extra 1 1/2-2 mins if you add the carrot juice.

I followed directions until it came to the spices and baking: used cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Rolled dough into small balls and rolled that in a mixture of cinnamon sugar. Baked for eight minutes and let cool on sheet for one minute before removing. Also added in some dried cranberries! Even with changes this is just not a sweet cookie, may have to frost because of blandness. It is chewy tho but did not seem very flavorful, more spices

These are kind of addictive. :) I used fresh cooked pumpkin, ww pastry flour, earth balance margerine, and vegan chocolate chips to veganize them. While one person in my office (who favors McDonalds) said they tasted "too healthy" everyone else seemed to gobble them up. I'm going to try them again sans chips -perhaps with the spice recommendations of other reviewers. These are a great fall cookie!

These are some of the best cookies I have ever made, egg-free or otherwise!!!  I used a cup of butter instead of shortening, used mini chocolate chips and added nutmeg as well (I love nutmeg). They turned out soft and puffy perfect and way to easy to eat many at a time.   Several requests have come in to make these often!!

These cookies are so tasty and helpful when you run out of eggs.  I subsitituted brown sugar for a cup of the white and ginger for some of the cinnamon.  They also work very well with whole wheat flour or half-white, half-whole wheat.

I made these for a friend of mine who is allergic to eggs and the leftovers from that batch were so popular, I ended up making 5 more the next day to share with my family and friends.  They're easy to make and so moist and delicious - they instantly became a new tradition in my family.

Spectacular! These cookies really grow on you, vegan or not; seriously, these are addictive. Excellent, moist texture. I suggest using Ghiradeli semisweet chocolate chips for a vegan-safe cookie (some lower-quality brands will have milk products in their semisweet; you must check the back of the label.) I also use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon for a perfect flavor. Everyone should try this recipe out at least once; these cookies are good year round.

This is an excellent recipe for vegans (especially college vegans) because it uses simple, inexpensive, and easy-to-find ingredients (no tofu, arrowroot, agar powder!). It also makes great-tasting cookies! (I went ahead and used pumpkin pie spice as another reviewer recommended.)
As a fan of pecans in my chocolate chip cookies and walnuts in my pumpkin bread, I added walnuts to some of the cookies and thought the result was wonderful.

As is, I'd give it 4 stars, since pumpkin + chocolate is not my thing. But I added cranberries and walnuts, and it was amazing. After baking, I tossed them in powdered sugar. I took them to a work party, and got rave reviews. 

Also yummy if you sub out half the butter for applesauce (bake a minute or two longer)

I was initially very skeptical of this recipe, but after I made it, I was definitely proven wrong.  I needed to find an egg and peanut free recipe that all the children in our pre-school group could eat b/c I get tired of 2 or 3 kids always being left out.  This recipe was a hit with ALL of the kids with exception to 1 (total 28 kids!).
I did make a few changes:
I used butter instead of shortening, added 1 tsp salt, added 1 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp ginger and nutmeg, used 3 1/2 C flour instead of 4 and they turned out amazing.  I will definitely be adding these to my cookie recipe rotation, especially during our fall season!

great recipe! Really happy with how they came out. I used pumpkin pie spice rather than cinnamon which turned out great. I also rolled them into balls and gently pressed them with a fork and they look nice too. Oh and BTW I used whole wheat flour too and they still came out great.

I used 3/4 cup of shortening and 1/4 cup of butter for extra flavor, and the cookies were still missing something.  Because I didn't want a cinnamon cookie, I omitted that all together, but that may have been what was missing.  I'm using some of the dough, sans chocolate chips, to make some more cookies but with raisins.  I hope I like them more!

I substituted unsalted butter for the shortening, and 1 cup of Craisins plus 1 cup chopped walnuts for the chocolate chips. I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup of confectioner's sugar and added 1/2 tsp. ground cloves. Dropped by rounded tablespoons onto Pam-sprayed sheet and baked per instructions; they came out like mini-scones, subtle and satisfying!

I don't know what went wrong.  But, I could not really taste the pumpkin.  I thought the chocolate and the pumpkin were not on the same wavelength.  In my opinion, it needed some kind of glaze or something on top.  I definitely won't be making this ever again! (I was forced to select at least 1 star in order to post.  Otherwise, it would have gotten none.)

This recipe fits the bill since I am always looking for no milk/egg/nut recipes for my grandson who is allergic. These cookies are definitely soft and cakelike, but delish. I modified the recipe by using 2/3 cup of canola oil instead of shortening, 1/2 cup of raisins, no chocolate chips, and drizzled with powdered sugar frosting made with orange juice instead of milk. Very good and even healthy with all the pumpkin!

My cookies came out great and everyone loved them! They were very cake like. Burned the bottoms of them on the first batch cause I didnt flatten the dough before baking. I loved not having to use eggs.

I didn't have any shortening on hand and replaced with 2/3c veg. oil. Also didn't have chocolate chips. Was looking for a pumpkin cookie that didn't call for eggs and found this one.  I think next time I will add more sugar or make a powdered sugar icing...these are good and am sure they will taste good with coffee in the morning, but don't really satisfy the sweet tooth!  Was hesitant to use veg. oil, but they baked up perfectly!!

I was very pleased with this recipe. My son has an egg allergy and was a home run for my little one. I did use 50/50 white sugar and brown sugar. I went with Toll House white chocolate chips and took the advice from another reviewer to flatten the cookie down with a fork before baking. I dipped a fork in the white sugar first to flatten. This recipe yields a good amount of cookies too. I am going to make another batch but this time we are going to place a hershey kiss or peanut butter cup.  A true hit - thank you.

If you like pumpkin flavored things then this is for you. My son and I thought they were yuuummy! We did change it a tad: did half recipe, used pumpkin pie filling, did half brown sugar and half white sugar, reduced flour to a cup and a half since we did half recipe and we were supposed to use 2 cups, used a dash of cinnamon since there were spices in the filling. We liked it a lot!

After reading some viewer comments, I decided to use 1 cup white sugar and one cup brown sugar, plus I added half a tsp of nutmeg and one fourth of a tsp of allspice, but it still could have had more flavor. Overall, it is a nice cookie; the texture is more like a cake though. It helps to wet your hands with cold water and roll the dough into balls and flatten them out a bit, because they rise in the oven, but do not expand much. This recipe makes way more than (48) 1 tsp cookies. I would make them again; they will be good with coffee.

I have never made pumpkin cookies before, but these are excellent.  I did use half applesauce and half margarine for the shortening and used mostly wheat flour, but I doubt this made a huge difference.  Very tasty- will make again!

These cookies turned out a little bland for me. I should have used the butter flavored Crisco. I added the half brown sugar and half white sugar. I also added some cut up caramels to the batter. That gave it a bit more sweetness. I'd make these again, but with butter flavored Crisco.

I THOUGHT THEY WERE EXCELLENT.  THERE AREN'T MANY RECIPES THAT SUIT MY LIFESTYLE AS I TRY TO BE AS VEGAN AS I CAN BE.  I USED SEMI-SWEET CHOLCOLATE CHIPS THAT DID NOT CONTAIN DAIRY INGREDIENTS.  I RECEIVED MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THEM AND HAVE MANY PEOPLE ASKING FOR THE RECIPE.  I MAY TRY 1/2 WHITE 1/2 BROWN SUGAR NEXT TIME AND MAY ADD A LITTLE NUTMEG.  YES, YOU DEFINITELY DO HAVE TO PRESS THE COOKIES DOWN A LITTLE BEFORE BAKING AS THEY DO NOT SPREAD OUT ON THEIR OWN BUT THEY ARE DELICIOUS!!!!

These were great cookies and considering the egg allergy in the family, it was perfect!  I took the recommendation of several members and added more spice (1/4 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp. allspice, 1/4 tsp. nutmet) and it made them very flavorful.  I did reduce the flour by 1/2 a cup because I really didn't want cookies that stood too high.

I got a bit creative with this and made a bunch of substitutions, some based on other reviewers suggestions.

1 cup Brown sugar
1 cup White Sugar
1/2 cup Shortening
1/2 cup Butter
15 ounces Pumpkin puree
2 teaspoons Vanilla
2 cups All-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups Whole-wheat flour
2 teaspoons Baking soda
1 teaspoon Cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon Nutmeg
1/4 teaspoon Ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon Ginger ground
14 ounces Chocolate chips

I baked these for 15 minutes on a silicon baking sheet and they were a bit under-done so I'll probably bake them for 18 minutes next time. Although the wheat flour substitution made the cookies taste more flour-y and less sweet, they tasted much better the next morning and my coworkers loooved them.

This cookie was just okay.  Like others said they did not spread, and mine came out very high (used an ice cream scooper) and cake-like.  I made some changes, like using whole wheat and white flour mixed, as well as white and brown sugars.  I added a few dashes of nutmeg and allspice and added two handfuls of raisins.  Maybe next time I would even add some oatmeal to give it a bit of texture.  (Quite possibily next time I just might try another recipe instead.)  Someone else recommended blending the sugars and shortening before adding in the pumpkin, which was good advice.

these may very well be great in the eggless arena, but I have little experience with eggless cookies, and I was disappointed.  I would have added some allspice or something as these were a bit bland in my opinion

My sons really enjoyed these cookies.  We made these for one of their friends, who is allergic to eggs and nuts, and they have been disappearing steadily ever since!  I used a mix of chocolate and butterscotch chips (check the labels to make sure they don't contain traces of nuts, if that's an issue), and a can of pumpkin pie filling instead of the puree (cutting back the cinnamon).  I also used 1 c of white and 1 cup of brown sugar.  Makes a chewier, flavorful cookie.

This was a good recipe for my son and me to make.  he is allergic to eggs, so a chewy or cake-like cookie is hard to find. These tasted good, though I used 1c. white sugar and 1c. brown sugar.  all-in-all a very good recipe.

Thank you for sharing. My little girl has a Brownie (Girl Guides of Canada) friend and she has an egg alergy. Not only were these cookies okay for her to eat but after tasting one she took three more and still came back for more. My family and I really enjoyed these as well. I'll make these again for sure. Cheers!!

I had to add another review.  Over the Thanksgiving day weekend, I made this recipe about two more times.  Everyone loved it, the cookies were finished before the night was over and I had to make copies of the recipe as well.  I will say that you have had a very satisfied customer.

Updated 12/18/18:
These remain the one cookie my family requests every holiday. However, they are even better if you use 1 1/2 cans of pumpkin (about 22oz) instead of just 15. We prefer mini chocolate chips for better even distribution of chips. I also have better luck with even doneness when I bake at 350 for 15 minutes instead of the stated 375.

Original review:
I took a double batch of these cookies to a halloween party a few days ago.  Everyone just raved about the taste.  I got request after request for the recipe.  When we left the party there was less than a dozen for us to bring home, and those were gone before the day was over!

It's really good, it tastes only like a chocolate chip cookie not pumpkin cookie. The baking and timing was perfect and cooked well.

These are pretty good! I didn’t have pumpkin so I used canned yams. And I  omitted cinnamon and used 50/50 chocolate chips and cinnamon chips.

Great recipe. I used soy butter (dairy allergy) and omitted the cinnamon as others suggested. I also went with half white sugar and half brown.

I made these and took to a dinner gathering and all who tried them really raved about them.  I wanted to add raisins as I was making them, but decided not to deviate.  Next time, I will be more creative - as I gained lots of good ideas from reading other reviews.  :)

Awesome cookies! I did change the cinnamon to pumpkin pie spice as suggested by another review.  Got rave reviews and request for more from my husbands coworkers! Will be making this again soon.

Per the other reviews I made quite a few changes to the recipe. I used butter instead of shortening, subbed half the white sugar for brown sugar, added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and omitted the chocolate chips. I used a 2 tablespoon cookie scoop and was able to make 48 cookies easily. 15 minutes in a 350 degree oven was perfect. When I tried them, they were good, but needed some more sweetness so I put a powdered sugar glaze on them with vanilla and pumpkin pie spice. They taste like a glazed pumpkin doughnut! Next time I'll try them with the chocolate chips and maybe some toasted pecans.

I halved the recipe but thought it was too sweet. I will decrease the sugar next time. Also felt that the shortening didn't give it enough depth. I will use margarine next time.

I wanted iced pumpkin cookies so took out the chocolate chips and changed the cinnamon to pumpkin spice. I also made a glaze with milk, icing sugar and a little pumpkin spice. My family loves them, both plain and with the icing. Definitely a repeat recipe.

I loved the fact that these cookies were so soft and fluffy. However I did do one thing different: I split the batter before adding in the chocolate chips and used raisins in half and chocolate chips in the other. Both were wonderful! Thank you for sharing your recipe.

These were awesome for someone who likes to sometimes sneak some cookie dough while baking. Instead of the 2 teaspoons of baking soda, maybe 1 or 1.5 would work better, there was a presence of that taste lingering in the cookies. I used butter instead of Crisco, and excluded and spices, doubled vanilla. The dough tastes funny, but the final cookie product was pretty darn awesome!

My family loves this recipe! My daughter is allergic to eggs and finding a soft, egg-free cookie recipe has been relatively difficult. These are perfect, though! I use half white sugar and half brown sugar and mini chocolate chips (I prefer the texture of mini chocolate chips in a soft cookie over larger, hard chocolate chunks). I also substitute whole wheat flour for all purpose flour and the cookies still come out soft and light. I like the flavor of butter flavor shortening better, too, but that is a personal preference.

I got hooked onto these cookies several years ago when my roommate made them. I have since taken over the pleasure of making them. The only thing I'm going to try next time is using butter instead of crisco to see if they still turn out just as tasty.

Subbed a lot of things as the baking supplies were getting low... Used about 3/4 cup sugar and made up the rest with maple syrup (1:1 sub); used mostly coconut oil mixed with palm oil (less than 1/2 palm); upped the pumpkin to a full pound by weight; and chopped up some chocolate pumpkin seed bark to mix with the chocolate chips. They are puffy cake-like cookies (I imagine if you'd like them chewier, reduce the baking soda by half and take out a few TBS of flour), but they smell great and my allergy child wholeheartedly approves!

I like this recipe. Its a bit like bread or a muffin. I substituted vegetable oil spread and only had to use 1/2 cup of that and it worked. I like how fluffy they are because I am giving to my kids one who is only 1 years old. I also used chopped up craisins instead of chocolate chips. They compliment the pumpkin flavor.

MY firstborn has egg allergies so we have tried several egg free recipes, this is by far the best we've made. I have used it to make pumpkin bread too, though it is a little dense for mose peoples liking...he loves it!! I have made this recipe now several times and the only thing that I add is nutmeg and a dash or ginger to give it a little more flavor.

We really liked these cookies.  Based upon the other reviews I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar, 2 tsp of pumpkin spice instead of cinnamon, 1/2 cup of non-dairy margarine and 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening.  I rolled the dough in small balls and rolled in sugar.  I liked the crunchy outside and soft inside.  The only problem was my son ended up being allergic to the butter flavored shortening so next time I will either use regular shortening or all the non-dairy margarine.  Will keep in my dessert folder.

I made these for my son who has multiple food allergies.  The cookies were great after I made some modifications.  I used soy butter instead of the Crisco, used brown sugar and regular sugar, and added salt.  I also made sure to shape the cookies as someone suggeted and smoosh them down with a fork coated with sugar.  Will definately make them again.

I gave this a 4 because although they weren't great (probably as a result of the ingredients I used which were different from what's in the recipe), this recipe definitely makes a healthy, satisfyingly filling and tasty cookie.  I used gluten-free flour, Smart Balance in place of butter, and Splenda in place of sugar, plus I added some nutmeg,and some additional vanilla. Made 12 cookies, and only used 1/4 can pumpkin puree. You definitely have to watch these so that they don't burn. Next time I make these I will add more spices and in higher amounts because the recipe if followed exactly makes a bland cookie, and I may add ground nuts for texture. The best thing about these, at least the way I made them, is that they are gluten and egg free, low in saturated fats and sugars, and thus I didn't have to feel guilty about eating something that's not too good for me.

I needed another batch of cookies for an event and had a half can of pumpkin to use up so decided to try this recipe cut in half.  They did not flatten as shown in the photo but I liked the cakey texture.  I was concerned about so many reviews saying they were bland, so I added 1/2 t. salt and the chocolate chips.  Glad I did as I think they would be nothing special without the chocolate or a lot of extra spices.

My niece and I wanted to make some kind of dessert, but we had no butter in the house. So we made these with the left over pumpkin puree we used for our pumpkin juice. They were a big hit! They're delicious. I know we'll be making these often!

Wonderful cookies!  I found that making them smaller made them better :)  I may add some nutmeg next time around, though!  These are perfect egg and dairy free pumpkin cookies!!!

Our 16 month old boys love these cookies.  They are wonderful for those with egg allergy.  My husband and I thought they were somewhat bland but since the boys like them so much I gave it five stars.  This recipe makes a large batch...cookies freeze well.  Thanks for an egg free cookie recipe.

These were delicious. Everyone I gave them to liked them and no one could guess that they were egg- and dairy-free! (I would say that with a usual-sized scoop, the recipe makes more like 6 dozen; it's easily halved if that's too many.)

Very moist cookie.  I did as others suggested and mixed the sugars.  I also used pumpkin pie spices instead of cinnamon.  The kids loved them frosted with sprinkles and in pumpkin shapes.  Will keep the recipe.

Actually really good for an eggless cookie.  It's more cakelike than other cookies, but pretty tasty.  Good alternative if you are out of eggs, like I was, and still want to make cookies.  It makes a lot though, next time I would half the recipe.

Thanks for the eggless recipe. These were a bit muffiny for me though.

My son is allergic to milk and egg.  My entire family loved these cookies.  I couldn't keep my son out of the bag.  The only thing I used differently was the pumpkin pie filling with all the spices in it and milk-free semi sweet chocolate chips.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I thought it was dry and floury, but my friends thought it was wonderful. Tiny little cookie-cakes that take up quite some time to prepare and bake; they go in and out of the oven in practically the same shape. I also used 1 cup of brown sugar w/ 1 cup of white to give it more flavour. A bit doughy.

This is the first cookie recipe I've tried which doesn't use eggs.  Just found out my son is allergic.  All I had were 1/2 bag of mini M&Ms and 1/2 bag butterscotch morsels.  I threw these in then noticed the color "melted" off of the M&Ms.  Next time I will use all Butterscotch --- they were yummy with the pumpkin.  I may leave out the cinnamon too.

I made these cookies in time for Thanksgiving, and they were a hit.  I used pumpkin pie filling, instead of the puree - it gave the cookies more flavour.  I also agree with some of the other reviews that they are more cake-like, but I still liked them and will make them again.
