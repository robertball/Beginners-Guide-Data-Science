So delicious. Like one of the other reviewerâ€˜s I added 10 ounces of broccoli instead of the 3 ounces. I also added a couple of tablespoons of nutritional yeast and it tasted just like cream of broccoli soup with cheese.

The recipe was a little bland. Added a couple really small cloves of garlic, a sprinkling of red pepper flakes, a bay leaf, and a little nutritional yeast for some umami per the recommendation of another reviewer. Held back on adding any salt until the soup was done. I thought it was still a little bland, but the husband added croutons and thought it was pretty good. If we try again, since it doesn't use the whole head of romesco, will roast some florettes in the oven to garnish the final soup with the beautiful romesco and a little flavored olive oil with croutons.

This is delicious! The only thing is the romanesco was not enough for me, 3.5 oz is a small amount. It was so watery so I used almost the whole head of romanesco and it turned out great!
