I've always loved the zuppa toscana soup at the Olive Garden, this was similar but this was better.  I used ground sausage which made it even easier, and it turned out wonderful. The whole family loved it even my 3 yr old.  This is definetly one of my favorites!!

I changed it a little, but only to make it easier.  It tasted the same.
I used 1 (32 oz) box of chicken broth, and I used 1 bag of little potatoes cut in half.
My 6 kids, ages 7,11,16,18,21, and 23 ALL  loved it and my husband told me it was the best soup he's had in his life.  This is the same husband who loves my corn chowder, my split pea soup with ham, and my ham and cheddar cheese soup.  My own soups are all good and usually get me compliments and requests for my recipes, but I must admit this soup is better than any of mine.

I really enjoyed this soup. It takes almost like Olive Garden's zuppa toscana soup. I decided to use 3 cans of chicken broth and used about a cup of heavy cream.  I also added more potatoes & it was great.  I thought the soup had a really good flavor.  Nothing lacking for me!!!

My girlfriend was visiting for the weekend and made this soup for the two of us.  We visited the local Italian deli which set us up with some great sausage and pancetta bacon.  I can't judge how easy or hard the soup was to make, but our only regret was that we hadn't made a double batch.

A tasty treat!

I didn't change a thing about this recipe! It was wonderful. I think you really have to use Kale because it hold up well in the heat. Perfect recipe

This is good - I really loved the kale in it. I used regular bacon because thats what I had. I found the soup a bit bland and not as thick as I would have liked. Added lots of salt and pepper, some fresh parsley, red pepper, and basil. Next time, I'll try pureeing half of the soup while it's at the potato stage to thicken it. My husbad and sons loved it, so it looks like there will be a next time. Thanks!

I really love the Olive Garden version of this soup, and I have to agree with the reviewers who said that this version lacks something. I added extra potatoes and then added some basil and black pepper to kick it up, but it still needs something more. I used regular Italian sausage, and using hot/spicy sausage might do the trick, so I'll try that next time. It's a great recipe to start with though and is very satisfying.

This is a lot like zuppa tuscana soup, but a little more bland.  I added some crushed red pepper, and some hot Italian sausage.  The pancetta had a nice flavor, but I like more bacon in the soup.  Good, but I'll stick with the other version.  Thanks for sharing your version Holly. ;)

This was really bland if you follow the recipe exactly.  I had to try this recipe a 2nd time to see if I could get closer Olive Garden's version.  Second time around was MUCH better but that was because I doubled the quantity of onion and at least tripled the garlic.

Loved this recipe! Made it for dinner and it was a hit with the eitire family. Will definately be making again. I did add some extra garlic though. We are garlic nuts and this just didn't have enough for me. I also added a few red pepper flakes to give it a little kick. Excellent soup for a cold January evening.

Just make sure to add about 12 extra ounces of chicken broth and about 1/4 cup more cream - it is delicious!

Great!  Will be eating this again.  Did not have bacon on hand and used smoked ham and cut it into small pieces and browned it on the stove.  Also used Italian ground sausage and let it simmer in the stock before putting the potatoes in.  Doubled the potatoes as well, and used a cup or more of half and half.  YUM, YUM, YUM!  My husband could not stop eating, nor I.  Thanks for a great recipe.  Kale is the added bonus in this soup.

I did make some changes to make this a healthier dish (personal preference) Used Turkey Italian sausage, turkey bacon, skim milk w/ flour/margarine roux to thicken - also used frozen spinage as that's what I had on hand. Rest the same... Beautiful and delicious dish!!

This is the best soup! I made it with chicken broth instead of water and bullion, and I used a little extrA cream. I also used hot Italian sausage. This recipe is way better than any soup you'll get at the olive garden. this soup is so rich, thick, and creamy!

This is by far one of the best soups I have ever made!  I followed the recipe with 2 minor exceptions.  For the italian sausage I used Johnsonville Sweet Italian sausage and homemade chicken stock.  I found this soup full of flavor and wouldn't change anything.  I like to use the sweet italian sausage because of the basil in it.

Awesome recipe. My boyfriend couldn't stop eating it. It really is just as good as (if not better than) the version at Olive Garden. We also put cheese on top of our soup. We will definitely make this again!

Very good soup. I subbed bacon for the pancetta (and more then was called) and spinach for the kale. I loved it. Topped it with parm cheese. My kids thought it was just ok. Husband enjoyed it.

Delicious recipe!!! Good for warming the soul on a cold fall day!  Was also excellent taking left overs the following day for lunch.  Warms up nicely in microwave.  The next time we make it i will probably take the italian sausage out of the skin and brown it instead of baking it in the oven.  Over all delicious.

This stoup was fantastic.  Yes, I said stoup, because I decided I wanted a very hearty lunch, so I added one bunch of kale and one bunch of regular swiss chard.  I also browned the sausage in my soup pot until almost done, added the onions and bacon and cooked them down to very brown with stuff sticking onto the bottom of the pan.

Once nicely browned, I added the chicken stock, but increased it to 8 cups to compensate for the extra kale.  I added the potatoes and cooked uncovered until almost cooked soft.  Add the kale & swiss chard and cook for 5-10 minutes, depending on your preference.  

My husband said this was the best soup I've ever cooked.  And gluten friendly (not including the cream as most celiacs can't have dairy).

This soup is amazing!  The only thing I did different was use regular bacon, because I didn't have pancetta. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  Will have to double the recipe next time to have some leftovers!

Totally love this soup!  It's easy to make and the taste is great.  It does remind me of the Zuppa Toscana soup at Olive Garden but BETTER!  The key to it is definitely using hot Italian sausage for a little kick.  Fantastic!  I will definitely make this again, perhaps for my Christmas party!!

This is one of the easiest and tastiest soups to make!  I altered the recipe slightly by increasing some of the ingredients.  I doubled the sausage required and omitted the pancetta. I also bought the sausage in bulk so there wasn't any sausage casings to deal with.  I fried the sausage in a frying pan on the stove breaking the big chucks up with a potato masher.  I then removed the sausage with a slotted spoon so I could leave the sausage drippings.  I doubled the onions from the recipe as well; I sauteed the onions and garlic in the sausage drippings and then added them to potatoes that were cubed and cooked in vegetable broth.  Again, I really increased the amount of potatoes; the recipe ask for 2 and I did about 10 medium sized potatoes.  I didn't measure the vegetable broth; added just enough to cover all of the potatoes. Note when you cube potatoes if you cook them longer than 15 or so minutes they disintegrate so if you want a chunkier soup then you really need to keep your eye on your soup.  I added the two cups of kale as instructed but I minced them since my kids aren't a big fan of kale and it really makes the recipe!  Lastly I added half n half in place of heavy cream. My youngest who claims to HATE soup ate every last drop of this soup!

I absolutely adore this recipe. I make it all the time for guests and family, and everyone asks me to give them the recipe! The only thing I do differently is that I often use chicken sausage; I like experimenting with the different flavors that Al Fresco makes, but I'm sure there are tons of other out there.

Great soup! I've never cooked with kale before so I wasn't sure if it had simmered long enough. But overall, great recipe - thanks marbalet :)

This soup is the best I've ever made!  I didn't have the pancetta so left that out, used 3 potatoes instead of 2, used Italian breakfast sausage instead of links and used 3 cups of water with a whole can of chicken broth because that is what I had on hand and it was fabulous.  My family LOVED it and I will definitely be making this again.  Delicious!!

I made a few ingredient changes because of what I had in my pantry.  I used 3 slices of bacon in place of the pancetta. I used spicy Italian turkey sausage, and I used fat free half and half in place of the heavy cream. It still tasted rich and flavorful. Thanks very much.

AwEsOmE !! Great easy homemade version of Olive Garden's Zuppa Tuscana soup !  I cut up the sausage (1 lb of hot, 1 lb of mild) & just cooked it in the soup pot with the onions. I doubled the recipe to have leftovers (yum!). The heavy cream definitely is a must for this, if you can have it & the kale is better than spinach if you want it to be like OG's. I topped it with extra crispy crumbled-up bacon.

I LOVE this soup! I did however make a few changes. instead of baking sausage links, I fried a lb of mild italian sausage. instead of cubed potatoes, I sliced mine on a mandolin. instead of 1 piece of pancetta, I used 4 pieces of reagular bacon. I also added 1 tbsp of crushed red pepper & doubled the amount of cream. this soup turned out amazing! it tasted exactly like zuppa toscana from the olive garden. I will be making this soup again VERY soon!

This was a good recipe.  I'm not sure what I did differently but it definitely took longer than 15 minutes to simmer the potatoes and I cut mine relatively thin.  I also added more cream and allowed the pancetta, garlic, and onions to caramelize before adding the chicken broth.  To me this seemed to an additional layer of much needed flavor.  I will probably use less kale next time, and chop them up smaller.  

Overall a tasty soup!

Fantastic, super easy, and loved by all who tasted it! I followed the recipe as written, but used 1 lb of the Hot (Spicy) Italian Sausage.   Only regret is that I didn't double to recipe, it was gone quick!   Thanks for sharing!

I made a few tweaks but didn't stray too far from the simplicity of this soup. It was great! I doubled the water with chicken broth because I had more kale than the recipe called for, and a lot of potato. Because of that, I put in about a cup of cream. I left the pancetta out because I used andouille sausage. Also added salt and pepper. This was absolutely delicious and my boyfriend actually asked to take the leftovers to work, which is rare for him (he's a leftovers snob).

This is as good as, if not better than the one at the restuarant.  Made it many times.  First time was much better.  Second time the potatoes began to fall apart.  The only difference, time 1 I used red skinned potatoes but time 2 I used baking potatoes.

This was excellent!! I don't cook a lot and this was my first time trying this recipe, but it still turned out fantastic. Recipe was easy to follow and dish was a big hit. I did follow some of the other commenter's suggestions in terms of using baby potatos for ease and I also used a bit more bacon for a bit more taste. Thanks for this wonderful recipe. Will surely be making this again.

i gave this a lower review because I feel the recipe is seriously lacking. I have made soup almost identical to this and I have found that homemade chicken stock is the only way to go. bouillon just doesn't cut it. you need the real stuff. also, nowhere near enough garlic. I typically use 5 or 6 cloves.(my rule is that you can never have too much garlic, and its never proved me wrong) and more onion is not going to hurt either. I buy a medium/large onion and use the whole thing, or I get two small onions and use them both. and pancetta, while it sounds nice, is not necessary. I use a half pound of thick-cut peppered bacon, and cut it while partially frozen into small bits, and then cook at the same time as the onion and garlic. the kale should be torn, not cut. those ribs don't cook down easily.   I would also recommend using red potatoes. they're starchier and don't break down quite as easily as baking potatoes.

This was great.  I doubled the potatoes and also used ground italian sausage rather than links, and 2 slices bacon rather than pancetta.  I cooked the potatoes in the chicken broth first and then used the immersion blender to puree some of it to give it some texture.  Then I added everything else, and added the cream just before serving. YUM!

Very similar to the other Olive Garden type soups available on the site, however I thought this was lacking something. In the end, I added fresh black pepper and added a lot more heavy cream. Will stick with the Tuscan Soup recipe from this site. Also, cut up the sausage links with scissors and cooked in the pot instead of baking to save a step.

AWESOME RECIPE!!! My aunt found this on your site while trying to recreate an Olive Garden favorite of hers.  In order to lower the fat content I used (hot) turkey italian sausage links and substituted olive oil for the bacon slice.  I also used Swanson's chicken broth w italian seasoning in place of bullion  water.  Turned out just as good as her batch following the recipe!  I will make this often.

Very good recipe for a great flavor.  I made it for Valentines dinner as an appetizer, my family love it, the only thing I did different is I peeled the sausages and cooked them on the stove like when you make ground beef. Then I drained the fat and mixed it with the soup.  I also added four tablespoons of white starch to add a little be of consistency.

If this is the same Holly that is in my Bookstudy group - well she made this soup last night along with someone else making great!!!! tortilla soup.  And the tortilla soup I ate very little of because I had second helping of this soup.

Good soup on a wintry evening w/sourdough rosemary bread!

I am not really a fan of Italian sausage, but I did enjoy this soup.  I used spicy sausage and about 3 slices of regular bacon.  I would have liked less Italian sausage and more bacon, personally.  I julienned the potatoes, used two bouillon cubes and added a little pepper.  The julienned potatoes turned out to be a great idea as I could thicken up the soup a bit by crushing them.  I will make this again with regular Italian sausage and less, adding more bacon.

This was really good.  I didn't have the pancetta or the kale, so I substituted regular bacon and cabbage which I had on hand.

I love Zuppa Tuscana from Olive Garden this recipe is similar and SO tasty!  However, instead of water I use chicken broth, and instead of sausage links I like ground spicy italian sausage.  Also, I tend to use more heavy cream.  Taste great!

I think this is a good soup. I did make some additions though. I used 4 potatoes and 6 cups water. I used 2 chicken bouillon cubes.  I also added 1 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp pepper, and 2 tsp nutmeg. It gave it a little more flavor and it wasn't very watery this way. I would have to say a very good recipe.

This recipe is outstanding! I used turkey bacon instead of pancetta because I needed to use it up, and I used quite a bit of it. I would not use regular bacon in the way this recipe is written--it won't crisp. Turkey bacon doesn't matter, because the fat in turkey bacon is just an illusion--the texture is solid all the way across. I also substituted fat free half and half for the heavy cream. I added red pepper flakes for heat, fennel seed because I just love any excuse to use it, and fresh Italian flat-leaf parsley because I need to use it up. I used a potato masher to smash some of the potatoes up to thicken the broth. I would make this soup again, doubling or tripling the batch, and doubling the kale recommended for any size of this recipe (it's quite tasty, but do be sure and not use the stems, even if you buy the bagged kale, strip it off the stems!). Thanks for the recipe, we loved it :)

This recipe is very much like Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana.  I like this one better.  I made it more spicy and added more meat.  I used ground Italian Sausage instead of links.  Very good.

We loved everything about this soup!  My husband kept eating bowl after bowl.  The 9 year old said it tasted like her favorite soup at a chain restaurant.  The only changes we made was the use of tuurkey bacon since we did not have pancetta on hand and a milk/cream cheese mixture instead ofthe cream.

I can't count how many times we've made this recipe. It freezes well. I would recommend using ground Italian sausage instead of the links. We just fry up the ground sausage after the pancetta, then add the broth and other ingredients. Very savory. Perfect on the coldest winter day.

I thought it was better the Olive Garden!

I did use a cup of cream and I added more pancetta.

Very tasty soup! I ate at Olive Garden last night and had their delicious potato-sausage soup, so I hoped to find a similar recipe.  I will make this often when the weather is colder. I followed the recipe, only added some salt and pepper.

Like other reviewers I halved the sausage and doubled the potatoes.  I only had hot Italian sausage links, so I slit the casings and used the sausage loose. It was still an awful lot of sausage.  Next time I will use half hot and half sweet sausage and maybe only 1/3 pound.  I didn't have any cream, so I used sour cream - YUM.  I also didn't have kale so left it out.  This was a VERY good soup and I will definitely be making it again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this twice, and I'll be making it again. The first time, I followed the recipe but substituted bacon for pancetta. I also used my stick blender to purée some of the potatoes before I added the final ingredients. It helped thicken the soup. The second time, I used leftover ham in place of both the bacon and sausage. Delicious both ways.

Yum! I used spicy Italian sausage and I loved it! I also used regular bacon because I'm not sure what pancetta is. One warning, once you slice up the sausage, it's really hard to "set it aside." I nibbled the whole time the potatoes were cooking!

Rave reviews from my husband!  I only made a couple of changes.  After reading reviews that the recipe was missing "something" I figured I'd throw in a tablespoon of fresh, snipped rosemary... a great addition!  Also, since my husband is allergic to dairy I used soy cream, which worked fine.  Definitely give this recipe a try!

Really easy and taste great.  I added ground Italian sausage, and cooked in on the stove top, with the onions, basil, and oregano. Added exstra pancetta bacon, chicken broth, and exstra cream.

Delicious! I made this for my mom and my siblings, and they loved it. It tastes just like zuppa toscana from olive garden, and I love it! I used half and half instead of heavy cream, and increased most of the ingredients to make a bigger pot of soup. Everyone should try this.

Great recipe! Didn't have the bacon. I added some red pepper flakes and used 4 potatoes. I also used about 6 cups of chicken broth instead of water and boullion and added a bit of salt to taste. Used all the kale that came in the bunch since I knew I wouldn't use it in anything else.

This is probably the best thing I have ever made. I made it for a family dinner and everyone loved it!! It tasted almost identical to the zuppa tuscana soup at the olive garden and that is my favorite soup. The pancetta bacon can be pretty spendy but its totally worth it. Thanks for the recipe!
Okay back again to talk about this recipe. I made it for my boyfriends family xmas party last weekned and it was a hit. It was the star dish of the night. To make it even better the family is italian and it was the most italian dish there. It was gone in seconds. Thanks again, this one is staying in my recipe book!!!!!!

This was a nice change dinner.  We really enjoyed the soup as a meal.  I could not find kale in the grocery store so I used frozen spinach, and drained and squeezed out all the water and added at the end of the cooking time for about 5 minutes..

My wife has always found my pasta creations superior to any restaurant, but always sent me to Olive Garden for their version of this soup; no more.  We both love this simple and easy recipe.

I found a similar recipe on another web search after visiting Olive Garden (difference was chicken broth instead of bullion, ground italian sausage instead of links and some tweaks to measurements).  My son said it was "right on the money" with Olive Garden's except for the spicyness.  I didn't add red pepper because I'm not found of really spicy things and wanted to try it.  Next time, I will add more red pepper to spice it up.  This is definitely a keeper!

this was awesome!  i made it with hickory smoked bacon and mild italian sausage.  i accidentally left the sausage pieces in when i put the chicken stock in to simmer, and it was still very yummy!  used olive bread to sop up the jucies.  Thank you for a great recipe

Delicious! The cream kind of separated when I added it, not sure why. But it was very, very good! Ate with homemade bread sticks, yum! Thanks for the post, I have been craving Olive Garden's. (:

I will confess I didn't make this as the recipe suggested, partly based on my preferences, partly based on other reviews, and partly because kale could not be found in my area. I used four hot Italian sausages, winged the onions (never follow proportions on them anyway), no bacon, winged the garlic, used my own frozen chicken broth from another meal, the equivalent of four potatoes, baby spinach instead of kale, and eight ounces of cream. I loved it as I revised, though my 16-year-old son thought it was too spicy. I can honestly say that I don't know that I would like the recipe all that much as it is. No big reasons other than I have my own ideas of proportions. Also, it really does need a lot of salt and other spices.

Great soup! I added celery, carrots, onions and mini tri  colored peppers!  Doubled the recipe and added 1 cup 2% milk and 1 cup half n half. Cooked this in my Cast Iron Dutch oven which brings it to a whole new level! I will def make this again!

I doubled the recipe  using bulk mild and bulk hot Italian sausage. This first step gave the kick so many mentioned in previous reviews. I used unsalted chicken stock, half and half, in lieu of heavy cream.  It was the best and now  a comment about the ads popping up constantly. You have rrf

This was AMAZING!! Way better than Olive Gardens Zuppa, which I love. I took the advice of some other reviewers and added more onion, garlic, and an extra slice of bacon. Also added basil, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and fresh parsley. Added fresh parmesean to the soup and topped the soup with it when it was finished as well. SOOOOO GOOOD!!!!! Will be making again for sure!

excellent base for the soup,but like a lot of others,I mixed it up a bit. I used ground Italian sausage and a kielbasa,still baked the same. I also added 2 more potatoes and pureed them,to get some thickness. Finally,I added a Tbls of chipped rep pepper for a kick. My 90 year old grand mother loved it,lol.

One of my most favorite soups!  I use chicken stock instead of bouillon.  I also use real bacon bits instead of actually frying up bacon.  And last I use the entire carton of heavy cream not just a 1/3 cup.  Wonderful tasty soup!

I made a few changes, used chicken broth rather than water and bouillon, bacon rather than pancetta.  Once it was mostly done I tasted and it was bland.  I added garlic powder and granulated bouillon and more cream.  It was good enough that I will make it again but next time I'll use crispy fried bacon added at the end rather than the sausage and add more potatos and kale.

This is better than Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana. Perfect for chilly fall and winter days, but I make it year round. I sometimes use hot Italian sausage and always add a nice pinch of dried red pepper flakes.

Fabulous.  My husband raved over this which he rarely does.  I added some grill seasoning and a pinch of curry as well as half a thinly sliced red pepper.  I loved, loved, loved the texture of the kale.

We loved this soup.  I used one can of chicken broth and added water to make 4 cups.  I also used bulk sage pork sausage and added some celery.  Finally, I used fat free half and half in place of the cream.  Very good - make sure you season as you go along!

I usually think of soups as taking time to taste good.  This is an exception.  This one is quick & delicious.  I used mild ground italian sausage and regular bacon.  I used 1 tsp. of "Better Than Bouillon"--this is much better than a cube.  I thought the kale was perfect in this soup-a great way to sneak in a different veggie that my family wouldn't otherwise eat and it holds up without getting mushy, too.   I did add  a little S&P for the finshing touch.

I just cooked this dish and I am so amazed that it turn out perfect,look out Food Network:) I did add a little parmesan and cayenne pepper, I also served it with garlic bread. My family loved it including my brother who just stopped by to hang out for a minute. It does taste like OG soup. I will cook this again especially since we lost our OG resturant during Hurricane Katrina here in Gulfport,MS.

YUM! I just made this soup today, husband said this is the best soup he probably ever had! Way better than O.G.'s.More rustic and flavorful. I used boullon amount as in recipe but it didn't cover the potatoes and I thought they wouldn't cook so I added about 2-3 cups of homemade chicken stock. It took a lot more than 15 min for the potatoes to cook more like 30 min (I used 3 potatoes).Used 3 slices of chopped pepper bacon instead. I would chop up the bacon a little more next time. I have always wanted to use kale, it just soaked up that bacon flavor. Any veggie that taste like bacon is my kind of veggie!Added more cream because of the extra stock, I added total about a cup. Loved it!

As usual, made a few changes:  substituted fresh Polish sausage for the Italian sausage and evaporated skim milk for the cream.  Also more or less doubled the garlic.  Great soup (albeit no longer "Italian")!  And ... now relatively healthful!

I just made this receipe. I added 2 bouillon cubes instead of one and used 1/2 pound of Pancetta and I too added red pepper. This soup tastes just like the one at Olive Garden.

Fantastic!!  I skipped the bacon and added more buillon but no salt and seasoned with a good dash of red pepper flakes and black pepper -  BETTER than the restaraunt version!!

This recipe was fantastic! I think the trick for me was using red pepper flakes, salt and pepper, and HOT italian sausage. In my opinion, it tastes just like the Olive Garden Soup and it was delicious. Both me and my boyfriend went back for thirds. In less than 24 hours there's not a drop left!

Very good!!  I didn't have any kale on hand when I decided to make this recipe, so I ended up using celery in it. Would probably add more potatoes next time, but it was good as written too.  My son is allergic to dairy and I wondered how it would be without the cream (scooping out his portion before adding it), and he loved it.  I actually used half and half instead of cream and that was fine too. I'm sure the cream would just make it richer. Overall, very good...we'll make it again.

This was really good, but it didn't taste too much like the Olive Garden kind to me. It didn't look great, but I think that's my fault. I used just regular bacon, because that's all I had, and I used a cup of cream because that's what I had, and I didn't figure I would use the cream for anything else. I used the spicy Italian sausage, and it was too hot for me, but I don't like really hot things. Overall I think it was good, and it would taste a lot better if I had some Olive Garden breadsticks, so if anyone knows a recipe for those, let me know.

I will try the soup again, but I will not bake the Italian sausage. At 300° and 20 minutes later It was still under cooked. Next time I will fry the sausage in a  skillet, it took longer than expected but overall it was   Very good.

I made this tonight and the only change I made is using chicken broth and used 6 slices of crumbled bacon! I also added a little more minced garlic and served with grated Parmesan cheese.  Great soup with a grilled cheese sandwich. Will definitely put in my soup rotation!

Absolutely delicious!!  I didn't have kale or any greens, but I did use mushrooms and peas instead... worked like a charm, and so easy too!  Oh and I just pan cooked the sausage, which for me was easier than baking them.  I'll definitely make this again.

Didn't have bacon, but  cooked the onions in 2 Tablespoons bacon grease, added a squirt of sriracha, doubled the bouillon, red pepper flakes, and used spinach instead of kale. Doubled it for 7 hungry fisherman and nothing was left.

Just okay, nothing special. Very watery and not much flavor. To anyone trying out this recipe: try it with spicy sausage; that may work out better than the sweet that I used.

I used baby greens  - kale, spinach and chard - because that is what I had available in the fridge. The soup was delicious using those greens. I added a pinch of seasoned salt. I do feel that using regular kale would have given it an even better texture. Will make this soup again. It was really enjoyable with crusty French bread.

Great! Very fast and very tasty. I too took the casing off the sausages and used  just the one pot to make the soup. I did not use water but all chicken broth. Added a couple more potatoes. Be careful with the salt as the sausages and  pancetta add enough.  A hearty soup that would be great for a cold evening and stands as a meal on its own with some good bread and maybe a side salad.

The only thing we did differently was the bacon. We used pieces of regular bacon because that's what we had, but it still turned out AMAZING! Our 12 year old loved it!

So Ive been craving this soup for several weeks. After my Son's Birthday party  I had enough left over  grilled bratwurst and added in the grilled corn also. I used golden potatoes. Frozen Kale. Doubled up and used a Low Sodium Not-Chick'n Bouillon. I didn't have heavy cream however I did have left over sourcream with ranch dressing mixed in that hadn't even left the fridge that day and added about a cup of milk. Turned out perfect and had so much flavor. :)) Enjoyed very much!!!

A few (successful) shortcuts: used a box of dried scalloped potatoes (broken up a bit while still dry) and half a bag table-ready chopped kale salad mix, added white beans and used milk instead of cream to lower fat content. Removed casing from one large link sweet Italian sausage, broke link up into small bits before frying in pot used for the soup. Soaked 1 tsp fennel seeds in some boiling water and added just the water to the soup to boost the sausage flavor. The sauce mix from the scalloped potatoes gave the soup the creamy texture needed; finished it with a little white wine and parmesan cheese.  I'll make it again.

Great recipe with simple ingredients. The 1st time i made it  I didnt have time to search for Pancetta at a regular grocery store so I substituted for 4 pieces of uncooked bacon (diced up)and sauteed it with the onions. I doubled up the sausage which ended up being a bit too much but all and all It was great! Let me save you some time. Cook the sausage however you want or to really make this fast, buy sausage already cooked, chop it up and throw it on the stove top  while your simmering the 1st half of the recipe. 

if your still reading this, I've tried the recipe with Pancetta (found it at trader joes) and it enhances flavor but bacon will do just fine!  Also have tried this with precooked chicken sausage. Tastes great!

I spent three hours trying to choose a recipe with turkey sausage and spinach, possibly tomatoes. Nothing in this recipe! But I knew with some modification of the ingredients it might be a winner. It was! Delish! I cooked it years ago keeping most of the original recipe but again subbing spinach, cause we always have so much. The original or with a couple subs, always amazing. I added more potatoes than called for, because I prefer more like a stew, and then a ton of herbs just cause they make a good thing even better. Also, tonight didn't have any cream on hand so used 2% milk, added at the same time as the potatoes to cook down. Worked out perfectly. Next I'm going to figure this one out in the crockpot!

Awesome soup! Very rich and perfect just the way it is!! Everyone in my house loved it- even the kids. I did change a couple things though: I didn't have bacon so I left that out and I didn't have heavy cream so I substituted it with milk and butter. This was AMAZING- seriously the best soup in a LONG time! I was very tempted to alter it and add more seasoning but I didn't- not even salt and I'm glad I left it alone. I would highly recommend this soup.

I love this recipe. the only thing I did different was add a ton more potatoes (6 in total). because honestly 2 seemed pretty lame. I think it could have used a few more too. My husband liked it a lot too.

I decided to use some Italian ground sausage instead, because it was cheaper at the time. I read some reviews that it was a bit bland, so I put twice as much garlic, some medley of Italian herbs that I had sitting in a pantry, some oregano, and a bit of red pepper flakes. The ground sausage probably introduced more flavor into the broth compared to the links, I'd presume. It turned out really well. I've always loved kale in soup, it always adds that extra level of texture that elevates the soup to the next level.

My husband really loved this soup!  I changed it up a bit by using spinach instead of kale; I didn't have any.  Rather than cooking the sausage in the oven I browned and cooked it in a pan.  I also added a little chili flake to the soup to give it a bit of a kick because my husband likes food a little spicy.  Next time I will probably just use hot Italian sausage.  I also added more potatoes; I think next time I will mashed some of the potatoes to make the soup a little thicker before adding the sausage and spinach into the soup. The day I made it I thought it was just ok; but when I reheated it the next day I loved it all of the flavors had blended together nicely.  My husband has already requested that I make it again.

I really liked this soup, as did the rest of the family. I see that several people complained that it was bland, but it may have to do with the type of sausage that was used. I used a mild sausage, as I have little ones who don't like spicy, but I took the sausage out of the casing, broke it up in the pot, and then sauteed it.  I did not add bacon, as there was enough fat in the sausage. I also used a really good chicken base ( I prefer the better than bouillon brand). It was delicious.

Yum! Though something was lacking, maybe extra butter? Also, a nice substitute was sweet Italian sausage, removed from the casing, and browned in a skillet before adding to the soup. Overall great recipe. I can eat the leftovers everyday for lunch till they run out.

Great recipe! My family loved it. I used Hot Italian sausage to give it a bit of a bite because my family prefers spicy, and I used white potatoes because they are firmer when cubed and cooked. Regular russets have a tendency to turn to mush when cooked. But otherwise it was awesome.

Great soup - whole family loved it!!  For extra flavor, definitely use the Spicy Italian sausage, plus I added an extra bouillon cube, Italian seasoning, Garlic salt, and Seasoned pepper, then served with a pinch of shredded parmesan cheese on top.

Great recipe! I too, love the Olive Garden Zuppa Tuscana soup, and this one is even better w/ a homemade touch. I boil the roasted chicken bones from one of those $4.99 Costco chickens after using the meat, and make the stock for this soup. It just adds a richer taste than water. I use a non-MSG bouillon. Sometimes I add red bell pepper (for color) when I saute the sausage (no nitrate/nitrite sausage from New Seasons-I like Hot Italian Sausage, or add red chile pepper seeds to mild sausage), half and half if I don't have cream, and 1 slice of regular bacon if I don't have the pancetta. 2-3 garlic to my taste. Roasted red pepper in the jar-either pickled or plain would work here, too. My daughter and grandson both loved this soup. If you don't see enough of the kids and grandkids, invite them to dinner!
If I don't have kale, I have used arugula or chard from the garden. Here in Oregon, it grows all winter long out there.

The soup definitely needed some seasoning. I added some salt,pepper, and chives and used smoked bacon instead of pancetta. I addesd a small sprinkle of Nutmeg and some chopped parsley on top of each bowl of soup before serving.

It was easy to make.  First time trying out kale and I don't like it!  I'm sure you can sub the kale or add no greenery.  Will mash some of the potatoes for a heartier/thicker soup.  I added a dash of pepper and jarred red bellppepper for color.

I made this minus the pancetta and with spinach instead of kale (that's what I had on hand). It was so good! I used spicy sausage and a pinch of red pepper flakes which gave it quite a kick. So good.

Add some extra pancetta and to spice it up, use the spicy Italian sausage (I needed to bake them for about 30 minutes) and extra salt at the end.  Topped w/ Parmesan - was a meal in itself.  No need to puree, if the potatoes are cubed small and cooked until really tender.  Delicious!

I've never had the soup at Olive Garden everyone keeps mentioning, but this is delicious! I used a box of chicken broth instead of a bouillon cube. I was afraid it would be bland with such few ingredients, but I guess less is more in this case. It was full of flavor. I only added salt and pepper to taste. You can definitely get away with doubling the potatoes and pancetta. I'll be making this again!

This soup was quite tasty on a cold evening. I used coconut milk instead of heavy cream. Also,i added some red pepper.

Delicious soup! Used both sweet and hot sausage as I had some that needed to be used up. Doubled recipe which was great as my husband had it for both lunch and dinner. Next time as we like spicy I will likely stick with hot sausage. First time I have cooked with kale.

Fabulous soup.    I used one whole onion, 6 diced potatoes, 4 pcs diced pancetta bacon, 4 cloves of garlic and 4 cups of julienne kale.   It was terrific, and garnished with nice cracked black pepper.

Awesome soup...more like a chowder.  I loaded up on potatoes, kale and sausage as my family likes a more hearty soup during the fall.  Taste was wonderful...added a little extra Herbox bouillon.

This recipe is delicious!!!  I used 1/2# hot sausage and 1/2# sweet sausage...added just a little zip!  I used 1/4# smoked bacon cause I couldn't find pancetta, really liked the smokey flavor it added.  I will make this over and over again!!!   Gayle in Warwick, RI
p.s. anyone have any idea where to buy pancetta? do I have to go to a specialty store?

Absolutely delicious. I browned hot Italian sausage, used chicken broth, and added an extra cup of kale. Left everything else the same. Definitely use the hot sausage!

This was a wonderful, hearty, savory soup. I used ground light sausage and rolled it into 1 inch sausage meatballs, browned them and added them at the end as instructed. I also substituted fat free half and half for the cream. I added sea salt and cracked pepper at the end to taste. It was great!! My husband loved it! Definitely a keeper!

We have made this recipe several times.  However, we increase all the ingredients and make a large stock pot full, so there are plenty of leftovers.  We've added a few items, gave it a little kick and love it! I use the cut bacon instead of pancetta bacon, add sliced smoked kielbasa and sliced beef sausage. AND....we add Louisiana cajun seasoning.  This is definitley not a low fat recipe, but it sure tastes awesome!

I doubled this recipe for leftovers. I used homemade turkey stock instead of bullion/water, and I also used turkey sausage. The kale came out of my garden and I used two different kinds- curly leaf and flat leaf that had lots of purple in it. It added nice variation of texture and color; I recommend it if you have different kinds available. One modification I would recommend is adding the cream once the soup is removed from the heat. Mine curdled a little from the high heat, and it was only at a gentle simmer. I also cooked the sausages in a pan over the stove- but that's not a real biggie as far as modifications go.

This soup was amazing!  It was really easy to make too!  I substituted some black forest bacon for the pancetta and added an extra slice.  I accidentally added 1 cup of cream instead of 1/3, but it probably made it even better!

I added an extra cube of chicken bullion because it seemed a bit bland to me too, and that helped.  All in all, it was super tasty, and I am definitely making it again!  However I will be experimenting in the future with adding more to it for that extra kick of flavor.
