This is not a proper Long Island.  The ultimate goal of a L.I. is to have larger quantities of alcohol in the proper proportions to avoid an overly-boozy taste.  The cola should merely add a bit of color, nothing more.  6 oz is unheard of....  To think this recipe was submitted by a liquor company.

A long island iced tea should contain only a splash of cola.  Six ounces is way, way too much cola!

Not very potent compared to most Long Island Iced teas that I've tried.  I used diet soda to cut some of the calories.  Very tasty.
