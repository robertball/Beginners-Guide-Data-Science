I thought the original recipe looked quite bland, but the ingredients inspired me. I used the mixed greens, pears, grapes and blue cheese, but dressed it in balsamic vinaigrette. It was wonderful! The tastes were incredibly balanced.

My 15-year-old son took one bite of this salad and said, "This is amazing." It is scrumptious, sensational--the best salad I've eaten in 50 years!

I thought this salad was great. I thought the ranch dressing was a bit to heavy and will try a lighter dressing next time.

This salad was a nice change from the usual "garden salade or greek salad".  I used a pre-bagged mesculun mix, I tossed in the blue cheese crumbles (which I recommend), and I used the "Ranch Dressing II" recipe found on this site. Definitely serve this salad immediately.  The ingredients in the salad cause it to wilt a lot quicker than normal.  Although I enjoyed this salad, this still doesn't beat out my favorite Spinach and Strawberry salad recipe found on this site.

This was an intersting salad.  We had it along side bbq hamburgers.  I would definately make it again...next time trying pecans instead of walnuts.  I used 'Mesculin Mix' that you weigh out at the supermarket  for the greens.  I don't know if that's what they meant by mixed greens, but it tasted great!  It had a mix of baby greens, raddichio, etc...  My fiancee enjoyed it and he never likes dressing on his salads...but the ranch dressing complimented it well.

I wanted to have a little bit of summer during this cold snap we're having, so I bbq'd steaks and made this salad. It's delicious! All the flavors go really well together and it's so simple to make.

I thought this was a really tasty recipe! I didn't have any Regular Ranch dressing so I used KRAFT Ranch and Bacon and it was delicious! I didn't use the Blue Cheese as we are not a big fan of that - instead I used mild while cheddar! Mixed red and green grapes and used the pecans! It was a hit! Definiately make this one again!

Yep- this salad is amazing! I, too, used homemade ranch dressing from this site and it does make a difference (and ranch dressing is sooo easy to make). Served it at a dinner party and everyone raved!
