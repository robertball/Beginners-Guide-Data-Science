Made this for a friend who LOVES pecan pie, and is a total chocoholic. It got great reviews from the whole group. Also, works pretty well as "mini pies" using a muffin pan as the baking pan, you just have to keep a closer eye on them in the oven. Seemed to take around 20 minutes for mine and they got great reviews. Everyone was thrilled as we didn't have to deal with any cutlery or dishes at all.

I followed this recipe with one exception; I used Ghiradelli dark chocolate rather than Bakers chocolate.  The end result wasn't what I expected so I give 4 stars.  I thought the center would be somewhat similar to that of a pecan pie; so I was disappointed as it was exactly like a big expensive brownie in a pie shell.  The taste however was good and I attribute that to the fact that I used ghiradelli brand chocolate.

The chocolate helps counter the sweetness of the usual pecan pie in this recipe. Next time, I may try it in a chocolate crumb crust rather than a traditional pie crust.

This pie was really yummy! Everyone loves a good pecan pie, but this one had something special to it. I will give one bit of advice to anyone who hasn't made a pecan pie: Don't add more nuts than it calls for. This wont make it taste better, it will only create some extra nuts that have no space to float to the top.
