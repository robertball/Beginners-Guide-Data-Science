wayyyyyy too sweet!!!!!  I looked at the recipe and decided that it called for way more sugar than anything I wanted to serve, but because I enjoy the combination of pineapple/coconut and pecans decided to make it with 7/8 of a cup of sugar instead of the 2 cups called for.  First bite was overwhelming  with it's sweetness!  Way too much with less than half the sugar called for!
Will not make it again

I liked it. I made sure to drain the pineapple since some people said it was soupy. Mine turned out fine. Iâ€™d suggest covering it with aluminum foil while baking Becca the top can get way too browned. I also added a teaspoon of butter extract to the mix.

The amount of ingredients called for in the recipe was enough for 2 9 inch pies. It was soupy.
