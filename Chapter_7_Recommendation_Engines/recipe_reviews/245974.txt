Pleasantly surprised by this dish!  Adding the veggies to the rice really sped things up, not to mention saving having to clean an additional pan.  I used onion and broccoli, which was fabulous!   I used thyme as my seasoning on the steak, which was a nice change, however the family still missed salt on their beef.

This came together in a flash and I actually pulled it off in less than 30 minutes. The rice is universal enough that you could use any vegetables you like or ones you had leftover from another meal. I do have one suggestion and that is that you finely chop your fresh herbs before combining them with the oil so that they distribute better on the steak. This is a great recipe for when you are short on time or simply don't feel like slaving for hours in the kitchen.
