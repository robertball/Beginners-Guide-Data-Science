This is the first time I ever made or ate stuffed peppers.  The only change I made was to add some sauteed onions and garlic.  Other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  The recipe made TONS more "stuffing" than I needed to fill four peppers.  And the peppers were still very crisp and crunchy after I cooked them.  My husband said every time he ate stuffed peppers before, they were soft.  Still, they tasted fine and it made a nice meal.

I'm not a vegetarian, but from side-by-side taste testing, I think it tastes better if you substitute black beans in place of the ground beef.

Excellent with a few additions to kick up the flavor a bit. I used ground turkey, added a little enchilada sauce I needed to use up, and seasoned with fresh garlic, chili powder, cumin, and oregano. I did have to bake these for more like 40 minutes to get the rice cooked, but maybe my salsa didn't have enough liquid in it. So good. Thank you!!! :)

Me and my bf both liked this! We added some avocado and a few other veggies and it came out tasty! Make sure you cook the peppers a bit before sticking in the oven to soften them up a bit.

Peppers should have been steamed before stuffing them.

This is the 1st time I made stuffed peppers.  I blanched the peppers for 5 minutes then stuffed and baked them for 30 mins in the oven.  Added 1/4tsp cayenne.

I made this for the first time last week for my husband and I. The hubs loved it. I added black beans, onions, and garlic to the mixture and it turned out great. Next time I will use green bell peppers because I prefer those over the red but was a fan and will cook it again.

Easy to make, but very bland.  Cooked for about 35 mins to make sure the peppers were soft enough.  Will make these again, but will add more seasoning!

We loved this!  I doubled the recipe-used medium salsa, and used only one cup of cheese.  My kids loved it so much they have packed it for lunch at school!

Decent. A little bland but not bad.
