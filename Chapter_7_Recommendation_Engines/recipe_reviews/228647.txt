This is the exact same whole wheat pancake mix I learned to make from my Dad. To make the actual pancakes, I use one cup mix and add in one cup buttermilk, one egg, and two tablespoons melted butter. This also works for Moms like me who like to make large batches of pancakes at one time. All you do is freeze them on baking sheets in one layer until firm, then portion them out into freezer bags.

Great mix.  I added two scoops of vanilla protein powder.  When it came time to make the pancakes, I used a cup of batter to a cup of liquid, in my case, Egg Nog!, plus two Tbsp of oil or melted butter.  I've added a bit of vanilla at times too.  Fantastic quick throw together.

I made this recipe with modifications to make it more multi-grain. To make up the total amount of flour, I used small amounts of rye flour, quinoa flour, oat bran, corn meal, then a generous amount of whole wheat flour and a lot less unbleached white flour.  I used the called-for amounts of other ingredients.  To be healthier I used safflower oil.  When I made the mix, using one cup of dry mix, one cup of milk (I used soy milk), plus the egg and 2 T oil, I found it a little too wet.  No problem!  I just added a little more mix.  The pancakes were delicious, fluffy and exactly what I hoped for.  Next time I'll try substituting applesauce or other pureed fruit butter for the oil. I've used apple butter or pureed prunes with good success. Another favorite substitute for me:  instead of an egg I use 1 T ground flax seed with 3 T water, whip briskly for several minutes until really thick and viscous.  It works great as an "egg" and hasn't ruined any recipes for me yet.  I think in future I'll make this with whatever flours I have available and maybe even substitute a scoop of protein powder (shake mix) for some of the flour to make up the total.  It is fun to experiment!  And it always, always comes out great.  The only caveat: I do find that I can't make waffles well without some oil. For pancakes this could work with less oil but waffles need this amount.

The only thing I change is that I use two eggs when mixing up a batch, separate them and whip the egg whites into stiff peaks, then fold them into the rest of the batter.  Makes the pancakes so light and fluffy even though they are whole wheat pancakes.  I save the egg yolks for another day.

My 3 year old son is a pancake fanatic.  We both absolutely loved these.  I used 3 cups wheat flour and 5 cups unbleached flour b/c that is what I had available.  I also substituted natural applesauce for the oil.  Great pancakes!

Without question, the best and fluffiest pancakes I've ever made. I always used a mix in the past and am trying to cook from scratch, so this was my first attempt at pancakes. Will only use this recipe from now on. :-)

Seriously better than packaged mix and a great basic recipe.  I make it a bit healthier by upping the whole wheat flour by a cup - and reducing the while flour by the same.  Also add about 1/2 a cup of wheat bran, and use organic coconut sugar instead of white sugar.  When making the pancakes, add a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to the cup of milk and let it sit for a few minutes before combining with the mix to get the benefits of buttermilk - lighter and fluffier.

Followed dry recipe to the T. 
When making, though, I added 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar to the milk and let it sit for a few minutes (basically making buttermilk.) Super fluffy &  delicious!
+ Also tasted good with chocolate chips!

Delicious, fresh tasting pancakes. There really is a significant taste difference from store bought mixes. Very easy to create the mix too. I also subbed whole wheat flour for the unbleached all-purpose flour and it turned out great just using this type of flour.

Love having a healthy pancake mix available. I put it in a zippie bag and in the freezer with the directions written on the bag. So my teenage boys can help themselves.

I thought this was a very helpful recipe! I didn't have any oat flour, so I just added oats instead! Worked great! I also added some honey to them (1 tablespoon). They were delicious! Thanks

Best pancakes I've ever made! Made this mix for camping, and it's now my go to pancake mix period! I didn't have wheat flour, so I used all white, which I know makes them less healthy, but it didn't make them any less tasty :) I added a tsp of cinnamon to the dry mix, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the wet mix, based on another review. I'm also allergic to dairy, so I used oat milk w/ a Tbsp of cider vinegar as someone suggested, and safflower oil. For camping, I brought the mix in 1 ziplock, premixed the liquid ingredients in another, and for breakfast just dumped the liquid into the dry & shook - cut a hole in the corner for pouring, added blueberries on the griddle, and viola! Just made these again on my stove this morning, and they are still the lightest pancakes I've ever had!

LOVE this recipe! I’ve been using it for a few years now and never make any changes. We use it for waffles and pancakes and they’re always delicious. Sometimes we add in some oats while preparing the batter and it’s delicious that way as well. I highly recommend these over boxed mixes! Saves money and is healthier.

I cut the recipe in half the first time because I had my doubts and didn't want to waste all that flour. No more doubts! This is an excellent mix! I'm on my second full batch. Now, when you actually make the pancakes, you absolutely *must* add at least one teaspoon of vanilla extract. Or, a little more. You can also try a dash of nutmeg for holiday pancakes. A little almond extract is good, too. And, of course, you can't go wrong with cinnamon. Try some different combinations of all of these. I use a tiny amount of syrup for my pancakes, sometimes none. So, I like a little flavor in mine. Know what else is good? Make extra pancakes so you can have banana pancake sandwiches later in the week. Slice the banana and sandwich it between two reheated pancakes, no syrup. I love it but my kid refuses to skip the syrup so she dips. :)

I substituted Stevia for the sugar in the pancake mix and then used apple sauce instead of oil when I made the pancakes.  It was excellent.  I have a family member who is diabetic and who also needs to watch the fat intake.   The pancakes were a big hit and a real treat.

Love it!  I added 1.5 cups of powdered buttermilk to the mix...that helps give it that "pancake" taste and texture.

Love this base recipe.  I like to add a generous amount of cinnamon and some nutmeg to the dry mix.  When making pancakes I also add one teaspoon of vanilla to the wet mix (per cup of milk and egg).  I also occasionally add chopped apples, walnuts to add more flavor.  Delicious!

This recipe was a great starter recipe. These pancakes were soft, fluffy and moist. Just as much so as white flour pancakes. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was because they were a little lacking in flavor. I added cinnamon , vanilla protein powder and used coconut oil as the oil and they were amazing. This is my new favorite recipe with the modifications.

Great recipe but adding A cup of liquid to the cup of mix makes it a little too soupy. Instead, I found adding vanilla to taste, 4 tbsp melted butter plus 2 eggs to my 2 cups batter and approximately 1 1/4 c skim milk worked well. It's a healthier version since the whole-wheat flour is used and my kids still love them.

Easily the most amazing flapjacks i have ever had. I make these nearly every morning. I did substitute coconut butter (Rich & Creamy MELT® Organic) for veggie oil for some added health benefits. I made it several times with oil before making substitutions and it was amazing! I wouldnt have changed a thing if my doc hadn't advised more omega 6 in my diet, and thats an easy substitution thats healthy.

Ive added blueberries and nuts to them, hard to find a way to make them better than "plain". Great recipe.

We've used this mix for a long time and love it.  The only thing I do differently is that I use all whole wheat flour and coconut sugar.  They turn out great every time!

I used all whole wheat and whole spelt flour.  Turned out great!  Try adding 1 tsp vanilla or almond extract for flavour or serving with fruit compote (Cook 3 c mixed berries w/1 tbsp corn starch) instead of syrup.

Excellent  simple recipe, and I would make it again. I especially like that you can make dry ingredients ahead  and just add wet ingredients when you your ready for some delicious pancakes.

Excellent mix. I did change it to fifty/fifty on the whole wheat flour and all purpose flour. My family is very picky about their pancake mix and it passed with flying colors. I added homemade buttermilk substitute instead of milk, too.

Okay, so this recipe was REALLY easy. I halved it (9 servings) using the "Adjust" thingee and followed their measurements and authors "cup of mix, cup of milk etc..." instructions.
But seeing how much mix I had, I doubled everything and ended up with basically water.
Fortunately, I had enough mix to add to thicken it up. The pancakes turned out fine after that, but be careful if you are making a double batch.

Its a pretty good recipe the way it is.  I did find them to be pretty dry, though.  I added 1/2 cup of applesauce per cup of mix and they are nice and moist.  the leftovers are moist also.

This is now our go-to pancake mix recipe. The only adjustment I made was lighter on the salt,  but that's a personal preference.  I have three picky eaters in the house, and they all loved the pancakes...clueless to them being made with whole wheat.  Better than Bisquit!

I’ve been making this for a couple years now and I’ve added a few things when I make it. It’s a great base for any kind of pancake you want to make. To make the pancake I do one cup of milk (any liquid you like), 2 Tbs of oil, an egg (or a flax egg) and any spices I like such as cinnamon and nutmeg. It doesn’t fluff up a lot because of the whole wheat flour, but I like knowing it’s healthy.

OMG these are fantastic!! this is going to be my go-to pancake recipe from now on.. the only thing i did differently was using brown sugar for the sugar, subbing full fat greek yogurt for the oil, and using an almond milk/coconut milk blend for the regular milk (lactose intolerant).. one cup of mix makes 7 good sized pancakes.. i'm so looking forward to trying add in's and possibly subbing other flour's or using protein powder in this etc.. ty SO much for the recipe.. this deserves more than 5 stars

Very simple and good recipe.   This has become my go-to for making whole grain pancakes.  I add also add flaxseed and some carrot juice and my children can never tell.  These freeze great and you can just pop them in the toaster on busy mornings.

I enjoyed these pancakes. The changes I made was to omit the sugar and add a little vanilla extract to the batter. I also used buttermilk because that's what I had on hand. Great recipe!

Great! I made it with 6 cups whole wheat and 2 cups white flours, and then I tried adding flaxseed meal to today's 1 cup of it. I also used a sweetener blend (copycat Trim Healthy Mama gentle sweet) in place of the sugar. This was a great base recipe to be able to make my own way. I am excited to have a mix to go to for easy, quick, delicious, and moderately healthy pancakes!

Followed the receipt; good tasting but soon after removed from heat they seemed to fall a little "flat" - sounds silly for a pancake but only way I can describe it. Basically not as fluffy as I'm used to.

Usually "healthy pancakes" tend to be the opposite of fluffy and not so tasty. This mix however was great! I didn't make any changes. Very simple and tastes wonderful. The pancakes were still fluffy and moist. I've made them several times using this mix.

The whole family loved these! And we've got some picky eaters! I've always made pancakes with white flour, so was afraid they might not be too excited about whole wheat. We're trying to be a little healthier. This worked! I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I may experiment a little, add more fiber, maybe some ground flax seed. Make sure you don't overcook or they could turn out a little dry. Fabulous!!

I've used this recipe again and again, for my family and for breakfast-for-supper at church. It's simple, wholesome and yummy. I add the milk gradually, though, so I can stop before the batter gets too runny. All in all, this is one of my favorite recipes on the site.

Really good basic pancake mix. 
I used 2 eggs instead of just one and a splash of Vanilla Extract.
We will definitely make it again!

Awesome homemade pancake/waffle mix!! I will adjust and use more ww flour and less white flour in my next batch. It's the same if not better than a whole wheat baking mix we use and it's a costly one. You must try it! Enjoy!

Awesome homemade pancake/waffle mix!! I will adjust and use more ww flour and less white flour in my next batch. It's the same if not better than a whole wheat baking mix we use and it's a costly one. You must try it! Enjoy!

I love this recipe. I substitute applesauce for the oil and sprinkled coconut and flax seeds while they were cooking.  I found making one big pancake worked better than trying to make smaller ones. Will try the waffles next time.

This is basically my exact recipe! The only changes I made are the bleached flour. I use only wholewheat flour. Very fluffy pancakes!

Very good as a basic waffle mix! Added a dash of cinnamon. Think I might splash some vanilla in it next time, too.

Thanks for a great recipe. I add 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar to my milk to sour it for ~ 10min when I make them. Great! My 18mo old LOVES these.

Good basic recipe I keep the dry mix in canister and kids do not notice wheat. First time I followed recipe with eggs and milk and added fresh and fresh pureed blueberries very good and second time I had no eggs so did pureed persimmons and cinnamon and some milk to thin out and still delish! Can't wait to try with some pureed pumpkin ;)

Had on hand for our family week. The kids loved it, and it was so easy having it on hand. We made it gluten- free with whole wheat rice flour and buckwheat flour. Worked as well as regular pancakes would have!

If I would have known that making pancake mix was this easy, I would have never, ever bought ready made pancake mix. And this mix is so much more healthy that the store bought kind. You are in control of the ingredients. The pancakes were fluffy. I used 1/2 buttermilk and 1/2 1% milk for a variation on the recipe. Turned out great!

Love.  Healthier than a store-bought, non-whole-grain recipe, but just as, if not more delicious. Next time I want to try using applesauce instead of oil.

Great recipe, so far I have tried it plain, with chocolate chips, and with chocolate chips and bananas and it has been a perfect basic pancake. It really rises up for me and makes a fluffy pancake.
