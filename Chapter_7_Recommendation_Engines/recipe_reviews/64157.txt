I really enjoyed this chicken. I used fresh basil instead of dried and more fresh orange zest. I don't have a grill, so I baked this and then put it under the broiler to brown. Was very yummy. Terrific hot or cold. I can't stand to throw away marinade, so I boiled the remainder down to a glaze to serve with the chicken.

A perfect meal for summertime.  I used more orange zest than the recipe called for, and I squeezed fresh oranges for the juice.  This gave the recipe a punch of orange flavor.  I also baked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  So moist and tender!  FYI: I just purchased a microplaner for zesting oranges, lemons, etc. - - what a fabulous tool.  Gives you all the zest and essentials oils that recipes call for.

Loved the combo of ingredients, but desired a stronger flavor.  Made it for a freezer meal swap and everybody liked it.  I am going to take the recommmendation of a reviewer to use orange juice concentrate and fresh basil....and I love the idea of boiling down the marinate to make a glaze....I think those recommendations are exactly what it needs.  I did like it enough to stick with it...I plan to make 3 batches to put in freezer storage bags tonight....easy pre-made meals to take camping!

I didn't have time to marinade, so I just dumped all the ingredients in a frying pan and boiled the chicken in them, using extra OJ and a little water. When the chicken was done I took it out and added about 1-tsp cornstarch dissolved in water to the pan, and boiled the marinade into a sauce. The only changes I made were I used fresh basil and a fresh squeezed orange, and added another Tbsp honey.  It was a very pretty, very easy, very yummy dish! Probably would have been bland without the sauce though.

Awesome, no changes necessary, but I do like a stronger basil flavor.  Alternative for a stronger orange is to use 1/4 cup of frozen orange juice concentrate.  Yum.

This was a very good recipe. The chicken was nice and juicy very flavorful.  The only thing I will do differently is cut down on the orange, a little too much.

Very good! Served this to company and everyone liked it. I juiced one orange and marinated 2 chicken breasts cut in quarters. You can really taste the orange! I also added cilantro since our garden is flowing over with it. I'll grill it again. tasty leftovers for chicken wraps too!

This chicken is quiet delicious.  I did use fresh basil because I had some on hand and needed to use it, but other than that, I followed the recipe. Grilled chicken always has a great taste, but the after taste of this chicken is really what made the marinade worth it.  Yum!!

Took another reviewer's advice and boiled the marinade to make a sauce.  Would have been 2 stars without the sauce as the chicken was rather bland.  Next time I have a craving for orangey sweet chicken, I'll make Rosemary Chicken with Orange-Maple Glaze from this site instead.

This recipe was amazing even though we were only able to marinate for about half hour.  Can't wait to try it after marinating overnight!!

Very very yummy. I was lazy and didn't get to marinate this overnight and it was still very good. Also, we haven't assembled our grill, so I cooked this in a skillet and yum! Highly recommend this! Very easy to prepare as well. Definitely a keeper! Update: I grilled this chicken this time round - actually not as good, disappointly. I will cook this in a skillet on stove-top next time.

Very refreshing.  Used fresh OJ and fresh parsley - the parsley made it so tasty and pretty (don't leave out the fresh parsley!).  Marinated it overnight and cooked it on the BBQ.  Only change was I used dried oregano instead of basil.  Will make again.

I used this marinade for chicken thighs and it was most excellent.  Will use it again on other cuts of chicken.

Doubled the marinade and used it as a sauce. Added approx. 1/4 cup of corn starch to make it thicker and cooked it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30-45 min. Tasted very good. Sweet without being too sweet.

Wow, I made this for my family for dinner ealier today and they loved it. I've never been a good at anything other than baking but since my fiance was coming back from a long trip I'd thought surprise him, he and my picky son loved it. It took some searching, but I'm glad I was able to find this recipe lastnight, especially since it was so easy to follow. I did double the amount of orange zest though, for a more of an orange flavor.

Loved this marinade/glaze. Baked it in the oven in a small baking dish. Put the chicken and juices it baked in on top of the pasta. Perfect light flavoring.

Next time I would double the marinade and then cook the remainder for a sauce.  I served it with rice and cauliflower so everything was a bit dry though the flavour of the chicken was very good if you like sweet meat.

This turned out really great. I needed an excuse to use some fresh basil from my herb garden, so chose this recipe.

Everyone loved it, even the Kids. 

However, I only marinated it for 3 hrs because didn't want lemon and/or basil to be too overpowering. Had just the right hint of both.

I used this for making kabobs - yummy!  A really welcome change from the soy sauce / teriyaki type of marinade.

I loved this recipe. Very simple. I only marinaded it for about 4 hours because I forgot. I can't imagine it being more delicious if it had marinated over night. Bryan W.

I made this with some stir fry and spaghetti and it tasted awesome. It was very orangy...

Used this for chicken kabobs, and it made the chunks very moist and tender. All I could taste was orange though, so I'm not sure what the point of the parsley and basil is. Will have to tweak it a bit more, maybe with garlic and grated onion.

This marinade was really delicious, but I made in the oven, and cooked it for half hour in 400 degree oven. I also had some Spicy Tangy Orange sauce on hand,and I put a little but of that on the chicken while it cooked.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I have tried from this website.  I squeezed fresh oranges instead of the bottled kind.  I doubled my marinade, then reduced it down to make a sauce.  Taste even better with the sauce on top.  This went right into my cookbook.

This was excellent.  I used less oil and I also added a clove of garlic.  I used orange concentrate like other people suggested.  I also marinated for 2 days.

This chicken was delicious!! I used fresh basil instead of dried, and used fresh orange juice. I probably could have had it marinade longer, but it was still good. My grill wasn't working so I cooked in a pan on the stove and it got a gorgeous golden color! Thanks for this yummy recipe I will definitly make again! :]

We thought this was just o.k.  Because our dinner plans got interrupted, the chicken marinated for two days.  Don't know if that had anything to do with it but all I could really taste was the oil and the basil.  Barely noticed the orange flavor and didn't taste the honey at all.  I think next time I would use orange juice concentrate and maybe a little more honey.

Would have liked it better without the dried basil.
