In an effort to cut sugar and flour out of my diet, I opted to substitute an 8 oz can of tomato sauce for the tomato soup. I also left out the water because I didn't think it needed it. I seasoned each side of the pork chops with salt, pepper and garlic powder which was very good with the sauce. The flavor was wonderful and this will become a go-to recipe for me because it is inexpensive, easy and is on the table in less than 30 minutes. Yum!

I thought this was very good. I had a can of tomato soup that I wanted to use up so it was perfect for that. The chops were very juicy. Some of the reviewers said it was bland so I seasoned the chops first with seasoned salt and subbed white wine for the water. I added sliced mushrooms, green pepper, and garlic when I was cooking the onions. I used a very high quality Hungarian sharp paprika. This made all the difference. It adds a nice kick to any dish that calls for paprika. I served this with steamed broccoli and cauliflower for an easy weeknight meal. I would make this again. The boyfriend LOVED it.

Fixed as written. The sauce was funky for pork chops. Had just an odd taste. Can't think how it can be fixed to make it better. I think it was the tomato soup. Just not right for this recipe. We ate it, but I won't fix it again.

Worked very well however, it needs a little extra seasoning. I recommend salting the porkchops before browning and adding some garlic salt or Adobe seasoning to the sauce as well.

Made this with some home made stewed tomatoes - very tasty.  Like another reviewer it seemed like mushrooms would have been good in this dish.  The volume of onions was a bit overwhelming although the flavor was fine.  More paprika, some red pepper, or some hot sauce would have been nice to pump up the flavor.
