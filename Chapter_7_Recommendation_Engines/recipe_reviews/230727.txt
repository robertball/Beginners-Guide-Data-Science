I made this for recipe group today. I thought I had everything for this until I started to put it together. I couldn't find my dry mustard anywhere, so I used a 1/2 tsp prepared mustard, and I found out I was out of garlic salt which was an omen, because it was PLENTY salty enough (I just added a 1/4 tsp of plain garlic powder instead). The cucumber was definitely detectable and I used a small one. This was very creamy, so I'm thinking I could have added more pasta, since we were eating right away, or it would be a good make ahead salad as I don't think it would dry out too much over night. Anyway, I think it's a nice change from the traditional salads of this sort that use Italian-style dressing and since I've never used a sour cream/mayo base in a pasta salad before, I must admit I was pleasantly surprised how well they work together. I would suggest adding some chopped tomato and crumbled bacon though to make it five stars:)...that's what I ended up doing and it was delicious!

I omitted the black olives and added sliced carrots.  Those were my only changes.   This seemed like  the base of a pasta salad.  I would have liked more vegetables, some grape tomatoes, some herbs in the dressing and some lemon juice.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this pasta salad for the Buzz Recipe Group selection.  While this was an easy recipe to prepare, the different ingredients just did not blend and suit our taste.  It is very creamy and the cucumber is very noticeable.  I served it on individual plates of spring mixed greens along with grilled hamburgers.  Thanks NCO-s wife for sharing your recipe!

I did add about 2 tablespoons of ranch seasoning mix and also added chopped cheddar cheese. Also added more mayo and milk to make it more creamy.

Made for Recipe Group. I left out the olives since I don't like them. By suppertime the salad was really dry, and I doubled the dressing to start. It was just too bland for us. I resurrected it by dousing in Ranch dressing, added some grape tomatoes and McCormicks Salad Supreme. Thanks anyway.

This is a great base recipe that one can add whatever veggies they like or have on hand. I added broccoli, zucchini, orange pepper and a small amount of bacon bits, Along with what the recipe called for. I always make extra for later snacking and so it doesn’t get to dry I double the sour cream and mayo( I had about a cup of Marzetti ranch veggie dip which I used and cut down the mayo to about a fourth of a cup and added a splash of milk to thin out. Added a large handful of shredded cheddar cheese(because cheese makes every recipe better, right?) I cut down the dill and garlic salt to about a half a tsp and didn’t add salt at all. Like others have suggested make the sauce to taste before you mix it with the veggies and noodles.

I just made this recipe and thought it turned out great--and I didn't even have any cucumbers.  I was eager to make this salad so I just used what I had.  This is a great base recipe with an infinite number of possibilities.    MADE A DOUBLE BATCH:  (By the way, 2 c. of veggie spiral pasta turned out to be 1/2 of a 12 oz. box).  I used the entire box.  Since no cucumbers on hand, used chopped celery, tomatoes, and thinly sliced carrots and radishes; and of course, olives and red onion.  I doubled most everything, but made the following adjustments:  Used 2 tsp. of dry dill weed (didn't want to overdo it, can always add more later if needed), used 1/2 tsp. salt  (for double batch),  used 1/8 tsp. of garlic POWDER.  Did not use garlic salt, and I always go easy with garlic powder.  After mixing the dressing with everything I loosed it up with 3 Tbs. of olive juice.  Perfect!  TIP:  Always save a little olive juice when draining, it has been just the right touch for many a batch of potato or pasta salad in my time--pickle juice too.  I think it tastes great now; can't wait to see what it will taste like at dinner.  I'm glad I didn't let the several "so-so" reviews deter me from trying.  Great recipe.  Other possible add-ins could be:  Shrimp, chicken, bacon or ham;  peas, bell pepper, cheese or eggs; cilantro, lemon juice, vinegar, or red pepper flakes.  Give this recipe a try.  The dressing alone would be a fantastic dip for veggies and/or chips.

Recipe Group Selection:  16, March 2013 ~ My family loves cold pasta salad, with any type of dressing.  I had high hopes for this one, as we really enjoy cucumbers.  I did omit the olives as we don’t care for them, and I had very small English cucumbers, so I just sliced them thin and left the skins on.  The dressing was pretty thick and it soaked up quickly in pasta.  We only waited about an hour to eat this once made.  The family liked it the night we ate it, but we had to add additional dressing to the leftovers as it was a little dry.  Not bad, and I will try it again.  Might add a little vinegar to thin the dressing a bit.

Made this for Recipe Group...This was just ok for us. I really feel that there is something missing, but not sure what. Also, I made this earlier in the day, and by time dinner rolled around, it was a bit on the dry side. Only 1 out of 3 kids ate this, and hubby said it needed more flavor...I agree. This was nice to try for something different, and I may play around w/ it a bit to suit my family's tastes. Thanks for sharing. :)

I made this for Recipe Group. I forgot to salt my pasta as it cooked and am very glad I made that mistake as this was a little salty for my taste. Next time, I will use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. As the submitter suggested, I used light mayo and light sour cream. I also omitted the olives because I don't care for them. Because the volume was less, I sparingly added the dressing and am glad I did. This is a good basic recipe to which more veggies like carrots and green peppers could be added.

Made for recipe group. Very tasty, creamy and a keeper. The olives did the trick for me. I wouldn't change a thing. I would double for bringing to a picnic. I did use fresh dill as it didn't say so I assumed. Overall Refreshing.
