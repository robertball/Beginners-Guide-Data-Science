These were good. I did end up needing more breading than the recipe called for but it probably depends on how big your zucchini are. I made a similar recipe to this but it called for baking the sticks  instead of frying and I gotta say this recipe was far better.  Ranch works nice as a dipping sauce but pizza sauce is good too.
