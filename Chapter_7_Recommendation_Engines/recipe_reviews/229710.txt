Delicious – light, summery, lots of compliments. I’m sure the Lucky Leaf Lemon Pie Filling is very good, but I chose to use a good lemon curd instead.  Still, a couple of minor criticisms or, let’s say, suggestions for the future in the event I make this again.  The crust could use a little sugar and even a pinch of salt. Real whipped cream instead of “frozen whipped dessert topping” would make this even better.  The bottom line?  If you need a quick and easy dessert that’s sure to please, this is a good choice. Note: I made another pan of this the following day, this time adding a little powdered sugar and a pinch of salt.  If you do this bake the crust for a shorter period of time as the included sugar definitely made this brown faster! I did prefer the taste better, however, prepared with a bit of sugar.
