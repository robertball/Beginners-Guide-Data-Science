Yum! I'm not a big curry fan, but this was awesome! Great flavor combinations- very smooth texture- we had it as a side with enchiladas and rice, but I was envisioning many other ways to eat it- it'd be a great dip for quesadillas if you mashed it, great on chips, awesome on hot rice.... Thanks!!!

I was hesitant in trying this because I'm not a big curry fan, but I love the rest of the ingredients. I made exactly as the recipe says and it tasted just as I thought it would, too much curry. With this said, I would like to add, it is definatly worth trying, but next time I make it I will cut back on the curry to 1/4 tsp. I put some on garlic flatbread with turkey, lettuce, tomato and sprouts which helped the curry taste. thank you so much for a light and refreshing summertime treat.

Flavorful, but I thought it needed some salt.

Delicious! The combination of flavors was absolutely wonderful. The amount of curry was perfect for me. The only change I made was to use 2 green onions instead of the red onion. A very unique and healthy recipe - perfect for mango season!

It was a smash hit. Used both as a salad and with 2 types of tortilla chips - one type with a int of jalapeno and one type with lime! Scaled it up to serve 10 and layered ingredients rather than tossing. Added lime juice at end. Used proportional with slightly less curry.

Made this as a side with tamales and enchiladas for dinner. It was a nice replacement for guacamole. I did add flaked salt and fresh cracked pepper to just season it a bit more, but think it would be fine without.
