In a word...FANTASTIC! I pounded the chicken thin and seasoned it with salt and pepper,used a flat bread and my indoor grill. Many flavors but nothing overpowers anything else. This will be a regular in my house.

The whole family loved it.  We grilled the chicken, sliced it up and used chibata bread in a panini maker.  We also added tomato in place of letuce and added black Forrest ham.  Delicious.

Really yummy! I grilled the chicken breasts and melted the mozzarella on top of them--on the grill. Then, I put together the sandwiches. Thanks for the recipe. Great way to use the pesto I had left over from pasta.

Really good. I used my frozen pesto with ranch dressing (I didn't have caesar) and shredded mozarella cheese all on focaccia bread from my bread machine. Yummo! Perfect summer dinner.

I used an already prepared basil pesto and these were really good! Very flavorful and easy to put together. I did marinate my chicken in ceasar dressing (regular, not creamy), prior to cooking them quickly on the george foreman grill.

Tried this the other night! Loved it, but I did make a few changes.. I didn't see the need for that 3rd piece of bread so I just used two slices of potato bread. Potato bread works great for paninis and is 99% fat free! I pounded the chicken breasts very thin, put a little bit of olive oil, dried oregano, and garlic salt on them. I grilled them on my panini press and then assembled with the dressings and cheese along with lettuce and sliced tomato; Then grilled for about 4 mins! Definitely making this again and again!!

I really liked this sandwich. My family was super excited to make the pesto. We recommend you use 1/4 tablespoon pepper in the pesto. Super delish!!!!!!

First of all need to substitute the lettuce.  Iceberg lettuce: nothing good about it, no nutritional value and full of parasites, probably the reason it is so cheap. Romaine is the way to go. It is a great lunch. Gave it a four because of the bad lettuce used.

pounded chicken to thin uniform shape. Marinated in Lawry's Herb and White Wine Marinade for a couple of hours.  Grilled. Used smoked provolone cheese and romaine  lettuce.  Brushed outside of bread with melted no salt butter. Assembled sandwich then under broiler till brown, then did the other side. Tasted great.

My husband and I were looking for nice and different sandwich/panini recipes. We love this and make it quite often. I did not change a thing. Followed the recipe to a t except when I grilled my chicken I flattened them and seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic powder. These will continue to be our faves!!

Great sandwich! Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe. The pesto is so good! I used the Creamy Italian Dressing I from allrecipes.com because it is what I had on hand and I love it! I also used american cheese as I had it on hand, and I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before grilling, and I buttered the outside of the bread before grilling. I had to do this in a grill pan and it was still so good! Thanks again.
