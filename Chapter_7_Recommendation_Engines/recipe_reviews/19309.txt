I make this differently...in my family we call this "Sopa Seca" which  means "Dry Soup".  I use the medium sized shell noodles, margarine, tomato sauce, water and cheddar cheese.  You melt some margarine or butter in a skillet, when it's hot you add the dry uncooked shell noodles and brown them a bit.  Then you add one can of tomato sauce to it.  Add water until the noodles are covered.  Cover the skillet and simmer, stirring occassionally and adding water when/if necessary.  Once the noodles are cooked, turn the stove off, cover the noodles with cheddar cheese, put the lid back on to melt the cheese then serve.  It is not soupy, it is not dry.  It does have a good semi strong tomato taste because the pasta absorbs the tomato sauce/water mixture, but we like it a lot.

this is a simple comfort dish.  used to have to make back in the day when grocery money ran low.  not a gourmet dish, nor is it something to eat often, but still straight up good comfort food.  thanks for the post amy!

A little bit different taste. Made it with cheddar instead of American. The picky husband devoured it, which was a plus!

I used a little over half of a cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese instead of the american cheese as I do not buy that cheese. I used Healthy Request tomato soup and I added a little fresh ground pepper. Even so, huge hit with the kiddos and I loved it because it was an easy lunch for the boys both to prepare and to clean up! Thank goodness for tomato soup and whole wheat pasta!

I ended up with my grandbabies on a week day night and was wondering what I was going to fix for lunch since I hadn't been to the store and didn't have much in the house that they liked.  I made this and they loved it.  It was fast and easy and better than taking them out for fast food.  I did add a few other spices but I usually do that with most recipes that I find here on AR to our preference.  As far as most kids I know they prefer simpler recipes to the more refined taste of adults.  Thanks for the post!

Great for a busy day. The first time I had to make a few small changes - I was out of shells or macaroni so I used the pasta out of 3 boxes of mac'n'cheese. I also used the powdered cheese mix and combined it with the tomato soup. The second time I made it I followed the directions exactly. It was even better! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was good and easy as heck to make. I used cheddar jack shredded cheese plus one slice of american and then I added garlic, salt, and pepper. Finally to serve I lightly sprinkled some shredded cheese on top. My son and I both enjoyed it.

My family makes this except we use 1/4 lb of COOPER SHARP cheese instead of American. Be sure to use COOPER brand. Other brands, like Cracker Barrel, change the taste significantly.

this is a great recipe when your hungry but low on cash or ingredients!  i use elbow noodles instead of shells, the texture is better to me than the shells.  also i only use 1 piece of cheese because i like more of the tomatoe taste than the sliced cheese taste.  i try to keep all these ingredients on hand for a lazy day that i dont feel like cooking.  the taste is very similar to that of Spagghetti-Os, very good!

These were just really bad.  I buy the heart healthy tomato soup.  This tasted like spaghetti o's and the tin can.

Other than adding ground beef and a 1/4 can of water to the sauce I followed the recipe.   It's quick, cheap, and makes a lot. It's certainly better than boxed pasta meals and allows you to choose how healthy or not you want to make it. I used Multigrain pasta and light cheddar cheese and lean ground beef (fried and drained).

Very kid friendly meal. A bit bland for me though and it really needed something. I added a hefty pinch of cayenne and it was sooo much better after that. There was just barely enough sauce to cover each noodle. This reminded me of the FrancoAmerican canned spaghetti I loved as a child. As an adult I'm not too impressed but it is filling but I'd fix this again for a bare pantry day before payday meal. This has lots of room for personalization and is a good starting off point. Thanks Amy, this was a nice lunch overall and brought back good childhood memories.

While I did not mind the tomato flavor as some people did, I thought this was way too dry and I will not be making it again.  Adding the milk to the reheated leftovers did not help.

I have to say I couldn't really eat this, but that's probably because I'm not a big fan of American cheese.  I might try it again sometime with a different cheese, maybe mozzarella.  However, this was indeed a good recipe for picky eaters; my boyfriend thought it was awesome.  Even if I can't appreciate it all the simple eaters out there definitely will.  Thanks for sharing.

I added a couple extra slices of cheese, but there was still too much tomato flavor. But for a quick lunch, this isn't a bad idea.

I usually love cheesy dishes, but I did not care for this one... I added extra cheese and doubled the amount of pasta, but the tomato taste was just too overwhelming... my husband, who usually finishes off everything, did not want seconds... if I try it again, I will probably use a different soup as my base...

It was a nice different flavor.  It was quick and easy to make.  It was a nice changed on a cool Fall day.  The men of the house thought it was OK, but the women of the house liked it and ate two helpings of it.  The kids didn't ask about the different taste (tomato soup), and I didn't voluntarily tell them that anything was different about it.  We topped it off with a little cheddar cheese.  I didn't have big shells on hand, just small ones.  10 ounces of the small shells is WAAAY too much because we only used half of it, so the other half I have leftover to make another time.

All our kids, even the picky eaters, loved this! Not a single noodle leftover. We didn't have American, so we used cheddar instead. It was pure comfort food and very affordable.

I loved this but I wouldn't eat it too often. It's more of a "sit down and watch a movie/ watch hour after hour if Netflix" even though I would prefer just popcorn myself. My little sister and her friend devoured it. Overall easy and delicious!

Was good fast simple recipe I did use velveta cheese cause that is what the hubby likes. I gave it a four due to cheese change not sure it would be as creamy and smooth with basic american slices.
