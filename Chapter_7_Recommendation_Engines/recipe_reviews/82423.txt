very good! Instead of cooking the onion and garlic in the butter I used raw bacon and diced it up and used the fat from the bacon to sautee. It makes the smoky bacon taste stronger than adding it at the end!

I really enjoyed this soup, but my husband didn't. I substituted bacon with sausage and next time I make it I will add potatoes- it really needed potatoes.

This was okay.  I have had this at Curly's Pub in Green Bay Wi.  I thought I would try my hand at this though a bit dissapointed on how it turned out.  I will be trying this again to perfect it further.  I went my the recommondations and very happy I did. Few things I will be changing is the amount of beer I dobbled recipie and two cups of beer was way to mcuh.  Also This needs to be much thicker.  A fun topping is Wisconsin Cheese Curds broiled slightly.

Good soup easy but it lacked something it was flat. So I added 1 tablespoon of paprika and 2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes.It was a hit. I was making it for my grandsons and their friends for a football guys night, there was none left.

This was good.  Nothing special at all, it was a typical cheese soup. It was a nice meal for a cold day. I took the advice of another reviewer and added potatoes, and I was glad I did.  It would have been too bland without them.  I also think I might use a more full bodied beer next time.  I used a light beer and I could hardly taste it.
