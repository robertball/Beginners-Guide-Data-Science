These are extremely simple to make, and I can also confirm that Splenda does work well if you’re looking for a healthy option.  The trick to making these best is to keep the size small.  The first batch I made the drops were about a table spoon in size and they got hollow with a gummy center.  My second attempt I used almost level teaspoon size drops and they were truly amazing.  When they come out bite sized they just melt in you mouth.  I also agree that there is no need for more then 45 minutes of cool down time in the oven after cooking.

Awesome! Can't believe these cookies are so low fat. I made 24 good size ones instead of 40 small drops. They were amazing! Will make again for sure 'cause I'm addicted...For weight watchers people, the whole recipe is only 12.5 pts and they are so sweet that you can even make it without chocolate chips and that would be only 8.5 pts total!!!

The first time I made these cookies, I think I might have overbeaten the eggs because the cookies which were baking on the lower rack of the oven kind of collapsed in on themselves in the middles...even so, they were incredibly yummy :).  I made a second batch today and before I started beating the eggs, I added a few drops of lemon juice (I heard that a little acidity can help the eggs keep their shape when whipped).  This time the cookies baked perfectly - looked just as good as I knew they tasted!

I GIVE UP!!  I've tried to make these cookies three times now and each time they've turned out horrible.  I beat the hell out of the eggs (pardon my french), I tried adding cream of tartar and salt, I tried real eggs and fake egg whites - all to no avail.  Please help me, I want a 22 calorie cookie!!!

Great Recipe!  Just a hint: I have discovered that this recipe turns out better on low humidity days, rather on days with a higher humidity and/or rain.

Yum!  It's almost impossible to believe that these cookies are low fat because they taste soooooo good!  I made 13 bigger cookies and put them all on one sheet only about two cm apart, baked them for the hour and then let them lit in the oven for about 30 minutes, and they're perfect!  The outside is nice and crunchy and the inside is soft and sticky (but not under cooked), but then once ya start chewing it, the outside melts in your mouth and the inside is wonderfully chewy.  When the cookie's nearly gone, it actually tastes like a chewy brownie!  I've already eaten three of the cookies and these are a repeat for sure!  So easy to make, so good, so good for you...  I think I might also experiment with leaving out the cocoa (though it was excellent) and adding cinnamon chips instead of chocolate.

loved this recipe.  I'm a WW member, and this is a treat worth sharing with
other members.  I did alter the recipe a bit after reading other reviewes.  I baked them for 45 minutes, added 1/4 teasp. cream of tartar, and sifted the cocoa powder (this gave the cookie mix a better consistancy).

I love these cookies!  I followed another rater's suggestion and used dark chocolate chips; I also added ½ tsp of crème of tartar just to be sure I obtained nice peaks.  This is the best chocolate meringue recipe that I've ever used.  Yummy!!!  Tastes great and it's low in fat-high in anti-oxidants!  Such a nice treat to have around!

Easy and delicious.  I used 1 cup of chocolate bits, because 1/2 cup did not seem to be enough.  I also only left them in the oven for about 45 minutes after baking instead of 2 hours and they were fine.

My mom used to makes these when I was a little girl. She called them angel clouds, and she omitted the cocoa powder.  Here is a tip.  Make these at night, and when they are done, turn off the oven and let them sit in the oven over night.  The next morning the centers will be perfect.  Awesome with a cup of coffee.

I followed the recipe exactly, but it all went runny when I added the cocoa. I then had to beat 2 more whites up and fold it into the mixture to make it firm again. The taste was nice,but VERY rich and VERY sweet - and I love sweet things!

Extremely easy to make and does not require major ingredients. These are usually staple ingredients in any home. This was the first time I made them and they came out great. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup of splenda since I was adding sugar free chocolate chips.I omitted the cocoa powder cause it contains 3 carbs. Being on a low carb diet, these I will make more in the future ! Also, I did not follow the directions and put the meringues on a pyrex glass and a metal pan to see what would heppen. Well, they stuck to the pan! So, use the parchment paper or foil like the directions say! LOL. But despite it being a crumbled mess, it was still great!

Wow.. just made these and they are already almost gone! These will definitely satisfy a chocolate craving. I used room temperature eggs and only added 1/8 tsp. cream of tartar and only 45 minutes of drying time and they were perfect. Definitely will make these again soon!

Wonderful!  I lost the recipe I had for making meringue cookies and found this one on this site and gave it a try.  They turned out wonderfully.  The only change I made was adding a little cream of tartar to the egg whites to help stabilize them.  I always add a little cream of tartar when I'm beating egg whites to stiff peaks.  My old recipe had choc. chips in it but not cocoa powder.  I LOVE the addition of cocoa powder!  The only downside is having to wait 3 hours for these to bake.  :-)  One tip: go ahead and make a double batch!  One more tip:  I must have made mine too big I got no where near as many cookies as the recipe called for.

YUMMY! 

I can't stop eating them! 
It was my first attempt at meringues, and even though my whites didnt form the stiff peaks like they should have, they turned out just fine! REALLY chocolatey and good. I might make them again, but might opt for either the chocochips or the cocoa powder-not both. Mmmm so good.

I made a mess all over my floor with meringue crumbs :). Yum!

These cookies are the best. I had friends asking me for the recipe because of its lightness and taste. Wow I couldn't ask for a better cookie that is low in fat. My son just loves them. No sooner do I take them out of the oven that they are gone.

I just made 2 batches of these for a cookie swap.  1st batch - eggs were cold and I didn't add cream of tartar at first.  The eggs would not form hard peaks.  Half way through mixing with the sugar already added, I added 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar.  This helped dramatically.  Second batch, brought eggs to room temp before starting and added the cream of tartar at the begining, amazing time saver.  Batter formed peaks beautifully and quickly.  Didn't add cocoa, just mini chips.  they turned out great. These are a blast from the past for me.  Thanks mom.

I made these exactly according to directions and they came out delicious.  I was looking for a low fat/low cal chocolate fix and this fit the bill.  I even used splenda in place of regular sugar and they are very tasty.

I used this recipe omitting the cocoa powder.  Word to the wise: make sure all the utensils/cookware are clean and grease-free, otherwise your eggs won't reach the right consistency.  I even wiped all of the stuff with a little vinegar beforehand to make sure there was no grease.  Also, if you can't handle too much sugar, I'd cut the sugar just a bit as it was a smidge too sweet for my taste.

These were a hit with everyone when I made them for a friend who must maintain a gluten-free diet. We even made a "cookie cake" with this recipe for her wedding!

Ok I'm not sure what I did wrong. I made them following the recipe except only left them in the over for 1 hour instead of 2. they taste pretty good but the top and middle separated and the top is like a brittle layer that crumbles when you touch it. any ideas what went wrong and how to fix it?

Delicious! I made them without the chocolate chips, doubled the recipe and still only got 40 meringues. They are soooo good!!

Classic meringue recipe. I also added cream of tartar to stabilize. My one quibble with this recipe as written is that it only makes ~20 very small cookies, not 40. I have made this several different ways and my favourite is with almond extract instead of vanilla and topped with a couple of sliced almonds and a bit of powdered sugar. Yummy!

I tried this recipe and I found it pretty easy considering it was my first time making meringue. The drops came out pretty tasty, I'm just wondering what type of cocoa and chips were used?? I used Nestle Toll House for both. I liked it it's just that the inside just wasn't what was described or expected.

These were absolutely delicious! I'm not sure if I made them perfectly since they were still a little chewy (I was impatient and didn't let them cool long enough). 

The flavor was still great, though. I made them last night and they're all gone now. I can't wait to make them again!

I am on a high protein/low carb diet and these are perfect...practically zero carbs in the whole recipe.  I miss my sugary treats - these are a great alternative using Splenda and omitting the chocolate chips.

The texture and taste are fabulous!! Very airy, chocolatey. I did have to double the recipe because 2 egg whites doesn't make very many cookies. I used mini chocolate chips. Thank you for the great recipe!

Wow! I was really impressed with the quick preperation time but a little disappointed about the long cooking time (I just couldnt wait to eat them). I am not much of a fan of low fat cooking because it always seems like something is missing. But these are PERFECT! I can not believe these are low fat! They taste like heaven! And One things for sure- the lower fat they are, the more cookies I can eat! Yum!

Wow!  These are AMAZING.  I've made these kinds of meringues since i was about 8 years old, but i never put cocoa powder in them.  They are so chocolatey and delicious.  I only give the recipe a 4 because i made some changes, otherwise it would be a 5.  I don't have a large oven, so i didn't leave the cookies in after baking for the alotted time (i needed to get the next batch in).  This made them much chewier compared to the last batch that i let sit in the oven after being baked which were much more like a crunchy cookie.  i prefer the chewy version.  i also only put in 2.5 tablespoons of cocoa powder.  I will definitely make this again for myself to have as a chocolate fix as well as for company.

This recipe was very easy and fun to make. I had a lot of egg whites from another recipe, so I multiplied this by four and it worked out perfectly. I haven't stopped eating these since I made them!! Thanks again!

What decadent bliss!!  These yielded an excellent product and were VERY easy.  I used 3/4 cup mini morsels, and reduced the cocoa to 2 TBS.  I, too, only left the cookies in the oven for 45 mins. after baking.  These are great....and the fact that they're low-cal makes them all the more appealing.  I would've liked 'em anyway, but as a gluten intolerant person, these are now in my top ten picks.  Thanks to S.N. Noble!!

Very simple recipe.  I had everything already here and on hand.  I baked them for an hour and then took them out of the oven 
after 30 min's.  They were chewy and warm.  My boys loved them!

These are like clouds and chocolate had little chocolate cloud babies we can eat!  Sooooooo good!

I followed the recipe exactly and used dark chocolate chips.  I have a stand mixer and used egg whites at room temperature. Popped them in the oven, turned off the oven after an hour and just walked away and left them overight.  3 words, Best. Breakfast. EVER!  (we didn't become working bill paying adults to NOT occasionally eat cookies for breakfast)

These are tasty little meringues. We've made them before and they were great. Whoever said they worked with Splenda must have done something different than me because mine didn't work out very well with it. The batter lost its fullness and only made about 34 drop- bite- tiny- size cookies, and also had a little aftertaste. They work much better with real sugar; a real melt- in- your mouth delight!

the flavor is great. however, i did as a reviewer suggested and used splenda. my meringues fell (i've made meringues from different recipes a number of times before and never once had that problem) and, from what i can find on the internet, meringues often fall because the sugar isn't properly incorporated - so i'm assuming it was the splenda.
EDIT- made them again and they came out fine with regular sugar. also, if anyone has problems like TXCUTIE920, humidity can be an issue when making meringues. if it is raining or humid, baking meringue(s) may collapse. if the problem is in getting the whites stiff, any trace of water in the bowl or traces of yolk from separating the eggs can prevent the whites from stiffening adequately. supposedly pasteurized whites (the carton kind) aren't suitable for meringue (or so says the package on mine), but they whipped up just fine for me - slightly less stiff than normal whites but not so much so that it was a problem. oh, and, if you're not using an electric mixer of some kind, that might be the problem. i can't imagine whipping whites by hand the way my mixer does on maximum speed.

I am a total chocoholic and was skeptical at first but I wanted something for a little after-dinner sweet...this totally fit the bill! Mine were borderline chewy on the inside, definitely better the next day. Will add these to my recipe book, yum!

This was incredibly simple and delicious.  i didn't use cocoa powder though because i didn't have any.  i added about 1/2 cup of chopped strawberries to the batter and when they baked with the meringue they sort of turned into jam which was delicious.

I used splenda in place of sugar (as I do in all my baking), didnt add the choc chips (to make healthier and less sugar) and I still thought they were very good! Will make again!

Very good recipe, I substituted splenda for half of the sugar and they're still good.   They are very choclatey so I probably could have used half as many chocolate chips.

These were SO GOOD!! I didn't have cocoa powder on hand so I omitted it, but it didn't ruin the taste at all. They weren't too sweet, just perfect.  I am sharing this recipe with everyone I knowm as everyone that has tried then has thought they were bought...Even my hubby "stole" a bag of them to take into his home office. And he doesnt usually eat sweets.

They were really easy to make but I find them too chocalaty - I used Hershies cocoa and it made them a bit too strong, not sweet enough...maybe I'll use less next time.  Also, I left them in the oven for 40 mins and they aren't at all chewy, they are only crispy. Anyway, I would try it again!

Sooo delicious and easy!  I do add a little Cream of Tartar to help with the meringue part of it and I left out the coco powder.  Kids and adults love, and I like that they are slightly healthier than some other cookies out there. Definitely try this!

This was my first time ever making meringue and they turned out better than I was expecting.  I also made two dozen larger ones rather than 40 smaller portions with no adjustment to the time.  They have a really nice flavor but I'm not sure about the texture yet.  I have never had them before so it might be something I grow to love.

This recipe is very simple and easy to make!  I did follow the suggestions from others: I used 1/4 tsp cream of tartar, sifted the cocoa, baked for 45 mins and left them in the oven after it was turned off for only 45 mins.  They came out perfect!  I love to bake, but this was my first time making meringues and I will definitely be making this recipe again!

These are truly wonderful cookies. Another tip to improve the "stiffness" of your egg whites is to ensure that they are at room temperature before you beat them. I separate the eggs then leave the whites in a bowl on the counter for 30-45 min. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good. For the first batch: I let the egg whites sit out and come to room temperature; used Ghirardelli baking chips (chopped up because they are bigger than Nestle's choc chips) and started eating them after 1 hour of cooling. Second batch: put the eggs in a bowl of hot water for 5 minutes before separating to warm them; substituted chopped walnuts for the choc chips. Got about 30 cookies out of the first batch, about 25 out of the second. Will definitely make these again.

All 3 of us agree that the chocolate flavor in these is overwhelming. I rather have the original meringues with a hint of lemon. These did have that melt in your mouth consistency and were easy to do. 45 minutes in the oven after turning it off worked fine like most people have said. Using a piping bag with a flower tip will make these look pretty but I just dropped them by teaspoonfulls on the pan (see my pic). Over all, too much chocolate flavor. Won't make again.

My family sort of ruined these cookies as I wasn't in the house when the oven timer went off, so istead of letting these sit, they took them out of the oven and let them cool. They were cooled when I came back in, and ended up kind of stick to your teeth chewy, but with a good flavor. I didn't add the chocolate chips, and the chocolate flavor was still good. I might try these again with some coffee crystals added in, and make sure I'm around to let these set up right.

Delicious!  Made about 4 batches and the 4th one didn’t turn out for some reason.  It was flat and runny. 

They are low in weight watchers points so that’s a bonus!

These cookies are amazing!!  I make double batches every time now (double ovens) because they disappear quickly.  
I've used mini chocolate chips, and I've used Andes mint baking chips.
My mother is hooked on them.  She says it's like biting down on chocolate air.

Great rich chocolatey flavor, easy to make. Made about 12 big cookies. 1 hour bake and then 30 min sitting in oven after turned off. They were not "done" in the center in true meringue style but they tasted wonderful and disappeared. Mini chips would work better but regular ones still melt even though they start out bulky. Will cut the amount of sugar next time maybe.

Ooh, are these good!  I am gluten free and on a perpetual diet, so these are *perfect* for me!  I got a brilliant idea and tried a batch with powdered peanut butter instead of cocoa.  Learn from my fail: don't bother! It deflated a beautiful batch of meringue into brown peanut-egg goo.  The cocoa batches, on the other hand, have always turned out.  These same cookies sell for $6 at the local grocery store.  I feel pretty nifty when I make my own fresh ones at home.

Flavor gets 5 stars with its cocoa goodness.  But they crumble when you bite into them - so 4 stars overall.  Easy and they store well.

This also works very well with powdered egg whites.  Found a can of powdered egg whites in the markdown @ grocery store so decided to try it.  I also used powdered sugar rather than granulated.  Next time I will try it with half sugar sub and half sugar.

I remember my mom making these cookies when I was a little girl!! They are my all time favorite!! Wonderful recipe very easy to follow. They came out just like I remembered. I left out the coco because my mom never used it and I added a little more vanilla and some extra chocolate chips. I can't stop eating them!! Good thing they are low fat :)

My first time making meringue cookies and these turned out awful! I gave them three stars because it was probably something I did. Instead of sugar I used five splenda packets. They didn't turn out nearly sweet enough. I also used 2T dark chocolate powder for an extra kick. Bad idea. Also, as soon as I blended in the powder, the whites turned soupy. Baked them anyways, in a muffin pan. After the hour, they were really crispy and tasted like bland chocolate crackers.
