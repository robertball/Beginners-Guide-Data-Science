okay, I just had to come write a review. This is one of the first recipes I printed off of here when I joined in 2003.  Well, it is by far the one I have used/made/shared most often.  It is DELICIOUS!!  I get requests from my family members all of the time.  I follow the directions exactly and always put it in a bread bowl.  Yummo!  Today will be my 6th New Year's Eve that I make it - it is a tradition.  The only thing I modify is the amount of Old Bay - some people don't like it that strong (I do) - so I use slightly less.  
You have to make this!!!  I'll try to remember to take a picture today and upload it.  

P.S. - I transfer the mixture to my bread bowl, wrap in foil, and bake for at LEAST 30-45 minutes.  Perfect! Just take to your gathering in the foil, unwrap and ta-dah!

As a Marylander I can vouch for it's authencicity!  One thing I found is that it was too salty with 3 TBSP of Mcormick's Old Bay seasoning (it may not be with other brands) I took it down to a little less than 1 TBSP and it was perfect, absolutely delicious.  I've found some of the restaraunt brand seafood seasoning to be better than Old Bay, (less salty) I'll have to try that next time!

I love this recipe. It is true Maryland Crab Dip to me. I messed up and added more cheese than it called for but it turned out to be so delicious, I have continued adding more cheese. I use 1 bag of shredded cheeses...a blend instead of just cheddar. I usually use the 4 cheese shredded bag. Everyone loves this dip so much, I have given out the recipe at least a dozen times.

A real taste of Balmer hon! (That's Baltimore for those who aren't from Maryland.) I was shocked at how many crab recipes on here don't have Old Bay as an ingredient. Living most of my life in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, I would have sworn that making crab without Old Bay was illegal. ;) I did put only one dash of hot sauce though, and I used a Mexican blend cheese because that's what I had on hand. I used this to make crab pretzels along with the "Buttery Soft Pretzels" recipe also from this site. For those not from this area, a crab pretzel is a soft pretzel with crab dip spread on top. Everyone loved them.

My boyfriend and I visited Maryland for Spring Break and ate crab dip at nearly every meal.  After returning to KY we missed it so much we were determined to find a similar recipe.  This one is dead on.  We make it all the time and if pressed have even used fake crab.  This recipe is wonderful!!! Serve on slices of italian bread.

Made this last night to bring to a party and it was very tasty! It was also VERY rich! I sliced a baguette of french bread and brushed some garlic infused oil on it before putting it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to toast. We spooned the crab dip on the toasted slices and it was yummy! Next time I make this, I want to try serving it in mini puff pastry shells. I think it would also be good stirred into some penne pasta. So many possibilities!

This was ok. It was good but not exciting. I think next time I will try it with Parmesan instead of the cheddar. I added a can on small shrimp also.

This recipe was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner.  I did tweak it a bit so that I could use all of my crab and I didn't have more than a tsp.  of old bay left.  I used about a 1 pd of crab (mixed jumbo lump can and philips fresh back fin)  To offset the extra crab I added another 4 oz of cream cheese and doubled the mayo and hot sauce.  Everything else I kept the same except I did add about a Tbsp of minced onion.  The flavor will vary depending on what type of crab you are using.    I like the backfin because it has a nice strong crab flavor.  It all depends on what type of crab you like.  If you wouldn't want to eat it plain, don't put it in the dip.

As a Marylander, I have tried many crab dip recipes and this one by far is the best---just the perfect amount of cheese, lemon and Old Bay.  My family and friends thank you for sharing your recipe!

Very good traditional Maryland crab dip.  I recommend adding the old bay a little at a time and tasting as you go.  Old bay can get very salty quickly.  I used the shredded cheese blend that has cream cheese in it!  Served with toasted bread, yummy!

This was really good, but I added 2 tsp dry sherry, and I think that's a big part of what made it so good.

I'll be making this for a Thanksgiving appetizer for the fifth year in a row this year. Our hosts always ask me to bring the Crab Dip. The first year I made the recipe as written, now I sort of taste and tinker to fit my individual tastes as I put it together, but the recipe is excellent just as it is. I like to put it together the night before and chill, and then cook it before serving, I think this helps the flavors balance and come together.

This is the real deal!  After moving from the Midwest to Baltimore, my family wanted to know what all the fuss was about over this crab dip, and I managed to find this recipe to prepare for them over the holidays.  They loved it!  I made a double and we continued to eat on it for a few days afterward; it's hearty enough to eat as a meal with warm slices of French baguette.  To please their Midwestern palates, I used less Old Bay than recommended and no hot sauce, but about 50% more cheese - less spicy than the original but still delicious!  I've already been requested to make this again, and I will gladly comply, because I love it!

This recipe is fantastic!  I am from New England but I live in Maryland and my husband's from Maryland.  When I made this for him and his family they all loved it so much, they all switched over to using this recipe from their own personal Crab Dip recipes!  They only thing I did differently was put some cheddar cheese in with the cream cheese and sour cream mixture (about 1/2 cup) and then put an additional 1/2 cup on top.  Soooo yummy!  Thank you very much Laura, this is a great recipe!

This is a really good base recipe! I mostly kept the main ingredients the same, then I got excited &  I ventured off.  I added a couple of tsps of sherry, some chives, white pepper. For the cheese I did a blend of smoked gouda, pepper jack, parmesan, cheddar, & havarti. I mixed most of the cheese in the mixture btw! I put it together on Thanksgiving Eve to let the flavors marry. The next day I sprinkled extra cheese on top & baked as an appetizer. I served it with Trader Joe's Asiago crackers. It was so good & yummy! People went back for more!  I put some extra aside & I plan to use it for stuffed mushrooms!

Since I'm born and raised in Maryland I know what crab dip should taste like.  This is the best recipe I have came across.  Just as good as from a restaurant.  I used less Old Bay though.

This crab dip is absolutely amazing.  It's, by far, the best crab dip I have ever tasted.  The only thing I "might" add would be some parmesan cheese because I love cheese.  I might also "possibly" add a tbsp. of dry sherry.  Otherwise, this dip is fine as is. I've been making it for a couple of years now, and it's always been a hit with my friends and family.  However, if you're going to make it, I suggest using lump or backfin crab, real garlic, and fresh cheese.  It costs more but it is worth it.  I would also use the entire can of crab.

I made this for a work party and it was okay.  I still have 1/2 left.  I love crab, but I even thought this was okay.  I followed the directions mostly - left out the hot sauce and used 1 tbsp of Old Bay as most people suggested.  I even cooked it for 45 minutes, because it didn't seem to set.  It was very runny.  I probably won't do this again, sorry.

This stuff was fantastic! And so easy! I didn't change a thing, but I did bring the whole recipe up to a full pound of crab, because it's silly to have four ounces of unused crab sitting around. But the proportions remained the same, and we practically inhaled the stuff! Will make again and again and bask in the compliments!

Wow! So good. Used 2tsp of Old Bay plus a sprinkle on top of cheese before baking. Made for a great  light dinner with a salad and a chardonnay. And to the last reviewer who said this was runny...let it sit for a couple minutes before eating and it is perfect.

This is THE BEST crab dip I have EVER tasted. I was born and raised in Ocran City, MD home of Greene Turtle crab dip and Adam's ribs and this is way way way WAY better then theirs!! I will add maybe another tsp of old bay but other than that it was wonderful. I made it for christmas 09 and was a huge hit!!

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  It was creamy, not too spicy, and not too fishy.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good crab dip - a little less lemon juice might help.  Can't say it was kid-friendly, but kids (although from MD), will have nothing to do with crab.  Otherwise, we really enjoyed it and will be making it again.

I love this dip! It is so easy, and it is sooo good. I didn't put quite as much old bay in the second time, and I thought it was a little better. I think I used 2 tablespoons instead of 3. It was great reheated!

I make a slightly modified version of this recipe every Thanksgiving, to rave reviews... I think it really is a Maryland thing, and for authentic crab dip, this is it... For those who would rather add other kinds of seafood, other kinds of cheese, other more fusion twists, then this isn't it... This is MD crabdip in its purest form.

I have to say I've had a lot of Crab Dip over my years, and being from Maryland and still living here I now what I love in crab dip..this one doesn't disappoint.  I made this for our Super Bowl Party and everyone LOVED it.  I have to say though, I took some liberties with the hot sauce and old bay seasoning.  I would keep adding extra to taste as I love my crab dip to be spicier. I need to taste the Old Bay in it in order to really appreciate it.

If you are looking for a GREAT Crab Dip, this does it...Thank you for posting this as it will now be a standard for any of my parties...

Very good! Neighbor from New Orleans couldn't get enough.  I did add a little sherry and doubled the cheese.  Served with Ritz baked chips and they held up well.

I live on the Chesapeake Bay, so I'm a pretty tough sell on crab dips.  I have to say though,  this one is spot on. The only thing I do differently is add extra crab (never have too much crab, lol!). Really, really good!

I used this in a mini crock pot as as an appetizer and served it with a mini french loaf. I left out the sour cream, and upped the cheddar until it became thick enough (prob. 2c). I use salt free garlic powder and low sodium Old Bay, and the amount was PERFECT, not too salty at all. This was so easy and everyone loved it. It tastes better than anything in Fell's Point! Thank you!!

Score!!! Used mozerella instead because my husband ate all the cheddar that morning, but it was still great!! Reminds me of the crab dip we had while visiting family in Maryland.

I made this for a Christmas Eve family gathering and it was the only thing to completely disappear!  People were just spooning it onto their plates without crackers or anything!  I made it as the recipe was written, except I used a full pound of crabmeat since that's what came in the can and I didn't want any leftovers.  The flavors blended really nicely and didn't overpower the crabmeat.  Will definitely be making this again.  Merry Christmas!!!

I omitted the mayo & substituted with more sour cream.  It was still wonderful!  I probably used about 1 Tbsp. of old bay in the dip and then sprinkled another teaspoon on top.  I also baked the dip in a sourdough bread bowl and served it with sourdough bread cubes.  WOW.  The bread & dip were terrific together.  This was gone in minutes.  More flavor than regular crab dips.

Read the reviews on this recipe and was very excited to try it as we love crabmeat but unfortunately I was very disappointed.  Thought it lacked flavor and the consistancy was thicker than a warm dip should be.

I didn't care for this. Not sure if I did something wrong, or if my tastes are just different from everyone else.  The only thing I did different was use half the crab meat called for.

Wonderful crab dip!  I used to live in Maryland and I have been searching for the best crab dip recipe. I tried 4 other recipes before I settled on this one and it tastes exactly like the crab dip from my favorite Maryland restaurants!  I Love it!  I followed the recipe exactly, just added a little extra cheese!  Soooo good!!!!

I made this for an open house and never got to taste it.  It was gone that fast!  I'll definitely have to double the recipe for my next party.  I did add more crab than the recipe called for because we Marylanders love our crab!

Made the recipe as stated and it was very good.  For my personal taste, next time I would cut down on both the sour cream and the Old Bay.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Although I added salmon and made slight variations to the ingredients to make it my own, this is a very great dish. I'll be cooking the dish more often. Thank you!

I am from the east coast and this is an excellent recipe. Only changes I made, was used Parmesan cheese instead of cheddar. Used only 1-1/2 tsp of Old Bay and a 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion. Not a drop left! Enjoy

I'm a real Marylander and I LOVE this  dip! It's truly the best and most authentic. I follow it exactly, except I don't measure my Old Bay- we love it and there' s no such thing as too much! I sprinkle a LOT in to start, fold it in, and taste as I go until it's how we like it. I also mix in a little more cheese into the mixture, maybe 1/4 cup or so. If you're looking for real Maryland crab dip, this is the way to go! People beg for it!

I did add a dash or two more of hot sauce, tend to like things on the spicier side. Instead of using a buttered dish to bake this in, I got a rye round, hallowed it out and stuffed the dip mixture in the bread. Wrapping the bread in aluminum, except for the top, I found the combination of the hot dip and warm bread to be sinful....

This is a great recipe! I grew up on the Chesapeake Bay and this dip personifies the dips you get in all the little Mom and Pop restaurants.  I added 1 tsp. cayenne for a little heat in the dip.

this crab dip is really good. i used a lil more mayo than sour cream, but more cream cheese could be substituted. this was to make it thicker, and less watery.  i also used claw meat because it was cheaper, and i could not tell a difference.  my whole fam likes it, so im making it for christmas.

Made with what I had, canned crabmeat, no sour cream, fresh minced garlic instead of powdered, and 1 tablespoon of Old bay instead of 3.  This turned out close to the way my mom's dip tastes.

Made with Neufchatel cheese, low-fat sour cream, and light mayonnaise - still delicious! Next time I would leave out the mayonnaise as it got a little thin. Or just add more shredded cheese!

This dip was a success, very easy to put together, the crab taste came through loud and clear.  I, like many other reviewers, would cut back on the Old Bay seasoning, that flavor came through too strongly.  If you have access to fresh crab, or the real pasteurized crab meat for those of us living outside of the Chesapeake watershed - I would suggest using part whole lump, and using the other half claw meat.  No use in going completely high brow and the claw meat is much, much cheaper.

This is great!  I took 3 tbsp Old Bay down to 1, and sprinkled some on the top as garnish.  I kept the rest the same.  This is truly delicious and I would recommend it to anyone with a taste for crab.

Could have been an awesome crab dip, minus the Old Bay. I live in FL and cook a lot of seafood and use Old Bay in most dishes, however, I thought it was way too overpowering.  Maybe cut it in half and it would have been great!

This is an amazing Crab dip! Everyone loved it at my brother in laws party. It was gone in no time!!! I had to change a few things do to not having some stuff on hand. I used imitation crab, about 14 oz almost a pack and a half. I used monterey jack cheese instead of cheddar and I used about a cup or so. I didn't have any hot sauce, so I used about a tsp of cayenne pepper. No old bay seasoning so I ground up some celery seed maybe a tsp. Ground up some bay leaves about 3, Put some ground ginger, paprika, pepper, and lots of garlic and onion powder. I didn't have mustard powder so I used a tblsp mustard. I also only used 1 tblsp lemon juice. MAN, I didn't have a lot of stuff, hehe. Well it was absolutely amazing, and everyone loved it!!! Thank you.

FAN-TAS-TIC!  I made this New Year's Eve and it was a hit.  My husband had a business trip earlier this year to Maryland and he said it tasted exactly like what he had when he was there.  Thanks so much - will make again, and again :)

Yep, it's definitely authentic Maryland style crab dip!  I bought some fresh crab at Baltimore's Lexington Market while visiting on Friday and made this dip on Saturday. I used only 2 teaspoons of Old Bay since I don't like too much spice, but it gave it just the right kick.  I baked the dip in individual ramikin dishes which was a nice presentation. Definitely keeping this one!

The only changes I made were to use imitation crab meat (and less than called for, I'm not big on seafood), horseradish sauce instead of worchestire and spicy dijon mustard instead of dry mustard.  I cooked it half the time in a casserole dish, then transferred to a hollowed out french bread loaf and cooked it for the remaining time.  My husband is from MD and he loved it!

I couldn't have asked for a better crab dip. This was such a huge hit at our post pumpkin/apple picking party yesterday that even the non dip eaters were scooping it up. I used a chive whipped cream cheese, parm instead of the cheddar and was a little shy with the Old Bay as I didn't want to overpower it with salt. As the recipe states, use fresh crab meat if you can as it makes all the difference in the world.
This will be my tried and true crab dip recipe from now on and I thank you!!

I live in MD and it is hard to find good crab dip (go figure), so I was on a quest to make crab dip the way I like it! This recipe is soooooo wonderful! of COURSE I used real crab meat. I put in more because I like it really crabby! I did take other suggetsions with the lemon juice, I only used 2 tsp. I omitted the tabasco sauce, not a fan. I did offer it on the side for my co-workers. I work for a police dept where we all dont eat donuts (smile), we all love to eat....this dish went so fast I thought someone stole it! So if you want an authentic MD Crab Dish this is it! Please use real crabmeat if it is available, no matter the cost. Note I offered this with french bread cut into wedges for easy dipping. So many people asked for the recipe. A keeper.

Served this as an app. at Thanksgiving.  It was pretty good.  I, too used the full lb. of backfin crabmeat from a chilled can and upped the other ingredients to compensate.  I served it with tortilla chips and toasted pita triangles.  I think it needed something.  I love crab, but this somehow tasted too crabby for me.  Maybe next time I’ll add some onion, more garlic, pimentos and top with some chopped tomatoes—just personal preference.  Regardless we had a lot of leftover, so I’m not the only one with this opinion.

Awesome!  This is the best base recipe for authentic crab dip I've come across so far.  I doctored it up a bit with adjusting the spices, adding additional cheddar cheese, a touch of horseradish and about 1T. minced onion.  We're big spice fans, but this recipe is still delicious and simple as is!

I love this recipe and it's a banger at parties.

Personally, I use Texas Pete, add some goat cheese, and swap the cheddar out for a quality smoked white cheddar.

Also, I recommend getting some baguettes, cutting them into slices, melting some butter and mixing in some Old Bay to drizzle over the baguette slices, then toasting them in the oven.  It's fire.

I’m a Marylander too and this is my go-to recipe! It is best with 1 lb of hand-picked fresh crab meat vs. pasteurized meat from overseas. I also pick through the meat myself to remove any shells. Then I combine the lemon juice with the meat to avoid any fishy smell. The rest is done as-is. It freezes well and tastes great with soft pretzel nuggets. You’re welcome!

This recipe is awesome! I would suggest using the full pound of crab meat but to let it drain (from the can) in a colander for 15 minutes prior to adding. Sometimes I'll even gently press with a paper towel.  This ensures that it sets up during cooking and is not too runny. Don't skip the spices...the heat from the hot sauce is what most people enjoy and rave about!

Family hit I'm not the best cook. I used 1 pound of fresh crab meat substituted sour cream for mayo and Parmesan cheese for cheddar, and used green onions and fresh garlic. I sprinkled cheddar cheese on top baked for 30 minutes and served with pita chips. Wonderful dish

Used 1 Tbsp of Old Bay and it was still too salty. Will make my own seasoning next time. Otherwise, it was a nice dip.

This is the best stuff! Crab just isn't crab without Old Bay!! Be sure to add the fresh lemon, it really brightens it up. The better the crab, the better the dip! I have made a version of this for years and warmed it all in a sauce pan and served it in a chafing dish. Baking it was nice, too, and an easy option. Thank you!!

I have fixed this 2 times and it is really good and simple to make. I used 1 TBLS. of OLD BAY then sprinkled a little on top. I also used a little more Tabasco because it was Sage and I.

Excellent.  Made for the first time on 6/2/12 for a family party, and served with fresh Italian bread.  Family loved it.  Only changes I made were 1) Used frozen snow crab ($14.99 per lb instead of fresh, which was $24.99 per lb), thawed and drained, 2) Used about 2x the lemon juice.  Big hit with the fam!  Sister wants the recipe, and I'll definitely make it again!

crab dip was very flavorful and the taste of the crab was not lost in the sauce. A little runny for my taste. The next time I make this I will use a little less sour cream and cream cheeze. Overall a great recipe!

Not the Maryland crab dip I grew up with in Southern Maryland.  Made for a party and people tried it but no one went back for more.  How embarrassing.  Please just call this crab dip.

Delicious, but turned out too soft and runny. I think mixing in all the cheddar might help the consistency.

This is the real deal Maryland crab dip, hon.  All you need is a soft pretzel and you're good to go.

As a variation, I added shrimp and cut the sour cream.  Excellent.

This recipe is fantasic.  I'm from Maryland, and it's a little piece of home now that I live in the mid-west.  I will say, 2 tablespoons of Old Bay is A LOT.  I put about a tablespoon and I thought it was great :)

Rave reviews at the Bridal shower.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Made it with imitation crab...turned out great.  Used 1 1/2 tbsp Old Bay Seasoning.....could have used a bit more.  Definitely a keeper!

I chose this recipe as one of the dips for a football party and it was pretty good.  The taste was good but a little dry; I think my mistake was putting this into a 9x13 baking dish instead of an 8x8.  Next time I will try that, as it really did taste very good and I'm more than willing to make it again.

I'm a Midwesterner who moved to Maryland a few years back. I love crab and I've made this recipe four or five times for my Maryland friends and they always rave about it. I'm still pretty faithful to the recipe, except I use real garlic, half the Worcestershire sauce, and a full pound of crab. I always go with extra sharp cheddar as well. It's super delicious. My wife is a beast of a baker and she makes fresh french bread to serve with the dip. So good!

i absolutely LOVE old bay and the old bay in this recipe is WAY too much. Based off the reviews of others, I reduced the 2 tablespoons it called for to 1.5 and it was still incredibly salty. I added a little extra sour cream and cream cheese to try to save the dip from being ruined. Despite the saltiness, I will definitely make this again but with only 1 tablespoon next time. Otherwise, I did like the recipe. I mixed all of the ingredients (reserving a little of the cheese for the top) and put it into a sourdough bread bowl. I wrapped it in foil and baked it in the oven on 325 for 20 minutes. I then added a little extra cheese and took the foil cover off the top so the cheese would melt. I put it back in the oven for another 5 minutes just to let the cheese melt. Overall, it was a huge hit at my party.  With a couple adjustments, will definitely make it again!

I have been contemplating whether or not to try this recipe for the past week, and finally went for it tonight. I have to say, I am so glad that I did!! So delicious, and so easy to make...my husband raved as well, who also had reservations about a hot crab-cheese dip. Excellent!!! I can not wait to make it for a gathering...

Had extra crab leftover from New Years, so I thought I'd try this for Rose Bowl party. Very disappointed. It was way too "crabby" tasting. Recipe shows 3/4 pound of crab, which seems excessive (is that supposed to be 3/4 pound of crab legs or just the meat?) I put about 1/2 pound of actual king crab leg meat and stopped...where I live that is one expensive dip! Perhaps I messed up using King Crab, just not for me.

This was a hit at two different parties i took it to. I put it together the day before. The am of, I moved into a bread bowl and 30 mins prior to people showing, i put it in the toaster oven on 325. i would say about 25 mins is perfect for it. I served it with townhouse crackers and the remaining bread from the inside of the bowl. It was delish!

I recently made this for a party.  It has now become one of my most requested dishes.  I added more Old Bay than the recipe states.  It gives it more flavor.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  I used backfin crab and to make enough, I used 3 blocks of cream cheese, 1 cup of sour cream and 3 tablespoons of mayo.  I also added green onion and that added a nice touch.  I brushed garlic-infused olive oil on baguette slices and put them under the broiler for a few minutes.  My measurements made plenty for 20+ people.  I love this and can't wait to make it for Christmas...

I followed the recipe pretty precisely except I did use regular mustard instead of dry mustard since that was all I had on hand, and I used imitation crab meat purchased at my seafood counter rather than fresh crab meat, as fresh crab meat is not readily available in our area of the country.  I reduced the Old Bay seasoning and it was not too salty, but I didn't care for the overpowering flavor of the Old Bay.  I thought it was okay, but my husband really enjoyed it.  Next time I will add more hot sauce since I think it could have used a bit more kick., and I will not sprinkle any Old Bay on top.  I will also add a little minced garlic and maybe an extra tablespoon of mayonnaise.  I think it would have had a somewhat better flavor with fresh crab meat, obviously, but we couldn't find any.  Overall, pretty good and will make again with some adjustments.

Very tasty and a great way to use up extra crabmeat! I cut the recipe in half for two of us and it was just the right amount. Served as an appetizer with garlic & chives pita crackers.

I make this dish all the time for potlucks and partys. It's easy to double up too. Crabmeat is pricey so I usually do half backfin and half claw. It's always a hit and rarely any leftover!

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it the only thing I did different was added a few more dashes of hot sauce and less old bay and topped off with mozzerella cheese which really browned well and served with flour tortilla's.

i made this basically according to the recipe~ although i did add cheese to the mix as well as on top (we LOVE cheese!) i put it in the toaster oven to cook and accidently broiled it for the first 15 min or so. it turned a nice brown golden color and then i ended up baking for just about 10 min. i toasted some pita and served the dip with that and some of the new triscut parmasean crackers... it was PHENOMENAL!!! everyone LOVED it! apparently this is the new fave and im making it again for a christmas eve party! thank  you!!!

Definitely cut back on the Old Bay! I used 1 TBS instead of 2 TBS and even then I was playing with fire. A few more dashes and the Old Bay would have been overkill. To be safe next time I am going to use just shy of 1TBS. Instead of 1/2 cup of cheddar I increased it to 1 cup. With these modifications this dip was DELICIOUS! It is best on crusty baguette slices brushed with oil and garlic.

This was not a favorite recipe in our house.  We thought it had way too much seasoning and I used less than called for.  Had a odd after taste.  Won't be making this again, sorry!  I love crab but this was just not the recipe I was looking for.

Wow.  I'm impressed!  There are a lot of crab dips out there that I just turn my nose up at.  Not this one!  This one is the real deal and I'm from Maryland.  The only change I made was to add a little parmesan cheese to the mixture.  I'm not talking about the shaker stuff either.  That stuff is awful.  If you're going to buy real crab, buy the real parmesan shredded cheese too.  Don't use imitation crab either...it's just not right.

I served the dip with plain bagel chips, toasted baguette slices, blue tortilla chips and Ritz crackers.  After tasting it would've been good with celery too.

This was more than enough for the small gathering that I took this to.  I used the leftovers as a topping for chicken breasts (think Chicken Chesapeake) and also added the rest to a mixture of homemade alfredo sauce for a delicious sauce served over pasta.  The possibilites are endless.

Beautiful recipe!

This recipe served as a reminder to me that everyone has their own tastes. I made this for a party and noone really liked it. People complained about the strong Old Bay Seasoning aftertaste. Apparantly we are in the minority by looking at the reviews. Maybe it's one of those recipes you love if you grow up eating it.

Love this! The only thing I changed was that I used 16 oz of crabmeat and it turned out perfect. It wasn't too rich either, as I find alot of crab dips are.

Very good. made it without mayo and without hot sauce. Replaced the Worcestershire with a 50/50 mix of Tamari and apple cider vinegar. on point! 

I am from Maryland and to those who want authentic "Maryland crab" anything all you need is: Maryland blue crab. that's it! everything else is preference!

This was great !! Definitely will try it again.
****Note: when I cook I only use this as a base.

****Revisions: 1 tsp Sriracha, 2tbsp Mayo, 4oz cream cheese,  old bay to taste, 16oz crab meat (i am a Marylander and I definitely love my crab dip with Jumbo lump crab meat(usually pick up from Sam’s club)) 
You may or may not like my revisions just fix it up where you see fit !! :)

I have been searching high and low for the perfect crab dip recipe and I think I finally found it! I live near Ocean City Maryland in crab dip is very common in the area, but finding the right recipe can be difficult. The only thing I did differently is that I added a little bit of horseradish just because I like that taste in my crab dip but it would have been fine without it. We'll definitely be keeping this one everybody loved it we had it at Christmas.

I upped all ingredients by 25% since I had a full pound of canned crab meat. This was so easy to make ahead of time and then just popped in the oven when it was time.  Left it sit to cool and thicken a little when it came out of the oven.
Served up with South Central PA local made Smittie's Soft pretzel sticks!
As good as any and better than most that I have ever had!

I am a native Marylander still living in the state. We do love our crabs and Old Bay here!  This recipe was easy.  I tripled it for a crowd, mixed it all in a bowl and put it in a crockpot to stay warm. It is as good as any crab dip I have had in an upscale restaurant!  If you want to have a taste of Maryland this is definitely a great way to do it!

I haven't made it yet.  Was going to do for a Mardi Gras Party.  Can anyone tell me if it is suitable for a small crock pot to keep it warm?  I only have a microwave at work, and thought that it would be easier to keep warm in a crock pot.  Any recommendations would be welcomed. Thanks.

I followed the recipe exactly, using 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 2 tablespoons Old Bay Seasoning. Baked for 20 minutes and served in a small crock pot with pita chips for a buffet style meal at a party. Very popular with guests, no leftovers!

Excellent! I'been using this recipe for YEARS, with 2 exceptions - add a small handful of chopped white onion and 1 tbsp sherry. I also usually bake mine in a bread bowl.

Very good. I used 1 tablespoon of Old Bay, threw half in the mixture and sprinkled the other half over the top. I think next time I'll use the same amount, but throw 3/4 in the mix, and only sprinkle a 1/4 tbls. Used claw meat crab, and it was fine. Would be interested to try it with imitation crab as well.

Oh yeah!! This dip is the bomb!! We lived in Baltimore for 10 years and then moved back to California, and I've had a hard time finding a recipe for Maryland Crab dip. I'm so excited to finally find a good one! Great on pretzel bread and I'm thinking of using some to make Chicken Chesapeake tonight! Thanks so much for the great recipe!!

This was the very first recipe I've found on All Recipes about 15 years ago and my absolute favorite!!! I've made this for years with rave reviews for Thanksgiving and various parties. I've made the recipe as is with no complaints. I've read reviews of individuals putting in three tbsp of Old Bay-the directions state to "add to taste". This may eliminate some of the saltiness some reviewers experienced. This year I'm adding some lobster to the dip, hopefully I'll have another hit!

Never had a hot crab dip before so didn't know how to compare this. Also, I'm sure it would be wonder if you had access to fresh crab, but where I'm at it isn't available or cheap for previous frozen. Made just like directions said.

Very good but a little salty... Next time I'm going cut back on the Old Bay mixed in and sprinkle more on top. I'm also going to add a little horseradish to give it  little bite.

My husband and I both love crab, and I made this to take to my mother-in-law's for Thanksgiving.  I liked it, but am not sure that we'd have it again... It wasn't quite "crabby" enough for me.  My sister-in-law's boyfriend loved it, so did my husband!

Made this for a Thanksgiving dip.  It was a good dip.  However with all the other food sitting around it was passed up.  I think because it was hard to keep it warm.  Since I had so much leftover, I decided to turn it into crab cakes.  Added chopped red bell pepper, fresh jalapenos, 1 egg, and a cup of bread crumbs.  Shaped into patties and fried.  Not your traditional crab cakes, but very good!

Awesome! Made this for the football game last night and got rave reviews! The only thing I might do is go easier on the Worcestershire sauce. I might cut it back by half a teaspoon. Other than that, delicious! Oh and I didn't have enough sour cream, so I substituted a quarter cup of plain yogurt, and I couldn't tell the difference.

The recipe came out rather runny. Had to add another can of crabmeat and extra shredded cheese and then bake another 10-15 minutes.  The taste is ok but even with 5-6 dashes hot sauce and about 3T of Old Bay. I'm gonna keep looking for the best dip recipe.  Thanks for sharing though!

I used 2 tablespoons of Old Bay & thought it was way too salty ~ others thought it was good.  I didn't think it was creamy enough, next time I would use (2) 8 oz. pkg. of cream cheese.

Very tasty but my suggestion is to go a bit lighter on the old bay (you can always add a bit on post-cooking if desired). I grew up here in Maryland and love old bay but in my opinion, this recipe is a tad heavy and those not used to the seasoning may especially find it to be overpowering. Great, quick, and easy to follow recipe, though!

I love, love, love this recipe! The only change I make when preparing it is to use more hot sauce--about 8 dashes. This dip is always a huge hit when I make it for parties--there is never even a tiny bit left. Thank you so much for sharing it Laura!

this is the same recipe I have used for years. The only thing different I do is subtract hot sauce and add paprika and parsley. If you prefer the cheesier kind of crab dip this should be your choice. As for the cheddar, I always use more when mixing up the dip because I love the cheese.

made this dip recently, all i could say is that this dip is average at best. The dip came out to be a little on the soupy or watery side. Also, the i think that 2 tablespoons of seafood seasoning is a little bit too strong for this dish, I would probably cut back a little next time. For those of you not crazy about worcestershire sauce, you can't even taste it in the dip. Also, the hot sauce gives the dip a nice little kick, which is probably the best part of this whole recipe. Overall the dip had a a decent creamy crab flavor to it, it's just one of those dishes to die for.

There aren't enough stars!!! I went to visit Ocean City, MD with my boyfriend last summer and we went to a little crab shack for dinner. We had a dip JUST like this! I made it for him and his family over Thanksgiving and they FLIPPED! Fantastic-thank you for sharing!

Excellent.  Authentic Maryland style (I'm a local).  I used reduced fat cream cheese and cheddar and it still turned out rich.  This is a keeper.

Authentic Maryland Crab Dip!  Absolutely delicious!  I also used less Old Bay and just seasoned to taste.  Probably about 1 Tablespoon.  I increased the crab meat to a full pound of jumbo lump and used a four cheese blend... YUMMY!  I made it for Christmas Eve and it was gone in a matter of minutes.  Making it again tonight for New Year's Eve!

I made this dip on Thanksgiving Day and everyone LOVED it!!! I added a few other spices to the dip, but I'm sure it would've been just a great sticking to the original recipe. This will now be one of my favorite things to make and eat. It was easy, delicious and quick to prepare. LOVED IT!!!

This was a good recipe. Next time I will add more garlic powder, worcestershire, hot sauce and Old Bay seasoning and hopefully that will improve it to 4/5 stars.

Very yummy, good with canned lump crab meat.  I used the Old Bay reduced sodium (2 tbs) and it was great, not salty at all.  Awesome with Blue Corn chips.

The best crab dip I've ever made! I made some small adjustments based on previous reviews: 1 tbsp old bay was plenty, increased cheese to 2 cups, used a few extra tablespoons sour cream, and used a full 16oz of lump crabmeat. It was a huge hit at my work party and the pan disappeared pretty quickly.  Thanks so much!

If you're from Maryland...this is the BEST crab dip ever!  I had lots of Old Bay and extra cheese!  Serve with french bread or Town house crackers.  I make it at our Annual Wine Fest in Md. and just made it again at Christmas....lots of compliments!!!

Very good.  I've made it several times and been asked for the recipe.  I think 2 tbsp of Old Bay is a little much but others seem to enjoy it.

Delicious....i added a half stick of  melted butter to the mixture, which made it very rich and yummy, and did use way less old bay and used 1 1/2 cups mozzerella instead of the cheddar and served on sliced baguettes....

I made this in the crockpot. On the way out the door to work put two cans of stew tomatoes and the beef broth in the crockpot with diced celery and diced onion and spices. Came home and dumped one can drained: corn, lima beans, string beans, carrots and peeled white potatoes which I diced. Cooked that for another 2 hours in the crock on high. Last hour dumped in Phyllips back fin one pound of crabmeat. Most expensive soup I've ever made by the best. Hubby won't shut up about it. This is the real deal and tastes EXACTLY as it does in your finer restaurants on the east coast. Thank you thank you thank you!
