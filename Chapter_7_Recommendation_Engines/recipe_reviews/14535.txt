For those of you who think this recipe is too salty, just cut down the soy sauce to 2 Tbp. and the dark soy sauce to 1 Tbp.  Normally we eat it with rice, so it is not too bad.  The measurement can be easily adjusted to suit your taste bud in this recipe, so don't be afraid to experiment with it.

Easy & delicious!  I didn't have dark soy sauce the first time I made it and it was delicious.  Made it a second time with dark soy sauce but reduced the amount and it was good.  Careful with the dark soy sauce because it's very salty.  Overall, an excellent, easy, delicious recipe.
Update 2/23/2010 - I have made this recipe more than 50 times now, both on the grill and in the oven.  Now I skip the dark soy sauce altogether because I don't think it needs it and the regular soy sauce gives it enough flavor.  I also add some sugar for a bit of sweetness and I always let it marinate overnight.  I have made this for BBQs so many times and everyone loves it!  It's a great recipe.

This was a good sauce, but I wouldn't recommend marinating for to long.  I marinated for a whole day, and it was a little overpowering.  A bit salty, but good overall.  I will use this recipe again, but will only marinate for a few hours.

It is the best chicken wings recipe I've had. I followed the recipe and it is not that salty. I also used a dark soy sauce w/ mushroom flavor, which is also really good. I think it's because of the quality of soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. If you buy the good ones from an Asian store, it won't be that salty. If you buy the ones from a regular grocery store, those soy sauce and oyster sauce are SUPER salty and the taste quality is not so good. The brands I used are: Lee Kum Kee (Oyster Sauce), Kadoya (Sesame oil), Koon Chung (Soy sauce - Hong Kong brand), Pearl River Bridge (Dark soy sauce w/ mushroom flavor)

These were delicious, full of flavor!  I added fresh garlic to the marinade as well.  My kids loved them too!  The most work was cutting up the chicken wings, but if you buy them pre-cut then it's not too much work at all.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe Ching!

Very very good.  Halfway through the cooking I brushed on some of the leftover marinade but I wouldn't do that again as it made it way too salty.  Stick with the directions and discard the leftover marinade and they will be fine.

Oh my gosh, these wings were the best.This was just what I was looking for.I used sodium reduced soya sauce and I didn't know I was out of sesame oil so I had to use some of my thai sesame dressing.I marinaded them all day then cooked them in the marinade for an hour @ 400 then a quick flash on the grill.I can't wait to make more.

We loved this dish. The basil was a great. I had marinaded it for too long so it was a bit salty. Next time I won't let it sit over night. A few hours would be prefect. I will make this again.

I reduced the amount of both soy sauce to half as suggested by others, and baked them in the oven. I also added a lot of white pepper. Mmmm, they were good!

This was a hit at my family gathering and my husband loves it.  He says it's one of his favorites now.  The recipe is a little salty but I adjusted by adding more chicken to the recipe.  I changed a few things such as adding maple syrup, chopped red onions and garlic, fresh thai basil & fresh chillies.  I also like to freeze my chicken with the sauce ahead time so I can defrost on nights when I don't have time to marinate and prep for dinner.  It actually tastes better this way because the marinade soaks into the chicken meat.  I've also used chicken thighs and tried baking it in the oven.  Awesome Recipe!  I don't know why it's not more popular on allrecipes.

Great recipe and easy to make too. I prefer it without dried basil, though. Made it at a BBQ and oh my, it flew off the plates like hot wings! :)

great recipe, but since I cook for more than two people I tripled recipe and marinated for 3 or so hrs. using the suggested lower amounts of both soy sauces. The wings were good but salty.

Because I was lazy and didn't want to go to the store, I changed this just a bit and used what was in the cupboard.  I did not use the dark soy sauce or oyster sauce.  I added a cup of water (too water down the saltiness) and I added some ground ginger.  They were GREAT...as my husband said!

I made these wings for a BBQ, everyone LOVED them, I'm having another BBQ today and I was asked to make them again. If you are finding the the soy sauce is making it to salty cut back on the dark soy sauce by 1/2tbs to a full tbs that will help alot. and dont be afraid to throw in some spices that you like yourself for it, this recipe can be very easily changed and still tastes great

This was great.  I took the advice of having only half the soy sauce and only marinating it for 2 hours.  I had no problem with saltiness.  My brother who's always fussy when it comes to chicken ate this one up and was looking for more.

We liked this recipe, but found the flavour a bit strong, which was I think due to the sesame oil, even though I put half sesame and half vegetable oil.  Would like to try making again, but without any sesame.  Just not big sesame fans, sorry!

Great recipe!  Made it several times already.  Kids and husband loved it.  Guests loved it, they couldn't get enough.  Left out the dark soy, didn't have any on hand.  Still was delicious.  This recipe is now one of my favorites.

Very good. I did make some amendments to this recipe to heighten the flavor to our liking.  I didn't have oyster sauce, so I used fish sauce instead.  I also only had 1 type of soy sauce on hand so I omitted the dark soy sauce.  I added some crushed ginger, brown sugar, and red pepper flakes also. Makes a great recipe for party wings and easy to do.

This is a good recipe. I didn`t use dark soy sauce and used 6 tablespoons light soy sauce. Next time I would probably skip oyster sauce. My wings turned out not too salty, just piquant. I baked them in the oven, but we think grill will be the perfect thing.

This recipe was a hit with everybody! Everytime I have a BBQ everybody will insist I do this BBQ wings! Simple and easy to prepare. Over time I have added ginger and fresh garlic and onion instead of powdered ones. Also I halved the soya sauce, dark soya sauce and oyster sauce.

Very good I didn't find it salty at all at. that might be because I used the sweet soy sauce Or kecap manis instead of the dark soy sauce.

This was good, but not great. I followed this recipe exact. We all thought it was a bit salty. If I were to make this again, I'd add some brown sugar to take the salt down a notch. I USED CHICKEN LEGS FOR THIS RECIPE. EIGHT WAS JUST ENOUGH.

I too used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  The wings turned out very well and I will be making them again.  Very good recipe!

These wings are delicious. Based on various reviews posted, I used half the seasoning, marinated over night and then baked it in the oven. At the time of baking I basted the wings using a mix of barbeque sauce and Franks Hot sauce. Simply Amazing :)

Easy.  Good flavor.  My husband and children (ages 5 & 7 ) liked it.  Didn't have any dark soy sauce so made without it.  
Would make it again.  It would make a great  appetizer or a dish to take to a bbq.

Used only 3 1/2 tbsp. of soy sauce. Didn’t use dark soy sauce or the oyster sauce. Served with Toasted Sesame noodle box mix from Simply Asia or similar brand. I ended up marinating for 2 days.

I followed the recipe exactly.  And we loved it!  Even the people in my family who prefer chicken breast to wings.

I'm a Beginner Cook, and this couldn't have been easier! I halved the amount of soy sauce and dark soy sauce, and it turned out superb! Everybody loved it, thanks so much!

This was just ok for me, I must admit I did change the ingredients some and maybe that's why, It's worth a shot to try and make again following the recipe. I used soy sauce, oyster sauce fresh garlic, onion powder, curry powder and ground pepper, no sesame oil or basil even though I had both, I did let it marinate overnight. I grilled over charcoal, I still felt like something was missing. I did'nt use the sesame oil because I'm not a big fan. Oh well maybe next time.

Due to some of the other comments saying it was a little bit salty, I omitted the dark soy sauce. Other than that, followed recipe. My family was amazed by the taste of this chicken. I will definitely be making this again

Made it 3 times. I'm a Malaysian but I don't really like this. It's difficult to gauge the soy sauce amount. I use a normal spoon for measuring out the first 2 batches, the meat is underseason. Use measuring spoon for my 3rd batch, the dark soy sauce made the meat taste bitter. I'm using Lee Kum kee brand soy sauce/ dark soy sauce/ oyster sauce. Would not attempt this recipe again.
