The family loved the BBQ Bison Brisket Phyllo Bites. Great flavor. A definite addition to this year's Super Bowl menu.

This was very good! It was my first time cooking with bison and I loved the hearty meat flavor! I was afraid that bison would taste gamey but was happy that it wasn't! It is just a stronger meat flavor than cow beef! I made the recipe as written except I didn't cook it for 12 hours. The meat was perfectly tender after 9 hours. And I added about 1/2 tsp of salt. I used about 3 cups of the leftover meat to make bison tacos by adding salsa, cumin, oregano and topping it with sour cream and cheddar cheese. The tacos were also very good! I still have another 2 cups of bison leftover, so I'll freeze it and use it next week to make bison pot pies! I can't wait!
