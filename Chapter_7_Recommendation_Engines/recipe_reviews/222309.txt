Hubs and I are duck fat newbies but since being introduced to it we are now duck fat aficionados.  I don't think we'll ever do roasted or fried potatoes without it again.  Because it already is available in a jarred form, I took that shortcut rather than the submitter's direction to use the actual duck skin and fat (truly, I don't know where I would have gotten my hands on that anyway).  As I knew they would be, these potatoes were out of this world delicious - not so much because of the recipe, but because of the duck fat itself.  I will say that cutting the potatoes in such small chunks as directed in this recipe, guarantees that much more duck fat flavored crispiness.  Using a cast iron skillet helped that along too.  I used leeks as one of the suggested alternatives to the green garlic (don’t know where I’d find that either) and just as I suspected, the level of heat required to brown the potatoes was too high for the leeks, and they tended to burn.  I ended up discarding them.   As for these potatoes, fried in duck fat?   Ohhhh, yeah.

Potatoes cooked in duck fat.  What's not to love?  We had received garlic scapes in our weekly CSA basket this week and this was a perfect way to use them. The duck fat, which is not nearly as unhealthy as most people assume, gives these potatoes a nice crispy crunch and if you use a starchy potato like a Yukon or a Russet, they develop a creamy inside. Duck skin and/or duck fat can be hard to come by, but if you find them, buy a little extra because you will be making these potatoes again!

Flavorful! Could not find a duck, so I used the Graisse de Canard (Duck Fat) I bought when I was in France. Green garlic is out of season, so I used Green Onion. Seasoned with French Herb Salt and Cracked Pepper. Blanched the potatoes first. Fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside. They were great, but next time I'll use the duck skin and green garlic, because Chef John's looked better than mine.

Made with bacon instead of duck (don't know where to find it) and put garlic in it and love love love. Next time I want to put onion in it.

YUUUUMMM!!!  I didn't have the green garlic, and really don't know what it is, but it sounds like a cross between a green onion and garlic.  So I substituted with those :)  This is delicious!!!

Excellent recipe! Skip the peeling step, you get more nutrition from the skin and it makes them look more interesting. I used a few tablespoons of duck fat from a leftover Christmas duck and two cloves of regular garlic and it turned out just fine. Be sure to flip them so they cook evenly.
