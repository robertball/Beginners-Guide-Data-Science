This recipe was really good and very simple to prepare although you do need some time to complete all the steps.  I took this to a meeting at church and it got rave reviews from several of the men. Some even had seconds!  I would say that I could never get the jello/cherry mixture to become the consistency of "egg whites" and was running out of time so just decided to pour the liquid over the cake anyway.  It did finally set up as intended after I added the pudding mixture.  This was also a beautiful dessert.  Got many oooh's and aaah's before it was consumed.  I used sugar-free jello, fat-free pudding, and skim milk and no one was the wiser.

If you're looking for an impressive dessert this is it!  it looks like you've spent the day in the kitchen, but it isn't difficult at all, you just need to plan ahead a little bit. I took this dessert to a church dinner last Christmas and it was gone before I got to have any!  This is a crowd favorite for sure!  If you make your angel food cake a day in advance, it's ready to be included in this dessert.

I've made this a couple times and it is really good-it's very refreshing and has great flavor. My grandkids love it as well as all the adults in my family. Followed recipe exactly as written. Has great presentation as well. Thanks for sharing.

Such a good recipe! I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding almonds as a garnish!

This will become a regular at our Christmas table. Simple to do, just takes some time between steps, and looks like you fussed all day.  Lovely presentation.  Made the angel food cake from box early, then let cool and started on the jello base and let cool.  Made it the day before - and it was wonderful- everyone had seconds.

Always a hit! Never any left over. Can be made with sugar free jello, sugar free fat free pudding and lite whipped topping and lite cherry pie filling. It takes 2 small boxes of jello if you use sugar free. This is my Mom's favorite!

Oh how refreshing and a new use for jello! I subbed red vanilla cake bc I didn't have angel food, and instead of vanilla I used cheesecake flavored pudding. Excellent! Next time maybe blueberry or orange but I love anything cherry.

I made this recipe for our holiday gathering. I followed the directions and ingredients exactly. While it was tasty, the vanilla pudding seemed bland to the flavorful cherry base. I would make this recipe again but I think I would substitute another flavor of pudding, maybe banana or pistachio. Well recommended.

I made changes to the recipe to represent the Red, White and Blue. In addition to the the Cherry pie filling and  Cherry jello, I added Blueberry Pie Filling and Berry Blue Jello.  I layered the cake, pie filling mixture and pudding mixture rather than a single layer. I am bringing the dessert to a Fourth of July celebration.

this recipe is different than the one on the Kraft site. The original recipe calls for a  6 oz package of jello. It will take a long time to thicken with one 3 oz. I also put all of the cherry filling in the jello as opposed to keeping 1/3 out. Mainly because the canned cherries I use are not really pretty. I top with a marashino cherry or two instead. Next time I am going to try pound cake instead of angel food. But I think it is good this way also. I put it in a trifle dish and it looks like you spent a long time on it. You can also try different puddings instead of vanilla.

The instructions to me were not informational enough. I followed the directions on the box for the gelatin but followed the rest as it was. Guess it turned out fine! Anxious to try other flavors of puddings, and maybe jellos!
