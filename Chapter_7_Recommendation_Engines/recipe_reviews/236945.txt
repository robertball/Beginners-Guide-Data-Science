Easy, if messy to assemble.  If you choose, I would actually chop the apple slices from the filling smaller.  Some of mine were too big to fit into the pocket I pushed into the cinnamon roll.  There's no 'pretty' way to seal the cinnamon rolls together without ruining the look of the cinnamon roll.  I ended up simply placing the top cinnamon roll on the bottom and hoping for the best.  Family had no complaints!  Assembled the night before and made for a Monday morning breakfast.  Happy Family!

I made this as a treat for my husband and brother-in-law and they absolutely loved it. I used one can of Grands Cinnamon Rolls and unrolled them then just laid them kind of twisted up in the pan. Then I inserted the apples from the pie filling into the nooks and crannies and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. Drizzled with icing once done. Fabulous!!

I had to come up with quick meal ideas for surprise visitors, and this was the dessert I chose to make.  It was fast, easy, and everyone loved it.  Nice job on this one!  Will make again for sure!

I followed the advice of another and cut the apples into smaller pieces and placed the roll on top without sealing the rolls. It came out very well, as there are none left . I also made just half of the recipe.
