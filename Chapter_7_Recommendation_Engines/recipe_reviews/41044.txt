My 13 year old son wanted lobster tails for his first teenage birthday dinner.  I chose this recipe and we all couldn't believe how fantastic the lobsters turned out using this recipe.  My husband still mentions periodically how good they were (we had them three months ago).

Great recipe - my first time cooking lobster.  Used the gas grill and served the lobster with white and wild rice and roasted broccoli and carrots.

My husband and I have used this recipe for 2 years now, on Valentines day. We love it. But if you dont follow the recipe, then they dry out and get chewy. SO dont cook them to long.

Nothing really special here, but an O.K. change of pace from the standard drawn butter.
