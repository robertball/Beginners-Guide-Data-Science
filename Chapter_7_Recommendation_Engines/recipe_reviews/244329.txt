Would be better with chicken.  The pork was tough, even tho I marinated it.

Made as directed minus the tomatoes since I didn't have any. Bumped up the garlic and added nutmeg to the white sauce. Nice comfort food.

I cut this down for 2 people by only using 2 small pork loin chops.  To the meat/broccoli mixture, I added 1/2 thinly sliced zuchini, 1/2 red pepper, and a few mushrooms.  Very tasty...will make again.

Delicious- will definitely make again! Perfect leftovers to take to work for lunch, too. I didn't use preseasoned pork, so I rubbed it with garlic cloves and peppered it while it was thawing.
