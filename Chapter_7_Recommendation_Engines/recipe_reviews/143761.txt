Wow! This was incredible! THe coconut made it crispy and sweet on the top. I had read a not so good review that said it got too done on the top and the apples weren't cooked, so I sliced the apples very thin and took it out of the oven a couple minutes early. It was perfect! Thanks for the terrifically good and easy recipe!

This cobbler got my husband's seal of approval from the first bite. One change I made though, since I didn't have caramel sauce on hand, was to substitute 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce instead and it turned out very well. Also cuts a lot of sugar out of the recipe if you're watching that. Either way, thanks for the easy to follow and make recipe! I will definitely be using this as my go-to recipe.

This is cobbler perfection.  I haven't had a better cobbler ever.  I didn't use Granny Smith, my parents brought me a bushel of Cortland apples from Michigan so I turned to Allrecipes once again for ideas to use them up.  Thanks for submitting this recipe, I am intermediate cook and absolutely love this site.

I was really disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly, but the biscuits browned after 26 minutes (VERY brown), while the undersides of the biscuits were raw!  The apples were still fairly crisp, too.  Maybe next time I would pre-bake the apples or something.  I bet this would taste great if it came out properly, but I won't try this again.

I work alot but I had a BBQ on a Friday night and I had to bring a dish and this is amazingly simple and delicious! Only thing I would recommend is to cover the  top for the first 15 minutes or so(gas stove) and let it cook a lil bit longer so to be sure to cook the biscuits all the time way!

This was the best of all recipes I have tried.  We followed the directions without any changes and the result was excellent.  My 11, 4 and 2 year old kids loved helping out.  When it was done my Husband said it looked like a desert from a fancy restaurant.

If I could give this 6 stars I would.  What a hit.  Absolutly delicious and so very very easy. I don't think I'll make a cobbler any other way from now on.  I didn't change a thing.

This needed to cook for much longer.  I took it out and without checking it served it to my guests.  The biscuits were still doughy.  I think after cooking it for a longer period of time, this will be a great dessert.

I made this about 6 hours ago, and it's almost gone! My husband loves cobbler and he LOVES coconut. How easy this was and what a hit! It will definately go in my "all the time" recipe file. I will say that the middle of the cobbler was somewhat "doughy" still, and I couldn't bake it longer or the coconut would have burnt. But we don't care and will make this over and over!

This was awesome. I couldn't wait to try it. I used less coconut and it was still amazing.

This was my first cobbler. It was certainly very easy. It tasted yummy too. However, I'm just wondering if something other than biscuits could have used. Anybody's varition on this ingredient would be helpful because I do plan to make it again in the future. Thanks!

Had the same problem as some other people with the dough not cooked all the way but it could probably be avoided next time by rolling the dough out thin or use less dough. But I just cut into the cobbler to vent it and baked it again as long as I could without burning the top layer and it turned out just fine. Made my own caramel sauce and sadly didn’t have coconut to sprinkle on top but I did sprinkle with cinnamon. This was my first time making a cobbler and I enjoyed it and will more than likely use this recipe again but tweak it just in the crust aspect instead of flat out blaming the recipe since many others had complete successes with it.

Delicious and crazy easy! I whipped this up while dinner was in the oven, and then we had a warm dessert ready for us by the time we were done cleaning up after dinner. I served mine with a seasonal cinnamon ice cream and it was a perfect taste of fall.

I did use prepared apple pie filling so skipped the flour.  The coconut and sugar made a nice finish to the top.

I have made this a few times now and changed a few things each time. I had better luck with homemade biscuits...I just dropped small spoonfuls of dough all over the top of the apples. I didn't add any extra butter. When I put the coconut on top, it browned way too quickly and was close to being burned. I love coconut so much, I am going to try putting the coconut on top of the apples next time and then topping that with the biscuit dough. Maybe that will also help with the biscuits cooking completely through and not being doughy. It still tastes great though even with the browned coconut and slightly doughy biscuits!
