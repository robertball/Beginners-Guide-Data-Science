O.M.G.   Seriously the *best* corn on the cob we have ever had!  Sugar & lemon juice?  Insane! But it worked beautifully!  I am somewhat of a corn snob (and would personally be perfectly content eatting it virtually raw from the stalk) so I was somewhat hesitant and made two pots - one just in boiling water, the other as you directed in your recipe.  The subtle sweetness of the sugar meshed with the tangy lemon juice was superb.  Thank you so much for recipe!

Have made it like this before. I like it. Leaving a 5 star to counteract the jerk that left a 1 star review because her husband's a diabetic. Reviewing recipes you can't eat and didn't make is a dick move. Get a life and quit making me do this.

Outstanding!  From now on, this is how I will be making corn on the cob... you can't taste the lemon juice or the sugar, but it adds a subtle sweetness and the corn doesn't get overcooked and chewy.  Love it!  UPDATE 2018:  6 years later, this is still the only way I will make corn on the cob - even my mom wanted my "secret" for great corn EVERY TIME.

SUMMER! I grew up in NW PA on a Dairy Farm where we grew a lot of COB; I've always cooked it the same way salted boiling water, add the corn, cover and remove from heat.i don't know what compelled me to check out ideas but I found 2 yours with lemon juice and sugar and another with vinegar and sugar..used 2 pots and lemon juice won hands down. The vinegar and sugar was better than my original method but after 30 years will ever use anything but sugar and lemon juice again. The leftover corn that I butter and wrap for easy microwave reheating stayed crisper and didn't have the mushy spots. Thanks for a great recipe !

I can't believe it but truly the best corn I've ever had.  When I read the recipe and reviews I thought this is crazy, it can't make a difference to add sugar and lemon juice but it honestly did.  It really brought out the flavor of the corn.  And I also didn't believe that letting it sit for 10 minutes would thoroughly cook the corn but it did, perfectly.  I would recommend when putting the corn in making sure the water comes back to a boil for a few seconds before turning it off to let it sit or you can keep it on the lowest lowest setting for the 10 min.  I will be making corn this way from now on!!

I was nervous that I didnt have any milk to add to my water. I havent made corn on the cob since I married a man with lactose intolerance:) I was looking for a way to make the corn sweet and tender. It was perfect. I even had not so great corn to start with and this made it better! Thank you!

My hubby claims lemon juice ruins everything . . . you can usually count on me to overcook or undercook corn on the cob.  I followed the recipe exactly (squeezing the fresh lemon juice in without notice).  The results were amazing! Corn so sweet, tender, fresh and juicy!  Hubby thought it was a hit!  It's not my practice to keep secrets with strangers -- but Jamie's addition of lemon juice is a secret we'll share 4-ever!

Not sure about this one, not that its a terminal illness or anything, but I am worried they aren't cooking!  Maybe its because my step used to boil 'em for about 4 and a half hours (& that was her quick boil).  I guess we'll see, they are in their ten minute window as we speak : O              
PS: darnit, I should have waited til after they were stuck in my teeth because I couldn't leave this blurb unless I chose a star!
UPDATE: I definitely tasted the "above normal sweetness" for corn at this time of the year in Georgia, however, it was too al dente for my taste.  I just popped it back into the hot water & I'll keep an eye on it.  Hell, I'll take al dente over mushy any day, ya' know?  Taste was seriously delish though-thanks for the recipe!  :  )

One star simply for adding sugar to this veggie's cooking water.

 My hubs is diabetic, so just having corn is stretching the diet.  The best way to prepare corn on the cob is to let its natural flavor shine!  To prevent waterlogged corn, try this method:  Remove husk and silk, and rinse/trim corn.  Shake off excess water, then wrap in wax paper, twist ends closed.  Place wrapped ears in microwave, and nuke for approx 6 minutes on high for 3 ears. Adjust time up or down, depending on # of ears, and your personal preference.  Carefully unwrap paper from ears, and you have perfectly cooked, crisp, tasty corn on the cob!

This was so easy and it came out crisp and not mushy at all. I used frozen cut corn. I couldn't even taste the lemon juice. I thought it would make this bitter but all it did was make this fresh and crisp. Fabulous corn! Thanks for sharing your mother in law's great recipe.

Corn On the Cob is my favorite!!  I've been using this method to make Fresh and Frozen corn on the cobb for as long as I have been cooking. (about 65years). This is how grandmother and mama made corn on the cob if it was not being roasted. Another hint the water should be at a full rolling boil and the corn at room temperature when it is introduced to the water. Never allow your corn to cook more than 10 minutes, it will become tough. The longer the cook time the tougher the corn will become. It has only to cook long enough to congeal the milk inside the kernels.  Additionally, once the corn is cooked it will dry out and become tough if left unattended. If you have to keep the corn warm for a short period use a deep dish and 1/2 cup warm not hot water and 1/2 cup warm not hot whole milk, a generous tablespoon of BUTTER and a pinch of sugar. Cover and let stand in a barely warm oven. When ready to plate be sure to roll each ear in the water milk mixture to see that each piece is moist.

Delicious! The lemon juice really takes it up a notch, without making your corn taste at all like lemon.

I cut the corn into halves and followed the instructions as it said. I wish it specified how much lemon juice and sugar to add. It was a little too bland for my liking. Next time I need to add more lemon juice/sugar and cook it a little longer.

I tried this recipe exactly and I got a subtle sweet flavor, I do not know if it was because I purchased sweet corn and/or combination of sugar in water, I will try this again with regular corn to see if there is a difference.

This was by far the best boiled corn we've ever had!  The sugar and the lemon juice makes it so sweet and tender.  Will be my go to for boiling corn.  We also like to grill our corn.

Wow!  I was really surprised.  I was hesitant to add lemon juice feeling it was going to ruin everything but you couldn't taste it or smell it.  The corn was perfect.  Firm crisp ears of corn as if it was made by a pro.   Being that I have never shut the water off previously I had fear that they wouldn't be cooked enough.  I followed the advice of others and let the water come to a boiling.  I then lowered it to simmer for three minutes then shut it off for five more minutes.  Well satisfied!

Unbelievably delicious! From now on this is how I'll cook my corn on the cob! I read the other reviews about letting the water return to a boil before putting the lid and removing it from the heat. It worked great!! Thank you for a great recipe that is quick, easy, & delicious!

I was scared of the lemon juice but I went ahead and made it as directed.  It came out perfect.  Tastes like sweet corn, no  strong lemon flavor.  I didn't need to put the usual butter or salt on it.  Perfect!

I have cooked sweet corn with lemon juice and sugar for years. I found this recipe in a Betty Crocker cookbook. I had an uncle from Kansas who visited me one summer. I went out in my garden, picked some of my Peaches and Cream corn, shucked and removed the silk on the way into the house and dropped it into the already boiling water. He raved that was the best corn on the cob he had ever eaten, and he was a farmer who grew corn every year! Of course, cooking corn on the cob immediately after picking is the secret to extra-delicious corn.

This sounded so weird, but also intriguing.  I'm always up for something new.  I did allow my corn to boil for about eight minutes before I removed the pot from the burner and covered it.  My mom raved about the taste.  I'm definitely doing this again.

This was perfect... I made it exactly as listed, but left it in the water a few extra minutes until my main course was ready; no longer than five extra minutes. It kept the corn hot, and the the kernels were still crisp, sweet, and delicious. No butter or anything else was needed. Unbelievably delicious! Thanks for this great recipe! I used farm stand corn, just picked today.

No Changes. It turned out delicious! Amazing how many people boil the  out of corn for up to 45 min. I never did. I used to boil them for 10-15 min. But this new learned way is the best. I will always cook them this way. Tender, sweet and succulent. Thanks

You can get the same results by just putting the corn into boiling water and let boil for four minutes then taking it out.

Perfect just the way the recipe states! So simple, so easy and yet the best tasting corn on the cob I've ever had.

The best corn on the cob we have ever had. The sugar adds sweetness and the Lemmon juice brings out the color.

My first time with fresh corn on the cob. Recipe is simple and fool proof. I would have never guessed the lemon juice part. Very good. Thank you!

I couldn't taste a difference, maybe the corn I buy is already very sweet! BUT...my boyfriend said he could taste a subtle difference and really, really liked it. I'll definitely try this again!

There is a reason this comes up first when you put "perfect corn on the cob" in the search engine! The only adjust i make is the boil time, i let my corn boil for 10 mins covered before cutting the heat off and its the sweetest cripspiest corn ever guaranteed

We love corn on the cob... I’ve added sugar, with little to no improvement over plain water cooking. I’ve grilled it with the husk, soaked and not; without the husk, slathered with mayo before grilling (pretty good), and steamed. But today, for the first time, I used this recipe, and it was the best ever.  I used a strip of lemon zest (the thin yellow skin with all white pith removed) from a one inch wedge of lemon instead of lemon juice, and that worked just fine. Thanks so much for this winning recipe!

I've been doing a variation on this for years, using a recipe in an old Betty Crocker cookbook.  Just enough water to cover your corn, equal parts sugar and lemon juice, put the corn in when the water's still cold, boil gently for two minutes, then remove from heat and leave uncovered for 10 minutes.

I had a neighbor that had a vegetable garden, and out of it, he gave me some corn.  He told me to boil it in water with sugar and lemon juice, that it was the best way to get sweet, tender corn.  I have never made it any other way.  Talk about simple and delicious!

Easy. Low energy usage (boil the water, add corn, cover, turn off heat). Pro Tip: if you find it isn't cooked, leave it longer or allow it to boil for 60 seconds first after adding corn, then turn off. Just make sure your sugar isn't bone char processed sugar and it's vegan. Yum.  Been making it this way for years and have no interest in making it any other way (when boiling corn). Jamie's mother-in-law is sharp!  Hope she's still your mother-in-law. :P

I can only assume I had too much water for the sugar and lemon juice, but then the recipe doesn't specify how much water. This tasted absolutely no different from any other time I've boiled fresh sweet corn.

No changes at all.  I cooked 15 ears of corn,  8 in one batch, then 7 more in the same water, and they all came out just right!  All the ears were cooked perfectly in the 10 minute time.  Love cooking corn on the cob this way.

The lemon juice was a new tip for the corn and it is delicious. The instructions for cooking is just perfect! A great idea  to turn off the heat and let it set for q minutes, it does not overcook that way and nice and tender.

I did add butter to the water and then placed the corn in the pot.  I've used this recipe several times.  The corn comes out crisp and sweet!

Made as per recipe, and corn was very tasty!  Will be doing this in future for cooked corn on cob.  You could not taste lemon juice at all or sugar. Thank you for great recipe!

For a novice cook, I looked up this basic recipe because I didn't know how to boil corn. The corn came out tender and delicious. I appreciate this website. As I progress as a cook, the complexity of recipes with step by step directions will be useful.

Thank you for sharing this. I let it sit for 15 minutes and it was perfect! So nice to not have to watch the pot to prevent boil over. The taste was just right.

Mmmmm.  I buy corn from different sources, who buy from different sources.   So it isn't the same from time to time.  This time I had to reheat the water to boiling and put it back for a few minutes.  I also returned the pot to a boil for a minute the first time because I had a hunch.  Still a Great recipe!

I’m glad I found this recipe because I had corn that I needed to use before it went bad. I’ve never cooked corn this way and it was a hit with my family! I took another reviewers suggestion and added a little milk to the water

We loved it. The corn was sweet and tender even though it was bought several days ago. I can't wait to try it with freshly picked ears of corn. Definitely 2 thumps up. Thanks for the recipe, heatherjane. This is the only way I will make sweet corn from now on.

I thought it was cheating by adding sugar to the water for sweet corn, but it does add a bit of something. I do boil for a few minutes before turning off the heat, but this has been a lovely side dish a few times. Thank you!

Been doing it this way for years.  It was in the old Betty Crocker cook book out of the 1960s.  As a new cook, far away from home, I consulted that book for everything.  I remember once a bunch of us military wives were sitting around, talking, and a newlywed girl asked how to make boiled corn on the cob.  All the women laughed as if she were silly and  yet it turns out that  none of them knew this trick--  except me and Betty!

The recipe worked out perfectly, however, still a part of me doesn't like using white sugar.

My dinner guests loved this! In most commented that they have always only had corn on the cob that was apparently always overcooked. So this was a hit! So I will use it again!

Very simple and easy recipe:)

This was the best corn !!! I'm not sure if it was the way it was cooked or just the perfect corn :) I'll cook it this way all corn season and put it to the test. So tender and sweet , I did throw about 3/4 c of milk into the water, and had to substitute lime juice since I had no lemon. Yummm

Made the recipe exactly as stated.  Delicious and easy!  Really brought out the flavor of sweet corn.  My husband ate 4 ears and neighbors wanted the recipe. I'd say that's a winner.

I did not use lemon juice, I just used sugar and salt to boil the corn. After boiling, I buttered the corn a bit and added Italian seasoning on top.

I did not make any changes and I will not follow this recipe again. It did nothing for my out of season corn. Just a waste of lemon juice and sugar.

Very easy to make this and my family couldn't stop eating the corn!  They really weren't that interested in the rest of the meal as they went through most of the corn I had in the pot (I had planned for leftovers)!

I really didn’t have high hopes. I didn’t think I would notice much of a difference but I absolutely did. It was crisp and tender if that makes sense and very sweet even when the corn wasn’t necessarily the best.

Fabulous!  I will never make corn again another way.  The addition of sugar and lemon juice bring out the natural sweetness of the corn.  I don't boil mine quite as long as the recipe states just because we like ours a little crunchier.

I love corn on the cob, but I haven't made it in a long time, just because  I'm the only one that likes it. Well, tonight I was craving it (winco had it on a great sale, so I bought a bunch of it lol).  I tried this recipe, and OH MY GOODNESS!!! Even my kids loved it,  and my husband went back for more. I'll never cook it any other way. Thanks so much for this awesome recipe. It was tender, sweet, but not too sweet, and down right perfect. It did take a bit longer to cook though, I even had to bring the water back to a heavy boil after putting the cobs in, I let boil at a roll for about 3 mins, turned it off again, and within 5 mins it was done. So about 18-20 mins total. I bought it two days ago,  so maybe it wasn't as fresh as I thought it was. Other than that...perfection. Thanks again.

OMG, such a treat!  I came across this recipe by accident (searching for steamed corn times) and decided to give it a try. It was the sweetest, most tender corn I've ever had.  I didn't know if I was supposed to cover the corn completely with water but I had enough room to do it.  NO LEFTOVERS.  LOL  Thanks for sharing!

Whoa. 10 was WAY too long to cook fresh corn!  It only needed about 4 minutes of boiling; anything more and it got mushy and mealy.

I've made this several times, I only registered here just now. 
I always use brown sugar. I like the idea of adding sugar and lemon juice, I just wanted to change it up a little bit with brown sugar instead of white. I don't know whether it makes a diffference, but this recipe always gives me crisp, juicy corn. Thank you

I suppose if you already have very sweet corn then you don't need to do this trick but for the rest of us it helps us get the sweet flavors that are probably only found on the farms with fresh corn.   Thanks for the tip!!  Even the pickiest of my kids enjoyed it.

I've been using a microwave method to make my COTC.  But this recipe was so easy I didn't believe it would work.  The best corn on the cob I've ever made.  I'll definitely make it again.  And I'll use the cooled water to water some plants.

I am JUST rating the cooking method.   Our corn was sweet, so I didn't think I would need salt and lemon juice.  Bringing water to a boil, adding the corn, returning to a boil, then turning off the heat and letting the corn sit for 10 minutes as described cooked it perfectly.  Thank you!

I didn't notice much difference taste-wise but perhaps I had too large of a pot of water in regard to the amount of sugar. I also used bottled lemon juice not fresh so maybe that would account for something. Now the method of covering the pot and turning off the heat for 10 mins once it started to boil worked well.  ( I usually boil the full 10 mins uncovered)

Absolutely wonderful.  I put my corn in the water (just covering the corn) and let it come to a roaring boil.  I then covered the pot and turned off the heat.  Perfect!

I have been making my corn this way for years except that I put my corn in the cold water with the sugar and lemon juice and let it all come to a boil. I live at an altitude where water boils at a much lower temperature (190 degrees) so I let the corn boil for a couple of minutes before turning it off and covering it to sit for 10 minutes.

no changes. Corn starts loosing sugar 6 hours after it is pulled.  I have always added sugar. If I am not cooking it  after shucking I will add sugar to water and put in in a storage bag and the fridge until ready to cook..

Even the corn that was left in the pot for hours did not get mushy!

Perfectly cooked! Tip...add corn to empty pot then add water just enough to cover.....remove corn then follow directions.....prevents any excess water from overflowing. Love mine slathered with butter and fresh ground black pepper. Superb.

Worked perfectly as written. If you prefer your corn a bit softer, allow it to boil for a couple of minutes before removing from the burner.

Very nice.  Corn did not get mushy or overcooked, even when I left it sit for an additional 10 minutes to get the burgers finished.  I will make this again.

followed directions to the letter, and this was tasty! we really enjoyed it! So much easier than wrapping and putting on grill & it getting over cooked! I would recommend to sit a little longer in the hot water for a less firm corn, but I enjoyed it as it was!

I always make corn this way, except that I don't add anything to the water. I used to add sugar but found that it doesn't make any difference. I don't think that such a small amount of lemon would have much impact either.

I would like to add that you can leave the corn in the water as long as you need to while the rest of the food is cooking.  The corn stays warm but the actual cooking stops. It doesn't overcook or get mushy.

My dad is a truck driver and today when he got home, he brought over some fresh corn that he bought from the load that he carried. I haven't cooked fresh corn in a long time, so I tried this quick and easy recipe. The corn was amazing and my kids are begging for seconds!

Wow I never would have thought to add the lemon juice!  It didn't taste one bit lemony at all.  It was crisp and sweet and delicious!  I did allow the corn to boil for 3 minutes before I took it off the burner because I like my corn a little more cooked.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

Good directions as far as cooking. I just add salt, no sugar or lemon and it comes out great.
