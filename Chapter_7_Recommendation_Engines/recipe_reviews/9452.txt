The batter was good...way too much peanut butter, not enough sweetness for me. I added 1/2 cup more powdered sugar. I didn't like the "glaze" for these, nor did I like the way that they looked. So I rolled them into balls and dipped them in chocolate.

The flavor is incredible, and all of my guests loved them.  Very time-consuming to make.  Idea: I made second batch by spreading a layer of chocolate in a 13X1 inch pan.  (Use wax paper on the bottom)  Cool in refrig. for 10 minutes, then add peanut butter. Re-melt remaining chocolate and pour on top.  Refrigerate 10 minutes, then cut in to small squares.

this recipe would be great if you could eat it right after making it. however, if this sits overnight (or even a few hours)...it is absolutely terrible. the rice crispies become soggy and gross.  good concept, wrong cereal.

These "logs" are disgusting to look at, but taste pretty darn good.  I added milk chocolate chips to the half of the glaze, which added to the disgusting appearance, but really improved the taste.  They tasted like the candy bar "Whatchamacalit."  The chocolate glazed logs were devoured, but the half with the regular glaze were barely touched.

Instead of the glaze, melt chocolate chips and dip the tops of each log and let it harden...better than glaze....
