I used the veggies I happened to have ready in the garden that day, zucchini (shredded), cherry tomatoes (halved), and jalapenos (sliced). I also changed the spiced to cumin and chili powder to compliment the veggies I was using. I had to add about 30 min to the cooking time, but in the end it turned out delicious! Great way to enjoy summer produce! Will definitely make this again!

My first attempt to make a quiche and it was a delicious success! I was skeptical about the spice combo, but it was perfect once I added a little smoked paprika. I used a whole wheat pie crust (from Whole Foods) and I added some spinach to make it even healthier. I also put the cheddar on top. Yum!!

I omitted the garlic and curry powder only because I have a sensitive stomach to spices. I used fresh grated Parmesan and mozzarella cheese with the egg mixture also to make it creamy. It's easy and love it!

I used a 6" quiche tin that I salvaged from a bought one, & made my own pastry for this dish, I didn't have a lot of the ingredients for this recipe, so I basically used what I had. I used beaten eggs, a little milk,grated cheese, chopped onions, mushrooms and tomatoes inside, and garnished on top a little cheese and sliced tomatoes.

Very, very tasty.  I used red pepper instead of curry powder, and used 1/2 cup of cheddar instead of the 1/4 cup of Parmesan.  I added in some vegetarian sausage too.  Cook time of 45 minutes was spot on for me.

Will definitely make again!

Turned out fantastically. Made it for my French 2 class and it was a huge hit. I suggest that if you’re going to omit the curry and use cinnamon to use a graham cracker crust because it goes with the sweetness of the cinnamon. If you omit the curry and cinnamon cook the graham cracker crust until it’s a nice brown and it will come out tasting like cornbread.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except I added about a half cup of polish sausage. The flavoring was fantastic. If I was going to make this again the only thing I'd change would be to half the amount of butter. Other than that I wouldn't touch a thing!

I didn't have zucchini but included everything else. I didn't have curry powder either so I substituted with chilli powder to keep that zing. Came out really well!

Very good. I used broccoli instead of the zucchini, and took only half onion and more of the other vegetables.

I just made this for dinner.  Although I think it had a tad too much onions, it was absolutely delicious! The flavor profile was wonderful.  I definitely think that I will make it again!

Mix the cheese with a tablespoon of flour, that way it doesn’t sink to the bottom.

I must have done something wrong because this was perfectly cooked after only 20 minutes...
FLAVOR WAS YUMMY! Switched out veggies to what I had on hand, and accidentally overdosed the cinnamon, but it was still delish.

This was delicious! I added some chopped broccoli and left out the cumin and cinnamon. I doubled the recipe and made two pies. A good thing I did because we finished one immediately and I have one in the fridge to take a slice for breakfast this week. My picky, veggie-hating husband loved it!

I guess you could say I made it but I made a lot of variations. I made 2 with 10 eggs and a teaspoon of curry powder, two bags of spinach that I had sauteed with the onions, sun-dried tomatoes and no zucchini since it's not seasonal. I was going to add mushrooms but didn't have any and I forgot the cheese ahead of time so I sprinkled it on top and I'll put it at the end. Scrumptious

The quiche turned out well, the directions were clear and easy to follow.  I used my spirializer on the zucchini instead of cutting it in chunks   It diisappeared quickly on Christmas morning.

Good way to use fresh veggies.  Next time I would substitute the paprika or chili powder for the curry.

Love this recipe! I like to put a bit of extra curry powder and top the quiche with sliced tomatoes instead of cheese to keep it on the healthier side.

Absolutely delicious!  I made my own crust and did not pre-bake it.  Used what veggies I had on hand - zucchini, mushroom, tomato, kale, celery.  I loved so much about this!  The seasoning was perfect and there wasn't a massive amount of cheese.  What a great quiche!

This was delicious. I used less peppers (orange, because we don't like green) and more mushrooms, and as a result there were so many veggies in the quiche that I didn't need the entire egg mixture. It started to overflow when I poured the egg/cheese mixture over the vegetables. Otherwise an excellent dish.

I found it was sweeter than I like. I would not hurry to do it again.

We really liked this. I followed it almost perfectly, except I didn't sauté the tomatoes and just added them sliced, fresh, on top before baking. The method of baking the crust first didn't work well for me. Next time I'll add some beans to weigh it down. I used a gluten free pastry, maybe this was the reason. Thank you for the recipe.

This was very yummy. I followed the recipe, except I subbed mozzarella (i needed to get rid of)  for the cheddar. I was questioning the cinnamon, but it works! Thank you for this recipe

Awesome!  Just made it and meat-eater Dad said it was good!  I didn't have mushrooms or Parmesan so, I subbed spinach and Romano.  I topped it with cheese too for a nice bubbly, golden-brown top.  Also doubled it for my 2 pie crust package.  Both cooked in 35 mins.  This is SO versatile a dish you could use almost any veggie or complimentary cheese mix with it.  That curry & cinnamon, though, kicks in the flavor!  Yum!
