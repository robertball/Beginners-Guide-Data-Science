This was very good for my son's third birthday party--the children drank it up fast!  I would, however, recommend that one lets the sherbet and ice cream thaw at least an hour before adding it to the punch.  This makes for less lumps and easy blending.

YUM!  I used 7up only (omitted the milk).  Made this for a birthday party, it was a big hit!

Very Good! Even my Father-in-law who only drinks Pepsi loved this! I started making this punch an hour before the party to give the ice cream time to melt, and the consistency was perfect just as the party started. I did use a little more Sprite than what the recipe called for.

My family REALLY liked this one. Kids especially. They would give it a 5*. I give it a 4. I thought it lacked a little in flavor. HOWEVER, it is good with a shot of rum in it too ;)

This is easy, festive, and super yummy!  Make sure you make it a few minutes before guests arrive to give the sherbet time to melt a bit.  Thanks!

This is wonderful!  It is so nice to have a punch without pineapples or pineapple juice in it!  The last time I made this I almost panicked when I realized I was out of milk.  I didn't have time to get some, so I improvised with a can of sweetened condensed milk, with a a couple of cups of evaporated milk plus water to make milk (as directed on can).
I didn't have a drop left over....(but it added a ton of calories!)

Actually does taste like a Dreamsicle.  The kids at Easter loved it and a second batch was needed.  The adults....not as much, but we had none left after two batches of it.  Very good for a party with kids.

I thought this was really good but my husband and kids wouldn't even try it because it mixed milk and soda.  Maybe I shouldn't have told them what was in it!

I thought this was good but it tastes more like a milkshake to me than a punch. I love the "orange cream bar" flavor and think it would be great to make it less "liquid" and serve as a milkshake but it wasn't that great as a punch for me.

This is really good, just as written.  I was a little leery of putting milk into a punch, but it turned out great.  However, I got only about 15 typical punch sized servings out of this recipe, no where near 24.

Made this for my Mother's 60th bday party - was very nice.  Had a chocolate and coffee theme going, and this was the perfect foil.  Def leave your ice cream/sherbet out for several hours and use as much Sprite as you like!

I made this for my son's 1st birthday party because it matched our color scheme (well that, and all the good reviews!)  I added a can of thawed OJ concentrate and I could barely keep the punch bowl filled!  This recipe gets 5 starts with the addition of the juice.

Excellent punch!  It works great for parties, baby showers, any event!  And to answer bobbybaby, the product is actually called sherbet, not sorbet.  We don't call sherbet sorbet either and I'm not sure what you are talking about with the "powdered stuff", must be an australian thing!  You will find sherbet in the ice cream section of the grocery store.  Good luck, it's a great recipe!

This is a wonderful punch!  We used this as our "witches brew" for our kids' Halloween party.  We made it in a plastic cauldron.  I added 3 cans of Fresca and pretty much just threw in the other ingredients without paying attention to measurements.  I also put in plastic eyeballs and fingers.  People loved it and thought it tasted just like an Orange Julius or Orange Creamsicle.  Will definitely make again.

Very good! I find that the instructed can of cistrusy-soda makes little difference to the overall taste, and I have effectively replaced it with lots of different liquids. I'd personally say, cut calories where you can and just use club soda. Perhaps even an adult version of this drink could be made, by replacing it with a vodka or something in that vein.

It's important to keep in mind what kind of milk you have on hand in your refrigerator; being a grandmother we always stock Skim Milk -- but the kids prefer Vitamin D Whole Milk.  It definitely makes a difference!

I was a little unsure about the milk and soda fizz mixture but I was intrigued so I decided to give it a try. I just cleaned my fridge yesterday and dumped my last remaining ginger ale and we don't have soda so I replaced that with champagne. It vanilla, orange sherbet has a very creamy taste. Make sure you stir well and allows the ice creams to fully mix with the liquids.

I used Breyers Natural Vanilla ice cream, Safeway brand Mandarine Tangerine sherbet, Hansens natural Mandarine Lime soda, and Horizon Organic Milk. It was super super yummy! I think if you wanted more orange flavor you could add a smidgin of orange juice concentrate but we did not find that necessary. What a great party treat!
