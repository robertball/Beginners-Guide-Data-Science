Okay, I'm convinced - these cupcakes are fragrant with the aroma of eggnog as they bake and when you bite into one you are most definitely tasting eggnog as well.  The flavor is delicious but I am not a fan of the cupcake itself.  Clearly the reason these are so flavorful of eggnog is because so much of it is used in the batter.  Unfortunately, however, I missed the butter that was cut from the package directions in order to accomplish that.  The texture is  just off.  Yes, they are dense like a pound cake, but there is no crumb to speak of and they're not tender - just dense with the texture resembling that of a sponge.  There simply is not enough fat in the eggnog to eliminate the butter that otherwise would have, and should have, been included.  Now the frosting, on the other hand, is perfect and beautiful.  The proportions of each of the ingredients is spot on, right up to and including the eggnog - and I enthusiastically rate it five stars.  Still, the frosting cannot make up for the cupcake underneath it, so overall, I unfortunately cannot rate this any higher than 3 stars.

After reading one reviewers opinion that there was not enough fat in these, I added the 1/4 cup of butter listed on the package and lowered the eggnog to one cup. I think the added fat is important. I liked these cupcakes; they had the typical pound cake crust (which is the best part), and the dense, but not heavy texture. There really is only enough batter to make about 21 decent sized cakes. I did not like the frosting: It was tooth-achingly sweet (a pound of sugar plus the sweet eggnog!)and made me feel a bit sick. I noticed that others felt the same way, scraping off the frosting (though the kids didn't seem to mind). I agree with the reviewer who added a lightly sweetened whipped cream topping. I will try them that way if I chose to make these again. (Perhaps the eggnog whipped cream on this site). Without the frosting and with the change in the cupcake recipe these would get four solid stars, and would definitely earn my recommendation to both eggnog and pound cake lovers.

Super easy but fancy! Eggnog and nutmeg add perfect holiday flavor. Dense, moist cake and thick yet light frosting.

I really liked these. It is thick like pound cake. Smells and tastes like eggnog very good. I brought them to work for a Christmas party and everyone loved them. I even got a joking marriage proposal because of these cupcakes haha.

Super simple and delicious! I got 21 cupcakes out of the batter, and accidentally used a whole 8oz. cream cheese in the frosting (oops), but it worked out fine. Everyone I shard these with today loved them...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great taste with the pound cake mix. . I added a splash of rum to the pound cake and skipped the frosting. Just whipped up some heavy whipping cream to thick and then added in a splash of egg nog and 1/2 t rum to whip cream frosting. Spread whipped cream in each cupcake and sprinkled on nutmeg. put in frig til tight before serving. Also used Nog made with coconut milk.  Super yummie.

While the flavor was good, the cupcakes were just too dense. I think I would try using a white cake mix next time instead of a pound cake mix.

It was great but I think that it tasted better with the homemade cake batter, not the cake mix because that way if you donÂ´t have  cake mix  you don't have to go out and buy some

Loved this. So easy and every one said how good they were... tried to make them with homemade eggnog,  they were not as good but that's probably my issue making the eggnog.

These were a hit!  Great eggnog flavor, pound cake texture. I did add another 1/4 cup of butter as some reviewers suggested.

Amazing! People keep on asking me when I will make them. I did use yellow cake mix because I was not able to find the pound cake mix, but they turned out perfect.

I changed up the recipe by using pumpkin egg nog, which gives it the perfect thanksgiving/Christmas twist. However, i did have issues with the icing. After making it twice and coming out with a very soupy looking product, I remade it with one tablespoon of egg nog (instead of 1/4 a cup) and adding some pumpkin pie spice to give it more of a pumpkin flavor. It still came out more soupy than I would have hoped for, but it was way better than the first batch with the 1/4 cup of egg nog.

I'll be honest-- I've never made the cupcakes, but the icing recipe here is absolutely incredible!  I use it to ice eggnog cookies (also from this site) and it totally makes them!!  Is a Christmastime must now.
