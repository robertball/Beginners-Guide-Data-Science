Was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I replaced milk with buttermilk and just greased the muffin cups instead of lining them.  I took them to a last minute dinner party and got rave reviews over them.  Great warm with butter.  I will make these again.

What happened? I followed the directions EXACTLY. My biscuits would not come out of their paper liners. I should have just greased the muffin tin I guess. I'm new at this cooking thing and that's why I tried this simple recipe. We did manage to eat the tops of the biscuits which were fluffy and delicious. However, half of the muffins were wasted. Did I do something wrong again?

My family absolutely loved these biscuits.  I didn't have any shortening, so that was why I decided to look this up in the first place. It was fast, it was fluffy, and it was delicious.  I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone with little time and a big appetite on their hands!

I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used 2 cups All Purpose flour and added 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I sprayed my mini-muffin silicone tin (24 count) with Pam spray and spooned the batter in. Baked for 30 minutes and they came out perfectly! This is good as is, but would also make a great base for other batter flavors (cinnamon, garlic, cheese, etc....). Definitely a keeper!

This is the best biscuit recipe I have ever found.  They bake up very nicely but for even lighter fluffier biscuits try substituting buttermilk for the regular milk.  This makes it a 5-star recipe.  I just drop them on a cookie sheet coated with non-stick spray.

Surprisingly easy, yet soft and delicious. The reason I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think they could benefit with some flavor add-ins. I tried some shredded cheddar, chopped chives, and garlic powder and they were great.
Note: This recipe works just fine with skim milk and light mayo for those trying to watch calories!

Easy and delicious biscuits!  No mayo taste at all.  They baked up very nice.  I highly recommend using buttermilk as others suggested.

I love this recipe! These are very good, and easy to make. I did not like the idea of making my biscuits in a muffin pan so i kneaded them and made them into regular biscuits,and when they came out of the oven i rubbed some butter on them. They turned out very beautiful. Slightly sweet, and yummy.

These have a funny texture.  They don't have the texture of a biscuit or a muffin to me. Looking for a typical biscuit? Look elsewhere.  I scaled the recipe to 5, kneaded about 5 times & rolled the dough out. I baked on a Pam coated cookie sheet for 18 min.  They cook up beautifully. At first I didn't like these at all, but I changed my review after eating one that had cooled to room temperature. They are much better eaten cool rather than hot out of the oven.  I would make these again any time.

This was my first attempt at EVER making homemade biscuits and man was it ever a hit! I will keep this as my always "go to" biscuit recipe. The reason I gave it 4 stars was simply because next time, I will roll them out instead of making them in a muffin pan. Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe was so easy to make. I even had my 10 year old son help out. My kids usually complain everytime we have a home made meal, but this time they loved it! The biscuits are great when eaten hot with lots of butter or gravy. Don't use liners, use a spray such as PAM instead. I also recommend using buttermilk as well.

These biscuits taste really good, but I know next time I am just going to grease the pan because the biscuits would not come off of the paper cups.  I ended up throwing all of the bottoms away.

The texture & taste was more like a muffin than a biscuit but I liked that they were A LOT healthier than real biscuits (if you use fat free mayo as I did)... the sacrifices I make to keep my waistline in check! I plan to test the other biscuit recipes on this site that call for cream cheese or sour cream instead of the usual butter or shortening  before coming back to this one.

These were NOT "southern" at all! The mayo made them a waxy texture instead of flakey... and everyone knows biscuits are supposed to be flakey, right? I thought maybe the mayo would be a secret, magical ingredient but was definitely proven wrong. Sorry for the bad review!

I just pulled these out of the oven... very yummie.  Not really buscuit-like, but very good in their on right.  I used fat free mayo because it is all I had... I was a little afraid because baking with fat free stuff sometimes doesn't turn out right, but these are very good.  I baked them until they were golden brown and a little crispy on the outside.  I didn't used paper-liners.  Just sprayed the miffin tins with baking spray.   VERY EASY to make and definitely worth a try!

My kids loved this, which I did not think they would since they are used to the tube rolls. Made for Thanksgiving for the first time and they all disappeared. Next day my son asked me to make more. Used salt (1/2 tsp) and baking powder (2 tsp) with all purpose flour. Also used mini muffin tins and sprayed with olive oil. Finally an easy recipe to replace tube rolls.

We had breakfast for dinner tonight and I realized I didn't have anymore frozen southern biscuits.  I made this recipe and I honestly do not think we will ever buy frozen or refrigerated biscuits again.  These were so easy to make, and so light and fluffy.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  It was a huge hit with all of our family here in Alabama.  Good southern cookin'!

The texture was very strange - much like a muffin, not much like a biscuit.  Additionally, they stuck so badly to the muffin cases that I lost half of each one just trying to get them out.

I don't have self-rising flour so I threw in some baking soda and baking powder. (a little too much I think)  That's the only change I made and these are fabulous!!  I was afraid with the sugar they wouldn't work so well for biscuits and gravy but these are superb and is the first recipe for biscuits that I didn't screw up on!  Yay!! Thank you Thank you!

I've never been able to make good biscuits until this recipe.  These were great and so easy.  I sprayed a muffin tin with cooking spray and they came out of the pan with ease.  Love this recipe.

These biscuits definitely were easy! True, they are more of a muffin texture but delicious with jam or honey. I covered the tops of a few with sugar before baking and drizzled them with honey as soon as they came out of the oven. YUM! Will definitely make these again.

I just made half a batch for myself.  I should have made a full one!       I lightly oiled my AirBake cookie sheet and made drop biscuits out of them. Put them pretty close together so they could attach a little. 
I added onion powder, garlic powder and dill = Mmmmm!!!  
Might want to watch the baking time the first time in case it makes a difference from being in pans.

Use some water to get the paper off the cups if you're going to the look. For spead just grease you muffin pan or make drop biscuits.
These are best chilled, when they are warm they're more like sour-dough. 
These make a great bread to guests who aren't accustomed to the US bread.

I had to sub honey for white sugar (mom's on a health kick) so it came out a bit heavy but very very good. I think next time I'll try more milk or sub buttermilk. I made them as drop biscuits and they formed up very nice. Great recipie. What a suprise - you'd never guess there was mayo inside.

Yes they turned out great I didn't have self rising flour so I followed the lady that used baking powder and salt and that worked out great.   I made two batches the second batch I added a cup of dried cranberries.

An amazing recipe, truly quick and easy, I did not make any changes to the recipe, however poured batter directly into greased muffin pan, they were perfect. A definite recommendation for dinner parties, etc. great reviews from my family.

Fast and easy recipe. Results were tasty light biscuits.Added 2 tablespoons of poppy seeds. Used buttermilk instead of regular milk. Will make again and try different add ins, grated cheeses, garlic, seasonings. I made jumbo biscuits. Put butter on top to brown them and under the broiler. These are like eating muffins!

They turned out ok, but were sticky and the bottom never fully cooked. I will however make it again. Because they are great for soup.

Tried this recipe since I had run out of butter and eggs but really needed to make biscuits. Absolutely delicious and easy. I guess there's a reason to keep mayo in my fridge now.

I'm only giving it 3 stars because I used Olive Oil Mayo and 2% milk...so my biscuits came out pretty, but were not fluffy, they were sorta flat. Still, they were tasty and made even tastier with sausage gravy; although not the usual type of biscuits you put with gravy. Used my Silpat mat to bake them on, so they came out beautifully golden on their bottoms without the use of Pam or whatever. Next time I'll either just make regular ol' biscuits or get the ingredients the recipe actually calls for:-/

These biscuits were okay, they taste a little to "mayonaisey." And they did not double in size either.

These biscuit were as easy as any I've ever made and quite good. My family was busy debating whether we should call the biscins or mufscuits next time I make them(because they're made in an muffin pan. lol.)

This is a good recipe when you are in a pinch for biscuits and are out of bisquick.  They actually turned out very good.  They had more of a roll consistency instead of biscuit, but they still tasted good with homemade gravy. I added a little bit of olive oil to give the biscuits a little more moisture as well.

These biscuits had a good flavor but tasted more like a muffin than a biscuit.  I also should have read the reviews before I made that because I did not use liners but a not stick tin and they still stuck, so make sure you use pam on your tins.

Easy to make, light and fluffy biscuits. I will definitely make these again, however, next time I will substitute buttermilk for milk as a couple of previous reviewers suggested, which I think would give them a little more flavor. Overall a good recipe.
