If you are looking for a WOW dessert, don't bother with this. However, if you just want a simple, quick to make treat to satisfy your chocolate craving, this will do the job nicely. Sort of has a chocolate pudding flavor, but a thicker texture, similiar to cheesecake. I will try crushing up the vanilla wafers next time. It is a little difficult to eat with them whole and it made them just seem stale this way. I doubled the recipe to make enough for my whole family and it easily made six. I actually think the filling mix would work really well for a chocolate pie.
