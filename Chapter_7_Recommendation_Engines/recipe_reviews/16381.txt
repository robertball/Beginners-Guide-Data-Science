We are not fond of the canned cheese soup. (tastes too sharp) I make a more subtle cheese sauce (see Great Cheese Sauce) and mix it with the mushroom soup. I get to control how thick the sauce is this way. This recipe works great on chicken breasts. If you want a faster version that is even better, saute the meat first until it is barely done, then cook in the oven for 25 mins.  Try brining the meat first,it makes the meat tender and flavorful.

Excellent recipe, will be a family favorite. I didn't have cheddar soup so I added shredded cheddar cheese and 1 can milk. Perfect comfort food.

I liked the way the recipe sounded.  After trying it, I was very pleased.  I added some sauted mushrooms to the sauce, and served it with steamed broccoli and rice, the sauce went well with everything!  It well deserves the 5 star rating.

We really enjoyed this dish.  My 21 month old son clapped and said "MMMMMM."  I used Italian seasoning, and the rosemary was a nice addition to the oregano and basil.  I also added 8 oz. of fresh mushrooms. Yum!!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a very good and easy recipe. The only changes I made was I used the block Velvetta Cheese and added mushrooms.  Plus, instead of using individual seasonings I just added 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning, onion powder and garlic powder.  I will be making this recipe again!!  Thanks soo much for sharing :>)

This was so delicious!! Instead of baking them I used the crockpot. They were so tender and the soup mix was excellent:) It was great on top of the mashed potatoes. I will be making this again! Thanks for a great recipe.

This is really good.  My family loved it!  I added a small can of mushrooms into the cheddar and mushroom soup mixture, because we love mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe. =)

I just made this and it was alright. I'd give 3.5 stars if I could. I added a thing of mushrooms and Italian seasoning. I thought the canned soups would be salty so I did not add any salt, and my biggest complaint is it's pretty bland even w/the herbs. I also could not get the milk and soup to blend, and even after baking the sauce was kind of lumpy. It would need to be cooked stovetop to blend I suppose. I think next time I'd add some onion, and I couldn't even taste the cheesiness so maybe a little grated cheddar on top would be good.

I followed exactly using thin boneless pork chops.  My family loved and requests all the time.  Serves up well with rice or mashed potatoes. An easy week night meal.

This was a great tasting and easy recipe.  I made a few changes:  I used regular pork chops (cheaper), which I seasoned w/ paprika, cayenne pepper (for some kick), onion powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder, dried oregano, and thyme.  Then, I used 3/4 of mixture during the initial hour and poured in the remaining 1/4 after flipping the chops. It turned out great. The sauce was thick and very creamy. I served this w/ spinach mashed potatoes.  My husband was very pleasantly surprised.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This was soooo easy, and delicious too.  Meat was very  moist and tender.  I think I will try different herbs next time, wasn't crazy about the basil, oregano combo.  the left overs were great the next night over hot pasta.

This was really good and I will be making it again but I'll use less basil and oregano (maybe a little more than half.)  Also, I used regular milk instead of canned and Ragu cheese sauce because I didn't have soup.

This was really good.    My picky 11 yr old son even thought it was good.    However I thought the gravy was runny.   I saved the left over gravy to use again with egg noodles.

This recipe did not work for us AT ALL. The sauce was lumpy and the steaks came out tough. Not sure where we went wrong, but I don't think I will try it again.

I didn't change a thing on this recipe.  It was so easy, the pork was almost tender enough to cut with a fork, and the whole family raved about it. We'd eat this over and over.

This recipe is simple and delicious. I've never cooked pork steaks before and this recipe made my first efforts a success. We didn't have cheese soup, but broccoli cheddar soup was a great substitution. The meat was tender and well flavored - delish!

I thought this was delicious! Of course like most, I  can't ever follow a recipe down to every detail. I did follow one poster's suggestion and seared the pork steaks first, then cooked for a half hour. It seems to me 1-1/2 hours would dry them out. Other than I threw in random spices and also added some sliced mushrooms and onions to the sauce. Added a nice touch. My boyfriend ate TWO of these bad boys! I'm sure I'll make again.

This is so good it is "company fare".  Used cutlets the first time and they work just as well as the thicker steaks.  It's one of the few pork recipies in my recipe book.

I've made Mushroom Pork Steaks many, many times.  I thought I would try this one just for a little variation.  My family was torn.  Some of us liked it better with the addition of the cheese soup, and some of us didn't.  I was on the latter team.  I'm not crazy about the "fake cheese" taste that's present in this.  I've tried a couple of recipes that use the cream of cheddar soup and I think I've just decided that I don't like it.  It can certainly be left out of this recipe.  I made this in the crockpot (like I always make the alternative) and the meat was very tender.  I think you could easily add cheese to this if you're wanting it to be cheesy.  Certainly, I may try that, but I think I'm going to steer clear of the cream of cheddar from now on.  Thanks!

Rated it 5 stars because it is so easy. I used two pork steaks so I only used 1/2 can each of the soups and 1/2 cup of milk then seasoned to taste. The remaining soups I mixed together and put in the freezer for next time. I also topped my steaks with parmesean cheese.

This was my first time cooking with pork steaks.  They were a little bit too fatty, but the meat itself came out very tender.

I followed the recipe exactly. I wasn't Impressed. I Will Make it again with some changes. so right now I rate it a 2.5. the recipe could use less milk maybe more cheese and a tad more season. I'll send another post here with me he changes in make. but I do think this recipe has potential

I think with some tweaking, more seasoning, less milk, I would like this more.

Really good!! I read alot of the reviews before I made this.  The only things I did different is to add some Italian Seasoning and Garlic salt. Just a little bit. I also added shredded cheese instead of the cheese soup. This will be a recipie  that I use often.

I halved the recipe but still used the entire cans of soup and just 1 can of milk, mixed so there were minimal lumps.  I added a small can of mushrooms to the soup mixture.  I seasoned the steaks with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder and then covered all with the soup mixture. I covered the pan with foil to keep the meat tender while baking. I didn't turn the meat after an hour, but instead added some sliced new potatos to the gravy. I then baked another 30 minutes. It made an ample amount of thick, rich gravy.  Outstanding and received rave reviews!  Will definitely add to the rotation - thanks for the great recipe! Served with Roasted Cauliflower Steaks- yummy!

It was tasty over rice, but I found it not much different from ordinary mushroom soup pork.  I used shoulder blades, and cooked it in a skillet to cut down on cooking time (only 30 mins this way.) Next time I'll try it with a cup of shredded chedder instead of the chedder soup.

These were really good. We used the gravy over rice. Delicious. The pork was so tender you could cut it with a fork. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Ok, I changed some things in the way I made this recipe. First, I didnt have any cheese soup, so I melted velveeta processed cheese in with the mushroom soup, added a can of mushrooms, and use d1 can of skim milk. I did not use oregano, I used onion powder, garlic powder with parsley and seasoned salt over the meat first, then I poured the soup mix on top. I think the basic recipe was good but I added my own extras. Everyone in my family loved it and so did I. Thanks for sharing!!!

Like tenderloin boiled in water, this is tenderloin boiled in 2 cans of soup. It tastes cheap, takes 1 1/2 hours to cook and soup is still watery when done. A real waste of a nice cut of meat.
