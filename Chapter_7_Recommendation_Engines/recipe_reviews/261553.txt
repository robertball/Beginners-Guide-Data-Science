I was happy to try this recipe as I had been looking for a savory pie that used a frozen pie crust. I followed the recipe exactly. When I took it out of the oven, it was very soupy. The liquid was running across the counter there was so much.  I baked it longer but did not improve. It was a soupy mess....not like a pie at all. Will not make this again.
