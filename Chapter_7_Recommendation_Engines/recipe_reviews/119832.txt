This was tasty!  I did add some cumin and omitted the hominy (I didn't have any).  It was simple to make and is definitely a good blend of flavors.

This was great. I changed it a little based on what I had at home. I used cheddar cheese and mixed it in the vegetables and added cayenne pepper instead of jalapenos. This was absolutely delicious. I will definitely make this again and again.

Used summer squash and cheddar. Fresh corn made it great.

Really tasty. I sauted some onions first, added in the zucchini, some garlic and then tossed in the hominy. I used more hominy and more zucchini and left out the corn. I used wedge of garlic herb cheese and cooked this on the stovetop.. delish!
