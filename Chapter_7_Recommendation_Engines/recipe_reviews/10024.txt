I have tried a few recipes for cut out cookies and by far this is the best one.  The best part being that you do not have to chill the dough first before rolling it out.  I also had to actually use more flour than the 2 1/2 cups, but that wasn't a problem.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Great recipe.  I ended up adding about 3 1/2c flour and to get it out of the mixing bowl and then had about 1/2c on the counter for rolling etc.  I also added some lemon extract.  Was a great little extra taste that you really couldn't taste in the dough, but the finished cookie was awesome.  
I frosted them with royal or butter cream icing and they always are a hit.

This recipe is quick and easy to make but I was not thrilled with the taste.  These cookies were not buttery at all!  I found them to taste way to eggy.  Three eggs is too much for this recipe.  Butter cookies should taste buttery not eggy!

I think basically the recipe is a good one, except in the recipe it says 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour, but I used much more than that to get the recipe ready to roll.  After I did that it was fine for rolling out and baking.  I did ice them for more flavor.  I would make them again.

Yes you prob will need to add more flour. One of the best things I love about this is I made this to go with a train cookie cutter set for my mom and kids for Christmas. The recipe worked great and since kids were already Hyper enough for me we decided not to decorate them and it was perfect. It wasn't over sweet and it tasted great. I recommend this for any mom trying to find something with less sugar for their kids to eat.

This recipe was wonderful! My five year old daughter had a blast making these. I did add a little more flour and refrigerate for a couple of hours but she got to cut them out and decorate them. We made these for something to frosting and add sprinkles to so they were sweet enough and the recipe served its purpose.

These didn't work for me either. I had to add way more flour to get the dough even remotely workable. It rolled out fine after 30 mins in the fridge, and the cookies puffed up quite nicely, but they tasted really eggy (not at all sweet and/or buttery) with a dense/dry texture.

Pretty good. It was very sticky at first so I refridgrated the dough and it worked out well. This recipe definetly needs icing though.

Altho I found it to take MUCH more than the 2.5 cups of flour stated, these cookies are WONDERFULLY buttery, they cook up quickly and lightly and we experimented with thickness and found that, except paper thin, they taste great no matter how you roll 'em.

I don't know if I did something or not but these never got to a consistency to roll.  We ended up dropping them.  They tasted fine but nothing fantastic.

These were not something to write home about.  They were just OK, not particularly flaky or tasty.  I thought the butter was too much.  I won't make them again.

The recipe was easy and fun to make! I didn't have vanilla extract so I used coconut, it filled the house with a coconutty flavor!

Also I didn't know what to grease the plate like thing with, so I heavily used a stick of butter on the metal plate like thing... And I put an m'n'm in the center of each cookie! I'm so proud of myself! Thanks for the recipe!

I've never made bad cut-out cookies before trying this recipe.  After having to add more flour they (of course) came out tasting like flour.  Waste of time.

It is a great recipe. Fast and easy cut out cookies. I actually thought it was too many eggs so I only used two and used a lot more flour than 2 1/2 cups. Next time I'll try other flavors. Thank you for this great recipe

I agree with the others about need a LOT more flour than stated in the recipe...I thought maybe it was because I used 3 large eggs - maybe next time I will use just 2 or buy smaller eggs! Great taste in the end though and the kids had a fun time decorating them :0)

This recipe was too wet; and after adding all of the flour needed to roll them out the cookies are tough and dry.  However, the few that I did not cut out and rolled into balls had a fantastic taste.

This recipe was easy to make and tasted really nice.  The kids and I did add another half cup of flour in order to reduce the stickiness of the dough however.  I also cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup and added a splash of orange juice.  Turned out great - the kids gobbled them up!

It was ok but it took forever to keep the mold together. They taste like the inside of bread. I'm more of a sweet tooth.

This recipe required more flour than than the 2 and a half cups to make it not sticky.  I quit adding flour after 3 cups and put the dough in the freezer.  Chilled, it was easier to roll out.  Because of that reason, I think that it would be difficult for kids to make.  I added lemon zest and fresh ginger (shredded) for more zing and I would recommend icing.

These cookies are great! I did have to add more flower, as some others have. So I added a little more sugar and vanilla and these cookies turned out killer. I also dropped spoonfuls onto my cookie sheets, just to be different. They came out light, fluffy, and d-e-a-licious!!!
