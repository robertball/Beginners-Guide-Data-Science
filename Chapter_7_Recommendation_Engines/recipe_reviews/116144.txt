I used the shortcake section of this recipe and quadrupled the recipe (don't forget - this recipe only makes 2 servings unless you change it).  I formed a large circle about 3/4 inch thick with the dough.  I cut it into wedges, as you would for scones, for a better presentation.  I didn't have any lemon zest or lemon flavoring, but these were perfect for shortcake anyway.  Good, simple recipe, and the best I've had yet!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because I didn't follow it exactly and it was still really good.  Instead of making individual portions I made the shortcake recipe for 6 and made the top and the bottom huge.  I don't think I flatened it  enough so it was too "cakie" and a tad hard but still tasted fantastic.  The family loved it, it looked beautiful, will make again!  I'll post the picture I took.  P.S. I put the lemon zest in the dough, but didn't include the lemon butter because my husband doesn't like a heavy lemon taste - it was perfect!

This was delicious.  I made it for me and my boyfriend.  We both loved it.  The portions were really big too.  You could even make it into four shortcakes and it would be just right.  I used fresh cherries instead of strawberries and I didn't have any lemons but I did have lemon extract so I used half the measurements for the lemon extract.  It turned out perfect!

The lemon zest really set off this shortcake. I didn't bother with the lemon butter, though I'm sure it would have been yummy. I did add vanilla to my whipping cream and strawberries - and also added just a touch of balsamic vinegar to my strawberries.  It was incredible!

Wow!  These were so yummy, and my family of 6 agreed!  The touch of lemon gave it such a fresh flavor...I did cheat and use Cool whip to save on prep time :)

This recipe was simply wonderful!  The lemon added the perfect touch.  Dividing the dough into fourths made for the perfect individual servings.  I served these at my daughter's second birthday (she doesn't like regular cake and frosting) so I quadrupled the recipe to make sixteen shortcakes.  YUMMY!!! Oh...and I didn't use the lemon butter either and it still tasted scrumptious!

I was skeptical when these were cooking.  It took me 17 minutes before they were fully cooked and still did not brown as much as I wanted them to, however the taste was amazing.  I omitted the zest from the dough, and used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I did use the lemon butter which was great because it prevented the shrotcakes from getting soggy.  Had I used zest in the dough then i feel the lemon would have been to overpowering. The shortcake was pretty dense but very moist with a crisp outside.  I don't normally like shortcake because its just to bland but these turned out awesome.  Now if I can just get them to brown on the top better....

This is a fantastic shortcake recipe.  I did double it to serve four.  I used half white/half wheat flour.  I also used one egg rather than 2 egg yolks.  It stood on it's own as far as the dessert no need for strawberries or whipped cream.  I did not include the lemon butter.

I did not have lemon, so I changed the recipe to serve six people, and with those revised amounts of ingredients, I eliminated the lemon.  It called for 1/2 C of milk plus one tablespoon.  I eliminated the extra tablespoon of milk and instead used 1 tablespoon of grand marnier.  I also flavored the butter with about two teaspoons of grand marnier (to three tablespoons of butter) and ommitted the lemon.  If you are making your own whipped cream as suggested in the recipe,  you can also flavor it with grand marnier to taste.  
It came out great!  I am sure the original is great too, but I would suggest trying this version also as it adds an extra elegance to the flavor.

Very neat idea with the lemon butter. The only problem was the biscuits didn't turn out fluffy and moist. Bu then again, I did use ww flour.

Absolutely delicious! I love lemon and strawberries, and so I whipped up this shortcake and it took no time at all. Simple and easy, I would make this again!

This was delicious! the dough was actually crumbly rather than sticky so I added the egg white of the egg I used and it was much better. 
I could have done without the butter too b/c it made it super filling, but all in all this was easy to make and nice to eat :-)

Yummy!  I kind of skewed the recipe a little.  I have such a hard time making recipes exactly the way the directions say. lol  I didn't care for the idea of lemon BUTTER (I'm sure it's very good, just didn't sound good to me).  So I made my own concoction...  1/4 C FF Yogurt, 1/4 C sour cream, 1 tblsp of Agave and the lemon zest and used that instead.  I layered one tblsp of my lemon mixture then a tblsp of FF whip cream then the strawberries.  YUM!  My hubby was raving about it.  We had it for dessert last night and then breakfast this morning.  =D  The lemon flavor does make it a whole new dish.

The family loved this.  Although my son asked that next time I make it into "a strawberry longcake" instead of a shortcake.  He wanted seconds and we didn't have enough.

Our shortcake was a bit dry.  I'm not sure what I might have done wrong..I overlooked the fact that the recipe served so few people, so was a bit disappointed by that as well.

I would rate this with 6 stars if I could, the cake was moist and perfectly light enough for my taste.  The addition of lemon zest in the cake was amazing - kicking myself for not doing that earlier. I even added a little zest to the whipped cream. Strawberry shortcake has always been my favorite dessert, so I've tried plenty, and this was the best I've ever had!

This is by far the best shortcake I have ever tasted. As an added bonus, it is very quick and easy. The only change I made was to use whole milk since that's all we have, but that didn't seem to affect the recipe. My daughter and I split one and are already planning on eating the other tomorrow.  They come out too big for one of us so next time I will spilt into 3 or 4 instead.

I'm new to this kind of shortcake (grew up with the spongecake kind), but I've been converted.  Moist, a little crumbly/flaky, not too sweet and the lemon makes for a great flavor.  It reminds me of a good scone.  I'm making it again this weekend, this time gonna top it with a berry medley and fresh whipped cream.

This was a great dessert.  The lemon added something extra and having fresh whipped cream made it that much better.  You can do without the lemon butter but if yu ahve the time it's worth a try. I've made this several times and will make it many more again.

This recipe turned out so great - the shortcake was light and not too sweet.  Simple instructions that produced a great product!

The only complaint I have is that it was difficult to cut each shortcake circle in half. I would recommend making four, thinner circles. Tastes good and is fairly easy to prepare.

It was really good. I really liked it. I didn't have lemon zest but it still turned out delicious.
