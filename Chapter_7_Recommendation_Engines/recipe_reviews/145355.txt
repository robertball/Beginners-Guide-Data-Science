I used whole wheat flour instead of AP flour, regular sugar instead of sugar substitute and buttermilk instead of regular milk. Because I've cooked with oat bran before, I knew to let the batter sit about ten minutes so the mixture would have time to thicken up and soak up some of the liquid. My kids ate their pancakes with my homemade strawberry-banana jam on top and loved it. I'll make these again--very simple and used pantry ingredients that I already had which I appreciated. Next time, I think I might mash some of the bananas and use them in the actual batter recipe and cut the milk back a bit.

Forget the whipped cream and fudge sauce. These are delicious with just the melted strawberry preserves, and probably a bit healthier that way too. My family loves these pancakes. I did use just plain oat bran, I don't know if that is different than oat bran hot cereal, but they were good either way. Great way to use up bananas too ripe to eat alone-- and easier than banana bread.

This recipe was delicious and most imporant, quick and easy.  We decided to to mash all 4 banans that the recipe called for; we then used two bananas in the actual pancake batter and combined the other two mashed bananas with 3 tablespoons of natural peanut butter and used it as a topping. We also sprinkled a bit of wheat germ in the pancakes while they were cooking to give them a little toasted flavor and healthier kick.  Enjoy!

My family absolutely loves these!!! They are probably the best tasting healthy breakfast out there :) I misread the recipe the first time I made it and mashed all the bananas and put them in the batter. This makes the batter seem super runny and it won't thicken much even if you let to sit for 10 minutes, BUT the pancakes come out amazing anyway! So I've stuck to doing that since. They are super moist, the flavor is so yummy and we look forward to them every weekend. Sometimes, I add in a handful of bittersweet chocolate chips for a nice twist. My husband eats them with maple syrup but I find them perfect as is or with a little bit of fruit preserves. THANK YOU so much Smuckers! You've turned Sunday pancakes into a healthy treat :)

Half the recipe (still using a whole egg) makes 6-7 pancakes about 4 inches in diameter.

A healthy and tasteful alternative to the usual pancakes! I left out the sugar, as I think banana is sweet enough, and the preserve (or maple syrup) adds sweetness as well. 
I followed another review in letting the batter set for 10 minutes, then added an extra egg and extra milk because the initial batter was too thick (my first batch of pancakes looked like heaps of baked porridge)
 I also added some grated lemon zest.
Will try with some added vanilla flavour and extra banana mash next time, or maybe blue-or raspberries
