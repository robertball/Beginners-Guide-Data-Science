Amazing delicoius drunken cake! Tastes wonderful but beware of the alcohol content, the whole cake is submerged in a wonderful dry, smooth rum. If you like to relax and drink, this is the cake for you!

I thought this cake was terribly dry and tasteless. I will agree with one of the other reviewers that the rum/pineapple/coconut mixture was good. I made it for the 4th of July and luckily it was just family who tried it as I honestly would have been embarassed to serve it to guests. No one wanted another piece or to take any home so I'll end up throwing what is left away. I read other reviewers comments prior to making it so made sure I increased and made larger holes but it still was very dry and tasteless. I would recommend making more liquid as there seems to be an insufficent amount of liquid topping for the size of the cake. If making this for company, I'd recommend giving it a trial one on yourself first to be on the safe side.

Wow, this really is a tasty cake!  I made this cake exactly as stated in the recipe for a small dinner party with friends last night. Everyone loved it!  Two words of caution; 1. make sure you grease the pan thoroughly including the top.  Mine was so fluffy that it actually rose above the top of the pan and stuck.  2.  Make sure you have plenty of clearance in your oven for it to rise.  I have one of those stoves with the double ovens and mistakingly used the small one on top. Not a good idea! (Was baking bread in the big oven)
All in all a winner. I will definately make this again!

The rum/pineapple/coconut mixture was delicious, but the cake, unfortunately, was not as moist as I would want. I guess the sauce did not penetrate to the bottom of the cake. I would definitely make this again, but maybe next time I will poke holes in the bottom and fill the cake, then after an hour turn the cake right-side up, and penetrate the top of the cake with the sauce.  I'm sure that would be rummy and delicious!

This is so easy to make and great for picinic's. I have made it 4 times in the last month for a party or picinic.One tick is to turn cake upside down pour some of the juice into the bottom and then the rest on the top with pineapple pieces and coconut. It's great people are asking for the recipe

I made this in a bundt pan.   I found the actually cake recipe light, fluffy, and good. Mine was not dry. I made more of the sauce and the end product was super moist and delicious. Loved it and will make again.

The pineapples make this cake really really moist.  Great!
