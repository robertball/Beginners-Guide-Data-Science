I only had tenderloin, so that is what I used, I'm dairy free, so used almond milk.  With these changes it was excellent for our family.  Will definitely make again.  35 minutes on High pressure made the pork very tender.

Loved this! Had to put my own stamp on it though. I doubled the recipe and used pork tenderloin, 1.5 T green chili powder.  I also had to cook the meat much longer than in the instructions like by 25 minutes to get meat browned and water absorbed. I used canned (2 small cans)  chopped green chiliâ€™s strained and pressed to remove water . Added red pepper flakes, and used half the corn and added the other half as baby Lima beans. Was delicious!!
