9.2.17  For my own personal taste, I did cut the sweetener in half, otherwise, followed the recipe (although I did give it a squeeze of fresh lime).  The texture is a little creamy, and it’s a nice variation on ice tea which I dearly love and drink all year.  Joely, thanks for sharing your recipe.

Delicious and refreshing! I didn't bother taking out the blender. I used my plastic shaker bottle with the wire ball, and it was all mixed in 30 seconds. I used Stevia and cut back by about half the packet, and it was sweet enough. I liked that it was light and a nice change from the thicker smoothies or shakes. Thanks Joely, I'll surely make this again!

This is actually a fairly flexible process. To be honest the really, really good quality matcha is 100% worth it, but pricey, so I don’t use this much Matcha in the drink. I drink 16oz with 1tsp matcha powder, and it’s better than the Starbucks version. After a while Soy leaves me feeling less than great, so I use rice milk or Ripple milk. Rice milk is a little thin. For unsweetened, dairy free milk I use less than a 1/4oz honey by weight. I warm it gently on the stove and once the milk is the temp I want to drink I whisk the matcha in. A really good quality matcha powder won’t clump. I use Akira Matcha from Amazon. I usually also use a dash of Vanilla extract. You could also sweeten it with raspberry simple syrup - it’s a really unique treat. I do that once on a while.
