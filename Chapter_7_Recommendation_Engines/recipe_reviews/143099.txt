I made this recipe for a dinner party and it turned out really well. I baked it over some fetuccini and a little extra sauce and it made a great meal. Thanks a ton.

I made this tonight but there seemed like there was a lot of steps so I skipped the baking step. I used chicken breast that I flattened dipped into the egg and I also added garlic powder to the seasoning. I used Italian bread crumbs for a little more flavor and I used canola oil in place of the veg. oil, the caesar dressing was a nice touch.  Added the sauce and let simmer for about 10 minutes.  Added cheese to top of chicken and covered pan till cheese was melted.  Turned out pretty good.  Thanks for the post.

Awesome recipe!! Husband said its even better than his chicken cordon bleu...I marinated the chicken with caesar dressing when I bought it and put it in a foodsaver bag and froze it and so I skipped the flour and egg and beat the chicken breast and then dredged it in bread crumbs made of cereals (great solution for cereals that dont get eaten) and then fried the filets...came out awesome, oh yes and I added salt and pepper and italian seasoning before I baked it.  The Caesar makes the chicken tender and oh so flavorful!

The whole family enjoyed this dish. I put the dressing right on the chicken before adding sauce. It adds a lot of flavor. I also used a recipe for the sauce from this site recommended by users. It was very good to serve with spaghetti under it and it went farther that way. I fed 7 people and I had seconds :)

Very good and not very hard.  My husband is a chicken parm fanatic so I was nervous, but he loved it.  I used Panko instead of break crumbs and it worked great.

This was the first meal I cooked all by myself and it turned out wonderful! I was very pleased with how easy it was to make, and how well it turned out. Even my boyfriend was surprised! We were a little nervous adding the Caesar salad dressing in it (we aren't big fans of it) , but it turned out great!

Absolutely delicious! The first time I made this exactly as written, and it was great. Having made this many, many times now, I can tell you this recipe is just as impressive for company as it is for a weekday dinner. Since this recipe is a staple in our rotation, I don't measure out any of the ingredients anymore...just eyeball everything. I generally add some garlic/onion powders to the breadcrumbs, and sometimes even add a healthy dose of Italian seasoning as well. I've used panko as well with success. I use more sauce and cheese than indicated due to family preferences. I always use Caesar dressing (a good dose!) right atop the chicken, and then lay a slice of provolone cheese over that. I finish it off with additional sauce, mozzarella and parmesan cheese and a sprinkling of basil, which makes for the most tender, juicy chicken ever! This is a contender for my favorite recipe from AR to date. Pure cheesy, saucy deliciousness!

This was quite good.  I think I will use Italian bread crumbs next time for more flavor.  I just simmered on the stove top, skipping the baking step to save on a dish to wash.  I served with spaghetti noodles.  I will make this again.

I did not care for this. The issue is with the Caesar dressing, absolutely no reason for this ingredient as it does not mix well the sauce and mozzarella.  Also, do not use normal pasta sauce--huge mistake.  Start with a plain tomato sauce and add cummin, paprika, salt, pepper, tish of hot sauce, to taste then add half a medium onion and 5 garlic cloves which you sweat for a couple mins. in a separate pan.    Much better and our friends/family raved.

Good stuff.  I would not recommend doing as other reviewers have directed and double dipping the breading.  That makes the breading too heavy.

Tastes exactly like a local restaurant's Chicken Parm!  Husband loved it and my 7 and 3 year old loved it too!  Really easy to make if you prep first.

This sounded really "worky" but wasn't too bad at all. I added noodles to it and used ranch dressing rather than ceaser and my family loved it. We'll definitely make this one again! Loved it!

This rocked our socks off! Everyone in my picky eater family LOVED this chicken. I didn't top with the Caesar dressing but followed pretty closely other than that omission. I used a homemade batch of marinara I had frozen this fall. It was wonderful. It was a bit of a mess but was well worth the time and effort.

Great result for breading the chicken, I would recommend adding italian herbs/spices if you like more flavor.  Maybe the Caesar dressing provides the unique flavor I was missing (I didn't have Caesar dressing).  It was a big hit with my family anyway & many requested seconds!  We'll use this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing :)

Great flavor, I have made chicken parmesan before but this was much more flavorful because of the Ceasar Salad Dressing. On this receipe I also used Panko bread crumbs, it made the crust more crunchy.  you have to try it!!!

Great recipe! I simplified it a bit and didn't use the flour, but I coated the chicken in breadcrumbs twice. Also, I left out the parm and mozza cheese all together, just because I didn't have any in the house. I know cheese is a chicken parm key ingredient, but it was amazing without it and I don't think I'll include it next time I make it. Thanks for the VERY simple, quick and yummy recipe!

This is a great recipe for chicken breast.  My wife typically does not like the "dry" white meat part of the chicken, but this recipe had her asking for more.  Simple and effective.

I've made this dish for my friends and I.  Everyone thought it was great and I personally found that noodle went very well with this dish.  I'd love to make it again.

This was the best chicken parmesan recipe I have had.  I did what another review said and added the dressing on top of thechicken instead of the sauce.   I also put the chicken in the fryer instead of pan frying it, but otherwise followed the recipe as directed.  Everyone enjoyed it very much and I will be making this again.

Not a favorite at my house.   Made for lunch today for parents and husband.   My husband was the only one that cared for it.   The ceasar dressing was a mistake.

I prepared this meal last night after coming home from a long day at work. Not only was it easy, but it was delicious. I added red bell peppers and it came out great, enjoying some right now for lunch.

Great simple dish that tastes good. The Caesar dressing added a different taste. Good, but a bit too much. Will cut back on the dressing next time.

4.5 Stars. Simple and Very Tasty. I, too, put it over some type of pasta and it's a great meal that everyone likes.
