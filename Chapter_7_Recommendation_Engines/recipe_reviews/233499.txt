Not the biggest fan of lamb, but I definitely  enjoyed this! The white wine seasoning made the roast tender, while every bite flavorful. Because my family is fond of the two, I added dashes of savory and tumeric to the seasoning. A pleasant surprise.

Followed the recipe as written except I added more seasonings and roasted it for 45 min.  I've made lamb many times before but the wine sets this recipe apart from the others.  Along with the amazing flavor, the meat turned out quite tender.

Came out very tender and the recipe is simple. I did use champagne instead of plain white wine and a touch of rosemary in with the spices as my only deviation. I would recommend it as it made a delicious lamb roast for me and my husband.

I followed directions to the “T”.  Way too long cooking time.
