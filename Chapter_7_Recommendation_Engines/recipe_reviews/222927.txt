I made this twice and received many compliments on this salsa.  I didn't want it too spicy, so I left out the jalapeno pepper.  And I didn't have cilantro, so I left that out too.  I was so fresh and delicious that no one noticed!  I will definitely do this again the next time I get banana peppers.

This was very good! Pears in salsa is a nice twist. I omitted the cilantro because I am not a fan. Served with chips and it went quickly!
