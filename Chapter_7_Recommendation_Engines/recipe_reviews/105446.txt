I did not care for these.The peanut butter flavor is ok, but the chocolate has no flavor because it is unsweetened.  If you're looking for a reese like flavor, these are not it. I'll stick to using my splenda in coffee. I feel like I wasted a good jar of peanut butter and a lot of time on these. :(
