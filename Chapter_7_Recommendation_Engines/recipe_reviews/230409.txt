I absolutely LOVE the name and so jealous I didn't think of it!  This is a standard drink combo at any bar, nothing special.  But, if you haven't tried it before, the cranberry gives a nice sweetness to the grapefruit.  For me, you MUST use Ruby Red grapfruit juice - white won't work.  Ruby Red Absolute is one of my all time favorite vodka's, but if you use Ruby Red grapefruit juice, you don't have to buy the RR vodka.  I also like adding lime to it.

I used Smirnoff's Whipped Vodka instead of grapefruit vodka which made it taste creamy. Very, very tasty.
