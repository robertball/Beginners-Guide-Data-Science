World's Best Turkey Chili Haiku: "Not quite the 'world's best', but that doesn't mean not great! (Less corn, more spices!) We thought the corn was overkill, and maybe using 1/3 - 1/2 c. frozen corn would've sufficed over an entire 15.25 oz. can. I used an AR chili seasoning blend instead of the overly-sodium-fused store packets, but still felt that this chili was lacking a little je ne sais quoi, which resulted in me topping mine w/ healthy squirts of Texas Pete, cheese, cilantro, and Fritos. Thanks for the recipe, John Chandler!

I made this dish just the other day for my wife and I, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. I took off a star only because I had to adjust the spicing slightly to make the recipe meet its true potential. Overall, this was a hearty, delicious meal that was perfect for a winter day.

Great simple recipe that's even better as leftovers. I used Mrs Dash chili seasoning and a can of Rotel for the tomatoes. Thanks for sharing a quick, inexpensive hearty meal.

Love this chili! It is delicious by itself or aS part of a larger meal. Try it with Fritos for a true Texas treat.

Not bad, but pretty wimpy since it relies on a chili spice mix pack for its seasoning. I had to add more chili powder to get more taste.

Amazing!! I substituted the chili mix with cumin, chipotle chili powder, and creole seasoning (for an extra kick) and topped it with sour cream, guacamole, green onions, and cilantro for a south-of-the-border spin. My boyfriend ate his bowl before I even finished writing this review! I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is so delicious - the only changeS I made were to add a can of Ro-tel tomatoes instead of plain ones & I used frozen corn because I didn't have canned. My whole family declared this to be their new favorite chili

I made this for dinner tonight. It was quick and easy. The only change I made was to use left over turkey from Thansgiving. Don't worry the left over turkey had been frozen.My husband said he would give it 8 out of ten which I think is great.  I don't 
like spicy food and this was mild. I used the mild packaged seasoning. Adjust for those who like it hot.
