This was quite good.. a little more seasoning added for my tastes. Pickled ginger is really a must for this..

I made a few changes.  I did not have pumpkin, but I added frozen corn kernals and lima beans, as well as shredded napa cabbage.  I used a braised tofu which is a little more firm and tasty.  Additionally, I used about 1/4 vegetable broth, and 3/4 boiling water for the base.  I added the miso the bowl, and added some broth, and then stirred to blend it, then added the veggies.  I cooked the noodles separately, and put them in the bowls to serve.  Overall it was delicious!
