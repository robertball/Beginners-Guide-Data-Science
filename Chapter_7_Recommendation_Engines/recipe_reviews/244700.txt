This was an easy, tasty way to make beef soup! I used the carrot chips in a bag & frozen beans & peas. I used Umami Taste #5 in a tube for the tomato paste, it added a great punch! I also skipped the flour since Yukon Golds tend to thicken everything. I will be making this one again!

I thought this was okay, but I did feel the need to add some spices such as onion powder, salt and black pepper.  If I were to make it again, I would add some chopped onion to give it a little more flavor.

This is good.  I do saute and add sweet onion and celery to this recipe.... and a little Chipotle smoky pepper.  Adding the  tyme makes this taste a little more hearty like beef stew..... I like making vegetable beef soup with leftover pot roast and juice from the crock pot.  Thank you

I added diced tomatoes and that was very goo too.

For my first ever beef vegetable soup it actually came out pretty good. I actually mixed this recipe with the recipe that my mom uses flower I mixed cornstarch and hot water and port a little bit of it into the soup mix and then I took the drippings from the beef tips and marinated the potatoes in that. I used Frozen mixed vegetables and I put that directly into the soup slash broth mix. after I marinated the potatoes and the beef tip drippings I poured the potatoes and the beef tip drippings into the soup which helps make it thicker on top of the cornstarch mixture that I used in the broth and I also added a lot of water and then let it cook down. Actually turned out really great I'm going to also make beef Stromboli to go with it and I think I'll be good

I added mushrooms. Also used some leftover French onion soup in addition to the beef stock. Tripled the recipe for the number I had to feed.  This is a great one to keep handy.

Well I didn't have any carrots or green beans, so I added more potatoes and used a small can of tomato paste instead of 2 Tablespoons. It was very tomato-ey and very delicious. Good soup for a cold day.

Iâ€™m very happy with how this turned out. I did use a whole can of tomato paste and a can of diced tomatoes instead of peas. I also used cornstarch instead of flour. Very happy and will definitely make again.

Nice and easy soup recipe. I used some canned vegetables instead of fresh since I didn't have some of the fresh items. Definitely will make again.

This turned out DELICIOUS! I put my own little spin on it but I put garlic powder and season salt on my meat while I cooked it to give some flavor and then once everything was cooking together I added season salt and garlic powder and salt and pepper to the broth and it was delicious! Only added about 1/4 can of tomato paste to it also but it was so good! The whole pot got eaten in one day!

Pretty good base recipe.
I'd suggest adding a little more flavor (chopped onion, minced garlic, maybe?).
I love this kind of soup because you can add anything you have on hand: mushrooms, peas, zucchini, green beans, cabbage, etc.  I even had a little quinoa I added.  Great comfort food!
