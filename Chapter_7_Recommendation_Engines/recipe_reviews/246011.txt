These are the best tasting brownies ever. I have been making this recipe for over 30 years now and I won't change a thing. Fudgy, nutty, chocolatey, what's not to like? Try them, you'll love them.

These were really good. the recipe was easy to follow. The batter is very thick which lends to the dense fudgy goodness. They had a wonderful crust and soft fudgy center. I didn't have nuts in house so I subbed chocolate chips. I did top them with ganache but they were great on their own.

I used baking cocoa in place of the  baking chocolate squares Also I doubled the recipe so it would fit a 9 by 13 rectangular pan. The recipe came out great and I will make it again.

only cooks for about 22 minutes and brownies were perfect. I omitted walnuts, and substituted powder baking cocoa for the squares. Otherwise made as written, excellent taste, and texture.

disappointed :(  I was expecting a rich dense brownie but what I got was more cake like.  It was fluffy with just barely there chocolate flavor.   it is good but not at all what I was expecting. I followed the recipe exactly.

Very good! The consistency was perfect and the amount of walnuts was just right. I think I'll use just a smidge more chocolate next time, just personal preference.

I enjoyed the texture of cheese brownies but to be honest I think both the texture and flavor improved drastically by the next day.

These are some of THE BEST brownies I’ve ever made and/or tasted!!!!! Bravo.  The only thing I’ve ever changed is sometimes I’ll substitute Crisco Baking sticks for the butter.  Typically if I’m in a hurry and don’t want to wait for butter to soften.  So so so yummy....you won’t be disappointed.

I've always loved brownies if they have nuts in them but the store bought ones never impressed me. I decided to give this recipe a try and I LOVE them. My mom usually doesn't like brownies but she couldn't resist these! The batter was just the right consistency and the brownies came out moist and scumpsious. You can even add pecans or other nuts but walnuts are my favorite! 100% recommend!

This is a really good recipe with some tweaks. First, the bake time was too long; I checked it at 40 mins and it was already darkening around the edges.  They were great hit but a little dry after completely cooled.  I will check at 30 mins next time and not exceed 35. I also must just prefer a richer chocolate brownie because I only used 3/4 cup of the sugar and they were plenty sweet and I also added more baking chocolate (and will add even more next time).  Good texture and very quick and easy!

Loved it! One minor addition along with all organic ingredients, a teaspoon of almond oil.
