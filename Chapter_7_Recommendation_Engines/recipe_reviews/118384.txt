This turned out very good. I tried it with thighs instead of the breast cut. Will definitely use this recipe again and again!.

I've been making this chicken for years.  It is the recipe for barbecued chicken that is in the old (circa 1960) Better Homes and Gardens cookbook. (The one with the red checkered cover, although my cover has been gone for years).  The only difference is that the BH&G's recipe had celery which you brown along with the onions.  My kids were raised on this chicken and it was requested often in our house.  Seeing the recipe here reminded me how good it is.  I'm going to have to make it again soon now.

Delicious!  I used this on boneless chicken breasts, so the cooking time was decreased by 2/3.  The sauce was phenomenal, and my husband just raved about it!

great recipe! Only thing I changed was cooking in crock pot instead of oven....and I also sort of marinated mine in liquid smoke and hawaiian sea salt about an hour before I put in crock pot. Chicken was very tender and had great taste. Would have worked well w/o my marinating though.

This recipe is really good and definitely a kid pleaser!  The sauce is excellent on mashed potatoes, you may want to double it for this purpose!  I've used it on everything from boneless skinless chicken breasts to bone in chicken pieces.  Highly recommend this recipe.

Great chicken! I used the bone-in breasts and removed the skin. I made my sauce first,adding in fresh minced garlic and sauteed it with the onion in 3 tablespoons butter. I used prepared yellow mustard instead of the ground. I seasoned my chicken liberally with Emeril's Essence before browning it in olive oil. I used the original recipe for this chicken not this lightened up version. I also used cider vinegar, not white. It was delicious and smelled sooo good while cooking. My family loved it! I served it will buttermilk mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. I will make this again for sure!

I'm a picky eater and found this to be very good.  I didn't have the mustard on hand, so I did without.  I didn't really like the onions in the mix, but that may just be because I didn't chop them up small enough for my tastes.  My boyfriend liked this though, so I'll probably be making it again.

Good bbq flavor. Sauce easy to put together. I marinated and cooked on the grill instead of the oven. I was planning on using what I held out to add on once plated, but used as basting sauce instead. I will have to make it again just to taste the sauce, but the chicken tasted great! Thanks!

This is a great/easy/already-have-all-the-ingredients-in-you-kitchen kind of recipe. I make about 10 boneless breasts at a time and double the sauce.  I cube up the leftovers and toss them with mayo for some really tasty chicken salad sandwiches.

This is my favorite recipe for barbecue-flavor chicken!  I used sucanat in place of brown sugar.  I squirted a good dose of prepared mustard in since I don't have dry mustard.  I could just suck up the sauce!  But the chicken turned out great, too.

The sauce is great and the chicken baked up juicy and tender.  This is a great alternative to using the outdoor grill to have BBQ chicken.  This recipe was simple and easy to make with ingredients that are usually on hand.

This is a great recipe! I love that it provides a BBQ sauce recipe within because I live abroad and it is impossible to find a BBQ sauce without going to a specialty store. I follow it to a T mostly but I use 1t dijon mustard instead of dried, and I use chicken legs (not just the drum stick but the thigh too). I bake at 350 for 45 min and it turns out perfect every time.

Well, since I went into the kitchen to clean up and nothing but bones were left, I'd say this was a hit! Also, it was really easy to put together and the chicken was very juicy! Good recipe, thanks!

Great simple, quick, and delicious recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts pounded thin, but what I really want to review is the barbecue sauce. This sauce is just sooo good. Even my boyfriend said this was just about the best sauce he ever had and he use to work at rib joint. I have used this sauce not only on my chicken but also on ribs. Great recipe!

This was great!  I used about 12 skinless boneless thighs and dredged them in a bit of flour and browned them in olive oil and smart balance.  I doubled the sauce.  The chicken was moist and tender baked as instructed. The sauce was awesome and great on some mashed red potatoes.  Will definately use this recipe again.

Great flavor and a nice weeknight meal with out too much fuss. I used dried minced onion. I did butterfly the chicken breasts. We all liked this dish the way it turned out. The sauce was spicy but very good too. Thanks!

This turned out great!  I had requests for the recipe.  Didn't have ground mustard, so I replaced it with prepared mustard, and used boneless chicken breasts instead of bone-in.

Wow, where has this recipe been all my life?  This is absolutely delicious. I am impressed.  The bbq sauce was simple and the chicken was tender & juicy.  My children asked for more and that always adds a star in my book.  I am definitely keeping this one close.  Thanks for sharing this, I'm glad I finally tried it.

Very good as is.. after tasting it, I decided to kick it up a bit and added 2 tbsp garlic powder and 1 tbsp minced garlic.Also instead of the chopped onion , I used  2 tbsp onion powder and for a kick added 2-3 dashed of hot pepper sauce. With these additions its a 5 star recipe. Will use again.

I've been craving BBQ chicken lately, but I hate messing with a grill. I found this recipe and it reminded me a lot of the way my mother used to make BBQ chicken. It turned out GREAT! I used thighs, because I like dark meat. I added a little Liquid Smoke and a tablespoon or so of prepared BBQ sauce to the sauce mixture. I will definitely make this again and again!

This was delicious. I only had 2 very large chicken breasts, bone in, but I made the full recipie of sauce. Glad I did. I made up a rub of equal parts of sage and dried parsley and added some garlic powder, cumin, salt & pepper. Rubbed chicken with it before I browned it. Will definitely make this again.

Very good sauce! I used 6 boneless skinless thighs and 2 boneless skinless breasts. Next time I will double the sauce. I baked them on a large cookie sheet and they turned out great.

I just made this and it is really good.  There were a few things that I did a little differently; I used apple cider vinegar, used both dijon and whole grain mustard since I didn't have dry mustard and I used chicken thighs, but it was still yummy.  I would love to try the sauce on pork.

This was great. My husband really enjoyed it too.  I followed the recipe with a couple of exceptions.  I didn't have any ground mustard so I used about 1 tbsp of prepared and I also mixed white wine vinegar with white vinegar about 50/50. Even my three year old loved it.

Excellent recipe although I ended up using pork cutlets instead.  I thawed out what I thought were boneless chicken breasts but turned out to be pork.  I followed the recipe as written using the pork and it was delicious and thoroughly enjoyed by all 8 people at dinner. A good idea, as at least one other reviewer has suggested, was to increase the sauce.

Best Sauce Ever.  I added garlic powder & used cider vinegar, but white vinegar was great, too!

My family loved this chicken. I had everything I needed in my cabinets.  I just double the sauce. I didn't have chicken breast so I used drumsticks and it was still great.  I will make this recipe again

This was really delicious. It definately had a tang from the vinegar, but my hubby and I both love vinegar, so this was just perfect for us.  Everything came together really quickly.  I even used Ore-ida frozen chopped onion for added convenience.  The only change I had to make was I used boneless skinless chicken breast tenders, so I just cut way back on the cooking time.  I didn't even finish "browning" them completely in the skillet because they would have been completely cooked through.  I'll bet this sauce would be outstanding on ribs - I think that's what I'll try it on next.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

We liked this quite a bit.  The sauce was nice and barbecue-y, but obviously if you're looking for smoky, carmelized flavor, you're not really going to get it here.  I used all boneless, skinless breasts, so didn't cook it nearly as long as recommended in the original recipe.  I also used a pan that was too small but didn't think to decrease the amount of sauce I used, so there was more liquid in the pan than recommended and the sauce didn't reduce or thicken much (kept the chicken moist, though).  I think next time I'd use about half the sauce, since the pan I used was about 8X8.

All in all, great (if not exactly RAGINGLY authentic) barbecue flavor, and quick and easy!  And the sauce is yummy.  Perfect for a weeknight.
