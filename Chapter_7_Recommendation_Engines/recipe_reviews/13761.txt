Excellent!  Fun to make.  Followed recipe to a T and it turned out perfectly.  A bit on the rich side so you only need a small slice, but sooo delicious.  Also, quite sweet.  Next time I'd cut the sugar by l/2 to 3/4 of a cup.  Otherwise, wonderfully tasty.  Ingredients are a bit pricey, but worth it.  If you don't like cakes with dried fruits, but want a festive cake, this is definitely the one.

This is a recipe my grandmom used to make and I have the recipe the only difference is that when you do the oj mixture you put it on let it cool and then wrap in foil for a week and set if fridge.  then bring it back out and do the oj mixture again you might have to use toothpick or something like that for mixture to go into cake.  everytime you eat it when through wrap in foil and put in fridge.

I was VERY leery to make this cake, but my girlfriend insisted it was delicious.  She was right!!!  My teen-aged daughter, who hates coconut, would not stop eating it and my husband, who eats mostly healthy things, said he has become addicted to this cake.  Personally, my daughter and I thought it was best still slightly warm.  (But we still loved it days later.)  My husband felt it improved with age.  No matter what the cost (it wasn't cheap to make) I will be making this cake again and again.

My mother made this every Christmas since the 1960's. The only difference - her recipe called for only 8 oz. of dates, and added 2 tablespoons of grated orange peel and was baked at 325. She always used a large (16 x 5 x 5) loaf pan. In recent years, I've been the one who bakes it each December. The cake always collapsed when the glaze was poured over it, so a couple of years ago, I tried heating the glaze in the microwave first. It works! The cake remains full size.

This has become a family tradition--and is now requested by our friends as well.

It's actually not that labor intensive (unless you're a box mix person)-- just a few more ingredients than normal. 

Snip the candies with scissors and purchase chopped dates to cut down on prep time. (BTW: Don't even try to make it in a bundt pan--not big enough)

Wrap in with plastic, then foil. Place in the refrigerator and turn twice a day for the first couple days. It helps to distribute the orange juice more evenly through the cake.

I had originally got this recipe from my mom which she had got it from my aunt.. anyways Its an old fashion southern cake. I used this same recipe on here.. Major tip : You leave the cake in the pan over night, it helped to let my pan set in a very warm water bath for about 1-2 mins then attempt to flip it out. Mine wouldnâ€™t come out until I did this. Hope this helps J

When I was a little girl, my grandmother would make this cake for my birthday. She has since died and we've misplaced her recipe. This is the closest I've found. One difference that may help is that instead of an orange juice glaze, she soaked paper towels in juice and wrapped the cake completely with the towels. The juice soaks in to the cake! No sticky mess and less sweet. GREAT!!!

The cake was good, but I had problems getting the cake out of the pan the next morning.  I finally heated the pan for a few minutes in the oven.

This recipe has been in my family for 30+ years. The only difference is they added 1 cup raisins, I don't care for raisins so I add 1 cup crasines. Since cranberries go so well with oranges it makes it more scrumptous. I do wrap my cake tightly in plastic wrap then again in foil wrap & store it in the fridge at least 1 wk, turning it over every day so the juice doesn't settle on the bottom. It definately gets better over time!

This has to be one of my alltime favorite holiday recipes. My mother used to make this every Christmas but due to arthritis she can't mix it up so I now make it, no problems with the kitchenaid mixer. As for the cake being expensive the only thing I find pricey is the nuts but I have always used walnuts which are cheaper and in my opinion much better than pecans in this cake. I also substitute dried pineapple & raisins for the dates (half pound of each). One last tip: dip your knife in flour as you cut up the orange slice candy, it makes it much easier.

Fairly expensive to make and very labor intensive. A lot like a fruit cake..which some people will not even try. All in all a good recipe. Make sure you cook it the entire recomended time and do not keep opening the door to check it! It is low heat and will be ok!!!!

My mom used to make this when I was a kid. She has been gone almost 2 years now and I was thinking back to the old days and remembered this cake and just for kicks typed it into the search box. Imagine my surprise to find the recipe!!!  

My kids and I are off to the store to get the stuff and make one right now!

This is a classic Southern recipe.  I had no difficulty making it and it turned out beautifully.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written with no substitutions.  It finished cooking in two hours exactly.  Delicious!

My grandfather and I made this for years until he passed away.  His recipe was his version with no ingredients to follow (measurements).  This is exactly it.  I did not have buttermilk so I added 1.5tsp lemon to milk then the soda.   I also make it in loaf pan for gifts.

Wow! My husband wants this every year for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays! Thank goodness he can help me mix it when it gets real thick, because my hand strength won't get me through this one. Man, I love orange slices. I'll have to cut them smaller the next time, because it leaves too large a hole when I sneak them out of the cake  right now. I soaked the cake overnight in 1 cup of OJ, but it still was too dry. I made a glaze out of OJ and powdered sugar, but I needed a sauce to spoon over the slices for more moisture when serving. I'll work on that for next time. Thanks for a really good recipe. With stuff like this around, being diabetic is a really big pain! I love orange slices a whole big bunch, if I didn't get that idea across before!

I lost this recipe or close to it (called orange fuit cake) years ago. I was thrilled to find it. This is SO good and everyone loves it. People who say they hate fruit cake are always suprised and delighted with it.
Thanks Carol

I've made this cake for over 50 years!  It's quite sweet and sticky; line the cake pan with parchment paper.  Toss the cut pieces of dates and candy in the flour so they won't clump together and won't stick to the sides or tube of your pan.  I like to make the cake in smaller pans and give as gifts, as a whole cake is a LOT to consume for any family.  Partially frozen cake cuts better; pieces should be small; a bit of orange zest in the orange juice/conf. sugar gives more orange flavor.

The cake had a fruitloop taste to it.  Was not worth the $15 it cost to make.  Less than a quarter of it was ate and the rest was tossed.

My mother used to make this cake every Christmas.  I was never much of a baker til a few years ago and I started looking for the recipe, and found it here.  She's been gone for almost 30 years, but baking this cake brings back lots of happy memories.  Love this recipe!
Update: I've made this cake twice in the last 2 weeks and it's still a big hit!  I  took it out of the pan when the glaze had all soaked in, (rather than let sit overnight) and it was perfect. My hubby cut up the dates and orange slices for me, and that was the hardest part.

I am so glad that I came across this recipe.  My granny used to make this when I was a kid and it was my favorite! She never used the coconut in it, but I love coconut, so it is a win-win for me!  Thanks for the memories with this recipe!

First time to ever make it this, as a memory to my grandmother, who always made it for my orange slice loving grandfather.  It's been at least 12 years since I have had this cake.  It tasted phenomenal!  I did only use 8 ounces of the dates, and I think that was a perfect amount.  Quarter the orange slices, and warm up the juice/sugar  for sure, and prepare for a potential mess lol.  I thought I would like it cold, but warming it up is much better to me!  I am very, very happy with this recipe!!!  Thank you!

This cake was a huge hit at our Christmas gathering! Everyone - even the pickiest kids - loved the cake. I used the trick of putting the pan in hot water for a few minutes in order to get the cake out of the pan. I also used kitchen shears dipped in flour to cut up the orange candies. This recipe is a keeper for sure.

This recipe has been in my family for several generations. It's always a hit. For a little extra kick, we always  add Grand Marnier liqueur (a tad more than a 1/4 cup  to the orange juice and confectioner's sugar  to pour over the cake. It really brings out the flavor.

This is the recipe we have used for over 30 years.  I had to bake it for 3 1/2 hours to get the tester to come out clean. It  was what I rememberd.

Modified this recipe by using 1 cup of chopped dates & 1 1/2 cups of chopped mixed pecans/walnuts. Also used margarine instead of butter. Baked in bundt pan for close to 3 hours at 250. Removed cake from pan and poured powdered sugar/orange juice on while still hot spooning reserve over the top.  PERFECTION!!
