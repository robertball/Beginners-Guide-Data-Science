I used a small tenderloin from Trader Joe's and so cut the recipe to 3 servings.  I gave a healthy dose of the salt and pepper but kept everything else the same.  The next time I would press the garlic rather than mince it so that it would make a better paste on the meat.  At 425 degrees it took about 23 minutes after I'd taken the meat from the fridge about a half hour before baking it.  At the very end I turned on the broiler to make the color a little better.  This is a very easy and very tasty meal.  Thanks for our dinner tonight!

Very well received by the family tonight.  They want it again next week.  Do not remove from oven at 145 degrees internal.  It will raise to close to 150 and now you have medium well pork.  remove at 136 internal and you have a perfect med rare piece of pork after resting.

This was easy, moist & favorable.  I made as directed with no changes. I took the roast out of the fridge, rubbed the seasonings on it  & let it sit for about 30 minutes till it reached room temperature before putting it in the oven.  Next time I make it I will do the same, not making any changes.

Pork came out super tender and moist.  Tasty dish, indeed.  Next time I make it I'll use half the pepper.  It was a tad heavy on the pepper but overall delicious.

I didn't have the  crushed garlic so used  garlic powder nor did I have rosemary and oregano so I substituted with marjoram.  My husband and I both loved it..very tasty and very moist.

This was my FIRST pork tenderloin and it was DELICIOUS!  I am no Julia Chiles, however am used to improvising.  I had no Rosemary on hand, but I DID have "italian seasoning" which included rosemary, oregano and thyme-which thyme was recommended as a substitute for rosemary. Well since I had NO thyme using the Italian seasoning as the rosemary worked out perfextly 

I cooked it 25 minutes and was slightly pink inside and crusty beown on the outside. I wanted to include a picture though not flattering    but i am technically challenged! I definitely will make this a regular for us!?

Easy & delicious. You'll want to keep an eye on the time though because we had to bake a lot longer to reach 140 degrees & we had a 1 1/2 lb pork loin. What I really liked is no overnight marinating like most recipes for pork loin I have.  Will make again
