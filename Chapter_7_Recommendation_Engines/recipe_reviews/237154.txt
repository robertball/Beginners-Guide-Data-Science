I'm kind of new to the smoothie trend, so I don't really know what to expect.  I followed the recipe closely, and after tasting, I added some vanilla and some agave syrup, which I think the recipe needs, in addition to more strawberries!  It has a nice consistency though, and stays thick.  I'll make again.  Thanks for posting!

By using soy milk instead of coconut milk, the fat content is reduced to 2.5 grams from 25.6. I used soy milk, a frozen banana, fresh strawberries and a little fresh mint. I enjoyed it.

1/2 cup of coconut milk proved too little to get the fruit and kale to liquefy in my blender. Doubling the amount of liquid did the trick, and it came out fine.

Didnâ€™t like it at all. Was too thick and you could taste the kale over everything!

This was easy to follow as far as directions and ingredient wise as well as being pretty delicious I will be using this as a breakfast supplement for the future.

Delicious. I always use a 50% watered down unsweetened fruit juice in lieu of milk.

This was my first smoothie with kale and it was delicious. I didn't have any milk on hand so I used orange juice instead to thin it down and it was perfect. Thank you for sharing.

The fruit/veggie combination was good. Even my son liked it. But mine looked nothing like the picture.

I did make changes. I froze the kale before I used it. It makes it crumble and it's easy to blend. I used 1 cup of Almond and Coconut milk, one small banana and one cup frozen strawberries. It was great. Thanks, oh, I also used a scoop of  Vanilla Slim Fast for extra protein.

Great recipe! My six and three yr olds loved it. This recipe also works great with almond milk and cuts down on the saturated fat found in coconut milk.
