I thought this dish was just perfect in every way and was loved by my family. We're garlic lovers so I did add more than suggested, otherwise, didn't change a thing. Thank you so much Reeni!

Recipe is delicious, however it is greatly improved by a fairly generous dose of fresh minced garlic and onion.

Really loved this recipe.  We doubled everything for the sauce except the lemon and it was enough for the pasta but the lemon wasn't too overpowering.  Would definately make this again.  It was as east meal!

I made this for dinner today, and it was fantastic!  I love TGI Friday's Chicken Piccata so I was looking for a similar recipe and came across this one, and I'm so glad I did!  I made a few changes and it was perfect. I read some of the complaints about not enough sauce and the sauce being too lemony, so I didn't reduce my wine to half and I didn't quite use 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  I also added marinated artichoke hearts and roasted red peppers.  I also increased my capers by about a Tbs. (We love capers), and I used dried basil instead of fresh parsley.  I also try to make lighter versions of my meals so I omitted the butter, used lite chicken broth, and I used whole wheat angel hair pasta instead, and even with the modifications this recipe did not suffer one bit--as a matter of fact, it tasted exactly like TGI Friday's version and my family LOVED it.  I definitely will be making this again.

So tasty! The garlic really did it for me but be careful with the lemon it can overpower the parsley.

This was such a hit in my house that my husband asked me to add it to our "Go-To" recipes list whenever we have company. I didn't change a thing, and it was wonderful!

This was awesome! My toddler didn't like it, but hubby and I loved it. It was a bit on the "tangy" side...which is why my toddler didn't like it. Hubby would have preferred it less tangy also, but I liked it that way. Next time, I will use a little less lemon, I think. Like a lot of the recommendations, I doubled the sauce recipe for the noodles and it worked out perfect.

Nobody liked this dish in my family. I followed the recipe exact except for adding some Tony's seasoning to the flour.  To my surprise, the noodles had little to no flavor, and the chicken had an overpowering flavor of lemon.  This recipe isn't even worth doctoring.

Was a great starting point for me, as I've never made Chicken Piccata before. I added a little more chicken broth and wine to make a larger amount of sauce. Overall, it was a great first attempt, I'm excited to try and again and refine it further!

This was absolutely delicious and simple to make!  I used "Real Lemon" from the bottle, and used just under the 1/4 cup, added extra capers (love em!).  It's very important you not over do the olive oil because it becomes the base for the sauce.  I used a lot for the frying as I used a large skillet.  My first time making Piccata and it was amazing.  It's a favorite dish in italian restaurants (I'm an italian cuisine snob) and this was restaurant quality.

I loved it! Because most people said that it needed more sauce I added an extra cup of chicken broth because I didn't want to have too strong of a wine flavor. I will definately make again!

I added the exact amount of ingredients and it just came out tasting like sour lemons. My husband and son refused to eat it.  Would not make again.

I just made this and it disappeared fast! I too used chicken broth instead of wine, and I didn't have any capers. If I had, it would've added a bit of much-needed punch to an otherwise bland recipe. Don't get me wrong, it was good and I'll make it again, but the flavor is mild for my taste.

I thought this lacked flavor. It was really bland. I even added extra garlic. I had to salt my food which I never do. Maybe it was the brands of ingredients that I used? I don't know. And yes I followed the recipe.

OK - improvised just a bit with the herbs - used lime juice (all I had).  FANTASTIC!  Made a double batch and between 5 of us, all gone!

This is a great recipe! I have made this many times and this is the easiest to follow recipe for newer cooks! I use a little less wine, a little less lemon juice and a little more chicken stock. Also, i use fresh squeezed lemons. I mix the pasta right in with the chicken and sauce and pour it all into a large pasta serving dish! Sprinkle with fresh parmigiano cheese and serve! All in all this is a great recipe and it is quick and easy. Thank You

My one and three year olds loved this. Next time, I'll add more capers and let the sauce sit in the pasta for a few minutes - the second helping was better! I also might not cook the chicken as long next time.

I made this tonight for hubby and I as I saw on site and was cooking chicken but wasn't sure how. We love lemon chicken and I have made piccata in past. Now with only 2 it is harder to get sauce. It was a treat as hubby is watching cholesterol and I forgot! I felt so bad after adding so much butter even after scaling down.I guess no dessert tonight! This watching is all new to us. Sigh!! So many good recipes.  Thanks. It will be awhile till the next time.

I love this recipe. I did make some changes to it though. I added a 1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese to the flour mixture. I also added sundried tomatoes and a jar of marinated artichoke hearts (drained) cut into quarters to the sauce mixture. My roommates and I both LOVED the results.

It was pretty good.  I didn't end up with quite enough sauce, perhaps I let it simmer to long.  I also think it needed a bit more flavor.  Good news is my 2 (very) picky children loved the chicken part!

I wasn't sure how I felt about this dish when I first tasted it as the lemon was so pronounced but it started tasting better and better and now I can say that I really enjoyed it. I followed the recipe except for the capers and parsley since I hate both. I may have reduced it too much, as there was not a lot of sauce, so I might double it next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing! Just make sure your family likes capers & lots of lemon. I found out mine does not, but I loved it! Tastes just like the chicken piccata I used to order at the fine dining restaurant for $23. I'll definately make this again, but just for 1.

Very good recipe. Love the capers, just wish there was a way to tone down the acidity of the lemon juice a little. Over all very good, I will make it again.

My WHOLE family loved this.....even my picky 4 year old! I followed the recipe exactly, but i accidentally cooked the wine down too much. So, I added 1 cup chicken broth instead. Turned out perfect!

The five star is for the flavor in this dish... Awesome! I did alter just slightly, I used sherry for the wine and just put the garlic in right after cooking all the chicken and before the wine. That way I wouldn't have to fish it all out since it was finely minced. I doubled the sauce but not the lemon! YUM! I loved it! :)

This was such a great recipe.  Being pregnant I have been craving chicken piccata and going out to restaurants was becoming pricey.  I did make a few changes.  I doubled the sauce recipe, used a little less lemon and added a small mixture of cornstarch and water to the sauce right before it was done to thicken it up a bit.  Finally, I used bow tie pasta instead of Angel Hair.  It was so delicious!!  My husband probably had two servings himself and it tasted great the next day!  Definitely going into my dinner rotation!

I’ve made this quite a few times. Love the flavor. I always double the sauce because I like my food saucy. I also use around 12-14 oz of pasta. No need for pounding the chicken thin if you don’t want too. I just slice the chicken breasts thin. Thanks for the recipe!!!

This recipe was awesome! It is quite lemony but we like lemon a lot so it worked out nicely. I added like four more cloves of garlic because I love garlic. the sauce was great tasting. There was only one thing that I felt was bad there wasn't enough sauce to cover the noodles  I made a cream sauce  to accommodate which nicely but next I'll not Let the wine reduce to half and see what happens

I've been making this dish for years! I recommend pounding your chick to tenderize it. That really makes a big difference! I serve this with Trader Joe's Lemon Pepper Pasta. I sometimes will throw some broccoli in the pasta water and/or baby peas. I'be also added artichoke hearts in with chicken. Great weeknight or special occasion meal!

I made it as is, but I used a little less pasta (6oz) so the sauce was sufficient.  I also had very thin chicken slices, so I reduced my final sauce cooking time from 15 to 5 because the chicken was mostly done during the browning.  Classic piccata is a lemony sauce, so this recipe was just right!

This was amazing. I did do tweaks though. I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the chicken before dredging it. I would make more sauce though. Most pasta is bought by the pound. The recipe calls for 8 oz. So the sauce needs to be doubled.

This was very enjoyable.  I added extra chicken broth and then added a bit of corn starch to tighten up the sauce.  And I cut back on the lemon just a bit and added more capers (personal taste).  Was great.  My wife loved it and demanded I print the recipe for her recipe binder.  Success!

This recipe is so delicious, and it's easy to make!  Depending on your mood, it is easy to tweak - sometimes I add a tad lemon juice if I want a more tart dish (it's already a little tart), or more chicken broth if I want a more rich dish. We eat a lot of garlic in our house so I increase the garlic a little by adding minced garlic or garlic powder,  I also chop up the capers and I always make extra sauce - my entire family loves the dish so it has become a "regular" on my rotation of meals I cook.  Don't let the steps of preparation scare you - this is a very simple recipe.  After you make it one time, you will be sold!  Making this tonight for the first time with gluten free flour, pasta and broth,

I made this for dinner tonight & it was awesome!  This is one of my favorite entrees to order at TGI Friday's & have been looking for a good recipe to try at home & this is it!  It's delicious full of flavor and just melt in your mouth good.  I will be making this recipe again.  I didn't change a thing, but will put fresh sauteed mushrooms in it next time.  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe my family definitely enjoys it!

I LOVED this recipe, and I don't give out 5 stars lightly.  
Tip: Be sure to get your pan very hot before adding the chicken, and then resist the urge to move it around as it cooks- let a nice brown crust start. 
There is nothing I would change, but I did add a little more water when adding the spaghetti because a lot of the sauce soaked into the chicken just before.

Great recipe!  I had no white wine on hand so I increased the chicken stock a bit, but that was my only deviation from the recipe.  Served with steamed broccoli for some color.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought this recipe was delicious! I didn't think the lemon was too strong at all. I added a little more garlic just because we like it so much, and no capers because I can't find them in the store, but it is one of my and my boyfriends favorets right now.

Love it! I used whole wheat flour instead of AP. Also i did mince a half an onion with the garlic. I have never had piccata but this was amazing, whole family loved it and will be making very very often, super easy!!

Made this last night and it was Excellent! No dry  white wine in the house, so I substituted Cooking Sherry and added the zest of one lemon to the sauce. Cannot wait to taste the leftovers!

I made this last night, complete success, and no leftovers!  I substituted the pasta with roasted potatoes.  The sauce was very tart—added extra chicken broth to lessen the lemon flavor (which I love but was concerned about my kids liking it.)  Wonderful recipe, can’t wait to make it again!  Thank you!!!

Very salty. Otherwise ok. I usually use a different recipe but wanted to add the wine. I had to thicken the sauce because it took too long and didn’t thicken. Could be why it was salty. But it was 10 minutes and everything else was done.

Tasty and easy recipe. I’ve wanted to make this dish for years, but until I found this one, I could not locate an accessible, non-fussy recipe to experiment with. I’ll search no longer. I did add sliced white button mushrooms and dry sherry. Otherwise, I was true to the written recipe. Make this dish!

This is a very tasty recipe.  I made a few additions. I used veal instead of chicken. I soaked the veal in milk while I gathered all the other ingredients.   I added some celery seed and smoked paprika to the flour.I added  onions, mushrooms and and some sweet red pepper.

I've made this twice but I haven't perfected it yet.  I'll update this review once I do.   I suggest not using white cooking wine, use the real thing.  I personally feel like this recipe calls for too much capers and wine.

Huge success - Easy to prepare -  Lucky me - I always have white wine, capers and chicken broth.  My husband requests it often.  So quick.  So delicious.  I don't pound the chicken flat - I cut it in half lengthwise and I think this technique leaves more extra chickeney bits in the pan to meld with the wine, etc.  It may take a minute or two more to fry.  Love it.

This was just ok. I followed the recipe, but found it to be too sour,(I did use fresh squeezed lemon), so I added probably a cup of broth. That helped reduce the sourness but I still found the whole dish rather bland. I took it to work and everyone liked it, but I think I will look for a recipe with a bit more flavor.

We loved it.  I agree with the people who doubled the sauce.  I cut the recipe in half but, after looking at the amount of sauce, we just made the full recipe and cooked our two chicken breasts and 6 oz. of pasta.  It was perfect.

Just found this recipe today. Needed sometching different.    My husband and I loved it.  Instead of capers, I used cut up green olives and just chicken broth.    I will make this again.

I made this for dinner tonight.  It was very good.  Minus the chicken amount, I would double the recipe as there was, in my opinion, barely enough "sauce" to toss the pasta in.

super easy to follow and comes together quickly. tastes like a restaurant!  I modified slightly for our taste .. but as written was great too!

Added mushrooms ...

Doubled sauce (to serve over WW fettuccini) 

Used sliced whole lemons in the sauce instead of just juice ... added a fabulous bite

Whenever I cook this, it is a huge hit. I follow the recipe exactly, except I about double the garlic, double the paprika, double the pepper, and use a little more olive oil, to increase the flavor. Also, the quantities are a little short for the sauce, you should make more if you plan to toss it with pasta.

way way too much lemon...made the sauce tried it ..took half of it and then added back some chicken broth and some white wine to kill off the lemon.  Good basis but watch the lemon. also wasn't thick enough so added more flower at the end for the sauce.

Awesome dish. I changed a couple of things to make it a bit more heart healthy. Baked chicken tenders with a lemon panko crust for about 15-20 minutes. Used 3 tbls olive oil and 2 tbls of flour to cook the mushrooms and garlic in. No butter, But pretty much followed the recipe other than that. After pulling the chicken from the oven, I put it in the sauce for about 10 minutes or so. I will use thin spaghetti instead of angel hair in the future. My husband and I loved it. Was very moist and my husband won't need another bi-pass..LOL

This took a long time to make and was a lot of work. I followed the directions, but because so many reviews said the sauce was too sour, I doubled the batch increasing the wine and the chicken broth but not the lemon or capers. I used fresh squeezed lemon juice. While my husband loved it, my two older kids wouldn't eat it and I ate it only because it was so much work to make, but it was so sour I had to sip water between each bite. Just way to sour. I think this recipe would be good with just a squeeze of lemon as the capers are sour enough. Will not be making this one again.

This tasted good, but was a lot of work and my daughter said "you could have just put some lemon juice on a piece of chicken and it would have tasted the same".

We thought this was just so-so.  The lemon taste seemed a little bitter, and as others suggested, I halved the amount.  I did use fresh lemon juice, but it tasted sour instead of lemony.  I also doubled the sauce per other suggestions and the pasta still was kind of dry and not saucy enough for me.  I probably won't make again, I'll keep looking for another piccata recipe.

I love this recipe.  I leave the chicken in serving size after pounding and do not use pasta but wild rice on the side and a vegetable. It is a family favorite!!!

This was one of the best meals I've ever had--tasted like something you'd get at a good Italian restaurant.  I followed the directions just as they are and it turned out great. Everyone loved it and I'll most definitely be making this again!

First had veal piccata years and years ago and loved it.  For some reason, I was thinking about that meal earlier this week.  I did this tonight and it was a big hit with me and the family.  Since I love garlic, I used two cloves and, as suggested by others, doubled the sauce to toss with the pasta.  This will certainly be a standard in my kitchen.  Thanks, Reeni!

The chicken was awesome but I don't think I had enough sauce left over for the noodles.  I made without the capers and ended up not having the lemon juice, but the chicken was still excellent.
