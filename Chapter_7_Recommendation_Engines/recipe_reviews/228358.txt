I like that the sweetness is provided by the apples, and not straight sugar. Unfortunately it is WAY too salty for my family's taste. The salt overwhelms the other seasonings. I would make again, with reduced salt, and maybe throw in a red bell pepper for a color boost. Thanks for posting your grandmother's recipe!
