This is reeeeeeallllly lime-y.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but it's a whole lot o' lime!  I think I'd like it better w/a healthy splash of cherry juice to tame the lime a bit.  It would probably also be better w/fresh lime; my bottled lime juice creating an unappealing "scum" on the top of my drink.   Cheers!

I bumped this up a little by using Ginger ale instead of Club soda and I added a 1/3tsp of Ollaiieberry Nectar!!! Delish!!

I made it and it tastes great! It's easy to mix and a good refreshing drink for the summer.  I didn't make any changes, but sometimes I swag the amounts and sample it till it tastes just right.

I had this with leftover Cajun food. Perfect! And I even used ReaLime.
