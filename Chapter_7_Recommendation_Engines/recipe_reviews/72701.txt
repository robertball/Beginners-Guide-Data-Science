I loved this smoothie! The papaya gives a nice texture. Since I used frozen banana and strawberries, I omitted the ice. I also omitted the sugar and I don't recommend adding any.

Excellent recipe, easy to prepare.  All I did was add a bit of Splenda to make it sweeter.

I didn't think it had much flavor. I tried to add honey, pineapples, and peaches, but it didn't work. My husband and I both threw ours out.

Execellent.  Great way to incorporate papaya into your diet. Have ended up throwing any fruit I have on hand, makes it even better, especially cherries.

This is delicious! just be sure to use the mexican papaya as someone said and not the flavorless hawaiian.   

I added a dash of cinnamon powder.

I used a frozen banana and almond milk. The frozen banana worked as the ice replacement. I didn't have any strawberries to add and it didn't need sugar. I was great tasting! I will try with strawberries next time, but if you want to avoid a trip to town you use what you have on hand and in this case it worked out really good.

I had bought this huge papaya thing from Walmart and I just wanted to add more fruit to the diet so it was a Mexican papaya and I used the whole thing. It was simple and good so that was cool.

Used blueberries instead of strawberries, and added a fruit juice blend instead of the milk.  Oh, keep a banana in the freezer for this - it really makes it great!

This was delicious - I wanted to make a smoothie with Papaya b/c it's so good for you. I didn't know it was taste so good! I made a few changes: used yogurt instead of the milk, added a few more strawberries, used only 1/2 the papaya, and added vanilla whey protein powder so there was no need to add sugar. It was very good and the papaya made it so silky and smooth - We will be making this again! Thanks!!

We used half a papaya and it was absolutely fantastic. Great late night summer snack/beverage. Forget the bikini, just drink it.
