If you live in an area where Hispanic grocery stores and meat markets are available, just tell the butcher to run it through the machine.  It's a pain to pound it, and it never is tender enough. I marinate it in lime juice, with 5 or 6 cloves of crushed garlic, adobo, vinegar, salt, and olive oil for at least 3 hours.  Then, you MUST grill it.

Very good!  Mild enough that my daughter could eat it, but absolutely perfect for the grown-ups with some sriracha added!

The marinade made the meat nice and tender. This didn't seem to have the flavor we look for in fajitas, though.

Still working on my grilling skills, so the meat wasn't as tender as I would have liked.  Also, not sure what beer to use since I am no beer connoisseur (even though I spent many years in the Navy... go figure!)  Overall it was pretty good, but between the recipe and my lesser than average skills, could have been better.

I was hopeful. Used a really nice beer to marinate the meat in. We really enjoy more spice! It was a great base, but we found we wanted sour cream, guacamole, and taco sauce. I also thought it was weird that the veggies were in with raw meat,  but the recipe doesn't instruct to cook them! I did!

Great flavor on the skirt steak!!  We only marinated the meat in beer and fresh lime juice and then seasoned it before putting it on the grill.  It turned out so tasty!  Cooking the vegetables separately, we realized we will need to season them as well, but overall, this was a fabulous way to make fajitas!!
