As far as pudding cakes go, I still like the ones from Paula Deen best but this was pretty good. I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a tsp of real vanilla extract to the sauce part before I poured it over the batter. I also used fresh peeled diced peaches instead of apples and nuts because I had peaches on hand. The larger pan took 45 minutes to cook but turned out like a yummy bread pudding with rich caramel sauce.Pretty tasty! The peaches were great in this. I will try it in the fall with apples and I might try using apple cider instead of water when making the sauce to make it extra apple flavored.

This recipe was delicious. I made it for my parents' anniversary and they loved it. One suggestion they gave me however was to increase the apples and decrease the sugar. As other reviewers have said, this recipe came out to be a little too sweet and too rich.  Still delicious and I'm sure with these modifications it'll be even more delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I was searching through for another cinnamon recipe and this seemed to fit -the whole brown syrup thing sounded a little, well a lot fattening so I just skipped it and made the batter, it was really quite nice-it  was more like bread than cake, you could even butter it plus it wasn't too sweet, the pieces I wanted a little extra sweetness too, I buttered and put a little bit of cinnamon/white sugar on top.

A BIG hit! Rich caramelly sauce and sweet cinnamon cake in a down-home and EASY dessert. I had my parents over for dinner and after dessert, my Mom said "this is a keeper". I think I will modify the dish slightly next time I make it. I will double the apples and stir them into the batter rather than leave them on top. I didn't have any problem with the sauce boiling over, I used a square pyrex dish and it was just the right size. Also, it's not as good at room temperature or reheated as it is warm from the oven, so plan accordingly.

Excellent! Thanks Matthew for sharing a family treasure. It was great the way it was, just as written. I made it twice, once as written, and once with a cut back to about 3/4 C white sugar and 1 1/2 C brown sugar. Both came out excellent with the second time being just a little less sweet. Baking for 35 minutes was perfect. I think some of the variations in oven cooking temperatures have a bearing on how the results turn out for some. I calibrate my oven to a digital thermometer occasionally to make sure it is working correctly. This recipe was quick and easy to make with ingrediants that are usually available in every kitchen and tastes like a lot more work than it is, my kind of recipe. Yummy!!

This is INCREDIBLE!! The cake bakes and floats to the top and the syrup turns into a luscious caramel sauce on the bottom. Do eat this warm out of the oven with ice cream or freshly whipped cream on top. AWESOME!!

I made this recipe as a finale for a Jambalaya dinner and it was a great hit.  Mind you, I substituted whole grain flour for the white and I added 1/4 cup bourbon to the sauce ,just before pouring it over the batter.  I used apples, no nuts, and we served it with ice cream. Fabulous.  Next time I'll make more sauce to have for the ice cream because there's no sauce left for the leftovers. Your grandmother was right (aren't they always?) This is a very easy to make keeper.

Made this again on 4 Dec but had some problems.  Now I understand some the previous negative reviews.  It is very important not to overbake this as the sauce sort of turns to jelly, not very appetizing.  I added some sweetened dried cranberries, Craisins, doubled the amount of apple and put them in with the dry ingredients.  Baked it in a larger pan, but I should have taken it out at the 35 minute mark, instead I left it for 40 and the sauce was not very nice.

I had a craving for something easy and cinnamon last night, so I whipped this up.  I'd never heard of pudding cake, so I didn't know what to expect, I just went from the reviews.  It seemed weird how the ingredients (no eggs, no oil) could turn into some kind of cake, but it sure did!

I gave it a shot and it's OUTSTANDING.  It kinda reminded me of a big warm muffin with sauce.  I didn't have any fruit, but I think I would try to add them if I made this again - just for the variation.  This would be a great brunch recipe!

I made with whole wheat flour and topped with apples and raisins.  Our family has a sweet tooth, but this is VERY sweet.  Suggest to use less sugar in the sauce.  Recommend to serve with alot of ice cream and a little cake.

This is an excellent pudding cake recipe!  Lots of rich sauce (secret is not to overbake - 25 minutes and it was perfect).  Next time I will also use the apples and/or nuts and raisins.  Very rich but yummy - especially with ice cream or hard sauce :)

The title of this recipe definitely should be Caramel Pudding Cake....yummy!!!   I halved the ingredients  using a 9x9 pan, it turned out perfectly.  If making a full recipe, I would recommend using a 9x13 pan. I placed the apple chuncks and nuts in the bottom of the pan instead of placing them on top of the batter. I like to serve the cake slices upside down so that the caramel sauce is on top.  Very quick and easy dessert.

it sounded weird, thinking it only has flour and sugar and water and sugar, plus some pieces of fruit thrown in... but I had faith, the other reviewers had been positive and so I went along: well, the result is very good, it's easy, quick, you cannot fail to have these ingredients, and it impressed everybody. I put the diced apple and dried cranberries both on the bottom and over the batter, used a 23x9 pan, and it came out perfect. It sure is good eaten warm, but we finished it off later without rewarming it and my little girl loved it! ty!!

Excellent!  But it should be called CARAMEL Pudding Cake!  I read some reviews and added about 2 1/2 c diced apple to the batter before spreading it in the pan.  I also omitted the walnuts.  Other than those minor adjustments, I followed the recipe exactly and it is absolutely scrumptious!  I love the cinnamon-y caramel flavor.  Can't say enough good about this one!  Thank you, Matthew!

This is a quick, easy dessert and a great way to use a few apples from the fruit bowl that have gotten a little wrinkly.  I decreased the sugar in the batter to 3/4 cup and in the sauce to 1 cup. I used about 1 1/2 cups of chopped apples. I want to try this recipe with other fruits like blueberries, cherries or peaches.

This was pretty good!  From a previous bad experience that I had with a pudding cake - not sure if it was due to high altitude and the recipe needing an adjustment, I added an extra 1/2 cup flour just in case.  Except for it bubbling over the top of the pan and making quite a mess (on a tray that I placed under it just in case it did that), I didn't have any problems with it.  I added raisins, too, and served it with a Sunday brunch.

This is a quick dessert but much too sweet! The apple flavor is over-powered by the rich caramel sauce.

This was a good cake. I had never had pudding cake before and this was a good first-time experience. I didn't have apples or walnuts :( So, I can't wait to try it with apples and walnuts. I'm sure it'll be even better! Next time I'll also try adding bourbon to the sauce and apples to the batter, like someone else recommended. Thanks!

mmmm perfect for me!  I love cinnamon and this was so good.  I didnt make it exactly just bc i didnt have enough sugar.  so i think i used about 3/4 cup white sugar and probally the same in brown sugar.  Because I didnt have enough brown sugar used one cup water and same amount of butter.  I thought it was sweet enough this ways as well. Used half whole wheat flour and added 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice and full amount of cinnamon. Oh ya and I also used unsweetened almond breeze instead of milk since I cant have dairy so very easy to make this recipe VEGAN!  Ok so bad about to have slice number 3

Very very very sweet - the sauce that is made isn't really a pudding, more like a loose sweet sweet caramel sauce. The recipe 'worked', but I don't think I'll make it again.

This was ok. I would suggest baking for 55 minutes. I would also suggest cutting the brown sugar by 1/2 cup. (I don't like overly sweet things. So I really don't think this is the recipes fault.) It had a nice flavor though. I used 3 teaspoons of apple pie spice instead of cinnamon just because I like it more. However I will use less next time because those spices are stronger than cinnamon alone. I used apple sauce instead of apples, this I liked because it make the sauce really thick. I will make it again. It is quick, and it serves my sweet tooth quite handsomely. I love bread pudding and this is more reasonable to make. I also want to use raisins next time.

I had JUST enough ingredients in the house to make this cake.  Plus, I ONLY had a 9" square pan.  But after I finished baking it, my flatmates and I DEVOURED it!  I went shopping today to buy an apple so that I can make it again tonight for my neighbors!

What a tasty recipe!  I think it would lend itself well to a variety of fruits - I'd like to try peaches next summer.  I think I'd use less than the full amount of sauce, though, because it boiled over in the oven and made quite a mess (or put it on a baking sheet!).  In spite of that, I'll definitely be making this again, because it was delicious!

This was outstanding!!!  Very very easy to make, with ingredients I already had on hand.  Everyone loved the gooey sauce on the bottom.

I put diced pears, apples, and walnuts on the top, and substituted spiced soymilk for the regular milk.  This cake disappeared in no time!

This is DELICIOUS!  I admit I was a little skeptical while making this...I have never made a pudding cake before so I didn't know what to expect.  The batter is much thicker than your typical cake batter, and when I poured the brown sugar "syrup" over it, I was really doubtful about how it would turn out.  My whole family enjoyed this with whipped cream, and I added a chopped apple on top of the cake.  The only problem I had was the syrup running over the baking dish and making a mess in my oven (it's forgivable though, with how good this is). I don't know if putting the baking dish on a cookie sheet would affect the baking process, but I think I'll try that next time.  Thanks, Matthew, for a great recipie!

This cake turned out great! I used a 9-inch round pan instead of square. I topped it with 2 Grannysmith apples and chopped pecans and served it with whipped cream. I'll be making this again for sure!

This took 10 minutes longer for center to test done; however, seemed to be overdone when I dished it up. Thought the water mixture would sink to bottom and form sauce, but it didn't. Was pretty good, but don't think I would make it again.

Made exactly as the recipe called.  I think it is good.  After a second helping, the SO requests that it be made when his sisters come over in a few days, meaning it will be a hit with the British.  If served warm, a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a bit of custard might enhance it.

This was really disappointing to say the least.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and what I got was not at all what I expected.  I the apples stayed on top of the cake and the syrup just ended up disappearing.  I didn't over cook it so, yah no idea.

This was delicious. I cut the cake sugar to 3/4 cup and the sauce sugar to 1 cup. I added 5 small apples to the cake and a handful of chopped walnuts. It was great served with vanilla ice cream. Everyone wanted seconds. I think I will cut back on the cinnamon next time I make it and add a little vanilla.

Very good! I followed other reviewers' advice and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup each and added a dash more cinnamon. Next time i think i will double the cinnamon!

This is amazing and so easy!  I reduced the brown sugar and added maple syrup and extract.  Gooey pancake taste.

Very yummy, very sweet.  I took the advice of others and used a 9x13 pan.  Glad I did.  This dessert is best on the day it is made.  The next day it was a little to soggy.  I will make again.

Yummy!  Really good.  Put raisins on top instead of walnuts.  My husband is allergic!  Still was really good.

Took others advice from the start & reduced both white & brown sugar. I used 3/4c white & 1c brown in the recipe. This is an easy cake to make & good both warm & cold. I will use more apple though & put some in the cake batter. My husband wanted to rate this higher, but told him 5 is tops.

YUM!  This was the first time I have ever made a cake like this (I'm glad I read the other reviews or I would have been very worried about the consistency of the batter).  It tasted more like bread pudding to me (and that isn't a bad thing!).  I loved the way it looked when all of the apples and nuts cooked up.  And, of course, it was soooo simple to make--something with ingredients I generally always have on hand.

I guess we're the *odd* ones. My family didn't enjoy this. We all thought it tasted like cinnamon flavored dumplings (the chicken and dumpling type). None of us were able to finish our bowl because it was way too sweet. I gave this 3 stars because even though our tastes didn't enjoy it ~ it was an easy to put together recipe and it baked quite nicely. Thanks anyway!

We loved this.  A warm, soothing cinnamon treat.  Easy to make.  Cute the way you can take out a piece of cake and the yummy sauce is there in the pan to spoon over the top.  I made it without the apples--just walnuts.  Will definately make again.
