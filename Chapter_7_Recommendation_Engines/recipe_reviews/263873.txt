My husband and I both found this recipe pretty satisfying.  I am always surprised when people complain that it lacks flavor. You can pretty much tell by looking at the ingredients that there wasn't a lot of oomph here.  So, you spice it up!  I added chopped garlic and celery to the saute, and to the stew itself plenty of black pepper and my favorite garlic and herb Mrs. Dash.  We used spinach instead of kale and it was pretty darned good!!  I'll make this again I am sure.

I read reviews about the taste being ho-hum, so being forewarned, I added a bit of curry powder, a tsp. of dhania jeera (make your own or buy at www.ceresandco.com) and a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes.

I don't have an Instant Pot, so I made this in my Le Creuset braising pan, which is especially good for browning the meat. 

I found the sauce a bit too watery (thickening with flour won't work for low carb eating), so I removed the chicken from the liquid and boiled it down to a fourth of original amount, then whisked in four chunks of cold butter  to make a thick pan sauce. Then the chicken was popped back in to the braising pan to heat through. Oh, my, this is good! I took leftovers to the job for lunch today, and it was even better after sitting a day.  I also used boneless chicken thighs rather than breast meat. Be sure to remove the chicken before reducing the stock. Nothing worse than dry, overcooked chicken!

This is delicious, flavorful and healthy dish.  I don't have an 
Instant Pot  so l cook it on the stove which is quick and easy. I also use chicken thighs instead of breasts but otherwise followed the recipe. It has become a family favorite.

I just made this dish last night for dinner and it was extremely bland.  My husband and I couldn't finish it, that's how bad it was.  Surprised so many people gave it high marks.

We liked this one quite a bit. Chicken took about 10 minutes and wasn't quite all the way browned, but it was delicious.

This was my very first Instant Pot meal.  It was very easy.  I used the large leaf kale instead of the curly type.  

The only thing I would say  was that it was a little salty.  I added the amount of salt they recommended.  However, I used Better Than Bullion to make the chicken stock which is on the saltier side, and I bought diced tomatoes that also contained salt.  It wasn't horribly salty or anything, but next time I would probably use no-salt diced tomatoes and/or a low-sodium chicken stock.

There was a lot of liquid in the finished product, but it didn't say to drain the diced tomatoes.  Not sure if I was supposed to or not.  Anyway, the liquid was probably good for cooking it.  I just used a slotted spoon when dishing it out to serve.

Overall I thought it was very good and I would make it again.

This is the first recipe I made in my Instant Pot!  It is delicious!  The chicken is very tender and the flavor is just right--not overwhelming.  The only changes I made was using diced tomatoes with the herbs already in them and I left out the salt.  I will definitely make this again.

I had some kale in my CSA box and was looking for something different. I doubled the garlic, oregano, pepper. Did not add the salt because the bullion I use has plenty. It still lacked something so I added a few squirts of soy sauce ( a trick I learned from an 80's TV cooking show). I don't have an instant pot so I used the crock pot. Came out great!

Browning the chicken in the Instant Pot won't happen unless you dry the chicken or use fresh chicken breasts (vs. frozen).  Otherwise the recipe was excellent.  I bumped up the spices some based on concerns that the recipe is bland.  Serving it over roasted, riced cauliflower makes for a nice roux that really adds to the overall flavor.

We loved this recipe. We actually didn't change a thing on it. We will have it again.
