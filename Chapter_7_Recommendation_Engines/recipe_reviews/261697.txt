This is very easy, indeed. I used a potato masher to keep it chunky. This was delicious on toast and with cheese. Thank you for the recipe.

The Instant Pot is good for a no-hassle way to make cranberry sauce. I made half a batch, but used 1 cup sugar and still used 1/4 cup orange juice. It was not runny at all. I put the cinnamon stick in right at the beginning, and the flavor is still mild. I heard the beep when it was done and didn't have time to get to the pot for 40 minutes. Once I started stirring, they smashed very easily and no immersion blender was necessary. I only saut√©ed for maybe 2 minutes, and it was thick. At first I gave this 4 stars, as it was pretty good warm when I tried it. However, I let it sit in the fridge overnight, and it is just one big clump. This recipe needs more orange juice; all others recipes I've looked at call for more liquid.
