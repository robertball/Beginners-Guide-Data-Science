First off, it really makes me mad that no one rates the recipe anymore, they just type in their own recipe. You either rate it and say why you like it, or rate it and say why you hate or, or you just rate it and leave no comment at all. It's really simple to do. So here is my rating::: I LOVED IT. Everyone in my family loved it, I made the recipe AS IS and I kept it warm in the crockpot. It was great, my whole family thought it was great, and I will make it over and over again!!

Nice twist! I made these for dinner and really enjoyed the flavor.  Like another reviewer I added some crushed garlic.  The only other change I make is, while the potatoes are draining in the colander, I warm the milk, butter, garlic, and sour cream together and then add the potatoes.  That way cold ingredients aren't being added to my hot potatoes and the flavor of the garlic is released with the heat.

Kids love it! Quick and easy to make. Peels are nutritious. Very important to boil the water before you add the potatos or it will be too mushy.

Been making potatoes like this for some time, but slight variation.  I first chop a couple cloves of garlic and finely chop onion. Brown in butter or margarine, add to potatoes.  Also instead of sour cream, use yogurt. Garnish w/ parsley flakes.

Wonderful!  It's so nice not to have to peel the potatos.  It was a big hit with my family!  This is also good when you put the finished product in a casserole dish, sprinkle some cheddar cheese on top, and bake until it's bubbly.

I changed things just a touch to make them lower in carbs so that I could enjoy them with my family. 
I steamed one pound of red potatoes 
and one half head of cauliflower together
with a couple cloves of garlic. Very good with 
the Cola Pot Roast also listed on this 
site. 

Very, very good.

Absolutely delicious!  Didn't change a thing.  No need to add garlic unless you want Garlic Red Mashed Potatoes.

I thought this recipe looked a little blah to me, so I kicked it up a notch.  I sauted some green onion and garlic like others had said, and I also added some rosemary.  The rosemary gave it such a wonderful aroma and flavor!  I made this to go along with Cranberry Pork Roast (also on this website).  The gravy from the roast over the potatoes was fabulous!  What a wonderful meal for the beginning of fall!

I love this recipe. Thanks for posting it. I made this for the first time the other day, together with beef stroganoff (also my first time making it),with steamed brocolli. I had a lil trouble as I added (too much) milk that it was too runny. I added a half cup of mozarella cheese (the only cheese I had that time) and mixed it with the mashed potatoes and microwaved it, and it was still great. I gave this 5 stars because it was definitely my fault for adding the milk anyway,haha. My husband loved it too! We're both happy. Thanks again!

Great potatoes!  I sauteed a clove of garlic with my butter to make them garlic mashed.  Delicious!

This was the first time I have made really good mashed potatoes!  I heated the milk and melted the butter before adding to potatoes so mashing would be easier.  Also, I sauteed some green onions and garlic and added to potatoes while mashing. I spooned sauce from chicken marsala (also from this website) on the potatoes and it was TO DIE FOR!

This is keeper. It's quick,simple and hearty. I've gotten away from making mashed potatoes because it's so time consuming to peel potatoes. I love that I can come home and prepare this quickly and my family loves it. Thanks for posting.

These were wonderful and very easy to make.  Instead of putting the cooked potatoes in a separate bowl, I always use a large pot strainer and drain all the water out of the pan that I cooked them in.  I set it back on the burner that I was cooking on (turned off) and it keeps the potatoes warm and heats the added ingrediants.  Thanks for a great recipe.

great recipe & easy as 123. I like the texture of the finished product.
one secret is to boil potatoes in a pot of hot water, drain water and leave
the potatoes in the same pot, put back on the burner turn on med for 30
seconds and turn off, you will see all kinds of steam evaporate from them
as you stir them around for a minute, this will get out any excessive water 
left in the potatoes, red or Idaho potatoes, I do this for all mashed potatoes.

I was looking for a new side dish and decided to try these. Being single, I halved the recipe to cut down on left overs I probably wouldn't eat. At first I really didn't notice a big difference in the flavor (vs my standard mashers) but then all of a sudden that sour cream, butter, and milk just hit me and before I knew it I almost finished half the bowl! Somehow I put the rest in the fridge clutching the bowl and saying "my preeeecious" in an unfamiliar voice! Lol! Thank you for a wonderful recipe and I will make this again!

This is how I always make my mashed potatoes amd it's always great. I love reading other's changes when they make a review, in fact I usually will incorporate one or two of them, if it sounds good to me. It's one of the joys of cooking!

I cut the recipe down to 4 & used regular size red potatoes.  I peeled half of them & left half the skins on (for the kids' sake).  I also added a little garlic powder & my 11 year old son went back for thirds!  VERY TASTY!  Thanks B.T.!

I have been making this recipe for several years,and we love it. 
The only thing I do different is I peel the potatoes, because my husband does not like potato peels. (When I bake a potato, I eat the peel, he does not)
  I have made this using red potatoes, russet potatoes, and Yukon Gold. they all taste wonderful. it is the sour cream that makes the difference.

Quick, easy, and delicious!! In this day and age we all want and need recipes that don't have you spending 1/2 a day in the kitchen preparing, yet taste as though you did! Well, this is definitely a winner in my book! The changes I made were:
I used 4 pounds of potatoes. I mixed 2 pounds of the larger red potatoes with 2 pounds of the smaller petite red potatoes. (It's what I had on hand) I added the quartered potatoes to the water "before" boiling (I guess old habits die hard) and once the boiling started I reduced to medium high heat for exactly 10 minutes and they came out perfect! (Not mushy like some other reviewers stated) 
The other changes I made were I used Light Sour Cream & Skim Milk and my guests seriously didn't believe me when I told them afterwards! 
Next time I am going to try some other reviewers variations and add some garlic and maybe even some cheese and will let you all know how that turns out. Thanks Suzy for a wonderful, easy, doesn't break the bank recipe!

We try to eat relatively well so often I make mashed cauliflower instead of potatoes because we enjoy it almost as much.  When my husband requested ribs for Super Bowl Sunday, however, I decided to “go big or stay home” as he always says and look for a recipe for some killer mashed potatoes.  These fit the bill!  Although I kept the other 3 Tablespoon handy in case I needed to add them at the end, I only needed 5 Tablespoons of butter.  I warmed the butter with lowfat milk and crushed garlic, stirring in some light sour cream to warm at the end.  If you can find Daisy brand light sour cream in your area, I highly recommend it.  It is fresh and flavorful and difficult to tell that it is not full fat.  I know that warming the liquid ingredients may sound like that dreaded extra step, but it makes a huge difference in the texture of mashed potatoes.  Even with my lower fat changes these potatoes tasted decadent and delicious and will grace my table over and over again.

Really delicious! I'm giving it 4 stars because I ended up using 3 lbs of potatoes and that was perfect. I think 2 pounds, as the recipe states, would have come out too wet.

Yum! Made this last night for my family and they were amazing! I loved that I didn't have to peel them! I added crushed garlic and chicken broth to the water when boiling. I also heated the milk, sour cream and butter in a saucepan before adding.. And some extra crushed garlic, salt and parsley flakes.. They were sooooo delicious!! I did a 5 pound bag of the red potatoes :) definitely my new mashed potato recipe!!!  Paired them with steaks my hubby grilled up on the BBQ and green salad!

These were yummy and oh so creamy. I used a bunch of garlic salt in place of regular salt and added a little more sour cream than called for (love sour cream in my taters). Unfortunately, my hubby doesn't like it when I keep the skins on the potatoes, so I had to peel them. I think the texture of the skins would have added something nice, but without the skins, they are extra creamy and delicious. Tip: If you have a stand mixer, dump the cooked potatoes in there and mix in all the ingredients using the paddle attachment. They come out smooth and fluffy, and you don't have to do near as much work!

These were very good but I did, as others suggested, add crushed garlic. In opposition to the last reviewer it is often by "tweaking" recipes that we help them go from good to great. I appreciate ALL feedback on recipes I post or meals I serve & as it only serves to improve it. It is through constructive criticism that we DO improve! Kudos to the critics!

I bought a 5 lb. bag of red potatoes to make mashed potatoes for dinner last night, & I ended up making this recipe last night & tonight as well because they were so delicious! I think the sour cream makes them sooooo creamy and yummy! They may even be better than my mom's mashed potatoes (which I love)...don't tell her I said that! :) Thank you so much for this recipe...I will be using it often!

Good flavor, but it was more like potato soup than mashed potatoes.  Next time I would put way less milk.

These had a good taste.  I did warm the milk - but I added too much.  I didn't quiet use 2 lbs of potatoes thus I didn't need as much milk.  So my advice to myself and to you is to add the milk until you get the consistency you are seeking.

Oh, yum, yum! Like BHERNAN, I also added some green onion and I also added my usual garlic and onion powders. The sour cream really made the difference in this terrific dish. Good job B.T.! O.K. I take back everything I said about everyone being "normal" on this site. Just take a look at the latest review for Cajun Paella! YIKES!!

Of the few meals that I actually cooked last week, this made for a great side to one of them! I served this with "Cola Pot Roast II" (also on this site) and it was an EXCELLENT addition to our dinner table.  I used half & half instead of milk and per another reviewer, added some minced garlic and melted the butter for easier mashing and mixing. Great potatoes BT!! Also "pretty" (due to the skins of the reds!!)!

When I do these potatoes I don't mash until smooth, I like a few lumps in them.....I also add a chopped green onion and some crisp crumbled bacon when mashing

I thought these potatoes were delicious! My kids loved them. I even doubled them up and used them with another recipe the next night, just needs a little milk and butter to thin back out. I agree and disagree with BTRACY02. I think if you aren't going to follow the recipe exact then don't give it less than 5 stars. If you vary from the original that's fine but how do you know the original wasn't a 5 star to begin with! If you want to create your own masterpiece great but don't pull down some else's recipe rating b/c of this

This recipe was simple and so easy!  I didn't even measure my ingredients.  I also used potatoes I had picked up from the farmers market including a purple variety of potatoes along with red potatoes and yukon golds.  It was pretty and yummy!

Wow!  I will not make any other mashed potatoes, ever!  This was so simple and quick.  I whipped them in my Kitchenaid stand mixer, which made them fluffy and left little chunks of potato.  This dish got thumbs up from all - a small miracle to say the least!

My family really enjoyed these.  I used a 5 pound bag and subbed the milk with soy milk.  I used soy sour cream, and added 1/2 cup soy cream cheese.  Added some dried parsley flakes and a healthy dose of garlic powder.  Will make again.

A very good recipe for smashed red potatoes!  At the last minute I found to be out of sour cream so I substituted cream cheese.  I added a dash of garlic powder and onion powder.  Delish!

Really, really good.  I made these for Thanksgiving and my husband told me they were the best mashed potatoes he's ever eaten which is saying a lot because he's very picky.  The rest of my guests raved about them, too.  I did add a bit to the recipe (as usual);  1 Tbsp of jarred, minced garlic and 1 Tbsp of freeze-dried chives mixed in with another pinch of chives sprinkled on top for garnish.

This recipe has become one everyone asks for.  I sometimes saute a little garlic with the butter before adding to potatoes and it makes a great variation on this recipe.  Easy to make and there are never leftovers!

WOW what a way to snap up your red potatoes.  I took advise from another review and melted the butter and milk, which worked out super, and also sauted onion and a lil garlic and mashed it with the potatoes another wonderful hint.  I mashed these with a potatoe masher to give them a lil texture and served this with pork chops~super recipe  thanks BT

Great creamy mashed potatoes! I halved everything in this recipe, otherwise it was followed exactly. Because I do not have a masher, I cut the baby reds into fourths after they were done boiling and threw them together with the other ingredients into my stand mixer. Then, mixed on med-high until fluffy. These do lack a little on flavor, so adding an extra seasoning might be required for those who don't like plain mashers. The only thing I will change next time is cutting back on the butter, just to make them a little bit healthier. Otherwise they were great, thank you!

I thought these were pretty good. I made 1/2 recipe and used butter with canola oil and reduced fat milk and sour cream. I used the beater to whip them and they were pretty creamy. I got about 3 good sized servings with half the recipe.

I just made these tonight !!! Wonderful....the only thing I did was add 3 cloves of pressed garlic to the cooking water. Be sure and salt the cooking water (I added 2 tsp.). Other than that, I went right by the recipe and they were perfect! A real keeper!

Great recipe! I love mashed red potatoes but the sour cream incorporating into the potatoes makes the dish. The simplest recipes, like this one, are the best. Thanks for posting. :)

Yummy! Great, classic potatoes. Like someone else said- don't add garlic unless you want garlic redskins, obviously. For just plain ol' good creamy potatoes, this is the best recipe I've ever found. My husband kept sneaking into the fridge to eat cold spoonfuls later that night!

I actually enjoy when people give alternatives that they tried or suggestions for changes to the recipe. No one has to take their advice but i'm glad they're there, they've helped me quite often. I made these mashed potatoes and they were very good!!! I followed the recipe close but also added some crushed garlic like other reviewers. I actually mashed these in my crockpot and then turned it on to keep them warm. My family went back for seconds and thirds!!! My aunt suggested adding some ranch dressing instead of, or in addition to part of the sour cream to make these potatoes more appealing to the younger crowd. Her young sons liked that!!

These were amazing!! Made them twice this weekend. They were the perfect amount of moistness. The only thing I do is take my hand mixer and get them really fluffy and smooth. So much easier than peeling and chopping other potatoes. Will make these regularly, thank you for sharing!!

A delicious mashed potatoes recipe!  I wasn't looking for garlic or onion red mashed potatoes - just a simple & traditional red mashed potatoes side dish and this was perfect!  It's so flavorful & presents beautifully w/o taking away from the main dish.  Thank you SO much for the recipe!  I'll be using it again & again!  :)

Really good potatoes. I used Purple Majesty potatoes - the light purple color was a huge hit with the children! Good flavor, I added garlic powder with parsley, the sour cream, skipped the milk. Will make this one again.

I bought the wrong size (too big) of red potatoes.. So I actually had to boil them for close to 30-40 mins total. Was delicious, but maybe not flavorful enough? Will keep this recipe and try a variation next time.

Don't you just LOVE not having to peel potatos? This recipe is yummy! Hubby bangs the table for these at least twice a week.
For variation,i smash,peel and mince a couple cloves of garlic,then roast them in the oven a few minutes or saute them in a fry pan with a wee bit of extra virgin olive oil. Then simply mash into the potatos! Yum!!

I don't think I can ever eat regular mashed potatoes again. This is a keeper. 
Only thing I did different was add a bit of fresh parsley at the last few minutes of the potato boil, and a bit of garlic powder. So creamy, every body loved them!

Absolutely the BEST mashed potatoes EVER :)  Great texture, very creamy!  The only thing I did differently was use SmartBalance Butter instead of regular butter but other than that, everything else was the same and turned out great!  Thanks so much!

Yum! These potatoes are creamy and tasty. I liked leaving the skins on, for extra nutrition and flavor. (Also, not having to peel the potatoes is an extra bonus!) Thank you for the good recipe.

I thought these were a little bland and runny.  I would use more like 2-1/2 lbs. of potatoes.  I didn't have any fresh garlic to spice it up a little so I used a little garlic salt instead.  It helped some, but not much.  Doubt I'll be making these again.  Sorry!

Yummy! These are great. I thought they were a little bit runny but my fiance thought they were great. I will hold off on some of the milk until after I mix in the sour cream next time.

This was a good recipe for mashed potato lovers.  The red skins add a little twist as well as a little color.  My husband is not a mashed potato lover and he liked it but didn't rave about it.  I really liked it, but I generally like mashed potatoes.

Omg I think these are the best mashed potatoes I've ever made. I've always been curious to try a recipe with sour cream especially knowing many of my fav restaurants serve them that way. It seriously makes a huge difference on the beautiful creamy texture. I used 3 lbs instead of 2 and added more butter milk and sour cream until it was my ideal texture and taste and also added onion and garlic powder to it. My husband loved it and he's super picky. Thank you

Straight from the mouth of a hard-to-please husband when it comes to potatoes: "These are the best Red Potatoes I have ever had!"  I think we have a winner!  Thanks so much for sharing.

I have used this recipe several times and adjusted the servings up and down.  Every time the recipe was a success. I have served them fresh and traveled with them and served from a warmed crock pot. They were terrific.

I've made this before and it came out GREAT! However this time it came out bad! I think it was because I used the wrong kind of potatoes or maybe the sour cream was low fat.. or something. I had to dumped it all in the garbage disposal. But its a great recipe. Just make sure to use the right kind of potatoes and  sour cream etc. Stick to the recipe!!!

Tthis recipe is fantastic, of course what's not to love about potatoes and a half a cup of butter with sour cream, it's a winner!  I did add just a smidgeon of garlic, not enough to make it "garlic mashed" but just enough to give it the richness that garlic imparts, 1/2 clove minced and mashed.  It's now a basic keeper in this family and since we are always trying to lower our carb intake I'm going to take someones advice next time and substitute half potato for half cauliflower.  Thanks

Good starter recipe. It definitely takes longer than 10 minutes to cook the potatoes to the right tenderness. I also recommend returning them to the same pot after draining, as the residual heat soaks up any excess moisture. I added some shredded cheddar cheese to give it some extra flavor. Great staple side dish!

Yum! I was in search of a no-frills, basic mashed potato recipe to serve alongside my salmon dinner and this fit the bill perfectly!!! To boot, I didn't have to fuss over peeling potatoes and got a nice nutritional benefit from it! My only complaint is that the suggested amount of servings is way off. I decided to cut this down to six servings since I was only serving four adults (all I could find were 1 1/2 lb. bags of potatoes or SUPER large (3+ lb.) ones hence the odd serving size). After making my first batch of potatoes, I realized there was not NEARLY enough servings, especially if anyone wanted a second helping. I sent my husband to the grocery store to pick up more potatoes and made a second batch. I had just enough to serve four HUNGRY adults. If you want generous helpings and are feeding a crowd I STRONGLY suggest that you make a MINIMUM of six servings worth of potatoes. NOTE: I try to use fat-free / reduced-fat ingredients whenever I can. I did this time and no one could tell the difference. Thanks for sharing your recipe, B.T. These were hands down the best - rich, creamy and absolutely delicious! :-)

I did try it and the flavor was okay. I found the skins left on had a watery sort of pasty texture. I will try it again with peeled potatoes.

The potatoes were too mushy for my taste so after I mixed in all the ingredients, I baked it for another 20-30 minutes at 350 degrees. I also topped it off with mozerella cheese, which was great!

A classic delicious dish!  We used the food processor to do thin slices of potatoes instead of cubing them but otherwise followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out wonderfully!
I paired this with the Traditional Osso Bucco and it picked up the flavors of that sauce very well.

These were a huge hit at the thanksgiving table!  I made a few hours ahead and kept warm in my crockpot set at low (in a liner).  I gave it the occassional stir, but this dish held up great and was yummy at dinner time.

Instead of russets or golden Yukon, I used this recipe  keeping skins on. It was a Thanksgiving hit. My family devoured them. Quick simple recipe with perfect proportions for flavor and texture. I tried not to over mash. Leaving a bit of chunkiness to balance the skins.

Loved it!  So easy and so delicious.  Can't believe we used to have instant mashed potatoes!  Served with rum-glazed ribs and corn on the cob.

Delish, one slight change. I just didn't add a whole stick of butter. My kids like to add a bit on their own. So, I'd rather them put a pat on themselves then to over butter their potatoes. But all in all, simple, easy and tasty. Thanks. I'll make again this way.

Tasty mash potatoes I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and heat the butter, milk and sour cream up before adding it to the potatoes worked out great seemed to make the potatoes extra creamy.

These were fabulous! I used fat-free sour cream and they still turned out wonderful. As a tip, make sure that the butter is at room temperature otherwise it's harder to mix everything together. Will definitely be making these again.

Made these potatoes for the first time on Thanksgiving.  Very easy and delicious...needed something easy that day because the turkey sure wasn't. The only thing I did differently was to add a couple of garlic cloves while the potatoes were boiling.

I've actually been making a version of this recipe for ages and it's a big hit! As some of the other reviewers mentioned I add salt and a little bit of olive oil to the water while the potatoes are cooking and then add garlic to the potatoes. If I'm feeling decadent I also add some shredded cheese (Mexican cheese usually, although others would work too) and use half and half instead of milk. I call it smashed potatoes-- but regardless of what you call it, this recipe is a keeper!

This dish was good but a little to buttery...I think a half a cup of butter is too much for this amount of potatoes.  The next time I make it, I will cut back on the butter and increase the milk/sour cream to compensate...

These were awesome!.. I couldn't stop eating them.  Hubby loved them too; I will make these a lot now that the cold season is coming.  It's a nice change to have a creamy delicious mashed potato that doesn't need gravy!  I added a dash of dill weed and some chives on top.

Simple comfort food!  For some reason I started cooking this early and it was done way before the roast was ready.  But it turned out sooo creamy that it reheated beautifully.  Thanks sumbitter.

Perfect down to the amount of milk. Made wonderful creamy potatos. I never thought you could get red potatos as creamy as russets but these changed my mind.

Easy and delicious. I peeled my potatoes, since we don't like potato skins and used less butter and more sour cream to cut calories somewhat. Both adults and kids loved this!

Awesome potatoes that everyone loved- even my picky eaters! The only thing I did extra was I boiled 2 cloves of garlic with the potatoes and mashed it all. Everything else was according to recipe. Oh, and I peeled potatoes b/c my kids wouldn't have eaten them w/skins on. Yummy!

For some reason it come out very bland and gooey for me. I had to add a BUNCH of spices and then transfered it into a pot and cooked it on low in the oven forever. But my family liked it so thats all that matters.

I was surprised at how much I liked this recipe.  Didn't change the ingredients, but found I had to boil the potatoes a lot longer than the recipe called for.  I boiled them for 25 minutes which is what I boil russet potatoes for.  My family enjoyed the recipe as well.  Will definitely make again!

These are not as creamy as I would have liked.  I had to add an extra 1/2c milk to make it the right consistency.  They were ok as is but much better with the right gravy.

So easy and so yummy! I followed this other than adding some spices to it (Italian blend, garlic powder, salt, and pepper). I will DEFINITELY make again!

Great recipe! Added garlic cloves and used chicken broth to boil potatoes - fished out the garlic prior to mashing due to my family's preference. Cubing the potatoes prior to boiling definitely helped in the mashing process. Will use this recipe again!

What am I missing here???  With the high rating I expected great things. These were nothing special.  I will just do it on my own from now on.

Very easy and very tasty.  I love not having to peel potatoes.  Skipping that step makes me much more inclined to make them.

Tasty, but I will cut WAY down on the oregano when I try this one again.  My husband said he couldn't say goodbye to these for the whole evening, if you know what I mean!  Just a little less garlic and oregano and I think they'll be tasty but not TOO overbearing.

Really wonderful.  I used fat free sour cream, 2% milk, and a little bit less butter than it called for.  Then I mashed it all in my VitaMix blender.  Will for sure make again because it was so easy!

I followed this recipe exactly and was nervous at first because it was so runny when I mixed it all together. However, after sitting for a few min it thickened back up again. Will make again.

This is such a wonderful mashed potato!!!!!  What I like about is very easy.  Especially I don't even have to peel potatoes.  Red potatoes skins are very thin and it did not even bother kids.  I made this last week when we went camping(I made this in my camper)and everybody loved it!  Thanks for this wonderful easy recipe!!!!!!

These potatoes were excellent.  I could not locate my potato masher, so I used a hand mixer on the lowest speed until the potatoes were mashed but still a bit chunky.  Excellent!  They paired perfectly with the garlic parmesan chicken also on this site.

These were pretty good.  I also warmed up the ingredients to add with the potatoes and they stayed warm.  I doubled the recipe and it turned out great.  Maybe garlic would have helped, they were a little bland tasting.  Will make again!

This recipe was great!  My boyfriend kept commenting that they were the best mashed potatoes he had ever had!  I added a little cream cheese in addition to the sour cream and it was gooooood.  It's surprising how much FLAVOR these potatoes had with such simple ingredients.  Big hit!

These sure were easy compared to "regular" mashed potatoes. The sour cream gives a great flavor. I was worried my husband would turn up his nose at unpeeled potatoes but he didn't say a word.

My family loved these these potatoes; especially my 9-yr-old daughter.  She ate them until they were gone!  The flavor is great and they are really easy since there's no peeling involved.  I will make these again.  Personally, I thought the texture was a little too thick and a lot like glue.  I will use a bit more milk next time.

Excellent basic recipe. I like the added nutrition from eating the skins. I did not cut the potatoes small enough (probably 1 inch pieces best?) but I'll definitely make again.

Loved it!  It really did only take 10 minutes to boil the potatoes!  Very quick recipe (no peeling!), looks real fancy, and tastes awesome!  Plenty of room for self-expression: adding garlic salt or chopped chives, etc.  I actually made this twice last night - once to take over to a friend's place and once for our own household.  Definite keeper!

Excellent. I doubled the recipe because my family are big mashed potato eaters. Will use the leftovers in a perogie casserole (lasagna noodles, mashed potatoes, cheddar cheese and onions). Very tasty.

Excellent recipe. Everyone enjoyed this. Served with the chateaubriand recipe from this site for my Mother's Day dinner. Added some green onion and chopped garlic. Kid's loved this except I had to pick out the green onions as well as the red skins for the 5-year-old.

Delicious! Used the recipe almost as written. Only change was 3 cloves of garlic boiled and mashed with the taters. (I had a hankering for garlic potatoes the night I made this recipe but I did not add due to a deficiency in the recipe). Just a great recipe and so time friendly for getting dinner on the table after work. Thanks!

Best mashed potatoes I’ve ever had. I substituted the sour cream with a Mexican 4 cheese blend and added 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic.

I'm 30 years old! I love cooking, especially for other people.  I enjoy watching people eat the things I've made for them. My father and law also likes cooking. We enjoy finding and making new recipes and then sharing them with each other. We each have a binder that we keep recipes, that we each deemed worthy to make again, and again. Its funny that after all the recipes I've tried I had never made  home made mashed potatoes.I know right!! This recipe was my first. This recipe was also the first that I had finally decided to sign up for an account with allrecipes.com, as well as my first food review. This  recipe was great! It was easy, and I took a few recommendations from other reviewers, such as heating the milk, butter, and sour cream before adding to the potatoes, and I also added some minced garlic and garnished with chives! I'll never buy instant potatoes again!!!

These actually came out very good! I was concerned at first that they would be too runny. After they cooled a little bit they were perfect! My family loved them.

Delicious! Did not have any sour creme at hand so I adapted it. Mixed milk, butter, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper in a small pan over low heat till the butter melted then folded it into the potatoes. WATER MUST BE BOILING BEFORE YOU ADD POTATOES IN! Don’t overcook them.

This was a nice change from the eastern potatoes I usually use.  I added more milk maybe because I used 2-1/2# of potatoes.  Great to have to peel!

When made with the quantities listed, it was too liquid for my taste. After combining everything, I cooked it a bit more on low heat to evaporate some of the liquid and thicken things up. Still not quite my style; I prefer a more “fluffy” mashed potato, which this was not, but at least it salvaged the side for us. Probably won’t make again, as I have other mashed potato recipes I like more.

Wonderful...these are definitely going to become my quick and easy alternative to mashed potatoes because these do not need peeling! That said, the dish was excellent. The only change I made was to add a tiny bit of garlic.

This is a great recipe as is. The only thing I do differently is use chicken stock instead of water. If chicken stock isn’t on hand, then boil the water and add a few boullion cubes or better than boullion mix to the water and mix it in before adding the potatoes. It makes for more depth of flavor instead of just salting the water.

Stellar!!! I have made these potatoes so many times since finding this recipe!!! The only thing I add is 1 or 2 cloves of minced garlic, and it takes it to the next level!!! I would recommend, while the potatoes are boiling, to heat all other ingredients together in a bowl in the microwave or on the stovetop, so that when they’re added to the potatoes, everything stays nice and hot!! We love these, thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

My husband loved this, and he’s really into mashed potatoes!! I found it just a tad bland, but could be Bc I didn’t use enough salt. It was very easy and fast to make! Will def make again!! Great easy way to have natural mash potatoes!

These are my go to mashed potatoes for any occasion, but especially Thanksgiving.  I don't really measure the ingredients anymore and I also add garlic powder.  My eldest and her husband have a standing argument on whose mom makes the best mashed potatoes - its based on these. (They are hands down my other son-in-laws favorites)

Good old fashion recipe that is easy and has a nice potato flavor. I look for recipes that have minimal ingredients because I don’t have anything fancy in my kitchen. This fits the bill. Thanks, I’m pairing it with a pot roast and looking forward to it!

I made this when we hadn't gone grocery shopping yet and everyone loved it. I just substituted cream cheese for sour cream because I didn't have any.  Paired well with lemon garlic chicken.  I'll try sour cream next time.

Love this recipe! It’s my go to for mashed potatoes. The only thing I do differently is add a few cloves of garlic! Also, when I have it, I boil half water and half chicken broth to cook the potatoes in. I learned this trick when making any mashed potato recipe and it adds just a little flavor that’s amazing!

I have made this recipe for years ….. and oddly MY name is SUZY …. I do not use the milk, don’t need it with the sour cream, but I do use a little of the potatoe water for moisture.  And all important I add a healthy amount of Parmesean cheese stirred in at the end along with more butter.   G R E A T ….  Occassionally I add loose frozen spinach when I drain the potatoes …… GREAT AGAIN.

These were really good! Added in some rosemary and a little bit of cheese for more flavor. Will probably add a bit more milk next time to make it a little more creamy. Otherwise, no complaints!

I cooked these as directed and we think they are delicious with pot roast and roasted parmesan asparagus. Standing alone they are a bit bland but I'll try adding garlic when they will be accompanying chicken.  Many thanks for a delish recipe!

This was ok, but it needed more seasoning.  I added Garlic, heavy Cream, and parm cheese.  Basically, I used a different recipe to make them better.

This is an awesome recipe! Simple and the people will love it. I added fresh rosemary(not much since the fresh is VERY flavorful, and you must chop, and mix it well), Parmesan & Smoked Gouda cheese. Can't wait to make it for  Thanksgiving!!

Needed a quick potato recipe for dinner tonight and I'm so glad I tried this one!  Quick, easy and so delicious!  I used mini purple potatoes as that is what I had on hand and added a bit of Lawry's seasoned salt in place of the salt and pepper. Thanks!

These potatoes are easy to make and are a good base to build flavor off of. I would add some garlic and a few other spices and cheese. To them to make them more to my families liking.

I had never made mashed red potatoes or used sour cream. I made 5lbs worth, everyone loved them. I did add Italian seasoning, it gave the potatoes a little extra flavor and color. Will definitely be making again. Might try making in Cockpot next time.

Soooo yummy!!!  I added sour cream to mine and it reminded me of the mashed potatoes at the rainforest cafe. These are, for sure, the best mashed potatoes I've ever had!

I'm sure as written, this would be 5 stars. I needed to make it healthier. I used greek yogurt in place of sour cream and halved the butter. In place of the half left out, I used yogurt. Tasted good!

It was a great not having to peel the potatoes.  I like the fact that the sour cream and butter was already in the mashed potatoes before I served it.  I place extra butter and sour cream on the table but they were never used.  My children loved it!

Very easy and tasty. The cook time was spot on as were the ratios for the other ingredients. I did add grated parm and some garlic but that's just a personal preference.

It was OK. The sour cream made it taste really weird, and the smell was strange, I assume from the sour cream.

Yum yum yum!  I used 1/4 cup butter and added some garlic and it was delicious!  I was prepared with the other half of the butter if needed, but found it to taste plenty buttery with only half.  This is a great basic recipe that can easily be altered to suit your taste.  It will also stand on its own if desired.  I used an immersion blender to mash because I like really creamy potatoes.

This was soooo rich and creamy!!! The potatoes were a little hard to mash, so I would probably boil for a few minutes longer, but I will DEFINITELY make this again!  Lastly, I added chives and garlic powder.  So good.

Very good recipe. I had to do without sour cream so I added extra milk and butter. Then I added a dash of garlic salt and garlic pepper and it turned out really really well

These were creamy and delicious. I love not having to peel potatoes to make mashed potatoes. The only thing I changed was I added some crushed garlic. I will be making these again.

Fatty and soupy, but in a delicious way. I had this with Salisbury steak with mushrooms. They were tasty together. Gravy is optional.

Next time, I might try to reduce the fat a little.

Did add some Garlic Salt. Big hit.

This is good but if your little beggars don't like lumps then they will not like this. Mashed this with two different styles of masher tools. Both had lumps. So, I covered the dish with cheddar cheese and bacon bits. They did not notice the lumps

These were a hit. Made them as is and I'll make them again and again. Good flavor and the peel is where the nutrition is plus adds some color.

Absolutely delicious! I didn't change a thing. I made a bigger batch so I just added the ingredients to taste/texture and mixed right in the pot I'd boiled the potatoes in.

It's a good basic mashed potato recipe. Good as it is, but also has room for adding more flavors. It's not my absolute favorite mashed potato recipe, but a good recipe to have around.

Followed the recipe to a T but I wasn't a big fan of these.  I found them to be a bit bland with a gooey consistency that I did not like.  The skins also had an odd texture.  I made these twice, just to make sure that I didn't screw something up the first time; I may try them a third time without skins and see what happens.

I liked this recipe. I used yukon gold potatoes. I also added cream instead of milk and some sautéed garlic. I wasn't sure how many pounds of potatoes I used, so I may have added a lot more butter and cream than was called for! But it was yummy!

Just added a few dashes of garlic salt in addition to the salt and pepper, I felt like they were a little bland with just the salt and pepper.  Once I added that little bit of garlic salt they were fantastic!  I will keep using this recipe, my family, and kids loved it!

i made them with coconut butter so i didnt add the garlic everyone keeps mentioning. but coconut butter with the red potato is very good mix and i reccomend it. i also cooked my other ingredients before adding them all together which i thought was a great idea. very good ill be stuffing this recipe in my back pocket.

Made exactly as the recipe said. A bit bland for my liking. May add garlic next time.

This is a great recipe, and a nice basic recipe to have in your regular line up. 

I made two small changes. I added 1/4 cup ranch dressing and 1/2 tsp garlic salt to the mix.

This recipe is delicious just as is!!  Have made it a few times and didn't change a thing.  Y-U-M-M-Y and so quick and easy.  Especially like not having to peel the potatoes.

I made these exactly according to the recipe and they were really good -- not spectacular, but still really good.  Quick & easy, they taste buttery (but not overly buttery, which is important) and are a nice texture.  I LOVE mashed with the peels still on.  I WILL make them using this recipe again and maybe add a bit of garlic powder, green onions, or a tiny bit of cucumber dressing for a bit more flavour.

I have been making mashed potatoes this way for quite some time. I agree, they are great with sour cream added. The only thing I have changed over the years is to use heavy cream in place of milk. I like the flavor just a bit better (probably not the healthiest way to do them though). Once out of desperation I tried cream cheese when I did not have the other ingredients. That is good also. There are so many variations that can be used with this recipe. My husband is a fan of adding garlic; I like adding chives. Cheese is a good addition too.

I don't know if I've review these before, but I've made them numerous times. Always delicious! I usually add a little garlic powder, along with the salt and pepper, because I love garlic. My husband usually makes his "loaded", but I think they are wonderful as is.

Very good and fairly simple! Note: I reduced the butter by 1/3 and used 2% Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream.

Great recipe. I added a few cloves of crushed garlic and turned them into garlic mashed potatoes. I didn't like the looks of other garlic recipes so I added it to this one. Awesome!

These potatoes are OK.  I made the recipe as written, and it was a little bland.  The result was also too thin for my tastes, but that's just a personal preference.  If I make this recipe again, I'll definitely add more seasonings--garlic, green onion, etc.

Tried this recipe with large red potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1in pieces.  Cooked for about 20 min. Warmed the milk, butter and sour cream as suggested by others. Prepared and left in pot until ready to eat. Served with filet mignon steaks, sautéed champignons and onions. It was FANTASTIC! Best mashed potatoes ever! Thank you!!!

This is a good mashed potato recipe.  Potatoes come out nice and creamy and flavorful.  Sometimes we half the butter just to be more health/calorie conscious, but the recipe is great either way.

These were pretty good.  I had leftover Yukon potatoes that I used.  They never really turned out creamy and I had to use the hand mixer to get the consistency that I wanted, but overall not bad.

It doesn't get much easier than this. A little chopped green onion is a nice addition. Reminder not to over-mash.

I suggest boiling the potatoes a bit longer and a tad more butter. Other than that pretty good!

i made these potatoes for our Christmas dinner. It was a hit with the family along with the high temperature eye of round roast featured here. A wonderful Christmas dinner. Another dish I tried was the wedge iceberg lettuce salad. An all around great dinner. Very memorable for our family.

This was a fairly easy recipe to use. Taste great to me. My only problem is that I wish I had used the whole 3lb bag versus leaving a 1lb behind. Mine ended up more liquidy than anything. I'll use it again, but I'll use the bag of potatoes.

Great recipe. Even my 8 yr old ate it and she hates the skin on potatoes. I put in a clove of garlic but other than that made it exact. Will be putting these on the table more often. Thanks for the great recipe. Kat

Such an easy and versatile recipe!  Made this several times following the exact recipe and everyone loved it.  I've also melted the butter over a low heat with some garlic added and let that heat for a few minutes and then cool to room temperature before adding to the potatoes.  Everyone loves them and overall this is a very easy, foolproof recipe.

LOVE IT!  It only took 10 minutes to boil the potatoes.  I do suggest letting the potatoes cool enough that you can peel most of them before mashing.  I started mashing before peeling and found I didn't like the look of all the peels in it.  So I spent time picking most of them out.

I think this is my new go-to potato recipe.  I didn't do anything to change it, followed to the letter.  It was crowd pleasing and we only had a small amount leftover.  Almost everyone went back for seconds.  Thank you for the great recipe!

Substituted Philly cream cheese for sour cream. Delish! Cut serving size in half. Put quartered red potatoes in a microwave steamer (tupperware) with a tiny splash of water and some salt.  Microwaved for 10 minutes. Mashed up potatoes, 1/4 cup milk, 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup cream cheese, and added a bit of chopped garlic.  Salt & Pepper to taste.  Hearty.

I made these potatoes using my new KitchenAid mixer. They were wonderful, and my picky dinner guests agreed!

Love it but needs tons of salt and pepper to give it flavor - it's in the crockpot now as recommended by others to keep warm while other food is prepared!  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious just as it is! I sometimes add sauteed onions, garlic, or shallots as well, but it isn't necessary.

Very good.  Only change I made was to peel the potatoes (for my picky kid). Fortunately, he really like them.  My husband and I would like to try them sometime with the skins on and will add garlic to spice it up a bit.

Best mashed potatoes I have ever eaten. Can't wait to make them again. I kept them warm in the crock pot while preparing other dishes for Thanksgiving. Flavor and texture remained perfect--even for the leftovers.

These potatoes were FABULOUSSS!! To be honest I took the advice of other reviewers and I added the sauteed garlic and chives to be honest without those I could see it might have tasted bland. I also ran low on butter (it was thanksgiving morning no way was I going to the store for butter) so I just added a little extra sour cream and milk and it was perfect! I highly recommend this recipe if you do add the garlic and chives and in case your wondering they were perfect without gravy there was no need for it. But it really was extremely easy and quick!

Made this today for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I warmed up my milk, butter and sour cream, plus added some diced garlic, on the stove before adding it to the potatoes for mashing.  Also, I doubled the recipe but didn't double the butter and it was still great.  Who needs to peel potatoes when you can cook delicious mashed potatoes like this without the hassle??

Delicious! I cooked the potatoes a bit too long, but that was fine, also I used half the butter and probably extra sour cream.  Loved them!  And I don't normally like skins

This is a great mashed potato recipe. I made it exactly according to the recipe but when making it for the second time tonight I will cut down the milk to 1/3 cup to firm them up a bit.  Delicious with Beef Bourguignon.

I did some minor adjustments because I had no time to MASH the potatoes.
I BOILED the potatoes with skin in chicken broth with Maggi cube til tender
-put two tablespons butter
-minced garlic with its garlic juices
-milk
-salt and pepper
BLEND!

This recipe was great. I normally would leave on the skins but someone else prepped them and spent a long time getting the skins off. I put all the ingredients in my Kitchenaid mixer and mixed it for a while...also I used cream instead of milk... thanks

These mashed potatoes are thee BOMB! fat an all, buttered up is the key. I guess you can try different variations cutting fat here and there.The only thing I did different was heat up the butter, milk, and cream.

These are awesome!  I added a little bit of finely chopped garlic and followed someone else's recommendation of warming the butter/milk/sour cream/garlic first, prior to mixing it in with the potatoes.  Added salt, pepper and freshly chopped parsley to top it off, and they were excellent!!

Oh wow!  I've never made my own mashed potatoes from scratch, but on a whim, I decided to try it tonight.  I found this recipe earlier in the evening, had all the ingredients, and thought I'd give it a shot.  They're PERFECT!  So glad this was the first recipe I tried--my friends are going to be impressed for sure!  Thank you!

These were so creamy- the texture was absolutely perfect.  I have always preferred mashed potatoes with the skins still on so this recipe was right up my ally.  My potatoes needed to cook 15 minutes before they were "mashable."  At the suggestion of other reviewers, I melted the butter and browned 2 cloves of fresh garlic  in it to make these garlic mashed potatoes (SO good), although I am sure they would be delcious plain.  Thanks- we will make these again!

I am giving this recipe a triple SSS rating...Super Simple and Succulant!  I agree w/ another reviewer, I love all the alterations/suggestions from other reviewers.  Keep it up! I incorperated a few of them.  Sauteed minced garlic in the butter, used half and half, and warmed it and the sour cream.  Delish!!!! Thanks to all!

These potatoes are delicious.  Very creamy and rich.  Next time I think I'll add a little minced fresh garlic for some extra pop.

I added about three tablespoons of minced garlic but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was well liked though I thought it was a little liquidity.

I've tried so many mashed red potato recipes that call for lots of extras - sauteed onions, garlic, etc.  This one appealed to me because of it's simplicity.  And you know what?  It's still delicious!  The only thing I did was take the butter down a notch (about 3/4 of a stick).  DELISH!  Highly recommend.

Very good *simple* recipe as is.  However, the husband and I are huge garlic fans so we added a tbsp. of minced garlic and a dash of garlic powder to the mix.  His only comment was that it was a little too buttery for him...  It wasn't a problem for me but I could see where he was coming from.  The sour cream was a great taste/texture addition from the several other mashed red potato recipes I've tried.

Even my kids loved this one. I made them garlic red mashed potatoes by caramelizing 3 cloves chopped garlic and green onions and adding it to the recipe. You can even boil them in chicken stock for more flavor! They looked great on the table and tasted even better. I plan to make them again soon!

We enjoyed trying a new mashed potato recipe for Father's Day this year. The flavor was good and everyone liked them, but a couple of people mentioned that they were a tad "gummy."  Could have been the short wait time on the warm burner while the rest of the meal prep was being finished up. I will try them again. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe! What my family does is add some cooked bacon bits to it. It adds a little more flare to the mashed potatoes. Awesome comfort food!

I only used 1/4 cup of butter and they were fine.  1/2 cup (1 full stick) is a ton of butter but go for it if your conscience can handle it. I also used fat free sour cream. I added a touch of onion powder. Kids loved!

Very yummy and simple recipe!  My 2 year old, who has to be told that mashed potatoes are "grits," ate a full serving of these.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was add a dash of garlic powder and a little shredded cheddar, just to suit my husband's taste.

Great recipe! This is my go-to mashed potato recipe from now on. The only thing I changed was to add some seasonings to the pot while the potatoes boiled. I added garlic, onion powder, dried basil, salt and pepper. Super easy and super tasty recipe! Thank you!

Used the food processor to "mash" the potatoes and it was a little thin. Great taste though! Love the skins!

I've always wanted to make mashed red potatoes and thought it was going to be complicated. I searched and found these and they were so easy to do! And they taste wonderful! I think adding garlic would be good, too. :)

These were pretty good.  Maybe a little bland, so I sauteed some garlic and butter together, pulled the garlic pieces out and poured the butter over the potatoes.

That's it!  I found my recipe!  Yessss!!  I used a 3lb bag of baby reds, left them skin-on.  Added 3 heads (yes, heads) of roasted garlic, 1/2c cream, and about 4 or 5 Tbsp of butter.  I then added 1/4c parm cheese, a few shakes of kosher salt, and a find grinds of fresh pepper.  Top it off with about a tsp of oregano and perfection!

Great recipe.  I have never been able to make good mashed potatoes so I was really pleased with the results of this dish. I did not follow the recipe exactly because I thought it was too rich for my family. I used one percent milk, 1/4 c of butter, 2T light sourcream and 1t mashed garlic.  The result was light, fluffy and flavorful.
Perfect.

This was great. I altered the recipe slighly but not much. the only thing I changed was I added about 4 cloves of chopped up garlic to the water while I was boiling it. I made bigger chunks of potato so I could cook it oonger to get the garlic flavor into the potato. I cooked it for about 25 minutes and they were perfect. Everything else was identical. Thanks!

Didn't really care for these. Way to much butter, sour cream, etc and still the pototoes were very bland without flavor at all. Will not make again.

We were not a fan of these.  They weren't thick, and despite a fair amount of seasoning, didn't have much flavor.

These are very tasty.  I used skim milk, low-fat butter and low-fat sour cream to try to make them a little healthier, and the flavor was still very good!

Simply amazing!  I made these potatoes for a Christmas Eve dinner for my family.  I took the advice of another review and slightly warmed the milk, sour cream, and butter before adding them to the potatoes.  Just luke warm from the microwave.  
These potatoes were delicious!

I did not like the rations. Too much butter, milk, and sour cream for me. Will not use this recipe again.

AB-FAB!!!!!!!!  I had the butter at room temp, put that in the bowl of the kitchen aid mixer with the sour cream, dumped in some leftover cheddar cheese (about 1/2 cup), put the potatoes in and mashed, adding the milk to get the desired consistency.  DELISH!  Thanks!

This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I have made it many many times and each time is just as good as the last one.  Sometimes I add cheese and/or garlic for something different.

My grandfather made the best mashed potatoes in the universe. I don't know what his secret was; I've never been able to replicate them, but these were VERY good. We all had seconds (and some of us had thirds.) Thanks!

This was a hit! We all enjoyed it very much.  I don't think I'll make mashed potatoes with white potatoes again.  I added minced garlic and garlic powder to it.  Great receipe, you should try it!!

Great basic smashed potatoes recipe.  My husband makes them all the time because they are so easy(he isn't the best cook).  He hates sour cream too and he doesn't even taste it but it makes them creamy. He adds 1t garlic powder for extra flavor.  Nice and quick recipe.

I scaled this down to 4 servings & made it as written.  What can I say?  It's mashed potatoes!  They were creamy.  They were delish!  Served with the "kalua pig in a slow-cooker" from this site.  Thank you, B.T.!

This recipe was pretty good, but a little flavorless.  I added a lot of salt and pepper, parsley, and some garlic salt.  Otherwise, it was a nice base recipe.

Used the general idea of these, but changed it to our likings. I didn't use the milk, cut back on the butter, added more sour cream, and added some minced green onion. Great flavour! I served these with a roasted chicken, and it went really well :)

Went well with my grilled chicken & green beans.  It did not have an overpowering flavor.  Thought it could use some more sour cream though when I tasted it before serving.

These were wonderful!!  I'll never peel potatoes for mashed potatoes again!!  I added a bit more sour cream (because I love it) and per another reviewers suggestion boiled the potatoes with a clove of garlic.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Oh my gosh, these are incredible! My husband said they were even better than Cheesecake Factory. I used a little bit of cream cheese in addition to the sour cream, which was delicious. Sometimes I'll put in garlic cloves in with the potatoes while they are boiling, and then mash them in after I drain the water. I've also tried cajun seasoning when I'm in the mood for something different.   Cajun seasoning really complements the flavors.

This is the perfect recipe! Seriously, you HAVE to try it! I made it exactly as it called for, but my potatoes were medium sized. I also added a dash of white pepper along with a good amount of regular pepper and salt. I don't like sour cream, but you can't taste it and it really makes a differance. My family of 5 raved and raved. Thank you very much!!!

My boyfriend used to be the mashed potato maker in our house.  I've now taken over that role.  Ever since I made these he won't make his.  He say's I have to make these ones!  They're fabulous!

We first had these potatoes when we had company over. I was worried that they wouldn't turn out good, but they were great. The best part is you don't peel the potatoes!! My kids loved them. Yum!

These are so good -- they are similar to Cheesecake Factory's mashed potatoes -- and they're so easy to make.  I scale the recipe down to 2 and make it as a quick side dish all the time.  Due to the size variations of potatoes, I have to adjust the amount of milk, so I just add a little at a time until I get the right consistency.

I have a husband who loves mashed potatoes but if you're like me, you get sick of all that peeling! So this recicpe is a godscend. Incredibly creamy & delicious. To lighten it up I used light butter, light sour cream & skim milk. Next time I think I'll cut the butter amount by a tbsp or two just for health's sake. Tasted so wonderful & they were so easy & done in minutes. Thanks so very much!

Very creamy and delicious! Just the right amount of milk and sour cream! I used 1 percent milk and I had made some dip with ranch dressing and sour cream earlier in the day so I used that.

Nothing special. Way too runny and they never thickened up. This was my first time making mashed potatoes with red potatoes (which I LOVE) and I think next time I will do without the sour cream and add the milk until it's a good consistancy (not runny)

AWESOME!!!  These were great.  I saw the same thing everyone else did where the taters looked a little on the wet side, but let them sit for a while and you should be good to go.  I put a little more milk to make it creamier, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Easy to make and tastes great!

Made these tonight for dinner at my 7 year olds request.  He had "smashed potatoes" at school.  Used ranch dressing instead of sour cream (as one other reviewer did).  Also added 1/4 cup more milk, we like our potatoes creamy.  They were as good as schools...THATS a compliment...!

I thought this was okay---but not really special. No complaints, but no compliments either.

I love how easy this recipe was. I omit the butter and just use a little more sour cream. Also, using goat cheese worked well too. Delicious.

Pretty yummy.  I accidentally got the Yukon Gold potatoes instead of the red skins.  I was making my first Christmas dinner for my boyfriend and myself, and wanted to impress him with my homemaking skills.  Thanks for the recipe that made it easy to fool him!

These were good except the skins were annoying to chew and I ended up picking mine out while eating. The next time I made it I cubed the potatoes so the skins were much smaller. It made a lot of difference for me and I ended up eating the skins. Also I added garlic, parsley and a little paprika before serving.

I LOVED these mashed potatoes and didnt make a single adjustment, except for doubling the recipe since we had family over for dinner.  These came out perfect, so creamy and delicious.  Everyone thought these were great.  Definitely one of the best.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe. I didn't measure my ingredients, just put in enough to be a good consistency. I also added a sprinkle of cheese and bacon bits on the top. Yum, Yum!!!

These are excellent. I prefer to "rough" mash them with a hand masher, so they are not totally smooth. I also like to substitute 1/3 C. Cream Fraiche for the sour cream and reduce the butter to 1/3 C. Reminds me of a great French side dish.

These were very good.  Everyone liked them but my eldest son ended up picking out the skins because he did not like the way they tasted.  The rest of the family enjoyed everything about this dish including the flavor.  I made this with the Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style and it went wonderful together.  Thank you

These are the best red mashed potatoes I have ever had. These are better then the ones made in the gourmet store here. Thank You.
