This pie is very yummy!  I would only changed a couple of things.  I put 5 level Tablespoons of cornstarch instead of the 3 TBSP.  I also added 2 TBSP of lemon juice.  I would advise changing the oven temperature to 375 degrees because even after covering the edge of the crust it still got a little overdone on 425 degrees.  I would also not cook it on the bottom rack, but the middle rack.  Finally, wait at least 1 hour before cutting to let the cornstarch do its thing or you will end up with to much juice.  FRESH BLUEBERRYS ARE THE TICKET!!! AGAIN, VERY YUMMY!!! (loved it with vanialla ice cream)!

I'm giving this four stars because I had to tweak it some. I used 5 cups of blueberries, 6 tbsp of cornstarch and 1 1/4 c sugar, lowered the heat to 400 and it was perfect! The first one I made, I followed the recipe to a tee, except increased the cornstarch to 5 tbsp (per several other reviews) and baked at 425. It was very runny and it burned.

I loved this pie recipe!  It was super-easy to make, and it was delicious!  After reading the other reviews, I put in 4 tbsp of cornstarch instead of 3 tbsp, and it set without a problem.  Also, I added a splash of lemon juice to the blueberry mixture for some extra flavor, and I covered the edges of the pie crust with aluminum foil until the last 15 minutes (to prevent overbrowning).  A great recipe!

Perfect.  We found that this is a tart-sweet pie with the juices gelled just enough not to run out of the pie IF you use a lattice crust and very small fresh blueberries.
If you are making a solid top crust, or using cultivated "high bush berries", increase the cornstarch by 1 TBSP for each change.    
The 3/4 cup sugar can be increased to 1 cup for those who prefer a sweeter pie, but you'll need a bit more cornstarch since more sugar draws more juice out of the berries. 
I personally found the cooking time is accurate for a lattice top, but I had to lower the temp to 400 and increase the baking time to about 1 hour for a full top crust.  
Browning time on a crust varies widely.  Crusts with more fat, or that use butter as some/all of the fat will brown more quickly than a crust with less fat or all shortening/oil.
Be sure to try this pie with sharp cheddar cheese.  There's a reason New Englanders eat pie for breakfast!

This is an excellant pie! I have made 5 since I got it. I have used fresh blueberries and frozen blueberries. They both work great. The one thing I did different was that I added 5 cups of blueberries because I used my deep dish pie baker from Pampered Chef. I also followed the advice to us 5 tbs. constarch. As an added tip for everyone, I used, "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" sumitted by Stephanie. A wonderful pie crust. Everyone loved it and said it was the best Blueberry pie they had ever eaten. Crust and all. Thank you Beth and Stephanie! The two of you make a winning combination!

My husband said this was the best pie I'd ever made. I didn't have cornstarch, so I substituted 6 Tlbs. flour instead, and used a full cup of sugar. I used frozen blueberries, and a Walmart frozen deep dish pie crust. Delicious! Linda

I can't believe how incredibly easy it was to make this pie!  I used fresh blueberries, a squeeze of lemon, and the flakey butter pie crust recipe.  I agree with the recommendation for 4T cornstarch rather than 5T.  The first time I made this, I used 5T and it came out a bit rubbery - 4T is perfect.  I then brushed the top crust with milk, sprinkled sugar, and baked at 400F.  To keep the edges from burning, I covered them with foil and removed for the last 15 min.  The pie came out beautiful.  I couldn't help myself and had a piece after just an hour of cooling, but it was still pretty runny.  I had to let it sit an additional hour and it set perfectly.  I already had 2 slices (one at 10 am), and I can't wait to polish off the rest!

Very good, I used 6 cups of blueberries, 1.5 cups of sugar, 6 tablespoons of cornstarch, perfect One trick my mother taught me for fruit pies is to cook at 400 for the first 15 min, reduce heat to 350 and cook for 35 min. Cooks the bottom crust so it doesn't get soggy.

mmmm, have made this twice already. Once with just blueberries, the second time i added blackberries and strawberries. Both were excellent. I followed other reviewers and used 5 tablespoons of cornstarch. I found it was too much and made the pie a bit rubbery. I would recommend using 4 tablespoons at the most.

Fabulous pie!  Yum! I ate the whole thing!!! (hubby doesn't like fruit)  I used 4T cornstarch.  It was the first time I tried to make a pie with a top crust so I ran into some technical difficulties.  I burned the edges of the crust and didn't crimp the edges properly either.  Filling ran out all over the oven floor.  I recommend putting your pie plate on a cookie sheet and wrapping foil around the edges of the crust.  I believe I baked it for 10 minutes less than what the recipe called for also.

I followed the suggestions and used 4 tablespoons cornstarch, 4.5 cups blueberries and some lemon juice. Also, I used a crumble topping (3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup oats, 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp nutmeg, and 1/3 cup softened butter) instead of a second pie crust. Baked at 425 for 15 min and 350 for 35 min. Served with vanilla ice cream and it was DELICIOUS! The recipe was a hit.

Okay, I've tried this recipe a couple times now and am now ready to add my two cents.   If you have an abundance of berries, scale the recipe for 12 servings instead of 8 (this applies to the berry filling only). You will end up using 6 cups of berries for more of a deep dish fruit pie. Plus all the other ingredients will scale up as well. On top of the scaled recipe, I add an additional 2 tbsp of cornstarch to avoid the runnyness.   Now, the next part is my tinkering because I am not a fan of cinnamon with blueberries. So I omit that and add about 1/2 tsp lemon zest and  about 2 tsp of fresh lemon juice. Tastes so fresh!    For a nice finish on top, brush egg on your top crust and sprinkle with a bit of granulated white sugar. It will make your pie look professional and the sugar adds a bit of sparkle.   One final tip - bake your pie plate on a preheated baking sheet so your bottom crust will get nice and crisp instead of soggy.

Yummmmmmmmm!!! I'm only giving 4 stars bc i had to read a ton of reviews to figure out how much cornstarch and how long to bake.  I ended up using 4 1/2 cups blueberries and 5T of cornstarch, 3/4cups raw sugar and baked it on 375 for one hour, it came out perfect!  Not rubbery, not runny!  Add some vanilla ice cream on the side and it was perfecto!  Oh i also made a littice top and covered the edges while baking.  I will definitely make this again and again!

this recipe is GREAT!  I love that you don't have to cook the blueberries first.  just toss them in the sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and cinnamon, then put them in the crust and bake.  I've made it twice and found that the consistency is perfect, so long as you let it set up for at least 2 hours after you take it out of the oven.  I usually do equal numbers of cups of berries to tablespoons of cornstarch (4 C blueberries = 4 Tbl cornstarch) and it works well.  I also decreased the sugar to about 1/2 C, just to keep it a little lighter, and get more taste out of the berries.  that's just personal preference tho  :)  fantastic recipe!!

This pie was delicious. Based on other reviews I used 5 tbs cornstarch and found it to be perfect. I also sprinkled the lattice top with sugar in the raw because according to my husband it what his grandmother did and she was a very accomplished pie baker. This was a great recipe that I will be using again. I will however increase the sugar to 1 cup as my family (myself not included) seems to have a little more of a sweet tooth. Its not an overly sweet pie which is refreshing. I may also increase the recipe for the filling by another half since my pie plate is a little deeper. This was a terrific way to use blueberries that we just picked this morning.

If your pie to to "runny" try covering it completly with foil from the start and bake it for the full 50 with the foil then 10 more with out. Everyones oven is different, if you used 5tbs cornstarch and its still runny then you simply havent baked it long enough.

Wonderful blueberry pie!  Definitely a 5 star recipe.  My husband said it was the best he ever had and this is now my 9 yo's favorite pie.  It tasted even better the next day.  I used 5 c. frozen blueberries (use frozen), skipped the butter and added 2 tsp. lemon juice instead.  The juice really helps bring out and enhance the flavor.  The 1/2 tsp. cinnamon really helps the flavor too.  I also used 7 Tbsp. flour in lieu of the cornstarch.  Baked on middle rack at 425 for first 15 min, then reduced heat to 375 for an hour, until filling was bubbling in the center (I made 2 slits in the top crust, didn't do lattice).  I covered the outer crust after the fist 15 min.  Pie set up nice and wasn't runny at all (it was 7 hours before it was cut into ~ hard to wait but worth it!)  This is definitely my go-to blueberry pie recipe!  Thanks so much, ASHESP!

This was a great recipe.  I also recommend the following changes:  Use 1 Cup sugar, 4 T of cornstarch, and bake at 400 for 50-60 minutes.  The first time I made this, I used a lattice top - which I wasn't pleased with as the filling ran out.  The second time I used a double crust and this is the way to go folks.  You'll not be disappointed with this recipe.  The flavor was just perfect.

I used fresh blueberries and instead of cornstarch I used Tapioca Flour.  I also candied lemon rind and added a few very thin slices on top of the blueberries.  It made a delicious addition..not to sweet and added a hint of lemon flavor without being overly tart..just right.  The filling was had a nice texture, just the way I like my pie juicy without being watery and runny.  I baked the pie at 475 for 15 minutes and then reduced to 375 for about 40 minutes until I saw the blueberries bubbling and the crust nice and brown.  I also use a metal pie rim cover, to keep the rim of the pie from becoming to over browned.  Baked on a parchment covered pizza pan.

Listen to the other ladies on here and ADD 1 or 2 MORE TBL. sp. of cornstarch.  I usually do not alter someone's recipe, but noone likes a runny pie. It won't change the flavor and you're guaranteed the pie to set.  This really is a very YUMMY recipe.  I made two. One on Wed. and one Turkey Day morning with the leftover blueberries.  For those of you new to crusts, a few suggestions: Crack an egg into the pie shell and roll it around until it's covered, then dump it in the sink, the egg, not the pie.  Sprinkle the shell lightly with granulated sugar.  Once you put the the top shell on, sprinkle this lightly with sugar as well.   I might add too, that the second pie seemed to taste better, and the only difference was I doubled the cinnamon. Use frozen berries, pie will set better.  This is a keeper recipe.

This is a very good pie! I have a deep dish pie plate so I used 5 cups of berries, 1 cup of sugar and 4 T of cornstarch, and next time I may use a little more cornstarch because this was a little loose. I did use frozen berries I froze during the summer, but I let them thaw and drain, so I'm not sure if that was the problem. I will make this pie again, thanks for the recipe :)

This was delicious!  I served this at my Fourth of July family get-together and everyone gave it rave reviews - there wasn't any left by the end of our BBQ.  I baked it at 400 degrees and used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch.  I also brushed the inside of the crust with egg whites to prevent sogginess, brushed the lattice work and crust edge with butter and sprinkled them with sugar, and covered the edges with aluminum foil until the last 10 minutes of baking.  The pie came out perfect with a golden brown color, the blueberry filling just barely spilling out of each piece but mostly holding its shape.  It was just so sweet - so delectable!  I will definitely be making this again.

After reading some of the reviews, I changed the following:  Used 3 T cornstarch plus 3 T Minute Tapioca, and baked at 375 for 60 minutes.  The pie turned out wonderfully, holding itself together even when I cut it warm.  Great recipe!

Conceptually, this recipe is easy; however, the temperature is too high and the fruit preparation does not allow for consistency or thorough baking. The crust is brown before the berries cook thoroughly. I lowered the temperature to 350 degrees and cooked the berries and their ingredients on the stove until they began to thicken slightly. Then I poured them into the pie mold, arranged the top crust, and baked. Much better results ensued!

Wow. This is a really delicious recipe. I used fresh blueberries that we picked from the farm that day. Like other readers, I increased the cornstarch to 5T and used just over 1/2 cup sugar. I also added 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice and 1 teaspoon lemon zest. After I refrigerated the pie for 10 minutes, I cooked it at 425 degrees for 30 minutes in the lower half of my oven. Then I wrapped the crust loosely with foil, decreased the temp. to 350 minutes, placed a cookie sheet underneath the pie, and cooked for 25 minutes. The crust came out perfectly browned. You really do need to let the pie sit for 2 hours to allow the filling to gel so it's not runny. And after waiting 2 hours hours the pie was still warm. My picky eaters gobbled it up and my husband even went back for seconds!

Followed the recipe exactly. The pie burned, since even baking it for 45 minutes was too long. I covered the edges 15 minutes prior to it being done. Still burned. Need to specify that you need a deep-dish pie plate. Will not use this recipe again.

This pie is great! I did change some things, though. I used 5 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 3 like other reviewers said. I added a splash of lemon juice to the blueberries and baked at 375 on a rack in between the middle and bottom rack for 40 minutes. I hoped this helps, this is a great recipe!!

I applied advice from others, temp, corn starch, sugar...runny and took too long to bake...did not set up.  Better to buy one from a farm market, it's cheaper and just as good quality.  I think if one changes the recipe then should not offer a review as you are not reviewing the recipe given, you are reviewing your own modified recipe.

I read other people's review first, before making it. I, also,used minute tapioca instead of cornstarch, and the fruit held together without fail!! I did add 1 tbs. of lemon juice, and a full cup of sugar. It came out PERFECT! My husband loved it! This is the first time I've made a blueberry pie, and I'm thrilled how easy, and tasty it was. Thank you!

This is a really useful recipe. Nice touch to put cinnamon in it! Don't worry about the cornstarch, there are other ways to thicken your filling. I prefer to use tapioca to thicken my pies. You can use 1/4 cup in this recipe, just let it sit with the sugar and other filling ingredients while you are making the pastry so the tapioca can begin softening. The great thing about tapioca is that it is clear when the pie is done so the color of the berries is stunning, and the texture is perfect. You don't have to have a runny pie even if you have a solid crust.

Fine recipe.  I use store crust and fresh berries which are in season here in Maine.  A lot of talk about thickening the pie in the other reviews.  I always thought blueberry pie was supposed to be runny, but if you want to thicken it, don't add more cornstarch or flour or whatever... add two tablespoons of tapioca.  In the words of one old Maine pie baker..."A little tapioca goes a long way."

This is the first pie I've ever baked, and it was delicious! I used fresh blackberries from my yard, instead of blueberries. And I upped the cornstarch to 4tbsp after reading the other reviews. It turned out perfect!

Fresh or frozen blueberries both work excellent in this recipe. I've mostly used frozen wild blueberries with about 5 tbsp of cornstarch and the thickness and texture are perfect. Absolutely delicious with a flaky latice-top pie crust.

My first time making a blueberry with fresh blueberries. I actually made a three berry fresh pie, with raspberries and blackberries. I did read the reviews and used 4 T of cornstarch, and probably about five cups of fruit. I totally forgot to dot with the butter, but was great and less fattening without it. I did cook on middle shelf at 385 for 50 minutes, covering the crust edges with tinfoil and uncovering the last ten minutes. Turned out perfect... was gone in one night...but then I never bake pies except at the holidays. But blueberries were on sale!
Oh and I read the AR article on the left on how to do a lattice crust...was a great help...since I've never made a lattice crust before.

This pie was very easy and yummy!!! I took the suggestions of several other peoples' reviews...  I added 5 T of cornstarch, turned oven down to 400 degrees, used 1/2 cup each of white and brown sugar and omitted the butter. It baked for 50 minutes and turned out wonderfully. My husband loves blueberry pie (I made it for him) and he loved this recipe.  Thanks, Beth!

This blueberry pie is excellent!  I used 4 TBSP cornstarch, beacuse I like my pies firm.  Keep a cookie sheet under this pie, because it would have been a mess if it had boiled over to the bottom of the oven!  By far, the best fruit pie I have ever made!

Awesome pie!  I took another reviewer's advice and added 5T of corn starch instead of 3.  It was a good call - once it cooled, the pieces came out very neatly.  I made it with the Better Homes and Gardens crust.  I don't remember using cinnamon in my previous pies but after baking this it's a must.  This is my new standard blueberry pie : )

This is a great blueberry pie recipe but there are some changes to be made.  Add 2 tblsp of lemon juice, 5 tblsp of cornstarch, 6-7 cups of blueberries,  let it sit for 2-3 hours, and set the temperature to 375.  The lattace top makes it look really proffesional eventhough its not that hard. (just putting that out there)

As is, the recipe resulted in a delicious but very watery pie the three times I tried it. Most definately increase the cornstarch. I am up to 3 times the amount suggested and I think a little more will be about right. Must chill for some time to be firm.  It seems that powdered ingredients must be evenly distributed for the pie to work well. The best way I found to accomplish this was to have the berries slightly damp and put them in a large bowl with the dry ingredients, toss around until the berries are fully coated then distribute the berries and dry evenly around the crust.  So far that was the most succesful attempt.  Nonetheless, no matter how watery, every last bit was eaten.

So good! I used just enough water to dissolve 4 Tbls of cornstarch. To help thicken the pie, put the blueberries, sugar, 1 Tbls lemon juice, and the water/cornstarch mixture in a pan on the stove top. Stir and bring to a boil, turn off and take off heat. I took others suggestions and made the Basic Flaky Pie Crust by Stephanie. This pie was amazing! Beautiful and delicious. Baked at 400, for 45 minutes.

I followed some of the other reviewers advice (sorta) and added 4 tbls. cornstarch instead of the 3 the recipe called for and it actually could have used 5 tbls.!  It was still delicious and best when eaten still slightly warm.  I let mine cool for about 3 hours out on the table before serving and it was great! Also, I sprinkled sugar ontop of the lattice eggwashed crust which really added a sweet tasty crunch to the crust.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

I listened to other reviews and added 4 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 3, baked it on 375°F, and let it sit for one hour. The pie made the whole house smell delicious, so I eagerly cut open the pie to see what it tasted like. The pie, although VERY liquidy, looked like it made a great "pile" (a dish I used to make in my childhood, where I'd bake a pie and then literally pile the piece onto my plate, so it looked somewhat like a crumble, but even yummier), so I piled the piece onto my plate. It tasted amazing! I added some vanilla ice cream on the side, and that balanced the tart flavor of the blueberries. Then I let the rest of the pie sit overnight, and in the morning, although still liquidy, I was able to get a solid piece out.

I will be making this again, because it made an absolutely amazing "pile".

The best blueberry pie that I have ever had!!! My husband also loves it and said that it is the best blueberry pie that he has ever had as well.
This recipe is a real keeper, I liked the fact that it was not to sweet and you could really taste the blueberries. I did not have cornstarch so I substituted it with flour,and that worked great, I used frozen blueberries and it wasn't to sloppy at all, as long as you let your pie set for a while, but that is the same with every pie, the only thing that I might do differently is take it down to 1/2 a cup of suger instead of 3/4 of a cup.
Thankyou so much for the recipe, it has passed the test and is going into the cookbook!

OK.....I have this down to a science. **at least for me**  First off....I have never added the salt. (personal prefer) and I use 5 cups of fruit because we like a fruity pie....I DO use the called for 3 Tbls. of cornstarch BUT add 2 Tbls. of instant tapioca.  I do my bottom crust and put in the fruit....I take all my sugar, tapioca and cornstarch and cinnamon and wisk it all in a small bowl....pour that evenly over my berries and dot the top w/butter.....lay on the top crust and bake it.  This is SUPER SIMPLE and PERFECT.....I feel (JMHO) you don't need a lot of "stuff" in a fresh fruit pie because....well....WHY?!  Simple is good and THIS RECIPE?  GOOD!  A million thanks for posting this....it's going into my forever recipe book.  OH!  P.S.  DO let this SIT and cool off before trying to cut into it or you will have a runny mess...this pie HAS to sit and "gel" if you will.

This is the most simple & delicious pie.  I used fresh blueberries & served it with Lemon Ice Cream (also on this site).  I made it for a friend's 40th birthday as this is her favorite kind of pie.  It was devoured.  Not too sweet & not too runny since I used fresh berries.  I don't even like blueberry pie, but LOVE this pie.

So glad we didn't use the recipe with twice the sugar.  This was perfect.  We used blueberries we picked here in Central Florida and they made an absolutely delicious pie!

This is an excellent and easy to make recipe.  I used frozen blueberries, increased the sugar to 1 cup and the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons.  I also baked it on the bottom rack at 400 for 50 minutes and it came out delicious.

Oh my word! This recipe is outstanding. I had some not-so-fresh blueberries that tasted okay but had a squishy texture. I was worried about how they'd taste in a pie, but they were great. I followed the recipe as written, except I lowered the temperature to 375 and cooked the pie for 50 minutes. It was a little overcooked, next time I'll check it at 45 minutes. For the crust, I used the Pastry for Double Pie-Crust recipe and made a lattice top.

This a wonderful recipe-we love cinnamon and not a lot of blueberry pie recipes call for it....I added and extra 1/2 teaspoon.  An excellent crust for this is Martha Stewart's pate brisee -delicious!

If i could give this zero stars I would. It deserves one star cause the taste was good ( nothing to write home about but good) Also, this did not hold together well at all. My pie was runny and watery and did not hold together. The cornstarch measurement should be about double. I needed a slice of this for a photo shoot and it's so runny that it's completely useless

This is the best ever. I'm a heat and serve kinda girl, nothing i make ever comes out right, but this came out perfectly! I was so thrilled, and it tasted great too. I added extra cornstartch (6tbsp), but when i cut into it while it was still pretty hot it was still too runny. Later after it had cooled down, it was VERY very solid, so today when i make it again, ill stick with 5. I also used frozen blueberries and was about a half cup over, but threw them in anyway, and used a full cup of sugar. MMM so good.

This is a perfect  blueberry pie recipe - both incredibly simple and delicious.  I used 4 tbsp cornstarch and let the pie cool at room temperature for 90 minutes, and there were no problems.  Also, I had to use frozen blueberries, so I thawed 2 16 oz bags, then drained off the excess water to avoid runniness.  I made this with "Best Ever Pie Crust" - also a wonderfully simple yet tasty and traditional recipe.

I have made this recipe multiple times now, and I have never had anybody tell me that it is anything short of amazing.  I do use 5 Tbsp corn starch instead of 3.  I used 4 tbsp this last time I made it, and it was a little soupy.  I will go back to using 5.  Do NOT skip out on the cinnamon.  I feel like it is an ingredient that really makes the pie.  I have used various amounts of sugar depending on how healthy I was being at the time, and honestly, it always tastes good.  I would probably tend to go more in the direction of using less.  It will be plenty sweet.  I cover the edges of the pie crust with foil until the last 15 minutes, and it definitely keeps it from getting too brown.  It is also fun to put different shapes on the top rather than a lattice. Either way, I highly recommend this recipe.

I followed the advice of some previous reviewers and put in 1 cup sugar and 5 T cornstarch. I had to use 1/2 fresh and 1/2 frozen blueberries since they're out of season and expensive. I also added an egg wash and cinnamon sugar on the top crust for shine.

The flavor of my pie was perfect, but it was still too runny, even though it cooled for 1 full day in the fridge before eating. The sauce was delicious on ice cream, but I would have preferred a thicker filling.

The only thing I would change from the original recipe is that it needed more cornstarch.  My pie was very runny, but it still tasted great!

If I could give this more stars I would!  I don't like blueberry pie but my family does so I made this for Thankgiving...PERFECT PIE:)  I used 4 cups of blueberries (frozen), 5tblsp cornstarch, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 2tbsp of butter and a dash of lemon juice.  We had about 10 different deserts on the table and this was the first to go.  Presentation was beautiful and the filling held up.  Thank you for my new favorite pie recipe:)

Just a basic blueberry pie, good flavor and as easy as any other pie to make. My daughter made this one and used frozen blueberries and frozen pastry. It turned out better than I expected. Great!

Wow!  I made this 3 times in two weeks.  Delicious.  The only thing I found is that if you use berries that are semi-frozen you need to add more cornstarch.  I added 5 T last time and it worked better.  Also, I baked it at 350 deg for 1 hr and it was perfect!  Thanks for sharing!

I picked this recipe due to the ease of making, and I was not disappointed. My husband and I thought this the best Blueberry Pie I have ever made. I used the Best Ever Crust recipe also and it was very good and very easy to roll.The only change I made to this recipe was 4T of cornstarch intead of 3, 400degrees instead of 425 and I covered the crust edges with foil,because it was browning too fast.

My husband and I absolutely loved this pie.  This was my first time ever baking a pie and it turned out perfect, better then the store bought one.  I read the other reviews and also used 4 Tbls of cornstarch and baked the pie at 375. Edges did not burn at all.  Great pie recipe!!!!

4.15.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/12196/blueberry-pie/ ... Love it.  This is Bevy's Blueberry Pie.  I usually use 1/3c flour for fresh; 1/2c flour, frozen.  The cinnamon is undetectable, but makes a good pie even better.  With homegrown berries being more juicy at peak season, a runny pie may happen occasionally; but there are worse things than having to eat a homemade blueberry pie with a spoon!

One of the easiest fruit pies I've ever made, so simple to throw together.  I've had a problem finding a blueberry pie recipe that is not too tart, not too sweet & was thrilled with this one.  The filling sets up perfectly. Followed the directions, but did turn down the temp pretty quickly as the crust would have been too dark otherwise.  Next time I'll bake it at 375 instead.  Perfect warmed up w/a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream!

Made pretty much as written, with slightly less sugar and slightly more cinnamon. Used commercial pie crust dough, which was not too good, but the filling was really excellent, with a nice consistency - not glue-y and not all falling out of the crust. Will try again with either homemade or different brand of crust.

This was delightful! I didn't really make it to the instructions, but it came out sooo good! I used 4 cups of fresh blueberries and about 1 1/4 cup frozen blackberries, a little under 3/4 cup splenda and about 1/8 cup brown sugar. I also added a small amount of vanilla because I think it tastes nice. I only used one pie crust to lower the carbs (I made a lattice board on top in a 2qt casserole dish). And added a mix of 2 Tablespoons cornstarch and 2 tablespoons flour. Cooked it at 375 for 35 minutes and then 425 for 10 minutes, let it sit for 60 minutes to firm up. It was WONDERFUL! :D

I made this pie twice - first I followed the recipe, then I made some adjustments.  The first pie was very runny (that was the only issue) so in my second pie I added 6 tbsp. corn starch to 5 cups of blueberries.  After 20 minutes of baking I put foil over the crust edges to keep them from burning.  This pie was gone in 15 minutes!  Everyone was complaining that there wasn't more to go around.  Definitely a keeper.

YUM! :) First time making a blueberry pie.. used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust & made a beautiful lattice top. It looked very pretty and professional, if I do say so myself. lol. I used 4 cups of fresh blueberries, about 5 tbl cornstarch, 3/4 c sugar, & a couple of splashes of lemon juice. I cooked it on the center rack at 375 degrees for 52min or so. I let it sit for about 3 hours before slicing and it was perfectly set. Not sweet at all and great blueberry flavor. It went great with vanilla ice cream..... mmmmmm.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the filling came out very runny, and it ruined my pie crust.  I was very frustrated by the waste of blueberries... I will most definitely NOT use this recipe again...

Wow this was DELISH! I used 6 T of flour like the other reviewer because I didn't have cornstarch and my fiance thought cornstarch would have been better but it didn't matter to me, this pie was amazing. I used a full cup of sugar and ready made pie crusts. Can't say enough good things about this pie, looking forward to making another with strawberries and blackberries like another reviewer below. THANK YOU!

I made this pie last night turned out great. The only things I changed were 5Tbs of cornstarch instead of 3 and cooked at 400 on middle rack for 50 min. We let it  sit all night  and really enjoyed it today not runny at all.

Big hit with coworkers!  I used 5 cups blueberries, 6 tbsp cornstarch, and 1 cup sugar.  Forgot to dot with butter, but nobody was the wiser.  This went great with the basic flaky pie crust recipe on this site, and the lattice top was a lot of fun to make!

i used 5 cups frozen wild blueberries, 4 tbsp cornstarch, 1 cup sugar and 1 tbsp lemon juice.(the trick is to taste your fruit, since not all blueberries are the same sweetness) i made the lattice top brushed it with milk and sprinkled the pastry with sugar. Awesome!! my first fruit pie was a hit Thank you!

My pie was great.  I really liked how well it set up.  I did not do the lattice top, due to time.  It did get a little to brown around outside edge of crust, which should be covered for a portion of the cook time.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I took another reviewer's advice and added 1 extra TBSP of cornstarch. that was 4 TBSP of Cornstarch.  Turned out perfect.  I think to make sure that it has gelled enough, make very early in the morning if serving for dinner. I did not refigerate it. Served at room temp.  It is a keeper.

This pie was wonderful!  I added about 4 Tablespoons cornstarch and 2 Tablespoons lemon juice like one of reviews said.  I brought this pie to my in-laws and everyone who was there, loved it!  Will make again and again.

I made this yesterday for my family and I was slightly dissapointed. I made it as the recipe stated with fresh berries but i took other reveiwers advice and added a bit more sugar about 1 cup because i like my pies sweet. Having said that everything else i did to the dot but when i cooked it I found the crust edges browned far too quickly and the the top wasnt even cooked yet. 

The oven temp needs to come down and the cooking time go up i think to about 190 degrees C and 1hr 10m would do it. 

I also found that once cooled when i tried it it was blandish and had no real character. But today I had a piece for breakfast with toasted meusli and it was far batter the next day and when chilled not warm or room temp. If eating it the same day serve it with cream or icecream cause it really needs a little something.

Overall it was OK.

This was REALLY easy to make and really yummy. I'd never made a pie before and it was so easy. The pre-made pie crusts really help.

EXCELLENT!  For those complaining of "runny", boil all the ingredients over medium for about 5 minutes, and forget dotting with butter.  It was PERFECT.

I suggest mixing all of the ingredients first and bringing them to a boil.  First they will get pretty runny but if you keep them at a boil they will eventually start to stick together much better.  This prevents the runny pie problem.

This is by far the best blueberry pie I have ever eaten and made. I'm a professional personal chef and I made this last night for a dinner party - every one raved about it. 

The only thing I'd change is the cornstarch, more makes a less oozy pie. But I have no complaints!

I tried to do everything everyone suggested: 5T of cornstarch, tinfoil covered edges, letting the pie sit for several hours.  I even let the pie sit OVERNIGHT, nearly for 24 HOURS, and it STILL turned out a horrible, liquid, disappointing and especially embarrassing mess.  I don't know how it worked for so many people, but I've got standards and this pie does not meet them.  I would have been better off throwing 4 expensive cups of blueberries, 1 cup of sugar, two pie shells and 5T of cornstarch into a blender and drinking the result.  It would have been more gratifying, at least.

This is very easy and tasty.  I used 6T cornstarch because I had 5C fresh blueberries.  It was a little runny, though, even after 1 hour of baking and 4 hours of cooling (3 hours in the fridge); so, the next time I use 5C blueberries, I'll try 7T cornstarch.  Then, the consistency should be perfect. Also, I might use 1T or so of fresh-squeezed lemon in the future; I really couldn't taste the cinnamon, though I upped the amount a little because of the extra C of berries. Anyway, this recipe is very good, with the necessary modification of extra cornstarch.

This is the first time I have ever made a blueberry pie.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and it turned out perfectly.  I would not change a thing.  This is a keeper.  I look forward to many more blueberry pies.  It is the easiest pie I have ever made.  :)

Delicious!  I used 1/2 cup of sugar and 4 tablespoons cornstarch, and added lemon juice to the top of my berries in the pie crust.  I made my crust out of whole wheat pastry flour (recipe from the bag of Bob's Red Mill flour).  This pie was one of the best I've ever had.  Such a wonderful fresh flavor.  I made homemade vanilla ice cream to go with it (Easy Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream from this site).  The combination was wonderful!

This pie was sooo easy! I have a hard time making pie crust so I used frozen (and frozen blueberries as well). I used 3 heaping Tbsp of flour and 3/4 cup Splenda...Oh my gosh is it ever good.  Wonderful birthday pie for hubby! Everyone loved it! Not too runny, after 2 hours of sitting and NOT pasty and thick, either. 
Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Absolutely the best blueberry pie ever!!! I did use 5T of cornstarch as other reviewers had suggested. I cut into it while still slightly warm and pieces were perfect (not runny at all). I also added a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and a teas of lemon zest. Just rolled out second crust and vented (rather than doing a lattice), brushed with milk and sprinkled with sugar. I used blueberries that I froze last summer so I did cook at 375 but for about 70 min. Used the recipe for the "best pie crust" also from this site. Perfect! Thanks

Perfect blueberry pie.  I added more cornstarch (5 Tbsp.) for thickening and if you don't want it to run you've got to be sure it sits for good 2-3 hours or so after you take it out of the oven.  I had to make another because the 1st was gone in 1 day.

Super, super easy!! This is the ONLY Blueberry pie recipe you need. I used frozen berries and increase the sugar slightly. I also used mini cookie cutters for vent holes and an egg wash and sprinling of white suger to give the crust a nice finish. Absolutely delicious!!

Many reviews mention the pie being runny. I borrowed some ideas from the Raspberry Pie 1 by Susan. For the thickening: mix sugar (I increased to one cup), salt, and cinnamon as directed above, but then add 8 teaspoons cornstarch and 2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca to the mix. Mix in blueberries (I used a rounded 4 cup measure of berries ) and 6 tablespoons water. Mix and let stand for about 30 minutes (meanwhile make pastry and preheat oven). This is from the raspberry recipe, and it works! I've made three raspberry pies (2 black and 1 red) and 2 blueberry pies using this method, and all were well set. I also used the baking directions from the raspberry recipe: 425 for 15 (to 20) minutes, reduce to 350 for 45 minutes. No need to cover the edges, and crust doesn't burn. Thanks to ASHESP for this great blueberry pie recipe and to Susan for the excellent raspberry pie recipe and its thickening and baking directions. I shared my latest blueberry pie with some friends recently, and the raves were almost embarrassing.

This was the first pie I ever made from scratch, and it is the best blueberry pie my husband has every eaten, and being from Michigan he has eaten many a blueberry pies in his day. I took the advice of other reviews and added almost 5 cups of blueberries with equal parts cornstarch since I had a deep dish pyrex pie pan. I made a (flour, butter,sugar, 7-up) top crust, also my first time making that. The only thing I did differently was cooked the pie for 40 minutes with edges covered with foil and another 40 uncovered. I think the extra cooking time really let this pie set up. It held together as it should without being jelled together. This is definitely my blue berry pie go to recipe. I even used fresh picked then frozen blueberries in this pie, if you do the same, DO NOT thaw and rinse first. Use straight from frozen.Amazing if I could rate 10 stars I would

The flavor was great although it turned out a little runny.  I used frozen blueberries.  I should have rinsed them under running water then blotted them dry before tossing them with the dry ingredients.  I will definitely try this recipe again!

I increased the cornstarch and it was still runny; and agree with another rater who said she prefers tapioca for a thickener.   I also thought this pie was tasteless, but that is probably because I can't find wild blueberries here.   Farm grown blueberries just don't taste like blueberries should to me, so I think I would prefer a blueberry pie with something else for flavor (a crumble topping, etc).

OMG, this was soooooo good but I changed it up a lot (used healthier ingredients). I used a spelt pie crust (purchased at Sprouts). Used a oatmeal crumb topping. Used arrowroot instead of cornstarch (used 5 tbps but needed more arrowroot because 5 tbps still made it a little bit runny). Used piloncillo sugar instead of white sugar.

This was excellent and did not run AT ALL. The only changes I made were to increase the cornstarch to 4-5 Tbsp (as many of the reviews suggested) and to add a splash of lemon juice. I made this early on and let it cool all day. By dessert time, it was perfect and each slice held its shape perfectly. I used fresh blueberries and store-bought crust.

I would lower the temperature on the oven as it is set WAY too high and the crust burns.  I was so aggravated after having spent so much time and energy into making the crust from the scratch only pull out a charred pie.

YUM!  Used 4 Tbls of cornstarch and 1 Tbls of lemon juice.  To save time, used a store bought refrigerated  crust.  I think the key is to let the pie cool for at least 1 hour.  Turned out great - set nicely and tasted delicious.  Super easy!  Yes, I would make this again! Thanks.

I read comments from those who tried out this pie and gave their recommendations on alterations to the recipe. I ended up with a delectable blueberry pie. My portions were 4-1/2 cups of fresh blueberries, 2/3 cup of sugar, 4-1/2 tablespoons of cornstarch, juice of 1 small lemon, lemon zest, and about 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg. I mixed it all together and then cooked it on the stove top on low to medium heat for about 5 minutes. I cooked the pie at 400 deg F for 15 minutes, then 350 deg F for another 35 minutes. Crust did not burn. After it sat for about 3 hours we cut it and it was perfectly firm and juicy. It didn't collapse on the plate, but kept its shape. I will DEFINITELY make this recipe again, but will reduce sugar to 1/2 cup as my family doesn't have a sweet tooth. Thanks to all for your recommendations!!!!

This was amazing.  As recommended by other reviewers, I increased the cornstarch to  5 Tbls, may try 6 next time.  I also added some fresh ground ginger (did not measure). I decreased the oven temp to 400 and it was perfect.  I did not have to cover the edges of the crust with foil and it was beautiful.  Will use again!

Easily the simplest and BEST blueberry pie ever with a few modifications: 1) 5 TBSP cornstarch instead of 3, 2) 2 TBSP lemon juice, 3) Crushing 1/4-1/3 of the blueberries with a fork to release the juices.  Mmmmm...perfect!

Was looking for the perfect recipe for my first ever attempt at making a Blueberry Pie.  Based on the great reviews, this was my pick and I'm so happy with my decision!  Based on other reviews, I added an additional teaspoon of cornstarch, and also about a teaspoon of lemon juice.  It turned out perfect!  My hubby said I could win a contest with this recipe!

This pie is delicious and easy to make, as it was my first time ever making a pie. As mentioned, it does require a little slight tweaking. I followed the previous reviewers' advice and used 5T of Corn Starch instead of 3 and it yielded jellied perfect. Also, I baked for 40-45 minutes at 425 and the edges burned slightly in some places even though I covered in aluminum foil until the last ten minutes. Last, I used frozen berries, because of availability and cost but I could've added a little more sugar because of this. All in all the recipe is great and I will definitely be using it again!

This pie was a huge hit with the family. I used 5 qts of fresh blueberries and baked the pie in my Pampered Chef deep dish pie plate. Instead of the lattice crust, I opted for a full crust and used a decorative cut-out to put a hole in the center.

Marc said it was the best pie I have ever made. I used 5 cup of frozen wild blueberries and increased cornstarch to 6 Tbsp. This was too much berries, it barely fit in the pie crust. Also, I turned the temp down to 400 and it was under cooked at 50 minutes. Despite all of this, it was excellent and next time, with a few adjustments it will get 10 stars!

The recipe was very easy to prepare, i did how some suggested and added more cornstarch and lemon. I will take out the cinnimon next time as it covered the blueberry taste i was looking for. you must wait until the pie has completley cooled for it not be runny, and i cooked it at a less temp, but found my underneath was not fully cooked so next time i will pre cook this for a few min as well.

The pie was very good. Used 4c frozen blueberries that I had picked a couple months ago.  I used 5T of cornstarch and the pie was very, very runny.  I did a full top, baking at 400 for about 53 minutes.  I will try to make again but have to find a way to get rid of the runny-ness.....

Loved it! Made a double recipe with a simple crust. I have shallow pans so I just split up the filling into 2. I wish I added another cup of blueberries and I followed reviews to add 5 T cornstarch instead of 3T and also added a splash of lemon juice in each pie. I omitted the salt because it's bad for you and forgot the butter, but it was still great! The lattice doesn't need to be entirely covering the top of the pie, the inside is great!

Hands down best pie I have ever eaten.  We picked fresh blueberries for this one and I used the "butter flaky crust" recipe from this site.  So flavorful and complemented the blueberries so well.  This is officially in the family summer traditions from now on.

My first blueberry pie and it turned out wonderful! I followed the instructions almost to the letter. The only changed I made were using one whole cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup and I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch. Making pie crust from scratch isn't my thing so I used two refrigerated crusts. I tried to wait for the pie to cool and thicken before cutting it but failed miserably. Even warm and runny it was still excellent.

I would add a bit more than 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch, but not 5 Tablespoons as some others said to do. It became too thick with 5 Tablespoons. I also added a few dashes of nutmeg and 1 1/2 Tablespoons of lemon juice. I did not add the butter (I forgot) but it still turned out fine. This is a good generic recipe. Be careful to pile the crust up very high or else it will bubble over!

I followed this recipie exactly with the exception of adding 1 more Tbs of cornstarch and a bit of lemon, and it was absolutely perfect. I made this on Memorial day for grandpa who said the last time he had blueberry pie was in 1943. He said the only problem was that I didn't give him enough vanilla ice cream to go with it! I tried to take a photo of the pie, but it was gone before I got the chance! Will be using this for years to come.

I like to use this recipe as a base for most of my berry pie fillings! It really good especially if you add the lemon juice (about 2 tbl)

Nice pie. After reading the reviews I made it with 5Tbs of cornstarch and baked it at 400 degrees instead of 375. Came out perfect with my frozen berries from the summer. I even uploaded a picture of the pie , it was so nice.

Very easy!  Only changes I made were to put 5 cups of blueberries and I added a little more sugar, as my blueberries were slightly tart.    WONDERFUL reviews from my men! :)

This was absolutely scrumptious! The most delicious pie I've ever made-- my mom got up early, saw the pie on the table, and ate almost half of it by herself before stopping because it was so good.    I made several changes though after reading the other reviews: I used about 4 tbsp of cornstarch instead of 3; the juices jelled just enough so that it wasn't runny.  I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup since my blueberries were pretty sweet and also because my family doesn't like too-sweet desserts.  I used the No Fail Pie Crust III recipe, and together, the pie was amazing!! :)

The crust was very light and flaky, but the recipe only made enough to cover the bottom of the pie plate.  I had to make another crust for the top.  Also, the filling was sooooo runny it may as well have been soup.  Very disappointed with this recipe.

For those that had soupy pies--for me the key was 5 C fresh berries at ROOM TEMPERATURE! I also added the 5 1/2 T of cornstarch per other reviews. Baked at 400 for 55 minutes, let it cool for 2 hours and it was perfect. THANKS ASHESP!! Fab recipe! :o)

1.  Add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice for extra flavour. 2.  3 tablespoons of instant tapioca works very well instead of cornstarch as thickening agent. 3.  4 1/2 cups of blueberries boosted the 'fill'

I substituted 6 tbsp of flour for cornstarch, 1 cup of sugar, and some extra cinnamon. I let it sit out on the counter while we went out to dinner.... it set up beautifully! Great recipe, everyone loved it!

Excellent flavor!  Increased recipe to 5 c. blueberries and 5 T. cornstarch and baked at 400.  Next time will try with 6 T. cornstarch as it was still a little runny. Definite keeper though!

I made only a few slight changes, and I really love the results. I added an additional tbs of cornstarch per other reviewers. I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh (tasted just fine too). I also brushed the shell with egg white and baked the bottom one for 5 minutes and sprinkled sugar on the top shell. My husband normally doesnt like fruit pies, but he loved this one. Great recipe!

This tasted delicious, but even though we took other reviewer's advise and added 5tsp of corn starch it was still very runny.  Almost like berries and berry juice in a pie crust.

Turned out perfectly.  I made a deep dish pie with a solid top, and frozen blueberries so I followed reviewers' tips:  oven at 400 degrees, 5 T cornstarch, 5 c. blueberries, 1 c. sugar, 1 T lemon juice, brushed top with milk & sprinkled with sugar.  I used a pie crust shield for the edges and removed it after 45 minutes and baked it another 15 minutes.  It does help it thicken when you allow it to cool for at least 2 hours.

I had a bunch of premade tart shells that I wanted to use up, so instead of making a pie the filling made about 2 dozen blueberry tarts.  Tasted wonderful.  Instead of the cinnamon I used freshly squeezed lemon juice, and I increased the cornstarch to 4 1/2 tbsp.  I've made this recipe with both fresh and frozen berries, and they turned out amazing both times.  Because I was only baking tarts, I decreased the oven temp to 350F and baked them for about 45 minutes until the crust was a nice golden brown.  Delish!

5 star recipe! Made it as directed, but I made a two crust and baked at 400 for 50 minutes, AND I used Altern (Splenda). Boyfriend couldn't wait for it to cool and is now eating it hot with vanilla ice cream. He's happy!

Wonderful pie.  The recipe is excelent as is. If you are going to use a full top crust just turn the heat down to 400, increase time to 1 hr, and increase corn starch to 4tbsp (1/4 cup). I also use a deep dish pan.

I made this for my mom, who's a sugar addict.  Added 4 tbls of cornstarch and upped the sugar to 1 cup.  Heated everything in a pot on the stove, then poured into a baked pie shell where it set perfectly - delicious!  Used 2 pounds of blueberries to make 2 pies.  Definitely will make again.

Used refrigerate store bought crust that you unroll & bake. Three packs of blueberries = 3 cups for me + 1 cup sugar = just sweet enough. Used just under 4 tbsp cornstarch. Not too runny, not too stiff. At 425F, had to remove from oven in just under 40 mins as crust was getting burnt. Might try 375F next time.

Modifications:
1 additional tbl of cornstarch
Cooked at 375 for 45 minutes

Verdict:
HUGE raves from work.  Only suggestion was to egg was the top crust and sprinkle with sugar next time (I'll use raw sugar to do this).

Excellent. However, I made it with Splenda and it did not melt like real sugar therefore the blueberries rolled around and were not stuck together. My family told me it tasted excellent, but looked like rabbit poop. Moral of the story - Use regular sugar!!!!!!!!

Super good and Super easy! I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, just not the right time of year for fresh. I let them defrost before I used them. It was my first time making a pie and I'm excited to make my next one because it was so easy! Thanks for the good recipe!

awesome! awesome! awesome! I added 1/4 cup brown sugar and put 6 tablespoons of cornstarch because I used frozen blueberries I had from blueberry picking. I just rinsed the frozen berries in cool water and lightly patted dry before coating with mixture. My husband never liked blueberry pie until this recipe

Very good pie, and super easy to make.  I made it for a family get together and it was gone before I knew it.  I did increase the corn starch as others suggested, ~4 1/2 Tbsp.  I would recommend using more than a quart of blueberries.  Mine didn't really fill the pie and the top crust dropped in a bit.  I think it would look much nicer if it were full (although you risk a mess oven, so bake w/ a cookie sheet beneath it).  I love a homemade crust... but the Pilsbury refrigerated ones are fantastic if you're looking to save time.

PS - this was great topped with whipped cream!

Great recipe, A++++++ from me and my brood of 5 kids. I did add 5 tabelspoon's of cornstarch and I baked it at 375 like the others said and it turned out great :) I used fresh berries with some of them frozen and they came out just fine. Verry easy and fast to make. I will defenitly be making this pie again.

This was wonderful! Update I tried this again and used 2 and a half tablespoons of cornstarch and 2 tablespoons of tapioca.  Comes out perfect everytime.  I have made it this way around 7 times now.  Everyone keeps asking me to make this pie.

This was the best blueberry pie I've ever made.  My husband agreed and couldn't stop telling me so.  I did make some changes to make it a little more healthy.  I made the pie crust with 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour.  I used Splenda instead of sugar every where it called for sugar.  I also used 5 cups of fresh organic blueberries and increased the cornstarch accordingly.  Instead of using more crust on top I used a crumb topping with 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour and Splenda as well.  It all turned out perfect and very tasty!  Definitely a make again and again and again...

This was a great recipe however I did add an extra tablespoon of corn starch because I don't like it soupy.  I also would cut down the sugar to half a cup because it was a little too sweet for me but I think that all depends on your blueberries that you are using.

This is excellent. If you let the pie cool completely before cutting into it, it won't be too runny. So you have to plan way in advance and allow at least 2-3 hours for cooling. You can always throw the pie in the oven for a couple minutes to warm it up if you like your icecream on top to melty. I did end up throwing in an extra cup of blueberrys, but I didn't add anymore sugar or anything else and it still came out tasty. In addition, since I used frozen blueberries, I had to let it bake for about an extra 25 minutes.

Made this tonight and it was really good, especially warm with vanilla ice cream!  

I used 4T of cornstarch to thicken but to make sure it didn't clump like other reviewers complained of I sifted it into the sugar and then mixed it around before adding the other ingredients.  It was still a bit runny with the 4T, so next time I'll try 4.5-5T.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla and upped the amount of cinnamon to 1 tsp.  Be sure to foil the crust for a portion of the cooking time or else it will burn.  Yummy recipe!!

Excellent.  I too used 5T cornstarch. The first time I made it I used 3T, and although the taste was delicious, it was very runny.  I also used frozen blueberries and they were fine.  Thanks Beth!

I made this for the first time for a wedding rehearsal and people were all talking about if everyone had tried the "blueberry pie". It was a hit and gone within minutes! I however used the advice about adding 5 Tablespoons of cornstarch and had no problem with it being runny. I also set the pie with the filling in it before baking in the fridge like someone else mentioned for 10 minutes and then I cooked it at 375 degrees for 60-70 minutes. However I put it on the MIDDLE rack and I made sure to put foil around my edges so they wouldn't burn.(I just kept my eye on it till it looked brown enough)It needs to stand a good 2-3 hours though before you dive into it! Which is hard to do! AWESOME RECIPE! (and EASY!)

Very Good!  I took the advice of others who've made this and added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken the filling. It worked great.  I made turnovers with Pepperidge Farm pastry puff dough and this recipe made enough for 2 turnovers.  I put some melted butter on them when they were done and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top.  Excellent!!

This a great and simple recipe.  I've made it several times and it always gets rave reviews.  I used the French Pastry Pie Crust recipe along with this one.  Also, I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh and it tasted fine.

WOW! I followed the recipe with a few adjustments. I  used only 1/4 cup sugar as opposed to the 3/4 cup. I also omitted the cinnamon and increased the corn starch to 4 tablespoons as mentioned by the others. I baked the pie with the Flakiest pie crust recipe on this website (also excellent by the way) at 350F top shelf for 50 minutes and then switched it to the bottom shelf for 10 minutes at 400. I covered the edges of the crust with foil to stop it from burning and uncovered them for the last 10 minutes. DEFINATELY will make this again my hubby loved it!

This pie was quite runny coming out of the oven, but the next day it was set. It's a delicious pie... better the second day, though. : )

I followed someone's advice and  used 5T of tapioca instead of cornstarch.  This was the first time I attempted a lattice crust, and it came out beautifully.  Everyone loved the pie...I took it a school concession stand, and all the pieces sold immediately.

This is the first time i have reviewed any recipe, but i just had to sign up to review this one!
It was really easy to make, i put in less sugar and didn't add cinnamon and  along with the French Pastry Pie Crust (as suggested by some reviewers), it turned out really well. I was so proud of my first ever pastry experience!
As some users suggested, the edges did begin to brown, so i saved them with foil.

Any idea how to get it all glazed and shiny like on tv?

Thanks again Beth!

Excellent pie.  I used 5 Tbsp. of tapioca instead of cornstarch as well as less sugar and it was not at all runny as some other reviews mentioned.  This was the first time that I ever made a blueberry pie and I highly recommend it to others.

This pie was delicious but as I used frozen blueberries I would advise defrosting and draining them before mixing with thickening ingredients. But the sugar was just the right amount and everyone loved it. Will definitely make again.

First, I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site to make a traditional lattice crust pie. Second, I had a deep dish pie pan so I had to up the filling by 50%. My dish held a total of 6 cups of small blueberries. Due to others' suggestion, I used the 1 cup blueberry = 1 tbs cornstarch ratio. I must say I'm glad I listened because it came out with the PERFECT consistency. Sprinkled on saw raw sugar to give a professional look. I baked 30 minutes at 400*F on the middle lower rack, with a baking sheet underneath the dish to catch any drippings. Then when the crust started to brown, I covered it and lowered the temp to 350*F for another 35 minutes until the lattice browned nicely. I let it cool overnight on the counter (9 hrs total). The pie came out AMAZING and a scoop of vanilla ice cream really took it to the next level!!!! The butter flavor from the pie crust also really supported the blueberry flavor! I want to try adding lemon next time, but it's already so great I wonder if I should even fix what ain't broke!

Great pie.  I made it as written except I squeezed a bit of lemon into the fruit and used 3 cups of blueberries and 1 cup of blackberries because I ran out of blueberries.  I also used 4 Tblsp on cornstarch.  It was still waaayyy too runny.  Next time, I'll try 5.  I also baked according to another reviewer's advice, 400 for 15 minutes, 375 for 35.  Pie had just the right amount of sweet and tartness.

A word of caution for individuals baking blueberry pie for the first time- WATCH THE VIDEO. There's a couple of things left out in the written recipe. Most notably, the place your pie onto a baking pan and then put in the oven step. The blueberries ooze so there's a bit of clean up without the baking pan. Other than that it's actually pretty easy. Haven't tried it yet, but it's in the oven and the oozing blueberries look delicious.

Followed the recipe, but once baked the filling shrank and left too much space between it & the lattice crust which stayed in place, so I filled the spaces with a jar of lemon curd I had, just spooned it in. So it ended up as a blueberry-lemon pie, delish :)

It tastes okay. Even with extra corn starch it comes out real runny. Just stick it in the fridge for an hour and it will firm up. i used brown sugar.

Best blueberry pie I've had! I increased the corn starch to 5 tablespoons and the consistency was perfect. I also added the juice from half a lemon. Other than that the recipe was perfect. I baked the bottom crust first to keep it from getting soggy and did a lattice top crust as directed. I also used an egg wash on top, sprinkled some sugar, and covered the edges of the crust throughout most of the cooking time. I also needed to place a piece of foil over the top about halfway through since it was getting a tad too brown a little early but it turned out perfect. I will definitely make this my go to recipe for blueberry pie.

I just got back from Maine (basically the blueberry capital of the US, if not the world, and this pie beat every blueberry pie I had. I did what other people recommended - 5 TBSP of cornstarch, turn temp down, leave in oven for an hour. I also added a few TBSP of lemon juice before I added the cornstarch and sugar. magnificent pie

Perfect as written, did not add extra cornstarch. Love the fact that it wasn't too sweet, made it compliment the vanilla ice cream. Will make again, as it was so easy.

For me this was one of those recipes that I will never forget. Due to the simple ingredients and the time it took to make the recipe. This was a simple recipe where I had everything in my refrigerator, and things I had in my pantry. When the pie came out of the oven it was so beautiful! I didn't wait till long before I found myself with a slice of this pie. I do recommend this recipe all who loves pie or just wants a bite of comfort food.

This was the first attempt at a homemade pie and boy am I glad to have tried it! It was SO easy and delicious!! After reading the reviews of others I increased the sugar to one cup, increased the cornstarch to 4 TBSP, placed foil around the edges of the pie and cooked at 400 for 55 minutes on the next to the bottom rack.  Next time I will place a cookie sheet under  the pie for the last 15 min to catch any spillage. Oh, and I mis read the recipe and just dumped all the sugar into a bowl with the blueberries in the beginning and gently folded it in with a spatula then dumped into the crust.  This was a fabulous Mother's Day treat enjoyed by teens and grown ups! Not a scrap left over!! THANKS so much for the recipe!! Did I mention how easy it was??!! I will definitely make this again.

Great, great, GREAT pie! Loved it, and so did my entire family! First time I made it, and it came out great. My only two suggestions are minor: one, I had to cook mine longer (about an hour). Then again, I didn't cook it on the lower shelf of my oven (mine burns things that way) so maybe that's why. Also, I think 4 cups of blueberries was WAY too much (and too expensive!) I only used about 3 and that was quite a bit! I would suggest 2. Anyway, the taste was FANTASTIC and I can't wait to make it again and again!

Made this recipe today for my room mate and boyfriend. It is INCREDIBLE. We have already eaten half of it. I agree with the top review that the temperature should be lowered a little, but I would bake at 400 degrees for 55 minutes. I also substituted 5 tablespoons of arrowroot powder for the cornstarch. Delicious.

Not an experienced pie maker (or eater) but since we had 2 buckets of fresh blueberries decided to give it a try. I read the reviews and then made a couple of adjustments.

1) Used butter in the crust (using butter you should definitely flatten and chill at least 10-15 minutes).  I cut out a lattice crust and brushed with egg wash and sprinkled with sugar.  
2) 6 cups of blueberries to 6 Tbsp arrowroot
3) 3/4 cup white sugar plus 1/4 cup light brown sugar
4) 2 Tbsp of Key Lime Juice
...salt and cinnamon I kept about the same.  

Baking time I went with the 400 for 15 min and 350 for probably close to an hour.  I know enough about pies to realize that the pie is not done until it is bubbling in the middle so I just kept checking and setting the time for 5-7 minutes.  The best part is the crust stayed golden brown and I didn't have to cover the edges until the last 10-15 minutes.  

All in all a super recipe and we loved it!  The crust was amazing and the filling not gooey.  For those who had problems perhaps they didn't bake longer enough?  I admit, it took patience but since we picked the blueberries ourselves, I wasn't going to rush it!  

Thanks so much for both the filling and crust recipes!  

ps - to keep your oven clean, invest in a Pie Ring.

This was my first time baking a pie from scratch (including crust + lattice) and it was such a success! Followed this recipe to the tee and it turned out amazing. The crust was perfectly golden and flakey and the filling wasn't overly sweet. Will definitely be making this again. Thank you!

Hey all, I see a lot of people saying that they had to adjust up the cornstarch to 5T.  Instead of increasing the cornstarch, you can also let the pie bubble longer. That will also thicken it up. I've been making blueberry pies for years, using 4 1/2 C fresh blueberries and 3T cornstarch too. I let it bubble for about 15 minutes and never have problems with the pie not setting. A couple other points: I use a shortening-based crust, and I bake on the center rack at 370 F. I control the temperature very precisely by using a digital thermometer with a remote probe. My oven is kind of old, and doesn't have digital controls.

I used 5 cups of frozen blueberries and kept the sugar the same. It was delicious and set up very nicely (I can't stand a runny pie!). The only thing I'll do differently next time is to add a bit of lemon juice.

Dont really like blueberry pie personally since I am more of the sweet-tooth. Baked this for a friend and he was really impressed, especially need to eat with ice cream. Otherwise, it is sour. I would have added more sugar. Excellent of not too runny due to added more corn-starch. Overall, I will repeat for someones' request. Thanks!

Best pie I've ever tasted, much less made myself.  I almost followed the recipe. HA!  Definitely was a good base recipe for sure.  I increased the cornstarch to 6T, added 4 peeled & diced fresh peaches, increased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and threw in about 1 T lemon juice.  Used a refrigerated pie crust top & bottom.  Baked at 400 for 10 minutes then decreased to 375 for 50 minutes.  Put foil around the edges and removed for the last 15 minutes.  Came out perfect.  SO YUMMY!

After reading through a few reviews of this recipe, I increased the cornstarch to 4 Tbs. I also lowered the temperature to 375° as one reviewer recommended.  My results were less than satisfactory. The pie was still too runny, even after cooling completely. Maybe it needed to cook longer to compensate for the lower temerature. Also, I thought the cinnamon flavor overpowered the blueberry taste. I would cut the cinnamon amount in half if I make this recipe again.

Wonderful pie. I used 5 Tbs of corn starch and next time I'll use 4. It was totally set but I prefer a little more juice. The edges did get too brown so I will try baking it at 400. but the flavor was fantastic.

My first time ever making a pie from scratch and my husband LOVED it. Thank you for sharing the recipe. I did read earlier reviews and I also adjusted with 5 tablespoons cornstarch, lemon juice and 375* oven temp. I will make this recipe when my mother in law is in town :)

Delicious, especially with a huge scoop of ice cream. However, I did make three changes: 4 T of cornstarch, no butter, and 2/3 cup of sugar. Even so, the filling was a tad runny (might be that the crust was a little thin) and quite sweet, so next time I will try 5 T of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of sugar. Still, the entire pie disappeared in less than two days :)

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 c. and added a few pkgs of Stevia to make it lighter in calories.  I'm not sure what size pan I have, but the 4 c. blueberries did not fill up the pan.  I added 2 apples, but it could have used more fruit.

I am a novice baker. I followed the directions, but added 4 tablespoons of cornstarch as other reviewers said to add more. I waited an hour after baking to cut into it as directed by other reviewers, and it was sooooo soupy and liquidy. I should have added 5 tablespoons of cornstarch.

Absolutely amazing! I'm not a big blueberry fan, (I really made it for the kids) but I couldn't get enough! My only complain would be that it was too liquidous, so more cornstarch will be added next time.

Great easy recipe, was delicious. A little runny, but my fault, had to taste it before it cooled and ready to be eaten. We love blueberry pie, so runny or not we'll eat it. So after letting it cool for 2 hours, it thickened and was delicious . Didn't last a day, kids and husband ate it all. Thank you for posting this great recipe.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe and it came out incredibly runny and was not enjoyable.  The second time I used 6 tbls cornstarch, 1 1/4 cup sugar, baked at 385 for 55 minutes and it came out perfect!! I also brushed egg wash on the top of the pie and sprinkled with sugar.  I looked and tasted wonderful.

I followed the other reviewers and added 5-6 Tablespoons cornstarch and added 6 cups of blueberries.  The pie came out perfect, not runny at all.

Three people I know who don't like blueberry pie love this pie. It will convert the non-blueberry eaters.

I switched it up a bit and used 3 Cups fresh wild Maine blueberries and 1 (+-size) Cup (Maine) Strawberries and the pie was excellent!  Got rave reviews from family at our Annual Pie Day.

Was a little runny- will add more cornstarch next time.  My berries were also very sweet and I think that 3/4 cup of sugar was too much.  I will try less next time.  This recipe is, well, as easy as pie.

I've never eaten or made blueberry pie before, but this pie is absolutely the best pie ever! I followed the recipe except that I added 5 tbs cornstarch instead of 3. Also, I used a full pie crust on top, coated it with a beat egg, and sprinkled with raw sugar (the big chunk kind). It was PERFECT!

So I made this twice at my mums bakery, reason being that my clumsy self dropped the first pie :( the second time i was extra careful. I did tweak it a bit though. I added an extra 1/2 cup of fresh blueberries, increased the cornstarch to 5tbs and added a couple teaspoons of lemon juice. It came out AWESOME, cept it was runny, though I should have let it sit longer...I will definitely make again. P.S IT TASTES FANTASTIC!

this was my very first blueberry pie!  i used fresh blueberries and it was amazing! i only gave 4 stars because the recipe needs to be modified a bit...i used the 4 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of the 3, but it was still a little runny...would probably use 5 if i did this again...i baked on 375 instead of 425 and the crust was perfectly golden...i used almost a cup of sugar...i was a little low on the blueberries...i only had about 3 cups instead of 4, which could have been the reasoning it was a bit runny.  it was VERY sweet. if i did this again i would probably only use the 3/4 cup of sugar instead of the one cup i used.  great recipe though...my husband loved it!

Great taste, but as runny as blueberry sauce. I have yet to find a blueberry pie recipe that is really as simple as stated. In this case, I took the advice of many of the reviews and added 4T of cornstarch and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Baked at 400 for 50 minutes. The crust was a tad overdone, but the filling never set, even after cooling for 2 hours.

I am using frozen blueberries that I picked last year. These are Alaskan blueberries, which are small and very sweet. I don't know if that has anything to do with it. If anyone who has made this recipe has any advice, please let me know.

It does taste wonderful though!

My husband says hands down this is the best dessert I've ever made. While I'd make some modifications for future, he says to keep exactly as is. :) 

I used frozen pie crust for my crust to save time. It was still delicious! I added some vanilla extract and nutmeg as some suggested, but really will add less next time...it had a tad too much of each. I would add slightly less sugar, for me it was too sweet and even a little gritty. And though I upped my corn starch to 4 tbsp, it still was not enough and was very liquid-y even the next day after sitting overnight. Next time I'll try 5 tbsp.

I did wrap the edges in foil to prevent burning as some suggested, and took it off for the last ten minutes. Perfection!

I used a closed top crust and about 1 cup Splenda-Sugar blend. After reading the reviews, I upped the corn starch to 5 Tbsp and it was still a little runny. Next time I'll use a little less sugar and another Tbsp of cornstarch......it was sweet & delicious!

This was great!  First time making it and wow!  I'll probably end up making more while I still have the blueberries.  I used 'Basic Flaky Pie Crust' from Stephanie for the crust as per previous reviews mentioned.  Def. will keep this one.

Good pie. I made as directed and was pleased with the result for the most part. The pie was great about and hour after baking but the next day the filling had turned into almost a jelly. For me personally I didn't like the texture of it the second day but my boyfriend couldn't stop eating it! Thanks for sharing.

I read the reviews and I didn't want to take a chance and have a runny sauce so I decided to bake the incredients before adding them to the pie. It worked perfectly. I took the previous suggestions and used 5 cups of blueberries, 4 tea cornstarch and added cherry sugar free geletin to the mix. Perfect pie!!!!

This was a seriously simple pie, and oh-so-yummo.  I used frozen berries picked from the fields last summer and we couldn't tell the difference.  After reading the reviews, I did opt for 5 Tbsp cornstarch and a splash of lemon juice.  Our berries were so sweet to begin with, easily could have cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  I cheated and used Marie Callendar frozen pie crust.

My first blueberry pie, and it came out great!  I used frozen whole blueberries, from a batch I had picked over the summer.  Per other reviews, I used a little extra cornstarch to keep it from being runny, and that worked great.  My family really enjoyed it over Thanksgiving!

Tasted great and looked beautiful.  I added 5 tbsp cornstarch, 1 tbsp lemon juice and 1 tsp lemon zest since I love the lemon/blueberry combination.  I made a lattice crust that looked really nice on top.

This pie had delicious flavor, just wouldn't try again with Alaskan blueberries.  They were too seedy and much too watery.  I even added 6tbs of cornstartch and it still looked like pie soup-and we waited 4 hours after making it to cut into it.

This was a super good recipe, one I will be doing again.  I gave it four out of five because after reading other reviews, I did modify it a bit.  I put five cups of blueberries in instead of four, added five tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 4 and 1 1/4 cups of sugar, and a splash of lemon juice for freshness.  I also brushed the top with an egg white wash and sprinkled with sugar.  It was delicious! Definitely the recipe I'll be using for now on.  I might add another tablespoon of cornstarch though.  Its really hard to find the right amount of starch so its not so runny but not goopy either!

OMG!!! This was the most delicious pie we have ever eaten! Was looking for a way to use up 5cups of fresh blueberries, and boy are we glad to have stumbled upon this recipe. The key was to use the full 5 cups, as well as 5 Tbsp cornstarch. Baked @ 375, as well. Will definitely be making all summer long! Worth the extra hours each week in boot camp, let me tell ya!

This was the first pie I have ever made. It was really easy and quite good. Even my parents, who owned a catering business and have made 4+ wedding cakes raved about this. I followed the directions exactly, and the only thing I will change next time is to add another cup of blueberries, since my pie fell once it cooled. With that change this would be a 5 star recipe. Also, I shared this recipe with a friend whose husband is diabetic and she substituted Splenda and no one could tell.

It was a decent pie, but not outstanding.  One tip: instant tapioca is a better thickener for berry pie than cornstarch.  Instead of adding more cornstarch, add a tablespoon or two of instant tapioca.

This was very good.  I got lots of compliments.  I used 2 pts fresh blueberries (which meaured out 4 cups).  I did use 4 Tbs cornstarch.  Next time I think I will use 5 Tbs.  My pie was very runny.  It was tart, for a sweeter pie use 1 cup sugar.  I used a pisbury roll out crust.  YUM!

Easy and delicious.  Increased cornstarch to 5 tbsp, berries to 5 cups and added a squirt of lemon juice on top of the berries.  Washed with an egg white before cooking and it turned a beautiful golden color.  This is in my archive and will be a summer favorite!

Excellent.  I went with 5T cornstarch and put foil around the edges until the last 15 minutes as suggested by other reviewers.  Best pie I've ever had.  (And the first one I've ever baked!)  Easy and delicious.

The pie was super easy to make. It turned out great, my friends and family loved it. I forgot to add butter, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly as stated and didnt change anything. One thing I would mention is that you need to let this pie cool for at least two hours before serving or the juice will be very runny. The longer the pie cools, the easier it is to slice without being a gooey mess. Love this pie and will definatley be making alot more pie this summer.

I made my first ever blue berry pie today using this recipe. Actually, I made 2 of them. They turned out delicious! The only thing I did differently (after reading several reviews) is I added 4 1/2 TBS of cornstarch instead of 3. Some people added 5 and some added 4 so I went with 4 and 1/2. It turned out great! I got so many compliments! Oh and I made the pie crust from scratch using the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" recipe submitted by Stephanie (that too, was something I read on someone's review of this pie recipe). I have to say, those 2 recipes are truly a match made in heaven!

Great pie!  Per some of the other reviews, I upped the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons, but I wished I gone to 5 as the pie was still a bit wet after sitting for 3 hours.  That was probably my fault; after checking on the pie 20 mins in I had to cover the edges with foil and I turned the heat down to 400 to keep them from burning.  I also added a tablespoon of lemon juice.    I'll definitely try this pie again.

I was not very pleased with the final turnout of this pie. Even after adding an addition 3 Tablespoons of cornstarch it was still very runny and bubbled over. Boy, was that fun to clean up!  The 425 recommendation for baking I felt was way too high so I baked mine on 375 for 55 minutes. The edges were getting too brown otherwise I would have let bake an additional 10 minutes as the middle was still a bit soggy. Overall, it wasn't horrible, as we still ate it. I will play around with it or find another recipe. Thanks for the post though!

Oh my, this is one delicious pie! I did increase the blueberries to nearly 6 cups, increased the cornstarch and added a couple teaspoons of lemon juice. My daughter, who does not like blueberries and doesn't like pie,(except pumpkin!) tried it and proclaimed it "the best dessert ever"!

Blueberry SOUP!  Added double the corn starch and it still didn't set!  I cooked biscuits and poured over the "blueberry soup" with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream, and it was fairly tasty though definitely not worth the effort.

I have never made or had a blueberry pie before, this was the easiest recipe ever. I used the never fail pie crust with it. The only thing is that with the fresh big blueberries we had it did need a little more cornstarch, other than that it was great!

I'm giving this four because I didn't follow the recipe exactly :)  But, with the user-suggested changes, it was a 5 star pie!  I used about 4 and a half tbsp cornstarch, 2 tbsp lemon juice, left out the cinnamon, and used thawed (and drained) frozen wild blueberries.  I also used a pre-made pie crust to save time!  I just cut hearts out of the 2nd pie crust and made sort of a lattice top with the hearts, and then made some cinnamon/sugar coated pie crust stars with the leftover dough.   Delicious!  My husband says it's the best blueberry pie ever!  And he's very picky about pies :)  I love that it is nice and tart and flavorful, not like the sort of flat-sweet-tasting pies you sometimes get at the store.   Awesome, give it a try! -ara133photography

a little soupy but otherwise delicious.  I let it set for one hour before serving next time I make I will let it set two hours and I think it will be just right.  I did add 5 tbsp. of cornstarch like others had suggested and lowered the temp to 375 for 50 min.

I made a few changes based on other reviewers suggestions...however, the blueberry filling didn't turn out very nice. I would suggest cooking the blueberries on a pot over the stove first with a little water and sugar (for 4 cups of blueberries: add 1 cup of water and 1 cup sugar, bring to a boil, then add the blueberries.) I will try this next time.

Delicious! My first time making a blueberry pie and the peeps around me who ate it had nothing but 'mmm's to say. Did follow others recommendations: lemon juice, more corn starch (5.5 tbsp), oven temp at 375 for an hour, let it sit for 2.5 hrs before cutting it and yes, pie is quite 'soupy' - though less soupy the following day. Also was all GONE the following day :(  Great recipe! thx much.

I love any recipe that tastes great even after I've forgotten an ingredient (butter on top)! Delicious with our fresh picked blueberries.

This is a really good, easy recipe for blueberry pie.  I had to use half blueberries and half strawberries, but it worked just fine.  I couldn't actually taste the strawberries, but the texture was perfect.  I will use this recipe again.

Just so-so.  My family thought this was way too sour and didn't like the cinnamon in it.  I'll go back to my other blueberry pie recipe.

Made this for a July 4th bbq and it was a hit.  I used 5 tbsp of cornstarch as recommended by others and fresh blueberries.  I did a lattice top and everyone was impressed with how professional it looked.  EASY recipe which turned out VERY yummy! I highly recommend this recipe.

I did not use this crust recipe,I just made the filling with my own homemade crust.It is excellent!I used 5 tbsp of cornstarch and it was the perfect amount.The blueberry filling is firm and not runny at all.I forgot to dot the berries with the butter and it still turned out great.

This is the best blueberry pie recipe ever! My husband agrees.  It's very simple to put together, which I really like.  I used fresh blueberries and cooked it in a 375 degree oven. Of course, I covered the edges with foil for the first half of baking.

I was pretty disappointed with the outcome of this pie after all the great reviews. Even with extra cornstarch (5T) and extra sugar (1c) recommended by other reviewers, the pie turned out like soup and not very sweet. I even battled my temptations and waited overnight to cut it. I had also lowered the heat to 400 as many before me recommended and wrapped the edges in foil, but the crust was still done very early. The leftovers are still tasty for me at home, but a total mess to serve to guests... I think next time I'll try one of the recipes that uses gelatin instead of cornstarch.. or just make blueberry shortcake..

I love making pies, but this is my first attempt at blueberry.  I used fresh blueberries and did not adjust the ingredients listed - I did, however, add to them.  I bumped the cinnamon up a bit, added some fresh grated nutmeg and added about a tablespoon of lemon juice.  I topped the pie with an egg wash and a little sanding sugar.  I did protect the crust with aluminum foil which I removed for the last 10 minutes.  Baked 45 minutes total and it was beautiful and set perfectly.  *I made this again with fructose instead of regular sugar as my parents are borderline diabetic.  They said it was the best blueberry pie they have ever eaten!  This is definitely a keeper!

This is just like a recipe that I make all the time. I use 1/4 cup flour, leave out the cinnamon and add a couple of good squeezes of lemon. Mix the flour, sugar lemon and salt right into the blueberries. Bake the pie at 425 degrees for about 20 minutes and then another 30 minutes at 350 degrees. The filling won't be solid until it's cool. It's a delicious pie!

This was a great recipe, I used 3 Tbsp of corn starch and I thought it was enough. The only change that I would make would be to sprinkle some sugar on the berries before I baked it. It only took 30 mins to bake, but I used fresh berries so that may have altered the time.

Very good pie!!! I love making pies at home and this was so easy and well worth any effort. I used a butter flaky pie crust from this website for the bottom and as a lattice. 
The only changes I would make, as other reviewers have suggested, increase the cornstarch to 5 Tablespoons and add at least 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice. I lowered the oven temperature to 400 degrees and cooked it for the full time. Make sure to place a sheet pan beneath the pie dish because it may bubble over

I personally thought this should be a little sweeter, but everyone else raved about it.  Blueberries are a bit expensive, so I substituted half raspberries.  Makes a beautiful pie, not runny at all.  Thanks for sharing!

The 5 Tbsp of corn starch is definitely the way to go. I used 6 cups of blueberries as it looked too flat to me. Will add even more next time. Ruth's Grandma's pie crust was the perfect crust for this.

Very tasty. I made this with very juicy high-bush berries and a full top crust, so I increased the cornstarch to 4 tbsp and cooked it for an hour. My photo shows the pie after cooling at room temperature for 4 hours: holding together nicely, but still juicy! My berries were on the tart side, but 3/4 cup sugar made the pie sweet.

This was my first attempt at Blueberry Pie, and it came out great!  After reading the reviews I made a few adjustments.  I used 3T cornstarch/3T tapioca and the consistency was perfect. A friend told me that his Mom always used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar when she made blueberry pie. I used 1 cup total of the sugar mixture.  I will definately make this again~

I used this recipe today to make my very first blueberry pie.  It came out great.  I did lower the oven temp to 375 and I just cooked it until it was done...it still took about 50 minutes total.  I used the amount of cornstarch that was in the recipe and though it was slightly juicy...we loved it!  I used the "pastry for double pie crust" recipe and the crust came out great too.  My 4 year old was helping me and it was really easy for him to help and he enjoyed himself so I would also recommend this recipe for cooking with children.

Lots and lots of corn starch/arrowroot for thickening.  I must have used a half cup corn starch, but it did the trick!  My pie was not runny.

I made this pie with Splenda and premade pie crust from Trader Joe's. I used 5 Cups of blueberries and 1 extra tablespoon of cornstarch. My husband liked the thicker consistency, though there wasn't much juice in it.

Ok, this was my very first fruit pie, and I enjoyed it very much.  My husband and dad LOVED it.  The only thing - if I may, is I dont know how much I liked the consistency of the filling.  After reading the reviews, I decided to use 4 TBSP of cornstarch, and dont get me wrong, it was very good, but kinda Jello-ish near the crust area.  I will definitely make this again, maybe using 3 1/2 TBSP of the cornstarch.

I loved it!  I also had a runniness issue.  I listened to all of the reviews and added the extra thickener.  My thought is that I did not cook it long enough.  I think maybe I need to cook it until the crust is wonderfully brown, then cover it until it is bubblier than it was.  Great flavor!

I made this for my boyfriend who loves blueberry pie and he LOVED it!  He couldn't wait for it to cool, so it sort of fell apart, but it was still absolutely delicious!  I would just suggest that the mixture be heated slightly before adding to the shell to ensure that all of the sugar mixture is blended effectively.  Great pie!

Anxious to avoid runniness at all costs, I added lots of extra cornstarch.  Well, to say the pie wasn't runny would be an understatement.  In fact, the cornstarch didn't even fully dissolve and I could detect the taste quite clearly afterwards.  Next time I think I will use the stated amount or only very slightly more (maybe 1 tbsp per cup of fruit?) and follow the advice given by other reviewers to let the pie sit for a couple of hours before serving.

Excellent and easy pie.  I used 3 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch and it was perfect.  I also brushed the crust with milk and sprinkled with sugar before baking.  Also, turned down the oven to 350 for last 20 minutes of baking. Served with vanilla ice cream

A very delicious pie! I followed a bunch of other reviews and used 5 TB. cornstarch, it wasn't runny at all, you just have to let it set for a good few hours before eating. I also added a bit of vanilla (just for the hey of it), and changed the baking times. I did 25 min. at 400, and about 45 min. at 350, covering the edges with foil the first half of baking. It wasn't too sour at all, in fact, my berries must have been sweet because I would have liked it a bit more sour!

Loved it! Used ready made pie crust- was in a rush...used fresh frozen blueberries- since blueberries fresh cost a fortune right now...did 2 TBS Flour, and 2 TBS Corn Starch...was still a little runny- but delicious. I brought it to work and people asked for the recipe and commented that when it runs a little you know it is home made and not store bought..I also added some orange and lemmon peel to the flour sugar mixture and I used 1/2 a cup of sugar...it was perfect- THANKS!!

Super EZ for a quick yummy dessert. Used frozen blueberries, ready made pie crust and added a squeeze of lemon juice. First time I made it I used 4 T. cornstarch and 3/4 c. sugar... way too much cornstarch taste and too sweet. Second time I used 3 T. flour and 1/2 c. sugar. Very good. I would much rather have a better tasting pie that wasn't as thick as a brick, so do not use 5 T. of cornstarch as some reviewers have suggested. Also both times I reduced the oven temp and cooked a bit longer. Use a foil ring if crust starts to get dark. Be sure to let cool at least an hour but  it is best served warm with vanilla ice cream.

I really enjoyed this pie. This is the first pie I have ever made from scratch. I took the advise of others reviews and added 4 tbls of cornstarch and the pie was still runny when I cut into it. I recomend letting the pie set for several hours before serving. I did not do the lattice top instead I used the "best ever pie crust" recipe also on this site and I made a double crust pie. I cut out leaves and blueberry shapes with the extra dough brused them with milk and arranged them on top of the pie. I set my oven to 375 covered the edges with foil for the first 25 minutes and then uncovered and baked for about 25-30 minutes more. The pie came out perfect.

Tase was very good, but it was runny ( I had increased cornstarch by 1tbl..  Mine never thickened.  I will make again, but add more cornstarch.  I will read more reveiws to see more advice on thickening.
I made this pie again, and did not cut till late the next day, and it was not runny- maybe it really needs to set up.

This is your classic blueberry pie.  It was simple to make and very tasty with the cinnamon.  The filling will not be runny as long as you let it cool for at least an hour.  Pies get runny if you cut into them too soon.

Great pie!  Since I added an extra cup of Oregon blueberries, I increased the cornstarch by one more tablespoon; added another 1/4 cup of sugar; and tossed the blueberries in two tablespoons of melted butter and a squeeze of fresh lemon, before adding the dry mixture. Turned out wonderful. I've made this five times now.

My kids helped me make this so the measurements might have been a little off!  This was the first time I made a lattice top pie and it was much easier than I thought.  I thought this was on the tart side, but my husband LOVED it, would have been just perfect with a scoop of ice cream.  I baked it only for 40 minutes and it was starting to get really brown.  I made a cookie cutter star and placed it in the middle for a 4th of July pie and it looked elegant.

The taste was awesome. However, I used 5 T. cornstarch with frozen blueberries as suggested in other reviews and it still turned out soupy. I will definitely try again, next time thawing out the blueberries first and mixing in the cornstarch mixture better. Hopefully I can find the right formula because I love this pie!

For a regular pie I used 1 16oz bag of frozen blueberries and 5 tbsp of cornstarch.  For a deep dish pie I doubled the bags and the cornstarch.  Out standingly wonderful!  My family couldn't wait to dig into this pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  Even Mr. 'I don't like blueberries' loved it and was upset I took the rest to work.  YUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I have always found that I put too much sugar when I make blueberry pie.  With this recipe, my worries are gone.  The pies still tasted like blueberries and not blueberry jam and the juice from the blueberries was just the right consistancy.  I did however, substitute flour for cornstarch as I had no cornstarch in the house.  I also added a little bit of Nutmeg in the recipe.  One of my friends used to add this spice and I find it gives just that added tast.  Don't use too much though, I would say not more than a quarter or half a teaspoon.

Great blueberry pie and simple to make.  I also read the reviews and opted to go with the tapioca rather than the cornstarch and had excellent results.  Would reccomend highly to experienced or novice bakers.

My one year daughter doesn't care much for fruit, but she sure tore into this pie that was bustin' with blueberries.  It was the first time I'd ever made a blueberry pie, but definately not the last.

I've always had difficulty making a good blueberry pie -- it usually turned out too runny and too tart.  This amazingly easy recipe results in a consistently delicious pie.  My father grows his own blueberries and now I can make a great pie using his berries.  The only thing I omitted was the cinnamon -- I personally don't care for it in blueberry pie.

We live 40 minutes from Hammonton,NJ - World's Blueberry Capital. The beautiful berries we picked ourselves went into real good use with this pie recipe. We used extra conrstarch as well, as some of the reviews indicated.

It was a fantastic pie! I did change the recipe slightly however. I followed the advice of others and used 5 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 3, and I added a couple tablespoons of lemon juice. It was the perfect amount of sweet and tart! One thing that I would change however would be the baking time and/or temperature. I baked at 375F for 50 minutes and the blueberry filling was great but the crust was a little underdone. That being said, it could've just been the pie crust I was using. 5 star pie recipe, I am definitely making this one again!

This was the first time I’ve ever made a blueberry pie! My son requested one this weekend for his 21st birthday.  I have to say that it was fantastic! Not one single piece left and there were pickers picking from the small scraps left in the pan. Including me!  It was even said that it was better than the one we tried at thanksgiving that has won many awards. It was bought from a very popular bakery. So, having said that, I highly recommend it! It was super easy!!! I made a few changes- I used 4 tbsp of cornstarch, added 2 tbsp lemon juice, 4 1/2 cups fresh blueberries and 3/4 cups sugar. After mixing the dry ingredients, add your blueberries then the lemon. At least that’s how I did it. I also melted butter and brushed the top pastry then sprinkled it with sugar. Enjoy! Sooo good!

I’ve  made this recipe a few times.  Love it each and every time I make it. The only time I changed it was unintentionally, I put an extra 2 cups of blueberries in. Was great everyone who ate it said it was the best one yet.

Made as directed but added two more tablespoons of cornstarch. It came out perfectly! I let it sit for about two hours before I had to have a slice. It was still warm, but had gelled up nicely by then. I recommend this recipe, but I really think it needs more cornstarch to avoid a runny pie.

The only thing I changed was the baking temp and time. 425 for 20 minutes then reduce to 375 for 35-40 minutes. Came out perfectly.

Overall good pie :) I followed some recommendations from the reviews and think it added to the flavor. Used 5 tbsp of cornstarch and added 1/4 lemon juice to the berries, also baked at a temperature of 380 and the crust turned out just right.

This was amazing! I used the ingredients per the recipe EXCEPT added 1 additional tbsp of cornstarch (4 total), and lowered the temp to 400 and covered the edges of the crust after 15 mins. The crust ended up perfectly browned, the filling set nicely (and didn't bubble over, though I did put a cookie sheet underneath just in case....), and the simple flavor of the blueberries was incredible. I paired it with some homemade whipped cream and had to stop myself from eating the whole pie!

Made it as written, and although it was good, it wasn't great.  I just really don't love cinnamon with blueberries so I would definitely skip that.   Also, I like a little more blueberry gel with it.   Next time I would probably cook the berries, sugar and cornstarch on the stove top a bit and add to a cooked pie shell to achieve that.

This was the best blueberry pie I've ever had! I used frozen blueberries because that's all I had, but I thawed them in the microwave and used the juices from them too. Because there was so much juice, I used 5T cornstarch (plus a squeeze of lemon juice).  I baked this in a 9.5" pie plate using Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust, with a lattice-cut top. I covered the edges of my pie with foil, then baked it on a pre-heated cookie sheet at 425degrees for 35min, then took off the foil and baked for another 15 min. After cooling for an hour, the pie was still warm, but could be sliced perfectly! Amazing!

Ok, great recipe! But DO NOT BAKE AT 425 FOR 50 MINUTES!!! Mine started getting a little too crispy around the 22 minute mark. 

Also threw in a couple tablespoons of lemon juice. Made the flavor pop nicely.

I have now made this pie several times, and I follow the recipe exactly, except adding about 1 cup more of blueberries if my pie looks empty. Lately I feel like its been a little on the sweet side with the 3/4 cup sugar, but it probably just depends on the tartness of the blueberries.

Deliciousness Warning:
This recipe may cause you to make multiple pies and share them with friends and family. 

Love this recipe! We went blueberry picking and ended up with so many blueberries I made 3 pies and several other goodies. This recipe is at the top of my list of pies!!!

This was amazing pie!  I followed the slightly changed directions and used five cups of blueberries and increased the cornstarch for 5 Tablespoons.  I decreased the cooking temperature as well and did use the pie crust shield.  Perfection!  This was my first lattice-topped pie and thank goodness for the internet and finding a video to teach me.  This was a request from my husband for a fruit pie for Thanksgiving.  This will be made again, and again, and again.

I didn't read the other reviews and therefore had a runny pie. (Mind you I used frozen blueberries which could have been my problem as well) More cornstarch is needed for sure. I also added some lemon zest.

I've made this recipe 5 times since early summer, always deep-dish pie, closed top no lattice, so I add 50% more ingredients, that is 6 cups blueberries, 4&1/2 TB cornstarch, etc.  I love the cinnamon instead of lemon flavoring.  I also follow my old Joy of Cooking baking instructions, which is 10 minutes on 450, then lower to 350 for 40 to 50 minutes or until it has bubbled over for about 5 minutes (to make sure the cornstarch is thoroughly cooked). To the cooks who read the reviews regarding the amounts of cornstarch needed, if your blueberries are fat and watery use a little more cornstarch; if small and chewy use less. After several times making this you'll get it consistently right.  It's always a crowd pleaser.

Made this pie today. I used 5 cups of blueberries instead of 4 and 5 table spoons of cornstarch and a table spoon of lemon juice. I have my own crust recipe. It was a huge hit! I would have rated it a 5 if it did not need the changes.

Very tasty! I made a few changes as other reviewers suggested. I added 6 tbsp of cornstarch, 2 tbsp of lemon juice and baked at 375 on middle rack.

This recipe was really good. I bought prepared puff pastry sheets for the pastry (due to limited time, and not having pie crust pastry available at Safeway), which unfortunately meant that the base wasn't as thick as one might like, but next time when I have more time, I'll try to make my own pie crust pastry using one of the recipes on this website. 

The filling is the most important part of this recipe though, and it is definitely a winner there! I added the juice from half a lemon and increased the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons. All other quantities remained the same. For a first timer, the latticing and crimping of the pie top was not too difficult.

I also borrowed some tips from other reviewers for baking: wrapped aluminium foil around the crust edges to prevent burning and started baking at 400 F on the middle shelf for the first 15 minutes. Reduced to 375 F for the last 35 minutes, removing the foil in the last 10 minutes of baking to make the crusts more golden. Unfortunately even after cooling and refrigerating, the pie was hard to cut and it looked pretty messy. That could possibly be because I used puff pastry instead. Will have to amend this review when I try it again!

OK, I have never rated a recipe before, but just had to on this one.  It was sooooo good!!!  Even my kids who aren't big "fruit pies fans" even with ice cream on top, LOVED this pie.  I did make some alterations after reading the comments.  I did 5 tbsp. of cornstarch and kept all the other ingredients the same.  I did set the oven at 375, and cooked it the recommended 50min, and then checked.  In all, it turned into 1hr 10min cooking time, and was perfect!  Also, I did an egg wash on the crust to get it golden brown.  But we will be making this one again!!  It's a keeper!  :-)

My first "4" star review...  out of necessity I made some changes.  My berries were fresh, beautiful, quite large and a tad on the tart side so I used 1 cup of sugar.  After reading other's reviews I used 4 tablespoons cornstarch and I have to tell you, it never set and was like water in the center of the pie.  I don't know about other folks ovens but if I had set mine on 425 and a lower shelf the pie would have been burned to a crisp.  I baked it at 375 on next to the lowest shelf and increased the bake time to one hour and 20 minutes.  Also covered the edges and they were nicely browned. Thankfully, something told me not to put a crust on top which allowed me to spoon the filling into a small saucepan where I used another 1 1/2 tablespoons of cornstarch dissolved in some water and another 1/2 cup water in order to cook the cornstarch taste out of the filling.  It worked.  The filling thickened just like I had hoped and I put it back into the pie shell from whence it came!  Perfect.  I don't think it was this recipe's fault at all.  In my own analytical fashion I believe that the berries being very large added to the liquid content and the first addition of cornstarch simply was not enough.  The pie is absolutely delicious and there's no doubt that I will do it again, happily do it again.  The taste of this pie is deserving of 5 stars!

Quick and easy. Tastes good. I never put as much sugar as recipes call for. It's just not necessary. I've used frozen blueberries also and it turns out great.

I had to use frozen blueberries and upped the corn starch to 4 Tbsp, but the taste was wonderful. I can't wait to try it again with fresh blueberries this summer!

Oh my goodness, this pie was AMAZING! I made it with a different crust recipe that I found and my family LOVED it. After it came out of the oven I brushed the crust with melted butter and sprinkled cinnamon-sugar over it! It was gone in a few minutes...gone did that happen?

My changes: 5 tbsp. Of corn starch. Little over 1/2 cup sugar. 1 tbsp. Lemon juice. Bake lower level for 30 min. On 425. Cover crust. Middle rack at 375 for 30 min. Then 425 for 15 min.let cool completely.6 cups of blueberries were needed when using a glass pie pan. 
Also great as a mixed berry pie.

5 stars because it is the right ratios for making a good fruit pie. I used frozen blueberries. The filling was a nice consistency - not to stiff but it wasn't runny that when you served it the filling flowed out. Good recipe.

This recipe asks for too high of a baking temp. My beautiful pastry which normally comes out flaky was very tough and overbaked by this method.  The filling had nice flavour but was very runny.

I have a freezer full of frozen blueberries, so I made a thick syrup of the sugar (plus an extra 1/2 cup added to 1 cup water)and cornstarch and cooked down on med heat until reduced by 1/2.Then turned off the heat and 
gently stirred the frozen berries
into the syrup and let sit while 
I fixed the crust.I love the original recipe and it gave me great guidelines and an awesome homemade pie! Thanks!

I already have a great butter recipe for pie dough, and just needed a recipe for the filling using the fresh blueberries we just picked.  Turned out perfectly!  Everyone wanted 2nds and 3rds.  Good thing we picked 6 buckets worth of blueberries!

I made this pie just as written. Very tasty! If I make it again I might cut down or leave out the cinnamon. The only change I made was cutting back on the heat after the crust started to brown. It did not come out runny at all.

Everyone raved about this pie. I used late season berries which were small. If they were plumper, I'd probably add more cornstarch. I highly recommend Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust.

This was the best blueberry pie I've ever had. I followed the recipe exactly. I think that the lattice top helps more moisture escape.other reviewers complained about it being runny. I think they probably used a whole top crust.I had no issues with the juices running out onto the bottom of the oven also because the lattice crust allowed more moisture to escape. Delicious!

Wow! This was great and very easy to make. I had a ready made, unroll crust in the fridge, so used that.  I also dripped about 10 drops of lemon juice across the fruit before adding the butter and lattice crust. I added extra cornstarch as others suggested, although I used 5 tablespoons of cornstarch. This worked well, making a thick gel that wasn't runny.  I baked it on the rack one below the middle, on the pie ring and used the crust shield to protect the edge from burning. It baked with the dial at 400 (thermometer at 375) for 45 min, then I upped the dial to 425 for another 15 minutes, until the crust was browned and the filling started to bubble. Next time I'd try dial at 425 and check thru windo for bubbling (sound) and color at 40 minutes, then adjust for final baking. Delicious with vanilla ice cream!

This recipe is a really good start to a great pie.  Put the berries in a large bowl and sprinkle with orange juice, add 1/ 1/4 cups sugar, 5 tablespoons cornstarch and the salt and cinnamon.  With a large spoon, carefully fold the berries until coated and then put them in the pie crust. My guests raved!

This was amazing!!!  I followed the recipe as it was written and it came out AMAZING.  Some of the comments complained about it being watery and needing to add more cornstarch.  I did not have this problem.  I baked for exactly 50 minutes, I did wrap the outer crust in foil after 20 minutes to avoid burning.  After removing from oven I let it sit out for about 4 hours.  This may have helped it set.  All of my guest devoured a piece and said it was one of the best blueberry pies they had ever had.  I was sad we did not have left overs!

Made this pie yesterday. It was the first time I've ever made a homemade blueberry pie. Recipe is perfect! All I did was do 4 heaping tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 3 level TBSP.  Was not runny at ALL!!!

LOVES the flavors but even after following other peoples advise with 1C sugar and 5T cornstarch, my pie was SO RUNNY that it didn't hold up.  Again, flavors were amazing though.  I would make again with more flour and cornstarch though.

Added 1/2 tbsp more sugar and little extra cinnamon. You will need to up the cornstarch by half, the recipe calls for too little. Overall very tasty and quick to prepare.

I followed the recipe except I used 4 tablespoons of corn starch and baked the pie at 400F for about 45 minutes. I used fresh blueberries for the pie filling. For the crust, I doubled the amount for the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" recipe which appears in allrecipes.com. The pie came out great and I will definitely make this again.

This looked so good and we have a lot of blueberries so I decided to make a pie for my husband this afternoon.  I will only give 4 stars, because the pie was like soup...it never set!  The flavor was excellent, but even after increasing the cornstarch to 5 tbsp., it did not thicken.

It was absolutely delicious!!!!!! I made it for my family and they absolutely loved it! I even had leftover dough( I made mine from scratch) and just threw in some apples, cinnamon, sugar and lots of butter and had a small apple pie too! I did 5 Tablespoons of cornstarch instead of just three.

The best part of blueberry pie is its tartness and natural sweetness. This pie was far too sugary. It tasted like syrup. This was disappointing. If making again, I would use the same amount of sugar but with about 6 cups of blueberries instead. Probably 4-5 tb of corn starch. I use a deep dish and it would've fit better.

I make blueberry pie for my father in law and have tried fresh and frozen berries with this recipe. I can tell a difference in berry texture but it was still good with frozen and much less expensive since they were not in season. From my research, the key to using frozen is to run them under water and defrost but then make sure you dry them really well before putting in pie crust.

I added 2 extra tablespoons of cornstarch and it still came out runny. Also, the flavor was nothing special. Don't bother trying to modify this one, just use a different recipe.

This pie is amazing!  I made it for Christmas today and no one wanted any other desserts!  My husband wants me to make another one for tomorrow for just him. I used 5 tablespoons of cornstarch like other reviewers said to do and I used frozen blueberries. I served the pie chilled. Awesome pie!

I used the frozen blue berry, strawberry frozen kind from our friendly frozen section of the market, also the frozen pie crust to cover the pie shell with slits on top.
Although I used butter on top the pie crust sheel cover it broke in some places.
Well this is a learning experience, I must learn how to do a egg wash.
Merry Christmas and a safe New Year 2014 Feliz Navidad y un prospero ano Nuevo 2014.

Excellent recipe. Very simple, no fail. Use 3/4 cup of sugar - no more, no less - for a balanced flavour that isn't too sweet. I've made this recipe 6-7 times now.  It's a favourite.

Made this pie for a family get together and my husband cut into it before we even left it was so good looking!  To my delight it tasted even better than it looked - delicious!  Though I did follow other's directions and increased cornstarch to 4T and added about 3/4 cup of canned blueberry pie filling to tighten it all up during cooking.  Mixed in the juice of one small lemon to filling.  Also, used about 2-3T of butter cut into small pieces on top of filling before adding lattice top.  To make a delicious golden brown crust, whisk 1 egg and 1T of water together and brush over crust, sprinkling with sugar before baking.  An aluminium foil cover over edges of crust to prevent burning is necessary.  I cooked this pie for 10 minutes at 425, then decreased temp to 370 for 30-45 minutes, removing foil crust cover for last 15 mins.  PERFECT, will be making this again during blueberry season.

Read lots of the reviews before proceeding.  I intended to follow it as written, but since I have a deep dish pie plate, I had to use almost 6 cups of (freshly picked) berries.  So, I added 5 Tbsp of corn starch, a full cup of sugar and the called for amount of cinnamon and salt.  I also added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, personal preference.  Result:  it is delicious and perfectly flavored but pretty runny.  It seems obvious (in hindsight, of course) that I should have used a lot more cornstarch, especially if others need 5T for 4C berries.  I will definitely make it again and adjust, since my family likes it enough to eat it in bowls with spoons. :)

I made this as a last minute surprise for my husband, and it was a HIT! I had never made a berry pie before, only pecan pie, so I was really surprised by how simple and easy it was! I used fresh blueberries and a pre-made crust because I was limited on time (probably would be better with a homemade crust), and followed the recipe to a T and it turned out fabulous. The only thing I would say is to wait for it to cool quite a bit before cutting into it, or it's pretty runny. I cut it while it was very warm, and it ran, but the next day it was perfect. I give this 5 stars and will definitely be making this again!

I also had issues with this being a runny disaster.  It's still 4 stars because it tastes AWESOME, but we had to eat it more like a cobbler.  I used fresh blueberries and 5 TBSP of cornstarch.  Not sure what else could be done...it tastes wonderful though.

I used 5 cups of blueberries, 3/4 cups of brown sugar, 5 tbsp of cornstarch, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I used the hot water pie crust recipe from this site (decided to make the pie in the last minute). There is enough butter in the crust, so I skipped the butter on top f the fruit. I baked it for 15 minutes at 425, then for 35 minutes at 350. I left the pie in the oven to cool and refrigerated it overnight. Blueberries set so perfectly, there was absolutely no run off of any juice. I hope this helps.

Just made this pie with fresh blueberries.  Delicious!  Wouldn't change a thing, except cooking time.  I took mine out before the stated 50 minutes, so the crust wouldn't burn.

This was great as-is, but the next time I used this recipe I made the following change: divide your blueberries in half. Cook half of them on the stove-top with the rest of the filling ingredients until it congeals (you won't need to add any cornstarch). Let that cool to room temp, and in the meantime bake your pie crust with pie weights or dried beans. Once the filling is cooled, stir in the rest of your berries and pour into the crust. An open-faced blueberry pie may be unconventional, but the fresh berries are so good in it (and it's a lot easier to get your filling to set).

Next time increase the corn starch to 6 tablespoons and blueberries to 6 cups.  This time, it is made as a open face pie, single crust.

I made this a few days ago. I used frozen berries from my backyard (the bag also had a few raspberries mixed in), I figured this might make it runnier since the berries sometimes are broken and the juice comes out, so I doubled (at least, I was using heaping spoonfuls) the cornstarch. The fact that I grew the blueberries and they were a bit tart made the pie seem a bit more tart than expected, but that has to do with my berries. I liked it, but I'd consider upping the sugar a bit if I do that again. Due to the potential runny-ness, I also cooked it a little longer than hour. but in the end, it smelled great cooking, tasted great, and I ate most of it myself.

Maybe it's because all I had on hand was frozen blueberries, but even though I let it set up overnight, the thing was just a runny mess.  But it's pie, so you overlook that, right?  Only to a point -- it just wasn't that tasty either. Probably could have used more sugar or a little lemon or something but it was kind of bleh.

Loved it! Fabulous recipe! Made it for Valentine's Day dinner. My blueberry pie was sweet enough and set just wonderfully. Proportions are great. Next time I make it, I think I will keep the ratios the same, but just putting more filling in the pie so it ends up bigger and more domed. The whole house smelled SO NICE while it was baking and cooling. This is a keeper!

Very good,but will follow the recommendation of KRPayne next time.  More cornstarch, more lemon. Also recommend mixing dry ingredients with berries before adding to pie.  Very easy and very good.  Liked it.

This looked so gorgeous and tasted fabulous, it was probably my blueberries but it was a little acidic.  However when I paired this with a little vanilla ice cream it was out of this world.  I used frozen blueberries because that's what I had and less sugar (a bit more than 1/3 cup) as well as 5 cups blueberries becuase I was doing a deep dish pie and 5 tbsp flour (I was out of cornstarch).  Worked great although I'm sure with the fresh blueberries this would be great as listed too.

Yummmmm! I added extra corn starch and it turned out beautiful. The kids couldn't wait for it to cool down, so we ate it hot and the filling was just the perfect consistency, not too runny. I think next time I would follow the directions and try just the 3 T of cornstarch, would probably set up perfect once cooled down.

FAR TOO SWEET.  Will try again with half of that amount of sugar.  Also, as the pie baked, I was left with cornstarch showing on top.  
The recommendation to cook at 375 was much better as well.

I really wanted to make a nice blueberry pie but my pie is so runny, it's ridiculous!  I used fresh berries and I added 6 TBSP of cornstarch!! instead of the 3 in the recipe and I just can't believe how runny it came out. It cooled on my counter for 6-7 hours too. It doesn't taste bad, I think maybe the blueberry filling should be cooked first on the stove top and then added to the crust..

This just could not be more easier or make a more delicious pie!  I gave this recipe to a friend who wanted to make them for a bake sale auction.  Her daughter thought it was so good, she wanted mom to go buy them back!  ;-)  I put an egg wash on the crust and sprinkled with sugar.  Wish blueberries were in season all the time with this recipe!

Made this exactly as written and it was delicious! Well, we forgot to 'dot' with butter, but it was still fabulous. We used fresh picked blueberries from a local farm and made the flaky pie crust (from this site) with a lattice top. Most of the work was done by our 10 and 7 year old kids, and they were surprised at how easy it was.

The flavor is there, but the consistency is not.  I read many reviews that said to put 4 tablespoons cornstarch in.  I compromised between the way the recipe was written and other's reviews and added 3 and a 1/2 tablespoons.  The sauce in the pie was still very liquidy and didn't set up.  When I cut into the pie it ran out of the sides.  I also baked it at 400 for about 60-65 minutes.  425 in my oven burns the crust of pies.  It tastes great though, particularly warm with vanilla icecream.  I will likely make this again but next time will add the full 4 tablespoons other reviewers have suggested.

This came out a liquidy mess.  More like blueberry soup.  I followed the recipe as written.  I suspect that it needs a different thickener besides cornstarch.

This pie was delicious! I used 4 tbsp cornstarch per recommendations and it turned out just divine! i did the lattice top and it spilled all over the stove. next time i will use a closed top crust to prevent this from happening again. Otherwise, it was magnificent!

I made this pie for my sweetheart for valentines day.  Blueberry is his favorite.  It was one of the best pies I have ever made, it was easy and I like the fact you only use fresh fruit; non of that can stuff.  We love it!

I used blueberries we froze in the summer, 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/4 cup brown sugar & 1.5 Tbsp lemon juice plus some lemon zest. I too used 5 Tbsp of cornstarch. I put a crumble top on the pie and baked it @ 400 for 55 minutes. It was perfect! I topped it with homemade lemon whipped cream when serving!

Great blueberry pie. Not overly sweet...and I did use 5 tblesp. of cornstarch as several reviewers suggested. This amount resulted in a firm set...I think 4 might have been fine; depends on the juiciness of the berries. This is a "go-to" recipe for blueberry pie.

This is truly an exceptional pie. As recommended by others, I increased the sugar to one cup and used 5 tablespoons of corn starch. I also used the Oil Crust recipe that can be found on this site. I suspect that the lattice crust, which is easy to make, is important to enable the steam to escape and create the right texture. 

I really loved this pie. It's simple and beautifully features the blueberries. Very easy recipe. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful dessert.

I rated this a four because it was runny.  I'm not sure why that happened - but from the reviews I read it could have been the blueberries.  It sounds like the breed can make a significant difference.

It tasted delicious and I will definitely try it again - tweaking the recipe some.  If I get it perfected, I will come back and make it a five-star with my modifications!

Great pie!  I made it twice two days in a row!  I followed the recipe as is except for the following minor additions: (1) I added the zest of one lemon and the juice of half a lemon, I also added 1/4 teaspoon vanilla and (2) I egg-washed the lattice crust.  My pie set perfectly fine with 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, I would not recommend adding more.  I cooled it to slightly warmer than room temperature and it was perfect!

I couldn't believe how EASY this was to throw together, and Delicious!!  I used 5 tsp of cornstarch, and it was still runny when I cut into it, but it was still very warm (I was being impatient :)  It was by no means too sweet - whipped cream on top was the perfect compliment (ice cream would be great, too!)  I will Definitely be making this again, and again!  Thanks for such a simple and delicious summer pie recipe!!

Wonderful!  My family all raved about this pie - I also used more blueberries because I had a 10" pie pan but kept the rest of the ingredients the same...except I made mine almost sugar-free by using 3/4 cup Splenda and added 1/4 white sugar - but don't tell anybody! They didn't even know it was "healthy" pie!

Made this pie twice. Both my husband and my neighbors say it is a hit.I don't measure the blueberries, it just depends how many I have and large a pie I feel like making.  I start out with 3 pints and see out they look.  I use a full crust. I have a very efficient oven so I cook it for 30 minutes, look at it and let it sit in the oven with the power off for another 30 minutes. Comes out wonderful. I do use an egg wash and a little sugar on the crust because that is how my husband likes it and I bake it for him.

Well this is the 1st pie I've ever made. I changed the recipe just a bit with 4 Tbs of cornstarch and 5 cups of blueberries per the other reviews.  I took the pie into work today and it was a hit. The pie was gone in less then 5 mins. I guess I need to make another one so I can try it. Thank you again for sharing your recipe!

After reading the reviews, I increased the cornstarch to 5 tablespoons, added 2 T of lemon juice, and baked the pie for 1 hr at 375 degrees F.  I used 4 1/2 cups of frozen blueberries.  I let the pie cool at room temperature for 1 hr and in the refrigerator for 2 hrs.  However, the pie was still very runny when I sliced it.  Also, next time I would increase the amount of sugar and perhaps leave the lemon juice out or add less.  Overall, I was disappointed with the pie's runny consistency after reading all the raving reviews.

I used fresh berries and 4 T of cornstarch but mine was still a little soupy. I should have also covered the edges of the crust with foil for half the cooking time. The flavor was good though.

I just made this recipe and followed directions exactly. I lost my usual recipe so I thought I'd give this one a try. It was ok. I like my blueberry pie to be sweeter. Next time I will be adding more sugar and cinnamon along with some lemon juice for that little extra something.

We were really disappointed with this recipe. It was okay, but felt it was a waste of fresh picked berries.  The pie was very runny-we followed others instructions and added more 5 tbs. of corn starch.  Not sure if I did something wrong, but not very good.

Blueberry Pie is the best dessert ever. When I was young My Aunt and her family would come to Michigan and pick wild blueberries with us. For three weeks we went picking wild blueberries.  Go early in the morning until summertime that night.I ate just about as many  blueberries as I put in the basket. Nothing could touch that first pie of the season. This recipe has that flavor. I do put a touch a lemon in like my mother.

This is a fantastic recipe for frozen or fresh blueberries.  I have used this recipe many times and it has never failed me.  I even used some frozen blueberries that weren't so tasty and the pie turned out great.  Can't fail on this one!

This turned out SUPER yummy!! Instead of regular sugar I used Truvia (according to Truvia's Conversion Chart). My family loved it. Will definitely make again.

I have never made a fruit pie before, and this was super easy. I used frozen pie crust and store bought blueberries and it was outstanding.  (Sorry traditionalists...) A couple of tips:  if using frozen pie crust, get the deep dish one, not regular.  I used the regular and didn't get the good edges on my crust.    Also, I used 4 TBSP cornstarch,a nd just a tad of extra sugar.  I lightly covered the pie until the last 20 minutes of baking and the crust turned out perfect.  I also baked on 400 in middle oven rack.  Be sure to bake pie on a cookie sheet.

This was the first pie I have ever made, and while I had some mishaps with it from the oven to my car, I brought it to a family gathering today and everyone loved it! My Aunt who does not even really like Blueberry pie, said it was prize worthy. My crankiness from the mishaps went away quickly and all was well with the world :)

YUMMY! it was my first time making blueberry pie and I wanted to make it this thanksgiving. It came out very well my only suggestion is that it needs a bit more sugar since the pie was a bit sour for my taste and also maybe a bit more cornstarch . It was delicious though and everyone LOVED IT!

This is a great pie! My husband said it was the best blueberry pie he had ever eaten. I used 5 cups of frozen blueberries and increased the cornstarch to 5 Tbsp. I forgot to add the butter, but it did not matter. It had a great texture and was not rubbery or excessively juicy as other reviewers had said. Wondeful recipe! I will make this over and over again.

This was the best blueberry pie I have ever made...my pie plate held 6 cups of berries.  So...I used 1 cup sugar...5 tablespoons of cornstarch...and added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg.  Absolutely loved the flavor...I will try tapioca as a binder (as per some other reviews).  I truly believe that where and when you bought the berries will affect the density of the filling; and then adjustment must be made.

I give this delicious pie 5 stars easily !  I took the advice of others, and used 5 cups of blueberries (freshly picked) 4-5 Tbs of cornstarch and some lemon juice.  It came out perfectly!  I set my oven on 400, and covered the edges of the pie crust first with foil for about 35-40 minutes, then took it off for the last 15-20 min.  It came out fantastic, I served it for friends who said it was the best blueberry pie they've had!  I also used the best flaky pie crust from this site as well.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum!  I made a couple of small changes.  Used 1 Tbsp cornstartch per cup of berries.  Might have been able to use just a tad more.  Also used 1 c sugar.  Very good summer treat.

I decreased the amount of sugar to 1/3 cup and added 2 additional tablespoons of cornstarch as one review suggested. The butter got forgotten in a haste. I baked it at 375 degrees for 50 min. The pie turned out fabulous! We were a bit short on time so we cut the pie half an hour after it was taken out of the oven, and the filling was already perfectly set. It was very delicious! I had never liked pies before, but this pie certainly changed my views of them!

This was absolutely delicious and easy to make!!  This was my first blueberry pie I ever made and it turned out beautifully.  I used flour instead of cornstarch–no problem.  I made a crust using the traditional crisco recipe (My favorite).  I'd rate it more stars if I could!  Thanks for the recipe, I'll definitely be using this again!

Mine came out very soupy and I even added an extra tablesoon of cornstarch like others recommended. Next time I think I will try 3 extra tablespoons. The flavor was very good though. I added an extra cup of blueberries as well since it didn't fill up my pie plate as much as I liked.

Delicious! I took the advice of others and increased the sugar to 1 cup, cornstarch to 5 tablespoons and berries to 5 cups (4 cups wasn't enough to fill the dish).  I let it set overnight and woke up early to sneak a piece.  Perfectly set.  =) Great recipe.

This was a perfect pie. We doubled up on the cornstarch and cooked the blueberry, sugar, cornstarch, and butter mixture together for a few minutes, then added a little lemon juice and cinnamon. It was great.

My first ever pie!!! This was so yummy, perfect balance of sweetness. People couldn't believe I didn't use pie filling but it was so easy! I do recommend using equal tbls of cornstarch to each cup of berries. Other than adding 2 tbls lemon juice and raw sugar everything was the same. I didn't even notice the cinnamon so it is def not overpowering.  I did an egg wash and sprinkled raw sugar on top and then covered the top for a good part of the time with foil because it had so browned quickly. And having some foil under the pan in case it bubbles over is good. Mine did.

This was the first pie I've ever made and it was amazing! After reading the other reviews, here are the changes I made: 5 cups of blueberries, 4 tbsp of corn starch, 2 tbsp lemon juice, cover edges until last 10 minutes. My husband said it was so good he was going to cry :)

I followed the advice of other bakers and increased the corn starch to 4 TBSP. I added 2 TBSP. of lemon juice and 1 tsp. of grated lemon peel. To avoid spillage, I used an old fashioned pie bird and it did the trick. I let the pie set, uncut and undisturbed for at least four hours, and it was not runny. The pie tassted great and if yo are a blueberry lover, this is the pie for you!

Hubby said it was the best pie he ever had.   I tried the 4 tbsps of cornstarch but think I would have stuck with 3 tbsps.   I used the juice of a medium lemon.

I made this with fresh berries and followed the following suggestions from other reviewers: 1) I upped the berry content a bit (about 4.5 cups), 2) I upped the corn starch to 4 Tbsp, 3) I lowered the oven temperature to 400 degrees, and 4) I put foil on the edges of the crust until the last few minutes. As it turned out, the pie ended up needing an extra 10 or 15 minutes, so I probably should have just baked it at 425 in the first place (I did the lattice top). It set up very well with 4 Tbsp of corn starch, and I definitely would not recommend using more than that.

I read the reviews and took their advice and used 4 T. corn starch and it was perfect. The only thing I would do differently next time is omit the cinnamon. I don't care for the cinnamon taste with blueberries. I also used Splenda instead of sugar to cut a few calories. Otherwise, hubby and I enjoyed it very much.

Even though I made some minor alterations, I am still giving this 5*s because it is probably the easiest pie I've ever made.  It helped that I was lazy (ok, busy...) and used pre-made pie crusts (USUALLY make my own).  I also did about 3 cups blueberries and 2 cups fresh cherries (pitted!), 5 TB cornstarch, zest and juice of 1 lemon. I scaled it up this way a bit because I was using a deep dish pie pan and didn't want it to fall short.  Once cooled COMPLETELY (frige 2 hrs MINIMUM!!!) it cut like a dream and was WONDERFUL with gourmet vanilla ice cream.  Great the next day too.  We LOVE fresh fruit pie and this one was a WINNER!!!

This was so easy I was sure I screwed it up. I have never made blueberry pie before and after eating this I don't understand why! It was sooo delicious and so simple. Literally took me like 5 minutes to throw together. My only recommendation is to watch the cooking time. After 40 minutes mine was bubbling over and I took it out after 45. Super Great Recipe!

I gave it 3 stars because it was a SUPER sweet pie and I think it could use a lot less sugar.  However, I took the leftovers and made it into ice-cream and that was out of this world!  Thank you for the recipe.

I didn't have fresh blueberries so I used frozen. I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch and ended up with a great tasting blueberry soup pie.  Will definitely try again with fresh blueberries.

Made this in August and froze it unbaked without trying it until last week. WOW! I got rave reviews from all involved. Unfortunately I can't remember if I changed anything in the recipe, probably not because I usually try to stick to the original the first time I make something. Anyway, it was a wonderful taste of summer in the dead of winter. Thank you!

This was my first ever blueberry pie. I followed the advice from some of the reviews and made these changes: 1 cup sugar, 6 tbsp cornstarch, 5 cups of blueberries, a splash of lemon juice, and 2 tbsp butter. I also covered the lattice crust in an egg wash and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. I baked it at 400 degrees for 50 minutes. The pie cooled for 6 hours before cutting and was a perfect consistency. I give the original recipe 4 stars, but 5 stars with the changes made.

This pie was delicious. I used 5 Tbs of cornstarch and 1 cup of sugar as some of the reviews recommended. I think I could get away with 6 Tbs of cornstarch next time, the filling was still just a bit too runny. The only issues I had were that the filling bubbled over and formed a large puddle in the bottom of my oven so I'll be sure to place a cookie sheet beneath it next time and the crust became glued to the pie pan because the juice that leaked out seeped under the crust. However, it was still tasty and I will make it again.

This pie is so good! I did make a few small changes. I used 4 cups frozen blueberries, 5 Tab cornstarch, 1/4 teas cinnamon, 2 Tab butter. Baked at 400 with edges covered with foil for 1 hour. Let rest 2 hours before cutting. PERFECT!!

Great pie! I used 4 cups of frozen blueberries (didn't thaw, just threw 'em right in there!)  I used 5 Tablespoons cornstarch as suggested, and added a small splash of lemon juice.  I completely forgot the butter and didn't miss it at all!  My boyfriend said it was the best blueberry pie he's ever had!  I brushed egg/milk over the lattice top with a pastry brush and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Delicious! Thanks!

We had a ton of blueberries in the freezer from my sister-in-law, so I was trying to figure out what to do with them.  This pie had great flavor, but even when adding the extra TB of cornstarch was still rather runny.  My husband was holding it in his lap while we were riding to a fish fry, and it actually leaked all over his pants (We still served it)  Anyway, the pie was gone in 5 minutes!  I gave the lattice crust an egg wash and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  Cooked at 400 for an hour.  Do cover the edges with aluminum foil!  They will brown way too quick.  Luckily caught that before it happened.  Will make again but add 5 TB of cornstarch instead.

WOW-ZERS!! GREAT PIE! I used fresh blueberries and 4 T of cornstarch. I made this for my Mom's b-day since she LOVES pie... she said it was the best blueberry pie she had in a long time! I cooked it at 400. then let it sit out overnight... no runny mess like some said they had! Perfect! UPDATE:: To get the bottom crust awesome and not soggy... Here are some things you can try: 1. chill your crust before you fill it (after you line the pan, stick it back in the fridge for 15 minutes). This keeps the filling from soaking in before the bottom crust can cook. 2. preheat the oven to 425, sprinkle bottom with some sugar, then cook it for about 15 minutes... then fill and top layer (add a little sugar there too). 3. bake your pie on the lowest rack in the oven. Some people even bake their pie right on the floor of the oven (if that is possible for your oven).

Ok so I may have used too many suggestions from other bakers because it came out really runny.  Will probably try it again and follow the directions to the T.  Flavor was good though!

Good recipe. I followed other suggestions and used 5 T of cornstarch, 1 C of sugar and a bit of lemon juice. I also reduced the oven temp to 400. It still turned out a bit runny, but it tasted great. I will make it again and try using 6 T of cornstarch.

I made this twice. The second time, I increased the cornstarch to 5 Tbs (thank you, other posters!) and reduced the heat to 400. Also used a lattice crust instead of a full crust. The pie was still runny, but the flavor was great.

This pie was fantastic.  I did increase the cornstarch to 5 Tbs and added 2 Tbs of lemon juice, and cooked it at 375 - everything else was as the recipe is written.  It came out really good - so good with some vanilla ice cream!  No complaints, I'll make this recipe again and again!

Very very good! The cinnamon adds a nice touch to it. I used 5 cups of fresh blueberries because I too have the Pampered Chef deep dish pie baker. I increased the sugar a little but not enough so next time I'll use a bit more. I followed other reviews and used 5 Tbs.of corn starch, next time I'm going to use 6 because it was still a little runny. I too used a splash of lemon juice but it was very tart and I tend to like my fruit pies on the sweeter side. Great recipe though thank you!! Will def. make again :)

I've made this twice now and it turned out great.  I'd recommend following the recipe before messing around with the suggestions too much, as in my experience at least, it works well as written.  The first time I made it I added extra cornstarch as per some of the review suggestions, but don't think it was necessary.  My pie was plenty sweet as well, I wouldn't recommend adding more sugar unless you have a real sweet tooth, or your berries are on the tart side.  Be sure to bake on a lower shelf of the oven, or the crust might brown too much.  I found that out the hard way.  Thanks for the recipe.

This made a delicious pie. The blueberry mixture bubbled up nicely. In future I would leave out the cinnamon because in a way I felt like it interfered with my enjoyment of the blueberry flavour. That said, I found myself fighting off the urge to lick my plate clean!

WOW.. My husband declared this the best blueberry pie he's ever eaten in his whole life, and that even counted the great pies his grandma used to make. That's probably the highest compliment I've gotten in our 27 years of marriage! I too, used Stephanie's Basic Flaky Pie Crust recipe, and have also found my new crust favorite. What a combination... I think I'm going to enter this one into the fair for a first try this year. Thank you so much, Yum!!!

Adding the corn starch to thicken the juices works well. I've done other recipes without that and it ends up runny.  I substituted half Splenda/half sugar and it tasted great. Couldn't tell a difference -- even my husband agreed.

I followed the recipe exactly against my better judgement...I live at altitude and love to bake and cook and usually do fine when I adjust recipes but I didn't.  This looked awesome and smelled awesome but all I got was blueberry soup. I learned a trick a while back that I should have used...dried cranberries add tartness and also help suck up the excess moisture.  Won't be making this again.

This is a great recipie I add 4 tbsp of cornstarch and 6 cups of blueberry 2 tbsp of lemon juice .If you make with frozen blueberry will be just as good ,just make sure to cook the blueberry with sugar for 12 minutes in the pan ,cool and transfer to the oven in the middle rack ,my family love this pie with strawberry ice cream

I've never had blueberry pie before, but had gallons upon gallons of last year's harvest that I have to clean out of my freezer, so I tried this. I really don't like blueberries a whole lot, but this pie I must say is Amazing!!! My blueberries are a bit tart, so I didn't add lemon juice and they're still a little tart. I did use 5 cups frozen berries with absolutely NO juice at all. I added 5 T all purpose flour and 1-1/4 cup sugar, and overlapped cutout stars for the top instead of lattice. I also heaped the 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, so it was more like a whole teaspoon. I cooked it for 1 hour 25 minutes at 375, covering it loosely for about 30 minutes halfway through cooking. It was FANTASTIC!! I ate one piece 5 minutes out of the oven and it was perfect.

This is was the best I've had.  I made no changes except used a double crust instead of a lattice top.  3 T of cornstarch was plenty.  It set up just enough to not be runny but not be like a gel. Which I don't like my pies to be.

I made this pie.  It was so delicious. The best part.  It was super easy, especially since I used the prepared crust.  I would highly recommend this with Edy's low fat vanilla yogurt ice cream.  Delicious.

Great recipe.  Easy as pie to make...really!  I had it in the oven in fifteen minutes.  By increasing the cornstarch, it really helps the consitency of the pie and will hold up better.  I baked at 400 for 1 hour.  Very pleased!

I made this today and got rave reviews from my fiance and three other male roommates! They all loved it! I added one extra tablespoon of cornstarch and a squeeze of lemon juice as the other reviews recommended.  I loved this recipe and cant wait till I can try it again!

Best Blueberry pie ever! =)  I made this with Basic Flaky Pie Crust by Stephanie and it was all superb.  I used frozen blueberries because I had them and add the extra cornstarch like suggested in others just because my berries were frozen and it turned out great.  No one could leave this one alone!!

Blueberry pie is my boyfriend's favorite dessert, and this is my favorite recipe for making it! It's so easy, and it always turns out perfect. I use a tiny bit more cornstarch than is called for, but not a full 4 tablespoons. Thank you, this recipe is now my staple for surprising him with pie:).

This pie is so delicious.  However, I did make some minor changes:  1 & 1/4 cups white sugar, 4 TB cornstarch, 5 cups fresh blueberries.  I baked at 375 on the middle rack & I brushed the crust with milk & sprinkled it with cinnamon & sugar.  I think it was just too much berries or perhaps not enough cornstarch as it was extremely WET but oh so good!  Every bit was eaten, even the last piece that didn't look so great because of all the juice!  A little pricey to make so I will have to wait until blueberries are in season!

The best blueberry pie ever!  I took the suggestions from the other reviewers and increased the corn starch up to 5T.  I also cut back the cinnamon to 1/4 t. (will use even less next time - still a little too much).  I used 2 bags of frozen blueberries, which I thawed and drained MOST of the juice off, but not all as I didn't want to lose the blueberry flavor.  Hubby said it was the best blueberry pie he has ever had!  Definitely a winner!!  Will make again and again.

This was great! I added 1 extra tbsp of cornstarch. I waited over an hour to cut it, but those two pieces didn't hold together. Once it had cooled, and I refrigerated it, it held together fine.

the original recipe was ok, but i made some changes the second time around that i think made the pie taste really good, okay so when i was making the pie i found out i didn't have enough blueberry's so i used an apple instead it was one of those green and red ones anyways i diced it up to match the size of the blueberries and also i added about two teaspoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice besides that i followed the recipe exactly, i used a full top pie crust, the pie crust was an all shortening recipe but i altered that as well i sprinkled confectioners sugar on the top of the pie then oven toasted quick oats and then dotted the top with shortening, was wonderful the only thing i would do different next time is add a little bit more sugar but turned out great!!  oh yeah it was a mix of blueberry's and apple not just apple it was about 3 cups of blueberry's and a whole diced apple.

I used frozen organic blueberries, and it turned out excellent.  I didn't thaw the blueberries at all before putting it in the oven.

I had never made a pie before. I tweaked this out to help make it more Diabetic friendly. I used 1/4 cup + 2 tbs Splenda Blend, bumped the cornstarch up to 5 tbs and added 2 tbs of lemon juice to the blueberries. The pie was so good that even I enjoyed it and I am not a blueberry pie fan!!!!

The pie was tasty and loved by all.  I used the following suggestions:  omitted the butter, added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, increased the cornstarch to 5 1/2 tablespoons, and boiled the mixture for 5 minutes before filling the pie shell.  Does anyone know a way to keep the blueberries from cooking down all the way.  The filling was more like a jelly with few whole berries remaining.  Any input would be great!

Made this as written except substituted a little less than half a cup of flour for the cornstarch. Consistency is excellent - not runny once it's cooled. I used the entire top crust and baked at about 375 for 45 minutes.

This was awesome.  I did up the blueberries to 3 pints (6 cups), because the crust just didn't look "full".  I used the 5 Tbsp of cornstarch like the other reviews recommended.  I kept the sugar the same and the same baking time.  It was really delicious.  

It was a little runny, but we just kept that sauce for ice cream topping!

This was okay. The flavor was very good but my pie turned out pretty runny as some others said too! Will have to up the amount of cornstarch if I try again.

Good basic pie.  I did increase the cornstarch to 4T and the texture was perfect.  I used two crusts so I lowered the temp to 400 as suggested by another reader.  I still had to cover the crust edges half way through to keep them from burning, but other than that the pie came out perfectly.  I did not have cinnamon so I used nutmeg and I think it complimented the berries perfectly.

I wish that I had fresh blueberries available for less than a small fortune for this pie.  I made it with frozen and still it recieved rave reviews at Thanksgiving.  I followed the advice of others and used 6TBS of cornstarch and the consistency was perfect.

Thanks to this recipe combined with the many helpful tips from other reviewers, this pie was the hit of Thanksgiving day!
Thank you everyone!  My tweaks: I used 4 cups fresh and 2 cups frozen blueberries (I thawed and drained the frozen). I also combined white and brown sugars (1/2 cup white, 1/4 brown). 
For the temp I went between 375 and 400 and covered the crust for a good portion of that time to keep it from over browning. I also used 5 tablespoons of cornstarch.  The pie was absolutely PERFECT. It set well at room temp and cut wonderfully while still being very moist and juicy. Needless to say I left Thanksgiving with an empty pie plate. I think it's my new admission ticket to holiday gatherings.

Great.  This was a classic recipe.  I didn't have a blueberry pie recipe in my collection, but now I do!  :)  I did increase the corn starch.  Oh and also you need to put foil on the edges of the crust because it will burn otherwise. :)

Easy to make with a great taste.  I actually only had one piece before I left for work, when I got home, it was gone.  When I asked what kind of pie my husband wanted next week, he said another blueberry.  I would call that a 5 star pie

It turned out rather yummy! I didn't have cornstarch so I used 8 tablespoons of flour (double the 4 tablespoons of cornstarch). I also used store-bought pie crust to make it easier/quicker as well.

This is a great pie and my entire family loved it. I also used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch and the consistency was great. Halfway through the baking, I had to cover the edges of the crust with foil so it wouldn't burn. For some tastes it may have been too sweet. I might try a little less sugar next time.

I made the pie a day ahead of my dinner party, and used 4 T cornstarch and the consistency was perfect.  I also used frozen wild blueberries and they held their shape and had great flavour and colour.  This was my first blueberry pie and I will use this recipe again for sure!

This was a great recipe. I also used "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" and it turned out great. The only thing I did was I made mini tarts in muffin tins. These looked better, and they were so cute and petite! Although it takes more effort to make them, they're worth it1

Great pie!  I used fresh blueberries and added extra cornstarch, which did thicken it up.  I used a pre-made pie crust and it worked great.

This pie is so amazing and amazing!  I made the suggested changes of more cornstarch (I used 4.5 tbsp) and the lower oven temp - 400 for a little longer than the suggested time, keeping the crust edges wrapped with foil the whole time.  I used a frozen pie crust and it was still so tasty with rave reviews (one of my fans saying "I savored every bite!")

I don't know how you can mess this pie up!  It is absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  I used the roll out pie shell, and 4tbsp of cornstarch and 1 cup of sugar like others suggested! My family loved this pie.

WOW! This was one beautiful pie!  I haven't had a slice of it yet, but it just came out of the oven and if it is HALF as tasty as it is gorgeous.  i am sold.  I did what the others suggested, with the corn starch and the sugar except I only used 1 cup.  Thanks for an awesome new favorite!

Excellent berry pie.  I used frozen local blueberries and added a bit more cornstarch.  I ended up with a very thick pie (not soupy) that you could eat without a plate and for many of us-we LOVE blueberry pie that way.  Less mess.  Thanks fo sharing.  I think the basic concept wourk work with other fruits.

this was very good. i followed other reviews and used 4 tablespoons of cornstarch and it turned out perfect. i used a bag of frozen mixed berries and frozen pie crust. though i forgot to add the butter and it was fine. i found the temperature was too high to have on the whole time. after about 20 minutes the edges of the crust too browning too quickly and i had to put foil around it and turn the temperature to 350 to finish cooking. i would definitely make this again.

i don't think this called for enough sugar. it also bubbled over tremendously. taste was alright, but i think it was a waste of blueberries.

I added just a sprinkling of lemon zest and the flavor was great. I didn't think I would like bluebrry pie, but I'm making this again. The only problem is my pie never made juice. . Maybe it needed to bake longer. I'll have to turn the temperature down a little next time.

Awesome pie!!  I did as others recommended and added 5TBSP of cornstarch instead of 3.  I let it sit for two hours before serving.  Wasn't runny at all and still warm!  The only thing that I would recommend with this recipe is to make two pies because the first pie was gone within minutes!

I took the advice and used 5 tablespoons of cornstarch and it didn't come out runny. I also cheated and used a frozen pie crust and it still came out great.

Very good but the pie was a little tart despite the sweet blueberrie.  Maybe more sugar?  Also the top burned a bit-maybe 40-45 minutes would do it.

Yummy recipe. Have made this twice, once I added an extra two T. of corn starch as others stated- turned out perfect. The other time I realized I was out of cornstarch, so I substituted 8 T. of all-purpose flour- again it turned out great. So easy!

This pie tasted great.  I just wish I had read the reviews more carefully before making.  This recipe really does need more cornstarch!  Mine turned out too runny.  I will make again though and just remember to increase the cornstarch.

YUM!  I sprinkled some lemon juice over the blueberries before adding in the sugar, cornstarch, salt, and cinnamon.  I also heaped the tablespoons of cornstarch and and heaped the 1/2 tsp of cinnamon becouse I love the taste of cinnamon.  Turned out excellent, we could hardly wait to let it cool.  Yes, it was somewhat runny but it's *homemade* and the taste was worth it!  I did have to cover the crust with foil part way through to keep it from darkening too much.

I think the best part about this pie is how easy it is to make! My mom and I used it as a last minute dessert for a dinner. The pie was very runny, so I wished I had read to add more cornstarch- that would have helped. We ended up putting the cobbler like pie in bowls with van. i.cream on top. Yummy.

Great recipe.  I added 3 rounded Tbsp of cornstarch to the blueberry mix.  After I filled the crust, I refrigerated the pie for 10 minutes, baked 25 minutes at 400F then about 45 minutes at 350F until the crust was golden.  I let the pie cool for about 2 hour, then there was just a little bit of juice when I sliced it.

This pie was the best I've ever made and one of the best I’ve ever eaten.

I added a bit extra corn starch based on others reviews. I used two bags of frozen blueberries and one small package of fresh berries on top. I also used Splenda rather than sugar. Oh, I also used whole wheat pastry flour in my crust. It was very healthy and extra yummy.

Super!  I was wondering how it would turn out w/ frozen berries (since that was all I had).  It was terrific!  We added a little butter to the top of the crust before baking.  I didn't do the lattice crust, and perhaps that is why it came out a little runny...But the taste was fabulous!

When fruit pies are TOO WATERY, try adding one or two tablespoons of TAPIOCA (crushed, not the pearl type).  It thickens the fruit without risking having a cornstarchy or flour-y flavor.

This was my first blueberry pie and it turned out great!  I used frozen blueberries and defrosted them under running water and then increased the cornstarch to 5 tbsp.  I also increased the cinnamon to a full teaspoon. It was perfect!  Great flavor and not too runny.

I used frozen bluberries and a Mrs. Smith's deep dish pie shell and this was simply the best pie I ever made!! I put the dry ingredients into a ziplock bag and added the still frozen berries and shook them up and dumped the whole thing into the crust, it was fabulous!! I would not change a thing!

Delicious and very easy to make.  I made it with the Baker's Secret Pie Crust from this site, (which turned out perfect!) I made the filling with 1 cup of splenda instead of sugar, I used 2 16 oz. bags of frozen blueberries. Instead of cornstarch I used 5 Tbs. of Minute Tapioca and I also added 2 Tbs. of lemon juice. Next time, I am going to double the amount of cinnamon. Loved every bite!

Outstanding! Always have compliments when I make this pie.  Need a little more cornstarch (4 Tblsp.) when using frozen berries or it will come out too juicy.  Excellent flavor, hard to beat!

this was my first pie ever and it turned out GREAT! i think it would be a good idea to reduce the oven temp a bit since my crust browned quickly at 425. i also like the idea of mashing up the berries a bit before pouring into the crust. the neighbors came over after dinner and everyone loved this pie served with a dollop of lemon curd on the side and garnished with a sprig of mint.

Deeelish! I added more corn starch as suggested by other reviewers. I didn't have any lemon juice, so I used orange juice instead. I baked it at the lower temperature as well. It came out great with a bit of a different flavor that no one could put their finger on. Most said that it was the best blueberry pie that they ever tasted. This will be our little secret. This recipe is a keeper for sure. Thanks Beth for the submission.

My husband says this is the best dessert he's ever had in his life, and I agree!  I usually don't even care for blueberries, but fortunately I had some to use up this week so we tried this recipe.  We followed the directions exactly, except for adding an extra tbsp of cornstarch.  After baking 50 minutes, the pie was just juicy enough, definitely not too runny.  We used "Pie Crust" from this site (wonderful), and topped it off with homemade frozen vanilla custard, which we HIGHLY recommend -- the creamy custard melting over the warm pie is the ultimate comfort food, but still light enough for summer!  This is a great recipe, we'll be making it over and over.

Yummy!!  Very juicy, even after adding 4 tbsp of cornstarch as recommended by other reviewers.  Needed to shield edge of crust for last 15 mins of baking, but will definately make again.  Used 'Grandma's Secret Pie Crust' from this site for the pastry - also very yummy!

This made a terrific blueberry pie.  I added the zest from one small lime to add a fresh, citrus-y twist.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This pie was soooooo TASTY and sooooo EASY.
My friends loved it. I made it with frozen blueberries. Not too runny and not too dry. I cooked it for about 10 min longer than called for and foiled the edges from the start.
I used Pillsbury Frozen Pie dough. It was my first pie so  the crust didn't look beautiful but it tasted great.  Does anyone know if the same recipe would work if use frozen mixed berries or just raspberries?? Thanks Beth!!

Excellent!! This was my first blueberry pie and it tasted great. I did use 4 tblspns. of corn starch like others requested. Think I will use maybe 5 next time....a little watery....but thats because I used frozen blueberries(so I think the extra moisture made this not as thick). Great taste.....will make again very soon....family loved this! Thanks Beth!!

Great pie! I used frozen and it worked out fine. I think next time as many people suggested I will use 4 Tbsp of corn starch instead of 3 Tbsp. It thickened nicely but could have been a little thicker.

This one's a keeper! I was making 2-3 pies a week when blueberries were fresh in our market. 

I also tried the french pastry pie crust which is fantastic in it's own rite.  The two together are an unbeatable pair. 

I added a splash of lemon. The cornstarch worked fine for me. Tried it with the tapioca, but I decided to get fancy and make a lattice weave crust. The only problem was that whatever tapioca was exposed turned a bit crunchy. It was still good though.

This pie was good but I will change a few things if I make it again.  I didn't like the taste of cornstarch in my pie so I will probably try tapioca next time.  Also, it wasn't quite sweet enough so I would use 1 cup of sugar.  I'm still undecided about the cinnamon.  It gives it a different flavor.

Great delicious summer recipe.  I used 2 bags frozen blueberries.  Tastes very
fresh.  Filling will thicken after cooling...will be runny when first taken out of over.
My boyfriend loved it!

This was awesome....I had to use flash frozen berries instead of fresh, since it's
impossible to find fresh berries during the holidays, but it still came out great.  
I added cranberries, and it added a nice tart compliment to the pie.

A delicious summer treat. Use all of those extra berries. Any berries can be used in place of blueberries. Raspberries are a good substituite. If you try any pie this summer do this one!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out fine but when I sliced into it, it is more like a sloppy mess than a slice of pie. It doesn’t stay together. I will try it again using a pie bird but so far I do not recommend this recipe because it doesn’t stay together

After reading reviews, I used 4 Tbl. cornstarch, lattice top, and
baked at 375 for 50 min; cover removed for last 15 min.  the berries have white spots all over them from the cornstarch.  The crust is dark brown - just short of burn.  Will go back to using tapioca

Yummy! I used 5 cups of frozen blueberries, increased the cornstarch to 4 tbsp and added a splash of lemon juice per the other reviews. Classic blueberry pie :)

The BEST blueberry pie you will EVER eat!!  The only thing I did differently was adding a lil more cornstarch and baking it for 15 minutes at 425 degrees then at 350 degrees for around 30 minutes.  I squeezed some fresh lemon to the blueberries for some tang. Delicious!!!  My husband ate two pieces right off the bat!!

I add vanilla to everything because I love it but other than that I followed this recipe exactly and it came out wonderful. It has a really nice sweet and tart flavor, the filling set up for me after letting it sit for a few hours and we enjoyed it just slightly warm. This was one of the best pies I’ve ever made.

Decent recipe. I added a little lemon juice as I usually do and smashed some of the blueberries beforehand to get some juices mixing with the sugar and corn starch. Mine came out great with maybe a little too much juice. Next time I’ll hold back some if the juice seems too much. Gonna surprise the wife tonight and have it with Vanilla ice cream for desert! ( only 4 stars cuz nothing’s perfect )

Would definitely add a note to say, make the filling a few hours before, add the cornstarch and sugar to lyse the blueberries  so when you bake it, it will gel better.

This was delicious! I put all the ingredients plus the butter in a pan and simmered it for a  little while. Let it cool then in the pie shell. I didn't do the fancy top I just slit it and topped it with cinnamon and sugar and a little egg white for color. I will make this again and even do different berries.

I followed the recipe exactly!  It came out perfect!  I used blueberries that were frozen from my garden.  Not watery like other viewers complained about.  Used Basic Flaky Pie Crust from this site for my crust.  Absolutely perfect!

Excellent and very easy recipe! The blueberry pie was a big hit after our Thanksgiving dinner. Only changes we made was baking at 400 degrees for 20 minutes until crust is beginning to turn golden brown then covered edges of crust with tinfoil and lowered oven to 350 degrees and baked for another 40 minutes until center of pie began to bubble.

I personally think I may have messed up on how much cinnamon I used, do to that problem the pie tasted very "cinnamonie'  to the point I had to eat some of the pie then throw  the rest of the pie away. So word of advice check everything before mixing it.

I made this recipe mostly as-is, with the exception of an added scant tablespoon of flour to the blueberry mixture.  I was afraid of it being runny and didn't want to use too much cornstarch that might give it a gummy texture.  It came out perfect and it was delicious!  Now I just have to practice my lattice ;)  Tip: let the pie cool for at least an hour (two is better) and it will cut clean.

This is a decent recipe; the only differences that I did for this recipe was to substitute tapioca for cornstarch---equal amount substitution. And, I substituted almond extract for cinnamon. For the extract substitution, you could sub 1/4 - 1/2 tsp--to taste.

Great Pie! So easy. I added a bit of nutmeg. I love the flavor of nutmeg with blueberries.

It was easy and delicious even the day after  I baked it. Since my plans changed the day I made it I just reheated it the next day at 200 degrees for about a half hour and it didn’t seem to affect things at all. To make it I used premade pie crust which did its job of being easy and convenient.  I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and added 2 extra tablespoons of cornstarch. Other than that I didn’t make any changes to the recipe.

Easy and very good. I did only use 1/2 the sugar and I used flour and corn starch not all flour. I also used 5 cups of fresh blueberry so. It came out great.....

I’ve made this twice, 1st time followed to a T and it turned out runny and didn’t say up. The 2nd time, which I made today, I took advice from other reviews that said to use more cornstarch, so I added 6 tablespoons, baked for 50 minutes.  Pie turned out a beautiful brown, but once the first slice was cut, the filling just flooded out. It tasted good, we’re just going to pour it over ice cream and I’ll keep searching for another recipe. It tasted great, don’t get me wrong, it just didn’t set up and I’ve gave it 2 chances.

I made no changes and this pie turned out perfectly. I cooled it on the counter for about an hour and then refrigerator for an hour. The filling was set and not runny. My go to from now on!

This was so easy to make! The only thing I changed was that after 45 minutes I turned the heat to 350 and left it in for another 15 minutes. The edges got pretty brown but didn’t burn. It wasn’t too runny like others have experienced. I will definitely use this recipe again.

The only problem I found was that the amount of corn starch a bit light for the juiciness of the berry's I used. Good flavor overall however I think I would cut out the cinnamon next time

Personally I found the spices way too much.  I like cinnamon but I found the 1/2 tsp really overpowered the blueberry taste.  Think I'll make it without any cinnamon at all next time and let the blueberry flavours shine!!

after following the recipe exactly last summer and the pie turning out a runny (but delicious) mess, this time i listened to the comments. prebaked the crust so it wouldn't get soggy, used 6 tablespoons of cornstarch and let it sit for an hour after baking. everyone loved it. note to future self: maybe 5 tablespoons of cornstarch is best.

It needed more berries (it was sunk in in the middle a bit). My store bought pie crust was a bit chewy in the middle. Could have used a bit more sugar & cornstarch.

I made this pie with some tweaks. I’ve never made a pie before and was getting anxious as I was preparing and reading bad reviews at the same time. 
So the first thing I decided to do was a lattice top on my Pie, because I figured it would at least look pretty. It does not have to be fancy. I made 6-7 strips and it was enough for a 9.5 pie. This is important because the blueberries are able to cook or “boil” freely. Which actually will reduce the “soupiness.”
The second change was using roughly ¼ cup of cornstarch. It was slightly over the ¼ line. I used Bob’s and thought it was finer than an Argo one I had used on something else. Don’t know if that made a difference, but worth mentioning. 
Third is I measured the sugar and removed 3 tablespoons, placed to the side and added 3 tablespoons of dark brown sugar. 
Lastly, I added a tablespoon of lemon (about 1 wedge) and 1 wedge of lemon zest.
After I mixed the ingredients (I was liberal with the cinnamon) I let sit for about 30 min and added the remaining sugar. I scooped the blueberries in the pie with a slotted spoon and while a lot of juice was carried over, half remained in the bowl. (I’ve left this in fridge to be poured over ice cream).
Baked high at 400 for 20 min and reduce to 350 for 35 min. I let it sit in the oven after I turned it off for about 20 min. left out covered tightly over night and when I woke up voila!  I felt like a master chef ready to quit my job and bake for a living! Hope this helps!

I have a hard time getting this recipe to set even with adding the extra corn starch. But the flavor is great. Just scoop it up with spoon and put in on some ice cream - problem solved.

Followed this recipe to a T except I took the advice of one reviewer and added two EXTRA tablespoons of corn starch.  This recipe just made blueberry soup!!!!  I even waited more than three hours before cutting the pie.  Most blueberry pie recipes tell you to boil the fruit first -- and I think I know why now.  This is just a gigantic fail and this is not my first rodeo with pie baking.  Grandma Opal's apple pie works great for me and I've made several other pies -- but this was such a waste of freshly picked blueberries and homemade pie crust that I painstakingly braided etc. etc.  Really unhappy.

After researching different thickening agents for blueberries, I first sprinkled the bottom pie shell with minute tapioca and used 4 Ts corn starch. I also used Maine wild blueberries from our back yard! I too added a splash of lemon juice. Baked at 400 first 15, then at 375 for 35 minutes on middle rack.

made recipe with u-pick michigan blueberries. it was amazing! i forgot the butter at first but i thankfully punched circles in the top crust, so halfway through baking i cut up butter and set it in the circles. not sure if that changed anything but it was delicious! not to runny, and i even sliced it early after only cooling for about an 1 hour and a half.

After reading the reviews, I added 4 tblspns corn starch (all I had left LOL) but the blueberry filling did not set up.  The flavor of the berries was outstanding; just a little juicier than it should have been.  I will try it again since it is blueberry season.

I'm wasn't a blueberry pie fan, but this recipe might have converted me.  Very yummy!  I used my own all-butter crust, but followed the filling instructions to the letter.  To suit my own personal taste, I would include an additional tablespoon of cornstarch because, even though the juices were delicious with vanilla ice cream, I would prefer them to be thicker.   I would also halve the amount of cinnamon.  Cinnamon is delicious, but this recipe is a bit heavy-handed with it.

I added xtra cup of blueberries for a 10" pie (I don't have a 9", 1 xtra T cornstarch, xtra 1/2 ts cinnamon, 1/4 ts cardamon, 1/4 ts nutmeg and about 3-4 T of Lavender vinegar.  I did that so the dry sugar mixture would stay all over the blueberries as it cooked and it added an extra zing to the pie.  My hubby said I "knocked this one outta the ballpark".  I also usually use store bought Betty Crocker pie crusts and I roll them thinner and fold the extra over the top for a rustic looking crust.  I hate the pie crust part and this one makes it easier for me to enjoy more pies.

Changed this recipe according to reviewers' suggestions.  So 5 tbsp cornstarch and 2 tsp of lemon juice and 5 cups of blueberries. also used a store bought pie crust. the crust did brown a bit too much, so I would recommend checking it and either taking the pie out a couple minutes early, or covering with foil as some reviewers suggested.

this is important to note: with a 9 inch store bought crust (not the deep dish kind), the filling (including the change of 5 cups of blueberries) made 2 pies. luckily the package came with two crusts, so i just thawed the second and popped it in.

and finally, taste: this tasted amazing. not overly sweet at all, just enough to allow the fruit too really shine through. superbly easy to make, and absolutely delicious to share. all my friends and family commented on how good this pie tasted, including one who said that she previously hated blueberry pie. both pies were gone within minutes and i'm already planning on making it again. also delicious with fresh whipped cream.  happy baking!

This was really good! I coated large, fresh blueberries with a flour and cornstarch mixture because I wanted to avoid gumminess in the filling. Also, I added about 1 Tbsp. of lemon juice. The pie was neither runny nor gummy, and the cinnamon taste peeked through very well. I would definitely make this pie again.

I read several reviews and added 5 TBS corn starch plus 1 TBS lemon juice.  My pie never set and was a runny mess.  It was also a bit tart tasting - if adding lemon then be sure to add additional sugar.

I followed the recipe almost exactly--I did take other reviewer's advice and upped the cornstarch to 5 T and put foil on the edges of the pie crust and upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp and added a splash of lemon juice. Brushed the crust with egg wash then baked on center rack. I let the pie set for about 3-4 hours and it was still a little runny, but we kept the pie in a bread box and ate it over the next few days. When it had time to set overnight, it was perfect, not runny or rubbery.

Rating this 5 stars for the filling. I did not make any alterations, other than leaving off the butter on the top. I'm rating this 5 stars as-is. However, NEXT time and there will be many next times, I will egg wash the crust on top and sprinkle with sugar. I had forgotten that my Grandma used to do that to her pies. Her crust recipe (long lost, sadly) was the best ever.  Next time, I will do like some others had, use more blueberries and a tad more sugar, but it depends on the sweetness of the fruit - both "changes" to make it a 5 plus star recipe. Thanks for a perfect recipe!

This pie was so easy to make.  I love fresh blueberries and when they are in season they are delicious.  I read several of the reviews indicating that additional cornstarch was needed. I added a total of 5 tablespoons and that was perfect. 

In the video the directions call for the oven to be be 425 degrees and the written directions indicate 375 degrees - so that was a bit confusing.   Decided to preheat to 425 and then turned it down to 375.

I’ve tried this recipe with fresh blueberries and frozen blueberries. It’s sooooo soupy. This recipe really needs flour and extra corn starch for the filling to stay together. The berries are large and juicy and it makes too much liquid for the pie to hold together. Alternatively, you could always just use jello and blueberries for a no bake berry pie. At least that would hold together far better than this recipe.

This pie was super easy and tasted fantastic!  I made this for my mom’s birthday and she said it’s easily the best pie she’s ever eaten.  I think next time I may add a bit more corn starch so that the filling doesn’t run, but overall this was a huge thumbs up from my entire family!

Made this recipe into mini pies which turned out great. Pre-baked the bottom crust at 400 for about 20 minutes (with pie weights for the first 10) then baked it all again at 375 for 20 minutes. Came out beautifully! Thank you!

Thanks for posting.  Although very yummy, it was too runny the first time I made it, so I increased the corn starch to  5TB the second time and added nutmeg for some more flavor.

I picked 6 lbs of fresh blueberries from the bushes and needed to use them up quickly.  I made the easiest blueberry pie on the planet!  It's picture perfect and delicious!   I used homemade crust made from Canola oil and it's so flaky!

The taste is really good but it didn’t thicken up for me. I’m not sure what I did wrong but it was very watery. I used fresh blueberries but they were small. I used a homemade crust.

I didn’t have corn starch, so I had to substitute flour-no problem. This was my first ever blueberry pie (I’ve made plenty of apple) and it turned out great! I made it for my wife and when she said it was good-I knew I did it right!!  I am not a blueberry person, but I had to try it and I even liked it!!  I’ll be making more of these in the future, for sure!!

I did use 6 cups of blueberries, 1.5 cups sugar, 6 T cornstarch and juice of one lemon but that was all it needed to make it amazing for my family. It was very juicy but I did use frozen blueberries so that may have contributed to the juiciness. Nothing wrong with that! Delicious!

Combined 1 cup blueberries and sugar in saucepan over medium heat. Stir to melt sugar. Using hand masher, slightly mash to break up berries. Mix 3 tbs cornstarch with 3 tbs water and add to saucepan. Bring to slight boil while stirring to avoid lumps. Add remaining berries to crust and pour mixture over evenly. Also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. This produced a nice thick pie, tasted awesome, and set up very well!

I just took this pie out of the oven.  Used 4 T cornstarch as suggested by many reviewers, omitted salt, added 1 T lemon juice.  At 375, I suggest covering crusts with foil.  Looks beautiful.  Filling holding its form, not runny at all!  Highly recommend.

I didn't make a lattice crust. Just a regular crust on top. I used a deep dish crust because that's all the store had. I'm glad I did because it would have overflowed a regular crust. This pie was a dream blueberry pie! I made it for my dad for his birthday. He loved it! I'm sure he's finished it by now. Highly recommended.

It was great in regards to spices, however, it was way too tart for my taste.  I would easily double the sugar and add more cornstarch to support the added sugar.  Additionally, I would sugar coat the crust as well.
I'm originally from the midwest so maybe that has something to do with it.

I love this recipe. I followed the adjustments of the first recipe maker and also waited one hour after to cut the pie. Perfect with vanilla ice cream and a long walk following.

Increased the cornstarch, blueberries and cinnamon. Baked at  400 for 15 min then lowered to 350 for 35 min. Delicious.

After reading so many positive reviews I decided to try. I used 4 tablespoons  of cornstarch but still it came out very runny and you can taste the flour mix. I won't make it again.

I've made this many times and I've made some minor changes.  I use a deep dish pie pan, so you need more blueberries and sugar/sweetner.  If you do a deep dish use 6 to 8  cups thawed frozen or fresh blueberries.  I used a solid 1 cup of Splenda (Im diabetic), and increased the cornstarch to 3 rounded Tablespoons, otherwise its a runny mess.  You also need to allow the pie to cool almost completely for it to thicken up and not fall apart when you cut it.  Otherwise my favorite pie I make at home.

The video says to preheat the oven to 425, but the recipe says 375. Which is it? Pie is in the oven now, I used the 375 preheat. Hope it works. I have to give this "rating" some stars or it won't let me post, even though the pie isn't finished yet. I'll give it three for the confusion on the oven preheat temperature. Here's a pic of the pie as it went into the oven a few minutes ago.

I followed the recipe but it turned out "drippy". I put in back in the oven and placed a piece of foil on top hoping it would thicken.  I cooled it and placed in fridge  hoping it would thicken but never did.  I dont understand what happened!  Next time i will thicken my berries on the stove then pour  in pie shell and bake. Im so disappointed! UPDATE:  apparently i didn't leave it in fridge long enough - it finally thickened! Next time I'll add a bit more sugar.

I made this pie with frozen blueberries and it came out great! I did what others suggested by adding more starch (About 4 tablespoons) and letting the pie sit for at least an hour before tearing into it. It was delicious!

Giving 3 stars because the taste was great. But it didn't set at all, even though I upped the cornstarch to 6tbps. I also had to use about another cup and a half of blueberries for my deep dish pie plate. The 4 cups listed would probably be good for a regular shallow dish. The pie is still getting eaten, because it's very flavorful, but it's a mess. I'll definitely use a different recipe next time, and maybe try a different thickener, like tapioca starch. If you make this, don't do it for the first time for a big holiday meal or if you have guests. :)

Loved it-went with recommended changes and used frozen blueberries.  5 C frozen blueberries, 1T freshly squeezed lemon juice, 5T cornstarch.  I also brushed top with milk and sprinkled turbine sugar last 10 min or so.   I made a crust following the Crisco recipe.  Pie held together well.

I absolutely loved this pie! It was so easy and simple and made for a delightful time with my niece. For extra pizzazz I added a small carton of fresh raspberries along with the fresh blueberries. I also added some lemon juice and an extra tablespoon of cornstarch for balance. Turned out to be my favorite thanksgiving dish!

Like everyone else, my pie never setup well.  Use of more cornstarch would only dull the taste and increase acidity.   problem with fresh blueberries is the flavor and consistency will always be uneven.  This recipe is either a hit or miss.

Pretty quick and easy to make!
Got some delicious ripe blueberries and had to try making a pie. I brushed on a quick egg wash before putting it in the oven and came out with that perfect shiny pastry look.  Did not have to keep in the oven the full 50 mins (about 40-45mins was good enough, did not want the crust to burn) Used a bit more blueberries than the recipe calls for. It was a hit at the party.  Between the pumpkin and apple pies, everyone wanted blueberry pie for dessert at Thanksgiving. Everyone complimented on the pie!
Thanks for the recipe!

Used half the amount of blueberries with 1 cup of raspberries for tartness. This will give you a clean cut of pie. If you use 4 cups, the pie is runny, at least for me.

Made a few changes based on other reviews. Used 5 cups of fresh-frozen blueberries (thawed and drained in a colander), cup of sugar, 5 Tbsp of cornstarch and added 1 Tbsp of lemon juice. It was delicious with these changes!  I let it cool completely before cutting and it held together nicely.

I made this blueberry pie for myself and my girlfriend lastnight,I used fresh wild blueberries and the pie was wonderful.  This was the first time i have made a pie in about 20 years. It turned out great and my girlfriend said that I am going to be busy making pies for the holidays. She went to culinary school and I am a retired mechanic. She has me do all the cooking

Came out Wonderful!!! After playing around with the original recipe, this is what changes I made. 6 cups blueberry. 5 Tbls. Cornstarch. Lemon juice,fresh squeeze. 1+1/4 cup splenda. Bake 15 min at 400 with crust shield on at bottom rack. Then reduce heat to 350 with crust shield on for 35 minutes. Last 15 minutes take crust shield off. This is also a sugar free version. Enjoy!! Sometimes I even sprinkle a little ground up flax seed into the blueberries mixture. They never know (kids)

Made the blueberry mixture as follows. I made my own pie dough. Also cooked at 375 F for 50 mins. I am sure 425 F it would be burnt. Mixture was runny when we cut into it. I did let it sit for 5 hrs before cutting. Maybe use more cornstarch next time.

This is the first review I've submitted after years of using the site, but this pie is worth it!  THE best pie I have ever eaten, and i'm  not one to toot my own horn. I made it with 5 cups of berries and 5 Tbsp of cornstarch. Was absolutely perfect!

I made it almost as the recipe but I noticed my blueberries were quite juicy.  So to make sure, I sprinkled a bit of quick tapioca on the bottom crust.  With the vanilla and cinnamon, I also added lemon zest, about a tablespoon.  It turned out and tasted wonderful!

I made this with the suggestions made by other reviewers. Used 5 tablespoons corn starch, added some lemon juice and cooked at 375 for about an hour. Then let it sit for an hour to set. It was amazing!! Family loves it and will make again next time we go berry picking.  I would give the altered version 5 stars and only rated this at 4 because it was altered from original.

I’m not sure how this happened but after the 50 minutes of baking, the dry ingredients were still not dissolved. Crunchy sugar clumps.   What liquid there was, was runny.  I read comments to up the corn starch, which I plan to do but I don’t know if maybe some liquid should be added to make sauce.   Anyone else have this problem?  Addionally, the recipe states 375 but the video 450 and some have commented 400?!?  What is the correct temp?

This turned out really delicious! This was my first time making a pie with raw fruit mixed with sugar and things, so I was overly excited when it came out so well when friends stopped by after dinner! I used a 6oz container of blackberries, and 24oz of blueberries. I upped the cornstarch per reviews to maybe 5T and used 2T lemon zest. I forgot the butter but left everything else the same. Baked as directed...covered the edges with foil when they were browning too fast....Served with ice-cream and all were happy! Super fun and easy! Will do again!

Loved this and so did my husband. It wasn’t too sweet and the blueberries maintained their shape instead of tuning into a mushy gelatinous mess. I might add another bit of cornstarch next time I make this, which will be soon. This filling also makes a great topping for ice cream.

A generous 4 cups of fresh blueberries with 3/4 cups of sugar with 1/2 fresh squeezed lemon was the perfect amount of sweetness to a great pie.
A generous 4 T. of cornstarch made the pie juicy but not runny as so often happens. It worked well with pie crust top if time is an issue or an impressive lattice top.
Yum!

Substitute arrowroot for cornstarch.
The ratio is 1 to 1.
Use 3 1/2 cups blueberry as my pie was shallow.

I used a 1/4 cup cornstarch for fast measuring which is slightly more than called for in the recipe but not much. It turned out good but next time I’ll probably use a fat/mounded 1/4 cup instead. I also put 1/2 the berries in then 1/2 the dry mix and repeated. In the past most recipes I’ve seen said to mix the wet n dry together and they always worked so I didn’t trust the just dumb it on top method. Judge by some of the pictures I was right.

I did add more than a cup more blueberries as I wanted a thick pie. Next time I would add a bit more cornstarch because of that. The pie was delicious! Made with our freshly picked berries.

I followed the recipe to a T and it was awesome.  Baked at 375 as suggested. The only issue I had was the bottom crust stuck to the bottom.  Next time I will try using a dusting of flour first.

Flavor was great!  Took way longer than 50 minutes.  Added an extra tablespoon of corn starch because the first pie (3 Tbsp) too runny.

I made this and loved it, the only thing I changed was the amount of Cornstarch that other reviewers had mentioned. I went with 4 1/2 tablespoons of cornstarch and even after letting sit overnight it was still a little runny when we cut into it,  but tasted amazing so wasn't too upset about that.  Will go with 5 tablespoons next time and see if that eliminates that. Really easy and really good pie recipe will make it again soon!

I took the suggestion to add more cornstarch and some lemon juice and that was the perfect idea.

Actually I used lime juice which gave it a more tropical twist.  Also I ground up dried basil with the sugar, about a tablespoon, instead of the cinnamon, which I am not fond of, and wow, the aroma and taste is heavenly.

I also used pre made crusts because I was short on time today.  I let them defrost while I prepared everything, rolled them out and made a top and bottom in a glass dish.

Only 2 starts because the video says 425 for 50 mins. No way, I burnt it after 35 mins. Then I see the written directions says 375 for 50 mins that might work, but you might want to change the video. I will try this again at 375.

I followed the instructions of the reviewer who upped the berries to 5 cups, the cornstarch to 6 tbsp, and the sugar to 1 1/4 cup. I also added 2 tbsp of lemon juice. I baked it with the lattice top crust for 375, for 55 minutes on the middle rack (although my oven is a bit wonky, hence this adjustment). I used freshly picked berries as well and mine came out really nice. I let it cool for over an hour and it was well set and not runny

I wish I had read the reviews, and not gone by the star rating.
It was too runny, and it was a mess to serve.
Maybe so tapioca or more cornstarch would have been better.
The flavor was good though.

I followed as directed but would make some changes. Recommend less sugar. I love my sweets but this was just too sweet and over took the blueberry flavor. Also maybe use 5 tbsp of cornstarch  or add some flour to thicken a bit more. 3 stars

Quick and easy to make. Whipped it up for dessert when we had some friends over. They couldn’t stop raving about it. Followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious.  I’m going to try it with other berries too. I didn’t have heavy whipping cream so had to use Rediwhip which is not nearly a tasty as fresh whipped cream, but no one was complaining. There were no leftovers.

I love loved loved this!  While I'm sure the fresh blueberries had something to do with it, it worked perfectly!

I did swap out splenda for sugar and reduced to 1/2 cup and it was wonderful and NO sugar added!!!  And I did add a squirt of lemon on the blueberry mixture.  One thing that the instructions don't make clear, I mixed the cinammon, cornstarch, splenda & lemon with the blueberries.  It was great!

Unlike others my pie concealed very nicely and didn't run, but I did wait over 2 hours before cutting into it.   

Best blueberry pie I ever ate!!!!

The pie was delicious. However, there oven temperature on the video and on the written recipe are different. I used a store bought pie shelf and 4 cups of blueberries was too much - the blueberries overflowed  during baking and made quite a mess. The pie was a hit with my guests but next time, I will use 3 cups of blueberries instead of 4!

This pie was exceptional!  I used 5 cups of freshly picked blueberries and increased the corn starch accordingly, as suggested by another reviewer.  I think the pie tasted better the second day, after it had been refrigerated, but it was delicious either way, especially served with vanilla ice cream!  This is now my go-to recipe for fresh blueberry pie!

I just made this today, it was my first ever lattice work crust. I did follow another reviewers advice, and upped the cornstarch to 5Tbsp, and added the juice of 1/2 a lemon. I'm very happy with the results. I would definitely recommend this recipe(with the modifications of course), and I plan on making it again..

I don’t like blueberry pie, but my fiancé does so I used this recipe for his birthday! I’d never made a blueberry pie before, and I was worried about it being runny, so I took the suggestion of others to use 4T of cornstarch instead of 3T. I also used 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup. It did turn out kind of runny (even after letting it sit for over an hour) but my fiancé said that it wasn’t a bad kind of runny

I should have read the review! Do not bake at 425 for 50 minutes and no to the lower rack. I was able to somewhat salvage. However it was not presentable.Should have trusted my gut  with my experience in other fruit pies I have made. You need to rewrite this recipe for temps and time....I was bragging about allrecipes just the other day that I can trust your recipes. Just bit my tongue. The basic ingredients are okay.

This pie is delicious. I didn't do a lattice top. I did a full coverage pie. I reduced the sugar amount to 1/4 cup because the fresh picked berries were sweet on their own. It's my boyfriend's favorite pie to eat. Needless to say, I ate 2 pieces, he ate the rest in less than 24 hrs. LOL.

This made a very runny pie, even after adding 2 extra tablespoons of corn starch as suggested. It was also a little too sweet for my taste.

Delicious and easy. After reading reviews I used 5 Tbsp of cornstarch and squeezed a small amount of lemon juice, less than a Tbsp.  Brushed the top lightly with milk and sprinkled with sugar. I had one Granny Smith Apple, so I sliced it and tossed it in. Many said the oven temp was too high, so I had it at 450 for about 25 minutes, then dropped it to 350. All ovens are different, so keep an eye on it.  This was soooo good! Will definitely make this again.

This was terrible. I wasted 4 cups of freshly picked blueberries. The temp was too high. Followed everything as stated in recipe. The pie filling was so runny I had to literally pour out the fluid to at least have the crust & blueberries. I read a few reviews before making - but not enough. The reviewers that successfully made this completely changed the ingredient amounts to a basically different recipe. Don't waste your blueberries when there are other more successful blueberry recipes.

I made this pie with frozen blueberries so I went with 5 Tbl of flour as another reviewer suggested and subbed coconut sugar for regular sugar. This was definitely a winner! Thanks so much!

I made a change as others had suggested. I used 5 Tbsp of cornstarch instead of 3. I also added a splash of lemon juice before adding all dry ingredients. With both of these changes the pie turned out great!.

good recipe with one exception - i used tapioca flour instead of cornstarch - it thickens much better in heat than corn starch - i doubled the amount of tapioca flour compared to cornstarch - the pie tastes the same but looks nicer

I used two 16-oz.. containers of fresh blueberries, sprinkled with lemon juice before adding sugar mixture, the stirred in a bit of lemon zest.  Baked in a large oblong pan (larger than 9x13) and used homemade crust in bottom, dotted berries with butter and topped with crust.  Sprinkled a bit of sugar on the crust.  I started baking at 400 for 20 minutes, then lowered temp to 350 until crust was brown and berries were bubbling.  This is a  very good, easy recipe.  Don't leave out the cinnamon; a very nice addition.

Terrific recipe and so easy, but it required some tweaking. I followed the recipe exactly the first time I made it, but found the mixture a little too runny and the crust slightly burnt. I made it again, using flash frozen wild blueberries, and half as much butter. For the last 20 minutes, I reduced the heat to 350 and covered the edges with tinfoil. I also let the pie cool for 4-5 hours before serving it, allowing the filling to properly set. That worked well for me and gave me the look and consistency I like. My family and I loved it! :D

220c for 50 minutes is way too much cooking time- 220c for 25 minutes cooks it alright but would definitely recommend taking the temperature down to 180 and then cooking for 40-50 minutes.

Pie burned on the edges at about 40 minutes. Probably could have either turned down the oven temperature or cooked on the middle rack instead to avoid it. Haven’t tasted yet but smells pretty good!

This is one of the best pies I have ever made.    It just gets better after it sits for a day or two.  I made this pie with close to 7 cups of blueberries and just added a little extra sugar, cornstarch,  and cinnamon to compensate .  I  used a good bit extra corn starch but next time would add  even more, although after it sat for a day it firmed up and was perfect.   I made the basic flaky pie crust recipe from the site  with half butter and half shortening and it is also the best piecrust I have ever made.   I can't say enough good things about this recipe..  my mom and I have enjoyed it for an entire week,  warmed up with vanilla ice cream, and it is just delicious. And it is really easy to make. This is a keeper

Super easy and loved this pie (especially with vanilla ice cream). I would add a bit more sugar however as the blueberries were still very tart (I used frozen).

This pie is soooooooooo good !!  I think next time I will add an additional tablespoon of  cornstarch.  The first piece I cut was a little juicy but then again I probably cut it way to early.  Great recipe, you won't regret it.

After preusing the first 20 or so 5 Star reviews, I used frozen berries & a squeeze of lemon.  The flavor was good but,  even after increasing corn starch to 4 tbsp, it was runny.  Also used a crumb topping another reviewer suggested.  It made the pie beautiful but disgustingly sweet. So, 5 tbsp corn starch and lattice top crust  will be tried next time. Lesson learned is to not only read 5 star reviews!

My girls wanted to make pies, and my husband requested blueberry! I used the pillsbury pie crusts that you buy in a box and unroll into the pie pan. I used frozen wild blueberries. It is delicious and super easy to make! I'm so excited!!! I made the recipe exactly like the directions said.

I lost my sister's favorite recipe and found this one for a "pinch-hit" at Thanksgiving.  Fabulous!  
I was using frozen berries & followed a reader review to increase cornstarch and add lemon (i added the zest & juice to taste).  This pie baked well at 400* and the filling set up perfectly for my tastes...not a gelatinous slab nor a runny mess.  It held together well for serving, but was  loose enough to invite you to dig in before the hostess was seated! 
I plan to make this MY  favorite  pie recipe.

Really enjoyed this. I've made many fruit pies before it never blueberry. For those who worry about the pie setting up, use a 1/4 cup of tapioca in place of the cornstarch. Let it sit 15 minutes all mixed together then pour into crust and cook normally. It changed everything for me when I discovered this. It makes all the difference. Never had a runny pie since and don't worry the tapioca doesn't change the taste at all!

Look for another recipe. The blueberries mixture didn't gel on the 2nd and 3rd try, and I used 50% more corn starch and 100% more corn starch.  Go instead with a recipe where you cook and thicken the blueberry mixture first.  Use this recipe and you'll end up with a soggy pie shell full of blueberry soup.  I wish to heck I'd have known this before I wasted $56 on blueberries and a half day baking these failed pies.

I made the recipe, I'm looking forward to trying it. The first time it was burnt. 425 for 50 minutes is too long. The second time I just did 400 for 25 minutes, and that looks right.

I did not use this  specific recipe. My pie was runny and the blueberries (which were frozen and thawed) were tough. I did add flour and sugar, butter and lemon. Disappointing.

This has to be one of the easiest deserts I have ever made.  I did use a store purchased fresh pasty shell but that said the entire prep time was about 10 minutes including a lattice top crust. My only suggestion however would be to use 5 or 6 cups of blueberries as 4 did not seem to be enough. It was delicious in any case.

Loved it. Just made a few changes. I used 5 C of blueberries and 4 T of Cornstarch. I baked at 375 on the middle rack.  I covered the edges of the crust  while baking and removed the cover with 15 minutes left of baking time.

My husband said this was the "BEST BLUEBERRY PIE I've EVER had". Let me put his statement into context: I'm a horrible food preparer (can't even call myself a "cook").  Thus, if I can do this, WOW! What more can be said!!

Great recipe! I've used it for years. One of my favorites to make when we have a family get together and I don't have a lot of time to make a time consuming dessert with everything else I'm preparing. I am a farm girl raised by a really great country baker. This pie is worthy of something my grandmother would have made but she would not have cared if it was runny or not. She also would not have measured any of these ingredients. 
Everyone has different advice on the cornstarch and the sugar. It's really personal preference how thick or how thin you want the pie filling or how sweet you like it. If you are using 4 cups berries then 4 TBSP cornstarch. Forget the tapioca suggestions. Cinnamon and lemon juice really brightens the flavor of the berries. I used 5 cups fresh berries, 2 Tbsp lemon juice(this was 1/2 lemon), 4 heaping TBSP cornstarch, pinch of salt and 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 cup brown sugar. 1/4 cup white sugar and the zest of half the lemon. 
I have used white sugar, 1/2 white and 1/2 brown mixture and Truvia. I liked the white and brown mixture the best with 1/2 to 3/4 cup sugar total. I eyeball the berries and add enough to cover tartness. 
Sort through berries to check for stems and wash. Mix all dry ingredients and dump in with berries. Add lemon juice. Stir and pour in bottom pie crust.
Crust - I like to make my own crust but have also cheated;) with Pet Ritz deep dish pie crust. They are easy and delicious. Turn the top crust upside down on wax paper while you a

Loved this! Not overly sweet. I used the exact amount of ingredients indicated for the filling, but after 20 minutes, I turned the oven down to 375F, which helped the filling set. I also waited 6 hours to cut into the pie. It set perfectly, without any extra cornstarch. I also used an eggwash on my crust to make it more golden brown and added a bit of course sugar on top.

This is the best blueberry pie ever! I baked at 425 degrees for 15 minutes and 375 degrees for about 25 minutes.  You have to keep your eye on ithe pie as it bakes, since every oven is different.  I also added 5 cups of blueberries and 4 tablespoons of corn starch.  Since I increased the amount of blueberries, I added a bit more sugar.  Yum!

This recipe was awesome. I did follow another raters suggestion and added 5 tbsp of corn starch for thickening. I modified the recipe to make it gluten free and vegan by substituting gluten free flour and an egg substitute. I set my oven at 400 degrees and cooked an additional 10 minutes. This pie is now a family favorite.

I found  it better to turn the heat back to 375 after 30 minutes, after the bottom crust was cooked.  Also brushed the bottom crust with a little egg white to prevent a soggy crust.  Read that somewhere and it works.  I used frozen wild Ontario blueberries and it was fine.

This blueberry pie was excellent! Thank you so much for sharing the recipe! I used 4 tablespoons cornstarch and used 1/2 a small lemon for zest, then used the juice from the half lemon. I did not cut the pie until the following morning. It set up perfect! I baked 425* for 15 minutes, then turned down to 325* for about 30 to 45 minutes. I also put tin foil around the crust which always works out good for me. Yum!!

A very nice pie but after reading reviews  like others I changed the blueberries to 4 1/2 cups, the sugar was 11/2 cups and the cornstarch 4 Tbsp. I added the cinnamon thinking I wouldn't like it. The pie was perfect. Not too sweet, great consistency with a very subtle cinnamon taste.

Fantastic! I made a couple of adjustments to make it more to my liking. I increased the corn starch to 5 table spoons, the blueberries to 5 cups, and the sugar to 1 cup. I added a splash of vanilla and almond extract. As well, I added the zest and juice of half a lemon.
This was the best blueberry pie I have ever had. I'll be making this one again!

Made as written (except the latice crust) and it was exactly what I hoped for. Received several compliments and had no leftovers.

We don't make blueberry pie often, but I would make this again. Next time I think that I will try increasing the ingredients by 25% so the pie has more filling.

Absolutely scrumptious recipe!  Used 5 Tbsp cornstarch and added juice from 1/2 a lemon.   Took longer to cook than the recipe  called for (maybe  15 extra minutes).  Was not runny.  Will definitely make it again!

Yum! Made my usual recipe for pie crust, adding a quarter cup of vanilla sugar, but otherwise followed the recipe for the fruit, assembly, and baking. Only baked 45 minutes and I could have taken it out a little earlier, but it was fine. Was a big hit and will definitely make it again.

I used larger highbush blueberries, a frozen crust with no lattice top, and added some lemon juice, so I increased the corn starch to 5T. Baked at 375 for an hour. My pie was so delicious that we were practically licking the plates clean. Thank you for the great recipe!

This was my first time making blueberry pie, and  latticing a crust. I thought the recipe was super easy and I WILL be making it again!! My family loved it and requested it for the holidays!! The only change I made was adding the extra corn starch. I used 4 tablespoons. This is a keeper!!

I made this using 3 T tapioca instead of cornstarch...turned out excellent!  Also sprinkle crust with coarse sugar after you brush with egg wash.

I used large, sweet, frozen blueberries for this recipe so I adjusted the cornstarch to 4 Tbsp. That's the only alteration I made to the recipe itself and this pie turned out delectably perfect! The pie set up perfectly. It wasn't runny nor rubbery. It didn't fall apart when cut either. I used a regular pie dish (not deep dish) and decided to keep it simple and use some pillsbury pie pastries for the crusts. I brushed an egg wash on the bottom crust to make sure it didn't get soggy. Then I brushed the top crust with milk and sprinkled with sugar. I covered the edges with foil and baked at 375 for 45 minutes, then increased to 425 for the last 15 minutes to let the top brown adequately (foil was on the entire time and it still browned nicely). I made mine the night before going to a 4th of July party to ensure it set up well and didn't make a mess in the car. I couldn't be more pleased! P.S. It would've been 5 stars had I not needed to adjust the recipe for frozen/large berries. I'm a big believer in not giving 5 stars if the thing you made wasn't exactly according to the recipe.

Great recipe. Added some lemon for a little tangy taste. If you add lemon, add a little extra starch so the filling doesn't get so runny. 45 minutes in the oven should do it.

This recipe is severely lacking any sense of technique or sense of taste. It is way too salty, and tasted like cornstarch. I made it again today,  omitting the salt,  reducing the cornstarch to 2 Tbsp, and cooked the starch  with 1 cup of the blueberries, sugar and 2-3 Tbsp of water.  Then added the butter, cinnamon, 1/4 tsp lemon extract, cooled a little, and then added the  and rest of berries.  It was so much better.  I, of course,  use Martha Stewart's pate brisee. It is the best pie crust.

Great recipe!  I followed to a T....turned out perfect.  If you can use fresh use them....the frozen ones are too watery and the pie will be soupy.....Will make again for sure..

I just made this pie for the first time, and all I can say is WOW! My husband and his father were going crazy over this recipe! The only changes I made to the recipe was to use 5T corn starch instead of 3, and use 1 cup of sugar instead of 3/4. I also reduced baking temperature to 375. Will definitely be making again!

I'm late in the game with reviewing but this is the best recipe I have ever found for a blueberry pie. I followed the instructions of one of the top reviews and every single time it comes out perfectly, I have gotten so many compliments every time I bake this! I would highly recommend for any type of family outing or get together ( or just a late night snack :-))

Teriffic pie, delicious.  Using ripe blueberries is a must, if possible buy and keep for a few days.  I also like pouring the blueberry mixture into a pan and cooking at a low heat with a few tablespoons of butter for 2 minutes.  This helps to get it super juicy and well blended.  This is definitely a family favorite!!

Agree with the others-  425 is too hot! It'll burn the crust. I also added a little lemon juice, extra sugar, butter, and cornstarch. I lowered the temperature to 400, but next time, I want to put foil over the edges of the crust to prevent burning.

The use of freshly picked blueberries made this the best blueberry pie I have ever tasted. Plus, it was easy to make because I used the rollable Pillsbury pie crust.

After reading  many of the reviews, I increased the corn starch to 4 tablespoons,  added 1 tablespoon of fresh squeezed lemon juice and two teaspoons of lemon zest. I baked on 400 for 30 minutes and increased the  temp to 425 for the last 25 minutes. I let it cool for  4 hours before cutting.  It was absolutely perfect!

I followed the reviews in the starch amount. Added half a lemon juice and lemon zest. Turned out very tasty. Baked it at 375 for an hour but next time going to try 400. Overall very good.

Thought this recipe was great!  Only made it once, and the only thing I would change for next time is lowering the heat a little (I'll try 25 degrees) and covering the pie with foil for the first half of baking.  My top and edges got a little burnt, but the bottom was perfect.
Some said it was too runny - maybe try letting the berries sitting for a bit in the flour mixture before baking to absorb some juices?  Also, make sure you start with clean but dry fresh berries (I could see frozen berries becoming a mess). I mixed mine all together, then it sat while I rolled out the pie crust.  Also, let the pie sit for a bit before cutting into it.  We didn't get to ours until it had completely cooled and it was perfect - juicy but not at all a "runny mess".

Delicious BUT I would not sprinkle the sugar mix next time. I think gently mixing it with the berries would be better.

Delicious! I read through reviews and did the 5 tablespoons of starch modification so frequently recommended, but I used arrowroot powder instead of cornstarch. I have never had a problem subbing it 1:1 before, but this came out a smidge TOO thick. Next time(there will DEFINITELY be a next time) I'll  just use 4 tablespoons. I subbed coconut oil for the butter to make this recipe dairy-free, and made it with the Coconut Oil Pie Crust from Minimalist Baker blog. Perfect!

I added a drop of orange and almond flavorings and swapped a cup of blueberries for a cup of blackberries. I also added a granola topping. Quite yummy!!!

We loved it... it was easy to make and with fresh blueberries turned out amazing. We did add the extra cornstarch and lemon juice as suggested by others which made it  perfect. My daughter enjoyed so much we're making another this weekend!

I use a Tenderflake pie crust for the bottom, and create the lattice using a Pillsbury roll out crust, and a pizza cutter, to make the strips!  I used fresh blueberries, and this pie was an absolute hit at at family dinner!

It had good flavor however the amount of cornstarch listed is way too low.  Even after cooling for several hours it did not thicken at all.  My bottom crust was totally soggy from all the juice.  It really needs 5 or 6 TBSP of cornstarch to thicken up properly.  I added a strudel top instead of the lattice crust.  It was a good pairing with the blueberries.  Disappointing that it didn't set up but I will still eat it!

I'll give it 4 out of 5 only because it needed tweaking,I made it without reading any reviews first (never do that again lol) and it came out soupy and I thought about adding more cornstarch but didn't ,I did use fresh blueberries and a pillsbury crust ,and a solid top vs lattice,I used 5 cups of berries and 1 cup of sugar,also I brushed the top crust with water and sprinkled sugar on it .. next time I'll add more cornstarch and lemon like others did ,and I think 375 would work better for my oven

I made this pie and it looked great till I cut into it. What a mess.The center never firmed up.I ended up pouring the juice out and trying to salvage the pie.Will never make this again.If I have to rate it would give it 1 star but it doesn't deserve it.

Delicious, easy to make recipe, especially when using pre made refrigerated pie dough.    I used 5 tablespoons of potato starch as recommended by other reviewers.  It helped to keep the filling from being runny.  I may try 6 tablespoons of potato starch next time.   I used less sugar, 1/2 cup, which was plenty sweet.  We added vanilla bean ice cream to our pie slices,  yummm.

Actually I can't review it because I haven't tasted it yet.  I also follow recipes the first time to a "t" and make adjustment thereafter.  Unfortunately I only had frozen blueberries so I hope it's not too syrupy.  Will update later.  Not too bad excepting I used store bought pastry which I didn't find too yummy.  My bad!

Recipe is GREAT AS IS, although I, as many others, have made a few tweaks.  For those complaining of a runny filling, the pie must sit a good long time after baking to fully set... otherwise yes it will be soupy.  But it's worth the wait!!  My favorite tweak is just to add the juice and zest from half a lime to the blueberries.  Blue/lime is heavenly!

I use 5 Tab. Of cornstarch, but I used Stevia instead of sugar.  I cooked it at 400 degrees for 50 minutes.  Perfect pie!  I love it, it was my first blueberry pie!  I will be cooking this for sure again soon!

First pie ever - used 5tbs cornstarch but did not add lemon juice. Cooked at 400 degrees for one hour and covered the edges with foil after 35 minutes. I used a 5 star ranked pastry pie crust recipe from this site, too. My family LOVED it.

The lower oven temperature definitely helped. I put it at 400 degrees. This change allows it to bake straight through without the crust getting burnt in the process. I wold definitely recommend some vanilla bean ice cream with it and I like using freshly picked berries

It came out perfectly!  I followed the recipe exactly as this was my first blueberry pie and I am not a good baker. I loosely covered the whole top with foil 1/2 way through. It tasted delicious and held together perfectly, and was not runny in the least. Used fresh handpicked blueberries and could not be happier or prouder. Thanks!

Excellent.   I did add 5 T of cornstarch,, which seems just right, and the 1 T of lemon juice. 
However, I baked at 425 and 45 minutes was a little too long, crust a little browner than I would have liked. (MIddle rack).

But no soggy bottom crust!

I made this pie exactly as the recipe instructed.  I spent a couple of hours making the crust, rolling it out, compiling and mixing the ingredients, cleaning the bowls and tools, along with baking time.  This was a pie I was baking as a birthday gift.  The pie filling NEVER set and the pie crust begins to burn at the recommended high temperature.  Why is this pie even featured?  What a waste of money and time.  The blueberries were quite expensive and my labor of love became a laborious nightmare of which I didn't have the time to remake and alter.  Thanks a lot!

I make this recipe all the time. You don't bake it at 425 for 50 minutes. Your suppose to preheat your oven at 425 for 10 minutes, then bake the pie for 10 minutes at 425 then turn down to 350 and bake for 50 minutes. When the filling is bubbling it's done.  I cut a whole in a piece of  foil to cover edges and remove it about 20 minutes before it's done.

Made this recipe using fresh Maine blueberries. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1 extra tbsp of cornstarch—with regret. Unless you enjoy jam like pie, I'd leave the cornstarch as-is and give the pie appropriate amount of time to set up. Sugar can easily be reduced to 1/2 cup.

The pie is  so easy to make and it is quite delicious. I have made two in the past week .  I used fresh blueberries and a total of four tbs of cornstarch. I also added juice from half a lemon and grate a little bit of rind into the pie.   The consistency is perfect  after allowing it to sit on the counter for about four hours.

Did not like this recipe at all. Sugar was still granule after cooking,crust wasn't cooked enough. Seemed to need a lot more time in oven. Very disappointed.  Bad. Gave it one star because I couldn't submit this without giving it one.

So very simple and delicious! I made this recipe with my 3 year old because he had been asking for a blueberry pie. Neither my husband or I are big fans of fruit pie, but this is so yummy and fresh! I made the crust from scratch as well which makes a big difference.

Based on reviews, I increased the berries by 1/2 cup (because I love a deeper pie) & increased the cornstarch to 4 T.  I also added the zest of 1 small lemon and juice from 1/2 of small lemon (about 1 T).  I have always baked my fruit pies at 425 degrees for 15 min then decrease to 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  I did this and it worked perfectly.  (I use a tin crust protector.)  I also waited 2 hours before serving and it was PERFECT!  Not too sweet, not runny (but not dry).  It was heavenly with a dollop of vanilla ice cream.  I served this at a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  I used the no-roll pie crust on Allrecipes, which is easy and mistake-proof.

I made it for the first time, but also made a few changes that were made by other reviewers.  I put in 5 Tbsp of cornstarch, 1 cup of sugar, 2 Tbsp fresh lemon juice.  The instructions said to let it set for 1 hour, it needs more time than that.  I would recommend if you want it for supper, make it that morning or the day before

I read several reviews before baking.  I went with 5 cups of blueberries, 1 cup of sugar and 4 T. cornstarch.  My pie  turned out a bit runny, but I really liked the flavor. I definitely had to cook it longer than 50 minutes.  Next time I would try the 5 T. Cornstarch and see if that thickens it up more.

The recipe calls to sprinkle the berries with the mixture, then pour into pie crust. I tossed to coat and still had a lot of the mixture on top of the berries when the timer went off. Had to mix into the baked pie and reset the timer. I also sprinkled with lemon juice. Tastes but very runny.  I may try again, but will cook on stove top to thicken a bit first

One word- Delicious! Only thing changed was I did 5  Tbsp cornstarch and added about 1.5tsp lemon juice. I also let the berry mixture sit while I made the crust, therefore by time i was ready to fill my pie it was sitting in about 1/4c liquid which I did not add.  (I think by letting it sit and release some liquid ahead of time it helps with the pie not being soggy) 

Cooked at 400 for 50 mins and covered with foil the last 15 mins.  This was a great pie!

I followed the "most helpful positive review." I won't recite the recommended changes, but the pie comes out perfect every time. Also, I don't bother with the lattice top. Mine ends up looking like a Pinterest fail. For the pie crust, I use the "basic flaky pie crust" recipe found on Allrecipes.com.

Yes this was my first pie! I read the reviews and used the suggestion to add 1 1/4 c sugar and add more cornstarch. it was to sweet for me. I think you need to taste your berries and use that as a guide. I used 5 pints berries and it was stuffed. it was amazing

This came out yummy! I will say that I read the other reviews before making and made a few suggested alterations. First I used 5 tblspns of corn starch (though 2 hrs after taking from the oven it's still very funny, so I probably should have gone with 6 tblspns), I increased the sugar to 1 cup (my fresh berries were a bit tart) and lowered the cooking temp to 400.

It was very very tasty!  I added an extra tablespoon of cornstarch (4 tbsp) due to the reviews.  It was very very runny, almost like blueberry soup!  But it was really tasty!  I may add yet another tbsp of cornstarch to firm it up.

My first time making blueberry pie! I used huge fresh picked blueberries from a local u pick farm, so I took the suggestions from other reviews and used extra corn starch, close to 5tbs. It turned out fantastic. Not too goopy, and very tasty! I will be using this recipe again!

There is almost no quicker pie to make than a blueberry pie, and the results using this recipe with a few minor changes makes it world class.  There is no peeling, no pitting, no seeds of any kind to deal with in a blueberry pie.  This is a lovely pie, but I made the following alterations:  Rather than measure the blueberries, a 24 oz. container of berries is the exact amount needed.  I added the juice of half a large lemon to the berries.  I rounded the sugar measuring cup to counter the lemon, used 3/4 tsp. of cinnamon, and I used 5 slightly rounded tablespoons of cornstarch.  I brushed the top of the pie with an egg whisked with 1 tsp of water for a nice shine.  I baked it for about 1 hour at 375 in the middle of the oven.  I like my crusts  toastier than some may, and 375 achieves this without "burning" the edges, and it allows the filling to  reach a nice bubbling boil inside at exactly the moment the crust is perfectly and evenly brown.  Spectacular with or without a scoop of ice cream!

7.3.16  Now I know why this recipe has been rated so highly by so many...it's simply good.  Read the reviewers' comments abut this pie being runny, so I did add in a tablespoon of tapioca in addition to the flour. Gave this just a sprinkle of cinnamon, and baked for 55 minutes @ 375°F.  And to top it off, it's quick and easy!! ****UPDATE 5.30.19  Overbaked today at 50 minutes, so in the future,  I'll start checking at 45 minutes.  But still so darn easy and so darn good!

I followed directions as noted and read several reviews.  Decided to add a bit of lemon juice.  I used fresh small blue berries so the 3TBS cornstarch worked.  I lowered to 375 and baked for an hour and lined the edges when I saw that they were browning too quickly.   I used the lattice top and I baked it in a square cake pan.   It came out wonderful.   The best part about this recipe is that you can adjust the sugar based on preference.  I used Xylotol in place of sugar and it worked great.

The middle was PERFECT, although the edges were burned because the recipe  did not say to put foil around the edges.

Delicious & not too sweet! Followed others' advice and used 5c fresh picked blueberries (the larger variety), 4Tbsp cornstarch, 2Tbsp fresh lemon juice, 1/2c sugar and baked at 400 degrees with no top for about 45 minutes. Served with vanilla whip cream.

Great basic pie. I added an extra cup of blueberries, two additional T of cornstarch, and juice of a lemon.  Used an egg and cream wash, then sprinkled with sugar prior to baking.   Baked in middle rack at 400.  Perfect.

These Best Pie Ever - made exactly as indicated in the recipe, it is delicious. I can't make enough of them- they get gobbled up right away. Hubby buys fresh blueberries and leaves them on the counter as a hint he would LOVE me to make this pie for him. The recipe is so simple, he now makes it himself. The cinnamon in the recipe is an unexpected, delicious suprprise.
We make this pie as soon as bluberry season starts and do not stop until it ends. Highly recommend.

A good pie, easy to make and tasty.  I used 4 tbs of cornstarch which I thought for the 4 cups of berries would be sufficient based on other reviews. It came out with more liquid not firming up.  Next time, a time for improvement.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made it as written and it was fantastic.  The second time I made it… I used 4 T of cornstarch (to make it a little less runny which is a personal preference and has been mentioned by others), and I added 1 T of lemon juice to the blueberries, and placed pats of butter (1-2 T total) on top of blueberries prior to covering it with the pie lid.  Fabulous.  I also make my own crust.  With or without the changes… this is a GREAT recipe!!!!!

Yum! This was just delicious, even with frozen blueberries and Walmart frozen deep dish pie crust. I used about 4-1/2 cups of blueberries. I followed others' suggestions and increased cornstarch to 5 T, but I will cut that back to 4 next time unless serving just after baking; we ate it the next day and it was a little TOO neat, even unrefrigerated. (It wasn't rubbery or anything, but then again I had added a splash of water and 2 T fresh lemon juice as someone else suggested. Plus, before serving, we microwaved each piece for 25 sec. and topped it with vanilla ice cream.) I just like my blueberry pie a little bit looser - almost runny and messy! Next time I'll leave out the cinnamon too. 
I recommend the frozen pie crust (put it in your own plate) and making it as a double crust pie; just cut a few slits in the top crust and that beautiful blue will come bursting out!  
I baked it on a cookie sheet (just in case it bubbled over) at 375 for about an hour with the crust covered the whole time. I can hardly wait to make it again!

This was excellent! I used Trader Joe's pie crusts. The only changes I made were I added the juice of a fresh lemon and 5 TB of cornstarch. Absolutely delicious and I usually don't even like blueberry pie!

This was perfect! It was my first try with a blueberry pie and second try with pies in general. I just added a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice , adjusted the oven to minimum and gradually increased it, but at no point was it ever beyond 165 c° because I used a graham crackers ready pie crust and didn't want to burn it. Next time i might try it with brown sugar instead of white..

After I took some of the suggestions from previous reviewers, this pie was a success! Not too sweet, which is great! I love when fruit pies speak for themselves. 

The changes I made:

4 Tbsp. Arrowroot powder (works the same as cornstarch)
1 Tbsp. lemon juice
400F with the edges covered in tinfoil for approx. 45 minutes.
Cooled completely on the counter, then in the fridge overnight. 

It set perfectly and was a delicious treat for my Husband's coworkers! :-)

I will most definitely make it again! I added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 2 more tablespoons of cornstarch. The pie set beautifully!! My fiancé doesn't like blueberries but he loved this pie :)

I must be to blame after seeing all these good reviews. I think my blackberries weren't sweet or something,  but it did not turn out well at all.  :( so sad because I love black berry cobbler.

Easy to make and delicious. My neighbor even asked for the recipe because she loved it too. We made with blueberries ripe from our backyard and did not find it to be tart at all. I used a pre-made pie crust and did lattice top.

My husband said this was one of my best pies ever.  After reading the reviews,  I used 5 c. of blueberries and 4 T cornstarch.  I also baked it at 400 for an hour and it turned out perfectly.  Easy and Delicious!

It's gone. Everyone loved this pie. I used fresh blueberries, the vodka pie crust with a lattice top, adding 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/8th cup of lemon juice. Cooked it on the middle rack. Wrapped the edge in tin foil for most of the cooking time. Cut it while still warm about 1 1/2 hours after cooking. Served with vanilla ice cream. People went back for more and now its gone.

Exceptional!  Not too sweet, chocked full of berries & none of the gooey stuff that usually holds pies together.  Plus my top and bottom crusts came out perfectly crunchy =)

Excellent! The taste was amazing. I do wish I would have read the reviews, definitely needed more cornstarch. It was runny. I will add more next time. Not bad for my first time.

This is the best blueberry pie we have ever had!  I made it as the recipe outlined the first time and it was a runny mess.  After reading the reviews, I also used 1TBSP lemon juice, 5TBSP (total) of cornstarch and I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup because we like to use less sugar generally.  I baked at 375 and also covered the edges until the final 15 minutes.  Pie perfection!

Okay, in fairness, this pie did taste very good. I increased my berries to 5 c., increased my cornstarch to 4 1/2 Tb., used a dash of lemon juice instead of salt, added some nutmeg and it was STILL runny. I'm going to make it again this weekend with more cornstarch, leaving the rest of the things I did the same and we'll see. At this point, it's hardly my go-to blueberry pie recipe.

Great pie, not overpoweringly sweet.  I subbed previously frozen huckleberries that I picked last summer.  I did thaw and drain, drain, drain the berries.  I would imagine commercially frozen/purchased berries would have a bit less liquid.  At any rate, other than subbing out a different berry, I added 4T cornstarch, based on other reviews.  I will say that on Day 2, there was still some "ooze" into the pie plate after I dished up a slice.  But on Day 3, it had set up perfectly and the liquid from the remaining pie didn't seep into the open space.  Now I know that if I use 4T cornstarch, I should make my pie at least 2 days in advance to give it time to set up.

Yes instead of using 3 tbsp of starch try using 1. Tbsp. Of corn starch and 2 tbsp of low sugar pectin to preserve the full flavor of the blueberries and not have the starchy flavor will still be juicy but make a firm pie

This pie was the consistency of soup. I made it with one Tblsp of corn starch per cup of blueberries and baked as directed. It tasted fine, but had to be eaten in a bowl with a spoon. Very disappointing.

The flavor of this pie was great; just enough sweet without being too sweet. Super easy recipe. My family loved it! My only complaint is how runny the pie turned out, even after adjusting the cornstarch to 5 tablespoons and letting it set in the refrigerator overnight.

Just pulled my version out of the oven on 5/20/2105*  Did not have 4 whole cups, but with a cup of blackberries, did have 3 cups blue & Blackberries. So these are my tweaks: 1/3 cup sugar, 2 tbls cornstarch, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, added lemon juice. Remembered the butter pats this time & did a lattice crust using Grandma Ruth's pie crusts! We are at 6,500 ft above sea level.  I preheated my cookie sheet in the 425 oven, then slid the pie in on it, 10 min, turned down to 350, last 10 min. foil around edges, it IS PERFECT*!*

Excellent pie and so easy to make!.  I took the advice of others and used  the 5 Tbsp of corn starch and it set up beautifully.  I also used frozen blueberries and had no problems, I just rinsed them off first.  I used Pillsbury pre-made pie crust.  I will be making this again!

Blueberry Pie is my husband's favorite, however we do not eat many desserts.  I made this for his birthday in 2010 and again in 2014.  My first attempt looked beautiful, but was a little too 'juicy' - yet my second attempt was a home run.  The first time I made this I used blueberries that had been previously frozen, the second time I used fresh blueberries (not frozen).  I believe that was the difference in that the frozen blueberries had retained more water.

Hubby wanted blueberry pie. I only had about 3.5 cups of blueberries, so I substituted FRESH FIGS. It was perfect. The blueberries colored and flavored the figs so that they were indistinguishable. Since I made a top crust instead of a lattice, I turned the heat back to 400 and only cooked about 40 minutes. Delicious! Hubby was very happy.

Changes to make to ensure the pie works well - which are actually a different recipe: 5 cups blueberries, 3 TBSP flour and 1/2 tsp cinnamon or 2tsp of grated lemon peel.  Let is cool before cutting into it and there will be no problem with it setting.

AWESOME! I baked it at 375 for 50 minutes in the middle rack, used 5 tablespoons as recommended by others. I even messed up by sprinkling the mixture overtop the blueberries instead of throughout; once i realized my error (it was already baked for the full time) i took a fork and kind of swooshed the powder mix through the liquid through the lattice and it turned out fine. It was runny until i cooled it and refrigerated it for a few hours.

Taste more like  an apple pie than a blueberry pie.  I wouldn't put the cinnamon.  But very easy to make.

I made this yesterday with a few twists and it turned out awesome! Especially because it was my first ever completely scratch made pie! I followed everyone's recommendations and upped the cornstarch to  4 tbs and double the cinnamon too. I have always really enjoyed blueberries and dark chocolate together (why should strawberries have all the fun?)  soI roughly chopped 4oz of 70% dark chocolate and folded it into the blueberry mixture. I let it sit overnight in the fridge after baking because the chocolate and blueberry juice looked like a hot soupy mess.Once, cooled, the chocolate helped hold all the filling together and the combination of the blueberry, cinnamon, and dark chocolate flavors was unexpectedly delicious and balanced! Give it a try sometime :)

The pie was extremely runny.  I used 4 tbsp. of corn starch and it didn't make a difference.  Additionally the blueberries never opened up so all the sugar was in some syrup outside of the berries which made the "pie" overall too sweet and the berries themselves not sweet at all. \.

I made this pie exactly as the directions called for. It was good but it wasn't sweet enough. I made another one & I added 1 cup of sugar & vanilla flavor. It was very good, especially with vanilla ice cream. I will definitely use this blueberry pie recipe again.

The most simple, perfect recipe.  Followed directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  I used fresh picked blueberries that I froze the night before - a small, tart variety perfect for baking.

I made this pie for my husband's birthday & it is the best blueberry pie we have ever had.  A friend of mine had 2 slices!  I used 1/2 fresh blueberries & 1/2 frozen blueberries.  I also used about 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.  I thickened it with 3 Tblsp. Cornstarch & 3 Tblsp. Of flour.  I will make this pie over & over!  As my daughter said, "An Epic Pie"!

Really, really good. My husband is the fruit pie lover and he REALLY liked this one. And my daughter and I, who are not fans of blueberries or fruit pies, even thought it was delicious! I used a little over 4 cups of frozen berries and increased the corn starch to 4 1/2 tbsp (it seemed to be the most consistent reviewer recommendation) -- and it turned out wonderfully. It did get a little too dark around the edges (even with the foil) but I'll just play around with that -- it doesn't affect my review :)

Not sure what happened but this did NOT set up properly, even after adding in 5tbs of cornstarch instead of 3 as the reviews suggested. It did taste good. 
I tried making this again but this time, I cooked the blueberries along w/ the cornstarch, sugar etc just until the blueberries started to release their juices and the dry ingredients were wet and coated the berries. I then put in to a pie shell etc etc and baked it for around 50 or so minutes and it turned out MUCH better this time. Gooey like it should be, not soupy.

I gave this 4 stars due to the recipe changes and it was just a very good classic blueberry pie. I used frozen (thawed & drained) blueberries so fresh blueberries probably would improve it.  I feel like 5 - 6 cups of blueberries would have been a better amount of filling. Per other recommendations, I used 5 Tbs of cornstarch, added 2 T lemon juice, and lowered the temperature to 375. Overall, it's still a thumbs up, easy and tasty recipe.

Everyone in the family loved this pie! My grandmother is a stickler for blueberry pies, and this one passed the test. The idea to add the butter to the top was genius, it really made a difference. If you're using blueberry pie filling from the can, you can still make the sugar mixture and sprinkle a little bit of it on top. It's an amazing pie.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving for the first time best ever! I change a few things I added 5 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 3.I also added 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. I used 1 canned Blueberry's taste so good my family just loved it. I will be making this pie again . By the way I made my own pie crust came out perfect! Don't like frozen pie crust they don't have the same taste of home made crust! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was great! I wasn't completely sure about at first when I started making it, but seeing as it was my very first fruit pie, I wasn't quite sure what to expect anyway. It was so good and the cinnamon was a great touch. I made the recipe as is with no alterations and it was phenominal!!

This pie is easy, quick, inexpensive and of course, tastes amazing. My father, husband and daughter are blueberry fanatics and they prefer this pie to cake on their birthdays. 
Ive made this pie quite a few times and the only variation Ive done is that I now like to use 1 pound of frozen, wild blueberries because we prefer the taste. 
I also buy your run of the mill deep dish pie crust in the frozen section in the grocery store. They usually come with two per package and I let them thaw. Use one for the filling and cut the other into shapes or strips for the lattice. Im too lazy to make my own pie crust!We top with light whipped cream. Really glad I discovered this recipe!

This pie was very nicely flavored, but did not set up for me(and I even used extra cornstarch). Next time I will be sure to use wild blueberries, and definitely not frozen ones(I used half frozen and half fresh blueberries from a local pick-your-own farm).

I made this just as written with the exception of not latticing the top crust.  We thought it was excellent and absolutely perfect with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  My husband would prefer it a bit sweeter so I would add another 1/4 cup of sugar next time.

The blueberry filling is amazing except the crust on the bottom got too wet so it all fell apart and i couldnt scoop it out nice.

made this in a 13" deep dish pie pan and used about 3 pints of wild blueberries, I kept everything pretty much the same except I made it with one cup of sugar and 5 tablespoons of cornstarch (as it was a 13" pan and was about 2" thick, the increase in blueberries needed the extra cornstarch and sugar). Also went with the Crisco Lard pie crust recipe that's on the packet and man, it was thee best pie I've ever had, soo so good.

A little tart as some said, but still nice and sweet. I might add you should cover your edges as they brown, and also I might add an egg wash and sugar to the top next time. Doesn't get much easier than this!

This is a fabulous pie! It's beyond simple, and the only thing I changed after reading other people's comments was to add a bit of extra cornstarch.

After 32 years of marriage and trying many times to make a blueberry pie for my husband, this one completed the task.  I made the recipe just as listed and it came out great.  My husband said that this was the blueberry pie that he had hoped for all of these years.

Awesome! I used half sugar and half stevia and used fresh blueberries. It was over done so I will reduce heat to 375 as suggested by others and a little runny but not bad at all. My hubby thought it was too sweet so next time I make it I will reduce the sugar and stevia to 1/4 c. each.

It's cooling in the fridge. 
I added 5 tablespoons cornstarch as was suggested and let it cool in the fridge because we want to have to tonight. After about a couple of hours we took a couple of little slices to "test" :-) Simply delicious!! I have never baked a pie and I will never buy another one.

Best. Pie. Ever.  
I made this using Grandma's secret pie crust from allrecipes.com, left out the butter, and did a regular crust on top.  I will never consider buying blueberry pie out ever again.

Excellent! I used 4 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch and used a store-bought dough and it turned out excellent. Not too runny and not too rubber tasting. I cooked it at 400 and within 30 min I needed to cover the edges with foil.

Im making my 2nd pie now and keeping my fingers crossed that it isn't a runny mess this time.  On my first attempt the pie was way too runny and the crust browned too quickly.  This time I added an extra tablespoon of corn starch and a splash of lemon.  I also reduced the oven to 375 and will keep baking it untilI i see it bubbling....it tasted fine  but it was a disappointing mess. Hoping for the best now that I made some crucial adjustments.

Very simple and delicious! I made this with blueberries we picked ourselves that day.  I let the pie sit overnight to gel completely.  I had a slice for breakfast and it was so delicious!  I will make this one again!  :)

I used this recipe and substituted Splenda for the sugar and skipped the butter.  It was awesome.  It is a huge favorite for my family.  Note, I also tried this same recipe using strawberries - delish and apples - awesome!

I made this and used the recipe because of all the 4 and 5 star reviews. While it's in the oven I read the reviews. The increased corn starch is crucial. Now I have a soupy pie.

I tweeked it though based on comments, I did this instead; 4 tbsp conrstarch, 2 tbsp all purpose flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 5 cupsa fruit. Mix the dry ingredients then add the fruit and toss for several minutes. I made 4" sweet tarts and covered them with more pie dough (I used Best Ever Pie Crust II) This works great for any frozen fruit, raspberry, strawberry and blueberry. Trust me when I say we SOLD OUT everytime lol.

It tasted great, but it did not set right. I'll keep retrying with tweaks to the recipe and update with a new review.

This recipe is so simple. I made it using strawberries instead because my fiance mentioned he'd never seen a strawberry pie before.
Turned out delicious. Definately add the extra corntstarch like suggested by other reviews. I used 6 tblsp not 3. kept the pie held together well. Will definately make this again :)

This is truly amazing! I changed the sugar to 1 cup instead of 3/4 cup and added an additional tablespoon of cornstarch. It's still too hot to cut but I tasted a bit of it and my goodness! So good!
EDIT: This pie absolutely deserves 5 stars, but I think I'd add yet another tablespoon of cornstarch. It was a little too runny for my preference, even when cooled. However, flavor and texture cannot be beat, especially warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream beside it! I'd give it more stars if I could!

This filling worked so well! I made it for a friend who is Diabetic with Stiva instead of sugar and a lattice crust for the top. I also added a full Tbsp of cinnamon and left out the butter because I plain forgot. It was hot, gooey and sliced perfectly! Thank you for sharing!

4 instead of 5 just because I had to alter it just a tiny bit. I think the key here is fresh, smaller blueberries. That's what I used, picked fresh that morning and some were even slightly underripe, so I used slightly more sugar, but not a full cup. I used 4TBS. cornstarch per the other reviews and it was an absolutely perfect, sweet/slightly tart pie. Just the way I like it. Thank You!

This pie tastes wonderful and is a cinch to make.  I make mine with a homemade pie crust and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.

This was very easy to make and the taste was incredible.  I added more cornstarch after reading what others had written (5Tbls.) It was too thick for my taste and I will use 3Tbls. next time. I also added 1tsp. of lemon juice and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I will definitely be making this again because the taste was out of this world.

I tried the recipe as written, but didn't care for the cinnamon taste at all.  I added lemon zest and the juice of 1 lemon to try to compensate, but next time I would omit the cinnamon altogether.  I used 6 cups of fresh blueberries since I have a 9.5 inch pan and made my own crust with a lattice top.  I had tasted it after I just added the zest and lemon and it was great, wish I had just added sugar and cornstarch (5 TBSP. as others have suggested.)  Lower the temp. to 375 and cook for about 50- 60 minutes, as 425 would burn the crust.

Came out delicious. The only recommendation I would make is to put foil around the edge of the crust until the last 15 mins of baking to avoid over browning! Great pie!

This recipe was a great start. I have modified it each time I've made it. This last time I used a few of the suggestions from others. I turned the heat down to 400 because one time I made this the filling almost burned up the stove. I used 1 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I squeezed half of a lemon over the blueberry mixture in the crust and used a quarter teaspoon of vanilla. Since I haven't yet picked my own blueberries I usually soak store bought blueberries overnight in sugar water. Thank you! My family and friends LOVE this pie.

I used this recipe to make a black raspberry, red raspberry pie. It turned out great! A few adjustments I made were: I omitted the cinnamon, added some lemon juice, and increased the corn starch to 4 Tbsp. It was still a bit runny, but mostly held together well. I will be making this again for sure!

My mistake for not reading a few reviews before making this pie. The flavor is delicious but the filling is very soupy. I love blueberries so I know I will give this another try using a method of thickening it up. Also, I added 5 cups of fresh blueberries because only 4 cups looked like it would produce a sunken looking pie. At least all the extra juice can be poured over the vanilla ice cream that I serve with the pie! :)

Did not care for this recipe.  Just not sweet enough.  I was talking on the phone while making this so may have done something wrong.  Will try again.  Your recipes have all be outstanding so think it may have been me.

YUMMY!  I used fresh blueberries therefore used 6 level Tablespoons of the Cornstarch.  Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg along with the cinnamon.  Baked as directed but topped with an egg wash to glaze the crust as many reviews stated that the temp was too high.  With the egg wash applied, the temp, rack location & time were perfect!  DELISH!!

This is the first time that I have baked a blueberry pie.  It was wonderful!!  I did change a few things though.  I added 4 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 3, 2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of grated lemon zest.  I also exchanged 1/4 cup of the sugar with splenda.  To top it off, I made it with a gluten free crust. Nobody noticed the difference.

Excellent and easy recipe.  If you want to taste a classic blueberry pie ... this is it!  I could have been better with my lattice work, but I'll work on it next time.  Delicious pie!

This recipe was a bit hit with the whole family!  I used 4 cups of fresh picked blueberries and 1 cup of raspberries.  I added 1 tbsp of lemon juice to step 2 and used slightly less sugar than called for because we like our pie a little less sweet.  Amazing!

Wow!!! First attempt at baking a pie and my husband was thrilled! He said it was the BEST Pie he had ever eaten and boy does he know his pies! I added the extra cornstarch, 1T. and lowered the temp to 400 and baked for 60 minutes. The pie cooled  for 3 hours and then we dug in, PERFECT! Thank you for a great recipe!

This blueberry pie was the BIGGEST hit among my family and friends. They said it was literally the best pie they have ever eaten! We did however change one thing, we added lemon juice and zest. We have heard that it brings it all together, and it did! Thank you for this wonderful and EASY recipe, that I will continue to make many more times.

The pie tasted very good.  I used the amount of sugar stated, but did add another TBS of cornstarch. This is not a pie you can serve warm to company as it will be runny.  It sets up ok the next day.  Seeing as I didn't mind how it served up hot or cold I thought is was great.

I found this pie to be exceptional easy to make. I did make one change to the pie I added 1 more cup of blueberries and changed the sugar to 1 cup. I used a butter crust recipe for the pastry.  I also added "Sugar in the Raw" on top of the lattice. Everybody who has tasted this has just raved about it.  This is a Wow pie at any event.

If I make this pie again, I will make several changes. First, I'll use closer to 5 cups of blueberries and then I will increase the cornstarch to about 4 Tbls. Finally, I'll  another 1/2 c of surgar or sweetener. 
The pie did firm up after it was refrigerated. All in all not the best blueberry pie receipe I've used.

Great easy recipe. I actually lessened the amount of sugar and cornstarch, because my blueberries were pretty sweet and it still firmed up nicely and I wanted to make it less caloric. For the top crust I used a cookie cutter of stars and added it on top, would be good for 4th of July and some raspberries.

This pie recipe is easy and delicious - not too sweet, not to tart.  My husband and guests loved it!  This will be my "go-to" recipe.

Based on the many reviews I read prior to making the pie, I adjusted the following: 
1) I used fresh cultivated/high bush blueberries, so I increased the cornstarch from 3 to 4 TBSP.  
2) I covered the crust edges with aluminum foil for the first 35 minutes.

Awesome pie; is very sweet though. I tried it at a little over 4 tbsp cornstarch, and it was just a little bit runny. I will try 5 next time. Also, I only needed 3-3.5 or so cups of blueberries.

Good recipe.  The pie was rather runny, but I think that was due to my oven (new Convection oven, we're still trying to get acquainted).

Very good! I did use 5 tablespoons of corn starch and also added a bit of Nutmeg as well!  I used Splenda too - about 3/4 c. and the pie turned out GREAT!!!  I put all of the dry ingredients into a bowl - corn starch, cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar and mixed those together well and then added the blueberries and coated those up well before putting it all into the pie crust!

Made this today for the second time. I added more cornstarch this time (about 5 1/2 Tbsp for 5 cups of fresh berries) and it was still just slightly soupy even hours after baking. I'd probably add just half a tablespoon more next time.  I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and juice from half a lemon and thought it was a great addition. Definitely use 1 cup of sugar. Overall a very good blueberry pie! It was gone QUICK!

The taste was good, but it was very watery.  I even upped the cornstarch to 5 tbs. and it still ran all over the place when I cut it.

We liked the recipe a lot, but it was too sweet for us.  I would cut back the sugar to maybe even 1/2 cup next time.  I used 1 tbsp of cornstarch for each cup of blueberries, and the consistency was great.  Used Pilsbury Pie crust which is great, but for some reason my pie bottom crust stuck to the bottom of the pie plate.  Still very delicious, and will make again:)

Exquisite!  I had never made nor tasted blueberry pie until I made this.  My only critique was to add a little less cinnamon which I will do next time but it was amazing!!!  Everyone loved it!

This was fantastic! I bought too many blueberries (four packages) and was able to fit it all in the pie. Because I added more blueberries, I also added a little more sugar, cornstarch and cinnamon. I used the refrigerated Pillsbury crust.

I ran into the same problem with this recipe as with the rhubarb pie -- way too much water, even with all the cornstarch.  In both pies, I bought my fruit from a local farmers market...I'm wondering if there is more water in farm fresh produce than in supermarket goods.   I wish I knew what to change to handle the extra water!     Also, I used nutmeg and a few dashes of curry powder instead of cinnamon and it was very tasty.

Fabulous recipe!  If only it weren't 100 degrees outside, I could imagine I was on the coast of Maine.  Yum!  I used a deep disk pie pan and increased the blueberries to 5 cups, cornstarch to 5 T and sugar to 1 cup.  It set perfectly.  I would probably increase the sugar a bit more next time since I used store-bought blueberries and they were not terribly sweet.

Wonderful blueberry pie,  I used 6 cups of berries, as I had a deep dish pan, and added 5 Tb of cornstarch, sprinkle of cinnamon, and a splash of lemon juice.   We all loved it, it was a nice consistency, and will be a keeper for me.

I would never normally waste my time on fruit pie (am a chocolate cake person), but we were having guests and I made this for them.  It was fabulous!  I used 4 tbsp cornstarch, and forgot the butter, but otherwise followed it exactly.  It was delicious and I will be making another one soon!

I made this, and got rave reviews such as "this is better than my Mom's, but don't tell her that!" Everyone loved it.  I used 5C blubeberries, because I like a full pie, and thus, added an extra Tbsp of cornstarch.  The consistency was perfect!  Per other reviews and personal taste, I also added a squirt of lemon juice.  This recipe is now going to be my standard for blueberry pie.  Yum!

Super simple and yummy blueberry pie.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and used 4 Tablespoons of cornstarch, 1 Tablespoon for each cup of berries.  I added a bit of lemon juice and increased the sugar to 1 Cup. This still did not make an overly sweet pie but more of a natural blueberry sweetness.  I baked at 375 degrees, but the crust didn't brown as I would have liked, so next time I would bake at 400 degrees.

I haven’t had blueberry pie since I was a kid, today I was given some blueberries from the local farmers market. After my 3 year-old ate a few handfuls; I decided to make a pie. I found this recipe, it sounded very simple and yummy. I whipped up a home-made pie crust and tried my hand at creating a lattice top (which, for the first time, I think looks ok). I couldn’t wait to tear into the pie; it smelt so good as it was baking. My daughter and I tried it at the same time and we just melted. The filling is sweet but still tart, and with the home-made crust, it’s the perfect combination of home-made love—just like grandma! Thanks ASHESP for posting! Happy Baking!

After reading all of the tweakings that people changed, I didn't know what to do. I finally decided to do 4 1/2 Tablespoons cornstarch(more,but not quite as much as everyone else) and I ended up with a thick but delicious filling that bubbled and did not run. It was not pasty,but very juicy and syrupy, just how I like it!

Very good.  The only changes I made were to use 1 c. Splenda, 5 c. blueberries and I used margarine instead of butter.  It was not runny and set up very well.  I didn't do the latice crust, but just a regular top crust.  It was so beautiful I almost hated to cut into it.  It's definitely a keeper!

It tastes awesome, however it still came out runny even though i used 5 tablespoons of cornstarch like suggested by other reviewers. I think leaving the pie in the oven for 2-3 more minutes might fix that.

I added 4 tbsp of cornstarch and a squeeze of lemon. I spent about 2 hours on this pie and it ended up as a runny mess that tasted good. I was  incredibly ticked off!!!! Need to add a lot more thickening agent. Flour? Tapioca? 6 tbsp of cornstarch? I baked it at 385 and put foil on the crust except for the last 10 min. The crust turned out perfectly...used the best pie crust recipe from allrecipes.

My very first pie...upon reading the reviews, I did 4 cups blueberries, and 5 tbsp cornstarch.  It turned out fabulous....it's runny for the rest of the day, but the day after it's not anymore.  I will totally be making it again soon!!

AMAZING!!!!!!! Made two small changes, though.  Put in 5 tbs. cornstarch and only 1/4 tsp. cinnamon.  This pie is a true gift from God.

Excellent!  I only had 3 cups of fresh blueberries instead of 4, so I substituted 1 cup of fresh strawberries for the remainder.  Also added 2 tablespoons cornstarch and 2 tablespoons lemon juice.  So delicious!

This was a very good recipe - didn't feel like it quite hit the "outstanding" category, so only gave it 4 stars.  However, everyone who tried a slice said it was very good and that I should make it again.

Okay, Just made this for dinner tonight... I used Steph's Crust Recipe, which I found a little drier, but I could have added more water, I didn't know it was my first crust attempt. I used frozen Blueberries and Rasberries, and 4 T. of corn starch... I also used a full top crust with some designs on it for venting... So we shall see... Hope it all good...

This was the first time I had ever made pie, and since I used a frozen pie crust it was super easy!  Everyone who had a piece loved it.  I upped it to 4T cornstarch and forgot the extra butter but it wasn't missed at all.  Delicious!

I thought this was really easy, the pie taste really good. I did follow the advice of adding 6 tablespoons cornstarch, I thought that this was way to much. The pie in the middle was perfect but the at the base was jelly and somewhat just ugly looking. I also added 1 1/4 cup sugar. I will make again maybe with 5 tablespoons instead of 6. Thank you for sharing this wonderful pie recipe

I don't like blueberries, but I made this for a friend as a request, and it got rave reviews. I also served it with homemade whipped cream, which I'm told was a great choice. I'm relaying their 5-star rating.

My family and I live in Maine where there is an abundance of wild blueberries and we have never had blueberry pie. I decided to solve that problem last summer. I took the advice of some of the reviewers and added extra cornstarch (5Tbs.) and it was perfect. The blueberries were fresh and sweet and added to the "perfectness" of the pie. I will now make this MULTIPLE times during the summer months.

Delicious recipe! I used 5 T. cornstarch and it was the perfect consistency after sitting overnight. I also added 1 full teaspoon of ground cinnamon and it gave it a delicious flavor. I would stick with the 3/4 cup of sugar. Any more will make it runny, and its just enough to make it sweet. I baked at 400 degrees for 55 minutes with a lattice top.  I used a homemade flaky crust and it was perfect!

A wonderful pie! I made two with a full crust on the top and I baked them for 1 1/2 hrs.  I increased the startch to 4 tablespoons and it probably could use about 5 per pie.

I've made this recipe for almost every family gathering I go to and everbody loves it. I usually add 3 grannysmith apples. sliced and peeled, to the blueberries. I would definetly suggest adding more cornstarch then the recipe calls for because if you don't it turns out runny. I am also a big fan of cinnamon, so i put about 2 tablespoons instead of 1/2 tsp. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this yesterday for the first time and it was a HUGE hit!  My mother in law even asked me for the recipe... SCORE!  Anyway, I only made a couple minor changes, I took the advice of others and used 4Tbsp of corn startch and I used a whole cup of sugar, that was it!  Oh yeah, and I also learned that next time I make this, I need to use more blueberrys, cause without thinking I used my pampered chef stone ware deep dish pie plate and it ended up not being level witht he top.  Other than that, it was awesome and the taste was to die for!  If I coudl give this more than 5 stars I would! :)

used 6TBL cornstarch, added 2TBL lemonjuice and added 1/4C more white sugar. BE CAREFUL - as the blueberries bubbled over into the oven. Next time I will put this on a baking sheet to eliminate the mess. With adjustments I listed above - so yummy with Vanilla bean ice cream!

Absolutely delicious.  Have made it three times. Great recipe!  If using frozen berries, add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. It brings out a stronger flavor.

This is one awesome pie!  Simple and absolutely delicious!  I took it ready to be baked to a friend's house for a small get-together.  The scent filled her home, and we had an incredible, fresh & warm, home-made dessert to share (minus the mess).  Definately a keeper!

If this rating was for flavor alone I would have rated it 5 stars. It was yummy. The pie came out way too runny. Something is not right with this recipe. It didn't thicken up. I loved the taste thou. I am thinking about thickening the ingrendents by cooking it on the stove top first possibly. Maybe only cook half of it this way then add the other half of the berries and bake it in the pie crusts? It was too runny. What a mess.

This pie is wonderful.  I read reviews and increased the cornstarch to 5 tbls. and it was a little too "gel like"--but next time I will put a little less and I think it will be perfect!

I absolutely loved the way it came out...

Although, if you don't have time like me to bake the crust, the ready-made crust in the frozen food section should be baked for 5-10 minutes before you put the filling on top and then put into the oven... 

Also, DONT use store bought frozen berries like pathmark or stop&shop brands, sometimes the stems are still on and there are bad berries in the mix, stick with Dole and by extra or do as the recipe says and buy fresh (but of course, with the prices these days it might be difficult)

I made this pie for the first time yesterday afternoon and although I did not even get a piece, I was told that it was the best pie in the world.  It was the first pie that I ever made from scratch (including the crust) and my husband and co-workers devoured it.  Thank you so much for giving me a great recipe that I can make again and again!

Incredibly delicious. However, like a lot of others have said, I would lower the temperature to 375. At 425, I had to pull the pie out after less than half an hour. It came out a little runny, and it was kind of flat, so I would add more blueberries and more corn starch. Very good foundation for a good pie though.

I was very disappointed in the outcome despite trying the suggested increase in cornstarch and sugar.  With 5Tb of cornstarch and 1C sugar, it was literal soup after an hour of cooling...and still tart (although I do have a sweet tooth).  Also, I did not care for the cinnamon...would probably try lemon juice, as that is typical for baking with blueberries.  My crust was beautiful after 45 min. but I should have covered it with foil and let it bake the extra 10 mins. or so, since the filling had a starchy taste and texture (from underbaking). It is now back in the oven in an attempt to get rid of the starchy taste and salvage what would have otherwise been a beautiful pie.  I'll try another recipe next time.  With all the 5 star ratings, I thought I couldn't miss.  
P.S. to earlier review...after another 15-20 mins. at 400 degrees and foil around the edges, the filling thickened quite a bit and the starchy taste was gone and had a much sweeter taste.  I increased my original rating to 4 stars..as it is very tasty but seems to need too much "adapting" from the original post.

Recipe was o.k. Cinnamon taste is too over powering.  We followed what others suggested by using 5 tbsp. of Cornstarch and it was still a little runny for our taste.  Next time, we're going to omit the cinnamon since it took down the taste of the blueberries.  We'll substitute instead with Lemon juice and zest.

I made this several times, and my only complaint is how runny the filling is. The taste is great! I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of almond extract and MORE cornstarch (5 tablespoons) and I boiled the filling as others have suggested. I used a spoon to remove the filling from the pot, and this helped cut out some of the excess liquid.

I made the pie exactly as written except I used 5 Tbs of corn starch as suggested. It was so runny that after cutting one piece, the area filled with liquid, even though the pie had cooled. I sopped up the excess liquid and what was left tasted really good.

Delicious and easy!!!  I did add the additional 2T of cornstarch others suggested and also a little lemon juice.  Took advice of others and let cool overnight.  It was the perfect consistency the next day.  Not runny at all and quite delicious.  If you're going blueberry picking, pick up a pie crust on the way home and make this simple pie.  It's sooo good.

I followed others suggestion and added 5 T of corn starch. I used 2 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries and 2 1/2 cups of fresh boysenberries. I don't use sugar and substituted splenda and added 1 T lemon juice but when I make it again I think I'll use 2 T. I baked at at 400 degrees for an hour covering the crust with foil until the last 15 min. It turned out very well and my husband and I both enjoyed a slice about 1 1/2 hours after it came out of the oven along with some vanilla icecream, very yummy and will be sure to make it again, a very simple pie to make, I used the ready made piecrust which makes it even easier.

I am giving this 3 stars because it is super runny. I even added 2 more tablespoons more of cornstarch than directed. The taste I will give 4 stars. It is a great taste. I will need to work on it a bit and I am sure it will be perfect.

This is such a good recipe and it made an outstanding pie!  Followed the recipe as written except we mixed the sugar, cinnamon and cornstarch in with the blueberries and added a dash of lemon juice.  We used 4 Tablespoons of corn starch but will probably try 5 next time since the pie was still pretty runny.  Will also cut down just a tiny bit on the sugar since it was a little too sweet.

I did it without the butter mainly because I forgot it and it came out AMAZING I bumped up the cornstarch a tablespoon and the sugar a teaspoon. Put it all into the flaky crust (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Basic-Flaky-Pie-Crust/Detail.aspx) Came out so good definately going to do this again!

Not as sweet as I would have liked it but everyone else loved it.  I added 6 tbs of corn starch as recommended by another reviewer but I think 5 would've been enough.  I also had to use frozen blueberries because the fresh ones didn't look too good. I will definitely make this again with revisions.

I just made this pie, and it is delicious! HOWEVER, I did not read the previous reviews that suggested adding more cornstarch...so for those of you reading this, don't forget to add more cornstarch!!!  Although, the pie tastes wonderful, it is totally liquid. The next time I make it I will definitely add at least two additional tablespoons of cornstarch and will let it sit for a few hours before cutting it!

the second time i made it, it was awesome!  changes:  white sugar 1/3c, brown sugar 1/3c, add 3 T tapioca, total cinnamon 1 t.  to get the top crust (shell) (i bought frozen) onto the pie, invert it, tinfoil plate and all, onto a dinner plate.  you can then slide the pastry off the dinner plate and onto your pie.  will make again!

I always thought I hated blueberry pie. It turns out, I LOVE blueberry pie if it is made in this exact way. Took another reviewer's recommendation to add a splash of lemon juice. Luscious.

Yummy! I picked up some fresh Michigan blueberries on my way back from vacation and made this delicious pie. Vanilla ice cream is the perfect compliment to a slice of this pie.

This pie is excellent with a few modifications, like other reviewers said. I baked this pie in a convection oven at 375, and upped the cornstarch to 5 tablespoons and it was perfect! The best blueberry pie I ever tasted.

Faboulicious! An even better surprise since this was the first pie I ever baked :). I used sugar in the raw instead of white sugar though and one package of the Pillsbury Pie dough for the crust.

This was the first blueberry pie I've ever made.  I made it for my fiance's grandfather as it is his favorite.  I personally did not get to try it because it was all gone before I could get to it.  Grandpa was mad because he only got one piece!  I'll take that as a good sign.  :-)

This is only the second pie I have ever made. It was so easy and delicious. At others suggestions I used 4 tbs. cornstarch. It was the perfect amount. Next time I will keep an eye on the pie though- I just let it cook for the suggested time and the pie crust was overcooked.

The family thought it was a little tart - could have used some more sugar.  But that might've just been the berries too.  Thanks for the recipe!

Grandma's 83rd b-day, what do you want grandma. I want blueberry pie, she says. Well I've never made blueberry so I'll find a recipe. I found this one and everyone loved it. It was gone in the 1st round of desert eating.

I thought the recipe was good, but nothing spectacular. I took it to a picnic and my friend seemed to like it a lot. I tried to make mini-pies in muffin tins, but the cooking time is almost half and the temperature is around 350.

very tasty!! I didn't have cornstarch so I used ~1/2 cup of all purpose flour instead. The pie is still a bit runny after sitting for 2 hours, but very yummy! I also added 1 Tbs of lemon juice as suggested by others. Will definitely make again!

The recipe is completly great! I had some frozen blueberrys and some fresh ones, so I mixed them. I mixed the corn startch after I put the blueberrys in the pie crust, as cornstartch sometimes sticks to bowels. Also, Splenda granual works great in the recipe, although I did take it out five (5) minutes early.

I used frozen berries, and couldn't find blueberries so I grabbed a couple bags of mixed berries instead. Still good!!! I added 2 tbsp of lemon juice like another user suggested but that made it a little too tart so next time I'll probably just use one. Sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on top of the crust before popping it in the oven for an extra touch. Also, make sure you cover the edges of the crust while baking, and heat the oven to 400, not 425.

So good!  I added extra cornstarch as others noted 5 T. instead of three and then let it cool for several hours.  It held its shape fairly well, but you have to remember it is a berry pie!  The flavors blend beautifully!  We served it with a dollop of vanilla icecream. Thanks for a great recipe!

This has wonderful flavor, but was too runny with only 3T cornstarch.  I will make this again, but will add add'l cornstarch.  Also, I made a cinnamon-streusal topping because I only had 1 pie crust and it tasted great that way also.

Thanks, Beth, for a great recipe!  My husband is fanatical about blueberry pie, but I had never made one.  This recipe was simple to make and we really enjoyed the pie.  I tried 5T of cornstarch, and it turned out fine.  Will try 4T next time... and there will be a next time soon!  Also, whoever posted the pretty picture of the pie with stars on top inspired me... my pie was made with heart cutouts.  (As I write this, he is helping himelf to more pie!!)

This blueberry pie is a true beauty!  I made it exactly as written, although I did use a crumb crust rather than a pastry crust.  This recipe goes into my permanent "Best Recipes" file and trust me, not many make the cut, but this one sure did.

We went blueberry picking and our 4 year old wanted to make pie. I have to admit I am not a fan of blueberry pie but with this recipe I am now one. I agree with the others that you need more cornstarch I added 6T and it was perfect. So simple for small hands to make themselves. Thanks

This pie turned out really well.  It was so easy that I made it with my 7 year old son.  It did brown very fast being on the bottom rack and I removed it 10 minutes early.

Even though I love baking, I always fear making pies.  This was frighteningly easy, though I definitely recommend 5 tablespoons of cornstarch rather than 3.  You can't go wrong!

Tastes good, but with 20 min. left of cooking time, the crust was overly brown and the middle had not cooked.  I was concerned about placing it on the bottom rack, as it's closest to my heat source, but I followed directions.  I covered it with foil to prevent further browning, and when all was said and done, the inside was still quite runny. Want to try again, with modifications...

We really liked this pie.  I used fresh blueberries, and they were either a little tart or the recipe needed more sugar.  I recommend tasting your blueberries first and determining how much sugar it needs.  Other than that it was very good.

I used frozen wild berries.  Let them thaw until the centre of the  blueberries were like "slush" in texture.  Used 2 tbsp corn strach and 1 tbsp all purpose flour.  Look forward to making this easy receipe again.

As it said in the description - would work with frozen blueberries too, so I tried with frozen as fresh are not available where I am right now.  Well, I followed the recipe and even increased the cornstarch to 5 TBSP like other reviewers said and it still came out runny after setting overnight.  Next time I'll try it with even more cornstarch I guess!

This is the first pie I ever made. It was wonderful. I used fresh berries. 5 tablespoons of cornstarch, and follow the directions exactly. I also waited 2 hours before cutting. The pie was perfect, not runny at all. The only thing I would do differently is cook for 40 minutes not 50, or turn the oven temp down a bit. I did cover the edges with foil, the top was a bit darker than I would do next time. However, this recipe was easy and very tasty. I highly recommend it.

I made it for my neighbours, husband and wife and it was gone in one day.  They said it was fantastic.  I increased cornstarch to 5 tbsps. I knew if I kept in in the house I would eat the whole thing since my husband doesn't care for blueberries.

Don't know what went wrong but I found this recipe only ok.   I used 1/4 c cornstarch as one reviewer suggested and waited for it to thoroughly cool (about two hours).  It was still watery and taste only ok.  I have to admit - Mrs. Smith does a better job with a blueberry pie though this recipe was easy.

This was delicious!  The only adjustment I made was to up the cornstarch to 1/4 cup. I served it at room temperature and it held together beautifully.  It was sweet and super easy to make.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

I found that 425 F was too hot. The crust was too dark.  Next time I would turn oven down to 350 after about 15 minutes

Who doesn't love blueberry pie?  This was a great recipe.  I forgot to add the butter, but it didn't need it!  I think next time I will use a little less sugar, since the pie was a little sweet, but it probably depends on the ripeness of the berries.

Just a terrific recipe.  My boyfriend and his eleven year old daughter went blueberry picking and I used this recipe to make a pie that we ate for dessert one night and we polished it off the next morning!  I used  just over half a cup of sugar rather than the 3/4 cup that this recipe suggested.  Our fresh summer berries didn't need the extra sugar.  And for pastry shells I used the French Pastry Pie Crust recipe found on this site.  It was perfect.

I just had rave reviews from my colleagues for my blueberry pie. It was my first time to bake blueberry pies and the pies were good. It was very easy, too. The only thing was one of them got over-baked when I baked it for 50 minutes as specified in the recipe. I have a convection oven. I baked the other one for 40 minutes which seemed to be adequate. So if you have a convection oven, you may want to watch your pie closely around after 40 minutes.

I had never made a blueberry pie before.(I don't know why I've baked just about everyother kind.)I found the recipe very easy.  I did add alittle more cornstarch.  I thank you Beth for the recipe that I will use again and again.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 4 tablespoons of corn starch, but the pie still came out runny! :(  I did not do the lattice top crust, that may have been the problem.  It tastes fantastic, just way too soupy.  Next time I will try the lattice top and see if that helps.

I never much cared for blueberry pie until I made this recipe.  The pie was great. I used fresh blueberries, increased the cornstarch to 4 tablespoons, used 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1 cup sugar (berries were very tart),a little lemon. The filling was not soupy at all

The flavor is great but I screwed up (being the novice that I am) and used frozen berries. It was more of a soup-pie!! So don't do that! I will definately use fresh next try!!

I am so glad I tried this recipe!!  It's so good!  Not too sweet, maybe even a little tart.  My diabetic mother loved that it didn't have a ton of sugar!  I used fresh berries - more like 5 cups.  It was great!!!  Thanks!!

MMMM! This was very tasty! Double the blueberries, add a bit more cornstarch and let it cool 5 more minutes than when you think you can cut into it. Don't forget the vanilla ice cream. Happy Pie Eating!

Pie came out very good, even though I used frozen blueberries.  Everyone kept asking if I had used lemon since it was fairly tart, but that was probably just the blueberries.  Also, I used Splenda since I have some family members who are diabetic and it tasted fine!

Great recipe! I made it for the 4th of July. I used the Basic Flaky Pie crust recipe from this site.  I prepared a double crust and used star cookie cutters as vent holes as another reviewer had suggested. I forgot to add the extra tablespoon of cornstarch as others had suggested. It came out great though I think I would like it better a little less runny.  My dad loved the pie so much, he though I shouldn't change a thing.

This is a wonderful pie recipe! The "seasoning" for the blueberries was perfect, and like someone mentioned, I added between 3/4 cup and 1 cup of sugar and it turned out great. I also used 600g of frozen blueberries and in the end the bottom of my pie was 'blueberry juice', but it was great anyhow, because it wasn't watered down. Like many others, I used 4 cups of cornstarch and that worked out well, also. I used the pie crust recipe here on allrecipes.com called 'french pastry pie crust' and it worked well, although you could have added a little nutmeg. I am not toying with you, not once did my dough ever crack or falter when I put it on my pies. What worked was leaving it in the fridge for an extra five minutes (fifteen minutes). The recipe calls for a 50 minute bake, but after 38 minutes my crust was already browned and it turned out perfectly! And finally, I lightly pinched cinnamon on top of my pie for the 'look' of a fabulous pie! Enjoy!

The tast was great.  I made w/frozen blueberries and therefore added 5 tbls of cornstarch.  Nevertheless it was a bit runny however the taste was NOT compromised one bit.  So next time I'll add another couple of Tbs of cornstarch or maybe some flour.  There WILL be a next time... it was delicious!

This is the first review I've written...I just had to review it because the pie was incredible!!!  I followed the recipe as submitted, and had no problems with it setting.  The edges of my crust did brown, but tin foil turns that trick.  The pie was gorgeous and my husband proclaimed it the best pie he'd ever tried.  Thanks again, Beth!

Fantastic pie.  I made two pies....one with blueberries and one with raspberries and both came out great.  I took the suggestions for increasing the sugar and cornstarch, and I ditched the cinnamon.  I will definitely make again.

This was my first blueberry pie.  I baked it for a summer patio party and it was a huge success.

First homemade pie EVER for a blueberry pie snob and I passed! I do also recommend the crust by TJ. I used two 16 oz bags of frozen berries as someone else said and it overflowed the deep pie pan, that's too may berries. My crust is excellent, but purple. ;) Perhaps use a bag and half frozen instead, but taste is excellent. Quick and easy to make, tastes wonderful.

best blueberry pie I ever had. I made this over the summer, and forgot to submit a review. 
I added extra corn starch, too, like some reviewers said, and it turned out great. I used fresh blueberries and a homemade crust and I added a bit more cinnamon, just cause I like cinnamon. Excellent recipe!

After sorting through dozens of blueberry pie reipes, I chose this one because it sounded the most traditional. My blueberries were a little tart to begin with, so I added 1 full c. of sugar instead of 3/4 c. The pie turned out pretty well; I wish I would've increased the cornstarch, though, as the filling was a little runny even after sitting in the fridge for a few hours. I used the "French Pastry Pie Crust" (submitted by TJ), as suggested by another reviewer - one of the best pie crusts I've ever made.

I made this pie for my husband who is a "blueberry pie afficionado". He loved it. It is very easy to make and very satisfying.

Finest blueberry pie ever!  Used 4 tablespoons (1/4 cup) of cornstarch instead of 3 tablespoons - filling was perfect - not runny.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe!

I used fresh blueberries and it was absolutely 
delicious! I agree with others that it
was a little runny -- next time I'll increase the
cornstarch and hopefully that will help.
If you're looking for a good blueberry pie recipe,
your search is over.
