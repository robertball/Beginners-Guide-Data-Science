This was great! I just used chicken instead of beef, and halved the sugar. I also left out the soy sauce and garlic, along with not having any green onions, so I left them out also. Basically I just made fried chicken. (Not really, but this is how all the comments are on allrecipes anymore, so I didn't want to stand out.)

Excellent. I eliminated the bowls altogether. Reduce soy sauce and brown sugar to 1/2 cup, increase water to 1 1/2 cups Put corn starch and steak strips into a sealable baggie and shake to coat. Add all other ingredients (except carrots) to crock pot and mix. Stir in coated steak until all pieces are covered. Cook on high for 2 hours. After 2 hours add carrots and continue cooking for 1 more hour .

This is a fantastic recipe w modifications. I used 1/2 cup soy sauce; 1/2 cup loosely packed brown sugar, enough cornstarch to completely coat the meat (I used triangle steak) and nearly 2 cups of water to get the right thickness. An hour before serving time, I added 1 cup shredded carrots, 1 sliced onion and 1 sliced pepper. Yummy.

This is one of the best slow cooker recipes I have made in a long time.  Both in terms of ease and quality.  

Reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup per many suggestions, and I think this was fine, although I suspect it would have been just fine as originally directed.  

I also substituted a flat iron steak for the flank steak because the flanks were all two pounds or more.  I've grilled flatirons quite a bit and knew they would be similar, plus they were cheaper.  

I cut the steak into strips before the cornstarch step.  This gave more surface area to be coated with the cornstarch, although I am not sure why it is even necessary to coat the meat as the marinade surely washed it off.  It probably could just be whisked into the soy mixture at the beginning.  But I followed instructions except used a gallon zip lock back to shake the beef for coating.  I marinated in the same bag I used to shake it up with the cornstarch.  The whole concoction fit easily in my 2.5Q slow cooker.  (I wish all slow cooker recipes would tell you what size you need.  Sometimes I guess too small and wind up having to transfer to a bigger slow cooker, and nothing aggravates me more than dirtying up dish for no good reason and then having to wash it.) 

I checked it at about 2:30 and it was not tender.   But by 2:45 some marvelous chemical or thermodynamic reaction had taken place and it was just perfectly tender and flavorful.  Served on jasmine rice.

This recipe was not bad, but it needs to have the sugar content cut back.  I subbed half of 3/4 cup Splenda brown sugar mix for 3/4 cup regular brown sugar, but it was very sweet (and I like sweet in my marinades).  Next time I will try 1/3 cup regular brown sugar (or half of a 1/3 cup if using Splenda brown sugar blend).  Other than that, it is a GREAT weeknight meal when served with Jasmine rice (w/ a little sesame oil and salt added when cooking) and roasted broccoli florets (mixed w/ a little sesame oil and salt and then roasted at 400 for roughly 10 minutes).

This rating is for Stephen Spradley's review. I laughed out loud! I do believe he is making fun of all the people who completely change a recipe and then give it a poor rating! If you completely change a recipe, you shouldn't rate it at all, let alone give it a poor rating. Yes, we all make our own modifications to our personal preferences and that's fine. Cudo's to you Stephen!!

Probably one of my favorite mongolian beef for the slow cooker.  For the next time though, I would either use low sodium soy sauce or lessen it; Control the sweetness for you liking.  I did not use the carrots because I was using the carrots to our side dish.  Of course,  you may add onions and red bell peppers for the last hour or so....

It looks good and I want to try it. This may be a stupid question: do you slice the flank steak before marinating or after cooking? Thanks in advance! I hope I can come back and revise my rating if I need to!

This recipe was very good but next time I won't  add a red pepper or onion, as a previous reviewer had done. The extra vegetables released a lot of water into the sauce and, in my opinion, made it too diluted. I prefer a richer, more concentrated sauce. It was served over rice noodles. 
I only added 1/3 cup brown sugar, and used low sodium soy sauce. Definitely will make it again.

wonderful with a few changes to taste. Halved the sugar and would probably do less next time and also halved the soy sauce. Increased water to make up the difference. OMG good!

This is a good recipe, but I do agree with many other reviewers that it is a good idea to use half the amount of soy and sugar and then make up the difference in the amount of liquid with water. I skipped the whole freezer step, and just made the marinade in the crockpot with the addition of a generous T of sesame seeds. Shook the beef strips and cornstarch together in a ziplock bag, and then added the coated meat to the crockpot. Cooked on low for 3 hours, which was plenty. Also, I stirred every hour to make sure all the meat strips were evenly cooked. Definitely recommend serving over rice. Yum!

Wonderful flavor with very tender meat.  The only changes that I made were using 1/4 cup maple syrup instead of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp ground ginger because I did not have ginger root. I also thickened with 2 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in water, turned the slow cooker on high for 10 min.  Served on rice noodles.

I didn't freeze this first, just made it with fresh meat and followed the rest of the recipe to a T. We all liked this overall, but I agree with moaa that it is too salty. I think next time, I'll take her (his?) suggestion and add some onion and red bell pepper for the last hour.

I made this for out-of-town company and followed the recipe to a "T".  It was SO easy and perfect to make when entertaining overnight company.  To say they LOVED it would be an understatement.  With each bite, they couldn't resist commenting on how delicious it was.   (I served this with white rice and an asian slaw salad.)  The flavor is full and HARDLY lacking.  Perhaps the reviewer who thought this dish lacked flavor didn't marinate long enough?  I believe the key thing is to ensure the meat is marinated for at least 24 hours, so plan ahead.  This is  KEEPER!

Great stuff! My family of men loved it served over rice!  I did as others and cut back on the soy sauce and sugar. Plus my guys like lots of sauce so I 1 1/2  it plus they love spicey so I added 2  teaspoons of garlic chillie sauce found in the Asian section.

This definitely had good flavor, but needed a little punch.   Used beef broth instead of water and added fresh vegetables during the last hour producing more 'liquid' sauce than I had anticipated.  A quick slurry of sesame oil, garlic chili paste and corn starch remedied it and it was on the table in no time.  Family gave thumbs up!  Thanks for sharing Stephanie!

Just finished having this for dinner.  My husband and I  thought this was very good..  I followed the directions as written with the exception of using the entire bunch of green onions.  I also added a red and yellow pepper  during the last thirty minutes as we are trying to increase our vegetable intake.  I did not freeze this but made it immediately.  I will be making this again.  Very easy and tasty.

This meal turned out pretty nicely. Like others are saying, I put in less soy and brown sugar than called for. I also did not do the frozen marination step, which would likely have helped the taste. Still, even with about 60 minutes of marination time, I thought this dish turned out well.

I cut back on both the soy sauce and sugar, as others suggested (used 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup sugar), and I increased the water to 1 1/2 cups to add liquid.  I cooked on high for 2 hours, then added 1 cup shredded carrots, and about 3/4 cup fresh broccoli, cut into small florets, and let it go on high for another hour.  Served over rice. Hubby said it was good, and a have-again meal. It was certainly easy!

I have not yet tried this recipe, but after reading several reviews, a few changes occur to me.  As most were saying, reducing the soy and sugar quantities seem to be preferred.  There were also comments about how cooking the vegetables with the meat, even the last hour, releases too much liquid resulting in thin sauce.  What about roasting the vegetables separately while the meat cooks?  They generally take around an hour to an hour and a half to roast and there's about a half hour prep time for them.  After the meat is cooked and the veggies are roasted, they can be mixed together to coat the veggies with the sauce.

This is how I'll do it when I prepare my version.  Should work well.

Since I was cooking for only 2, I only had about 1.1 lbs of meat.  I had to use a different cut of meat that was labeled and cut into strips for stir-fry.  It ended up a little tough after cooking on high for 2 hours.  I used low sodium soy sauce, and the cut it and the sugar to about 1/2 cup.  I put the cornstarch in a gallon Ziploc and shook it up with the meat to coat, then added the soy sauce, sugar, ginger, garlic and bit of water.  I let that marinade overnight in refrigerator since I was cooking it the next day.  I stir-fried onions, green peppers and tomatoes separately because my other half won't eat any veggies.  I served his over rice, and mine over veggies. It was delicious!  Definitely will make again!  Oh, I sprinkled red pepper flakes on mine!

My husband thinks this is the best slow cooker recipe I have ever made. I didn't freeze the mixture first, but I did marinate it for 24 hours in the fridge. I also heeded the advice of other reviewers and cut back on the soy sauce and the sugar. The beef was tender and flavorful. I think I will keep a couple of bags of this in the freezer.

Fabulous!   I made it just as the recipe is written and it was wonderful.  I cooked for 5 hours on low in the crockpot.  It was the most tender steak I have had.  I did use flat iron because the store didn't have flank steak.  I used 2 pounds and between myself and two teenage boys there wasn't a morsel left.

I really loved this recipe and plan to make it again (and again and again). However, I added about 2 TBLS of minced ginger and about 1/4 cup ketchup. Also, when I went to purchase flank steak it was $23 for a pound and a half. They had a round steak on sale for under $6... you guessed it. The round steak just melted in our mouths.

Well the only change I made was that I had to choose a different cut of beef.  I could not find flank steak in the Market I shop at  but everything else is exactly the same. I just didn't freeze it, I cooked it right away. Coincidentally I am in American teacher living in Beijing,  China  and I'm always looking for recipes for my slow cooker. So I decided to try this!

Tasty... Also as others said I reduced sugar and soy sauce to a 1/2 cup and increased water. Also I advise using reduced sodium soy sauce to lessen the saltiness.

I halved the meat in the recipe but kept the other ingredients the same as I wanted the gravy. I reduced the soy sauce a little bit too much though. I also cut down on the sugar, based on the comments of the other reviewers, this was fine. I liked the taste very much and will make again.

Once again, a great recipe idea, but WHY add sugar to ruin it. Traditional/authentic Mongolian Beef does not use any sugar, and certainly nowhere near as much as this recipe calls for.

Will not make this again.  Made it exactly as written in the recipe, and it comes out nothing like Mongolian beef from a restaurant.  It looks and tastes more like an Asian-flavored beef stew.  It is WAY too saucy.  A good Mongolian beef should have a slight char on it, and a touch of sweet sauce.  Like most meats in a slow cooker, this beef completely fell apart and drowned in the sauce.  As my husband put it, this dish tasted like every other slow cooker dish that uses soy sauce and brown sugar as primary sauce ingredients.  Won't make this one again.

Thanks to previous reviews, I cut back on the salt and sugar, and just marinated for a few hours before cooking.  Fantastic.  Thumbs up all the way around the table.

I put the cut up meat in a plastic bag with cornstarch and shook to completely cover.  I put the rest of the ingredients directly into the crockpot and mixed and then added the meat, turned on the crockpot and cooked 6 hours.  Was very good and easy.

Cornstarch:  Next time I won't use it even tho I did check other recipes on line and that was used to dredge the meat.  The meat tasted of cornstarch. 
 I cut the amount of brown sugar by half.  The carrots are naturally sweet and they cooked into a nice sauce.  They were never meant to be a vegetable in this recipe - my opinion.  Didn't have green onions so I used 1/4 of a sweet onion.   
To correct the taste of cornstarch, I took the meat out of the sauce and put it in a pan of soy sauce, beef broth and water.  That helped a lot.  We ate it over rice.

I made the original recipe, but thought it was too sweet. This time I only used 1/3 cup of soy sauce, 1/3 cup brown sugar and only 1/3 of a cup of water. I used the green onions in crockpot, but also topped it with fresh green onions when serving. I didn't use cornstarch and it still tasted fabulous.

I made this yesterday. I mixed all the ingredients in a ziplock bag, mixed it well and put it in the crockpot (skipped the freezing step). And it turned out great. Next time I'm going to steam up some broccoli and it will be just like the broccoli beef I order at the Chinese restaurant.

The meat was very tender but the flavour was a little lacking.  I made 2 bags - one to make and taste the flavour, the other to adjust if necessary and freeze.  I have added some hoisin sauce to the freezer bag and will try it at a later date.

Excellent! 
I added sliced red pepper and onions the last hour. I did not freeze it, but marinated overnight. The meat was so tender that it was hard to slice without shredding it. Served over rice and was in heaven. Next time I will cut sugar to 1/2 cup as others have suggested. This is soooo good and sooo easy.

This is a great recipe, but for the love of God make sure you use reduced sodium soy sauce or it will be way too salty.

I cut the sugar and soy sauce in half, but honestly would keep the water level the same as the actual recipe since when I increased the water, it was a little more mushy than I wanted. I also would keep the soy sauce amount the same as the actual recipe as I felt it needed that salt kick. I'd also add one green and one red pepper and some onions.

Made per directions (very easy to make) and my family LOVE IT!  Only thing as many had stated is that this dish very sweet.
Next time I will cut the brown sugar by half. 

I also added broccoli the last 20 minutes and it became too soft for our tastes, so  next time I will steam the broccoli and toss it around before serving,

Enjoy!

More like 4.5 stars. My only substitute was thinly sliced chuck roast because that’s what I had. This is very flavorful but a tad on the sweet side; I may cut some of the sugar and add red pepper flakes next time.

I've made this several times and love it. Though I have reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup. I also like to add 2 cups of frozen bell peppers and onions and 1 tbsp of chili paste.

Easy, delicious recipe.  Followed advice from other reviewers and reduced brown sugar and soy sauce to a 1/2 cup of each and glad I did as the dish was sweet enough and flavorful with reduced amounts and not too salty.  Used reduced sodium soy sauce.  Skipped marinating overnight.  Coated beef with corn starch and browned before adding to crock pot.  Beef was tender and consistency of sauce was perfect after 3 hours on low.  Adding green onions until the last hour is important as they get mushy.

I made this for my wife and myself last night, and loved it.
I did add 1 diced red bell pepper and it was mainly for added colour.

I will have to tweak this recipe just a bit. It was too sweet. The scallions should have been cut larger (my own fault). Overall it was good. Will make it again with some modifications.

Very easy! My 19 year old son said it was the best meal I'd made in a long time. I used 1/2 c. soy sc and brown sugar, which worked well. Doubled the onions and will use even more next time. Added some extra water to make up for soy sc liquid. Definitely making it again!

Impressive! First let it be known my family doesn’t really eat beef. Moreso because I find chicken easier to prepare. But my mom is allergic to chicken so we gave this a try. We were in a time crunch so we whisked the sauce and just poured it over the beef in the slow cooker. We didn’t have carrots or fresh ginger so we just used powdered ginger. And I wasn’t sure about the amount of brown sugar so I just put 1/2 cup in because I was afraid it would be too sweet.

I have made this recipe many times and the only thing I do differently is to triple the shredded carrots so that we can find them. This recipe is now a favorite of ours and of all of the guests that we have served it to. It's so nice to get it ready and put it in the freezer and then take it out whenever you need it. Takes any stress out of having company for dinner. Absolutely love this recipe.

This was easy to make and very tasty, which I anticipated, as I have a non-slow cooker a recipe with similar ingredients that I really like.   The only thing I did differently was to use skirt steak, as I could not find flank steak at the time.

I made it a second time and tried some modifications.  I had found the sauce to be a bit watery, so the second time I mixed the corn starch into the liquid rather than coating the meat.  It did thicken the sauce, but it was so salty I couldn't eat it.  The meat by itself was good but so tender that I couldn't slice it without it falling apart, but perhaps I cooked it too long.   I'm sure I'll make this again, but I'll go back to the original recipe.

This was delicious!! The only thing is it takes 2 days. I’m a huge believer in 24hrs marinade so don’t rush. Its full of flavor and we had it with white rice. I was going to make chicken fried rice but after tasting it, it would’ve had too much flavor going on. I recommend plain white rice. Probably going to add broccoli next time ??.

I would cut the flank steak from the beginning.  Other than that my family loved it.  It fed us for 3 meals.

Love this recipe! I eliminate a zip lock bag altogether by placing a slow cooker liner in a bowl with the meat and marinade. Cover with a lid and let it soak up all that goodness overnight! Transfer bag to the slow cooker and let go on low for 6 hours. We add broccoli and sesame seeds and serve over rice. A perfect cold weather meal!

After looking at the reviews I only put half the soy sauce. I added extra garlic and ginger because we like bold flavors. I  halfed the sugar because I decided to add the juice of an orange along with the zest. My favorite Mongolian Beef comes from a Thai restaurant where they add citrus flavor.  This recipe turned out fine, but still not enough flavor. If I make it again I will use the recommended amount of soy sauce, leave out the water, put two oranges zested and juiced, and double the garlic and ginger.

This was great and will definitely go on the “make again” list! The only changes I made were: 1) Potato Starch instead of Corn Starch (corn allergy). 2) Served over Angel Hair Pasta instead of rice (rice allergy). 3) After finished cooking I poured all the liquid in a large pot and brought to boil to thicken. I needed more potato starch so made a slurry of 1 1/2 T potato starch and 1/8 cup water and 1/8 cup soy sauce. Added to liquid and boiled to thicken. I might not have needed to add more starch had I added what was left of the 1/3 c used for dredging beef.

This is very tasty.  I did not change a single ingredient.  I also did not let it sit for 24 hours.  I just dredged the meat in the corn starch, put the rest of the ingredients in the crock pot and then added the meat.  It was quite good. :)

This was fabulous! I have made this many many times since I found this recipe. I prepare it one day and marinate it overnight in the fridge. I don’t freeze it. I think it’s better than what my favorite Chinese restaurant serves. It is one of my family’s favorites.

I only used 1/4 c brown sugar, doubled the green onions, used broccoli instead of carrots and added 2 tbsp of garlic chilli paste. It was still fairly sweet but it was also very good!

After reading the reviews about the original recipe being too strong and sweet in flavor I decided to make 2 batches for the same large dinner.  One batch with no changes the second with the cut back of brown sugar and soy sauce.  It was unanimous everyone liked the original version the best!

Excellent recipe!  I made it for my Mom & Dad.  My Dad doesn't like to try new dishes, but even he loved it.  The only things I changed were I used ground ginger instead of fresh because that was what I had on hand and I used low sodium soy sauce. I also cooked it in a skillet instead of the slow cooker because the electric was out all day. I will be making this again!

Made this for dinner the other night.  Amazing.  Meat was so tender.  I followed the recipe with the potion of the brown sugar.  I used less as suggested by another user.  Added this recipe to my favorites.  YUMMY!

I cut the sugar and soya sauce to a half cup each. My soya sauce was already low sodium. Still quite salty and a tad too sweet for me. Cooked it for 6 hours in the slow cooker on low.  Came out like a glob. Cornstarch should be added towards the end of cooking.  I won't make again.

Tender, tasty, and great on rice but too sweet even with less sugar.  Try 1/3c instead of 3/4c.  Could have used a few red-pepper flakes.

Made this using 1 lb of cheap lean cut of beef (steak) and didn't have time to marinate it.  I cut the meat in 1" thick strips, coated each piece in cornstarch, then put all ingredients in crockpot.  
I used 1/4 cup of low sodium Soy Sauce, 1/4 cup Brown Sugar and 1/3 cup of water, together with chopped sweet Onion (didn't have green onion), Carrot, fresh Ginger, EVOO, and 1 Garlic clove (hubby dislikes garlic).  Part way through cooking, I tasted the sauce and felt it needs a little extra flavor, so I added 1 Tbsp Hoisin sauce.  
OMG, this was sooo delicious.    Definitely will make again.

I will make it again. Will do people's suggested changes including a bit more water and a little less soy sauce. I also cut up some carrots and added snap peas. Recommended.

I made it just as the recipe calls for.  It is delish !!  Flank steak is on the pricey side so the next time I made it I used a chuck roast semi frozen, sliced against the grain.   The meat was tender and delicious.   I shared this recipe with my aunt and her family loves it too!!   Visiting my son and family soon, and plan on making this for them, I know they will enjoy this.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

Wonderful recipe.   The only change I made was using half and half regular soy sauce and light (this is not sodium reduced) soy sauce.  This has a great taste and so easy to make.

should have followed others advice, this really was too salty and sweet, I recommend more water, less sugar and a low sodium soy. Love this recipe otherwise as you can prep the meat and marinate when you bring the meat home, and just throw in the slow cooker whenever you're ready to enjoy. For those who like some heat, I would try other suggestions to add Cayenne or other pepper, this recipe should be good for it.

This was a great receipe.  I  thickened the sauce with a little corn starch after cutting the meat and putting back in the crock pot for the last 1/2 hour.  I did not freeze mine.

Wow!  Utterly fantastic.  I never would have imaged that we could make food like this at home.  My husband and I followed the recipe exactly as it’s written.  We served it over rice and had a side of teriyaki noodles.  What an excellent meal!  We look forward to having leftovers tomorrow.  We will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  I didn't marinate anything, just mixed the seasoning per instructions and tossed everything in the crock pot for 4 hours on low heat.

I made it. The family liked it and the picky children had seconds. I wasn't a huge fan because it tasted like BBQ beef over rice not Mongolian beef. That being said it was okay just not what I was expecting.

Loved it! However, in order to reduce the sodium a bit I used only 1/4 cup of soy sauce and substituted coconut aminos for the remaining half cup.  I didn’t shake the beef in the cornstarch, instead, before putting the water, soy sauce, and coconut aminos in the slow cooker, I whisked in the corn starch.  I also used an extra 1/2 lb. of beef and there was more than enough sauce; in fact, next time I may try adding even more beef.

This is delicious and so easy.  I've made it about 5 times, but have never managed to plan well enough that I make the marinade and throw the whole thing in the freezer.  I make this recipe and put it in the slow cooker right away.  It always turns out really well.  I've made it with different cuts of meat and every single time, it's been really good.  We like it with cooked broccoli rather than the shredded carrots.  I do cut back a little on the sugar as that seemed like a good suggestion.

I made this exactly as the recipe said and it was really... really odd. I had it in the freezer for 2 days.

It tasted ok, but it smelled AWFUL while it was cooking, almost sickly. It made me nauseous. I had to force myself to even try it. Again, it tasted ok... I just don't think I'll ever make it again. I'm not sure if I'll eat the leftovers either.

This was pretty good.  I especially liked that it was easy.  It wasn't a delicious meal, but it was good.  Something seemed to need tweaking.  Maybe a low sodium soy sauce would have made it taste better.

This turned out pretty good. I didn't marinade the meat, as the instructions suggested. I sliced and seasoned the meat, cooked it in my crockpot on low for 1 hour. Then I added the marinade (soy sauce, worcestershire, Henz 57, and 1 cup of brown sugar, which I whisked in a bowl.) I cooked that for another hour on low. Then at hour 3, I added 4 sliced green peppers and 3 onions, and cooked for 2 more hours on low. The meat was super tender and tasted great. Now more going to the Golden Pavilion - I've got this....

This was very good. I made it fresh after marinating the flank steak, did not freeze mixture. Then assembled all in crock, I added 1 tsp of Asian 5 spice. Served over rice. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

This was good and meat came out very tender, however it is just not my kind of thing.  I added snow peas to the mixture and they added a nice touch giving it more vegetables.  My husband liked it more than I did.  Probably not making this one again.

Really liked this dish. Next time I will not put all the required brown sugar. Little to sweet for us. Otherwise this was a very good and easy dish. In the directions, did not state to slice the meat. I don't know if that was assumed or not, but I cut against the grain.

OMG, it was so good.  I didn't freeze it I let it marinate for 2 hours and then cooked it on high in the slow cooker.  During the last 1/2 hour I added onion, a red pepper and some hot pepper.   I also added some Japanese noodles to the cooker. 
 My son said "it's addicting".  My brother said I could do it again.  There were  left overs which were even better.  Next time, I'll cook it the  day before, let it sit overnight and serve it the next day.  And I'll  also add peanuts for the crunch.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a good recipe to start from, I changed a few things to my taste.  I/4 cup less sugar, 4 cloves of garlic, more fresh ginger, a whole orange and lemon sliced, about a cup of fresh sliced pineapple and 1!tsp salt.
 I used bear meat instead of beef, that turned out remarkably well. The kids loved it and bragged about having Mongolian Bear for supper

Everyone was very pleased with the flavor profile and tenderness of the meat.  I will make this again, not just because it was easy, but because it is a really good dish.  
I basically followed the recipe - however, I used 2 lbs. of flank steak, almost a cup of shredded carrots, and more spring onions and a large sweet onion. Things I would do the next time:  1) dice up the shredded carrots in much smaller pieces (the ones I used were prepackaged and about 2" long); 2) add more spring onions; 3) wait until the last 1.5 hours (cooking on low) to add the large onion (which I sliced and cut to make long strings) - hopefully this will allow the onion strings to maintain some degree of firmness; 4) we would like the sauce to be thicker, so I may either mix some additional corn starch with the water; or remove the sauce from the crockpot into a sauce pan heat and add cornstarch to achieve the desired thickness; and last, my wife wants me to slice the meat much thinner.

My whole family loved this! It was super easy to make. The only thing I changed was the meat, I just used the beef I had on hand rather than flank steak.  Will for sure make it again and double it up to freeze some.

a bit salty, but either cutting down on the soy and substituting with water, or using low sodium soy was an easy fix. otherwise perfect, tender beef!

I really liked the taste of the sauce and I didn't think I would. Next time I'm going to cut the baby carrots in fourths because I could hardly see them. The green onions were lost in the sauce. I ate this over brown rice and it was really good.

This did not turn out as I expected of one of my favorite dishes (my standard is the little family-run restaurant down the street).  The cornstarch turned the marinade into sludge, and except for the bright notes of the fresh ginger, the flavors smudged into nothingness.  Next time I'll either make it the traditional way (which I have done with success), or just stop at the restaurant and have it quicker and almost as inexpensively.  Some things are just not meant for the crock pot!

This came out SO delicious!!! I will admit, I cut back on the soy sauce as it seemed like a lot, but other than that, I stayed pretty true to the recipe and it was wonderful. My husband absolutely loved the flavor and is already asking me to make this one again.

Everybody loved it. Instead of draining the liquid from the slow cooker before serving the meat, I added about 2 cups of precooked rice which quickly soaked up the liquid. This turned it into a one-pot meal. Everybody in my family loved this twist on beef stew.

I reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still extremely sweet. I had to add a little bit to lemon juice and white wine to try and take some of the sweetness away. I'll make it again w/out brown sugar and also reduce the amount of olive oil.

After reading some other reviews I adjusted the salt and sugar. I used 1C water and 1/2 C soy sauce and only 1/2C brown sugar. My family tends to eat more so I made a batch and a half of sauce, used 2 lbs of beef, and added pea pods, broccoli, and more carrots.

Made it in the morning, stuck it in the fridge while we went to church, then put it in the crock pot after church for dinner. I made a double batch,  but used half the amount of required sugar, per other reviewer's recommendations. PERFECT!

The steak was tender but the sauce was way too sweet. I made the recipe as given. If I make it again I will definitely reduce the brown sugar. The only flavor that I could taste was sweetness. Too much sweetness!!

This was a great recipe! I love that you can make it and freeze it for future use. I made night before and put in crock pot next morning, so no freezing. Great flavor. We enjoyed it over noodles. I think it would be great with rice also.

Wow this was really good. I used 1/2 of the amt of soy sauce (low sodium)  made the diffence up with water. And half the brown sugar as well.  Added hot pepper flakes to spice it up. And served it over rice. No left overs here.

This was really good. Only changes is I didn't have flank steak so I used the real thin package of steak I have gotten for stir fry. Plus it's cheaper.  I did end up adding a little beef broth the second night, just to bring back the consistency. We all liked it!

This was disgusting.  If I could give it zero stars, I would. What a waste of a good flank steak.  I cut back the sugar by half and it was still sticky sticky sweet.  It had an odd smell as it was cooking, as well.  I will never do this again.  We are going out to dinner now.

Great basic idea, but way too sweet, and lacks the "punch" of Mongolian Beef. Sauce is a bit  too overpowering to let the taste of the beef come through.

I admit I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce, but I also used less brown sugar than the recipe called for, and it still turned out too sweet.

I knocked off a star because of the wildly inaccurate prep time.  You can only prepare this in five minutes if you ignore the hour-and-a-half it takes to trim and slice the beef into bite-size pieces, grate the carrots and ginger and slice the green onions and garlic, mix everything, and take out and clean up all of the utensils needed for preparation.

I used a sirloin steak a little over two pounds, and increased the other ingredients (except the sugar) accordingly.  I used a sous vide cooker to cook the dish, but right at the end put it into a saucepan and brought it to a quick boil, which left the meat still very tender and cooked to perfection, and thickened the sauce nicely.

Too bad about the sweetness.  Next time, I will limit the sugar to a quarter-cup and use low-salt soy sauce.

I made this for friends (they agreed to be my guinea pigs) and it was really great but a bit too sweet. They loved it. When I make it again I will cut the 3/4 cup of brown sugar down to 1/4 cup.

"Oh Grandad, why don't you make an ordinary beef stew, you know we don't like all those garlicky and spices!!"
Only suggestion, less sugar.

Not a single piece of food left on the plates!!

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish!  It was so easy and the meat melted in your mouth. Next time I will add a little more garlic, put the green onions at the halfway point, as mine all but disintegrated and use some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  It was real runny.  I served it over noodles with steamed broccoli and a cucumber tomato red onion salad.

Very tasty! Next time I will reduce the soy sauce and sugar a little bit, and wait to add the carrots/other veg until closer to the end because they just turned to mush.

Made this today as written except I use low sodium soy sauce.  During the cooking, however, I found this cooks down A LOT, so I made an extra batch of the marinade.  Also, wasn't able to find flank steak, so used skirt steak instead, cutting it into strips.  Almost cooked it *too* long (3 hours), so 2 hours would've worked better.  Served it with white rice, but almost any type of pasta would work, too.   Think I'll add a bit of red pepper flakes next time for a little "nip" to the taste buds. All in all, though, the recipe is a "keeper".

This recipe was fantastic! As soon as we finished dinner, one of my kids said, "will you make this again soon?" I served this over Chinese rice noodles. As another reviewer suggested I used a flat iron steak and I really pounded it out before slicing it into strips. I will probably add a little less soy sauce next time (are used low sodium soy sauce), a tad bit more brown sugar, and probably a cup of water instead of 3/4 of a cup. Definitely worth making and it took a very little time!

Delicious! I cut down on the brown sugar and used pickled ginger (because I already had it). We emptied the crock pot, and that's a rare occurrence.

I also found this recipe way too salty. I actually thought it sounded like too much before I put it together, so I halved the soy sauce. I also dialled down the sugar to balance. I still found this too salty. Perhaps as was suggested by another, low sodium soy sauce would be better. Will have to see. I ended up sieving half the cooked beef and rinsing it and then using a slotted spoon for the rest, and spooned it into some wok stir fried veggies and serving over rice noodels. This helped distribute the salt (the other ingredients needed a boost which I deliberately had left off knowing how salty the sauce and meat was.) All in all, this was an okay recipe, but it really does need tweaking to be palatable.

I am NOT a beef lover, husband is  - unless it's the best cut and chews like butter. So! I was amazed that this cut of beef came out so tender and I loved the flavors. Saved this recipe and getting ready to make it again!

As others noted, I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup .  The sauce was watery so I had to thicken.  Also, I should have used flank, but all I had on hand was London Broil and it was a little tough.

nice recipe :) it's very sweet and savoury
I used sweet soy sauce (ketjap manis) instead of regular soy sauce and sugar. I used more carrots and spring onion than written in the recipe (250 grams of carrots, 4 green onions)  also added some bell peppers in the last 30 minutes. I image broccoli will also taste great with this so I'll add that next time!

I used thin cut chicken breast instead. I doubled the sauce (because I like a lot of juice over my rice), however next time I will double everything except the water. Also I added my veggies (broccoli, onions,  and green onions) about an hour left to go on the cooking time. A lot of reviewers complained about it being too sweet, I didn't find it was too sweet... Mongolian dishes I usually order are sweet... so it was perfect!

This is surprisingly good.  Other than the prep time was extended to overnight.  The reward once placed into our crock pot the sauces are simply wonderful.   

Recommend Jasmine rice as the accompaniment.

Way too salty, and the texture was goopy and unpleasant. I followed the directions, cooked it on low for four hours, but it tasted vaguely burnt. Nothing like any Mongolian beef I've ever had, and nothing remotely resembling the picture.

This was very easy , and taste was incredible. I used organic beef from our University Agricultural Program, half the price and so fresh!! 
I even took some of the Medallion Steaks to California and cooked the recipe  for my son and his wife. He is a BIG MEAT eater and loved, loved loved it!! I have made it with mashed potatoes and egg noodles either way it's awesome!!

First and foremost, MADE AS THE RECIPE DIRECTS!  WITH ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS AND NO ADDITIONS OR SUBTRACTIONS!

The beef cooked perfect at 4.5 hours on low.  My shredded carrots disappeared in the cooking process.  I'd add them with an hour to go and hope they still show up.  The sauce was a little off.  Kind of salty even with low sodium soy sauce.  I'm going to work on the sauce because I really liked how the beef turned out. 

THANK YOU.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!  I made it exactly as the recipe directed.  I steamed broccoli and added it to the crock pot for the last hour. Served with Jasmine rice.  This will be a staple in our home

There are only 2 of us and half of this recipe made a great dinner for us! I had a boneless chuck roast that was a little too big for the two of us for pot roast so I used some of that instead of the cut mentioned in the recipe. Also, I added a little bit of oyster sauce. It was wonderful!

I used ginger powder it worked out fine also my beef was stew type and that was great.  Husband loved it I'm not a beefeater but tasted it and it was yummy! May try shrimp(jumbo) next time. Cooked it for at least 5 hours. It was tender and melt in your mouth! Flavours were awesome!

Will definitely make this again.  Would probably cut the sugar content a little, add red and yellow peppers the last hour of cooking.  It was a hit for sure

Used 1.5 cup water.  Used Angus top sirloin I had in freezer.  Cut up in strips. Used 1/4 maple syrup.  Used 1/2 low sodium soy and 12 coconut aminos to cut down sodium (will try homemade soy sauce next time). Marinated a little over 24 hrs.  Just put meat in ziplock and then cornstarch and shook.  Then added rest of ingredients.  Added some red pepper flakes.  Cooked on stove top in cast iron dutch oven.  Cooked about 20 min, then added carrots, red bell pepper, green onions and mushrooms.  Cooked about 15 - 20  minutes more.  Delicious!  Served over white rice for hubby and cauliflower rice for me.

Loved the concept!  Made it, though used our spicy, homemade teriyaki sauce:)
Added veggies last 20 minutes to maintain crispness.

Made this recipe exactly as written.  Like others have said, very sweet and very salty (due to soy sauce and thus 4 stars)but it tasted so good! I'd probably go with a low-sodium soy sauce next time.  Cooked on high in slow cooker.  At 2 1/2 hours, meat was still tough.  Twenty minutes more made all the difference!  Served this over broccoli and rice.  Will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe except for some minor changes. I halved the brown sugar as others suggested. The sweetness was perfect. I pre-sliced some of the steak and it came out more tender that what was cooked whole. However the steak that wasn't pre-sliced was still very tender. It was cooked on high for 3 hours and we threw in some broccoli florets for the last hour. The deliciousness of this meal was as good as any I've had in a Chinese restaurant. I will definitely make this again.

I liked this, but made a couple of modifications by necessity and chance.  All I had was 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce and I wouldn't change that.  I did not have brown sugar, so I used less raw natural sugar instead, 1/2 cup.  Wasn't too salty or too sweet.  I put the meat whole in the freezer for a couple of hours, which made it easier to slice thinly.  Using the right knife to slice it made slicing effortless.  (The long thin bladed knife, perhaps it is called a slicing knife!)  I used slightly more corn starch, so all the meat would be coated.  Besides, I wanted the sauce to be thick like a gravy.  What I will do differently next time:  I'll marinate the meat overnight, then remove it and freeze it a couple of hours to slice before reuniting it with its marinate in the crock.

I did not like this recipe at all, too much soy for our tastes.
The recipe was not clear on certain aspects of prep either,
I sliced the flank steak prior to cooking it, so with the type of sauce it was, it turned to mush before the 3 hour cook time was up.  This recipe was nothing like the Mongolian Beef I have had in the past, many years ago.  I realized that when I had it last, the beef was cooked on a grill kind of like they did at a long ago popular restaurant, the one with knives flying in the air.....
Anyway this was entirely different and I won't be fixing it again.

I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 c and the soy sauce to 1/2 c. I added 1/4 c of hoisin sauce and about a tsp of red pepper flakes for some heat. I also added a pound of sliced button mushrooms.

This is one of the most delicious things I've ever made in a slow cooker. The sauce was rich and thick and packed with flavor. Even using less soy sauce, this is still plenty salty if you taste the sauce alone, but it is perfect when paired with plain rice. Reduced-sodium soy sauce is a good option if you want less salt, or just use less soy sauce. If you add mushrooms like I did, remember that they will give off a good bit of water. I just made sure the steak was well-coated in cornstarch and it was fine.

This is a real winner. With the adjustments I made, this will be a constant go-to.

The only change I made was to add a splash of red wine to the crock pot after adding the marinade and beef. My wife says this is the best beef recipe I've tried yet and to definitely make it again.

Never had Mongolian beef before so I'm unsure how its supposed to taste. I do know that I really liked it. and will make it again. I cooked it as written and saw no need to change anything .

This was super easy, and very delicious. I went straight to crock pot and after about 3 and half hours, it was done.  Chopped some green onions over the top and served over steamed rice. Yummy!!!

I've never had Mongolian Beef before so I'm really not sure how it compares.  I didn't have any cornstarch so I used flour.  I also cut the sugar down.  (I know I didn't follow the recipe)  I also used low sodium soy sauce yet I found the recipe to be a too salty for me.  The beef was tender, I served it over riced cauliflower.  Not sure if I'd make it again, but it was definitely easy & tasty.

It is a single dinner recipe but when I try to print it the measurements are way off  it comes out to 121/2 cups corn starch and 75 pounds of meat .  what is wrong with the recipes on your site that it makes any copy go to a large crowd amount s.

This isn't Mongolian beef, as written.  Mongolian beef has quite a bit of hot to it which this recipe doesn't.  Agree with  others to reduce soy sauce and  brown sugar considerably, and add some cayenne  or hot peppers to liven it up.

I got tired of the taste very quickly. Seemed too sweet. Maybe add vinegar. I added water chestnuts and pea pods to the leftovers and that help a bit. Definitely needs some tweaking. I'm guessing you could use any cheap roast, cut thinly, to get the same taste. Flank steak is too good (and expensive) too waste on this recipe.

Not a real fan of this recipe - tastes like something is missing.  Too much soy sauce?  No depth to the flavor,  My Take-out place is much better.  Will try again with less soy, maybe add ginger, some green onions?  Not sure, will play with it a bit. Not a bad recipe just not worth 5 stars.

The flavor was delicious.  I added a little Sambal Oelek chili paste for a little kick.  I couldn't figure out the best way to cut the flank steak.  I ended up cutting across the grain, but it just didn't have the same texture as true Mongolian Beef.  Will definitely make it again!

This was a super easy meal that had both my kids taking seconds! Per the note at the bottom of the recipe, you don't have to prep and freeze in advance, you can put it straight in the crock pot and go, which is what I did. The meat ended up tender and delicious.  I served it over white rice.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Adjusting for my tastes I used a 1/3 cup of brown sugar, loosely packed and added 1 cup of hoisin sauce.  I also used more carrots and green onion and shook the steak strips in ziploc bags to coat with cornstarch.  I had the finished recipe over both rice and also Chinese egg noodles.  Very delicious and I will definitely make again!

I made this for dinner and stuck to the original recipe to try it out...it was definitely not a favorite of ours. The meat was tender which was great but it had absolutely no flavor. It wasn't so bad that we couldn't eat it, but we decided not to keep the leftovers...

I modified this to what some other reviewers did - 1/2 soy sauce, 1/2 loose brown sugar and 2 cups water.  I added baby carrots an hour before ready time, but they weren't ready in an hour, so it was longer and that made the meat shred.  The taste was delicious though and served on rice with broccoli on the side.

Used a slightly different cut of meat, and then had it marinate over night (ran out of time to cook). Other than that, no changes. We both agreed it was delicious. Going to try it with venison and chicken next! ***Update*** Used venison. So tender and delicious. This will definitely be our favorite way to use venison!

This is a recipe to remember. It isn't very different than other mandarine dishes I know, but the spring onions in the marinade made the difference (made me make a spring onion ice-cream).
I changed the liquids amounts to 1.5 cups of water, 1/2 cup of soy and sugar each. I also recommend to add much more vegetables - carrots and maybe potatoes as well.
Perfect yum.

I used a London broil and this turned out wonderfully. I served it with broccoli and rice with egg rolls on the side. I followed the recipe and the flavor was great.

I made it following the recipe except, as several reviewers recommended, reduced the sugar and soy sauce by 1/4 cup, and put it directly in the slow cooker.  It was still a bit salty so I would use low-sodium soy sauce but otherwise delicious. Family loved it.

I'll make this dish again for sure. I only used 1/2 cup soy sauce and 1/2 cup sugar. I also used 1 1/2 cups of water. Next time I'll only use 1/3 cup of sugar or less.  Depends on how sweet you like the meat.

Made this up camping in the Dutch oven and it turned out well. I would have only recommend to add more water to make a sauce to put on top.

I had to use a rump roast since I could not find the flank steak.  I cut the roast into strips and marinated it in the frig for about 36 hours.  I also added the carrots and green onion towards the last hour of cooking.  Would definitely make again.

After reading through many of the comments  I thought I would reduce the sugar, soy sauce and increase water. But in the end I just followed recipe and it turned out very well. Tasty dish, sauce reduced enough and was nicely sticky. The only things I did differently was to increase fresh ginger to one Tablespoon (only because I grated too much), and added extra shredded carrots & chopped spring onions, and a can of baby corn  one hour before serving.  Very good. Will make again.

The flavor was very good. I stuck to the recipe and didn't find it too sweet or salty. I may have cooked it too long in the slow cooker because it had the consistency of pot roast. I think next time I will cook it in a skillet to caramelize the marinade on it.

Made this dish a little last minute. I cooked it the same night. Recommend a 20 minute prep for all ingredients. (I'm not fast in the kitchen).  The dish was fabulous. My husband loved it. Will definitely do this recipe again.

I made the adjustments suggested by others to cut down on the soy and sugar to 1/2 cup each.  Beef was tender and flavorful.  Added carrots and baby peas at end of cooking (about a half hour before completion) and served over rice.  We'll make this one again!

Great recipe and easy to make.  I agree with others, however, that it is far too salty.  Cut soy sauce and brown sugar in half,  double the water.

I made it exactly as stated using skirt steak.  It was delicious, and my family loved it.  I served it with Jasmine Rice and sautéed Bok Choy. If serving without the rice, I would reduce soy sauce for less saltiness (I used Tamari) DELICIOUS AND EASY!!

I did make changes based on some of the other reviews. I decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, decreased the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and increased the water to 1 1/2 cups. My 2 and 4 year old extremely picky eaters ate it and liked it. Need I say more.

It was quite good, even with our "tweaking." - I too would halve the amount of sugar listed. We added Sriracha sauce for a bit of heat. I zested a lime (not needed), and used the juice of a whole lime (that would have been enough. It could use some kosher salt (no much), or a bit of beef stock just a hint to offset the sweetness. Other than that, the beef was so tender (after 8 hrs. on low). Yum. Will make it again.

Made this today for Sunday dinner and it was a big hit with my daughter, her boyfriend and my wife. I used about 2.5 lbs of flank steak (for leftovers) and added 3 cups of water and more shredded carrots but other than that left he brown sugar, soy sauce, etc... the same. Substituted Splenda brown sugar.

Made it exactly as written except I used a low sodium soya sauce and only put onions in during last 35-40 minutes.

I made wide noodles and steamed some fresh broccoli during the last hour of slow cooking. It's a great meal to take to a sick friend, as I did.

decreased the amount of soy sauce & brown sugar by 1/4 cup each and added an extra 1/2 cup of water (next time I think I will change the water to Beef Broth) and will increase the garlic and ginger a little.  All in all it was a very nice meal.   I have a large crock pot which was just to big for this meal so I put the meal in a ceramic oven proof bowl and then put that into the crock pot and cooked it (it worked great)  Very tender!!!

This was fantastic exactly as the recipe was written.   All of my family, even the picky eaters, loved it and asked to have it again soon!  he next time I might try using a slightly better cut of meat as I don't care much for the tougher ones- they still taste too tough, unless I've cooked them into bits, but that is strictly my personal preference.  I found this to be excellent, with a good mix of flavors, and super-easy to make. Thanks Stephanie!

I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was still a little sweet for us. I didn't freeze it but I did let it marinate over night. then cooked it for 5 hrs on low in my slow cooker. oh yes, I also used a buffalo roast cut into cubes instead of the steak. i'll make it again but will cut the sugar even more.

Followed others advice and cut the sugar by half, maybe I would cut it even a tablespoon more. Increase the water and cut the low salt soy sauce by half as well. I also added almost 8 ounces of mushrooms and a yellow pepper. It was delicious I will definitely make it again it made a delightful brown gravy.

I haven't made this yet ,but it looks good. I too may skip the freezer part and just marinade it over night. But the freezer option is a good idea for the busy family cook.
The only change I'll make is I'll use beef broth instead of water.. Thats something I do all the time.... I'll let you know how mine comes out... I'm sure its going to be worthy of a 5 star Rating...

I found the recipe too liquidy.  Since meat in a slow cooker releases liquid, it is probably best to cut down on water altogether and let the meat juices blend with other ingredients.  It would also concentrate flavors--as prepared, i found the meat almost flavorless.    I didn't find the meat sweet and besides you need that amount to give the sauce a semi-sticky quality, as prepared in a restaurant.   Meat was tender, cooked on HI in slow cooker but I was disappointed in flavor.

Terrific. Low sodium soy and cut the sugar by a third. Add in red peppers and onion at the end. Winner.

Will definitely make this again.  Cut down on the sugar and soy as suggested.  Also might add a little red pepper flakes to spice it up like mongolian beef in the restaurants.  Good slow-cooker recipe.

I I read all the reviews, so when I made it, I reduced the amount of brown sugar and soy sauce, as suggested by many other reviewers. The finished dish was very bland and not at all interesting. I added back the amounts of brown sugar and soy sauce in the original recipe, and it was delicious!  I would highly recommend using this recipe as written. I will definitely make this again.

Easy and very tasty.   I used 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce because I did not have soy sauce and reduced sugar to 1/2 cup per other reviews.  Whole family enjoyed it served over egg noodles with peas.  This recipe will be going into my weeknight rotation.

This was quite good! I only used a pound of beef since it's just 2 of us,  but I kept the gravy the same amount. The only issue I had was that it never thickened. I'm guessing because I followed someone's review that called for twice the water. But, no matter, about an hour before I finished cooking it I just added more starch and it was fine. I added onions and red bell pepper in the last hour.  Fantastic recipe!

Followed others' leads by reducing sugar and soy sauce.  Added a sliced jalapeno, pepper flakes, chili paste and sweet chili sauce. Needed a lot more cornstarch to thicken it to our liking. Used stir-fry beef. Couldn't find flank steak. Good basic recipe to tweak as you like. Will make again.

This was great.  I did reduce the soya and brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  Added 1 tsp of chopped garlic with ginger and chili, 1 tsp of chili garlic, and 1 tsp chopped garlic in place of garlic and ginger
