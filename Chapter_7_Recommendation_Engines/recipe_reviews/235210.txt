I'll have to admit- I was a bit skeptical when contemplating baking the french toast fluffin but now that I have I must say they are fabulous! Crisp browned skin on top, rich and creamy ample filling-My girlfriend Daisy also made a batch and I ate all of those too! Just a tad bit yeasty, but hey-I like the taste of yeast for a late night snack anyways! I did not use corn oil because I don't believe in corn.

My whole family loved these! They came out perfectly with no adjustments.  I enjoy them without syrup, but my kids and husband like to dip them.

I bought turkey maple links vs.  pork to bring the fat content down (by 1/4!!), and substituted 1 cup ww flour for 1 cup of regular flour (the Fleischmann's website says you can do this; I don't see it on allrecipes, although there is an asterisk by the flour ingredient, so perhaps this option was accidentally left out?). Anyhow, they smelled amazing and looked absolutely gorgeous. I dipped in syrup. But the taste is very, very...yeasty, at the risk of sounding "duh". As in, it's actually kind of sour. I had to use a lot of syrup for dipping. Very odd. I would love to find out/figure out a good fix for these, like adding more sugar.

I love this recipe! I made a few changes to suit my family's tastes. I added 2 tablespoons of sugar in the dough mixture and used ground sausage instead of links, other than that I followed the recipe as written. We didn't notice any yeast taste at all. This will become a regular in our special Sunday breakfasts.

Fun and yummy take on breakfast casserole. I used spicy crumbled sausage instead of links. So good!

Also, I added about two tablespoons of syrup to the butter before I melted it. It made a nice, sweet glaze for the top of the fluffins.

I can't eat sausage so I used 3/4 cup of raisins instead. We really enjoyed these but I had to add 1/2 cup milk extra as the batter was way too dry. I would definitely recommend using a stand mixer versus a hand held mixer as I started with that and almost burned out the motor. 30 minutes was perfect in my stove. I used vanilla sugar for the white sugar and omitted the extract. Next time I would use butter for the oil and add an extra tbsp of sugar.

It was kind of bland. I think I would add more cinnamon next time.

Made this to bring to Easter brunch. Turned out good. Didn't taste yeasty like other reviews said. Definitely need to use stand mixer not hand mixer! Think next time I will add lil more sugar and some cinnamon to the dry ingredients. May even try splitting it into more than just twelve muffin tins to make them a little smaller. I would make this again for a party
