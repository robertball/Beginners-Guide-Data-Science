GREAT cake. It's easy to make but tastes like it came from a 5-star bakery. I'd cut down on the poppy seeds though. 1/3 cup works well.

This cake is fantastic!  I went searching for it to make for mother's day (lemon poppyseed is a favorite of hers).  I normally dislike lemon anything and even I loved this cake.  It was hit with the whole family.

My mother liked it so much she made it the next week for her card party and has requested it for her upcoming birthday.

It is moist, light and lemony.  As a previous reviewer wrote - don't be alarmed when it shrinks.  It will shrink significantly, but don't worry, you will need the room for the filling and topping.

I made this twice in the past few weeks.  Everyone loved it!  Once, I put half in the freezer and it came out again just fine.  Don't be alarmed if the cake shrinks dramatically when you take it out of the oven - leaves plenty of room for the toppings.  I used pie filling from a mix rather than the canned.

This cake was a HUGE hit with my family....I made it last year for Easter and they have demanded I make it again. I made this into a layer cake putting the lemon pie filling in between the two round cakes then cool whip mix on top.  I garnished the top with lemon wedges and blackberries....was so pretty and springy!

I made this recently for my grandmother's birthday. The cake was AMAZING and got rave reviews from everyone. Someone even thought I had bought it at the go-to bakery in town... it was just that good! I did cut the poppyseed down to 1/3 c., but otherwise made as directed. I'll definitely revisit this recipe many times in the future!

I must be missing something!!  I thought it was odd that the recipe calls for 3.4oz package of pudding when the grocery store sells 1oz or 1.5 oz.  But I went with it anyway and bought 3 small boxes of vanilla and 3 small boxes of lemon.  I mixed the cake mix and thought it was a bit thick.  oh well.  But then making the 'mousse' I figured something is NOT right.  3 boxes of pudding with 1 cup of milk of coarse makes paste.  'Fold' in whipped topping??  Not happening! Just made a less thicker paste.

I loved this cake and so did every one in my office.  I followed the other's advice and used only 1/3 c. poppy seeds, which was plenty.  I also used fat free vanilla pudding and light cool whip and it turned out great. They want me to make this again!!!

Made this dessert for Easter and it went over well with everyone.  Had a bit of a strange experience with the cake--it originally raised up so far that I didn't think I would have room to put any of the toppings on it.  However, after taking it out of the oven, the cake fell--I was afraid the whole things would be ruined.  But as it turned out, I had plenty of room for the toppings, and it was a great success!  I think it could have used more than 1 can of the lemon pie filling--maybe a can and a half to two cans....otherwise it was fantastic.

I thought this was a wonderful cake.  It was light and moist.  I only wish the cake itself had a bit more lemon flavor.  This will be very nice on a hot summer day. Please note it takes about 5 hours to prepare not 50 minutes.

I've made this cake 3 times--once as written, once making the cake with 1/3 c oil, 1 cup water and 2 TBS. poppy seeds (I always use Duncan Hines cake mixes), replaced canned lemon pie filling with 1 large (cook kind) lemon pudding mix and the same frosting and once with a Yellow Cake mix, instant lemon pudding, 1/3 c oil, 1 cup water and 2 TBS. poppy seeds, replaced canned lemon pie filling with 1 large (cook kind) lemon pudding mix and the same frosting.  They're all great (and easy).  I'll continue to use less oil, water and poppy seeds and replace the the canned pie filling with 1 large Jello Brand Lemon (cook kind) Pudding Mix and use the same frosting mix.  Great recipe!

I admit that I am a total snob about cake mixes however I had very little time to put together a dessert for a pot-luck dinner so ran to the store for the ingredients for this cake.  It's good!  I messed up and used the amount of eggs/water on the cake box (3 eggs, three quarters cup of water) which differed from the recipe but the cake was still fine.  I'm not crazy about the taste of instant lemon pudding so I added a bit of fresh grated lemon rind.

SUPER-moist cake, topping OK - everybody LOVED IT!!!  I will definitely be making this again, but perhaps without the whipped topping/lemon mousse on top.  Could I use real whipped cream instead?  Maybe that would taste better than the CoolWhip (regular) that I used.

I made this cake for a party this weekend and everyone raved about it.  The only change I made was using cherry pie filling because the grocery store did not have lemon pie filling.  It turned out great and added a great flavor to it.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Possibly my favorite desert of all times.  We usually make it with one of those pans that leave a dome on the inside for filling the inside of the cake after baking (they are on TV all the time) or with a bundt pan using the middle for the pie filling.  Absolutely awsome.

I liked this cake alot. I served it to 12 gals for Bunco. Half loved it, but me and the other gals thought the lemon filling was too much. I agree> The cool whip frosting was so delicious and the cake so moist I think it took away from the taste. I will make again, probably leave off filling, or maybe cut cake in half and lightly layer the filling there.

Tried to make as bundt cake but didn't work, ended up cutting up cake and using lemon and topping as layers in cups like a trifle. Delicious.

This was a great, light tasting alternative for a holiday meal.  I followed a few reviewer suggestions and substituted some apple sauce for 1/2 cup of the oil.  It was a delicious cake, and I was already asked for the recipe.  Thanks, and I will make this again.

The cake alone was really good. I used a different frosting recipe and regretted it. Next time I will use the one that goes with this recipe.
I made this again with the frosting that goes along with this recipe, and it was very tasty!

I used Yellow Cake Mix and Lemon Instant Pudding, it was all I had.  I only used 1/4 cup Poppyseeds, which was more than enough.  I used 1 tsp almond extract.  I made mine in 2 round pans.  After cooling, I spread a layer of lemon filling in between and dusted the top with powdered sugar.  It was excellent.

This was a good recipe! You really do only need 1/4 cup of poppy seeds, though. Also, I found the taste of artificial lemon-flavoring a bit overpowering for my own taste, even for a lemon cake. Next time, I'm going to mix the whipped  cream with vanilla pudding instead of lemon and see if that can cut the artificial lemon flavor a bit and add a little sweetness. BTW, the longer the cake is in the fridge, the better it tastes. I'd suggest making it a good 24hrs ahead of serving time.

I couldn't find canned lemon pie filling so I used a box.  I took this to a potluck. Several people said they would give it a 4, but I just don't think it rates 5 stars.

thank you bea for this recipe! it made my boyfriend love me even more than he already did...i used this recipe to make a birthday bundt cake, and added a lemon-sugar glaze (poked holes first), then the amazing frosting. i used organic whipping cream instead of cool whip. this was the BEST cake i have EVER had. period.

This was a huge hit at our last family get together...everyone loved the light lemon flavor.  I didn't use all of the lemon pie filling because I thought that it was going to be too much, but after cutting into it, I should have followed the recipe and used the whole can.

In my opinion, this was a little over the top for me with all the lemon products added in. It was fine but just too much going on for my personal tastes.

I made this for my wife's birthday. It was very easy to make, which was good since I haven't cooked anything this complicated since Reagan was prez. Seriously. Anyway, everyone really loved it. The only thing I will do next time is put less whipped topping on it, although everyone else said it was great the way it was.

Loved this cake...followed the recipe to the letter. It was a huge hit...my kids and grandkids LOVED it and so did the kids next door. 
It makes a light refreshing lemony dessert, all the layers work well together. If you are a lemon lover...this is a dessert cake for you!

Simple, simple, simple and ever so tasty!  I had limited time and needed to make a good portion of SOMETHING for a bake sale. I made this cake in a bundt pan and sprinkled powdered sugar on top. DONE!  It was moist and delicious. And simple!
Beware! When baking in the bundt pan. Cool COMPLETELY in the pan before putting it on a plate. The cake is SO moist, it will fall apart if not completely cooled.

This was just ok. Made it as written. It's too sweet, too artificial, with too many non-pantry items to buy. In the end I much prefer my scratch made lemon loaf for a lemon fix.

I followed the recipe as is, and it was delicious.My husband probably ate two-thirds of the cake himself. If you like lemon desserts  or lemon poppyseed bread/muffins, you will love this recipe. The only thing I will do differently next time is add a little freshly squeezed lemon juice and some  lemon zest to the whip cream mixture. I love it when lemon desserts are a bit more tart.

Made this cake for a potluck.....rave reviews, and several recipe requests.  I cut the poppy seeds to 1/3 cup, as recommended by others, and that was plenty.  Couldn't find canned lemon pie filling, so made cooked lemon pie filling and cooled it, stirring frequently so it didn't set - it worked fine.  Also - no Cool Whip in my house....real whipped cream only!  Great dessert.

Re the 2011 reviewer who could only find one-ounce boxes of pudding, multiplied them by 3 to get the right amount and then ended up with horrible paste instead of batter--I think that baker misread the labels and bought sugar-free pudding mix, which does come in a lighter weight box than regular instant pudding.

I made this for a co-worker friend's birthday.  She likes lemon desserts, and they have to have a lot of lemon flavor, but not the in-your-face kind.  She also had associated lemon poppy seed cakes or loaves with dryness, and she wanted a moist cake.  This dessert knocked the socks off of everybody at work, and the birthday girl loved it!  I made 2 cakes, so I could taste it to make sure it would be a hit, and even bought a package of Costco lemon bites, which she loves, as a backup dessert, in case the cakes didn't turn out.  I only had a tall bottle of poppy seeds, so I used half in each cake, which came out to less than 1/4 c. per cake and it was perfect.  I would make this cake again anytime.  My friend thought it was good enough to be served at a wedding reception.  My family of chocoholics loved it, too!  I cooked it for 35 minutes and the toothpick came out clean.  When I cut it, however, the cake looked undercooked.  However, it tasted fine and I think that added to its moistness.  It was delicious!

Wonderful recipe, the only thing I changed: I made my own lemon pie filling because I forgot to pick up the canned at the store- no big deal though, and the recipe turned out perfectly!I halved the ingredients and baked in an 8" square pan, since it was not for a big event or anything.

Took this to a 4th of July picnic and got nothing but rave reviews and brought home a near empty dish to boot! I couldn't find a lemon cake mix so I used a yellow cake mix and 1 oz of lemon extract in it's place. It was still wonderful. Thanks so much for sharing something quick easy and delicious!

I thought this cake was pretty good, but not amazing.  Most of my family really enjoyed it, though, so I may make it again.  If I go all out and make a cake, though, I want an amazing recipe!  All in all, no complaints.

I made this without the poppy seads and I just thought it was OK. I would have liked it the cake was more lemony and less dense.  I also didn't like the fact that it had to be refrigerated for 4 hours.  I think it would have been fine if the cake was served after cooling but still at room temp.

Good cake - I skipped the poppy seeds, and thought that the filling had a bit of a wang, but overall a very refreshing and light dessert!

Made this for a church potluck and it was gone in a flash.  Yummy, easy, and makes a bunch.

I made this and took it to the school where I teach.  It didn't last long!  The only thing I found wrong with it was that it tended to fall apart, it was so tender and soft.
