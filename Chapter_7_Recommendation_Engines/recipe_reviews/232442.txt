Great recipe, I made a few changes adding guacamole & mixing the sour cream with ranch dip mix instead of the onion soup. I used taco mix cheese & added black olives on top. was a hit for a picnic.

This is way too salty for us.  The taco seasoning has salt, the canned beans have salt but the onion soup mix really put this over the top in terms of saltiness.  There are so many layered dips to choose from - but I wanted to give this a try and a picture.  Omitting the onion soup mix and adding the taco seasoning to the sour cream instead of the beans, would help this a lot.  Sorry tanaquil, this just was not for us.
