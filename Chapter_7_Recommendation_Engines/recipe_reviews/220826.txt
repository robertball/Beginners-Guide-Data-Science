This recipe is AMAZING and was a huge hit at my party today! The only thing I did differently was to pre-cook the bacon in the oven, and I sprinkled some pepper, paprika, and garlic powder on the sliced zucchini before baking it. I was looking for just a bit of spice. I didn't even need toothpicks actually- they stayed rolled up perfectly! 

And, a word of advice - you can cut raw zucchini with a cheese slicer! It made slices of the prefect thickness!

These were the first appetizers to go. FANTASTIC!

I really liked this recipe but I like them to taste "zippy". I placed hot pepper rings on top of the cheese and then rolled and secured them with toothpicks.  Before baking, I rolled the sides and top in cajun seasoning. Thank you Raelynne

Good recipe, but I prefer to make it with prosciutto instead of bacon.  You avoid the possible flabbiness of bacon.  Since you want to roll it up, you need to leave the bacon pliable, which means a little bit flabby.  The cheese is smoked anyway, so you don't necessarily need a smoked meat as well.  I like a previous reviewer's idea of sneaking some rings of hot peppers into the roll.  I will try this next time with thinly sliced jalapeno.  This will add a little crunch too.
