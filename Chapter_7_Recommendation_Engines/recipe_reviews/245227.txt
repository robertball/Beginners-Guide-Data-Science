I loved it, my wife and 11 year old grandson...not so much! It's not hard but it is a lot of work. The red beets will stain your hands for a bit.

This was a great recipe and actually super easy even though it takes an hour to roast the beets.  I used an olive oil and balsamic dressing as well as some candied walnuts (love the crunch!).  The golden beets, to me, taste different than red beets and are a must in the recipe.

This recipe was quite good - next time I'll use a different vinegrette and perhaps adding some pickled chanterelles, but all in all very tasty.

This was absolutely a winner!  I couldn't find mache so used watercress instead. plus I used walnuts. Golden beets, and raspberry vinaigrette.  The basic recipe is just SO good!
