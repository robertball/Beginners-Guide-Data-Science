I tried this recipe this morning for my son and I and they were wonderful!!  I especially loved the fact that the ingredients were things I already had in my pantry.  No "fancy" ingredients that I would have to substitute.  But, I did use 1 cup rice milk and 1/4 cup water instead of 1 1/4 cup water.  I found that spreading the batter evenly with the back of a spoon really enabled the pancakes to cook evenly and not stay uncooked in the center. Wonderful recipe. And to the reviewer who stated that just because this was a good vegan subtitute for "normal pancakes" that it wasn't worth 5 stars, I would like to disagree.  I don't think a regular buttermilk pancake is 5 star cuisine.  I feel that vegan recipes are just just as good, if not better than "regular" food.  They are much kinder to your health, the planet, and the animals who would have suffered for that buttermilk.  I think this compares to the best.  5 stars.

i appreciate the effort, but these aren't true vegan.  switch up the white sugar with raw sugar and you've got it true vegan.  i'm not vegan but my sister is, and she won't go near white processed sugar because of the way it's processed....

These were very good pancakes.  I picked the recipe simply because they do not include egg which my son is allergic to. After making the batter I thought it was too thick to actually make "fluffy" pancakes but I was wrong.  They came out very fluffy.  Also, I thought when making the batter that there was way to much sugar but added it all anyway.  I'm glad I did.  They were sweet but not everly so.  Thanks for a great tasting and simple to make recipe.  Will make these often.

I had to add a little bit of soy milk to the batter to make these spread properly on the griddle. I would suggest pouring small amounts of the batter onto the griddle to make flat pancakes. Otherwise they turn out too thick and not cooked properly. I tried these with and without chocolate chips and both were good. However, the plain pancakes had a strangely buttery flavor that was very nice. Just because these are a good vegan substitute for normal pancakes, doesn't mean they are worth 5 stars. Regular buttermilk pancakes are worth 5 stars so we should always compare foods to the best, not just rate them 5 stars because they are "good enough" for vegans. So "5 star vegan" but "3 star universally"

AWESOME! That's what my family says when I tell them we're making pancakes. Finally, a basic recipe that we can easily convert to our alkaline nutrition lifestyle (i.e., no soy, wheat, etc.). My subs: spelt flour (1 1/2C), date sugar or dark agave syrup, himalayan salt, hemp oil, and no oil on our hot griddle (350^F). For each teaspoon of baking powder, I always sub 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice. Sprinkle a few fruit pieces on top after pouring for a treat. We also use the pancakes at supper with onions and green peppers sprinkled. Fluffy and delicious! Yum yum!!

The first time I made these they turned out horrible, but I'm glad I gave it another try. The second time around they were pretty good. I added some vanilla and cinnamon like I always do to pancakes for added flavor. I figured out that these will not get the color of regular pancakes, so if you wait around for them to get golden brown expect to have hockey pucks for breakfast. All in all these were good with a little tweaking. Thanks for the recipe!

LOVED these!  My children are very allergic to all animal products. So, this was great!  I added a 1/2 cup canned pumpkin, 1 cup rice milk.. instead of water.  I also had to add about 1/4 cup flour and 2 tbspns milled flax seed.  They were amazing!  We served them with baked apples on top!  Delicious!

Very good recipe. I used whole wheat flour instead and added 1/4 more flour to make the batter thicker. Definitely will make them again.

These pancakes were AWESOME.  Really!  My stomach doesn't do well with a whole lot of fat so I figured I would give this a try.  I was leary looking at the recipe because there really isn't much to them, but they were DELICIOUS.  The only addition (s) I made was, I added 1t of pure vanilla extract to the wet ingredients and 1 1/2 t of cinnamon to the dry.  I put a little butter on the pancakes and sprinkled brown sugar on top.  Thank you so much for this recipe it really took care of my pancake fix.  I will most definately be making this again.

These are great! Since I was smothering them in syrup, I took another reviewer's advice and used 1.5 c whole wheat flour.  I also added a bit of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and used 1 cup almond milk + 1/2 cup water.  Definitely use a spatula to spread these a little thinner when cooking--the batter is quite thick.

SO YUMMY! SLOWWWWLY converting my 8&5 year olds to vegan/ clean eating. I halfed the recipe (in case they didn't like it). Here are my subs whole spelt flour (same amout). Melted Earth Balance 'butter' spread (I halfed so only 1/2 a tbsp), and organic/vegan/kosher natural sugar. Oh instead of all water, I did half almond milk. And as all pancakes for my sons, added vegan chocolate chips.
My son LOVED them!!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe. And for meanies please do not say I changed the recipe. I DID NOT. I just subbed with my products and I wanted to share in case anyone else is wondering the same. They taste great and my boys who are not open to this change in our food habits ate them allll up!

These really are worth 5 stars for pancakes in general. To ElizzleM-about 50% of processed sugar in America is processed through bone char-look up brands that aren't-such as Pioneer. 
I do like to use soymilk for water adding about 1 teaspoon lemon or vinegar to it to give it a "buttermilk" quality.

So perfect for when you really want pancakes and don't have any eggs or milk/milk substitute in the house! Also works well with white whole wheat and whole wheat pastry flour =)

I thought that these were great! I'm not vegan but I try to eat vegan/vegetarian versions of things whenever possible because it's better for you. I really loved how these came out! The only thing that I changed was I added 3tsp cinnamon but that's only because I eat cinnamon with almost everything (I LOVE it). I think next time i'm going to try using sparkling water instead of regular water to see if they can be even fluffier.

For vegan pancakes these weren't bad, but they were quite bland, the texture was slightly odd & there was too much salt in the recipe. In saying that, if I was making breakfast for a vegan, I would prob come back to this recipe & add some sugar or vanilla, and take out half of the salt. Thanks!!

To make healthier vegan pancakes, replace the oil by adding 3 TBS ground flax seed, use whole wheat pastry flour in place of refined white flour, use 1 TBS Grade B Maple Syrup in place of refined white sugar. 

Please note that when using ground flaxseed the pancakes will tend to brown quicker.

These are the best vegan pancakes I've tried (except white sugar is not vegan - use raw sugar). I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 C oatmeal. also a few handfuls of blueberries. Delicious.

I used half whole wheat flour and used more water (about 1/2 cup extra). My husband said he couldn't tell the difference between these pancakes and "regular" pancakes and the kids gobbled them up, too. I will be making them again!

I did everything exact except that I formatted the recipe for 1 serving and added a bit of chopped banana. I wanted it to taste good, but the texture was gelatin like inside, even after a thorough cooking.

Very yummy!  I am not a vegan, however, I wanted to make pancakes in a pinch and happened to have everything on hand.  Cooked just right these were everything promised: fluffy on the inside, soft and crunchy on the outside!  I also added 1 tsp. honey and 1 T. fresh lemon juice for some zing.  Excellent and I will make these a regular!

These pancakes were delicious...light and fluffy.  I used 1/4 cup of ww flour, cinammon, vanilla, and added blueberries.  For the oil, I used organic virgin coconut oil.  I never missed the egg or milk...they are terrific.  The key is to have a med-high griddle, but not so hot the the pancakes burn.  I will definitely make these again. Yummy!

I followed the recipe as written, but I was not fond of the texture of these pancakes, as they were very chewy.  I gave them two stars, because my daughter liked them.

I'm editing my original review to drop a star.  I made these again and they're really bland and boring.  They're not too flat, but they aren't the fluffy pancakes I'm used to.  The batter as written is a touch on the dry side.  They even look boring - they're just whitish, flat disks on the plate.  I think my first impression of them was based on the fact that they were just a vehicle for really nice toppings, and I also had to add things to the batter to get flavor out of it.  I tasted one as-is today, and they just taste like flour.  I really feel like this is just a good starting point, not a complete recipe.  The batter as-is really *needs* the addition of vanilla and, in my opinion, some sweet spices to bring anything interesting to the table.  I also feel like these may be rated higher because they're vegan, not because they taste good.   
My original review is as follows:  These aren't bad, but they're not great.  I had to add vanilla, cinnamon, & nutmeg to the batter just to get some flavor out of them.  I also subbed 3/4c almond milk for 3/4c of the water, and they still lacked flavor.  Not bad in a pinch, and even worth 4 stars if you top them with sliced bananas, margarine, and blueberry syrup.

These were very good. Instead of adding water, I used vanilla soy milk to give them more flavor and they turned out perfectly.

Excellent recipe.  The pancakes were not too heavy.  Make sure if you cook with oil that you don't use too much.  They will soak it up.
I intend to try these with a little variation, perhaps with whole wheat flour and some chopped walnuts.

Could not get the center cooked. Turned out really chewy and wet. I tried to make two before just giving up. Sorry, I will definitely not make these again.

I was looking for a vegetarian recipe for pancakes since I don't really drink milk or eat eggs anymore, and I was happy to find this one. I used wheat flour with them, and they were absolutely delish. :)

SO good!  Added mashed banana, cinnamon, some homemade vanilla.  I used raw sugar as some others did.  Also substituted almond milk for the water. These are wonderful.  These will be our pancakes from now on.

Good basic recipe, but I recommend using almond or soy milk in place of water, and adding about 1/2 tsp vanilla or cinnamon. You can also cook these as waffles and they crisp up really nicely.

Love this recipe.  I am not vegan or vegetarian but I used this recipe due to running out of eggs and milk.  I did want to add that for those that due eat it I also added 1 tablespoon of Honey to the mix plus a small amount of vanilla and its delicious.  If you don't eat honey Karo syrup works the same by just adding a touch more of sweetness and makes them a bit more fluffy.

My son is exclusively breastfed and is dealing with allergies to milk, eggs, soy, and peanuts. For the past 7 months, I have been following the same diet for his health. This is THE BEST vegan pancake recipe I have found. The only thing I did differently was using almond milk instead of water. 

Delicious!

This version of pancake is totally healthy and you really don't miss the eggs.  It's especially great with 100% pure maple syrup.  Just be sure to watch the pancake to flip when a few bubbles form and edges start to dry.  My non-vegan boyfriend really enjoyed them too!

I great recipe for people who avoid animal products or just don't have eggs or milk in the house! I make these all the time now! Sometimes I stick to the basic recipe..but other times I jazz it up a bit lol.

Add in 1/2cup pumpkin puree for pumpkin pancakes. Add in a dash of vanilla, and cinnamon for more flavor. You can add almost anything to this recipe. I use Agave Nectar as my "syrup" too.

These are the best Pancakes I've ever made from scratch. I'm lazy when it comes to measuring things but this is easy and if you follow this recipe EXACTLY they come out looking like those in the picture. I made sure I sifted completely & had my pan hot enough. I spread out the batter with the back of spoon to make them thinner but they are also fun thick and fluffy. I used "Florida Crystals" brand of "vegan" sugar. Make sure pan doesn't get too hot or you can burn these like any pancake. Next time I will follow other's advice and add some soy, rice or almond milk in place of the water. I'll also add some Cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I may even throw some blueberries in them. Top them off with some Earth Balance (vegan) and some agave or maple syrup. I entertain often and wouldn't hesitate to serve these to any guest. I'm off to go freeze some extra ones. Enjoy!

Those came out perfect! I used vanilla oat milk instead of water, but besides that didn't change a thing, they came out nice and fluffy, maybe a bit on the chewy side, but I like them like this! Basically perfect!

Delicious! I'm not vegan but I still found these to be a tasty breakfast treat. Switched up the AP flour for some whole wheat pastry flour, and it worked perfectly. Will definitely make again.

Just as described - fluffy and delicious. My carnivorous roommates loved them. I don't call them vegan pancakes, I call them bachelor/bachelorette or "college" pancakes because most people have the ingredients in the pantry, even if they don't cook often.

My kids are either allergic to eggs and/or milk and so this is the perfect recipe for our family.  My husband also thinks it tastes awesome.  We actually prefer these pancakes to the restaurant ones!  Add some fruit or chocolate chips for an extra special treat.

These were easy to make and kids loved. We did make a few changes. First instead of sugar, we used brown rice syrup. And we added a handful of blueberries. Next time I might try grinding up some oatmeal and using that instead of regular flour.  But these were a great start to switching over to vegan foods.

The recipe is easy and quick. These pancakes turn out really pale for me, so that took some getting used to. All in all good pancakes. Not needing milk or eggs is a big plus, since I buy them infrequently.

I'm a preschool teacher and recent had a vegan student join my classroom. We are planning on making pancakes this week and I wanted to make sure they were compatible with his diet. I tried this recipe out ahead of time and it was great! I did add cinnamon and  vanilla, but they were really delicious. My 8 year old couldn't tell the difference between these and non-vegan.

I just made these for supper.  I have a cold, didn't want a big dinner, just wanted something simple.  I hadn't been to the grocery store in days, so the cupboard is rather bare.  Anyway, long story short, basically all I had on hand was these ingredients.  They turned out great, very light and fluffy.  I used whole milk instead of water.  Topped them with peanut butter and pure maple syrup.
If you prefer savory pancakes rather than sweet, leave out the sugar and add your favorite seasonings with chopped green onions. Makes a great snack.

I've tried a few vegan pancake recipes ---this one is by far the best I've found so far!  They actually fluff up a bit and don't stay flat or overly dense like most vegan pancakes or other baked goods do.  I added blueberries and chopped pecans in.  SO GOOD!  I also substituted the regular sugar for dark jaggery and it worked out very well.  I saw someone mention it in the other comments but yeah, I don't know why this would say "vegan" if it's telling you to use white sugar.

I just made this with my dad today. His stomach kind of hurts and he was craving pancakes so I looked up a recipe. The thing was, we had no milk or white vinegar. I stumbled upon this recipe and thought, why not try this one? I doubled it and put in lots of blueberries (Dad loves them). They are awesome. They were easy to prepare and cooked very fast and were just superb. My dad asked what was in them and I told him. He was very surprised and pleased. We will be making these again for sure!!!

I am honestly not a vegan, but use vegan recipes often when I go on camping trips to avoid bringing milk and eggs that would otherwise go bad. 

This is by far the best one I've come across for easy pancakes for long outdoor trips. Just pack the dry ingredients and add the wet the day you want to make them. 

Thanks for sharing this.

This tastes great! To make it even healthier and add more fiber, I added 3/4 cup of oat bran. It makes them thicker and more filling. Eat these with maple syrup on top! Yum!

These were really good. I made them for breakfast this morning, and I was wondering how this would compare to vegan pancakes made with soy milk, maybe there would be less flavor ect.  They were just as good.  I added a LOT of spice, cinnamon, cloves, and allspice and topped them with some real NY state maple syrup.  My boyfriend and I both ate too much.

Perfect and fluffy, although I think this would feed one and a half people as it makes only 3 good sized pancakes. Also, heat should be at medium, not medium high. I ate mine with sliced bananas, sprinkle of cinnamon, melted butter and powdered sugar. Although they would be delicious with any variation - chocolate chips, whole wheat, fresh fruit on top!

I happened to be out of those milk and eggs but felt like pancakes this morning so tried out this recipe. I make a lot of pancakes, and try new recipes all the time and these pancakes turned out pretty well. I think I could add some things to them (vanilla, spices) but as a basic recipe I think it works well. Personally I still prefer eggs and milk in my pancakes but if you can't eat those things, or don't have them around, this recipe will do you well.

The center of the pancakes wouldn't cook!  I had to throw out the pancakes and the rest of the batter because it was just complete mush.  Extremely disappointed (and still hungry).

I made the recipe exactly as shown. The first half of pancakes were pale and anemic looking. The second half looked better but they were very rubbery in texture. I won't make these again.

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times and now have it memorized. I have followed it to the T (except I always use whole wheat flour) and even made substitutions (agave nectar for sugar and almond milk for the water) and every time have had perfect pancakes. The batter is super thick but I prefer that because I can scoop it easily to make uniform pancakes. Amazingly these are the fluffiest pancakes I have ever made and replaced another recipe from this site as my "go to". The batter also keeps well for a couple of days in the fridge for a quick breakfast on the weekends.

A delicious recipe for vegans who miss pancakes!

A warning, though: it's not truly vegan if you use most white sugar (produced with animal bone char).  I subbed organic natural cane sugar and it worked just fine.

I also added blueberries and found that it worked a bit better with the heat closer to medium than medium high on our stovetop griddle.

These came out great the first time. I substituted oat flour for regular flour and 1 C of vanilla soy milk for 1 C of the water. This is a very easy to make recipe.

This was absolutely amazing!! Almost tempted to never make pancakes with eggs again. They are perfectly good on their own, but I also chopped in some apples to make apple pancakes. I think it would work great with any topping.

These are excellent! I used one tablespoon of raw sugar and one tablespoon of organic honey instead of 2 tablespoons of sugar. I also added cinnamon and vanilla extract. I have made them twice now and the 2nd time I added some vanilla soy milk with the water. They turned out great!! Thanks!

OH BOY ARE THESE GOOD!!!!  I was looking for a pancake/waffle/crepe recipe that didn't require milk, as I'm out at the moment.  These are fantastic!!  I'm printing this recipe in 3 different serving sizes for all my possible serving needs.

Very good but I had a problem with the amount of flour vs. liquid. I had to keep adding flour to get the right consistency. I think the extra 1/4 C is too much. I used almond milk instead of water and I recommend everyone use milk as well. Usually I add vanilla but I totally forgot this time. I think that would have made these perfect.

These pancakes are amazing!  I was hesitant to try them at first, but my daughter is allergic to dairy so we took the plunge and WOW!  We probably won't go back to our other pancake recipe ever again.  Not only are they tastier but they are less expensive to make too!

To the reviewers who didn't like the outcome, keep in mind there are some things you need to know to get a perfect pancake.  The biggest rule is after the batter is mixed, disturb it as little as possible!  (and don't over mix to begin with)  Also, once batter is mixed, let it sit in the bowl for a good 5-10 minutes.  This ensures a fluffy pancake, as well as using the correct heat level.  To the reviewers who complain of the middle being uncooked, that's not the recipe's fault, it sounds like your heat was too high.  It takes a good 2 minutes on EACH side to cook correctly.  If your pancakes look done before that, your heat is too high.  Set a timer.

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!  Next time I will substitute some flour with whole wheat flour & the water with 1/2 almond milk (perhaps vanilla infused).

So delicious. Mine weren't vegan since I made some changes. I added some vanilla and cinnamon per suggestions from reviewers and replaced some of the water with half and half. I also used butter in the pan instead of oil.  But seriously, these came out SO good. Fluffy, crispy edges, not at all too tough or chewy. Really just perfect.

I think milk/egg pancakes have a slightly better flavour BUT I picked this recipe because it didn't require them (time for a grocery run). Let the batter sit a little for fluffier pancakes. 

Perfect for what it was and what I needed. Still delicious.

This recipient was delicious.  My husband and I really couldn't tell that these were vegan.  I'm lactose intolerant and my husband wants me to cook more vegan, so I'll use this recipie again.  I used  3/4 cup of almond milk with 1/2 cup of water, 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour with 1 cup unbleached white flour, 1 tsp of lemon juice, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  Next time I will try vanilla too.

I changed the liquid part to 1/2 c. of powder milk plus 1-1/2 c. of water. Add 1 egg with oil and blend well.

Changed flour to 1-1/2 c. and added 1 tsp cinnamon to dry ingredients.

Very simple and good pancakes. They are thick but come out very fluffy. I just added a ton of cinnamon to the batter and 1/2 cup almond milk with 3/4 cup water instead of 1 1/4 cup water.  
The night before my 2 year old bit in to 3 pears. Instead of throwing them away I made pear crisp to put on out pancakes. It was fantastic!!

I can't say enough nice things about these! I never have eggs or milk, but do get frequent pancake cravings :o) I prefer to add vanilla & cinnamon because that's how I like my pancakes. These don't spread at all, they only get tall! I used 1/4 measuring cup and got 7 small cakes.

I'm not a vegan. I made these because I didn't have any eggs. Couldn't tell the difference! Smothered some nutella on there and mmm...

This is a great recipe for when you're craving pancakes but can't be bothered to pick up milk or eggs from the store! Super quick and easy too! I made a couple adjustments -- I used 75% spelt flour and 25% unbleached white flour instead of all-purpose flour, raw cane sugar in pace of the white sugar, and coconut oil for the oil. I also added a splash of almond extract and cooked the pancakes in coconut oil. I loved how they turned out! The texture was on the chewy side -- maybe because I stirred the batter too much -- but I actually liked that. They did cook quickly, so do keep an eye on them.

I love the convenience of the ingredients, however I must have done something wrong because mine were not light and fluffy.  They just couldn't seem to cook all of the way through even after 20 mins

Added a little vanilla extract, cocoa powder and cinnamon. They were delightful. I was using another recipe but this one blows that one out the water. I have to use a lot of Vegan recipes b/c my daughter is allergic to milk, eggs and peanuts and I breastfeed. Using Vegan recipes has been a lil hard on me since I am such a dairy addict but I am starting to appreciate it (and liking the health effects also). Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for my boys last night for breakfast dinner and they were a big hit!  I did substitute the water with rice milk, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and miniature Enjoy Life chocolate chips.  I was amazed how fluffy they turned out.

I found this recipe to be great. It is easy and doesn't take any special ingredients. I did substitute some of the water for rice milk and it worked out perfectly. Made blueberry ones and m&m ones! Yum!

Awesome! I ran out of eggs but my kids wanted pancakes so I checked the site for vegan pancakes...I'm so glad I did! These are fantastic! However, mine are not vegan because I added MILK instead of water to give them a nice fluffy texture and golden brown color.  This recipe is great!

I made these yesterday for breakfast and they were amazing! I realized I didn't have eggs after I had already promised pancakes to the family. I made them with fat free milk, and I substituted 1/2 cup of all purpose flower with whole wheat flower. And just to try it out I added cinnamon, nutmeg, Ginger, and cardamom. They turned out fantastic! A great base recipe for egg free pancakes!

Very good, but not a lot of flavor. Maybe with some alternate milk (soy, nut, oat, whatever) replacing some of the water? I'll try that next time. Definately a bonus though to find this recipe. 

Oh! I also substituted 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp cream of tartar for the baking powder because of a corn allergy.

This recipe turned out great. We tried vegan pancake recipes in the past and they were okay, but this one is awesome. We added a half teaspoon of vanilla extract and used pulverized raw sugar instead of white sugar. We will make this recipe often!

Light and fluffy! Was looking for a pancake recipe without eggs (since I didn't have any).  Used milk instead of water and used regular vegetable oil.  Very thick, but I spread it out and it was fine.  No trouble with this easy recipe which calls for simple things in your pantry! Will make again!!

These pancakes are highly under rated- the best I've had, with or without buttermilk, and should be rated as such. Spread the batter in the griddle or they won't cook well, otherwise enjoy!

This seems like a pretty decent recipe -- we're not vegan, but were out of eggs, so I tried it and it turned out fine. I did use half-and-half in place of some of the water (it needed using), and replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with whole-wheat. For the oil, I used walnut oil.

A total hit with the family!  Mine were crispy on the edges which is my favorite way for pancakes to be.  What a relief that all of the ingredients are readily available in most homes.  To the person who said they're not "truly vegan" because they have white sugar... only SOME white sugar is processed with animal bones.  Sure, better safe than sorry but if you know your white sugar is cruelty free then GO FOR IT.

Delicious! I like to make the healthiest version I can so instead of all purpose flour I used half all purpose and half whole wheat. Also, so people don't drown the pancakes in sugary maple syrup, I cut up some mango and threw a few pieces on top of the cooking pancakes. Note: Cute the mango very thinly so there aren't huge bulges. Totally amazing! Even non vegans are asking for second helpings!

These pancakes are ok, they are slightly chewy. I make them if I don't want to use or don't have eggs and milk on hand. Great if you are on a budget or don't have much on hand; you can still get your pancake fix. :)

I think its funny that people changed this recipe and then gave it less stars. I made the recipe as written and it came out great! Puffy pancakes! As Nicdelis says, do not overmix the batter. You want it to be lumpy. If you mix it too much then you will have some flat pancakes. I also use a 1/2 cup measuring cup to spoon out pancakes so that they are the same size everytime. This is a great recipe and i will try it again. :) Thanks!

Surprisingly tasty.  I have a nephew with allergies and since my taste testers (3 yr old daughter and nephew) gobbled them right up, I decided they were worthy of a 5 star rating.  Personally, I would prefer buttermilk pancakes, but the fact that these are tasty and cater to people with allergies makes it a 10 star recipe.  I have such a time altering recipes for my nephew, so thank you very much NICDELIS for adding this recipe.  Added about 1 tsp of vanilla as suggested by other reviewers.

Great recipe - really easy and quick to make, and the kids loved the pancakes.  It worked best with smaller pancakes.  We used maple syrup, but I think they would be amazing with berries or jam, as well.

These pancakes were wonderful! I sprinkled a little bit of cinnamon and sugar on top of the uncooked pancake as I was making them. I'll be making these again, maybe with a few drops of vanilla extract next time!

These pancakes had a weird squishy texture to them. Kind of bland, but I understand that they were trying to make them easy.

They were fluffy and slightly sweet. Add some vegan butter to the pan and you get a slightly sweet, buttery taste. Love them

I made these for a brunch with friends because some of them are vegan. I was pleasantly surprised by how they used normal pantry ingredients (none of those crazy expensive vegan substitutes), and they turned out great! Everyone was eating them, and I especially like that they were thin and fluffy, and they kept their shape.

Pretty good! I used 1/2 flour and 1/2 almond meal. So good, it didn’t need syrup. Only complaint would be how thin they came out.

I actually just made these as I had ran out of milk and wanted pancakes this morning. Definitely not going to be my go-to recipe...I added vanilla extract, cinnamon and chocolate chips to the batter. Topped pancakes with raspberries. Overall, it was just okay.

I used homemade cashew milk (water, cashews, vanilla, cinnamon, sugar, salt) with a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to create a buttermilk flavor in place of the water in this recipe. I also added 2 Tb ground flax. The oil I used was coconut, and I added more warm water after whisking to compensate for the absorbent flax and to create a consistency that would allow the little bubble holes to form so I would know when to flip them. They turned out great.

I'm trying to appreciate what the impact is when omitting dairy/eggs from baking recipes... so, a GOOD result with 1 minor modification - just added cinnamon (1tsp) because I wanted to taste the pancake 'nude' - no syrup, no preserves. 
I found that the griddle temp is critical to the texture - slightly less heat/ longer frying time cooked a more dense flapjack-type pancake.

Great basic recipe! I made it initially as suggested, then I swapped out half AP flour and half whole wheat, I also use almond milk rather then water and add about a teaspoon of vanilla. With these changes I still get delicious fluffy pancakes that are a bit more wholesome for my children.

I've made this recipe twice now and it has turned out great! I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract both times, and a little cinnamon sugar the second. Both vegans and non-vegans in my house loved them, my husband even saying he prefers them to regular buttermilk pancakes. Definitely a 5-star recipe for simplicity and deliciousness.
Note: I was able to get mine to cook all the way by thinly spreading them with a spoon into an already preheated pan. I cooked them longer than regular pancakes on medium heat so they could cook all the way through without burning on the outside.

alert! for a family of 3, double this recipe!!! also, to achieve really fluffy pancakes (without the egg normally in pancake recipes) use buttermilk instead of the water called for in this particular recipe.  if you are making this cuz you are vegan, then add 1 teaspoon white vinegar or lemon juice to the pancake to achieve the fluffiness we all love in a pancake.  I promise you wont taste the vinegar or lemon juice ( see crazy chocolate cake recipes, depression cake, poor cake, etc...)  as the vinegar reacts with the baking powder or soda  and really pumps up the volume. Also,  don't have your griddle too  hot, you want to give the cakes time to rise before they start burning- a medium flame is good. i keep my oven on  low while making pancakes and as they are done , keep them in a pan in my oven staying warm.  I served this with "simple baked apples" from this website. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/45397/simple-baked-apples/

My husband and I have made these so many times, that I actually make them in bulk batches now so we have breakfast in a pinch during the week. I have experimented with chocolate, cinnamon, and pumpkin spices and they always come out super delicious and fluffy!! They aren't heavy either, which I truly appreciate! This recipe is now filed in my memory box and I can't wait to make these delicious treats for more of my family!

This is an excellent starting point recipe. I have tweaked it a bit . 1 cup of flour + 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour. Instead of all water I did a blend of soy milk and water. Last change was to add a table spoon of flax meal. I make this every weekend for family and friends and it's 5 stars
 every time.

This is a good recipe and I only needed a few tweaks. I used soy milk instead of water, added 2 tsp. of vanilla, 2 tsp. of cinnamon and 6 packets of xylitol in place of regular (non vegan) sugar. Even my boyfriend who swears an animal product is required at every meal liked them and said he would eat them again.

These were amazing! And not just because they were vegan like people are saying. They worked out great, I subbed flour for spelt flour, white sugar for coconut sugar, didn't add salt, and added vanilla and cinnamon. Soooooo delish

It is a great base recipe but definitely needs to be personalized. I have made it with a bit of cinnamon and vanilla but currently I'm loving it with a handful of unsweetened coconut flakes and a tsp of almond extract. I also always replace half the water with whatever nondairy milk I have in the fridge.

white sugar CAN be vegan. Depends on the brand. I buy organic white sugar and it is certified vegan. Not all white sugar is non vegan.....just an fyi....

I love this pancake. I make up the dry mix ahead of time and keep it in the cupboard. It makes a easy instant mix for the kids

This is a great basic recipe. I would recommend subbing the sugar for agave nectar (for you vegans) and if you make your own steel cut oats (from Bobs Redmill) flour in your vitamix dry blend container you can't go wrong. I'd also recommend putting in some vanilla extract and/or some cinnamon.

Add bananas and vanilla for a new twist...This recipe lives up to its hype as being very awesome.  That said, my wife and made some embellishments that added to the delight.  First of all, we cut down on the baking soda to about 1/3 of a teaspoon and substituted brown rice flour and brown sugar (3 tablespoons vs. 2).  After pouring in the water we threw in 3/4 of a banana and a smidgeon of vanilla.  We topped off the final product with banana slices.  Yummy, yummy, yummy.

Loved this recipe! I added a 1/4 cup of choppes pecans and 1/2 cup of applesauce to mine and they were divine! While I do agree that raw sugar is best I only had powdered sugar and whole wheat flour in the cabinet and so that is what I used. ::shrug:: Yummy in my tummy!

I made as above except added a teaspoon of dried culinary lavender and a teaspoon of vanilla. Made even better with strawberry sauce. I'll be making this one again. And again. And again.

They turned out very thin and doughy, no matter how long I cooked them for. I tried every temperature with every amount of time and they never turned out right.

As is the recipe is not vegan to start with.  Secondly the batter was barely thicker than water.  I had to add several tablespoons of flower and a "flax egg."  Overall not impressed.

I'm not vegan, but I ran out of eggs so decided to I've these a try.  I used 2 tbs of applesauce in place of oil, used raw sugar instead of white,and added cinnamon...my kids loved them! I only gave a 4 because without the cinnamon they have been lacking in flavor.

I was surprised at how good they tasted. I didn't even miss the eggs. Added a little extra water to thin them out so they spread a bit more but the first pan of mini thicker ones tasted great too. Touch the centre of the pancake before flipping to see if it springs back. If it doesn't, let it sit a little longer. They do cook quickly.

Tasted good but was way too thin. Only change I made was subbing 3 TBS of Aunt Jemima's original pancake syrup in place of the sugar and I used coconut oil. Next time I'll add less water I like my pancakes fluffy

This recipe is a great fluffy pancake recipe. I've made these several times, and they are consistently fluffy. Just don't over mix the batter! We're not vegan, but I prefer this recipe over some traditional pancake recipes. This recipe comes in handy if you are out of eggs, especially.

We have been making this recipe weekly for about two years now. They really are an awesome substitute for regular! They are fluffy and delicious. The recipe is great as written. After making them for so long here are the things I have noticed: staying with the recipe and using water makes them much fluffier than using milk (or a combo of both), using bottled water or filtered water tastes much better than plain tap, canola oil and avocado oil are the best choices, and this recipe is totally forgiving. I measure 2 cups of flour and then eyeball the rest and they always turn out awesome! It is a great template for additions as well, we've added everything from strawberries, blueberries, apples, and vanilla and cinnamon. Great all around!

These are good, but they're a little thinner than what I like. I reduced the water to 1 cup and added 1/2 tsp of baking soda and 1 1/2 tsp vinegar to make them be tall and fluffy. Works like a charm! Either way, I'm just happy my 2 year old with food allergies can enjoy pancakes and they're good enough I don't have to make 2 kinds, we all just eat these!

This recipe didn't work for me. I made them exactly the way the instructions said, yet I ended up with very gummy, sticky pancakes. Just to make sure I hadn't messed up I tried again. The problem is that these don't have enough liquid. I used soymilk and earth balance butter substitute. Replaced 1 1/4 cups water with 1 3/4-2 1/4 cup soy milk (depends of how fluffy you like your pancakes) and add in around a tablespoon of the butter substitute (if you add the butter substitute, you can take out the oil).  I wouldn't recommend this one without modifications.

I had no eggs or milk, but really wanted pancakes.  This recipe was perfect.  Granted, the texture is going to be slightly off because there are no eggs but other than that is was exactly what I was looking for.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla just because I like my pancakes a little sweet, but other than that, great recipe.

This is a good recipe but it is not vegan.  I changed the flour to whole wheat, used raw sugar and added a 1/4 cup of apple sauce.  It was still pretty thick so I added a 1/4 cup soy milk.  I doubled the recipes as we have a big family.  They where wonderful and even the non vegan members of the family loved them.

Perfect base receipt for pancakes!! My subtraction & additions: I used whole wheat flour and sifted all dry ingredients together. I omitted the salt and added vanilla and cinnamon. I also used half water, half vanilla soy milk. These pancakes were super fluffy and delicious. I also used Earth Balance butter on the the griddle and added blueberries. They were the perfect combination of crisp, buttery edges and fluffy delicious center! Def a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

I took some of the reviewers suggestions and used vanilla soymilk and subbed half the white flour for whole wheat (and threw in a few vegan chocolate chips). It was very easy to make with usually stocked ingredients.  My 4 yr. old grandaughter enjoyed helping to make them with me. The consistency of the batter was perfect! Be careful and watch closely as they cooked very quickly. I would have given it a 5 but it wasn't quite as good as buttermilk pancakes in taste.

Yum! I recently became vegan a month ago so this is my first time trying vegan pancakes. I substituted whole wheat flour. I also used 1 cup almond milk + 1/4 cup water as suggested by another user. I omitted the sugar since I was going to put syrup on them anyway and added 2 tsp cinnamon. Will definitely make these again!

I'm not a vegan.. I just didn't have any eggs or milk in the house and was to lazy to go to the store. These hit the spot. The only difference I made was I added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract. These are a bit blander and gummier than regular pancakes but for not having any milk or eggs in them..5 star!

I replaced the water with milk and oil with butter (ran out of eggs and already had the milk and butter in the bowl). Cooked them on low. Still turned out fluffy and tasty.

These were good! I had no milk and needed to feed my husband-these did the trick! I used 1/4 cup wheat flour and added about 1/8 cup more water. They were kind of thick, but cooked well and were nice and fluffy and tasty. It's great to have a good back-up!

Texture 5 stars - they are light and fluffy, I need to figure out how to get them to finish a little thicker though.
Appearance 5 stars - golden, as pictured.
Taste 4.5 stars - a slight floury taste, more so than some I've had, but this is covered up easily with the syrup or berries.

I will be making these again!

I replaced the water with vanilla soy milk. It turned out perfectly. You don't need as much sugar if you use that.

Like many other reviewers suggested, I added a little vanilla and ground cinnamon to the batter. I used 3/4 cup almond milk and 1/2 cup water. I also used a mix of white and light brown sugar. This recipe produced the best pancakes I have ever made (vegan or otherwise).

These are truly the fluffiest pancakes ever. I used white whole wheat flour and olive oil as I had those on hand. I was curious how using another sweetener would affect them, so mixed in two tablespoons of maple syrup. And then I added a 1/2 cup of pumpkin for the heck of it.  What a fabulous versatile recipe. I think one could add just about anything to them. Delicious and easy.

These are delicious! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup buckwheat, a tablespoon and a half of sugar (brown), and a little less salt. I also added about 10 scrapings of nutmeg and about 1/2 - 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Turned out amazing!

This were really nice. I stuck to the original recipe and only changed it to gluten-free. That was probably the reason why my pancakes came out extra fluffy but fell apart. Besides using a mix of corn starch and rice flour, I should have probably also added guar gum and an egg substitute. Either way, the flavor was good, and I'll definitely make these again.

Awesome pancakes, except they're only vegan if you use raw sugar, which I did :P The first time I made them they weren't very good, but then I substituted the water with almond milk and they came out amazing. Will be using this recipe every time I make pancakes, thanks! :)

Some of the best pancakes I have ever had. I have tried making it with halk milk and even with a little bit of baking soda too and it really does not make that big of a change from the original reciepe. Plus this is the only pancakes that I have ever had that did not leave you with a dry mouth. This is the only pancake reciepe I will ever use!

Perfect as written!  The second time we made these we added blueberries.  The third time we made them we used half all-purpose flour and half oat flour and added a few chopped pecans.  Great each time.

These were awesome and you don't miss/need the eggs. I DID make some changes - I used vanilla almond milk & plain soy instead of water and then cut the sugar back by half. I think the next time, I'll cut the baking powder back as well because I don't mind thinner pancakes. Also, I think it needed a bit more liquid - pancake batter should be pretty thin - but this may have been because I used the almond/soy milk instead of water. Yum!

I was excited to find this recipe we recently found out my son is allergic to wheat and dairy. I substituted gluten free flour and they turned out wonderful. No xanthum gum is needed when subbing the flour. We have also made blue berry and banana pancakes with this recipe. To make banana use less sugar and add the water as needed. These pancakes are truly wonderful. Thank you for this recipe. I have two very happy little boys again!

My daughter has egg, peanut and tree nut allergies.  I am always searching for excellent recipes for her without egg (and not so labor intensive).  This recipe is fantastic.  Looks like and tastes like full egg pancakes.  All my children love them.  I did add vanilla and since we are not vegan i substituted milk for water.  This is a must have for everyone, vegan or not!!!!

These were excellent.  I was craving some pancakes but didn't have eggs or milk so I decided to try this recipe.  I used all whole wheat flour and had to add about 2 extra tsp. of water to get them to spread.  The whole wheat version was only about 4 stars, but with white flour they would definitely be 5.

Whether vegan or not, this is a great pancake! I made it as stated except I did  mix all ingredients together (no whisking or well) + 1 ripe banana & they came out light, fluffy & delicious-just as NICDELIS mentioned. I'm not a vegan & actually prefer this recipe over the more popular pancake recipes on this site. These seem lighter (and save me some calories which doesn't hurt either!). And I didn't have a problem w/a thick batter, it was perfect. This is my new go-to pancake recipe!

Awesome pancakes!  I used Bisquick and added the sugar, water & oil and these came out SO good.  Very light and not the heavy, filling pancakes the ones with eggs and milk usually end up as.  I also added fresh blueberries and topped them w/ fresh peaches and strawberries. I'll be using this recipe from now on!  Thanks for posting it.

I am going to make these I have not yet but my nephew is 5 and has recently been diagnosed with milk and egg allergies that just came about one day about 3 months ago. He has been wanting pancakes so bad, and I am glad that I found these so I can make these for him.

I am an African-American woman from the south, so you can imagine my concern about vegan cupcakes, but I tried it out. I loved them!! The taste reminded me of graham crackers. I topped them with fresh fruits and a strawberry glaze. I also used almond extract rather than vanilla extract and whole wheat flour rather than the flour suggested. Additionally, I used turbinado sugar instead of regular sugar. Awesome stuff!!

Great, easy recipe using ingredients you can find in the house. I added 1/4 c. flaxseed and 2 tsp. vanilla. Had to increase water to 2 c. because they were a little thick. Otherwise, they were healthy and delicious. Five stars from my non-vegan boyfriend (who thought we needed eggs to make pancakes!)

These Pancakes are delicious! I used whole wheat flour and soy milk for the liquid. Nutritionally, this makes a complete protein among other benefits such as increased fiber and calcium. I also added 1 T of ground flax seed. Talk about "belly bombers"! 
I made the pancakes individually in a small skillet and placed the already made ones on a plate in a 170 degree F oven. This review is based on a serving size of 3.

I am trying to find an egg and soy free pancake.These tastes good. I did add cinnamon and vanilla. But I would not say they are fluffy at least not compared to egg pancakes.

These were really good!  I added chocolate chips to mine.  They stuck to the pan really badly though.  I had to douse the pan in cooking spray every time I added more pancakes or flipped them.  I've never had to add more spray when I flip before!  But, as long as you use enough cooking spray these should turn out great!

Made it as per the recipe and was disappointed. It just seemed doughy and all I could taste was flour. We aren’t vegan, but my son who will eat almost anything,  is allergic to dairy and eggs and I was trying to make them for him and he didn’t even like them.

Schmackin ?? I used grapeseed oil, monkfruit sweetener, and added vanilla. I have a big family and also tripled the recipe. Literally the best pancakes I've ever made -and I'm an OG.

I used organic Kirkland brand sugar instead of the white sugar. Super fluffy and easy to make. Topped with peanut butter and real maple syrup. Husband and kid approved.

These were really good! I’m egg intolerant and also trying not to eat as much dairy. I liked how these had everything I already had in the house! However I ended up adding a good bit of cinnamon and vanilla and they tasted great! My family couldn’t even tell they were vegan:)

These turned out better than I expected. I found they didn't brown and the texture was a little gummy, but that was probably more due to the fact that I added large blueberries to the mix making the cooking uneven than anything else. 
I'll definitely be trying them again.

I didn't have baking powder, I substituted it with 1/4 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp lemon juice (this ratio=1 tsp of baking powder). I have made this twice, 1st pancake doesn't come out good (this is on my end), but afterwards they taste like regular pancakes. 1st attempt also I substituted white sugar with agave syrup, 2nd attempt with stevia and I notice no difference between the two. In the long run, it doesn't matter because agave syrup goes on top ! Great recipe, cheaper to make than buying pancake mix

Best vegan pancakes. We make a mix of the dry ingredients and store 1 batch in a clean jar so all we need is water and oil. They're perfect for camping!

I made it with almond milk instead of oil, and I used gluten free flour. It tastes pretty good. They're still doughy even after cooking them for a while, but not so much that it's bad. If you have a sweet tooth, you may want to add a bit more sugar. I'm glad to know I can have pancakes again and will be making more of these.

Prepping breakfast for the coming week...I doubled the recipe. Additions: 2 teaspoons vanilla extract, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, extra liquid to make it the right pourable consistency. Substitutions: melted Myoko’s vegan butter for oil, and organic unsweetened vanilla almond milk for water.

Excellent! I love how simple and easy this recipe is. My two tweaks were to cut out the sugar for a savory pancake and use whole wheat instead of white flour. The taste is subtle, but not bland, and the texture is soft. These are good on their own or with toppings.

The pancake didn’t even form properly on the pan it looked like I was stirring this dough on the pan.

Here’s the thing, most vegan pancakes require bananas — which I loathe. Then I found one that was pretty good but the pancakes were more European style which is to say, crepes. These are perfect though. I can serve them to guest and no ones the wiser that there were no eggs involved in the preparation of this pancake goodness. Bonus because the sugar gives them a hint of sweetness.

It's a good basic recipe for when you have no eggs or milk (even had a slightly buttery taste too!) but I'd recommend adding spices to your liking to make it taste less bland.

I used cinnamon and nutmeg in mine and it was tasty, I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I'm new to eating vegan recipes; however, I make food for my daughter all the time! The recipe makes the batter pretty thick! Next time I will add a little more liquid to make it thinner. I used 1 cup of  almond milk instead of all water. And I added blue berries. I only ate a little bit more than half because it was a very filling! I will make this again!

This is an awesome recipe. I made it but used unsweetened Almond milk in place of the water and added 1/2 mashed banana and 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts! Very moist and tasty! Doesn’t even need syrup!!!! Yummy!

This has been our house recipe for years. Do not know why I never rated it. It is good and easy and fast. All simple and inexpensive pantry items. No eggs or milks means it is muc more frugal too.

This was delicious!!!!!!!My picky kids  LOVED this meal 
The problem is (this is not really a problem) it is more like one serving in a half.  I would make a double for a family of 4 so 2 can be left over

I was able to make it in a short time...especially since I had all the basic ingredients with me! :) I’m not sure if the taste came out right though... My family said it tasted like something fried, though I added some cinnamon to make it different.

Really good! I did a mix of all purpose flour, whole wheat, flax seed, and oat flour and cut the sugar by a 1/2 tablespoon,  but loved that we only had to use water. Perfect for an upcoming camping trip!

These pancakes were so fluffy and tasty! They taste almost exactly like non-vegan pancakes and still have the consistency of a typical pancake.

This recipe is super easy. While the plain pancakes themselves don’t have much flavor, the recipe is super adaptable. I added cocoa powder for chocolate pancakes and blueberries and raspberries for berry pancakes and both were super delicious.

I looked in the comments and decided instead of adding 1 and 1/4 cup of water. I added one cup of oat milk(what I had on hand) and only 1/4 cup of water.
And they turned out great and impressed my non-vegan sister! I also added vegan chocolate chips.
I will defiantly make these again

I made these for Sunday Brunch today. They turned around amazing, as other reviewers stated I changed the recipe slight to suit my pallet. I wound up subbing soy milk instead of water (for thicker denser pancakes) and added 1 TSP of vanilla extract to the milk. They turned out stupendous!

If you want vegan pancakes with some fluff use a recipe that has vinegar or lemon juice instead.  The flavor was good but pancakes were flat. I made these twice. Once following directions exactly and once substituting half the flour with oat flour.

This recipe is so easy and on point! Simple ingredients and yet so fluffy with a mildly sweet taste. I added vegan chocolate chips on one batch and frozen blueberries on the other and it kicked it up a notch. Be sure to hand mix ss blender can make the pancakes rubbery due to increase in gluten.  Thanks for this great find.

These were really good! I tweaked it a bit though and added an extra two tablespoons of sugar, less salt, two teaspoons of vanilla essence, two tablespoons of cocoa powder, two crushed chocolate biscuits, no oil and took out a bit of the water and replaced it with soy milk ??

Delicious base recipe. I say that because I modified it to meet my needs. I used 100% whole grain whole wheat flour, organic brown sugar, organic blueberries, and organic vanilla extract. I also used coconut oil. Delicious and even impressed my skeptical family members.

These are good pancakes. They aren’t the best, but it’s a simple recipe that requires few ingredients and is super quick to put together! I have been making them without the oil, in order to cut the calories and they still taste fine.

I often use this recipe if I ever need to make vegan pancakes. They're delicious and simple! Seriously they're so easy to make. You can always adjust it by adding a bit more flour to make them thicker or a bit of soy milk to make them thinner.

These are perfect! Not dry at all, and taste like normal pancakes. The only things that I added was a bit of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

Absolutely delicious!  We substituted 1/4 cup of soy milk for the 1/4 cup of water, and used the remaining water.  Perfect!!

I've read other reviews saying the batter was too thick... I've made this three times now, and each time it seemed too liquidy BUT it cooks perfectly! Almost like a crepe! So yummy and chewy. My kids have voted, "mom's" pancakes are best.

I'm not sure why others didn't like this mixture, it turned out great for me. I used a mixer for the batter and it came out smooth. The only thing I added was raspberries. This was some of the best homemade pancakes I have made yet.

These are great. I didn’t have milk or eggs and this a great alternative. I added a little more sugar and some vanilla extract for additional flavor, which I add to all pancake recipes.

Easy and straight forward as it is and tastes delicious. No modifications needed. 

Having said this, I added about 1 cup of vegan chocolate chips for a nice surprise. 

Can also add a teaspoon of vanilla extract for slightly different (positive) flaovur.

With the addition of some cinnamon and vanilla the taste was good. I used organic sugar (processed white sugar is typically whitened with bones) for this recipe and wish I would have used almond milk or the like rather than water. 

The thing is, this is more a recipe for crepes rather than typical fluffy pancakes. The batter is SO thin with equal amounts of flour and water. I didn't really think about it as I was preparing the mix, but realized it as soon as I poured it together. The first couple "pancakes" tasted the best. They were thin and pale. When I tried to cook them to look like traditional fluffy, slightly browned pancakes, they were really tough and I tossed the rest of the batter.

I can quite understand how this recipe gets such a high rating. It wasn’t very good. The taste is ok, if you like heavy, gluey, play dough cakes. The texture was bad. Like eating half hardnened paper mache...which I guess, is pretty much what it was.. I had high hopes, I really wanted to like this one but it just wasn’t great. Sorry. ¯\_(?)_/¯

This was amazing. It was very good even though it was a vegan recipe. I was surprised. It stayed to get her very well and was very tasteful. I even used it without any maple syrup or anything and it was still great. I doubled it. One thing I would  like to say is that when I tried to make a big pancake the middle came out a little bit under done and the outside was just ready so I wouldn't want to burn it, so I would recommend not making such big pancakes. But I thought it was a delicious breakfast and I will for sure make it again.

I didn't have any eggs or regular milk, so I looked for a vegan recipe. I'm not vegan, though. So, I used unsweetened almond milk in place of the water, added blueberries and a little almond extract (because I love both in pancakes) and cooked them in bacon grease. They were amazing, but I know it doesn't help anyone truly looking for a vegan pancake recipe review. But I needed to post this review for my own poor memory. I know I'm going to wonder how I made those fantastic pancakes and need to find this!

Made this this morning because it's the day before grocery shopping day and I am down to the minimum in my pantry. I'm no vegan but I had all the ingredients so felt it worth a try. Taste just like regular pancakes!!!!...just not as thick. Keeping this recipe handy for sure. I will note: I added a sprinkle of cinnimon and 3 drops of vanilla extract to batter. My daughter put it best: "Well, Mom, if we're ever caught in a zombie apocalypse and there's no milk, buttermilk, or eggs...we can still have pancakes!"

Amazing recipe !
TIP: for thicker, fluffier pancakes, only add 1 cup of water - It makes the pancakes PHENOMENAL; I love them :)

I made this as written, except added 1 tsp vanilla. These were excellent! They were fluffy, golden, and tasty. This is my new go-to pancake recipe.

I was surprised they could still come out so fluffy and tasty! Its been an adjustment for my family going vegan but its nice to have some meals like this breakfast option, to remain tasting basically the same.

We nicknamed these pancakes "splatcakes". They didn't turn out very good. They were thin and overcooked. The reason we call them splatcakes is because we tried to make proper circles, but they all dripped and splattered into each other. They are very good served with raspberry compote or jam. Overall, I don't recommend this recipe.

Best pancakes ever! I substituted soy milk for the water portion, added 1.5 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp if cocoa powder, and 1 tsp of vanilla. I didn’t even need syrup with these! Absolutely yummiest pancakes I have ever had, definitely better than any restaurant could serve. I highly recommend making these and adding your own favorites to it!

First time making it and I added vanilla and cinnamon. 
Batter tasted really good. Batter was like a regular pancake recipe,  not exactly clumpy so not sure if that’s where I went wrong but also they were really flat and weren’t cooking properly.  (Raw all in the middle ) I had them on medium heat.  
This recipe has good reviews so i will try them again but for this time they are not really edible.
Also I used raw cane sugar .

I was really hopeful after reading the reviews and glad to see no eggs, milk or butter. These are the worst pancakes I have ever made and I make a lot of pancakes (one of my favorite things) I followed the recipe EXACTLY 2 different times infact and the batter was really running and they turned out super flat.

My family and I recently transitioned to a vegan diet a few months ago. I've been looking for a good vegan replacement recipe for the buttermilk pancake recipe my family and I LOVED and miss. This recipe is NOT it. I followed the recipe to the "T." All I could taste was sugar and oil. These were NOT fluffy. Even my 6 year old (who loves eating vegan) took two bites and said he couldn't finish it. Very disappointed.

This is the first vegan pancake recipe that I found that didn't fall flat in the pan. They taste great and I love them! I added a bit extra water to make the batter more spreadable in the pan and also a little vanilla.

The kids love these pancakes! I have made them a few times, and the entire family is happy every time. I modify the recipe slightly, double the ingredients, adding an over-ripe banana smashed, a touch of cinnamon and vanilla extract, and instead of using only water as the recipe calls for, I mix apple juice, coconut milk, and water. Delicious!

This is our go to recipe for pancakes.  I make it every time my grandson is here and he helps me.  I make a fruit topping to go on top.     I have had no trouble pouring the batter like some people mention.  I have also used Hemp Milk in place of the water .   Cant go wrong with this recipe.

As the other 1-star reviews expressed, the center would not cook and had a gel, doughy texture; It was really gross. The flavor was okay (really, just ok). I made the exact; although, I used grape seed oil for my oil....not sure what others used. Nobody in my house ate them.

This was a great sub for pancakes.  I started eating vegan for health reasons ( second month).  This was great and I spread peanut butter and bananas..so satisfying.  My subs in recipe were apple sauce for  the oil and added cinnamon.   Next time will be adding blueberries or bananas within batter.  The portion was great for one person.

I just made and ate this, it was really good. This will be my go-to pancake recipe from now on. Easy and I had breakfast done in like ten minutes. Sifting everything is the key, I think.
The only change I made was that I used Arthur's 100% Whole Wheat White Flour, which is a whole wheat flour that's really mild, similar to white flour. And I used coconut oil for the oil.

The pancakes were a little dense, but I think that's because rather than make 3 servings like the recipe calls for I just made one giant pancake haha. I made a side of vegan sausages with it and  I am STUFFED!! But not sleepy like I used to feel when I ate meat/dairy. 

All in all, try these pancakes, you will not be disappointed!

Love the recipe. I added a few changes to fit my family's tastebuds. We love cinnamon so I added a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoons of vanilla. They were amazing! Can't wait to make again. (We aren't really vegans but these are nice. I used milk instead of water (this is my second time making these) and they were good. I like this recipe because I always have these few ingredients in the house so it's quick and easy)

I have been trying to find a vegan pancake recipe that I liked for years. After making this, I'm done looking. These were fluffy, thick and just sweet enough. They browned nicely and bubbled just like traditional pancake batter. 

Instead of the water, I mixed 1/8 C of lemon juice with enough almond milk (original, unsweetened) to make 1 1/4 cups. I omitted the salt (because I forgot it) and added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also used Truvia baking blend in place of sugar because my diabetic father bought a bag of it not realizing there was actual sugar in it and I'm trying to use it up.

I made these a second time and added 1 cup of frozen blueberries (without defrosting). They turned out perfect. The first batch, I added the blueberries after pouring the batter on the pan. After that, I just folded the remaining blueberries into the remaining batter. They were all good, but I recommend the folding method. The blueberries were better incorporated into the pancakes and I didn't end up with purple fingertips.

Yes they taste good, however they are not fluffy...not sure what I'm missing or maybe I'm not cooking them long enough without burning them...not sure!!

I am so disappointed. We mixed and it was dough colored water. I tried more sugar and flower and still watery. Went ahead and tried to make them and theyre gelatinous. Gross. I guess it's toast for breakfast.

Receipe required way too much water. Pancakes were extremely thin and hard. Followed the receipe exactly. They did not taste good either. I had to throw them away because of how thin and hard they were. I even add more flour to thicken them up and the taste still wasn't good. Sorry.

My favorite recipe so far! I just subbed 1 1/4 cups of water to 1 cup of almond milk and 1/4 cup of water. Made it look and taste like non-vegan pancakes!

Absolutely delicious!  I typically double the recipe and substitute 1 cup of unsweetened almond milk and then add the water until desired consistency, instead of 2.5 cups of water.  Perfectly fluffy and yummy.  My kids love them, and others would NEVER know they're dairy and egg free!

Amazing!  I couldn't believe these simple ingredients produce such delicious pancakes. The only tricky part is getting them to brown nicely. Just adjust the temperature until they come out nice and brown and you'll be fine. So delicious it's worth it! It just takes a little adjusting it just takes getting the temperature it takes getting the temperature just right to get them to Brown just right, but it's worth it! You have to get the temperature just right, because I guess without butter it's a little tricky her to get them golden brown.

These pancakes are delicious, but I needed more flour than was recommended. I used 2 cups instead of 1 and 1/4 cups, and I also added some peanut butter in the batter and as a garnish for flavor. Will definitely make again!

This was the worst vegan pancake recipe I've ever made. This dough, I honestly don't know what's wrong with it. Maybe because the use of water and not nondairy milk.  Mine turned out a huge chunk of dough and wouldnt spread at all. YES DOUGH! 
Anyway, I recommend just using non dairy milk if you have it. Mine turned out like biscuits. Oh and they were tasteless! Raw in the middle because they were as thick as burgers  and didn't cook properly.

Perfect for what I needed. My son is allergic to milk and eggs and this is an easy recipe for me to ease into a vegan lifestyle . I used almond milk in place of water and added a bit of vanilla based on other reviews. Better than anything else I've tried and i don't miss the eggs! Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This is the pancake recipe I have been searching for!!  These pancakes came out so tasty and fluffy - I couldn't even tell they were vegan!  My toddler, who is allergic to dairy, loved dipping them in her maple syrup!  This recipe is my new breakfast staple!
I also mixed a bit of cocoa into the batter for the last 4 pancakes and it turned out perfectly.  :)

This was my first attempt at vegan pancakes (at my daughters request).  This recipe was so easy and the pancakes were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. My daughter gave it two thumbs up! I love that this recipe was simple and that I had everything on hand. Thank you for the great recipe.

I made these for Sunday brunch for our vegan niece. I read the reviews and made a slight alteration to include almond milk (hat was her preference). They came out a little light, but she gobbled them up and said they were awesome. That was enough to satisfy me! The batter was a little thin so next time I may reduce the water a bit to play with the consistency. Regardless, this one is a keeper.

Six years ago I learned that I had both dairy and egg intolerances.  Oh, how I missed buttermilk pancakes!  Two years later, I came across this recipe and almost cried from joy.   They are simply delicious.  Everyone loves them.  I make a double batch of silver dollar pancakes and freeze them for my daughter, who also has a dairy intolerance.  They heat up beautifully in the toaster oven.

Substituted the water for almond milkshake and came out lovely. White sugar in South Africa is Vegan so it is 100% here. 
Definitely a keeper!

I made these and they turned out great! Instead of water, I added almond milk (it gives better flavor and added nutrients)and instead of sugar, I used Stevia. And whenever I make pancakes, I evenly sprinkle cinnamon,some bee-free honee that I made myself, and about 45 drops of vanilla on top of the batter.It makes all the difference.

I switched out the water for macadamia nut milk (adding a little bit of rice vinegar, and let sit for five minutes, to make a vegan buttermilk). This made the mix fluffier because the acid of the vinegar reacted with the baking powder.

White sugar isn't Vegan, it's processed with bone char. Substitute a vegan-approved sugar substitute & then this a nice, basic recipe.

The batter seemed a little thin so I added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. They were fluffy, and not gummy inside like many vegan pancakes I've tried.

Good recipe and suggestions.  I replaced water with soy milk and next time will try almond milk. I tasted too much of baking powder even though I used the amount from the recipe.  My husband and I devoured them. Will definitely make these again, perfect recipe for lent.

This was my first time making it and I had to add more flour. My problem when I cook pancakes in a pan they turn out kind of like a crepe. Any tips on that please share with me. I will probably make them again over a griddle.

This is FANTASTIC! I added a few shakes of cinnamon and a splash of vanilla extract for extra flavor. Cooked them for just over 2 minutes and they're perfect. Very light and fluffy, and easy to chew.

I usually double or triple the recipe but keep the baking powder the same(the fluffiness stays the same) so I never noticed until I made the recipe in the same proportions as the actual recipe. You can kind of taste the baking powder, not terribly so but enough for me to consider using less the next time. Same with the salt. Maybe it's just me, but I dislike overly salty foods, particularly foods that  are supposed to be sweet. So the only alterations that I ever make is reducing the baking powder and salt by just a touch and replacing the water with plant milk if I have any(and sometimes soy yogurt). But it tastes wonderful with only water as well, I was surprised about that. I have also considered adding vanilla but never have yet. I wonder if it'll improve the flavour or just make it taste like vanilla.

 

This is now my official pancake recipe. I will use no other. Fluffy, moist, never heavy, simple and versatile ingredients and super duper easy to make. Maybe I'll modify here and there to suit my needs(choco chips anyone?), but I'll (probably) never look up another recipe for pancakes again.

WOW!!! These are incredible!! I added a little bit of vanilla extract, and cooked them with banana slices, pecans, and fresh blueberries, and topped with a little vegan butter to serve! I had everything in my cupboards already, so that was a huge plus. I would have no idea these are vegan.

Great pancakes!  My 7 year old grand daughter who hates eggs said that finally we found the perfect eggless pancake recipe and that they were the fluffiest and best  ever,  she was right.  I did make  one change , I used seltzer instead of water. I will try the original recipe next time.

These came out perfectly! I used light brown sugar instead of white, and they came out light and spongey...just like I like them! As a transitioning vegan, I was skeptical, but these are delicious! I taste no difference from these pancakes than the ones you order at a diner.

I made the pancakes as per the recipe instructions.
I found the pancakes were tough and very bland.

I substituted soy milk instead of water and raw sugar instead of regular sugar and they turned out beautifully! I'd also recommend double-sifting the the dry ingredients to prevent lumps and incorporate more air. This is easily my favorite vegan recipe.  I plan on adding a 1/2t of cinnamon next time, too.

I loved this recipe. As the only vegan in my house I made them for my other housemates as a birthday breakfast and they didn't even think they were vegan. They were fluffy and filling, not to mention delicious. I swapped in almond milk instead of water, but loved it!

These were so much better than I expected.  No one in my family is vegan, but on a Sunday morning when you realize you are out of things like milk or eggs, these are wonderful.  Maybe even better than their animal product counterparts!  I made one slight change simply based on the look of it when I was mixing.  The recipe calls for 1 1/4 cups water.  I used only 1 cup since it already looked very thin.  Otherwise, I think it's perfect!!

This deceptively simple recipe worked very well without any "special" ingredients. I found that I had to add more flour to bring them to the correct consistency, but that probably varies based on the brand of flour you use. We had a pancake breakfast for a huge group of students and made a small batch of these for the vegan and dairy free kids, and they said they came out really well!

DELICIOUS!!!  Firstly, this is my first time making pancakes from scratch!  Secondly, I am slowing moving into vegan eating.  I was quite nervous about this one.  I used unrefined/unbleached organic whole cane sugar (smells so good), unbleached all-purpose flour, then my oil of choice this go around was vegetable oil.  Served with maple syrup.  Grateful!

Sorry, no. Was out of flax meal and rice flour for my go-to pancake recipe, so decided to try this. The pancakes stuck horribly to both a skillet and well-oiled griddle and could not be flipped - never had this issue before. I actually threw my spatula across the room I got so frustrated. The few mangled pancakes I managed to turn out were thick, salty and rubbery. Amazed by all the sky high reviews, maybe people have never had anything better?

These are great vegan pancakes. I've made exactly following the recipe, and I've also made part water/part coconut milk which seemed to add a little flavor. I have also added mashed bananas for banana pancakes, which turned out delicious. This is so much easier than making egg substitute. Thanks!

These pancakes are everything I dreamed they would be! My family is trying to cut back the amount of money we spend on food each month so we were looking for a very cheap breakfast. Here it is! I only added 1 t of  vanilla to a double batch. We've eaten them everyday for a week! 
The batter still makes fine cakes straight from the refrigerator. My personal favorite is with canned peaches and whipped cream.

I'm not vegan..chose this recipe because I didn't have any eggs on hand and I'm so glad I did! This is the perfect pancake recipe. I added 1 tbs vanilla and subbed the one cup water for one cup milk and 1\4 cup water. Made both with and without chocolate chips. i prefer without but both ways were delicious. The pancakes without the chocolate chips were almost buttery tasting. Great recipe all around, vegan or non vegan. Thanks so much!!

I was out of milk and wanted pancakes. I cooked it in butter and that helped with the taste. I tried without butter and it tasted just as good. I would definitely make this again.

Added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla which was good. But they didn't brown very well and weren't especially light - just okay. Will probably try a different recipe next time.

I hate when I read reviews and the person said it was great or bad but didn't stick to the recipe... Well this was yummy but I didn't stick to the recipe. All dry ingredients are the same and oil but I used vanilla soy milk in place of the water, same amount. It just sounded better and it was yummy! Will make again.

This recipe turned out bland, gummy, and thin both times I made it. That being said, it can be used as base for vegan pancakes if modified by the cook. 

I personally have been adding brown sugar instead of cane sugar, unsweetened almond milk instead of water, a splash of vanilla, and about 1/4 c more flour.

I really loved this recipe a whole bunch! Yes, it is a bit thick but I think that can be changed based on who wants what kind of thickness. I added about 1/2 a cup of peach jam into the batter and it made it thinner. Going to try this on my waffle maker and see if that works. Thanks so much for an amazing recipe!

So I made out with coconut sugar and I thought they where awesome. My non-vegan boyfriend said they where good but missed that classic buttermilk pancake. (I think he is just too stuck in his ways and couldn't taste anything under the syrup anyway XD )

These are great pancakes! I have never tried vegan pancakes before but my daughter has an egg allergy so I've been collecting different recipes to try. I made a double batch and froze the leftovers. I microwave then did 90 seconds for a quick breakfast. I have also tried adding a banana to the batter. Turned out great! Thanks for the recipe!

OMG this is so good. I followed everything with two exceptions: I replaced the 2 Tbsp of sugar with 4 tsp agave nectar and added some vanilla extract to the wet ingredients for extra flavor. I also used coconut oil which can be tasted in the pancakes. They  cook fast, golden, moist and fluffy. One batch yielded 7 1/4 cup pancakes for me.

I didn't change a thing.
We aren't vegan, but my kids have several friends who are. We've made these on mornings after sleepovers and my picky kids love them as much as their friends! 
The batter looks really runny, but they don't spread much and they cook up perfectly.

Yes I would make it again. I added in a mixture of cinnamon and sugar in place of the 2 T of sugar.  Not as sweet and added a little zest to the flavor.

This was so fun to make with my boys (4 & 6 yrs). I doubled the recipe and used half whole wheat flour for a boost of protein and fiber. I wisked the oil with 1/2 cup water, then added 2c almond milk. I decided after we were making them to top with homemade jelly, but my boys devoured them before I could put it on top...fine by me--less sugar :-) This was not only yummy but also fun! I would add that I am glad I doubled the recipe. One batch would not have been enough for the three of us. One batch would probably be enough for 2-3 people if you are eating this with fruit or other side dish.

These were delicious, but I recommend reducing the water to one cup. They were way too thin when I followed the recipe. You will not miss the milk and eggs.

Yes, they're vegan which is awesome but... I've made these pancakes 3 times and they've never turned out anywhere near good. I love that you can find all these ingredients in your pantry but I honestly wouldn't make them again :(

Good result, I love the simple recipe. Not as fluffy as I hoped but for me the small prep time is worth it. I only added a little vanilla extract. Ate with some jam and chocolate chips!

I only added 1 extra tablespoon of sugar. That is only because it makes the pancake sweeter and I don't have to use syrup. It is a really awesome pancake. ????????

Great alternative to non vegan pancakes. 
My only changes was to substitute the white sugar for raw coconut sugar as white processed is incredibly unhealthy. I'm not even sure why the recipe calls for sugar to be added.
I also substituted the water for coconut milk for a creamier pancake. 
I would have given 5 stars but I couldn't because of the white sugar. 
However, as far as the not being good enough for 5 stars purely because it's vegan is a ridiculous notion, I automatically rate non vegan food much lower because of the cruelty involved. 

In my opinion, no non vegan food can be 5 star.

I used this as the base for a baked doughnut.  I added 1.5 tbs cinnamon, 1 tbs vanilla, 1 tbs maple syrup, .5 tbs nutmeg and two thirds of a apple: diced.  I then topped them with a maple cinnamon glaze (3 tbs maple syrup, 2 tbs water, 1 tbs cinnamon, enough icing sugar to make it pasty).

Made these for my non-vegan boyfriend and he loved them. They were the perfect amount of sweetness and they were so light and fluffy. I replaced the water with soy milk and used self raising flour instead.

I ran out of almond milk and this recipe saved breakfast, my son is super picky and loved them!
I replaced white sugar with date sugar, flour with whole grain, and the oil with coconut oil.
I added a tad more water than indicated , they are delicious.

Family really lIked these.  However, I did make changes.  I added 1 tsp. Cinnamon and 1 tsp. Vanilla.  I also add 1 pat butter on top left to melt when serving. With  these  changes  was  good.  Without  these  changes  was just  ok.  Made four times in one day.

I liked this recipe very much! I am a new vegan, and something I very much missed was the mornings with pancakes and syrup. This recipe brought that back! The pancakes tasted like the real thing, except my batch were kinda chewy. But all in all, I will be making this again. Hell, I plan on making it now!

I'm so excited about this recipe! The last time I tried to make healthy pancakes my son said they were disgusting. I gave these a try but added cinnamon, vanilla, and almond flour. AMAZING.  He finished one in less than 30 seconds. The addition of almond flour  cuts down on the carbs and makes them taste like snickerdoodles!!

Great recipe! I add vanilla extract and cinnamon for a little more flavor, and sometimes chocolate chips if I have them. Probably the best pancakes recipe I've ever used. Versatile, simple, and delicious.

Great vegan pancake recipe, if you have a problem with the way white sugar is processed I'm sure you can substitute out the white sugar for raw sugar. Also, I strongly recommend adding some cinnamon and vanilla extract  for it to taste more flavorful. Overall it is a great recipe I have been making for nearly a year for myself.

Tasted pretty good. Although I did make some changes. Instead of sugar I used agave nectar and also added vanilla and almond milk!

Super easy, and unlike most recipes, I don't need eggs!  Since I am gluten free, I have to make most things from scratch.  These work perfect with my gluten free flour without making any adjustments.  I can mix it with just some milk.  These are fluffy, and very tasty.

A great, simple recipe. I adjusted the ingredients for 1 serving, added a splash of soy milk and less than a tablespoon of coconut yogurt. I used coconut oil as the oil for the batter and also for cooking. It went great with a quick fruit compote I made while making these :)

Just made a batch of these and they are the best vegan pancakes I have made. I am giving these 5 stars as vegan pancakes because that's what the recipes for. However I wouldn't notice the difference if someone made these for me and didn't tell me they were vegan. I did decided to replace 1/4 a cup of water with soy milk and then I added cinnamon of half the batch both were equally good. These are really good and are fluffy and soft not flaky like other recipes I have made. They have a nice rich and oddly butter flavor. This will be my to go to vegan pancakes for now on. I skipped the oil all together and used my non stick porcelain pan. Thank you for the recipe! I will add some pictures of mine :)

I am surprised! Fluffy pancakes without eggs or milk!! The kids didn't want stew that we were having and wanted pancakes for supper but I was out of eggs, figured I'd give this a try... And success! Even my 15 year old didn't taste a difference from my usual recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this recipe many times.  Quick, easy, and makes plenty for 2-3 people!  The pancakes are a bit dense but very tasty.   I sometimes add frozen blueberries but be careful!  The change the consistency And temperature of the batter because of the extra liquid they add and because they're cold so I don't get such beautiful round results....but I do get delicious blueberries in my pancakes!

I loved this simple recipe! I did change a few things the second time I made them. I used 1 cup unsweetened almond milk and 1/4 cup water. Also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and some cinnomin. So good!

Great start! After reading the comments, I used raw sugar, added 1/4 almond milk, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, 3 oz apple sauce, 1/4 c extra flour.  They browned beautifully and were super delicious (even according to my carnivorous, pancake-loving, vegan-skeptic hubby).

My daughter has a cows milk protein allergy and is very sensitive to egg too. She's always missing out on foods everyone else enjoys so when it came to pancake day last year I set out to make sure she could join in the fun. 
The whole family love these, in fact they work better than traditional pancakes.

I think this recipe is excellent, although I did modify it a little so I could make waffles by adding an additional tablespoon of oil. I also replaced half the water with soy milk, and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Overall, the texture was fabulous, and I've made it twice in a week. I can't wait to try it as pancakes!

I followed the recipe as is and I have to say it was DELICIOUS. I am new to becoming a vegan and I love breakfast so I had to make sure that I can still eat what I like. I was extremely pleased. So happy that I found this recipe. I will absolutely make them again and again and....again.

I used pre sifted self rising flour since that's what I have on hand. The batter turned out foamy, fluffy (and it wasn't thick at all) while pan was heating. Pancakes turned out light and fluffy. This recipe's a keeper.

I added cinnamon and vanilla as well, and also a little dash of soy milk to reduce thickness in my batter. Definitely making this again, I was so impressed that they came out much better than store brands.

I made this as is, just doubled up the recipe. It made a lot, enough for 2 breakfasts for a family of 3. It was amazing...the taste and just how quickly they cooked. And you can either eat these as a  sweet meal or savory. Loved it! Thank you for the recipe.

We're not vegan, but my pregnant wife wanted pancakes and we were out of eggs so I found this recipe. Everyone in the house loved these. This isn't a great 'alternative' recipe for pancakes, this is a great recipe, period.

These are a great alternative for when I'm out of milk and craving pancakes. Added pumpkin pie spice and some vanilla. They were delicious!

This recipe is great for those allergic to eggs like my son and tastes fabulous.  It has a slight buttery taste which is lovely. I also added half a teaspoon of vanilla essence  and a hint of cinnamon for flavour also as I thought  the batter was a tad bit thick I added a dash of milk, however I think it would have been okay if I hadn't.

Was extremely dry and clumpy.  Needed to add almost a cup of almond milk to make it spreadable &  moist and then they wouldn't stick together at all.  Needs a binder like bananas or flaxseeds.

1 1/4 cups of flour and 1 1/4 cups of water? Mine came out like crepes. Batter not thick at all.  I added 1/2 cup flour to the batter and it got thicker and much better. Will definitely modify this for next time.

This was more like a crepe than a pancake. Must be very thin to be able to cook it through.

I've made this recipe twice now, and both times it turned out great.  I love that it is a quick and easy recipe that I don't need to have an egg substitute on hand for.  Throw in a few vegan chocolate chips and I have a happy kid.

These are very bland - just flour and water,  and I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top.  I made the recipe because it is cholesterol free and low fat.  It did fill my craving for pancakes.

They were honestly perfect!!! Some other vegan pancake recipes I've tried have turned out incredibly thick and bready, but these were perfect size, texture and flavour!
Just out of personal preference I substituted a little bit of water for almond milk and I added a bit if vanilla and they turned out great:)

Made these slightly to thick but then again I was aiming for flapjacks, a little gooie in the middle which I learnt to enjoy, used the non stick flat grill to make topped with lemon juice and Strawberries used 1 tb sugar  in mixture and added the additional sprinkling on top.. plus a little more..   was a little to on the salty side opt to use 1/4 tp salt, will make again,great variation if you have no plant milk.

My five year old and I loved them! They were super easy and I had all of the ingredients on hand. I did add one mashed banana, vanilla, and cinnamon because I love banana pancakes!  The type of oil isn't specified, but I used coconut oil which gave it a nice flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

These pancakes were GREAT!  Better than the "normal" recipes with milk and eggs.  I'm definitely keeping this recipe handy---it's wonderful to have a breakfast option when the milk, eggs, and oatmeal have run out!

I made these pancakes this morning and they were great! I cooked them a little shorter than "normal" because I like that dense, chewy texture. I served them with Earth Balance Original Buttery Spread, Wild Elderberry Jelly, and a glass of Almond Breeze Reduced Sugar Vanilla Almond Milk. A great breakfast! Thanks for sharing this recipe, NICDELIS! :)

I just found my new GO-TO pancake recipe! Although these are not very healthy, at least they are vegan! My nine year old boys and I loved them!  They cooked up beautifully and they are incredibly simple.  All pantry staples, no special ingredients required!

This was awesome! :) I made a few adjustments:
- 1 tsp true cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- coconut sugar instead of brown/white 
- 1/4 cup additional flour. 

Then for the moistness (in a separate bowl):
- 1/2 over ripe banana  mashed
- Flax Mixture ( 6 1/2 tbsp chilled water w/ 2 tbsp flax meal)
- Mix water, oil and flax gel/banana mixture together

And mix together as normal

Over all, the recipe was  surprisingly good! I had to swap out one ingredient because white sugar isn't vegan, But I was surprised to find out that this tasted, and had a texture of real pancakes!

I've made this a handful of times now and it's always good! I usually add cinnamon & vanilla, but even when I forget to, they are still delicious. I have three kids and they all love it! Light & fluffy and wholesome ingredients. Definitely my go-to recipe for pancakes!

Made these pancakes and I really do not like pancakes but I thought they were good.  My family all gave these cakes a five star.  I did use Earth balance (a vegan butter substitute) in the pan then wiped the excess out instead of the oil in the pan.  Made some plain and some blueberry pancakes and they all turned out great.  Cooks like any other recipe.  Makes about 7-8 pancakes 5" in diameter.

Of the three times I've made vegan pancakes, I've never had such a great result. I loved them!!! I added a little bit of vanilla and coconut butter.

I made this vegan recipe because I ran out of milk.   I added a few chocolate chips for the kids and they ate them all.  I didn't really notice a difference between this recipe and non vegan.  Great recipe.

I have looked a lot for different pancake recipes for my husband and daughter who are both very picky and only like aunt Jemima but this one is excellent. They both love that it's moist and thinner. I added vanilla and cinnamon and they were super tasty we didn't need to add syrup. Thanks for sharing! We love these pancakes.

Delicious pancakes, however there was bit of trial and error involved for me.
I'd definitely suggest adding more baking soda if you want to get that fluffly texture, and keep the heat at low medium to medium. Flip them as soon as you possibly can, otherwise the pancakes get burnt. Adding in some vanilla extract also makes them smell even better! ;)

Best pancake recipe ever and plus it's vegan too! It was quite easy to prepare and doesn't involve any hard to find ingredients. I added blackberries, ground almonds and desiccated coconut as toppings at the end. It was so delicious. Love it!

Fantastic! Very fluffy! 

I did make a few changes: 
I added 1 TSP of Vanilla; 
I used maple syrup instead of white sugar; multigrain flour instead of white flour; and almond 'buttermilk' instead of water (1-¼ cups almond milk + ½ TBSP of apple cider vinegar).

I have made these pancakes several times with a few adjustments. I use a gluten-free flour blend, coconut palm sugar instead of white, substitute half the oil with apple sauce. Sometimes I'll add a few dark chocolate chunks. SO GOOD. I absolutely love them with a bit of Earth Balance and maple syrup. Very quick and simple to make :)

Made these for a vegan houseguest yesterday and my husband said they were my best pancakes ever! I didn't have any vegetable oil so I used coconut oil, and after tasting the first two pancakes I decided to add a bit more sugar into the batter.

I made this recipe with a cap of vanilla. It was the best tasting pancake I had ever made. My mother who is allergic to meat proteins loved it and she is not a fan of sweet things. The aroma of the vanilla and heavenly and so tasty.

These turned out great! I had some fresh blueberries that I needed to use so I tossed them in a little flour (to prevent bleeding) and folded them into the batter right before cooking them on the griddle. They turned out perfect! I also made a couple without blueberries for a more picky family family member and he said he couldn't tell that they were vegan.

I am a nanny and when the parents don't have any eggs in the house this is my go-to breakfast for the kids. They eat them right up! I add blueberries to the pancakes and they love them even more. A banana on the side completes this easy breakfast.

These were delicious and no one would know that they were vegan (if you have anti-vegan eaters in your household). A few things I like to add/change for my own personal preference: I used 1/2 cup coconut milk and 3/4 cup water for the liquid portion, added a few dairy-free chocolate chips and fried in vegan "butter" (the brand is called Earth Balance and it's excellent!). Bon appetit everyone!

I was hungry and didn't want to go to the store.  I had all of the ingredients in the pantry, so I thought I would give it a spin.  Perfect!  They were quick, easy, and tasty.  I did add 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract ... and I would recommend cooking them on high heat to get them to a nice, golden brown.  But this is a highly recommended recipe!

I was a little nervous at first because the batter was super thin when we poured in the wet ingredients.  They came out okay though!  Very delicious.  My girlfriend is vegan and she really appreciated the simple recipe with fest taste.  :)

Awesome vegan pancakes!! I did half a cup of rice milk and the rest water. Turned out really good. I would add some vanilla bean paste next time though. 
A bonus is this mix works awesome for waffles as well. I did up a batch in the pan and a batch in the waffle iron and they both came out awesome!!
Thanks for the recipie!!

This was incredibly simple and quick. I didn't have milk on hand so I looked for an alternative, amd im glad I found this recipe!  Tbh, I like this better than recipes with milk. 
I did use the oil with the water, but used butter when it came to making them in the pan. yummy!

Like other reviewers said, these pancakes are not as dense as ones with milk or eggs. I let the batter sit for 10 minutes or so before cooking.  I tripled the recipe (but put less water) and it yielded 22 fluffy pancakes. I spread a thin layer of leftover bacon grease on each pancake. My husband was raving about them.

I was skeptical of vegan pancakes at first but to my surprise they were delicious!  I did not add the salt and I used organic sugar since regular white sugar is not vegan (who wants bones in their sugar?!).  Honestly, they tasted a lot like white cake to me but not overly sweet at all.  I will definitely make them again!!

These pancakes are quite good and very simple to make. First time, I made them as written and for the oil I used organic virgin coconut oil. I try to avoid canola or vegetable oils because of gmos. This morning  I made them again but used whole wheat flour, added half a mashed banana and a teaspoon pure vanilla extract along with the coconut oil and I enjoyed them even more! Thank you for the recipe, definitely a keeper!

Son really wanted pancakes but we were out of eggs.  This was excellent with a milk substitution for the water!  Had to make a 2nd batch!

I modified this recipe a little. I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk instead of water, and added vegan chocolate chips and 1/8 tsp orange extract. The were delicious!! And so fast and easy to make!! I will be making these often.

A WONDERFUL addition to my personal Vegan cookbook/menu. A few minor changes to keep from any Gallstone flair-ups; such as, omitting oil and sugar. As an alternative, I used applesauce and agave nectar. THANK YOU for sharing this DELICIOUS recipe; I've  been craving pancakes and waffles since becoming a Vegan 5 months ago!

I had an urgent need for pancakes for dinner tonight, so as usual I headed to allrecipes.com to see what was there. I found this recipe, and after reading some of the reviews, I used 1 cup of rice milk and 1/4 cup of water as Odiebear's Mom did. I actually had to add about two teaspoons of additional water after I mixed everything to together because the batter just felt like it needed to be a tad more loose. I made 9 pancakes and ate three, freezing 6 for use later. The taste was actually better than nonvegan recipes I have used because no animals were abused or used to make them. As Martha would say, "That's a very good thing."  :) I would add a p.s. to make sure your griddle or pan is pretty hot before putting your batter in. That way the pancakes will bubble faster and be done in the middle!

The whole family enjoyed!

Love it...my family loves the pancakes. Also try adding  five spice by Mill Farm. It has cinnamon, anise, dextrose, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. This will make your taste buds explode from the flavors!!!

Thank you!  My husband said he wouldn't have known these were vegan if I hadn't told him. We added sliced bananas while they were on the griddle (because we LOVE sliced bananas in our pancakes!).  I also liked that this recipe is simple and doesn't need anything other than what you probably already have in your cupboard.

I've been making pancakes (vegan and non) for years and have never made pancakes as good as these. Light, fluffy and great tasting. I'd submit a photo but we ate them too fast. 
My only complaint is that I only got 6 pancakes from the above ingredients and we wanted more :) Will make a double batch next time.

Great recipe! I have the pancakes cooking as we speak and they are turning out delightful! I did make a few modifications to the recipe though. I added 2 Tbsp of rice milk, a tsp. of vanilla, and an extra Tbsp. of sugar, but that seems to hace done the trick!

I loved it! Cooked it as a afternoon breakfast and fell in love. I added 1 cup of soy milk and then 1/4 of water for a "milky" add to it. For flavor i added a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Trust me they are great!'

I always love it when I find a simple, delicious recipe that even the barest cabinets would have the ingredients for. Simply delicious, easy, light and fluffy!! I like mine a tad bit sweeter, so I use twice the amount of sugar. Enjoy

i made these for bf's breakfast and he said they were good.. they didn't cooked all the way through but i was also using a regular frying pan, not a griddle so the temperature may have been the issue.. thank God he's not picky.. the batter was a bit on the thick side so i thinned it out with a bit of water after i saw how the first pancake came out.. i was basically looking for a recipe that didn't require any eggs b/c we're out.. we were trying to use up some leftover cream cheese frosting so i only used half the sugar.. it worked.. ty for the recipe

These were Delicous & fluffy! 
Thank you for a basic pancake recipe. I didn't have to run to the store to get extra eccentric ingredients.
As a vegan, I rate actual butter milk pancakes a 1. This recipe is so darn good, easy & is def a 5!

i used 2 tbsp of oil, and used milk (yes i know not vegan) instead of water. they were really great. the batter is really thin at first, but after sitting for a few minutes thickens up.

Thanks for a great and easy recipe! I'm definitely not a cook and they came out looking like pancakes so that's a plus :) I substituted for whole grain flour and stevia instead of sugar and they tasted great. I don't even think I sifted it right, I pretty much just fluffed it a little with a fork. Added Vermont maple syrup, vegan butter, and strawberries. Yum!

I made these for the family when we had run out of practically everything, and they were way better than I thought they'd be! I actually liked them more than regular pancakes. We ate them with vanilla cream and I added extra sugar to them, but I have a sweet tooth so it's not really necessary.

These pancakes were amazing!
I changed some things; for starters i read the reviews of others who've tried it, so I knew that the pancakes would be on the pale side, and just waited till it started bubbling like regular pancakes to flip. i changed the water/oil part to 1 cup of milk and 1/4 of water. I also took the suggestions from others and added a little cinnamon and vanilla extract, and lastly i used butter in the pan rather than using the oil at all.
It came out really good, thank you! =)

I love these. My son and I enjoy them many days throughout the week/end! He can't have cows milk, or eggs, so this is a really great alternative to regular pancakes. We always add blueberries! Thanks for sharing!!!

Turned out great. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 un bleached flour, about a quarter cup soy milk, and a little extra water. Cut the sugar (I doubled the recipe so I cut it to 3 TB instead of 4), added about a tsp of vanilla and fresh blueberries.  Every pancake turned out nice-even the first batch.

I added a little Almond milk as needed just to get it to my desired consistency. Other than that they were delicious! My 3 year old really enjoyed them!!

It wasn't a "flavor explosion", but it was a great way to deliver maple syrup to my mouth. Cook pancakes for around a minute and a half on each side over MEDIUM LOW heat \

we really like this recipe. I have made it as is, and with adding different ingredients such as blueberries, chocolate chips, bananas and strawberries. They always taste yummy. Thank you for allowing me to make my dairy, soy, and egg allergy son something so yummy.

I was looking for a very simple vegan pancake recipe to take camping. I plan to mix up the dry ingredients ahead of time and put in zip lock bags. This recipe is perfect, except I changed it to whole wheat flour.

Pretty good go to pancake recipe. I like my pancakes more cakey, but these definitely work in a pinch. I do add some vanilla extract to them as well.

Great base recipe!  I made the following changes: (a) one cup of whole wheat flour; (b) 1/2 cup ground oats; (c) vanilla yogurt instead of oil; (c) omitted the sugar.  I made these for my 11-month-old.  I served them with pureed stewed apricots.  They were a big hit :)

My god, these are phenomenal, i see no reason to make any other recipe ever again. Scraping by till pay day always takes me to vegan recipes and they are always the best. I added the cinnamon and vanilla that so many others mention, and had about 1/2 cup of plain yogurt that I used in the wet ingredients. Never looking back.

Very good. I only put one teaspoon of sugar to make the taste neutral and it was perfect for either salty or sweet topping.

I didn't have any oil or substitute so I just made these with the dry ingredients and water, added a little vanilla and cinnamon for flavour.  I did add a tiny bit more water for consistency.  These pancakes cooked well and quickly - I did spread the batter around a little in the pan, but unlike other reviews mine came out cooked all the way through, no rubbery spot in the middle.   The consistancy of the cooked pancakes was maybe a little more rubbery than normal pancakes, but once I put on syrup they were perfect, no decernable difference from milk & egg recipes!  Yum yum yum am so glad to find this recipe, I haven't had eggs or milk for a while and just ran out of oil/butter so am happy to find this!!!!!!

I have been trying to be vegan for the past month and wow with recipes like this, I can truly do this!  I made it with whole wheat flour and added cinnamon as someone suggested.  I did not use sugar, but added vanilla and maple syrup to my liquids.  Came out wonderful, thanks for the great recipe!

I'm a new mom and I'm breastfeeding but cows milk upsets my baby's stomach. I was craving pancakes and didn't think I could make them without milk then I found this recipe. They turned out better than expected.  I did use coconut oil with added a yummy flavor to it but they were delicious, even my hubby agreed they were probably the best pancakes he has ever had!

These pancaked were surprisingly delicious and easy to make! The only word of warning I would give is that the batter yields a larger amount of pancakes than I originally thought. Buuuuuut they are absolutely mouth watering so no one in my house is really complaining :D

These were decent, but the batter was way too thick. It wouldn't spread at all when it hit the pan. I added almond milk to thin the batter out, and the consistency was much better. It was my toddler's first time eating pancakes, and she loved them. They have a hint of sweetness to them, which I enjoyed.

I loved these! We are not Vegan at all (Meat Lovers Here) However my two youngest children are allergic to both Dairy and Eggs so in baking I must go for the Vegan recipes. I love this recipe for the simply fact that they taste just like regular pancakes and my kids love them! My non-allergic child loves them even better then regular pancakes so I'll stick with this recipe :D

These were great! We are on an elimination diet so no eggs and dairy for now, as well as having a weekend visitor who is extremely allergic to eggs, so these are a life saver! A slightly different texture than regular fluffy pancakes, but good overall! Like others we found the batter a little thick so we added a little coconut milk to it. I made them again with blueberries and they were awesome! Thanks for a great recipe that we'll use again and again :)

i have made these several times now and they are PERFECT. They turn a really nice golden brown in my cast iron skillet. I'll try to upload pics. This recipe doesn't have milk or eggs like typical pancakes and it turned out awesome and even better knowing it didn't have animal bodily fluids in it. I use this recipe and have even added pumpkin pie spice and shredded carrots. I also like the fact that it still turns out great without almond or soy milk. So glad you posted this!

Delicious pancakes! I made as directed except added 2 tsp vanilla extract. The batter was very thin, and I felt I needed to add 3 T. flour. And then I still got 1/4 inch pancakes, at best! But the flavor was great, not like buttermilk pancakes, but reminded me of crepes. My wife liked them better than the Bisquick pancakes I usually make. I cooked them in a non-stick skillet, and sprayed a little Pam at first, but then I realized I didn't even need that. They cook quickly on med-high heat, 2-3 minutes each side, but they come out very light colored. The texture may have been very slightly gummy, but this may have been because I over-stirred the batter and only let it sit a few minutes before cooking. I'm not a vegan, but wanted to try lower-calorie pancakes, and I will be making these again.

Great recipe....my children loved it. We have a son with numerous and severe food allergies, and I was excited to find a recipe that did not involve any of his trigger foods. The only thing I did different was used whole wheat organic flour (we can't use any other because of allergic reactions) and instead of baking powder- which we can't use either, I simply used baking soda and it came out great! They loved it and were even asking for seconds!!!

I was in the middle of making another pancake recipe when I realized that we didn't have any eggs left. A quick search led me to this recipe and it didn't disappoint! They were fluffy, delicious, and turned out perfectly brown each time. Best when eaten immediately. Because I had already started with another recipe, I already had 3/4 cup rice milk with 2 tbsp vinegar so I filled up to 1 1/4 c with water. I recommend it whether you are vegan or not!

Great recipe, made delish pancakes.
It was my 1 time making them so i had literally no idea about anything.
The only changes i made was not adding salt and using RAW sugar, which is truly vegan (and healtier btw).

These pancakes were very good. I followed the recipe and added cinnamon and vanilla to the batter. They were sweet without being overly sweet.

I had a vegan friend come to visit for breakfast. The batter for these are super thick! Don't thin it out. Once you get it on the griddle smoosh the batter a bit so that the pan. Three stars cause I had to add spices to make these taste good and cause they aren't like non vegan pancakes. If I were vegan, this might be a 4 star recipe.

WOW YUMMY. I was out of eggs and the kids wanted chocolate chip pancakes so I quick looked up vegan pancakes and this was on top so I gave it a whorl. Last time I tried one they were all rubbery and gross so I wasn't expecting much - WOW five stars! We added chocolate chips and bananas. I also mixed some vanilla soy milk in for the water to up the nutritional content.

I thought it was a great base recipe :) I added vanilla and chia to mind and it tasted amazing! barly wanted any syrup! I think subbing halve the water with orange juice would tast great to, or add strawberries and vanilla, endless possibilities! Thanks for posting it ^_^

These were okay.  I added about 1/2 tsp of vanilla and the flavor wasn't bad, but I've had better pancakes.  We actually prefer Bisquick mixed with soy milk (no eggs) over this recipe.  These didn't brown well and were just a little bit gummy.  I did sift the dry ingredients together and only mixed until everything was wet.  Not a horrible recipe to use in a pinch, but I'll keep looking and stick with Bisquick until I find a better eggless pancake recipe.

My niece wanted some pancakes and since i'm eating a vegetarian diet, no eggs in my house. I googled vegan pancakes and this recipe popped up as #1. I decided to give it try and was not disappointed! Easy and quick recipe. Huge hit with my niece who proclaimed, "Auntie these pancakes are delicious!"

These are the best vegan pancakes! I confess I tweaked the recipe, but even with alterations they came out perfectly. I reduced the flour by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed soaked in 1/4 cup of the water to boost the nutrition content. I substituted 2 TBS maple syrup for the sugar and added 1 cup of frozen blueberries. I learned that it was important to add oil to the pan between batches, the last batch was golden brown on both sides. I used safflower oil in the pan. Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

It tastes good. I added vanilla and spices and substituted soy milk for half of the water. They came out really runny and cooks up really flat. Also they didn't cook in the middle very well. I used a griddle, so I just put the cover on it and "baked" the pancakes that way. Having said that, I appreciate the recipe for producing a pretty tasty pancake without using eggs.

my son is allergic to eggs and I have been trying to find a pancake recipe for about 3 yrs. now.  I have tried every vegan, eggless pancake recipe on the planet and this is hands down the best I have ever tried.  everyone in the house loved them not just my son.  This is the absolute best eggless pancake recipe ever.  I did add a dash of cinnamon and 1 tsp. of vanilla though.  they came out light, fluffy, and delicious, thank you so so much.

These pancakes are great! A wonderful alternative to recipes that use milk and egg, which my son is allergic to, as texture and taste are much like non-vegan pancakes. Another great advantage about these are that you pretty much always have everything you need in the house to make them (whereas buttermilk or egg is not necessarily always in the house).

A thumbs up from me!
I did make a few minor changes: 
Removed the sugar 
I also added 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  
For half of them, I added chopped frozen strawberries.  
Both the plain and the strawberry were delicious!!
Previously, I hadn't realized that vegan pancakes were even possible!  You just made my Sunday morning! :D

This was amazing! The pancakes were delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used almond milk instead of water. My boy friend, who is used to the non-vegan pancakes couldn't tell the difference. Thank you so much for the recipe!!

I made silver dollar pancakes with these, and they were as good or better than most I've had. I put extra virgin coconut oil (a brand is packaged as a butter substitute) in the pan and they came out with a great buttery flavor.

These are delicious! I couldn't believe how much they rose! They were very fluffy and just plain delicious. I added a little vanilla for more flavor the second time-- just as good!

This was great!  I usually make pancakes with a store bought mix, and these are a bit thinner than those, but I prefer my pancakes thin.  I couldn't tell a difference in taste from these and regular pancakes.  I think they would be especially great with some fresh fruit, but I didn't have any.  I dressed them with honey.

I originally tried this because I was out of eggs, but now it's my default recipe. The texture is great; I add a little vanilla but change nothing else. Be warned that the "nine pancakes" this makes are quite small--I halved the recipe and made one large (but not ridiculously large) pancake. For three people I'd probably double it.

Wow! These are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, and had no problems. Loved how fast these are to make, the simple ingredient list, and that they are cheaper than regular pancakes. Of course, they lack the buttermilk flavor typical in most pancakes, but still taste so good. Second time I made them I added 1/2 t. vanilla extract and that was good too. It made 6 pancakes, which was enough to give me and my husband a very satisfying breakfast along with some fruit. We have this for breakfast a couple times a week now. Thanks so much!!!!!

These have served me well. My friend Sara loves them, and even though she is no longer vegan, she requests for these anyway. Fantastic recipe, much better than a mix!

They are pretty good. They could use something else though, maybe cinnamon. I was satisfied.

These are delicious!  I've been looking for lactose-free pancakes, and these are great.  I think they look and taste like any other buttermilk pancake.

This recipe was sooo good. We adapted it to make them gluten free (3/4 cup white rice, 2 cup potato starch, 1 tsp xantham gum) and I subbed brown sugar for the white sugar, added cinnamon (for color), and a bit of vanilla. We loved them! Will definitely make again! Thanks!!!
