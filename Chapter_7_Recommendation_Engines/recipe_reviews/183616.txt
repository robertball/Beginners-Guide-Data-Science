This is really a great recipe!! The fudge is so smooth and creamy.....you can also use white chocolate or dark chocolate! This recipe is really very flexible. My mom has also used white chocolate and mix in crushed Oreo cookies ....yummmmm! Give it a try you won't be sorry!!!

Same as my mom's fudge recipe only hers called for 1 teaspoon of vanilla and a little butter if your wanting soft fudge. Love it. Super easy. Sometimes I add nuts.

I have returned to edit my review.  I have left the original review here, but after waking up from my nap, the one I had melted at low heat had firmed up far better than the higher heat one.  It had some congealed fat visible on it, but not as much as I would have expected, and when it was cut up it was not a problem.  Still far from my favorite fudge, but the ease of making it makes it worthwhile, I think.>>>>>>>  previous review>>>>>I made this with Ghirardelli 60% cocoa chocolate chips.  I made two batches.  The first seized up s the fat separated from the rest and I ended up with very greasy fudge.  I thought maybe medium (I used setting 5 out of 12 settings on my cooktop, so it was a low-medium) was too hot, so I made it on setting 1.  It did the exact same thing.  I'm not sure what I could do differently, so I think I will use a more traditional recipe next time.

Very tasty! Simple and quick! My daughter said a 5, but hubby and I didn't think it firmed up as nice as we would have liked. I will do this again, but let it cook a little longer. I hope that may help with firming it up.

i use my microwave oven to make this recipe.  It was the fudge recipe my mom used for years but we do add a tsp or so of vanilla at the end of cooking.  I cook for  30 seconds at a time and then mix   put back in microwave and re do until all is melted and well incorporated.   It is much easier than cooking on stove top which i have been know to scorch from time to time.  I then put it in the fridge to get it to set up faster as my family can not wait 2 to 3 hours for it to  harden   i  hope this helps those that have had some trouble

I made this fudge about 4 hours ago adding a cup of walnuts and it STILL isn't set up. It tastes great!  I would be okay eating it with a spoon but the wax paper is securely stuck :~(

I have altered this recipe dramatically not only do I prepare in the microwave. I also have experimented with other chips as well. I used white chips, Maple extract, and walnuts. family loves it.

Used hersheys semi sweet chips and off brand milk, added a tsp butter when i took it of the heat and added too many walnuts. Kinda turned into walnut cluster type thing. No complaints is insanely good. Definate keeper.

I absolutely love the flavor of this fudge! The only problem I had was it didn't not set to my liking. It is very gooey and stuck to the foil for dear life. I will use this recipe again but will be making sure to cook longer like other reviewers say. Mmm delicious!!
