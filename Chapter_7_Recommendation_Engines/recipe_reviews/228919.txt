Only modification I made was I baked at 350 degrees for 40 minutes and that was just to ensure the tortilla's were crispy. Easy, inexpensive and very tasty. My husband said to add it to our regular rotation.

I put it in the oven at 350 for about 30mins instead of the microwave.  I also added chopped jalepenos to the onion mix as we like things spicy.  Turned out great!

This was ridiculously easy and pretty good for how easy it was. I followed the other recommendations to try baking it; I also substituted a thin layer of salsa for the green chilies since I forgot to purchase those at e store. Used a store brand raspberry jalapeño salsa; the little hint of sweet was awesome. I would recommend that the tortillas be chopped up before layering into the pan just because it was a little difficult to serve out of the pan with large pieces of tortilla especially if they overlap. Had to use a steak knife to make serving sizes and then on the plate it was a little difficult to cut up. We just had to take big mouthfuls which wasn't such a bad thing considering how tasty it came out!

I only used one can of chiles as that is what I had. I also sliced up the tortillas for easy cutting after cooking. It was VERY saucy...if any one likes drier enchiladas then omit the sour cream or serve on the side. I baked in the oven for 30 minutes...it was enjoyed by all.

I made this casserole and it turned out wonderful! The only change I made was using fresh poblano chilis (which I just happened to have on hand instead of canned). I diced the chilis and sautéed them with the onions. We like spicy so I also added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. This was easy and delicious.

I thought it was good but not great. It needs more zestiness iness. I'm not a chef and I don't know what to add to it. I didn't need to chop up the tortillas we could cut it up with a fork. My whole family liked it. It was definitely a hit. I will be making this again for sure.

I also baked it at 350° for about 45 minutes. It is just me and the roommate, so I took the leftovers to work and It was a big hit. Haha Everyone was very impressed!

Wow! My family loved it. Its so easy. I doubled the recipe because I used a slightly larger pan and wanted it tall like lasagna. I also split the corn tortillas in half and then layered them seams against the pan for a nice complete layering. I also cooked the chicken and onion and then added all the other ingredients to it to warm it up before layering. Baked at 375 degrees for 30 minutes. A keeper! Thank you

I chose to make this because I don't have the use of an oven or stove right now. I made a couple of changes using ingredients on hand and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I omitted the butter and onions (no stove). Instead I substituted hot salsa for the green chiles to get the flavor and some added heat. I also used ranch-flavored sour cream dip instead of plain sour cream and mixed it in a bowl with the cream of chicken soup. It was very easy flavorful and filling!

My family loved this dish.... The flavor is uniquely outstanding. I followed the ingredients exactly but baked it at 350 for 30 minutes. My husband wants me to make this every week ( which is fine by me as it is exceptionally easy and does not require exotic ingredients!)

I couldn't bring myself to cook it in the microwave. I cooked the tortillas in oil before assembling and then baked it in the oven so what I am rating here is the flavor. Which was ok. I think I'll go with a more traditional/authentic recipe next time tho.

My husband and I thought it was just okay as written. If I ever were to make it again I'd add a lot of spice to give it more depth.

Well I baked in oven as well just preference & I also added salsa & it was awesome! Really enjoyed it it could work for steak or ground beef as well. Next time I believe I will use tortilla strips out of the bag just to give it more crunch. Overall loved the recipe!

This was a DE-licious recipe! The only things I did differently was use flour tortillas and omitted the green chiles. Yummy!

My family loves this! I use rotisserie chicken and mix it along with the green chiles into the onions after they cook then add the soup and sour cream. I layer the tortillas creamy chicken/onion mix and cheese. so easy and yummy!

Great, but instead of cooked chicken, I cubbed raw chicken breasts then added them to the sautéed onions and cooked until done, added salt, pepper and cumin, mixed together in skillet a few minutes. I cooked the soup and sour cream after removing the chicken pieces from the skillet.
