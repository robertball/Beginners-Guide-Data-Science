These were very good. I only had regular carrots, so I sliced them and steamed them. One of my kids loved them, the other one not so much.
I thought it was a nice change.

I sliced fresh organic whole carrots, steamed them in the microwave for 2 min 15 seconds, and drizzled on the maple syrup-butter mixture.  This was a nice side dish for a roasted pork loin, mashed potatoes, and freshly-cooked apples.  It really doesn't get much easier than this.

I love my carrots like this. I add a little more salt for that sweet/salty contrast. Very simple!

Made this yesterday. Roasted the carrots instead of boiled them and used large carrots cut up as I didn't have baby carrots. It was very tasty.

Used frozen sliced carrots which I cooked on the stove. Added the butter and syrup to the pan after I drained the carrots. Loved the flavor. It's a keeper.

Easy to make.  Choose this to get a super picky eater to try carrots because said child loves maple syrup.  These were too sweet for me but my picky kid did try a bite, gave a thumbs up but refused to eat anymore.

This was a pretty good, easy recipe.  I used whole carrots cut into sticks.  The cooking time on the carrots is way off.  You shouldn't go over 8 min.  Maybe baby carrots are tougher (haven't used them for ages, the whole are so much sweeter).

I added a tiny splash of cognac to the mix and they were the best glazed carrots I've tried! They were super easy and tasty.

This was lovely!  I had regular carrots on hand so cut those into thick (1/2-inch) medallions & roasted them.  The glaze was lovely.  I will definitely be making this again.

I don't know why I don't think to have cooked carrots more often..but I saw this recipe and knew I had to try it. Simple but tasty...I did add probably 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and that really brought it over the top....Very good...Can't wait to have cooked carrots again!

They were very good.  I made it for an office luncheon, I cut regular carrots(I like the taste better).  Had many compliments.  What doesn't taste good with butter and pure VT maple syrup.

I made these for Easter Dinner. My family LOVED them. The only thing I would change would be to cut back on some butter. We are trying to watch our fat intake. This time though I followed the recipe as written and everyone loved them.

Super easy and delicious! I steamed baby carrots and drizzled over the butter/syrup as directed. I sprinkled some no-salt seasoning on top, stirred it up, and good to go.

These were awsome and I am not a cooked carrot lover. I wanted seconds. I made this for my family and everyone loved them. I did use frozen carrots carrots, so I'll have to be careful next time, as they were a bit too soft. Will certainly make them again and again and again. . .

This recipe was easy and tasty!! I added a little cinnamon and nutmeg and used a bag of baby carrots but this is a great way to eat carrots! I’m not a big fan of carrots but this is a great way to switch things up!

Very Flavorful and easy.  Only little thing I added was brown sugar.  I love the contrast of sweet and salt.

Even the kids loved these carrots. I will definitely be making them again. I did roast the carrots instead of boiling them. PERFECTO!

This was an excellent recipe!  So easy and tasty too. I followed the recipe as written and it turned out great.  A big hit at this year's Thanksgiving feast.
