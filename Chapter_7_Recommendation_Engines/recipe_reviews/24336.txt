I think the pan size is stated wrong for this recipe (10x15) as the candy only filled about half the space.  Next time I would use 11x7 glass dish, which would make for more even candy sizes as the candy would be an even thickness.  

Cut the candy when it is still quite warm.  Next time I want to wrap individual pieces in waxed paper.

Fantastic recipe, thanks!  My four year old loves
this candy.  The recipe requires little in the way
of tending and the finished product is of sufficient texture to be broken by hand.

One reviewer said the temp needs to be at 240 degrees and this is incorrect.  That temp will produce a chewy-praline like consistency.  Butterscotch candy needs to be stirred constantly as the higher the temperature, the less water content and more concentrated the sugar becomes.  This means it can burn easily if not stirred constantly. Butterscotch needs to come up to the temperature of soft crack stage (see below)just as the submitter wrote.
. Soft-Crack Stage
270° F–290° F
sugar concentration: 95%
As the syrup reached soft-crack stage, the bubbles on top will become smaller, thicker, and closer together. At this stage, the moisture content is low. When you drop a bit of this syrup into cold water, it will solidify into threads that, when removed from the water, are flexible, not brittle. They will bend slightly before breaking.

Saltwater taffy and butterscotch are cooked to the soft-crack stage. 

By following this recipe exactly and stirring constantly, it will be awesome!

Great recipe and easy to make. I didn't use the vinegar but it came out fine. I didn't need to check if i cooked it long enough because when it all is golden brown to brown it is ready. Thanks. It tastes great too. Too clean up is easy too, just use hot water and it melts away if it gets stuck.

This is not a good recipe for butterscotch. It has no taste and smells awful.

I attempted this recipe 3 times. The first time i put it in a pot that was too large and it burned (my fault!). The second time I put it in a smaller pot. I waited for the candy thermometer to reach 280, and just as it did, it burned.... The third time I FINALLY got it right... but in my opinion it just wasn't worth the effort...

This is a great recipe from scratch! If it does not turn out correctly, it is an error on the cooks part, not the recipe. We cut it with buttered shears into bite sized pieces and then shake in a bag with sugar. Will keep for a while. Phenomenal unadulterated flavor. Thank you so much for a great recipe!!

Smelled like it was burning, and when it was cooled off it tasted burnt.  I will not use this recipe again.

Great recipe I love it everyone who I know who tried it loved it.  After making this a few times I changed it a little and turned into a butterscotch version of peanut brittle.  If you want to try all you have to do is before you put in the vanilla just add a half cup of sunflower seeds(I recommend unsalted or lightly salted as to not overpower the butterscotch).  Another tweak I made is to change out the white vinegar  for apple cider vinegar it really enhances the flavor and adds a whole new dimension to the butterscotch however I haven't experimented with both changes to the same batch but I believe that it would be delectable.

I made this candy for my husband who is picky about anything new.  HE LOVED IT!!!!!!  In fact I am making more this weekend.  One patch I am going to add cashews.  His favorite nut besides his kids.  I added the sugar to the warm candy and it was the perfect finish.

I followed the recipe as exactly as I could (I don't have a candy thermometer.), but it never came to the "threads in water" stage. I had to give up because the mixture actually started to burn. The grainy, taffy-like substance I ended up with tastes more like really good caramel than butterscotch.  I'll be making it again because it's so good, but still... Not very butterscotchy.

Easy & tasy.  Like the others said, breakable by hand, not by cutting... I even cut the recipe down to 10 servings and it still came out great!

Delicious! Just need to be patient and stir often as the consistency changes with the temperature... even if it separates as if totally ruined, keep moving and it will end beautifully and great flavor!!! I spread it on a silicon lined cookie sheet, sprinkled some chocolate chips, let them melt and spread it on top of candy... extra yummy!

We cooked this at school today. It was absolutely delicious! Very easy to make and most people with have the ingredients already in their pantry. Staff loved it too and kept coming back for more. I think it could make a great, economical gift, if you were to package it up. WARNING: watch your fillings! Ps. I agree with the other reviewer, a smaller tin is required.

Made it exactly as written. Cooked to hard crack stage. Dropped by teaspoonfuls onto buttered flat cookie sheet. Made butterscotch coins. Absolutely delicious. So simple I make it a lot. Most candy recipes I think twice about making but not this one.

The candy itself tastes very good-- even my mom, who hates sugary and sticky stuff, admitted that she liked it. The pan size is too big, a few sizes smaller would work out nicely. Also, I put my fire to the lowest setting to avoid burning, and it turned out well. :) When the syrup formed strands in the cup I found it still too watery, so I went on until it formed clumps that instantly sank.

I have made this so many times now and only issues i had were because of me not paying attention. Burnt it once. Let it stand to long prior to cutting and forgot the vanilla another time.   As for the tast when i do pay attention it is not much different to Werthers Original.

I used a heavy bottom pan. Its very forgiving. I used cider vinegar, suggested by Mennonite friends. Very nice flavor!  It is true: any recipe that requires boiling vinegar is going to smell atrocious on the stove.   However, it doesn't taste like it smells and is a wonderful treat in the end!  Hang in there.

I added a bit more butter and a little extra Bourbon Madagascar vanilla extract. As with all hard candy it takes a little finesse to avoid getting burnt or burning the sugar. I think other reviewers may have upped the heat to bring  the temp up quicker. This results in a burnt mess.  Take the time, don't rush and the candy is amazing. And always handle hot sugars carefully.  I did look up caramel vs butterscotch, and this is technically a butterscotch, though seems similar to caramel. Butterscotch is made with brown sugar, while caramel is granulated white sugar.

The addition of vinegar to a candy recipe is not for flavor, but to help avoid the sugar crystalizing.  Typically, the amount used is not enough to taste, in most cases, but it hugely affects the chemistry during the boiling process.   Just a little "kitchen trivia".  HTH!!!  And, Blessings!!!

This was my 1st time making candy. It tastes more like toffee- and I do believe I burnt it a bit. We tried this recipe because my 5 year old loves butterscotch candies and was curious how they are made. We skipped the vinegar on the second batch and prefer it this way.

The pan size is wrong on the recipe. I used a smaller glass dish which worked better. The candy looked fine, and it cooled perfectly, but when I tasted it it was completely burned. I think that may have been my fault though, because I wasn't paying attention and the heat went up to 295. I just don't know for sure because I'm not an advanced chef ;)Overall,if you're a good cook, I think this candy will turn out fine for you.

It tasted nice, but the pan size is incorrect. I used a 7 by 11 inch pan, and it still didn't fill it. So they were very thin, but tasty. I will try again in an even smaller pan...
