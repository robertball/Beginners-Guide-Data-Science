This is the type of stuffing I was raised on!  Mom was out of town & could not be reached - I needed her recipe for stuffing.  This is almost identical & turned out perfect.  Minimal time - Maximum taste!  Thanks, Mr. Bray!  You saved the day!  This one is "my" stuffing now, too!

I don't know if I'll try this again. It sounds like a good concept, but it needs to be played with. The seasoning wasn't quite right, either. Sorry Jim, I'll be hunting for another cornbread stuffing recipe. :(

Wonderful and easy.  Always did the box stuffing in the past, never again! Did not have chestnuts, but this a recipe where you can add or subtract and still great taste.
