I used green salsa and "4-Cheese Mexican" shredded cheese, so added some tanginess and spiciness.  This was a big hit with the family, very easy to prepare and satisfying.  We made an extra pan and put it in the freezer (without salsa)for the following week. The flavor was excellent, but the texture of the frozen one was a bit mushy.  Hopefully I can find away to freeze one more successfully, as it would be a great dish to have on hand for those extra-busy days.

I have made this recipe numerous times and have never had any leftovers! It is so creamy and delicious.  My coworkers request to have a pitch in just so I will bring this dish. I double and sometimes triple the recipe.

We made this recipe the other night and ate until we couldn't move. It is delicious. I have a young man who helps me with chores and he helped with this recipe and had to print it to take home to his family so he could make it for them. We all loved it. Thank you. It will be made frequently.

I also add about 1/4 cup green onions, and a small can of green chilis (peeled and diced) to the mixture, and sometimes slice black olives, then roll up.  If you don't like salsa on the top, mix the sour cream, soup, and chilis first, and set aside about 1/2 cup before adding the rest to the filling. After enchilladas are rolled up, add a little milk to the reserved soup mixture to make a sauce and pour over enchilladas before baking. Not too spicy for kids!

My husband and child liked this, but I found it just a little too bland, even when I was looking for a "comfort" food.
