This recipe was incredibly easy to make. Most importantly it was delicious!! I changed two things: i used the zesty nacho cheese soup instead of regular, and i doubled the amount of cayenne pepper. It was rich, thick and filling.

I fixed this again and discovered that this was very good in a thick bread bowl (absorbs the sauce)or over a baked potato.  Thanks for trying this!

I made this recently along with Allrecipe's Chicken Florentine Casserole and some fried yellow squash and zucchini.  It is a really good recipe.  Very flavorful and delicious.  Easy to make too.

This had a great visual appearance, but it tasted weird.  I think the shrimp and the cauliflower just don't go together.

I used the fiesta nacho cheese soup as one reviewer suggested, which I like better than just nacho cheese soup.  It didn't taste too cheesy to me as other readers wrote.

This was a hit on Thanksgiving. At first everyone thought it was a strange combo.  But after tasting it they fell in love! Next time I will add Velveeta or maybe cheddar cheese.

The taste was ok, but the consistency was much too runny.

did not care for this at all, nor did my kids or husband. Was pretty bland.
