I too used Southern Comfort laced egg nog. I left out the cinnamon and nutmeg. Was skeptical about all the different flavors going on plus the Southern Comfort egg nog added the unique flavor I was looking for. Don't be afraid of this one it is good!!! I did bone-in thighs and legs so the frying time will be longer.

I was skeptical but this turned out good. There is a lot of different flavors going on but it worked. I actually used eggnog with alcohol in it that I made and that added a nice touch too. The one thing I didn't really care for was the choice of the cut of chicken. I would have much preferred white meat. I didn't see the notes about cutting the thighs up into smaller pieces under after it was too late but that is something I recommend. This is definitely one I would make again when I have eggnog on hand.
