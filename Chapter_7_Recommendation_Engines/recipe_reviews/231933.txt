Just looking at this recipe I didn't see how you could incorporate 5 1/2 cups of flour into the specified liquid and only get 3 dozen cookies.  I cut the recipe down slightly so it used a stick of butter.  I ended up using 3 cups of flour and that was hard to mix in.  I didn't roll out the dough but opted to roll into walnut sized balls.  They flattened slightly but not much.  I think they needed to be rolled in sugar.  I think I ended up with about 3 dozen cookies.  I don't think I'll make these again.

I made them according to the amounts given exactly, and they came out just fine. They are soft and simple. If it's an old fashioned molasses cookie you're looking for, this is it.

I made these exactly to the recipe.  They turned out great. Rather than rolling them out on flour, I used nonstick foil on the bottom and waxed paper on top with no flour.  Dough didn't stick to either one. A lot less messy this way.

I love Ginger cookies.  I love molasses cookies.  This recipe satisfied both.  I added 2/3 cup of chopped crystallized Ginger for some added pop of ginger and sweetness.

I just made this recipe, as instructed. They turned out very well. If I had to make one adjustment, it would be to add a bit more flour. I felt it was a little too sticky, and stuck to the counters no matter how much I floured the surface. Other than that - DELICIOUS!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It wasn't either too dry or too sticky, of course doing it during the winter means the humidity was low which may have effected the sticky factor.  Using a full bottle of Brier Rabbit molasses, I don't see how it could ever be too dry.  Using 3 - 4 inch cookie cutters it made about 6 dozen cookies.  Using that size the baking time is closer to 6 - 7 minutes as I found out the hard way with my first cookie sheet.  The cookies are very hard, which is not the way we like them.  I put a couple pieces of bread in the container which softened them a lot.  As would be expected from that much molasses the taste is very strong.  I'm not sure if I'd make them again for us but might make a smaller batch if I want a tray with lots of different kinds of cookies.

The flavor lacked. My ingredients my not have been the best, but i would have added white sugar, shortening,and some vanilla. They cooked very quick and were easy cleanup.

I followed the recipe and my “dough” was just crumbly. I couldn’t even make a ball with it. It is way too dry and I’m not sure what to add to fix it.

Very dry cookies.  Soft, but so very, very dry.  I think 5.5 cups of flour is too much.  Tried rolling them into balls and rolling them in flour and then flattening them just slightly with the bottom of a glass (but they don’t flatten much when baked) like another reviewer suggested and that definitely improved their taste and dryness.  These cookies need more moisture and to be sweeter.  With some icing maybe they’ll be ok.  Definitely hold their shape:  great for cookie cutters.

I halved the recipe but cut down on flour and added a little more sugar and ginger, and I also didn't roll out the dough, just dropped spoonfuls onto the parchment-lined tray. They turned out really well!

Yes, I made this recipe.  Admittedly, the dough was sticky, but I continued to work with it in small batches.  It worked out perfect!!  I will make them again.
