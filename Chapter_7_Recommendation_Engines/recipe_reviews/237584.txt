I found this recipe a bit bland but holding promise.   I will try it again, adding some pepper and additional spices.

With all the spices involved I was surprised I was not impressed.  It won't be staying in my recipe box.

Loved it!  I don't like peas in my recipe, but this worked very well with the peas!

I found this recipe to be very flavorful and hearty.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for using canned coconut milk instead of Silk.  I will definitely make this again.

Loved the idea of cooking quinoa in coconutmilk as an alternative for the broth I usually use and it really gave it a different flavor and a more creamy texture.  We loved the flavor of the cauliflower roasted with the garam masala, but thought it was a bit heavy with dry spices.  I try to make at least one vegetarian meal each week and this will certainly be added to the rotation.

I made 1 1/2 cup of quinoa. When it was done cooking I mixed 1/2 a cup of coconut milk(unsweetened) and added more curry powder to the milk. Mixed until there were no more chunks of curry and when it was ready to serve I added the rest of the mixture to the quinoa. It was delicious! And it made it creamy ?? Will definitely be making this again. Oh! And the roasted cauliflower was amazing!

Good but definitely not my favorite. Father inlaw and husband didn't feel great about it.

I love the creaminess of the coconut mk in this recipe. It's a great vegan make-ahead lunch option!

This was pretty good. I added white beans plus the peas to the quinoa at the end of cooking to make it heartier for dinner. I used Almond-Coconut milk since that's what I had. Not overwhelmingly coconut-y that way. The cauliflower on top was really delish. I roasted it in a mix of both coconut oil & olive oil in addition to the spices. I wanted to give it a little bit richer flavor.
