I have been making these since I was a kid.  The only difference is that I use 1/3 a cup sugar.  Yummy!!

This was okay the first time, but the 2nd time I made it I added 1 t. powdered egg white, and it was much better, a lot thicker and creamer.

Good, but a little sweet. Next time I'll cut the sugar in half.

This recipe was teriffic -- but I did make a few changes.  I substituted the orange juice concentrate and the water for prepared orange juice in the carton.  I also subbed half and half for the milk and powdered sugar for the sugar.  I made it really rich and creamy.

This stuff is terrific!! However, half a cup of sugar makes it a little too sweet (for my taste), so I never use quite that much.

I used the rest of the fat free evaporated milk I had this morning to make this drink. I did not add the extra sugar. Instead of ice, I used two frozen bananas. My husband is a Orange Julius fan and he loved this smoothie. Using the evaporated milk made this really rich and creamy. We loved this. Next time, I'll know to make double for seconds.

This recipe is a family favorite.  The colder the ingredients are, the better.  I used 1% milk and 1/3 cup sugar, have also substituted 4 T fructose for the sugar.  Instead of 12 ice cubes I use 10.  Turns out frothy, cold and refreshing.

This recipe has an EXCELLENT flavor.  I used Mexican Vanilla instead of regular vanilla, which really enhanced the flavor even more.

Added a splash of heavy cream for richness and a little less sugar.  Served the kids then added Mango Malibu for the adults. (Put the extra in popsicle holders, froze them and made icy cocktails the next night too!!)  Keeper!

I Really enjoy this recipe.  We normally call it "orange julius".  It has just the right amount of sweetness, ice, and flavor.

It's like going to the mall without leaving your home!  We only have skim milk in the house, so we doubled the amount of milk and didn't add any water.  Yum!

This is my favorite treat!  I found this recipe a while back and now it's the only one I use!  You can dress it up any way you want, we sometimes throw in some bananas or strawberries, but the recipe is perfect just the way it is.

My kids really love this. (I do too!)
The only thing I do different is instead of 1/2 cup white sugar, I use 1/4 white and 1/4 powdered sugar. I think it tastes more like an Orange Julius this way.

I have my own version of this I have been making for several years using vanilla yogurt and almond milk as a base. I wanted to try some of the other recipes and found this recipe to be great too - just not quite as "healthy" as mine. I would never buy another similar smoothie from a mall when it is so easy to make at home. For those looking at this recipe, yes it is very sweet and very orangey, but delicious!

I read all the reviews that talked about using less sugar but I wanted to try the recipe as written. It did turn out to be super sweet, but it was still really good. My husband thought it was perfect though, so I would suggest that the amount of sugar used should be to your personal preference. Next time I will only use 1/4 cup.

This was good, but doesn't taste anything like an Orange Julius.  Maybe it's because there's too much sugar as other reviewers pointed out - I feel like the vanilla tastes a bit off, too.  I don't think I'll make this one again, but it wasn't horrible.

A lot of the comments say this is too sweet.  I have used this recipe for years and we love it.  I use two cups of water instead of one though. I'm sure that would cut back on the sweetness.

Made this for a quick "pick me up" this afternoon. I didn't feel like going to the grocery store (even though it's only five minutes away!), so I was searching here on Allrecipes for something that I could make with ingredients I had on hand. I wish I would have followed ADH's directions exactly. Instead, I reduced the amount of sugar called for to 1/3 c. as many others did. I actually think a full 1/2 c. of sugar is right on (and I never had the "mall" drink - just my personal opinion...). Oh, and I used half granulated / half powdered sugar, but would choose one or the other next time. Overall, this was good and satisfied my mid-day craving, but I'm not sure I'd make it again. Thanks anyways :)

Loved it! Tasted like an orange dreamsicle. However I changed a couple things. I didn't have frozen orange juice but I had orange, pineapple, Apple juice and instead of sugar I used Splenda. It still turned out delicious a creamy. I'm all about just using what u have in your house and improvising.

This recipe is VERY good. I made two servings intending to give the other to someone else, but I ended up drinking both because it was so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and I thought it was great.

Too sweet, I would definitely cut the sugar in half, and may even swap it out for honey or agave.  I would add a few more ice cubes (to be chopped into the drink.   The orange/milk sure adds a lovely creamsicle flavour that is just lovely.

Didn't really like but it tasted a little bit better if you add a scoop or two of ice cream.

What a nostalgic drink!  I can remember back in the day when these were made with raw eggs.  I simplify this recipe by using  1-3/4 c. orange juice instead of frozen concentrate and water.  I’m sure the frozen concentrate gives it more orange flavor, but it’s fine with the juice and much easier.

Very good.  But next time I think I will cut back a little on the sugar as others have suggested.  And maybe try it with 1/2 and 1/2 sometime as a special treat--although that kind of defeats the healthiness of this snack!

Yummy and sweet. I did not add any sugar. I substituted fruit juice instead of water (1 cup of orange mango juice). I'm sure any citrus based juice would taste good. My kids loved it. The called it cream sickle in a glass.

I think this was pretty good. I followed another's advice and used 1/3 cup sugar and skim milk. I had to rate it 5 stars because my two children sat still and quiet for about 15 minutes devouring this "OJ milkshake" and if that isn't Glorious...than I don't know what is!

That was very good.  It reminded me of that famous "orange drink" we always wanted when we went to the mall years ago!  My own change was 1 additional tablespoon of the orange concentrate and instead of milk I used half -n-half.  Loved it enough will make again in the summer time!

I Love this recipe and so does my family. It is cool and refreshing. Sometimes I use plain kefir instead of milk and it gives it a great tang. Occasionally I will use powdered egg whites to help froth it up.

Followed as is and find it a tad too sweet. Maybe because I used the Minute Maid Orange Punch which is on the sweeter side. Next time, I'll leave out the sugar first then add little at a time.

I do not like many fruits, and I generally do not care for orange juice. However, I like orange flavored things, so I decided to give this a shot. Much to my surprise it was delicious! I cut it down to only one serving, and the only ingredient I changed was the 2 Tbsp sugar recommended to only 1 Tbsp raw agave nectar. Perfectly sweet and gave me a bit of energy afterwards. It blended perfectly and was very easy to make. A++ recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I followed the directions completely and in the end it was the consistency of milk and tasted like straight up orange concentrate.  Don't waste your time, my mom and I didn't finish our glasses.

This recipe has great potential, as it is, it's a little too sweet for my taste. This recipe is also lacking as a full body drink, yet all that being said ths recipe is worth working with.  Thanks
