We enjoyed this corn bread tremendously, it was simple to make (I also used Jiffy mix) and we couldn't stop eating it.  I think this should be a new staple in our home.  It was the right amount of sugar, chilis and corn.  Yum!

I made this to go along with chili.  My sister raved about it, but I couldn't get past the chewiness of the corn. Maybe next time I'll try canned corn or creamed instead.

This was very simple. I chose to make mini muffins out of this recipe instead of baking it in the cake pan. I greased the muffin cups with butter before dropping the batter into them. This was tasty--using the whole can of mild green chilies helped the batter to be moist when normally, it would not have been. (I don't know about you but I always have issues with boxed corn bread, it almost always comes out dry!) Next time I make this, I might throw in some shredded monterey jack cheese.

Awesome and very moist.  I used cream corn instead of frozen and it came out great.

A really nice twist on regular old corn bread! I served this with a really spicy chili and it was great.

This was very good. It turned out a very dense thick slice. This is not suitable for splitting into top and bottom. I only had a half can of mild green chiles and forgot to thaw the corn first. I baked this in a Pyrex deep dish pie pan for 19 minutes. I got a thumbs up here on this recipe!

It was good, I would probably add more chilis next time.  I expected the taste of the chilis and pieces of it in every bite but it wasn't like that....maybe i'll add some jalape√±os to make it spicier and it'll really be chili corn bread!

Yum yum!! I used fresh roasted green chilis which really makes a difference. Being from the south I enjoy a nice sweet corn bread and this hit the spot with our beloved Pueblo chilis combined to complete the mix. I did use canned corn. FYI I made these in my (only used a couple of times, heavy duty, non stick) scone pan and had issues with them sticking. I believe its due to the chilis and corn so be sure and spray or grease your pan  and enjoy, we sure did =))

Delicious, I made them last weekend for my Cinco De Mayo party and they were a hit.  As suggested I used cream corn.

I tried these using a 15 oz package of corn bread as that was all I had, so my amounts were a little off, but the corn bread was still very good!  A little sweeter than I expected (and I omitted the sugar), but that could be due to the mix that I had.  Overall, very good to go along with soup -- I paired it with the Stuffed Pepper Soup.  Yum!

Good but not great.  I added cheese but didn't have an egg - which could have made the difference.  I'll try again and include the egg.
