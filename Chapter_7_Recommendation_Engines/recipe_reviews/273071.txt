I made this as written but haven't used it as pizza crust yet. It was good hot out of the oven (I used the toaster oven) and the next day, I fried a round up in some butter...toasts up nicely.  The yeast gives it that bread flavor that is lacking in other keto bread recipes and even smelled like fresh baked bread while baking.  The dough is a bit sticky when kneading, but a little oil on the hands solved that problem.  Will make again.
