Cloud Bread Haiku: "Just three items, wow! But wouldn't mind a few more, just for extra taste." This is the internet's recipe darling right now so I had to try it out (reminded me of the "surprise!!" amazement at making 2 ingredient banana ice cream) and I wasn't disappointed. I mean, surprise! Round, light-as-air fluffy golden "breads!" I guess I beat my whites too long b/c mine weren't poofy, but they had enough heft to hold pieces of frittata dinner. I'm looking forward to toasting and tasting its texture in the morning, along w/ making again w/ some spice or herb additions.

I need bread in my life! I'm low carbin' it and thought I'd give this a shot.  I read the reviews and decided to add 1/2 t minced garlic and a little Italian seasoning for flavor.  You can definitely taste the egg in it, but I like eggs ;) It was so nice to have with a bowl of broccoli cheese soup! I can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow when they're suppose to be even more bread-like.  I will make many variations of this for many meals in the future.  Sandwiches are back!!!

So, I have mixed reviews. I made it as advertised. It was good. Now, consider that you might be stranded on a desert island with only cream cheese and egg and happen to run into some baking powder. In that case, it is truly orgasmic food. That said, if you consider that there are other ways to satiate your protein fetish, it is just good. You do need to try it though so you can talk about it over a high carb meal at a fancy overpriced restaurant. I'm not sure I'd make it again, but if I did and if I followed the recipe, it ought to come out perfect.

Best non-bread bread I've had.  Made with no alterations.  Simple to make with ingredients I usually have on hand at any given time.  

I will be experimenting: flavored cream cheese, or making sweet with sugar, or savory with  garlic power, etc...  Thanks for sharing.

I accidentally stumbled upon this recipe and boy am I glad.  It was so easy to make and came out great. Made it yesterday and it tasted good today it tasted even better.  I read the reviews and beat the eggs to stiff peaks , omitted the sugar and left in the fridge overnight in ziploc. It's a great recipe for low carb diet.

Easiest recipe in the world!!  I make it every day.  I'm on a low carb diet I add seeds, garlic, sometimes cinnamon and a sprinkle of sugar (when I want to cheat).  DELICIOUS.

These are easy to make & pretty neutral in flavor so you can use them with either sweet or savory toppings.  I made 8, but will make 6 next time as with 8 they are pretty small.  I want to be able to use them for bread for a sandwich or burger or as a piece of "toast" for breakfast.  They are light & airy & not filling at all.

I liked that it was light but other than that, don't think I will go out of my way to make it again.
Will have to do some tweaking with this one!

Well, it turned out just like the photos, and definitely easy enough  -  but just know, you REALLLY need like the taste of eggs.  I’m good with eggs mixed into stuff (i.e. fried rice, breakfast casseroles and such) - but for me (& again this is just me!) - the egg taste was way too overwhelming.

Came out very eggy tasting. It’s very light though. I think I didn’t mix it all together enough. I was scared of knocking too much air out of it. Definitely needs either a little sugar or some strong seasoning. I dipped them in syrup and they tasted ok.

Did not turn out like bread at all!! Looked and tasted exactly like eggs. Delicious and fluffy eggs...but not cloud bread! My mixture turned out way to liquidy before I put it in to the oven...guess that should've been a sign.

I really liked this a lot. I'm going zero carbs and am desperate for bread. This really works for me. I will double the recipe next time. I also really want to experiment with seasonings to make different versions.

I made this recipe and my husband enjoyed it. I have tried several different recipes, and liked this one best.  I want to add some flavor next time I make it, possibly with herbs and or even add some cinnamon and a few raisins before it goes in the oven. I will make a bunch if I know it freezes well.  My husband puts it in the toaster to firm it up a bit, he'll toast anything :-) Thanks in advance!

First time had to cook longer.  Second time I heated pan first and made in one large bun.  Made sandwich and cut in quarters.  Loved it!  Making a double batch now to get a loaf shape (I hope).  Oh and since I am out of cream cheese I'm trying cottage cheese like Adkins recipe used years ago.  I plan to make this often.

I think think this is a great substitute for bread for those of us on low carb diets. Yes, it tastes eggy, but that’s really okay with me. I am going to add some Italian herbs to it next time and make a “pizza” with it. I think it will turn out nice. Thanks for the recipe. It is easy to do and I feel like I will make it again many times and now don’t even need a recipe. So easy. And good.

The recipe is great, although, I'm not a fan of the eggy taste. It was like eating a silky finger omelet. I definitely would eat it as a breakfast sandwich w sausage or bacon but it's not an everyday ham sandwich type recipe for me. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe, it's delicious!

Awesome bread substitute for low carb diet!  SB P1 friendly!  Easier to make than it sounds.  Topped it with garlic butter and mozzarella from the WW recipe.  Would be good for breakfast with a smidge of fruit spread.  Try it!

I followed the instructions exactly and I just wasn't impressed. The cloud bread mix was runny, and although the rounds baked up alright they tasted like eggs (because the cloud bread is basically all eggs). Not fluffy and light! They looked... sad.  They didn't look ANYTHING like the photos provided, and only browned around the edges. They might have tasted better with some herbs and spices, and maybe more baking powder?? I'm not sure. I'll try making them again but I'm not very optimistic they will turn out any better.

I am not GF or diet-restricted, but the photo looked so appetizing I just had to try it.  I really like this Cloud Bread.  It is not heavy, doesn't sit in your guy like a rock.  It makes a very satisfactory BLT.  I have also made it for church, to be served to the GF folks when I have refreshments and am making strawberry shortcake.  They are always delighted to be able to enjoy the dessert just like the non-GF people.  I do add 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the recipe, and it tastes perfect.

used melody ikards additions and this was so good. tried other cloud bread recipes but think this is the best with the addition of fresh garlic and Italian seasonings.

Paleo and or Keto this recipe rocks, the grand kids love them as snacks. They can be used to wrap a hotdog, make a turkey and cheese sandwich and even make a breakfast sandwich. Whether your on a low carb diet or just want to change it up a bit this recipe works!

They're so easy to bake and so low calorie!! I could not taste it at all, probably because I had a lot of stuff put onto it lmao; but the good thing is, it's stable and can hold food without crumbling apart! As long as the bread doesn't fall apart, I'm good!

First time making these. They were perfect. So excited about being able to cut carbs but still have an occasional sandwich with these lovely little cloud breads. Thank you for the great and very simple recipe.

I did like this but I am exploring other low carb bread options.  This is good though if you are looking for a low carb bread.  It is not dense like bread but it toasts pretty good and has good flavor.

I added some garlic powder and Italian seasoning. turned out great. Love this very versatile recipe. As with the other reviews I read you can use these three ingredients and make your own creation. Mix it up and have some fun with it.

I made it per instructions. Delicious, light flavor. I also tried a different recipe for a loaf but that one had a heavy egg flavor. Your recipe didn't. It was perfect. The recipe was just enough to make two large buns, perfect for a sandwich. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it! It only took 20 minutes to bake and I left out the sugar. I was able to slice them and put butter inside. Sprinkled a little garlic salt before baking. So yum!!!

GF-Free and dairy free if you use dairy-free tofutti instead! While I'm the only GF in the family, everyone liked it! No problems at all - really yummy when warm spread with jelly.

Can't say I liked it much. Perhaps as a dessert but on its own it's pretty bland with a weird texture. The flavor reminded me of egg custard.
