For those of you who think this is watery, I can tell you what you are doing wrong. You are overbaking the custard. it should still be quite jiggly when you remove from oven. Overbaking tightens the protiens and forces out the liquid making the custed watery.

Yum!  Just like I remember.  My mom used to make baked custard when I was growing up.  My husband is not a fan of custard, and when I came across this recipe I thought "perfect!".  Just two portions, using things I have on hand, and took about 3 minutes to mix up and put in the oven.  Had one portion tonight (ate it slightly warm!), and the other one is in the fridge waiting for me for tomorrow!
This recipe is a great find!

Just enough custard for my craving, but not so much I have to eat it for days.  Tastes great, just like plain custard. Very simple and fast to make.

My mom used to make this when she was alive...I would never make it for myself because her recipe made to much, so that meant I would do without it.  I tried this recipe last night and it tasted just like my moms. It made me feel so good.  Thank you

This was pretty good- I've never made baked custard before.  I used 1% milk and didn't have two small custard cups, so I used one large one.  Because of this, I had to extend the baking time for 15 minutes, and because of that, the top dried out.  But the stuff under that was still good.  I cut down on the sugar a little.  Tasted a little like eggnog!

I made this last night. I doubled the quantities, replaced half the milk with sour cream and yogurt, and used artificial sweetener instead of sugar. It was nice, though slightly grainy. Will make it again because it was so easy to make.

To Little Pixie: Why do you give only three stars when you didn't make the recipe as it was given? I sometimes change recipes to what I have on hand or because I don't like an ingredient. When I do I would not reveiw. This is a very good custard.

The comments about the custard being "watery" made me decide to try omitting a few tablespoons of milk.  The texture was just right and I thought it was delicious.

I had never had baked custard before, but it was something my English husband grew up with, so I decided to give it a try. It couldn't have been easier to make, but after 45 minutes of cooking it was still quite liquid. I decided to take it out of the oven and refrigerate it, and in a few hours it had set nicely. Being new to custard I wasn't sure what to make of it, but my husband assured me that it looked and tasted just right.

Incredibly simple and satisfyingly delicious. Followed recipe exactly (with the exception of the nutmeg--not a fan) and it turned out perfect. It's very liquidy-looking after 35 minutes in the oven, but based on other reviews here I took it out at the appointed time. Even after some time in the fridge it still seemed quite jiggly, but it was actually just perfect, with no excess liquid. We are brand-new empty nesters and custard for two is just perfect for us.

I followed this recipe exactly (although cooking time needed to be extended about 15 minutes) and found that it was pretty watery.  I usually enjoy custard but this one didn't fit the bill.  I also wish it were sweeter, but that's just personal preference.  The Hubster didn't like his at all due to the wateriness of it.  Thanks for sharing the recipe though!

This is a completely wonderful custard.  Just right for an after dinner dessert that is easily doubled or tripled.  Yumm!

I followed this recipe EXACTLY as I had never made custard before.  My custards came out runny and tasted like bacon (the could be bc of the custard cups, not sure about that) and I cooked them for almost an hour! The only thing I could think of is that I used skim milk, but the recipe didn't specify what type of milk. I also had too much water in the pan, but dumped some out when I realized my mistake and cooked the cups for an additional 30 minutes. I threw mine away. My boyfriend said his was good BECAUSE it tasted like bacon, so who knows...

Basic baked custard recipe for two came out perfectly baked 45 min in my Breville smart oven. I'm always looking for recipes that fit a small oven. 
I used fat-free lactose free milk but if you like a richer custard use whole milk. As other reviewers have said overbaking damages the custard so experiment & adjust your baking time accordingly.

I followed the recipe with the exception of putting nutmeg in the egg mixture.  I just sprinkled it on top. 
I've made it three times now so, obviously, I really like it!

The custard is super easy and tastes wonderful.  One correction.  Ms. Wilson is from Roswell, NM not Rosewell, NM.  There is not a town named Rosewell in New Mexico.

I've made many different custard recipes, quite frequently too. This one however fell very short. I had to double the baking time and it still didn't finish cooking (Many people also noted they had to cook for over an hour). It's also horribly watery, and unlike the claims of a recent reviewers claim, it isn't because it was overcooked, unless it overcooked after the first 15 minutes being in the oven, which is funny because after an hour, it's still not cooked.  I had my oven set to 350, followed the very simple instructions, and used good quality custard cups.

Worked with egg whites and fat free milk! I used 2 egg whites in place of the regular egg, used 2 T Splenda Baking blend. Turned out amazing! I even added some sugar on one and carmelized the top for a creme brulee. I'll be making this one weekly. For WW ladies, my version is 2.5 points for 1.

I've never made custard before so maybe I did something wrong but this didn't end up the way I was hoping for. However, I did double the recipe and used a large foil round pan since I didn't have custard cups. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It came out a little too watery (there was liquid at the bottom, and I had also baked for a bit more than an hour), and I found the top (which was more congealed) to be much sweeter than the bottom.

Tried baking a custard for the first time. Followed the recipe to the T and it came out wonderful!  Just the right sweetness for my taste too. Had to bake for 40 minutes but it was excellent. Jiggly when it came out and yummy! Thank you for this easy and fabulous recipe!

This was awesome and turned out perfectly.  We recently made custard in my food science class and the wateriness that some people have reported is indeed due to over cooking the eggs.  It is called "seneresis".  When the custard is done it will still be jiggly and won't be browned on top.  A small amount of egg will still stick to your knife, but the knife will not be coated in egg.  All that said, mine did take about 50 minutes to cook.  These things do vary.  A tip to reduce baking time is to heat the milk in the microwave for about two minutes before mixing together all of the ingredients.  If you do this, be sure to temper your eggs by adding a small amount of the hot milk to the eggs before mixing it all in.  Otherwise you'll end up with scrambled eggs.

A delicious, warm, comforting, and so easy! I used one 16oz ramekin since it was all I had. Maybe because of this, I had to bake it for over an hour to get the desired consistency, and by then it had developed a sort of yellow skin on the top and had browned around the edges. I like my custard with a little more firmness however, so I might cut down on the amount of milk next time. It was also not as sweet as I would have liked it. Delicious as is however.

I've never made custard before, so I followed recipe exactly.  When I took them out of the oven, they were way too soupy.  I baked them for another 20 minutes.  Afterwards, the top layer was the consistency I was hoping for, the middle was just congealed, and the bottom was watery.  Maybe I'll use an extra egg or less milk next time.  The flavor was very good though.

It was watery and didn't have that custard taste that I was looking for. Instead of doctoring up this recipe and hoping it works, I will be looking for another custard recipe.

This one did not go well. The flavor was great. after 35 minutes the custard was pure liquid, except for the very top. I extended the time to an hour and five minutes, and it was a little bit thicker. The top was starting to get browned though, so I took them out. I put them in the fridge for a few hours, (one for all day) and they had set into a little pudding. I give this three stars because the taste was excellent, and the pudding texture was great. But as written, something is not right here.  Also, I found it very hard to take in and out of the oven. the water had heated beyond boiling, and soaked into my oven mitts. If anyone has a safe way to get these things out of the oven, please let me know.

I made it as directed, and have also made it with less sugar.  This is such yummy comfort food-- mine are NOT pretty but either hot from the oven or chilled the next day, it is heavenly.  Makes you feel like a little kid.
