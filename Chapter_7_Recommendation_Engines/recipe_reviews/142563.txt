My boyfriend have actually made this recipe in a pressure cooker.  I was a little hesitant at first but it was AWESOME!!!  This is definitely a new favorite of ours.

This was a pretty good recipe. I didn't have any red hots on hand, but I added extra cinnamon, and it was enough for a compliment from my husband.
