Important information missing! How much olive oil? Not in the ingredient list, nor  in the recipe! What do I do with the bacon and drippings? Leave in the skillet to burn with the shrimp? Add it sometime later? I played it by ear and got it done. Used sun-dried tomatoes, which added some nice tasty oil to th emix. It was a very pretty dish and just what I had hoped for, just frustrated by pieces missing in the posted recipe.

Instead of tomatoe sauce I used a light white sauce.  It was fantastic!  Great recipe; everyone loved it.

Great recipe! If you want to "skinny" it down, it's very good without the bacon (just use olive oil to cook the onion/garlic).

Excellent recipe. I did take a little creative license in adding fresh diced tomatoes in addition to the canned, also added some fresh sliced mushrooms and sliced black olives. The recipe as is, is excellent and I love that it leaves room for inspiration while cooking (yes, I taste as I go along and rarely stick "exactly" to any recipe). Thank you for the great dish.

Excellent! The only change I made was that I used cheese stuffed tortellini instead of plain pasta, but I know it would be great either way.

Just okay.  Didn't use the Italian seasoning at all, as is my preference.  However you tweak this, as you are bound to do, by all means don't cook the shrimp for ten minutes.  A few minutes, until pink and opaque, is what you're after.

I made this as described, and added a dash of cayenne pepper and some red pepper flakes to give it a kick. I also used the leftover shrimp I grilled last night... just let it heat through so it wouldn't dry out. My husband loved it.

Excellent recipe!  Beautiful, simple, smells great when family is coming home for dinner.  Even my vegetable-phobic 10 year old ate without one complaint, and that's really a compliment!

I liked it. It was easy to prepare. I added a few dashes of crushed red pepper to give it a little bit more flavor.

This is very good! I didn't have bacon, so I used salami. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Didn't add the tomato paste. Rave review from the wife. Leftovers held up well a couple days after.

I only gave this 3 stars because I made changes.  Except for substituting a jar of homemade marinara (and leaving out the tomato paste), I followed the recipe and found it to be a bit boring soI added a touch of half-n-half, about 2 Tbsps. of cambozola cheese and some parmesan. It's a great base though and we enjoyed it very much with the additions.  thanks!

We loved this recipe!  I added black olives, as another reviewer suggested, and that was my husband's favorite part.  I loved the fresh spinach.  I would never have thought of adding that to a sauce.  Thank you for a great recipe.

used frozen spinach, which I microwave defrosted, reserved the crisp bacon slices to crumble over the top of the casserole, and used precooked pink Oregon shrimpmeat, added in the last couple of minutes just enough to warm them up.

I used a good brand of diced tomatoes, not a store brand, and they were more randomly chunked, not like some store brand diced tomatoes which are little hard uniform chunks.

I will definitely make this again, and use the larger, jumbo shrimp.  I don't have Italian seasoning, used dried Basil and dried Oregono, generous with the Basil.

The bacon/olive oil combo is what makes this dish.

This was REALLY good! All the flavors mix together quite nicely.. I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes instead of regular and it turned out amazing. I will definitely make this again.

Made this today for our Othodox Christmas dinner.  I had a little over a pound of medium shrimp and used homemade stewed tomatoes.  We all loved the fresh spinach in this, it added just the right touch. It made a wonderful meal and there were no leftovers.  Thanks for posting an easy, tasty option for our special day,  Zaceks

My husband wasn't a fan of this.  I thought it was alright.  I did not use the bacon, added a couple pats of butter and used olive oil.  I used a bit more of all the veggies and a bit less shrimp.  I also added a few pine nuts.  For the most part made it true to the recipe.  Maybe it would be better with the bacon.

I used 1/2 the amount of Italian seasoning and it still seemed to overpower the shrimp. It was ok, but I won't make it again.
