SOOO Good !  Had trouble spreading the sticky dough. My husband gave a really good tip: spread and shape the dough between 2 sheets of wax paper. Use the wax paper to transfer the dough into baking dish, peel off the wax paper.

This coffee cake is absolutely delicious!  I did however; change one ingredient.  Instead of using 2 packages of cream cheese, I substituted one package of the equal amt. of ricotta cheese.  A little lighter than 2 packages of cream cheese.  Definitely a keeper!!

Not only was this easy to make it tastes wonderful! I appreciate the simple and uncomplicated tastes of this coffee cake. The cream cheese filling is what this cake is all about. Not too sweet but satisfying and perfect with a cup of coffee. I made half the recipe in a round deep dish pie pan and cooked for almost 40 minutes. I wish though I had taken it out 5 minutes sooner because my sides and bottom were just a smidge too done. The toothpick test for this cake is "ify" because the filling is wet and if you cook it till the toothpick comes out clean in my opinion that is just a little too long. Next time I will take it out when I feel the top set in the center, the filling should still set up fine because the heat of the cake will continue to cook it. The dough is very sticky and I found if I layed the dough in blobs and then pushed the blobs into place and into each other that worked best. Hubby gave it 5 stars too! I did add more nuts just because I like them.

Perfection!!! One of the few recipes that make me wish there were more stars to pass out. Incredible not-too-sweet coffee cake! Only made a minor change: a bit more sugar and a splash of vanilla in the cream cheese layer. It is an extremely sticky dough, so wet hands help a lot when spreading it out. I think it's best room temperature. I found that if this is stored in a tightly covered container it gets more moist as it sits making it even better the next day! Thanks so much! (I noticed one reviewer said the butter made it too salty-I was taught to always use unsalted butter when baking...this allows the cook to be in control of the saltiness of the end product.)

This coffee cake is moist and delicious.  It tastes amazing fresh out of the oven or chilled, and even tastes good the next day.  I cut the recipe down to 1/3 and baked it in a glass bread pan because I was only cooking breakfast for two and it worked out great.  I will be making this for a crowd Christmas morning.  Thank you for posting!

For Recipe Group 2/23/13 - This is one of the best cakes I've ever made. I don't bake often but when I do, I try to do it from scratch. I've had some epic failures but not with this coffee cake. The only sub was I used almonds instead of pecans. This cake baked up so fluffy and moist, which baffles me because of how sticky and flat it looked in the pan. And the stickiness would be my only complaint. It was hard to work the first layer of batter into the bottom of the pan. So, I knew there was no way I could spoon drop method top layer of batter. Luckily, I read that one of the other reviewer's hubby suggested using wax paper. I did and it worked, for the most part. Next time, I'll spray a little cooking spray on the paper first, so it can peel off easier. Definitely a keeper.

Made this for Recipe Group...DELICIOUS! Made this exactly as written, and it turned out wonderfully. The 'hardest' part was spreading the dough into the bottom of the pan, but that was easily helped along w/ my hand and some cooking spray. Very simple to make, and I liked the fact that it's not overly sweet, just right! This makes a nice, big cake, so it's enough to feed a crowd. This would even be great w/ some fruit preserves added to the middle as well (not that it needs it b/c it doesn't). A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This coffee cake was wonderful. I was concerned at first because the batter almost seems like a thick sugar cookie dough, but it bakes like a cake. I thought the calories were crazy high at 575 a serving. I used reduced fat cream cheese, cut the recipe in half, and baked it in my square 8x8 Fat Daddio pan. I greased the pan with PAM, wiped out the excess, and had absolutely no sticking. After it cooled, I cut the cakes into 16 servings about 2x2 inch square easily with a plastic knife. Recalculated with the reduced recipe, and serving cuts, it came to 187 calories per serving. It was plenty enough and great with coffee. Due to having less batter, I just did all of the cake mixture as 1 layer followed by the cream cheese mixture and then the topping which I did sub walnuts in as my only real change for the pecans.

Made for Recipe Group. We love cream cheese danish, this fits the bill nicely. Moist and crunchy! I patted the bottom layer out with wet fingers, spread the cheese layer over, and put the second batter part between wax paper and patted it out then laid over the top. Worked great with a little help from some wet hands to get it off the paper. Baked up nicely. Had it warm and cold. I liked it both ways. Thanks for the recipe!

Love Love Love this recipe....only adjustment I made was adding some fresh raspberries on top of the cream cheese layer. I just placed them about an inch or so apart and sprinkled just a pinch of sugar on each because some reviews had mentioned that this coffee cake was not very sweet. Just as you were enjoying a delicious bite of cake...pow..a wonderful bite of berry. This one is a keeper. Thought I might try blueberries this week as they are in season now.

Made this for Recipe Group - and, though I know I shouldn't, I tweaked it all over the place, in an attempt to "healthy-it-up" (= In the dough, I used 1/4 c butter, and 1/4 c coconut oil. I used 1/2 c sugar, and 1/4 c agave. I used 1 c non fat Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. And I used 1 c all purpose flour and 2 c WW. In the filling, I used 8 oz Neufchatel cheese, and 1 c drained non fat Greek yogurt, and 1/4 c agave. In the topping, I split the 1/3 c flour, 1/2 and 1/2 all purpose and WW. This was good, and my co-workers gave me a favorable response, but I felt like I wanted it sweeter. I think next time, I will split the flour in the dough 1/2 and 1/2 - or use white whole wheat [the store did not have it )=]. And I will probably use an equal amount of agave, instead of cutting it back. [When I googled it, it said to use 1/2 - 2/3 the amount of agave that you would use sugar.] I also would just use all coconut oil in the dough, and maybe add some apple sauce . . . It was good this morning with my cup of tea (=

Made for Recipe Group 2/22/13. Warm or cold this is wonderful. I split my batter into 2 8" cake pans. One I made as recipe states and one I added blueberries on top of cream cheese filling. Both fantastic. Yes the batter was thick but with a butter knife it spread no problem for bottom layer. I use WW Flour. Perhaps 35 min. would have been better. Topping stayed on nicely which is important to me.

This is a really delicious and moist coffee cake, but I was a little disappointed because the filling wasn't as soft and creamy as I thought it would be.  I was hoping for something more like the Entenmann's cheese filled coffee cake.  This filling is very dense and set.  The big problem I had, like others, was getting that very sticky dough on the top (I used wet fingers to press and spread out the bottom layer, as suggested by others here).  None the less, my family and I are enjoying it for breakfast this morning.  Thank you SAXYBONE for sharing with us.

I streamlined this one by using the Bisquick streusel coffeecake recipe and adding just the filling.  Delicious!

This is a keeper for me. I placed the cream cheese mixture on top of the batter instead of trying to layer it in between which I found extremely difficult to do and felt it would affect the rise and moistness of the cake by over handling the batter. I then sprinkled the pecan mixture on top, I also toasted the pecans. The cake smells wonderful and rose beautifully in the oven and was very moist. A very simple and delicious recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Recipe Group Selection:  23, February 2013 ~ DELICIOUS! – We were helping friends move and I thought this would be the perfect breakfast snack.  I guessed correctly, everyone loved it.  I baked this in 2 round 8” cake pans rather than a 13 x 9 pan.  By doing this, I made one pan with the pecans and one without.  To help spread the first layer, I sprayed a disposable plastic glove with Pam® and it spread without any problems.  I did not have two pkgs. of cream cheese on hand, so I use one package and 8 oz. of Ricotta cheese and it worked perfect.  I baked this Friday morning and served it Saturday morning and it was nice and moist.  I cannot wait to try this again when I have the 2 pkgs. of cream cheese.  Thanks SAXYBONE for sharing your recipe.

Saw this recipe and had to try it. I'll definitely make again. We have a cow, so I used my own cream cheese (8oz.) and 8 oz homemade ricotta instead so 2 cream cheese. Next time I will add some lemon zest to the cheese mixture. Topping is perfect, exactly 45 min baking time.

Yummy! Followed directions exactly except added a couple shakes of pumpkin pie spice to topping. Having your hands wet really helps with spreading out the batter too. Will definitely make this one again :)

This recipe wasn't as great as I hoped it would be. My bf liked it but I won't make it again... I've made other versions I liked much more.  Thanks anyway. Maybe it just wasn't my cup of tea?

This was the Recipe Group selection for February 23, 2013.  Overall, this is a delicious coffee cake - it is moist, buttery, crunchy yet not all that sweet tasting.  I halved the recipe, lined a 7" x 11" pan with foil and sprayed with baking spray (should have used solid shortening). I had a really tough time getting the sticky first layer of dough to adhere because of the baking spray and wound up using an angled spatula to spread the sticky dough - worked like a charm. Since I had halved the recipe, I was to use 1/2 of an egg in the batter and filling but I used 2 whole eggs.  I also added 1 teaspoon of pure almond extract to the filling.  I baked for about 40 minutes, removed from oven, allowed to cool and lifted the cake out by the foil. The cake sliced and served beautifully.  We liked it better warm. Thanks SAXYBONE for the recipe - it is a keeper.

Fantastic!  Make this recipe as it reads and you'll be the "belle of the ball"!  My family loved it, and I divided one recipe equally between 2 decorative Christmas 8" tins and gave to neighbors - who think I'm a genius.  Highly recommend, very good crumb and cheese flavor.

Just took this out of the oven. Fantastic. Fluffy, moist, creamy and well perfect. I did change the recipe slightly to the ingredients I had on hand. I used mascarpone instead of cream cheese, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and almonds instead of the pecans as we don't have pecans here in Italy. I did also add in addition to the recipe a touch of cinnamon to the topping per my husbands request. Definitely a 5 star recipe and one I will use from now on ! Thank you so much.

Love this coffee cake.  I make it on Saturday and take it to church Sunday morning.  Everyone loves it.  I make one addition.  On top of the cream cheese layer I spread preserves.  I have used cherry, or blueberry or raspberry.  Cherry so far has been the favorite.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was delicious!  I had a hard time "spreading" the sticky dough.  I didn't think it would cover the 9x13 pan so I left room on both sides of the baking dish.  When I spread the cream cheese mixture over the center I thought  wow that's twice as thick as the crust.  Finally, "spreading" the top crust on - well, I just smooched it into flat-ish strips and laid it over the cream cheese center.  To my delight and amazement,  the dough spread and filled in the pan, and covered the top.  The taste - fantastic!

Made it as written and it's excellent. Water dampened fingers will make it easier to spread the first layer of dough.

Tried this recipe for a family reunion brunch and was very very well recieved.  I used the suggestion by other reviewers to spray wax paper and smoosh it into the right size to top the filling.  Worked like a charm.  Delicious!

Great recipe. Instead of sour cream in the cake batter, I substituted tofu sour cream once, and tofu cream cheese with some vinegar and cream once. Both versions were perfect. Been using Neufchatel cheese for the filling. Easy way to reduce the fat while still tasting rich and delicious. Thanks for this "keeper".

Like another review,  I had a battle with trying to smooth the sticky dough out evenly. It was frustrating,  but eventually I sprayed my spatula with a ton of Pam and it did help.  I agree with rolling it out next time in between Suranwrap like a pie crust.  That would save you some aggravation.  This was a delicious. I will probably make it again.

I was looking for a good coffee cake recipe with cream cheese and found this one and it looked perfect.  I will say that it took me nearly an hour to prepare (not the estimated 30 minutes...) mostly because the dough is indeed very sticky and difficult to spread in a greased pan and not easy to spoon over cream cheese layer.  As I was making it I was thinking I may not ever do this again, but then I baked it and oh my!  I think I will definitely be making this again!!  Work?  What work?!! Ha!  I made the recipe just as it is written and wouldn’t change an ingredient.  I did try to use wax paper to spread the bottom layer of dough and it didn’t work for me - the dough stick to it and I had to scrape it off.  I may try to refrigerate it for a few minutes after mixing to see if that makes it more manageable next time.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe - this is definitely a keeper!!

Both the cake and cheese cake part seemed bland. If i make again, I’ll add extract to the cream cheese and cinnamon to the topping.

Amazing !!! My mom told me that I wasn't aloud to make this again  because it was so good. Even my older sister who is a bit of a picky eater loved it. I added a glaze made out of 1 cup of sifted powder sugar, 2 tablespoons of milk, and 2 tablespoons of butter. Also highly recommend following  the first direction it will save you a lot of trouble. It was late so I put all the ingredients for the cake part and mixed. If was very hard to mix it that way.  I'm 1000% making this again (against my mother's wishes.)

On a fluke, I added canned cherry pie filling for my dad.  Unfortunately, my mom and uncle ate it all before he could even taste it.  He passed away, never tasting it, but I know he would have loved it with the cherries.  I never made it without the cherries and I never will...too many people love it!

Hands down the best cake I've had in a long time! I followed the directions closely. I used real vanilla extract and added 1 tsp of banana extract in the filling. Also I'd recommend putting aluminum foil loosely on the top for the first 15 minutes to avoid browning the top too much. My father was Polish and very proud of it. I knew when I saw the title I just had to try it. So glad I did and I know if he were still with us he'd love it too.

Everyone who ate this loved the recipe.  Just make sure your cream cheese and butter are soft.  It makes it a lot easier to work with.  I used the spray on oil to help minimize the sticking of the raw dough.  Also, this cake will not come out with a clean tooth pick because of the cream cheese, so be careful when using that method to determine when it's done.  I would go by the appearance of the top of the cake, a golden brown.

This is a wonderful recipe! I have never made anything resembling a coffee cake before, & appreciated the straightforward, easy instructions. I followed the recipe last night and the family loved it! Today I made another for my neighbors- I increased the cream cheese filling by half and sprinkled a bit of nutmeg on top. Thank you so much for sharing this!!

Very good- and way better to superb the next day!  Could use a bit less sugar in the topping especially, and I used more oil than butter, and about 1/4 of the flour was whole wheat. I really liked this.

I made this for a ladies luncheon and it was a huge success!  I used lite sour cream and 1/2 low fat cream cheese and 1/2 part skim ricotta in an effort to lower the guilt factor.  I was working against time so I put all the cake in the pan and spread it with wet hands then added the cheese and the topping.  I did add a tsp of vanilla to the cheese mixture.  I can see so many variations this will surely be made again.  I suggest serving this either slightly warmed or a room temperature to get the full benefit of the subtle flavors.  Thanks SAXYBONE, this is a keeper!

The streusel on this coffee cake turned out crunchy and nice and fluffy on the inside. I stuck to the recipe and I don't know if it's my oven but I think 5 min less baking time would work - it got a little dry on day 2.

I really like this but I'm thinking it needs some icing drizzled over it. Don't get me wrong but I really like this especially the cream cheese. I tried the wax paper trick putting the dough in the pan but did not work for me so I used butter on my fingers and that worked great. Overall very good.

This coffee cake was mentioned on the Buzz by Lindsay who highly recommended it.  I can understand why she did.  It’s wonderful.  It had been a Recipe Group selection for February 23, 2013. Thanks Lindsay!

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving... and it was DELICIOUS! The cake part was a little too doughy, as some said, but I used a little extra flour to roll it out. The extra didn't really change the cake or anything. I also doubled the topping. I thought it was even better the next morning heated up!

Very good !!!! However ,I made this recipe in a coffee cake pan @ 350 degrees for 40 minutes. I also substituted ricotta cheese for half of the cream cheese. AWESOME!!!

This is a deliciously moist cake recipe! I agree that it is a bit more complicated to make than meets the eye, but it's worth the effort. I think I'd add some cinnamon in this recipe personally, but it's also great just how it is.

I used light sour cream and light cream cheese.  Also used half whole wheat flour and half white in the dough part of the recipe.  Doubled the topping which I would recommend as it was the perfect amount of topping.  We liked this a lot better after it sat in the fridge for a bit.  I didn't have much trouble spreading the dough as others mentioned.  It spread fine in the dish and for the top layer I rolled between 2 pieces of wax paper and placed it over the top of the filling.  It didn't make it to all the corners but it didn't effect the end result.  Will likely make again but would use all white flour as the cake part ended up being pretty dense.  It did bake up fluffier than I would have thought based on how thin it was in the pan.  Overall, we thought it was good but not outstanding.  Would be good if you were looking for something to make the day before.

The topping is the best part to me. Other half loved this, but I didn't care for the texture of the cake.

For the recipe group 2/23/13 - This is a great recipe.   DS#2 came into the kitchen as it was just coming out of the oven.   He could not wait until it cooled as the smell got to him.  Said that the was fanastic and very light.   Rest of the family agreed.

While the recipe worked, the designer of this cake needs a new timer. Even after getting everything prepared to assemble, it still took me over an hour  to put it all together.

Mine came out of oven in 30 mins.  Took advice and sprayed fingers with Pam.  This was a good bit of work to make, imo and if i'm going to make it again, i would add a flavor which i thought it lacked.  Tasted it, then sprinkled cinnamon, sugar on top.  Do NOT cut back on the sugar.  Plop 2nd half of batter over cream cheese layer.  It will turn out fine.

Very thick, sticky dough. More like a biscuit dough than a cake.  IF I make it again I'll either add a little buttermilk or use a different pan.  It's very difficult to spread.  I forgot the flour in the topping so we'll see.  It's not too sweet but it's really time consuming and difficult to assemble.

One of the best recipes I have ever made.  I made it for my Polish neighbors and they asked me for the recipe.  It got rave reviews.  I would add more pecans next time.

This was GREAT!! I added a little extra sugar in the cream cheese mixture and put cherry preserves on  half of it before putting on the second dough layer. Based on another review, I sprayed wax paper with PAM and spread out the second half of dough on that and then transferred to the pan. Worked really well. I have no idea how I would have spread the dough over the cream cheese otherwise. I made a litte extra topping with extra nuts but didn't really need it. Had more than enough to cover the top. I had to bake mine for about 6 extra minutes in order for the middle to be set. I was worried it would be dry around the sides because it looked VERY brown. It wasn't an issue at all tho. Tasted even better the next day.  Make this, this you won't be sorry!

This is my first time making this type of cheese cake. I love Polish cheese cake so I gave this a try with the help of the reviews here. The taste and texture are amazing. The technique of making the dough was new to me. I struggled there a bit as I haven't used this technique before. I struggled in terms of spreading the sticky dough on the filling. I wish I read one the reviewers' reco about spreading them on wax paper first before placing them on the baking pan. I usually don't follow recipes' sugar measurement as I don't enjoy eating desserts with too many sugars. For this recipe, I only used a bit of sugar (cut about 10-15%  of brown and white sugar). I thought it was a good call. I cooked this a bit longer (50 min vs 40 min) that's why it looks a bit dark. My oven acts up here and there so I didn't want to under cook it. I thought the technique of making the dough was interesting. Taste is delicious! I'll make this one again. Highly recommended recipe.

Wonderfully addicting coffee cake! It is a lot of work to make so don't be surprised. Have learned many good ideas and tips to try with this recipe from the COMMENTS section (thanks everyone!). We are awaiting a second by-the-recipe coffee cake to finish baking right now. Definitely recommend!

Let me start off by saying I hate to bake and I am awful at it.  I needed a dessert for a party I was hosting and thought this looked good.  I read all the reviews and was very nervous trying it because everyone was saying how difficult it was because the dough was sticky.  I made this last night.  It was no problem.  Dough was sticky but I wet my fingertips with water as I was spreading it and had no problems.  The only change I made to the recipe is I added a can of cherry pie filling on top of the cream cheese layer.  The cake turned out beautiful and tasted wonderful.  I was pretty darn proud of myself!

This is sinfully good. 
A tip to get the top layer of dough applied: put it in a pastry bag and squeeze out blobs. It doesn’t have to be a solid flat layer.
If you don’t have pastry bags try a heavy duty ziplock bag and snip a corner off. 

This recipe is definitely worth the expensive ingredients and extra effort!

This recipe makes a delicious coffee cake.  The recipe is perfect the way it is.  If you flour your fingers and gently pat the dough in the pan it solves the sticky dough problem mentioned in other reviews.

Made it 3 times so far, with each time i fell in love with this cake more and more. 
1st was with whole wheat flour, 2nd was exactly like the recipe, 3rd i used 1 1/2 brick of cream cheese and a cup of ricotta cheese  instead of the whole amount of cream cheese.
Was soo rich and moist!

Everyone in our family loves this cake. I used all the hints with wax paper, etc and it works well. I added a light glaze after it cooled which gives it a lively appearance. All in all... a keeper!

after 3 hrs. doubling the amount, I will never make this again. In the end I threw  it out. The cheese middle didn't cook long enough. When I took it out of the oven the first time, the cheese wasn't firm, so I returned to the oven for 5 more minutes and the dough was overcooked. The worst cake ever. I used a string pan and when I took the  spring off, it wasn't cooked long enough.

Very good, mild flavor. Subbed ricotta for half of the cream cheese filling and sliced almonds for pecans.
Next time I would add cinnamon to the topping.

It was very good. Had to work with spreading the dough. Definitely use a glass baking dish. Had the texture of a coffee cake.  I will make it again.

I made this for my husband, since he loves anything with cream cheese! We both really liked it, and I'll definitely make it again. Following the suggestions of others - I wet my fingers to spread the first layer of batter (it really wasn't that difficult) and I topped the cream cheese layer with a handful of fresh raspberries from the garden - amazing! I didn't bother trying to spread the second layer of batter, just followed the directions and dropped by big spoonfuls, and it came out just fine; in fact I think it helped give it the look of a typical coffee cake. I baked it for the full 45 minutes, but next time will take it out after 40, it was just on the verge of being too dry.  It dirties up a few bowls to make, but well worth it!

Excellent recipe!  The only change I made was to substitute Splenda for both the white and brown sugars.  Not overly sweet, just right. The sticky dough was manageable in small globs spread with fingertips. My husband couldn’t stop raving over it. He said best cake he ever tasted.

Fantastic recipe! Definitely need to wet hands under tap in order to spread first layer and when dropping third layer since batter is so thick & sticky! Puffed up beautifully. Tasted delicious! Both my husband and I loved it since it wasn't overly sweet! I have saved this and will definitely make again!

I didn't  use pecans due to an allergy. Substituted rolled oats for pecans and added 1  tsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg.
Baked perfectly. Everyone loved it!

This desert is a mix between cheese cake and coffee cake. I added ricotta cheese with cream cheese and topped it with berries sauce so it’s not too dry .  Like what other reviewrs said the dough was kinda hard to work with but it’s all worth it

Will definitely make again! Sticky dough is hard to spread but worth the effort. Tried another reviewers suggestion to use wax paper but did not work so well for me, ended up having to make half the dough again. I doubled the topping ended up soooo good!

Followed recipe as written. It seemed like it was missing something. Sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar over the top of it and it seemed to help. Probably won’t be making again.

I was out of sour cream but used plain Greek yogurt in its place.  I also doubled the filling portion as I know what my mom likes.  I will double the cake dough next time as I couldn’t cover the entire top of the cake after using enough to cover the bottom of my pan.

It was just a bit dry. Next time I will reduce cooking time by a couple of minutes. Overall flavor and texture was great. I substituted walnuts for pecans because it's what I had on hand and it was yummy!

I was a little underwhelmed. This recipe doesn't taste like a conventional coffee cake. It's not sweet which is fine. The dough is extremely sticky. I opted to use an 9x9 due to the stickiness. That created another problem with baking time. It's an OK recipe. Not one I'd choose again.

All of the men who tried this loved it. Me, not so much. It seemed rather bland to me, and I love nuts and cream cheese. I am going to make it again and try adding some cinnamon and other spices to the cake itself to see if it will improve it any. It was easy though.

The flavor was great! Not super sweet, but satisfying.  It was extremely dense and I would recommend rolling it as a dough instead of dropping it from  a spoon. I would definitely make it again!

Having had the advantage of reviewing other reviews on this recipe, I was very hopeful that it would turn out to be a winner. To my disappointment, it needs a few tweaks to get there. I did substitute one of the 8oz packages of cream cheese for ricotta cheese, which I believe added to it’s moistness. I did moisten my hands while spreading the dough, and also used wax paper to transfer and continue spreading in each pan. I also divided the ingredients into two round pans, spreading the pecan mixture on top. Since my teenage daughter does not like nuts, she was at least able to eat from the bottom layer. I had no problem spreading the dough using the above methods. My daughter commented, “it’s moist but dull tasting,” which I happen to agree with her on. If I try the recipe again, I will add about 1 to 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, and increase the vanilla extract to two teaspoons total instead of one. I might also skip the pecans altogether and make more of a grainy topping using more cinnamon. I definitely loved the moist texture. However, since this was a dessert that I brought to a group gathering, I didn’t get a chance to test the moistness of the ale over subsequent days. Jenn G

I didn't change a thing and it was so good I baked it exactly 45 minutes and it came out perfect! The next time I make it I may add a little more vanilla and maybe more pecans! this is a great recipe for a brunch get together Thanks for sharing!

1 25 18 ... Every party needs a pooper.  Hello.   :D 
 Quite underwhelmed - especially with all the good reviews.  As noted by most, thick batter.  Thickkkkk - almost like biscuit dough, but heavier.  With the heaviness, it took a while for the inside  to bake.  When inside was baked, bottom & edges were too browned.  I can't help but think that this recipe should have buttermilk, not sour cream. With buttermilk, the batter wouldn't be so heavy & rise more.   The filling I really wanted to love as I was wanting a cream cheese filling for cupcakes.  It was good, but not good enough; fit the bill, didn't wow.  Topping was fine, too; but nothing to rave about.  I kinda wonder if there was a change in the recipe for my results to be less than five stars.  I'm not new at this cooking thing.  AR doesn't always tell ya when something is changed/adjusted since the recipe was first published.

This is a great coffee cake!  One our favorites!  I love the cream cheese layer and the crumb topping.  I did half the recipe for us, but used the full amount of crumble over the top since we like the extra.  I also added in some cinnamon to the crumble topping, since we wanted a little cinnamon sugar flavor in it.  It would be good with additional cinnamon in the cake as well, to change the flavor up, if wanted for a more cinnamon cream cheese coffee cake.  It would also be good with a little icing drizzle over top.  Love this and I will make it many more times!  Thank you for the recipe!

I add a handful of uncooked Old-fashioned oatmeal to the topping, as well as  a sprinkle of cinnamon.  Sometimes also a dash of cardamom.  You can substitute 1/2 to 1 cup whole wheat flour for the same amount of white flour.  Even my finicky 12-year-old grandson loves this recipe in any form--he says he's a texture person.  I think he likes the cream cheese.  Linda Owens

Took this coffee cake to a potluck and everyone loved it. I also had many requests for the recipe..
I chose to make this cake with low fat  cream cheese and sour ceeam.
You need to know that the batter is more like a sticky dough and to spread it in the pan, you might need to do it with wet or oiled hands or a wet or oiled back of a spoon.

This was a huge hit with my family! I made it to size and it got polished off between the 4 of us in a matter of days. It really was like, bakery good, in terms of appearance and texture- although maybe ever so slightly too bland for my preferences. I might throw in some sweet spices next time to make it a little more punchy! Otherwise, I have had requests to make it again and will certainly keep the recipe on hand. Last note: other reviewers were correct in that it is a very sticky dough. I had good luck with filling a small bowl with water and wetting my hands to smush it down into the baking pan.

Delicious recipe. I added more nuts to the brown sugar topping but otherwise followed the directions precisely. A tip: when spreading the dough, in the first step, use some unflavored cooking spray in your spreading utensils to keep the dough from sticking.

I am watching carbs so I made this using whole wheat flour, using 2 cups for the base, Splenda, and brown sugar Splenda.  To reduce the fat a bit I substituted low-fat sour cream and  1/3 less fat cream cheese.  This came out awesome--still rich but lower in the bad stuff.  I froze it in squares, wrapped individually, and then I defrost in the microwave for a couple of minutes. It's great having warm coffee cake any morning when I want to.  Not all recipes work with these kinds of substitutions but this one did.

YUM! Everyone loved it! First time I followed the recipe exactly, and turned out great. Second time I made a couple substitutions - 1/2 sugar, 1/2 stevia; vanilla yogurt for sour cream; 1 pkg of cream cheese and 1 cup of pumpkin purée (added some cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger to the pumpkin mix)......fantastic pumpkin cream cheese coffee cake :)

Delicious! I was cleaning and left it in a couple of minutes too long - but storing it covered helped it not seem so dry. Lasted a long time stored at room temp and was extremely satisfying having small servings for breakfast. Will definitely make again, but cook it for a little shorter time frame, esp if your oven runs a little hot like mine.

Spreading was pretty easy with wet hands, and as it cooks it blends together just fine.

Took much longer than I realized- be sure to take it out right away! I left mine in for a couple extra minutes on accident, and it definitely made it less moist. Still delicious though. Tastes amazing with sliced strawberries on top!

This is a good cake-- used reduced fat sour cream and neufchatel cheese; for high altitude, added tbspn flour, tbspn milk, slightly less baking powder/soda, and baked at 360 for a while. Took over an hour to bake up, but very good cake. The upper dough layer was sticky but I applied it in little bits-- took longer but fine result. I think that I will experiment with addition of fruit for the next one.

I followed the recipe exactly and also had trouble spreading the dough. I made the mistake of putting it in the refrigerator  overnight and it was hard as a rock.However, after it softened up, it was very good. It was definitely very time consuming.

Made it exactly as stated. Next time I would add something to add moisture to the cake part, it was somewhat dry - I fixed by eating it in a bowl with milk. I would also add some spices - maybe cardamom, vanilla, to cake mixture as well. Maybe double the topping.

I added some cinnamon to the topping and had to substitute ricotta cheese for the sour cream. I find it was still good and will be making agian. We liked the denceness. And the filling.

I made it exactly as written.  It was very time consuming and wasn't worth the time.  I thought the flavor was very bland.  Possibly if it had some fruit added as a layer it might be better but I'm not keeping the recipe.  I took it to a church function and noticed that many plates had it left to go in the garbage.  Apparently they didn't think it was that good either.  Sorry.

Good flavor, but found it to be very dry. It was extremely sticky and hard to spread into the bottom of the pan. I wouldn't make it again.

It was a great recipe that I made for my wife's birthday this weekend. It was pretty crazy good. I will definitely make it again. I think I will add some spices on the next round, probably some cinnamon. The crumble was really wet and sticky. not sure if I read the recipe wrong or what. Still tasted good though.

5+stars! OMG best coffee cake made so far...even beats out my Pecan Sour Cream coffee cake that I've done for years. Thank you for a wonderful recipe! This will now be my go to recipe. I did alter somewhat and will alter again next time upping my likes.  (I used 8x8 pan only, 1/2'd batter & cream cheese filling, did 3/4x's topping tho. Added 1/2 tsp vanilla to CC filling. Topped CC filling with fresh BC blueberries (in season). Then covered with dough, then topping. I added bit cinnamon & nutmeg to topping while mixing crumb mixture (my preference). NEXT time in less than week, still do 8x8, half batter, but will do 2 cream cheeses (as recipe states), tsp vanilla. 3/4's crumb topping (with cinnamon & nutmeg) & blueberries definitely again. Yes, the dough is sticky, but I dropped by spoonfulls into pan, then greased fingers with butter then finger spread.  TAMMYM.CURRY thank you again for great recipe! *PS:  I never added nuts to topping (granddaughter hates Pecans/nuts...when not making for her to devour, I will add the Pecans). Lol

Meh. Passable. I searched for nearly a week for a great, delicious coffee cake...it seems to be impossible! They're a lot of work (way more so than your usual cake), and just seem not...quite...great. This recipe turned out way too well done on the bottom and edges, the crumble needed more butter bits for a true crumble, and was pretty dry as well. It worked, no complaints from other guests, but I wouldn't make it again.

Okay, but I would add less butter to the cake part for a less salty taste. Also, be sure to bake cake portion for 20 to 30 minutes until its firm, before adding cream cheese layer or cream cheese may seep into cake and blend rather than layer onto it. Adding a few tbsp. of brown sugar to the topping makes it sweeter as well.

Great recipe!  I added cinnamon to the topping and also doubled the topping (I'm a sugar fiend).  Wonderful for breakfast, brunch or dessert!

It was ok. 40 minutes was a hair too long for my oven. I think I would have liked more crumb topping. If I make it again I would double that part.
