Absolutely amazing. I, too, found the sauce to be a bit thin, so I started over, reduced the water & vinegar, and increased the ketchup slightly and it cooked down to a perfect glaze. I used legs and thighs and the amount of flavor was INCREDIBLE, considering the simplicity of the ingredients. The flavors are very bold and Asian.... you couldn't have convinced me that ginger wasn't in this dish if I hadn't made it myself.  Definitely a new favorite.

Thanks for all of the Great Reviews!  The MOST Important part about this recipe is that you HAVE TO BASTE IT!  With a 'baster' every 10 minutes!  Reach in and get the juices and drizzle the sauce all over the chicken.  The sauce thickens as it cooks.

This recipe was totally worth it!  I loved the flavor.  I also did chicken wings.  I'm not sure why previous reviews said the sauce was too thin.  It is thin until you continue to baste your chicken in the oven and it thickens all over the chicken as it bakes and mine was quite thick when done.  This flavor is yummy and reminds me of General Tso's Chicken.  Mmmmm good!  I will definitely be using this recipe again with all different cuts of chicken.

This came out DELISH! My 11 year old so had 2 servings.  I used Chicken Tenderloin and following the recipe of 3 lbs, I had to make a 2nd batch of sauce before putting it in the oven. Followed it to the T and came out great!!! Only thing I will change next time .. More Heat .. at it's written, is sweet no kick (at least not to me) ... make 1/2 for ltlman and 1/2 for me---HOT!   Some stated sauce didn't thicken up....SO not the case - happens in oven stage of recipe. Got thru photos to mine and you can SEE the stickiness!   Thank you so much for submitting!!! Those who try won't be disappointed - especially if you have littleones!

Very tasty - just too sweet. I know you need the sugar to get it sticky, but taste is also important. With 3/4c sugar and a bit more peper the sauce would taste a lot better over rice. I will be using the adapted recipe in future because even the original was good.

This was absolutely delicious!  I followed it to a T and it was perfect.  The sauce was to die for!!  I thought 1 cup of sugar would be too sweet, but it wasn't at all.  I used extra tin foil in the dish I used to bake it in, and there was no mess at all.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thanks so much for sharing such an amazing recipe.  :-)

This was wonderful. I didn't have cornstarch for some reason so I used brown rice flour (I cook gluten free) instead and it was still great. Used chicken tenders and basted every 10 min. The sauce thickened up while it baked and we just loved it. Thank you so much for sharing.

This is a really good recipe, reminds me very much of sweet and sour chicken.  Followed recipe to a T, came out just great.  I was thinking about skipping the fry step though I'm glad I didn't.  Without it the chicken wouldve likely been too soggy.  This recipe is def worth a try, I'll be integrating it into the standard lineup.  Perfect with steamed rice and fresh chopped scallions sprinkled over top before serving.

I made these wings for a recent potluck party at work and I must say I was concerned I had too many wings and to my surprise the crock pot of wings I had made where completely gone. These wings where a huge hit and the sauce was excellent and it did get thick as it baked in the oven. I use the sauce recipe and didn’t change a thing. The only thing I would do differently next time is make a little more sauce and instead of pouring the sauce over the wings I will toss the wings in the sauce that way the wings are completely coated and pour remaining sauce over wings. This is a great recipe and I will prepare these again in the future because it’s well worth the effort. Tekaeureka thanks for sharing this recipe it is fantastic.

This was great. I think it's better on smaller pieces of chicken because the breasts have too much chicken opposed to the glaze. Next time I will use boneless breasts and cut them into smaller pieces so there is a better chicken to glaze ratio.

Delicious! I love it also because it only requires pantry items-and was very easy to do.  I made extra sauce for on rice-everyone loved this dish!  My boys ate leftovers this morning for breakfast and my husband is already asking when I am making it again.  YUM!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Awesome recipe, and even more awesome chicken.  It is like General Tso's without the heat, and that is right fine by me.  Sauce thickened up nicely in the oven, no complaints from me, or my friend who shared it with me during the Steelers football game on Sunday.  Took some leftovers to work and people raved, even at two days old!  Microwaved it at work with a couple tablespoons of water, and it came out just like it did when it was hot out of the oven.  I could go on for hours about this recipe...but will not.  Do not hesitate to make this for family or when company is coming...all who like chicken will LUUUV this!

Absolutely delicious! Took a lil longer to prepare than I like, but it is soooo worth it. I wasn't able to use the garlic salt, considering a family member's health. So, I substituted using "No Salt." My family loved it.  Again, my 11 yr old had no complaints and that is saying something!

This was soo yummy we will be making this allot. I would use a disposible foil pan next time because if the sauce exscapes the foil it is really sticky to remove.  Also we used 51/2, 1/2 boneless skinless chicken breasts and I would double if I had company. For the five of us it will feed us two meals. Thank you so much for this receipe.

My boyfriend and I did not like this at all. I followed the recipe exactly as written and the skin of chicken was soggy even though I fried it before I baked it. It tastes like sweet & sour chicken from the Chinese restaurant, but soggy. I will not be making this again.

Not sure if this is worth all the work.  It was good.  I used boneless chicken breast and cut into bite size pieces.  Tasted very similar to szechuan chicken which we get from the chinese restuar.  after purchasing the chicken it may actually turn out to be cheaper and less work to just get Chinese to go.  I may make this again, maybe instead I will make boneless Buffalo wings.

Great and easy recipe.  As long as you bake it long enough, the sauce will thicken.  Next time I'll experiment and just skip the deep fry part and bake instead for a little bit before adding the sauce.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This was good, but the sauce was very thin.  Next time I will use this cooking method, but just shake the chicken when it is done baking as they do in wing restaurants.

This recipe is excellent! I knew from reading  the ingredients that it would be a winner, and VERY happy with the wings! Instead of basting, I just turned the meat over every ten minutes--excited to make this again and again! Sauce DOES thicken as it bakes--I would not change a THING! Thanks for this one--I LOVE IT !!

This was fantastic! I used chicken tenders and prepared them according to the recipe. For the sauce I added an extra tablespoon of the hot sauce. I thought surely the amount of sugar would be too much! I almost reduced it but didn't. Since I was in a hurry, I kept the chicken on the stove to continue cooking and simmered the sauce on the stove in a separate pot till it got reduced and thick. I stirred it every couple of minutes then poured it over the chicken. My husband and I loved it!! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!

I gave this four stars because although it was very tasty, it was ALOT of work, and pretty messy.  But if you don't mind putting in the time and the cleanup, very good meal.  I also added just a little crushed red pepper at the end to spice it up just a bit.

Thought this recipe was great. Really enjoyed the sauce; excellent flavor, very simple ingredients. I gave four stars only because I altered slightly. To the cornstarch I added about a teaspoon of both garlic powder and sweet paprika, plus 1/8 teaspoon of sea salt. Also, added an extra tablespoon and a half of each the ketchup and the vinegar to the sauce. Will definitely make this one again.

I really loved the flavor of these wings.  I love the sweet and mild spice. My only problem was that the people I made them for didn't like that they were not crispy.  Next time I will fry the wings and instead of baking them in the sauce I will cook the sauce separately and put the sauce on after the wings are cooked and crispy.

These were really good.  I did make some adjustments to the sauce.  After making the sauce i ended up adding brown sugar to it to make it just a bit sweeter and i only used 1/2 tbsp of the hot sauce since i have little kids in the house.  I also used chicken tenders and fried them until done.  i simmered the sauce until it was thickened and i poured it over my tenders.

Made this again for the second time. The first time it was too dry, but this time I covered it with foil. (gimme a break, I'm still learning)I didn't think it could possibly taste any better but it did! It was so juicy and sweet and flavourful. So for those of you that don't know, cover your chicken! Thank you sooo much for sharing this!

Hubby went NUTS over these.  I, too, used chicken wings.  Made exactly as directed with only change being to run them under the broiler for 5" or so to crisp up.  Outstanding.  We had with Pizza Bread and a salad, but would be great with steamed rice   and Asian flavored meal as well.  TYSM for recipe!  Note to self:  this sauce is amazing.  When boiled on stovetop, would make a GREAT sweet & sour sauce;  when reduced (as others have noted) tastes just like General Tso's chicken sauce.

oh WOW.  This was so delicious, I made it with wings and it was truly "bone sucking" good.  My children weren't crazy about it but I think it was because of having to touch the sticky chicken (due to bones), I am definitely going to try it with chunks of boneless skinless breasts next time.  My husband cleaned his plate as well but did say he would prefer it to be bone free.  I served this over brown rice and some asian-inspired sauteed veggies, and it was instantly one of my new favorite recipes.  I followed the recipe for the sauce exactly (using rice vinegar and homemade ketchup), but my son is allergic to eggs and corn, so I omitted the eggs and used a mixture of brown rice flour, tapioca starch, and garbanzo bean flour for the breading.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for the excellent recipe, what a treat!

I read the reviews first, very helpful.  I had some chicken legs to use up; it took about 50 minutes in oven and basted about every 10 minutes.  Left out the hot sauce because there were small children eating, but will try it next time.  Ate the while hot, and tried the leftovers cold.  Both ways were very good.  thanks for sharing.

Turned out really well but too sweet for us.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar and increase the hot sauce and garlic.  The sauce did thicken up as it cooked.

Delicious! Best tasting wings I've ever made! My teenager said "mad good mom" (teenager lingo) she couldn't stop eating them. Definitely a keeper. I didn't have any cornstarch left and used flour instead. Still worked!

I made this recipe for a family potluck/picnic and it was such a huge hit, everyone talked about how great it was and none left to lug home! I made this with chicken tenders instead of cut up chicken pieces, it was easier to eat that way. Delicious!!

OMG so easy so delicious!!!! I must say I was a little skeptical about just using garlic salt as seasoning, afraid it would be bland but was I ever wrong..Also never fried with just cornstarch before and the chicken was surprisingly moist juicy and crunchy! I think I would prefer a little more pepper sauce but I'll ty that next time because I'll definately make again!

Absolutely Delish! My whole family devoured this chicken with zero complaints! It is a keeper! Delicious,sweet&crispy! I did use half cornstarch and half flour and reduced the vinegar just a personal preference...I will make this again very very soon!!

I made this last night, and I followed the recipe exactly. My grandmother used to make something like this, and so I was anxious to try it! It has to be the same recipe, because it brought back so many memories! It was perfect! I wouldn't change a thing! Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe was very sweet.  We're not big fans of sweet with our meat and were not expecting that at all. If I were a fan of Chinese takeout then this would far exceed that which is why I gave it the 3 stars.

I've never been a big fan of cold chicken and I don't feel like starting now. But this chicken recipe is the best one I have ever personally made! And, I used chicken thighs which stay moist anyway. So this one heated up very nicely. I reheated mine at 300 degrees for 25 minutes on foil and I included a slice of sweet onion on which I put a little oil, salt and pepper, and it was great to have these two items together. I highly recommend this. Wow, Mom!

My family loved it.  I made chicken legs (kids favorite) and wings.  The only changes I made was to use 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup honey instead of the whole cup of sugar.  I also added a tablespoon of corn starch to the water and put that in after it got bubbly.  This helped thicken the sauce up a lot before I even put it on the chicken.  The result was perfectly sticky chicken. Yummm.  Only reason I gave it four stars was because the sauce needed a little tweaking to be thick and sticky and the dish is time consuming to make.

No one in my family could eat this, it was soggy after basting in the oven, I cut the cooking time down, and the chicken was still over cooked.

This recipe was delicious! I tweeked it a bit, but not by much. Instead of using garlic salt to rub on my raw chicken thighs, I used Tony's Creole Seasoning to give it a kick of heat. I also used half cornstarch and half all purpose flour seasoned with a bit of salt and pepper for taste. I added about a 1/4 cup of Crystal hot sauce and a teaspoon of cayenne pepper to balance out the sweetness of the sauce. I also doubled the recipe for the sauce, so I have extra for another meal. I think I will try it on un-floured chicken next time, even though the crust was very good. I did baste it every ten minutes as instructed and flipped the chicken over half way through baking. My family loved it, especially my husband. I will definitely make it again!!!
