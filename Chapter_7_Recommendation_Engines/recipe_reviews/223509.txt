Thank you Lucky Noodles, for this great recipe!  Hubs was in gazpacho heaven.  I made this a day ahead of time, doubling the recipe.  Since I wanted a chunky soup, I went about this a little differently.  I started by pulsing my tomatoes in the food processor until I achieved the texture I was after and poured them into a bowl.  I did the same with the bell peppers (I used red, green and yellow) and onions and poured them in the bowl.  Then again with the cucumbers.  This allowed me to control the texture of all the vegetables.  Finally, again in the food processor, I pulsed the bouillon, fresh oregano, fresh basil, seasonings, Worcestershire and red wine vinegar, along with about 1/2 cup of the tomato juice (I used V-8), then adding it to the bowl with the other processed veggies.  I then added the remaining V-8 to the bowl to get the consistency I was looking for and ended up using it all.  We enjoyed this the following evening with a sandwich for a delicious, easy meal.  Thanks Lucky!

There is something in this that makes you keep coming back, I did add zucchini and yellow squash and a little less worcestershire because it is not a flavor we are crazy about, nice meat free meal thanks.

This really is a nice recipe.  I did spice it up a bit for our taste preference by adding one large jalape√±o and a couple good shakes of Tabasco.  I used V8 juice instead of tomato juice because it's what I had on hand and served with a dollop of plain yogurt.  The only thing that I will do differently in the future is pulse separately the tomatoes and the cukes to have a little chunkier texture.  If you're a gazpacho fan, give this a try.  Great for summer or any time of the year.  This one is a keeper.

I do not know what persuaded Lucky to make this. I made it as written and we ENJOYED it. She should be crowned! I loved the flavor of the veggies. It was as if I was drinking a V-8! The spices was the right amount too! Thanks for sharing this recipe, Lucky. Now do another happy dance ;)

I made and rated this prior to being a published recipe, this is my review from July 9:  I love gazpacho soup when the temperatures are soaring high outside. I used vine ripe tomatoes and a bit more cucumber, didn't know what to do with the other half. I used my food processor to puree everything together. V-8 was my juice, which I added until it reached the consistency I liked, since I like my soup to be on the thicker side. Most gazpachos taste like you are eating a bowl of salsa without spice, however the added beef bouillon and Worcestershire sauce give sharper flavors that linger on the palate, more like a winter soup would. I did cut the beef bouillon down to one tsp. to reduce some of the sodium, since I have to watch that. I used fresh spices from the garden also. Gazpacho is best if you give it at least 4 hours for the flavors to marinate. Thanks Lucky, great summer soup.

Years ago in college a friend invited me to lunch with her Cuban born mother.  This lovely lady made gazpacho a dish I had never had but just loved.  It was so good!  I had tried other recipes over the years but none had just that right flavor.  I really enjoyed this recipe.  It is a keeper!

Very good for a summer day. Did not have any Worcestershire sauce;  so left it out.  Otherwise followed directions.  I had some leftover which I ate about 3 hours later;  even better tasting!!  Next time, I will make the day before and let flavors blend longer.  Thanks, Lucky, for sharing.

I think I'm in love! This will be a go-to this summer - especially when the heat really kicks in! I used [nearly] a pint of grape tomatoes and left out the celery salt, because I didn't have any. Can't wait to make it again, soon, with the halves of veggies I have leftover (=

Another thumbs up! I always add a little bit of sugar to any tomato-based dish I make to brighten it up a bit; that's the only thing I changed. Superb for this hot weather, and insanely healthy!

It is delicious!  I used a can of diced tomatoes that I put in the food processor instead of the tomatoes, eliminated the beef bouillon and vinegar, and added a bit less Worcestershire sauce.  I've had it in the fridge for days as a low calorie snack.

I add tabasco to taste for some extra zip.  Add some grilled or ready to eat shrimp to this to make it extra-special.

I love this dish. I don't even like tomato soup or tomato juice but this is delish!  I followed the recipe and so glad I did. I wouldn't change anything. I didn't know if my husband would like it as made so I added chick peas and some other fresh veggies but that was only for filling. It wasn't necessary. Served it with a crusty baguette. Thank you for this recipe.

Spectacular! I made this for a potluck last night -- 20+ people. I quadrupled the recipe (figuring I'd have plenty left over), but there wasn't a drop left. Everyone raved about it.

I made only a few modest tweaks, based largely on what was at hand: (1) I used V8, which is always a plus; (2) I used Better than Bouillon beef base rather than cubes (again, always a plus); and I used celery seed instead of celery salt, and Lawry's seasoned salt instead of regular salt.

As has been mentioned in other reviews, I pulsed the veg separately in my food processor. Short bursts allow a perfect size/texture for each veg. Force yourself to stop one or two pulses before you THINK it's done... (oh, and: I cored and seeded the tomatoes, and seeded the cukes).

Finally, I combined all in a Hefty Jumbo 2.5 gallon zip bag (my secret weapon): once everything was combined I tossed and turned it all every hour or so. These bags make for perfect blending, and easy transport.

It was a huge hit six hours later; and it's even better 24 hours later ( confession: I held some back)!

Thanks, Lucky Noodles!

I added a jalapeno and it helped some - but too much oregano, basil - needed cilantro.  Good, but will not be using again.

I made this for a luncheon for the board of directors of our parish soup kitchen where I have to strike a balance between using donated ingredients and producing an impressive meal.  The changes I had to make were due to what was on hand, so my tomatoes were home canned by a volunteer, I replaced the tomato juice with V8, the cucumber became zucchini, the peppers were all red.  I increased the garlic and had no celery salt.  Oh, and since one member is vegetarian I omitted the beef granules.  I used a heavy hand with the black pepper.  The meal was rounded out with rosemary focaccia bread and a fruit salad.  Not to brag, but I got rave reviews!  Thanks, LN!

This was delicious! I made it exactly as written and while we aren't huge gazpacho fans, we do enjoy it occassionally on a hot summer day. This is our favorite gazpacho so far! Day 2 it was even better and I diced some extra cucumber, bell pepper, avocado to give it a little texture. My husband topped his bowl off with some sour cream. Next time I make this, I'm thinking I'll make an avocado crema and pipe it in as well as sour cream around his bowl for presentation. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I made this as directed, and everyone loved it. Very easy, and best made ahead of time for flavors to come together.
I had garnishes of diced yellow pepper, green onion and parsley. But whatever you have on hand will work.
I will make this again.

I am on my 6th batch this year!  I have varied the recipe from batch to batch.  
Different color peppers and only half of one, not half of two.  I had a stick of celery I threw in one batch--didn't notice much difference.
I use V8 instead of tomato juice and only use one small can (5 1/2 oz).  Otherwise, too soupy for my taste.

It was good. I did end up using about 1/2 cup more tomato juice than called for, and I added the Worcestershire sauce to taste so used about half of it. I ended up doubling the garlic and adding a stalk of celery. I did not add any salt (the bouillon was plenty) and instead of black pepper I used a hefty shot of hot sauce. It could probably use some parsley or cilantro.

This was very good.  I had to leave out the garlic due to an allergy and the cucumber because I didn't have one, but otherwise I followed the recipe.  After tasting it, I decided to add a can of tiny shrimp and a couple dashes of smoked paprika.  I see this one being served again at my house in the future.

Very good recipe! I've never had gazpacho before and I really liked it. The only thing I would change is a little less onion the next time around, but will definitely make again!

Warm summer days and gazpacho, what could be better!?!? This was so easy and enjoyable! As many suggested, I used V8 but otherwise followed the recipe. I waited a full 24 hours to let the flavors blend. Good stuff! Thanks, Lucky!

I'm searching for The Perfect Gaspacho.  This was OK.  I'd eat it again, but it's not exactly what I'm looking for.  I ate it immediately, perhaps if I'd let it chill for a day or two it would have been better.
