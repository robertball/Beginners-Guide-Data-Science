A quick and easy recipe for a wonderful old, traditional (and historic) bread.  This was always kept at Jefferson's Monticello.
Makes wonderful French Toast, Bread Pudding and Breakfast Sausage Casserole.

Really nice bread. Very easy to make and tastes great. Cross between a cake and a bread. Braided mine and baked on sheet pan.  Made excellent french toast. Will make again.

This is a wonderful example of an old-time tea bread-light,sweet and easy to make.An excellent choice for the first-time breadmaker and old pro alike. I must point out,however, that it is not a fried bread as it is  described.It's more of a yeast cake. I served mine with homemade lemon curd and both recieved rave reviews.

This is a wonderful bread. A buttery, classic bread that is best served warm with honey butter. I have layered the ingredients according to the manufacturer's recommendations in my bread machine. The bread came out beautifully using the medium crust setting.

This bread is so yummy with a light vanilla cake batter flavor.   My kids beg for me to make it all the time. I just bake it in a regular bread pan.  This is not a pound cake or sweet bread.  It's light and fluffy.   Very good.

I wasn't impressed at all with this.When it's baked in a tube cake pan you expect it to taste like a cake as well.I could taste the vanilla in this but that wasn't enough to save it from tossing what's left in the garbage.Maybe this is what they used to eat in the 17'th century but not now.In case you can't tell,I won't be making this again.

My hubby and I loved this with honey butter.  This recipe is just absolutely phenomenal and I came across it by accident.  Give it a try - I promise it is well worth it.

I skipped the vanilla and used Silk Coconut milk.  When I put the bread to rise in a regular loaf tin, I rubbed softened butter on top and sprinkled a cinnamon sugar mix over it. My husband has declared that this recipe is a keeper. Thank you for sharing it.
