After looking at the others comments I decided to add half a cup of stock & more peanut butter & some honey. It turns out perfect! Also, I halved the ingredients as it was only for a certain amount of people and worked out.

I'm sorry but this recipe is not good at all. It's too dry.

We LOVE this recipe! I add more (hot) salsa and more coconut milk. I also sneak in some jalape√±os.

not as easy as I expected and felt like I had to be home the whole day even though it is a crock pot recipe. it got the job done to get rid of my pad Thai craving though.

I can't rate this too well since I had to take out the nuts due to allergies, but all in all, I thought they still turned out pretty good! Unfortunetely, because it was a lot of prep time and not a lot of time in the actual crock pot, I couldn't leave the house like I wanted.
