This turned out very well. I liked it well enough, boyfriend LOVED it, everyone else seemed to like it. I used small crimini button mushrooms. I also replaced the vegan margarine with unsalted butter, used a Walla Walla sweet onion, and vegetable broth in place of the mushroom broth. I didn't stir any milk into the soup, but I drizzled heavy cream on top of it for decoration and garnished each bowl with a single fresh sage leaf. If you love sage, sunchokes, or mushrooms, you will love this bisque. It's worth the prep and worth a try! Note: I found Jerusalem artichokes at my local Safeway, they were labeled as "Sunflower Chokes," and were sold in the produce section in 1 lb packages.

Update: To be a true bisque, add the milk. It also cuts the intensity of the flavor and creates a rich creaminess which is nice. Also, bisques are traditionally served in mugs or double-handled bowls on saucers :) Oh, and this recipe makes more than 6 main dish servings, more like 8, maybe even more (you're not meant to eat a huge bowl of this type of soup).

This was totally delicious and well worth the prep time. I used baby bella mushrooms and olive oil instead of the vegan marg to saute the onion. Did not need/use soy milk at the end. What a unique and flavorful soup! YUM.

Excellent.  I used 16 oz mushroom and veggie stock instead of mushroom stock.

I've got to give this 5 stars. Really delicious. These days, I rarely try recipes with so few ratings, and I'm so glad I did this time! What fabulous flavor. What a perfect combination of ingredients. I did find that after simmering and blending, there wasn't enough liquid for the proper consistency. I just added milk until it looked right.  Other than that, follow the recipe, though. The recipe is dead on. Thanks, "smallu."

Couldn't find Jerusalem artichokes so I used parsnips instead and added shitake mushrooms as well=awesome. I also de-veganized it and it worked fine.

As always I made this to the letter (excluding the Vegan part) the first time. It is a fabulous soup with a very unique flavor composition. I Will make this again possibly doing the Chokes and Mushrooms in the smoker for that added touch. I also may freeze the leftovers and use it as a sauce to compliment a beef or pork dish.

Well I adapted this a bit and it was great. I didn't have enough sunchokes so I put in white asparagus in addition to make up the difference. I put them in the oven with the mushrooms. This was fantastic! Tasted like a wild mushroom soup.  I poured in a little whipping cream at the end in the bowl to give it a swirl like in the picture. I didn't want to add it to the soup because then there is something in it that can spoil and I plan to freeze some. Will definitely be using this technique again. I thought it would be a little bland with the addition of straight water but the roasted veggies turned it into a broth of its own almost immediately.

I didn't measure amounts, other than the 8oz package of mushrooms and I didn't add the optional soymilk.  I saut√©ed the onions in butter and EVOO in my Instantpot till translucent and used a large TB of jarred minced garlic.  Added rough chopped sunchokes and potatoes, broth, salt, fresh sage and some dried basil.  I cooked at pressure for 10min, did rapid release, emulsified, and then added the mushrooms and brought back to pressure for 1 minute.  It doesn't look as creamy as it tastes, but is amazing.

Delicious! Homegrown sunchokes with small yukon golds and crimini mushrooms. I used butter and half-n-half in place of the vegan options. I added a little soy sauce for depth of flavor plus a lot of pepper. As a soup it was tasty on a chilly fall day. I also did just steps 1-3 for a side dish. I added dashes of worcestshire and soy plus sprigs of fresh parsley to the garlic, onion, potatoes, sunchokes and mushrooms before roasting.

This recipe is so good, I'm finishing the soup, just in 6 oz portions, not 16 oz.  Hopefully those portions will allow me to finish this incredibly good soup without further problems.
I did make an adjustment to the recipe. I halved the recipe and used 16 oz Swanson's vegetable broth (plus 8 oz water) and simmered it with 8 oz finely chopped baby belly mushrooms to make the mushroom broth.

I bought Jerusalem artichokes from a local supplier without any knowledge about the taste of them or how to cook them.  This soup looked tasty and I had everything I needed on hand.  The only thing I changed was omitting the water by 1 cup and increasing the milk by 1 cup.  I also used regular 1% milk.

Yes, I tried this today.  I used olive oil instead of fake margarine. I was out of it. I used more potatoes, due to not having enough artichokes.  Its delicious.  Thank you for sharing.
