Excellent recipe! My first time making coconut macaroons and these came out great. The few recipes I looked at before this one called for condensed milk or unbeaten egg whites which sounded unusual.  So I tried my hand at this recipe. It was pretty simple to whip together, easier than making chocolate chip cookies (and healthier). I don't think I'll ever need to resort to using condensed milk, this IS the perfect coconut macaroon recipe.

These were divine! They turned out exactly as I hoped they would. They seemed just like a macaroon from a bakery. Wonderful texture and just the right amount of sweetness. The ratio of ingredients works perfectly. I find this kind of macaroon to be so much better than the kind made with sweetened condensed milk. I prefer larger shreds of coconut, so I skipped the step with the food processor. Instead I mixed all of the ingredients (minus the egg whites and extracts) in the mixer on low speed until well combined. After moving that mixture to a large bowl, I beat the eggs whites and then beat in the extracts. I omitted the almond extract this time, but I may add it back in next time. Thank you for such a wonderful and easy recipe!

I had very high hopes for this recipe... I did the first batch as directed 350 for 15 min.  but they didn't seem 'right'.. so I decreased the heat to 325 and upped the time to 22 min.  Those were much better. I used tablespoons , as I am not sure what golf ball sized meant.
I pulsed the coconut in the food processor for 30 sec as directed, but in future batches, I think I will leave the coconut shaggier for a lighter, slightly dense  macaroon.  or at least only pulse half of the coconut.
I did like the half vanilla half almond flavoring.  

Overall, will make again, but with the changes as mentioned.

I tried this recipe and liked it but I used 6 Tablespoons of flour and 1 teaspoon of Baking Powder and beat my egg whites till a stiff peak formed and then folded everything in. They came out perfectly round and high. Hope this helps

These really WERE perfect!  I made them for a friend's birthday, and they were a huge hit.  I made them the night before, and refrigerated them until ready to eat.  
The yeild of the recipe for me was about 20 macaroons.  I would've probably had a lot more, but I didn't beat the eggwhites enough, so they completely fell when I added the coconut.  Next time I make these macaroons, I will whip those eggwhites until there's no tomorrow.

Excellent!  My second batch is in the oven now.  I took the suggestion and used the 6 tbsp. of flour and 1 tsp. of baking powder. I did not have almond extract so I omitted. I also mixed in bowl without processing.  I beat my egg whites to stiff peaks. Wetting the hands really helps solve the stickiness. I like my brown and toasty, so I kept them in the oven 20-25 minutes watching carefully. (My oven sucks so don't go by my time.)  This is a keeper that will I will make often.  Thanks!!!

I absolutely LOVE coconut macaroons. I had 3 egg whites leftover and wanted to do something rather than throw them out and this was the perfect recipe to use them in. I made the recipe exactly as written except for dipping them in chocolate (I may try that later). These were absolutely fabulous! Sweet enough without being too sweet. I would NOT recommend adding extra flour as some reviews suggest - it would likely make them too dry. If you have a hard time with them holding together just "squeeze" the balls hard, packing the dough together. This is what I did and it worked beautifully!!! This will be my go to recipe for sure!

I usually don't like recipes that say they are the best or perfect, but these truthfully are! I made for a friend who adores macaroons and she couldn't stop raving, a good dark chocolate is a must for dipping too. I used my #50 scoop and got 18 cookies, will make a bit smaller next time.

Absolutely fabulous!  I tried the macaroon recipes with sweetened condensed milk and found them to be way too sweet, with a glossy, weird texture.   These looked and tasted like they came from a high-end bakery.  This is going in my collection of treasured family recipes.

Ok, don't know why anyone would have a problem making this.  They are my make-at-home Mounds Bar craving.  Perfectly delicious.  I only had vanilla, so I doubled the amount.  One thing you have to do is squeeze the "dough" balls to get them to stay together better.  Don't add more flour.  Some liquid will ooze out but it keeps them intact.  After baking, I let them cool, then dipped in the heated chocolate, put on waxed paper and refrigerated.  OMG!  Can't stop eating these yummies.

The Best Recipe.  Very easy and quick.  Tastes great.  Drizzled mine with chocolate.  Looked like I had work hours in the kitchen when in fact I had spent about 20 min.

I have made these macaroons several times now.  I make them as directed except I don't use the food processor, I just mix the ingredients with a fork.  I also use the 100% egg whites you can purchase in a carton.   They are easy and yummy with or without the chocolate.  My husband loves coconut and these don't last long in our house.  
the last time I made them I did not add the additional sugar and found them to just as good.

I was looking for a macaroon recipe that was light, fluffy and not too sweet. This was it! I also did not pulse the ingredients in the food processor since I like the long strands of coconut. I went with 3 tbsp. of flour instead of 1. Like other reviewers, I baked at 325 for 20 minutes. I dipped the bottoms in chocolate. I love this recipe because it is so easy!

I followed the recipe exactly with exception to the food processor. I just mixed the coconut, sugar and flour with my hands to incorporate well, then mixed the extracts into the egg whites and folded everything together. You couldn't ask for a more perfect macaroon. I didn't even bother dipping them in chocolate because I liked the plain ones so much. Thank you for a great recipe!

Made these gluten free by substituting Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Flour Mix. Used the 6 T flour & 1 t baking powder as suggested by Lisad25. These really did come out bakery quality. Had to bake 20 minutes in convection oven.

Ok, I have now made this recipe three times now.  I like more of the whole shreds of coconut, so the first two times, I didn't process them.  I had at least 2 from each batch fall apart (still delicious though).  This time, I processed 2/3 of the coconut and some still fell apart.  Also, after the 15 min. cooking time, they look undone.  Delicious recipe, just not sure what I am doing wrong.

Excellent recipe! I didn't really like this at first because I was used to my mom's recipe with condensed milk. But when I tried it again the next day, it was delicious! Perfect amount of sweetness! I followed the recipe to the T except the processor part; I like to chew on the texture of shredded coconut. I used mini muffin pans and got 40 small pieces(about 31 calories each) and baked at 325F for 18minutes. Will definitely make again!

Perfect is correct! Recipe didn't need any fiddling, they turned out wonderful first try. I like mine a little more toasted, so I may make them smaller next time, but they were still wonderful tasting.

I loved the taste and texture of these macaroons. Following the advice of others I only put half the bag of coconut into the food processor. Then left half the bag whole to give the cookies a great texture. I substituted equal amount of Lorann almond emulsion for the almond extract. That took the flavor over the top. This recipe is perfect and will be my "go to" from now on.

I love this recipe, macaroons taste like heaven. I'm gonna use it from now on.  It is important to let macaroons cool down totally without touching them, they will not fall apart.  Thank you!

Excellent recipe! Exactly what I was looking for in a coconut macaroon. Used all vanilla - no almond flavoring. No chocolate just pure coconut goodness! Also, used a cookie scoop with great success - no sticking what-so-ever. Easy recipe, quick to make up and tastes great! Thanks very much for this recipe!

I've never made macaroons before and these turned out great! I liked the idea of using egg whites instead of condensed milk. They were still plenty sweet. I didn't have parchment paper so I just greased some aluminum foil. Quick and easy recipe!

these are easy to make and good with or without the chocolate (I melted milk chocolate chips and dipped and drizzled half).  I used small cookie scoop and packed tightly- then used fingers to shape into triangles and circles. I liked the triangles better as there was more crispiness- I also baked until quite golden as I like the carmelization. I followed the recipe as written (how unusual) and used a bag of coconut that was slightly stale (had been opened for a while.) I will make again!

I made these as the recipe was written except for some reviewers comments. I processed half of the coconut and cooked them at 325 degrees for 20 minutes on parchment paper. They were incredible. Way better than store bought.

These were so easy to make and came out delicious!  So much better than the recipes that call for sweetened condensed milk.  I did not use my food processor so my macaroons have larger pieces of coconut - next time I will use the processor but I think either way these are a winner!  Used melted bittersweet chocolate to drizzle.  I only made five cookie recipes this year for Christmas, and these are my favorite.

I made these for a Christmas party this week, and they were a huge hit! My food processor was broken, and I prefer bigger shreds of coconut anyway, so I mixed the dry ingredients the old fashioned way in a bowl with a spoon. I also added an extra tablespoon of flour (any more and they would start to dry), and for the chocolate I did half semi-sweet and half dark. All in all, a truly fantastic recipe!

I didn't like this recipe very much. It is possible I did something wrong thoughz not only did the cookies fall apart, they didn't taste very good.

I'll preface my review by saying that I don't like coconut macaroons. I hate coconut. I have a hard time stomaching anything that calls for egg whites beaten until they form soft, foamy-looking peaks. But when I found myself in possession of a fresh coconut, I had to come up with SOMETHING to do with it. I found this recipe, thought "Well, Dad likes macaroons..." and got baking. They came out a little drippier than I expected, but I assume that's due to the fresh (and therefore containing more liquid than dried) coconut I used and not any fault with the recipe. They were a huge hit with my Dad (he ate about half the batch). Even I liked them enough to eat a whole one! Dad brought the remainder to my grandparents' house and my grandpa, who has never sneaked any food ever in his life, ate 4 (out of 6) while no one was looking. He liked them so much that I made a batch just for him for his 89th birthday party. These truly are the perfect macaroons! I'd highly recommend using fresh coconut if you can find one - they'll be a bit runnier until they bake and they won't turn slightly golden, but the flavor is fantastic.

Made them today and they turned out excellent! My friends and neighbors said they were "spot on". The only thing I changed is the time in the oven. Increased the time by 5-7min and reduced the heat to 325 after initial 12 min at 350. And super easy to make. Someone said here the amount doesn't fix in a regular size food processor, I say don't be lazy and do it twice, doesn't take that much time

Very disappointing. Added extra flour as some suggested - far too dry. Also, a standard food processor isn't big enough to blend the ingredients.

This was my first time making macrons. They turned out great! Heads up, baking time varies based on your oven. I had to add 10 minutes to the baking time due to my oven circling the drain.  I had fun making these cookies.

I used three egg whites and a half cup of flour plus the one tablespoon of flour. When I rolled them I used dry hands and kinda squeezed them until the “juices” came out and then rolled them. They came out great!

Exceptionally easy recipe! Turned out amazing. I made them a little larger, to make them more like the ones they sell at Disneyland. The chocolate was a little tricky, but having never used a double broiler I warmed up the chocolate chips in the microwave and used a spatula to spread onto the macaroons. I will be using this recipe again and again!!

So good and so easy! I *almost* followed the recipe exactly as written, except for two things. 1) I only had bulk coconut, so after googling, I used 5 cups. Unfortunately I ran out after 4 so for the last one I used unsweetened.
2) We like a little extra coconut texture, so I only wizzed half the coconut with the rest, then mixed the remaining 2.5 cups of coconut in with a fork afterward before adding it to the egg whites. 
I *really* squished them into 1tbsp sized balls, and they did take about 22 min to get a nice toasted brown. I ended up with 43 unbelievably delicious cookies that I can't keep my husband's hands off! This will be a holiday staple from now on!

This is a fantastic recipe! I love coconut macaroons, but I have never found a recipe as good as this one. I didn't want one that used sweetened condensed milk and this one doesn't. It's simple, easy, and, with or without the chocolate, these cookies are amazing! I followed the recipe exactly. The only change I made was that they did not look done after 15 minutes so I added probably 15 minutes to the cooking time. I made these to take to Passover Seder tonight so I will need to make another batch tomorrow for me!

I’ve made other recipes in the past and they would always spread.  Since I lost my old recipe that I perfected I had to find something  new.  Used  a little over  a half table spoon  vanilla   that’s all I had.    I was making these for Passover so I did not add the flour .  used 1 tablespoon and a half potato starch.  I made my egg white stiff and added the  vanilla to the egg whites.   I found out the baking for 15 minutes did not work so I baked for 18 to 20 minutes.  I only got 15 macaroons.

I made these and we loved them! I didn't dip the cookies in chocolate at the end, though, because they were perfect without the chocolate! Maybe I'll try that next time... :)

OMG! These are SO good!  My husband doesn't like coconut--or so he thought--but when he tasted these macaroons he totally changed his mind! Can't get enough.  I have to make another batch for the holidays for sure.  I used 3 Tbsp of flour as recommended by others and lowered the  temp to 325, gave it about 18-20 minutes.  They were perfect!

I used coconut extract as the base flavor, and separated a double batch in two. One part I added vanilla extract and pecans, the other I added lime extract and almonds. Same procedure as the rest except I drizzled caramel over the pecan ones= German chocolate and almond lime macaroons. They were a hit at my work.

I may have over baked them.  They were good but a little dry. I baked according to instructions.

Very easy! I used 4T flour (split the difference per other's suggestion). Next time I'll follow the recipe and use 1, as I want them "stickier". Skipped the food processer step as I wanted coconut as is. Not too sweet, easy to work with.

These coconut macaroons have something for everyone. I read the reviews that said they were too dry or fell apart, so I put in a little less flour. My family really liked them, and I will definitely make them again! :-)

After eating coconut macaroons made with condensed milk I have to say eating these were so much better. I took the advice of others and added a few more tablespoons of flour and 1 tsp of baking powder.  The macaroons came out perfect and delicious. It was a big hit with co- workers. Thanks for sharing.

I can't vouch for the taste, because I don't like coconut; however, I made these for a coworker's birthday upon request, and they have been highly praised. I followed the recipe exactly.

Excellent. They looked perfect and tasted delicious. However if I make them again I think I'll omit the almond extract. Everyone liked them but I thought the almond was The wrong flavor. Either just vanilla or maybe coconut extract?

These came out fantastic, just like the italian bakery!
Some things I found out:
I made using the amount of flour called for in the recipe and they came out fine. I wouldn't increase the flour as some have done. 
The recipe calls for processing the coconut/sugar/flour/extracts/salt mixture for 30 seconds. I found that they came out best with about 15 seconds of processing.  Any more and they lost some texture. Any less, and they had a tendency to fall apart a bit. The 15 seconds in the processor worked perfect and they held together nicely. 

For the chocolate I dipped the bottoms in as well as the sides. I had to use a bit more than the recipe called for. 

They are chocolatey, chewy, coconuty, and not at all fake tasting or overly sweet.  Will definitely be making these again!

Noticed they were very wet and had to squeeze moisture out to place on cookie sheet for baking. Also had to bake longer as they were still very wet and runny after 15 minutes. Fell apart as I tried to get them off the cookie sheet with a spatula.

The taste is very good but mine came out a bit crumbly.  Next time l'll add  an extra egg white as the mixture was on a bit on the dry side.  I used my hand mixer instead of a food processor.

Hands down the BEST coconut macaroon recipe ever. They come out so nicely and it is so easy to make. I was just scrolling through recipes for the perfect coconut macaroon and now I refuse to use anything but this recipe. I didn't use the almond extract so I'm not sure if it adds something more but it still comes out amazing!

Super easy and pretty!  And, Gluten Free if you skip the flour....which I did because I forgot about it.  But they held together and tasted like a Mounds Bar.  My GF kid was thrilled to have a Christmas Cookie he could eat!!!

Followed the recipe exactly yet the macaroons fell apart upon transfer to the cooling rack. The flavor was ok but a bit too sweet for my liking. Didn't bother with the chocolate as I wasn't able to serve them in a crumble anyway. Will not be making again.

The flavour was good, but they were dry and crumbly; that might be because I used unsweetened coconut and gluten free flour. I like using unsweetened coconut, so next time I plan to use two extra egg whites to see if that will make then more moist.

Mine came out great! I changed the recipe slightly to make them vegan and gluten free and they still held together using whipped aquafaba instead of egg and a gluten free all purpose flour. Thanks for the great recipe!

EASY and YUMMY! I used dark chocolate drizzle and I couldn't keep them away from a couple of teenage girls (and my wife).

Fantastic recipe! I couldn't believe how simple they were to make. It's going to be a regular family cookie choice in this house for sure. I also can't wait to make them for friends and a passing dessert choice.

If you are looking for a lighter version of the standard macaroon, this is a great recipe.  We thought they were wonderful.

5 stars! My teenage daughter made these at Christmas and they were incredible. She said dipping in the chocolate was difficult but the result was worth it. Personally, I think these would be just as good drizzled liberally with chocolate. I admit the recipe didn't sound like what I expected but the result is amazing.

Delicious!  I don't have a blender so I ran about  half the coconut mixture through my Magic Bullet break it down.  Added the extracts to the egg whites while I whipped them.  Got 24 macaroons from 1 batch and ate them too fast to dip them in chocolate!

Made it just as written except I didn't use the food processor I just used my mixer to make the coconut mixture, then folded in the eggs once they were beaten. They were amazing! Thanks for the recipe.

My sister and I lover macaroons and this is a great recipe.  Not too sweet and the toasted coconut is crunchy outside, but the inside is still moist and chewy.  I made mine Gluten free by just substituting 
one tablespoon corn starch for the flower. Used the processor and used a heaping Tablespoon packing it in to shape it.  They held together.  Did the chocolate too, but microwaved the chocolate chips 1 minute with 1/4 teaspoon butter, stir, microwave more if necessary.  Great! Thanks!

I can't actually eat coconut due to an intolerance I have, but my grandmother LOVES macaroons so I made her a batch for Christmas. Everybody in the family loved them! I will definitely make them again.

Super easy and fun recipe. Never made Macaroons before and these came out awesome! I did follow a couple of other reviews' advice and skipped the food processor step. Also, I drizzled the melted chocolate over cookies as is shown in one of the pics…very pretty cookie

I have obviously done something wrong, as they all feel apart.  I had to do one thing differently and that is, use unsweetened coconut instead of the sweetened kind. Maybe that was the problem.

I was looking for a recipe to use up the half bag of coconut I had in my pantry. These were really very good and easy to make. I cut the recipe in half and used all almond extract because I ran out of vanilla and I think I like that better. Thanks for sharing!

My family loved these!  Living in China I don't have access to everything (namely the extracts and electric beaters to get the egg whites nice and frothy) but did the best I could and they were delicious.

These really ARE the Perfect Coconut Macaroon! I'm always leary when I read reviews that it's the best recipe; however this is true to me. They taste just like my local bakery and since I can control the amount of sugar added_- I cut amount of sugar in half (actually doesn't really need sugar at all!).  I just stirred in bowl, not in food processor, cause I like the taste of coconut flakes and baked at 325 for 17-19 minutes or a bit crispy brown on top.  I made for a family party and were gone in minutes!  Tks for this great recipe-it's a definite keeper for macaroons!

These are outstanding.  I had previously made the recipe with sweetened condensed milk and that is all they tasted like they were too sweet.  These are light and just enough sweet and chewy.  Like others I skipped the food processor and just mixed well by hand.  I than added small amounts to the beaten egg whites, they turned out great.  Will make again.
