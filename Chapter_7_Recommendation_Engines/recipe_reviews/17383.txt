This is a great recipe for the holidays.
I did make some changes though.
First, I used dark brown sugar. I then combined the butter and brown sugar, and used a pastry cutter and cut the butter into the sugar until well combined. It seems to do better this way then to melt the butter.
Next I separated the egg yokes and added the yokes to the mixture, but I beat the egg whites to a stiff peak, then added to mixture, and mixed very well.

Always be sure raisins have completely cooled.

NOTES: In this recipe, I used real butter, not marg. as you can actually see the difference in the finished desert if you use marg.
