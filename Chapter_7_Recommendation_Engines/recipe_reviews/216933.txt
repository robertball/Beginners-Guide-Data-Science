MY dad of all people started making this and it wasn't MY traditional way. I gave him "the eye" while watching him throw apple juice and mustard of all things into it. I must admit..."the eye" felt stupid as I was eating the most delicious corn beef dinner EVER! The cabbage was almost like a dessert. I couldn't stop eating. Don't mess with this recipe other than maybe trying it out in a pressure cooker. But doubt it even needs that!

I make this recipe but I rinse my corned beef and then soak it over night in a sealed marinating dish in cold water to take out some of the sodium and then rinse it again before making it my family loves it and this is our favorite recipe to use.  I also don't swell up.

My 2 year old ate more of this corned beef than I did.  The apple juice/mustard/brown sugar combo gave the beef a wonderfully sweet/tangy flavor.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  Happy St. Patty's Day everyone!

I usually don't try recipes with only 3 reviews, and I was leery when I read the ingredients, but it was awesome!! I would give it more stars if I could.  I cooked it on the stove and I only had 1 - 3lb corned beef brisket, so I halved the vegetables but kept the liquid, brown sugar and mustard measurements the same.

Maybe it's just me but I don't like my dinner to taste like dessert. The corned beef was fine but I could have achieve the same results with a more basic, conventional treatment. The carrots were candied - which is OK. And the potatoes were fine - probably too dense to take on the flavors. But the cabbage was ruined. It tasted waaaay too sweet and had none of that good cabbage taste. Maybe that's a positive for those who don't like cabbage.

So next time I'll go a different route and be a bit more traditional: make the New England Corned Beef dinner I remember from my childhood. (I missed the yummy, mouth-watering smell from cooking it stove-top too. Instead I got a too sweet smell in my kitchen that lingered for hours.)

Mmmmmmmmmmmm!!  Not a big fan of "traditional" corned beef and cabbage, so this was an interesting idea to try.  I halved the recipe, changed apple cider for juice, added three cut apples, left out the onions and used the regular potatoes I had on hand vs. red.  Reading other reviews, I decided to wait 'til the last hr. to add the chopped cabbage, so it still had good taste/texture.  The sweet/salty flavor mix was wonderful, and this is how we're eating corned beef and cabbage from now on!!

Very good! The corned beef was so tender. (I cooked it on low for about 8 hrs.) The only trouble I had was trying to fit everything into my slow cooker, which is a large, oblong cooker. I had to put several potatoes, part of an onion and half of the cabbage in a pan on the stove. I used a little water and some of the juices from the slow cooker, which almost reached the top rim of the cooker by then. I simmered the extras on low for the last hour or so. I'm actually glad I had to cook most of the cabbage on the stove because the cabbage that was in the slow cooker cooked down to practically nothing. The carrots were the biggest surprise! They were so incredibly sweet, I was wishing I'd added more! Everyone enjoyed the meal very much!

Amazing. Simply amazing. I have never liked this before and loved it. My husband, who is Jewish, is a corned beef connoisseur and said it was the best he's ever had. Kept the juice and spices the same but did just one three pound corned beef and only used 7 potatoes, one onion and a half a head of cabbage. Thank you for this! ! ! !

This was by far the best corned beef I ever tasted. Only change I made was to add 1 cup of beer to make sure everything was completely covered. Outstanding!

Nice, and I will make again but it really was too sweet. I followed the suggestion by another poster and added some vinegar to the liquid and a lot more mustard but next time I will skip adding the sugar instead. I also added some bay leaves, I love bay, te seasoning packet and more mustard seeds. Lastly, I added the cabbage in the last hour only, along with some green beans and they were perfect. Then once all the veg were on a platter I poured a lemon butter sauce with parsley (melted butter, a squeeze of lemon and chopped parsley) over the whole lot--my mom's trick.  As for cook time, I did one hour at high at first, then 10.5 hrs on low. Thanks for posting!

First off, I made this recipe EXACTLY as stated, and it is great!  I didn't find it too sweet, it was actually a fun take on corned beef and cabbage.  The family loved it and I will definitely make this over and over again!  Some horseradish mustard on the side is great to give a sweet and spicy kick!

Awesome corn beef recipe! The changes that I made were to use 1 cup brown sugar (we like it sweet) and because we were out of dijon mustard I used honey mustard. It was so good, I made it again a few days later. Also, everyone that asked for the recipe said it was awesome too!

One word describes this recipe....".DELICIOUS" !!!!! The only thing I did was added buttered garlic parmesan noodles to serve underneath it, and was glad I did, it was a good touch that made it even more enjoyable than it already was. This will be my new way to cook Corned Beef from now on. :D

This was the best Corned Beef recipe ever.  Everyone in the house including 5 guys over for band practice ate this one up.  Most of them hated Corned Beef but after this they have asked that I make this every year for St Pat's day.  It's a keeper

The corned beef turned out well, however, all the yummy vegetables (especially the cabbage) was ruined by the sweet liquid.  If I make this again, I will not add any carrots, potatoes or cabbage to the mixture.

My lady friend and I both agree it was the best corned beef and cabbage dinner  we've ever had 
Had planned to get more than one meal out of it and corned beef sandwitches but it was so good we nibbled it all away . Too good to serve only once a year on St Patty's Day.

This recipe is delicious!  I've tried a handful of slow cooker recipes from allrecipes.com and they all are wonderful. I didn't change anything about this one and it was great! However, I couldn't fit much cabbage like another reviewer stated.  After eating some of the meat, I added more potatoes and cabbage the next day and they were delicious! My 16 month old daughter, husband, and I really like this one!

This review is for the meat only portion of this recipe.  We really enjoyed the taste of this meat with the 3 ingredient broth.  The apple juice gave the corned beef a wonderful flavor.  The meat was very moist and sliced nicely.  If I am pressed for time and cannot make the oven braised version of corned beef, I will definitely use this crockpot method.  Looking forward to Reuben sandwiches with the leftovers. Served this with 'Alla Checca' and 'Tomato Bruschetta' both AR recipes. Thanks tonmeilleurami, for sharing your recipe.  It is delicious!

Its been cooking on high for 5 hours & its not close to being ready! I think your crock pot must be nuclear powered. I can't wait to try it. I added a tblsp of cider vinegar, garlic, 1 bay leaf, a tsp of worcestershire sauce & I make a dipping sauce from plain yogurt mixed with horseradish. I tweak all my recipes.

Not the flavor of corned beef I've made in the past, but very good.  It is a little sweet instead of a little salty.  I may make it again, but only enough for one meal... everyone ate it and loved it, but no one wanted leftovers...  It's good, it's interesting but, since we only do corned beef once a year.. I'll probably make it again...

We made this today a day early since my husband is working on St. Patricks Day, through the evening.  It was so delicious!  We have young kids and the older two loved it but my persnickety 3-yr old wasn't that into it.  He refuses to eat a lot of things though so that is not surprising.  The flavor was nice and smooth, not too overbearing, and the potatoes and carrots were also very delicious.  I will definitely be making this one again!

I've always gone to this recipe for corned beef. I've only ever made it in the crock pot though, and there wasn't any room for the vegetables and the meat wouldn't be completely covered. Now, I've tried this in a stock pot on the stove (40 min per lb) and doubled the broth ingredients. This was the best it ever came out, absolutely delicious and moist. I will never go back to the crock pot.

This recipe was okay, but not as good as everyone else raved about it.  The flavor of the apple is only tasted in the outside edge of the beef.  And in the potatoes.  It was tender, but any liquid in the slow cooker would do that.  I wouldn't spend the money to buy apple juice (which I don't usually have on hand) to make this again.

I feel so bad leaving this review but....  the apple juice/brown sugar just overpowered the cabbage and corned beef.  If it had sweetened it a bit, that would have been acceptable, but was just way too much for me.  Maybe I was hoping too much for a more traditional corned beef/cabbage dish.  Sorry.

Decided to make this for St. Patrick's Day even though I have never made a corned beef brisket before and this was delicious!  I must have a small slow cooker because there was no room for the cabbage. I used 2 2lb briskets and there was plenty of liquid so no need to add more. Meat was tender and although I was concerned about how sweet it was going to turn out it, it was perfect! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I wasn't able to incorporate the cabbage.  Will make this again hopefully before next St Patricks Day!

Liked the basic recipe and then found it easy to adapt. I sometimes switch a bottle of medium dry cider for the apple juice which works really well if some of your guests do not like their meals as sweet as the standard recipe.

What a delicious, fun and easy recipe for St. Patrick's Day!  I used one 3# corned beef and the published amounts of juice/mustard/sugar.  I also added a heaping tablespoon of garlic and some cracked black pepper.  I just eyeballed about half of the veggies and threw in there.  I let this go 12 hours on low (yep, long day at work!), and this was moist and delicious.  Hubs RAVED over this!  Thanks for sharing your twist on corned beef with AR, this was fabulous.

I used this recipe for a St. Patrick's Day feast at our church, and everyone loved it!  Our Pastor is Irish, and he gave a two thumbs up!  Said it was absolutely delicious, which it is.  I will never fix Corned Beef any other way.  All the veggies were very tasty as well.

This was totally delicious.  My mother is not a big fan of corned beef but even she liked it, said it was the best she's ever had.  I did not make two 3 lb. corned beefs, instead I got a 4 lb. corned beef and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  It was fantastic, not too sweet at all.  I'll be using this one again!

The kids were begging me to cook anything but corned beef.  One girl had seconds and one had thirds! I will never go back to water, moist and delicious. Used baby gold potatoes with the baby red for some contrast. They ate all of the potatoes too. I think this will be a regular menu item at my house!

Fantastic! After reading a few of the reviews about the sweetness, I decided to use a cider instead. This time I used Woodchuck 802 which was amazing. I halved the recipe for 1 3 lb. corned beef brisket, so I used just one bottle. Very, very good!

This is my favorite corned beef recipe.  I'm so glad I found it.  I have shared it a number of times, and everyone says it's the only way to cook it.  I never had much luck in oven or stove top. However, this is so easy and the corned beef is so flavorful and tender.

I've made it in a slow cooker, instant pot pressure cooker and on the stove top. Delicious every time. I added Yukon gold potatoes and those are my favorite. This is a keeper for me.

Really enjoyed this! Made half recipe - serving 4 people. Because veggies are sometimes not cooked through in my slow cooker, I placed them in the pot first and topped them with the corned beef (fat side up). All came out perfectly done. We served the meat with a sauce of 1/2 cup sour cream and 2 Tbsp. horseradish. Delicious!

This is AMAZING! My family loved it.  Only changes I cut back a little on juice and sugar after reading some reviews re desert etc.  Added I cup of low salt beef broth to compensate for liquid doubled the carrots Yum. I made on stove top it was not too sweet and next time will add full sweetness as original recipe calls for.  This recipe is dead on delish!!! Found my go to corned beef recipe for life! Enjoy and Thank U so much for this awesome recipe!  :)

I made this for St. Patty's Day (a day early), and my family loved it!  My husband is not wild about corned beef, but I serve it every St. Patty's Day because I'm part Irish.   He really liked this version because the brown sugar and apple juice made it a bit sweeter.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but took the suggestion of one reviewer and added beer to completely cover the vegetables in the crock pot. I used one bottle of Irish stout, and it turned out great!  The meat was very tender, and the vegetables, especially the cabbage, were super sweet!  I will definitely make again, but I am not waiting a year to do so!!

Made this for friends last weekend and everyone raved about it.

Only difference I had was that the cabbage did not fit in the slow cooker so I had to cook that separate.  Other than that, this is a keeper and the only way I will make it in the future!

What a great flavor!  My family LOVED this recipe.  The apple juice & brown sugar made the beef so flavorful!  I made this last year & searched for this recipe again.  I would never change to another recipe.

We tried this recipe at our work with a team of 8 at https://overhemden.com - although we overcooked it a little bit - I think we did a really really good job. Great recipe and not too complex. THankS!

I made this for my Dad a few years back and he couldn't stop raving about it. 
He has since passed, but this recipe is made in his honor every St. Pat's Day. 
I don't put all the veggies in the same time as the meat.  The veggies tend to get too soggy. 
My family loves how the meat is cooked in apple juice but the veggies are cooked on the side with the exception of a few large chunked carrots for those who like them sweet.  

very very good!  Thanks for the recipe

We use sweet potatoes instead of the red potatoes. We have done both red potatoes and sweet potatoes or regular potatoes and sweet potatoes... and no carrots

We also add a little bit of horseradish in it to give it a lil kick

This was my very first recipe that I tried since subscribing to All Recipes.  It was delicious.  I am not a big fan of cabbage so I just used some gourmet small potatoes, carrots and vadalia onions and followed the recipe.  I did not find it too sweet and the brown sugar and apple juice really brought out the flavor of the corned beef.  My husband does not eat corned beef so I changed the serving size and it was perfect for me. 
I will definitely make this again.  You see I like corned beef not just on St Patricks day!!!!!

The best corned beef and cabbage!   I don't use the mustard, though.  Makes a lot; make sure you have a very large crock pot, or scale down the recipe.

It was delicious!!! I adjusted the recipe a little; instead of 4 cups apple juice I used 2 cups Apple Juice AND 2 cups Orange Juice. I added 1 Bulb Fresh Crushed Garlic And used Horseradish Mustard instead of prepared mustard. Cooked the red potatoes whole (not cut). Everything was cooked perfectly.  BEST CORNED BEEF I EVER HAD!!

This is a recipe I'd like to try again.  The first time around I didn't have cabbage.  I followed the recipe and it didn't turn out too sweet and I enjoyed the cooked apples.  The second time around I'm going to add more apples and the cabbage, which I missed having.

I made this as described with the exception of using 2 cut up sweet potatoes and baby carrots.  I only had a 2/lb corn beef but used the same amount of ingredients.  I added the cabbage  3 hrs before finishing.  It turned out great.  The corn beef was perfect.  The carrots, potato, and cabbage were flavorful.  It was sweet but not too much for me.  Would do it again but add more sweet potatoes.

It was delicious. I cut back the brown sugar to a scant 1/3 C.
I made 6# of beef thinking there would be plenty for left overs.

They licked the platter clean! There were only 4 of us.

I've made this twice for our annual St Patrick's Day party. Very easy to prep, which is a lifesaver on days when you are planning a party. My guests raved about it and there was literally not a drop of food left. Next year I'm making two! (I can't explain the taste because I didn't get any ..it was all gone before I had a min to eat ??????)

I like the traditional braised way of cooking so much better than this recipe. It took much longer to cook in the slow cooker, too. It must be the mustard & apple juice that gave the veges a strange taste. Will not cook it this way again.

Awesome flavor, the cider kills more of the salt taste and brown sugar give it a hint of sweetness.

If I make it again I would cook it longer as I like it very soft.

The only thing I changed when making this recipe was I added some minced garlic to it. The brisket was done to perfection, sliced very well across the grain. Had sandwiches the next day with a little horseradish mustard and done on rye with some melted Swiss cheese. The only reason this had 4 stars instead of 5 was because the apple juice was a bit overpowering. I think if I make it again, I will cut the juice in half and do regular water for the balance.

We made this for St Patrick's day this year and it was excellent.  I halved the recipe to accomadate my crock pot, but everything else was followed to a T.  So easy and tasty.  I did not think it was overly sweet.

I only had a small cabbage so I also added fresh kale.  This made it even more nutritious. It was every bit as good as what my mother and grandmother made, and 5 days later, it's still great!  Serve with warmed Irish Soda Bread drizzled with butter. Yum.

Fixed this on St. Patty's Day and found this to be on the sweet side. I didn't add the brown sugar only the apple juice. It was just ok. It's definitely different but I won't make again.

This was my third and final attempt at finding a corn beef and cabbage recipe that we liked. This was great!  My brisket was a little less than three pounds so I only used half of the ingredients all except the brown sugar, instead of using half, a quarter cup, I used one packed tablespoon and that was perfect. The next time I make it , I will probably leave the brown sugar out.

Loved this, the apple juice idea was brilliant. Old small crockpot, so had to cook cabbage in another pot before serving. Dumped all the crockpot fixings into my Dutch oven and finished cooking.

I made the recipe as stated.  I did not include cabbage because neither my husband nor I like it.  We found the recipe to be too sweet for our taste.  It really did not quite taste like traditional corned beef.  I will go back to my regular recipe next time.

No changes except to reduce the apple juice and add 4 ounces of a dark stout. Putting the corned beef in the oven to caramelize and finish is the best idea ever. Will definitely do again.

I made it this way for the 1st time and my family really liked it. Great flavor and not too sweet. I made 1 brisket so I pretty much halved the ingredients but I kept the mustard the same and used about 3 cups apple cider. I made "Grandpa's Soda Bread" to go with it - another hit and easy!

I made it with less beef but didn't adjust the amount of cabbage.  Needed more time than recipe indicated.  Corned beef was tasty broth was just right, bit tangy a bit sweet.  Great tasting.

I have never liked corned beef but had to make some for a church function. I used this recipe and everyone loved it, including me!

I made this today & my husband  says that this is the ONLY way I should make corned beef from now on. Only change I made was to cook it on the stove rather than the crock pot. Yum!

This recipe was awesome.  The only thing I changed and I'm glad I did was to cook the potatoes by themselves.  I don't think I would have liked my potatoes that sweet.  The next time I will cook the cabbage and potatoes together and just add the carrots to the meat.  The cabbage was a little too sweet for me.  Otherwise a great recipe that I will certainly do again.

When my husband asks for seconds(which he probably shouldn't have and doesn't need) I will rate 5 stars. This will be my St. Patrick's day recipe from now on. I followed the recipe exactly except halved it because I only had two people eating and 1 brisket. Repeating another rating, I did have trouble getting every thing in the Slow Cooker. But it worked out. Thanks for another great recipe!

We normally make a sauce of brown sugar and yellow mustard with our corned beef.  This recipe is delicious, no sauce needed!  Meat is tender and flavorful, the potatoes and cabbage were very tasty, not bland at all.  Will make again!

I did not have apple juice on hand so i substituted a jar applesauce with enough water to bring it up to 4 cups.  I worked just fine.  The recipe was very tasty.

Used this recipe for the first time. It’s very good the sweetness of the apple juice and brown sugar is nice, it toned down the seasonings a little more than I like. It is still very good this corned beef won’t last long.

I made this as per the recipe except I used one 4-pound corned beef brisket and used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of red. Cooked in slow-cooker on high for about 4 1/2 hours. Absolutely delicious! Meat was very tender and vegetables were well cooked but not mushy. I will definitely make this again.

I used apple cider, and a little more mustard and brown sugar. I transferred the carrots and potatoes to a baking sheet to roast them a bit in the oven, and added the cabbage to the cooker at this time just until the cabbage was wilted.  I made this once before and my son's loved it, so we are having it again tonight!

Great recipe, for the first time ever I tried something new on St. Patrick's Day. 
The only thing I did do differently was I let it slow cook in the stove for hours instead of a using a crockpot. The house smell was wonderful!

I made this as written here, except scaled down as I only made one 3 lb piece of corned beef.  I also made it on the stove (see small print on bottom of recipe).  It was delicious!  After cooking , I strained the broth and will use it for a beef stew later in the week.  Definitely worth making again!

This was a great recipe.  My husband who is not a big fan of corned beef and cabbage absolutely loved it.  I only had a 2lb corned beef so I cut the ingredients by a third, I didn't have any apple juice so I made my own,   I had a jar of apple sauce in my cabinet so mixed it with a cup of unsalted chicken stock and the brown sugar.  Added a tablespoon more of McCormicks pickling spices and cooked it my dutch oven on top of the stove.  Absolutely delicious!!
