This is a very nice, easy quick bread.  I used brown sugar instead of reg because I was too lazy to get the regular sugar and the brown was closer.  I also put the ingredients in backwards, I mixed the pb, sugar, egg and milk all together first, then I added the dry ingredients.  I also guess-timated the amount of peanut butter, 3 spoonfuls, I know it was close to the amound called for, just didn't want to dirty the measuring cup.  I checked my bread at 50 min and it was done, so next time I'll make sure to check it at 45min first.  I nearly ate half the loaf warm with butter and jam, I will definitely make this again.

Very easy to make.  I think it needs more peanut butter.  Definitely enjoy with a glass of milk. =)

This bread was great! It wasn't too sweet, which I liked. And didn't crumble at all! I used crunchy peanut butter, which gave the bread something extra. I will be making this again!

As written it was just ok! Didn't give me the wow factor I was hoping for. I will try again and make a few changes. I didnt have a problem with this being crumbly. My family has ate the whole loaf, just not what we expected.

I guess I had too high of hopes for this bread. It was alright, but not great. I was expecting a sweet bread, it is more of a savory bread. Although I made it sweet by spreading some Nutella on it- yum! I added more PB than called for, probably more like 1 1/4 cups. It baked for just over an hour. My husband really liked it, but he doesn't have much of a sweet tooth, unlike me :)

This is just awesome. I made it as a cake, never measure when I cook, so I don't know how much peanut butter I used.  Added chocolate chips and made a trifle, mixed with chocolate syrup. Never got dry and was just great. Will definately make again!

i made this as specified in the recipe..however, i used a 8x8 pan instead and baked for 28 min.  it turned out well, a bit crumbly, but well enjoyed by my teens.  great after school snack topped with peanut butter and jam, with a glass of milk.
