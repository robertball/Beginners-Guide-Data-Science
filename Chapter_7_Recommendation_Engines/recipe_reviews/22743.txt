This sauce is wonderful if you TEMPER the egg. Heat all of the ingredients (minus the egg) until the sugar dissolves, beat the egg in another bowl, add the hot sugar mixture while whisking. Add egg and sugar mixture back into the pan and cook just until it thickens, whisking constantly. You'll have a great, SMOOTH sauce!

I tried this and it is excellent. I had no trouble with the egg as I cooked the  sauce in a double boiler and used a whisk to stir it while cooking.

This recipe was very good.  My Kids loved it on Ice Cream.  The left overs keep well in the frig.  No lumps or egg chunks for me, I cooked it on low and took my time.

For those people with egg floating &  cooking, etc., you need to find out how to "temper" the egg. This is a process that must be done, when making certain sauces, custards, cream pies or pudding.

Delicious!  I was looking for something to put over bread pudding, and this was excellent!  I had no trouble getting it to mix and get smooth.

I used heavy cream instead of the egg and used Golden Syrup instead of Corn Syrup as I can't get it where I live. The sauce doesn't thicken till it starts to cool down so don't over cook it. Mine indeed up being too thick after it had fully cooled. Still tasted great though!

I didn't like that I had to strain the butterscotch several times, because no matter when I put the egg in or how much I beat the egg, it cooked.  It was awful to see the egg whites and yolk floating through the butter scotch.  Tablecream would have been better.

This is SO good, I love it. I let the egg sit at room temp for about 20 minutes, and used a wire whisk to blend it all together over the stove. Was very quick & easy.  Thanks for posting!!

I don't know what I did wrong, but the sauce didn't thicken up. I turned up the heat a little thinking it wasn't hot enough to thicken, and the egg started to cook. Little bits of it were floating at the top.

I heated/melted all ingredients except for the egg.  I did temper the egg before adding and cooking as suggested by others. The sauce turned out sweet and smooth and delicious over bread pudding.

I also had problems with cooked egg in the sauce and strained it out.  Next time I'll try warming the whole egg in hot tap water to temper it to see if that makes a difference.

Over the last two years I've made this at least a dozen times, or however many times I've made bread pudding at least. It's only failed once, and that was when I tried to temper the egg as a couple of other commenters suggest. I don't know why, in general they are right, but for this sauce it just doesn't work. The trick is to stir constantly, rather the the occasionally mentioned in the directions. Poured over plain old bread pudding it elevates that dish to divine.

Even with a tempered egg I got egg whites. I strained the egg bits and it still tasted lovely. However, I may try the heavy cream next time. How much cream should I put in though? I'm new to tweaking recipes.

It was so good! I wanted it to be thin to pour over a vanilla cake, so I left out the egg and put in some half n' half. Next plan for it: Butterbeer from Harry Potter. :)
