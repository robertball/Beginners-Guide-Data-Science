This is our traditional family Christmas breakfast. I can make it up the night before and put it in the oven Christmas morning while we are all opening gifts. Really good.

Made this for out of town company (12 people total) and it was a hit!  Everyone loved it.  Read reviews first, and left out green pepper.  Only thing I would do differently is stir the black pepper in with the sausage mixture instead of the liquid mixture so that it doesn't tend to clump.

I always play around with this receipe and just add what I have in the kitchen- i find this receipe is a bit better if you mix in a small amount of sour cream.  Keeps it more moist.

Great recipe, but I had to be creative with the ingredients! I used bacon, cooked but not crispy. I had no frozen hash browns so I boiled some potatoes till still slightly hard and cut into small cubes, and used low-fat mozzarella instead of chedder. It still turned out super yummy!

Have made this several times, making changes as I go.  First time did just as written and it was too cake like.  Next time, cut making mix in half and add extra egg...better.  last time, still halved baking mix and extra 2 egg and mixed half remaining cheese with egg mixture, sat overnight, added remaining cheese last few minutes to brown.... PERFECT!

I made this for Christmas brunch this year and it was a hit. I did leave out the green peppers just to appease kids and adults both, but I think it would be good with them also. The sausage and onions were cooked the night before to save time. Put the rest together in the morning, baked and took it to the in-laws. It was great and so easy.

I made this for after church and everyone loved it. However, it came out too brown on the top and bottom and at first I suspected the oven was too hot.  Today I checked with an oven thermometer (our church kitchen has a huge, expensive, almost-brand-new, industrial, expensive, stainless steel range/oven--and did I mention expensive?) but it was on point.  Next time I would check it after 25-30 minutes.  It wasn't overdone to the point of being burned, but it definitely was in too long.  I used a 13x9" glass baking dish; maybe I should have turned the oven down 25 degrees like you're supposed to do when baking a cake in a glass dish.  I assembled it the night before and baked it at church during the service.  The only modifications I made were to omit the bell pepper, which I abhor, and instead of putting cheese on the top I just put the extra inside the casserole.  It was very good!

My family just loved this! EASY! I did find a way to make it even easier!  I used bacon instead of sausage, and to save time, I used the quick microwave bacon, just crumbled it up in hte recipe,, Worked great. Family ooohed and ahhed at almost every bite.

This was really good. I fried the sausage and cut up russet potatoes in a cast iron skillet(deep one). Then I put the cheese on top and poured the batter on top of that in the skillet, and put that in the oven. One pan.

I tried this and will be making it for "make ahead" brunch while entertaining company.  I agree with another reviewer, instead of using frozen potatoes or tater tots, it's a bit more sophisticated with real potatoes.  I finely and evenly chopped a couple cups of baby potatoes and pan cooked with butter and dried Italian seasoning.  I did a side by side comparison in my pan. An extra step, but worth it.  I also let it sit in the frig for a few hours to come together.  A great dish to make the night before!  I added yellow peppers...could use any veg you have I would imagine.  I loaded it with shredded cheddar for flavor.  Not low cal, but will be a crowd pleaser.

I made this with gluten free Bisguick using 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup.  It came out delicious.  My entire family enjoyed it, even those without wheat allergies. JudyC

I have made this many times and different every time it's so versatile but our favorite is adding salsa to the top and then the cheese for that last few minutes of baking time  and then a dollop of sour cream on top after it has cooled a few minutes. Tonight it's Bratwursts instead of sausage.

I make this often when I have a bunch of house guests. You can make it the night before. Depending on who I'm feeding determines if I use hot or regular sausage. Sometimes I amp it up with a dash of chili pepper flakes. I also use ex large or jumbo eggs. Thanks for sharing.

I've made quite a few breakfast bakes over the years and this was my favourite by far!  We used a pound of bacon (because it's what we had on hand) and added a few extra veggies and it was delicious. Definitely going to make this again.

Asked hubby what he thought of this recipe.  He said, and I quote, "Loved it!"  I didn't change a thing from the original recipe.  I plan to make two pans of this for Easter brunch for my family.

Very tasty and filling.I used bison sausages and homemade bisquick recipe and I had some roasted greek potatoes leftover from our dinner party so I coarsly grated them instead of using hashbrowns. Great for breakfast for dinner on those crazy week nights.Thanks for sharing!

I made this one morning for our family of 12 during our recent reunion.  Everyone loved it!  The only thing I did differently was to use turkey sausage and frozen O'Brien Potatoes that included onion and peppers.  It was a big hit!

This casserole was good but quiet dry for my taste.  I feel like it definitely needed more cheese.  I would probably use an extra cup next time.  It may have needed a stick of butter or something too.

I was looking for a breakfast casserole for a family gathering. This was exactly what I was looking for. I did take the suggestion of less Bisquick and used 1/4 c and added 2 extra eggs ( total of 6). Otherwise was exactly like recipe. Turned out wonderful. The family all but licked the pan. Will make again for family and church gatherings in the future! Highly recommend!

Cooked the sausage mixture the night before and finished preparing the casserole the next morning.  Substituted red pepper and added green onions to add Christmas color.  Added seasonings to sausage, including basil, after it was cooked.  Used whole milk and turkey breakfast sausage. The flavor of the casserole comes from the sausage so it's important to use a good quality. (Our farmers market has the best turkey breakfast sausage!)  Next time I'll add also add chopped spinach.

I served this recipe at a brunch, and it was a hit. I added uncooked baby spinach (I cut the spinach leaves into smaller pieces first) when I mixed the cooked sausage, pepper,  onion, and cheese just to give it some greens. I prepared the entire casserole a few hours ahead of time and placed it in the refrigerator.  That gave me time to clean the kitchen before my guests arrived. About 30 minutes before cooking it, I took it out of the frig to bring it closer to room temperature before cooking. It was simple and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe. I will make this again.

Was so easy and delicious.  The only change I made was from the other reviews which was adding sour cream and did half sausage and added bacon. My husband loved it!

I used pre-cooked chicken apple sausage patties and just diced them up and threw all the ingredients in a bowl to mix.  I also used 1 lb of refrigerated hash browns and a 1 lb of mixed cheddar cheese.  My fiance said this was one of the best things I've made.  I will definitely make this again!

Made this for everyone before we went to the Indianapolis 500, it was a hit! I think next time I'll try it with bacon instead of sausauge. (Personal preference!)

I made this 2 x's and my family loves it!  I used a red pepper instead of green and whatever meat I have in the fridge: Italian chicken sausage, turkey bacon.  After reading the reviews I took the advice of another member and used 2 additional eggs.  I also added 1 1/2 c. of Bisquick.  This is definitely a keeper.  Delicious!!

I have made this 6 or 7 times as is, and several times with whatever meat and veggies I have in the fridge. Today I made it with broccoli, mushrooms, onions, bacon and a Mexican blend of shredded cheese. It is my “go to” recipe for a breakfast casserole. I make it for family gatherings and at least 3 times a month so my husband has something good for his first break at work. Better than donuts or coffee cake, that’s for sure!

This casserole was really good.  Needed salt so next time I will add about a teaspoon to the egg mixture.  I will also try adding bacon next time I make it.  I have celiacs so finding this recipe made my day.

This was a big hit on Christmas morning. There were left overs from a group of 7. The modifications in previous reviews were helpful. I made a few changes myself; I left out the pepper, added rosemary, thyme and oregano with the sausage, added 3/4 cup sour cream to the milk mixture and 1/2 lb. of bacon to the casserole. Next time I’ll add 2 more eggs. Delicious!

My family LOVES this recipe! I have been making this for a couple years now, and it is the only breakfast casserole I will make.   The only thing I do different is use 1 lb sausage and 1 lb freshly crumbled bacon because we LOVE bacon!  Other than that I follow it to a T and its amazing!

This has been a family holiday favorite for many
years. So easy and always delicious. I go by original
recipe using spicy ground sausage. Do have a question.
Would like to do this in large muffin size for a baby shower
brunch. Has anyone ever used muffin pan for baking this and how did it turn out.? Sure I will need to decrease time.

My usual recipe for breakfast casserole is strata made with torn up bread--and I like this better.   Also it is easier with the frozen hash browns than cutting up all that bread.  I used 1 lb of sausage (instead of 2)  and it was still good for us.  I may try adding even more eggs next time, but as is giving it a 5 star.  Cooking time of 40 minutes + 5 minutes was spot on.  Looking forward to trying it with ham instead of sausage.

I was really pleased with the way it turned out. I used 2 pounds of loose sausage from a local meat market rather than packages from a grocery store, but other than that I didn't change anything. I would definitely make this again sometime.

I made this for dinner tonight and we all absolutely loved it. I try not to alter or omit the ingredients when I first try something but, I did not have bell pepper or Bisquick. So, I improvised and mixed up some Bisquick, recipe on this site, as well as adding a small can of green chilies to the sausage and onion mixture. This was wonderful and I will be making this often. Thank you for sharing!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I halved the recipe and put it in greased mini bundt pans. The only changes I made was smoked swiss in place of the cheddar, added chopped mushrooms,and 1 tsp of sage (2 tsp for whole recipe). I baked it at 375° for 45 minutes.  Very tasty, even better after the flavors have a chance to blend. Versatile too!

Question: I would like to make this without the sausage. If I add a cup of sliced mushrooms, one more egg, and about 2T more red peppers and bisquick, will that work?  Thanks.

Made this for New Years' Day for the whole family - We had 14 people (including kids) stay over and this was a huge hit.  Super easy.  I cooked the meats in advance, then just put it together and in the oven in the morning.  I didn't even bother with the onion or green pepper because we have  some picky eaters.  This will be an annual tradition.

We had this for Christmas morning breakfast and everyone LOVED it.  It also reheats well.  To speed up the process on this busy day, I had browned the sausage with the onion the day before.  I also used hash browns with peppers and onion added because I wanted the extra veggies.
Next time my boys asked me to make it with spicy sausage as they love foods with a kick.

I love this recipe! It's fantastic as is but it's also great to adjust the ingredients if needed. I also found that I didn't need to cook it quite as long as the recipe suggests.

This is an easy casserole that you can have for any meal,  love having the leftovers for dinner.  Want to add a little kick,  add hot sauce of your choice.
