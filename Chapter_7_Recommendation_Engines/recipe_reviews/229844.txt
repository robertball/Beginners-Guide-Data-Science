I made squares like this before, The problem i had if you want to call it that is, the bottom crust gets very hard, once you pack it in the bottom and place it in the oven, the recipe says to keep it in there for 10 minutes, i put it in just for 8 minutes and the crust was soft, i find it gets too hard because it bakes twice, also just to make the crust tastier I added 1/2 cup of shredded coconut, I am a fanatic for coconut, so the extra makes it taste that much better!

Made these today but did not have corn syrup or baking powder.  Instead I added an extra egg, little more flour and used organic maple syrup.  Turned out awesome.

I made this for a Wednesday Night dinner and everyone loved it.  Someone said it reminded them of a pecan pie.

I will make this again. Everyone loved it. It's like someone took a pecan pie and mixed it with banana bread. I did make some adjustments because I didn't have some ingredients. I used honey instead of corn syrup. I used half the butter, and substituted with coconut milk (the canned kind). I accidentally doubled the brown sugar for the crust, no problems. I added coconut (shredded) to the crust bc why pack up what's left in the bag? Throw it in! I also did a gluten free version with coconut flour. The crust of that one I added a whole can of coconut milk to help moisten it. Then let the topping sit on it for a half hour before I baked it. Again, came out great. It seems no way to mess this up.

Tasty but bottom layer too dry and crumbly - I made it exactly as directed but will try next time to not bake the bottom layer ahead of time like the recipe suggested, but instead just bake the whole pan together as one.

These were real easy to make and taste a lot like a butter tart.  We all loved them.

The crust turned out perfectly. 4 not 5 stars only because I felt it tasted a bit bland.

This is a very good recipe. I used soda water instead of beer. I used enough of the soda water so that the consistency of my batter was good for dipping. I love it with the coconut but for those who did not like coconut, I used seasoned panko bread crumbs instead.

Delicious! Made as directed with the exception of the corn syrup. Does anyone still voluntarily eat that any more? Used honey instead. SUPER SWEET but very yummy. Favorite adaptation to date... added 1/2 cup of oatmeal to the crust and omitted the brown sugar from the topping. Exceptional

This was very good after it cooled completely. If you try to dig into it before cooled, it is a melted mess. I followed the recipe except put extra coconut in the crust. Once cooled, it tastes similar to pecan pie, very good!

Great recipe! It was a big hit with my colleagues at work. I used parchment paper so the cooking times were extended by a few minutes. Sure makes it easier to get out of the pan, though!
