This stew is very good! I did make some changes based on the reviews: Here is what I did. in a bag I put 1/4 cup flour, teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder. 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Put the stew meat in, and shook it up baby! Then I cooked it up in my ( cast iron ) dutch oven and seared in those flavors. This really put some great flavor on that meat and the yummy bits stuck to the bottom of the cast iron pan easily came off during the deglazing with the liquids. I didn't cut back on any liquids..actually you will probably want to add more towards the middle-end of the cooking time. I used 1/2 cup of red wine during the deglazing with the other liquids. I thought it needed more vegetables since I made this recipe 2 weeks ago staying true to the recipe..but this time when I did it, I added an extra ( 1 more carrot, celery, potato ) I added 1/2 of an extra onion. I also took the advise of another reviewer and added 1 tblspn each of ketchup, A-1 sauce, and wistersire sauce that really gave it some full-bodied flavor...Wow!!
Served it up to my family with some home made southern style buttermilk biscuits...mmm, mmm, good delicious!! As my Dad also said.."There ought to be a law against cooking this good!"

This stew was excellent!!!! The flavor was so good and the meat was so tender. I followed the recipe except for a few things. I added a 1/2 cup of red wine in place of a 1/2 cup of water as another person suggested. I seasond my meat with pepper and garlic powder before I browned it. And I trippled the amount of cornstarch as other people suggested to make it thicker.  One thing I did do that I wish I hadn't was add salt. The beef bouillon gives it plenty, so I recomend not adding any extra at all. I also stopped cooking it at least ten min. early because the meat was already as tender as could be.

BEST beef stew I've ever made!  I added 3 tsp ground black pepper, 2 tsp garlic powder to the flour mixture before browning the beef.  I followed the recipe exactly as directed, except I used powdered beef base instead of the cubes and also one jumbo red chopped onion.  Also, I made 5 times the cornstarch mixture as I prefer a thicker gravy.  As a result, I had to add some salt as there wasn't as much salt in the powdered beef base.  Also, if you add the 3 tsp of pepper to the beef before browning, watch how much pepper you put into the stew.  Mine has a bit too much kick as a result but it's still excellent!  Also, if you use red potatoes and not russet ones, your potatoes won't turn into mush no matter how long you cook them.  I learned this from Alton Brown's show, "Good Eats".  Russet potatoes will dissolve into mush unless you throw them in at the last minute.  I cooked my red and yellow golden potatoes for over an hour in this stew and they didn't change shape.  BEST STEW RECIPE ON THIS SITE!

I have to say that in my 30+ years of cooking I have never tasted a stew quite like this one.  I did not use the Bouillon cubes as it called for as they tend to be to salty.  I go for a less expensive way and get the 48 oz. can of Beef broth.  I had 3 lbs. of beef stew chunks and followed the recipe almost exactly.  I added more pepper for flavoring as we like it flavorful.  I also added the salt just to taste so it would not be too salty.  We have ours over rice.  The beef was juicy and tender. I have made beef stew for over 15 years and it has never came out this good for me before.  I was also surprised to find that when the cornstarch was added to the cool water it dissolved completely.  I will use this trick from now on with any recipes requiring cornstarch.  Thanks for such a great recipe Paula!  A MUST TRY FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES HEARTY MEALS!!!!!  I will definitely be making this one again.

The BEST stew (made from scratch & not leftover pot roast) that I have ever had.  We ate it over the whole weekend -- first in the Italian Bread Bowls from this site & then in regular bowls with the leftover bread from the insides of the bowls used for dipping.  I used the suggestion of substituting a sweet potato in place of one regular potato -- as it cooked I smashed it into the sides of the pot to help thicken the stew.  The only other change I made was using about 5 times the amount of cornstarch -- we like our stew very thick.  The rosemary definitely makes the flavor of this stew, & I don't normally cook with rosemary.  We all loved it in this meal, though, & I won't change a thing next time I make it!

The ingredients didn't sound terribly exciting, and I was expecting a rather flat tasting stew, but wow! The first bite/slurp surprised me as being incredibly savory, even without large amounts of salt. I did add garlic to the meat as I browned it, and I added a bit of oregano, but otherwise I followed the recipe. I will definitely make this one again!

This was such a wonderful recipe! I have tried beef stew in the crock pot, but the meat just didn't come out tender enough.  In this recipe the meat was melt in your mouth delicious! I added pearl onions which was just a nice other vegetable to throw in.  I think you have found the secret to a great beef stew!!

Great recipe and good to freeze.  I made changes based on other reviewers comments and my own tastes...I used 3lbs beef (my hubbie wanted more meat). Used 2 cans of beef broth over bouillon. Used 3 tbl starch/water.  Coated the meat in a mixture of 7tbl flour, 2tsp garlic powder and 3tsp pepper.  I omitted the celery and added 1 can peas and 1 can corn at the very end. Delicious.

I thought this stew was wonderful.  I noticed that some of reviewers are saying that the stew isn’t too flavorful.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added wine instead of water.  I decided to use all white wine but then I only had 1 ½ cups so I added ¼ cup of red wine.  I used the additional ¼ cup to melt the bouillon cubes in.  I also added a little more cornstarch to make the stew a little thicker.  I thought the stew had a fantastic flavor and it was very easy to make.  I will definitely make this stew again!

I made this last night for my husband and myself.  We both loved it!  I added extra cornstarch (2 or 3 times as much), as well as green beans, corn and italian diced tomatoes all of which came from the can.  It turned out excellent.  The meat was very tender!  Served with cornbread.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this recipe a half dozen times over the past several months, sometimes with beef and sometimes with lamb. I love it. I recommend that you double up on the rosemary, parsley and pepper. I use 2T of cornstarch to thicken. Also, I prefer canned beef broth rather than bouillon cubes, but that's much less salty than the cubes, so if you do that you'll need to add salt (try 2t to start). And remember too that simmer is NOT the same as boil!

For beef I use chuck steaks and for lamb I like shoulder chops. Its important, I think, that you process the bones right along with the meat. They add a lot of flavor and texture. Cut the meat from the bones, cube it, and brown and cook both together. You can remove the bones prior to serving or, if no one's looking, you can do what I do and chew on 'em. :)

OH MY GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   so freaking good  never made a beef stew before and i dont normally eat it. i will make this very often takes 2 hours to make but it does not need much attention at all got to catch up on my dvr in that time. i followed some advice and did the baggie with flower, onion, and a garlic and onion mix i bought at home goods chucked the meat in and "shook it baby" that phrase made me laugh. we wanted more juice so we did 2 cans beef broth and 1 can vegatable chucked some wine in there and was set. we only had regular potatoes but they came out fabulous i think the rosemarry was awesome in this gave lots of flavor. am very impressed was put off at first by cooking time but this is great for a lazy cook like me. five stars  whooooooooooo!

This is the second recipe I’ve tried from this website and it is awesome! I love the flavor the rosemary gives to it. I did tweak it a bit by adding more beef boullion, adding red wine, more cornstarch and omitting the celery. It took me awhile to get the vegetables to cook just right. The first time the potatoes got mushy so I tried to reduce the cook time but then the carrots and onions were undercooked. So I now I add them in stages. I buy a big top round sirloin and cut it up instead of getting the precut stew meat. The butcher said pre-cubed meat comes from the chest and tends to be tougher. The top round sirloin is cheaper, too!

I didn't like this recipe at all.  Maybe I'm just not a stew eater, but I thought the gravy was too thin and the seasonings weren't hearty enough to bring out the flavor of the meats and vegetables.  Celery in stew doesn't thrill me either.

This stew is very good! I did make some changes based on the reviews: Here is what I did. in a bag I mixed flour, garlic powder, garlic pepper, onion powder and roast rub. Put the stew meat in and shook up. I browned the meat until about half cooked. I used a can of beef broth vs the bouillon and water. I also took the advise of another reviewer and added a few shakes of worshire sauce adn a good shake of A-1 steak sauce. I also added a pinch of Fennel...a staple ino our house. Yummy!!  I only made a half batch.. and cooked for about 45/50 mintes each round for a total of 1hr 45min.

Yum!  We loved this!  I made it in my cast iron skillet and I, like many others, shook up the meat in flour, salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder before browning. I added a bay leaf and some thyme.  I also made dumplings by cutting up some refridgerated biscuit dough into quarters and dropped them in the last 20 minutes, covered tightly.  Very comforting:)

Awesome recipe! Made many times now. Family loves it!   Used red potatoes so they don't turn to mush if cooked too long also used arrowroot instead of corn starch and used "better then bouillon" beef base from health food store as it contains no msg...otherwise followed recipe!  Once I decided to cook onions with meat instead of adding later....big mistake... took longer then normal to get beef tender.

Great stew recipe! I coated the beef cubes in flour seasoned  with a bit of each of these: salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper and paprika before browning. Then let the beef, water, boullion and seasonings cook in the crock pot for an hour before adding the veggies (I sauteed the onions before putting them in). Also increased the cornstarch to 4 tsps. Let it simmer in the crock pot for the rest of the day and it was delicious.

I added 1 Tablespoon each of Ketchup, Steak Sauce (A1), and Worcestershire Sauce. Also used Red potatoes instead of Russets, to avoid mushy potatoes. I used "Better than Bullion" brand beef bullion (it's semi-liquid) and did add a good bit of cornstarch (mixed with a bit of COLD water!) at the end to thicken it up. This was the best beef stew I've ever tasted, ANYWHERE!  I'm holding onto this one. =)

Instead of chopped onion, I added a defrosted 1 lb bag of frozen pearl onions.  I had some baby portobello mushrooms in the fridge, so they were sauteed along with the pearl onions and added to the stew toward the end of the cooking time, along with 3 cloves of chopped garlic.  My pkg of stew beef was 3 lbs, so I increased everything accordingly, except for the water (only 5 cups total).  I did dredge the stew chunks in some flour when browning.  I'm pleased with the way this turned out. UPDATE 11/4/11  I forgot to mention that after I browned the meat, I finished this stew in the crock pot, 5 hours on high.

Excellent stew.  Based on other reviews I also coated the beef in flour, garlic powder, pepper and paprika before browning.  I used beef broth and increased amount of vegetables.

Lots of room to play. Used beef broth instead of the boullion. Will have to try it with lamb for sure! Added Bobby's recommendations of corn and green beans which came out nice. Would've liked some mushrooms and possibly red beans as well... but that might be too much. We'll see what happens.

This stew was really good;) Im so happy I picked this one. I did introduce a few changes, since I live in Egypt and sometimes I cant find certain spices I try to replace them with what I have. I added thyme, a bit of curry, onion powder, meat spices, bay leaves and ketchup. It was so rich in flavor;) yummy;)

This came out great...I did customize it...used a pound of beef and more fresh carrots plus I threw in a can of green beans and a can of corn a few minutes before serving.  I always coat my beef in a mixture of flour, a pinch of salt, and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Also, I used a product called: Better than Boullion, more convenient than the hard cubes...I, like some of the others, like a thick stew so I added 2T. more cornstarch.  Rosemary is one of my favorite spices, but next time I will decrease it.   I added a bay leaf as one reviewer suggested, great flavor addition...One suggestion: cut carrots very thin, same with celery and potatoes..or else pre cook as another person recommended...First time I made this and cut the carrots in 1 inch chunks as directed, they were hard after 2 hours of cooking.  I used six cups of broth as I add lots of veggies.  Served with cheesey biscuits once and with a pesto french bread several times...very hearty.

believe me when i tell you this is a basic stew receipe at best unless it is doctored up. to start i mixed 3 Tbl spoons of all purpose flower with 1/2 tsp of pepper, seasoning salt, garlic powder, paprika, and onion powder to i coat the meat before browning it in the oil. in the pot i used 4 cubes of bouillon and 1 more cup of water(you can thicken with the flower mixture that didnt coat the meat if you like). in the spices for the broth i added 1/2 tsp of thyme, and 2 bay leaves. finally i added 1 cup of frozen peas, and corn. i never use corn starch to thicken anything, flower with some added spices is much better.

It's pretty good.  I recommend using stewing meat with a bit more fat... It's a bit more tender.  Lean pieces of meat comes out a bit dry.

My quest for the 'right' beef stew probably ends here. I had a certain taste in mind that definitely excluded tomatoes, plus I wanted it to be just a little sweet. I followed the recipe and  added a little red wine, a shake of thyme, barely a tablespoon of brown sugar, and some grated corn from two frozen ears. Also having peeled two really large potatoes, I decided to leave a fourth of one to mince finely to add as soup thickener at the end, and it actually worked. In fact, it was superb! This is undoubtedly the best beef stew we ever had and my husband and daughters agree! Thanks, Paula, for sharing.

The best stew recipe yet!  I did make some changes from the reviews.  First I sprinkled garlic powder and pepper on the meat then sprinkled with flour then I browned the meat.  I substituted 1c water with 1c red wine.  I also added one bay leaf.  Like most people, I had to add a lot of cornstarch for a thicker gravy.  I guess it just depends on how you like it. The meat was so juicy and tender I could cut it with my spoon.  I also made sure that all the meat were all about equal size so they would cook evenly.  Don't know if that worked but the meat was sooo good.  The cooking time was also right on for me.  Veggies were perfect.  My fiance had two helpings as did I. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.  I now have my Beef Stew recipe I was looking for.  Thanks.

Delicious stew with Chuck's suggestions of coating the meat first and adding ketchup, A1 steak sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. However, and this is why I rated this recipe 4 stars, the cubed potatoes and 1 inch pieces of carrots and celery weren't tender even after 3 hours on the stove. Not including the prep work, the cook time, itself, took 4 1/2 hours. Next time (yes, I plan to keep this recipe), I'll dice the potatoes, slice the carrots, and chop the celery. I'll also add corn and peas. Still, a very good stew!

Tasted great, and so easy, there was little to do but wait for the cooking time to finish.  It was a little soupy though, even though I added extra cornstarch and took the cover off at the end of cooking.  Next time I will try adding even more cornstarch or maybe a bit less water.

I made this last night and my family loved it. The meat was sooo tender. Instead of 2 lbs stew meat I used 1 lb of stew meat and 1 lb of extra lean ground beef.  I also doubled the cornstarch.  It was a little too runny and soup-like even though I doubled the cornstarch.  Next time I make it I will add even more.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this stew. I tweaked the recipe a little bit. First of all, I cut it in half, because it's just the two of us. Instead of water and bouillon, I used a carton of beef stock. I also seasoned the meat while it was searing, with salt and pepper. Instead of fresh vegetables, I used a bag of frozen stew vegetables (potatoes, pearl onions, carrots and celery) and cut back on the cooking time by about 20 minutes overall. The meat still turned out nice and tender, the veggies were a bit overcooked so I might wait longer to add them next time if I use frozen again. I also increased the amount of cornstarch - and glad I did too. Even though I halved the recipe, I used 1 Tbsp cornstarch mixed with 1 Tbsp water. The consistency of the gravy came out perfect. I also added about 1 tsp of gravy master and a bit more salt to taste once it was finished cooking. Delicious - would definitely make this again!

Great Stuff! Very much like my grandmother's recipe, though she's been known to just peel her carrots and potatoes then slice them in half and throw everything in the pot that way! I love stew done like that but it takes awhile to cook! But this was much quicker--even with all the chopping! I followed the concept of this recipe. Same ingredients same steps, but like so many I modified it to suit personal taste. Basically I reduced the meat (I only had less than a pound in the freezer)and I dredged it in flour mixed with onion powder before browning.  I upped the carrots and potatoes, but not the celery or onion. I reduced both of these by half. I used italian seasoning instead of rosemary (all out!), but kept the parsley and pepper. I used all four boullion cubes and about six cups of water. (I think this kept the salty boullion from overpowering everything and was necessary after I upped the veggies. I ended up having more like 12 servings than 10.) And lastly I combined flour and some more water into an old pickle jar and gave it a few good shakes until it was blended and used this as my thickening. I paired the stew with the Double Quick Dinner Rolls from this site and I had to stop teenage boys from licking the laddle!

I only gave it four stars since I made it one time and it was too bland.  This second time,  I used beef broth and added two small cans of V8.  The V8 gives it a little extra flavor along with a cup of wine, a tbl spoon of "Dales" steak sauce, two bay leaves, a little cayenne pepper and a little fresh ginger.

I didn't like this dish at all.  After adding the corn starch and letting it simmer, it was still too watery.  I added 1/3 of a bag of egg noodles which definitely helped thicken it up.  However, I felt that it was too soft and mushy (the potatoes completely fell apart) and lacked flavor.

I used someone else's recommendation to coat the beef in 1/4 cup of flour, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and 1/2 teaspoon ground pepper. I also use 1/2 a cup of red wine in place of some of the water. I added another carrot, potato, celery and used a whole onion. Yum yum.

The rosemary is a bad flavor for this stew. I think it would have been good if not for that. It's just a weird flavor and an even weirder smell. Not good.

I also do the flour, granulated (very strong) garlic, cracked pepper dredge. Throw your meat into this mixture & you won't need the cornstarch step. Even after adding 2 T fresh garlic & 2 bayleaves to step #2 I still find this recipe bland. My husband & kids loved it. The meat was very tender. I don't like celery so threw in a can of drained sweet corn.

Family loved this one! I didn't have celery and had 3lbs of meat instead of 2.  I added peas at the end and took the suggestions of some reviewers by adding 1 cup of wine, red potatoes, seasoned the meat with garlic & onion powder and pepper and then sautéed it after dusting in flour.  I also used baby carrots, sliced in half. I made this with homemade biscuits and my husband and daughter polished off the leftovers a day later. Definitely a keeper!

I've made this recipe several times now, and while the basic recipe is very good, I have always longed for a thicker and richer beef stew and have tweaked it a little every time to achieve that. I nailed it tonight! 
I have to admit that I went overboard on preparation, so this may not be for everyone. Also, I don't think that the original will yield 10 servings - When I make it, I serve four 1.5 cup bowls for adults and a .5 cup serving for the toddler, with perhaps one adult serving left over.
What I did:
I split the stew meat, did half per the directions and splashed olive oil,liberal amounts of kosher salt, extra fresh ground pepper and a little smoke flavoring on the other half (made of the larger pieces of stew meat) and grilled it instead of browning it. Then I cut those larger grilled pieces up to mix them back in with the other pieces and then followed the boiling and simmering instructions.
At the end of the simmer I transferred everything to the slow cooker and added 2 cups more beef broth and slow cooked for 6 hours. At the end, the cornstarch wasn't gelling the liquid enough, despite doubling, so I sifted a 1/4 cup of flour in and stirred it up to make the thick gravy. Nothing else changed. Absolutely what I was looking for!  Smoky slow cooked beef melts in your mouth with a thick gravy for dunking your homemade rolls or biscuits. Stellar.

My husband said this was the best beef stew he's has in his life. I was concerned for awhile, but it was the BOMB!  I made a few adjustments: browned the beef shaken in a bag with flour and garlic pepper, used organic garlic broth, and added 3 tbps of butter and 3 tbsp of flour before adding the veggies instead of using yucky cornstarch. I also added an extra half cup of broth, an extra carrot, half potato and stalk of celery. I used a bay leaf instead of rosemary because I don't like my food tasting like Christmas trees. Would totally make this again!

I made this tonight following "Chuck's" alterations and flouring/seasoning the meat first, plus adding extra veggies with the exception of onion, which my husband dislikes. It gets 5 stars for a truly tasty, and truly EASY beef stew! Fantastic! The one thing I would note for the future is that the recipe as written comes out too dry - I needed to more than double the amount of beef stock. But that wasn't a problem, and the recipe is absolutely a keeper. Thank you!

This was very good and easy to prepare, It'll become a regular meal for us! I followed the directions as stated. Not sure how much to brown the meat I only browned the outside of the pieces for a few minutes, there was still alittle pink remaining. It came out very tender-perfect. I first served the stew IN homemade Italian bread bowls (recipe from this site) that I had made at the same time and it just seemed "blah"- sort of tasteless. But the second day we ate the stew and pieces of the bread separately, both items were very good.  I give it 4 stars because it was a bit more flavorful as a "leftover". I'd like to add that the 2 tsp. of cornstarch does pretty much nothing to thicken it so if you want a thicker soup better increase that part quite abit. UPDATE: I've made this 5 times now (it's simmering as we speak) today I added about 1-1/2 tbsp. of the cornstarch, it's alittle thicker but I may also take the lid off the last 20 min. or so as the author suggests. We raise sheep so I'll be trying this eventually with lamb! Very easy go-to recipe. Too I want to say that to keep costs down and increase the healthiness of this- you could easily use just 1/2 lb. of stew meat rather than the 2 lbs. stated in the recipe. In my opinion that is WAY too much (esp. at $5 a pound!) and I do love meat. Tonight I made it with 1 lb. of meat which was plenty. I do cut up the stew meat into smaller pieces, so the meat does seem pretty plentiful.

This was so good.  The rosemary is a lovely addition.  I browned my beef in a little bacon grease instead of oil and then added several glugs of red wine and let the alcohol cook off before proceeding with the recipe.  My family really went crazy over this.  Thanks for sharing it, Paula!

This recipe is so good and delicious. My husband who is Irish and had many stew going up, he said this is the best stew he had so far. The only thing I did different from the recipe is, like the others,  seasoned the meat with garlic powder and pepper before I browned it. I will definately make this stew again.

Made this for dinner and the husband said it was the best beef stew ever!  I did make a couple adjustments.  Added salt, pepper, garlic powder, to meat before browning and coated with flour.  Also added some red wine, a bay leaf and skipped the corn starch. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was fantastic - I added red wine, Worcestershire sauce, garlic and more cornstarch, as we like our stews thick.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This turned out to the best stew, I've ever made. I timed the recipe by 4(was feeding a fairly large crowd) and still had plenty leftover. I served it with drop cheese biscuits to dunk, oh boy was it delicious. Everyone loved it!!

VERY good recipe. I did make a few changes: 

At Meat browning:
Coat meat with flour, pepper, and garlic salt. I put one clove of garlic in the warming oil.

At first simmer:
Substituted half the water for equal amount of beer. I used Alaskan Amber, which is an amber ale. 

At second simmer: 
Added 1 can of diced tomatoes and added another half bottle of beer. 

Overall an extremely good recipe and would be even without the beer. But it did add something to the flavor.

I give this 4 stars as written. It's an excellent starter for beef stew but it needs a little more flavor. I read through the reviews and used some of the suggestions and it became a 5 star recipe.  I added some ketchup, though next time I might just use tomato paste. I also added some worcestershire sauce and some garlic powder. Also, if you want to stretch this recipe... just add more water and boullion or broth and then add more vegetables. Use my tip below to thicken and you can feed an army from 1 or 2 lbs of beef.  I also used flour instead of corn starch because it is what I'm used too and I think it just adds more flavor where cornstarch adds nothing but a thickening agent.  Tip to those that have problems making gravy or thickening sauces with flour.....  Add flour to cold water in a small container, (my dad taught me to use a baby food jar and that's what I still use today :)  Then shake, shake, shake. Then you can pour the flour mixture into whatever it is you are trying to thicken.  What I like about this method is that you don't really have to measure the flour and water. Just throw a couple of TBLS of flour in the container. Add enough water to shake it up and make a very thin paste. Then you can add a little bit at a time to your recipe until it gets thick enough to your liking. Then just throw the rest away. Perfect gravy, no lumps, EVERYTIME!  Anyway... I know people hate it when you rate a recipe but make lots of changes to it. Just so everyone knows. I made

This was so easy and it was really good.  For more flavor, I added 2 tbs of kitchen bouquet seasoning while browning the beef, a little paprika and a little worchsteschire sauce at the end.

It is great.  We will add mushrooms next time.  I have to make a half recipe to get it to fit in my crock pot, which is large, but not XL.  The only downside is that you basically have to pre cook it before you put it in the crock pot.

I hated this stew, should of read more of the reviews. I never altered anything and it turned out to be somewhat acceptable soup,.A real dissappointment from the picture  which made me give it a go. If there was a 0 star I would of selected.

Very good! I used top round roast, cut into one-inch cubes; marjoram in place of rosemary; double carrots; three HUGE potatoes (almost one pound each); an extra cup of bouillon/water.  I also dumped in about half of a one-pound bag of frozen peas near the end of the cooking time, and followed Chuck's most-helpful review for seasoning/browning/deglazing.  I used a cast-iron Dutch oven, in the oven, for simmering.  At dinnertime when I was getting ready to thicken the stew, I asked my fiance how thick he likes his stew and he said looks good as is, so I didn't add cornstarch.  I think the flour from browning the meat and the starch in the potatoes was enough to make a gravy.  What I will do differently next time:  I planned to put this in the oven at 250 and then be out of the house for a couple of hours.  I didn't read the recipe carefully enough to notice that the meat is supposed to simmer for an hour on it's own!!  Second, I might simmer the meat before adding the bouillon:  add the bouillon when I add the vegetables.  The meat was okay but could have been better, so I thought maybe the salt in the bouillon pulled the moisture from the meat.  The meat was falling apart, but not fall-apart tender.

This has been my 'go-to' stew recipe for a few years now. We LOVE it! I do dredge my beef cubes in flour/seasoned salt before browning - and I don't have to use cornstarch to thicken b/c of the added flour. I use beef base (instead of beef bouillon) and sub 1/2 cup red wine for part of the water. I add a dash of garlic powder, dry oregano, and a bay leaf. And I add frozen peas for the last 10 minutes of cooking. GREAT recipe!!!

A wonderful stew! I used fresh parsley and rosemary and beef stock for bouillon and water. The flavors were great. This is the first time I've made beef stew without tomato of some sort and it wasn't missed at all.

Awesome!!! I followed some great suggestions to tweak this recipe, (not that I thought it needed it because it was my first time making it...) Instead of boullion cubes, I used 2 cans of beef broth to start off with, and then added another near the end. I used 4 TB. of corn starch to make it thicker. I coated the meat with flour seasoned with salt, and pepper before I browned it. I think this made my broth thick right off from the start. I browned the meat with garlic powder and minced garlic from a jar. After I browned the meat, I simmered in about a cupful of red wine for a minute or two. The only thing I would probably do differently is use a bigger pan! I never liked to cook, but that's before I cooked with wine! :0)

Absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe! Of course, there will always be some people who don't vary any recipe to suit their own tastes and preferences. I start by frying off a cup each of finely diced onion, carrot and celery in a little butter, with some grated garlic & ginger. this is the base that the browned meat sits on during cooking - it mostly breaks down and adds thickness and flavour to the gravy. I do coat the meat in seasoned flour (2 Tbs each of plain & cornflour, + salt & pepper) before browning and the leftover flour mix gets addad as per this recipe.
I still use the chunky cut vegetables, sometimes adding other veges that are in season, like beans, parsnips, sweet potato or baby corn. My recipe always includes a good splash of Worcester sauce and, because people eat with their eyes before the food reaches their mouthe, I always darken the stew by stiring in some Parisian browning essence, a few drops at a time, till the colour is a rich brown.
Oh yes, one more suggestion: for a couple of dollars, you can usually find a heat diffusion plate that sits under your pot during simmering. It ensures you get an even amount of heat across the bottom of your pot and definitely helps to avoid sticking and burning.
And like all stews and braises, so much better if you can cook it the day before - overnight in the refrigerator and gently reheated for serving.

First of all, not nearly enough seasoning.Needed garlic, thyme, more pepper, a bay leaf
I will never understand people who  completely rewrite the recipe and cooking instructions, and give it five stars. You are supposed to rate ghe recipe as written or submit your recipe as a different dish.

Delish. Read reviews and coated meat with flour and seasons. Added green peppers and mushrooms. We were able to cut the meat with butter knives.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!! 2 simple changes:

1. Coat meat with 1/4c flour, 1 teaspoon garlic and onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper before browning.

2. Add like 1 tablespoon ketchup, steak sauce, and worcestershire near end.

Perfection. Amazing! #ateitall

The secret to this as well as any other beef stew is to get a great sear on the meat before adding anything else. I made this exactly as written and it came out perfect. The only thing I would suggest doing differently would be to flour the beef before searing it off, and  deglaze the pot with about 1/3 cup red wine before adding the beef broth. Flouring the meat will help thicken the stew without needing as much cornstarch. The flavor is terrific. The stew freezes well too.

This was my first time making stew! It was great! I took some advice from other comments and made a lick you bowl kind of good stew! Thanks! I will make this again!( My 4 yr old did lick the bowl) So extras I added to recipe:
1 extra carrot, celery, potato, sweet potato,red onion, sm turnip, 1 tbsp worcestershire sauce, sm squirt ketchup, and 3/4 cup red wine.
I used more beef broth because I added so many vegetables. I added enough broth to cover the vegetables.( I did this when I added the vegetables...second hour of cooking)
I also put the white cooking onion in first let it caramelize with the vegetable oil, then added meat to plastic bag. Put a mixture of the spices and 2 tablespoons white flour. Shake the meat to cover then added it to the big pot. Browned all sides of meat about 4 mins.Also added celery at this time. ( I don't like mine crunchy) Then I added red wine cooked 1 mins then added broth. Simmer 1 hour. Then added the rest of veggies and needed to add a bit more broth to cover veggies. Cooked another 1 1/2 on simmer with lid on.
I used about 6 teaspoons corn starch and cold water...did it 3 times in sets of 2...but I wanted thick stew. :)
Thanks so much for the great recipe! I served this with warm 3 onion tea biscuits.

Made this exactly as stated, and it was a hit!   I think I will try this on the slow cooker next time, for some real tender beef.

This is a very good recipe and on my third try at it I made a few modifications.  I used 8 cups water, 3 leeks instead of onion, added some white wine, a spoonful of paprika, 2 cloves garlic, tsp of Vegeta, used about 3 tbsp of tapioca starch instead of corn starch, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I don't like very thick beef stews so to me this came out just right and the wine, paprika, leeks, and garlic added a zesty flavor a somewhat reminiscent of goulash that made this a standout recipe.  Excellent!

This  is a great recipe to start from.  After reading some reviews, I made a few changes to give it some more flavor.  I first mix the beef in a ziplock gallon bag with 1/2 cup flour and 1 tbs each of garlic powder, onion powder and pepper.  I then brown the meat and deglaze the pot with 1/2 cup of wine.  I add it all to a crock pot where I had dissolved 2 cubes of beef bouillon with 32oz beef broth instead of water.  I also add 1 tbs each of  ketchup, A1, and Worcestershire sauce.  I also add my spices, rosemary, parsley, and celery seed.  When it was time to add the veggies, I add whatever I have, red potatoes, carrots, sweetcorn, etc.  If I want a thicker gravy I add cornstarch dissolved in a bit of water to the stew.  I've made this recipe for years now and its always a hit.

This was pretty good overall, but the beef itself was really bland. I decided to cook it as per the recipe rather doing what I usually would have done (and what nearly all the reviews said to do), toss the beef in seasoned flour before cooking. All the reviews are right, it needs it. I had beer that I wanted to use so I poured a bottle of beer into a measuring cup and added beef broth to make four cups liquid total. I think I should have used 1 cup beer at most as it had good flavour but was a bit too beer-y. All in all this was a nice recipe and I loved that it didn't have tomato in it, like most beef stew recipes seem to call for!

Use beef broth then add salt to taste.  Add lima beans, and something more for better flavor / texture.  Use more corn starch for thicker consistency

Delicious! I made it in the slowcooker, on low for six hours. I put in double the corn starch and put it on high with some cold water for another half hour. Still not thick enough, but the broth was delicious.

I have never been able to make a stew that I like, and I have grown tired of the "packets" of stew mix that just don't taste right. This recipe was delicious and the seasonings were perfect. Easy to make and the meat was very tender.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes.  After browning the meat in olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper, I added some beer and followed a few of the other reviews and added A1, ketchup, and worcestershire sauce and simmered for a couple minutes.  The meat was super tender!!  I added five bouillon cubes, and more potatoes.  I also had baby carrots instead of large carrots.  I added a can of corn at the end and let it sit a couple minutes..  Still tasted wonderful!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This was okay. We ate all of it, but it wasn't a really hearty, homey, old fashioned soup- which I was craving. I used some of the suggestions: red potatoes, 1 sweet potato (mashed after cooked), beef broth instead of bouillon, and more cornstarch. The rosemary was a little too strong, I think 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon would suffice. This wasn't that bad, but I won't be making this recipe again.

This recipe is awesome! I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder (no flour) before browning.  I used "better than bouillon" instead of granules. I let it simmer two hours before I added the potatoes.  Waited another 30 minutes before adding the carrots and celery; I like them crispier, not soft. I doubled the cornstarch but it was still brothy like soup, which is just fine with me.  My almost vegetarian daughter had a bowl of broth, carrots and celery and loved it. The real test will be my hubby; he does not like soups or stews as a rule.  (He will be trying it tomorrow for lunch.) This is now in my rotation of comfort food.  Perfect for these 15 degree days.UPDATE: finally figured out how to thicken the stew. mixed together 2 to 1 ratio of cornstarch to water and added when the stew was finished.  Stew thickened up in less than 5 minutes.

My go-to beef stew.  The only alteration I make to this recipe is to add garlic (my husband is addicted to the stuff!) and cook it in my crock pot.  I just throw all the ingredients together and let it sit in the crock pot on "high" for four to five hours.  I always try to make extra so I can bring leftovers to work during the week, but the entire pot is usually gone in 24 hours.  Delish!!!

I love this after a few additions.  I dredged the beef in 1/4 C four and browned it.  Added the broth and herbs as directed.  Added a bag of frozen mixed veggies in addition to the fresh.  Added some thyme, doubled the broth as I wanted a lot of gravy and it was looking a bit skimpy.  Added 1/2 C dry red wine.  Whisked the left over flour with a bit of water and added that at the last hour.  If you use beef broth instead of bouillon you will need salt.  My husband sopped up the gravy with sourdough bread.  Excellent flavor.

I have to say this was an easy recipe to follow and the results were very good!  Aside of what is in this recipe I did add alot of my own spices and instead of using cornstarch I used Knorr Veloutine Thickener to thicken the sauce/gravy.  I will make this again.  Thank you.

This recipe is excellent. The meat comes out very tender, and the veggies are perfectly done (not hard, not mushy). I took the advice of another review the first time I made it and added some red wine, but found that I like this recipe better without it. It tastes much more like a traditional beef stew with the water alone, though I do add a little garlic and onion powder which I would highly recommend trying. A few dashes of worchestershire sauce also adds to the flavor nicely without over doing it. Less is more with this recipe. It's almost perfect just the way it is. Thanks so much for sharing it!

Amazingly good!  Some of the best stew I've made!  I only tweaked it a little.  I added some thyme, omitted the onion for dietary reasons, and added double the corn starch.    I would go even heavier on the corn starch next time.  Other than that, it was simply excellent!  Another note is that I used white potatoes which held up very well in the crock pot.  I cooked the stew for about 8 hours adding the veggies about half-way through.  It came out with the veggies soft-tender and the meat fork tender!  What an excellent recipe you provided - THANK YOU!

This came out awesome, with the following modifications:

I used about 3 pounds of beef, and I cut the cubes to small, bite sized pieces.

I browned the beef in butter, not oil.

I used 5 cups of water and 5 boullion cubes.

I added 1 bay leaf with all of the other seasonings.

I didn't use celery, but instead one massive green bell pepper.

I added the veggies shortly after the broth came to a boil (about 15 minutes).

I used flour, instead of cornstarch.  (The next time, though I'll add it only a few minutes before serving, instead of about the 30 minutes I did this time, because it got a little too thick).

With all of those modifications, it was truly awesome!

This stew was very tasty.  The rosemary added great flavor.  I did make a few small changes...Before browning, I rubbed two cloves of crushed garlic, salt, and pepper into the beef.  Also, I added more corn starch because I like very thick stew.  TIP: If you add extra cornstarch like me, dissolve a beef granules or a bouillon cube into some water.  Then, dissolve the cornstarch into that.  It prevents you from losing flavor.

Great, simple stew recipe that I've used maybe a dozen times.  I probably use less oil than called for, and add about 1 tsp garlic powder to the meat and oil right in the beginning for extra flavor.  I've had better results letting the meat simmer for 2 hours before adding the veggies rather than 1 hour.  Good stuff

Wow! I'm still an intermediate level cook, but this recipe made me feel like an expert.

I read the other reviews and used the beef broth instead of water. I also added a cup of red wine. 

I just fried up the beef in the pot and added some of the wine and pepper.

Love this recipe.  I was surprised at how favorful the beef was, even after all that simmering.  I used a little more corn starch/water just because the family likes a thick gravy but it was great.  No leftovers & I've made it several times.

Nov. 2008...still using this yummy recipe.  Also works great with venison, simmering in the boullion all but removed that gamey taste.

I didn't like this recipe and nor did my family. Super bland and I did doctor it up alot more than the recipe said. I used red wine and water, added lots of garlic, plus salt and pepper. This didn't even help. I wouldn't reccomend this recipe. Sorry.

Yes! I made the Beef Stew VI but I doubled the recipe since we are big eaters and seldom leftovers. 

I par-boiled the carrots and potatoes while the beef was simmering; otherwise the veggies never cook thoroughly; I also defrosted the frozen peas for 1 hour before adding them in with the veggies. Stew was awesome. I call it my Beef Stew101

Many thanks, Paula - You've got a best seller on your hands:)

Excellent, very hearty and a sure pleaser. I followed the recs here and did the following to improve it: Shake meat w/ 1/4th cup flour, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp pepper in  bag before browning. To the liquids, add 1/2 cup of red wine, 1 Tbsp ketchup, 1 Tbsp A-1, 1 Tbsp Worcestershire. Can use 4 cups beef stock instead of water + bullion cubes. Added 8 oz sliced and sauteed white mushrooms 10 mins before cooking completed. If I could give this 4.5 stars I would only because, even with my additions it is bland. Definitely a keeper though with these changes, and I will make it again!

Holy Cow! This recipe is soooo perfect!!! If you are a first timer, novice, or someone who prefers to really go by the book, TRY THIS!!!  It's real beef stew, and just delicious!! Kiddos Paula! And thx so much for sharing!!  Only added 1/2 cup red wine and a garlic clove...Absolutely no reason to worry about or make ANY changes. If u like a thicker gravy just add 2 tsp extra corn starch/cold water...which you can easily gage and decide when you add the vegetables. 
I am one of those cooks who has always made intuitive changes. But, I could tell by reading the recipe, and reviews that there was no need. 
I've been married 30 years, and my husband is pretty accustomed to good meals, gotta repeat what he said! So cute! ' I'm so totally satisfied, there's nothing else in the world I need!'  TEE HEE! I'll take that on a Friday night! However...not sure I'll find a dessert to keep him that way. :)))

This was the best stew I have ever made! the broth was rich and flavourful, even though I trimmed the fat off the meat carefully. I did have to use a bit more oil to brown the meat than called for. I added the onions with the soup bouillon. Otherwise,  I followed all of Chuck's suggestions except I didn't add red wine or A1 sauce because I didn't have either of these. Oh and I used no salt broth so I did have to add a tsp of salt also because there was  none in any of the ingredients. My husband raved about it, he did not particularly like my previous stew which was tomato based.

Best stew I've made yet.Mine are usually bland and since I'm a fair cook I usually use a crock pot.Finding myself with time on a Saturday afternoon I skipped the crock pot.I also followed the suggestion of deglazing the pan with wine and using some Worcestershire sauce.I like celery in soups but not stew so I left it out. I believe not using the crock pot was a great idea.
My husband loves stew vegetables so I fit more in.I was left with a tastefully rich stew.Try it!

The only change I would make to this recipe is to add half a rutabaga or turnip as I know it - diced - the extra flavour is unbelievable.

The best stew I've made, I like it much better this way than in the crock pot. I did mix 1/4c of flour and spices  with the raw beef before throwing in the pan to sear. Delicious!

Wow! So close to my very own recipe, so I tried this. I did "tweak" this recipe a wee-bit! (sorry, I cannot help it...lol) I created this in my roaster so I could make a larger batch. I simply tripled this recipe. I did as this recipe said, I used vegetable oil and browned the meat, (yes right in my roaster on 400 degrees), as it was browning, I added seasoned meat tenderizer and pepper, (approx 1 tablespoon each....keep in mind, I tripled this recipe and the seasoned meat tenderizer is perfectly salty, so I would not recommend adding any other salt), stirred almost constantly, once the meat was completely browned, I added about two cups of red wine, the diced onions, celery and the cornstarch paste (as this recipe instructed), I also added about a tablespoon each of parsley, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika and Worcestershire, (I also included a tablespoon of A-1 sauce as suggested by another viewer), this made a lovely roux. Smelled amazing! I turned the roaster down to 250 degrees and let that simmer SLOWLY for about an hour, stirring every 15 minutes. Then I added bullion cubes w/water, the carrots and potatoes, left the roaster at 250 degrees and simmered SLOWLY for another 2 hours stirring every 15 minutes. I served this with homemade buttermilk biscuits! It was delicious and warmed us all up on this cold February day here in Northern Illinois! Thank you for sharing this!

I loved how easy this was, and it didn't take 2 hours either. I did follow someone else's advise and added a tbsp of each of ketchup, worcestershire sauce and red wine vinegar, some garlic salt, a little cumin and a little black pepper. I let it cook covered for one hour and than added the potatoes and carrots, I was out of onios and celery but it came out sooo good! Having it for dinner tonight!

I cut this in half, replaced 1 cup of water with 1 cup of red wine. Added a bay leaf, coated the beef in flour with a dash of salt and pepper before browning. Used parsnips instead of potatoes, added frozen peas at the end of the cooking around 30 minutes of cooking to go. Added garlic. with these changes this recipe came out great, I just think you need wine in beef stew, maybe it's because I lived in France for a year! :-)

Made a few minor changes. Dredged meat first in a combo of flour, garlic powder and onion powder. Browned in cast iron Dutch oven.

Good basic stew recipe.  I did this in the slow cooker, onions on the bottom, layer of potatoes, then the beef.  I browned the beef first in hot oil, seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I made the liquid part as per recipe, but added 1 TBSP of worchestershire sauce, and a bay leaf.  I didn't have carrots or celery on hand, but when there was about 45 mins left to supper I added mushrooms and 5 TBSP of cornstarch (the stew was really soupy), and it turned out perfectly - but I fed 4 people, with just enough left overs for 2 servings.  Served with baking powder biscuits, and was delicious.

I double the recipe and left out the celery, and went with 3 Tbsp./3 Tbsp. cornstarch/water. Added: 6 cloves of garlic, 1/4 cup ketchup, 2 Tbsp. BBQ sauce. Everyone LOVED it!

This is an amazing and foolproof beef stew.  Not only simple and delicious but also a gorgeous presentation.  I make it pretty much as the recipe says and love the tasty simplicity.  I always add garlic and a little kitchen bouquet but otherwise don't mess with perfection.

Added mashed sweet potatoes for thickness since I didn't have corn starch. Also put flour and pepper in a bad with the meat and tossed to coat before browning. I used 1.2 cup red wine, threw in some green beans, and per another review added a tablespoon each of ketchup, worchester, and A1. OH, didn't have rosemary so I used thyme instead. This is THE BOMB! Served over brown rice.

Great comfort food!  Easy and came out great.  I floured my meat before browning it to seal in some tenderness, but everything else I did as directed.  Came out great!  Easy and pretty much fool-proof.

I loveddd this! Definitely do the flour dredge before frying the beef. Also - I did this in my cast iron skillet with the beef and onion, deglazed with the liquid. I then threw everything into the crockpot (with about 3 times as much liquid) and came home 8 hours later to pure deliciousness. Have made this recipe multiple times using a bit of red wine as well - comes out even better. Oh - and definitely use some worcestershire!!!!!

Excellent! The only substitution I made was to use beef stock instead of water and buillion, because I don't care for bouillion cubes. The taste was EXCELLENT.

The only suggestion I have for next time is to use a few less carrots and another potato or two. IMPORTANT:  Add the vegetables no more than 45 minutes before serving. The hour quoted in the recipe is just too long and the potatoes get too soft and sort of dissolved.

This was truly delicious! I have experimented with many beef stew recipes only to be left woefully disapointed.  This particular recipes was full of flavor...easy to prepare and an overall huge hit with my family. However next time I will add an extra carrot and stalk of celery.  I also used a whoe onion and some mushrooms during this preparation.

This is a classic recipe with classic good taste. I followed as written, using beef broth as I prefer to use bouillon as little as possible. Salt to taste. I also chose thyme over rosemary & added mushrooms, again personal preference. Generally, I like to dredge stew meat in flour and pepper before browning but really, this recipe doesn't need serious tinkering with at all.

Wonderful recipe.. especially on a chilly day. I added 4 bay leaves for a little extra. This is one of the best beef stew recipes I've had. Next time, I would double the amount of cornstarch because the broth could have been thicker (for my taste).

I'm giving this one four stars and not five because, my husband didn't like the rosemary.  He said that it had a weird consistency but, the flavor was really good.  I actually loved this stew and I'll definitely be making it again.

Delicious.  I used a stainless steel pot and replaced 2 cups of water with 1 cup of white wine and 1 cup of red wine.  Instead of bouillon (I'm not a fan), I grinded sea salt and adjusted to taste.   At the start of the second hour, also added another 1/2 cup of white wine per user suggestions.  Threw in an extra red potato, celery and carrot. Served over Nishiki premium brown rice.  Will definitely make again. Thanks, Paula.

This stew was good but it started getting scorched about 10-15 minutes before it was done.  It's a good thing I added approximately 2 cups of vegetable juice to the recipe or it would have REALLY burned.  I also added green pepper,used only 1/2 the onion, and added a bit of extra parsley

I cut out the cornstarch and parsley from the recipe.  
I dredged the meat in a flour, Lawry's, a touch of Tony Chanchers, black pepper, paprika, and garlic powder mix before browning in oil.  
I added about a tsp of Worcestershire sauce to the stew.
I added apple cider vinegar to taste.
Everyone raved!

GREAT stew recipe. Simple, but the flavors really come together when they are simmered in the pot. I used beef-flavored Better than Bouillon instead of the cubes, but it's basically the same thing. I also always add a dash of ketchup to my stew recipes. Gives it a little kick. So tasty!

Great recipe! Maybe only add 3c water; I had to reduce the liquid by 1/4 before adding cornstarch and the sauce was still very thin.

Excellent! I did follow other reviewers comments and dredged the beef in flour and garlic and onion powder and added a bit more cornstarch.  I also added some mushrooms because I love them and had some.   My teen age son who had 4 impacted wisdom teeth removed 4 days ago said he loved it---quite high praise for the tenderness of the meat and he asked me to make it regularly, particularly after his heavy practice days on his high school rowing team.

I only rated it 4 stars because I did change some things.  I used most of Chuck's suggestions. A little wine instead of some of the water, a little Worchester sauce and more than doubled the cornstarch mixture. I didn't have any celery so I added about a cup of frozen peas with about 15 minutes to go and it was great! My husband liked it too! Thanks!

Tasty! I did doctor it a bit with some garlic powder, paprika and basil too. Browned the meat first coated in flour and the spices, then added all that to the pot with some more parsley and rosemary. I did have to use more cornstarch to thicken, but it was really a nice flavorful stew and a change from the tomato based one I use. Thanks!

Easy and delicious! I dredged the meat in flour/garlic powder/pepper mixture before browning it in the dutch oven in batches (i let them drain on a paper towel in between).  I also used about 2.5 cans of 14oz beef broth instead of water and bouillon, substituted pearl onions and used about 3 times the amount of cornstarch/water slurry the recipe called for since i like my beef stew to be a little thicker.  I served this over buttered egg noodles and it was a hit with my picky husband! Once I slaved over Julia Child's bouef bourgignon for hours and hours and my husband said he prefers this recipe to Julia Child's - and this was so much simpler and easier to prep!

This was really good.  I followed the recipe, only adding some garlic and more pepper.  I used flour instead of cornstarch, but it turned out beautifully.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful stew! I used 4 cups of stock instead of water and bouillon cubes, doubled up on the veggies except celery (which I halved), and added mushrooms.  I coated my meat in 1/4 cup flour, 1 tsp each garlic powder and onion powder then cooked in my LeCreuset dutch oven in half butter half oil until meat was seared on all sides.  I think searing the meat first brought out a wonderfully extra meaty flavor in the stew.  I doubled up on the cornstarch to make the stew nice and thick (the flour from searing the meat also helped). And of course I seasoned to taste with salt and pepper at the end.  Served with homemade biscuits.  I'll keep this in my regular rotation during the cold months.

Perfect Beef stew - made the following changes:  put 1/4 c. flour, tsp garlic powder, tsp onion powder, 1/2 rsp pepper in a bag - threw in cubes and shook. Seared the cubes in a dutch oven - after searing - along with beef bouillon, put in 1/2 c. red wine. Put more veggies in than called for. Added more bouillon around 1 1/2 hrs into simmer. Added 1 tbsp each of ketchiup, A-1 & Worstershire during simmer.  Only change would be for me to simmer total of 2.5 hrs as I found veggies still a little undercooked after 2 hrs.

I have never made beef stew before and was amazed I could make this sooo well the first time. I did follow the other reviewer who said to shake the meat up with flour and other seasonings before I browned them.  Also used wine to help deglaze before adding in the other liquids.  I did increase all the veggies by one as I like more vegetables. Also added in the tablespoon of ketchup, a1, and worctheshire sauce.  The meat came out incredibly tender. Well make again.

Awesome base to start with!  I never made a good stew that we all liked until now!  I did what one reviewer did and threw meat in a bag w/ flour, onion powder, garlic powder and pepper.  Also I used 3 cans of beef broth, and added the tbsp each of ketchup, A-1, and Worcheshire sauce.  Served with dumplings, it was a hit!

A definite keeper! We used about 1.5 lbs of stew meat and used red potatoes and no celery, since that's what we had. Added a little garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce as well for zip. I totally forgot to add the cornstarch in at the correct stage, so we added it with 10 minutes left. I quadrupled the cornstarch to try and get it thicker faster since we were hungry, and it turned out great. I could have liked it thicker like my mom's but my husband likes it on the thin side so it ended up a happy medium. :) Served with Jiffy corn muffins. I would recommend this recipe to anyone. Great texture--everything was cooked perfectly. So easy, so tasty and I'm pretty sure it helped clear up my cold. ^_^ I look forward to playing with this recipe and customizing it just for fun, since it's already really good as is!

AMAZING!!!! So quick and easy and very yummy :) Kids ever were asking what the great smell was when it was cooking :) Added corn and more cornstarch but that is it and it was mouthwatering! Will make again for sure. My pic was a hour before it was done still cooking in the pot...yum lol.

A great beef stew! This is the first time I've made it without using a can of tomatoes. We like spicier food in our family so I dredged my meat in a spiced flour mix (paprika, garlic powder, black pepper). Also, its a good idea to salt the stew only at the end of the cooking time. I used 3 pounds of good steak...decadent, but so worth it.

With a few additions this was hands down the best beef stew ever!  I coated the beef cubes in 1/4 cup flour, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp pepper before browning.  Deglazing the pan with 1/2 cup of red wine added an extra layer of flavor as did 1 Tbsp each of steak sauce and Worcestshire sauce.  Delicious!

Too bland for my liking possibly because I didn't thicken the broth enough.  I even cut one cup of the water and it was still too thin.  Just not a rich enough recipe for my taste.  Seems like it needs more seasoning of some sort.

This stew was fantastic.  I did what others suggested and put 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 t.pepper, 1 t.onion powder and 1 t.garlic powder in a bag with the beef before browning.  I also added 1 tablespoon A-1 and 1 T. Worcestershire sauce to the sauce.  I doubled the cornstarch mixture for a thicker sauce.  This really needed the full 2 hours to cook.  My whole picky family of 6 loves this.  I have tried many stew recipes without success.  This recipe really is that good.

This was by far the best beef stew!  I've tried several others on here, and this was the BEST.  And VERY EASY!  I changed a few things that made a big difference: First, I coated the meat with onion powder, garlic powder, coarse black pepper & minced garlic (4-5 cloves) before cooking.  Then, instead of boullion cubes, I used 3 cups of beef broth, and one cup of red wine.  I also added several splashes of worcester sauce, which made a wonderful (slight) change in taste.  I doubled the cornstarch/water combo, to make it thicker.  Beware of putting the veggies in too early, as I did, and the meat wasn't quite done when the veggies were done.  EXCELLENT RECIPE that we can't wait to make again!

This stew was great.  The only modifications that I made were to add 1/2 cup of red wine (when I added the water) and I added one extra carrot, potato and half of an onion.  I made it for family that I had over for dinner.  Served it with garlic mashed potatoes.  Perfect meal.

Sadly disappointing. I tried to follow the recipe as stated to be able to give an honest review. The longer the stew cooked and the more I tasted....I knew I was going to really have to add to it, to make it taste good. I added red wine, garlic, and a bunch of other things and it still wasn't all that great. I think a big part of it was the bouillon. If it'd been made with beef broth using a little bouillon for flavoring, it would have been much more flavorful. I'll stick to my fav. from allrecipes "Lamb and winter vegetable stew" made with beef instead.

KEEPER!!! Hearty, flavorful and delicious! Coated the beef with flour mixture, added 2c water for more gravy & used red potatoes (skins on) as 3 others suggested. Will be pulling this one out on cold nights all winter long! Thanks for sharing Paula.

Delicious stew!! I loved it. I did not use the corn starch because I let it simmer for a total of 3 hours. The stew was thick and tasty. Since I did not have parsley or rosemary I threw in a Bay leaf. BUT the 4 beef cubes made the soup too salty so next time I will put in low sodium beef cubes.

Okay, I made this twice now and it turned out so yummy with the improvements that I made. With these improvements I am changing my rating from a four-star to a five-star. I cut the dried rosemary to 1/2 teaspoon and tried as best I could to chop it up (I hate the pine needle texture); I added a dash of worchestershire sauce and a dash of sugar and more black pepper than was called for; I used two heaping tablespoons of cornstarch; and I used 8 cups (2 qts) of beef broth. This stew is very hardy and I will be making it on chilly days, served with a few pieces of crusty bread.

This was delicious, and the meat was really tender.  I'll be making this all the time for now on.  I did dredge the beef in flour before cooking in the oil, and I also added some flour in with the water/boullion mixture (putting it in a jar and shaking, as some reviewer suggested).  It was thick enough for us at the end, so I didn't use the cornstarch.

This is a superb recipe and highly deserving of the 5 star rating.  Im a real dummy when it comes to cooking in general and for me to make this from scratch and actually like it is a miracle.  Its a very easy recipe to follow and the results are delicious.  Next time I would add 1 cup of peas and/or corn to get some more veggies in there.  Once again awesome recipe and it made my whole house smell good.  Thanks a bunch!!

As a young newlywed, I had never made beef stew before, and my mom wasn't home to tell me her recipe.  Let's just say I won't be needing her recipe anymore - this is definately a new favorite!  We liked how tender the beef was and the delicate flavour of the rosemary.

I made this for the first time today, and based on some previous reviewers suggestions, I browned the beef coated with flour, pepper and garlic. Then I added 1 cup red wine and 3 cups water and bouillion cubes. I followed the recipe pretty close after this, added in more cornstarch to make the gravy thicker. I also added mushrooms to the stew and 1 can of tomato paste. It was so yummy, my husband could not get enough!

This recipe will be replacing my old recipe from now on. Awesome blend of spices. I did roll the meat in flour before browing with a pinch of each of the seasoning the recipe called for so I did not have a watery result like other reviews. Awesome results!  Thanks for the great new family favorite!

It was okay.  i took other reviewers advice and added more cornstarch to make it thicker, but all in all it was very bland to me.  i will probably make again, but with some adjustments.

Wow , what a hit!! This was so simple and so delicious. My whole family loved it including my 8 and 10 year olds (who are not vegetable lovers). I,like many others, floured the meat before browning, I also increased the cornstarch to 4 tsps, and added peas and corn. The timing was perfect, both the meat and the vegetables were very tender. I will definately be making this again and again.

This is fantastic stew!  I didn't have any rosemary, so I used some thyme instead.  Otherwise I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  It turned out so delicious, the meat and veggies were very tender and well flavored.  Best of all, this wasn't salty tasting, as a lot of soups/stews are.  I served this with some Light Wheat Rolls, from this site, and it was the perfect meal after playing in the snow.  I will definately be making this again.

Great recipe! Very easy to make and doesn't take a lot of worrying about, I watched a movie while it was cooking. I don't have a slow cooker but this stovetop recipe is just as good and the beef is tender and full of flavor. The vegetables were good too, picking up the flavor of the beef broth. I served this with biscuits and it made a great meal.

Excellent recipe but I found one hour was not long enough for the vegetables to cook. They were still a little crunchy. Next time I put the vegetables in with the meat and it was perfect.

This recipe is fantastic!!! Oh my gosh, we had it for dinner a few hours ago and I still can't stop going back to the kitchen for "just a little more"! The things I changed were, I didn't use rosemary (Walmart was out!) and I tripled the cornstarch. I also put just a little more carrot in because my family loves cooked carrots. I also browned the beef with 2 cloves of garlic and garlic powder added some corn with the veggies. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Oh My Goodness!!  This recipe is simply divine!!  I was looking for a crock-pot recipe and looked too long to have anything cooked on it so I stumbled on this recipe.  I had dinner ready at 5:00 pm with minimum fuss.  I sauteed garlic and garlic powder while I was browning the beef and added 1-1/2 c. of Zinfandel (leftover from the fridge) instead of water.  I added 1/2 tsp. celery salt and ommitted celery since DH is the only one that likes it.

I added too much cornstarch (1/3 c.), but it worked out well because I kept on adding water the second half of the cooking time due to evaporation.  The sauce was nice & thick & the soup was hearty.  DH wanted to eat another big bowl of it, but what he really wanted was the sauce!  Will definitely make at least bi-weekly.  My kids loved the veggies and they ate all of what was in the bowl!!

More recipes like these, please ;)

This was great. I put about a tablespoon of minced fresh garlic into the broth, and threw in some mushroom caps with the rest of the veggies. I prefer my stew to be a little watery, so I added an extra cup of water and one beef boullion. I served this with a few slices of sourdough garlic bread. Delicious. Thank you!

Paula, thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I made it for dinner and it was the best I have ever made.  I did make a change.  I floured the beef cubes and then browned them, when they were brown I added 1/4 cup of red wine.  I simmered for approx. 1 minute and then added two 14 1/2 oz. cans of beef broth.  
I let it simmer 2 1/2 hours.  When done, I cooked 3 med. size potatoes in the microwave and mashed them very good and added to the stew to thicken the broth.  I didn't use any cornstarch.  Let me tell you that the flavor was awesome.  I will make this again and again and use the wine again and thicken with mashed potatoes for flavor.  Thank you.

Opps!  Forgot to mentioned that I eliminated the rosemary.

This recipes is awesome. It takes awhile to make but it's not hard. I scaled it down to 5 servings but it only made 3 very small servings. I used about three times the amount of cornstarch and water to thicken it though.I used olive oil to brown my meat and beef broth instead of water and it still turned out perfect. A real keeper!

This is such a tasty meal! The only thing I changed was I added a cup and a half of frozen peas and corn the last hour of cooking, and it came out absolutely perfect.  We made it for my brothers family while we were camping.  We let it cook slowly during the day while we enjoyed nature, and put the servings in boule bread bowls, and it was soooo yummy! A hit with the entire group!  Will make again!!  Thank you!

Delicious!  I coated the beef stew pieces before browning.  By doing that, it thickened the sauce and didn't need to add the cornstarch to it at the end.  It took about 2 hours to cook, but well worth the wait!

WOW!  This was wonderful.  I did have to add extra water, but I think that was because I let it simmer at too high a temp.  I also forgot to add the cornstarch, so I just added it when I put my biscuits in the oven, and cranked up the heat and it came out fine.  My boyfriend loved it, and since we're both employed as cooks, he is very hard to please.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a very good recipe.  I used three cups water and boullion and one can of beef broth.  I also added some thyme, about 1/4 cup brown sugar and peas.  It turned out really well.  Thanks.  What a great way to use a cheap cut of meat!

This is the first beef stew I've ever made and it turned out very nice.  If I ever make it again, I will cut the meat up in smaller pieces so it will be more tender.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is the best beef stew I`ve ever tasted!  I would go a little easy on the pepper, though.  I used less meat but the same amount of vegetables, and it only gave me 3-4 servings, so if you`re having a big dinner party, I suggest doubling or even tripling the recipe.

This is not a good recipe.  I have gone to culinary art school and have worked in many kitchens.  This lacks serious flavor and depth.  Not only is this just soup without flavor it is far from stew.  I had to add an hour to cooking time tons of salt and wine and Worcester sauce.  Triple the amount of corn starch. Super weak and disappointing. No garlic should tell you this doesn't have flavor.

I made this with the suggestion of flouring the meat and browning it before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Best flavor I have gotten in a beef stew and the recipe lends itself to using  the vegetables, etc, that you prefer.

OK - to all those "purists" out here, wanting us to rate the posted recipe...I have this to say:
I come here for ideas. Most of us do. But food and dishes are meant to be played with. Tailored to our own tastes and to share different angles on what is a great beginning. It doesn't mean we are slagging the author. On the contrary. We are thanking them for giving us a good base to start with.
So to the author- thank you! 
After reading many reviews, I added a couple of shots of Worcestershire, some HP, and a bit of wine, along with more cornstarch. All in all- fantastic. Thank You!!

I give this recipe 5 stars. I made a few changes though.
I  read the comments and decided to use red wine  for the deglazing . Realized I didn't have red wine so I went out to get some - came back with 24 beer.
  I realized I didn't have any stewing meat or potatoes (or carrots) so I ordered a pizza.
This recipe was awesome,  I will certainly be doing it again. (Rating a recipe 5 stars and completely changing it is a joke)

Delicious! I didn't have beef bouillon so I used 4 cups of beef stock instead. I also added the flour and seasoning  shake up! suggested by 'Chuck' in a previous review and browned the meat with that flour coating. 
I also added the tbsp of ketchup and tbsp of worsteshire sauce. No A-1 sauce in the fridge, like Chuck had put in his version.
This is the best stew I've ever tasted! I tend to do a crock pot stew.. However I will definitely be making this recipe again. The whole family absolutely loved this! Thanks for sharing your recipe and feedback (Chuck).

Will definitely be making again - my family loved this and it's simple to make.   I used low sodium Better Than Bouillon beef base because I prefer to season my meat and the dish itself if needed; I lightly salted beef overnight; used additional herbs (1/4 tsp each of dried thyme and oregano); and used the 1 tablespoon each mixture of A1, worcestershire sauce and ketchup as well as the 1/4 cup flour, 1 tsp garlic & onion powders with 1/2 tsp black pepper coating for the beef before browning as suggested by Chuck Sampson.   I also doubled the cornstarch mixture and added extra celery,  carrots and potatoes (red potatoes are my preference since they have lower carbs).  Next time, however,  I will add my potatoes about 20 minutes after adding the  celery & carrots since a good amount of them dissolved (glad I added extra).  I also threw in about a cup of frozen peas in the last 20 minutes of simmering.

This was a great meal. We omitted the carrots and celery but kept everything else + a little more seasoning. The gravy was a bit thin so we added some flour at the very end and that fixed it right up. I will make this again!

This is the recipe that finally got me to add an opinion. Been a long-time member, but never contributed.
  If more stars could be added, I would give it the highest rating. Absolutely easy, totally de-lish, very satisfying. My husband raved about it for days, and is always ready to have it any time. I did fry the meat with flour and garlic before starting off. For someone who is simply not into cooking, this is my fave.

My family liked this stew.  I did shake the meat in flour, garlic powder and onion powder before browning as others suggested, and I used beef broth since that's what I had on hand and I cooked it in the crock pot.  The meat was so moist and tender and the flavor was good.

I followed the recipe to the letter and was bowled over!! This was really good and the meat was nice and tender despite my worries. Only thing I did was to add a little more cornstarch as we like a thicker gravy.

This stew came out amazing! Great flavor! Next time I will add less liquid and more flour (I didn't have any cornstarch) but still great. I did add fresh garlic and sliced mushrooms. I will definitely be making this again!

Loved this recipe.  I made some changes based on some of the reviews. I added some red wine after browning the beef and also increased the bullion, potatoes, carrots, and water.  And, I didn't have celery in the house but I did have celeriac, so I used that. I also used thyme instead of rosemary because I didn't have rosemary either. As other reviews suggested I increased the cornstarch. Super delicious!!

I make this recipe with beef broth liquid instead of cubes and water. Other than that, I follow it completely. It is really yummy and has joined my menu rotation. All my picky family eaters love it!

I have been looking for this recipe my whole life! My grandma made the best beef stew - but she never wrote down her recipes, they were all in her head. When she died she took her recipes to the grave with her. I have never been able to replicate the stew until now. This recipe is just awesome! I did take the suggestions of other reviewers and coated the beef with flour & pepper before browning and I like my stew on the thicker side, so I tripled the corn starch. So, so good. I will be making this again and again.

We loved this beef stew creation. We made a few adjustments. We used 2lbs of flank steak (marinated in wine for about an hour) seared on a grill pan, before we added it to the large pot with the bullion/water/spice mixture. We also added about 3/4c of red wine, an additional 1/4c of water, and doubled the corn starch/cold water mixture. There is something about hearty stews - warms the soul! We highly recommend this recipe!

I have made this many times over the years but never reviewed it.  I saw this in this month's Allrecipes Magazine  which reminded me that I haven't made this in a long time.  It is definitely 5 star both as written or if you want to make some minor changes to your taste.  My guy, like others, likes lots of beef in his stew so I used 3 lbs of beef, 5 cups of beef broth, one cup of cabernet wine ( my preference over the cubes and water). I left everything else the same as written for 2 lbs, except for increasing the spices a bit to taste since there was more liquid.  As others suggested, I increased the cornstarch and water to 6 tsp. each to accommodate the increase in liquid.  At the very end, I added some frozen peas.  I don't like mushy peas.  Thanks again submitter and thanks Allspice for adding and oldie but goodie to your magazine.

This recipe is so easy and delicious!  I make this once a week for dinner using veggies from the farmers market. It's so hearty and satisfying, and my 1 year old eats up the veggies like a pro!  More than enough for leftovers.  If I can make it while watching a toddler, so can you!!!

Made it exactly as indicated.  Too much rosemary.  Celery to chunky.  Lacked flavor and richness (even after adding cornstarch).   Even looked bland, and unsavory.

AMAZING beef stew recipe. I substituted the beef with Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage to speed up the process! It allowed me to completely Skip the first step, cutting my cooking time down significantly. I also used fresh herbs instead of dried. This got rave reviews and I will make it again with different kinds of meats! THANK YOU

Great recipe to break in my enameled cast iron pot. 
Followed other suggestions and floured and browned the meat first, then didn't read the directions so the onion went in. Next time I will have to remember to put the celery in with the first addition, allowing it to cook longer. Added turnip and mushrooms and a little extra water. Kept the cornstarch at about 2 t., added it with the mushrooms at the last 30 minutes, and it thickened nicely because of the flour. 
Thanks for the recipe! Simple things so often are the best!

Great Recipe I made this for dinner yesterday and my family loved it. They loved it so much there wasn't any left for dinner Monday. I  marinated my meat over night. I seasoned with salt, black pepper, meat tenderizer (lightly) and garlic power. The meat turned out very tender.

Very tasty! I should have added more cornstarch because I would like it a little thicker. The rosemary adds a nice taste. Very pleased, will make again!

P.S. I forgot to add the celery, will try again with that. And also I used 'no salt added' beef stock instead of bullion cubes.

My husband appreciated my lower sodium effort.

This  is  a FANTASTIC recipe! I did add 1 cup red wine and floured the meat prior to browning, did 4 pounds of beef to make a bigger  amount, and added the splashes of ketchup, Worcestersire and steak sauce, no salt, cuz  of the bouillon cubes and never needed the cornstarch, also added sweet potato to the red potatos, do need to add additional carrots tomorrow, but I'm telling you this was REALLY GOOD!

WOW! This is the best beef stew recipe I've ever tried! Like some other reviewers I wasn't sure about the rosemary but it made this stew. The flavor was fabulous! My picky brother said over and over it was THE best he's ever eaten and he's rather fussy. He loved it. He's never complimented anything I've made so much! This is a KEEPER! Thanks so much for posting!

This is my new favorite beef stew recipe! I did make a few changes like tossing the beef cubes with flour, salt, pepper, and garlic powder before browning them. I omitted the onions and celery because my husband doesn't like them and added a couple more potatoes. I left everything else the same and the combination of seasonings was very good. The only thing I would do differently if I was only going to cook it as long as recommended is cut the amount of liquid. I cooked mine longer than 2 hours and still had to add more cornstarch and cook it without the lid for the last 20 minutes or so to get it to thicken up. I think 3 cups of liquid would have been plenty.

After reading the recipes and seeing the great reviews, I made this beef stew. It didn't call for salt but I added it anyway, thinking it was overlooked. But, the result was that it was too salty. So, I suggest you follow the recipe as written.

I enjoyed this stew recipe.  I used it for leftovers that I had on hand: prime rib and roasted potatoes. I added them after I cooked the carrots, celery and onion.  Also used fresh thyme and parsley that I had on hand in place of the dried herbs.

Note: Made this again using another reviewers recs. Coat the meat in 1/4 cup flour, 1 tsp garlic powder and onion powder, and 1/2 tsp pepper. Cook in large pot. Add garlic. Add 1/2 cup wine to broth. Cook 1 hour. Add I Tbsp ketchup and Worcestershire sauce with vegetables. Cook for another 2-3 hours until potatoes are soft.

I make this over and over again, I do add a quarter cup of red wine to it though. It's lovely without as well, I prefer it with the wine. Maybe it because I get to finish the bottle...

I love the recommendations of adding 1 Tblsp each of A-1, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce.  I also tend to use a bit less beef (1.5 pounds), and cut up the cubes smaller.  Excellent recipe.  A new regular in rotation at my house.  Mushrooms are another good veggie addition.

We decided to do it as a crock pot meal. Cooked 6 hours on low. No adjustments made. Just didn't have corn starch, served over rice and it was great!

First time making a stew, followed Chuck's tips and the stew turned out wonderful! We added about 2 cups of wine, made do without the corn starch by mashing some of the potatoes and the results were wonderful! Good consistency. Allow about 3-4 hours for the crock pot to simmer and the meat should be tender.

I have made quite of few recipes from this website but this is my first review. I felt the need to share my opinion because this is excellent!! I did make a couple small changes. I added 1 carrot and one potato. I also took the suggestion from another reviewer and replaced one of the cups of water with a cup of red cooking wine and I am so glad I did! I also added a packet of Lipton Onion soup and let it summer for the last hour. It was so flavorful and delicious. There were no leftovers to be found and my kids are pretty big critics!

I thought this was really good and extremely easy. The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly. The second time I made a couple adjustments... I added in more beef boullion and more cornstarch. It was pretty thin, more like a broth when I made it the first time. I also added quinoa at the end to make it healthier...any grain is good to add...

Awesome stew. I did increase the cornstarch (6 tsp instead of 2) based on some other recommendations. It was great and my 6 year old boy loved it also, even having it for leftovers for a couple of nights afterward.

Really great stew!! I made a couple amendments just to my family's tastes - I added mushrooms, and a few sausages along with the stew beef.  I also used Wondra instead of cornstarch and doubled (my family likes stew very thick). I added a pinch of gravy master as well. Turned out fabulous! Will make again!!

Mmmmm . . . yummy! I followed the recipe pretty close, but I am baffled by the use of water and then so many bouillon cubes. I simply omitted the cubes and used low sodium beef broth in place of the water. I also left out the rosemary (never could acquire a taste for that herb) and added in three cloves of minced garlic that I sauteed with the beef along with the onion. Once in a while, for variety, I will also add a can of fire roasted tomatoes and then I will also add in some basil. Yum!! The amount of corn starch you add is up to you. If you like your stew a bit on the thin side, then use the amount called for. If you like it a bit thicker, add more corn starch. Easy peasy!! :-) But I do not add my corn starch until about the last fifteen minutes of cooking time, not one hour before as stated in the recipe.

Very good taste, I was in the mood for soup, so I did not add the cornstarch, a little red wine, more rosemary and parsley. And it was great!

Was not impressed. Would have not returned if I had ordered this at a restaurant. Gravy too thin, not tasty, no special taste and I love a good beef stew.

I thought this recipe was terrific, and agree that reviews should be based on the recipe as is, not altered.  However, I made just a few minor changes.  I browned the beef, then browned the onion, and carrots one after the other in the same skillet.  Scraped the drippings, put in liquid beef stock and enough water, added the spices, heated to dissolve the drippings. Didn't brown the potatoes, but probably will next time. I used red potatoes, not peeled. The big difference was that I put everything in a crockpot and cooked it for about 4 hours.  Delicious, tender meat, and great gravy.  I added a little browning sauce to the gravy.  My husband loved it.  Rosemary is key!

First of all, I am not a big fan of beef stew.  Now, on to the review.  This was the absolute BEST beef stew EVER!  I did use the suggested 1/2 cup of red wine (I used Pinot Noir) to replace 1/2 cup of water, and that is the only change I made.  My family and I LOVED it!  Even my picky teenage daughter went back for seconds!  The gravy in this stew is just fantastic:  the best I have ever tasted.  If you want to improve your beef stew, switch to THIS receipe!!

This was the first time I've ever made beef stew, and I don't think I'll be using another recipe again.  The flavors were rich and very aromatic.  I had a lot leftover and froze some. I ate both times with crusty bread - simply wonderful. I ended up using a little bit more cornstarch than the recipe called for because the original amount did not make it thick enough.

This was fantastic! I used a chuck roast that I cut up myself.  I added 1/2 cup of red wine and 1 Tbsp each A1, Worcestershire, and Catsup to the broth and beef.  I also added five times (10 tsp) the amount of corn starch.  Next time I will use less potatoes and more carrots.  Great recipe.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.

Absoultely Best Stew Ever.  Very tasty and you could cut the meat with a fork.  Everyone loved it.   Definately 5 stars.  The only change I made was I used 4 cups low sodium veg. stock instead of 4 bouillon cubes (too salty) This is my new stew recipe forever.   cueball.

I made this recipe but rather than using water I used beef consommé. I also thickened the stew with instant mashed potato flakes.  They add more flavor; just be careful to not add too much at one time as it will clump.

This was my first time making stew and I loved it.  I took other's suggestions and mixed the meat in a flour mixture as said, but used minced garlic since I didn't have the powder.  I also didn't have cornstarch but used a bit of flour for that part, left the celery out since my kids ate it all and ran out.  It was perfect.  Next time though, I'll cut the potatoes into a bit smaller pieces so they'd cook just a tad bit faster, but it was great.  The flavor was awesome.  Not too much, not to little.  Will definitely make again, especially in winter for a quick and great dinner.

I didn't have bullion so I used vegetable stock and a bit of red wine.  Otherwise followed to a tee, and there was still lots of flavour

Since I've found this recipe I've used it twice and both times the stew came out great.  It's easy to make and I would definitely recommend this recipe to a friend.  On the second go around I did tweak it a bit using fresh cilantro. I can't wait to try the other beef stew recipes.

This receipe is absolutely wonderful Paula.  Thank you for sharing.  I made a few changes from all the reviews, and used Beef broth instead of boullion cubes, and then added the catsup, Wirceshire sauce and A1 Sauce.  It is wonderful.  I also added garlic powder and a little fresh thyme.  Great Dinner.

We tried this recipe about a week ago, I didn't follow directions and missed simmering the corn starch for an hour. Ours was soup like, but tasted great. Going to try it again tonight and see if I can follow the directions this time, but adding Barley to it.

I made this with venison instead of beef. I floured the meat with garlic powder, onion flakes, and pepper before browning as others have suggested. I didn't use bouillon cubes since they have msg, I used better than bouillon and that worked great. I added a little fresh parsley at the end with the rosemary. I only had flour to thicken since I was out of cornstarch. This is a great low-sodium stew recipe.

The first time that I made this recipe, I followed the recipe to a "T" for half of the recipe ingredients and it was quite good but too salty because of the bouillon. The last time that I made this, I made a roux out of the pan drippings and flour then I mixed in 2 cups of cold beef broth to make a darker and richer tasting gravy. Again, I made half of the recipe and added an 8 ounce can of diced tomatoes to the pot and a large bay leaf before simmering the beef. The acidity of the tomatoes helped tenderize the beef during the simmer time. I didn't use dried parsley, but rather I offered freshly snipped Italian parsley to the diners to top their serving of stew with.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I used mini golden butter potatoes, you dont have to peel them and they are buttery delicious and keep their shape. I season the meat prior to browning with what i had on hand, salt, pepper, dried basil, thyme. Sooo good!! thank you for this recipe

Very good but next time I will add more vegetables, spices, and cornstarch as recommended by other reviewers.  I will also use red potatoes instead of russet because my russet potatoes got way too mushy.  I think some baby corn ears would also be a nice addition.

Overall, a very good recipe! I thought the rosemary was a very nice touch. The broth was still a little watery for my taste - even after using triple the amount of cornstarch... so if you like a thicker broth with your stew, I would suggest using 5X the amount of cornstarch (or more). I may also try seasoning the stew meat prior to browning just to give it a little extra flavor. Other than that, the stew was a success! Will definitely be making it again in the future!  - Krista

I am new to cooking. I asked my wife what she wanted for dinner. I told her to pick anything. She said Homemade Beef Stew. I was worried. I never made it. This recipe made it simple. The only difference I did was to add meat tenderizer before cooking the meat. My wife said I out did myself. Thanks.

Quadrupled corn starch.  Maybe I will cook without the lid next time to thicken the broth.  Nevertheless, we really enjoyed this stew.  We made it vegetarian and that may have effected the "thickness".  Used tofu chunks and mushrooms in place of the beef.  Hey, try it, you'll like it!

Simply delicious! I like a "juicier" stew so added a little more beef stock when done to reach desired consistency.  Add garlic.  I also cook the stew until the potatoes are falling apart, then they thicken the stew so the cornstarch isn't needed.  Best madrasah ahead so flavors can mingle overnightt. Double the batch and freeze half for. Delicious no-hassle dinner later.  Yum!

For personal preference and to make it healthier (no salt from bullion); I added more of each of the spices indicated, especially pepper. I used a 'soup bone' which had enough really good meat on it, and no silly bullion. And no cornstarch. Simmered on lowest possible setting with no lid for at least 12 hours (had to add water sometimes). Very good flavor, and healthy!

ZING!!! this is excellent..Followed exact with the addition of 1/2c red wine, a heaping Tbsp garlic, threw in extra veggies (red potato, carrots, celery, onion, frozen mixed veggies) and put in crock pot on low all day. Super tasty and tender..served with Martins potato rolls and real butter...YASSSAHHH! MY preference is to use beef base instead of bouillon cubes.

Wow!  This is the BEST stew I've ever had. The gravy came out so flavorful and delicious. The only thing I did differently was use tender chuck steak (cut into chunks).  As other users suggested, I put the meat in a ziploc pag with 1/4 cup flour and about a tablespoon each of garlic and onion powder, shook it up and then browned.  I cooked a little over 2 hours, and the meat was fall-apart tender, the vegetables were perfect and not mushy.  I can't wait to have this for lunch today.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Wow! Better than mom's. Very pleased @ how this turned out. I come from an Italian town, so I added Italian Seasoning in addition to everything else. Awesome flavor. This will be MY beef stew from now on.

FANTASTIC!  I used Angus beef chuck cubes and basically followed the recipe adding worcestershire sauce in step 1.  I used extra vegetables which caused me to add more bouillon and water.   I kept adding until the veggies were covered with broth.  After the veggies were tender, I added the cornstarch gradually until it was the consistency I desired.  This stew was "knock your socks off good"!  It is going in my recipe book and will see a lot of use.  Thank you Paula for sharing such a FANTASTIC recipe!

Fantastic! I always tweak any recipe I use to fit my families personal taste, but I honestly only made one tweak to this one and it was fantastic!! I don't like the taste of Rosemary so I simply omitted it and used bay leaf instead. This is my new stew recipe.

This stew was great! Takes a little time but it's super easy. I added half a cup of red wine in place of half a cup of water and also some extra cornstarch as some other reviewers recommended. Otherwise I didn't change a thing. The broth was so rich and flavorful and the meat was very tender. My hubby loved it! Will make again, thanks,

This was my first attempt at stew and we LOVED it!  Thanks for a great recipe.  I only made 2 changes.  I substituted a cup of beer for one of the cups of water and I added a couple of bay leaves.  Oh and I did follower other reviewers advice and coated the meat in flour and garlic powder before browning.

I make this recipe with some changes.  I flour my meat before I brown it using seasonings of your choice.  And for the luquid I add quite a bit of red wine...half a bottle or so.  The alcohol cooks out and the wine helps to tenderize the meat.  Rather than beef bouillon cubes I flavor the cooking water with Kitchen Bouquiet or B-V broth and sauce concentrate along with some worstershire.  I would give a measurement but I am a seat of my pants cook who tastes and adds.  I also use app. 2tsps of marjoram which is a nice beef seasoning.  I get raves for my stew using this basic recipe.

I made a double batch of this for a sledding party yesterday and everyone commented they thought it was great.  I added extra cornstarch because I like a thicker gravy, but all other ingredients were the same. I cooked the stew on the stove until it was done and then moved it to a crock pot to keeep it warm until we were ready to eat.

This was such a flavorful stew! I ended up adding 1/2 cup red cooking wine to my broth, and also another cup water and tsp boullion. We had company over when I made this, and everyone loved it! They left asking for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again; it's a wonderful recipe for cold, winter evenings.

YUM! I usually cook stew in the crock pot but did not have enough time to throw it in this afternoon.  I found this recipe very easy and flavorful.  It was light and not as starchy as crock pot stews. Hubby LOVED it!! I was out of dried rosemary so I used fresh which made the kitchen smell amazing.

This was wonderful! I tossed the meat in flour like some reviewers recommended. I couldn't believe how well it turned out!

I loved it of course cause it was all homemade!!
**You can substitute arrowroot powder for cornstarch.**
My husband liked it as did my older children and my 1 yr old.  
The meat was soo tender..oh by the way I used beef arm roast cut into cubes.  
I substituted arrowroot powder for cornstarch...For a thicker sauce, next time I will use 1 cup of arrowroot mixed in 1 cup of cold water.  Make sure to completely mix in the arrowroot mixture in the broth.  Play around with the amount of arrowroot.  Maybe start out with 1/2 cup of arrowroot and water first ( that is what I used and I wished that I would have used double the amount of arrowroot.

We loved this beef stew! For some reason, I always thought making beef stew would be quite complicated- but it wasn't- this is an easy & tasty recipe that has gone into my "dinner staples" recipe collection.

I hesitate to review this because I made a few adjustments, ( most out of necessity)   but boy, was this good!  

Like others suggested,  I coated the meat with a little flour and some seasonings (garlic powder, pepper, minced onion and a little seasoning salt) and browned in my stew pot. I didn't have bullion cubes, so I used a packet of brown gravy mix instead. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a packet of onion soup mix.  No cornstarch, so I used flour as a thickener. No fresh veggies,  but I did have a package of frozen stew vegetables, so I added those in with about 1/2 hour - 45 min to go.

Very, very good.

A good basic recipe.  I made it exactly the way it's listed but I thought it was a little bland.  So I got to doctoring... a few splashes of worchestershire sauce, a bit of heavy cream, and a little more corn starch mixture to thicken it some more.

I am breaking my diet to eat this and I am glad that I am. It is not even off of the stove yet and it tastes amazing. It will need a few more pinches of salt but, I am smitten. Even if you make changes to the original recipe this is a great way to get started.

VERY GOOD!! I added 1 more potato, a little more rosemary, added garlic powder to beef when browning, and added squeeze garlic. Had to 5x the amount of cornstarch to make it a light gravy consistency. would add more carrots next time. I am not a beef stew person because I can't stand chewy meat but this was sooo tender and I wiped the bowl clean!! I will def have this again and again this winter!!!

I followed this recipe almost to the letter, and I can say that it is VERY good. I hate when people change a bunch of stuff and then rate their changes along with the recipe...it doesn't give an accurate picture of what the recipe is really like. The only thing I changed was dredging the beef in a flour mixture before browning. I think this helped with thickening the stew, but otherwise I found it unnecessary. Very good recipe for a hearty beef stew that the whole family loved. We WILL be making this again!

I just made this for dinner. A-mazing! I did end up dredging the beef in flour and garlic powder. I also added some more water to make it more soupy. The large serving size is great because I can freeze portions for two and take them out for another dreary day.

Everyone loved it! Even husband who thought HIS stew was the best, has now bowed out! I did as someone suggested and dredged in a seasoned flour before browning meat, added just a touch of red wine while deglazing, and cut the rosemary down because I personally dont care for it. I also added the tbl of ketchup, worchestershire & A-1 sauce too. It really was turned out great! THe only bad thing is now this is the only kind the family wants!! lol

Really one of the best stews I have ever made. I used Beef Soup Base instead of Bouillon, so I needed a bit of salt and I used sea salt. I did flour and season in a ziplock bag and then browned in a stainless steel pan and used wine to deglaze. I too, added catsup, worcestershire , but I also added a bay leaf.  Taste it and figure out what it needs, it was great! oh yes prep took me longer than 20min. cause I cut my own stew meat from a chuck roast so I could be sure and not have too much fat.

This is the easiest beef stew recipe I have made.  I did not have any celery, so I used celery seeds instead and could not tell a difference.  I also did not put the whole teaspoon of dried rosemary in.  I thought it might be to strong a flavor. I was very satisfied with the 1/2 teaspoon of rosemary I used.  I will make this recipe again!

This was absolutely the best beef stew I have ever tasted!  I added parsnips since my husband loves them.  Also, I was running short on time, so I only simmered the beef and stock for 45 minutes and simmered for 45 minutes w/the veggies and potatoes and it still turned out great - and cut 30 mins off of the cook time.  I definitely recommend this recipe!

Very yummy! Meat was extremely tender and delicious. I had to add 2 more cups of water half-way through cooking, as well as a 15oz can of tomato sauce because there wasn't a lot of moisture. I ran out of cornstarch, so I added 8 tsps of flour and the consistency is wonderful. WILL have this stew again!

Great stew~!  I doubled the broth/veggie/spice.  Added salt and pepper and put in russets in the last 30 min and it turned out perfect!  Also doubled the corn starch and it was delish!

I have made this so many times its one of my husbands favorite meals! Now I hate rating a meal that I have changed a bit im sure this is really good just the way it is but adding a few things makes it amazing. I only use 1 pound of stew meat we use organic so its just cheaper and works just as well. I season it with a little garlic powder and pepper and I dont use the flower. I sear it then add about 1/4 cup of red wine(trader joes1 buck chuck) I just add a little less water. I use peeled red or yellow potatoes they dont get mushy. Sometimes I dont even need to thicken it.

I threw this all together in my slowcooker and it was amazing! I couldn't get it to thicken, but it didn't need it, just mashed the potatoes a bit and was fine. I did use beef broth as was out of beef boulliion, but it was still amazing. I'll have to try this again when I have time to do the actual cooking and not use my slow cooker.

I was very apprehensive of this recipe when I started. I wasn't sure if the beef would come out tender and I was worried about the flavor being bland. However, I was wonderfully suprised at how well it turned out! I halved the recipe, added garlic powder, more pepper, and used beer for the liquid and it turned out delicious. I will for sure make this again and again. GREAT RECIPE!

I made this recipe just like the directions say, no alterations. It is delicious!  My whole family ate it and there were no leftovers.  They all requested that I make it again.  It was so easy too.  This was my first stew.  I will use this recipe over and over again.

Overall very flavorful thanks to the beef's infusion in the broth. I'd probably give this 4*s, but mom would not stop raving about this.  Two corrections, cut the amount of potatoes (I used 5 small after i cut the recipe in half, because 5 was 1/3 of a 5 lb bag making it 1.6 lbs and after I weighed 1 large potato in store it was 1.1lbs). I'll cut that to 2 lbs of potatoes or so. And increase the carrot count from 2 up to 2.5 and the water account from 2 to 2.5. I like it soupier and love carrots.  As for the spices, I had no dried parsley, so i subbed for 1/4 t dried basil, 1/4 t italian seasoning. I really want to experiment with what brings out the best flavors in the beef. More rosemary would probably be enough to do the trick; don't mess with it too much because it's good enough as I did it to get 5*s.

I loved it. I did follow the suggestions by others - adding the vinegar, and the sauces to give it a more robust flavor (ketchup, A-1, and worcestershire). I have made it for my family, and have dropped it off for a new mom. Rave reviews - every time!

Fantastic stew.  Just from looking at the ingredients I knew I'd want extra flavour, during the browning of the beef I added a little less than a cup of red wine.  I also replaced one of the cups of water with a cup of dark beer.  The stew turned out amazing, I did add some diced yellow peppers to add more veggies.  The meat was ridiculously tender, perfect cook times.

I expected a little more after all the great reviews.  It was okay, a little thin for my taste. I had to cook the potatoes and carrots about 45 minutes longer than the recipe stated in order for them to get nice and soft. I'd probably try a different recipe before making this one again.

Delicious and easy. I did make some slight changes: Tossed the meat with flour seasoned with salt, pepper, and garlic powder prior to browning; added a bay leaf, minced garlic clove, and a pinch each of thyme and tarragon; added more onions! Very good!

The whole family loved it! I followed the suggestion of another poster, and dredged the beef in flour with onion powder, garlic powder and pepper. Also added 1/2 cup of red wine.  It was so good!  Thank you!  It's a keeper.

Easy & tasty, just the ticket for me. I followed a lot of the other commenters and doubled the cornstarch, and also added the 1 tbsp each of ketchup, A-1 & worcestershire per Chuck's notes.

Excellant taste and flavour.  I followed the recipe and holy stew Batman!  I added more flaours like roasted garlic, and used dried basil (not too much-surprise surprise), 1 tbsp, 1/4 tsp cumin.  AWESOME.  Thanks Paula!  Keep up the great recipe.

Very good beef stew!  I do, however, have some problems with this recipe.  This made very little broth, so I would double it next time.  And the vegetables don’t need a whole hour to cook.  At one hour my onions had disintegrated to almost nothing and the other vegetables were pretty mushy.  I would check them next time after 30 minutes.   The broth is very thin and the amount of cornstarch indicated wasn’t nearly enough to thicken it.  I think I tripled the cornstarch and the broth was still on the thin side, but thick enough for us, but perhaps not thick enough for others.  I will definitely make this again, but will modify it to our liking.

First time I have ever tried a stove top beef stew. Meat was so tender and had nice subtle flavors with the rosemary. Added more cornstarch to be thicker but otherwise followed exactly. Very good. Husband loved it!

I made this just as the recipe advised, adjusting quantities because I had less beef. A bit of flour dusting on the beef before sauteeing. The meat was tender and the whole stew was just delicious.

This is good, it's better than bland but it's not fantastic, usually I give 4 stars for this type of recipe but it was good enough to be over the line. I tried adding ketchup, A1 and worstershire like first commenter suggested and it still felt like it was missing something. My mom says to add brown gravy packet, and I think that could have done the trick. Overall tasty though.

Yes!  This is the beef stew recipe I have been looking for!  LOVE the rosemary.  Just a few minor changes: used olive oil, added a couple cloves of minced garlic, used red potatoes (unpeeled) since they seem to keep their shape better, and added 2 Tbsp cornstarch (mixed with 2 Tbsp water).  Absolutely delicious.  This is my new go-to recipe for beef stew and I will be using it a lot during the winters!

Excellent stew! I by changed it slightly by seasoning the meat with Sazon and browing it first with olive oil then adding 1 cup of red wine. I used beef broth and 2 tblsp of fresh garlic.  I also added about 3 tblsp of A1 sauce to kick it up with about 3 dashes of cayenne pepper.  I added cilantro and omitted rosemary.  Fabulous.

Mmmmmm!! How wonderful! I had been stubbornly sticking to my same-old beef stew recipe for years and decided to try something new. I won't look back. This does something very special to the meat, and the gravy and seasoning is fantastic. Thanks!

This was a hit at home! Because I didn't have cornstarch, I shook 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp salt and meat chunks together in a ziplock bag, and then browned it. I added an extra 2 tsp directly to the pot, as done with the cornstarch. It was great! I want to try this recipe again to decide whether the cornstarch or the flour is better.

It is a good base, but for flavour, one needs to add more things, so I can't give it more than 3 stars. It is a 5 in how easy it is to make

This stew was delicious!  We added a 1/2 cup quick cooking barley, and an extra cup of water.   The only reason we added the barley was so that we could mimic the ingredients in the book "Stone Soup"  I also told the kids the cornstarch and water was milk so it would be just like the story.  The kids loved it!

So good! I plan to make this again next time I make stew! I left out the boullion (didn't have any) and the constarch (for allergy reasons). It was still fantastic! I let the beef simmer for an hour (as directed) then put all the the ingredients in. I then let it simmer for a good part of the afternoon. The beef was incredibly tender.

Great beef stew. It had just a unique flavor.  I did take other's advice and put the beef in a big zip lock bag with flour, garlic & onion powder before putting in the pan. I then deglazed with 1 cup red wine--it added such a nice flavor.  I also added butternut squash to the mix of veggies I added. The "Cheddar Bay Biscuits" from this site were a nice addition to this meal.  The only thing I will do differently next time is wait until the last 30 minutes of cooking to add the veggies.  They got way too mushy for my taste.

This is a GREAT base recipe.  The process and timing are spot on.  It is a great as is or substitution recipe.  I used 2 cups of beef stock and 2 cups of beef broth instead of the bullion but I am sure it would have been delicious as is.  After an hour I deglazed with about a 1/3 cup of red wine then added the veggies and cornstarch mixture.  I also added a bay leaf for good measure.  This is a fun recipe to play with.  I will use it to invent other "flavors" of beef stew.  Using the timing provided, the beef and veggies were perfect!  Rave reviews and subtle hints for another batch soon were abundant.  Yummy!

Very good, easy beef stew. I added about 1/4 c. red wine vinegar which brightened the flavor. And I added a little bit of thyme. I served it with homemade drop biscuits. Delicious! My husband, friend, and friend's 1-year old all loved it.

I, too, browned the beef coated in flour and garlic powder, added a dash of Worcestershire sauce, omitted the corn starch, added a potato and some mushrooms, and then used the slow cooker, high for 4 hours. It was delicious with tender meat, and we dipped home-baked bread into the sauce. Fantastic recipe.

Although this was very flavorful, it didn't have the exact flavor I was hoping for. I followed other's advice and coated the beef in the flour/pepper/garlic- the meat turned out wonderful! I also added the tbsps of ketchup, worcestershire, and I didn't have A-1 so I used Dale's low sodium steak seasoning. I do think those things helped the flavor. I also tripled the cornstarch to make it thicker! The thing I didn't like most about this stew was probably the rosemary. I love rosemary, but it's just not the flavor I was looking for in my stew. Also if I make this again I will decrease the pepper a bit. Even with the bouillon it turned out a bit bland, which is confusing to me b/c there is so much sodium in it! Oh well. All in all a good stew, but lacking something. I'm still looking for my perfect stew recipe...

I love this stew! I tried several recipes trying to find one that resembled a stew I remember from when I was a kid, and this one was *exactly* what I was looking for! Very easy to make, and the flavors are wonderful. The only change I made was I used flour instead of cornstarch to thicken the stew because I like that consistency better, but I don't think it changed the flavor any.

Great base recipe! I did follow recommendations to dredge meat in flour and spice mixture before cooking. I also used a can of 50% less sodium beef broth and supplemented with sodium free beef bullion and water.  My husband and I like things spicy, so I did my own thing with the herbs and spices of this recipe. Mostly, I added black pepper, crushed red pepper, cayenne pepper and cumin.  I halved this recipe and served with my favorite biscuits - J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits - from this site. It made a great dinner! Will definitely make again.

As it makes no sense to rate a recipe based on changing all the ingredients, I made this as per the recipe.

Personal preference for me would have been a thicker stew, but I learned to love this one.

The bouillon cubes made it way too salty for my tastes, I wouldn't use those again.

I did like the celery and I love rosemary.

This was a fantastic recipe and so easy!  I too tossed the meat into a bag with seasonings and flour and it turned out very flavorful.  On a tip from a friend I cooked the potatoes in a separate pan and added it once everything was done.  It kept the starches out of the meat so it was very tender.  I also added a bay leaf to the stew and a little bit more water.

I left out the cornstarch because I thought the flour from browning the meat thickened it up enough.  I added 2 cloves and a bay leaf.  I only cooked it 1 hour and 15 minutes with the veggies in the whole time.  The meat was still very tender and the stew was perfect!

I cannot say enough about this recipe. My family was asking for stew, and I tried this since had so many positive ratings. The only thing I changed was I added a can of mushrooms with the juice, since my family likes mushrooms. I have never made stew before and cannot believe how even my picky boy loved it. I thought we would have tons of leftovers, but everyone had 2 servings (except my husband who had 3rds). I made with a loaf of baked french bread. THANK YOU for sharing We will be making again this week!!!

I had never made beef stew before....but I have to say that this recipe is really good. I coated the meat with garlic powder and pepper and I didn't have any rosemary so I threw in a pinch of thyme.  It turned out really good.  I will definitly make this again!

Excellent stew!  After reading reviews made a couple of suggested changes.  Coated beef with flour, garlic powder and pepper before browning.  Used beef broth instead of bullion. Had no wine in house (teenagers!)so grabbed a little single serve bottle of cabernet and tossed that in. Used flour to thicken. Delicious!!!!

Very good standard recipe.  Just got done eating!  I used 4tbs of corn starch and water and still could have been much thicker.  I like thick stews.  This is a classic dish with fresh, clean flavors.  I will add to it next time like some suggested.  It's a great baseline as listed.

Good! Definitely take time to coat the meat in flour before you brown. I added a bay leaf, a bit of cumin, tomato paste and worchestershire.

This stew is great and have made it 3 times in 2 months! I deglazed the pan with red wine about a 1/2 a cup and added one bay leaf. Oh and I added an additional carrot and stalk of celery. I just recently made it with venison for my husband and brother-in-law. They loved it!!

Paula thank-you so much for this recipe - it was excellent!  I did make a few changes.  I tossed my beef in 1/4 cup flour, 1tsp garlic powder, 1tsp black pepper and pinch of salt before frying (because I added pepper here I didn't add it with the other spices). I used red potatoes with the skin on (I find they don't go mushy no matter how long you cook em') and 5tsp of cornstarsh.  I found 5 tsp of cornstarsh still only produced a soup like consistancy - next time (and there will be many more) I will use closer to 3 tablespoons.  This was such a tasty recipe - the cooking time - perfect!  The beef - so tender!  Excellent recipe!  Perfect for a cold winters night!

I had never made stew before and thought I would give this recipe a try -- it was wonderful!  I did, however, take a few suggestions offered on other reviews. I used Better than Buillon instead of buillon cubes, used one cup of red cooking wine in place of a cup of water, added some fresh garlic and upped the cornstarch to make a thicker broth.  This is a recipe I will use again and again.  :)

This Recipe is soooo good!!! The first time I made it I cooked everything together for about an hour and 15 mins, to cut down on time, the second time I made it I followed everything exactly and it was a million times better, the meat is way more tender, definitley worth the time!!!! Can't wait to make it for mom, she will be so impressed!!!

This is excellent.  I will never make my old stew again!  A wonderful flavor and the meat was so tender.  I made it exactly as it's written (I like to do that the first time I try a recipe) but might add more cornstarch the next time to make it a little thicker.  Even my kids ate this!
The second time I made this, I was out of cornstarch so I made a flour thickening to thicken the soup.  Don't do this.  It kind of ruins the taste!

This was so good!  I also tossed the beef cubes (I used a kosher brisket, which I cut up myself) with flour, salt and pepper.  I used Better then Bouilion, vegetable base rather then cubes.  I also was using left over relish tray veggies, so I had baby carrots (which I cut into thirds) and celery sticks (which I chopped).  I was using small white potatoes and onions so I had to estimate sizes.  Once I had added the veggies, I realized that I needed more broth so I added 4 more cups of water and four more teaspoons of BTB.  I used 6 teaspoons of cornstarch, which thickened the broth a tiny bit but not a lot.  If you want a very thick stew, I would double or triple the amount for sure.  All in all, extremely tasty.  I served mine with cheese biscuits (recipie in the Fanny Farmer cookbook).

5 stars all the way! The flavor the rosemary gives this is fantastic. We loved this! My guests raved over this dish and went back for seconds. Easy to do, prep was the most work, after that it's all just dumping it into the pot and waiting. I cooked the onion in when I browned the meat, added about 1 1/2 tsp of Kitchen Bouquet(browning sauce), and about a tsp of msg. I did add 2 T more cornstarch and 2 T more water the last thirty min, to thicken it some more. I've made this twice now, and it's so flavorful!!! This is a great one for picky eaters (like me) because there aren't any tomatoes to pick out. Hee hee. Even better than Mom's! Sorry, Mom...

THE BEST!!  This looked like a typical beef stew recipe when I came across it but decided to try it because of the high ratings - what a good decision.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written and won't change a thing next time except to double the recipe!  My five year old son ate three helpings!

I loved this recipe!!!!!It was easy and wonderfullly tasty!!!The only thing I changed, as another person suggested was that I seasoned the meat with garlic powder and pepper before I browned it, I added red wine in with the broth and I doubled the cornstarch. Also I didn't have celery on hand, but it still turned out soooooo good!!!!! Thank you very much for the recipe!!!!!!

This really hit the spot - rich and hearty. I coated the beef in flour, garlic powder and oregano before browning. I found this awfully heavy on the meat. I added two more potatoes, but next time I would also add two more carrots and a can of corn. Thanks!

With other peoples suggestions floured the meat, used canned beef broth and doubled the spices and used with red wine. 

This was an awesome stew, I will definitely be making it again. My only "beef" was that it didn't freeze to well. I will omit the cornstarch next time and use flour maybe that will solve it.

Thanks for the recipe !

Great comfort food. I coated the beef with flour, salt, pepper and dried rosemary and fried in olive oil until just browned. Then threw it in the pot with everything else (except potatoes) and simmered for 1 hour. Served with mashed potatoes. Delicious.

Big hit in our house! This is the only way I make stew now.  The only variation that we make is that we leave out celery (just because of our tastes) and we add corn. 
Great recipie!

This was good but a little bland.  I followed the recipe exactly, so next time will add some more/different seasonings.  I also will try to thicken it up more next time.

I really loved this stew, as did my roommates.  I added more celery and carrots than called for, and omitted the onion. I also added a tsp of minced garlic and tossed in a few cups of frozen corn toward the end.  I substituted thyme for the parsley since I realized i was out.  This is a great one pot comfort food.  I'll definitely be making this again.

This was really easy to make for rather inexperienced cooks.  I added more cornstarch and water to make a thicker gravy.  Delicious!!!  Thank you!

The first time I made this recipe I was out of beef bouillon so I used a combination of chicken broth and chicken bouillon. I was also out of dried Rosemary so I used Italian Seasonings. I brought it to the potluck and everyone thought it was great! It was great! Then, I made it the next time using the recipe as posted, and it was rather plain and disappointing. Overall, the recipe is easy to make and the meat turns out tasty...but I will stick to chicken broth from now on.

OMG!  This smelled awesome while it was cooking.  My only complaint was that I prefer a thicker stew and even with the cornstarch it wasn't quite as thick as I would have liked.  The taste however more than made up for it and now I'll know for next time because we will definitely be making this again and again!

This stew was fantastic.  I cut my potatoes into a fairly small dice because I wanted to make sure they cooked through (I had forgotten to add them with the rest of the veggies) and they ended up breaking up and thickening the stew so I didn't even need to add the cornstarch.  I will do this again when I make it next time! My husband says that this is the best stew I have ever made.

This is a great recipe because it's easy to customize, and easy to prepare. Tweak it the way you like it, and you won't be disappointed. For instance, I left out the rosemary, parsley, and celery. I added fresh thyme (chopped fine), and used seasoned flour to coat the meat before browning, and also to help thicken the stew. It's all about personal preference, and this one's a winner!
Thanks Paula

This stew is incredibly tasty. I used what I had on hand. Instead of bouillon cubes, I added 4 cups of real beef stock to begin and also added one breast of chicken to the meat. I had no parsley and no celery, but still PERFECT!! Just add whatever veggies you have as this recipe is a winner. I also wanted a thicker stew, so I added more plain flour and used the potato masher to squash the veggies up a bit more. I have frozen the rest for baby food over the holiday. Care free cuisine!!

I made this wonderful stew and served it in a "bowl" of acorn squash.   I cooked the squash in the oven first, then ladeled the stew in.  It adds a sweetness to the stew and was an edible bowl.

WOW - Really good.  Yes I tampered with it.  Added some red wine and garlic.  It stands on its own, so no noodles or rice are needed.  I cut the beef into no larger than 3/4 to an inch pieces.  Cutting the veggies to a one inch consistency made it perfect.  This dish turned out tender and savory.  The rosemary is just the right touch to this easy and flavorful recipe.  I used a tad more cornstarch to give it a less liquidy consistency.

AWESOME RECIPE! *BEST* beef stew I've ever had. Used additional cornstarch because we like our stew a little thicker and added a bit of Worcesteshire sauce to taste for a little kick.

Would absolutely make it again.

this was an easy beef stew dish but i quit using boullion cubes because it was way too salty, try this dish with homeade beef broth or beef base. chicken and beef base can be difficult to find at most stores but you can find it on the internet if all else fails. used twice the amount of cornstarch, 4 toes of fresh garlic, 6 ears of fresh scraped corn and 3 bay leaves along with the other vegetables.

I don't usually follow recipes, but the reviews for this stew were all so good that I decided to stick to the recipe as closely as possible. And it was great! I didn't think it needed the cornstarch and I didn't have celery. Excellent recipe, and very easy. Thanks!

WOW was the meat ever tender in this stew! I have never made beef stew that the beef turned out so tender. My husband loved it and so did my son, I did too! I didn't have cornstarch so I used flour and added it to the meat before adding the veggies. I also added peas to it just for extra veggies for my family. Thanks for such a great recipe. This one is a keeper for sure!

Great basic stew recipe. I had to halve it as I only had a pound of beef on hand; didn't have rosemary or parsley on hand, either. I replaced 1/2 c of the water with red wine; added about a tablespoon of Worcestershire and a few shakes of celery salt and dried thyme to the broth, plus a couple whole peeled garlic cloves, cracked black and white pepper, and dried red bell pepper pieces for some extra color. 
I served this with Bisquick drop biscuits and butter. I had to stop my husband from licking the empty pot. DELICIOUS and so easy to make!

Easy to make, easy to eat, hard to mess up--difficult to have it go wrong.

We added an entire head of garlic along with a couple extra potatoes and a lot more water.  In the end, it was sooooo good.

Strongly recommended for people of all walks of life--it's so easy even Bush can make it.

great recipes! I used fresh rosemary and parsley; which I think made all the difference! Also only used 1 lb of meat (that's all I had). And I added green beans and a little more cornstarch because I like it a little thicker. Great recipe and thanks for sharing!

First time I made stew. I used the crock pot instead of stovetop. Used a can of beef broth & 6 TBLSP cornstarch as I doubled the recipe. Simmered on high for 4 hours. Best stew I have ever had. Will definitely make again. Thanks Paula.

This was a really good stew.  I did add a few things, mushrooms, red wine, garlic & a couple of bay leaves.  Also, I used beef broth instead of water & cubes and I had to triple the cornstarch.

This was yummy! I basically followed the recipe, 'cept I had no celery. I probably used more potatoes than called for. I used excellent meat and the stew turned out thick, hearty and very flavorful.

VERY easy and good flavor.  I didn't add the rosemary because I didn't have any but think it stil had a good amount of flavor. I did add some garlic salt.

I have never made beef stew before and this was great. I am a newlywed and my husband's reply while eating this was, "I'm so glad I'm married!" I added a little cornstarch at the end to make it a tad thicker. Still, very good!

Very good.  I used beef broth instead of water, more beef flavor.  The beef was very tender.

This came out a little salty.  I followed the recipe to the t, except I didn't thicken it with corn starch.  I would recommend to either add extra water or maybe take out one cube of buillion?

Wonderfuf!! I made the mistake of seasoning the beef while I was cooking it and the stew turned out very salty.  It could have been the beef bouillon though. I also took another's advice and added some flour to the beef for a thicker end result.  Thanks Paula.

This is the best Beef Stew I've had yet.  The meet comes out very tender and almost melts in your mouth.  It makes a good amount and the left overs (if there is any) is even better.

I made this last night, and my very PICKY boyfriend loved it! I added 1 tablespoon extra cornstarch to the stew about 30 mins before serving. It really helped thicken it up so it wasn't so soupy. Other than that it was GREAT!!!

I am vegetarian, but I made it for my husband the carnivore.  He said he enjoyed it, 
better than the canned stew he is used to eating, but a little bland.  Said it needed some
kind of "kick" or something.  He loaded it up with pepper.  Served with cornbread.

Overall a good stew.  The rosemary was a nice change, but it still needed something else to give it a little more flavor.

I browned the beef in white wine, while that was cooking chopped the veggies and dissolved the boulion and put it in the crockpot for the day. Added the corn starch about an hour before we ate! Great hearty recipe!!

This is my go-to beef stew recipe. I make it several times per year and it always turns out tender and delicious. The rosemary gives it such a nice flavor. The only change I make is that I use a beef base paste instead of bullion cubes just because it's what I always keep on hand. What a great meal for a chilly day!

I substituted 3 cups beef broth and 1 cup red wine for the 4 cups of water.  Added a lot of Worcestershire sauce after browning the meat.  Also used 2 Tbsp flour  in place of the cornstarch, but added it at the very end. Delicious!

I added 1/2 cup of red wine and cumin. Two ingredients I try to add to everything, when it seems appropriate. I also added oregano, because I’m feeling a bit cra cra this morning. Oh yeah, and I triple the corn starch. 2 tablespoons of cornstarch you say? Nope! I’m adding 6. I also didn’t add salt. The 4 cubes of beef bouillon are more than enough salt. The recipe called for 2 hours of cooking. Lol. Milk came out of my nose when I read that and I wasn’t even drinking milk. I put this concoction in my Crock-Pot for a 7-hour drive to Flavorville. It was amaze-balls.

I dusted the meat in seasoned  flour before browning, acts as a good thickening agent in place of the cornflour. I forgot celery, so replaced that with mushrooms. After browning the meat, in went the veg to soak up the flavours. Then added the meat back, stirred and in went a full bottle of red wine, which was only going to be a cup or two, but oh well.

My delicious stew recipe is almost exact but I use a chuck roast (a must for delicious meat) and 4 c. of low sodium broth and a couple of good shakes of worcheshire sauce.I add a handful or two of frozen peas the last couple of minutes. Everything else is the same.

Perfection. Did the two hours as noted, removed the lid and simmered for another hour. The veggies were done, the meat was tender and the gravy was just the right thickness for us. i did flour the beef cubes prior to cooking them in the oil. So I had some flour and the cornstarch to thicken.

This is a great stew recipe.I usually make my stews in a crock pot thinking the meat would come out more tender.  Boy, was I wrong.  This process of cooking made the meat so tender.  I will never make stew again in a crock pot.

Really good. I know some people hate tweakers, but I did add tweaks - some chopped tomatoes in the bouillon/stock stage. They add some needed acidity and helps tenderize the beef.  Also added 2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce and 3 cloves of roughly chopped garlic with the onions.  The good thing about this recipe is the stages.  I cooked the beef for 1.5 hours, then added celery and carrots.  Cooked for about 45 min then added the potatoes and cooked until tender.  I made Herbed Dumplings (my recipe from this site) and  it made a lovely meal for a cold a dreary day.

This recipe has never failed me!  It always turns out delicious and the meat is always tender.  I use beef broth instead of water and add just a little more corn starch since we like it a little thicker. Can't rave enough about this recipe!!

My 1st time making this recipe.  I did follow others advice and added more veg.  I coated the meat with the 1/4 cup of flour and seasonings then salted them in hot oil.  This turned out very well with lots of flavor and tender meat. I will definitely make again. It made enough for dinner for 4 and lunch for the hubby. I may double the recipe next time. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is already one of my favourite dishes! this stew is full of flavour and it is perfect for a cold winter evening. I also added wine to this recipe as suggested. Would eat alone or over rice!

Made It!!   Easy Plus Great Smelling and Tasting. I used tenderized stew meat, came out very tender, cooked for right amount of time. The only thing I did the last 10 minutes was add a small can of corn, can of cut string beans and fresh cut mushrooms, love the veggies. We always use Bisto Gravy Maker to thicken the gravy, no bland corn meal taste.

A great base, then express yourself. I added garlic powder, tomato paste, mixed herbs & Worcestershire sauce. Red wine would work, or a pinch of chilli. My husband loved it. It’s going in the meal rotation. ??

Excellent. I did add worchester sauce and ketchup along with a couple of bay leafs. Next time I think I may add diced tomatoes and mixed vegetables. Will definitely make again.

I followed a rater's suggestion and added more veggies 9parsnip, yam and mushrooms quartered).  Also added the Tbsp of ketchup, Worcestershire and steak sauce as well as 1/2 cup of red wine I had left over..  I dumped in a bit of chipotle BBQ sauce as well! I also followed his advice and shook up the beef cubes in a bag with 1/4 C flour, and a tsp of garlic powder, onion powder and 1/2 tsp pepper. Then browned beef in cast iron dutch oven before adding liquids.    I cooked it on low for a couple of hours. So delicious!!!  Husband never tasted a stew this great!

This is a great recipe. I want to thank the other reviewers for their suggestions, I also added a tblsp of A1, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce giving it a wonderful flavour. I floured the beef and browned it first adding onion and garlic powder to the flour. Thank-you for a great recipe. I love this web site because of all 5he

Outstanding!!  I only tweaked the recipe slightly;  dredging the stew meat in seasoned flour prior to browning (as recommended by others).  It made a wonderful gravy.  My husband raved about the stew -- in my book, this makes it a keeper!  Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious! I cooked it for an extra hour than what the recipe called for, and the meat was very tender. But the recipe itself needs no improvement.

Love this recipe.

Little tip on what I did differently:

I threw all the ingredients in a slow cooker and let it stew for the day on low. Minus the cornstarch thickener ingredients. Easier for the busy Moms. I also added a couple of bay leaves.

Just before serving ready I made a different thickener using flour, butter and full cream. I found this gives the stew an extra flavour that the cornstarch mixture seems to lack.

Melt a spoon full of butter in a pan over medium heat. Add a spoon full and a half of flour, stir in. Add a cup of full cream. Whisk with a fork until thick. Stir this in to the stew. 

Hope others enjoy this as well!

I loved this and added a few other suggestions. I added 1/2 C red wine and some worcestershire in the cooking process. Also put beef chunks in 1/4 C flour, 1 tsp onion powder, and 1 tsp garlic powder in Ziploc. Pepper to taste. Gave beef chunks great flavor.

This stew is very good as it is and I have made it several times.  To change it up a bit and add a little more flavor, I do make a few changes now. Instead of bouillon and water I use 4 cups beef broth. To save time and add veggies I also use 2 bags frozen vegetable soup mix that include onions, carrots, potatoes, Lima beans, okra, peas, green beans, corn, and celery. Dredge the meat with flour, onion powder and garlic powder and brown in pan, then add broth. Simmer as directed and then add veggies, rosemary, and 1/2 tsp of thyme as well as 2 tsp of steak sauce and 1/2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce. Simmer for an additional hour and then thicken with corn starch.  I usually serve it with cheddar bay biscuits or fresh baked French bread.

I followed posted suggestions and tossed beef in flour seasoned with a bit of garlic, pepper,pinch of salt.  Deglazed with cooking sherry. Also added extra black pepper and garlic powder oh, and about a 1/4 cup prepared pasta sauce I had in the fridge for fun! It worked well! Served along with some basic biscuits and had a very hearty, cost effective, tasty meal. I am definitely going to make it again, using some of the other suggestions. Thumbs up!

It was really good!  I added a lot more seasonings because I like very savory sauce--I seasoned the meat with pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Worcestershire sauce.  I also added fresh chopped garlic, lots of pepper, some onion powder, and some Worcestershire sauce to the broth.  I used red potatoes chopped into small pieces because I prefer the texture and like to leave the skins on.  I also added some frozen peas and fresh sliced mushrooms to the broth about a half hour from being done to add more veggies.  I found it needed more corn starch to thicken it so it wasn't 'soupy'.  My husband loved it!!!

This stew is delicious, I've made 3 or 4 times. All I did was replace 1lb. of stew meat with 1 lb. crumbled up fried hamburger meat. (put in towards end)   I do try and get the gravy thicker, but this is a good hearty stew for winter, serve it with fresh Ciabatta rolls and butter. Mmm good, thanks for posting. Addicted...

I followed several suggestions on here and was very pleased. I coated the meat in the flour mixture as recommended by Chuck Sampson, then simmered the meat for a couple hours in the same pan it was browned with Red Cooking Wine, worcestershire sauce, Sweet Ray's BBQ sauce, & minced garlic. Then added the veggies and cornstarch an hour before I was ready to serve it. Made some French Bread and dinner was a huge hit! Will definately make again

My husband kept saying how good this was when he was eating it.  As other reviews suggested, I put the beef in a bag with cornstarch, pepper and garlic powder and shook it up before browning the meat.  I also added red wine and used the Better than Bullion.  I thicken it with corn starch after the cooking time.  It was already added to my receipt book.  Will make it again for sure.

I made only a few changes.  I used beef broth, instead of water, and 4 t. beef bouillon granuales instead of cubes.  (It was easier than using cubes.)  I added more onion.  I also did what someone else said and mixed 1/4 cup flour, 1 t. garlic powder, 1/2 t. onion powder, and 1/2 t. ground black pepper in a Ziploc bag.  I then added the beef cubes to the bag and shook it until the cubes were well coated.  I put the whole contents of the bag in the heated oil and browned.  Worked great.  My husband really liked this stew.  I will definitely be making it again.

Tasty stew! I did tweak it just a bit . . . I only had 3 beef cubes, so I used those with 3 cups water and 1 cup of red wine. I did coat the beef with flour/pepper/garlic powder/onion powder before browning it in the oil, as a few others recommended. I used fresh parsley and rosemary, and added some fresh thyme as well. I cooked this in my cast iron Dutch oven in a 250 degree oven for 4-5 hours. There is a lot of gravy compared to the beef, veggies, so you could definitely either cut back on the liquid or increase the amount of "stuff" in it to compensate. I served this over egg noodles, just like my Mom would have done. Overall, a very comforting meal on a cool autumn night.

This was an excellent recipe.  On a whim I picked up a bag of "soup and stew" root vegetables at Trader Joe's.  I added the root vegetables (parsnips, turnips, and rutabagas) to the mix and it gave my stew a fantastic flavor.  The texture of these vegetables is a lot like potatoes so no one was the wiser.  The house smelled heavenly while the stew was cooking and the taste was to die for.  I didn't know these vegetables would add so much flavor.  I'm so glad I tried it, I didn't know what I was missing.

good recipe, I made my own stock from Buffalo spine though. only thing I would change is the cook time. the 1 hour for cooking the vegetables was so not enough. potatoes were barely cooked and the celery was still uncooked, aND tge stew meet was still a bit to tough for my tast. I ended up cooking the last step 2 almost 3 hours, and it turned out amazing! with stew the longer you cook it the better it is, that time thickens it up, tenderise the meet, and brings out the full flavor of the beef.

I didn't change anything but I made mine in a crock pot cooking on high for about 3 hour total.  It was very good. Two of us ate almost all of it in one setting with homemade butter bread.

The changes, at least one bay leaf another trick is too add the leafy part of celery chopped up with the bits. I substituted flour (husband allergic to corn) but other times I added mashed potatoes.  I couldn't  use the beef cube so I think the bay leaf was a good substitute but I have tried beef cube before and enjoyed it. I love the photo. I would give it a four.

Yummy! This recipe allows creativity. I added seasonings to flour in freezer bag with meat (2 pounds )- dried oregano, pinch cayenne, salt, garlic powder, Tumeric. After browning meat added 32 ounces stock and wine. (that was all needed.) Then veggies (upped per suggestion above) Yukon gold potatoes and orange pepper. Followed with Woustershire, last of a tube of Tomato paste, mustard. Then thickened with corn starch (great tip above). A Keeper!!

I used beef stock instead of water and only 2 bouillon cubes as we do not like our food salty, I also doubled the veggies as we love lots of veggies.  I did add red wine for a great flavor. Very good recipe!

The BEST stew I've ever made! I am not a stew lover but this was soooooo good!  I did make it in a crock pot rather than stove top. I cooked the beef and then added roughly cut potatoes, carrots, celery, green beans and onions along with the parsley and rosemary.  I also added about 1 1/2 cups of red wine (this really made it more flavourful)  I set the crockpot on low and let it go for 6 hours then I added the cornstarch mixture. I quadrupled this mixture as it was too runny.  I then turned the crock pot on high for 1 hour, the vegetables were perfect! Not mushy at all and the beef was so tender! This is a keeper for sure, I'm really not sure why anyone would give it less than 5 stars!  Thank you ??

the potatoes mashed up too much and became part of the gravy which ruined it a little.

OMG.. Just awesome.. I cut this recipe in half. I only had 1lbs of VENISON  stew meat.. Followed it to a T. But in step 2 I did add a 1/2 can of beef broth and few dried garlic chips.. And continue to cook it for an hour .. only because I like mine a little bit more on the soup consistency side..  Cooked it  down with a little more corn starch .. Just wow.. Meat was tender and the seasoning added just the perfect aroma.. My kids and husband was in heaven.. It's keeper .. Thank you so much for such a simple on hand recipe!

It reminded me of the stew my mom made when I was little. It was perfect! Needed a little thickening at the end, but nothing a little roux couldn't fix. So tasty. Definitely going to be a highlight in our recipe box.

Excellent Easy Recipe loved by all in this house. Followed as recipe states and came out perfect. I don't use cornstarch so I used a 1/2 flour 1/2 coconut flour mixture which always works great. Also added some sweet potato, yum.

I followed instructions from the reviews and did the flour/pepper thing before hand.  I missed the one that said don't add too much pepper after because it'll be spicy.  It was, but it was still really good.  I also used about 8 teaspoons of cornstarch to make it nice and thick.  Really good recipe - thanks!!

great recipe!  My hubby doesn't like stew usually, but loved this recipe. I put it altogether in my crockpot before I left for work and it was ready when I got back 8 hours later (on low).  Otherwise, my changes were minor, I added a little bit of salt as I too did not use boullion. My husband is diabetic so I used a sweet potato instead of a regular white or red potato, but it was perfect!  I'll be using this recipe often. 

November 2015.  I decided to try this recipe again with my electric pressure cooker and it was delicious!  Here's how I did it:  browned the beef in the oil in the bottom of the pressure cooker.  Add the spices and the bouillon and bring the cooker to High Pressure for 15 minutes, while you prepare the veggies.  Do a Quick Release on the cooker.  Bring the cooker back to High Pressure and cook for approx. 7-8 minutes.  Do another Quick Release and add peas and thickener.  Simmer in the cooker for approx. 5-10 minutes, then serve.  Perfection!  If you have a stove top pressure cooker the cooking times will be a bit shorter.

Great base recipe. Flavorful throughout. Even my very picky husband likes it! Tender meat, although I used stir-fry strips cut in half crosswise. The meat is more consistent, since with stew meat you get trimmings from lots of different cuts. 

Made some changes: dredged meat with Kentucky Kernel Seasoned Flour (eliminates need for salt, pepper, garlic etc) shaken in bag and browned a single layer of meat at a time in olive oil; deglazed pan with 1/2 cup or so of Alltech's Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale; used Knorr Homestyle Concentrated Beef Stock (didn't have my preferred Minor's Beef Base); and used a bag of frozen stew vegetables from Kroger (pearl onions, carrots, celery, and potatoes. Next time I will cut potatoes in half. Do not thaw veggies). Added a large sprig of fresh rosemary from my winter garden. Needed 1-2 more cups of liquid.  I used water, but could use more ale, beef broth, or stock. Flavor was still perfect even with the extra water. Didn't  add any salt, and just a bit of freshly ground pepper. 

Can't wait to make this again. The lesson here is to experiment , but keep the cooking methods and time. Be sure to use a large pot!

I cannot believe how GREAT this stew came out!!! This is my second time making it, I used another recipe and it didn't come out right, but THIS one is a hit. I too thought the stew would be a little bland due to the lack of seasonings, so I added garlic powder and pepper (no I didn't measure) while the meat was browning, followed the recipe until the end. I still thought it lacked flavor so I added salt...DO NOT DO THIS FOR IT WILL BE TOO SALTY. I had to add low sodium chicken broth to cut back some of the salt...did it work? A little. However, the end result is what mattered because my 5 and 2 year old ate it. Even my critical mother loved it (even with the salt). Thank you sooooo much for sharing this recipe. This is a keeper and I will be making this again (with no added salt).

Delicious!!!  I've made this recipe several times as is, and it was a hit with my husband and VERY picky kids.  I made it tonight following suggestions of substituting 1/2 cup red wine for the 1/2 cup water and 1 tbs of tomato paste and I would give it more than  5 stars if I could! Thank you so much for this recipe!

I pretty much followed the recipe. Only adjustment was a little more pepper and added some salt. It was really good. I used a chuck roast and cubed it. The meat was so tender. I will make again with a few tweeks. ..use red potatoes so they don't get mushy,  add some red wine and will probably season the meat with flour mix before browning.  Great base recipe!

This worked out very well for me. Like others, I did make some modifications:

> I dredged the beef in flour before I browned it;

> I didn't use boullion (because I forgot to buy some); I substituted red wine for half the water. I added salt to make up for the lack of boullion.

> I added some red pepper, and used flour rather than cornstarch to thicken the gravy.

> I had some shallots and threw them in, along with some garlic.

> I added some peas.

In retrospect, I think some beef broth (or the boullion) would have been good to add more broth. What I had was good, but not enough. Also, I think it would have been even better had I simmered it another hour -- following the recipe (perhaps I kept the temp too low), the vegetables were a little firm to my taste.

The virtue of a recipe like this is that you can make some changes, and it'll work. Someone added tomatoes; I may try that too. I also thought about using bacon fat instead of oil at the beginning; again, for more flavor. Also, I might try bay leaf one of these times.

I made some hot rolls and buttered them to eat with the stew, and that was perfect. I had it with some more of the red wine!

Finally, this is easy. The vegetables can be cut up while the meat-and-broth are simmering, and it's no problem leaving it unattended while you do other things. Try it!

Really good. Used seasoned flour as suggested and added frozen peas at the end. Definitely double the veggies as there is lots of gravy.

I have to honestly only give this recipe 4 stars after reading all the great reviews that followed reviewer "Chuck" ~ I decided to go with his suggestions, mostly. 
Placed the beef in a bag with seasoned flour and I did "shake it up, baby". Took a long time to brown the four batches of meat to a nice crust/color. I used one cup of a Cabernet wine for the water and deglazed the pan & crusty stuff with that, scraping up the burned & browned bits. I used a knife to cut/crush up the Knorr beef boullion cubes, melted in the remaining 3 cups of hot water. No rosemary on hand, so I did 1 big shake of Italian herbs instead. I brought meat & liquid to a boil and let simmer for an hour, covered. Smelled GREAT!
Added 3 stalks celery, half a bag of baby carrots chopped, 2 garlic cloves, 1 large yellow onion & leftover gold potatoes I had on hand, 3 lbs, 2 shakes Worcestershire. Added another 2 beef cubes in 2C hot water, as it didn't seem to have enough liquid, but added only 1C initially. 
Was very "soupy" after 30 mins, so I took the leftover beef dredging flour, whisked it into the boullion water in batches, added that & cooked another 30 mins, cover off.
Liquid turned a light tan & thicker, more like a stew consistency than soup, which is what I was going for.
DELICIOUS!! Beefy, savory, a tad too salty due to the xtra cubes, but somehow still delicate, layered and complex in flavors. Just monitor to your tastes, TASTE AS YOU GO for seasoning and voila!
SOOOO GOOD! Will make again!

I have never made stew before, the taste I was expecting was one of my grandmothers. I have to say it didn't come close im not sure if it was the rosemary or something I did wrong. I followed the recipe but added parsnips and turnips, Could that have changed the flavor or am I right with the rosemary. It just seemed like such a strong overpowering flavor. The meat was tender and the gravy perfect. Thank you for this recipe I might try it again without the added veggies and the rosemary.

Very good, easy stew. I cut up a chuck roast (oh so tender!) and coated it with a mixture of flour, Tony's Chachere, onion powder, & garlic powder.  Used my cast iron dutch oven and browned the meat with the onion.  I didn't have any fresh carrots, so I used frozen ones (defrosted) and threw in a few frozen (defrosted) green beans, as well.  So, so good! Delicious with hot popovers. This will be my "go to" stew from now on!

AMAZING!  You would think with very few ingredients it would lack in flavor but this is an amazing recipe. The meat is mega tender!  We will eat this a lot. Did add extra cornstarch for a thicker sauce but other than that left it alone and it is great!

Simple yet delicious. I skipped the cornstarch part. Cooked on low for  8 hours in crock pot.  Used  only about 1 tablespoon of olive oil to brown meet.  It's not too salty but I did add an extra onion.

I have just started getting into cooking again, now that I'm retired and have more time.  My husband was over the moon and said he wanted stew.  I was a bit reluctant, as he is Northern Irish and a bit of a stew connoisseur, but decided to try this recipe.  It was a HUGE hit - he is still grinning from ear to ear.  Easy to make and absolutely delicious.  A real winner and one that will remain in my repertoire.  Thanks!

Easy and Delicious. I added lots of red wine and  4 cloves of garlic (when I added the onions).  I wondered if the meat would be less flavorful because the beef is not dredged in flour before browning. Turns out I didn't miss the flour, or the floury mess.  Also, not needing to brown the onions saves some work.  I'll be making beef stew more often.

I used two packets of gravy mix in place of flour and one packet of onion soup mix in place of spices. Chicken stock in place of water. Also added extra meat, extra potatoes and then frozen peas at the end. No need to brown the meat. There was some risk that this might end up a salt bomb but it came out perfect!

This is my favorite Beef Stew recipe thus far (better than Slow Cooker Beef Stew).  I added double the cornstarch to thicken it a bit more, and I had mushrooms on hand so those went in too....delicious!

This stew as written is not a 5 star recipe, but can be with changes. There is not enough liquid in the original recipe. I had to add an extra 1 1/2 c and more seasonings.

First time trying recipe and my family loved it! We're really not stew fans but everyone had second helpings and guest even took home a bowl for later. I will definitely cook this again. I also adjusted recipe by using beef stock and adding more water.

I think this recipe has the basics you need for a classic stew, and the wiggle room to add ingredients to make it your own. I added 2 cloves of garlic, minced, when I was browning the meat. I also added Worcestershire sauce, about 1 teaspoon, along with the rosemary,  parsley and pepper. I also chop my veggies a little smaller, but that's so my 5 year old had no issues eating it, as well as my elderly mother. I love this recipe so much, I am making it for dinner right now :) It's pairs well with fresh from the over biscuits, which you have time to make after adding your veggies!

I followed this recipe amost entirely to begin with, except I had three pounds of stew meat. I'm not sure if this is why mine came out extremely soupy, but I had to do some serious work to get it much more stew-like than soup. I tried doubling the cornstarch to start, but I ended up making a flour slurry with about 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup water. I mixed the slurry thoroughly, brought the stew to a boil, and added the slurry. After a few minutes, the stew thickened, but it was left a bit flat tasting. I added another buillion cube and a teaspoon of worchestershire sauce and then it was good. The meat was very tender and everyone enjoyed it,

Great recipe! I followed the suggestions of some of the other posters - added 3/4 cup red wine and seasoned the beef while browning - and I also used Better Than Bouillon vs. bouillon as the recipe calls for. But, the taste was excellent and the beef turned out amazingly tender. Definitely a keeper!

Holy cow, this was delicious. I did make a few changes based on suggestions and what I had. I did not have rosemary, so I omitted it. I added a packet of McCormick beef stew seasoning instead. I probably used closer to 2.5 lbs of beef. I did not use celery, but used fresh green beans (maybe a half pound) and a can of corn. I also added a 1/2 cup of red wine after cooking the beef. I served this with buttermilk cornbread... YUM!

Amazing recipe! This was my first time cooking stew. I made this pretty much according to the original recipe. I added ketchup, A1 steak sauce, and worcestor sauce as another reviewer mentioned. I also doubled the cornstarch as I prefer a thick stew. The flavor was excellent. Cooking time recommended was right on point.

This is a great SARTER recipe. First lets list the pros:
Nice stew consistency 
good veggie to meat ratio

cons
definitely need to add salt to your liking. I added 2 tsps
need to season meat when browning with veggie oil (season to your liking)

and possibly add some type of hot spice (cheyenne pepper or paprika or even throwing in some serrano peppers) play with it till you get the right flavor for you.

I made this almost exactly like the recipe. I used Knorr Homestyle Stock instead of bullion cubes, but it's basically the same stuff.  I used exact same seasonings and other ingredients as in the recipe.  I wish people would rate the "real" recipe instead of rating how they made it, when it's totally different.  Anyways, I gave this 4 stars because I thought it was 1) easy and 2) tasted very good, this was NOT bland at all. It's a typical, basic beef stew. Very yummy and homestyle comfort food.  Serve with crusty bread or some biscuits.  

I kept adding cornstarch until it was the thickness I wanted. If you do this, add a little, then WAIT a few to see how thick it gets.  Cornstarch takes time to thicken.  Disolving it in a tiny bit of cold water is a great tip so it doesn't lump up.  I think this is a great recipe, but you could also add any vegetables you wanted or whatever you had on hand. If using cooked leftover veggies, add them at the last 5 minutes, just to warm them up. When browning the meat, try adding some chopped garlic too for some extra flavor.

Delicious! Only change I made was to add 1/2 cup of leftover red wine for part of the liquid. I will make again, but I'll add some turnip because we love turnip in stew...and I might thicken it up a bit more. The taste of this was perfect!

I make this same stew except I use a slow cooker.  I think the corn starch is to thicken the gravy a bit, but I use tapioca and a little sugar.

This was the first time I ever made Beef Stew. I used this recipe. It turned out better than I thought it would especially after it stuck to the bottom of my pot. It kind of made my potato's and carrots fall apart when I tried to get it unstuck. My mother liked it and so did I. I will definitely be making it again.

The first time I made it I was elated. While I did cook beef stew from scratch before, there were times when I had to depend on the McCormick Beef Stew seasoning mix and my pressure cooker when I'm pressed for time. This recipe is so flavorful and rich. The only change I made, is to coat the beef pieces with flour, garlic powder, pepper and onion powder before browning, which I customarily do when I cook beef stew. The flour, fat and seasonings also creates a very thick and rich roux when the liquid is added so I didn't need to thicken it with cornstarch later. The second time I made this recipe, I added half water, half red wine plus some ketchup just for personal preference. This recipe is definitely godsend!

The flavor was very good. I did coat the meat in flour that had garlic and pepper in it. I used olive oil.
In addition to using beef broth, I added a 1/2 C red wine, a few splashes of worchester sauce and some Montreal Steak seasoning and Lawyers salt.

The only think I didn't like is that the sauce was way too watery. Next time I will thicken it.  The kitchen smelled wonderful and the stew was delicious

This was great!  One thing I did differently was to add potatoes and veggies all at once (right after browning the meat and adding the bouillon) and cooked it for just over 1 hour and 30 minutes.  The potatoes I used were the mini ones, cut in half for even cooking.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  Also, I used more than the equivalent of three potatoes suggested, so I didn't have too much extra liquid, like some of the other reviewers...no need to add additional corn starch that way.  Everything was tender and delicious.  I added one tsp of ketchup to cut the salt a little bit.  My husband LOVED this and I'm making it for a second time this week!

I made the beef stew tonight and I followed the recipe.  I also followed the advice of using a little flour with the onion and garlic powders to brown the beef.  I must admit I was a little nervous but it turned out delish.  Next time I will add peas and corn.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This beef stew is officially a winter staple in my house.I tried the recipe 2x. The first time - not bad / the 2nd time AWESOME and with my new stock pot. Next time need to double the recipe because nothing lasts in my house. We love food!  

Made 4 changes to the recipe:
Eliminate the celery; just use peas, potatoes and carrots.

I use 3 bouillon cubes and 1 sodium-free bouillon cube to even out the salt-intake. 

Rather than cubing the veggies, I angle the carrots into 1 inch pieces and cut the potatoes into 8ths-wedges.

Use flour, rather than cornstarch to thicken the gravy. 
 
Finish Product: Yummy and warms the tummy. Many thanks for sharing.

This is a big hit with our 3 teenage boys!  Like others, I used some salt, pepper and garlic in a flour mixture to coat the beef lightly before browning.  I sometimes use beef broth and add an extra packet of beef seasoning. Mmmmmm

Really liked to proportions of the ingredients.  I also added a couple tablespoons of Worchestershire sauce, some thyme and bay leaves, and 3/4 cup red wine.  Instead of adding flour or corn starch to thicken, I added 2 extra potatoes and then pureed them with some of the broth.  It thickens the stew beautifully without changing the flavor!

Did the "shake the bag baby" trick. Browned meat up in the skillet & deglazed with red wine. Added 3 cans low sodium beef broth, simmered 1 hour, added 1 more can with all the veggies. DELISH

Wasn't expecting anything great.. But this recipe turned out to be the best stew I have ever made!  The entire family raved about it!  Very flavorful!  I followed the recipe, as stated.  However, i did use a couple extra teaspoons of flour for a thicker stew.  Next time, I will add the potatoes later in the recipe, or use the new potatoes, as stated by other reviewers. No extra salt needed. Give it a try!  Hope you enjoy it as much as my family and I did!!

Stew was amazing. I followed some of the advice that others have mentioned and before searing the meat I tossed it in a Ziplock bag with 1/4 cup of flour, 1/4 tsp of onion powder, garlic powder and pepper. I also added 1/2 cup of red wine during deglazing process, 1/2 tsp of ketchup, A1, and worcestershire sauce after I added the potatoes, carrots and celery and 1/2 cup of barley during the last 30 min. I wasn't sure if 2 hours was enough time to cook as my potatoes and carrots were still undercooked. Next time I will either simmer for more than 2 hours or just throw everything in the crock pot. Other than that it was delicious and recommend.

This is an awesome stew template to follow.  This was the first stew I ever made and I found it simple.  The first time I used this recipe I found it to be way too salty, so I cut down on the bouillon the second time. I also used a flour and milk mixture in addition to some low fat sour cream I had in the fridge instead of cornstarch.  This thickened it up nicely and made a beautiful gravy.  I'm not sure if I cut my vegetables too small, but I found that even half an hour of simmering with the veggies left them mushy, never mind the suggested 1 hr.  I also added worcestershire sauce as well as basil and garlic. I'll definitely be making this again - third time's a charm.

Excellent stew!  I took heed of other reviewers' notes and used half a cup of red wine to deglaze the pan, and I also used fresh rosemary (an entire package).  I also enjoy parsnips in my stew, so I added 3 to the vegetables.  One thing I found, however, was that the stew was too salty, so next time I try this I will use 3 bouillon cubes instead of four.

Excellent.  I did my best to follow, but made a few additions along the way.  I quadrupled the amount of cornstarch, added an extra cup of broth, a few shakes of dried chili pepper seeds (a nice "bite"), a small handful of cilantro toward the end (lots of flavor), a cup of wine, and a squirt of ketchup. I fished some of the celery out and tossed them because they seemed to be taking over.  My (critical) boyfriend said it was incredible, didn't hesitate when I asked if I couple put some in a bowl for work the next day (he usually goes out for lunch so what an honor!) and was befuddled that he wasn't a carrot eater but loved them in this stew.

We made up a roast, which was a lot for the two of us.  So we repurposed some of the leftovers into a smaller portion of this stew.  It was very tasty, and brought new life to our leftovers.

Not bad.  For me there was too much Rosemary.  I did a few of the adjustments.  Some flour, garlic and onion powder, and a little wine.

The onions were not quite done.  Add about 20 minutes to the last hour.  It also needed 2 more bullion cubes,...or more salt.

This is the best stew recipe because the meat never dries out, it falls apart in the bowl.  Also, fresh rosemary gives it a beautiful aroma and earthy flavor..LOVE THIS RECIPE!!  No more crock pot stews for me!

This is a five star recipe with few changes.  Instead of using water, I used 99% fat free beef broth.  Like some of the other reviewers, I floured the beef before browning it, added 1/2 cup red wine, 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, A1 steak sauce and ketchup halfway through the cooking process. I also used a rosemary garlic seasoning blend.  My husband said this was the best beef stew he'd ever eaten.

This was a good recipe but to me it had too much rosemary in it. I floured the meat instead of using corn starch. I also added the ketchup, Worcestershire and A-1 steak sauce as other reviewers suggested but meh it wasnt enough to notice. I will make this again to see if I can get that just right combo but as written plus reviews still didnt make this 5 stars for me.

This was some darn good beef stew! I deviated from the recipe. I coated the beef in flour before browning in the pot. I browned the beef and put the flour used for coating into the pot with 1 box and one can of beef broth. (I also find bouillon too salty.) The flour made for an amazing stew gravy. I only simmered the beef for 40 mins. before adding the vegetables. Instead of celery, I used one green bell pepper cut to about 3/4" size. Because I used the flour in the gravy, I skipped the corn starch (cs makes things too gelatinous for my taste.)

This is the best stew I've ever had! We added half a Rutabaga(diced), as well as one large Parsnip(Also diced). Also increased the veggies(not sure how much, but there was at least double the potato) We made this in our crock pot slow cooker, and added more water and an additional bouillon cube as well as a squirt of lemon, and a pinch of salt and garlic. And of course, we added some dumplings.
We've made it twice so far, and this will absolutely be our go-to recipe for when we want a hearty, filling and drool-worthy stew.
I think next time we might add some mushrooms as well, I think the taste would compliment this stew rather well.

I agree with Chuck about browning this meat before making the stew.  The only thing I did differently is to use a pressure cooker and adjust spices similar to Chuck's.  The pressure cooker obviously cuts the cooking time. I never see reviews where anyone has used a pressure cooker, but I would be lost without mine.  The pressure infuses the flavors into the vegetables, in particular and makes the meat almost fall apart, depending on how long you cook it.  Some may not prefer their stew this way, but mine always gets raves.

Yummy! This recipe was amazing! I used the packets from Ramen Beef Soup instead of bullion cubes and added more veggies and more cornstarch. I also used some Accent for flavor... It was so good! I will certainly make this meal again !

We loved this stew!  I would say to just add the veggies at the same time as the beef because the carrots and potatoes were a little crunchy after only an hour of being on simmer.  I did add some pepper and garlic powder to the beef before browning it.  Also, at the last minute I realized I didn't have any rosemary, so I substituted thyme and added a bay leaf.  Very tasty! ~Jessica

I love this recipe.  I made it as stated but decreased the water by 3/4 cup and doubled the cornstarch. I also used 4 large red potatoes.  I like a thick stew.  But what amazing flavor.  Plus super simple!

I used one potato, peeled, diced up into small pieces (almost cubed), as an additive to the first hour of summer with about 45 mins left to achieve the starch I needed for thickness; used no corn starch.  I also seasoned the cubed beef overnight in some red wine and Worcestershire sauce (to cover) after rubbing the beef with Montreal Steak Seasoning.  I added dried rosemary and the garlic powder, but I turned the dried rosemary into a powder in my mortar and pestle.  I can only say the house smells incredible, and I'm drooling waiting to taste it!  Perfect fall weather eats!

This is a good BASIC recipe. I followed recipe exactly but feel it needs a little more "body" to it.  I need to play around with it and perhaps  add garic or Worcestshire sauce like others have said. Good ratio of veggies and broth.  Thanks for the recipe. Its a keeper.

This stew was a hit! I followed the suggestions of other users by substituting red wine for 1/2 of the water called for. I also used mini yukon potatoes cut in half with skins left on because I preferred the look. Browning the beef in small batches before starting helped make it easier to turn the pieces in the bottom of my stock pot. Delicious the next day and freezes well. The beef was super tender.

This turned out so good! I followed it almost exact. I didn't have parsley flakes so I substituted Italian seasoning, and I replaced 1 cup of the beef broth with red wine. Outstanding! Thanks for a great recipe! Will definitely be my 'go-to' stew recipe!

Love this recipe and love the style of the thicker broth. I get lots of compliments whenever I make it.I make a few minor adjustments. The best is the add a few splashes of Kitchen Bouquet.  It gives it a nice, rich color and a hint of flavor. I also prefer my stew to be more like a soup so I double the liquid and the corn starch.

My family and I just finished this for dinner and...WOW!!! O followed the recipe pretty much as directed but cooked in a crocpot for about 8hrs. I browed my meat with a lil salt and pepper then put in crocpot and cooked for 6.5 hrs then added the rest of ingredients and cooked approx 1.5 hrs. I cooked on LOW the entire time. I also tripled the cornstarch. This turned out Spectacular :)

Very good. I did make a few changes, I dusted the beef in 1/4 c flour, 1tsp garlic powder and pepper, shaken in a plastic bag? Always use canola when browning meat, it gets much hotter than vegetable and will seer the meat while sealing in the juices. Make sue oil is good and hot before adding meat. I added 3/4 of cup of red wine to the the broth.  If you wouldn't drink a glass of the wine then you shouldn't use it in your recipes, only the good stuff. Added 1tsp of basil. I also did as Chuck did and added more vegetables, (used red skin potatoes with skins on) and1 tablespoon each of ketchup, A1 and Worcester Sauce. I also doubled the corn starch as I wanted it thicker. I served it in bread bowls and it was yummy!

Made this today.  My first beef stew and it was wonderful. As always, unless baking and sometimes even then, I use recipes as guidelines.  I did use  wine and beef broth instead of the bullion as I don't care for it. Coated the beef cubes in seasoned flour before browning and deglazing, and put it in  250 degree oven, covered, fo 2 hours  before adding the vegetables and cornstarch mixture and finishing on stovetop.  Simmered for another hour.  Really, really good!  Will be making this often this fall/winter.  Thanks for posting.

This is the best stew! I have made stew in a slow cooker for years but this was the best. I followed the recipe as written but used more corn starch than called for to make it extra thick. The meat and carrots and potatoes were so tender and delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is great!  When I read the ingredients, I was afraid it would be bland, but not so.  The only changes I made was adding my favorite beef stock from Safeway in place of the bouillon and 1/2 cup of red wine.  I will definitely make it again.

This was really good! Our potatoes were sort of mushy, but hubby made so could have just cooked on high a little too long. But meat was super tender, and had good flavor. Would make again.

Mostly followed the recipe. I used elk instead of beef. I doubled the corn starch and used beef broth instead of bullion. I cooked it as directed but stopped 15 minutes early and then put it in a slow cooker on low for about 3 hours and then warm for about 2 more hours.  Delicious!

Very very good. Flavorful and tender meat. Just be sure to use a tough cut because the first time I use a tender cut and it was falling apart too easily. Anyway, great recipe. Husband and 2 year old loved it.

I actually used a crock pot for this recipe.  I coated the beef in flour and browned it in a frying pan with a small amount of olive oil, while the bullion was dissolving in beef broth (instead of water).  I added the ingredients listed here, but also added oregano and garlic powder.  I added just a little more flour than the recipe called for, because the slow cooker never brought it to a boil, there was much more broth.  It was not thick, but not too soupy.  I let it cook on low overnight, and added corn & green beans just before serving.  Delicious!  I shared with several neighbors and my fiance.  EVERYONE loved it!  DHilton1978@gmail.com

Pretty darn good! I took the advice of other reviewers and used more corn starch so it was really thick. I made it today but will serve tomorrow. Waiting to see what that 24 hour magic will do! I know I'll add some butter and ketchup. I miss the tang of the tomato and butter jus makes everything better! This is a solid easy recipe yielding nice results.

I really liked this recipe my only concern is the amount of salt....I would probably next time do 2 bouillon cubes instead of 4 and add no salt to the meat so I can adjust it near the end. As an overall is PERFECT my husband LOVED IT! Now that it is starting to get a bit chilli at dinner time...this is a go to recipe for the coming days of Autumn!! It really does not require much time standing in front of the stove, but of course you need two hours to wait for it to be ready. However,  who cares when this is a good Sunday recipe to have leftovers to take to work yum yum yum...I will make this again and again!

I made this recipe using the ingredients called for with the exception of some fresh corn kernels (and only because I had extra corn on the cob). It was absolutely wonderful and would definitely make it again.  I just made sure the meat was in bite size pieces for easy eating.

This was fantastic!  I am not a good cook, but this turned out so good!  I made most of the same adjustments as the reviewer Chuck. It smelled SOOO good while it was cooking.  Will definitely make again.  The only thing that surprised me was that it took the celery longer than I thought to get tender.  So next time, I will either cut the pieces smaller, or add them a bit before the rest of the veggies.

Paula,  Because you use cornstarch instead of flour, you can classify this recipe as "Gluten Free."  NICE for those of us who can't have any kind of flour, gluten, etc.

If you can, please add the gluten free classification to your recipe so it will show on that kind of search.

Thanks for the recipe.

Have made this a few times an we love it! Of course I tweaked it a little after the first time, I added more veggies because we love them! Also I brown meat add spices and broth an veggies all at once an cut cook time to 1 hour. I found the meat was a little tough for my family after 2 hours, also about 10 mins before its done I add flour till it thickens instead of the corn starch. My 3 yr old normally eats 2 bowls of this he loves it so much! Thanks for the recipe a new family favorite for sure!

As a young wife just starting out, I haven't had much experience making meals from scratch. I found this recipe and decided to try it. I was amazed at how easy it was! I'm not crazy about celery, so I substituted it with peas, and added a clove of fresh minced garlic with the other vegetables. It turned out absolutely amazing! So thick and rich, with the perfect amount of flavor. I served it with homemade biscuits (another first for me, I always use canned biscuits) and I wowwed my husband. Thanks, will definitely be making this again soon!

made several modifications according to the directions of other reviewers: in a bag I put 1/4 cup flour, teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder. 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Put the stew meat in, and shook it up baby! Then I cooked it up in my ( cast iron ) dutch oven and seared in those flavors. This really put some great flavor on that meat and the yummy bits stuck to the bottom of the cast iron pan easily came off during the deglazing with the liquids. I didn't cut back on any liquids..actually you will probably want to add more towards the middle-end of the cooking time. I used 1/2 cup of red wine during the deglazing with the other liquids.

This stew turned out great.  My entire family loved it.  I did as others suggested and seasoned the beef with pepper and garlic seasoning while it browned.  I didn't use any cornstarch and we all liked the consistency.

Made this for dinner tonight and we all thought it was the best beef stew we ever had! Per reviewer suggestions,  I added the meat to a blend of 1/4 C flour, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp salt before browning and deglazed with 1/2 C of red wine + 4 C beef broth. Enjoyed it with some garlic bread and a salad - scrumptious!

As written it was only "ok."  I took most of the other reviewers' suggestions, which improved upon it.  Next time I will use much less celery And will probably add some garlic and other spices when browning the meat.

I made this stew today. I did change a few things bcause I did not have rosemary dried so I used dried orgeano instead. I also used flour to thicken and it worked out great. Another tip is if you like wine add 3 oz and it gives it more body. Great stew!

So surprised at how easy making beef stew was & with great results.
Only made half reciepe & followed a few tips about preseasoning, coating the meat in flour & searing it before starting the soup. Didn't need to thicken the stew at the end because of the previous step. I also used a low sodium beef broth, instead of the cubes, I find the cubes to salty & I like to season to taste if needed.

Followed recipe & Chucks review. I would add more meat as the meat shrunk during the cooking process. Added a pinch of salt and i am typically not a salt user.

This stew is great! I've made it twice now, and my picky bf says it's the best he's ever had. It's simple to make, though i'd say the prep time is more like an hour. The only change I made was doubling the corn starch in an attempt to make it thicker. The sauce/gravy still comes out a little thinner than your typical beef stew, but it's very flavorful and I don't think it detracts from the recipe at all. I will definitely be making this time and time again!

So simple and delicious.  I'll be making this was again.  I actually used left over meat.  I cooked the veggie portion 1st then added the meat to just warm it up.  My family had no idea they were eating left overs!

I am not much of a cook, but this stew came out excellent. I make up a batch, vacuum seal it and keep it in my freezer for use as lunch or dinner. I heat it up in the bag in boiling water. The real test was serving some of this to my mom for lunch. I am a fast eater, but my mom just devoured hers. She said she will start using the recipe as well.

My family wanted a non-tomato based beef stew and this one is perfect!  Did make it as others suggested with the red wine, and tried the meat with the seasoned flour first, but think it would have been just fine with only seasoning and browning the meat then thicken with  cornstarch.  Great recipe thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe although I did make all the same changes that CHUCK did.  The flavors were amazing and so delicious.  I served this with E-Z Drop Biscuits (recipe also on this site) and the meal was complete.  Great!!!!

This recipe is excellent, but I did makes come changes. I doubled the recipe because I always try to make enough for at least two meals, and freeze one for later. I followed Chuck's suggestion to put flour, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper in a bag and shake the meat in the mixture. I also increased all of the veggies, and used beef broth instead of water and bouillon. I added ketchup, A-1 sauce, and worcestershire sauce as suggested by Chuck. At the end, I used garbanzo bean flour instead of cornstarch to thicken the gravy for the additional nutrients. Even though I made some modifications, this is an excellent recipe as-is. I would recommend anyone to try it.

UPDATE 9/123/14
I thought I might add that last night I decided to try this recipe in a pressure cooker. Naturally, most of the prep time for adding ingredients and cutting and chopping was not reduced, but the cook time was reduced significantly. I did everything as previously stated, but pressure cooked the beef and everything but the potatoes, carrots, onion, and celery for 10 minutes. Then I added the veggies and pressure cooked for another 10 minutes. Then I thickened the gravy with the cornstarch mixture. It turned out great and the beef was incredibly tender.

Loved this recipe! I didn't have rosemary, but I put thyme, onion, and garlic powder instead. Also added 1/2 cup leftover tomato sauce. Hubby loved this too.  It's a keeper for sure.

So Delicious! And so easy. Just have to remember to get an early start, but otherwise this couldn't be simpler and and all but the beef I have on hand at most times. I added about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of water after boiling the meat for the hour because I wanted a little more broth. My husband suggested I cut back on the vegetable cook time a bit so they are not so soft, but that's his personal preference. I'm sure I'll be making this a lot during the coming cold weather.

I made this stew and it was really good!  I made a couple of changes, no celery for me and I was forced to use flour instead of cornstarch to thicken the gravy (didn't have any in the house).  I also had to add two extra cups of water with bouillon after the first hour as too much of it steamed away.  But this was a fantastic recipe, super simple to make, and I'll definitely be making this again.

I wanted to love this recipe because the picture looks like my nana's delicious stew and I wanted to atempt to recreate it. However, I simmered the stew once the veggies were added and I feel like the veggies were never cooked through!

This turned out really REALLY good, but I found it very salty. I thought it might be due to the brand of boullion I used, and it was (oxo brand). I used 2 and 3 the next times I made it, and found it was best with 3 to get enough flavour without the huge salt taste.

Very good basic beef stew.  I floured and seasoned the meet as many reviewers indicated.  Was a little heavy handed deglazing with Shiraz which made the stew nice and rich.  I used beef broth as my liquid.

This is almost exactly like my mom's beef stew I've eaten my whole life. I've made it 2 times, and I still like hers better, I think I was just trying to create my own because mine never tastes as good as hers when I make it! I think that's true of all food made by our mom's though! Her's has an added 8oz. can of tomato sauce, and I think I will continue to add that, it changes it for the better. Trhis is a great start though, and fairly easy.

I added one large diced tomato, one large diced onion, and a good amount of prepackaged sliced/washed mushrooms cut into strips. Because of the extra vegetables, I also put in to more cups of water along with two more beef bullion cubes.  This is a great recipe that I'm still drooling over. Thank You!

This recipe is wonderful!  I don't think it needs much alteration, if any.  Important note, though, I find that the meat will not get tender if you are lifting the lid to stir this (or smell it!), so do your best to resist removing the lid other than when you add the veggies.  Kind of like using a slow cooker...  When I take care not to lift the lid, the meat is SOOOOOOOO unbelievably melt-in-your mouth that I wish I had multiplied the recipe by 3!!!

I'm a learning chef, but this was an easy recipe, and the family loved it. The corn starch didn't thicken the stew as I thought, and I even doubled it. But it was delicious, nevertheless! The kids, who HATE vegetables, couldn't believe they were eating carrots, celery and onions! :D

This stew was so good my kids even said "this is the best stew I have ever had!". I made a few changes after reading other comments. In a plastic bag I put 1/4 cup flour, teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder. 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and mustard powder. The I added the stew meat in batches and shook it. Then I cooked it in my dutch oven with some oil till lighly browned. This adds excellent flavor to the meat. I then browned the onion in the remaining oil and scrapped up those brown bits on the bottom of the pot. Once the onion was translucent I deglazed the rest with about a 1/2 cup of red wine. I cooked that for about 5 minutes before adding the meat and rest of the liquids to cook of some of the alcohol. I did add more vegetables as others suggested (1 more carrot, celery, potato) I added 1/2 of an extra onion with the addition of the veggies. I also took the advice of another reviewer and added 1 tblsp of ketchup, HP Sauce, and worcestershire sauce -great advice...I was told by my husband "I would pay money for this...restaurant quality!"

I made this for our dinner but with only 2 beef bouillon cubes  I did add a couple of dashes of Kitchen boquet instead which makes it a delicious brown color and adds a wonderful flavor.  I used Safflower Oil which I use often instead of vegetable oil as it is healtier.   This was a rich and excellent recipe.

Enjoyed making this stew.  Taste very good.  i prepped the meat in a zip lock bag using 6 teaspoons of flour, a little garlic powder some cracked pepper and meat tenderizer.   I did use 2 cans of beef broth and prior to adding the broth after I browned the meat I deglazed the pan with1/2 a cup of merlot wine.  the stew was very tender.  I did not add any salt because I have to have low sodium due to pregnancy and swelling. I will make again.

Excellent basic beef stew.  I didn't have red wine on hand so I searched for a recipe that does not include it and came up with this one.  The meat was tender (even without the wine) and I really liked the spice combination.   I was hesitant to use so much rosemary with beef but I'm glad I made the stew as written.  The only changes I made were: 1)  saute the onion with the beef (instead of adding it with the other veggies) and 2) double the corn starch because we like a thick stew.   I will definately make this again.

This is the best beef stew! I didn't change a thing and cannot wait to make it again. Hmmm...maybe this weekend.

I have now made this numerous times and it is always good. Added fresh green beans today.

I must say, I feel like I blew it by NOT reading others reviews first! The recipe was FAR too liquidy. More like soup. I had flour in the house, no cornstarch, and used equivalent quantity, but I can see now that even if I'd used cornstarch, it would of still needed triple the quantity. The flavor was really good. I'd never used rosemary this way either, and the flavor is the reason this didn't drop to 3 stars. I added sweet potatoes, zucchini, mushrooms, and frozen peas as well. Next time I will know better! I'm adding cornstarch to my shopping list right now.

Delicious, no fail stew. If you can cut and simmer, you can do this and it's great. I also made modifications posted by others and made some additional ones of my own. I use red wine, add a little ketchup and tomato sauce, and use herbes de provence since I have a bunch I'm trying use up. Instead of cornstarch I use gravy flour and don't have a problem with it lumping. I put the kids' servings over buttered noodles and mine and DH's over lettuce. Instead of bullion cubes I use the bullion that comes in a jar that you can spoon out--pricey but I like it better.

My only beef with this recipe (pun intended) is that I thought it could have used just a bit more in the spice category.  It was good, but a bit boring.

This is a great recipe perfect for cold weather. I ended up adding red potatos (skin on) instead of the russett and it added a great more rustic flavor. I also added a bit more water and therefore more cornstarch. I've made this several times and it is always a huge hit with everyone, even the kids!

This was my first time making beef stew, and thanks to this recipe, definetly not my last!  The changes I made were to dredge my beef in plain flour, used powdered boullion, added mushrooms, used Italian seasoning because we were out of parsley, and omitted celery.  Oh yes, and I omitted the cornstarch as it was thick enough without it.  Served with buttermilk biscuits and it was a hit with the whole family!

This recipes was really awesome! I didnt change much about the recipe itself, except i did do the 1 tsp of ketchup, A1, and worcestershire and i added more cornstarch mixture to make it thicker, added green beans and corn. i seasoned its according to taste. Staying true to my german gma's cooking style, i served this over elbow macaroni. what a great warm comfort food! Thanks!

I intended to make this recipe exactly as it was written, but when I got the adding the rosemary part, I realized I was out, so I put tarragon in it instead and thought it turned out just great.  First beef stew attempt.  It was a little bit more liquid-y on the first day, but the second and third days of leftovers were a perfect consistency and was glad I didn't initially thicken it up based on the other reviews.   I added a few sprinkles of tabasco (first day) and cholula (the second day) right as I eating it and it gave it a great kick. I will try it with the intended rosemary the next time and compare.

It's still simmering for the last hour, but I snuck in and tasted some broth and took a piece of meat - DELICIOUS!  I kind of wish I hadn't tried it early bc now the smells are taunting me worst.  Thank you for the delicious recipe Paula!  Very easy to make, very delicious.

I've made this once and plan on making it again tonight.
It's absolutely delicious. The flavors are perfect and the meat was so tender.
I do add in more veggies and also add in 2 cans of diced no salt added tomatoes b/c we just enjoy that in our beef stew.
SO good!!

Ok,  I tried it the way it was and did not care for it so to make it taste better I added 1 teaspoon salt, 1-8oz can tomato sauce, and to thicken it up 2 tablespoons flour to 1/4 cup water.   Now it is good to go!  I also left out the rosemary. ( I do not like it!)

This is the first time I changed the way I make stew and most of my family really enjoyed it. My daughter will be coming home on leave next month, and she will be the final verdict. She doesn't embrace change in how food is perpared. If for some reason she doesn't like it, I'll just make it when she isn't home.

I've made this before, and it seems to just keep getting better.  I always add some different stuff to it.  This time I added some cilantro and let it simmer during the first simmer.  Sometimes I add corn and peas.

Absolutely delicious!  Very easy, just served it with some refrigerated biscuits.  Some minor changes I made:  halved it since it's just the two of us, used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, no celery, extra cornstarch.  I will definitely be making it again!

We loved this recipe for its wonderful flavor. We were disappointed that our stew was not thick. I have read other peoples reviews and I would add more cornstarch or use flour next time.

So good! Changes I made: used beef broth because that is what I had in my pantry. Also added lots of extra cornstarch because I like the gravy thick. Also added a package of clubhouse gravy mix because I was having trouble getting it to thicken up and was worried that you could start to taste the cornstarch. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was amazing, even better than my Mom's recipe I am used to (sshhhh, lol). I did take a tip from a reviewer and put the beef in flour, garlic powder & onion powder before browning. The result was great tasting meat!!! The whole family loved it, thanks for the recipe!!!

I have never made beef stew before as I've always found it to be boring and the beef dry.  This recipe was fantastic.  I read other reviews and made only a couple of modifications: beef broth instead of bouillon and lots more cornstarch.  What a great meal!

This stew was a big hit! I did take advice from another posting and dusted the meat with flour, onion salt, and garlic powder. Then browned the meat. I also added some ketchup, wistersire sauce, and A-1 sauce in the last hour of cooking. Turned out perfect and made the house smell great!

This beef stew was great!! I think it'll do nicely as a base recipe. I followed the reviews and used the garlic/onion powder/black pepper flour mixture for the beef and I added the three sauces an hour into cooking. At that point I added potatoes and onions. Thirty minutes later I added corn, tomatoes, mushrooms and more onions. It was fabulous. I didn't need to add any cornstarch at the end because it had thickened up nicely on its own. The man of my house liked it and also had it for leftovers the next day and he only does that if he likes it. Thank you!!! =)

I think this is a great stew recipe and for my first time making stew, it was easy and came out great!  It tastes a lot like my mom's, so it's definitely good!  My kids turned their noses up at it at first, but then I think they secretly liked it bc they ate a lot more than we thought they would!  I added the red wine like some reviewers suggested, other than that, I didn't stray much from the original recipe.  I did put some Bisquik dumplings on top, just like my mom's...the kids especially liked that!

This is how I have been doing my beef stew for years. However, I cube my meat and toss in a plastic ziplock bag with flour. Make sure the meat is well coated. Drop in pan and brown on high heat. Use wine if you like to deglaze pan, and then the remaining ingredients. Bring to a good simmer put on the lid and toss in oven for an hour. I crush my rosemary with a pestle and that really releases the flavor. This is a great recipe. Very basic, easy and lots of flavor.

Made this dish for a Christmas party, and it was the perfect warm crowd-pleaser. My only suggestion would be to closely monitor the amount of rosemary added to the stew-  it can overwhelm the other flavors really quickly if you're not careful. Will make again.

Excellent recipe, although I added 1 cup of red wine, reduced water to 3 cups. After adding corn starch I blommed 1 envelope of unflavored gelatin in 1/2 cup of warm water and adde to pot.Simmered for 1 1/2 hrs. Delish!

Very good stew!  I found it a bit salty, so will reduce the number of beef buillons the next time.  My hubby loved it and didn't think it was too salty, but he also worked out before dinner, so it hit the spot for him.  Definitely would make it again.

This was ok.  I preseasoned and precooked the meat to sear in some flavor which helped.  I found the sauce to be too runny, even though I added the cornstarch.  I also found the flavor to be lacking and I did add some red wine to the sauce and the meat was seasoned.  I used the precut baby carrots and they were not soft enough after cooking 2 hours and neither were my potatoes, so I don't know if I was supposed to simmer it on a higher temperature than low or what.  So after all the 5 star ratings, I was a bit disappointed that it didn't turn out as I expected.

This is amazing...followed recipe exactly.  It bugs me when people rate recipes that they have completely changed..cause that is a new recipe!  :)  It is awesome.  I did think the sauce would thicken more...but it didn't matter!!!  Yummy!

I chose this recipe because so many people had rated it highly and it looked easy.  It is delicious!  The rosemary and pepper together make it memorable.  I have made it without cornstarch and let the liquid boil away.  Once, I substituted parsnip for the potato.  It worked just fine.    I like to know what I'm eating:  Next time, I may omit the bouillon and simply use salt.  This recipe is a keeper!  Thank you, Paula, for sharing it.

My husband always thanks me for dinner, but the night I made this he told me I really out did myself.  I will make again.  I did add a tablespoon of catchup, A-1, and Worcestershire like someone had recommended.

This was very good; first time I ever tried to make a stew.  I did brown the beef after coating with salt, pepper, and flour. Deglazed w/ red wine.  I added a few of my own extras; garlic, mushrooms, a pich of this and that.  You really can't go wrong as long as you stay close to the receipe. Added more corn starch to make thicker and it does have a taste on the peppery side (fine with me). If you aren't into pepper, cut that in half.  Cheers.

Love this simple yet great tasting recipe.  I added a few things - turnip, garlic, worchestershire sauce and some diced tomatos.  It turned out great and everyone loved it - especially my kids!

This was really good beef stew. I followed the exact recipe. The only thing I did different was add more cornstarch because I like a thicker stew but I think that is just preference. Besides that change it was perfect. So good!

Excellent!  My whole family loved it.  After I browned the meat, I realized that I didn't have beef bouillon or beef broth, or anything "beefy".  I used 4 cups of chicken broth with 3 tsp worchestershire sauce instead.  It worked great.  The stew was delicious!

I had never made beef stew before, and this was delicious!  I used baby red potatoes, and they cooked very fast.  I also used Montreal steak seasoning to give it more flavor.  Other than that, I really stuck to the recipe, and was very pleased with the results!

Amazing dish!  I put in baby white potatoes instead because I hate pealing and it turned out great.  I added 1/4 cup of water extra, 3 TBS Worcestershire sauce, 3 TBS of A-1 and 2 TBS of pepper - I liked it with a bit of a kick.

This was an absolute hit. I followed the recipe as is and everyone raved over it. Everything from the combination of spices to the suggested timing for simmering - the directions were true to their word. Meat was super tender and the flavour was out of this world. No one asked for salt, pepper, or hot sauce (which I always take as a compliment). It was really easy to do. Great recipe! Thank you!

Came out great! I did however add a dash more of Rosemary and black pepper. My family wanted the stew more soupy, so I kept the same amount of starch, but added 1/2c of water. Great stew, will definitely try it thicker next time!

I made several of the recommended changes: 1 c. of red wine in place of 1 c. of the water, coating the beef with flour/pepper/garlic powder before browning, adding a Tbs of ketchup and worchestshire sauce. I also used chicken broth in place of beef bouillon, and fresh rosemary because that's what I had. I found that I needed to add more liquid after the first hour-- about a cup. Then I omitted the cornstarch at the end because it was thick enough (stew but not thick gravy). Hearty and delicious!

This was amazing! However, I definitely agree with the reviewer who suggested adding red potatoes. I used russet, and even though I added them later than everything else, they still turned out mushy. Other than that though, this stew was so hearty and delicious!

This method of making beef stew was the most successful for me.  I will never make beef stew in the crockpot again!  The meat was so moist and tender, and tasty.  I didn't have the seasonings at hand.  Used chicken bouillon (which was a tad bit too sweet - would have been better with beef), worchestshire, a bit of soy, thyme, rosemary.  I also omitted the celery.  I didn't use cornstarch but had some smaller pieces  of potato that overcooked and fell apart to thicken the stew.   Will definitely be making this again and again.  Browning the meat is a must!  Aside from that, experiment with the seasonings.

Excellent basic stew recipe. No need to be fancy and this fits the bill! I add about 1 cup red wine when I have it on hand. I also put in a whole sprig of fresh rosemary with the simmering meat - this puts it over the top! Just pull out the stem before serving. Yum. Pure comfort food.

Absolutely lovely!! Just 'cause I had the time I pre-roasted the veggies in Olive Oil to add a greater depth of flavor. I also just used broth, a dash of rosemary, Worcestershire sauce and ketchup.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Very good, easy to make. Will use half the amount of black pepper next time. I usually make from scratch but this is just as good without using all the extra ingredients I usually use.  Will definately make again. Thanks!

Excellent flavors! My boyfriend and I have made this stew twice now (both times using elk meat) and it has turned out great! We followed the advice of earlier reviews and tossed the meat with garlic, rosemary, and flour prior to browning it and then placing it in the broth mixture. The meat turned out so tender it almost melts in your mouth!   We also added a tablespoon of both A1 sauce and Worcheshire sauce for a little extra boost of flavor. It was yummy! I used red potatoes and added them with only 45 minutes remaining so they wouldn't get too soggy.  We had rave reviews from our guests! Will definitely make many, many more times!

This was wonderful!  I've never successfully made stew where the meat didn't come out kinda tough, but this one turned out perfect.  I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I needed to add a bit more seasoning at the end for flavor and a LOT more cornstarch as it was thinner than we like stew to be.  We WILL be making it again though.  YUM

Sorry, I forgot to add that I included a pound of fresh mushrooms (quartered) since we love them.  When the stew was done, I also added some frozen peas and let them thaw/heat until done and served. Yummy!

My family LOVES this.  The flavor is awesome.  Each time I make it, I may substitute an ingredient according to what I have on hand, but I always use this recipe.  Tender, juicy meat, wonderful aroma.  Sometimes I add a can of tomatoes, but is just as good without it.

YUMMM eating for days. This is the first time I had ever made beef stew and it was pretty easy. Make sure not to add any additional salt before you taste it. The bouillon adds plenty. I coated the beef in 1/4 cup of flour and a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder and 1/2 teaspoon or pepper. I used 3 1/2 cups water and 1/2 cup of red wine for starters. I ended up adding about another 3/4 cup of water and splash of wine in the second hour of cooking. I also took the advice of others and used 6 teaspoons of cornstarch and water to thicken. I thought there were plenty of vegetables and no need to add more as others had recommended.

Mmmmmmm!  Instead of the beef bouillion and water, I used two 32 oz. beef stock boxes and approximately three cups of a nice red cabernet wine.  I added extra carrots and potatoes and threw in a box of freshly sliced baby bella mushrooms but eliminated the celery since I'm not a big fan of it. Added two bay leaves during the cooking process for additional flavor.  I also added garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper to a flour mix that I coated the meat with prior to cooking it.  Putting the mix in a plastic bag and adding the meat will evenly coat the meat.  Will definitely be making again.

Thank you, Paula, for the wonderful recipe. After learning some from the reviews and other recipes, I added some changes.  My difficult husband and I loved it so much.    I made it for 6 servings, and here is the changes: 1. Yes! I followed the ziploc bag advice (1/4 cup flour, 1tsp garlic and oniln powder) and the beef and shake it. 2. Used 4 carrots and stalks celery 3. Used beer for the half amount of the water 4. 2 cloves of garlic, minced 5. 1 tbs of paprika 6. 1 bay leaf 7. 1 1/2 tsp Worcestershire sauce  With the above changes, I just followed as directed.  It is the most wonderful beef stew I have ever had!

the rosemary gives this an amazing flavor..  i will keep making this year after year..  my whole family loved it, and i have some very picky eaters on my hands..  like others, i dredged the meat in seasoned flour before browning..  and i added red wine to the meat as it simmered.  other than that, i followed the recipe as is..  great!

I loved this stew. The beef came out tender and flavorful. The only minor changes I made were: I marinated the beef in soy sauce for 15 minutes to bring out the meat flavor and I did double the cornstarch. I followed the recipe the rest of the way. Excellent!

I really liked this stew recipe. I floured the meat before browning it, I don't know if I'll do that again. Used beef broth and seasoned with fresh rosemary, parsley flakes, black pepper, bay leaves, salt, a bit of ketchup and worcestershire sauce. Cooked the onions and a couple cloves of garlic in a pan before adding and left out the celery. Served it with fresh tea biscuits. My husband and I really liked the meal!

Thanks Paula,  I'm a stew guy so I really enjoyed this.  My wife also loved it.  I added a couple of mint leaves when served just to give it a local spin. It's clearly a 5 star.

I followed this recipe to the T and it was fantastic. My picky husband loved it and even my 7yrs old daughter kept asking for more. Very easy and delicious. The only change I made was that I cooked it in low in the crock pot for about 5 hours. I will make it over and over again.

Like several other reviewers I think this stew needs additional seasonings. Lots of it and different from what the recipe calls for. Initially I doubled the seasonings called for. it needs more celery and less potatoes.

This was the first time I've ever made stew and it was THE BEST! I didn't have dried rosemary on hand but I added one pouch of campbells cream of mushroom soup mix just for a bit more flavour, and some green onions...my friends loved it too!!! This will always be my stew recipe from now on... it's so quick and easy, I was shocked....

Excellent, really tasty !!! yummy ...I will for sure make it again...My husband wants it!

Update: April 2012/ If I could give this more stars I would... !! It's been a long time since I first saved this recipe ! and it's still in my faves !!  I probably make this once a month...  Substitute or add some vegetables or change some spices here and there depending on what I've got in the fridge !   Everyone in the family just loves it every time..

I made this with a few small changes suggested by others:  I tossed the beef cubes with a little flour and garlic and onion powder, and I added herbes de provence and some salt for seasoning.  The result was fantastic -- terrific flavor and the meat was very tender, even after only 90 minutes of cooking.  I'll be making this again!

Very nice easy stew. Only change I made, and I don't know why, is I threw a few spoonfuls of spicy salsa in there. Added a little spice to the stew I think.

This stew is so delicious (especially served with Quick Yeast Rolls found on Allrecipes)and I often make it.  The simple seasonings make it so you can add or delete any ingredients you want to. For instance, I leave out the celery and potatoes and only put in mushrooms and carrots.  I also cut my meat into tiny pieces and it is melt in your mouth delicious!

This was the second time that I made this recipe.  I left out the rosemary (husband doesn't like rosemary) and added a little red wine, other than that, I followed the recipe.  It turned out great!

Not for us.  Followed the recipe as written and found it bland.  There wasn't enough depth of flavor.  I also think the potatoes need to be added later.  It takes longer to cook carrots than potatoes so they shouldn't be added at the same time.  It also never really thickened up.  I suppose I could add more cornstarch but as written, this wasn't our favorite.

Best soup/stew I have EVER made. I was delighted, my husbnad was delighted. It was terrific. I added a half cup of wine instead of water, but added an extra cup of water at the end because I didn't follow instructions right and put everything into the pot at once... oops. Everything was great though. I want to be able to come up with recipes like this!

I loved this recipe.  I am not big on beef stew because it is usually so bland.  I took advice from some other reviews and put the meat in with flour, onion and garlic powders and pepper, then cooked it in a skillet.  In hindsight, I shouldn't have added more pepper in the stew also. It was delicious!

Great recipe. Like another person wrote. I put 1/4 flour, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp ground pepper in a bag and placed the meat in the bag and shake it until the meat is covered before cooking in oil. I also added 1/2 cup of red cooking wine, added salt and used four teaspoons of corn starch and water for an awesome beef stew.

I love this beef stew recipe and it is the only one I make now. I made a few changes such as using flour to thicken instead of cornstarch. I also substitute the rosemary with Basil (I am not a fan of rosemary) and it makes it delicious. We pair it with Pilsbury Country biscuits and it is a keeper in our home. 
Wonderful recipe!

I made this stew for the first time 2 weeks ago and made it again last night. This is one of the best beef stews I have ever had!! the only thing I did different was to triple the amount of cornstarch since I prefer my stew thicker. Thanks for submitting this recipe!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I made it in the crock pot, but made sure to brown the meat on the stove first. I also used about 1/2 C of red wine instead of all water. I also left out the onion. Thanks for a great meal!

This was a hit! I was a bit concerned that the rosemary would be overpowering, but it was just right. I did use 2 cans of beef broth instead of water/bouillon. I also added a 1/2 cup of red wine. I browned the meat w/ minced garlic and pepper before putting it in my crockpot. Cooked on low for about 8 hours. The meat and vegetables were perfectly cooked. To thicken the sauce, I used about 1/3 cup of instant potato flakes. Thank you for the great new stew recipe.

I love beef stew!.. This recipe was very close to my recipe, but this was the first time I added rosemary and parsley.  It came out very tasty!  I added just a little more water along with the vegetables to be sure I had enough gravy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great stew, i made some minor changes. 
I used 1.5 cans of Swanson beef broth and 1/3 cup Merlot wine in place of the water and boulian cubes. I also added 2 bay leaves, coated my meat in a bag with flour, SP, onion powder. Added a sqeeze of ketchup and A1 after I browned the meat. Doubled the cornstarch. Used red potatoes. Yummy!!!

My boyfriend HATES stews and he loved this!! He even wants me to make this beef stew again! The only change I made was like another reviewer suggested, I threw the beef in with some garlic powder and flour first and then threw it in the pan. Also, I added 4 tbsp of cornstarch because we like our stew thick!

Ok, I know many of you hate when people alter the recipe, but here's what I did. I scaled the recipe in half, first of all. I added 3 cloves of chopped garlic while sauteing the beef, as well as some Montreal Chicken Seasoning. I used fresh rosemary and parsely (three times the amount of dried herbs). I used beef broth instead of the boullion, 1 and a half cans, to be exact. I put in the celery, carrots, and onion first, then added the potatoes during the last half hour of cooking. I also added cut green beans. I doubled the amount of starch as well. The end result was phenomenal. My boyfriend said it was the best beef stew he'd ever had!

A wonderful recipe!  I did do some altering according to my family's taste.  I added double the veggies and added extra meat.  I also used 1 can of beef broth in place of the water.  For a thicker "stew-like" broth I tripled the cornstarch.  Even the pickiest family members loved it!

This was a good basic stew. I used beef stock rather than bouillon cubes & fresh rosemary instead of dried. I didn't realize I was out of carrots until I was done browning all of the beef & not wanting to go to the store, I just left them out. I'll buy some to add to the leftovers because beef stew really should have carrots, according to my Gramma. Thanks for the recipe:o)

Delicious and hearty!! I substituted red potatoes, which added a nice look and elegance.  I will add more vegetables next time, as the meat was dominant and a heavy meal.  The spicing was great, no changes there.  We also shortened the cooking time, as the meat was very tender and vegetables cooked 15 minutes earlier than estimated.  All in all, a wonderful main dish!!

Yum Yum!  Very easy and delicious.  Hardly any prep work.  I bought stew meat, so it was already cut up.  And just chopped up the veggies.  Before cooking, I rolled the meat in flour and garlic powder.  I also reduced the liquid to 3 cups and replaced one cup of water for one cup of red wine.  And tripled the amount of cornstarch as well.  The broth is very tasty and the meat is tender.  Will definitely make this again.

GREAT recipe!!!  This is my first attempt ever making stew.  It came out delicious!!! 
 I used 4 cups of beef broth, rather than the boullions.  
   I also marinated the beef in a ziploc with some worchester sauce and 1 chopped garlic clove for about 1 hour.  Since I'm not a celery lover, I replaced it with thawed frozen peas and a can of corn.
I will be making this alot.  Thanks!!

This was really great!  I, too, added extra cornstarch; I also used the Better than Boulion and floured the beef before cooking in olive oil.
I don't usually cook with dried Rosemary...not a big fan of the "stick" texture!  But this was definitely tasty and will be made again & again.

This was great!  This is wonderfull and doesn't take nearly as much time as the other recipes for beef stew take, and the beef is just as tender.  Before I browned my meat I covered it in Garlic powder and crushed pepper.  I also dredged it in flour.  As previous reviewers did, I added about 4 teaspoons of cornstarch and water.  Mine finished cooking before the 2 hours was up...about 1 hr 40 mins.

This was really good, but with some changes,  I also floured the meat, sub. 1/2 C. wine for the water, and deglazed the pan with the wine after I took the meat out. Added the meat back and better then boullion disolved in water.  I also doubled the cornstarch and water and simmered 1/2 hr. but it wasn't thick enough so I added another 2 TBS. of both and about 2 TBS of tomato paste.  Simmered another 1/2 hr. or longer but I would have liked it a little thicker.

Outstanding!  I made the slow cooker beef stew for a side by side taste test and this one was the winner.  The only variance from the recipe was the 6 teaspoons of cornstarch and 6 teaspoons of water.  This is a keeper.

This a really good basic recipe. You can virtually add any veggie to it. The only thing I added was a can of tomato soup and skipped the cornstarch part. The stew had a tomato-beef broth  fantastic!

This was amazing and easy.  I substituted frozen green beans for celery, as I hadn't any celery.  Instead of bullion or broth, I used a base called "better than bullion" in the same ratio.  I loved the stew, and can't wait to make a quadruple batch this winter!  YUM!

This is a great recipe for simplicity.  I thought it was very good except it could use a bit of some saltand I had to double the cornstarch/water to thicken the liquid.  I also added a container of fresh sliced mushrooms.  I thought this was a great fall/winter stew.  Excellent!!

Delicious!  I doubled the water too and added 2 packets of au jus which gave it a rich brown color.  I had left over sirlion from the 4th that we grilled and I couldn't bare to see it wasted so I cut it up and froze it until I could try this recipe.  I also used the suggestion to brown my meat in a couple T of flour too.  I also had 4 cobs of corn that had already been cooked, so I cut the corn off the cob and threw that in too.  What a great way to use up what was in my fridge!  It was just the right thickness and flavor.  A true comfort food recipte that I will make again and again.

The stew was lovely. Some tips, you might want to use a bit more water as 4 cups are not enough for all the ingredients. Also, if you're using black pepper corns, a sprinkle is enough. I must admit that I was too liberal with the pepper and while my family loves pepper, I thought I should have used less. Also, I marinated the meat with garlic and Worchestshire sauce and it was great!

This was better than expected. I modified the recipe slightly and changed or added: 1.75lbs (i cubed to 3/4") stew meat, about a 1.5c baby carrots halved or third instead of large carrots, 4 med/large yukon gold potatoes peeled and chopped to 3/4" cubes, 4oz sliced mushrooms, decreased pepper to 1/4t-but added 1/2t montreal steak seasoning for added kick, and 1/3C flour to dredge meat prior to browning + remaining flour for thickening instead of cornstarch. I was running short on time so i simmered meat and potatoes together for 1/2 hr, then added remaining ingredients as recipe stated for additional 1 hr 10 min except for the mushrooms which i added last 1/2 hr. Two preschoolers and picky husband all liked it! Meat was tender, not tough and veggies cooked just right. Served with a leftover wholegrain sourdough bread.

I just made this last night. I've always had trouble with my beef stew coming out too bland. This recipe was great. My husband really enjoyed it. I used beef broth as a substitute for the water to give it more flavor and I put the potatoes in with the meat at the very beginning since they sometimes take a little longer to cook. It was very, very good. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

Great basic recipe, one can easily alter it to suit your own tastes. I added more veggies; corn, geen beans, peas, mushrooms, and cabbage. Also added garlic and some dried tarragon. Upped water about 2 cups and added more "Better Than Boullion". Very yummy, thanks for sharing!

Very impressive.  The meat was so tender and flavorful.  I wished it would have been a little thicker.  I tweaked reciped by omitting the onion and celery and adding green beans, corn, peas, and a shot of worcestershire.  Turned out great.

Absolutely one of the most flavorful stews I've had.  My family doesn't like celery so I substituted frozen corn.  Otherwise I followed the directions to a T and it was a hit!!

This stew was 5-star in a comfort-food sort of way.  It was just like a recipe my mom used when I was a kid.  I took the advice of some reviews and coated my meat in flour to brown, but I don't think this was necessary.  I didn't add the corn starch at the end because it had already become very thick -- I had to add water twice to keep it from burning, and I had it covered!  Next time I'll stick with the recipe as written.

Very good.  I didn't simmer the meat for an hour before adding the vegetables though, I threw in the vegetables and let it all simmer for the 2 hours.  Towards the end I also cut up some biscuit dough to make some dumplings.

Delish! I used leftover pot roast, so I decreased the cooking time, and added a bit more cornstarch, as I found that the 2 teaspoons called for, wasn't quite enough to thicken it as much as we like.

Yummy!  This is total comfort food for me.  Although it did take some time to make, the end result is fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for doubling the cornstarch/water mixture to make it a bit thicker.  I wouldn't change anything else!!!

I halved the recipe & didn't have a lot of time so made a quicker version of it (browned beef, added veggies & sauteed for about 5 minutes, then added boullion, simmered for an hour, adding cornstarch in the last 15 minutes)& it still came out great! Next time will make whole batch & serve over egg noodles - mmmmmm...

Fantastic turn out!  I used deer meat instead of beef and it was amazing.  I too used a couple of bay leaves in it.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this!!! I have made this many times since finding the recipe and had to come back to update my review from last year. I highly suggest adding a cup of red wine; I have made it both ways - with and without and it is like 2 different stews. I have even gone out for wine when I didn't have any around just to add to this stew. I also add 4 -6 tsp of cornstarch as we like a thick stew. Flavor is perfect.

The BEST beef stew recipe I have ever tried!  I left out the celery (I just don't care for the taste of cooked celery) and added some frozen green peas.  Delicious!

This beef stew has become a regular favorite in my household.  I make it with 1 tsp. of Italian Seasoning since I don't have dried rosemary and it always comes out fantastic.  I usually add a bit more water (1/2 - 1 cup more) since it is pretty spicy.  I've made other "thicker" beef stews with tomatoes and red wine but this is totally different.  It's more like beef soup with vegetables and my husband and I LOVE it everytime.

Delicious, excellent flavor.  After starting, I didn't realize I didn't have enough beef bouillon, so I lessened the water and added 2 1/2 times the corn starch as well.  For stew instead of soup, definately increase the corn starch and/or decrease the water.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is and it turned out great.

Used vension which can be a little tougher, so I cooked it for 2 hours before adding the vegetables.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Very good basic stew.  Will make again.
Thanks

Wow, this was delicious! It had so much flavor and the meat was very tender. After cooking the meat for an hour I let it sit (with the stove off) for almost another hour. I also added 1 package of dry brown onion soup mix when I added the carrots and potatoes. Then I cooked it for only about 30 minutes...the carrots and potatoes were done. I put it in a hotpot (something they use here in Africa) and kept it warm for three hours until we were ready to eat. The whole family loved it! I just made it yesterday, and they're ready for me to make it again!

I thought this was just okay. I went by some of the other reviews and added a cup of wine and corn and some more cornstarch. I must say though, I thought this was too salty. Maybe just 1 boullion cube less would be okay. I don't know. My husband thought it was fine. Maybe it was just me.

I took pieces of all the advice and came up with some additions.  Instead of 4 cups of water, I used 3 cups and 1 cup of red wine.  I also used two cloves of chopped garlic when I browned the beef.  I added an extra potato which pretty much thickened the stew so the extra corn starch wasn't needed.  A small can of tomato paste was added during the last simmer.  Came out really great, I was impressed since I think I have pretty much cooked 5 dishes in my whole life.  Great recipe.

This was ok-- kind of plain, even after I added garlic powder, merlot, extra pepper, etc. After an hour the carrots still weren't done. It needed way more cornstarch, as others have already noted, to get it to thicken. I won't make this again.

Very good--I added shredded zucchini and only cooked the vegetables about 20 minutes so they were not mushy.  I also added an extra can of beef broth to create more gravy.

While eating this for lunch today my husband told me it is the best stew he has ever had. Can't do better than that!
I did modify slightly by using only one potato and adding corn and peas. This is a keeper. Thanks.

This is a great stew especially if you don't have a lot of time.  I added about a half a bag of frozen mixed vegetables at the last 20 minutes or so.  I'll be making this again for sure!

This was good! I think for next time I will grind up the dried rosemary first. I don't typically add salt prior to serving so we added a lot of salt after bring out the flavor some more. My husband ate this served over wide cut egg noodles with a little of the broth since he's not a fan of soups.

This recipe is great when you want beef stew in a hurry. I used a pressure cooker both times i've made this dish. First i browned the seasoned(salt & pepper) beef, then added all my ingredients minus the slurry. I use yukon gold potatoes instead of russet, they keep their shape better. Since i needed to cut back on the liquid (b/c i used a pressure cooker)I used two cans of beef broth instead of the water & bullion mix. After 25 minutes in the pressure cooker,i reseasoned, and then added the slurry, brought stew to a boil, and it was ready to eat. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe (=

This was delicious. I used some steaks from my freezer that I had purchased on sale a couple weeks ago and the meat was super tender while the veggies were just a little crisp and not mushy. I like a thicker stew so I blended about a 1/4 cup of flour with some of the broth at the end of the cooking period.

I made this stew for my boyfriend's birthday and it was stupendous! I browned the beef with flour, garlic powder and pepper and also substituted a cup of yellowtail red wine instead of 1 cup water. We couldn't get enough! I also served slices of beer bread - a great accompaniment.

Very simple, and low maintenance cooking.

~Too much rosemary, in my opininon. I will definitely use 1/2 the amount next time.

~I also added at least 4X the amount of cornstarch listed--I like my stew thick.

~Very satisfying, simple dinner. Thanks!

This was great!  I substituted beef broth for the bouillion cubes, and olive oil in place of the vegetable oil.  Otherwise, the flavor was fantastic and it came out super tender!  This will be a regular in our house...Thanks! :)

Really good stew! Lots of flavor, and very filling. I think my potatoes were too large though, because the thing was overrun with potatoes. I'll use smaller or fewer next time, and/or add more beef. Thanks for the great recipe!

fabulous!!! I've already given the recipe to 4 people, I loved it, kids loved it, and hubby loved it! I did add one can of beef broth just for a little more flavor. Thanks for a great chilly day meal!

I definately had to add additional corn starch to thicken it up, but it tasted delicious! A couple of things that I did differently, were using green beans & corn rather than onions, those would never go over in my house!  And I added some tomato paste to give  it a little kick.  It was yummy! Great, easy recipe!

This stew was great!  I did make a few substitutions - I didn't have any beef boullion so I used 2 cans beef broth.  I also forgot to add onion, and substituted flour for the cornstarch.  Also, I ended up needing to leave about half way through cooking, so it cooked (on low) for ~1 hour longer than the recipe called for, and it still turned out wonderful.  I halved the recipe, but there are only 2 of us, so we had a little over half leftover, and my husband ate ALL the leftovers for lunch the next day!  I will definitely be making this again.

This was really good. I changed it a little bit however by adding some worcestershire sauce as well as more corn starch. Very good, my husband loved it. Thank you.

This was a fabulous recipe!!!  I was so tired of the old recipe I was using.  I found this recipe to be so flavorful. Simmering the meat for an hour made it extremely tender.  I Doubled the amount of cornstarch and water to make it more thick.  Excellent, Excellent Recipe!!!!

Loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to flour the beef before frying.  I left the pot uncovered for the last 15 mins. and then let it cook another 15 mins. while I made biscuits.  It came out perfect plus it made my entire house smell great!  Would definately make this again!

This is THE Beef Stew recipe.  It's never been one of my favorite meals until now.  Instead of the cornstarch, I dredged the meat in flour and browned it a batch at a time in the dutch oven. The result is a thick, rich, flavorful stew that everyone I make it for proclaims is the best ever!  Thank you for this recipe!

Great Recipe!  I used salt, pepper and garlic powder to season the meat while it cooked.  I used premade beef broth instead of water and added a few bay leaves with the rosemary while the beef simmered.  Instead of corn starch I used Potato Buds (1-2 cups, depending on preference) to thicken the stew - better consistency and taste!  Easy to make - a keeper!

great tasting stew - I will definitely make it again.  I browned the meat first, then simmered in a crockpot.  Adjustments - am going to try dredging the meat in flour before browning (it was very watery, as some others have mentioned), it needed more liquid and at least 3 hours of simmering time using this method.  Thanks.

This stew is fantastic! Others said to reduce the amount of bouillon, but I used the full amount and it was perfect. I was short on time and cut out the first hour of cooking before the vegetables were put in.  As long as the chunks of meat are small enough, the meat is still very tender. We'll definately be making this one again and again.

Added two cloves garlic (need more) and one can of spiced, diced tomatoes, floured and breaded the beef cubes and excluded the cornstarch.  Only used 2 bouillon cubes and 3 cups of water as suggest by others, 4 would have been too many.  This way turned out great!  Gravy was really good with buttered bread. Nummy!

I followed recipe prety much exact except I floured beef before cooking in oil as per almost every beef recipe. It came out "ok", and not sure if this alteration caused it to be mediocre at best.  Was also kind of watery as others have commented. I ended up using probably alittle too much cornstarch which may have deep-sixed the whole dish.

I didn't change a thing about this recipe.  This was the best stew I have ever tasted!  My husband and picky daughter loved it!  The meat literally melts in your mouth.  My 5 year old daughter is not crazy about meat, unless it's chicken tenders, and the first thing she said was, "Good meat mom!"  That was enough for me to add this to our permanent recipe file.  It's also delicious left over.

This soup is fantastic and easy.  It reminds me of the stew my mother used to make.  I only recomend peeling your carrots before boiling.  I also add more cornstarch to make it thicker.  I definitly recomend this to any one looking for a more traditional stew.

This stew is fantastic.  Added 1 cup less water because I found it a bit liquidy.  Also needed to add more cornstarch to thicken.  My 10 year old has been begging me to make this stew all summer.

This was a great basic stew.  The rosemary gives it a really nice flavour.  It's not too bland - I found it just right.  Next time I think I'll double it so that we actually have leftovers!  I added quite a bit more cornstarch than the recipe called for to thicken it up.

I thought this recipe was easy to follow, and the meat came out very tender. I used mostly stewing beef, but added about 3/4 lb. of lamb meat so I could call it Irish Stew! Sue

This was nice and had good flavour.  I doubled the gravy, and hence the spices.   I didn't need to double the gravy, and the rosemary was a little overpowering.  Next time I'll just make half the extra gravy and not double the rosemary.  My husband and 6-year old enjoyed Will definately make again.

This was great.  I love to make meals that are cooking while I clean up the kitchen before we eat.  This was very tasty and not at all bland.  We did season each serving with some kosher salt.  I had to add a lot of water because it was evaporating too fast and it'll didn't dilute in flavor.  Very good...even great.

This beef stew was delicious!  Had enough zing for those who love flavor, and was not so spicey to disturb the tastebuds of those who like bland food.  Excellent!

This is my favorite beef stew recipe of all time and is so yummy it reminds me of my grandmother’s cooking!  I shake the beef cubes in a bag first with flour, salt and pepper before browning. Then in a Dutch oven I brown the onion with a ton of minced garlic and add a cup+ of red wine that I bring to a boil before adding a bay leaf.  In the last 20 minutes or so my husband adds his homemade dumplings and it’s perfection!  The kids gobble it up.

I made this over the weekend and WOW, was it GOOD!  I LOVE garlic, so I added some garlic powder and I always add a packet or 2 (depending on how many servings) of Sazon seasoning to any of my soups or stews so I added 1 packet of that as well. I also added 1.5 TBSP of Mrs. Dash Garlic & Herb seasoning to it.  This stew was fabulous and I let it simmer for almost 3 hours and it's true -- the longer the BETTER!  I will be making this quite often from now on!

Great recipe! Easy to make and delicious. Makes a nice sized pot.  Only things I did different was a little less onion, and when chopping veggies I chopped a little smaller, and so second hour of cooking time only needed 45 minutes. Really great Beef Stew!

I used 1 less potato just because I'm not big on white potato's because their just not that healthy, also didn't care for the msg's in the bullion cubes so substituted a heathier stock and used quality angus beef and it turned out pretty good, would definitely make it again

This was great!  I did use Better than Bouillon instead of bouillon cubes and added great beans to it. After reading other reviews, I added potatoes the last half hour and the green beans the last 15 minutes. Wonderful recipe!!

The only thing I did different was to add more cornstarch to make a thicker beef stew. This recipe is a keeper! The stew was flavorful and even my husband, who is sometimes picky about trying new foods, said it was delicious.

Love this recipe. We followed the suggestion to add red wine during the deglazing. One other thing I did is used flour, not corn starch, to thicken. I will make this again!

After I cooked everything for 2 hours I added canned whole tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce to give it a more tomato based taste. I then cooked it for an additional 25 minutes. I never did add the spices as I was out of them but it still tasted great! This is a good recipe and pretty easy to fix!

This is an excellent recipe. I did vary my measurements a little, as I like LOTS of flavor in my foods. I doubled the amount of Rosemary, Parsley Flakes and Corn Starch. I added 3 Tablespoons of Garlic Powder &  added 2 Tbspoons of Worcherstire Sauce when cooking the Beef. I also added 1 can of drained peas during last 10 mins of cooking. This was an awesome stew that sticks with you!?

Good, simple beef stew recipe, easy to make and exactly what you want on a cold winter day. Substituting a cup of red wine for a cup of water is highly recommended.

Green onions, green parts only to make Fodmap. We enjoy thyme and so added in equal amounts of Rosemary and Parsley.

This stew is very good! I did make some changes based on the reviews: Here is what I did. in a bag I put 1/4 cup flour, teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder. 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Put the stew meat in, and shook it up baby! Then I cooked it up in my ( cast iron ) dutch oven and seared in those flavors. This really put some great flavor on that meat and the yummy bits stuck to the bottom of the cast iron pan easily came off during the deglazing with the liquids. I didn't cut back on any liquids..actually you will probably want to add more towards the middle-end of the cooking time. I used 1/2 cup of red wine during the deglazing with the other liquids. I thought it needed more vegetables since I made this recipe 2 weeks ago staying true to the recipe..but this time when I did it, I added an extra ( 1 more carrot, celery, potato ) I added 1/2 of an extra onion. I also took the advise of another reviewer and added 1 tblspn each of ketchup, A-1 sauce, and wistersire sauce that really gave it some full-bodied flavor...

This was excellent! I took suggestions and added Worcestershire sauce. I also added a package of 15 bean soup beans (cooked separately). That made the broth nice and thick. I made a huge pot for a larger group and got rave reviews. The only thing was that I would have added way more vegetables, like maybe double the carrots and other veggies. So many possibilities for this delicious recipe.

Maybe my onion was TOO large? The amount of onion was entirely too overpowering and this ended up inedible. 

I may try this recipe again with about 1/4 the amount of onion indicated in the recipe.

I made this in my crockpot. I cooked the meat for a couple of hours on high with everything except the veggies and corn starch. Then added the veggies and corn starch for about 30 min. The only complaint I had? Not enough!

I made this for the family a couple of weeks ago and it got a "thumbs up" review.  So I am going to make it again this evening and try the suggestion of adding a stout beer to see how that enhances recipe.  Either way I am keeping this as my go to beef stew recipe.

I followed the suggestions of the top comment (coat beef in flour/seasoning mixture, added 1T ketchup and 1T Worcestershire). Also added 1 cup beer with the broth. I doubled the veggies but it needed more liquid than the recipe called for (maybe 2 more cups of broth).

This was soooooo good!!! The only changes I made were substituting 1c water with 1c red wine, doubled the cornstarch and instead of 1t rosemary I used 1t herbs de Provence (I was out of rosemary!). I served this over biscuits I made from Bisquick and milk. Yum!! Everyone loved it!

Love this recipe as a base and have made it several times with slight variations. I always use white sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes which creates a wonderful savory sweetness. As per other reviews, I coat the beef with a flour mixture (1/4 c flour, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1/2 tsp pepper) and throw that all into a gallon ziplock back with the beef and shake it up) before browning. There never seems to be enough liquid so after the first hour I add a beer (a pale ale is what I had) and this time a can of spicy tomato juice (V8). I always use a a few extra carrots and celery. I didn't have beef bouillon this time so used chicken broth instead and I couldn't even tell the difference. It makes a lot and we've eaten it  for dinner 3 nights in a row and I think maybe it's more delicious each day. I always wonder why I don't make this more. It is so easy, makes great leftovers and I feel like it's hard to mess it up. It has always turned out great.

So I actually tweaked a few things on this recipe and it came out amazing. I followed the suggestion of other reviews and tossed the beef in 1/4 cup flour and 1tsp of both onion and garlic powders and 1/2 tsp of pepper before browning. When I first added the water I added 1 tsp of basil and 1/4 tsp of Thyme, 1 tbsp of both Worcestershire Sauce and Balsamic Vinegar. Then I added 1 additional cup of water and 1 additional bouillon when I added the veggies. It was perfection!

Very nice stew. Just a little heavy on the rosemary. Chuck Simpson's comment about adding a little body looks like a great idea. Otherwise, a great recipe.

A good base recipe but it was a little to thick and think about the amount of pepper.  If you like pepper its OK but I think it was to much to begin with.

I've made this several times as is, and we really like it! I like the rosemary a lot. I add cabbage (cuz who doesn't love cabbage in a stew) but other than that I didn't change anything. It's really simple and tasty every time!

Excellent recipe. I followed directions except for sautéing the vegetables prior to adding them to beef for stewing.  A new family stew has been added to our favourites as it was enjoyed by old and young alike.

It was perfect! I didn't change a thing (except I used 4c of beef broth instead of boullion and 4c water). I imagine if I made a double batch there would be enough leftovers and it would be fabulous the second day!

Very good basic recipe. I did make a few changes based on other reviews, flour and seasoning to beef before browning, extra veggies and some A-1 and ketchup for flavor.
This is easily tweaked to ones own tastes and is very easy to assemble.
I will make this again.

I love the recipe.  The second time I made it I omitted the celery because I don't like celery in my stew.  I added more cornstarch to thicken.  Others have added red wine, as soon as you add red wine your recipe is no longer stew it becomes beef bourguignion.

Quick and easy to prepare and was ready to eat in 2 hours. I did make a few adjustments by following another person’s review. I put 1/4 cup flour, a tbsp each of pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder in zip lock bag then added beef to coat. Then I sautéed garlic before adding beef to olive oil to brown and sear in flavor. I didn’t use red wine to deglaze prior to adding beef stock but next time I will. Then I added stock and veggies. In addition to what the original recipe called for I did add Worcestershire sauce and ketchup for additional flavor like one review had said along with salt and pepper for flavoring. Overall this was a good meal for a cold New England evening. My husband and 3 year old enjoyed it too!

I’ve never had a beef stew come out this good! I omitted the rosemary (not a fan). In place of rosemary I used 1 tablespoon of Mrs Dash. I needed to do three rounds of the corn starch to get it thick enough for my liking. 
I bought my stew meat from Aldi...it already cut up. 
Delicious!

IT WAS PERFECT.  The meat was very tender and the vegetables were firm and very tasty.

My only change was draining the stew meat and adding the vegetables to the browned meat to soften for a few minutes before adding liquids.

Excellent starter recipe. Like others, definitely add Worcestershire & ketchup (1tbs each), plus cornstarch. Added 1 cup mushrooms & 1/2 cup bell peper.

In the words of my family, this was "outstanding!"
I did add 1 tsp of crushed garlic at the end of browning the meat (so not to burn it), 1 tsp of thyme, and extra cornstarch for a thicker gravy.  This will be my "go to" recipe for stew from now on.

I enjoyed the stew, and it made a decent size batch.  Like others have mentioned, it did need a bit more water, and i had to add extra cornstarch to thicken.  I was going to use rosemary, but found out I was out, and wasn't about to go out in a snowstorm to get some, so I substituted with thyme.  That worked beautifully.  Next time, I will try rosemary, and see which one I like best.

Made this today following the recipe exactly, and it’s one of the best beef stews ever!  Did have to add a little beef stock to thin a bit.  Will definitely be making again.

I used Better Than Bouillon instead of the cubes. I doubled the veggies. I used frozen pearl onions instead of chopped onions because my husband hates onions. I also added freshly peeled white onions.

I used organic bee broth instead of the bouillon cubes and tripled the cornstarch.  I found it a bit bland and added some worcestershire sauce. Next time I would substitute some red wine, as others recommended, and some garlic powder.  Otherwise, this was a very easy and tender recipe.

This was delicious. My only thing was that it took way more than 4 cups of broth. Like I had to double it. I added more spices to it to fix it but after it was delish. Repeat for sure.

Two words:  Awe some!  I dredged my stew meat in flour and cooked it in olive oil first.  Half way in, I had to add more water while cooking and added some red wine, ketchup and worcestershire sauce (to taste) like others suggested.  This was an awesome meal and is now my favorite beef stew.

Excellent Old Style Recipe! The only adjustment I made was 2 cups of red cooking wine to 2 cups water. Came out GREAT! Thanks for sharing. Brought me back to childhood days when my mother would get a "meat order" and stew beef was a part of it. I ALWAYS looked forward to that day. Now my children will too! Again, Thank You for sharing!

I am unsaving all my other beef stew recipes. This is that good. I subbed frozen mixed veggies (diced carrots, corn, and green beans) for the carrots in an effort to empty the freezer, and I halved the recipe since we just didn't need that much stew. I wish I had made the full recipe and frozen half instead now, though! Lesson learned. The flavor is rich, and the stew is very hearty... pure comfort food. Serve with crusty bread and enjoy!

Very good! I'm a recipe following cook and this stew turned out perfectly. The flavor was amazing and the meat was so tender while still leaving the veggies a bit crunchy. Everyone loved it!

Love this stew!  We eat it all through fall and winter. I took recommendations to put the meat in flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper mix. Other than that the recipe is great!

Tender beef and veggies in a thick broth.  I will up the spices next time, it is good but needs a little more spice.

Used a little less onion than the recipe called for, also added 2 cloves of garlic. Almost perfect. Quick and easy. Monitor your potatoes well, as an hour can definitely overcook them even while simmering.

I didn’t have a slow cooker, so I used just a regular oven. Cooked the meat until brown on the stove, and then put in the oven with the other ingredients at 400 degrees for about an hour.  This was absolutely delicious! I did season the meat and everything else also with garlic powder, onion powder, meat tenderizer, steak seasoning, pepper, seasoned salt, rosemary, thyme, and parsley. Keeper recipe!

We absolutely love this stew.  I normally add in a cup of red wine to replace one of the cups of water, I feel it gives a bit more body to it, but even as is it's the best stew I have ever had.

It was more bland than I thought it would be with the following changes I picked up from other cooks:
---before cooking, coat the meat in 1/4 cup flour, 1 Tblsp each garlic & onion powder, 1/2 tsp. each seasoned salt & pepper                                                                                                        ---1 cup red wine to deglaze pot after meat cooked
---1 Tblsp each worcestshire sauce and ketchup, 2 tsp. fish sauce (I didn't have A1 sauce) with the liquids
---I added one extra carrot and celery & 1/2 extra onion
---Smashed 6-8 pieces of potato to thicken
---cooked an extra 15 minutes with cover off to thicken
---added steamed peas to the individual bowls before serving

I’ve made the original recipe several times. I’ve since modified. The onions and celery are aromatics I cook the with 1 garlic clove in the oil before adding the beef until the onions are translucent. Instead of red wine I use 1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce when browning meat. Other than that I follow the recipe

Mine turned out yummy!! We ate ours over rice. I also added some heavy cream and put a little butter on the veggies before putting them in with the meat. We used organic grass fed beef and we didn’t use celery.

This is a great base. For the broth I did half red wine, half water and added more spices. I seasoned my meat with Creole seasoning and added more Creole seasoning to the broth along with Italian seasoning, a little bit of garlic powder and cayenne. The flavor was amazing.

Very good! Used herbs de Provence of herbs in recipe. Also, matched the amount of bullion with the amount of liquid prescribed in bouillon package. If you replace some of the water with sherry wine, it kicks it up a notch!

Love this recipe. I have made this multiple times with only minor changes. I double the water, seasonings and cornstarch to make more broth. I added green peppers, onion powder and a little bit of salt as well. Sooo good! Double double toil and trouble y’all!

Good thing I  tasted it beforehand. It was incredibly bland. I added a lot of crushed garlic, salt, white pepper, onion powder, and a bay leaf, then cooked it longer. I also added green peas at the end. It was delicious, but at that point it was like a whole 'nother recipe.

This was good. I followed the recipe exactly, but it didn't turn out how I expected. The liquid evaporated in the pot. I may try again and add more water or beef broth.

I would definitely make this again.  I made a few small changes, though. Instead of 4 cups of water, I used 3 cups of water and 1 cup of beef broth. Instead of 3 potatoes and 4 carrots, I added 5 potatoes and 3 carrots. I also did not add celery or onions.

This is my second time making this dish. The first time, my brother and step dad had two bowls each and they don't usually eat my cooking so I decided to make it again. Instead of celery I add mushrooms.

Ive made this recipe many times and my family loves it! The only thing I changed is I add 2 teaspoons of cornstarch when the broth is cooking, then once I add the vegetables I add two more teaspoons to thicken it up a bit. I also season the beef cubes with adobo, but thats just my Puerto Rican twist!

Will absolutely make this again! I did it very close to the recipe. The only things that I changed is I added a little bit more cornstarch but that's just because I like a bit of a thicker gravy. So when adding a bit more cornstarch and water I threw an extra bouillon cube in. This recipe rocks!

I used about 2 1/2 lbs stew beef. Floured with garlic powder, onion powered & pepper. Brown in oil oil. used between 2 - 2 cartons of beef broth & just a touch of worcestershire sauce scrapiing the bottom well. Used extra carrot, celery, onion & potatoes. I cooked the beef alone for 1 1/2 hours & then with veg for1  1/2 hours. I also used red potatoes instead of white to hold up to  cooking time. Also threw in 2 cloves minced garlic with veg. Slowly increased cornstarch mixture to get correct consistency.

I made a few small changes and it turned out great. Instead of billion cubes I used Better than Bullion paste. A ton better on beef flavor and hardly any salt so you can salt as needed. I added a couple cloves of minced garlic. On the cornstarch I used 3 tsps with 3 tsps cold water. I recommend red skin potatoes as the russets break down and become mushy before the other vegetables cook. Also cut the carrots into thinner pieces of you want them to absorb the beef flavor. Other than that great recipe.

Fabulous!
I added paprika, used turnips instead of potatoes. I didn't have beef bullion so used vegetable broth with onion flakes and garlic powder.
I also made dumplings on top.

I tried making it as written but it seemed pretty watery and lacking in flavour, so I added extra beef stock powder and a couple tsp instant gravy mix. Also needed a lot of extra cornstarch - maybe 1/2 cup instead of the 2tsp mentioned. Also didn't have celery so subbed sweet potato. Cooked for an extra hour or so because it usually makes things like this better. Everyone loved it and I got Accolades.

Delicious, flavorful stew with fork tender beef.  Loved the simplicity of this recipe.  Sure, you could add wine, beer, catsup or any number of things you find in your pantry, but  there is absolutely no need as long as you use  a good sear to carmelize the meat.  Here's how to get perfectly carmelized, tender beef in your stew:  Forget the overpriced cubed stew meat (who knows what it is or where it's been) and go for a 3 pound chuck roast instead.  Chuck is your best choice.  Slice into cubes yourself.  Leave on a little of the fat for flavor, but don't go crazy.  You can skim the fat later as you cool the stew.  Flour or don't  flour  your beef prior to your sear - my personal preference is to flour to avoid some of the spatter when you sear in the oil, and to  provide thickening .  The critical step: Each cube should be seared on every side until all sides are a  rich brown - darker than what is shown in the video.  Use medium high heat.  It's improtant to sear your beef in batches.  If you crowd the pan, you get a grey mess of steamed beef.  Don't stir while you sear.  Let each side get carmelized and medium brown, then turn with tongs as in the video.  When you smell the wonderful aroma of browned beef, it's ready to turn.  I use my Dutch oven.  It takes me 20 minutes or so to batch cook and sear my beef.  Follow Paula's  instructions on when to add the vegetables and how long to cook the stew to the "t" - she knows her stuff when it comes to braising a stew!  I have fo

This was the best. I cooked it in my cast iron pot and browned the meat after dredging in flour with added seasonings from the recipe. then followed the rest of the recipe as is except I used low sodium beef broth. I made it for a sick friend and he raved about it. Thank you so much for sharing a really good beef stew recipe.

I made a few changes.  Used top sirlloin 1/2 inch cubes.  Drenched the sirloin cubes in flour then added to the stew pot.  Used 32 oz beef broth instead of boullion cubes.  The flour thickened the beef broth nicely. Let the stew simmer on medium heat for 1 hour with the veggies and meat.  Everything turned out tender and savory.  Will definitely make this again!

I made it last night for my husband, son, and me.  I am not the chef of the family and hubby is a great cook but due to an error putting the wrong package to thaw and my hubby being aggravated with me, I went in search for a recipe to use.  I found the perfect one.  It was a big hit and now hubby's trying to put me back in the kitchen. Only thing my son would have liked to see was whole kernel corn and more liquid added.  I will be doing that next time.  Loved how tender the meat and vegs were!  Thank you!

This turned out fabulous!  I did make a few small changes.  I added the meat to some seasoned  flour and seared the meat first.  I also added I cup of red wine and some garlic.  I didn't need to add the cornstarch because the flour thickened the sauce perfectly.  Will definitely be using this recipe when I make beef stew.  My family loved it!

I used top sirloin as stew meat is too fatty.  I used beef broth instead of water and left out the bouillon.  I did not have rosemary so I skipped that.  Put the cubes of meat in bag with flour and shook to coat.  Added mushrooms and worshestire, slated as I went but def had to add salt.  Also, kept adding cornstarch in cold water until I reached the desired consistency.  After I browned the meat, I put all inged in the oven on 300 and let it bake for 2 hours as I did not have time to watch it.  Also, it you use red pot they will not get mushy.

Great, hearty recipe and easy to make. I added the following, once the vegetables were in: 
1/4 cup red wine, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, 1-1/2 teaspoons savory, 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1 teaspoon salt, additional 1 teaspoon parsley, additional 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1 Tablespoon flour for thickening

This was my 1st go at beef stew. It turned out delicious!
I followed a few reviewer suggestions and added a bit of ketchup and steak sauce, but don’t think it added any real flavor to the end result.

I used beef stock and red wine instead of boulion. I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper going this route. I also tripled the cornstarch slurry. (Tablespoons instead of teaspoons)

The only thing I would do different next time is browning meat in a skillet in batches then deglazing with wine or broth and adding to the pot.
I used a black angus chuck roast that I cubed. It would have been better if I had rendered more fat while browning.

This recipe is definitely a keeper!

The only changes I made was using 2 cups of water and 2 cups of V8 juice (instead of 4 cups water).  I also added some diced garlic.  This turned out better than my usual crockpot recipe!  The stew meat was super tender and my family loved it.  I will make this again!

My family said this was the best stew I ever made.  (I did dredge the meat in flour, garlic powder and onion powder before browning and added 1 tablespoon each of Worcestershire and ketchup as other reviewers recommended. ) It didn't require as long a cooking time as the recipe states, but that could be due to the cut of beef used~I used chuck.

Fantastic stew! Used the alterations! 1/4 c. flour, 1/2 tsp. pepper, 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder  in a bag to shake the stew meat in before browning in pot. And you must add 1 tbs. ketchup, 1 tbs. A-1 sauce, and 1 tbs. worcestershire to the stew! It definitely added more flavor. You can add more veggies depending on your liking.

My boyfriend loved this so much! I followed the recipe exactly, but it wasn’t thickening so I did have to add extra cornstarch. Probably about another 3-4 tsps. It didn’t affect the flavor. I also added peas. So glad to find a recipe this easy for stew!

I can't find celery here in India so I left the celery out as well as parsley.  I used 1 cup red wine and 3 cups beef broth.  I also added a tablespoon of smokey paprika, 4 cloves fresh garlic (minced) and had only tapioca flour to thicken.  It was marvelous!

Delicious!
This stew was fantastic, very hearty and perfect for those cold winter nights when all you want is something to warm you up! I did make a few modifications, I followed a previous reviewer's recommendations. I threw the cubed beef into a giant zip lock with some flour, onion powder, garlic powder and pepper. I cooked it up and left the brown bits in my pot. They dissolve throughout the cooking. I also used 6 beef bouillons instead of 4 and I also used more of the veggies and used red potatoes instead. I just threw them in whole and they turned out perfectly! No mushiness at all. I did end up having to add another half cup of water. After 2 hours it was ready and boy was it divine! Will definitely be making it again!

Great basic recipe! Instead of water/bouillon cubes I used a can of beer and at the end about 1/2 cup of red wine. No need for cornstarch - it made a yummy gravy. Delicious! Hubby was very happy!!!

we really liked this. only thing I did different from the recipe was to use beef broth in place of the beef bouillon and water, and I used 6 tablespoons of corn starch to thicken it more as I served it in a bread bowl, and I wanted it think. my husband said it for better when we ate the leftovers. will definitely make again!

Made this recipe almost exactly as written. I did season meat with a garlic/salt/pepper/parsley blend from local butcher. Other than that I followed recipe exactly.  I loved it. Very flavorful stew. I did use Penzey's bouillon paste vs cubes which also gives a lot of flavor. Will be making again!

I made this recipe exactly as listed and it is quite bland in my opinion.  I will follow some of the other people's comments and try coating with seasoned flower and precooking the meat this way as well as adding the wine.  I think that would do wonders for it.

This got a big thumbs up from my husband, and I liked it, too.

I followed the recipe as written, with one change.  By the time I added the veggies, almost all the liquid had cooked off.  To avoid burning, and to make sure the veggies cooked, I added enough chicken broth to just cover the vegetables.  Enough of that cooked off to leave us with a thick, delicious stew with little bit of broth.

This is a great recipe. Made a cpl minor changes, just my little tweaks. Let me say this, I'm a stickler for good hearty stew and this fits the bill perfectly! One thing I did though,  is use some instant potatoes to quicken the thickening process

I doubled the herbs and added all of the extra flavors others suggested - ketchup, steak sauce, Worcestershire sauce, red wine.  Deglazed the pan.  Didn't matter.  Not much flavor.  Eight people for dinner and all agreed it was pretty bland.  

This stew was pretty labor intensive.  I've tried it twice.  Never again!

My dad said, " I think you have finally learned to make beef stew."  ??Yay. I didn't even have rosemary to help me. I did flour my beef with almond flour, salt, pepper and garlic before browning. I only had 2 bullion cubes so I used beef broth. thank you so much. My husband loved it and he has never liked my stew. ??

I did make a few changes based on other reviews. I put the stew meat in a bag and tossed it in flour, black pepper, garlic powder, and season salt (that was my own throw in); before browning it. I also didn't use and parsley, but that was purely because I strongly dislike it. I only used two (2) bullion cubes because of the size of the ones I have. Then I subbed 1 cup of the water with 1/4 red wine, 3/4 cup extra beef broth. Then at the end I found that it was ultimately in need of a little more flavoring, so I added some more garlic powder, season salt, and 21 seasoning salut from Trader Joe's (all measured to taste). Like everyone else mentioned, it's overall a good recipe but most people have preferred to make a few alterations based on their tastebuds.

I've made variations of this recipe for years and improvise around the basic ingredients. Just made it with organic AAA beef cubes, trimmed and cut in half, and 6 trimmed lamb chops -- all were reduced for quick sale; fresh rosemary, bay leaf, ground coriander seeds, and parsley all from the front garden, and aromatic organic oregano from Mt. Athos in Greece; organic veggies -- baby potatoes, one small onion, carrots , leeks, and celery; added a few rough chopped cloves of fresh garlic and a few squirts of Petti 'doppio' tomato paste (from the tube). A few 'glugs' of Chilean red wine for good measure too.

You can't go wrong. Someone in the house will probably want me to add curry powder, but I'll  talk them into doing that with the leftover batch :-) A nice bottle of C.C. Jentsch "The Chase" red wine (Okanagan, BC) and dinner is slow cooking and ready in a few hours :-)

I've been using this recipe for a couple years now and it's always great. Instead of fixing it up in a couple hours, I use my slow cooker. I use almost all the ingredients, plus extra cornstarch as noted by other users, and cook it on low for 8 hours. The family loves it and I love the slow cooker option. Thanks!

I added flour, onion and garlic to the meat before browning,  used 1/3 of a cup of apple cider vinegar to deglaze the pan, and also added Worcestershire sauce and some BBQ sauce to the liquids at the final stage.  Without those additions it would have been too bland, but was great with those changes.

Okay,  real talk: this recipe is amazing.  I've lurked on AllRecipes for years but never reviewed until now,  it's that good.   The meat is incredibly tender and the veggies still have a little snap to them,  rather than being mushy and without any distinct flavor (like they can get to be in other stews). This will be a go-to for the rest of my life. 

I hate to be that person, but I DID make a few additions. However,  I don't think they're necessary (just bonuses!). First, I cut up and browned 6 slices of bacon and set aside in a bowl for later--I didn't have any oil so I had to improvise!  While I did that,  I let the beef come to room temp then tossed it in a bag with 1/4 cup flour, about a teaspoon of garlic powder, and a little white pepper.  I then browned the meat in the bacon grease before adding liquids.  I simmered uncovered for the first hour because I missed that in the directions (oops!).  And I did use beef broth because it was all I had!  After I added the veggies,  I put a little bit of Worcestershire sauce in, too (because why not?). 

The result: fall-apart meat that I only thought was possible in the slow-cooker, perfectly cooked veggies,  and a thick,  flavorful gravy.  You could follow the directions to a T or add/ remove/ substitute ingredients and I guarantee you'll come out with an awesome stew!

I made this tonight for dinner. Yum! I added peas & corn, as we like lots of Vegis. Served with dinner rolls from Thanksgiving. Very tasty!

This is my go to recipe! It is so good on a chilly day. I do save myself some time and use a McCormick's Beef Stew packet, but other than that...so great as written!

Very easy to make.  Tasted great. I substituted one cup of water with red wine. I also used oxtail beef instead of cubed beef, and I added two cloves of garlic.

I made all the changes that Chuck sent in his review years ago. He was spot on about the veges and liquids.  It was the best I have ever had or made.  I did add more broth in the middle to the end as there was clearly not enough liquid and then added more ketchup, A-1, Worshishire and more red wine  after adding more broth.  Also added more cornstarch to thicken to what we wanted.  Use the changes from his review.  
Make it be your own. You will not be sorry.

Excellent recipe!  Doubled the water to four cups because it cooked down so much and used more cornstarch for thickening.   Added two extra boullion cubes and it was amazing!  Easy recipe!

I followed this recipe to the letter and I have to say, this was THE BEST beef stew I’ve ever had.  The meat was so juicy and tender, the gravy had excellent flavor, and the veggies were the perfect texture. I topped it off with simple dumplings from the Bisquick box, and it was a hit! My fiancée, our kids, and our guests all raved about how good this stew was. Definitely a keeper!!

Perfect for our already single digit temps here in MN; so I made it and it was absolutely fantastic!  I  am not sure if it was something that I did wrong, but I did have to add a bit more cornstarch to thicken it up and I added some garlic as well.  Rich and savory, guaranteed empty bowls, and a happy family.

I followed the advice from the first commenter, Chuck Sampson, minus the A1 sauce which we didn't have on hand. Very happy with the results! I Did a total cook time of about 2.5 hours, then turned off the heat about 45 minutes before supper, so it was hot but not scalding when we were ready to eat.

I made a few minor changes to suit my families personal tastes, and thickened the gravy just a little as we were serving it over potatoes. It was lovely and very filling.

I use Bisto to thicken the gravy and instead of cutting up the carrots and celery I use a bag of mixed vegetables. Other than that I follow this recipe and it is delicious

Excellent!  I did not have any celery, so I left that out.  My daughter who claims to not like meat LOVED this stew and had three helpings.  Other than the minor omission, I made it exactly as written and it was wonderful.  I am making it again for Sunday dinner and will experiment with tripling the recipe.

This stew recipe was exceptional.  My family raved about it. I used a little balsamic to get browned bits from bottom of pot and used fingerling potatos .  The only change I made was 2 cups of bouillon with two cups of beef bone broth.

Floured the cubes and fried in butter until brown, followed the rest of the directions except added some red wine, ketchup, A1 and Worcestershire sauce.  Was still missing some seasoning, wasn't as rich and savory as I hoped.  Will play with the recipe and add additional seasonings.

I used corn starch for the thickener and shook it with a teaspoon each of onion and garlic powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper like was suggested by another reviewer.  The flavor was great and my family loved it.

Best beef stew I have ever made! I also changed it up some. I seared the beef in cast iron first with the spices and then added the bouillon cubes and brought it to a boil. Also, little less onion. Added all the ingredients to my pressure cooker and cooked for 1 hr.

I followed all of the suggestion of Chuck Sampson's feedback down to the biscuits - I even went an extra step by not just adding wine to the stew but served with my meal ;) Smells phenomenal as it's being cooked up and tastes equally amazing!!!!

I did make a few changes. I was out of parsley, so I used thyme instead. I increased the black pepper to 1 tsp. and added 1 tsp. of garlic powder.  I will make this again, it turned out very tasty.

This will be my primary Beef Stew recipe.  It's really good!  I've taken tips from others and made the following revisions:  I tossed the cubed stew meat in a gallon size freezer bag with 1/4 cup wheat flour, a teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder and a 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.  I used a large cast iron Dutch oven for browning the meat and then added everything else to the same pot once the meat was ready.  I added additional carrots, onions, celery, fresh parsley and used small red potatoes cut in half (not peeled).  I added 1 tbsp Stubb's Original BBQ Sauce, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 cup red wine and I used Better than Bouillon paste instead of cubes.  I also doubled the amount of cornstarch.  Easy to make and with using just the Dutch oven, cleanup is quick.  Of course, it gets even more flavorful the next day.  So good.

Great recipe!  I used 2 cans of beef broth and reduced the salt.  We prefer more veggies and less meat.  The recipe was halved.  Used only 1/2 lb of meat and cut it into small spoon size pieces.  As the others suggested, salt, pepper and 1 tblsp of flour was sprinkled on the meat before browning in the pot with 2 tsp veg oil.  1 and 1/2 cans Beef broth was added.  The remaining broth was added to 2 tblsp each of flour and cornstarch, 1/4 tsp of salt, pepper, parsley and a dash/pinch of garlic powder and rosemary.  Sweet onion was used and 1 cup of peas was added 10 mins before adding the seasoned broth.  It thickened right away.  My Son said it was pretty as a picture.  It tasted great.  I might try adding mushrooms next time.

I added 1tbs each of Worcester sauce, A1 and ketchup as suggested by another reviewer plus some garlic powder.  I used beef broth instead of boullion cubes so needed to add the extra flavor—I didn’t have any boullion cubes on hand.  Great recipe!

It was absolutely delicious.  I did use 14oz. of beef broth and 2 cups of water, instead of the bouillon and water. I do not like bouillon. Other then that I just followed the directions.  Can't wait until I make it again!

I know there are many ways to prepare stews like this but I love how this one does not require the use of more than 1 pot. 

I used an Angus Chuck Roast. Replaced 1 cup of water with red wine. Turned out delicious!! The chuck roast is always good for a soft and tender meat.

Wow! I made this recipe exactly as written. I doubled the recipe since my stew meat comes in 4 lb packages from the butcher. It was my intention to freeze it for the cold months ahead but it was so delicious and the week was cold and rainy. Needless to say I am making another batch this week which will hopefully make it to the freezer.

This stew was rated a 5 by my family. They enjoyed the hearty stew and requested peas be added next time. Nice and easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is my new "go to" stew recipe. I did make the following adjustments:
I added 2 Tbsp of flour, 1 Tbsp of paprika, and 1 Tbsp dry mustard into a large ziplock bag and coated the meat pieces completely prior to browing in my cast iron pot.
I added about 1/3 cup of worchestershire, and used the organic beef stock (purchased from Costco).
The one mistake I did make was that I added seasoning salt and a bit of brown gravy mix (to thicken the broth), and it made it more salty than I would have wanted. Otherwise, it was great.
Served with cheese biscuits, and voila - supper was served!

This was DELICIOUS!! I did added a couple of ingredients: I made a tomato sauce (peeled some tomatoes and stirred it with some garlic, then boiled it, and done!) and sprinkle a bit of cinnamon (just a bit!). The combination of rosemary and cinnamon is...how can I put this EXQUISITE! My family loved it :)

Great recipe, I did however make some changes that others had suggested.  Put meat in flour and spice mixture and fried with oil, then deglazed with a little wine and added beef broth. Also added 1T ketchup, A-1 Sauce and Worcestershire. I didn't have any need to add the cornstarch and water as the flour mixture made it plenty thick in the end for us. Yum!

I used beef stock and half a beef bouillon cube instead of the water and a whole cube. I also left the meat marinating in cilantro, parsley, basil, salt, thyme, adobo, garlic, onion and red wine for a day before cooking. It sounds like a lot but I think it really helped to give the entire dish some more flavor. especially since beef stock can be a bit bland in my opinion.

This is my go-to beef stew recipe.  I use unsalted beef stock since we are watching our sodium levels but that is really the only change I make.

Delicious! The only reason why this didn’t get a 5 star rating is because if I would have waited the time stated after adding my vegetables then they would’ve all been mushy if not disintegrated. I definitely think that it didn’t need to be cooking for so long unless of course you have large cuts of vegetables. This is a keeper!!!

This was my first time ever making beef stew. I am very happy with the way it turned out. I did a few things differently though. Instead of just putting the beef in the crockpot ( if you use a slow cooker for about 6 hours it's so much better. The meat is softer too) 

I did 2 pounds beef stew meat put one pound at a time in a freezer bag with 1 cup flower, 2 teaspoons garlic powder, 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1 teaspoon dried parsley, 1 teaspoon and 1 teaspoon dried oregano. I shook it all together and pressed the flour into the meat. I then put enough oil in a pan to cook the flour into the meat. Doing it this way made the stew a little thicker. The last 20 minutes, I added 2 teaspoons of corn starch and 2 teaspoons water and mixed together in a bowl. I waited 10 minutes the stew still seemed a little too watery. I took a measuring cup and scooped out a bit of the "broth" from the crock pot and mixed together 1 more teaspoon of corn starch and 1 teaspoon of water. I mixed it together again and poured it into the measuring cup that had the beef stew broth to see if it made it too thick. It didn't! So I poured the measuring cup with the corn starch already mixed into it, into my crockpot and it was perfect. If you're looking for beef stew that's a little thicker than what you get following this receipe - try what I did. I was very happy with the way it all turned out.

This is my favorite beef stew.  I use better than bullion instead of cubes and make the broth a little richer. I also use extra liquid so I can add barley. I've started using more rosemary in beef recipes because of this one.

Loved it. Made half of  the recipe. Had only 1 pound of eye of round and did have a pound of beef marrow bones. It was plenty for 2 and had a wonderful gravy.

Very good and simple stew.  My family loved it and I'll certainly make it again.  I used venison instead of beef.

I really liked this, despite not being a stew fan.  It needed a pinch more salt and pepper, plus a slosh of red wine.  It freezes and reheats well.

I made this tonight and it was wonderful.  I did make a few changes based on what other people said.  I used 1/4 cup flour mixed with 1 tsp. garlic powder, 1 tsp. onion powder and 1/2 tsp black pepper and shook the beef in a ziplock bag, then browned the beef.  I then removed the beef from my dutch oven and deglazed the pot with 1/2 cup of red wine, then added the stock & beef cubes and followed the rest of the recipe as stated.  Oh, and I did use about double the cornstarch/water mixture because I like a thicker stew.

Wow. This is amazing. I made a pot of this stew expecting left overs but with my whole family having two helpings (including my 7 year old and 5 year old) I had nothing left. And because of insistent requests made it again 3 days later. The only thing I changed was instead of water I used beef broth

I make this regularly. I add a little wine and use 2T of cornstarch to thicken it up. I also replace the onion and celery with frozen corn and peas since we have some picky eaters in my family.

My changes were.  Added himalayan salt.  I used 2.5 # beef roast and cut it up myself, so  I used an extra carrot and 2 extra potatoes.  I would add garlic next time.

Added a little extra flavouring but it was excellent - easy to make in the instant pot as well which is an extra bonus in my house.

First time making a traditional stew, turned out really tender. I added a cup of red Shiraz wine to the stock, and cut out one of the beef bullion cubes, and added more rosemary and pepper, and some leek. I also dredged the beef cubes in flour before browning, although I didn't find it did too much for me (still added 3 tsp corn starch). 

Cooked over 2-3 hours and was very tender and soft and didn't have that "thick beef " taste.  Wish I had more carrots on had, would have added a wonderful sweetness! Pretty impressed with such a simple recipe!

I have made this recipe 3 -4 Times now an we like it more every time.  My only change has been to save the last spoonful of peas from diners during the month and store them in the freezer.   10 minutes before the end of the stew cooking time I toss them in.  Adds flavor and color both!

I thought this recipe was great. I did make it in the slow cooker for the eight hours. I just threw in all the Raw food. I did not brown the meat beforehand. I first added the meat, then I just piled everything else on top of the meat. I did put the two teaspoons of water in a measuring cup along with two teaspoons of flour. I did mix it together and added it to the slow cooker. And then to top it all off, I added a box of penne pasta. I mixed everything all together.  After about 6 hours, I had to add 2 cans of beef broth to cover the beef and vegetables again.  It came out just awesome.  I would make this again but would try it on the stove top.

This was a big hit in my house last night. The meat was so tender and the stew had plenty of flavor. 4 cups of water was not enough, so I had to add 2 cups after the first hour of cooking. I also had to add a little more corn starch to thicken it the way I like it. I will make this dish again!

This stew was amazing. I substituted the bouillon cubes for beef Bovril cause that's what I had in the cupboard and added cubes rutabega and it was a hit with the entire family. Will be making it again.

It’s nice to only use household ingredients for a stew, without having to buy seasoning packs, etc.  This turned out great, it is now one of my faves as my family gobbled it down and went for seconds.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for the kids. I didn't change much other than using parsnips instead of potatoes, and adding more parsley (fresh) and a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce. Served with corn bread, but a crusty baguette would be great too.

Absolutely loved it. This was my first attempt in cooking a beef stew and I (this recipe) nailed it. It had flavor and richness. A small change I made to the dish was add a lot more corn starch as mentioned in the other comments.

This is my go-to after a long day at work. I add some Worcestershire sauce and rosemary with the broth before simmering the first hour and it definitely improves the richness of the flavor. I prefer thinner broth with my stews so this is a great recipe for me. Even my boyfriend eats it which is an amazing feat in itself.

This recipe earned rave reviews from my husband and friends.  There were a few changes- I put the carrots in about 30 minutes early so they would soften up, and the rest of the veggies about 15 minutes early.  I substituted celery for the onions and added a can of corn.   I also used chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes and water, and tweaked the spices.  I went with 2 teaspoons of oregano, one of rosemary, one of sage, and a few shakes of garlic powder.  We served it over buttered bow tie pasta in bowls, and it was a big hit.

This was easy, and quite tasty!  The only two changes I made:  I used a spring of fresh rosemary (mainly since I didn't have dried, but it tasted wonderful), and after I added the vegetables in, I added a can (2 cups) of beef broth.  The four cups of broth had gotten way too low from the first hour of simmering.  We'll definitely make it again.

Great recipe!  Flavor was amazing. I did decide to make it  in a slow cooker. The vegetables have to go in with anywhere from 2-3 hours left on cook time. I put them in an hour before end cook time and my potatoes and carrots were a bit hard.

Some of the stews in the pictures that were shared had other vegetables added.  I added lima beans. With or without the lima beans, this stew was delicious!

Absolutely delish!  Browned  and floured the meat for about 5 minutes. Also used canned beef broth as well as the bullion cubes.  I par boiled the carrots and celery before adding to the pot with the potatoes and meat.  Kept a close eye while simmering  for the last hour as I did not want my potatoes to fall apart.  Served with corn muffins.  A perfect dinner for the rare freezing temperature.

I made this stew using the suggestions of the other reviewers (browned in cast iron with flour, garlic powder, onion powder and added wine, ketchup, A1, and Worcestershire sauce). I still thought it was sort of bland.. adding salt was necessary and I will add more ketchup and A1 next time.

I didn't have any beef stock so I used Chicken instead. I also added garlic powder after I read that others had added it. I did also add a lot of  cornstarch since i like my stew thicker. I added a little too much pepper but it was still very good with great flavor. I added mushrooms since I needed to use them up, but not till the very end. I used just 1/2 an onion. I put it over noodles. I will def make again and probably add wine in the stock, and will make with beef stock.

I always put the beef cubes in a ziplock bag with a bunch of flour/some salt and black pepper and shake, covering the cubes in a reasonble layer of flour, just so you can't see the red of the meat on any side. Then, I sautee the onions with garlic in butter/oil in the bottom of a pot big enough for all the ingredients plus the broth/wine on medium-high heat. Sautee until the onions are translucent, and pour them into a bowl so you can brown the meat. Add more oil (I use grapeseed oil, as it has a low smoke point and it's actually good for you) and brown as much of the meat as will comfortably fit in the bottom of the pot at a time (you may need to have another bowl to put the first batch of browned meat into temporarily while you brown the second batch). Be sure to just sear the meat on all sides so all sides have been browned a bit, but don't cook any more than that, or the meat will be tough! Remember to add more oil for browning the second batch of meat, as the flour will absorb quite a bit. If you use grapeseed oil, you can be quite liberal with the oil. 

Once the second batch of meat is browned, add back in the first batch to the pot and then add the beef broth (I like to also use some chicken broth with the beef broth for added flavour) and red wine/bay leaves/dried parsley, thyme and toss in the hard vegetables (carrots, potatoes, turnip) and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. I use worchestershire sauce quite liberally: none of this one or two teaspoons nonsense

I just wanted to first start by saying this soup tasted just like my grandma’s, so so delicious!!! I pretty much followed the recipe as it was with a few minor adjustments- I? combined a couple of ideas that I got from the reviewer‘s. First I took the suggestion of one reviewer and I braised the meat and a quarter cup of flour, a dash of garlic powder, a dash of ground pepper and a dash of beef seasoning. That really helped to tenderize the meet and it gave great flavor! I simmered to meat with as suggested but only for about 45 minutes. I added in two handfuls of baby carrots and one deseeded tomato. I cooked/simmered that for about 30-35 minutes I added in the potatoes at the last 30 minutes so they wouldn’t get mushy as mentioned by another reviewer. The base was pretty thick so I added in another 3 cups of water and that helped to thin it out a bit. The outcome was perfection! It was so flavorful, the meat practically melted in your mouth and it really hit the spot. I also served the stew with bread and butter. I will definitely be making this again very soon!! Practically melted in your mouth

Delicious. I added 2 lbs beef, extra beef bovril, garlic powder, 2 bay leaves, extra salt and pepper to taste. I also added a little more corn starch to thicken the gravy a little more.

Good basic recipe but I made some changes.  I used ready made beef broth, used leeks instead of onions (had some that needed to be used), added parsnips and omitted the celery but added celery salt.  I also added some Worcester sauce.  Still needs some tweeting but this a work in progress.

Wonderfully good, to add flavor at the suggestion of other reviewers I added a little red wine after browning the beef and used fresh rosemary instead of dried. Cut celery in half and added mushrooms for personal preference. Used pearl onions and baby potatoes because they looked cute :)

I didn't like the rosemary, and the dried parsley was pointless (I added fresh snipped parsley as the last step).  Previous reviews had helpful comments that made the stew good - also made it a different recipe.  I will find a better recipe.

I don't understand.  The reviews were so good and my meal was just awful.  The only thing that I did differently was to brown the meat in seasoned flour.  Everything else I did from the recipe.  The meat was tender but the gravy was like beef broth.  So thin!  And tasteless.  I added more cornstarch and water then and it got thicker, but now tasted pastey.  My husband ate one serving, I picked at mine and then threw it all away.  Not good.

My husband said this was the best beef stew ever! I made a few changes - instead of bouillon I used consomme and I also used red wine. Skipped the celery. Used flour to thick instead of cornstarch. I also let the meat cook by itself and let it rest overnight before adding the vegetables. It made the meat very flavorful and tender. I grew up hating beef stew, and I absolutely loved this! Also used baby red potatoes so that they would not get mushy (as russets do). Can't recommend this enough!

I tried  it with one package of Dry Onion soup and 2 table spoons of crushed Garlic. The beef was from 3 leftover roasts we had stored in the freezer, so the meat was already cooked. I did coat the beef in flour and  simmer for 5 min. with the garlic  before going into the stew pot...

The next time I will add some Red wine

This was the perfect, hearty, cold night supper.  The stew meat was tender, packed full of vegetables, and great flavour.    From some of the other reviews, I mixed my stew meat with some flour and onion and garlic spices prior to browning. I added a can of tomato paste initially.  After the first hour I added extra vegetables a long with some frozen peas and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce.  Served with fresh buns, it hit the spot!  

Thank you for this delicious recipe, I’ll certainly be making it again!

Great stew!! Delicious!  I'm not a fan of rosemary so I cut that in half. I also didn't have enough bouillon so cut that in half and used a can of beer as well!

I loved this beef stew recipe with the modifications of shaking the beef in flour & garlic before searing and adding Worcestershire and ketchup to the stew.  Even my picky son loved it.

My review combines a few techniques from other reviewers and I have to say that this was the best stew I've ever tasted.
I put 1/4 cup of flour, 1 tsp garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2 tsp pepper in a bag and shook the beef up before pan frying in oil until I'd seared and browned the beef. I tossed an onion and a couple cloves of minced garlic in toward the end of browning the beef. I added 1/2 a cup of merlot, a container (4 cups) of beef broth, a tablespoon of "better than bullion" beef flavoring, and a tablespoon of each: ketchup, A-1 steak sauce, and worcestershire sauce. (The depth of flavors from these were unexpectedly amazing.) I chopped up fresh rosemary and parsley, added a couple of dried bay leaves and let it simmer. After about 45 minutes, I threw in the carrots, celery, and chopped baby red potatoes. Let it simmer for another hour. Just before it was ready to serve, I cut up and  pan fried a package of baby portobella mushrooms in a tablespoon and a half of butter and poured the whole pan into the stew. The buttery flavor and texture of the mushrooms was incredible. 

I also made the Allrecipe's Chef John's Buttermilk Biscuits with this recipe and dinner.

I followed the advice of those who went before me, and this was the best, most savory stew I've ever tasted.

This was FANTASTIC!  I will be throwing away all of my other stew recipes and replacing it with just this!  During the 2nd simmer, after adding the potatoes and carrots, the liquid reduced to pretty much nothing.  I did have to add another cup of water,  but it instantly made a delicious gravy-like liquid, so no extra bouillon or flavoring was needed.  For spices, I only had fresh rosemary and dried thyme.  It was SO good!  A little parsley at the end would have added a nice touch to brighten up the rather  brown color to this stew, but for flavor, nothing else was needed.

Super tender and flavorful. My only problem was that is was a little too thin, even after a doubling the cornstarch and cooking it with the lid off for the last 20 minutes. But my husband practically licked the bowl clean, so I guess it's still a win!

This turned out great!  It was fast and easy and I will definitely be making it again.  I don't use my dutch over much and may have had the heat a little too high as the veggies cooked surprisingly fast and the liquid evaporated a lot.   

To remedy, I doubled the cooking liquid (additional 4 cups water  & 4 bullion cubes), threw in a little more spices to compensate for the extra liquid and pulled the pot off the heat a little early.  Of course more corn starch was needed with the extra liquid, too.  It turned out awesome!  Lots of rich gravy , tender meat and a good ratio of veggies.  

Only other mods: I put a little salt, pepper, and flour on the meat before browning.  I also added some powdered garlic to the pot and added frozen peas after I removed the pot from the heat .  Thanks for a great recipe!

The stew was a watery bland soup. I added lots of seasoning, and at least 7 teaspoons of cornstarch, then flour, and STILL WATERY-BLAND SOUP.I don't know why this recipe works for some but not all.

It was just very boring and not worth the effort, even with some of the suggestions that other viewers made.  Also, the potatoes and vegetables take longer to cook than the time allotted in the recipe.

Made just a few substitutions, but otherwise loved it! The first time, going exactly by the recipe, it was quite dry (in my opinion) and had a bit of a gravy-like texture and if thats the point, then whoopsies cause it wasn’t what I was expecting ahaha. The second, I realized wanted more of a soup/stew rather than regular stew texture, so made sure to really dissolve the bouillon (break 2 cubes instead of 4 into tiny pieces with a fork and then let set in 2 cups of water for around 3-4 hours, stirring occasionally). I also used a full box of Progresso’s beef flavored broth (32 oz [?]) along with the 2 cups of water and bouillon. Ended up with the second time, the boyfriend and I ate half while the roommates ate the other half a few hours later and their beef cubes were even more tender than ours (obviously cause it sat in the broth n such) but I’ll have to figure out how to get the beef cubes to sit in the broth stew mix without running down the flavor for next time...

This is stew is great with just a few adjustments.  First off,  no self respecting stew would leave out mushrooms.  I carmelize  the onions, together with mushrooms, by heating them on medium high with about a 1/4 cup of sugar and some salt to bring out the liquid to carmelize (about 45 minutes stirring frequently).  Simple flavors, but deeply set by carmelizing and simmering is the best!

The last piece of the puzzle is...add about a cup or so of red wine.  Deepens the flavor!

When done I removed the mushroom and onions and set them aside .  Then I browned the beef with about 3-4 cloves of garlic.  After browning I simmered the beef per the directions, but added thencarmelized onions nd mushrooms 30 minutes into the simmering process.  The carmelized onion/mushroom mix is what brings out the flavor and makes the dish.  

I followed the directions for adding the potatoes, celery, and carrots, but I don’t use cornstarch for thickening.  The only way to go is to make a roux:  1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup of olive oil (or any oil/fat).  Cook until a blonde or caramel color in the mixture.  Add to the pot for thickening.  It came out great.  Good luck!

This was good but in my opinion way too salty. I think the beef bouillon cubes were too overpowering. Next time will make with canned beef broth or something with less sodium. It was very tasty and I will try it again.

Delicious!  Tastes like it cooked all day long!  I made a few changes - I dredged the stew beef in flour seasoned with salt & pepper before browning.   Rather than using the corn starch,  I simply used the left-over flour as a thickening agent.  Also used "Better than Bouillon" in lieu of just bouillon cubes.  Everything else, was the same.  Thanks for an easy recipe that tastes like my mother's.  Very flavorful!

The family loved it.  I seasoned the meat with salt, peer and garlic powder before rowing.  Instead of putting potatoes in the pot, I served the stew in a bed of mash potatoes.  I changed out a 3/4 cup of water with 3/4 cup of good red wine.

I pretty much made it as the recipe prescribes, substituting beef broth for bullion, miniature red and gold potatoes for large potatoes, baby carrots for normal sized carrots and red onion for the large onion.  It really wasn't bad for my first time making it!  I didn't use rosemary but in spite of this, my husband was pleased--- and that's one of the only people that matter anyway.  I will definitely make this again, using rosemary.  That may make the difference...

I added a parsnip to this which I liked but my husband didn't care for but that's personal taste I also substituted 1 cup of sherry for a cup of water and used 1 less boullion cube but did not add any salt. I took the advice of others and added more corn starch but also increased the water proportionally and still could not get it thick. Next time I'll use more corn starch but less water. I also used an herb de Provence seasoned olive oil to brown the stew beef which I think made it more savory. I really like the recipe and will make it again with more cornstarch.

Will definitely be making this again! Delicious! I read the reviews and someone suggested tossing the meat in a mixture of 1/4 cup of flour, 1 tsp of onion powder, 1 tsp of garlic powder, and some ground black pepper and then browning it. This added amazing flavour! Next time, I plan to also put some salt into that mixture. I used oregano instead of rosemary just because that was what I had, and used 2 1/2 big cubes of Knorr Beef Stock for 4 cups of water. Another thing I found, is I had to let the stew boil/simmer gently once I added the veggies in before lowering the heat, because after I let it cook for an hour on low the veggies were still raw.

I highly recommend this dish! If you want to get extra yummies, make the No Knead Dutch Oven Bread to dip into the stew as you eat! Super delicious!!

I loved this recipe I made some changes to it. I browned my meat in floor first. Then I added some other spices I used pure beef broth no bouillon. Used 1 white onion and 1 yellow. I also used a roast that I cut into 1” slabs then cubed vs standard stew meat. Came out amazing.

My hubby made this yesterday.  He followed the recipe but made some minor changes.  He tripled the amount of cornstarch and added a can of drained green beans.  It was fantastic, and leftovers the next day are even better.

I added a packet of gravy mix into the stew the last 10 minutes of simmering, besides that followed the recipe as written and it was delicious and easy. My father said this needs to be on the dinner table more often, so I will be making again.

OMG the only thing I changed was I added about 8 ounces of Merlot and a little extra water.  I didn't have rosemary so I add some spinach and herb from tastefully simple and parsley!!  And I don't get stew meat - I got a chuck roast and cut it up.

Hello,
Best take away from the recipe for me was the reminder to add the root veggies after the first hour.  Simple method reminder that keeps things firm and looking nice at meal time.  Easy enough to thin, thicken, or spice up to taste.

This stew is excellent and super easy! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.   To save time prepare the veggies while the meat is simmering in broth for the 1st hour.  Good rainy day food!

I make beef stew often. My only difference with this recipe, as another review is coat beef cubes with flour. Very easy, just shake them in a plastic bag with about a 1/2 cup of flour. I brown on high in the dutch oven. I often add mushrooms, also brown very well. Then proceed as the recipe states. The cornstarch is hardly ever needed. The flour coating should do the thickening for you. Comfort food indeed !

Taste was AMAZING before I put the cornstarch in...just not to my liking.  Will definitely make this again without the cornstarch!  I like the soup version more than the stew version.  The cornstarch removed a lot of the flavor that was amazing!!  Also, I need to remember to cut the potatoes a bit larger and the celery smaller.   I thought the one inch cut meant the celery was only in their for flavor and not meant to be eaten, but the flavor of the celery was AMAZING but I wished that it was in smaller pieces so it would have been easier to eat.  Also the potatoes had a wonderful flavor as well, but needed to have more of them for my taste.

This was VERY delicious. Will definitely make it again. I added broccoli and an orange bell pepper. It turned out being more like 6 or 7 servings, it was not 10 servings for us as the recipe states but maybe our serving sizes are a bit over the norm.

I think this is a good basic beef stew recipe. However, I added quite a bit more beef boullion than was called for. I also added garlic, thyme, and another spice blend to get the flavor where I’d like it. So if you want something really flavorful, you can start here but you’ll need to add more. Also I added about 6-8x the corn starch to get it somewhat tho

Delicious! I followed the recipe, but uses 1 cup of red wine and an extra teaspoon of corn starch because it looked too runny. Family loved it. A keeper!

Delicious!  My family loved it and I also brought some to a friend who had just had a baby and her family loved it as well.

I followed the suggestions of the main positive commenter and loved how it turned out.  Just didn't have garlic powder, so I used minced garlic instead and it was great.

Will definitely be making this again!

I made this exactly as the respire called, except added some garlic, it was amazing.  My husband asked me why I haven't been making it all along.  The meat was very tender as well.

I am not a chef. I have about 4 meals I can cook. I was never taught to cook. That being said, I tried to make this and I did it! It's easy and so good!  Anyone that can turn on a stove can do it.  And it taste like grandma made it. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's fantastic!

It turned out so incredibly well. The only issues I had with it were all mistakes I made not necessarily the recipe itself. Take the time to seer the meat correctly otherwise you will end up with dry pieces. You would think because it's in liquid it will be moist. Incorrect. A few pieces were too big after I seered them so I cut them in half and forgot to seer the cut side. Believe it or not I could tell which pieces I cut in half. I used a lot more cornstarch than what it calls for but I prefer thick sauce so when I pour it over my biscuits it doesn't soak in as quickly.

I made a few changes. Added garlic powder, onion powder and savoury to flour and tossed the beef in that and then browned it. I slow cooked everything for about 5 hours. I also added worstershire. Oh and used flour instead of cornstarch to thicken. It was really delicious.

Flavor was really good. I agree with others about the celery... it added a flavor that wasn't necessary and did not compliment the dish.  Unfortunately I was unable to add potatoes to my stew due to dietary restrictions but still felt it turned out really well. I also added green beans to make up for the lack of potatoes. 

When I make again I will not add celery but will add garlic.

I did use lamb and the stew was great. Nice and thick gravy and super easy. My purple potatoes I would skip next time as it was ugly.

Hands down the best stew I have ever had, I have made this at least a dozen times,I did change the potatos to only 2 medium sized, this recipe is very filling, I thought 3 large was to much, and I put in 7 large carrots and 2 large onions. Little tip for you, sear that beef before adding it in and let it simmer for an extra half hour, world of difference!!!

Easy peasy recipe.  The  change I made was substituting organic beef stock for the bullion cubes and water. My husband LOOOOVES it and has "demanded" it be on the weekly menu.

It was decent, but I should have made it thicker. Note that I did add 1 cup of water after adding the veggies, as there was not enough liquid to cover them. I should probably add more cornstarch, and possibly additional garlic powder and/or stewed tomatoes. I did add 1/2 cup red wine, 1/2 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce, and coated the meat with flour and seasoning before browning, per other suggestions.

Great recipe! This was moist and tender, not a lot of excess juice like with other stews. I prefer a stew vs. a soup and this was a true stew.  I served with a  sourdough bread and there were no leftovers.

This recipe was hella easy and nothing shy of amazing. I only served 4 people so we cut the recipe in half; it was all eaten in 15 minutes. The only change we made was that we added chopped garlic and garlic powder (my family has a weird obsession with garlic). I tried it by sticking to the recipe as well for a work pot luck and everyone is begging me to make it again. I wish I could give it 10 stars because this dish is A-1.

Great recipe.  The only thing I did different was use beef stock instead of the bouillon and water.  Family loved it and it disappeared fast.  Was good in bread bowls.

This was superb!  Only changes was to add some other vegies I had on hand and more thickening.
This was far superior to slow cooker recipes that all seem to turn out, well, over cooked.
Loved by one and all.

Prepared via Instant Pot on stew setting.  However, I subbed in leftover Prime Rib i cooked on the Traeger, so I had an incredibly tender and flavorful beef base.

Great recipe. The meat comes out perfectly tender! I did tweak it a bit, I never use water as a base so I used beef stock, left out the rosemary & cornstarch with cold water. Just used flour as a thickening agent instead. I don't like it very thick so I didn't need a lot. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! Husband and kids liked it so much I had to make another batch. I read other reviews so I added some flour, garlic powder, and pepper into a ziplock bag and coated the meat first before browning it in my cast iron skillet. I also added some red wine, ketchup, and A1 during the deglazing step. I used red potatoes instead of russet and added some extra water when adding the veggies.

I love a good stew on cold winter nights.  I started making this in my crockpot, but as I got prepping I realized I didn't have boullion on hand, so I tossed the beef in Montreal Steak Spice rub before throwing it in the pot, and added a tablespoon or so of worchestershire sauce for flavour.  It turned out great  and it didn't last the weekend.

Made this stew over the weekend and it turned out very good!
Because there is only two of us and my husband does not like vegetables, so I cut down on the carrots. 
That's the only change I made.
Even he liked it, wonders never stop I guess. He told me to keep the recipe and make it again.
Thanks for the recipe.

We really enjoyed this recipe, but I did make a few changes. I used about 1/2 a cup of red wine to deglaze the pan. I added a bay leaf to the seasoning, and used much more corn starch to thicken my stew. I also waited until the last 20 minutes to add my potatoes. Simmering them for an hour is way too long ... they would break down into the broth and just create a starchy gravy, with little to no chunks of potato. Mine came out just right at 20 minutes.

I also did the flour dredge. After cooking the meat we Carmelized  the onions with the meat.  We cooked the stew for 3 hours to get the veggies and meat tender. This is our second time making this and yes will make it again.

Great stew with a yummy flavor. We will definitely be making this again. I halved the recipe and ended up needing an additional cup of beef broth the last half hour or so of cooking so keep liquid in the pan.

DO NOT ADD ANY SALT. You may feel it will need salt as the recipe doesn't call for it but DONT DO IT! if you do, you need to dilute it with a little sugar and cider vinegar. Learned this the hard way but luckily was able to recover it to perfection by adding little sugar and cider vinegar. You will want more stew so add one more cup of water half way through and half cup of WHITE WINE if you have it. Rosemary makes this great, I added another 1tsp of rosemary half way through.. Definitely add MINIMUM 8-10tsp corn starch to 13-15tsp of cold water. Add even more if you want it noticeably thick but the 10tsp won't make it too thick. Following recipe otherwise makes this perfect. The lost star is because 1tsp of cornstarch will make this more of a soup than a stew which could of ruined it!

Followed the recipe precisely - the end result was more of a beef and vegetable broth soup. I had to add an additional 1/2 cup of cornstarch-&-water agent to thicken the gravy, double the herbs and serve it with garlic bread to make it a substantial meal. I agree with the other reviewers - modifications need to be made to make this a 5-star recipe. But then again, next time  I will probably just invest the time into making a proper beef bourguignon à la Julia Child.

Tried it with yellow yukon potatoes and they were too mushy and then almost fully disolved when I had some for leftovers. Used red roasting potatoes the second time and cut them into 2 inch pieces and it was perfect. Also used more cornstarch to make a thicker gravy

Delicious and simple. Dredged the meat in flour/salt/pepper first, used 3 cups beef broth and one cup red wine for liquid, and added a tablespoon of tomato paste to make it a little richer in flavor.

Outstanding and simple recipe. I added 4 small cloves of garlic, thinly sliced, for added flavor balance. I also substituted a red onion for a regular cooking onion. This recipe was an instant hit at our house. And it was good to smell it simmering in the Dutch oven all afternoon. Since my wife is allergic to corn products, I used arrowroot instead of cornstarch. This worked fine. You could also use tapioca.

Didn't have beef bouillon so we used chicken bouillon instead. I used 3 Table Spoons of Chicken Bouillon when I cooked the meat down then added enough water for the meat and veggies to float. If you don't need more water don't add any. I then poured in a spiral of Organic Soy Sauce. For the seasonings I recommend sprinkling them evenly across the top of the stew. I changed the seasonings in the recipe slightly ( Crushed Rosemary, Parsley, Ground Cumin, Basil Leaves)  That should do it! I hope you enjoy your stew this was. Just a quick toss up I threw together on the spot.

I had to add a lot of cornstarch to get it to thicken up. It was delicious. Leftovers were good too, aside from a strange texture due to the extra corn starch.

A definite winner! I didn't have cornstarch, but I used flour, and keeping the comments in mind, I used a lot. I also put the beef chunks in a bag with flour, flavored with Penzey's  zata'ar and roasted garlic spices. I added a splash of wine to the liquid with some Worcestershire sauce. I used sweet potatoes because I had some to use up. They really made this a spectacular dish. My husband loved it, and so did I. Had to cut it in half because I only had 1 lb of meat, but will make this for a group next time because it's just that good! Might do dumplings or biscuits with it too!

Make like chuck. 1/4 cup flour, tsp onion powder garlic salt, 1/2 tsp pepper.  Coat meat and cook in french oven high heat to sear flavor in.  1/2 cup red wine, 4 cups beef stock, rosemary and thyme and simmer covered for an hour.  Then carrot, onion, celery, potato plus 2 more cups water. Cooked for 1 hour and wasn't done yet. Add salt and pepper to taste. 
Made with venison very good.

First time making beef stew without a season packet or some other "short cut"way. It was very good. I did make some adjustments ( added more pepper, more beef, little more cornstarch, green beans, corn, peas, and some paprika). It was amazing! my hubby loved it!

Very good.  I don't care for rosemary, so I substituted a bay leaf and some thyme and also added some garlic.

This was a fantastic recipe!!! By far my favorite stew ever!!!!! The meat is so tender. I didn't even cook it as long as it told me to either and it was still very tender.

Really good! I made it a bit thicker by adding more of the water/cornstarch mix. I like more of a gravy type base as opposed to soupy. Ran out of parsley so used rubbed sage instead. That gave the stew a nice old world flavor. The veggies were a bit crisp, which I find nice on the reheat as they will hold up a second and even third time around. This will be my non-crockpot go to stew - most wonderful!

Delicious- WITH CHANGES! Used a little over a pound of high quality beef, and needed less than 3 TBS oil. Subbed 32 oz box of low sodium beef broth and 1/2 cup red wine for bullion and water. Don't like rosemary and omitted it. Sprinkled meat with onion powder, 1 generous tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp pepper. rolled meat in 1/4 c flour to cover well. Browned meat, added parsley brought to boil, covered and simmered an hour. Added about 6 baby potatos quartered, 1/2 chopped onion, 6 carrots and 2 celery chopped. Added 5 tsp cornstarch in equal water. Simmered 40 minutes, added another tsp cornstarch right into the pot and left top off last 10 minutes. Flavor so great, hard not to overeat!

Terrific stew!  Followed recipe exactly except for adding extra cornstarch to thicken up in the end.  Wonderful flavour and I decided to try dumplings for the first time (recipe found on this site) and it was phenomenal! This is the go to stew recipe from now on.

It amazes me how many people will state "I followed the recipe exactly, but..." and then will proceed to list 15 different additions they chose -- EXCUSE ME but that is NOT following the recipe...that's creating your own recipe! Be fair to the original recipe poster (and the rest of us beginner cooks who rely heavily on these ratings) and rate the recipe as it is written so we can tell if it's truly a great recipe or not.  Now on to my review -- this was a pretty simple recipe to follow. I did have to add extra water (which is likely a result of variations in stoves/elevations, etc.) Overall I was happy with the taste and the way it turned out.  I think the next time I make it I will increase the rosemary (just to suit my individual taste) but honestly this is good as written.  I am single and like the fact that it makes enough for me so not have to worry about lunch/dinner for an entire week!!!

Instead of boullion I used a pkg. of beef stew seasoning. Also half wine and some tomato juice. Very yummy. This time I added mushrooms and green beans. Even better!

only changes i made were adding Marsala cooking wine and seasoning that were more to my preferences. Really great standard recipe to build from. My meat did taste a little over cooked probably could have cooked for less time but i should have been tasting along the way to catch that.

I only gave four stars but with reviewer-suggested changes, it's easily worth five stars.  I shook the meat in herbs/flour mixture, then browned, before adding bouillon.  I made this in the pressure cooker, and was able to cut down on the overall cooking time a fair bit.  The family loved it.

Excellent recipe and tastes even better then next day! Only thing I would do next time is double the corn starch so it's thicker, more like a stew.

This was delicious! I added a few more veggies and included portobello mushrooms. I chose fingerling potatoes and they were perfect. I followed some other reviews and browned the meat with garlic and onion powder. I used flour also but done think it was necessary, the cornstarch thickens up the stew.   I added red wine in place of some of the water. I added a mixture of ketchup, A1 and Worcestershire sauce  (1T if each but don't think I really could taste it. May up it next time or leave it out)

Everyone loved this! Used cast iron for this and floured meat before browning. Add splash of food red wine in it as well. If I use celery again it needs to be small pieces about half inch in size.

This was excellent! Exactly the flavor profile I was looking for. So flavorful and satisfying. The meat was super tender and the veggies were cooked but not mushy.  I served it over riced cauliflower and with a dollop of sour cream on top.  Great cold weather comfort meal.

This was great! I agree that it needs more flavor, which could be from me using beef stock instead of bouillon and water. I threw the beef with 1/4 cup flour, a teaspoon garlic salt, a teaspoon onion powder, and half a teaspoon pepper before I browned it which definitely added flavor and helped the broth thicken. I ended up adding about 1.5 teaspoons salt as well as a packet of beefy onion soup mix, and cooked it around three hours. Without this I don't think it would have been as flavorful, which is why I deducted a star. With my changes it was thick, beefy, hearty, and everything a beef stew should be!

I seasoned with 2 tsps of basil, 2 tsps of parsley, and 2 tsps of rosemary. I seasoned salt and pepper to taste. I took the advice of another user and used 1 tblsp of A1 Sauce and 1 tblsp of Worsteiner. I thickened the stew with a corn starch and flour mixture. Adding water to the stew takes away from the flavor. Use beef broth instead! I also leave out the beef cube because I don't like a lot of salt. I boil a cup of egg noddles on the side and serve add them to the soup, one bowl at a time ( I let guests add them if they want and the amount of the noddles they desire) Overall, the stew was really good! I have it made so many times and every time is tastes amazing!

This was delicious however I omitted the green beans and mushrooms as my family won't eat them. I also used 2 cups of red wine  and used them to deglaze the pan after i seared the beef and it made for an incredible rich flavor.  After deglazing the pan I added the bay leaf and seasonings and added oregano as well. I also added some smoked paprika to the flour when I coated the beef cubes.
I truly feel making these changes made all the difference.
Next time I will add the mushrooms since I love them and feel they would have added to the dish.

Delicious and I did a double batch to have some later this week.  I made most of the changes suggested in other reviews - coating the meat with a seasoned flour, adding the red wine.  I sautéed my meat with the onion, skipped the celery and added a bag of frozen peas instead.  I cut large carrot chunks and used petite red potatoes, quartered or halved.  I let it simmer all afternoon and neither were mushy.  I used the broth (a little thickened from the flour and deglazing) with a 1/4 c of cornstarch to thicken it and it worked perfectly.

Best beef stew! I usually use a crock pot, but plenty of those recipes and outcomes turn out unappealing. Try it, you'll be pleasantly surprised! (The only deviation from the recipe is that I threw the onions in with the beef  and included mushrooms along with the rest of the vegetables.)

Stick to your ribs good on a cold night. I use beef broth or stock instead of the bullion cubes which tend to be too salty. I  add mushrooms ... because I like them. Otherwise, I have made it as written for years with great success.

If you've read through the reviews this far, stop and just make this stew!  One of the best stews I've made or eaten. I followed the recipe with a few minor changes based on other reviews.  I did coat the meat with flour (1/4 cup), garlic powder (1/2tsp.)and Montreal steak seasoning (1/2 tsp.). I also brushed it with kitchen bouquet browning sauce to give it a nice color.  After browning meat, I deglazed the pan with some water and couple Tblsp of sherry vinegar ( didn't have red wine on hand).  Next time I would add some more of the veggies but that's a personal preference. The rosemary really makes this a hearty comforting dish!

I made it as written, and it is a very good stew. My husband also enjoyed it. It was even better the second day after being refrigerated and reheated. I did add more cornstarch to thicken it, as the recipe suggests. We really enjoyed the rosemary flavor.  I'll probably use low salt beef broth in place of the water and bouillon next time and try some other cooks' ideas.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It was very good! My only issue was it was a little salty. I might try to omit bouillon cubes and just use low sodium beef stock next time. I did add a little bit more corn starch slurry to thicken it up a bit more and it was perfect! I will definitely make again!

I love this recipe but I spice it up a bit. When I add the beef bouillon water solution I add three chopped red peppers, 3 jalapeños, and a red onion and then continue the recipe as normal except I do add 5 teaspoons of corn starch to thicken the stew compared to the 2 teaspoons the original recipe calls for. I'd recommend to try this if any one loves stew and spicy food.

This was great!!! I served 3 people and there is still enough to serve about 3 more. I do have to add into the recipe however, i did add 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, it needed some taste and salt flavour. I also added 2 more teaspoons of cornstarch.  I just added every ingredient all at once, nothing was too soft or mushy, it was the perfect soul food for a cold night here in  Canada. The beef just fell apart, however I did cook it for about 5 hours! So delicious, such a great recipe.

Great recipe. I, like others  who have reviewed it, made similar changes. I added 1/2 cup of red wine from last night's bottle, I doubled the corn starch for thickness, and 15 minutes before it was done, I added a can of cut green beens and some frozen peas. I was careful with the salt and only added it as needed through the cooking process. This is one we will enjoy over and over!

First time making it, based on reviews I tweaked some: tossed uncooked meat in flour, garlic powder, pepper before browning, doubled corn starch,  added 1 more count of celery, potato & carrots each, added teaspoon of Worcestershire & teaspoon of dried chipotle peppers when adding veggies. Awesome work lunch! Next time will try subbing some water for red wine. 

Thanks for the recipe!

Taste wasn't too bad, but despite following the directions to a T- I wound up with more of a soup than a stew. Didn't taste bad, but leaned a bit towards the bland side. Wouldn't make again

I have tried this with beef and lamb. I prefer the lamb. I also find that after the first hour most of the liquid has evaporated and have to add some more after the veggies are added.

Followed all directions and ingredients. Turned out like a messy mush. It was not a good looking stew. I didn't like how bland it tasted.

This has become my go-to recipe for Beef Stew.  My family loves it, and the flavor is even better as leftovers on day two.  I increase the beef to 3 lbs., increase the beef bouillon to 10 cubes, and double all the spices (rosemary, pepper, parsley).  I also use more cornstarch for a thicker stew.  It's fantastic.  Nothing better than a bowl of this stew and some crusty french bread on a cold winter night.

I only added two potatoes, cutting down on carbs, added more carrots & garlic. Cooked it in my crock pot on low for 9 hrs.  I served it with warm Italian bread. Great comfort food on a chilly day!

This was pretty good but I think there is a problem with the quantities. It says 2tsp water. Should it be 2cups maybe? So I added 2 cups water and then some more and it was still dry. So this really threw me off. I had to add more water and adjust the flavour accordingly.

I made this beef stew recipe tonight for the first time for my husband and I.  I followed the recipe as it sounded very good as is.  The very slight extra I did do was to add some salt & pepper to the beef when it was browning.  As it was for only the two of us I did cut the recipe in half but still added a fair amount of carrots (5 small)  and two large potatoes, three small onions as they were very small and a couple of large celery sticks as we love the veggies in the stew!   I did read several reviews that said they added worcestershire, A1 steak sauce, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, etc., but you certainly don't need all that.  With adding all of those flavors you wouldn't taste the beef and those delicious vegetables!  I used the Knorr's beef bouillon in the little pot to boiled water for the beef broth instead of those salty bouillon cubes and it was delicious.  Just before serving I added a very light dusting of salt & pepper to the stew and served with a kaiser roll.  My husband said it was absolutely delicious and I have to agree with him!  YUMMMY!!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  It is a keeper, for sure!!!  :)

I liked it a lot. Made it exactly as written. Recipe could use some more carrots. Next time I'll add some mushrooms and maybe some peas.

Good base recipe. I tried to stick close to the posted original for this first attempt, but made the following changes: (a) replaced bouillon cubes and water with no-salt-added beef broth, (b) added red pepper flakes, and (c) used fresh instead of dried parsley (not available), added later in the cooking process.

When I make it next time, I'll try degreasing the stew and altering the seasoning.

This is a new family favorite! I did add in some of the additions from others (dust meat with flour, garlic/onion powder), added mushrooms at the end, added Worcestershire and Ketchup and added browning & seasoning sauce. This will be a regular staple in our home!

I liked it alright as is and honestly review it as a 3 but the second time I made it I changed it up a bit and it made a much better stew. I still use this as my base recipe. 

 My changes : I  added a couple spoonfuls of tomato paste, a cup of frozen corn, TRIPLED the cornstarch  (I like thick strew) used chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon. I also used a bag of baby carrots, mainly cause it's easier to just dump in the pot :p those changes made it a 5 star recipe for me :)

This stew is really great! The beef just melts in your mouth. I add red wine and Worcestershire sauce as well as a splash of balsamic vinegar. I use water and Better Than Bouillon. Add mushrooms and eyeball the other veggies to our taste. It's so good and rich.

This was fantastic but I did make some changes. I did not use rosemary, and instead substituted Italian seasoning. I used garlic powder as well. Instead of using regular carrots I chopped baby carrots into several pieces. Instead of using a whole onion I used half. I used the water and bouillon but I also added beef stock as needed throughout the cooking process when it looked like more liquid needed to be added. I also used Worcestershire sauce liberally twice: once when I added the vegetables and again when i was almost done but to taste. I did not add salt because the salt in the bouillon was enough. I did like others said and use more cornstarch than in the recipe.

Really good! I followed the recipe for the most part and used some tips from other reviewers. I dusted the beef in flour, garlic, and pepper before browning. (I do that with roast too.) I added extra carrots and used one less celery stalk (doesn't matter, we just like carrots more and celery not so much). I also added 1/2 cup of red wine and one tbsp. of worscheshire (sp).  Turned out fantastic! I put it in my favorites. Thanks!

P.S. - I cooked the onions in the first hour with the beef, then I added the carrots alone for about 20 minutes before I added the potatoes.

This recipe is so easy. I do not like to spend a lot of time cooking because it is more like a chore to me.  I only made a few modifications.  I marinated the stew meat in a pinot noir, I used 4 cups of vegetable broth and I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the recipe during the second step and after the meal was completed.  It was very delicious and would recommend it to people to try.

Easy Peasy and absolutely delish! Added some garlic during the browning stage and substituted 1 cup of red wine as mentioned in the video. Had a cup of gravy in the fridge from a pork roast which I added to make this a perfect meal for a rainy night.

A great, easy stew to make. Perfect for when you have guests coming over and you don't have much time after work - you can prepare it the night before and it tastes great the next day.

I give it five because it had a very nice flavor, plus the meat and veggies were cooked to perfection.  I did add about 1/2 cup of red wine.  That is the only change I made.  My kids loved it.

Perfect stew on a cool Fall night!  Instead of using cornstarch to thicken I lightly dredged the meat in 1/4 cup flour seasoned with salt and pepper and seared the the meat in the oil.  I then used the broth to scrape up the brown bits.  As the stew cooked, the flour perfectly thickened the broth so a cornstarch slurry wasn't used.  Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't change this or change that....sort of defeats the purpose of following a recipe to me. I did have to substitute beef broth for beef cubes though. I would have used cubes but didn't have any. I love this stew because it doesn't use flour. Most reviews were..."love this stew but added flour and _______ and _______". Technically, you aren't reviewing THIS stew anymore when you do that! Great stew recipe. Very tasty. I make this stew at least once a month. Sometimes twice! Thanks for the recipe! Perfect without adding anything! Yummy!

I found it bland. So I added salt, still bland. I added ketchup, extra water and cornstarch and worcester, still bland. Boring.

I really liked this recipe.  It was simple and tasted great.  I was trying to avoid using the normal stew seasoning packet from the grocery store and this tasted much better.  I had to cook it for more like 3 hours.  I guess I was using slightly lower temperature than the original recipe.  I added mushrooms once the carrots and potatoes were soft.  I also used frozen leaks instead of onion.   It was easier and still tasted great.  I had trouble browning my meat.  I forgot to dry it from the package and I think it must have had too much liquid still.

Made this and should have doubled it, especially since starving college grandson came for dinner.  I did dredge the meat in flour before browning and had to use a bit more oil because of that but that was the only change.  Warm bowls of stew and homemade biscuits, what is not to love?

Followed Chuck Sampson's suggestions of searing meat dredged in flour & spices, adding more vegetables and adding ketchup, Worcestershire, and A1 sauce.  Needed more thickening than recipe called for.  FANTASTIC!!

I was looking for a quick and simple beef stew recipe and I found it.  I made a few small changes but all in all this was a great little recipe.  I didn't use the bullion cubes. I opted to lightly salt and pepper my meat after patting it dry and I used 4 cups of unsalted beef stock. I also added 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar with the fourth cup of stock in place of the wine.  I don't drink and I find it difficult to buy a bottle of wine for one recipe, so I found this to be a good substitute.  The meat was tender and the veggies cooked up great.  Also the sauce was just right with the cornstarch add in. Very filling.  Next time I'll be doubling the recipe.  YUMO!!

In my experience, the key to tender meat is long, slow simmering. I kept mine simmer at least 2 hours, at a bare simmer. I used beef stock instead of water or cubes, although I did make it with cubes once and it was still yummy. .  Because I cook stews so that they are filled with veggies, I did adjust those by sight and taste, adding at least  2 more carrots and celery and potatoes.

I consider this a personal preference since vegetables can differ in size.. The broth tastes wonderful and some might prefer a less thick stew.

 I also added more Rosemary because mine was not brand new so I wanted the herb to be more obvious. When chopping celery, I always chop some leaves for the added taste. Again, a personal preference. 

I am sure the stew would be wonderful without any tweaks.

First time ever making stew. Didn't know how to approach but this was one of the recipes that caught me and gave me direction. I made changes from other comments. I used flour in a bag with a Tsp onion powder, garlic powder and pepper and shake the meat up in there. Nice and coated added flavor. Browned them all up in a separate pan. Meanwhile the pot I put olive oil in and added the chopped onion, broke them down a little and started adding the meats and stock, spices and veggies. Brought to boil and simmered...I will take out rosemary next time, not a fan. Added a shot of some good red wine. I used flour to thicken rather than starch. Potatos got enough as it is. Also added a Tbs of worshershire, A-1 and ketchup. It sat and sat and came out excellent, will definitely have a peppery taste. Pregnant girlfriend devoured it!!!!!!

Turned out beautifully... the meat was so tender and tasty! The only adjustment I made was to put a lot more cornstarch to thicken it up, though that may just be a matter of preference for thick gravy. The leftovers the next day were actually tastier than the night it was made.

I made this for the first time today.  Made the receipe based on others suggestions by doing the following:  mixed 1/4 cup of flour, 1 tsp. of onion powder and garlic powder with 1/4 tsp. of pepper in a ziploc bag and added stew meat and shook to cover.  I also added 1 tbls. of ea. A-1, ketchup, and Worcestershire sauce with 1/4 cup of Marsala wine before adding the cornstarch mixture to the liquid.  I also added 5 times the cornstarch mixture to get a thicker gravy.

This receipe is by far the best beef stew I have ever tasted.  I will only be using this receipe in the future.  So yummy and I am not really a beef stew lover, but I am now.  Thanks for all of the suggestions only enhances the flavors a of the original receipe!!!

I thought this was decent.  It's not quite what I was looking for in taste.  It may have been the crushed tomatoes that I could've done without but I'm not sure.  I will keep looking for another recipe for beef stew.  Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out to be a fantastic stew, however a head's up that when halving the quantity to 5, it changes 4 cups of water to 1 tsp of water, which is not nearly enough.

I added 1/8 C flour, a pinch or so each of turmeric powder, mustard powder, paprika, salt & pepper to coat the meat and then seared in pot before following rest of recipe. I also picked fresh parsley and rosemary to use instead of using dried.

I followed closely but like others shook the beef cubes in 1/2 c. of flour, 1tsp garlic and onion powder and 1/2 tsp pepper. I deglazed with white wine (as it was open) and added 2tbsp of cornstarch as I like a thick stew. It is just delicious on a cold fall day. Next time made it with red and added parsnips as I had them. Fantastic!

Even my kids loved this recipe!  I might even try it with venison next time, instead of beef.  This time I used top sirloin 1 inch cubes, coated in a mixture of 1/4 c. flour, 2 tsp garlic powder, 2 tsp onion powder (shake it up in a ziploc baggy).  Also added 1/2 cup red wine to the beef broth.   After adding all the veggies, my hubby tried it and said it was bland and needed a little something, so I added the following:  1 -8oz can tomato sauce, 2 TBS minced garlic, 2 TBS worcesteshire, 1 TBS brown sugar, 1 pkg dry onion soup mix.  Now it's FABULOUS!  Love it!

I followed Chuck Sampson's review/changes and it was great!  I did make a few minor changes.  I used Italian seasoning instead of the rosemary and parsley and I used cabbage instead of celery.  I let this simmer for 2-3 hours and I did not need the cornstarch and water.  It was excellent!

I love it, but my husband wanted a little more spice to it, so he added some hot sauce to his, but I thought it was great!

Absolutely fantastic. 
I also added in about a tbl sp of minced garlic to the beef while it was cooking. I also had to about 1 cup more water and some more cornstarch to get it to the thickness that I wanted but in the end the family loved it. Not even a spoonful of leftover!

I followed the recipe to a t, and wasn't happy with the result. It lacks flavor. Tastes more like soup (a bland-tasting soup) than stew. The rosemary was good initially, but the celery overtook its flavor.

Followed exactly except used a box of broth ( didn't have boullion).  Crock pot - awesome!  The only beef stew recipe I'll use...

Really great. As a guy who is new to cooking, I never thought I would make "chunky" quality beef stew. A tspn or two of corn starch really did the trick.

Can't believe something so delicious was so easy to cook, it took me just few minutes to cut the veggies, the beef already comes chopped from the butcher store, put everything together as the recipe describes and that's it, the rest is just waiting while it cooks. I just added some peas but besides that I didn't  change anything from the recipe. I complemented with basmati rice and ta-da, there it was a great dinner.

Not bad. I like my food more heavily seasoned than some people, so I made a few changes: doubled the amount of pepper, rolled the cubed beef in seasoned salt and meat tenderizer before cooking, substituted a cup of wine for one of the cups of water, and used flour instead of corn starch. I also used a handful of pearl onions instead of chopping a regular onion.

My husband's exact words were "This stew is awesome."  I couldn't believe how good this simple recipe was.  I only made two changes:  I used 6 tsp. of 'Better Than Bouillon Vegetable Base' along with 6 cups of water, and I only used one pound of stew meat since I like my stew heavier on vegetables.  I think what makes this stew so good is the rosemary.   I will use this recipe for years to come.

Although my wife does not like a heavy meal, this one was very good. Followed the directions except we added the ketchup, worchesterchise, and other spices as recommended by reviewers. Awesome. Meat melted in your mouth on the day after. 
Gonna save this recipe as a "keeper". You should try it, but add the additional spices for more flavor!

This is a great recipe and I have made many times over the last few years.  However, I make it over the top by first coating my meat with flour seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder.  I don't use bullion personally so I can afford to add some salt to the seasoned flour.  I use Better than Bullion in water to make 4 cups worth.  After browning the meat in batches in a dutch oven, I add in the broth to deglaze all the goodness stuck to the bottom and then add back in the meat.  I then add in a few tablespoons of each Worcestershire and A1 sauce.  I follow the rest of the recipe.  Always a great, great meal!  Thank you for this recipe!

Wicked stew !!! I've never made a stew ever, but decided to give it a try. Looked here found a couple good ones, but chose to do this recipe, of course I changed and adjusted the amount of the ingredients I used, due to the serving amount. The result ? Lush!!! I alone had two helpings, even made some homemade garlic bread to go with it. Believe me, after eating, I literally got "the itis", and fell asleep, just like I do when I stuffs me gob on thanksgiving and Christmas.

Meat is phenomenally tender. I used a whole a cup of wine so a bit more corn starch. I also added a sprig of fresh thyme and used fresh rosemary as I got some for free. I followed the one suggestion of putting flour, onion powder, garlic powder and pepper with the nest and shaking it around before cooking. First time and I'm hooked!

I changed it up a lot. I didn't have corn starch so, I coated the beef in flour and seasoned it. I added garlic too which I fried until fragrant prior to cooking/browning the beef. I'm also Latina so, I can't live without tomatoes; I added a can (796mL) of diced tomatoes. I'll post a picture later.

I made  this using basil instead of parsley (had none). I was using up my vegetables so used two containers of beef broth instead of one.  The broth was bland and I love the broth part of beef stew the best.  Now I am seeking assistance to get the perfect broth.

This was delicious but I did tweak based on reviews. I used 5 pounds of beef so I had to double ingredients and adjust a little. I shook the meat with 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 tsp each of garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper before browning. I added 1 cup red wine, 1 can beef broth, and 2 tbsp each of ketchup, A1, and Worcestershire sauce to the base. And I didn't really measure the veggies. Just added enough to look right. The potatoes I used are baby yellows so they don't get mushy. So tasty!

I don't know many recipes and I have a fiancée that likes home cooked meals.  I've made this recipe without making any changes to it and it has always been so so so good. It does take some time but it's easy and hard to mess up!  Fiancée loves it if I can make at least one delicious plate that's a good start right?? Also the beef is perfect for my little two year old to eat easily!!! Everyone is happy even my dog who gets some  carrots. -cheers and happy cooking!!

The flavor was great, I did add a little more water half way through simmering because it had an almost to strong flavor. I also added peas.

The best stew I have had...the flavors were amazing. I did make minor changes, floured my beef and seasoned with my favorites before cooking. I also cooked it longer than the 2 hours. Will definitely make again!

This is a great recipe.  It is very tasty and can be made with relative ease. I followed the instructions precisely and came out with a great meal.  The next time I make this stew, I will try some of the recommended variations.

Delicious! I added a package of sliced mushrooms as well as changed the potatoes to those small creamer potatoes that are red and white and deep dark black. I also added worcestershire sauce and let it simmer for many hours. It was so yummy and the house smelled like heaven. It was even better the next day. I'll be making this again tomorrow actually - now that I have someone in town who will be wowed with a nice hearty meal- this one popped right to mind! Thanks!

When my husband tasted it he said it had NO TASTE OR FLAVOR whatsoever which is what I was worried about because I didn't taste it before handing it out. I added some salt and seasoning salt at the last minute and he said it made it a little better.

This was my attempt at Stew in many many years.  It turned out good. They were pleased. I will make it again when in the mood for Stew.

This recipe is a great one for those that don't want to use a slow cooker. 
It's a little over two hours from start to finish. 
I strayed a little by adding mushrooms once and it was awesome.

Made it almost exact as per the ingredients. Just added a small amount of red wine, and a bit of garlic powder, salt and pepper to the meat an hour before cooking.

Following a couple of tips from other reviewers, I floured and browned the beef, deglazed with red wine and followed the recipe from there.  Thank you, Paula, for this.

I am a retired chef so had to monkey with the recipe, sorry. Made it yesterday as written for myself, the proportions are excellent and the seasoning is really good except for the salt. Today I made it for company and made the following 3 changes. #1 I added garlic  ( I like garlic and it is really good for you) #2 when I sautéed the meat in olive oil I added the vegetables and sautéed them as well. (it is a flavor thing) #3 and most important I did not use bullion cubes. To much sodium for an old guy like me. I used beef stock I made. (Swanson low sodium would work as well) I will make it again, company loved it.

Good recipe but, of course like most cooks I made changes to make this recipe my own. However, I did need this recipe as a guide and appreciate the post.

OLIVE OIL: I use California  (not Italian -no guarantee it is even olive oil as of 2016) pure virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Less olive oil is needed.

LIQUIDS: Instead of four cups of water I used 2 cups of 100% all-natural beef broth (Swanson's  when I don't have mine on hand), 1/2 cup of red wine and 1 & 1/2 cups water.

NO bouillon cubes.

GARLIC! 2-3  Garlic cloves, minced, depending  on size and individual preference. I add to the onions.

This is a GREAT stew! I've made it twice now. Per others advice, I put 1/4 c of flour, a few  dashes of onion salt (I did not have onion powder on hand) a few dashes of garlic powder and pepper in a gallon bag and shook it up with the meat then browned the meat with seasonings in olive oil. For extra spices per others advice, I added a few tbsp of ketchup, a few dashes of Worcestershire, and a few dashes of tobasco sauce. Really made a good flavor! I didn't have the time to let the beef bollian water simmer for an hour and the meat simmers or an hour. I just made it and threw it all together and it still was delicious and meat tender. I also used  about 10-12 little potatoes (it's what I had on hand)instead of the normal size russet potatoes. They softened in great time...using those I also don't have to peel... Just a matter of preference.  Will definitely be using this recipe!

Great base! As per advice of other reviewers, in a bag I put 1/4 cup flour, teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and shook the meat around in it. I added extra veggies, (1 more carrot, celery, potato & 1/2 of an extra onion). I also added 1 tblspn each of ketchup, bbq steak sauce and Worcestershire sauce. SOOOOOoo good!!

I followed Charles Sampson's advice on this one, and it turns out really good! 

It doesn't save well though. The vegetables turn to absolute mush, but that's to be expected.

Very good and simple recipe, I made mine in the crock pot.  I ended up adding flour to thicken the broth, garlic powder, onion powder, and a little Worcestershire sauce.  Next time I would add red wine in place of some of the broth.

I only added a little Worcestershire sauce. The corn starch sauce made the dish lighter and more appealing than a flour gravy. Yum!

This stew is very good and healthy.  It is a great meal for a cold winter night and the ingredients are those you should have in your home already, except for the beef that you would need to go to the butcher for.  I always double the recipe since I cook for 6 people.  I did not use as many bouillon because I followed the directions the first time and it was too salty and I always have packaged sodium free beef broth in my pantry, so I used that instead.

This is a good recipe but you need to change up the herbs.  The way its written with just rosemary and parsley the flavor is to bland for my taste.  But the cooking method is good.

Mostly my fault as I should have checked the sodium content of the beef cubes I used. Will use beef stock instead of water next time. Way too salty.  Also had to add more corn starch to get it thicker.

I made exactly as described with the exception of chopped onion (as I did not have any on hand) and substituted minced onion instead. My husband said this was the best beef stew he's ever had, and said the vegetables were done perfectly! This is my new go to. Fabulous!!!

This was very good. if you mind your potatoes getting mushy, don't use russet. Served it with a nice crusty bread and butter. Thinking leftovers are going to be great.

I added a few other veggies, parsnip, red pepper and potatoes. Added a few more carrots, doubled up on the rosemary and parsley and I used "better than Bouillion" because it is...........It was lovely. Totally would make again.

Delicious. It came out delicious. I seasoned the meat before browning and used less water. I'm making it for the third time today!  Use ukon gold potatoes. Yummy!  Meat is tender as butter. Everyone loved it.

This stew is great. I made it several times in durch owen and my family loves it. Last time I decided to try slow cooker. I did not  brown meat on a pan, I just put all the ingredients into the crockpot except cornstarch, set temperature to high level and let it cook for four hours. After that I added cornstarch dissolved in water, poured it into crockpot and cooked one more hour on high level. The result was even better than from dutch owen :-)

This recipe is great, making this a few times will build your confidence as the master of your kitchen.

I recommend making this recipe as is and tweaking it more often to make it YOUR dish!

in a bag I put 1/4 cup flour, teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder. 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Put the stew meat in, and shook it up baby! Then I cooked it up in my ( cast iron ) dutch oven and seared in those flavors. This really put some great flavor on that meat and the yummy bits stuck to the bottom of the cast iron pan easily came off during the deglazing with the liquids. I didn't cut back on any liquids..actually you will probably want to add more towards the middle-end of the cooking time. I used 1/2 cup of red wine during the deglazing with the other liquids. I thought it needed more vegetables since I made this recipe 2 weeks ago staying true to the recipe..but this time when I did it, I added an extra ( 1 more carrot, celery, potato ) I added 1/2 of an extra onion. I also took the advise of another reviewer and added 1 tblspn each of ketchup, A-1 sauce, and wistersire sauce that really gave it some full-bodied flavor. I trippled the amount of cornstarch as other people suggested to make it thicker

I used 3 lbs stew beef vs 2 lbs and there was beef in every bite. The rest I did exactly by the recipe and it was DELISH. We ate all the leftovers the very next day !! I will definitely make this again.

I think of stew as a thick broth. This was more like soup. It had a thin broth.

Easy & tasty.  Next time I'll add mushrooms since we love them but it was good without.  I did toss meat with seasoned flour & browned as others suggested and seasoned with an italian seasoning instead of just plain rosemary.  I didn't use cornstarch.

I substituted frozen vegetables for the celery and cooked it all in a crock pot for 6 hours on high.  Turned out great.  A definite winner.

Great recipe for which I only changed slightly. 1/2 cup red wine as someone else suggested. Also I used mini onions in place of the chopped. I sprinkled the meat with onion powder and garlic salt and added 1-2 Tbsp Worchestershre sauce. Very tasty and flavorful.

Hi followed Chuck Sampson's suggestions but added 1/2 tablespoon of cumin to the seasonings he put I n the bag to season the meat.  Also, I seared the meat in two batches to make sure all pieces of beef got seared.  I did add more liquid, another half cup of merlot.  At the very end, I added some 1 cup of deveined and chopped  kale, until it wilted.

I love this stew! I've made it a handful of times now and it's a big hit every time! The only real tweaking I did was add more broth and use fresh rosemary instead of dried. I also use WAY more rosemary than the recipe calls for since I love rosemary. This is on my list of simple meals to throw together. It takes a while simmer but the prep time is short.

I followed the suggestions of another reviewer to put the beef in a bag with 1/4 cup of flour, 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. of onion powder, and 1/4 tsp. of pepper. I also added 1/2 tsp. of salt into the mixture and then shook it all over the beef before cooking. I also added 2 bay leaves for the last hour of cooking. It was wonderful and I will make it again.

I made this for my son's birthday. At his request I reduced the celery and added parsnips. I'm generally not a parsnips fan, but they were great in this stew.

Before browning, I put the beef in a large ziplock bag and tossed it with a mixture of cornstarch, pepper, salt, garlic powder, onion powder and a dash of Montreal steak spice.

During cooking I added a few dashes of Worchestershire sauce for a bit of extra depth/zip.

20 minutes before end of cooking I added small balls of biscuit dough to the top of the simmering stew. And put the lid back on the pot.  The biscuits turned out great and made the stew seem a bit fancier.

To make the biscuit dough I simply combined:  1 ½ cups self-raising flour; ½ tsp garlic powder; ¼ cup shortening; ½ cup shredded Tex-Mex cheese; ? cup milk.

I made it in my dutch oven.  Flavor was very good except I thought the broth could be a little richer.  I added Worcestershire and beef boullion.  I used stew meat.  I liked the consistency.  It was thick but still had enough juice to serve over biscuits.

Add can of cream of mushroom soup, no cornstarch.
Sprinkle with some celery seed instead of using celery.
Left out Rosemary because didn't have any.

Cooked in crock pot. (No oil, enough water to give desired consistency.)

Husband really loved it!
Served with biscuits.

Very hearty beef stew--this isn't a complex recipe, but it's a good solid one, and everyone in the family liked it. Great for cold-weather or rainy days. Give it a shot, you won't regret it.

I read several reviews and increased the corn starch. I thought the consistency was fine. My family didn't care for the rosemary at all. I would consider making it again without the rosemary and adding other spices for more flavor.

I had never made beef stew before and I will never use a different recipe again. This was amazing! I followed another reviewer's advice and started out with coating the stew meat with 1/4 c. flour, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, and 1/2 tsp pepper (But i used Worcestershire/black pepper blend instead of pepper).  I also added 1 extra carrot and celery. I like the gravy a little thicker so I added about 2 TBSP more cornstarch (definitely mix in cold water first). Absolutely delicious recipe! Thank you so much!!  BTW, left overs are even better!!

Great stew! Except I boiled a roast in a crock pot for 8 hours with 2 bottles of IPA beer, garlic, onion, and bullion. Then added that to beef stock and boiled for an hour and continued to follow same recipe.

I substituted 1 cup of the water with Cabernet, and thickened the stew with a slurry I combined with a hand blender: 1/2 cup of broth and 1 cup of white beans, added in with the veggies. With some homemade, crusty baguette. Perfection!

This stew is great and my family loves it.  It is very easy to make and the aroma in the house draws everyone to the kitchen.  It has become on of our favorite dinners that everyone loves.  The only change I made was that instead of using beef bouillions that are salty, I used a low sodium box of beef broth.  The first few times I tried reducing the amount of bouillons, but it was still too salty.
I served the beef stew over white or brown rice and it is delicious comfort food for cold winters.

Very tasty! A bit too salty for me, next time I will only use 3 cubes instead of the 4 and add more meet as other reviewers tried.

Very good.   Added extra ingredients as other notes stated.   Used broth instead of water.  Also made buttermilk biscuits to go with it.   Delightful meal to make for someone.

A-MAZING!  I also served it in the Italian Bread Bowls (recipe on AR, from Kerri Skrudland - which are fantastic!).  Kids and adults alike gobbled it up. I did the meat in a dutch oven (floured/seasoned based on other reviews), transferred it into a crockpot (with  2c beef broth). I deglazed the dutch oven with 1 1/2c red wine, and transferred everything over to the slow cooker. I cooked it on high for one hour, added the vegetables, and cooked on high for 4 hours. I basically doubled the recipe, using 3lb of stew meat, and enough veggies to make me happy!  Absolutely a keeper!

Here is what I did. in a bag I put 1/4 cup flour, teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder. 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Put the stew meat in, and shook it up baby! Then I cooked it up in my ( cast iron ) dutch oven and seared in those flavors. This really put some great flavor on that meat and the yummy bits stuck to the bottom of the cast iron pan easily came off during the deglazing with the liquids. I didn't cut back on any liquids.. actually you will probably want to add more towards the middle-end of the cooking time. I used 1/2 cup of red wine during the deglazing with the other liquids. I thought it needed more vegetables since I made this recipe 2 weeks ago staying true to the recipe, but this time when I did it, I added an extra ( 1 more carrot, celery, potato ) I added 1/2 of an extra onion. I also took the advise of another reviewer and added 1 tblspn each of ketchup, A-1 sauce, and wistersire sauce that really gave it some full-bodied flavor...Wow!! Served it up to my family with some home made southern style buttermilk biscuits...mmm, mmm, good delicious!! As my Dad also said "There ought to be a law against cooking this good!"

Excellent and cheap to make. Only thing I added was I seasoned the beef with Montreal Steak seasoning when browning, used Better Than Bouillon instead of beef bouillon cubes, and added a splash of red wine.

This stew was great! My husband loved it.  I didn't have any parsley so substituted cilantro and it was delicious!  I doubled the herbs because I like to taste them. And because I was in a hurry, I used petite sirloin instead of beef for stewing.

This is so good and really makes the house smell great too. I deglaze the pot after browning the meat with red wine-at least a half cup...maybe more-you won't ruin it.  I don't use corn starch (ever) so I thinken at the end with a slurry of flour and cold water.  Thanks for posting a great recipe. We all love it.

Wonderful!  Instead of beef stew meat, I picked up a sirloin steak on sale and then just browned the steak whole.  Added the seasonings and also added garlic powered and onion powder.  After an hour, added the potatoes (about 6), over a half of a large bag of baby carrots, celery and onion.  Also took the suggestion of others, added 1t. Of ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and A-1 sauce at this point.  I added a little more water to cover the vegetables.   After the vegetables simmered for an hour, I shredded the meat and I actually took a masher and mashed the vegetables to make it more of a soup.  Very good, will make again.

Great stew! I added 1/2 cup of red wine as others suggested and trippled the cornstarch for a thicker soup. Before browning I followed another reviewer's suggestion of shaking up the beef in 1/4 cup flour, teaspoon of onion and garlic powder, and half a teaspoon of pepper.

This is a really good starting point for stew. But of course, I can't leave anything alone.  Ended up adding 4 cloves of chopped garlic while cooking the meat.  Also added Green Beans and mushrooms. After cooking it all together for an hour, added in about 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/3 cup of Stonewall Kitchen Maple Chipotle Grille Sauce.  For garnish, used the chopped celery leaves.  That brought it way over the top in terms of taste.

The stew was very moist and tasty but lacked that little extra punch.  I cooked it according to the directions but next time, will add some A-1 and Worcestershire sauce to give it the extra flavor it needs.

If I could there would be Stars off for what I added which wasn't included in the recipe.
The stars are for how the stew is prepared. Makes total sense, you won't over cook stew meat but you can over cook veggies,
Accident on my end- halved recipe, but not the luiqid, liked it better actually 
Should have added more veggies.
Added bbq sauce and ketchup to cooking liquid .
Will be making again!

Instead of adding cornstarch, follow Chuck's suggestions.  My cooking time is a bit different.  I cook down the stew meat mixture for 1 1/2 hours and then add vegetables and cook for an additional 45 minutes.  I use 2 bay leaves and a teaspoon of paprika and my magic ingredients?  Stir in 1 Tablespoon of sugar with added water to cover the veggies. After you add the vegetables add a generous squeeze of lemon juice.  The lemon juice perks up the vegetables.  I don't use ketchup and use two cloves of fresh minced garlic with the meat mix and Worcestershire sauce to perk up the meat.  Thanks to you both for posting.  This just resurrected childhood memories and tastes!

I'm not a stew person, but my family is. I made this and it was 5 star worthy. I even loved this. Next time I will add celery at the begining, as it was to firm. Carrots were perfect, and I added russet potatoes at the last 1/2 hour. I did add an extra 2 beef bullion cubes.

I did make a few changes. I followed the recipe but I added corn and peas. I love vegetables. I did have to increase the cornstarch from teaspoons to tablespoons, as I prefer a thicker gravy.  It was very good and my family liked it.

The last beef stew I made from memory was a dud, so I went to Allrecipes.  This was great.  I'm pretty sure it would have been good as written, but I used all the modifications from Chuck Sampson's review (they weren't very arduous), and also added 6 ounces of mushroom to boost the umami even more.  Then I threw some bisquick dumplings on top in the last 20 minutes.  I'm pretty critical of things I cook, but this was totally satisfying.

This was by far the best beef stew I have ever made! I followed the recipe to a T except I added 2 tablespoons of ketchup and a tablespoon of  worcester sauce before I simmered the broth and I used 2 liquid boxes of beef stock  in stead of the beef bullion dissolved in water. My fiancé is allergic to MSG  and it was in every bullion I have found. Its crazy how easy this is to make and how delicious it is! This recipe is now a staple in my house!

This recipe is great!!! I read the reviews before I made it and tweaked some things. 1) I added 5 bullion cubes b/c some others had said that it could be slightly bland. I didn't replace the water with any wines b/c my mother in law doesn't tolerate any "booze" in her kitchen. So adding the extra cube was great! Very flavorful! 2) I skipped the corn starch b/c I tend to like more brothy stews. 3) I added mushrooms just for some more veggie variety. But over all this is a great recipe!!! I will definitely hold this one in my arsenal!

Thought I had  made some of the best beef stew before I found this recipe.  I made with 2!/2 lbs of beef, doubled the rosemary and doubled the corn starch and added some more corn starch at the end and simmered for three hours.  INCREDIBLE!

Loved it!  
I made a few changes to mine.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and doubled the onion.  I also added a bit more potato than it called for and left out the celery because my wife and I don't care for it.  I also added 1 more cube of beef bouillon. 
The stew had excellent flavor and went great withe the Parmesan garlic biscuits I made.   Perfect cold weather dish!

I hate people that change the recipe and then rate it.  I am sure it would be wonderful as written but I did make some changes.  I only used one bouillon cube with 4 cups of water.  I also added a carton of low sodium vegetable stock because that is what I had on hand.  I also added rutabaga that was cubed about 2 cups it has a sweet taste.  In the last half hour I added a bag of mixed veggies. I added some kitchen bouquet for flavor and rich color.  I got 20 good size servings.  I did put some in the freezer.  Yum!

I added about 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it to the point were I would consider it stew, additionally bumped up the black pepper to 3 teaspoons and finally 7 good pinches of salt right at the end.

We've made this many times and used many of the suggestions from the reviews as well as following the recipe exactly. Following the recipe exactly, I consider this a four star. Following some of the suggestions in the reviews, this becomes the best stew I've ever made. Its even better when we coat the meat pieces in flour and seasonings before browning them. I like it best when I add my onions just after I've browned the meat, and cook them up a bit in the meat juices before adding the rest of the broth. We also really like the suggestion to substitute some red wine for some of the broth/bouillon. I use Better than Bouillon, which is excellent. I like to substitute red pepper flakes for black pepper and I grind my salt, red pepper flakes, rosemary, and often oregano before adding these to the stew because I find the herbs are most flavourful that way. This is a flexible recipe and good with all kinds of additional vegetables or with other vegetables substituted.

It turned out to be more like soup. I did let it simmer a while longer and even let it cook with the lid off. Also tried adding two extra teaspoons of cornstarch but nothing seemed to thicken it up. Plus the veggies needed to cook longer than 2 hours  in my opinion. All in all my husband loved it and it did have nice flavors  even as a soup.

This stew is excellent.  The meat is very tender and moist and the potatoes and carrots were nice and soft.  I used a box of beef broth unsalted instead of the bouillon cubes as I need to watch my salt intake.  I did not account for the amount of salt that is in celery and added one more stalk.  When I make it again it will be with less celery.  I did add more baking soda to thicken the juice.  I would definitely add a little more next time.

This recipe is very good. 
Changes were: 
I simmered the beef with Worcestershire sauce,
Instead of 4 cups of water, I added 2 cups of tomato juice and 1 box of beef stock. (Omitting the beef bouillon cubes)
It's a very hardy meal and filling.

Loved this! I did make it differently. I used 2 lbs of stew meat, 6 potatoes, 3/4 of a bag of baby carrots and added the cornstarch concoction 5 times. This was amazing. I will be making this again.

Loved it, hubby who is a picky eater LOVE it. Made it almost exactly as posted but used pre-made low sodium beef broth and about 50% more beef. The beef was an oversight on my part but nothing wrong with beef stew with more beef.

I followed the basic instructions searing the stew meat in olive oil, then added beef broth vs the bullion. I added a clove of minced garlic to the olive oil. Also, I added about a tsp of ground pepper and two tsp of salt and worked it into the raw stew meat before searing in oil.  Once I simmered the beef for an hour, I added the vegetables. But I chose to put ground pepper, 1/4 tsp of rosemary and a bay leaf for my seasonings along with the veggies. I added fresh sweet corn from the cob. I steamed two cobs until just cooked, then cut the corn off the cob. That way, the corn would be crunchy and the sweetness would stay intact. At the end, I had to add about a 1/4 of a cup of flour dissolved in water to thicken the broth.

I made a bunch of changes based on all the previous reviews, and this version was killer:  1.  flour/pepper/salt and then sear the beef.  deglaze pot with 1 cup red wine (or whatever I had on hand) - 
- 1 whole onion, chopped
- 1/2 lb mushrooms - a few shakes of garlic powder.  - frozen mixed veg (1/2 cup or whatever I had) - 1 tbsp Worstershire, 1 tbsp ketchup - and the cornstarch slurry (mix the cornstarch with cold water then take to a boil then continue cooking.  IT WAS AMAZING.

Great.  Used red potatoes so they'd stand up.  Used "Better then Bouillon" instead of cubes (gluten free).  Then, I added a TSP of Allspice which gave an interesting and flavorful aroma and taste.

This is a great, basic beef stew.  I cut the simmering in step 1 by about half because I was on a short timeline and it was still delicious.  I served it with beer bread and it was a hit!

This stew is great. Really enjoyed the flavor. I put both russet and golden potatoes in it.  Left it more liquids since it thickens as left overs. Simple one pot dinner. Made salad and biscuits. Great rainy day dinner.

I did not have the spices called for in the recipe so improvised. Added more water and browned meat coated with flour so didn't need to thicken at end with cornstarch. I added a touch of Worcester  sauce and cooking sherry. Really tasty stew. This is a keeper

Added pureed unsalted stewed tomatoes to liquid. Used a bay leaf, fresh rosemary, and 2tbl. corn starch to thicken. Added green beans. Served with Chef John's buttermilk biscuits. Delicious.

My husband and I really loved this stew! I did add a 3/4cup red wine to replace a 3/4 cup of beef broth,  and added 6oz. bella mushrooms, and 1 bay leaf. The rest was the recipe as stated. Served it over hot rice - was delicious and we're going to be making this again for sure! Thank you for sharing!

Made the changes recommended by Chuck Sampson and others (garlic/onion powder, more veggies, worcestershire, red wine, ketchup (added more bullion too)). Amazing!
Well done Allrecipes community!

This turned out great! I did as some other reviews suggested and coated the beef with a mixture of flour and spices prior to browning. I also swapped 1/2 cup of water for 1/2 cup of red wine and doubled the amount of cornstarch because we like a thicker sauce. The veggies were cooked perfectly and the meat was so tender. Next time I'll add some fresh mushrooms as well.

I made a few of the changes Chuck suggested and a few changes of my own. I added garlic, sage and oregano to the spices. I also bought a pre-tenderized Outside Round Roast, that was on sale, and cubed it. It was 3 pounds. It melted in your mouth. I prefer this way to buying stewing beef which can be fatty.

I usually make my stews in the crockpot but I needed to make more than mine will hold. 
The stovetop method with my large pot worked great.

Result... PLEASE make this again mom. This is the best you've ever made.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. :) :)

I made this Beef Stew tonight and it was delicious. Everyone in the house love it.  I did took some of the suggestions that I read. I put the beef stew in a bag with flour, garlic and pepper prior to browning the stew. Great Suggestion!  I also added additional starch and water to make the stew broth thicker as well. It was a hit in my house!  Thanks for the suggestions.

Its a bitter winter cold day and so I decided that I wanted to have stew cooking on the stove and ready for dinner.  I followed this recipe to a T other than a couple of things.  I added 1/2 a turnip and used 900 ml of Campbell's Beef Broth. As it simmered on the stove I could smell the stew throughout the house.  I'm anxious to have it for dinner.  I'd say it's going to be a hit since it smells so good.  I'll be making biscuits to go with it for the perfect end to a cold winter day.

Hearty beef stew.  Notes for self: flour w/s&p and dredge 1lb boneless short ribs, trimmed to 1 - 2 in pieces  Sear in dutch oven with 1 tbl olive oil.  Add two cloves garlic minced, at end of sear.  Add beef broth to cover (about 3c), scraping bits from bottom/side.  Add 1/2 tsp Better than Bouillion Roasted Beef.  Boil, then reduce to simmer.  Cover and cook for 1 hr (at 30min, ck liquid and stir).  Add red potatoes, carrots and celery, cook for 30min.  Stir, adding liquid as necessary.   Cook for 15 - 30min more.  Thickened enough by dredging flour, no cornstarch needed.

The hubs wanted stew! I followed many of the reviewers who put flour, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper in a bag with the meat and then shook it up. I did not use any salt at all. I then browned the meat in Marsala wine. Next added two cups of water mixed with bouillon granules and brought the meat to a boil. Then added the rosemary and parsley and veggies (minus celery) without waiting the hour. Return to boil. Next added a handful of uncooked barley and some coconut milk. Put the lid on and turned down to simmer for one hour. When it had about 15 minutes left, I added additional coconut milk and Worcestershire sauce to taste. Served with warm rolls. No need for cornstarch to thicken, as I used less liquid to begin with. Husband loved it!!!! I did too! Next time I think I will add mushrooms and green beans. Definitely will be adding this to our winter rotation.

Oh this recipe looked beautiful!  I followed the recipe like it's written but I read the reviews and I followed chuck Sampson review about placing the meat in a plastic bag I used his ingredients too.  I guess after reading his review I think I made his recipe because I added the extra carrot, celery, potato, red wine, ketchup, A-1 sauce and Worcester sauce I think this was a different recipe!  The taste was wonderful!  I added egg noodles.

I will try this but with fresh rosemary and fresh parsley.  I will likely tailor this to my husband's taste and he is Moroccan. I prefer to use oil and flour with paprika to thicken dishes like this rather than the recommended starch.

This is a great recipe with a little tweaking. I found that the two teaspoons of cornstarch were not nearly enough to thicken this to a stew. Also, next time I will add more pepper and just a quarter teaspoon of salt. Otherwise, this recipe was very solid with great flavor and very easy to make.

Loved by all meat eaters.  Great recipe.  Made it my style instead.  Sautéed onions and garlic for a few minutes first - then added the beef.  Proceed with the recommended process and ingredients.  But instead of beef bouillon - I added beef broth.  Also used my spiced olive oil.

This beef stew! Its really good. I basically followed the recipe as written, I just added more corn starch. I also added the little 'dressing' to it of 1Tbsp Ketchup, Worcestershire and A1 respectively that another reviewer suggested. I mixed this into the cornstarch and water blend for easy distribution.

It's quick and easy and I love that it's not a crock pot recipe that muddles all of the great flavors.

I followed what others had said and added Worcestershire
sauce and A1 steak sauce. That gave it a little kick. I also poured in some white wine. This stew had an amazing rich, full body flavor. I will be making this many more times. Thanks for the great recipe.

This has become my "go to" recipe for Beef Stew! Only after browning the beef, I add everything to my crockpot on low heat all day, and it's perfect  by the dinner time! Pair it with a Cab or Malbec!!!

This was very good stew! I made it exactly per recipe. I don't like large pieces of celery so i minced it - it added flavor and you couldn't even tell it was there. Next time I make it I think I will add some corn and less carrots.

Hubs really liked this and it was pretty easy to make. I did dust with seasoned flour before browning, used beef broth instead of water/beef bullion and I skipped the Rosemary because he doesn't care for it. I cut the onion in small wedges as opposed to diced so you could still see and taste them when finished. I didn't measure but I'm sure I added more cornstarch and it had a nice thick constancy.

This stew tastes great. Added 5x the amount of cornstarch, an extra 2 cups of water, an extra bouillon cube, a can of corn and 7 shakes of paprika. Wish I used red potatoes instead of russet, considering my potatoes are now mush. Oh and I'm not a fan of onions so I also added a tbsp of onion powder. Definitely will make again.

This recipe is delicious! I made some changes though.  I added A1 Steak Sauce (2 tbsp) and ketchup (2 tbsp).  I also added cajun seasoning (1 tbsp).  As for the other spices, I just went ahead and added extra so I can up the taste! Honestly turned out super delicious! I will be making this over and over again!

I read the reviews first and went with a couple of  suggestions, adding the garlic powder and onion powder to the flour, and adding the worcestershire, ketchup  and A1. I also upped the amount of potatoes and carrots. My husband gave this recipe a 5 out of 5 after his first plate full; then after his second plate he changed his rating to a 6 out of 5.  Thank you to all other cooks for the suggestions!!  They really made the difference.

I really like the simplicity of this recipe and the ability to add to it without risk of messing it up. I only cooked mine for an hour because I was in a hurry to get dinner on the table, but it still came out very good.  I would like to make this again. Next time, I think I will try adding some extra seasonings and will definitely let it simmer longer.

Great  recipe! I did make mine in the slow cooker because I had a busy day ahead of me.  I took the advice of other reviews and made the cornstarch mixture more than called for.  I also threw in some frozen corn and peas I had in the freezer during the last hour.  I did dredge the meat in flour that was seasoned, as per Chuck Sampson.  I also read another suggestion of adding A1 and ketchup, which I did. My husband loved this stew!!!  Can't wait for leftovers.  I made some Cajun cornbread to go with it.

So good! I used venison instead of beef. Added red wine, garlic, bay leaf and the ketchup, A1, and worchestershire sauce that others recommended. Instead of water use beef stock. This one is a keeper!

Wonderful stew!  Adding it to the "family recipes" for sure!  I followed all of the instructions above and took some notes from others for this recipe.  I added one more carrot, celery stalk, potato (Yukon gold), and half of a small onion.  I also used beef broth instead of boullion (one large carton, plus 1 can) so that it wouldn't be too salty.  I seasoned the beef with garlic powder on one side and pepper on the other before searing, and added 1 tbsp. each of ketchup, A-1, and Worcestershire.  Followed directions as stated, and thickened with Wondra instead of cornstarch as I just prefer that for thickening.

Used Chuck Sampson's suggestion to coat the beef in flour and to brown the beef before adding the water. Otherwise, exactly as the recipe.

Great recipe. The only changes I made was adding  a healthy splash of red wine, 1 or 2 tsp. salt,  1 tbsp each Worcestershire sauce & ketchup, & upped the flour / water to 1/4 C of each. Made dumplings & added them the last 1/2 hour of cooking. Delicious!

Made this for my husband last night while he was involved in his hockey game and I knew he wouldn't be complaining about the time it took. Lol....He loved it!! I did add beef broth instead of the cubes and increased my liquid to 8 cups as I had 3.5 lbs of stew meat and we like lots of gravy and I knew I could always use more cornstarch if it was too thin.  I also shook my meat in flour, onion and garlic powders, and fresh ground pepper before browning. I threw in 2 cups of fresh mushrooms in the last 30 minutes of cooking....served over homemade biscuits....yum!!!

I made a few changes but I would definitely make it again, in fact after my guys went back for seconds I was told I had to make it again.
Before I browned the beef I coated it with some flour, onion & herb Mrs Dash and garlic powder.  Instead of the rosemary I used about ½ tsp thyme, used beef broth not chicken and added sliced mushrooms.

Good hearty stew two small changes,added thyme with the rosemary and sweat your onions after you've browned your beef then return your beef to the pot,add your liquids,and follow the instructions.I also use fresh garlic how can you go wrong.

This stew was amazing just as it was written! The only thing I did different is put everything in the crockpot and left it for 5-6 hours.. It turned out perfect and the family absolutely loved it! My only side note is I used yellow potato's, not sure if that made a difference but I liked how they held together in the stew.

Browned the meat with several cloves of garlic for more flavor.
Added one can of stewed tomatoes in place of 1 cup of water.
Used 2 cups of beef broth for the rest of the cooking liquid instead of water.
When cooking the meat in the liquid I used 1 pealed yukon gold potato which broke down and thicken the sauce instead of the cornstarch near the end.
For vegetables I added cubed butternut squash and replaced the potato with a turnip.
Oh yeah, a splash of my favorite red wine when cooking the meat in liquid.

It's actually a good recipe.  I'm just old-fasioned, and have made stove-top stew almost all of my life (73 yrs.).  I put the pieces of meat (we use venison or elk because we have it) in a gallon bag with flour, salt and pepper to taste and shake it so every piece is covered.  Then I brown the meat in olive oil, put the seasonings over the meat and add chopped onion and garlic to taste turning the meat so it gets browned evenly.  I also, half way through the browning pour in a decent (not cooking wine) red wine...enough to half-way cover the meat, and finish the browning with a cover over the pot, still stirring now and then.  To the now browned meat, I add liquid bullion and water, about half and half, to about two inches above the meat being sure to stir up all of the good stuff in the bottom of the pot.  Bring to a boil, turn down to a good simmer, add the carrots, and a teaspoon (or to your choice) of celery salt (we don't like celery in dishes, just the taste), cover and simmer slowly (checking for liquid level from time to time and stirring) until carrots are almost to your tenderness choice, and then add potatoes, and if called for, more bullion and/or red wine.  Simmer covered until potatoes and carrots are done to your liking.  At this point, you can thicken your juices with flour (my preference) or cornstarch and water or bullion, stirring often.  I often make stew a day ahead as the tastes meld overnight and it's much richer.  I also, on occasion add Chinese Five S

Good, and close to my usual.  Prefer mine without potato in the stew and served over mashed potatoes. I like turnip in it too. Just a few cubes from a small one.  Also always like bay leaf instead of rosemary to get the taste just like my Moms. I use red wine sometimes if available tho Mom never did. Thanks, your recipe made me want to make this now that fall is here. Use chuck beef for best results.

Oh my gosh. This stew was amazing. Set serving size to 14.  Used about 2 1/2 lbs beef a cut above stew beef. Used 1/2 cup of flour and 2 tsp onion and garlic powder and 1 tsp pepper to coat beef. Browned. Used 1 cup sweet red wine to deglaze.  Added 4 2/3 cups beef broth. And dry parsley and Rosemary. 1 tbsp A-1 and wistershire sauces. Simmered 1 hour. Added more than recommended celery, carrots and red potatoes, onion and simmered another hour. Added 2 tsp to small amount of cold water and added to stew. Amazing! Served with whole grain bread from the bakery.

Love all the ingredients but modified it by using moose meat and floured the meat first with some seasoned flour.  I used Montreal steak seasoning for some zip. Browned the meat and added minced fresh garlic just before adding the liquids. I used 4 cups of beef broth and 1/2 cup red wine for liquids plus a splash or two or more of Worsestershire sauce. The stew was delicious. A define do-again.

I left out the rosemary, not a fan. I added 1tsp basil plus green beans because I had them in the fridge. I added 1tsp salt after the fact because it needed some extra flavor. Delicious served with some garlic ciabatta bread!

Just like my mom used to make, however, in traditional beef stews, a bay leaf was ALWAYS added. Fresh carrots, too. It helps to make a more flavorful, savory stew. Adding a few peas toward the end of cooking adds to the flavor and color also.

This was absolutely delicious! I love that I could make it on the stove and not in the crockpot. I added a little more corn starch than it called for. Couldn't believe all the flavor with those three simple spices. Amazing. My go to stew recipe from now on.

Took the advice of others and shook the meat first in a baggie filled with 1/4 cup of flour and some seasonings (pepper, garlic salt, and chicago style rub).  Didnt have any celery, so i cooked it without.  I didnt seem to miss it.  I was also out of rosemary :( but i added some other good spices, included "slap your mama", and the flavor was delicious.  I think i will add portabella mushrooms next time and more meat.  Because of the flour, i didnt add the corn starch, but if you wanted it thicker you could.  i might try adding some wine next time too :)  It was a surprisingly good stew for such simple ingredients.  i think i prefer this over my crock pot version :)

Will absolutely make this again. I followed the modification tips from Freelancer (3 tsp pepper, 1 tsp garlic powder) and really upped the amount of cornstarch. Used Better than Bouillion brand beef base and added about 1 tsp of salt near the end. Red potatoes cut into quarters. Easy peasy, and even more delicious the next day for lunch!

The recipe was awesome! You definitely have to plan for it, but totally worth it and so easy! The only thing was with mine I put too much cornstarch in it, so I have to remember for next time less is more.

This was fantastic with some homemade biscuits. The only thing I changed was adding more cornstarch/water mixture and I didn't have celery so I used peas at the end. The meat was very tender and the broth was super flavorful. Great recipe! I will be adding this to my list of frequent flyers.

Stew in pretty forgiving.  Lots of ability to use what you have on hand.  My fresh green beans and tomatoes were getting old, so I tossed them in the stew too.  The tomatoes, I ran thru the Nutra Ninja first.  Delish

Very good flavor, big hit with the family. I added 1 c. more water, used Better than Bouillon (beef) for the broth - in my opinion that product always makes a better broth.  I did season the meat with salt/pepper/garlic at the browning stage.

This recipe is great and is pretty easy to prepare.  I read the reviews and tripled the cornstarch along with adding a 1/2 cup of red wine which gave it an awesome taste.  I have made this my favorite recipe and will use it from here on out!

My husband stated that this was the best stew he has ever eaten. 

After reading reviews, i made the following changes.....used 2 cups water and 2 cups red cooking wine. I added a couple splashes of Worcestershire sauce. I used 4 red potatoes (unpeeled) and I did use more cornstarch as was recommended.  I opted to cook this in my dutch oven at a very low temp until the last 20 minutes, making my cook time about 5 hours. 
I will make this again.

What a delicious recipe. I am new to cooking and this recipe couldn't have been simpler. My husband and daughter love it. Very easy and you don't really have to keep an eye on it. I did change a little bit of the recipe. Right before you cook the meat I did what another reviewer said and put the meat in a bag with 1/4 flour added a teaspoon of garlic and onion. powder with half a teaspoon of pepper. Shaking it all up, it smells amazing. Then you fry it in oil to really capture those flavors in the meat. As for the bouillon cubes, for me they never really dissolve like I wanted them to so I purchased the beef powder bouillon and it tastes amazing. Delicious. One of my favorite recipes from this site.

Made this tonight, with no changes. I used Herb Ox brand bouillon w/ no MSG (but WITH sodium), and the stew still tasted under-seasoned. I needed to add a little salt and a dash of Worchester at the table to keep it from tasting so bland. If you serve it with a salty biscuit and salted butter (as I did), you the salt in those other foods will round out each mouthful. Otherwise, good recipe for someone watching his/her sodium intake.

Made this for family dinner. Planned for 5 people, had 9 so I added extra veggies and a whole bag of small golden yellow potatoes as suggested by another reviewer. I added ketchup and worchestershire (didn't have A1). I had to add more liquid due to the added veggies. Everyone loved it! I served with Kentucky Biscuits from this site. They are fool proof.  Note- Definitely add the A1 or more worchestershire and up the seasonings a little, just saying. BTW there were no leftovers.  Will be making again.

I cooked the stew for five men at a foster home. They all liked it and wanted more, even the man who usually only eats fast food. It was a hit! I did not change the recipe.

Great stew. I did follow some reviews and changed a few things. I also added a can of beer instead of the suggested wine and added a few bay leaves and thyme. Added some parsnips, corn and a quarter of a small cabbage(closer to the end of cooking) for extra veggies. Placed the quarter cabbage on the top of the stew and let the stew cook the cabbage, gently. Delicious!!!

Per the suggestion of other reviewers, I increased the corn starch to about 1/3 cup mixed with sufficient water to make the slurry and then added to the soup.  I did this at the end, however, after cooking the veggies through.  Super easy, hearty, tasty, and satisfying.  Would definitely make again.

Found my new favourite Beef stew Recipe!!! I use to make the Betty Crocker recipe. But not anymore!!!
The only thing I did different was I cut up leek instead of the onion and threw in a turnip instead of one of the potatoes. I halved the recipe for my family of 2 adults and 4 children age 5 and under.

I used this recipe as a base but I made a few changes (I always do).
I sauteed my onions & celery first in the vegetable oil removed them and set to the side. Then I seasoned and flour the meat n browned n the pan. Then I added the bouillon cubes n water n simmered for a minute till meat looked almost done scraping the bottom of dutch oven pot to get all the flour n goodness. I then placed my baby carrots n potatoes in and placed in the oven and let it cook slow.. The meat was so tender and the gravy was the right thickness.... its a keeper.

I used beef broth and wine, instead of water. I also added beef consummate with lots of garlic. I cooked some of the celery, carrots and onion after browning the meat to season them. Salt, pepper, rosemary, and garlic for each layer. I cooked potatoes separately as I never like the flavor they leave in the stew. This was without a doubt the best stew ever!

I use this recipe as my base... I add garlic, Italian seasoning, red wine, basil, bay leaf & green pepper... finally, I add a ton of frozen mixed vegetables (corn, sweet peas, green beans, carrots, etc).

It's more vegetable soup with beef than beef stew but that's the way I like my beef stew.

I'm rating this 5 stars because it tastes great and is very simple.  We just upscaled this recipe to feed about 125 servings plus added more water and boullion to give us enough extra gravy to stretch further if need be.  It came out great even at that scale and was simple enough to prepare for such a large crowd.  The only thing we had to be careful of as we increased our gravy amount was making sure the saltiness of the boullion cube didn't take over, but we found it didn't in our case.  Our meat was nice and tender but we did cook the stew a lot longer than the recipe due to the extra large pots and the need to get it started early in the day.  Other than that the proportions of ingredients and seasonings and everything else was per the recipe (although we did chop the celery into smaller pieces, about 1/2 inch).  For at home, I might add in some extra veggies of different sorts for a change but I found the seasoning to be really good and we got rave reviews at our event.

The stew was very good.  I made a few changes by doubling the carrots and celery and eliminating the potatoes , we like egg noodles with stew".  I also used two quart containers of beef stock instead of bouillon cubes and added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  Next time I'll leave out or decrease the Rosemary. Some one said gravy was too thin, well I thicken it till it is what we like, all personal choices.
  Thanks for the recipe.

Simple and delicious! I did add a can of corn and a can of green beans at my husband's behest. I never use bouillon cubes, but a beef bouillon paste/base. I also used grass-fed beef stew meat, fresh parsley and organic veggies which, I believe, made it taste better. But, as usual, my husband thinks I'm crazy.

I have made this recipe several times.  I add a little red wine.  However, it's delicious with or without the wine.

Absolutely the best stew I have ever made-and I've made a few (including a yachtsmens stew with sherry.). I floured (flour, salt and pepper)1 lb of round beef cubes before browning.  I sautéed 1 clove of garlic instead of using onion, with beef after it had browned.  I used one package of beef bouillon and then 2 tsp. beef base with added water.  I also flowed someone's advice and added 2 T. Ketchup

I only had 1lb of beef defrosted, so I adjusted the recipe a bit. Coated in flour, garlic powder, parsley, rosemary and pepper to fast fry, then added a little more pepper, rosemary and parsley with 2c broth and 1/2c red wine. After an hour, added in the chopped potatoes, and simmered in low for another 1 1/2 hrs, then added in some frozen mixed veg for the last half hr (no carrots or celery in the house ATM).

Sauteed meat with onions, garlic, spices, Worcestershire sauce (added cumin - sooo much flavor). Used broth, added flour/water to thicken. Added peas/corn at the end. Very good. Also even better when I cooked it in the crock pot. Tried adding tomato paste/crushed tomatoes once, don't recommend that, it's too overpowering.

This was a big hit at our house! I did make the additions as suggested by the most helpful positive review, and I also added more cornstarch to help thicken it up. The whole family--including two very picky kids--thought it was fantastic. Will definitely be making this again.

Turned out amazing! I had never made stew before and it was super easy! Only things I did different was added fresh garlic instead and cooked it with the meat same with the onion and cooked it for less time( didn't have 2 hours to make dinner)

We didn't want the starch of the potatoes, so I cut portabella mushrooms into chunks, satee'd them in butter infused olive oil then added them to the pot 10-15 minutes before done to flavor them but not cook them too much.   Yum!!  And no carbs from the potatoes.

The stew was very good I did add sea salt and Mrs. dash to give it more flavor.  I will probably experiment with other ingredients such as, onion soup mix.

I made the recipe, but cut it in half, enough for 5 servings.  Because I follow recipes literally, I was disappointed, but fortunate enough to have opened the lid after 30 minutes, the 2 cups of water was just about gone and would have burned the meat had I not looked.  You must add more water than the recipe calls for.  then add more beef bouillon for flavor.

This is a great recipe I have changed a few things I didn't use any salt or pepper instead I marinated the beef for two days in montreal steat spice in the fridge of course,I used 3and1/2 cups of water instead of 4  and for my gravy I used 1 and 1/4 tablespoons of cornstarch and intead of water I used beef broth water seemed to lighten the color more than I liked  but that is totally up to you I also added a lot of garlic yum yum

Very easy to follow! Didn't think it would turn out so tasty with the few herbs used. I cut down to 3 1/2 beef cubes (I started with 2 cubes and just added more until I got the taste I wanted) and as mentioned here doubled the amount of cornstarch for a thicker gravy. Great recipe! My definition of a great comfort food. Served it on top of white rice and was delicious.

Delicious. I went for a second helping! I never do that. 
Super salty though. Next time I'll use a low sodium broth.
I followed Chuck Sampson's suggestion on the flour,  garlic and onion powder coating for beef. 
Also made "Dumplings" by Carol from allrecipes.

Great base recipe! I had to add salt at the end, and I had to use a lot more cornstarch for thickening, but it was a delicious meal. I'll make it again, using fresh rosemary and then flour/water to thicken.

Simple, delicious and soul warming. Suggestion - add a a tablespoon of hot sauce for a bit of "zing".

I didn't read reviews before trying it out. I made some of my own modifications based on ingredients at hand and previous stew experience. It turned out to be a very good, likeable stew but didn't leave me raving. I didn't have bouillon so used chicken broth instead, 1/4 cup wine, bay leaves, thyme, Worcestershire sauce. I was intrigued by the lack of browning with flour, but I think next time I will use seasoned flour to brown and deglaze as many people have suggested. Definitely needs garlic and mine needed salt since I wasn't using bouillon.  It's a good base stew recipe to work from I think, easy to follow and easy to modify

We quite liked this as per the recipe with no changes. The next time we make it, however, we will change a few things. Less potatoes, saute the onions with the beef for a bit more flavor, and probably a can of crushed tomatoes, also for flavor.

This stew gets 4 stars based  solely on my personal flavor palette. I felt like the bolder nostalgic flavors of the stew I was looking for weren't there. I added a few things to enhance it after the fact and was quite pleased. This was also my first time making stew though so I am really glad I started with this recipe as it is a great Foundation.

I made this recipe today, they only changes I made were I added everything together and I used my Crock pot. I let it cook on low for 6 hours. My husband and Father in law loved it. I think next time I will make the stew thicker with more water and cornstarch as described in the All Recipes magazine.

This was my second time making beef stew, and this one is pretty darn good. Be careful with the beef cubes as it was pretty salty when i made it to the recipe. I would add different veggies as well, turnip, parsnip, etc. Still a great recipe for beginners.

This recipe was excellent. However, I tweaked it a bit, Latino Style. Instead of potatoes, I used green plantains. I also added Sazon sin achoite to the list of seasonings. Oh, and I sprinkled some kosher salt on the meat. I must add my own flavor to any dish I cook.. And it was delicious!

This recipe was good. The only thing I did differently was tossed my meat and seasonings in flour, then seared them.  I reduced the rosemary, added in extra vegetables and a bit of tomato paste and tomato sauce.  Mmmm, mmm, good and nicely served as a soup with cornbread.

Better than Campbells! ;-) 1/4 c. flour and 2 tsp. Nature's in a bag, added stew meat, coated and then seared in pan with olive oil.  Put in crockpot with water and seasonings, skipped pepper and bouillon (put beef bouillon in last).  Used red potatoes and didn't peel.  Added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  Added cornstarch and water and bouillon the last hour of cooking.

I made this stew today just as it was written. It was "ok" but way to salty for my tastes! I added about 1 1/2 cups more  water to the stew, but it thinned the gravy - I did not mind that too much.  Overall it was a good starter recipe. If I make it again I will add the red wine and see what happens!

Really good. I was craving beef stew but didn't have time for the crock pot.  I think this is better anyway. I made changes Chuck suggested but didn't have wine so used some beer instead. Also used a pack of dry beefy onion soup mix in place of 2 of the boullion cubes.

Made the stew in a pressure cooker.  First brown meat with a little oil and deglaze with 1/2 cup wine.  Replace bullion with 2 cans of beef stock and add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.  Put everything else in pressure cooker except corn starch for 15 minutes and then release pressure slowly. Open top add about 1/2 cup peas and 2 tablespoons of corn starch after mixing with some water to dissolve as a thickening agent. Add salt and pepper to taste and put back on stove top.  Turn on pressure cooker for five more minutes and again slow release pressure. If the meat or veggies should not be done to your liking just increase or decrease cook time by a minute or more. Be sure to have some Italian bread for dipping in the sauce.

I'm willing to admit I might have done something wrong, but I was very disappointed by this recipe.The meat was dry. At least the dog seemed satisfied by it. I will continue my search for a new recipe, or maybe just replace my slow cooker.

Followed the recipe almost as is, except added more seasonings namely garlic powder, onion powder, salt, paprika and extra dried parsley. Had to skip on the rosemary since I didn't have any but it still turned out great. I recommend adding the carrots and potatoes just for the last 40 min so they're not too smushy. Ate it over white basmati rice topped with crushed red pepper. Super satisfying and cooked to perfection! Thank you for a great recipe.

I make this often and love it. More importantly, my husband, 5 year old, and 2 year old do. Accommodating picky toddlers/young children and still making a meal the grown ups will enjoy can get a little tricky. This is my go-to on cold weather days. Thanks, Paula!

Best recipe for beef stew. Very easy. I made this the first time the way it's written.    But. Today  I was out of some  rosemary parsley.    So I  had beefy mushroom soup on hand.       More onions carrots and potatos.     Started on stove for 1hour.   Then finished in oven for 2.  More hours.     Tender  tasty my family loved it.  Will make this again soon.   Thank you   Paula

After reading reviews...I coated the stew meat in the onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper and flour then browned in oil. I added half more of the liquid and added a few tablespoons of browning seasoning. So flavorful.

I haven't tried it yes, but plan to tomorrow, when our Texas weather turns cold.  I was surprised to find a beef stew recipe that did not include canned tomatoes, but I am going to try it, and of course, I will brown my stew meat.

Drenched the stewing beef in flour, pepper, salt before cooking. Then sautéed onions. Little less Rosemary. Wonderful with fresh bread.

My search for THE beef stew has ended. I used this as a basis for the stew I ended up making. I started it with mirepoix (mixture of diced carrots , onions and celery), used beef broth instead. I also browned the meat first. Added bay leaves and half a cup of red wine. I also added canned whole plum tomatoes (not the juice) towards the end.  After it was done and cooled, I let it sit in the fridge overnight to let the flavors deepen. It was great, my 3 year old was mopping up the sauce with bread.

As is the recipe is good.  I usually make a slow cooker beef stew with stout and lots of root veggies.  I prep it the night before and just pop it into the slow cooker in the morning.  Well I forgot and I'd already promised my family beef stew so I tried this one.  The really liked it but said it needed a few things like garlic, a little thyme and of course, the stout.  Because we have a corn allergy and we are also Celiac, I thicken stews with instant potato flakes.  Just a 1/2 cup was perfect for the thickness we were looking for.  Try it.

I didn't have parsley, so I used thyme instead. I found that I needed a lot more cornstarch than the recipe called for. Thanks for the good recipe.

This stew was really good. I did enhance the glamour with onion and garlic powders and tossed it in flour before searing the beef. If using all purpose flour, be cautious with the cornflour. Add some and then more if needed. We enjoyed the stew by itself since it's quite hearty but it would go great with biscuits too!!

The stew wasn't bad, but most definitely too thin as most reviews said...and this is after I tripled the amount of corn starch and mixed the beef with flour prior to cooking! I also added 1/2 cup of wine as per recommendation of many reviews, and I added mushrooms. I would like this stew more if it was thicker and less of a soup.

This recipe is a keeper. I added onion powder, garlic powder and pepper before I seared the meat and added a small glass of wine with the beef stock as a reviewer suggested. The family loved it. I served it with basic biscuits by lenihan5 from this site.

this makes a really good stew! the flavours were fantastic and i can't wait to eat my leftovers tomorrow!
i coated my beef in flour with a little onion and garlic powder and pepper. i added 1/2 a bottle of dark beer to deglaze the pan and then added the water and beef bouillon. i also used 3 T of cornstarch and 3 T of water to thicken the gravy.

Was good but my meat seemed dried out, even though I cooked it for less time than what was suggested.  My 1 year old loved the veggies and "gravy."

Awesome! I made the following changes: halved the recipe. Didn't use celery. Added fresh green beans, a clove of garlic, and a cup of red wine. Didn't have rosemary or beef bullion cubes on hand so used basil and chicken bullion. Had planned on starting to cook early then something came up so I chopped all the veggies and threw them in the micro steamer for about 8-9 min. Then put them in with the beef cubes and cooked for one hour. Turned out so good! I'm sure the meat would have been more tender if I'd had more time but it was still great. Served with homemade red skinned mashed potatoes and yeast rolls. Yum-my!!

I was not a big fan of this recipe - I think it may have been too much onion without other flavors to balance that taste out. I used beef stock instead of bouillon to keep the salt down, and added red wine later in the process (dissolved additional corn starch in wine because it wasn't thick enough for our preference.) I have a slow cooker recipe that my family likes better so we will go back to that.

Great recipe!!!! I like beef stew a little thicker so I added a good amount of cornstarch. Besides that I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.

I tried this with the flour like someone had said in their review.  It worked and was amazing! so thank you also with the left overs I made pies out of it you must get a pie maker if you dont have one.  This dish makes amazing pies and you can also freeze them.  Many thanks everyone for your reviews love this site! keep it up.

Holy yumminess! This was really good. I did take the advice of a few other reviewers. 

Here’s what I did: 
Put 1/4 cup flour in bag along with 1 tsp of garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder & 1/2 tsp pepper.
Put meat in and shook it up. I then seared the meat in a pot then scraped off the bits at the bottom while adding the liquid (I added about ½-1 additional cup of water towards the middle/end of cooking).
You will probably want to add more liquid towards the middle/end of the cooking time, I added about ½-1 additional cup of water. Lastly, I added 1 tbsp ketchup & Worcestershire. So much flavor! 

My husband is a super picky eater and he really enjoyed this stew.

Overall, it was okay, but it felt like there was something extra missing. It wasn't what I was expecting, but then again, I may have been influenced to expect something similar to Korean beef stew.

Great recipe!  Just made a couple minor changes and now have a go to beef stew recipe. YEAH! Added 1 TBLS of tomato paste, 1 TBLS of worcestershire, some Lawry's Season Salt to taste.  Also, because I cut the 2 hour window close, I just threw in a bag of Birds Eye Recipe Ready Stew Blend for Beef Stew (Carrots, Onions, Potatoes & Celery the last half hour.  Made the recipe even easier.

This recipe was great! I just did some things differently. I seasoned my meat with worshire sauce, garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, celery seeds, dried chives, parley, chopped onions and adobo. I let the meat sit for about 3-4 hrs. Then I browned the meat in olive oil, allowed it to make it's own water, place maybe a cup full more, a pinch of dry rosemary, 2 bay leaves and covered. After simmering for an hour I put more onions and a couple of cubed potatoes in. At the last 30 mins I added chopped green and red peppers along with frozen corn, green beans and carrot mix, along with corn starch. It turned out excellent!!!!!!

I made a lot of changes but it was good. No need to cook meat separately for so long, it can cook with the veggies and turns out fine.

This was so easy and great! I did use a cup of red wine. I think this is a very important substitution. I also added a little butter. I couldn't wait for my girl to come home so we could eat it. Great recipe!!!!!

Yummy! Added a few extra veggies (green beans, corn, and peas) and it was fantastic. Our family of 4 ate every last drop!

As written, the recipe is ok and a little bland.  With a few changes I made suggested by other reviewers, I could give it 5 stars. I added 1/2 c red wine, tablespoon each of ketchup and worcetershire sauce, increased veggies, and floured the meat before frying.  Delish!

The overall flavour was good, however the sauce was too thin. I think this is more of a soup rather than a stew. With the beef brouillon it was also a bit too salty.

Yummy!!!!!! This stew came out SO tender. I prefer this over pot roast anytime. I did dunk it in flour/garlic powder/onion powder and pepper mixture first and then browned it and deglazed pan with red wine. Everything else I followed to a T....

I never made beef stew before because...well frankly my mother's beef stew was awful and that is what I judged by.  This stew was so good I can't say enough good about it.  I have six picky eaters at home and every one of them had seconds and nearly licked the bowls.  I took the advice of adding the steak sauce, ketchup and Worcestershire sauce but other than that, followed directions exactly....oh no, I added a touch of half and half right at the end....I already have requests from everyone to make this again very soon.  Thank you!

I like testing recipes without making any changes, and I didn't like this recipe. It didn't thicken up at all and instead of using bouillon you should probably just use beef stock. Also, definitely use more cornstarch. I didn't and it did not thicken up at all. It was very very soupy.

Loved the recipe...easy to make. The only thing my taste buds needed to add was a teaspoon of sage! (My mother always  added a cup of frozen peas to hers--about 15 minutes before it was done for added color, taste and texture.)

This is the best beef stew recipe I have ever had... follow it exactly and make sure you add the fresh rosemary- and be sure to use Angus beef!  It is a broth based stew rather than gravy based. Delicious!

I followed this recipe exactly. What a lovely taste!  Yes, I did need to thicken it by adding more cornstarch but that was it. It tasted great to me. Lots if flavor!  However if you like .0, you can add more pepper or perhaps onion salt or beef broth/bullion.  This stew can be tweaked in many ways to your liking but it is great as written or to use as a stew base and then tailor it to your needs. Good one!

This was VERY easy.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it did not thicken up.  I used 2x the cornstarch and it still was watery.  Next time I make it, I will dredge the meat in flour and sear it first.  Maybe that will help it thicken up better.

Great recipe to tinker with.  I added some red wine like some other reviewers, and substituted peas for celery since I forgot to buy it. We enjoyed it, but I think it needs some garlic and other seasonings to be over the top.  The meat was incredibly tender using this method.

Very tasty and easy!!  I did make a few changes and added garlic instead of rosemary and put in just a pinch of dried parsley. I also added a few bayleaves. I didnt have cornstarch on hand so i used flour instead.  I started with 1Tbsp dissolved in water and gradually added it in.  I did find tht it was too thin for my liking, so i did another Tbsp of flour dissolved in water.  I let it simmer for a few minutes and it was perfect!!

Love reading the comments.  Everyone gives it a 5 star rating and then tells about all the changes.  For starters, we never use bouillon cubes.  I just used water to deglaze the pan and added a shake of Worcestershire sauce.  This turned out just fine.  Actually, this is pretty much the recipe I use for stew all the time, but I mostly make it with lamb.  One can also add parsnips or turnips, if desired.  But potatoes, onions, carrots and celery are required at a minimum.  I would never add garlic to this.  Good with a salad and some fresh baked bread or on noodles.

I have made this a few times now and absolutely love it. 1 hour once veggies are added I found was just not enough, potatoes especially were still crunchy. Best result was putting on in the morning and let simmer a good long while. Also fantastic, if not better, the day after.

Love it!  I did the same as most and used the flour mixture,  added some cloves of garlic while simmering,  also omitted the celery and added portabella mushrooms instead. Added more cornstarch and water, also added ketchup and worcestershire sauce. We had flaky biscuits with it!  Yumm!

Very good recipe, but I did dress it up just a little via some of the reviews. I tossed the meat in 1/4 cup flour with 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon onion powder, and half of the black pepper (1/4 teaspoon); I browned it in 2 tablespoons oil (1 less than the recipe called for) and deglazed the pan with 1/2 cup red wine. I increased the potatoes to 6 medium (I used red ones with skin) and also increased the carrots to 6 medium. I added 2 bay leaves and a dried Japanese red pepper (with half of the seeds removed) along with the other dried herbs. I also increased the cornstarch to 1.5 tablespoons and left the lid off during the last 15 minutes, per the uploader's instructions; the added flour and potato also helped to thicken the final product, as did a little resting time. It turned out very nice and will be a definite repeat.

The BEST beef stew I've eaten! I did lightly flour the beef cubes, and added more cornstarch than the recipe called for. I cooked the 2nd part of the recipe for 1 1/2 hours, since the veggies were still not fully cooked. But, it turned out great and there were no leftovers!

First time making beef stew - very easy and turned out delicious the whole family loved it! I followed the directions except substituted a half cup of red wine instead of water = 3 1/2 cups water & 1/2 cup wine. Also like most of the other recipe notes I had to triple the amount of cornstarch added to make the broth thicker.

I did not care for this. I wish I took the advice of other reviewers and did the flour mixture with the meat.  I didn't do it and my meat had absolutely no flavor.  Too much onion as well.  This recipe needs a lot of adjustments.

The celery and carrots didn't get soft enough the first day (but was better the next day).  Also needed much more cornstarch.  Made for my family of 4 and we all enjoyed.  Will make it again with some adjustments.

This smelled fantastic while it was cooking but I found the herbs to be a bit overpowering after tasting it. It may have also been the brand of bouillon used. I followed the recipe pretty much spot on. I wouldn't completely write it off as it might just need tweaking to suit individual taste, but I probably would not make it again.

Not fair, I embellished on this, and everyone loved it, so I'm sorry to rate it but wanted to add my 2 cents.

Added; McCormick Brown Gravy packet, McMormick Hearty Beef Stew packet,  used Chuck Roast, Season Salt, Meat Tenderizer, Liquid Smoke, A-1 sauce, onion powder, garlic powder, potatoes and veggies.  Put 1/4 C flour, seasoning salt, meat tenderizer, liquid smoke, salt and pepper in bag, shook it up the day before to marinate.  
Next time I'll increase the flour a little bit, although nobody else thought it needed it to be thicker.  I'm 60 and have never made stew before and am glad I did, it's probably the healthiest meal I've made all year and great for a winter meal.

Just finished eating the beef stew and it came out great. The beef was extremely tender. I changed it slightly since I did not have carrots and celery. Instead I added chopped tomatoes and green peppers.. It was just as tasty.

This is an absolutely perfect recipe, and I did not modify it at all, my entire family loved it! Definitely let it simmer as long as possible, the meat was ultra tender and it thickened up a lot leaving the cover off the last 20-25mins or so.

This recipe was very good - and fairly simple - taking only two hours or so... Browning the meat first made a big difference in the flavor, I recommend you don't skip that step.  We personally don't care for rosemary, so I left that out and added a bay leaf instead.  Turned out REALLY good.  Served it with cornbread and a salad on a cold and snowy night... YUM!

My wife's first shot at stew in the twenty years we've been married.   Love it!   She's a great cook but has never made a stew.  Well the weather in Texas got cold long enough for a hearty meal and this did not disappoint.   It was GREAT.  She did add an Au-Jus package and bay leaves.

Good, but a little too thin. Watch the juice level and maybe add some tomato chunks.

This recipe warms the cockles of your heart! I added a about 6 Tbsp. of butter for smooth texture and also 3/4- 1 cup of green peppers for a mildly "hot" flavor.(Not spicy.)-- For a more soup-like quality (if you are not a stew-eater)just add more water and cover and simmer for awhile longer. I seasoned my meat while searing it and then added more seasoning to the water. I added more salt and pepper for stronger flavor and skipped the rosemary. -- Instead of bouillon I used stock. I find chicken stock over beef makes a nice interesting flavor. -- Egg noodles are delicious when boiled in the broth! (I find the medium size noodles hold the beefy flavor more than the larger sizes.) -- If you are averse to celery (I used 2 stalks instead of 4), just know that after boiling they taste like peas. But even if you don't eat them, ADD THEM to the pot! If makes a big difference in flavor.

Followed the recipe exactly. Came out great. I imagine seasoning the meat before browning would step it up a knoch.  
I'm adding dupplings next time... count on that

Yummy! Even my picky 4 year old loved it. The only thing I thought was that it wasn't as thick as I am used to stew being and had to add more cornstarch and a little salt

Easy and excellent! My tweaks were using sage instead of rosemary (only because I didn't have rosemary), adding garlic, adding 2 extra cups of water at the end, plus a packet of beef seasoning mix I had on hand for extra flavor. Insanely delicious!!!! This is now one of my go to recipes.

TASTY!! This recipe is super easy and delicious.  I recommend after cooking the meat, to add all ingredients together and cooking for two + hours.  Even better the next day. I served with some biscuits. Yum Yum!!!

I made this for the first time tonight and my family is currently very quiet, busy eating it.  Definitely follow the suggestions from reviewer Chuck (dredge the stew meat in flour & etc prior to searing).  I also had to add more water when I put the veggies in, and more boullion and seasonings accordingly.  Delicious.

This was a good, classic beef stew. I added some garlic powder with the spices and needed more like a tablespoon of cornstarch to get it to a good thickness. Next time I think I would finely dice the onions and celery and sautee them in the oil ahead of browning the meat to develop some deeper flavor and because I don't like noticing the chunks of onion/celery in my stew. I think the meat could easily simmer for another hour before adding the vegetables if you want it fall-apart tender. As it was, it was just tender enough to cut with a fork but not quite as soft as I like it in stew.

I loved this recipe the only thing i didnt like was the soup was too thin so i just added more cornstarch until it was the consistency i wanted. It has a great taste to it and the texture was great in the beef. It was even better the next day as a reheat.

Fantastic! Farm wife loved it and we did a double batch with a 2 lb roast and a bag of 15 beans. I doubled the recipe and felt there was a bit too much rosemary for my taste. We will go 1.5 teaspoons next batch and add 2 garlic cloves with the meat as it browns.

So simple...even for a newbie to the kitchen like myself.  I did double the cornstarch as I added an extra potato,carrot and celery...I also added a lil extra water (1/2 cup) to compensate.  It is delicious!

This was a good recipe to start with.  Here's what I added:  Used low sodium beef broth in place of bouillion cubes because there is too much sodium in cubes.  I heated the broth and added flour to thicken the gravy.  Also added 2 teaspoons of granulated garlic, and replaced the vegetable oil with extra virgin olive oil.  I also coated stew meat with flour and browned in dutch oven along with onion that I sliced instead of cubes.  I increased meat to 3 lbs and added another potato and three more carrots.  
Thanks for the great recipe.

Made a few changes, but overall the taste was fabulous!  I coated the beef with a flour, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper mixture.  Then browned.  Took beef out and sautéed onions cut into thin rings.  Deglazed the pot with a little red wine and then added the beef back in along with 2 cans of beef broth and a can of water.  This way the onion becomes part of the broth and seasons the meat while cooking.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written, except that I added green beans about 15 min before the stew was finished cooking.  Very tasty with crusty bread!

I'm in the process of learning to cook and this was my first attempt at beef stew.  I couldn't use Rosemary because the store was out, so I used Mrs. Dash as a substitute.  I also increased the servings to 15 as I gave some to my daughter and her husband, and to my neighbors (they are Chin).  Very positive results.  I also added 4 cups of original V-8 during the last 30 minutes, which added a nice flavor.  All was cooked on a slow cooker on high for 3 hours.  I'm playing with the leftovers with an Asian bell pepper and some kind of jalapeno, but Asian.  I'm rather proud of my self.

Used another reviewer's suggestion and added 1/4 cup flour, teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and the beef cubes in a plastic bag and tossed before adding to cast iron pot for browning. This was definitely a keeper. The family loved it.

Nice and easy recipe! However I did make it my own by adding a finely chopped jalapeño and 4-5 cloves of minced garlic with the onion, beef and liquids to make sure I got full flavor. I also added mixed frozen veggies (peas, corn, green beans & carrots) instead if just peas in the end in addition to the fresh potatoes and carrots. I love color in my food, especially greens. My additions were perfect!

Very good, like others I used garlic & onion powder in flour before browning.  Also if you like a thick stew must triple the cornstarch. Never had celery in stew,but turned out good, maybe will add pearl onions next time.  Will keep this recipe.

This was very good, but I have to dock it a star for being way too thin.  I ended up quadrupling the cornstarch slurry for a nice thick and hearty stew.  Also, I deglazed the pan with a splash of red wine after browning the meat, which I seasoned with garlic salt and pepper before cooking.  I also added halved garlic cloves to the veggies.  Will make again with my same changes!

This is a good starter recipe for potato soup. The recipe allows room to adjust for one's tastes. I didn't feel it was a five star recipe as there is definitely room for improvement. But that's not to say the recipe itself wasn't great. It had a good meat to vegetable ratio, but there was a slight lack of flavor with the spices. I'm going to have to play around with different spices to get the flavor I'm looking for, or use other's suggestions and maybe add red wine or something.

This was fine. I used a lot more rosemary, accidentally on purpose -- I used dried and thought there was just a little more than was called for in the jar, so I dumped it all, and in retrospect it looked like a lot more than needed but it tasted fine. The gravy part was also fine. This isn't a highly seasoned stew. I floured before searing, which probably helped thicken the gravy and certainly makes the meat taste better (and the gravy)...and if I had it to do over I'd replace a cup of water with a cup of dark red wine. I probably won't make this one again bc I make stew once a year every year forgetting that my DH doesn't actually like beef stew. Go figure. The baby and I liked it, though, thank you for sharing!

It was good but not great. Although I must admit I am not a huge stew fan to begin with. My wife loved it. It had a bit too much rosemary flavor. So if I make it again, I would use a bit less rosemary and probably add some minced garlic. I was afraid it would be very salty with the 4 bouillon cubes but I didn't find it too salty at all. I also ended up about tripling the amount of corn starch and letting it cook with the lid off for about an additional hour to get it thickened up more.

I just made this and it's DELICIOUS! My family, including a picky 4 year-old, loved it. I followed exactly except I seasoned the meat with 3 cloves fresh garlic, 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper. I also used 1 cup wine and 3 cups water instead of all 4 cups water. I doubled the corn starch but still wish it were thicker. I'll add more later. I also found there wasn't enough gravy so I'll probably add 2 cups more liquid next time. Great recipe!!

Turned out good, although I think it needed more broth.  I had to omit the veggies due to a food allergy, so I added a bit more meat and potatoes.

I make a half recipe of this using 900 ml sodium reduced beef stock, usually Campbells, an equal am't of water, and a teaspoon of Better Than Bouillon. I add turnip and fresh green and yellow beans, if in season. 2 bay leaves go in with the stock.  After the browned meat simmers for 2 hours, I add the turnip first, and add each vegetable singly, a bit later, depending on the cooking time req'd for each veg. I thicken with a thick flour and water mix just before serving, blending the stock with a elec hand blender, grinding up some potato and carrot in the process. I'll try adding rosemary next batch.

This was a very good base recipe. I just added a few more things to it.  First of all, I had no white potatoes, so I added sweet potatoes which were white inside, (I don't know what kind they were).  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a couple bay leaves and some frozen green beans. I first put the beef in a mixture of flour, salt and pepper, shook it in a plastic bag and then browned it in the oil. The rest I followed from the recipe. This was SO good!  My husband who loves his white potatoes liked the way this came out.  Yum!

Great recipe for cold rainy days like today!! Im not to much of a stew kinda gal but this recipe is great. I tossed my beef with seasonings and flour before browning doing so resulted in a thick sauce so i did not need the cornstarch. I thank chuck in the reviews for the great idea. I also used "better than bullion" rather than powered bullion or cubes. Super good flavor. I rate this recipe a 4 star(:. My wife still had to taste it... I guess that's the true test to a true stew lover!

Excellent stew. I looked at reviews and I also browned the beef in a flour and pepper spice mixture to begin with. Also added worcestershire sauce, BBQ sauce, extra garlic powder and bay leaves. Finally added parsnip and turnip as my husband doesn't think a stew is as stew without those ingredients. Made dumplings to go on top, and it was even better than my mother-in-law's stew :).

Excellent!  I subbed basil for the rosemary as my husband doesn't like rosemary, and added fresh mushrooms.  I also added an extra 2 cups water and 2 bouillion cubes and doubled the cornstarch because we like a lot of gravy.  Served with big loaf of crusty bread.  We all burned our mouths because we couldn't stop eating it after we tasted it! Will be a winter staple for sure :)

Very delicious! I seasoned the meat before I browned it. I also added a little bit of worcestershire and A-1 sauce. I used Knorrs beef bullion and those cubes are twice the size so you only need 2. Tonight for leftovers we'll eat it over rice!

My first time to use my new Dutch Oven.  I was VERY happy with this recipe.  I did shake the meat in a bag with flour and seasonings as another person did and I did add 1/2 cup red wine to the water.   I will definitely make this again.  My family loved it!

First time I made this and I was very pleased with the results. I made half the recipe because I only had one pound of stew beef on hand. The only changes I made were to use olive oil and un-peeled red potatoes. I also added a quarter cup of red wine with the 2 cups of beef bouillon. It was easy and tasty.

I second tossing the beef cubes with some flour and then browning. This negated the need for the cornstarch (tastes not so good anyways) while still having a lovely, not runny at all, gravy. I also highly recommend adding a couple bay leaves with the other seasonings. We love adding other root veg as well, specifically cubed turnip or rutabaga. Yummmm!

The only thing I changed was add some flour to it to thicken it up. My kids said it reminded them of pot roast with vegetables. Delicious! I will definitely make it again.

The absolutely best stew I have ever made...so delicious and flavourful!  The stew beef practically melts in your mouth it is so tender!  The only addition I made was quadrupling the cornstarch/water mixture.  Other than that, FANTASTIC!!

Super easy recipe and the family loved it. I used fresh rosemary since I have it in my backyard but that is the only substitution.

So, I basically used this one for some of the spices, but it was really good. This was a stew from a previous meals roast and veggies. I added some homemade veggie and meat stock, salt and pepper, chopped up some celery (about 2-3 stalks) and some parsley and let it cook most of the afternoon. With some Sourdough Drop Tea Biscuits from this site, this was a most satisfying meal.

Love this recipe because it is sooooo easy. Although I made a few adjustments. I decided I wanted to make it a little spicy so I added two serrano peppers, which I partially regret cause now it is almost too spicy, so I'll probably just add 1 next time. Also, instead of parsley I used cilantro and since I didn't have cornstarch I used 4 teaspoons of flour with 4 teaspoons of water instead. Overall, great reciple, very easy and the outcome makes you want to make it again and again.

Just finished eating this stew. Knowing others thought it was too thin, I added twice as much cornstarch and it was still very thin and bland.  So, I squirted in some ketchup and some Worcestershire and salt (we eat low salt but this needed it).  To thicken it I put in two packets of turkey gravy powder with the smallest amount of water possible. That thickened it and it tasted really pretty good. I'll make it again but take more advice from these ratings first. A good base.

Great recipe.  Did make a few changes.  As others did, I tossed the beef cubes in flour before browning in pan.  I used fresh rosemary because I had it on hand.  I also added 2 T tomato paste for flavor and thickening.  I added about 2 t worcestershire sauce.  I also added 1 clove garlic and 1 minced shallot as well as 1 T Italian seasoning to add flavor.  The recipe alone sounded too bland to me, but with these additions it was delicious.  Giving it a 5 because the main concept of this dish works really well.  At last 1/2 hour, I decided to add 1/2 cup each frozen peas and corn to add some color.  I cooked this on the stovetop, then kept it warm in a 250 F oven for about another hour which seemed to be perfect as I don't know that the original 2 hour cooking time was quite enough.

This was really delicious!  I added 1/2 cup of red wine and it gave it such an incredible flavor.  My potatoes weren't done after one hour, so I popped my dutch oven in the oven to finish it off.  I think next time I will put the potatoes in for the whole 2 hours, or put them in much earlier.

Absolutely incredible!  I placed the beef cubes in a mixture of flour, granulated garlic, onion powder and a little bit of celery salt and then browned it in oil over medium high heat.  The use of the flour eliminated the need for the corn starch.  My only other change was to use fresh rosemary instead of dried.  Incredible flavor!  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good! I was very skeptical about it but it turned out way better than I expected! GREAT RECIPE WILL MAKE AGAIN! Followed exact except I had no rosemary or parsley so I seasoned the meat with Johnny's Salt and added pepper and a pinch of salt at the end and it turned out perfect :)

This is a great receipe my entire family enjoys, and I have some picky eaters.  Although we left out the onions and celery and substituted with a little fresh garlic instead, the flavor was still wonderful and the aroma filled the house.  Its a great dinner for those cold winter nights.  Thanks

I had some deer meat in the freezer so I substituted it for the beef and it was fall apart tender and went so well with the flavours in this recipe!  I also added a turnip for some extra goodness and served it over homemade biscuits - delicious!

This stew came out just right for a rainy nights dinner. The meat and veggies were tender and flavorful. I used a little onion powder, garlic salt, and steak seasoning when cooking the meat, and it was just right. Served with warm bread.

This is a delicious stew that can be adjusted any way you like.  I add some more seasonings (sage, thyme, garlic, onion salt) and a little more corn starch to thicken it a bit.  I make Johnny's Biscuits from this website to go with it... sooo good!

Tasty stew!!!Took the advice of a few other reviews and coated beef with flour, roasted garlic powder, onion powder and pepper . Others  mentioned it was a wee bit soupy so i threw in a bit of the flour mix used to coat the meat with the broth. Also used a spice grinder on the rosemary (wife can't stand chewing on "bark") .Dumplings are the cherry on top ..:))))

Absolutely, hands down best basic stew I've tried, and I know my comfort food - as both my wife and tailor will confirm.  After several tries and reading the reviews I've added only minor changes more for my taste, like adding the pepper and 3 cloves of garlic as the meat is searing, then adding Worcester (2 tbs),a splurch of ketchup (empirical term), and a teaspoon of Oregano while the meat simmers in the sauce.  I've also added large chunk mushrooms, quickly pan seared on high heat, and added 30 minutes after the other vegetables (depends on my mood).  Well Done Paula - Bravo

Great Recipe! I did make a few slight changes, seasoned and floured the beef before browning as others have suggested, and de-glazed with some red wine. Added 2 cans beef broth, 2 beef bullion cubes. Added thyme and a bay leaf in addition to the rosemary. Added extra potatoes and carrots, cut the celery to 2 stalks. Added some frozen peas and green beans at the end, it was a hit with everyone.

Oh my GOSH. This was such a great recipe! I substituted one Bouillon for a half of a pack of french onion soup. I also cute an onion into petals and put those in. It was silent at the table except for the many "MMmmmms," from everyone. :)

Really good beef stew!!! I coated my stew meat in flour/garlic powder/onion powder/pepper before browning. Soup was thick and filling. Will make again soon!

The best soup I ever made.  The meat just melts in your mouth.  I was a little disappointed at the thickness.  The flavor was delicious!

I followed other recommendations and added more celery, potatoes, used pearl onions (a favorite of mine) and carrots. I also added more corn starch. (probably about 5 times more to start with and then some at the last 30minutes because I noticed my stew was not as thick as I wanted. I cooked it a on low for an additional 30-45 minutes because my potatoes and carrots were still hard. I think next time I will add worcestershire sauce. But very good beef stew...I just wanted alittle more kick/spice.

Great!!  I wanted thicker gravy so I tripled the corn starch and water and followed the suggestions to flour the meat with 1/2 Cup flour, 1T garlic powder and the pepper, brown it and then add everything else including 1/2 cup red wine.  I also added another suggestion of 1T Ketchup, 1T Worcestershire Sauce and 1T A1 Steak sauce.  I cooked it a day ahead of time and it was YUMMY!!  This was all based on reading lots of the reviews and pulling out what everyone kept repeating.  Serve it with a crusty bread or biscuits to sop up all the gravy.

I rated on the mobile app but wanted to comment. Delish!! I halved the recipe since I was cooking for 2. I also coated the stew meat with 1/4 cup flour, garlic powder and Costco Organic No Salt Seasoning and mixed it in a gallon baggie. I had extra flour when I poured the meat into the pan and it ended up being the perfect amount to thicken without adding more than the amount of cornstarch that was called for! I did add about 1/4 carton of veggie stock when I added the veggies as the liquid seemed a bit low. I used extra carrot and red potatoes (no celery, my bf doesnt like) and the veggies were cooked perfectly. Served with french bread for a perfect meal!

This stew was too salty the first time I made it, but the flavor otherwise was good and the meat was perfectly tender.

I had never made beef stew before and utilized this recipe for the base.  I am guilty however, and added other things to the recipe as others had suggested.  It turned out awesome!  The meat was tender and so were the veggies.

My first pot of homemade Beef Stew and it was a hit.  I used the ideas of shaking the cubed steak in flour and seasonings prior to cooking and adding more liquid (red wine) after adding the vegetables.  I will make this again!

This is the best stew recipe ever. I bought all the vegetables from the farmers market, threw in some fresh green beans, and added fresh corn on the cob into the mix. I used sirloin and tenderized the meat just to make sure. I have made it 3 times and it has never failed.

I give it 5 stars although I had to tweak it a little to get it to 5 stars. I think even with out the changes, it still would be delicious. I followed other reviews and added (red wine, tomato paste, etc.). The only change the recipe as written definitely needs is more vegetables. I added an extra carrot and used 6 yellow potatoes. Whether you make the other additions or not, you need to add more vegetables.

I am in the process of making this. I asked my husband to taste it for seasoning. He had this odd look on his face, then he told me it was great! He said he'd never had a stew that tasted like this one. He loves it! So do I. Before I put the meat in I did toss it in seasoned flour and seared. Since I did this I didn't need to add the cornstarch for thickening. I also used some white wine to get all the num-nums off the bottom of the pan I used to sear the meat. I sure will make this again!

I loved it. When I made it, I didn't have enough beef. My own fault, I only bought 1 lb... will remember more beef next time! I also substituted vegetable oil with olive oil, it's what I had at home. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Someone mentioned that using russet potatoes will dissolve the longer you cook so I used white potatoes. I felt that the sauce was thin so I will add more cornstarch next time. I also didn't remove enough outter layers of the onion so some onion bits in there was tough. Next time, I think I will add some wine, too.

Excellent stew.  I added 1/2 cup of red wine in addition to the liquid called for in the recipe as well as tripling the cornstarch/water mixture.  Easy recipe with lots of flavor.

Excellent "classic" beef stew! Not too much going on that distracts from the tastes of the meat and veggies. Minor adjustments based on others' suggestions: coated beef with seasoned flour prior to browning, added an extra carrot and potato, used fresh rosemary (but did not increase amt), and tripled cornstarch amt. I added a tsp each of Worcester sauce, A1 and ketchup, but I'll start with 1/2 tsp each next time and add more to taste. It was a little overpowering. I also added a little extra beef broth when adding the veggies. This is my new go-to beef stew recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  I added red whine, garlic, 3 times the cornstarch and used beef base instead of bouillon for a richer flavor.  I also added one TBS of worchestershire and a TBS of tomato paste.  The flavor was so rich and the beef was incredibly tender.  This was perfect with baking powder biscuits.

i used the recipe as it is and it was a HIT!!  TYVM for sharing!  My hubby n I enjoyed it tremedously!  As we love veggies, we put in more celery and we also omit the salt as the beef cube we used was already flavorful enough!

This stew is excellent and very easy to make.  I doubled the vegetables, except for the potatos and I sweated the onions, celery and carrots with three chopped cloves of garlic together before I added them to the pot. I also added one fresh sprig of fresh rosemary instead of dried and three Tb of fresh flat leaf parsley.  I added two more cups of water to account for the extra vegetables.  I let the stew sit after the second hour of cooking with the lid on and heat off and it thickened up nicely. Whatever you do, don't add any salt, the bouillon gives it plenty. The family loved it, I will be making this again.  This would be perfect to take to a pot luck.

This is really good! I couldn't get my beef bouillon to crumble as it was hard as a rock, so I just added it to the water and stirred until it dissolved. I seasoned the meat with garlic, onion powder, and black pepper before browning it. I also added a tablespoon each of A-1 sauce and Worcestershire sauce. I thought the stew actually tasted a lot like Sirloin Burger Chunky soup. I do think it would've turned out better if I'd used red wine instead of water, as other reviewers did, and if I'd added some more spices, maybe a little more salt. And I think next time I'll add another cup of water and another bouillon cube - I think I'd like it a little more soupy.

This was excellent and so easy. I made a 5 serving version. I used 2 large red potatoes. I just felt it needed an extra carrot and celery stalk. I also did triple the thickener as someone else suggested. In a bag I put 1/8 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Put the stew meat in, and shook it up.   I added a tsp of salt since I used low sodium broth.  Since the serving size was lower I only needed 45 mins on the first simmer and about 40 mins for the vegetables. The meat was very tender.

Very good.  I coated beef in flour, browned it, and then cooked it in my pressure cooker. sooooo tenderizing.  I also used beef base, which is a paste, and adds more beef flavor.  Always thicken with flour.

I am “new” to cooking, so I am not the best, but my fiancé LOVED this beef stew.   It's a super easy recipe to follow (I did not alter) and very tasty.  It was a good feeling to see him help himself to a second bowl.  Some of the other reviews mentioned the bouillon cubes being too salty.  I would agree that you could definitely taste the salt, but I prefer my meals to be seasoned rather than me having to add after the cooking process.  I find the beef stock to be too bland.  It's all about preference.

Very easy and tasty! I did mine in the crock pot with elk tenderloin. I prefer mine a little thicker, like a gravy consistency and I also added more salt. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Very good beef stew.  I did brown my meat with flour, garlic powder and onion powder as suggested and then followed the recipe as noted.  There was no need to thicken with corn starch.  Family raved about this recipe.  Thanks for posting Paula!

This recipe was great!!!!  I did use double the water, 4 cups of water didn't seem enough to feed my whole family.  So, I did increase the spices as well.  I followed another reviewers advice, and shook the beef in a bag with flour and spices, before browning. I also used some ketchup and worstershire sacue as well as a can of tomato paste to thicken up to my liking.   Perfect for a cold winter night! Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

This stew is sooo good!  I used venison stew meat and only made a half batch.  I made it on a snowed in day here in New England so I didn't have any celery or rosemary.  I also used a can of condensed beef broth instead of the bouillon.  It was still amazing.  I followed another review and coated the meat with flour, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper before browning it.  It was so flavorful!  Pair it with Baking Powder Biscuits and it is the perfect winter meal. This will be my new go-to venison stew recipe!

This was amazing!  I used a shoulder steak because I don't like the grocery store pkgs of "stew beef".  The meat was so tender and the potatoes and veggies cooked perfectly.   The seasonings were beautifully simple, wonderful flavor.  I used low sodium beef broth instead of bouillion cubes.   This will be part of my winter rotation.  I cannot wait to make this for my Dad.  :)

Good stew, and made it into a crock pot dish.  Ommitted the oil, and used about 1/2 tsp of celery seed since I didn't have any fresh celery.  Also used 2 packets of Washington's Rich Broth in place of the bouillon because its already in a crumbled form. (Will up this the next time, because it wasn't salty enough for my taste)  What I did do though was mix all my spices and some flour in a ziplock bag, then shook the beef cubes a little at a time in the mix, browned them and then put them in the crock pot.  One of the cups of water I put in the pot after I was done browning the beef and got all the trimmings mixed with the water to add to the stew.  Put it on low for 8 hours and it was ready for dinner when the family got home from work.

Great recipe. However, more cornstarch is necessary and the meat should be browned with some seasoning on it.

This stew was easy to make and delicious. The only downside I felt was that it was a bit salty, but I am in Sweden and using Swedish beef bouillon, so that may have affected it. Perhaps the lesson is to stay conservative on the bouillon and taste it. Otherwise, delicious!

This stew was great! It passed the ultimate test- my picky husband. I did let it cook longer during the second half- only because I had to be out of the house for awhile. I did take the other people's advice- I put the stew meat in a bag with flour, garlic powder, and onion powder and coated it before browning. I also doubled the cornstarch. It was yummy!

I loved this stew, I did sweat the onions and blended them down as my family doesn't like the onion bits, I also did add 1tbl each of A-1, Worchtershire and Ketchup, and a half cup of port wine. I also added a tablespoon of crushed garlic. I will say that there were no leftovers! Yumm

I made it the first time following Chuck's review suggestions and it came out Wonderful. Second time I made it following another review that says to substitute beef bouillon with beef stock and it came out not so good with hardly any flavor.

Delicous! I made this recipe exactly as it says, with only 1 change - I tripled the amount of cornstarch to make it a bit thicker. A definite new family recipe!

I think this is a great base recipe.  Then you add your own personality to it.  I also added extra carrot and potatoe.  I had some fresh corn that I cut off the cob and tossed in there.  I had a little left over tomatoe juice and it landed in there.  I used beef broth and bullion.  Threw a few drops of Texas Pete in there too.  TURNED OUT GREAT!!  Just because us cooks show our own personality when we cook the original poster should not get stars taken away.  I live in the South and those that live in S. California would have much different taste buds then mine!!

So awesome!  I "beefed" up the main ingredient adding more meat, potato and veggies.  I also replaced half of the black pepper with cayanne and added a dash montreal steak and worcheshire.  A family favorite!

This is our absolutely favorite stew recipe.  We love it SO much.  I have made it three times now.  My husband loves it, and we won't venture out into any other stew ventures, ever.  I never would have thought to put rosemary and parsley in a stew, but MAN!  Does it make a difference.  It makes it deliciously hearty.  LOVE LOVE Love!  absolutely wonderful.  Woo-Hoo!

This was pure comfort food on a rainy fall evening. The only changes i made was substituted some wine instead of water, low sodium beef broth instead of bouillon, and used about 5x the amount of cornstarch to make it thicker. My boyfriend loved it and said it tasted just like his mom's.

From an beginner cook but experienced at dining out, it tastes like you know what you're doing - fancy, hearty, satisfying - make as is but with more cornstarch.

This was yummy!  I did not have dried parsley, so I used a little oregano and thyme instead; the rosemary flavor was great.  I also tossed the meat in some flour and garlic powder, and I deglazed with about 1/2 cup of red wine.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of worcestershire sauce.

It is a good beef stew but lacks flavor. Try Chucks review ideas, with this it is much better.

Wow! I was impressed. This is a keeper. I put this in the crock pot in the morning and let it cook all day. The meat was sooo tender and it was so tasty! I did add a can of diced tomatoes after reading some of the reviews. This was very good.

Now this is a great stew base. I did change a few things though. I did use about 1/2 cup of Merlot to deglaze the pan, and I did use 4 cups of low sodium beef broth, and also a can of diced tomatoes. At the end I did add "Better than Bouillon" to taste and it turned out great.

This is the BEST beef stew I have ever had.  I made  a few changes after reading other reviews:dredge beef in flour, mont. steak seasoning, and onion powder.  Add bay leaves, garlic, 1tb steak sauce, 1 TB worch sauce, 2TB catsup.   add 1/2 C red wine, use beef broth instead of boullion.  6 TB cornstarch/water.  Came out great.

This was SO good!!  I don't cook very much at all and I managed to impress my husband with this. I made a couple of changes: I coated the beef chunks in a mixture of flour, salt, pepper and garlic seasoning before browning.  Also, I used beef stock instead of bouillon and water.  Because I was short on time I cooked the veggies for about 6 minutes before adding them to the pot and only cooked for 45 minutes instead of an hour.  Last, I used sweet potatoes (it was all I had), and 4 tsp of cornstarch to make it nice and thick!  It was really delicious and hearty.

Very good recipe, but I changed some things.  I used 1lb of meat, which I doused with flour and pepper and browned in the pan.  I substituted 1 can beef broth for the bouillon, plus 1/2 cup water.  I also used 2-3 times as much cornstarch to make the broth thicker.  In the last 10 minutes of cooking I added a cup of frozen peas.  Served with buttermilk cornbread.  Delicious!  Will definitely make this again.

This was a very tasty stew recipe.  I made a few changes however.  I dredged the beef in flour seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and cumin. I used 3 cans of  low sodium beef broth in place of the water.  Even after making these changes my husband thought it was a little bland, so we added some salt which seemed to help quite a bit.  The beef was very tender and flavorful.  I would probably make this again.

wow!!! So good! Great for a cold day!! The only things I did differently was adding in some corn cobbs and some cabbage...I only let the broth simmer for about 30 mins, then added in the potatos and carrots for about 20 mins, then combined all the meat. Great recipe! Will make again!

Simple and delicious.  I used and extra cup of water and an extra bouillon cube (we like a little extra gravy).  Substituted fresh rosemary and omitted the celery.

Stewtastic!  I used 5 cups broth, browned the meat after coating with flour, garlic, and pepper, substituted brussels sprouts instead of celery, and used 3 times the recommended corn starch, next time I'll also add frozen corn.  I really didn't think the meat would come out as tender as it did. Easy-peasy.

Awesome! Excellent recipe. As an aside, I did roll in flour with onion and garlic, added a little more liquid and cookd for a little bit longer but I essentially followed the recipe and it worked out well.

Great Stew, can't cook enough of it, gone in just one day! :)
I changed the recipe and put it in a slow cooker on low instead and I omitted the veg oil, 2 tsp of cornstarch and 2 tsp of water.

This was a very good stew. I didn't have any corn starch so I added a bit of flour instead (about 1/4 cup). Still tasted great!

This was soooo good, but I can't rate it a 5, because I don't think it would have been nearly as tasty without following the suggestions of the #1 reviewer here, "Chuck".  I made this recipe based on his review... the only thing I would change is to cut the ketchup, A-1 and worcestershire sauce by half, as it was too strong with a whole TBSP of each

Only gave four stars as written..however it could be five stars if the following modifications are made...a) use 2 cups water and 2 cups red wine instead of 4 cups water, b) add some garlic powder to the stew meat when browing and c) I ended up using 4-5 TABLEspoons of cornstarch so that I could get a thicker gravy, otherwise its more like soup. All that aside the flavors are wonderful and dont need much modification! Perfect for a cold night with some crusty french bread!

Great recipe!  I always add a package of brown gravy mix to the cold water before I cook it in the crock pot.  Makes a wonderful gravy.  My children love it over mashed potatoes!

Good base recipe but I had to add a ton of additional spices to give it more flavor. I added 1/2 cup red wine in place of 1/2 cup water, about 7 cloves of garlic, pepper, salt, garlic powder, tyme and a little cajun seasoning. I  had to triple the amount of cornstarch to get it to the right texture.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Very satisfying and delicious.  The rosemary gave this recipe a surprising twist.  Next time I will use only half as much as suggested.  I dredged my beef tips in 1/3 cup flour that was seasoned to taste with onion and garlic powder, garlic pepper, Montreal steak seasoning, and dried parsley. I used 1/2 cup of Merlot wine to deglaze the pot after the meat browned in the oil. I added 6 cups of water that had been mixed with 8 beef bouillon cubes.  It wasn't too much as it cooked off while it simmered for 2hrs.  I only had 1.2lbs of beef stew meat so subbed more veggies but the meat was so tender and delicious that I'll be sure to have more for the next time.  I used half white and half red onion which gave a nice color and flavor.  To thicken I used 2tbs of corn starch with 2 tbs of water...heated the pot to a boil, added the cornstarch mixture and stirred regularly for 2 minutes before returning to a simmer.  It thickened nicely for me.  Made this for my father and boyfriend. My father said it was on his top 5 all time dinners. I'll keep playing with this excellent base until we get it just right.  Thanks for the recipe! Served with crusty french bread that was divine in with the juices!

My husband and daughter both said this was 5 stars (I don't eat meat, so I'll go by their reviews.) The only changes I made were to use about 1/4 cup of sherry to deglaze the pan after browning the flour coated beef cubes, reduced the water to 3 1/2 cups, and added 1 tbsp of cornstarch mixed in 1 tbsp of cold water. The stew still looked pretty runny compared to my usual stew, but nobody seemed to mind. Thanks!

I haven't even ate this yet and I know it deserves five stars, due to the fact that I can't stop taking quick slurps of the delicious broth.  I made a few changes:  used beef broth instead, coated the meat in flour, onion powder, garlic powder and pepper, and added a tsp of worcestershire sauce and ketchup.  This is delicious.  Meat is perfectly tender.  Enjoy....

I'm not really sure how to rate this recipe as I did make some changes. I'm rating this recipe based on the changes that others suggested. Firstly, for the water, i boiled some cow bones for the broth that i had. Added deliscious flavor rather than using the store bought stuff. I also added red wine, ketchup, A1 and Worcheshire sauce. I made one more personal adjustment by adding some fresh rosemary as well. I also added extra cornstarch as i like my stew reallt thick too. With all these adjustments this stew is the best stew i've ever had!!

This recipe was amazing!! I took the tips from other reviewers to coat the beef in floor, granulated garlic, onion powder and pepper. Plus I added a tablespoon of worcestershire when I added the vegetables. Fantastic!!

This was so good! I didn't change much.  All I did was season the meat with salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder. Then I marinated it in vinegar, sealed it and let it sit in the fridge for an hour before cooking. After adding the water and bouillon, I added diced tomatoes,   two tablespoons of worcheshire sauce and a few drops of soy sauce.   After that I followed the recipe step by step. It was a hit! Perfect for a rainy evening. My step mom who is the cook in the house gave it an "A"! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Awesome recipe!  Like others I used beef broth instead of the cubes.  I also used red wine instead of water.  I also like my stew thicker and used a lot more corn starch than called for.  I mixed the corn starch right into the beef broth, again instead of adding water.  I found it a little bland so I added some sage and a bunch of extra salt and pepper.    Thanks for a great recipe!

Probably one of the easiest and tastiest stews around. I floured and seasoned the beef prior to browning and added 1/2 cup of cooking wine to deglaze. During the first simmer process, I added 1 tbsp worchestire and 2 tbsp of ketchup. In addition to the recipe veggies, I also included a can of corn and 2 additional each of celery and carrots. The beef was tender at around 1 hour 45 minutes. The cornstarch was exactly right at the suggested amount in the recipe. Thank you for a great dish!

Made this stew last night and it turned out really well. However, I did make some of the previous suggestions made by previous reviewers. For starters I took a gallon bag and poured flour/salt/pepper into it then tossed in the 2 pounds of stew meat and shook it around until every piece was evenly covered. Next up I added 1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce along with 2 bay leaves after adding the water and other seasonings. Lastly I added 3 times the amount of cornstarch to thicken the stew to a consistency that I preferred more. Thats it, otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely. Made it for my fiance and her family and they all loved it. Going to double up on the amount next time I make as this went FAST!

Very good stew! The only change that I made was that I added a little more cornstarch than was suggested, just because I like my stew to be on the thicker side.  I was so yummy, and seemed to disappear quickly! Thanks for the great recipe.

Fantastic meal.  I seasoned the stew meat with salt and pepper, coated with flour prior to cooking. Added Worcestershire, ketchup, and a bit more potatoes to the mix.  Entire family loved it.  Definitely will make again.

This was great and pretty quick. I added some freshly minced garlic and put the onion and garlic in the first simmer round. I did add some salt and more pepper at the end because it was a tad bland (did not use cubes but used the boulion powder) I also halved the recipe and added one more additional cup of water with boullion and more celery, carrot, and potato. My 2 year old loved it. I froze some in bowls and then transfered to plastic freezer bags for later use and refrigerated some for leftovers.

I followed the recipe with the addition of browning the meat after flouring and seasoning it. The flour and oil drippings make for a nice base to this stew. Me and the man really enjoyed it, the kids not so much.

I gave it five stars. But then I have been making my stew like this for years. Only difference is I use beef broth and not bullion. My husband is allergic to the MSG in bullion. I also use corn instead of onions and celery. My husband is allergic to onions and doesn't like celery. I usually don't use rosemary but since the recipe added it I figured I would try it out. It was good. I crush the rosemary before using it. We like it better that way. I also added more cornstarch as I like a little thicker stew. I would add this to my recipe box but since I already make it like this I don't see a reason to. Thank you

I made this for my husband, and he said it's his favorite of anything I've made him. I halved the recipe but followed the same cooking times, and it came out great. I added 1 T of Worcestershire, A-1 steak sauce, and ketchup (which a commenter suggested), but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't taste it, so it's very helpful that the recipe works without adjustments.

I absolutely love beef stew and this wasn't all that great.  Kinda bland and not as hearty and "stewy" as I like. And I even added wine, tomatoes, and extra spices. Sigh. I'll keep searching for the perfect beef stew recipe.

Best beef stew I've made!  I doubled the meat, tripled the corn starch and added a handful of grated parmesan cheese at the end.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was SO easy to make and tasted delicious!!  I accidentally doubled the beef boulion because I didn't read that my package was 'extra large' cubes...but it worked out alright in the end because I needed to add water as it simmered down (a little more simmering and it would make a GREAT potpie filling!)

So tasty! My friend who came over for my first attempt at it took the recipe home with her that night!!

This was just great! I served it with French bread on the side. I always season my meat before I cook a soup or stew because it adds the extra flavor - so if you don't follow other reviewers and do the flour mixture. I used fresh parsley and crushed the rosemary because I didn't like the fact that it looks like pine needles.I used three cans of beef broth instead of the cubes I also used canned potatoes and carrots and poured their juices over into the pot I did use fresh celery and onion. Everything boiled down niceley and I tripled the cornstarch. Once again this was great!!!

this is a great recipe!  i had to add more water and more corn starch than the recipe called for, and i also dipped the meat in flour/garlic powder mixture before putting it in the pan. other than that, this recipe is pretty simple and is delicious.

This stew was just perfect! I made a few changes. I used fresh chopped parsley instead of dried. I also added the liquid and spices to the crock-pot. Then added browned meat, and all the veggies and gave it a good stir. I cooked it high for 45 minutes, then on low for 2 hours. Will make this again and again!

This was delish!  I substituted 1/2 the water with beef broth, and threw in about 1/2 frozen/thawed peas about 15 minutes before we were ready to eat.  My family thought that it was the best beef stew that I had ever made.  The left-overs were a hit, too!  I'll definitely make again.  The meat was sooooo  tender!!  All of this time, I thought that the slow cooker was the only way to go.  This recipe blew the slow cooker away!  Anxiosly awaiting the next chilly day!

This was pretty good. I had to keep adding water though because it would simmer out. By the time we ate it, it was pretty salty so next time I will cut back on the boulion.  I also used leftoever roast that I shredded instead of stewing meat. Overall it was good. Will use again.

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe pretty much.  Added a little more corn starch to thicken and a bay leaf.  Also, sauted the onions with the beef while browning.  Dip some garlic bread in the juice.  You will love it. Enjoy!

This was flavorful and delicious! I made the additions that Chuck suggested. Flouring and seasoning the beef first and later adding the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce with the liquids.  The only other change I made is a couple of bay leaves. My favorite bite is the very last with all the broth, pieces of veggies and flavorful goodness!

Very tasty and easy to make.  I just made one change; instead of using bouillon cubes and water, I used 4 cups of low-sodium beef broth. Still worked!

I am culinarliy challenged but wanted to try some new recipes for my family. This recipe was great!!! I did not use the bullion cubes though I used an organic beef broth.( less saltier) I also took other users advice and rolled my beef in flour and garlic powder. Also I added frozen broccoli to the stew in the last 20 minutes. For a thicker stew I used 5 tsps of cornstarch and water. Will definitely make again.

my kids love this stew so much, i've been making it several times. The only modification i make is that i dont use oil,i just put a little bit of water to cook it since the beef has oil on its own already.

This is a great and easy to make recipe, my husband LOVED it! It didn't make as much as I had hoped so I doubled the recipe and tripled the amount of cornstarch because we like our stew thicker than it was with the amount called for. Other than that, we just omitted the onions and loved it!

Since I made a couple of changes I rated the actual recipe a 4.

I did not have beef boullion so I used a can of beef broth (that's all I had) and then added a package of onion soup mix and 1-1/2 cups water.  

My family really enjoyed this one which surprised me because they are used to eating Hawaiian style stew which uses a tomato base with some added ginger.

The next time I'll try the recipe as printed.

Very, very good!  I used 3.25 C beef stock and 0.75 C red wine instead of the water/bullion combination. I, like many others, used extra cornstarch.  I will absolutely make it again

This stew was good, nothing special. I added corn and extra onions.

This stew was extremely good.  I did saute some shallots in with the meat when I browned it, and added some garlic salt to the flour before browning the meat.  I also added a cubed turnip for extra contrast.  The flavors really are spectacular.

this was a great starter for me. stuck almost to the recipe. i didn't have cubes so i used the granules instead. also ended up using more water as i added more veggies,( love those little devils). used olive oil for a little healthier stew. i also coated the meat in a flour and Montreal steak seasoning mixture before cooking.other wise was a great stew, and as it was raining and extremely windy last night a great warm meal for the night.

I am not a stew person so this review is from my husband and brother. They both thought it was good and that the veggies were cooked to perfection. Next time I will make it thicker by adding more cornstarch because it had more of a soup consistency but still very good.

This was very good. I only used half of each seasoning I was afraid the rosemary would be overpowering but it wasn't. I will make this again. My husband's only complaint was that it was too ''soupy'' to be called stew and I kind of agree.

My husband made this, and it was very good. The only suggestion would be to marinate the meat in Worcestershire sauce first...we thought that it was a bit bland.

Thanks for the recipe! This stew is so tasty and easy to make.  I've made it a few times now and always make sure there's extra to throw in the freezer.  It definitley helps to read the reviews... I like a thick stew, so I used 5X the corn starch/water mixture.  I also like to throw in an extra veg or two (corn, peas and green beans are all really good in this stew).

I doubled the recipe and served this to 20 guests at a Christmas  party. I made it two days before and cooked it without a lid for an hour before serving and finally it got think enough. My guests loved it and said the vegetables were cooked perfectly!

I braised the meat in garlic powder, 1/4 cup of flour, and salt and pepper as previous reviewers suggested.  I cooked the meat in beef broth, and added 3 T of cornstarch at the end.  It cooked for 1 1/2 hours and was fall-apart tender!  I served it to my in-laws, who are picky eaters and they loved it.  Thanks!

Good recipe but I made some chages.  First, I dredge the beef through a flour/garlic powder mix then sauted in butter (rather then oil).  I then added some worscheshire sauce,2 cups(1 can)of beef broth, 1 cup of beer and 3 cups of water(I needed more water as my stew was super thick and very salty). I used a bag of frozen stew vegetables - which had all the veggies required. I didn't use any cornstarch as mine was thick enough - probably from the flour used to dredge the meat.  Next time will probably use less buillon then called for - Too much salt for me!!!

Wonderful and easy!  I took the advice of others and dredged the beef in flour (mixed with garlic powder and black pepper) before browning it.  I then deglazed the pan with red wine.  I also decreased the amount of carrots and added a small rutabaga.  All in all a fantastic stew.

This is a good base recipe.  The cooking time leaves the meat extremely tender.  I did find that I needed to add quite a bit more seasoning.  I added extra corn starch as well.

It was okay stew. It didn't have any pizzaz though. It could have definately used more spices in it. If we try it again we will be putting in a variety for sure.

The broth wasn't very thick but the flavor was great! It makes a nice big pot of stew and I'll be making it again because my husband actually took it to work for lunch the day after I made it (and that's saying something since he's not a leftover eater!)

A really good recipe! Will go in our favorites. We thought it would be better if the broth were thicker. Maybe we could reduce the water 1/2 to 1 cup less, next time? We will definately make it again!

This is one of my most favorite recipes from this site!  Absolutely delicious!  I served it with crusty rolls and also added some steamfresh mixed veggies that I had leftover from the night before.  I'll be making this one all winter long.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this Beef Stew for SOUP DAY @ work,it was a big hit!!I made it for 20 servings.I used a Beef Base(8tsp.)and 1 bouillon cube,instead of all bouillon   cubes,added to 7 1/2 c.of water and 1/2C. Red Cooking Wine,which I boiled first.Added 2Tbl of Tomatoe Paste,2tsp. of Parsley,2tsp. of Rosemary(which I crushed with the bottom of a glass  ),1/4tsp.each; Bl.Pepper,Tyme,Marjoram.
I browned my StewMeat with Flour and 1/4tsp.each Garlic Powder and Bl.Pepper
Added A small can of Corn and Peas.
I also added more Cornstarch and water,along with the left over flour mixture. The juice turned out perfect..not to thin or thick.
Really a GOOD TASTING STEW. This is definetly a KEEPER!!!

Fabulous flavor!  Thanks to those who suggested additional cornstarch and the use of red wine, it made a huge difference.  I ended up adding more broth as well, but make sure then to add cornstarch.

The meat in this stew is so tender. Just perfect. I added to much beef broth so my dish was more like a soup than stew. When I was making it it didnt look like enough liquid but it would be!

Beef stew was good, I loved that I can actually cook a beef stew on the stovetop that turns out perfectly tender. The only thing would be that it needed a little more flavor.  I would definitely season the meat and add some more spices.  I did add a bay leaf and next time I would add more parsley and maybe some garlic salt.  Good though, I will make it again.

I left out the onions and celery and also increased the cornstarch (I like THICK stew)-I put in 3 Tablespoons.  I'm embarrassed to admit, but I don't think I've ever cooked with rosemary before.  This was an excellent recipe!  I'm going to add it to my favorites!

Made this soup as it was a chilly day. Did not have celery in the house, nor am I a fan of boullion. Added a can of beef broth. My Sweetie found it rather bland so added Montreal Steak Seasoning. It was fantastic! Quick as well.

This was so good!  I did have to use about 4 teaspoons of cornstarch and water instead of 2.

My husband really liked it (he's a big rosemary fan), but I thought it was just pretty good.  Brought it camping and it was a great meal for a cold, rainy evening.

OMG!  I just made this for dinner tonight and I can't believe how good it turned out!  For some reason I didn't have high expectations for this, probably because I read some bad reviews.  What a surprise!  The meat was so tender it fell apart with a fork!  My husband is very picky and he couldn't stop telling me how good it was.  YUM!!

I made this tonight and it smelled great cooking in the crock pot all day but it seemed over powered by the rosemary.  The kids would not eat it...not usually picky eaters.  Maybe I did something wrong.  If I do try it again I will cut back on the rosemary.

This is a good and simple recipe, the only change I made was I added more veggies to it, there was still plenty of meat to go around. Will make this many more times.

The flavor of this stew is excellent! Very well received!!! I did thicken it up quite a bit more than the recipe called for but I guess that's just a personal preference. EXCELLENT!!!

Great on a cold day! Added red wine, used 1 1/2 tsp. of arrowroot for thickener instead of cornstarch as it does not make the stew "cloudy".  Mixed it with 1/4 cup of liquid from the stew and added it back in along with frozen peas and cooked for another 5 minutes. Kids and husband loved it!

Tastes OK.  I didn't like the liquid's color (too white) or consistency (too thin).  I wanted so badly to add some dijon mustard or red wine or beef broth to up the flavor.  In the end, I added more constarch/water to thicken.  I'll play with the leftovers.

We just thought this recipe was ok, probably will not make again. I browned the beef in a skillet then added to the slow cooker along with the other ingredients, and cooked on hi for 5 hrs.

I liked the stew! The problem was that I expected it taste more complex. That last "bang" of rosemary's mint was the only thing I've appreciated as a spice. =( Maybe that's because I've added some uncooked rosemary on top as garnish. =)I didn't find it as thick as I liked it, but it's probably just personal preference. In overall, I liked it but I don't love it.

This was a great recipe overall.  The only things that I did to change it was I used 2 cups beef broth and 2 cups of veggie stock instead of the cubes and water.  I also add different veggies each time to make it a little different.  The whole family loves the taste and smell of this meal!!

My boyfriend said this was the best stew he's ever had and he's 48 so he's had some beef stew a couple times in his life! I halved the recipe and we made pigs of ourselves, there's only one helping left. Next time I will make the entire recipe because we sooooo wished we had more leftover for tomorrow night's dinner! Thanks so much for a true winner!

This was pretty good, not such a good meal weather wise (it's been 85 degrees today), and my husband came in from mowing to a hot bowl of stew, LOL. I'm saving this for the winter. Also, I've never made stew before so I'm not sure how it compares. The kids liked it. Thanks for the recipe.

Just okay.  It smelled really good cooking but it was a bit peppery for me and it didn't thicken up as much as I would have liked.  I added more cornstarch.

We found this a bit salty, but I think that's because my husband cooked it over med-high heat, so a lot of the liquid evaporated. Other than that, this was very tasty, and the meat and potatoes were perfectly tender.

This was great!  I had to add alittle water for the xtra veggies I threw in and I added a few more seasonings like adobo and cumin and some lime juice and worcestershire sauce.  I let it simmer all day and the meat jsut fell apart.    Now I have a new way to make stew, thanks!

I lurved this stew! I think next time I'll use roast beef instead of stew meat, just because I prefer the texture of roast, but it was a wonderfully savory and tender stew.

My husband loved this stew... so did I. I added the potatos sooner then it said to, to make sure they where cooked all the way through, and next time I will add more potato. I also added corn at the request of my husband (big baby loves corn). Loved it!! Great for cold winter blues!! Thanks.

This was really good, although I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I had some left over pot roast so I used that meat and we are not fond of parsley so we used fresh cilantro instead and added a little cayenne pepper. I also used flour instead of cornstarch. Other than that, I followed the recipe and liked it. ;-)

I had to do a lot to this to turn it into something. In the end, added half a can of diced green chiles as well as two small cans of tomato sauce, red wine and finally hoisan sauce. Turned out terrific after those additions, Used two bags of frozen vegetables for stew as a timesaver.

I thought that this would be a really good stew because of all the great reviews that it got. But we did not care for this recipe. It is a basic stew recipe and needs some more flavor I am just not sure what it needs but I will try it again but I will tweak it some. It was missing something I am just not sure what it was. We also that that it called for too much celery so I used only 2 stalks maybe I will use only 1 stalk next time. Don't get me wrong it was not terrible just needed more flavor. My neighbor always gets a plate or bowl of everything I make and she has always loved everything that I have brought over to her and she did not like this either. We will just keep trying to tweak it to find what it is missing.

Great simple recipe...just a beef stew should be.  Straight forward and meaty.  The only variation was the amount of cornstarch...totalled around 8 teaspoons in my version.

This was the best beef stew I have ever made it was so good and so easy to make.  At first I wasn't sure about not covering the meat in flour first but it really didn't matter, as a matter of fact I will never do it again.  I added a bay leaf because I like that flavor in stew and also garlic powder when I was browning the meat we will be having this again for sure.

Absolutely delicious! The long cooking time allows all the flavors to combine in one of the tastiest broths I've ever eaten! You don't need to spice this stew very much at all, because the veggies and beef do it all by themselves, and the beef is fall-apart tender by the end. Very impressive!

This was dissapointing, I cooked in my crock pot and it smelled amazing all day but the flavour was off, my best guess is the rosemary dosn't belong.  This was the first and lat time I use boullion rather than broth.  Also I couldn't thicken it for the life of me.  Don't get me wrong this is good it needs serious tweeking.  I think I will try a new recipe.

This is the first time I've made stew. I usually don't like stew, but I thought this recipe was pretty savoury. I did add a can of stewed tomatoes, added some paprika, browned the beef with garlic, and added a splash of worcetershire sauce. Plus I doubled on the cornstarch. It was quite tasty.

We overcooked this by 40 minutes and it was still sooooo good! I think the trick is to barely simmer it.

This recipe was awesome!  I'm not a very experienced cook, and usually have to mess a recipe up at least once before I get it right.  Not this one though.  It tasted great, and was so much easier to prepare than I was expecting.

It was real good and easy to make.  I had to add more cornstarch to get it the consistency I like.  I cooked it for an extra 30 minutes after putting the veggies or they would have been mushy.  I had to add somemore season salt to give it more flavor.  BUT, other than my changes to make it the way I LIKE it, this is an excellent recipe.  Thanks

Just what I was looking for - simply, easy and delicious !
I cooked for a little less time, and only used just under a pound of meat.  I added corn, sweet potatoe and pasta spirals, but didn't add the celery or cornstarch.  Next time I will add rice, or perhaps soaked wild rice instead of the pasta.  Good filler up, and can modify to suit.  Was great even without alot of meat, but good to fill up on vegies if watching your weight.

Excellent and easy to make.  I suggest making sure the meat is in smaller chunks so that it will cook in time.  I had larger cuts and it took 2 hours and 45 minutes to become tender.  Also, I added a sweet potato in place of one of the regular potatoes and it blended into the stew and make it thicker and added a bit of a sweet flavor to it. Yum! This recipe is a keeper!

As a college student, dying for an easy homecooked meal once in a while.  My roomates and I were thrilled at how easy and delicious this recipe turned out.  On a personal note, the meat was my favorite part because it was so incredibly tender.  I already have orders for the rest of the year to fill.  Thank you so much!

I followed the recipe almost exactly and it turned out wonderful.  I scaled the recipe down by half and used 1.5 cubes of boullion instead of 2, added an extra cup of water, and added extra veggies.  I found that if you use finely chopped onions, that it helps to thicken the sauce and also adds some flavor.  Like some of the others, however, I did not get the full amount of servings that its supposed to yield.  Instead of 5 servings, I got 3 adult sized servings and one child sized serving.  Overall, I th ink it was a wonderful recipe and am adding it to my favorites!  :)

Changes: dredge beef in flour, delete one potato and add one yam.  Just fabulous.

This was great....I think the rosemary really enhanced the flavor a lot.  Changes I made....I only used 1 TBSP of oil, used 2 tsp of fresh parsley (because I had some I needed to use), added 1 tsp of garlic powder and two bay leaves, and used potato flakes instead of cornstarch to thicken.  It was wonderful.  My husband ate some before I even thickened it.  I have to say just the meat cooking was enough to make your mouth water - it smelled so good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe, wouldn't change a thing.  May have to tinker with the water/cornstarch ratio, depending on what heat you have it on.

This was just perfect!!  The rosemary was an unexpected surprise albeit a delicious one.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to coat the meat with flour and garlic powder which I will not do again. Other than that I followed recipe and it was superb. I highly encourage you to try this one.

I liked this beef stew a lot. I added potato flakes to thicken it as suggested and beef broth and I added mushrooms, a little red wine, and a couple of bay leaves. Great for a cold winters day.

Yum! This is really good. I've made this a lot. Double the amount of cornstarch.
