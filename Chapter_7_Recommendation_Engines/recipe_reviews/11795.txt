This was excellent.  I agree with the other cook, the shrimp would be overcooked if you left them in the sauce all that time; however I think the juices from the seafood add something to the sauce, so what I did was this: Add the shrimp when the recipe said to, and then remove with a slotted spoon after they turn pink and set aside while the rest of the sauce is reducing.  Then I put the shrimps back in the sauce at the end to warm them before serving.  Additionally, I was out of capers so instead I used a tablespoon of crushed, chopped soft green peppercorns (from a jar in brine). Worked great!! You need to add some fresh chopped parsley or basil for garnish, it is not a very colorful plate without it. There was something sort of sensual about this dish..I will definitely make this again maybe even for Valentine's day?

My husband's comment was "this is one of the best dishes you've ever made", and he considers me a very good cook. It was quick and easy and, oh so sinfully delicious. While a little rich with all the butter and oil, it's something to definitely treat yourself to once in a while! The only changes I made to it were to add MUCH more garlic (almost a head) and I waited until the end to add the shrimp so that it wasn't overcooked. It seemes like a lot of mushrooms, but they cook down. This recipe will become a fixture in my recipe box.

This recipe was great, but I added a half teaspoon of lemon juice in the sauce, and topped it with tomatoes and green onions for additional color and flavor.

I prepared this for my husband's birthday and he loved every bite of it!  One, be sure to buy very good quality Ravioli.  Two, saute the mushrooms on the side, their juices can turn the sauce gray, then add them to the sauce after cooking them down.  Three, wait until the sauce is almost done to add the prawns, otherwise they will become overcooked by the time the sauce is done. Garnished with fresh parsley to add color.  Next time I might toss in some chopped fresh Roma tomatoes.

This recipe was a nice change for ravioli. I had to play around with sauce ingredients to cut down on some of the fat.My husband really enjoyed it.

Loved it!  What wonderful flavors.  As somebody else commented, I too put the shrimp in last 3- 4 minutes so it wouldn't be over cooked.  I also took the suggestion not to use too much parmesan, but I wish I would have had a little more.  It really works with this dish.  Thanks for this recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

I am so sorry Michelle, but I did not care for this recipe.  First of all, the portobello mushrooms (because they are so dark), made the sauce turn so dark gray that it ruined the look of the dish. The sauce was very watery (no amount of simmering would help). It never did thicken up! I took the shrimp out way before the sauce was ready to put on the pasta, otherwise they would be rubbery. If I make this again, I will saute the shrimp and mushrooms separately and start from there. I will not use the portobello mushrooms again, perhaps just white button. The lemon and wine tasted very good, but this recipe overall was a huge disapointment.  Sorry:(

I made a vegetarian version--same but without the prawns.  Still excellent.  I did leave out the capers but added diced fresh tomato with the lemon juice at the end. Soooo good!

I thought I would try this recipe on my husband for Valentines Day.  He thought it was really good, and that is coming from someone who is a meat-and-potatos kind of guy.  I would definatly make this one again.

The only changes I made were to omit the capers (I hate them), and I used a combination of apple juice and Marsala wine as that's what I had on hand. This is such a delicious dish, and so easy to make too. Don't skimp with the Parmesan - it absolutely makes it! Thanks so much, Michelle!

Good recipe overall-made a few changes to it based on what had on hand. Left out prawns and used regular button mushrooms instead of portobellos. I also increased the amount of lemon juice to one whole (small) lemon. I also added parsley and basil to the sauce while it cooked for additional flavour. Once the raviolis were done I topped them with tomatoes and roasted red pepper. 
One thing though-the sauce took longer than stated in the original recipe to cook down. In fact it's still a little watery even after close to 10 minutes of cooking. For this reason, you may want to 
wait until the last few minutes before beginning to cook the ravioli (the ones I used were frozen spinach and cheese raviolis and cooked in 4-5 minutes). 
Good recipe overall though:)

Very nice, easy dish with a lot of nice flavor.  Will definitely make it again!  I did make a substitute as I didn't have ravioli, but just used some egg noodles and mixed them into the mushroom sauce - delish!

I love rich food.  This tasted rich but it was a bit much for me.  I wasn't too much of a fan, which is weird because I love all the ingredients.  My boyfriend liked it but I didn't.    I don't think Ill make it again.

OMG SO GOOD!! I think this was the best meal I ever made. I added a little flour to thicken the sauce along with tomatoes. I left out the prawns and shrimp because I don't eat meat, but I think this would be great to marinade a chicken breast in for my boyfriend though...thoughts? Thanks so much for the amazing recipe!

GREAT Recipe!!  I made this recipe without the prawns, because I didn't have any and it came out wonderful.  It is definitely a dish I will make for years and years.

I thought this was wonderful. I used chicken instead of shrimp and didn't put in the capers as I didn't have any. My kids thought the wine taste was a little much (although I loved it) so next time I might use chicken broth instead. I did use some cornstarch to thicken

I followed the recipe exactly, and like others said it was not aesthetically pleasing at all.  The flavor was really good but the sauce was way too thin.

Excellent!!!! I made a few modifications due what I had on hand.  Boiled shrimp and mushrooms in vine, removed shrimp and mushrooms, boiled wine sauce added a tsp of cornstarch just to thicken a bit more.  Very good tangy taste, will definitely try again.  
45 medium shrimp
no capers
1 cup sherry cooking wine
½ lb sliced white mushrooms

Fabulous. I took the shrimp out once pink and put back in a few minutes before serving. Other than that followed directions. My wife thought it was terrific , like a fancy retaurant. 
Will try next time with Chicken so my daughter in law ( shrimp allergy) can try. I highly recommend this.

This recipe wasn't bad, but I doubt I'll make it again. The shrimp were tough and the color was aweful. The taste wasn't bad, but it was definately missing something. It seems like, with a bit of tweaking, it'd be great.

I also removed the prawns after they turned pink and put them back in at the end to warm them up.  Sauce took longer to boil down than I expected because even the ravoli was done before the sauce--and I'm not that fast!  Delicious flavor and I forgot the parmesan to begin with, so we got to taste with and without. Good both ways, but slightly better with the cheese.  But four ravoli was okay for me--not for my husband.  Plan on 6 for a bigger eater.

I left out the parmesan because it's pretty much unheard of to serve such a strong cheese over the delicate flavor of seafood like prawns. Completely covers them up.

I thought this was a great dish but needed some adjustments.  I made it with chicken instead of prawns and added chopped green onion and diced tomato for color and extra flavor.  I thought the sauce was a bit too thin, so next time I will try thickening with cornstarch. I also did not use all 7 mushrooms; 2 were fine for my taste.  Overall I thought it was great and will definitely make again!

This was a very tasty recipe, my husband loved it.  My only complaints are that the sauce was too watery and in making it I discovered that I don't like capers, next time I think I'll just use salt to give the saltiness that the shrimp need.  Other than that it was good and I will make again but will modify just a little.

This recipe is the best of 2019  I love frozen Portobello Mushroom Ravioli but at a lost for a good sauce I found this outstanding recipe and almost died when I made it, sooo good. The shrimp is  a great addition but the sauce as a whole is divine. Capers make this great sauce as does the garlic,wine and butter. I followed it as written but  used ravioli with portobello . no substitutes, absolutely marvelous .

Excellent!  It is a bit touchy and needs to be watched however well worth it.  I noticed another reviewer's comment on the grey colour of the sauce from the mushrooms. This happened to me in a creme of mushroom soup - made the colour very unsightly to the point where we didn't even want to eat it.  The solution is to use a spoon and scrape out the gills before slicing.  Problem solved.

Awesome! Sauteed mushrooms separately, and used much less butter. Added Kalmata olives with the capers, and juice of 1 lemon. At end I added some corn starch water mixture to thicken sauce up a tad.
