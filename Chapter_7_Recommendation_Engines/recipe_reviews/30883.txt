I don't know what the true definition of this dish is except delicious! The meat was tender and flavorful the sauce (gravy) rich with layers of flavors. I personally loved the veggies and really appreciate the complexity they add to the dish. The aroma of the simmering pot was unbelievable! Thank you Leslie!!

The only problem I have with this recipe is the name. It made me believe it would have a richer more interesting taste but it ended up tasting exactly like a typical beef stew. Many stew recipes are much simpler and yield a very similar result.

The previous reviewers are missing the point which is that this is delicious! Maybe it's not a "true" beef burgundy but who cares? My husband who usually doesn't like soups and stews absolutely loves this!

Too much like beef stew with the potatoes and carrots in the dish. Not a classic beef and burgundy dish.

I cooked this recipe for 27 people to celebrate a 90th birthday for my boyfriends Mom. I had only met his family once before. This dish won me lots of praise and thank you's from everyone. Leftovers were actually stolen! I overheard my guy telling someone that it was the best food he had ever eaten. I will cook this for my family the next time I am having them for dinner. This dish will impress your friends.

A beautiful Beef Burgundy. As good as I have had even in France. The meat was very tender it also pays to use a good wine. I used the same as we were drinking with the dinner. Instead of adding the potatoes I made a creamy mash and it went extremely well with this dish. You will enjoy this dish very much.

The beef was so tender. The whole house smelled invitingly delicious. The sauce was eagerly sopped up with French bread. Everyone is looking forward to another batch.

It was very delicious and relatively easy to make. Would definetly make it again. I didn't give it five stars just because it was tasty but was lacking something. I can't put my finger on it but what ever that little something was it does not change the fact that this was a delicious dish.

This was very good! I skipped sauteeing all the veggies and only did the onions and mushrooms together. I thought there would be way too much butter otherwise. Besides that I didn't deviate it was wonderful and I could definitely taste the burgundy!

I made this today exactly by the directions even though I usually just toss all my stew ingredients in a pot boil it and see what happens. I'm so glad I made this pot the right way. I browned all the veggies individually just like it says and wow! This is one good stew! I recommend it highly.

This recipe is worth the time and effort. I served a plain mashed potatoe and with the rich gravy it was so good. Everyone loved it.
