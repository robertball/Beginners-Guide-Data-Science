Amazing flavor, yet not overwhelming at all. Only used about half the amount of water called for. I put a scoop of vanilla ice cream in this and made creamcicle like floats. =^.^= Tasty.

This is absolutely delicious! Great combination of fruits, very tropical. I increased the amount of fruit, used frozen mango, and only used 1/3 cup of water just because I prefer thick smoothies. No need to add any sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious, not too sweet. The sweetness is just right! Refreshing, and smells good too. I used grapefruit zest. Give it a try!
