Nice flavor and very easy.  I used more chopped onions, added fresh pressed garlic, added a "glob of peach preserves, substituted apple cider vinegar for the lemon, and  added bell pepper chunks and sliced canned pineapple (both near the end).  I thickened the sauce to use as gravy over rice.  Next time I will cut the onions in big chunks and add red food coloring for a more traditional looking dish.  I love the ease of using a crock pot.   I will make this often.  Thanks.

Super easy!  The pork chops came out tender after 4 hours!  I did double the sauce recipe as I don't have a small slow cooker and was afraid that it would dry out the meat.  This was pretty awesome and will make it again.

The pork chops were tender and delicious.  My picky husband and children loved them!!! A good choice when you want to eat something yummy but not tons of calories. I kept recipe as is, no changes and it was awesome.

It was very delicious. I used water instead of lemon juice (only because I didn't have lemon juice) only recomendation is to double the recipie cause there wasn't enough sauce.

Welll...something even I can make! This recipe came out delicious - very tender and tasty. I did make a few changes: used more onions and, instead of lemon juice, used blackberry Simply Fruit. I think next time I'll add more onion and use green pepper and pineapples as suggested in other reviews. Yummy served over rice.

I was unsure how this was going to turn out after seeing the food in the slow cooker. I did put more onion in then what the recipe had called for. Tho the lack of juice in the pot made me feel like it might come out dry but I went along with the recipe and it turned out good. There was juice in there at the end and my pork did not come out dry at all. The flavor was sweet but not overly sweet. I still loved eating my pork with applesauce. With some green beans on the side. This was a great supper and I enjoyed eating it with my boyfriend by my side.

Definately a keeper !   I added chunks of red and yellow peppers and chunks of onions and thickened the sauce with corn starch before serving over rice.  I also baked it in the oven at 300 for a couple of hours as I didn't' have time to cook it in the slow cooker.   You could cut the chops with your fork.  Yumm!

Well I thought this was delicious.  Made exactly as written, although my pork chops were frozen solid, so I did not brown them.  We served over rice and it was a very satisfying meal.

This is so easy! I added pineapple juice to the sauce and I throw pineapple in the slow cooker about 30 minutes before its done cooking. Delicious over some white rice.

I have made this receipe several times & it is one of my all time favorites. In fact, when I didn't have pork chops I used it with chicken & it was also wonderful. I have also made extra sauce & shredded the meat to make it more of a meat sauce to mix in with the rice. SOOOO good!

Tasty and simple!  After I had started the recipe I realised we were out of ketchup.  Used a can of tomato paste plus a pinch of sugar as a replacement and it turned out nicely.

Tried it oven baked.  The flavor or the ketchup was alittle too strong.  May try cutting back on that next time.

This was a hit for the family.  My alterations, mild chicken and rib BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, diced onions instead of mincing, and also added a coarsely chopped red pepper.  I used the oven method, then removed all the ingredients and used some water and corn starch to create a flavorful sauce for the rice.

This is a great, easy recipe. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the sauce. I also added 1 tbsp of pineapple juice to the sauce and added pineapple chumks and chopped green bell pepper at the end.

Cut the brown sugar in half, added 1/2 tsp prepared mustard and 1 extra T. onion. Next time I want to thicken the sauce and add green pepper and pineapple. As to cooking time I put 4 boneless chops in the crockpot at 11:00 a.m. and they were completely done and tender at 1:00.

Too little topping and the chops were dry and disgusting.  At least double the topping amount and cook far less.

Very easy and delicious, even the picky eaters in my house loved it.  I only give it 4 stars because I did have to make some changes.  I followed the advice of other reviews and doubled the sauce, it still didn't look like enough so I added more, and it still could have had more sauce.  I also added a yellow and orange pepper, and an onion and a half instead of the 2 tbs that it called for.  I also watched it very closely and only cooked it for 3 hours on low, I think that 4-6 hours is way too long. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this dish when I invited my mother over for dinner this wknd.  I was a little hesitant to try it based on the ingredients but I was happy that I already had everything in my kitchen.  I added a whole onion and some garlic cloves.  The pork itself came out tender but I found the flavor to be disappointing and bland for my taste. I felt like it could have used salt, but since none was cited in the recipe I didn't use any and I wish I had.  My mother thought it was good so I let her keep the leftovers.  I will not be making this again for myself though.

Made this tonight! I added 1/2 teaspoon pepper, garlic salt and ground mustard. The sauce was on the sweet side. The chops alone I would rate a 3 but served with white rice really balanced out the flavors so I gave it a 4. I would definitely use a thicker chop when making this. It was very easy to throw together and I will make it again!

Recipe does NOT include the ingredients I see in the picture.  No pineapple of green pepper, for instance.

Not a fan! Found the pork  flavorless, recipe really needed to say sprinkle pork with salt and pepper to taste, then brown on both sides. The sauce wasn't bad, but a bit sweeter than I prefer. I almost gave 1 star rating, but gave 2 because the meat 
 just fell off the bone ... which is why I love using slow cooker.

Very light, very tasty and I will make this again and again. I used the slow cooker this first time and may use the oven in the future. I read reviews, used double the ingredients to make more sauce and I'm glad I did. I did not quite double the ketchup, though.  This really hit the spot and was a nice change instead of something heavy and gloppy. The photo shows colored peppers, diced and added and I did that. Other than using less ketchup (personal choice  - don't care for it), this needed NO substitutions. Perfect as-is. Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy - I added minced garlic and heated the onion and garlic just long enough to take the rawness out - but the recipe probably doesn't need this step. Tip: dry chops on paper towel before searing - and I used paper towel to suck up any fat on chops after they were seared.

We liked this recipe well enough to try it again.  However, I used frozen pork chops (I did not defrost first) and I doubled the sauce recipe.  I cooked them on low for 4 hours.  I needed to cook the chops for 4 hours (because of my kids schedule), but I didn't want them to dry out.  So I thought if I started them frozen, it would help.  But, the pork chops were still a little over cooked and dry.  Their temperature was over 165 degrees.  So if I do this again, I will still put them into the crock pot frozen, but I will monitor the temperature of the chops more and I will stop the cooking when they reach 145-150 degrees.

This was soo yummy! I read through a good number of reviews and made all the suggested changes. I added pineapple juice, some dry mustard and onion chunks to the sauce. At the end I threw in some chopped up peppers. 
Great recipe thanks!

Made just as the recipe stated to, except used a roast and not chops. Turned out really good, tender, juicy, and great flavor. Next time I'll add pineapple and bell peppers.

I don't know why everyone thinks you have to cook pork to death. Decent chops are done in 3-4 minutes, shoulder steaks take a bit longer and have more flavor if cooked well done, I prefer shoulder meat when it's braised for 15-20 minutes, but to cook them for 4-5 hours is ridiculous.

The pork chops were dry and hard.  I looked it up and pork chops will be tough if over cooked.  The recipe says to cook,after browning, for 4-6 hrs on low. I did.

Very easy to make, even for a beginning cook like me, but flavor was not sweet and sour by a long shot.  More like an oversweet Marinara sauce.  Probably won't try again.

I made this according to the recipe. I had good size center cut pork chops so I cooked it the full 6 hours on low in the slow cooker. I had plenty of sauce, probably too much. I found the flavor lacking. In spite of plenty of sauce the meat was dry. Will probably not make again. Also disappointed that the picture looks like it has peppers and pineapple which I did not use since I was following the recipe. Did not pick up much sweet and sour taste.

I made it following the recipe almost as given as I always do the first time.


Except I did double the sauce as suggested by others.


From here I can tweak it to my personal taste.


It is a keeper.

I added 1/4 cup of lemon juice for more "sour".   It turned out tender, not a chewy pork chop at all, and tasted good.

Shouldn’t there be pineapple chunks and green peppers in this?  Looks like those in the picture...?

I snagged a lot of others ideas.......  added onion, peppers, used the juice of a small can of pineapple and added the pineapple the last 3o minutes. used 1/2 catsup and 1/2 barbecue sauce (doubled the sauce) but added a couple of heaping tablesppons of hot pepper jelly (omitted the brown sugar)  It was perfect over white rice.  My husband was very reluctant to try it......... but he finished off a big bowl.  If the sauce is too thin, just add cornstarch mixed with water.  The hot pepper jelly adds a nice kick! :-)

I made this for tonight's dinner.  Very simple to make.  I added 4 different peppers-Green, red, orange and yellow.  I used chopped fresh white onion instead of minced onions.  Used apple cider vinegar instead of lemon juice.  Added pine apple chunks.  Peach preserves.  Fresh garlic.  My hubby said it was the pork chops he has ever had.

This was very easy and delicious! I followed some of the others suggestions... I used chopped onions instead of minced and I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup. I did double the dose to use the liquid over rice. I also added fresh pineapple towards the end as well as some carrots that I had in the frig. Took about 4 hours for it to get tender but was delicious!

I would double the sauce I didn't have enough and it started to burn on the sides of the slow cooker. Taste was OK probably won't make again.

I usually don't care for pork, I make it for the family because it is economical. But I ate it this time, it was delicious over rice and the pork was tender. I doubled the sauce , and was glad I did.  Great recipe!  Will make again.

I doubled the recipe except for the pork chops and added a can of sliced pineapple along with the juice and it was good but still not enough juice when it was done, I also cut up the pork when it was done so it was smaller pieces.  Next time I will add a little water to it and green peppers and make it more like sweet & sour pork.  It was still good but just needed more moisture.

This recipe is fantastic. I used a thinner pork chop cut and only marinated the chops for 1.5 - 2.0 hours. I substituted rice wine vinegar and used maple smoke mesquite spice.  I grilled them only 4 minutes--using the method the internet recommended.  Grill on high 1 minute with lid down;  turn 45 degrees, lid down for another minute.  Then turn chops and repeat.  Chops were succulent and juicy with a lot of flavor. This is the best recipe for pork chops I've ever had.

WOW.  This recipe is a keeper and going into our regular rotation.  Better Half LOVED these chops - they were tender, juice and delicious.  He took one bite and said, "WOW."  Took another bite and said, "This sauce would be great on ribs too - this is wonderful!"  So we'll try it on ribs soon.  I followed the recipe except for adding about a tablespoon (maybe two) of Shiracha sauce.  We like things with a bit of bite to them and can't wait to have these again.  Thank you Bonnie D for a truly delightful pork recipe!

I didn't change the recipe much. Added a little soy sauce and cubed the pork chops once the were tender then threw them back into the crock pot. Will double the sauce next time so I have extra to put over my rice. This was delicious and so easy to make!

I've made a lot of slow cooker recipes from Allrecipes.com, and this was the most disappointed I've been.  I slow cooked the pork chops for about 3 hours and 45 minutes on low.  However, I also added a little bit of salt, 1/2 tsp of ground ginger and a pinch of white sugar.  Additionally, as others recommended, I doubled the sauce, added about half a green pepper and pineapple chunks, (drained), about 30-45 minutes before the pork was 'done.'  Even with all the added ingredients, the pork came out dry, and I still felt it wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping.  I would defiantly not recommend this, or make this again.  If it wasn't from the extra ingredients other reviewers contributed, I would be giving this recipe one star.  What a waste of food.

I made this last night on the stove top and it was a hit! Very simple and tasty.  I did saute onions & garlic first and substitued apple cider vinegar for lemon. Needed extra liquid so I added a little beef broth. Served on buttered rice with sweet peas. It will diffently be a frequent meal for my family.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe is a real good starting point, but as much as I changed, I should probably start a new recipe.  Based on other people's comments, I tripled the original recipe for the same 4 pork chops (large, bone in chops), in addition, I added 4 tablespoons of pineapple juice from a can of crushed pineapples.  I also used chopped raw onion.  In the last hour, I added the crushed pineapple and chopped green pepper.  I had plenty of juice and served everything over egg noodles instead of rice.  I thought it turned out really well, but it's pretty different.

This is actually quite good! I changed minced onion to a small chopped onion. We like onions with our pork though. It was delicious and I'm making it for the second time this evening. Thanks for this great, and truly easy, recipe!

I doubled the sauce to ensure there was enough liquid in the slow cooker and to have extra to pour over the rice.  It was excellent.  Kid and husband approved!  And so easy.

made this last night for dinner as recipe called for except that i tripled it because i used a value pack of bone-in pork chops. the flavor was sweet, but not too sweet. we enjoyed the taste. we served it with rice and a salad. only "complaint" might be that it wasn't a sauce.
