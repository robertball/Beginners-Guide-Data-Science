I used a different kind of hash brown with peppers and onions. I am sure it would have cooked better with the rounds. I seasoned the eggs with salt and pepper. Next time I think I would add some onions and green peppers to the eggs, but honestly you can't mess up this recipe. Really good flavors.

I really liked it! I will probably make it again. I used the hash brown patties since we don't have the rounds at our store. I made it without the chives since I don't have them either. I did use 10 eggs instead of 8. The next time I make it, I will probably use sausage instead of bacon, and I will use a dozen eggs as even ten wasn't quite enough. I did use the cheddar cheese , but I topped it off with a shaved Mexican 4 cheese mix. I think the possibilities are endless as to what you would like to use for toppings. Enjoy!

This was easy to come together and the hubby enjoyed it. I do think it needs additional egg and I added some green pepper for a little color and a boost of flavor, which I think it needs. Easily adaptable by adding any additional toppings you enjoy. Hash browns didn't get as crispy as we would have liked. I served mine with salsa and it was a great addition.

I used hash brown patties and followed the original baking instructions. It turn out perfect! I did season the scrambled eggs the way my family normally likes them. It was delicious! My 2 year old daughter said, "I likey the pizza, Mommy! Thumbs up!". Best compliment I could ever receive. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

We didn't have potato rounds at our store, so I used hash brown patties.  I lined the bottom of the pan with them (used approximately 12) and followed the directions as though I had the potato rounds.  Also, I used Smithfield cubed ham.  Although I had the chives, I totally forgot to put them on top!!  The result was great.  This was so easy to make.  I ended up making the scrambled eggs the way I usually make them because eggs scrambled by themselves usually turn out rubbery to me.   This was a big winner and can be used as a base recipe where you add your own ingredients.  It is fast to make and has an excellent result.

I added a few veggies, red peppers and mushrooms, and it is awesome!  So nice to grab a square out in the morning, heat it up and have a ready made good breakfast.

The thing I did different was pour the stirred egg mixture over the potatoes, added the bacon and cheese and it was a hit! It came out great for my family really enjoyed it. A lot different than plain eggs for breakfast.

I made this and loved the crust, but the rest of it was bland. Next time maybe red peppers or green chilis.

This dish is hearty and good for any meal any time of the day. The other great things about the Hash Brown Breakfast Pizza is that it's economical, easily serves a large family and is quick to come together.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but, unfortunately it wasn't our favorite.  We didn't have enough eggs as stated in the recipe, so,  we ended up making another 4 eggs for a total of 12.  I also thought the ratio of toppings was off to the hash brown layer.  Most of what we tasted were the hash browns.  The hash rounds also didn't get as crispy as I would have liked them.   I used green onions instead of chives because that is what I had in the refrigerator.

Really good!  
I used hash brown patties and made individual pizzas!
I used sausage and scrambled it into the eggs along with onion then topped the hasbrowns with it and some cheese.
My husband enjoyed his with salsa!
Great recipe!

5.23.19 Loved this!  We gave ours a good shot of sriracha which elevated the flavor even more. I will add more eggs in the future because I didn’t have quite enough to adequately cover all of the potatoes (maybe I flattened too much?).  Also, would suggest really undercooking your eggs because they’re going into a very hot oven to cook for another 8-10 minutes, so you might end up with rubbery scrambled eggs if overcooked.  This one’s a keeper, and I can see this as a good breakfast for overnight visitors.

This is super easy, full of flavor, and perfect for a busy weeknight. I mean who doesn't love breakfast for dinner? This is one the kiddo's will love and adults too. Smithfield bacon is the bomb! Definitely a keeper and 5 stars all the way!

Loved this breakfast pizza! It was such a neat twist. I used regular tater tots which smooshed into the pan easily with a rubber spatula after the first 10 min of baking. I also added a little diced bell pepper and onion, simply because I already had it in the fridge. I used Smithfield Anytime Favorites diced ham as well as crumbled bacon. Everyone in the family raved about it! This is a keeper recipe for sure! Thanks, Smithfield!

I used turkey bacon and, as Chef Mo suggested, cooked my eggs with chopped red bell pepper and onion.  Topped with a splash of Tabasco sauce.  I'd prefer if this dish had an extra spicy kick to it, maybe chopped jalapeno or red pepper flakes.

Keeper for sure!!  I made this in a 12x12 Magic Line pan using Kroger's potato rounds.  I followed the recipe with a few extras of almost everything: a dozen eggs with some onion and red bell pepper added, almost three cups of cheese, and the whole 16 oz package of Smithfield bacon.  It was delicious and loved by everyone!  I added some sour cream and salsa to mine, but my granddaughters chose to leave theirs as is.  Everyone raved!  Thanks so much, Smithfield!  It was delicious!
