This is great! Nice consistency. Very easy to make and not much cleanup. I used plain Greek yogurt and lemon juice instead of sour cream. Easily made with an immersion blender. Next time I will cut some of the ginger. It was a bit overpowering right out of the pot, and I love ginger-heavy foods. On the second day it might settle and blend a little more. As I write this, the after taste is setting in. Really nice blend of spices.

Great recipe! I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. And I had some roasted garlic so I used that. Tasty dish.
