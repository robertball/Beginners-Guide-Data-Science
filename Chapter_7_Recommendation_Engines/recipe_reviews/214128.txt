Too much burn for me! As written, this drink recipe will put some hair on your chest! Since that's not what I was wanting, I doubled the lime juice, and added 3/4 cup sweet n sour mix. It still burns a bit, but it's tolerable now. It could probably stand even more sweet n sour to be more my speed. Everyone has their own preferences, though! All around, this is a tasty and unexpected beverage!

LOLOL My Wonderfully hard working hubby THOROUGHLY enjoyed this drink!! When I went shopping for the curacao, the guy told me the mixer was better unless I Really wanted a lot of booze in my drink. I said, 'Oh No!'LOL! Hubby Jokingly told his friends that he was drinking radiator fluid! I didn't have any fresh limes and I had a partial bottle of Rose's sweet lime juice, hahaha. I guess it had been in the cabinet for a While since it was kinda brown, still tasted fine, so I added a wee bit to the glass and it actually turned this drink a pretty aqua color. Tom, I didn't figure this was what you were think when you submitted it so I left the other batch w/o the lime. As you can See, Carlos Really enjoyed it! Thanks a Bunch Tom, this was a Great start to Summer!
