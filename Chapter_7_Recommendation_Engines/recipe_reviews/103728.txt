Really good but I made a few changes.  The grocery store I went to didn't have any ground pork so I bought 4 thick bone-in pork chops that were on sale.  I cut off the bone and fat then cut the pork into small pieces.  I added the pork to 1 can of enchilada sauce, the onion, chili powder, cumin, 1 can green chilis, 1 can petite diced tomatoes, 1/2 bunch coarsely chopped cilantro and 1/4 cup white wine vinegar.  I let this cook for about 30 minutes and added 1 can black beans and 2 chopped chipotle peppers. Be very careful of the peppers! They are the kind that are in a can and are very hot! When I open a new can of them, I separate the peppers into small freezer bags with 2 peppers per bag plus a small amount of the sauce. I find this is the right amount of heat for me. Start with one though! I ended up making these into big burritos because I layered refried beans, the pork mix, thin sliced avocados, cheese, sour cream and salsa.

Delicious alternative to regular tacos.  We had some ground pork we needed to use, so I searched this site and found this recipe.  I was a little skeptical because of the vinegar, but this recipe turned out FABULOUS!  The Salsa Verde *makes* the tacos, be sure to use it.  This one's already in our recipe box to use again and again!  Thanks for a great twist on TACO NIGHT! :)

This was an excellent alternative to regular ground beef tacos.  Very tasty and just the right amount of spice.  I topped with Red Leicester cheese, tomatoes and lettuce.  YUM!  Will definitely make this again.

These were really good, next time I'll probably use flour tortillas because the corn ones are a bit dry for my taste.  I agree that the salsa verde really makes this - don't skip it!

I just tried this recipe today and it is fantastic, so much flavor.  I did make a few changes; instead of adding chili powder to the meat I added cumin instead.  I also didn't have the rice vinegar so added apple cider vinegar instead.  Instead of the pintos I added a can of chili beans in chili gravy and it was perfectly spiced for me.  I also topped mine with a relish I made of green onions, green bell peper, chopped tomatoes, dried parsley, and a small amount of olive oil and some apple cider vinegar.  Used the extra juice in the relish to pour over the meat/beans.  They were great and needed nothing else to top them.  Definately a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a fairly fast dinner to put together. I also changed mine a bit by adding a chopped, fresh jalapeno, along with a tbsp. of cumin. We typically garnish our tacos with fresh cilantro instead of lettuce, and this always seems to add flavor to ANY type of taco. Thanks for sharing this recipe... it will be a keeper!

This was yummy. I followed the reviewers' recommendations and halved the vinegar, which was perfect. I like a little heat so I added a few dashes of ground cayenne pepper. Served it on flour tortillas with fresh salsa (I chopped in some avocado and added a little fresh lime juice), shredded lettuce, and light sour cream.

This recipe was very tasty and easy to make. The only change I made was to  cut the amount of chili powder in half, and I serviced them with sun dried tomato tortillas. EXCELLANT!!!!

I used 1/3 vinegar and added about 1 t cumin. This was really good. Oh and I would use flour next time like the other reviews.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though it wasn't my favorite thing ever.  My husband was crazy about it.  This just tastes different than anything I have cooked out of ground meat before.  That is pretty cool.  I could probably go for a bit less vinegar.  Even so, I ate a whole bunch of these on corn tortillas with a big pile of cilantro on top.

This was good and easy to make. Can be made ahead of time and reheated for supper.  Only thing I changed was the cayenne pepper, because I grow my own, I used 1 whole pepper with seeds instead of the ground pepper the recipe called for.

This was quite tasty.  The texture left something to be desired but my ground pork was 100% to blame, being somewhat freezer burned.  I halved the vinegar, added some cumin and a dash of cayenne for heat.  I don't think the whole allotment of vinegar would have added to the flavor and the cumin and cayenne pepper added needed dimension.  It was still too juicy, so I mashed some extra beans and added the mash to the dish.  The recipe still needs some tinkering as I feel it is missing something.  I look forward to trying this recipe again with decent pork.

These were wonderful! I substituted black beans since that's what I had in my cupboard and topped the tacos with cilantro, tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, and black olives. Thanks so much for this recipe. I'll never go back to regular beef tacos again!

Great recipe! Nice change from typical tacos. Made even easier with shredded left-over pork. Recipe makes a lot - dinner for 4 plus lunch the next day.

I believe the author of this recipe hit one out of the park exactly as it is spelled out in the recipe. There is no reason to change even a single ingredient or method. This is precisely the way the author chose for it to taste. Therefore as with most recipes, it is a winner. Family loved it.

Very tasty! I only added 2 tbsp. of chili powder and it tasted great. I didn't have rice vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar instead like a previous poster. Turned out great. I served hominey splashed with cholula as a side dish for extra fiber!

Very tasty! I made this almost exactly as written, other than serving the meat mixture with soft flour tortillas and hard corn tortilla shells. I also thickened the meat mixture with a tablespoon of cornstarch with a little water. I loved the use of pinto beans, and the pork was tasty, but it tasted much like beef so you could probably use ground beef as well. I think next time I would cut back the vinegar by a quarter, but otherwise it's a great alternative to regular tacos!

Hi,
These were amazing. I went with a 1/4 cup of rice wine vinegar (I didn't go name brand - whatever was in the cupboard), no beans at all, and some cumin (maybe 1 - 1.5  tbsp).  They tasted great!!

I picked this out because of the low calories per serving. I followed others' suggestions and cut the vinegar in half. Also, I drained the fat from the pork before adding the beans to cut back on the greasy factor. I would suggest draining the beans because there was a lot of liquid in the final product. Served on flour tortillas with a side of canned Mexicorn. I thought this was different and good, but husband disagreed. Probably won't make again since he didn't care much for it. Thanks anyway!

This was really good, but I wish I used the other suggestions to decrease the vinegar. I will make these again, but I will use less vinegar. I used left over pork roast, shredded, and it worked great.

I thought this recipe was great.  I would actually mix in some salsa next time to make it a little moister, but it's definitely a recipe I'll repeat :) The vinegar adds a strange -- but delicious -- touch!

This recipe was OK.  I made it exactly as written and it was a bit to vinegary for me.  If I were to make it again I would put less vinegar in.  Also, when using the corn tortillas it was very messy.  I also had flour tortillas on hand, and I felt they made the pork mixture taste better and the tortilla did not tear so easily.

These were absolutely delicious.  My friends were a little sketchy when I suggested pork tacos and even more wary when they saw how much vinegar went into the pan, but they couldn't stop eating the tacos when they were done.

I really like this recipe.  I lessened the vinegar and thickened it a bit with cornstarch.  It was delicious on tacos but is also great over rice or rice and beans.

This was my first attempt at using pork for Mexican cooking and I definitely consider it a success.  Next time, I will be looking for a way to bring down the sweetness, perhaps by adding some cumin or chipolte.

I did not care for this at all. I wasn't expecting it to be sweet. Why would anyone want a mexican dish to be sweet. My family did not care for this.

Tasted alright, but nothing too extraordinary. Too much vinegar in my opinion. I prefer just using a taco seasoning mix and hamburger.

Had a great flavor, but the ground pork made the recipe really greasy!  Next time I think I'll try with ground chicken or turkey.
