Very good sugar cookies with just a hint of licorice flavor!  I couldn't find lard so I used butter instead and they still turned out fantastic.

This recipe is the best. My Grandmother used to make me these cookies as a little girl. The only difference to the recipe was she used ( pineapple-juice)instead of (brandy). She would roll the cookies in the sugar & cinnamon when the cookies were still hot. Thank You VERY MUCH.

Well, first off:  Never send a man to do a womans job.  :p  My husband bought All Vegetable Shortnening instead of lard.  Still, they came out DELICIOUS!  I was told they come out better w/ lard, so i'll use that next time.  Also, I used brandy, not pineapple juice like another suggested, but I did use PJ to moisten up the dough when needed.  THANK YOU!

This recipe brought back memories of my grandmother!  I loved them.  They tasted just like the ones she made for us as children.  My grandmothers recipes is almost exact except for a couple small details.  Her recipe used only 1 C of sugar, and she used 3 eggs.  She also used orange juice (I like to use OJ) or whiskey for the liquid.  This is a keeper!

My mother has been making these cookies all my life - it wouldn't be Christmas without them!  We have always used small (1 inch) cookie cutters in various shapes.  We put the cookies in a bowl filled with cinnamon/sugar and then put them on the baking sheet - then back in the sugar when they come out of the oven! My family eats them like popcorn!

Made these for my son's baptism - wonderful!  I used rum instead of brandy and 2 teaspoons of anise seed extract.   I coated cookies in cinnamon/sugar before and after baking.  You must make the cookies very thick, otherwise they will crack and break while you are coating them.

These were very good! I used 1 tblsp brandy flavoring and used milk to make up for the rest of the liquid from the lack of brandy. I also added a little more anise because I know I like my biscochitos a little more anisey! :) Took me back home to Albuquerque!

These weren't exactly like Grandma used to make, but they did take me back.  Next time I'll add more anise.  The dough got rather crumbly so I had to keep adding butter.  This recipe's a keeper~~~I'll just tweek it to make it my own.

Made these for my partner who was is a New Mexico transplant.  She couldn't wait for them to cool before she was eating them.  She claims they are totally authentic.  The only suggestion would be to dip the cookies in cinnamon & sugar (liberally) after they come out of the oven - as soon as cool enough to touch.  Otherwise...perfect!

I'd actually rate these closer to 5 stars if I made them with lard, but I just don't like the smell of lard, so I used shortening instead. As a native New Mexican, biscochitos mean Christmas to me. I never really knew how my grandma made her version, but these are pretty darn close. Delicious recipe- thanks for sharing! My only piece of advice is to not overwork the dough- biscochito dough is supposed to be crumbly and this one is- it seems like it needs more liquid, but don't add it- the crumbly dough leads to flaky delicious cookies. Also, I rolled mine in the cinnamon sugar after baking since that is what my grandmother always did.

This is the same recipe I have used for 12 years now.  Everyone loves them.  One thing I do different is I put 1 or more cups of sugar in a shallow container with cinnamon to your liking and as I cut I put cookies in the mixture and give them a good dusting. You'll never go wrong with this recipe.

This cookie was the ONLY cookie my mom made when I was growing up. She's from New Mexico and she made them with both love and pride for her culture and her heritage, so they were a BIG deal. She made them with lard and E&J Brandy, and without a written recipe, so when I wanted to continue on with the tradition, allrecipes.com was my first stop. I've made this recipe so often, and it's always been a big hit. I started selling them by the dozen at community craft fairs and such and they always disappear. I use plain Crisco. I increase the Brandy to 1/4 C plus 1 Tablespoon. This dough is a dry dough, so it helps to keep it a little more moist when rolling. Do not flour your surface before rolling, only dust your rolling pin often. I also increase the anise seed to a Tablespoon. I roll out to a 1/4 inch as they grow up and not out while baking. Any thicker and you'll end up with a biscuit. I increase the baking temp by one minute or they are too delicate. Delicious recipe. Happy baking!

These were yummy!  I didn't have brandy so I used whiskey instead. The lard gives a distinct flavor. Thanks!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because of the ease and the basic ingredients used.  The cookies were quite good, the directions were clear and concise and the baking time was spot-on. However, I did not give them 5 stars because they are definitely not **quite** authentic.  My sisters and I made these cookies to include in my welcome baskets for the guests attending my wedding in Santa Fe, NM and the recipe we used had about 15-20 ingredients and the cookies were MUCH more authentic tasting.  I did not have most of the ingredients on-hand (or the time or desire!!) to duplicate that recipe.  This is an easy, very quick recipe that will give you good results but is missing just a little **something**.

The dough came out very dry and so did the cookie.  I made two batches, just to make sure I hadn't messed one up and the result was the same.

I used crisco instead of lard, and these cookies were so DRY!  The only thing that saved them was the massive amount of cinnamon-sugar.  I don't want to give them a bad rating, though, because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  We've got a vegetarian.

Made these for my family but no one liked them because of the licorice flavor. Made a second time without anise seed and with pineapple juice, and rolled them into balls before baking because I just don't have the counter space to roll out dough. They were gone before the oven was cool. :)

I use solid coconut oil instead of lard, one gets the same texture as lard. Then I share with my healthier family and friends. Also the thinner roll makes for a better dipping cookie (in milk or coffee). Reduce baking time if thinner cookie is desired. Fantastico!

just like grandma/mom used to make, i now see why mine are different, i use shortening, still good but i bet the lard is the magic ingredient.  i also used spiced rum, it's what i had on hand, i think my mom used port wine?  regardless, these always bring back the most wonderful memories, i want to cry when i taste the first cookie, takes me back to my mothers kitchen as a little girl.

I did not have any Brandy in the house ~ so I used instead 1/2 C.of red wine plus 1/2 C. of fresh squeezed orange juice (these ingredients are common variations to traditional biscochito recipe's instead of using Brandy), also I used Butter Flavor Crisco instead of Lard and they turned out really good! I have used Lard before and as I live in N.M.that might be the preferred old fashioned way to do it (which I have) but I think the Butter Crisco gives them a lightness in the batter. These cookies get dusted with cinnamon/sugar before AND after baking - cooled on a wire rack - I would highly recommend this recipe -I only tweaked it slightly but this recipe is A KEEPER!! Great Dunkers in coffee OR milk =]
P.S. I DID sift the dry ingredients

I had never heard of biscochitos (I am a NM transplant) but was asked to make some.  Searched here and found this recipe....followed it exactly as written except I subbed orange juice for the brandy.  DELICIOUS!!!!   So easy...turned out perfect from the first batch to the last (I made 4).  This is now an annual tradition!

I've always wanted to be able to make biscochitos like a family friend made when I was a kid, and as soon as I smelled this dough, I knew this was it! To match my memories I used cream sherry instead of brandy, and 1 teaspoon anise extract instead of whole anise seeds. I also rolled the cookies in cinnamon/sugar while they were hot to get the texture and appearance I was looking for. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. They were AWESOME and just how I remember them.

SIMPLE, QUICK & DELICIOUS! These were lovely. I whipped them up to take with us on an outing. I never knew lard-based cookies could taste sooooooooo good!. My family loved them. I cut up my dough with a pizza cutter to save time. But I got my daughter to roll them in the cinnamon sugar when they came out of the oven. I will make these again. GREAT RECIPE!

I'm from New Mexico and this recipe is very close to the cookies we had there at Christmas and special occasions.  The anise flavor was a little light to me, I will double it the next time.  I will definitely make these again!

I made this recipe with one addition. I added I teaspoon of liquid anise extract. They came out delicious! I’m a native New Mexican having grown up on biscochitos, these cookies really bring back memories. You must use the lard and brandy in order to preserve the texture and flavor if you’re going for “tradition “.

Very close to New Mexico's traditional cookie I grew up with.  Biggest change was adding more Anise! I made two different batches and doubled the Anise in my second batch and it was much improved. I might even try adding more next time, to see what the true amount should be.  I used lard in one batch and  shortening in the other. Lard has a distinct smell and taste, but honestly you be fine using either. Don't skip the liquor, brandy or whiskey are great options. The dough is rather dry, it's a simple fix. I slowly added a few TBSP's of milk (you can probably us any unflavored liquid) until it got to the consistency it needed to be.  Fun traditional New Mexican wedding and Christmas cookie! Enjoy!

I made these both with lard and second batch butter. Sent to my husband's work all from new mexico didnt tell which butter won. Also made with kaluha it was perfect. Although they were dry added kaluha till right consistency. I have made them several times. Covered with chocolate and white candy big hit. Recently rolled with small Reeses peanut butter cup. Yum oh and covered them with candy too. Love to kick it up a notch.

This is a great recipe. I actually followed an "authentic" recipe from New Mexico prior to making this one. Hands down this one was way better. I did crush the anise seeds with a spoon. I pressed them 10 times. This made the anise flavor stand out a bit more. Also, I didn't have brandy so I used orange juice. They came out light and crisp.  Delicious!

I made this for a group of native New Mexicans for a birthday party (I'm from Ohio), and they ALL said that these were the BEST biscochos they have ever had!! I half way melted the lard, used orange juice instead of brandy, used 1 tablespoon of anise extract, and rolled the dough in cinnamon sugar before baking!

My husband spent part of his childhood in NM so these are made annually. This is by far the best recipe that I've found. KEY to successful biscochitos is LARD and GOOD Anise seed! OOPS and don't forget the brandy!  The dough is soft but rolls out fine. Do not add more flour! (I was tempted)

Love these cookies.    I used vegetable shortening instead of Lard and ground Star Anise (1 1/4 teaspoons) instead of the anise seeds. They turned out great.

Have made these twice to rave reviews.   They are a not too sweet shortbread type cookie and the anise flavor is very subtle.    I did use Crisco instead of lard but didn't consider that too much tampering of the original recipe.

Coming from a Hispanic background, Bizcochitos are a holiday must.  We have used this recipe for years with regular flour and the cookies are a no fail.  However, we are gluten free due to inflammation and digestive issues.  I was worried but used a good gluten free flour on a one to one exchange and had the same wonderful results.  I did learn, however, that if you beat/mix the cookie dough too long that the cookies come out crumbly and dry.  This recipe is basically a shortbread recipe and the cookies should be dry but not crumbly.

I was born and raised in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They are not traditional shaped like that they were rolled out and cut slices into one side and roll them into the cookie forming little hoops, then baked. The cookies are supposed to almost melt in your mouth. Delious recipe, not correct shape.

So, my daughter leaves for school at 8:00 this morning, then texts me at 8:30 telling me she needs to bring a treat for her Spanish class today for "cultural day". I whipped up a half a batch of these, using half butter/half Crisco and OJ for the brandy. Nice little cookie, with just a hint of anise flavor. She was very happy when I dropped these off during her lunch period with a printout of the cookie's origin, thanks to Wikipedia!
