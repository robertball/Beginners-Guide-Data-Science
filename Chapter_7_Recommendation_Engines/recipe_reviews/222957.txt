This is a great start to an amazing recipe!  We had some gigantic zucchini when we got home from vacation, and needed to find SOMETHING to do with them!  I browned and drained one pound of Italian sausage and a small onion, added the cooking creme and half a can of petite diced tomatoes, stuffed one giant zucchini (after I removed the seeds and microwaved the halves for four minutes), topped it all with mozzarella, and baked it for 35 minutes at 350.  It fed our family of five and we all LOVED it!

Very flavorful. If you want to do as a main dish, I added half a pound of cook ground turkey that i seasoned with a little garlic and salt and pepper.  When the turkey was done, I mixed the tomato and basil cooking cream in with the ground turkey and filled the boats.  and finished the recipe as its listed.  Will make it again.  My husband LOVED it!!

I was looking for something different to grill, side dish/veggie wise.  This was perfect!  Easy too.  I couldn't find the tomato basil flavored creme so I used italian herb and cheese, it was still good.  I do think I used too much of the creme cheese (I didn't pay attention to the qty in directions)... next time I won't add so much.  But, I will be making this again!  Looks fancy too, would be good for company.

I changed this recipe a lot. I didn't use the tomato and basil cream, parsley or shredded cheese. What I did was pan fry butter, onions and minced garlic for about 5 minutes. Then I added 3oz cream cheese and 1/2 a can of black beans.  I hulled out the zucchini and used this mixture instead. Delicious??

This s a great base recipe. I could not find the creme, which I don't like sun dried tomatoes anyway. For the "stuffing" I used cream cheese, Rotel with green chilies, minced homegrown garlic and shredded Italiano mixed cheese (Parmesan, Asiago and Romano). I also seasoned the zucchini halves with salt and pepper before stuffing them. I use a charcoal grill, so got it up to 450 degrees and put them directly on the grill for about 15 minutes. I made four medium zucchini for four people and we ate every single bit of them and probably could have had more! I made grilled shrimp and pineapple skewers to go along with them and it was a perfect summer dinner. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this as a main meal for my husband and myself.  LOVED it.  Very filling.  Next time I think I will add either cook ground beef, sausage or turkey.  But personally I would eat this as is and skip the meat - with a meal like this I could become a vegetarian. lol

Very pleased. I used this recipe as the base starting point with what I thought was a zucchini bat, but ended up being an immature spaghetti squash (from a volunter plant that sprouted in my summer garden). Ha. Still came out great--just had to cook longer. Also, I cut it the wrong direction (oye vey), so had to brush the sauce on (useing up some creamy pesto sauce), then fill the last 5 minutes (with tomato/cheese). Pics are before went into grill and when came out.
