I had only 3 summer squash to use up so I halved the recipe.  But I still used an entire onion, which I carmelized in olive oil instead of steaming.  I highly recommend carmelizing the onion and also leaving the squash al dente instead of mushy.  I also used the whole egg.  I didn't have a "sleeve" of Ritz crackers so I had to estimate with club crackers.  Since I had used a whole egg, I used enough cracker crumbs to make the whole thing come together.  I also used Cheddar cheese with black pepper which made the whole thing spicier.  I really enjoyed this recipe and will make again. Thanks!

Delicious and easy recipe! I sliced the squash and onions in the food processor and then placed in my microwavable rice/vegetable steamer and microwaved on high for 10 minutes. I added 1/4 teaspoon of salt and freshly grated nutmeg. I crushed the crackers in the food processor and added 1/4 cup of butter. I added 1/2 of the crackers to the filling and 1/2 were sprinkled on top along with part of the cheese. Beautiful golden color was achieved after 25 minutes.  Thank you Northerngirl for sharing your mother-in-law's recipe.

I didn't pre-cook squash.  I added slices of pre-cooked Italian sausage and a grated carrot to make it a complete meal and used Club crackers.  My husband loved it and said it was one of the best 'from the garden' recipes I've ever made!  The dogs eat the leftovers and devoured them.

It was quite tasty if a little bland.  I added carmelized onion, thyme and a bit of red pepper flakes.  After that it was great!

This was surprising good, for as easy as it is to prepare!  I will definitely keep this one in our rotation.  It is very good with yellow squash one zucchini or combination of both.  I'm wondering if anyone has tried it using chayote.  It sounds like that would be really good too, and recipes using chayote squash are difficult to find.  Thanks for posting this!  Great dish!

I made this with a bunch of squash a friend have me from her garden but one of then had very tough skin and I messed it up. Should've peeled that one. So the tough skin ruined it but other than that it was delish and I'd definitely make it again!

Loved this recipe! I cut it in half and used 3 larger sized squash. I did as others suggested and caramelized  my onion and saut√©ed the sliced squash. I didn't add any salt or pepper to the sour cream and egg  mixture  but will for sure next time.  I will add more cheese also. I thought this turned out really good but my husband just thought it was so-so and needed more flavor. I am excited that I get to have all the left-overs to myself!  Thank you for an awesome recipe  it will be made often during the summer  while my garden is producing! YUM!

I did not carmelize the onion, but I added three serrano chilies and that really spiced it up.  We loved it.

I made this because we have soo much squash from our garden and wanted something different.  It is really good! I baked it in a 13x9 dish so it would not be thick. It came out great!

This was a hit in my house.  I didn't add the crackers.  We are diabetic and don't use much crackers and bread crumbs.  I cooked the onions and squash in a pan with a lid.  Added salt and pepper.  And used Hooped Cheese.  Yummy. Will make it again.

My husband hates squash but I made this recipe and he loved it. I didn't have enough yellow squash so I threw in a few zucchini that I had and it turned out great! I'll make this again for sure.

I scaled this down a bit as only 2 of us...I ended up using zucchini as I had plenty on hand.  I sauteed the onions and added 1 clove of fresh garlic to the onions at the end of cooking.  I only had club crackers as well...all in all a very yummy dish made this way, - thanks for the inspiration to enjoy my squash!

This recipe totally rocks.I had to tweak it to accommodate what I had in the fridge and pantry and used Greek yogurt and Panko instead of sour cream and crackers. I also used two eggs--just because I wanted to and it was absolutely wonderful! My daughter, who is WAY into healthy eating went back for seconds...later thirds.

It's ok as it is. Would be good for someone on a low sodium diet. But it needs salt and pepper, more crackers or bread crumbs. The sour cream was a bit too much for me.

I used half summer squash and half zucchini, and I also saut√©ed the onion and squashes instead of steaming them based on the recommendation of others. I added a clove of garlic because I love it. I was able to smash the veggies with the edge of a wooden spatula once they were soft. It was yummy, and I‚Äôll make it again for sure. I also only added the crushed crackers to the top as a personal preference.

This is fantastic. I am trying to eat more vegetables and planted yellow squash this year. When it started coming in, I was overwhelmed. What a fantastic use for the yellow squash. I made it for a party and the dish was licked clean! I would like to try it with the caramelized onions though...great substitute for a potato dish!

This was a wonderful summer meal.  I did caramelize the onions in olive oil as was suggested. I did not precook the summer squash, just sliced thin and added 10 additional minutes to the cooking time. Hubby says this is a keeper.

I was hoping this would be one of those magic recipes that seemed ho-hum, but wasn't.  Well ... it was ho-hum.  Usually, I love squash casseroles.  This was just quite bland & the crackers became wet crackers & didn't add any flavor.  I see quite a few added spices , bacon, ham & other ingredients.  'Seems like a different recipe then, but I'm one to change things, too.  I'm not complaining.  Maybe croutons would be better than crackers.  Mayyyybeee.  :)

Really good. It does need a pinch of salt and pepper though, or else it comes out a bit bland.

My wife made the exact recipe. We both  thought it was just okay. She would not make it again or serve for friends. The taste was bland and mushy.

I loved this, I used a 2 qt dish, used 5 medium squash, about 1 1/2 cups sour cream, 2 lg onions and 2 eggs. I also used 2 1/2 -3 cups of the cheese. I salted the sour cream and cheese mixture. After I mixed the squash with the sour cream I layered the squash then cheese then squash again. I also melted butter and poured over the top of the crackers. It turned out great. It is the closest to my mother in laws that I have found. My granddaughter loved it to and she doesn't like squash.  I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe - even my hubby who doesn't like squash liked it.  I added probably another 1/2 sleeve of crackers because I felt like I had a lot of squash, but that was all.  It was delicious.

Even my squash-haters love this recipe! The only ingredient I change is that I will occasionally add some minced fresh jalapenos for a little kick.  I do half zucchini and half squash, as well. Do caramelize the onions. Use bacon grease to saute the veggies instead of steaming them. It's just better that way.

I had 3 large squash. Sauteed with the onions in olive oil. Added salt, pepper, butter, and 1/2 cup corn. This made a whole meal. Trust me, there were no leftovers. I had never had squash before, this is a keeper recipe.

excellent baked squash casserole. Wouldn't change a thing. You may want to make a larger portion when having company because it goes fast and everyone comes back for seconds.

This was good enough I would make it again. I didn't have as much squash but I reduced the other ingredients accordingly and it turned out fine. I think next time I would not only mash the ingredients but chop them somewhat.

This was a wonderful way to use up some of those squash that seem to multiply overnight this time of the year!!  I did saute' the squash and onion in my cast iron skillet with butter until fork tender (not mashable).  I think the onions starting to caramelize add SO much flavor to a recipe.  Other than that, everything was exactly the same, and I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Excellent side dish!

Needs more eggs than the recipe, but everything tastes so good together.  I baked it inside the bbq outside, so it didn't heat up the house.

What do you do with all your summer squash?   This is the question.   Well here's your answer.  This recipe is so good! 
 I did caramelize the onions as other posters suggested.   I added 1,garlic clove (because we love garlic), then saut√©d the squash for a brief time instead of steaming.   Mixed it all together and BAM!  Deliciousness!  Hubby raved about it.   Oh yeah the new squash recipe.  I am going to try zuchinni next.

I made this tonight and my 15 y/o son says "Outstanding"
He's pretty picky about vegetables, but he had 3 servings of this one. I put mine in the microwave for 10 minutes, stirring after 5. Then drained off the liquid prior to baking. I baked at 20 minutes at 425 since it was in the oven with some chicken. Mine was not mushy at all and turned out great, maybe for the ones complaining of mushiness,  just try a little higher temp.

I also halved the recipe, keeping 1 whole egg, & followed It's A New Day's advice to caramelize the onion. Wow, the onion added soooo much to this dish. The dish as a whole is not very flavorful, tho, so others comments make me wonder what I'm missing. Literally all I could taste were the onions & crackers. Maybe it was just my yellow squash in January?? I almost wish I had fried it in butter or bacon grease & added seasonings before mashing it all up....IDK but I'll try this again when I have some garden fresh squash too & certainly update my rating if it does turn out to be an issue w/the squash!

A yummy way to use summer squash. Seasonings were added as this would be bland for our tastes without any. Omitted the cheddar cheese on top thinking it might be too dry since only having 2% milk sharp cheddar cheese. Instead of that, after baking, garnished the top with grated Pecorino Romano cheese and thinly sliced green onions. The tangy Pecorino cheese really gave this a nice finishing touch. Anyone liking this recipe should try ‚ÄúUnbelievable Squash Casserole‚Äù on this site which is similar and also very good. Thanks Northerngirl.
