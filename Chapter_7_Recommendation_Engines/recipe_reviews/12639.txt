I'm a professional pie maker and have used this recipe for years. Produces a flakey brown crust. When you add the water and mix slightly transfer all ingredients to plastic bag and finish mixing in bag and store in refrigerator. This eliminates handling too much.

My mother was an excellent pie baker.  This is the crust recipe she always used and it's wonderful!  I had lost it through the years, so I really appreciate having it again.  Thanks!

Wow!  I come from a long line of women who are known far and wide for their exceptionally bad pastry, and I definately fit into the family tree.  I have tried dozens of pastry recipes and at best they resemble soggy cardboard or old shoe leather.  I have made this recipe twice now, and both times it's been nice and flakey, just like my MIL makes!!

This was a great pastry crust.  Did use lard instead of shortening - did they have shortening 101 years ago?  WARNING - you will not be using the entire 1 1/2 water!  I used my food processor to pulse the fat and flour into crumbs - it really helps to have your fat cold when making any pastry.  After assembling the pie I used some of the left over egg / vinegar / water to brush the top crust.  It worked out really nicely for chicken pot pie.

This was okay. It's pretty flaky, but lacking in flavour. I would make it again, using part butter. I did like the way the bottom crust held up to my juicy blueberry pie, not at all soggy. As well, it rolled out really nicely (I rolled it out between plastic wrap, no addtional flour needed).

this dough was sooooooooooooo greasy!  Yes it was fine to work with but....not cool with the amount of shortening.  I used half of the mixed wet ingredients called for. Anyway...I went at it again with my own proportions (to use up rest of liquids) and with 1/2 the shortening and it was much better.

this isn't exactly great for flakey pastry puff kind of dough, but it's really good for the bottom of savory pies.  i use it often.

The first time I made this, it didn't turn out so well, but I tried it again with the leftover liquid, and it was extremely good and flaky! I had to use closer to six tablespoons of liquid though, not four, to hold the dough together properly. Mixing in the bag helped a lot. Thanks for that suggestion!

This is the same recipe passed down from my g-g-grandmother who used it in her restaurant.  She used it to bake pies for the original Bob Evans before he become famous.  They were family friends & neighbors.

I use this recipe for all my pies now.  It is easy, flaky, and holds up well for liquidey pies.  Don't add too much egg/vinegar mixture! That will leave the batter tasting very eggy and not flaky.  Add just enough that it holds together.
