Amazing and so easy!  I used cauliflower (had no broccoli) it was like an enourmous cauliflower au-gratin, but with chicken.  I added 1/2 cup milk to the sauce - perfect, had no horseradish, so I added 1 tablespoon djon mustard and garlic to taste.  I also chopped the chicken, cut cooking time to just 40 mins.  The last 10 mins I put about a cup of grated cheese on top and it went brown and bubbly.  Excellent over rice! Even the picky 2 year old ate it (he loved the saucy chicken and rice)

Perfect recipe for a Monday!  I used some suggestions from other reviewers to make this average meal even better.  I doubled the sauce, using cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup, 3-4 heaping Tbs. of horseradish (we're big fans), sliced mushrooms, and minced garlic.  Next time, I'm adding sliced waterchestnuts for some needed "crunch".  Served this over chicken flavored rice.  Scrumptious!

great starting point!  I made the following changes - used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can cream of broccoli soup, and added sauteed whole mushrooms and garlic to the broccoli.  My husband RAVED about it.  thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Quick, easy, and tasty. The only change I will incorporate the next time I make it, because there will definitely be a next time, I will use fresh broccoli.  I also tripled the amount of horseradish and added cayenne pepper because I like my food spicy. T

This does live up to it's promise of being a nice break from spicy. However, lack of spicy doesn't have to equal boring, which I found this suffered from a bit. I would really recommend increasing the sauce and sprinkling some sharp cheese on top before baking.

This was a great and a very simple recipe but I did make one change and that is I used minced garlic instead  of the horseradish. I would make this one again!

I wasn't happy with how runny this was.  We ate it for dinner that night, chicken was rather bland & veggies to soft.  I was asked not to make this again.

Great flavor!  I did add two cloves of pressed garlic, and pepper to spice it up, but I will definitely make this again!  So quick to prepare, great for a day you don't want to cook!

I have to repeat my previous comment - that I put my veggies in while they were still frozen - and they did not come out mushy.  Second - you can spice this up all you want - as in the description at the top - certainly add more spices or horseradish if you can't taste it!!  Happy Cooking!  PS - All recipes will no longer let you leave a comment without a rating - they used to!

I thought this recipe had possibilities so the 2nd time I cooked, I made some changes to the recipe.  I doubled the soup & sour cream.  The main change though is that I substituted Gulden's mustard for the horseradish.  My family liked it better with the mustard than the horseradish.  I'll probably experiment with how much mustard to add.

This was pretty good, and really easy.  DH, who hates horseradish, liked it.  I served it over plain boiled potatoes.  The sauce was excellent.  I think next time I'll put a parmesan/breadcrumb topping on it.  I don't know...I just think that sounds good.  But this is definitely a keeper.  Thanks Expat.

This was very easy and tasted great.  I used two cans of soup because I like a lot of sauce.  I will definitely add this to the dinner rotation.

My husband loved this!  The only changes I made were to use horseradish mustard- then doubled the amount called for, and used a fire roasted vegetable blend for the bottom layer. (roast potatoes, broccoli, green beans, red peppers and onions from Schwann's- Made the dish taste even better and looked pretty, too!)  I'll be making this one again!

This was a nice diversion from the typical "chicken divan" recipe I normally use.  I doubled the sauce ingredients as recommended.  It was tasty and the entire family liked it...a feat in itself!

This was very easy and tasty!  I doubled the  sauce as everyone else had suggested.  I did use regular horseradish and maybe could have even used more!  However, I think I put in too much sour cream...Served over rice and everyone devoured it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Extremely easy and tasty! Like others suggested I added more horseradish. Next time I'm going to try adding a little white wine to the sauce, since it was pretty thick.

Super simple! Great starting place for a quick & easy dinner. I used milk instead of sour cream and added mushrooms and black pepper. Served over orzo was an excellent choice.
For next time, I would take other suggestions and either bake au gratin or with cheese. Perhaps garlic would be a good addition too.

even with issues below, this turned out to be a nice safe non-descript meal.  very easy.  i added a layer of fresh spinach and some herb cream cheese to the sauce b/c i had it.  i thought the sauce was way too thick, and added some water at the end, covered the whole thing in foil and rehydrated my veggies a little.  i also doubled the horseradish but couldn't taste it at all.  although good, it didn't stand out and i doubt i will make again.

For me, it's Don't Want to Cook Wednesday! I only had fresh broccoli so I steamed it in the microwave til al dente'. Mixed a bit of good cheddar in with the soup. On top of everything a good sprinkle of my homemade Cajun Spice; we like everything spicy During the last 5 minutes sprinkled on some french fried onions. It was well received & it's one of those recipes that is easy to play around with according to your tastes.

Tasty and easy to make. I used vegetarian chicken patties since I don't eat meat and it worked out just fine!  I did add some garlic powder to the sauce as well as some fresh ground pepper just to add a little more flavor and I served it over rice which made it quite filling!

Super Quick and Super Easy.......I love horseradish so I added more for a nice kick.  I also used frozen green beans instead of broccoli.  My family enjoys egg noodles so I served it on that.  I will be making it again soon.

This was really good, but I had to make some changes.  I would have loved to use horseradish, but I didn't have any.  I used 2 heads of fresh broccoli, white onion,and fresh mushrooms.  Laid chicken breasts on top of that, then mixed in a bowl 1 can cream of broccoli soup and 1 can cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and a dash of milk.  I spread that on top of everything and baked it for exactly one hour.  I served it over brown rice.  I think next time I will use horseradish because that sounds so yummy!

I had to substitute the cream of mushroom, for cream of chicken, and instead of broccoli, I used Mediterranean mixed vegetables (squash, new potatoes, carrots, and zucchini ).  I also topped with a little Tex mex cheese mixture.  Everyone loved it!  We will definitely make this again.  Super quick and easy!

Excellent - super easy to prep ahead and just stick in the oven for an hour.  My entire family loved it and it was so easy!!!

Family enjoyed this recipe.  I made it as written, except doubled the soup, sour cream and horseradish.  Next time I'll probably increase the sauce by 1/2 of each as it was pretty soupy (but still good).  After reading other reviews I also added some shredded cheddar cheese on the top, and cut the chicken breasts into large bite sized pieces before cooking, and served over brown rice.  I would make this again, would be good to add cauliflower as well.

I did not care for this recipe. Heat horseradish and all the hot disappears.

Great recipe! Only made a couple of simple changes.  Added 1/2 a small bag of mixed veggies on top of the broccoli, added garlic instead of horse radish, a little ground pepper and added some sharp cheddar on the chicken for the last 5 minutes.  Husband couldn't stop raving!

Great recipe. Only Add some horseradish mustard. My husband raved about it. Next day Reheated leftovers in oven with great results. Thanks for this one!

I made a heavily modified version of this. Crazy easy. I only had enormous whole chicken breasts, so I cut them up. I used various fresh veggies instead of frozen broccoli (fresh broccoli, fresh radishes, mushrooms). I didn't had condensed soup, so I made "gravy" using chicken broth, milk & cornstarch and I didn't have sour cream, so I used whole fat plain yoghurt. To add kick, I may have added a few packets of salsa verde from taco bell... I baked it per the directions. I also made brown rice to go with it. It was SO good. Next time (because there WILL be a next time), more veggies, more sauce, and maybe cheese added the last few minutes...
But it was delicious as it was. Also, enough for leftovers for our lunches today.

This was OK.  I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken turned out surprisingly moist.  However, we did find this to be a bit bland.  If I tried this again, I would double the sauce ingredients and serve this over cooked rice.

This was a decent meal, but I doubt I'll make it again.  One good thing about it was that the chicken was still tender even after an hour of cooking.  It was very easy to make, too, but none of us were very impressed by the flavor.

I don't get why people are raving...? The horseradish got drowned in the rest of the sauce, and the broccoli was mushy. I'd be willing to try experimenting with more spices, hardier veggies, and maybe different soups.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time, we liked it but the broccoli was overdone and mushy. The next time, I left out the broccoli and added it in during the last 15 minutes. It was perfect! I made a full recipe for the 2 of us so we could have it again later in the week, but my husband insisted on seconds!
