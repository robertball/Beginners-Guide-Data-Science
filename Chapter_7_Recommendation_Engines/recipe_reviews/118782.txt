These are very tasty indeed!  Some observations/changes:  rather than the tomato sauce, I added 1 tbsp Worcestershire suace, 1/4 cu ketchup, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp cumin to the ground beef.  

We don't have a convection oven, and the buns turned out better on the top rack.  When baked on the bottom rack, the bottom of the buns burned faster than the tops browned.

Finally, these were tasty with ham/cheddar, turkey/provolone, and bacon/egg/cheddar as well... those of you from the South: think kolaches.  

  Update: I made bacon, egg and cheese buns last night -- excellent.  To make a more biscuit-like dough, substitute 3/4cu. self-rising flour for the same amount of the original all-purpose flour -- works  great.

These were really good! I did season up the hamburger mixture a bit. These could probably be filled with anything and be great. They reheated well in a 350 oven for 20 minutes too.

I followed the bun part of this recipe exactly and the dough was too wet to handle.  So I had to add a quite abit of flour to it to make it workable.  I used hand and cheese for fillings and I added some warm milk mixed with cornstarch,garlic powder,oregano and parsley flakes to the filling in each bun... just a tiny amount. It took care of the overly runny/oily cheesie filling problem.  Everyone gobbled them up.

The dough was fine, but when it baked, it was really crumbly ... actually, it was kinda like a biscuit ... it was okay, but just okay ... thanks!

Followed the bread recipe exactly, but I didn't make the meat mixture. Instead, stuffed with ham and cheese. They were very good but browned very quickly. For that reason, I would reduced temp. a bit next time. Otherwise, pretty terrific recipe!

This is a great dish for kids.  Adults will probably find it edible, but not their first choice.  You want to make your kids happy for a meal, make this.

MMMM MMMM Good! Definately will make again. You can put anything in the middle: roast beef and mozerella cheese, chicken and bacon with ranch, etc. Very delicious!

Great recipe. I used butter instead of the shortening and did have to add more flour than called for. Dough was super easy to work with and tasted great. I changed up the meat. I used ground turkey and seasoned with worchestire, a little wing sauce, s/p, onion pdr, italian seasoning and chili pdr. They turned out fabulous. Excited to try different fillings.

I only made the Bread part. I have been looking for a yummy bun and this was it. I am a little upset I cut the recipe in half and I wish I didn't. They are so good I need to make more for dinner now. Thank you :0)

Very yummy bread dough.  I used my bread machine and had to add about 1/4 cup extra flour.  It was still a very sticky dough but it rolled out just fine.  The reason for 4 stars is I thought the filling would be a little bland so I made the Neat Sloppy Joe recipe from this site and used that to fill the rounds.  Baked for 13 minutes, turned out perfect.

I love this recipe! I just use my own recipe for whole wheat bread and make the dough in my bread machine. That makes it much quicker and tastier, I think.

I make these frequently.  Substituting ingredients for the filling insures that no one gets tired of them.  They're perfect for the family on the go, as they freeze well and are perfectly warm and defrosted after about a minute in the microwave.  Sometimes I use cheddar, chopped pepperoni, olives, and spaghetti sauce for pizza pockets, ham and provolone, or Italian sausage and mozzarella.

These are wonderful.  Takes a little bit of time to make them, but they are worth it.  They freeze well.  To spice them up just a little I like to add 1 tablespoon of taco seasoning.

This was awesome! The bread was so soft my husband was very happy with me. My two year old, who eats nothing but cereal even liked them. I'm loving it! I didn't use the filing but did turkey and cheese. Also filled some with pepperoni. And, because I hate using shortening, I used margine. Can't wait to try different filings, like the one with the recipe.

LOVED THEM!!  I think I'll add even more beef next time.  But these were so good and my whole family loved them.  They didn't take much time to make either.  Definitely made it into the rotation.

Made these today.  LOVED the dough.  It came out soft and pliable (mine was not wet as others have indicated).  I made mine in the bread machine then divided it up for the individual rolls.  As others have mentioned, I did spice up my beef mixture a little.  I doubled the meat mixture to us for another dish. To the tomato sauce, I added a can of tomato paste so that it wasn't too runny but added an extra kick.  Also added some Cajun seasoning, Worcestershire, and a dash of liquid smoke.  They came out perfect.

We loved these, but did change the meat seasoning from what the other reviews said... I used our favorite Hamburger recipe, which is, 1lb of hamburger, 1/4 of your fav beer, 1 Tbs of your fav BBQ sauce, 1 Envelope of Beefy Onion Soup mix... Normally we would mix all together and form into patties, but I just browned the meat then added the rest of the stuff and simmered... It was wonderful with Ketchup and Mustard on the side... YUM YUM

I have made this recipe many times over the last several years. This really is a springboard. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to the 'T'. I was not that impressed . . . it was good, but not great. So each time thereafter I simply play with different ingredients I have on hand and spice it up! Be creative and don't be afraid to try new ideas. Once your meat mixture tastes good to you, then finish the rest of the recipe.

Rating this recipe on the dough. It was perfect as is written. I did add slightly  a bit more flour. but was during the kneading process. I filled it with seasoned taco meat and cheese sprinkled a touch of cayenne pepper on the tops. Also filled with salami and cheese and pepperoni and cheese. sprinkled a bit of parmasean cheese on the top. Family gobbled them up.

One of my sons chose this for his Sunday night choice.  I was a little intrigued by the prodedure of "filling the dough",but once hands on it was very simple, my son did a great job too and the whole family raved.  I too, envision many other fillings for these very tasty little bites!

I've been making this recipe for years.  My kids love them.  I generally use ground beef, pizza sauce, minced garlic and onion, and mozzarella cheese.  However, I've done taco filling and and egg and sausage filling.  So many different options, just depends on your taste.  This recipe makes a lot and they reheat great, as well.

One of my kids favorites. Easy to heat up the next day for lunch too. I make the dough when I'm making my weekly bread so I only make one mess. I spray a little butter spray on top and salt them before putting them into the oven.

I love the concept and the buns themselves. The burger mix was just a little too bland for me. I tried a few filled with ham and cheddar and they turned out great. This recipe is definitly worth experimenting with.

Super good stuff! Made a double batch to have lots in the freezer for snacks. Any kind of filling can be put in these I imagine. I love the dough its nice and soft with a great flavor. These frozen stuffed sandwiches hands down.

I love the idea of this!  I made mine with a different filling (mini calzones).  I would have given it 5 stars if the author had included an egg and milk wash to help the buns brown nicely.  If you're reading this, take 1 egg and 1 Tbs milk; whisk and brush on before baking.

This recipe as is is WAY to bland! I was very disappointed with it. I do like the idea of the burger in a pocket though. Next time, I will probably use sloppy joe sauce or more spices instead of just the tomato sauce. I was very excited to try this one, but for me, it came up short.

This is a great basic yeast dough recipe - I started with the basic dough, and instead of ground beef and cheddar cheese, I stuffed it with shredded chicken, caramelized onions, and brie cheese.  They were delicious!  You could easily use any type of meat/cheese/veggie combination you have on hand.

The bread on this meal is wonderful. Hamburger did need to be seasoned. Will make again using a sloppy Joe recipe in side.

My family didn't really care for these much and I have to say, straight out of the oven, I didn't like them either. However, reheated the next day, ohhhhh my goodnes they were delicious! I took some of the leftovers to a relative and they reheated over the next few days and loved them also. I think next time, if I plan on serving right after cooking, I will use cheddar cheese rather than American because it seemed to be the cheese that was the less-than-savory ingredient when I served them the first time. Oh and I also added cooked, thick cut bacon (YUM). I will definitely make these again and experiment with different fillings. The bread was delicious and would go well with a ham and cheddar filling.

wow...the bun part of this is awesome. Very soft and delicious. I did the meat part my own way I guess...just seasoned it more and had to use ketchup instead of tomato sauce. Turned out pretty good. I'd love to stuff these with all kinds of other stuff though :)

I made these for my husband and his friends when they went to camp.  I made 2 batches, one filled with ham and swiss cheese, the other with sloppy joes and cheddar cheese...they all absolutely loved them!  They keep asking when I'm making them again.  Thank you, Nancy for sharing!

This is the same recipe from the 2004 Taste of Home Cookbook. Nancy, thank you so much for this recipe. I am glad I can finally tell you how I appreciate it. We had the same thing in church camp but back then we called them ZOMBIES, I don't know why. When I shared this recipe with my sister she was so happy, it has brought back fond memories for the two of us. Now my children make them with me. We have also tried it with chicken, green chili and jack cheese.

WOW! Thanks so much for this recipe! My family thinks it tastes like White Castle but better! My 10 year old ate 4 in one sitting! Recently I took one as my lunch to school and all my coworkers were so jealous of the smell and look they talked about it for about 2 weeks! They are worth any effort in the kitchen. And it would be very easy to double a batch and keep the left overs as a quick lunch or snack. You just gotta try this one and don't change a thing!

I love these! I have been making them for quite a while and they are always delicious. I use ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also season the meat with a little worchestshire sauce, garlic, tony's and hamburger spice. Delicious. Oh yeah and I made them green this time!

I have this recipe in my taste of home cookbook and it is really good.  They are very tasty, but do take a little extra time since you are making a homemade bun.  Mine also didn't look as pretty as the picture, but they did taste exceptional!  This also makes enought to feed an army. You may want to 1/2 the recipe.  They reheat well. I also did half with cheese and half without because my husband is lactose intolerant and wanted his without cheese.

A deffinate keeper. Made these last night for the family and they all said they were great and when was I going to do some more.
Took notice of the reviews that said these were bland and added garlic, some mixed herbs and a couple of fresh basil leaves to bring out the tomatoe flavour.

I love this recipe. So versatile!  I did the dough in my bread machine, sprinkle in more flour if it seems too wet.  Here was my filling, which was a huge hit with the guys:  I did a regular one-pound recipe of taco meat.  I added in a can of well-drained diced tomatoes. That was my filling along with chunks of cheddar cheese and a dabble of Ortega taco sauce inside each bun.  Turned out perfectly, soft bread and tasty filling.

These are amazing! The dough on this is perfect. We put in half wheat flour and half all purpose. Now my family wants to try to fill these with lots of other ingredients. Thanks!

These were really good. I OF COURSE did not let the dough rise long enough before I filled and baked them. My family was hungry. So next time I will make the dough in advance. My 3 year old loved them and my Husband said they reminded him of calazones. I will put pizza ingredients in them next time, or as others suggested, ham and cheese.

These turned out exactly how we were hoping.  I did not use the Tomato Sauce, I used the suggestion of a previous reviewer of ketchup, Worchestire, cumin and garlic powder.  Next time I'll cut the dough recipe in 1/2 and that should still be enough with only 1 lb of beef.  Very kid friendly served with smiley fries!

My family loves this recipe.  I do make some changes though.  I think that the amount of dough for each bun is a little excessive, so I just make them smaller.  Also, the beef mixture is a bit bland.  I like to spice it up a little.  I usually add mustard and ketchup, plus a little seasonings, maybe garlic powder, more onions, even some spicy Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning.

I like these fresh with jack cheese.
They are ok if you freeze them...just ok.
I try to avoid using too much liquid since the bread gets soggy.
Cheese kept running out of the buns..

These are fantastic! My kids LOVE them! I make them at least 2 times a month. My family would like them every week! My husband does not like the tomato sauce so I make his with out the sauce. He dips them in mustard!

not good.  i skipped the filling altogether and made sloppy joes.  the dough - while easy to work with - lacked flavor.  i'm going to use the remaining dough and try a bacon/egg/cheese filling.

My husband just bought me a KitchenAid HD Professional stand mixer & I had to try this recipe out.  Pretty simple to make, filling needs more of a kick to it.  Might try with sloppey joe filling & provolone cheese, or similar.  These reheat well and seemed better the 2nd day.  Like making your own hot pockets - thanks!

This recipe is from Taste of Home magazine, and it is SOOO good. Everyone eats them up in my family including my toddler!
