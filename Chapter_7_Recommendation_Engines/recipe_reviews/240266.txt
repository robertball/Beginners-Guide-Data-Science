This is going to be the stuffing I use from now on.  It was very very good.  I did stuff the turkey with it and it was fine.  I don't know why all the gluten free stuffing recipes put it on the side of the turkey in a baking dish.....great!

This was soooooooo good!!!!!! I wasn’t sure about the apples, but they were a great addition. I wouldn’t change a thing, it was perfect as is. Thanks for a great recipe!
