Wonderful! I had to change the recipe to use less mayo (about 3/4 cup) and then coated the cakes in extra cracker crumbs to help hold it together.  My husband and I prefer them broiled than fried (broil for about 8 min).  My husband even wanted me to make extras for his lunch the next day, he said it was even better after the flavors had melded! I will try making the mixture a day ahead next time!

Loved the recipe, but changed it a little. Instead of buttery crackers, I used Keebler's Multi-Grain Club Crackers and added a half a cup more. (Started with a serving size of 8)  I also crushed them as fine as possible.  Then I used a muffin pan and added the mixture to foil cups in the muffin pan and baked them on 450 for 20 minutes.  My family loved them!

These were really good. As suggested I used less mayo, added alittle old bay and patted on panko crumbs. Stayed together perfect and had a wonderful delicate taste. Thank you!

This were still a little bland for my taste. I will try them again. I cooked them in the oven and they were nice and crispy still and also stayed together. I just expected more flavor. Next time I will add some garlic and some red pepper..other than that it's a good base recipe to work with.

Everyone loved these!! I brought them to a dinner party and they disappeared in a flash. I took some suggestions from other review....I added a little garlic powder, reduced the mayo to 3/4 cup. I also broiled them for about 8 mins instead of frying them. And I used spicy horseradish mustard rather than the yellow mustard!! I made a little dipping sauce with mayo, spicy horseradish mustard and relish too.  YUMMY!! Will definitely be making these again....and again!!

These had a great flavor after some minor adjustments but they seemed incredibly greasy to me.  I used less mayo as suggested and added a little cajun seasoning and parsley as well as adding a little Italian breadcrumbs.  I did pan-fry (with very little oil) to get them brown and then popped them in the oven to cook through, though I think next time I'll just bake them from the start and try using half the crackers and half breadcrumbs.  I might also add an egg to the mix to help bind the ingredients better.

I have made these 3 times since finding the recipe - and they are great!  I have used italian seasoned breadcrumbs with perfect results.  I also cut back on the mayo. As a dipping sauce, try mixing equal parts of dijon mustard, mayo, and green tomato relish - or pickle relish. YUM!

The taste is good, but like others said, it was too greasy using the the mayo and then frying on top of that. I got a stomach ache from the block of grease I felt in my stomach afterwards.  I salvaged the last two patties and baked them. Those turned out much better.  If I were too try this again,  I would reduce the mayo and absolutely bake it.

We loved the delicate flavor of these. They were perfect on the Avocado Mango Salsa from this site. I will be making them again but maybe use panko and make them a tad drier, we found them a little on the mushy side.

These were very good and the whole family loved the flavor, but they were slightly mushy on the inside.  I added minced garlic and red pepper and cut the mayo down a bit.  I didn't fry them, I broiled them and turned once. Will make again but maybe bake first.

Hey everyone! I gave this dish a 4 because as far as taste goes, it topped the charts for me. But when it came to frying the patties, it was a bit messy! I substituted the crackers with smashed doritos, puff cheetos and panko bread crumbs. If you do it this way, you may want to omit the salt ingredient. Next time I will add egg too. This may help in keeping the cakes together. But overall they tasted great and I will more than likely make more soon.

Will not be making these again.  Maybe I missed something, but they were mushy and would have been somewhat tolerable with Bay Seasoning instead of hot sauce.  We went out for pizza as the family couldn't take it. First time ever.

These were great! Lots of flavor. I also sprinkled Old Bay Seasoning on top and instead of frying them I just cooked them in the oven. Will definitely make again.

I had some leftover cooked shrimp and used them to make this for dinner last night. With a little tweaking based on previous reviews, less mayo, more crackers and seasonings--I used garlic powder, Old Bay seasoning, pepper and parsley--, they turned out fantastic!! Even my picky daughter loved them and she's not a big seafood fan. This is now on my keepers list and I'll be doing them again soon. My husband can't stop raving about them.

This recipe had so many mixed reviews, however the comments about the flavor intrigued me, so.... I decided to cut the recipe and try it on myself first. I revised it a bit. I used approx a half pound of shrimp, with a heaping Tablespoon of Mayo, a squirt of mustard, a 1/4 cup of chopped onions, 12 crackers, old bay seasoning, pepper, parsley, 2 tbsp of hot sauce, garlic powder, Tony's Seasoning. Covered the bottom of a glass pan with a thick layer of olive oil and baked at 450 for about 20 minutes. It was delicious and crispy. Yum!

Wonderful recipe! I made just a few changes though. I used less mayo, only 1 jalapeno pepper, seasoned bread crumbs and cayenne pepper instead of Tabasco sauce. I also broiled the cakes for 12 min on the middle rack and added a dipping sauce made from mayo mustard and relish.

I read lots of reviews and tried to follow the best instructions for getting them to bind, but to no avail. I made them without an egg, thinking that if I baked them at a high temp, they would hold together. Should have gone ahead and added the egg, I suppose. They looked great when I took them out of the oven, but as soon as I tried to move one, they fell apart. I tried cooking them a bit longer, but was worried about the shrimp overcooking...it was definitely on the borderline...and yet, they still fell apart. Trying to salvage my meal, I decided to just eat them anyway, but the crackers and other ingredients just tasted mushy and weird and the shrimp did not shine. Sorry, but there is just too much wrong with this dish to make it worth trying again.

I followed the receipe as written and used the amount of oil called for, which was way way too much, and the patties just fell apart. Mayo just turns to oil also and there was no binder to hold it together during cooking at all.  To the remainder that was in the bowl, I added breadcrumbs and an egg and the last batch did hold together.  I made this as a side dish for grilled steaks along with a southwestern potato salad and thank goodness I had the potato salad.  We had all the family over for Father's Day -- will never ever make this again.  At least I was able to salvage the last part of the "batter". I really wouldn't give this a 1 star rating, but I have to select a rating.

These were very good.  I did a few things different though.  I added old bay, and I used Dijon mustard.  Had a great flavor, but they did fall apart.  I just couldn't get them to stay together.  The flavor was just so good the fact that they fell apart didn't even matter.

Not sure what I did wrong, but the cakes fell apart and I had a skillet full off pieces.  Not sure that I will try this one again......

I am a big fan of crab cakes, but these were even better.  These were excellent!  Cheaper to make than crab cakes too.
I did however, omit the parmesan cheese, cut back a little on the mayo, used whole wheat Ritz crackers and added chopped italian parsley.  I also added a little bread crumbs to the mix and rolled the shrimp cakes in bread crumbs before frying.
I will definately put these on my "make often" list.

These weren't a hit with us, unfortunately. The mixture was incredibly wet and sloppy, and I didn't want to add too much additional crackers crumbs because it would take away some of the shrimpy flavor. The mixture did not hold together well either. I'm glad I gave them a go but it turned out to be a bit of a waste of ingredients. Thanks anyway.

Awesome!!! I didn't have any jalapeno so I used a little extra onion, hot sauce and chili powder.  I will definately make this again, but with a little less oil in the pan or I may try broiling them.  Thanks

Had some leftover shrimp and just eyeballed the ingredients until it tasted right. Added a bit of Old Bay and I was a happy camper because this was so darn good. Thanks!

This recipe is a keeper!  A nice flavor and easy to make.  As suggested by other reviewers, I reduced the mayo to 3/4 cup and broiled the cakes.  A big hit at dinner tonight!!

Note sure about the original recipe as I followed most of the reviewers suggestions. I cut mayo to 3/4 cup, added garlic and red pepper. I also substituted almond flour instead of breadcrumbs and added one egg.

I am rating these 5 star with the understanding that I substituted red pepper flakes for jalapeños.  Will definitely make these again.

Very good, I also reduced the mayo to 3/4 cup and used breadcrumbs, used old bay seasoning and sprinkled the parmesan on the top when done cooking.

I had a very difficult time getting the patties to stay together and not burn (I tried various heat levels); I'm guessing it's because of the amount of mayo. I'd follow other user's suggestions and reduce the mayo. If that doesn't work, add some more crackers. I do have to say that if you cook the shrimp prior to combining with the other ingredients, this makes a GREAT dip without frying! I used bell pepper instead of jalepeno and omitted the hot sauce so that my kids could eat it, and it was so delicious as a bread dip! I just wish it'd held together better when frying.

Made these for dinner tonight.  Pared down to two servings (mistake #1) and baked in the oven.  Mistake #2 was using too much olive oil in the oven - should have just greased the pan.  The flavor was delicious and I'll make again.
