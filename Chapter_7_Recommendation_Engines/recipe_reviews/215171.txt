This is a very good recipe, but I found that two things make it a bit better. 1) If it is a bit tart, adding up to 1 Tblsp of sugar helps.   2) Before adding the ice, if you can refrigerate the mixture overnight, the mango scent and flavor intensify IMMENSELY.

Mango is on sale here this week so I bought quite a bit and we're in danger of losing them. I used buttermilk (use or lose kind of situation--I tried buttermilk in another smoothie recipe and we really liked it--you should try it, too!) and chunked frozen bananas instead of ice cubes instead of ice for added thickness and fruit. I doubled this for my boys and I and it was just enough for all of us. Very tasty!

Great smoothie!  What I liked best about this recipe is that it called for less yogurt than most - enough to give it some thickness and creaminess, without giving it that noticeable sour tang. While I did have fresh mango on hand, I decided to use frozen and I'm glad I did - I do notice that using frozen fruit does make a difference in making this super cold and refreshing. While I liked the addition of the vanilla I'll either reduce the amount next time or omit it altogether - there was enough in the vanilla yogurt and I think it may have detracted a bit from the full mango flavor. Also, since I used frozen mango, I think I'll omit the ice cubes next time too - Hubs and I both like our smoothies thick. The slight changes I'd make to this recipe in no way is a criticism of the recipe, but only a matter of personal preference.  I loved this nice change from the typical berry smoothie!

This turned out pretty good no sour taste from the yogurt..:O) Next time I would use frozen mango in place of fresh to keep the drink colder..as I prefer very very cold drinks I added extra ice :O) YUMMIE!!

I love this smoothie! I believe it's the best smoothie recipe I've ever made at home & I am now obsessed with mango! I added vanilla flavored protein powder since I wanted it to be a meal replacement shake, but other than that I didn't change a thing.

This smoothie was delicious! The only thing I would do differently next time, is I will get frozen mangos instead of fresh. The fresh was just too much of a pain to peel.

A little odd that I would have such a difference of opinion, but I just didn't feel this had any flavor at all.  I didn't find the vanilla overwhelming, because I didn't taste it, nor did I taste much mango.  It was a bit like just drinking water with a bit of mango flavoring.  And I did make it as is.  I ended up adding a bunch (about 1/3 to 1/2 cup!) of orange-mango-peach juice *concentrate* to give it some flavor.  I don't know if it's too much milk or what.  I do see the review of someone saying to refrigerate overnight to bring out the flavor - but if I want a smoothie, I'm generally wanting it now - not the kind of thing I'm waiting overnight for.  Sorry.

This was really good.  However, I did have to add more Mango, which turned out WONDERFUL.  After I add'd more, it was much better.  I also used frozen, not fresh and the ice wasn't needed, I used only skim milk, no ice was needed.

This is simple and delicious. I used one whole mango, chopped, which was about 1 1/2 cups. I did use 1/2 cup of yogurt (one small container) and 1/2 cup of skim milk. This is one of the creamiest smoothies I've had. Thanks for the recipe!

It was good, but not great. I added 1/2 cup of citrus punch to give it a little more flavor.

Very tasty since I love mangoes. However I did have to up the milk to 1 cup, I used 1/2 c of frozen vanilla yogurt and skipped the ice cubes.

Great! Super creamy without that overwhelming fake sweetness. Perfect texture: I substituted frozen mango for real mango and left out the ice cubes. adding a pinch of sugar helps! Loved by all in my house, I'll make this again

Very refreshing.  I used frozen mango chunks so decided that omitting the ice cubes would okay and still keep the drink cold.  Other than that I followed the recipe and was very pleased.  It turned out quite creamy and with a nice mango flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

The vanilla is overwhelming in this recipe.  I froze my mango and omitted the ice.  Next time I will omit the vanilla extract.  This would be a really good smoothie without it. ***Edit - next time, omitted the vanilla flavoring (and ice cubes) and used mango I had labeled and stored in the freezer. Much better without the vanilla! The mango comes through now.

Definitely thick and creamy, but the mango flavour is overwhelmed by the vanilla components. I used two cups frozen, chunks of mango thus adjusting both the milk and vanilla yogurt to about a cup of each. I only used about half a teaspoon of the extract as I read other reviews stating that the vanilla taste was overwhelming. We omitted the ice. I think using a plain yogurt or omitting the extract would easily remedy this situation. Nice consistency though.

Very good.  I used 1/2 cup vanilla  yogurt and 1/2 cup milk.  I did not add the vanilla extract with using the vanilla yogurt. I also did not add the ice cubes, but the smoothie was not very cold.  My husband also liked the drink.  I will make it again but I will make it earlier, to put it in the frig to get it colder before serving.

I thought this was rather bland. Luckily, I was able to fix it up some. I added a little coconut cream, a tiny bit of sweetener and a little extra milk as I used partially frozen mango. That made it much better.

I used plain Greek yogurt because I thought it would be too sweet if I used vanilla yogurt, and this was a good sweetness for me. I didn't add ice cubes because I used frozen mango, but this made is too thick for my blender (Oh to have a Vitamix!) so I added more milk (I used skim). This made a great, healthy, fast lunch for a busy day. Thanks!

I highly recommend using frozen fruit and leave out the ice cubes (they become rather unnecessary if the fruit is already frozen).  I added 1 tbsp of sweetened condensed milk, just for fun.

We love this smoothie. When making this decadent smoothie, I always double the recipe. I changed the recipe a bit to our liking. I used frozen mangoes, I did not use vanilla extract because the vanilla yogurt was enough, and added 3 tbl of sugar because it's rather dull without it. And since I used frozen mangoes, I omitted the ice cubes. Thick and delish!

It's mango season here in South Florida, so we are always looking for recipes to use them.  This is a simple and delicious recipe.  I just eyeballed the ingredients and put them in the Vita-mix, and in  about a minute, we were enjoying a cold, creamy and refreshing smoothie.  This recipe is a keeper and can't wait to try it with other seasonal fruits.

This is MY GO TO SMOOTHIE out of all ! I DON'T add ice substitute & use frozen mangos instead and it REALLY DOES NOT MATTER FOR YOGURT . It can be plain or mango flavored yogurt or than vanilla... Rather those two works for me lol.

I made it using all ingredients listed but I don't usually make anything following exact measurements. I just saw I had all ingredients on hand so I threw them, without caution (LOL),in the blender and viola! My son loved it! I used frozen mango chunks instead of adding ice. It came out super thick and creamy ????

Amazingly delicious and easy to make a tip is to use fresh mangos instead of frozen it makes it creamer oh and4cubes of ice instead of 3 but it is so yummy. I love it!

Just what I had hoped for - thick,  refreshing, creamy, flavorful smoothie.  Mango was super sweet to begin with, used fresh.  Subbed soy milk, frozen yogurt.  Used Mexican vanilla and a pinch of kosher salt.  Added 3 ice cubes.  Perfect!

I didn't have fresh mango so I used frozen, then I cut out the ice due to that. I doubled the yogurt and cut back on the milk to make It really creamy and also doubled the vanilla. All in all it was very yummy

Very good smoothie! I made a second batch and froze it in popsicle molds. I used 2 cups of milk,  frozen mango, and no ice cubes. Very creamy and thick.

Beautiful . Just the right blend. Very smooth. Add more yogurt if you like a thicker consistency

Really, my biggest problem with this recipe was its thickness. Definitely make sure you use fresh mango since it's juicy. Also, I added about a little over a 1/4 of pineapple juice. And it is a little tart. I used a dollop of honey, but a pinch of sugar would work too.

I bought a large container of sliced and ready to eat mango at a warehouse store and this recipe looked great. I left out the ice since I am not an icy smoothie fan, and increased the yogurt to 1/3 cup so it was a bit creamier. I am very pleased and will make again!

I have already tried this recipe just a little differently. I actually used 1/2 cup of plain fat free yogurt, 1/2 cup fat free milk and frozen strawberries and banana bites, a little bit of ground cinnamon, and a little bit of sugar, and I did not even have to use ice with it, the yogurt made it have a very good consistency. I also added some almonds to it, I don't know why, but I like it when I have something to chew. All that gave me only one serving.

Great! I love trying new smoothie recipes and especially with mango. The vanilla extract adds a great taste:)
