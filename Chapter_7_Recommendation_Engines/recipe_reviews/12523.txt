Addictive! I've made it 3 times so far but I followed the suggestions gived by Krpayne. As she suggested I used 3 eggs, 3/4 cup of baking mix, 2 1/4 cups of milk and 2 tsp of vanilla. I took it to a family dinner and everyone loved it! Maybe this recipe should be written up again with these changes and called something like "Ultimate Impossible Pie"  thanks Krpayne ;)

A very easy pie that taste good, but I would not use it for a special meal.  It is not fancy enough for holidays; I think the appearance and texture are more suited for every day.  I do agree with one review about the egg taste although it wasn't bad! When I make this pie again, I am going to try and use one less egg, an additional 1/4 cup of baking mix, an additional 1/4 cup milk, and an additional tsp of vanilla.   Hopefully this will help the texture be more smooth not so "eggy".

I tried this recipe w/ the modifications that were suggested by Krpayne and it was absolutely an Amazing Coconut Pie.  Next time I make it -- I'll use coconut extract instead of vanilla.  While the pie was delish...it was more egg custardy and not as coconut.  I submitted a picture of this pie, it actually came out very pretty, golden brown.  I also only baked it for 50 min rather than the recommended 60 min.

I have made this many, many times.  I add the coconut at the end and just pulse to mix, pour in the buttered pan, then add another cup of coconut on top. That way there's plenty of coconut throughout the pie (preventing that eggy-ness) and it also gets a boost of flavor from the deeply browned top crust of nicely toasted coconut.

I have also recently started using gluten free pancake mix instead of Bisquick with no problems.

p.s. BUTTER makes a difference in the pan for browning on the bottom. I use pyrex.

I was skeptical about using a baking mix for the self-forming crust due to its saltiness.  But it turned out fine and tasted wonderful!  I used the Reduced Fat Bisquick and skim milk - no problems.  Also, I baked it in a French White 10-in. dish instead of the pie pan.  It came out looking nice and provides more servings.

This recipe has also been in my family for years. It is fast and easy. I'm not sure why some of the other's didn't find the crust. The only difference that I saw with my recipe is that I use 1 1/2 tsps. of vanilla. I also use bisquick mix and you can use butter or margarine in this recipe.

I have been making this pie for years and my family loves it.  One slight change in the ingredients is the butter should be melted not softened.  Also, for those who had a problem getting a crust -- my recipe calls for all the ingredients to be put into a blender and blended on "high" for a minute.  I have always had a nice bottom crust and the blender may have something to do with it.

I read all the other reviews first, and made a couple changes.  I only used 3 eggs instead of 4, and it still tasted "eggy" but in a good way.  I also added an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  The pie does form it's own crust on the top and the bottom, but the bottom crust is thiner and soggy due to the custardy filling that's created.  The flavor was good...not overly sweet, but I think it needs a thicker consistency.  If I were to make it again, I think I'd add more bisquick because the pie was barely an inch thick. With one or two more changes I think it would be excellent.

I wouldn't call this pie amazing.  It was just a little too eggy for me.  I really thought that it would taste more like coconut.  I even substituted coconut milk for regular milk, but the eggs overpowered everything.  I also didn't have crust.  It was like custard on the bottom and coconut on the top.  I will not make this pie again.

We really liked the pie, but the "makes its own crust" part is misleading.  It does form a biscuity, coconutty crust on the TOP of the pie, but nothing on the bottom.  Still, it's very good.

someone needs to rename it to...Amazing Coconut Breakfast Pie ....
"This pie is easy to prepare and it makes its own crust."

But It is not what you think of when you
say pie...It is more like an coconut egg
omelet. It is very good but It is not
something you would serve to guess as come on over for ...pie and Coffee...
But it would be a great breakfast or 
brunch.... Served with cut fruit and
cream cheese bagels.... Or breakfast
night supper... With a nice fruit
salad.... this was really good... JUST DON'T THINK PIE.... LOL

This pie is awesome.  I did make some changes as suggested by other raters  - 3 eggs, 3/4 c baking mix, 2 1/4 c milk (used skim), 2 teaspoon vanilla and topped the pie with about 1 cup of coconut after I poured it in the pie pan.  I didn't use a deep dish pie and it fit fine.  I also covered it with foil towards the end of the baking to prevent it from browning too much.

Excellent! I hate to admit it but I had low expectations for this recipe.  I don't mind saying I was wrong.  I didn't use a blender as suggested by the other reviewers, but whisked the batter very well, also I used pancake mix in lieu of the baking mix. My husband and I loved it.  This will be a go to recipe when I want a great dessert that is easy to prepare.  Thank you for sharing.

I love this pie served warm with some whipped cream! My mother made this for me when I was growing up, so it has always been a favorite. She would mix up all the ingredients EXCEPT the coconut in the blender, pour into the pan, then mix in the coconut. So easy!

I've made this many times. My recipe calls for putting all the ingredients in the blender, pouring it in the pan and then sprinkling the coconut over the top which toasts the coconut. Comes out good every time.

Yum!  Easy, not too sweet, and very coconutty!  I think if I made it again I'd make a caramel sauce to go with it.  Not because it really needs it but just because.  Thanks for sharing this, Kiana!

Very simple recipe and it looks/smells very nice.  I used KRPAYNE's suggestion like so many others.  Still, this was too eggy.  The pie tasted like a sweet egg custard to me.  The crust did work very well though.

This gets 4 stars becasue it is just so simple and easy to put together with a very smooth taste.  I made a few modifications for anyone looking to cut out the dairy- I used soy milk and egg beaters and gluetin free pancake mix instead of a regular baking mix.  I put 1 cup slenda sugar and 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar ( I LIKE IT SWEET) cinnamon sprinkled on top... too good.  But does anyone have a suggestion on how to stop it from cracking when I take it from the oven and it cools of?  I put a picture up of the finished product.!! Enjoy..

I wanted to give this a 4 star but I just can't get myself to.  The taste was ok, but after this cooled and when I cut into it, it was still a bit runny inside.

I had this recipe my husband brought back from a fishing trip in Alaska. I lost it and found this version. Mine was you mix in blender without coconut for 2 min. Let it set for 5 min. Pour into the pan and put coconut on the top.Fabulous pie. Family and company favorite.

I just made this pie for the first time.  Excellent!   Very easy to make and quite tasty.  It makes its own crust which is a plus indeed.  The next time I am going to add about a 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple.

I made the recipe as in the original directions and it came out great with a crust even...  I would try the variation though ... would like a little more crust.  Also I drisled hot fudge over the top of it to dress it up.  Going to make it again today and try strawberry jam instead of the hot fudge.

I followed what prior reviewers suggested - three eggs, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon of coconut extract, and adding the 1 cup of coconut at the end. It's easy and fantastic. Tastes great cold or warm. Always a hit!

I used to make this pie back in the 70's. It came out great back then. I just put one in the oven about ten mins. ago. I am hoping it is as delicious as it was way back in my teenage years! I'll let you know...

I've had this recipe for years but we call it custard coconut pie. You need to make sure that you mix it well together so that it will form the crust at the bottom. It's a soft crust on the bottom not like a regular pie crust that you roll out. Yes, it's eggy but that's custard!

Excellent.  To the other reviewers who thought it was "too eggy".  Four eggs - DUH.  It is a custard. Make sure you blend well.  That is key to a getting decent sepration between the custard and crust.  Try using a food processor.

We enjoyed this and it was easy to make.  Maybe not the best choice to impress guests but good enough for a weeknight treat.  I didn't see a "defined" crust, but it did hold together just fine, as a pie should.

I just love this PIE, but I cook it in muffin pans , and to serve it I top it with whipped cream it tastes great and i do like the more revised version, 3 eggs 3/4 cups baking mix, 2 1/4 cups of milk and 2 tsp of vanilla.

This is my all time favorite pie.  So easy to prepare, and it is not so sweet that it gags you.  It is just perfect and if you really want to it is good with just a dab of whip cream.  You will not be disappointed.

This was amazing!I used 5 eggs and reduced the milk to 1 3/4 cups. The top crust was crisp and lovely. The texture was perfect. This recipe is a definite keeper, and so easy!

I have tried this recipe twice now and was convinced that I was doing something wrong. Now that I've seen other reviews, it appears I am not and this is just the way it turns out. Both times my pie was way too eggy. Shame, too, because it bakes up beautifully. I'm going to try it with the suggested substitutions and see if that helps. My co-worker, who I had taste test it, says I should try it with no eggs and see what happens. Definitely will be playing around with this some b/c, on paper, it sounds amazing.

It is somewhat eggy, but my main objection to it is that no matter how little Bisquick you add, it still comes out heavy, like cake, rather than pie.  It's much better eaten warm before it's refrigerated.  After that it needs to be microwaved to soften it up a little.

This recipe made me ask,"where's the crust?"
Mine had no crust!! It was just like a custard pie with no crust!! It tasted really good though, and it came out of the pan fine....did I misunderstand about the crust??
