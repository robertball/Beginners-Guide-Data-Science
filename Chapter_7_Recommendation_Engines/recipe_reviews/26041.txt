My daughter made several cakes for the county fair, and this was one of them.  She made it in a tube pan and increased the baking time (I think about 50 minutes?).  She won a blue ribbon and class champion for Jr. Specialty Cakes, so I would say that's a pretty good recipe.  She "taste-tested" one on my coworkers before we make the "good" one for the fair, and everyone loved it.  Her grandmother says it froze well, too.

Holy cow was this recipe ever awesome!! The cake came out moist and tastey.  I added chocolate chips to the streusel topping.  I think next time I make it I will try it without the streusel and just ice it.  Fantastic!

I made this cake yesterday and it turned out moist and fluffy.  I did a couple of things different; cream the sugar with the butter and peanut butter, instead of mixing the sugar with the flour mixture.  It made for even mixing.  Also be sure to mix the wet ingredients well before adding to dry mixture.  I also didn't use the streusal topping, just made a simple chocolate frosting instead.  I like this cake because it was so fluffy and wasn't too rich, just the perfect amount of flavor.

This cake was actually the first cake I've ever made from scratch, and I was quite impressed with the results. I did, however, change a few things. I made this cake in two 9 in. round pans instead of in a rectangular pan. Because of this, I baked it at 350 degrees for 20 min. instead of 375 for 30 min. I also added a tablespoon of vanilla to the batter. Like another poster stated, the streusel was much more like cookie dough than crumbly streusel. I had to add it by hand so that I could make sure it was broken up into pieces. I reserved some of the streusel mixture so that I could spread it around the sides after the cake was done. I'm happy I did, because after baking, the streusel on top of the cake looked beautiful, but almost blended in with the flavor of the rest of the cake. Next time, I think I'll do what other posters did and cook the streusel on the stove top and add it to the cake after it's done baking or go with some chocolate frosting as I can see how chocolate frosting could probably bring this cake together nicely. As for the moistness of the cake, mine came out odd, where it seemed like a mixture of moist and dry. It would seem moist when I first put it in my mouth, but dry after it sat in my mouth for a while. My husband said it was more moist than dry, but he's a cookie lover, so anything moister than a cookie, he'd probably call moist :)

The recipe was certainly simple enough, but that is the only thing it has going for it.

I am a huge peanut butter fan, but this recipe was lacking for something.

It came out like a very large, dry peanut butter cookie.

I was very disappointed in this recipe and will not be making it again.

This was Ok.  Seems like it was missing something.  It looked pretty and was moist; just lacked flavor...and I'm a peanut butter lover.  Not what I had anticipated.

This cake was AMAZING. I made it for my grandfather's birthday because I know he likes peanut butter pie. The only thing I did different was add chocolate chips on the top, and it was delicious. I did have to bake it about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe suggested. The cake was very moist and not too much peanut butter state, which was great b/c I generally hate a strong peanut butter taste.  My family LOVED this recipe, especially my boyfriend who's hard to please with cake recipes!  :)  I will DEFINITELY make this again!

This cake is so yummy. I actually used it in the center of a peanut butter and chocolate ganache cake. It turned out wonderful and is perfect without any kind of frosting. The streusel makes it extra good. I never thought a peanut butter cake could be this good.

Well, what can I say, this IS the fluffiest and most moist cake that I have ever baked. I did not use all the strousel topping, I just baked it seperately on a frying pan, and ended up with a nice soft sweet thing. I over-baked the cake a bit (35 mins) it caused some of the strousels on the top to burn. I removed the burned strousels by hand, and no problem. My mom and Dad loved it. I used normal white sugar instead of brown sugar, and crunchy peanut butter instead of creamy peanut butter, and no problem at all. Thanks for this wonderful recipe

I did'nt change anything came out wonderful. For us it was like having a giant soft pb cookie ohh so good. Did have to take it out a few mins early as my gas stove bakes things a little faster. I think next time I'll try cupcakes. My son's 15 birthday was a hit with a giant reese's pb cup cake. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This was good! I used a cup of whole wheat flour, which made it a little dry. Also, I would have used a 3/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup less brown sugar.  But it was still great!

This cake was ok. It was sorta dry. It almost reminded me of a coffe cake. Maybe a big peanut butter cookie. I dont know... It tasted good, but I guess was looking for something different!

I made modifications to recipe to lessen number of servings. I forgot to lower the cook time. My cake ended up cooking to long and therefor it was dry. Cannot blame anyone but myself. The cake and the topping had good flavor.

I love peanut butter and I did'nt think this cake was going to turn out very well since I must have used too much liquid and it took longer to bake but it was wonderful. I used a whipped cream with chocolate sauce  and colored sprinkles for a festive look. My husband loved it. Thsnks so much for this recipe.

I was a bit hesitant to try this cake...it seemed like half of the reviews said how moist and fluffy it is and the other half said it was much to dry. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but mine was very dry!! One thing that was good, I iced it with chocolate icing as another reviewer suggested. It was like a yummy reece cup! Oh well..I won't be making it again. I'm giving it three stars because the dryness must have been something I did wrong, but I followed the instructions to a T.

This was actually the first cake that came out really baked from my new oven :-) I do not like the taste of peanut butter (it is sort of salty and sweet at the same time...), but this cake was wonderful. It was moist and very, very rich. I used white sugar instead of brown. It was alright even after a week in the fridge...

well, this was good, but i changed it a little. i poured the batter into two round cake pans and cut the baking time in half. i used the struessel topping as the filling between the layers. Mine however did not resemble a struessel topping, it looked more like cookie dough. I then frosted with chocolate frosting. To be quiet honest, with out the chocolate frosting I probably would not have eaten my whole piece. I was really loking forward to this, too because I love peanut butter.

My husband loves peanut butter, but can't have chocolate.  It seems most recipes that have peanut butter also have chocolate.  This was a great recipe--easy and flavorful.  I made it for his family and mine for his birthday--it disappeared quickly!

Dry, dry, dry.......I threw out the whole cake.  Yes it did have a good taste but not worth eating because it was so darn dry.  I do not recommend this recipe to anyone.

I used 1 cup white and 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also baked in two round cake pans for about 25 min and then stacked the layers. And I put semi-sweet chocolate chips in both the batter and topping (which I really think it needed). But it turned out really delicious. Kind of a crumbly cake if that makes any sense. Nice alternative to standard cake with icing. Great with a glass of milk.

Incredibly moist cake, even after a couple days! Definitely a cake for peanutbutter lovers.  My family thinks it needs something to cut the peanutbutter down a little (milk was required drinking with cake)...maybe a jelly filling or some chocolate sprinkled on top?

A little dry but tasty. I drizzled hot fudge sauce and peanut butter ice cream topping to make more elegant

this cake was ok-maybe would have been better with frosting.  I thought it was sort of dry. probably would not make again.
