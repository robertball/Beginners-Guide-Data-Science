This bread smells AMAZING while it's baking!  I made the following changes, used 2 cups white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, used applesauce instead of oil, added a teaspoon of vanilla and used 1/2 cup orange juice instead of water.  I baked it in a bundt pan since I only have 1 loaf pan.  It took 90 minutes to bake.  It smelled so good we could hardly wait for it to finish baking.  I let it cool about 10 minutes before removing from the pan and then sprinkled the top with a little cinnamon & sugar.  We cut into it immediately while it was still steaming.  YUM-YUM-YUM!  This recipe makes a very dense cake so if you're looking for something that is light and fluffy this isn't it.  My son suggested whipped cream would be really good with this and I agree.  Next time I'll serve with a dollup of freshly whipped cream.

I love this recipe just as much as the Downeast Maine recipe on AR.  Replaced all the oil w/applesauce and it made for a supermoist bread without the added fat.  I only had 2 cups of white sugar, so also added 1/2 cup brown. It was plenty sweet. Fresh squeezed orange juice replaced the water.  also added 1 tsp. vanilla.  I love the spice blend in this recipe; it does remind me of that pumpkin pie taste.  Used 2 cups fresh pumpkin.  Made 2 very nice loaves to freeze and 1 small 'review' muffin.  Very nice easy recipe. This would make a nice bundt cake.

I made this as written but with the addition of 1/2 cup of golden raisins, 1/2 cup dried cranberries and 1 cup of walnut pieces. I also made a brown sugar glaze for the top using 1/2 cup orange juice, 1 cup (loosely packed) brown sugar, 1/2 Tsp maple flavoring, and 1/4 cup of crushed walnut pieces. 
The yield was one loaf and one bundt cake. My family devoured the loaf and my office devoured the cake!! Everone raved at how amazingly good it was. Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I will be baking again, and again and again!!

We really like this recipe. The loaves came out beautiful.  After reading the other reviews we made the following modifications and it was very delicious and spicy.
2 c sugar / 1 c brown sugar
4 c flour
2 teas cinnamon / 2 teas nutmeg / 2 teas ginger / 1 teas allspice / 2 cups walnuts.  
Didn't need to top with anything.  But we did try it topped with whip cream or butter (whip cream was better!)  
THANKS!  Definately a keeper.

I knew I was going to like this recipe.  With minor variations it’s the same recipe I, like the submitter,  have used for over 40 years – so long I’ve long forgotten where I originally got it from.  It’s not an unusual recipe, but it makes an unusually good bread.   Unlike other breads, this is “just right” on all characteristics – just right sweet, just right moist and just right on the spices.  I would change absolutely nothing in this recipe.  It even rises up and shapes just right too.  I like mine with “stuff” in it so I added 2/3 c. of dried cherries (raisins or dried cranberries are good too) and 2/3 c. of chopped walnuts.  My pans were slightly smaller, 8-1/2 x 4-1/2” to be exact, which might explain why I needed more baking time, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.   But as the submitter directs, “bake until done,” no matter what size pan (or even muffin tin) you use – just adjust time accordingly.

I've had this recipe for more than 10 years now, and it's so great to make muffins with.  If you need a ton of muffins for cheap, mix this up.

My first attempt at pumpkin bread and it was fabulous! Super moist and delicious and completely fool proof. Brought it to a holiday potluck and it was gone in no time.  This is my new staple pumpkin bread!

This bread was so moist!  I made it in 1 loaf pan and 1 bundt pan.  The bundt cake I drizzled with a homemade white glaze (butter, milk, powdered sugar).  Everyone wanted the recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This bread is moist and yummy.
I often follow the recipe to the letter, and my family loves it. Sometimes I add 2 c. of oats and 3/4-1 c. of nuts. Yum!

I cut this down to 12 servings so that I could get 12 muffins. (We're HUGE muffin eaters in this house.) I used whole wheat flour, half the amount of sugar, homemade cooked pumpkin, organic eggs, I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder and doubled the spices. Instead of water, I used organic apple juice and I used melted butter instead of oil. This was a nice simple pumpkin bread that made a good snacking/breakfast muffin. This was really fun to make with my kids.

My first time making pumpkin bread and it was awesome! I made this recipe in a couple mini loaf pans and made mini cupcakes for mouth-popable snacks. My 3 year old can't get enough!

This bread is unreal!!  I am going to work on making it a muffin recipe but it is so sweet, so incredible.  We have a local restaurant that makes pumpkin muffins to die for and well this recipe puts them to shame...and they are the standard by which all pumpkin bread/muffins are judged!  The day after making the best pumpkin bread in the world I turned them into muffins.  They turn out just as well.  The only thing you need to know is, grease the pan…I used PAM to grease the pans.  If you are going for “regular” muffins they will cook for about 20-25 minutes or until a tooth pick comes out clean at 350 and “large” muffins take about 35-40 minutes.  I used a ladle to fill the pans, the large muffins take about 2 ladles give or take a smudge…and the “regulars” take about a ladle.  Basically the muffins pan should be 1/2 – 3/4’s full.  Additional notes – we can’t get 16 oz cans of pumpkin so I used a 15 oz can plus approximately a 3/4's of a 1/4  cup to get the “16 oz” can.  In my first baking I winged it and don’t think I put enough to make the 16 oz requirement.  If you are short they will be a little sugary…not that it is a bad thing.  Additionally when I make the mix, I put the sugar, eggs, oil together mix well…then I the pumpkin…then all the spices…then the water…then the flour.  They are amazing!!  Again these are the best muffins yet!  As I mentioned in the earlier review, there is a restaurant where I live that makes pumpkin muffins that all should be judged by, these e

Followed as written except used 1/2 c. oil + 1/2 c. applesauce.  Delicious!  Next time I'll cook at 340 for 65 min so the edge doesn't cook so fast while the center is still moist.

this bread was amazing! i doubled the batch and ended up with 6 loaves of bread. i ate two loaves in two days its that good! lol i did read alot of the reviews before making and decided to make some changes i used 2 cups sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. instead of 1 cup oil i used two of the premeasured apple sauce cups that come in a set of 6 and 1/4 cup of oil. i made my own pumpkin puree and used 2 cups of it. i used 1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and instead of water i used orange juice. some people wrote in their review that the top of the bread was dark so i cooked it at 330 degrees for 60 minutes and it was perfect! another thing i did was when i greased the pans i also floured them and it made it so much easier to get them out after they baked and didnt leave behind any bread crumbs. next time i will probably cut down on the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon since it was a little strong but it came out very moist and delicious!

This recipe was very good, made 6 mini loaves, although next time I may cut down on the sugar.   Also did not use cloves .....I made this again and cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups as some friend thought it was too sweet.  I think it is a great pumpkin bread and so did the other people I gave it to...

Very tasty! The whole house smelled good enough to eat! My only thing was I used applesauce instead of oil and the texture was gummy. Next time, I will stick with the oil as written.

Wonderful,  I also modified a few things. 2 cups white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar,  1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, orange juice in place of water, and 1 tsp of vanilla. It made 6 small 2X4 loaves and a 4 X 8 loaf. They were very tall pretty loaves. Made great Xmas gifts

I've never made pumpkin bread before and this was such an easy recipe to follow. I added a cinnamon glaze to one of the loaves using heavy whipping cream (about 10 tsp),1 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 cup of powdered sugar. The whole house had the aroma of Thanksgiving :) God bless!

Very good - I substituted a tablespoon + 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice for all of the other spices, and it turned out very well. However, I think I will up that to two tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice next time.

This was a delicious, simple and quick recipe to make. I had many compliments on it when I made it to take to work, and one taster (without knowing the reviews at this website) commented that it "tastes like pumpkin pie without the crust!" I laughed and told her about where I got the recipe and how it was described. One thing that I would change would be the level of the spices - I'd up the cinnamon and add some ground or crystalized ginger as well. A keeper of a recipe! I'll definately make this again.

I have been using this recipe for years.  Always gave it to my kids teachers as a gift.   One thing I added was raisins. To keep the bread moist with the raisins I always added extra water.  I have many, many times used fresh pumpkins also, definitely moist then.

This recipe was wonderful. The bread turned out delicious! Just what I was looking for. Only thing I did different was to leave out the allspice...I didn't have any in the cupboard. I will definitely make this version again.

I have made this 3 times so far, and it is always a huge hit in my house.  It disappears in days!  The only thing I have done differently is add a half teaspoon of ginger to the flour mixture and a teaspoon of vanilla to the pumpkin mixture.  Oh, and I add roasted pecans or walnuts (whatever I have on hand).

Fabulous bread - very popular with my family. I have made this bread two ways: (1) per the recipe and (2) with reduced sugar and whole wheat flour. My mother and several members of her family are borderline diabetic or diabetic. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup sugar substitute and left 1 cup of sugar out. I also substituted whole wheat flour. The bread wont be quite as tall, but doesn't taste any less sweet or any less moist than the original!

I made this last year and am looking forward to making it again this year. Sooo moisy and just the right blend of spices. I halved the oil and used 1/2 cup applesauce. Instead of making 2 big loaves, I made mini loaves and added raisins to some and pecans to others.

All I can say is -- WOW! Holy goodness. Due to various health considerations, I altered the recipe as follows and it was **TOTALLY amazing**: I substituted the 3 cups of sugar with 2 cups stevia-in-the-raw, substituted the oil with 1 cup natural cinnamon applesauce (with no added sugar or corn syrup), and substituted the 1/2 cup water with 1/2 cup fresh-squeezed orange juice. In addition, I added 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp fresh orange zest to the batter. The result? A sugar free, dairy-free, fat-free (except for the oil used to grease the pan), beautiful pumpkin bread that I will make again, again, and again!

This bread is delicious!  It also makes great muffins!  Since I really like this bread best when it is fresh, I usually put the batter into muffin cups and freeze them unbaked.  Then I just pull out as many as I want for a meal and cook them for 20 minutes at the same temp.  They're so good!

Loved it, but put a healthy spin on it.  Used the 32 oz can of pumpkin which also substitutes for the cup of oil.  For the flour, I used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 oats.  The other reviewer was right, only need 2 cups of sugar, 1/2 of which I used Splenda.  Added about a teaspoon of vinilla, increased the cinnamon and nutmeg, and added about a teaspoon of Jamica all spice.  It turned out very moist, and my family LOVED it, i'm currently making the second batch in three days!  It is actually healthy too!

This recipe is great. This is my second time to make it. The first time, I did it exactly as the recipe states, but brought my cooking temp. down about 15 degrees to ensure it cooked evenly since my bread pans are a little darker than some.  The texture and flavor, as well as the moisture of this bread is incredible. The second time around I did everything the same but also added a little sprinkle extra of each spice. Not enough to make it really stand out, but enough to accent the flavor a little bit more. Excellent recipe. All who tried the end result loved it and have asked to get a copy of the recipe.

This is good pumpkin bread.  Changes were: used 1 cup sugar, 1 1/2 cup Splenda, 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of the 3 cups sugar; 1/4 cup oil and 3 (3.9 oz) mini cups of applesauce; only had a 15 oz can of pumpkin so used that; mixed the above together with the eggs and then added the following spices: 2 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon as the only spices (plus the salt, baking powder and baking soda); then mixed the flour alternately with orange juice in place of water; used Pam to grease the pans; and made in 5 mini loaf pans, which baked about 40-45 minutes at 330.  After cooling for 8 minutes in pans, the loaves slipped out when held over the rack.  Wolnderful flavor and great as gifts this way.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this bread so good! I took some suggestions from previous comments and loved the flavor. Instead of the 1cup of veg oil I used 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce and 1/2 of veg oil and I used 1/2 cup of oj instead of water I dont know how this tastes w/o these changes but Im sure its just as good. By far my favorite pumpkin bread ever I actually craved it.

This was really easy and very good!  I have made it twice in the two weeks that I have had the recipe.  I tried making muffins, which were good but making it in a loaf pan makes for better presentation.  I am planning on making mini loaves for moist, delicious Christmas gifts.

I love, love, love this bread!  I've made it many times for many different people, and every person that tries it raves about it asks for the recipe.  I love that the recipe makes two loaves, so you can put one in the freezer and save for later.  It freezes and thaws really well.  I also made this for a friend who is lactose intolerant and she loved having a yummy baked good that did not have any butter in it.

This bread was very good; dense and flavorful.  I liked the suggestions about using applesauce instead of oil to make it more moist.  I found that I had to bake it longer that 60-65 minutes; I took it out and covered it at 45 and cooked it for about 30 more.  Overall, quite tasty!

This pumpkin bread is FANTASTIC with just a bit of spice!  I've made it three times and each time love it more and move.  The only thing I changed was adding Pumpkin Spice instead of the Cloves.   All my friends rave about this bread!!

It is not fair of me to really rate this, as I totally changed it..I had extra pie filling and no other pans, so I invented a "recipe".  Took 1 QT of pie filling, 1 c applesauce (instead of oil) 1 box white cake mix. 2 slightly beaten eggs, extra cinnamon and nutmeg to taste...Baked in a 13 x 9 pan at 350 for one hour...top split a little bit, but the end result was a moist cake and very tasty.  I will definitely try the recipe as it is written, as it sounds delish, too!

Delicious!  I substitute equal parts applesauce for the oil.  I also find that the breads take a little longer than the prescribed time, so adjust accordingly.  
Recommended additions:
1c. chocolate chips
or 
1c dried cranberries plus 1c walnuts.

This is a very good light bread.  I might add more pumpkin for a more heavier, dense bread and I will play around with it.  ***for pumpkin pie allspice- I added 3 tsp but I think it needed more.***

I made this recipe using "Pamela's Gluten Free Bread Mix and Flour Blend".  WOW!  The first thing I thought when I took a bite was "this tastes exactly like Starbuck's Pumpkin Spice Bread"!!  It's that good.  I did follow a couple of reviews and used applesauce instead of oil and added 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  I can honestly say that, unless I told you, you would have no idea this was gluten free!  A keeper for sure!!  Thank you!

This was an OK pumpkin bread. I followed the directions exactly, I just had to bake the bread longer than the 65 minutes (it took an hour and fifteen minutes). I will probably keep searching for a better recipe.

This recipe has gone a long way toward dispelling the myth that I'm a bad baker in my household. It is simply amazing-- like something I would get at my favorite restaurant. I followed Barbi's advice exactly, except that my applesauce was cinnamon-flavored. Because of that, I reduced the amount of cinnamon by a tiny bit. However, I actually think that if you wanted to, you could increase the amount of spices in this recipe. If you are used to a really spicy bread, then you will definitely want to do that. However, I think it's just delicious as-is. It's the texture of this cake that really makes it work. It's dense enough that it cuts and holds together like a dream, but also moist and spongy. I highly recommend the bundt pan method and cooked mine for about an hour and 15 minutes. The best part is that the outside crust gets nice and chewy in texture, which contrasts so well with the moist inside of the cake. I let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes and then sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar. I whipped some cream flavored with powdered sugar and vanilla, spooned that onto a slice of cake and sprinkled that with a garnish of cinnamon. My husband went crazy. This cake has fulfilled all of my fall pumpkin dessert dreams. And then some.

This bread was flipping AWESOME. Everyone who tried it loved it and wanted more. I only made half of the amount due to the fact that I only have 1 bread mold, but this bread is so good that I'm debating buying more so I can make this in massive amounts next time! SO amazing. Didn't even need to add butter to it. TIPS. Read the site's article regarding "Quick breads." I used an aluminum foil "tent" above my bread and it worked really well. Also, I use WESSON 100% Canola oil for baking and it makes my breads/cakes delicious. My friend recommended I use it a while back and I will not use any other oil when a recipe calls for oil. I want to make more of this bread!!!!!!!!

Very good, its delicious! I added a little more spices and also 3 oz more pumpkin. Used Applesauce instead of oil and orange juice instead of water (like other users recommended) and it came out great. Next time I will probably make 3 loafs instead of 4. These were very tall and didnt seem to cook all the way through. I originally put it in for 65 minutes, then an extra 7. They seem a little too moist. I made pumpkin cupcakes and they were also this way, but the next day the were even better because they dried up a little bit (not too much they were still moist and delicious) We will see when I have a piece tomorrow for breakfast =)

i really really liked this recipe. so did my family. i recently found a new best buddy and he loved it. it was good way to make a good first baking impression. although i subbed smashed pears for the oil, baked it 30 minutes without foil and then covered it for the rest. oh, and took it out 5 minutes early. totally made it amazing soft and moist.

This was the best pumpkin bread I have tasted in a long long time.  My sisters went nuts, and that means something to me because they are awesome bakers.  I did alter the recipe slightly to my liking.  I don't like cloves or allspice so I added a 1/2 teaspoon more of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  It was extremely moist and the nuts added a wonderful texture to the bread.  Was a big hit and would definitely make this again.

This is my favorite quick-bread recipe ever!  After reading other people's reviews, I've tweeked the recipe.  Instead of 1 Cup vegetable oil, I put 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 applesauce.  It still comes out nice and moist!  To kick up the spice a notch, I add 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice on top of all the other spices called for.  And instead of water, add orange juice.  Also, I reduced the sugar to 2 3/4 Cups for less sweet loaf.  And voila - a lowfat pumpkin spice bread with an extra kick!  :)

Made for the night before thanksgiving to enjoy with hot choclate. We all loved it. I think the spices were just right for our delicate tastes. Added a little raw sugar on top just so it would sparkle. Will be making often.

Yummy! I followed this recipe exactly, I just doubled the cinnamon. I also baked the batter in a bundt pan, and the presentation was great! The only thing I can find wrong is the 1/2 teaspoon of cloves overpowers the other flavors. I will use much less the next time.

This bread is AMAZING! I made it for our large Thanksgiving gathering and it was requested by everyone for Christmas. I used 2 cups white sugar and 1 cup brown as suggested by other reviewers but that was the only change I made.

Supremely moist and delicious.  I used "spiced pumpkin butter" and substituted 1/2 of the sugar for Splenda Baking sugar for more spice and less calories.

This is the best pumpkin bread I've ever made!  It definitely reminds me of pumpkin pie when eating it, the texture is beautiful, and the smell in the kitchen was fabulous.  The only change I made was replacing half the oil with plain yogurt to cut down on the fat.

I followed the recipe almost exactly as written except using 2 cups of white sugar with 1 cup of brown as suggested by others.  I guess I should have taken more suggestions because I thought it could have used a little something extra.  The bread was very moist, but I think adding nuts and/or dried fruit would have added a different texture.  I also will add a dash more of each spice.

If I make this again, I will definitely make the changes.  I would love to give this as Christmas gifts!

My family loved this bread.  I will make it again, just as the recipe is.  But I will make sure to line my bread pans for easier removal.  Even better the second day if it lasts that long.

Absolutely delicious. I used the OJ in place of the water and 1 cup packed brown sugar in place of one of the cups of regular sugar as suggested and YUM! I will try the applesauce next time, but I did not have any this time. Will make again and again.

I made this using applesauce instead of oil (same quantity).  The loaves turned out beautifully and the house smelled like pumpkin pie.  My family ate one loaf for dessert.  We heated thick slices in the microwave for a few seconds and served with a bit of ice cream on top.  It was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

taste wise this was 7 stars but we did not like the texture.. too moist and dense for us. I followed the recipe exactly but I won't make it again. I did like the spice combo and will use those again when I try a different recipe.

Made this for a potluck and had some batter leftover for a few muffins. Couldn't stop getting great reviews on it :) I substituted 2/3 of the oil with apple sauce and replaced 1cup of the sugar with 1/2 cup brown (this is still on the sweet side, going to try 1-1/2 white sugar + 1/2 cup brown next time). Absolutely fantastic. Yield: 1 bundt pan (80 min) + 8 muffins (baked 25min)

I don't know if I did something wrong, but this came out really dense.. and the flavor was just so-so. It was good, but I probably won't be making it again.

It's very good bread, altho I wish the top part of the loaf was a little hard.  I took the other reviews into consideration- I used an extra of: 
1/2 tsp cinn
1/2 tsp nutmeg
1/4 tsp cloves
1/4 tsp allspice
I used 1/2 c OJ instead of water.  For me, this recipe made 1 loaf and 20 muffins.

I'm not good at baking, but made this for the first time and turned out pretty nice: tasty, fluffy.....yummy. Added some chopped brazilian nuts. Will do it again (next time I'll probably use a bit less of sugar). Thanks for sharing, great recipe!

Great tasting & very moist! I didn't have nutmeg in the cabinet so i just doubled up on cinnamon & added another half of allspice, mostly cause I just love cinnamon! I also used more like 20 oz of pumpkin because I love the flavor. Instead of making 2 loaves, I split it in half and made a loaf for a gift & 12 muffins for breakfasts on the go. Just divide into muffin tins & bake for 10-12 minutes or until done. Just don't overbake or they become dry.

THIS is my new pumpkin bread recipe. It's moist, soft, just the right blend of spices. I doubled it and got four loaves, plus 6 large muffins. The muffins and one loaf of bread were devoured by my family and the other three loaves we gave away as gifts. All who recieved a loaf said it was AMAZING!!! 
Only adaption I made was to use a homemade pumpkin puree, which I make every October and freeze for future use. For this recipe, the thawed puree had enough "juice" that I did not need to add the water (at the end of the recipe), and the breads came out super moist. 
I will definitely be making this bread again, come next autumn!!

Moist and yummy!  I only made a couple of changes...used 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce in place of 1/2 cup of the oil, used 1/4 tsp cloves instead of 1/2 tsp, and I used 1 tsp ginger in place of the allspice.  Threw in some dark chocolate and white chocolate chips.  Baked as 1 loaf in a bundt pan for 1 1/4 hours.....came out great!  Got rave reviews from my family & co-workers.  Thanks!

I think this recipe is fabulous.  I also add 1/2 tsp of ground ginger and then top the loaves with chopped candied ginger before putting them in the oven.  Turns out better than Starbucks and makes a great gift! Love it!

I found this recipe a while ago and have made it countless times (following the recipe exactly).  Yum, yum, yum!!!  It comes out so  moist and tastes like pumpkin pie in bread form.  Absolutely delicious!!!  I have had many people ask for the recipe.  Have even made this and given it away as Christmas gifts.

Fantastic. My four-year-old and I just made these for the whole family and mini ones for all of his friends at school, for the holidays. The only thing we change is to add in semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks. Thanks so much.

I've made this twice. Once with oil, once with applesauce. The bread made with oil was much better. The applesauce made it past moist and made it almost gooey. Both times I added sour cream instead of water and added walnuts. Yummy. I think if you do applesauce stick with the water.

This recipe is aaaaamazing!  I used 1 cup brown sugar, 2 cups white.  Subbed orange juice for water.  Added 1 T vanilla.  Subbed applesauce for oil.  It was absolutely perfect and so easy.  I thought it was best served warm with butter & cinnamon/sugar like toast :)

Perfect! I used 2 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar. Also cut the oil in half and used 1/2 c. applesauce to cut out some of the fat. It was delish and my family demolished 2 loaves in one afternoon!

Excellent.  Moist and tasty.  The taste of ginger comes through. Made half the recipe in four small loaf pans.  Used part squash and part pumpkin because I had some leftover cooked squash.  Would give this one 6 stars if I could.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved it.  The second time I added a bit of ground ginger and everyone said it was the best pumpkin bread they ever had.  I like that it makes two loaves- one to keep, one to give away.

This was very moist and delicious. I did have to cut the recipe in half cause there is only 2 of us, but would make a delicious dessert for any church social or reunion. This is a keeper.

The most delicious Pumpkin Bread I've ever tasted! Just the right spice mix and so moist. If you follow this recipe to a "T" you can't/won't go wrong. A nice fall treat~

Absolutely delicious, but overly moist.  I added 2 cups of pecans, which was a nice addition and went perfectly with it.  Next time I will let the bread sit out over night before removing it from the pan.

This recipe is amazing!  I only used about 2-1/3 cups of sugar, and I found it to be sweet enough.  I also took the advice of some other reviewers and used 1/3 cup oil, 1/3 cup applesauce, and 1/3 cup low-fat sour cream, just to try to cut out some fat.  The bread turned out to be dense and moist and delicious!

I have loved this pumpkin bread recipe since I was a girl when my mom would make it every Thanksgiving and Christmas (sans the cloves and allspice).  A fews years back I started adding cloves and ginger.  Fabulous to see that so many people have given this 5 stars!

This recipe turned out excellent. All I had was a 30-oz. can of Libby's pumpkin, so I doubled the recipe for 4 loaves and used the entire can. I mixed the double recipe together and split the batter between 4 pans and cooked at the same time. It turned out soft, perfectly spiced, and freezes very well. Most quick breads I've made either turn out too dry or don't rise properly, but this recipe was fool-proof! Will definitely make again.

This is the BEST pumpkin bread recipe.  I have made it per recipe, less sugar, brown sugar, orange juice, apple sauce, adding ginger and cayenne and with & without add-ins. You just cannot make this come out wrong. A recipe I (obviously!) use again & again.

This bread smells fabulous when cooking.  I use more pumpkin than the recipe called for (omitted the water) and used mayonnaise in place of the eggs and half the oil.  I was afraid it wouldn't cook all the way, but an extra ten minutes and it came out lightly crisp on top and incredibly moist and flavourful inside.  It's a dense bread, but with flavour and moisture instead of weight.

I am really enjoying this bread. I used 1/2 c. oil, 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce. Turned out nice and moist. Left out the allspice, added an extra 1/2. tsp. cinnamon in its place. Great recipe..

I have been making this for about 2 years now, and it has never failed to get rave reviews from any of the many people I've shared it with. Many people ask me for the recipe, and I know that it has become a Thanksgiving/ holiday tradition in several households as a result (including my parents, though I'm not usually able to make it home for Thanksgiving). It's always very flavorful and moist. Sometimes I make mini-loaves and give them as gifts (remember to reduce the cooking time, if you do this!), other times I just make regular loaves and freeze them (it freezes very well).

Extremely moist!  Baked up beautifully.  I cut out half a cup of the sugar, and may in future try mixing it with brown sugar.  I also adjusted the spices to 2 teaspoons Cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ginger and 1/2 teaspoon cloves.  One of the best pumpkin breads I have tried!

Unbelievably yummy!  The description is very accurate -- it tastes like a pumpkin pie.  I replaced the allspice with ginger and didn't notice any huge difference.

This was a moist and delicious bread. I did what was previously suggested and used orange juice instead of water and I really liked the flavor. I was running low on spices, however, and so I stuck with the recipe guidelines. Definitely not strong enough! I will be generous with them next time! I also baked as a bundt and was so glad I checked it at 60 minutes. It did NOT need 90 minutes and was perfectly baked!

Very good.  I make it exactly, expect I added raisin that I had in water to soften them up and a little over 1/2 cup of water.  I made mini bread and mini muffins out of them.  This is a wonderful and easy recipe. Most of the ingredients are things bakers already have at home.  Will make this again.

This recipe is a fantastic starting place!  I modified it, though: cut the allspice in favour of ground ginger, ramped up all the spices by at least a factor of 3, used brown sugar for part of the white sugar, and I cut down just a wee bit on the vegetable oil.

I also sometimes add fruit (craisins or apple chunks) or walnuts, for a fantastic variation on the original.  I think chocolate chips would be good, too, but would definitely require a much smaller amount of sugar to make it just the right amount of sweet.

This is a nice dense and moist bread.  The pumpkin flavor comes through very nicely.  This recipe will make 6 mini loaves of bread.  We ate a couple, sent a few down to Purdue to our son and froze one for another time.  Everyone enjoyed this bread.

I love this recipe! The batter is pretty thin but don't be discouraged; it bakes up nicely! Instead of dividing it into two loaf pans, I make 12 muffins & 1 loaf. I take the muffins out after 30 minutes and bake the loaf for about 1hr 10min total. It's also great with chopped pecans mixed in! It's tasty, easy, and my favorite is heating up a slice with some butter for breakfast on a cool Fall morning :)

This is overall a good recipe. But I have a number of suggestions. Too much oil! I cut out all the oil and used plain non-fat yogurt. It was wonderfully moist and tender. 
Also I think there is too much sugar! I cut out 1/3 of it but still too sweet, but the texture was perfect. Next time I will only use half of it. 
Finally I only made one loaf by making sure it was only 16 servings on the calculator. Lastly I choose to use a slightly larger pan... it turned out wonderfully and cooked through. 
My father finds this recipe too spicy.

Just baked this for thanksgiving and wow, I must say it came out sooo yummy and moist.  I added chopped walnuts to mine and used pumpkin spice in place of cloves.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I should have known this was TOH! The recipe has been used in my family for over 30 years. My sisters and I all make it- (4 of us) regularly.
I do use half AP flour and half white whole wheat flour. It adds a nice texture without the heaviness of regular whole wheat flour. My recipe also calls for 2/3 C. water, but I think the whole wheat flour compensates for it. I bake it in a 9x13 pan, and it's always done in the center.
Otherwise, don't change a thing, unless you want to feel more healthy about it!(it is a lot of oil- I use olive) This is a staple at our Thanksgiving table, along with cornbread and yeast crescent rolls. (big bread family, love the leftovers!) Kiddos love this for breakfast.
Great post!!

This bread was wonderful, the best I've ever made. Followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I would probably change was the extra teaspoon of spices. It was wonderful still though :)

All the reviews were good so I decided to try this recipe. The changes I made included using fresh pumpkin vs canned and I added 1 cup raisins and 2/3 cup chopped pecans. It was marvelous! It smells wonderful when baking and everyone who has had a piece absolutely loves it.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe to a T.  It came out very sweet and very dense (kind of rubbery).  It didn't taste bad, just not great.
The only thing I changed was that I used (2 cups) fresh pumpkins from the garden instead of canned and in the last 1/2 of the recipe I added dried cranberries.  Neither loaf was amazing.

PERFECT! I followed the recipe except for not adding the allspice since I didn't have any. Bread was the perfect texture, perfectly moist, perfectly spiced. No need to look further. I'll be using this one from now on. Thanks for sharing!

This has to be the best pumpkin bread I've ever tried! I made it exactly as the recipe states. It made 1 large loaf, and 12 muffins. My 10 yr. old ate 5 muffins very quickly. I had to cut him off after that, but he would have eaten the whole pan if I let him! The spice combination is great, and the cloves come through beautifully! This will be my go to recipe from now on.

This is a great recipe.  I too, made a few changes.  Trying to make it a little healthier.  I didn't have applesauce to replace the oil, but I had applebutter.  Worked great!  I also added some raisins, dries cranberries, peacan peices, and almonds.  Used 1 cup of wheat flour and 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour.  I made it in a bundt pan and 5 large muffins.  Baked the bundt pan 1 hour and muffins 22 minutes.  They were very tasty.  Will definitely be making this again.

Very moist and flavorful. I used grapeseed oil instead of vegetable oil only to be healthier. My whole family loved this! I will be making it again and again. Next time I'm going to try walnuts in it, but it was delicious without them.

This recipe has become a favorite!  So moist and flavorful.  I cook it at 325 in my convection oven.  My large glass pan takes about 65 min and the aluminum takes about 75-80 min.  Completely agree with the  pumpkin pie description.  Thank you for sharing this yummy bread.

My first attempt at pumpkin bread and it turned out great. I made a few modifications as suggested in previous reviews. I halved my recipe since it was my first time, substituted Cinnamon Applesauce for the vegetable oil, reduced the sugar to 1 cup (remember I halved the recipe), added 1/4 c raisins, and substituted the water for orange juice. Bread was very moist, and heavy. One piece does the trick with a cup of coffee or milk. Enjoy!

This bread was soooo good. And deliciously moist. But it makes a TON So if you don't want A LOT of bread, I'd suggest halving, if not thirding, the recipe.

absolutely loved this recipe.  Pumpkin bread is so easy to make I don't know why I don't do it more.  I also took others suggestions and used 2 cups sugar with 1 cup brown sugar.  I prefer applesauce instead of vegetable oil...but was out today so i used the oil.  My home smells fantastic and I cannot wait to share my bread with friends and family.  Thank you for such an easy but tasty recipe!

This is a favorite in my house. I try to cut the sugar down with splenda or another diabetic friendly sweetener though.  We find that the splenda gets salty after a day or so - so I usually freeze 1/2 the loaf... if there's any left :)

Just needed extra cloves.  I like my spiced pumpkin bread SPICED!  So I adjusted the spices to my tastes and it's perfect.  I've made this recipe before and it's fast to blend the ingredients together, and absolutely delicious once it's done.  My house smells wonderful right now!

This was very good and very easy to make.  It was my first time making pumpkin bread (although I've been eating it for years), and it turned out very well.  I did make one small ingredient change--I doubled the cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and allspice because I actually wanted a spice bread with a little pumpkin.  The spices still weren't overpowering.  I'll definitely make it again, maybe as muffins.  Thanks!

Great recipe! I made 12 muffins and 1 loaf of bread. I brought the bread to a potluck and then ate the muffins for breakfast all week. Everyone at the potluck loved the bread and compared it to coffee shop quality. I added some raw pumpkin seeds to the top of the muffins to add a bit of crunch.

I have quite a few pumpkin bread recipes but always looking to try new ones and I am glad I did! This is one of the most flavorful and moist breads I have made. I didn't have allspice on hand so substituted ginger. Quite a few people I know have to limit nuts, seeds etc. in their diets nowadays so I baked in 1 lb. pans & added a handfull of walnuts & raisins to the the last couple loaves.

This makes the best muffins. My 3 yr old loves pumpkin pie so these muffins are great to make anytime of the year. The only thing I changed was use Hali applesauce and half oil. Very moist and yummy!

Very good. I made this for my family the night before Thanksgiving. I made 2 loafs...one with added walnuts and dried cranberries and one with only the added walnuts. The one with the walnuts and dried cranberries was everyones favorite.  Instead of using 1 cup of oil, I only used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. That is the only change that I made and it came out super moist and delicous!!

Fantastic - and it gets even better if you can let it sit a day before eating it.  I also added vanilla and exchanged 1 cup of sugar for brown sugar.  I was going to try a number of different pumpkin bread recipes (as I got a lot of pumpkins this year) but I think I'll just stick with this one!

We followed the recipe exactly except the pumpkin we bought was only a 15 oz can. I usually don't particularly enjoy pumpkin bread because the recipe we had didn't jump out at me. This one does and it is amazing. It's moist and has the perfect mix of spices. It's great with butter on it too :)

This is the best pumpkin bread I've had! I made 2 loafs yesterday.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned pumpkin.  Oh and I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice because I didn't have all the spices on hand that it called for.  So for the spices I just used the cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice.  Next time I'll make sure to have all the spices.  But It made delicious bread regarless.  It is super moist!!!  5+++ stars!  My 2 year old even loves it, (and she is super picky).  I did find that I needed to cook it for 72-75 minutes instead of 60-65 minutes (I don't live at an elevation so thats not why).  I'm DEFINITLY making this around Thanksgiving as well.  And it is VERY good refrigerated.  I freeze a loaf and keep the other in the fridge until its gone then I defrost the other loaf.  YUMMMm!!!

I followed the top commenter's (Barbi's) alterations. The bread does smell amazing while it's baking, and it tastes delicious. It comes out very thick, almost rubbery, though. Still, it's a very good recipe.

I substituted butternut squash for the pumpkin, added half the sugar and added walnuts. AMAZING! That is by far one of the best recipes. I will make it again. Thank you for sharing!

This was a very moist, easy, delicious pumpkin bread.  I replaced 1 cup of sugar with Splenda, and used egg substitute instead of whole eggs to cut some of the calories.  I will definitely make again!

Great, simple recipe for spiced pumpkin bread.  I added a little ground ginger for extra spice along with walnuts for a little crunch.  I used a mini loaf pan so I ended up with 8 mini loaves (using only half the recipe - 16 yields).  Super cute and tasty!!!

This turned out better then I expected!  I used applesauce instead of oil, this was a first for me, and it is super moist.  I also followed a reviewers tip about using 1/2 cup golden raisins and 1/2 dried cranberries, what a great ideal.  I topped it off with a orange glaze made with orange juice concentrate, regular orange juice and powered sugar.  I can't stop eating it.  I have one to eat now and one in the freezer for later.

This was yummy bread.  I actually divided the entire recipe by 3 because I only had 5 oz of pumpkin.  In an attempt to make it a little healthier, I substituted applesauce for the oil and used just under 1 cup of sugar (remember dividing it in 3).  I threw in a handful of mini chocolate chips because I love chocolate in everything.  This was a yummy bread and I'm glad I chose this recipe to "use up" my leftover pumpkin.  Because I put all the batter into 1 bread pan, the bread was slightly "short" since I divided the recipe in 3, but it tasted fine - I baked 64 minutes.

Tastes great!  I added 1/2 tsp of ginger to the batter.  My family loved them.

I've made this recipes many times, and it always turns out amazing!  Everyone who has tasted it LOVES it.

One modification that I have done in the past is to substitute one cup of flour with one cup of almond meal (finely ground almonds).

Honestly the best pumpkin bread I've ever had.  Moist, well formed, and so delicious.  The only alteration I made was substituting oj for the water.  Next time I will add chocolate chips.

This was pretty good. I made it exactly as the recipe called, but next time I think I may add some walnuts or something.  I also expected a little more of a spice flavor, but it was good nonetheless.

So good!!! I made this recipe exactly except I cut back a little on the cloves (too strong) and added a little extra cinnamon. My pans were a little smaller so it made two loaves and 4 "muffins". Will definately make again!!

I didn't have the size bread pan called for in the recipe, but the bread still came out perfectly moist. My husband, who is really picky about pumpkin bread, loved it.

Like others, I used apple sauce instead of oil, fresh oj in place of water, 1tsp. Vanilla, and two cups fresh pumpkin purée.  I have now made it with 2 cups white / 1 cup light brown sugar and with NO sugar at all.  Both are DELICIOUS!!!  Without sugar is a smaller denser loaf, more like bread; with is still dense, but taller and more like cake in sweetness.

this is my staple pumpkin bread recipe.  Since I started making it 5 years ago, people now request it during the holidays! For a truly decadent treat, I serve it with whipped cream cheese.  Always a holiday favorite!

I make this every year. It is always a hit. I freeze extra loaves and they hold up well for many months if wrapped in waxed paper, then foil and then a zip lock. I forgot I had them and my house guest thawed almost a year after baking. It was still delicious!!! I make it exactly as written.

Absolutely delicious!  It really does taste like pumpkin pie, and everyone who tasted it said the same thing--especially when they ate it with vanilla or cinnamon ice cream.  I highly recommend this recipe!

-Substitute applesauce for the oil. 
-Add 1tsp of Vanilla extract to wet ingredients.
-Double all the spices!

I sometimes use this recipe for muffins, and it makes 30 muffins (because I have 2 12-muffin and 1 6-muffin tins so I make the batter fit).  It bakes much more quickly for muffins - about 25 minutes.  I donate them to church bake sales often and they get gobbled up.
