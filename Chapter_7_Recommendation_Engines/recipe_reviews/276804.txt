The sauce was excellent. The chicken was very dry and I only cooked the breasts for 3 hours as opposed to 6 hours as stated in the recipe.  I went against my better judgement and used boneless, skinless chicken breast as the recipe called for. I wanted to use bone-in chicken but in order to fairly rate this recipe I followed as written.
