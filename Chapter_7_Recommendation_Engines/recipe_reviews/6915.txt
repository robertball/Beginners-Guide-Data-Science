This is a great recipe! I've made a few additions to make it phenomenal. I used the base recipe but added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and an extra cup of zucchini. I also added a crunchy crust which changed the bread from "ummmm" to "oh my god!" The crunchy crust recipe is this: -1 cup brown sugar  -1 cup all-purpose flour  -2 tablespoons butter or margarine   -2 teaspoons cinnamon  -1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Mix it all together really well and crumble on top of the batter prior to baking. The topping cooks crisp and adds just what the bread needed.

Sorry Mom - I'm replacing your recipe, the one that I grew up eating, the one that I've been making for 20 years, the one that I though couldn't get any bette, with this one!  
  
For the first batch I followed the recipe as written (omitting the nuts).  Extremely moist and really delicious. 

For the second batch I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce as suggested by others.  Equally moist and delicious.  Being somewhat conscientious about using all that oil in the original recipe, I'll opt for the oil/applesauce combination in the future.  

For batch number 3 I used the oil/applesauce combo, and added the crumb topping suggested by others.  This is exactly how I will make it from now on.  Please note: before sprinkling the topping ontop of the unbaked loaves, you may need to squeeze the topping mix into little clumps, especially if you made the topping in a food processor.     

Great recipe and definitely try the crumb topping - a winning combination!

I love this recipe! I read the reviews and altered the recipe like MaryKlaire by adding a studel -like topping in a similar matter.  However, I made a crumb topping of 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 3 Tblsp of butter, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1/2 cup walnuts.  Mixed together and crumbled on top of loaves before baking.  Furthermore, like Patricia, I replaced 1/2 of the oil with 1/2 cup of apple-sauce.  I actually used a snack pack version with Mango.  You really don't miss the oil. Finally, I used about 2 1/2 cups of zucchini and I drain  / squeeze the liquid out of the shredded zucchini before adding it to the mixture.  Thank you again for a wonderful zucchini bread recipe.  Obviously the final version is a combination of several great ideas.  Good job.

This will be my zucchini bread recipe from now on, it's very good. However I did change it up a bit according to other reviewers' suggestions, so I cannot rate the original recipe. 

I rated the recipe based on the following changes: added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, added an extra cup zucchini, used whole wheat flour. Added the crumbly topping as recommended by MarieClaire (I actually halved her recipe based on other reviewers' suggestions: 1/2c flour [used whole wheat], 1/2 c brown sugar, 1 tbsp butter, 1/4 c chopped walnuts, 1 tsp. cinnamon). YUM! Next time I'll substituting half of the oil for unsweetened apple sauce to make it a bit healthier.

My family & I absolutely loved it!  I used only 1/2 of the oil and used 1/2 a cug of plain yogurt. I added 1/2 a cup of golden raisens, fabulous!  I chopped the zucchini & then placed on papertowel to absorb some of the water,worked great! I used 2 teaspoons cinnamon & 1 teaspoon nutmeg.  On my second batch I put choc.chips instead of raisens, my son loved it & he has no idea there is zucchini in it.  Also partially peal the zuk's so the kids do not see.

Very tasty!  I added a cup of raisins and covered the loaf pans after an hour to prevent browning while the inside set, and loved the outcome!  Excellent recipe, not very time-consuming or difficult.

My first attempt at zucchini bread and it turned out great.  I changed a few thing's. Grating wasn't working too well for me so I shredded and squeezed out the excess juice, but not too dry. I used pecans instead of walnut's because I was out, for about a quarter of the tablespoon of cinnamon I used all spice, and I baked it in a square 9X9 pan instead of the loaf pans.  It took an hour and about 10-15  minutes before I was done I covered it loosely with tinfoil to avoid over browing.  Great recipe!

I've now made this several times and have frozen several loaves. Whether fresh or "thawed", it's always a hit. Thanks for sharing!

Yum! This bread is moist and flavorful. Next time I will stir in some chocolate chips because--well, basically because I just love chocolate. But it's great as is.

Well, I have to be the spoil sport, but I wonder what folks are used to with zucchini bread? For me it *should be* one of the more moist and darker in color of all the quick breads. The recipe I normally use only makes one loaf, not two. I've found without fail that recipes that make 2 loaves generally are dry and too dense for my taste and this was no exception.

That said, I substituted applesauce like other did and this was just bland and dry, not at all like the moist, flavorful recipe I'm used to.

I'm going right now to look for my Better Homes and Garden Cookbook where my favorite recipe is. Now THAT is a good zucchini bread and unlike this one you don't have to hide it under a sugary crust to jazz it up--it is healthy all on its lonesome.

Sorry folks. I know this may not seem like a very nice review, but I guess I'm usually extra disappointed when the reviews are so inconsistent with the results. *sigh*

Excellent recipe, but do use the "reviewers" tips.  
Here's the substitute summary:
Sugar - 1c white  1/2 cup brown sugars
Oil - 1/2 c oil, 1/2 cup applesauce
Spices - 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg
Definately use the topping, but you don't need so much!  Try half.

Excellent zucchini bread!  I substituted sunflower seeds instead of walnuts - I'm not a big walnut fan, they taste bitter to me.  But the sunflower seeds went very well with the zucchini.

This recipe can also be made in a bundt pan - bake at 350 for about 1 hour or until a toothpick comes out clean.

Will definitely be making this again!

I have tried other zucchini bread recipes, but always come back to this one.  It is my absolute favorite:  always light, always tasty, and always well-received by those with whom I share it.  What I like about this recipe is that I can use fresh zucchini as easily as I can use the frozen shredded zucchini I preserve from my garden.  I simply thaw it, drain it, and toss it in as usual!  (If the batter seems too thick, I add a tablespoon or two of the liquid drained off from the zucchini.)  Whichever I use--fresh or frozen--the results are always great!  In addition to this versatility, I have successfully substituted 1/2 c. applesauce for 1/2 c. of the oil.  This cuts the fat some...which, as we all know, is a good thing!  

In short, this recipe is fantastic.  Do try it!

This is a perfect bread (although it is more of a cake to me) to give to neighbours and friends. My first attempt at growing zucchini produced a huge crop. This recipe is perfect for using up extra zucchini from the garden. I freeze the grated zucchini in pre-measured amounts. When I want to make this, I just get a bag out of the freezer.

I made this for 2 other families.  We all loved how moist it turned out.  I used the 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c apple sauce combo.  Also, I used the topping that was suggested by others. 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 4 tbs butter (not 2tbs), 1/4 cup chopped walnuts – Mix dry ingredients, then cut in cold butter until you have pea size crumbs. Spread over top batter before baking.  I used 2 tbs on the first and the topping was not moist enough.  I increased the topping butter content to 4 tbs.  The bread stayed moist for days!  My 6 & 4 year old boys LOVED it!  Thanks!

Very good but lacking that little touch that makes it melt-in-your-mouth irresistible. Let the bread set a day or two for moisture and a better texture.

I have been making this recipe for years and it is great.  I have made it substituting applesauce (100%), and that makes the texture very rubbery.  Since I love cinnamon, I always add a bit more.  Folks who had trouble getting it to bake through had their zucchini too wet to be sure.  I usually sprinkle the zucchini with a bit of salt, let it sit 15 min, rinse it very well, and dry well in a towel.  Getting the excess mositure out of the zucchini is important.  I would encourage those who have had a failure with this recipe, to try it with my instructions on drying the zucchini...it will work just fine.  For those who think this is a good way to sneak vegetables in on kids, I think you are kidding yourselves...this is a very sweet cake...there is nothing nutricious about it at all.  It does make a great morning bread, toasted with butter.  I have used raisins, and also chocolate  chips...both are great...I never use nuts due to nut allergies, but you really need the extra bulk somehow, or it won't make 2 loaves...sometimes I make small 2' x 4" loves with this, or cupcakes.  If you are only 2 people as we are, you are not going to be able to "just eat one" piece...so making it that way will help you not to devour the whole thing in a day or two.  After all, it is fattening and high in fat...it is a cake, not bread in any sense.

Great way to use up all my zucchini. I substituted the white sugar with brown sugar (I ran out!) and 1 teaspoon gingerbread spice for the third teaspoon of cinnamon - and it made the kitchen smell like Christmas in August! I also made sure to place a pan of hot water on the bottom of my oven because of the dry climate in my area. That extra step insures a wonderful, dense texture that improves with time. This zucchini bread tastes great fresh out of the oven, and AMAZING after a night in the fridge - just make sure to wrap it up in foil so it doesn't dry out! I have friends who absolutely DETEST zucchini but pester me to make this again and again! Very, very good!!! This recipe turns out one 9"x5" loaf and 8 muffins.

I also baked muffins with this recipe, lowering the baking time by about 10 minutes.  They were delicious.  My family just loves this recipe and I've had ongoing requests.

I really like this recipe.  It's good as listed but I also tried it with about 1/2 cup more zucchini and raisins and it turned out great.  At high altitude( 6100ft.)  I baked it for 60 minutes and it was perfect.

I have made this bread several times, and it is delicious.  I did make a few changes - I only added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and I added a pinch of nutmeg for some extra flavor.

Just made this recipe - first time making zucchini bread, it is simply delicious. After reading a few reviews I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and an extra cup of shredded zucchini to the batter just because I ended up with more than I needed, also I made the nut topping (1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 2 tablespoons butter or margarine, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts- Mix it all together really well and crumble on top of the batter prior to baking). It came out wonderful, whole family loved it.

Somehow, a zucchini in my garden managed to escape being picked. I didn't see it until it was Zukezilla--literally the size of my husband's leg from knee to ankle. I couldn't think of what to do with it; it was too big to just slice up or even stuff. So, in desperation I browsed zucchini recipes and found this one. It is EXCELLENT! By far the best zucchini bread I've ever had.

This recipe is wonderful!  My husband asked me if he could "have a loaf" to cut into singles and freeze for his breakfast!  The second time I made this I cut the cinnamon in half and added 1 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  Either way is great!

A very moist loaf.  I used a bundt pan and kept the time the same.  Worked out very well.  I did cut the sugar down a bit by about 1/4 of a cup and it was still sweet enough.

Excellent.  I used Pampered Chef's mini loaf pan from the stoneware collection.  Reduce cooking time to 50 min.  This recipe made 4 mini loaves.

This was a very easy & good receipe, and freezes 
well.  I served it to company twice, and everyone 
liked it.  A good way to use up some of that 
summer zucchini.

This is such a wonderful recipe.   The first time I made it I didn't change a thing, but now that I'm trying to be healthier and watching my diet I decided to make some changes. Instead of 2 cups of sugar I used 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup shredded carrot, 1 medium banana mashed, and for the 1c. oil I used 1c. of applesauce. It bakes beautifully and is so moist. It's wonderful the orginal way and it's wonderful with the lighter version. Just the best recipe!!!!!

Turned these into muffins (recipe makes 1 dozen) and they were just excellent. 4 yr. old son has declared this "better than carrotcake" (his favorite partly because of the cream cheese frosting) because it's so good without frosting! Because we try to avoid refined white sugar and flour, though, we replaced with organic whole wheat flour and organic honey & dehydrated cane juice(sucanat) for sweetener. I'm so happy this recipe was available. Thank you!

Very good!  I used this recipe because I couldn't find my mom's.  Of course I found it after I made this and it was very close(4 eggs, 3 1/2c flour, 3c. zucchini, 1c. nuts).  I would include cooling at least 10 minutes on a rack before removing from pan. Next time I may line pans with wax paper to ease removal when adding raisins. Also, check after 45 min. since oven temps differ.  At 50 min. mine were done and would have burned if left in any longer.

excellent. :) the first time i made this, i had no baking powder, so i altered it a bit by placing an extra teaspoon of baking soda and three tablespoons of lemon juice. it rose well. :) tonight when i made it once again, i had the baking powder, did everything by the recipe, and it came out just as good. :) i think i'm going to try the crusty top that others are suggesting in their reviews.

and oh, i changed the cooking time. i can't seem to reach 60 minutes. i get it out at around 40 or 50 minutes. it's already done (toothpick test) by that time, and the sides and top are already crusty.

This was so yummy!  I used 100% whole wheat, 1/2 cup apple sauce for 1/2 cup oil, a little extra zucchini, and 1/2 cup honey for 1 cup of the sugar.  I also took the walnuts and chopped them very small.  I mixed them with a little bit of brown sugar and sprinkled it over the top.  This made a sweet crunchy topping that was delish!

This recipe has been around for over 50 years, my mother baked it back in the 50's & 60's.  It's a tried and true heirloom and so easy to make.  You can double recipe if you have a mixer large enough.  My husband hates squash, of any kind.   Guess what, he LOVES this bread.  I use Splenda instead of real sugar.   You can also use low-fat or no-fat sour cream instead of vegetable oil.  This keeps the calorie count down and is diabetic friendly if you wish to know.   It has wonderful texture, color and taste.   If you bake several loaves at a time, the bread can be frozen for up to 6 months.  Just wrap it in a freezer bag or wrap.  Enjoy!

Great recipe.  I had never made it before and I've made it three ways... with nuts, with blueberries and with choc. chips.  I had rave reviews on ALL of them.  I LOVED the blueberries... I can't belive I made it!

I made this exactly as instructed, except instead of 2 loaves, I made one large "cake" in a 13x9 stoneware cake pan. It came out moist and perfect! Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is okay, but is tooth-achingly sweet. I would cut the sugar down to 1.5 cups or possibly less. I prefer more a more "grown-up" taste to my quick breads, not as if I just bit into something from Hostess.

I had my doubts even with all the reviews, but his was outstanding! I used the topping that someone suggested (1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup flour, 2 tbs butter, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts - mix really well and spread over top batter before baking).  Wow.. it was moist and delicious.. and I am a terrible cook so it must be easy. My husband didn't want me to heat the kitchen (it was hot outside) so we tried microwaving the second batch and it was great too. I didn't have a microwavable bundt pan, so I just used a round glass dish and put an overturned soup cup in the center.  Cooked 9 minutes medium, then 2 high and let stand for 10 minutes. Not a crispy top like the oven-made one, but it was cooked through, very moist and delicious. The un-crispy top was like you'd find on a coffee cake (with the suggested topping).  Outstanding. Oh - I followed the recipe exactly but added an extra cup of smashed bananas and 1/2 tsp nutmet.  Couldn't be better!!!  Thanks so much!!!

Followed the recipe exact! Tasted great & everyone else who tried it agreed! Update: A few weeks after I originally made this I was given another zucchini. I decided to make more zucchini bread, but tried another recipe from this site that had over 1000 reviews and was rated 5 stars....well, I was really disappointed with it and wish I had used this recipe again. Zucchini Bread IV is definitely the best out there! I am not sure what makes it so different from the others, but it just is! Try it, you'll see!

This had great flavor and unbelievable moistness!! Excellent recipe. My husband said this was the best zucchini bread I've ever made. I ended up using 4 mini loaf pans baked at 325 for about 55 mins and they were perfect. For any novice bakers, if your mom was like mine and taught you how to grease a pan by using folded wax paper or saran wrap, here's an easier way - use a sandwich baggie, just put your hand in it, grease the pan and throw away the baggie - no mess on your hand!

Such a success! Incredibly delicious. I made these vegan and whole grain(and low cholesterol) by substituting 3/4 cup of applesauce for the 3 eggs and using whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour. I also used safflower oil instead of vegetable oil, put in just 3/4 cups of sugar because of all the applesauce, and made these into muffins instead of loafs, baking for about half an hour (our oven is finicky and its temperature is unreliable, so this time might be different in another oven). They were such a hit in my non-vegan house! Their crunchy tops and warm, soft interior were amazing. You'd never know how good they were for you!

I made this for a bake sale.  It made 12 muffins and 3 mini-loaves.  I ended up with about an extra cup of zucchini grated, so I just threw it in for extra moisture.  I omitted the nuts from the batter, made the muffins, and then put the remaining batter in the mini loaf pans and sprinkled chopped pecans on top.  They were a big hit!

Seems silly to give this bread another rave review but... excellent and I am overwhelmed with zucchini this time of year so I have been making it a lot! I reduced oil to 1/4 cup and used applesauce for the rest.  I usually leave out the nuts on recipes but the walnuts are a nice addition.  Added whatever extra succihini I had (maybe 2 1/2 or 3 cups and the loaves turned out great.  Also covered loaves at abou 45 minutes.  Looking forward to trying chocolate chips next time.

Made this bread for a family get together and everyone loved it. I sliced up the leftovers, placed in a large storage bag and froze. When we wanted some, we ate it right out of the freezer and tasted just as good as the day I made it!!! Excellent!

This site is so awesome! First a great recipe, then the reviewers help to make it even better
 I took some of the other reviewers advice and added more zucchini, 1/2 cup honey for 1 cup sugar and used half whole wheat flour. I like it spicy so I added even more cinnamon and oh yeah ,about 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. I have only one loaf pan so I used that, plus one round cake pan. The cake pan bread was baked through more evenly, really turned out lovely. The cake pan one was done in  about 40 minutes. This is the only zucchini bread recipe I'll need from now on. Thanks!

I messed around with the ingredients a lot (honey for sugar, applesauce for some oil, all whole-wheat flour), but despite all of my healthying up, this was a wonderful loaf.  The smell is so fantastic.  A simple and delightful recipe.

Great, moist bread.  My kids and their friends loved it!  So quick and easy.  I would cut the sugar a little next time it was a little sweet, but still got devoured in my house!  The second time I made it I used 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup  cinnamon applesauce still very moist!  Great bread.

I am making my 3rd batch right now.  1st batch was made with peeled zuc., 2nd with it unpeeled.  The 2nd batch wasn't as sweet.  I think the peeling adds a bitterness to the bread.  So my 3rd batch I compromised and peeled the zuc and when grating it, I added a strip or two of the peel for the color and the look of a good zucchini bread.

Really good recipe!  Very close to my Mom's recipe.  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup loose packed brown sugar instead of the 2 cups white sugar.  

It made 1 loaf and 7 muffins.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe deserves 10 stars.  I've made this many times with many other recipes but really this is the very best.  I first started using this recipe over a year ago and haven't used any other since.  You CAN use as much as three cups of zucchini as long as the moisture is squeezed out before combining. These loaves never seem to last very long.  I make 'em up and give as gifts to neighbors, friends and of course, the relatives.  I dress them up a bit by coating the pans with sugar after I grease them instead of using the flour, especially if I'm going to be giving as a gift.  Thank you so much, Kristen, for sharing with all of us.

This recipe is good or better than grandma's. The amount of cinnamon and vanilla I think is the key. I tried to make it healthier because of my husband's cholesterol. Here is what worked for me: 1/2 cup applesauce, 1/2 cup oil, 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 cup of wheat flour in place of white. My husband didn't even notice the lighter changes!

A delicious recipe ..to make it more nutritious and give it a nice zest, I substitute in the following: whole wheat flour and wheat germ for the white flour; use 4 egg whites plus a whole egg for the 3 eggs; 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 c. fat free Activia or Dannon vanilla yogurt, 1/4 c. canola oil for the 1 c. oil; and 1 c. sugar plus 12 packets of splenda for the 2 c. sugar. I add an extra 3/4 c. zucchini and 1-2 T. grated orange rind, and I use the crumb nut topping suggested by an earlier user. The bread comes out moist and delicious with less fat and calories (a Bonus!) and receives yummy remarks.

Very moist and yummy! I added a crumble to the top made of 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 2 tbs cinnamon, 2 tbs melted butter and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Heavenly as a breakfast coffee cake.

this is good.  I upped the zucchini to 3 cups and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I like that this makes 2 loaves.  I didn't add nuts.

WONDERFUL!  I couldn't stop eating it.  I made the suggested crumb topping and used the 1/2 applesauce & oil method and boy was it tasty.  I'll be using this recipe from now on.

I added extra zucchini, as suggested, and even made the topping; however, I felt this was dry and lacked flavor.

I have made Zucchini bread before, but never like this!  It turned out so good!  We are vegan so I made a few changes. I substituted tofu for eggs (1/4c per egg), and because tofu tends to make baked goods more moist, I substituted 1c. of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of all-purpose. I also added the recomended topping. Wow, so yummy, what a treat.  Try the tofu too, you'll never even know it's there!

Perfect as is! I've been baking zucchini bread for 15+ years and have tried many different recipes.  This mixed better than any other I've ever tried, poured better and didn't have that overly-heavy feel/taste - it was chockful of flavor but still "airy".  I added 3x the amount of walnuts because I love them.  Seems this recipe is easy to adapt to add different types of nuts and/or blueberries or substitute applesauce for part of the oil, but I love it just as it is.  A real keeper!

This recipe is FABULOUS!!!  The first time I made it my boyfriend, dad, my dad's girlfriend and I all devoured it!  My dad is still raving about the recipe begging me to make a third batch.  Multiple other people have also asked me for the recipe.  The crunchy crust makes ALL the difference, but instead of 1 cup of flour for the crust I would only use 1/2 to 3/4 c.  One cup of flour leaves the top a little white.  Excellent recipe!

Yum!  I took these to work and everyone asked for the recipe!  I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil, a little less sugar, and substituted some wheat flour for part of the white flour to make it a little more nutritious, but even with "healthy" substitutions it still tasted fantastic!  You could also add another cup of zucchini if you have a bunch that you want to get rid of.

This recipe looks exactly like my grandmas, so I had high expectations. I used applesauce instead of oil to cut down on fat and calories, and the bread ended up almost rubbery. I will try again and maybe have half oil, half applesauce.

after 70 minsutes of baking my bread was still raw! i dipped a butter knoife into it and came out with tons of raw batter.  i ended up baking it for 85 minutes and it still could have used a couple minutes more.
i also used the "crumb topping" and next time i will modify it by using a handful more nuts, 2 tbs more butter, and 1/3 cup less flour. over all pretty tasty.

I use this recipe all the time.  It always turns out great!  Very moist.  The only alterations I make are the following:
1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce
3/4 cup to 1 cup of nuts.  I prefer pecans.
I add several handfullls of raisins.  A couple of times I added chopped dried fruit and it was ok.  Dried apricots didnt go too well with the flavor.  
This is a zucchini bread tat I will stick with.  No need to look any further!

INCREDIBLE!  I loved this bread!  I live in Colorado and baking in the mountains is a blessed way of life!  This bread was a pleasure to bake! 

This bread is THE BEST! I did make some changes..  I only made one loaf, therefore the following changes were for 1/2 of the recipe.  I used butter instead of oil, added 1/2 cup of buttermilk, and increased the flour 1/4 cup.  I used the topping as others suggested and added oats to it.  I cut the flour in half and ie. it called for 1/2 cup of flour and I only used 1/4 and added 1/2 cup of oats.  INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!  I will pass this recipe on!!!!!!  Thanks!

This recipe is so versatile.  I have made it as is, which is wonderful.  This time I mixed it up, using some cinnamon applesauce in place of some oil, some whole wheat flour in place of some white flour, then added some flaxseed, extra zucchini and 2 bananas.  I made 1 loaf and 8 mini loaves.  It still turned out delicious and moist.  My preschoolers really enjoyed it.(I added a Hershey kiss in the middle of their mini-loaves.) I will probably use even more spices next time.

Very good, classic zucchini bread.  Everything you would expect of a good zucchini recipe.  I substituted applesauce for half of the oil and ended up with a very moist bread. Thank you.

I Love this recipe and will use from now on! I made a few modifications. I used whole wheat flour instead, half the sugar, added extra raisins, and 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce and 1/4 up veg oil. I made muffins instead of bread. Already all gone. It's been 16 hours since it came out of the oven. Thank you very much for sharing such an amazing recipe.

I am a health nut, so I made a bunch of "healthy substitutions" to this and it still came out great! Instead of oil - the exact same amount of unsweetened applesauce; instead of eggs - 1/4 liquid egg substitute per large egg required; instead of suger - exact same amount of Splenda; instead of white flour - exact same amount of whole wheat flour. Tasted great with a fraction of the calories! Oh, and it does tend to make a small loaf (doesn't rise to top of pan) so make more if you want nice, overflowing loafs of bread :)

I've made this bread many times, but I decided to try a healthier, fat-free version. I used apple butter (there is a recipe for this) instead of oil (same amount) and used brown sugar instead of white. I was worried about the results, but believe me, it was still very moist, and sweet...FAT-FREE.  I added a tsp of nutmeg, and 1 tsp of pumpkin spice, added 1 more cup of zuchinni, and trust me, it was super good. If you are looking for fat-free alternatives, apple sauce or apple butter is the way to go.

Perfect!!  When I was given a bunch of fresh zucchini, I made up several loaves and froze them.  They thaw and taste just as good as fresh.  I also have a chocolate zucchini recipe that is similar:  Substitute 1/2 cup of the flour with a 1/2 cup of baking cocoa powder.  Add 3 tsp. vanilla instead of 2, and decrease the cinnamon from 3 tsp. to 1, if you prefer.

I want to add photo but it would not let me.

I mistook this recipe for my regular zucchini bread recipe, and I have to say, I was a bit disappointed.  It had pretty good flavor, but it was EXTREMELY dry.  It almost had the texture of a shortbread cookie, which I didn't care for.  The only difference in the two recipes is that this one calls for 1/4 tsp baking powder and the other calls for 1 tsp and the cooking time is shorter.

I'm sorry to say that I prefer the "Mom's zucchini bread" recipe much better, but thanks for sharing just the same!

I skipped the nuts and added raisins.  It was hard to stay out of this.  I made a second batch with substitutions of some applesauce for half the oil and replaced half the sugar with splenda.  It was not as good but it was edible.

Yes, I am a guy who loves to bake!  Good, basic recipe, but did make changes (yes, gave myself 5 stars!).  All have made comments abut applesauce (did half oil), brown sugar, etc.  I too made the topping.  Wonderful addition.  BUT, the big change was to add in a cup of shredded apple.  Zucchini has little to no flavor, cinnamon is nice but the apple made all the difference. Also, be sure to roast the nuts first...again, zucchini itself has little flavor and the roasting brings out the nut flavor.  Add a pinch of nutmeg too if you like.  Second batch I added shredded coconut (really unique and good!).  Also, decided to eliminate oil and go with applesauce, sour cream,  and butter instead as well as WW flour.  Again, very unique but I guarantee you will get requests for recipe. I still will argue with those who say not to drain the zucchini as I really think you have to as long as you bake the bread just under 60 minutes. Just put the zucchini in a clean dishtowel and squeeze a bit.   Enjoy and let me know how it was!

Very good recipe, but I wish it was a bit healthier. I also subbed out 1 cup of zucchini for 1 cup of vegetable pulp from my juicer. I'd like to try to get away with less sugar next time.

Yum! I made a loaf of this today and it came out pretty good.  The only changes I made were to use one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white, added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, ground ginger and cloves, along with the cinnamon...I like my zucchini breads to be "spicy" and I added a streusel topping but that's also personal preference.  I ended up making one loaf ( my pan was plenty big enough) and had to cook for ten extra minutes. I didn't find this loaf dry as other reviewers have mentioned but in my experience, it always becomes moister as it sits ( as in overnight).  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and very moist.  I took the advice of others and used 1/4 cup applesauce plus a 1/4 cup of sour cream with 1/2 cup oil....instead of the 1 cup oil!  I also used the "streusel topping" because I personally LOVE crispy tops on anything!  Be aware though that the streusel recipe makes WAY more than you need.  I doubled the bread recipe and still had streusel left over!  It DID add a nice crunchy texture to the top!  Hubby and I give both the bread and the topping an A+

I was looking for a recipe to use all the zucchini my garden keeps insanely producing. This was my first time making Zucchini Bread and this recipe is so good and really easy to make!! I added the Crumb topping as suggested but I thought it was too sweet, so next time I will not add the topping. I also omitted the walnuts (I didn't have any) but I think it would taste super good with walnuts, so I am adding those next time. I used my new kitchen aid (I was excited) and followed the directions as stated. Overall the bread was moist, tasted perfect and cooked in exactly 1hr. I'm making it again this weekend, out garden is full of zucchini!

This was the best recipe.  I love to make banana bread however this was my first attempt to making zucchini bread.  I made muffins rather than bread and it made 24.  I added 1 tsp. of ground nutmeg and omitted the nuts.  My boys LOVED it!  I had to forward this to all the girls in my family!  5 STARS!

Came out moist and delicious! I made a light vanilla citrus glaze to dribble on top, which added the perfect touch.

This bread is fantastic! I used 1/2 the oil and subbed applesauce for the rest and added the crumb topping (Only needed 1/2 the recipe for the topping) and this bread is outta this world! That was the only changes. THANK YOU!

This is my first time making a zucchini bread. I received an GINORMOUS zucchini from a friend's home garden. There was NO way I would have been able to eat this zucchini without it going bad. I googled "moist zucchini bread" and this was the first recipe in my search. Glad that the recipe called for 2 loaves because I will provide my friend with a loaf. He doesn't like any nuts, so I used chocolate chips in its place.  For the bread, I used 3 cups of grated zucchini, whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, and I found that it took longer to bake. (approximately 30 minutes longer & not sure if that was because of the whole wheat flour). Bread came out VERY moist.  After reading the reviews, I agree that MaryKlaire's crumbly brown sugar topping is just what this bread needed. The bread was very good without it, but the topping took the bread from yummy to WOW! I used pecans instead of walnuts. The next time I make it, I will use nuts in the bread too and thinking about adding raisins (my husband's suggestion). I will also add a tad bit more butter to the crunch topping. I will be making again.

I have tried making both the original recipe and a modified lighter version based on some of the reviewers comments.  Both were absolutely delicious but I was surprised to find that my family liked the lighter version more than the original.  I used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/2 cup oil (instead of 1 cup oil), 3 cups of zucchini (instead of 2 cups) with some of the liquid squeezed out using a colander and 1-1/2 cups of sugar (instead of 2 cups).  Both loaves were gone in no time and they are already asking for more.  Great recipe either way you make it.  Yum! :)

have made this dozens of times and have yet to have a failure - would suggest shreading zucchini and freezing two cups at a time in zip lock bags - to enjoy when zucchini is out of season. Thanks for the wonderful recipe Kristen

I made the recipe exactly as written.  The bread was to die for!  I kept one loaf and gave the other to a friend and she's already pestering me to make more.  I'll be making more of this recipe to put in the freezer.

I thought this bread was very moist and yummy.  I have made it twice now...both times I used half oil and half apple sauce.  The second time I made it I added some carrots.  I didn't have enough zucchini and figured that I would give it a try.  I was pleased.  Thanks for sharing.

This is the exact original recipe my Mother-in-law has used for years.  Here's my changes which dramatically dropped the fat & calories.  Reduce oil to 1/2C.  Add 1/2C of apple sauce in its place.  Use 1C Splenda & 1C Sugar instead of 2C sugar.  It's around 4g of fat per serving & 120 cal.

To die for Zucchini Bread.  I made a few adjustments trying to get what I liked out of the original recipe and what others suggested.  I did use 3 cups of Zucchini without squeezing.  Put in 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of Almond extract.  Made the crumb topping and added 1 cup of zucchini to it as well, just got it out of the oven, my daughter and I tried it warm and it's really good.  I am not a big zucchini bread fan either and the topping did it for me, Nice and crunchy.  I will make this again, can't wait for others in my family to try it.

Great recipe.  Didn't change anything except I added a scoop of flax meal to add to the health value.  Wanted to use some whole wheat flour, but I was afraid it might change the texture.

This recipe is exactly the same as the Mom's zucchini recipe minus that is uses less sugar and baking soda, thus why I chose this one. The only difference I will do next time is to add more zucchini, it really disappears after you cook it. Also I used half brown/half white sugar. Don't pass it up!

I have never written a review on a recipe, but I felt the need to comment on this one.  My neighbor gave me some zucchini and I needed to use it up.  I made the bread last night and brought it to work today and it is a huge hit!  I have already printed the recipe out five different times for co-workers.  Like other reviewers I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce and made a crumb topping.  Even people who normally do not like zucchini bread are asking for the recipe!  Thanks Kristen!

The only things I did different from the recipe are   1.  Made into muffins (bake about 25 min), 2.  omit nuts  the family is LOVING them.    I'm going to try them next time with some of the suggestions listed and I'll post my thoughts then!  Great recipe!!

We absolutely loved this recipe!!!  I did alter it a bit as suggested by others.  I added the crumb topping.  I used half oil and half applesauce, an extra cup of zucchini and the nutmeg.  I added my own little health twist by adding some ground flax seed.  Doesn't get any better than this!

Make sure to squeeze out all the water in the zucchini.  I don't like my bread too sweet so I used 1 1/2 cup of sugar and it turned out great.

Very very good! I used the nuts and brown sugar topping as other reviewers suggested. Also, I used half applesauce and half oil instead of all oil. This made me cut back on the sugar too (applesauce adds sweetness) to 1 cup and with the sugar topping it turned out fantastic!

I've made this recipe twice now. Both times  when I pulled it out of the oven the toothpick was clean and the bread had rose beautifully. 5 minutes later it sinks and is gooey on the inside. The taste isn't bad, but the texture is awful, not to mention was too sticky for my personal likings.

I made this recipe exactly as directed except that I omitted the nuts (my husband and daughter are allergic) and added just a tiny bit of grated orange zest. It was absolutely delicious! My 12 year old has been scarfing this bread down (and yes, he knows there is zucchini in it). He says it tastes just like cake! I put the second loaf in the freezer but I suspect we'll be pulling it out soon and making many more batches of this delicious bread!

Awesome recipe made even better with the "tweeks" suggested by others.  I regularly "fool" children into eating zucchini by discuising it in this recipe. Like others, I upped zucchini to 3c, substituted 1.5c whole wheat flour for 1.5c all purpose, and used 50-50 oil - applesauce.  In addition, I used a 50-50 mixture of Splenda and sugar. With regarding to the topping... Addition of topping is great but you can easily cut the volume in half and have more than enough topping for two loaves of delicious bread.

I baked this last night and just had it for breakfast - wonderful! I am a very picky chef when it comes to judging things I make myself and I loved this and would share it with anyone! I used half wheat flour and half all-purpose, half oil and half applesauce (blueberry-pomegranate was all I had on hand!), and half regular white sugar half sugar in the raw, also the suggested crumb topping but with a generous half cup flour instead of a full cup and chopped pistachios because that's what I had on hand - loved the earthy balance they gave to the brown sugar that would've otherwise been a tad too sweet for my taste. Oh and I didn't put nuts in the actual bread and I used about 3 cups of zucchini, just grated up both zucchinis that I had and put it all in! Anyway, I will make this again and again! Zucchini bread was a staple at both my mom's and my grandma's and this is the first I've made on my own - I will make it again and again! Thanks for the great recipe!

My favorite zucchini bread recipe so far of maybe 5 I've tried.  I've made it several times, tweaking it slightly each time.  As is this recipe has great flavor and texture.  Like other reviewers I like to use 1/2 c. applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil.  I add 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and eliminate the nuts.  The topping recipe I got from one of the reviews was a bit too crumbly and too much for my taste - I make my own topping of 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. flour, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 4 Tbsp. butter.  It freezes well, as I usually freeze one loaf.

Oh yum!!! This recipe is just the ticket for the perfect zucchini bread!!! I tried another recipe with more reviews first but it was not what I was looking for, but this one hit the spot!!! Make sure you bake for the full time sugested or it will cave on you, even if it looks done. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Love this recipe!  Newer ovens, watch the cook time.  Less is best.  Cooks faster in a glass loaf pan also.  Quick hint, I rub some butter or margarine on the top of the warm loaf right out of the oven.  Gives it a buttery flavor.  YUM

Very easy, moist and delicious.  Made exactly as written except substituted applesauce for half of the oil.  It doesn't change the result but it saves calories.

Very delicious, moist bread. I used 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 3+ cups of zucchini - and still could've used more, and substituted chocolate chips for the walnuts. Excellent!!

This was a good recipe.  I did make some changes too.  I added a cup of shredded carrots.  Instead of using 1 cup of oil, I used 1/2 oil, 1/2 canned pumpkin.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom and then the zest of one lemon.  I changed the sugar to brown sugar.  The crumb topping suggestion was delicious!

This recipe makes excellent bread and muffins!  (I split the batter between a loaf pan and muffin tin.)  I made a few changes to the recipe based on what I had around.  I used whole wheat pastry flour, half applesauce/half canola oil and half vegan sugar/half brown sugar.  I also threw in some lemon extract (

Very yummy & moist.  As so many other reviewers mentioned, I did top the zucchini bread with brown sugar streusal which made it very coffee cake like....I am going to serve it tonight warmed slightly with vanilla ice cream.  I used homestyle apple sauce instead of oil.  That made it healthier & very moist.  I also added a tsp. of nutmeg & a handful of raisins.  Also, I used whole wheat flour which made the cake a little darker in color but healthier.  I love this !!!!  SUPER YUM !!!!

It was done in 50 minutes for me, but it was easy to make and tasted great. I used fresh zuchini from the farmers market that was given to me for jumping the merchants car - lol.  And most certainly I will make this recipe again.

Something that is apparently not obvious, is that you need to peel and remove the "insides" of the zucchini.  I assumed that everyone did that, but apparently not everyone does.

This IS dryer than most zucchini bread, and I think that's why it raises more than other heavier loaves.  Everyone who has sampled my loaves (from this recipe) say they also prefer it to any other zucchini bread that they've had.  So, I don't understand the "it's average" comments.  I guess if you already like something, then why change it?

I've made it with and without walnuts; I think it's terrific both ways.

This is a good base recipe. I left out the nuts and used applesauce instead of oil, I also added ground cloves, nutmeg, ginger, and allspice to give it more flavor. I also used two zucchini probably measuring 3 cups, I think I could've added more if I wanted. Very moist.

Great recipe!  I made it for holiday gifts - with a few changes- and received rave reviews!
I used the previous suggestion of using 1 C. white & 1 C. brown sugar instead of 2 C. white.  I did not use walnuts. I also compared adding Hershey's cinnamon chips and choc. chips.  The cinnamon chips won by a landslide!! 
For baking I covered the pans with tinfoil for 50 min and then baked uncovered for 20 more min.  It turned out moister this way.
Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe is very easy...and everyone I've shared it with enjoys it.  I have substituted a heaping 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil, and used 1 1/2 cups sugar.  It's still delicious.

This recipe is great! I followed some suggestions of other reviewers such as using half applesauce and half oil. I also added about a tsp of lemon zest and a few dashes of cloves.  I would use less sugar next time though.  I also made one loaf and a dozen muffins from this recipe. A big hit with all who sampled, especially my 2.5 yo daughter!

I love this and so does everyone that tried it! I added carrots since I was short on zucchini. I also added more nuts and topped with powdered sugar. If you immediately wrap in plastic wrap it will keep the moisture in when cooling.

Great recipe-- kids love it! I don't add the walnuts as we have tree nut allergies in the family. Nice, even, small crumb texture. Smooth, moist. A hit with even my youngest children!

Used extra zucchini from the garden. I followed advice and did 1/2 applesauce (organic unsweetened) and 1/2 oil. I also tried the streusel topping recommended by another reviewer and used 1/2 the sugar.  I found it moist and not too dry.  I later made some for gifts in smaller loaves and some in muffin tins.

I make this several times a year. We love it with the addition of MaryKlaire's crumb topping (but don't always add that). We also make it as muffins for an on-the-go snack.

The recipe is perfect (minus the walnuts). When made plain you can put anything into the bread. Our favorite is almond slivers & chocolate chips.

This bread is delicious!! It is equally good if you use brown sugar instead of white, whole wheat or spelt flour instead of white, and it is really good if you replace the oil with plain greek yogurt.

This was very good, exactly what I was looking for! I followed the recipe as it was written, except I added chocolate chips at the request of my boyfriend. It was excellent. We couldn't possibly eat two loaves ourselves so the extra was served to visiting family members and they loved it as much as we did.

I loved this recipe!  I  halved the amount of sugar and used about 1/4 cup of raisins.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of apple sauce for the oil and used 2 cups of white flour and 1 cup of whole wheat.  It turned out absolutely amazing!  Very moist not too sweet and definitely something I will be baking again.

I've been using allrecipes for a while, but have never written a review.  This bread is exceptional!  I made it for a Father's Day brunch and it wowed everyone.  My only change was to use only half the oil and substitute to other half for applesauce.  Instead of only grating the zucchini, I will probably use some grated and some chunks in my next batch.  AMAZING!  Definitely a keeper!

I made this last night and it was very moist and tasty!  I had a bunch of zucchini that was about to spoil and was able to whip this together with ingredients I already had in the house!  I don't have loaf pans, so I used a bundt pan and it turned out great!

AWESOME!  This bread is delicious.  I used just 1 egg and 2 egg whites, substituted 1/2 c. of apple sauce for 1/2 c. of vegetable oil, and used mostly whole wheat flour and the bread was STILL fantastic!  I could not tell that I made any "healthy" subs at all, and that's a first for me.  Next time I'm going to try all apple sauce.

Loved it... I made it with the changes suggested I increase the zucchini, and used applesauce for half the oil and I put a crumble on top with dried cranberries and cherries with pecans and use pecans inside I only had one loaf pan so I made muffins and they are all gone...

Delicious!   I have always LOVED zucchini bread so when I found out my husband had never had it before I quickly searched for a recipe!    This recipe is a great "base"...I did make quite a few changes based off what others said and per my own preferances.  First, I completely replaced the oil was apple sauce, and cut the sugar to 3/4 a cup (btw:  I only made ONE loaf)  I also reduced the white flour and added some wheat germ.  Instead of just cinnamon/nutmeg I used pumpkin spice (trader joes if you're lucky enough to live around one has an EXCELLANT pumpkin spice - I use it for everything that calls for cinnamon!)  I think I probably used closer to two cups of zucchini too!  As suggested I made a crumb topping, and it came out SO amazingly moist.  I thought it was slightly undercooked, but its actually just the moisture from the extra zucchini etc!  My husband LOVED it!  This is a great bread to experiment with so have fun with it!  :)

Thank you so much for this recipe! My former admin. used to make this all the time and she would bring it in to work and it would be gone in less than an hour. It's been almost 4 years since I have had any zucchini bread... I guess I was really craving it because I'd eaten three slices before I offered any to my fiance! LOL- great, great, great

Recipe was great but i did add a little nutmeg and made the crunchy topping another reviewer suggested. The recipe for the topping was as follows:   "The crunchy crust recipe is this: -1 cup brown sugar -1 cup all-purpose flour -2 tablespoons butter or margarine -2 teaspoons cinnamon -1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Mix it all together really well and crumble on top of the batter prior to baking."  If you make the topping it calls for way to little butter to make the topping hold together - without about 4x the butter the topping will be powdery and simply fall off.   I have also used this recipe as a base for banana bread and works fine for that as well. For a little twist I added 12 oz of milk chocolate chips to the loaves - wasn't overpowering but left a hint of sweetness and chocolate.

I love this cake, but I substituted the vanilla with 2tsps rum flavoring, omitted the cinnamon and added 3/4C.unsweetened coconut flakes. Also substituted the walnuts for macadamia nuts. So, now we have a tropical zucchini bread!

Simply amazing! I only made one small change and that was cutting the oil down to 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce in it's place. I only had 1 loaf pan so instead of 2 loaves I made 1 and a dozen muffins (muffins only needed 30 min to cook). My 2 year old loved them and my parents just happened to stop over just as they came out of the oven, and they raved about them! This is a keeper :)

I loved this. it was moist with the perfect texture and I really liked the slight thickness of the crust. I did have to make a few unwanted changes. I only had 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, so I added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg as well. It still tasted amazing. My boyfriend enjoyed it so much he's taking half of my 2nd loaf to work tomorrow. The only thing I feel could have made this better is to date some finely chopped raisins or dates....like my mom use to ( takes me back to childhood)

This is wonderful recipe. I am waiting for more zucchini to grow in my garden to make more. I put my own twist in the recipe. I used olive oil in stead of veg. oil. I used 1/12 cup of surgar in stead of 2 cups. I used 4 egg whites in stead of 3 whole eggs. I added 2 extra teaspoons of baking powder. It turned out great.

I used 1/2 cup of apple sauce in place of 1/2 of the oil, 7 tsp of sweetener in place of 1 C of sugar. otherwise followed closely. I didn't peel the zucchini, and found that to not be a problem. Also, used wheat flour for half of the requirement.  Even with these changes, it came out great, moist, tasty, and a great way to use zucchini.  Will chop and freeze some zucchini to use later.  My first effort, and am quite happy with it.

I have been using this same recipe for several years and it is the best.  The bread is very moist and flavorful.  I highly recommend it!

Like so many other reviewers, I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce.  I also used 1/2 white flour and did a combination of whole wheat and oat flour for the other half.  I added raisins and chocolate chips along with the walnuts.  The one thing I tried and DO NOT recommend is using 1/2 the amount of sugar...it needed to be a little more sweet.   Next time I will add more cinnamon, nutmeg and perhaps some cloves.

Great recipe. I used canola oil and the crumb crust as mentioned earlier.  The crumb crust melts into the bread after a while and just adds that extra sweetness.  Great!

OMG..this is the BEST zucchini bread EVER! I have made other zucchini breads in the past, never to make again. This one will always be the one I make! The topping that the others have mentioned is GREAT! I added enough to cover the tops of my breads and then a little more...I still had more than enough topping left over that I didn't use. I also used 1/2 oil and 1/2 apple sauce, about 1/2 tsp nutmeg and about 1 cup more zucchini. This is such a moist bread, even a couple days later. Very flavorful! I made one with and one without the walnuts. My husband doesn't like zucchini but he loves this bread, especially the topping. Says it's the best zucchini bread he has ever had. Thanks for posting!

The first time I ever made zucchini bread I used this recipe and will never consider another recipe. I take it to parties and into the office and it is gone in the blink of an eye and people are always begging for me to make some more. I made a few alterations to make it a little more healthier and to give it more flavor. I used 1/2 cup of cinnamon apple sauce and added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Absolutely delicious. And DO NOT drain the zucchini after grated (it will make the bread nice & moist).

I took the suggestions of several reviewers to tweak this recipe, and the result was amazing!  I used 2 1/2 cups zucchini, used applesauce in place of half the oil, and added a streusel topping before baking.  I can't get enough of this stuff!

Wow, Wow, Wow,...I've been making zucchini bread for about 15 years.  This is by far the best recipe I've come across.  I followed it to an absolute T.  I made 1 loaf with it and the rest of the batter I made into mini mini muffins.  My kids devoured the muffins within minutes of making it.  This recipe is awesome.  Very moist and I will be making this super simple tasty bread again.  I did add brown sugar to the tops of the loaf and muffins before throwing it in the oven.  Thank You !!!

By far, the best recipe I have ever used!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and used half applesauce and half oil (although we only had strawberry applesauce, but it turned out great)  I also added a little nutmeg for good measure, lol.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  It will be the one I use from now on!

Tried this recipe and it was excellent!!  I took the suggestions of applesauce and the crumb topping and I also put dried cranberries instead of nuts.  The only thing I found is 1 cup of flour seemed to much and was I supposed to melt the butter for topping.  I didn't and it didn't seem to be crumbly.

Delicious.  I used the embellishments from the other folks and it went well.  I did not drain the zuchini, it was fresh from the garden so maybe that helped.

My husband arrived home from work last week with two huge target bags full of zucchini that a friend picked from his garden.  While the gesture was sweet...  I thought "what the heck am I going to do with these?!?"  I forgot all about zucchini bread and I looked up zucchini recipes on the Internet.  The first one I found was this one and boy am I glad I did!!!!!!
I made 14 loaves of it for my husband to hand out at work trying a diffrent variation in every batch.  I used olive oil in one batch which I saved for my family and it was delicious!!!!  I also used a bit more cinnamon in one batch, also great.  Adding chocolate chips makes a sneaky veggie treat for kids who are adverse to eating their veggies.
I loved the idea of using applesauce and oil instead of all oil!  All in all, I can say I love this recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I used 1/2 c. canola oil and 1/2 c. natural applesauce instead of 1 c. of oil and also added a whole c. of walnuts in the bread recipe.  I made this recipe as is with the topping:  The crunchy crust recipe I made: - 1 c. brown sugar -1/2 cup all-purpose flour - 3 T butter - 2 tsp cinnamon - 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  Mix it all together really well and crumble on top of the batter prior to baking.  It was good....but a little overpowering with cinnamon.  Next time I will only use 2 tsp. of cinnamon in bread and 1 tsp. cinnamon in the topping!  Then this will be 5 stars!!!

YUM! This bread was super easy to put together. I followed the suggestions from other members and added only 1/2 cup oil and replaced the other half with 1/2 cup no sugar added applesauce. The bread was very moist. I also added a crumb topping. Will definitely make this recipe again.

Oh my Goodness this is a fantastic recipe!!  This is my first year having zucchini and had no idea what to do with it.. So looking on line and finding your recipe, I thought this looks easy, and my goodness it was. 
I tried both, the one with 1 Cup of oil, and the one with 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce and we love them both.. The with applesauce took about 15-20 minutes longer to cook but they are both amazing. Thanks you so much.

I tried a couple versions of healthier substitutes.  The best combination:

Substitute 1/2 CHUNKY applesauce for 1/2 oil.  The apples are a fruit addition and the best substitution I tried.

Substitute whole wheat flour for white.  May consider a combination of soy flour, wheat and white to add a bit of protein. 

Instead of 2 cups sugar try 1 cup BAKING Splenda (different from regular splenda).

If using sweetened applesauce, maybe a little less splenda.

I also added a touch of ginger, and a bit more cinnamon.

Wonderful recipe! Although I took the advice of other reviewers and made my own streusel, minus about half the amount of flour suggested. The streusel of my first batch of bread tasted too much like flour, so I reduced the amount used by about half for the second batch and this time I think it was perfect. This also freezes extremely well, although I haven't been able to keep it in the freezer very long because it is gobbled up too quick!

This is the recipe you are looking for!It has the same moist, warm, incredible flavors in the zucchini bread I remember my grandmother making me. I also convert the recipe into muffins just by altering the oven temp. to 350 degrees and baking 15-20 minutes. Excellent!!

I am thrilled with the results of this recipe--it is the perfect consistency, and cooked perfectly evenly all the way through.  I added 2 tbsp. of flour, and cooked at 350 because I live at a high altitude (6000 ft.)  I will absolutely be making this again and again.  It is my new go-to quick bread recipe!

Very tasty but a tad too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will reduce the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I added 1 cup of raisins, which is probably why it tastes a little too sweet.

This is a great recipe.  I grated too much zucchini and stuck more than 3 cups in - it worked wonderfully!  Zucchini bread is one of my favorites and this one will be my recipe from now on.

This bread is easy to make and easier to eat!  I divided the amount of oil in half and substituted applesauce like other people did, which has no negative effect on the taste, and makes it more healthy.  The only other thing I altered was the amount of time a cooked it; as long as it was mainly done, reducing the time made the bread  even more moist and delicious!  This is a great giveaway treat.

This was my first time making zucchini bread and I was curious to see how it would taste. Not bad for my first try- I do think that 3C of sugar is too much and it made the bread a little too sweet for my liking but the fact that my husband sampled the bread was a miracle. He actually liked it. I nixed the walnuts because I didn't have any on hand and I followed the recommendation of others by using 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil. I will definetly try this recipe again but next time reduce the sugar and perhaps make muffins instead.

This is really good bread.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I would be interested in using half applesauce next time to replace some of the oil.  Great as is, though!

I made this a few days ago and it was a hit. I'm sure it would be great as is, but I couldn't help making a few changes. I subbed sour cream for half the oil. And I divided the batter in half, added 2 tbsp. baking cocoa to half and marbled the two together. I also omitted the walnuts. It was spicy, moist, and chocolaty. I'll definitely make it again.

Based on the ratings, I tried this recipe with high expectations. I followed the recipe and the suggestion for 1/2 c oil, 1/2 cup applesauce. I was disappointed that the bread turned out dry and bland. It may be because I live in a high altitude area?

I used a cup of unsweetened applesauce instead of oil, Splenda instead of sugar and pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon.  Bread turned out wonderful.  This recipe is a keeper.

This was my first time making this, I have always been curious as to it's taste. I have no other recipes to compare it to, but I thought it was very good. I took it to work and it was gone in no time. I received lots of compliments. Alot of them were about how moist it was. Thanks for a great recipe. I too doubled the zucchini.

This is a pretty flexible recipe. I used closer to 3c of zucchini that I whizzed through the cuisinart. Other subs: took out 1/2c oil and used 1.5c ground flaxseed; split the flour component evenly between wholewheat and white; split the sugar component evenly between white and dark brown. Would add more spice, perhaps ginger and a tiny bit of cloves, next time. No nuts. The cooking time was exactly 60 minutes for two loaves.

This recipe is definitely a keeper--tasted great! I used oat flour for half the flour (& added 1/4 c. more). For the oil I used 1/3 c. each of applesauce, butter, & oil. I also measured heaping teaspoons of cinnamon for an extra cinnamon flavor. My family ate this bread right up--I'll be making another batch soon!

Have made this recipe three times this season.  Has good all around flavor.  I just love zucchini bread.  It freezes so well.  Easy to make.  Sometimes after shreading the zucchini, I may have a cup more.  I just throw it in.  I put rounded teaspoons of cinnamon in too.  Our family loves cinnamon.  Kids love it in there lunches!!!  Will keep making this when I have extra zucchini.  Thanks!!

Excellent recipe, the whole family loved it and the kids didn't know that they were eatting zucchini...I also followed some previous suggestions and substituted unsweetened applesauce for the oil, used 3 cups of zucchini, and used 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  the next time I'll probably increase the walnuts to 1 1/2 cups.  I also made this with the crumb topping.  I made one loaf and the rest was put into a 8x8 pan that I baked for 40 minutes.  I will be making this again.

I replaced half of the sugar with splenda, half of the oil with applesauce, and made them into muffins.  I also left out the nuts - my three year old is not a fan.  Still so good! You can't mess this one up. In fact, when my family inhaled them, I was glad I had cut back on the sugar and fat!

I made this exact to the recipe. It tasted yum, but it missed out on the zuccini flavor, it was masked by all the sugar and spices. I might find a different recipe that focuses less on sweetness.

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! I made this original recipe first, and we liked it so much, that I was asked to bake another 2 days later. The 2nd time I ADDED 3 tablespoons of lemon extract to put a twist on it (decreased the vanilla to 1 teaspoon).  That made it a great summer time dessert! Also, to save on some calories and fat, I used 3/4 cup of natural apple sauce and just a 1/4 cup of oil.  No one could tell the difference and it turned out delicious.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Wonderful wonderful recipe...  I put applesauce in rather than oil because watching that much oil being poured into anything makes my heart want to stop.  Try that you guys, even in your brownies, it will be the best substitute you've ever done!  (cup for cup)  Also, someone below said it was obvious that the zucch should be peeled first, whaaa?   Every zucchini bread I've ever had has had the beautiful bits 'o green.  Use it all but the ends!  It was a huge hit with some of my husband's customers...  I got calls from them before he had even left the house call.  I will never be without this recipe during squash filled summers again!

This was way too oily, and I am in no way a health nut. It does stay moist, but the oil taste is thick. Other than that, the flavor is really nice--not too much cinnamon, like you'd expect. I'll try this recipe again, and just substitute or cut out some of the oil--I really don't think that much is even necessary.

I whipped this up while the rest of my dinner was cooking.  It was really good, quick and easy.  Even the kids liked it. I added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to the second loaf (yum). Good way to use up excess zucchini.

I baked this exactly as directed but omitted the nuts. I used a 9x5 pan and baked it  for 45 minutes. It was delicious. The slices I uploaded were reheated on day two and slathered with butter.

So, of course I did some changes but not all of the "suggested" ones.  I used 1/2 the oil and added applesauce, and I added another cup zucchini.  I think they turned out terrific, just like I remember from when my mom made it for me as a kid.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very Good!  I altered it a little bit to accommodate my daughters IBS and it seems to work out very well:
-instead of 1 cup of oil I used 3/4 cup of greek yogurt.
-instead of 3 eggs I used 6 egg whites
Otherwise, I used the recipe as written.  Moist and very tasty.

YUMMY! I made muffins instead of bread as I do not have a loaf pan :/ they turned out GREAT! This recipe made 18 muffins. I followed the ingredients pretty much to a "T". I used two golden zucchini and light colored vanilla. I have already eaten two (that's a secret). Thanks for this yummy recipe. :)

First made this bread to see how it would turn out.  It turned out wonderful!  Then I made it several times and took it as a communal morning snack at work.  My coworkers loved it!  After making it a few times, I decided to experiment and added 1/4 cup buttermilk.  Very moist and even more delicious.

YUM!  I made 4 little loaves from this recipe. And, because it was my first time making zucchini bread, I had to slice one right away and try it out. Three slices later and I had to tear myself away! I didn't change a thing! Excellent!

Love, love, love this recipe!  I am terrible at following recipes, but I like this one the way it is so I don't make any of my own adjustments...except to add chocolate chips once in a while.

So I have a ton of zucchinis in my garden and thought I would give this recipe a try, all I can say is OMG delicious, would not change a thing, I drain / squeeze the liquid out of the shredded zucchini before adding it to the mixture. It was exactly what I was looking for Thank you again for a wonderful zucchini bread, I would give it a 10 star if I could.

I followed the recipes exactly except I omitted the walnuts just because I didn't have any. I thought it was a little dry. It just seemed like it needed more flavor. We enjoyed them though. Maybe next time the nuts will go in to add more flavor.

This recipe was great and of course I tweaked a little for my taste.  Changed sugar to 1c white and 1c brown (will probably reduce next time to 3/4c white and 3/4c brown), added 1c coconut and upped the walnuts to 1c.  Yummy!

We all love this recipe - kids incluced. So much so that the KIDS have been begging me to make this again. Like others I make slight modifications - add 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the mixture and use whatever zucchini I shred up.  I let the batter sit in the pans while I make the topping which for whatever reason I think helps make things come together better.  For the topping I use 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup flour, 6 tbsp butter (we now only use Promise in our house), 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg.

High Altitude and quick breads often make for a soggy loaf, but this recipe (with the modifications below) made a beautifully fluffy and delicious bread. Thank you! Here are the modifications I used for lower fat and high altitude:
 In the interest of making it lower fat, I substituted pureed apples and nectarines (like apple sauce) for 1/2 the fat.
To allow for the dense quality which can come from using fruit instead of fat, I whipped the egg whites separately and added them with the zucchini.
For high altitude (we are 6000 ft) I cut the baking powder down by slightly less than 1/8 tsp. 
Baking time was just 50 minutes until the loaves were beautiful. I did double the recipe and I ended up with three large loaves and four mini loaves :)

Very moist, has great flavor, The only hange I made: I used the following; crunchy crust recipe: -1 cup brown sugar -1/2 cup all-purpose flour -1/2 cup rolled oats; ½ cup butter,2 teaspoons cinnamon -1/2 cup chopped walnuts, or pecans, blend sugar flour rolled oats, butter cinnamon with a pastry blender, till very course, then add walnuts, or pecans. Place topping on batter prior to baking. The topping cooks crisp. The bread would be good with out the topping, but we like it this way!  Thanks for this recipe!

This is the first zucchini bread recipe I've made that doesn't fall in the middle!  I've been eating and baking zucchini bread for years, but this recipe has just the right proportions for great taste and texture.  Soft/moist inside with almost a crunch on the outside.  Perfect!  Thanks for posting it, Kristen.

Loved this recipe. Added extra spice (nutmeg and clove) and swapped half the oil for apple sauce. I didn't have any baking soda, so I used a little extra baking powder and it came out delightfully fluffy. Also added a steusel topping, as others have mentioned. Yummo!

I followed a few of the reviews and did 1/2 apple sauce and 1/2 oil, added the topping, and increased the zucchini to 4 cups. This has been in the oven for an hour now and it is just now starting to hold its shape. Did doubling the zucchini completely kill it?

Very good! I reduced the amount of sugar, and did half white and  half brown sugar.  I also added an extra cup of zucchini.  It still turned out great, with lots of zucchini and not that sweet.  Made two loaves.

This was great. The cinnamon really made it wonderful. I did use half the fat and replace it with applesauce and I used half white and half wheat flour. My 9 year old son has requested another batch and that is saying something! Great recipe!

This zucchini bread is amazing! The only thing I changed was I added mini chocolate chips to it. It was eaten very fast at my work potlock and when we had an auction I dontated two loaves that went for 36 dollars!

This is the best recipe I have ever had for zucchini bread. I made some with nuts and some without. People were offering to buy loaves of it! Awesome recipe. I have also tried it with summer squash instead of zucchini. Very versatile!!

Great fall recipe!  I made a few changes based on the other reviews.  First, I cut the recipe in half because I didn't want 2 loaves.  I used 1 whole egg and 1 egg white to half the recipe.  They I used 1/4 C apple sauce and 1/4 C oil.  I also sprinkled raw sugar on top for a crunch.  Would reccommend to anyone!

Definitely the best zucchini bread recipe I have ever made. The kids love it and I can't wait to make it again but I eat so much of it when I make it that I try to give myself some time in between! (smile) I substituted apple sauce for 1/2 the vegetable oil, organic cane sugar for white sugar, and whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour. I also eliminated the walnuts. Yummy!!!

Was "gifted" a seven pound monster zucchini. Proceeded to make 14 loaves of bread. It's saying something when you can eat ALL of it in two weeks without getting sick of it. Gave some of it back to the original "gifter" of the zucchini and another one showed up with a note requesting more bread. Thanks, (I think,) for the awesome recipe. Next time I quadruple a recipe, I'll think about the size of my mixer.  :)

I did a few modifications to make the recipe healthier: substituted half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce, used 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup regular flour, and cut out 1/2 cup of sugar. I baked one loaf and then added 1/8 cup of cocoa powder to the second half to make into muffins. Delish!

really great recipe!! i followed the suggestions and used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil instead of a whole cup of oil. I used 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of brown sugar, a teas. of cinnamon, and 2 table. of butter as a crumble topping. Also, instead of nuts i used a cup of raisins which I first plumped up in some warm water (allergic to nuts unfortunately. But the bread turned out fantastic using these suggestions.

This is sooo GOOD!  Used 1/2c oil and 1/2c applesauce, egg whites instead of eggs and added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie season.  Also took the recommendation of the crumbly topping, used 3/4c brown sugar, 1/2c chopped pecans, 2 tablespoons butter, and 1/3c flour.. It was awesome!

Excellent! I added 1 additional cup of zucchini as others did, and it was moist and flavorful and wonderful.  I only used 1 1/2 cups sugar and that worked perfectly for me.  Might try 1 cup next time to see what happens.  I also made a crunchy topping like others suggested, but the bread was wonderful without it as well.  This made 6 mini loaves for me.

I actually substituted the zucchini for broccoli stalk (shredded). It tastes great, and I didn't have to throw away all of the stalk I had left over from dinner! I added the crumb top that was suggested and it was a wonderful addition.

I made this bread and it was awesome, my family loved it and I will defiantly make this again. I altered the recipe a little bit and used half oil and half applesauce and added about a half cup extra zuchini. For the topping I made a streusal made of brown sugar, flour, nutmeg, cinnamon, butter. You can really add anything as a topping for this bread and it will taste great.

works every time I do it. I sub apple sauce for the oil, and it turns out just fine. Also I used whole wheat flour. It gives it extra body.

This recipe was a HUGE hit at our house! I was reluctant at first to make this, seeing as how Zucchini was a main ingredient. Luckily I had a few extra zucchini's kicking around from the garden this year, so I decided it was high time to try something different. So glad that I did! I did make a few modifications though, as I believe a few others also suggested. First I halved the oil and substituted apple sauce. I also added 4 cups of grated zucchini, and not the listed 2 - this makes for an unbelievably moist bread. Plus it becomes translucent, which is a huge plus for those with kids - my daughter loved this bread and always asked for seconds. ;) I also added 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg, just a personal preference. Last but not least, I halved the walnuts and used a 1/4 cup of walnuts in one of the breads, and then used a 1/4 cup of chocolate chips in another. I figured the added sugar wasn't a big deal since I had already reduced the oil by half. I will definitely be making these again, and again. Yummm....

This was amazing!!!  I cut the oil in half and replaced with low fat sour cream.(had no apple sauce) I used two cups whole wheat flour and one cup white flour.  It tasted great, and I am picky about that.  I also added half a bag of chocolate chips.  My husband and I ate both loaves in four days.

I have made this recipe twice now and both times it came out wonderful! Like some others, I used the crumb topping on my first batch and it was amazing! The second batch I made them into muffins with no topping and I still loved it! My husband loves them too.  I opted to use 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the full cup of oil.  Very moist! I will be making this again and again. Thanks!

Fantastic! My six year old nephew called me just to say how much he loved this bread. He asked for an extra serving in his lunch box and for more of it on his birthday! I cut the oil in half and used half non-fat plain yogurt instead. I also used half the cinnamon and substituted the other half with allspice. I did put in half a cup of chocolate chips for an extra level of flavor. Next time I will double the amount of zucchini. Thanks for the recipe.

I have never made zucchini bread before.  I substituted applesauce for the oil and used whole wheat flour.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts, because that is what I had on hand.  I made 4 mini-loaves, and it turned out great!  Nice and dense, good flavor.  Wasn't sure about the struesel topping as others had suggested, but will definitely try next time.  Already had people come over and ask me to make it again!  Thanks for a great first experience.

This bread was a hit!! Instead of baking powder I used 1/4 teaspoon baking soda plus 1/3 cup molasses. I also added the crumbly crust that Maryklaire, another user suggested. The taste was really rich and yummy. It will be my new holiday bread!

OH My goodness! This truly was delicious! My kids said you wouldn't even know there was zucchini in it. I did take the advice of the other reviewers and did 1/2c. oil & 1/2c. applesauce; also added 1/2 c. more of zucchini. It was one of the most delicious breads I've ever made.

This is an amazing recipe. I didn't even know I liked Zucchini Bread so much. I originally looked up the recipe because I grow zucchinis in my garden and needed to learn ways to prepare them. This is so delicious!

This recipe like it is, is HORRIBLE.  It was so dry that I could not get it down my throat.  Reduce the flour to 2 cups and the oil to 2/3 cups and you will have much better bread.

When I first read the ingredients I thought the listed amount of vegtable oil was a lot, but followed the recipe as written anyway, and found the bread to be extremely heavy and greasy. I make this every summer, but lost my fave recipe, and I have to say if I use this one again I may try 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead.

This zucchini bread is awesome!  I love zucchini bread, but had never made it myself.  My husband and I made the bread last night.  It was quick and easy and so so yummy, very moist. :o)  After we split the batter in half, we put 1/4 cup of walnuts in one batch and topped that loaf with the crumbly mixture someone else suggested and in the other we put about 1/3 cup of chocolate chips.  We couldn't wait to eat it because it smelled so good as it was baking.  This will definitely be our zucchini bread recipe that we'll make every year!!

This recipe I added 2 bananas and used slightly more cinnamon. I also squeezed out extra water from zucchini before adding. Wow! Loved the texture and was still moist. The men here at work dug into it as soon as I put it down on the counter. They want more :) Thank you for sharing, I will use this one again.

This was my first attempt at zucchini bread and it turned out perfect.  Will definately make it again very soon, but will add a touch more cinnamon and possibly use the half oil/half applesauce idea.

I made one loaf and 8 mini loaves from this recipe (cooked mini loaves approx 32 min).  I did use 1/2 oil & 1/2 applesauce and topping as other reviewers recommended (next time I will halve MaryKlaire's topping recipe or try KellyC's).  I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had on hand.  I'm sure this recipe is great without the topping, too.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

I baked this bread yesterday, followed the directions exactly, except for the nuts. It was delicious. I baked on a mini bundt pan for 6. I had enough batter for 12. This morning we ate the last 2 and they were super moist. This is your ultimate zucchini bread.

love this recipe, been using it for years. now, on a new health kick, i have substituted 1 cup of strawberry puree for the oil. it makes these super healthier and utterly more fruity and delicious. i also do a dash of nutmeg, and a handful of whatever dried fruit is on hand...a la raisins, craisins, currants, etc... :)

This bread was excellent!  My boyfriend and daughter both said, "Zucchini? I'm not eating that" and then proceeded to gobble it up.  I made one loaf and 12 muffins from this recipe.  Will definitely make again!

I made this bread to distribute around the holidays - my first time baking gifts for people, and EVERY recipient raved about it.  Most asked for the recipe to make again.  Simple, delicious and the best part is one mix of batter bakes two loaves!  Freeze the second if you make it for home.  Excellent recipe - thanks so much.

Extremely good! I also use half applesauce, half oil. It's half the fat, plus it adds a little extra moistness. I always use this recipe!

Great at high altitude as well -- coming from Denver Colorado.  I had trouble with my classic zucchini bread recipe that I brought from Oregon with me, so I stopped making bread -- it never turned out!  This recipe changed all that for me.  Now my family enjoys homemade zucchini bread once again!  Thanx!

Not a big zucchini eater but I love this bread--and so do my kids! The only difference is I add an additional tsp. of vanilla and I don't use nuts. A great recipe that's now in my file!

This recipe is soooo DELICIOUS. i have tried many many recipes and none tasted this good, so delicious and moist, but not too moist, like some i've made that are mushy. I ended up having to do a teaspoon and a half or nutmeg and teaspoon and a half of cinnamon because i rean out of cinnamon and couldnt put in all 3 teaspoons, and that was delicious, a added the 1/2 oil 1/2 applesause (apple sause, yogurt, sourcream, or mayo makes bread and cakes moist) and made the crumble topping with pecans and didnt add the nuts to the bread because my boyfriend doesnt like them, i ate it all in about 2 days it was sooo good. thank you so muc for such an awsome TO DIE FOR recipe!

Awesome recipe. My husband and my co-workers can't get enough of this bread. Will be baking and freezing loaves to give at Christmas! I used 3 cups of zucchini, 4 cups made the bread too moist and took longer to cook.

I make it often and so does a friend that I gave this recipe to.  We use 1/2 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. oil.  Only use 1 1/2 c. sugar.  Check bread after baking 55 min.

I made this bread as is and with some of the suggestions. All versions were great. Added 1-2 extra cups of zucchini to all batches, added 1 C. raisins to one batch, and 2 C. carrots to another both were gobbled up before the oven even cooled! I also made some with all white sugar and some with 1/2 white/brown sugar, once again, both versions great. I even made some in mini muffin pans for bite size treats. The kids loved them. I don't think you can make a bad batch of this delicious bread. I'm hoping it freezes well. I'm putting some in the freezer for Christmas Goodie baskets.

This is amazing! I took some suggestions and did 2 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg. I didn't do half oil/half applesauce since I wanted to be able to compare the two, but next time I will try this.

I made the crumble mixture but did 1 cup brown sugar 1/2 flour and no nuts since I'm allergic.

It was amazing!

Extremely delicious.  It is very moist and I love the hint of the cinnamon flavor!  I followed the recipe to the T and it turned out perfect!  My husband and I ate the entire loaf in 1 day!!  I decided to make another one for a dinner party I am throwing tonight.

Delicious! I cut down on the oil by following the 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce suggestion. I didn't change anything else from the original recipe and it turned out wonderful.

Great recipe. I use the 1/2 applesauce 1/2 oil combo, crumbs, and also sub about half the flour for whole wheat. It will come out dry if you put in too much whole wheat flour, so I use either less flour or a little more applesauce. I'm used to the dry whole wheat texture, so if you really want to make a zucchini bread to impress, maybe go with all white flour, but definitely use the crumbs! Yum!

Since I am diabetic I used splenda brown sugar blend instead of the white sugar, (1 cup splenda blend = 2 cups sugar) I was out of white sugar blend.  I used the applesauce (Motts no sugar added) substitute for the full oil and only added about 1 Tablespoon of oil.  One batch I added walnuts the other raisins  I included the nutmeg suggested by one reader but not the crumb topping.  I baked in 4 mini loafs for 40 minutes  The texture was great, moist and very tasty, but a bit too sweet for my taste though my husband and kids loved it.  Next time I would reduce the brown sugar a bit to approx 3/4 cup and I WILL make this again with white sugar blend.

This was so yummy! I too halved the oil adding 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 applesauce. I changed the sugar as well adding 1 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup blackstrap mollasses. Was plenty sweet enough and a little healthier.
Made 1 loaf and 12 muffins(muffins cooked in about 25 min.)
Definitely will make it again. The kids loved them too.

This was absolutely delicious.  I did not try a crumb topping, but DID throw in a generous handful of chocolate chips. Didn't have nuts, so left those out. I told my 3 and 5 year old boys that it was "Chocolate Z-bread" to avoid making reference to anything nutritious... They (and their big sister) ate it all up and begged for more.  Next time I'll try it as mini muffins with a crumbly topping.

Very good!  Everyone loved it.  I made 18 muffins from this recipe.  I did what others suggested by using half oil, half applesauce and I used a cup of chocolate chips and a cup of walnuts.  Very moist.  I will be making these again.  Thank you.

great recipe,  you can even decease the oil used.  I use light olive oil for baking, and drop it to about 3/4 a cup, then I increase the zucchini by about another 1/2 cup.

This is really good.  Like other reviewers, I made a few minor alterations:  half oil, half cinnamon applesauce; half white sugar, half brown sugar; three cups of zucchini; and I added a little freshly-grated nutmeg.

It didn't rise quite as high as I'd hoped, but that could be because I used nonstick cooking spray instead of grease/flour.  I think flour helps it climb the sides.  Overall--delicious!

I tried this bread based on the high rating.  Unlike others, I made this bread exactly as written.  I did not substitute a thing.  It wasn't horrible, but it was a bit bland and dry for my family's liking.

Came out just a little dry, though I'm not sure why.  Easily remedied, for the most part, by a generous pat of butter on each slice!

I didn't add the walnuts to the bread, as I don't care for nuts much.  However, I did follow many of the suggestions and made a crumble topping out of 1/2 c each walnuts, brown sugar, flour, and butter in the food processor.  My daughter ate the leftover topping straight out of the bowl.

My flour sifter has gone missing, and I could definitely tell as I bit in to the occasional clump of flour in the finished bread.  (That might also explain why it was dry, if I added too much un-sifted flour)  Definitely make sure you can sift the flour in to keep it from lumping in the mixing.

This is a very easy bread and was well received.  I subed 1 & 1/2 cup of splenda for the sugar leaving 1/4 cup "real" sugar for each loaf making it a little more acceptable for the diabetics and weight watchers in the family.

Pretty good. I did use the crunchy topping but I think it still needed a little something. I'll try using nutmeg also the next time.

I cut this recipe in half to make just one loaf, using one egg and half an eggshell of water. BIG MISTAKE...Sure, the bread turned out  very well, but the one loaf disappeared way too fast! :) Make the whole thing if you can, because this recipe is definitely worth it!

This was my first attempt at zucchini bread and I saved the recipe to use again.  I substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil, added an extra cup of zucchini and used the crumb topping as suggested by others.  The bread is nice and moist and very tasty!

This is a great bread recipe.  I also used the crumble crust topping that many others suggested and it was delicious!  I used half of the recipe for the topping for four mini loaves and still had some left.  I plan to make more this week and put it in the freezer.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Just made it... couldn't keep out of it before it cooled :X  I didn't use eggs/dairy and it still turned out fine with the subsitutions (also 2:1 WW Pastry Flour to AP Flour, evaporated cane juice for white sugar, 1:1 apple sauce/oil)... I added chocolate chips to one half; walnuts to all.  Not overly strong with zucchini but still GOOD!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding the brown sugar, butter topping, like suggested from a previous review.  It added a crusty topping.  This was absolutely delicious.  My children and husband couldn't get enough.  I will definately make this again!

wonderful bread, I followed what MaryKlaire did for topping in the reviews and it did make it awesome.
If this bread doesn't work for you, you simply can't bake.

The only reason I made this recipe is because  a chinese woman that I work with gave me a whole bunch of squash. Therefore, I was skeptical when I made this. However, I have to admit it was amazing. It tastes more like bannana nut bread than zucchini.

This was a really good recipe. The only complaint I have was I expected more of a zucchini taste. It tastes more like a spice cake. Maybe next time I will add more zucchini. But, I will make it again for sure.

I can't believe how good and moist this bread is. I pretty much followed the recipe, only making a couple small "healthy" changes - 2 parts whole wheat flour & 1 part all purpose, applesauce in place of oil, and egg beaters in place of eggs. I also added a little nutmeg...

This recipe turned out great. I have never had zucchini bread before but have far too many growing in my garden, so I tried this recipe. The bread was moist, and it has the right amount of cinnamon as to not be overwhelming, but in combination with the other ingrediants is very flavorful. I can see why this recipe is a favorite.

I liked this recipe, but, I think I was expecting more intense zucchini flavor. I did mess around and use whole wheat flour (which I sifted) and subbed applesauce for the oil. I also toasted the walnuts. The bread was very moist and it goes down easy but it just tastes like bread. Maybe I should stick to banana bread! I just happpend to have extra zucchini on hand. Good recipe.

Outstanding recipe! I used 1/2 c. veggie oil and 1/2 c. applesauce, and less sugar (1 & 1/2 c. instead of 2 c.), and I strained the zucchini after putting it thru the cuisinart (it tends to be very watery). Also used lowfat bisquick instead of flour, baking powder & baking soda, and found the bread to be very appealing in texture. Because I used the bisquick, I split the mixture between a loaf pan and a 6 muffin tin, as I was afraid it would rise too much. I removed the muffins after 50 minutes at 325, and they were perfect. The loaf pan stayed an extra 10 minutes, but probably could have used an extra 5-10 minutes. Note that this batter appears very liquidy, but it bakes into a lovely bread. The finished product got rave reviews!

This was so easy and yummy. I did make a few changes, I used 1/2 C. oil and 1/2 C. natural apple sauce and instead of 2 loaves I made 1 and 8 regular sized muffins. I also added raisins to the muffins. This is a keeper!

My Grandmother was the baker of the Zucchini bread. As time went on she couldn't anymore. I found this recipe and it use all the same ingredients.  I made it and gave her a loaf. She gave me the biggest compliment.  "Just like mine" she said. She passed away in Aug - This will be the bread I will make from now on.  Thanks!!

I thought this recipe was just OK. I didn't think it would have been very good if I had not make the following changes: I used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar. Also I took another reviewer's advice and added both nutmeg and  ground cloves. I did double the cinnamon which was good or it would have been had to tell it was there.
I use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil to substitute for the 1 cup oil. My family thought it was good, I just thought it was rather heavy in texture.

Excellent recipe--moist and fragrant!  Some changes I made:  I used 1 cup of white sugar, 1 cup of brown sugar, a full tablespoon of vanilla extract, and two small overripe mashed bananas.  I also buttered the pans and then sprinkled sugar on the bottom and sides of them so that the crust of the bread would come out cripsy and sweet.

I've been making almost this recipe for years.  every summer I make a dozen or more loaves and freeze them.  Then a slice at breakfast all winter long.  I use 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar.  I also add 12 tsp of baking powder.  And I use 2 t of McCormick's Imitation maple flavor.  I think the maple flavor and brown sugar add a lot to the flavor.  EXCELLENT !!!

First of all, I got this recipe out of the All Recipes cookbook so knew it had to be good to be included. Boy was I right, this bread is sweet and flavorful and don't forget the moistness..WONDERFUL.. I did add chocolate chips first time and didnt the second and will be adding chips from now on. I tried semi sweet and were kind of bitter. Tried milk chocolate and now it is perfected!! This will be a staple sweet bread in our house.

I have a lot of zucchini in my garden and today I baked four loaves of zucchini bread IV. It is very good. Better then my other recipe I've been baking. 
Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I don't really like real heavy zucchini bread so I patted the zucchini with paper towels to draw out some of the water.  It stil came out real moist and real good!  Thank you so much!!!  Update on review:  It is very important to beat the eggs exactly the way the directions say, it makes the bread so much fluffier.

Delicious! Very moist and the cinnamon taste was perfect.  I added 1/2 cup of walnut and 1/2 cup of raisins and
it came out great!  A great Christmas gift.

I'm not a baker, but this zucchini bread was easy to make. It came out slightly crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. And the taste was heavenly!

I just made two batches of this recipe. One batch I made into loaves with regular AP flour. For the other batch I made gluten free muffins using a GF all purpose mix in place of the flour. Other changes include half vegetable oil and half coconut oil. I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I am thrilled that they both came out perfect and delicious - even the gluten free!

Coworkers loved it, requested the recipe. Changes made: I doubled the amount of zucchini (currently have an abundant supply) and I doubled the baking soda on the last batch which increased the rise on the bread.  I substituted chocolate chips for the walnuts, you must stir them in or they sit on top.  Going to try the crumb topping suggested in another review next time.

I'm usually very picky about my ratings. I don't just go around giving 5 stars so you know this recipe is a keeper! It was so moist, and sugary and yummy! Made one big loaf and a bunch of mini loafs. I'm a new baker and cook being only 14, but this was easy to make as well! I've handled some much harder recipes but whenever I bake it usually turns out okay at best. I had leftover Zucchini from Zucchini Cakes I made along with Crab Cakes for my Vegetarian Cousin at Thanksgiving. I hate throwing out food so I decided to look for a quick recipe. Because of the amount of Zucchini I had I doubled the recipe and though the batter looked imtimidating in size I'm glad I did! My family couldn't keep their hands off! Even my dad loved it! Not only has he steered clear of vegetables his entire life but he also hates sweets. However he ate more of this than anyone in the family!

i looked at many different recipes and all the reviews convinced me that this was the one! from this recipe, i ended up making two sets of muffins and one bread. in the muffins i put chocolate chips and walnuts, but to be honest i think they  would have been better left alone. As everyone recommended i susbsituted half the oil with apple sauce. Also, i added 1/3 tsp of nutmeg, a little extra vanilla, and 21/4 cups sugar and the other 1/8-1/4 cup i used stevia- the bread is moist and delicious!

The absolute best bread! My husband is mildly allergic to bananas so this bread is the perfect substitute for banana bread. It's quick to put together and only lasts a few days. It's typically breakfast, if not a snack. It's my go-to bread for play dates and game nights. I leave the nuts out and it's still amazing!

I thought this was very good. I held back on 1C sugar and added a little agave. Next time Im going to try to use Coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.

My grandma's recipe is almost identical to this one, however, it has 1 less cup of flour. The bread is really moist and freezes and defrosts very well.

I have been making this recipe for my 3rd year now. I haven't found a better one. I love sweetness so omitted the nuts and substituted chocolate chips. It is a major hit.

I am completely amazed how much our 3-1/2 year loves this zucchini bread recipe. She would rather have this for breakfast and again for snack. Thank you for this recipe, it's becoming a weekly request at our house.

This recipe is great and I just made it in Spain where the idea of zucchini bread is revolutionary. I halved the amount of sugar and found it to be plenty sweet. A reduction of oil to 2/3 of a cup would probably be fine too. Enjoy and if you make it in Europe, mention the zucchini after it's been enjoyed!

I made the mistake of squeezing the water out of the zucchini which resulted in very dry bread. Will attempt again, as flavor was very good. (Added raisins, 1/2 t nutmeg, and used oil and applesauce in equal amounts. Also, used half sugar, half Splenda, to decrease calories.

A great way to hide veggies from the kids!
I followed the recipe almost exactly; except I did not have enough white sugar, so mixed a cup of brown with it - tasted fine. 

Easy to make, great flavor. My two year old who dislikes all veggies has asked for more "uhh-cini" bread. She's sold and so are we! I'll make this for a great summer treat. 

I think this would also be amazing with the sugar/nut topping that some other people suggested; I did not try it, but I think it would be great.

So good! I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and swapped half of the oil for applesauce like many reviewers suggested. I didn't add a crumb topping like others have because I just didn't have the time. It's a great bread without it... and a little healthier. Either way, you can't go wrong :)

Everyone loves this bread when I make it.  I wouldn't change a thing.  
Just one time I didn't have enough oil only about 4 oz.   and substitued a 4oz applesauce and it tasted so yummy!

1 cup of oil is too much so I replace half with unsweetened applesauce. I added half tsp of nutmeg, followed some suggestions from others and added the crunchy crust as well, then this turned out great.

I love this recipe although I had to cut it in half because I'm only one person and do not have a lot of freezer space.    I ran into the problem having 1.5 eggs so I tried with one egg and 1/2 a banana.  Amazing! The bread is not overpowered by the banana at all and adding a ripe banana allowed me to cut the sugar down a lot.   Along with some of the other suggestions by reviewers (apple sauce and wheat flour) it is not that hard to make this bread pretty healthy and yummy.

used one half oil and replaced the other with applesauce 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 1/4 cup white used pecans and baked in a tube pan 65 min. It came out perfect, excellent flavor and texture. Not overly sweet just right. Thinking of trying a maple glaze over the top next time...I will be making this again as I can't stop eating it!!

This recipe is fantastic. I did follow the review from MaryKlaire and added one more  cup of zucchini, and I did NOT drain the zucchini. It did take 70 minutes on 325 F. I made one loaf with the crumb topping from MaryKlaire and one without . The crumb recipe , I did not add as much sugar. For one loaf I used 1/4 c. This is a MUST TRY RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This bread is the best I've had! I use 3 cups of zucchini, no nuts, the crumb topping with 3/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 2 tsp cinnamon, and 3 tbsp melted butter. It's a wonderful recipe!!!!

Your search for the perfect zucchini bread can end HERE!  This is it - absolutely perfect as written, never fails.  Of course, I do have to call it cinnamon bread in order for my kids to eat it, but they LOVE IT!!!  1 has even asked for this bread in lieu of a birthday cake this year!  SO GOOD!

Really good standard zucchini bread recipe that makes a no-fail treat. The only change I made was adding 1/2 cup applesauce in place of half the oil, and leaving out the nuts. Very good!

Outstanding! Rave reviews from everyone. My six year old clarified..."I have got to tell you, this is not BREAD, it's CAKE!" Yummm.  We substituted 1/3 or 1/2 of the white sugar with succanut, and  1/2 of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour (not ww bread or ww all-purpose flour). If you don't want to loose any sweetness, just use 1/3 part succanut. Everyone one loved the crunchy top. No need to wrap up, just leave in pan with parchment paper from baking and stays plenty moist and the top will stay crispy...for the better part of a week.

Made a few improvements: substituted 1/2 cup oil with 1/2 unsweetened applesauce; reduced sugar by 1/2 cup (could reduce it to one cup); used Ener-g egg replacer as my son is allergic to egss; added 3 tbsp of ground flaxseed.  Turned out moist and yummy.  Next time though I will further modify by adding more cinnamon and vanilla extract and reducing sugar to just 1 cup.

Quite delicious! You can't even tell there is a vegetable in there. I did add half the crumble topping recipe, but added more butter to make it clump together better. I will be making this again and again.

My first time making and eating zucchini bread. Used 1/2 the oil and then 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt. Cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, should've cut it a little more since I added yogurt but wasn't thinking. Besides it being a smidge too sweet this was absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS! Moist, flavorful (without a hint of zucchini-ness) just dense enough. Soo good. My 3 critics (children ages 20, 11 & 10) all had 2nd helpings and none of them like zucchini. Will make in the future. Probably many, many times.

My husband LOVED this recipe. He was doubtful when I told him I was making Zucchini bread but he was pleasantly surprised. I made a basic fruit dressing for a grape salad earlier in the day which I spread onto a warm slice for him. He took a loaf and the rest of the fruit salad dressing to his brothers house to watch a football game. It was a HUGE hit!  Here's the fruit dressing: 8 oz. cream cheese softened 8 oz. sour cream 1/2 c. sugar 1 T. vanilla extract Beat all ing. together well Enjoy!

Yum.  2nd time making this bread. Like others I did 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil.  1st time I made it I did all applesauce and no oil, other than that stuck to the recipe.  This time I added 2 large grated carrots.  Also used 1 cup flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup almond flour.  Added dashes of ginger, cloves, and nutmeg.  So, I guess I changed the recipe a bit huh.  Well, it turned out great.  Both times. Made one large loaf and 13 mini-muffins.  Will be making this again.

I have made a few revisions to this to make it even better.  I use 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar (instead of 1 cup white sugar), add 1/2 tsp of ground cloves, and use 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil (instead of a full cup of oil).  Love this one, my kids don't even notice there is zuccini in it ;)

I made this bread exactly as printed. It was good, but I wouldn't say it is awesome.  I might try some other zucchini bread recipes on this site.

Very moist and delicious! I sprinkled a cinnamon-sugar mixture on top to give it a nice sweet topping.

Wonderful!  I used half whole wheat flour and decreased the sugar to 1/1-2 cups and it was still delicious.

This bread is awesome! I have made it twice, and each time I made it with the topping that one reviewer suggested. I do add a touch more flour just because, when people say that it is super moist usually translates to doughy, I have not had that problem with this bread. Thanks for such a great recipe.

Good stuff! I did the half oil half applesauce thing only cause ran out of oil. Turned out great, Had to cook a lil longer than posted...I think because my loaf pans were smaller. Loved that it made 2 loaves, have one @ home & send one off to work with my husband!

This is THE BEST zucchini bread I have ever tasted!  I have been baking it for 2 years now and will never change recipes.  I have made dozens of loaves and given them as tasty (inexpensive) gifts.  I have two loaves in the oven right now!

Oh my goodness, perfect! Only change... half oil half applesauce. I quadrupled this and did half with nuts and raisins, half without. And now I have 6 loaves and 4 mini loaves to pass out :)

Unfortunately, I followed the advice and did 1/2 the oil, 1/2 applesauce and it was way too dry.  Also did the nutty/cinnamon and sugar topping which turned out well.  I think I would have been delicious if all the oil was used.

UPDATE: I have made this several times since my review, and I still think it is the best base zucchini bread recipe I've found.  I upped the zucchini ratio a bit to about 2 1/2 cups just as a personal preference, and the last time I made this I put all the batter in a bundt pan and baked it that way instead of in 2 loaf pans, and my bf and I both agreed this is our favorite way so far, the top got nice and crunchy and the inside was still so moist.  Try it!

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Made this with no changes and it turned out wonderfully!  It has a rather present cinnamon/vanilla taste, but I like that in my bread so I thought it was great.  The texture was spot on.

This recipe was great.  I made several substitutions to make it healthier since my boyfriend and I are trying to eat better.  Replaced half the oil with 3/4 cups of unsweetened applesauce; replaced one of the eggs with egg white.   I will definitely make this again and again and again.

I added a 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and also a handfull of raisins.  My family could hardly wait for the loaves to cool.  We polished off an entire loaf within 10 minutes.  We will have the other loaf in the morning for breakfast!  This recipe is a definite keeper!!  Thank you!

I just made this recipe. It turned out moist and has a good flavor. The only thing different I did was use four mini loaf pans and baked them for 45 minutes. May add extra zucchini next batch.Will use this recipe again.

This bread did not hit the mark for me. My main complaint is the was too much cinnamon and lacked complexity. It just tasted like cinnamon bread. I did use 1/2 veg oil and 1/2 applesauce with great results. I will not make this again.

I was given a very large zucchini yesterday and could not find my usual recipe so used this one.  It is fabulous, like others I felt the topping part was way too much so next time I'll cut it in half.  I did add an extra cup of the zucchini but other than that I followed the recipe and it was perfect!  Thanks!!

I took the advice of the other members and substituted applesauce for the oil...this is by far the best zucchini bread recipe I've tried! We have tons of zucchinis in our garden, and they are so big that one zucchini yields enough to make three loaves, which rarely last 4 days! We needed a good zucchini bread recipe because of all the zucchini we have and this works perfectly! We've given 2 loaves to each of our neighbors and I bring a loaf into work everyday. Everyone loves it and, to be honest, I've been claiming that this recipe has been in our family for years...lol now only you guys know the truth!

This was a fantastic recipe that I'll use again. I used 1/2 c of oil and 1/2 c of applesauce.  I also used flaxseed in place of the eggs.  It is sweet, moist with a crunchy crust.    Thanks for submitting Kristen!

I slightly altered the recipe as suggested by others by adding some extra zucchini (about 3/4 cup) and used 1/2 cup of plain yogurt in place of 1/2 cup oil; otherwise I followed the recipe.  It was not nearly as good as my old family tried and true recipe.  It is not likely that I will use this recipe again.

Very good recipe!  I was out of sugar (gasp!) so I used 1/2 brown sugar and it made the loaves very moist! Also, I substituted coconut oil for 1/2 the oil.  I wanted to do a topping like others had recommended, but was running short on time and ingredients. So, I sprinkled brown sugar and cinnamon over the top of the unbaked loaves then baked them. When they came out I put a couple small pats of softened butter on top and let it sit until the butter melted and soaked into the loaves... SO YUMMY!

I didn't do the crumb crust, as I just threw it all in a bundt pan and baked. I also did not add nuts, but instead mini chocolate chips so the kiddos love it. I did add a 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and used half oil, 1/2 applesauce as others. Otherwise I left the same and it turned out very well. It took about 60 minutes in the bundt pan. Yummy.

I made some changes to this recipe as well and am very pleased with the results!  1 Cup Oil changed to 1/2 C oil and 1/2 C Unsweeted Applesauce 2 Cup white sugar changed to 1 C white and 1 C light brown sugar 2 Cup Zucchini changed to 2 C yellow squash Added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and omitted the nuts.  I also used the topping that was recommended however only used half the amount and saved the rest for the next batch.  My breads did not rise like they should however my husband said it was NOT BAD so that means this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing your recipes and tips!

Totally delish!!! My daughter wouldn't taste it, but my three sons gobbled it up like no tomorrow!  I replaced half the oil with applesauce, and it was still very moist. I also added streusel topping.  Finally, I baked half in a loaf pan as directed, and half in 12 muffin cups.  Fantastic!!! And for those who are hesitant because it's zucchini: it does not taste like zucchini at all.

Oh my goodness...  Sooo good.  Only changes I did was to substitute half the sugar for splenda and half the oil for plain yogurt.  Also, I baked in muffin tins (the recipe made 2 dozen) for 22-23 minutes.  Dense, sweet...  yum!!! I've made 2 batches already!  Perfect with my coffee for an easy breakfast on the go.

I have used this basic recipe & manipulated the ingredients often depending on mood.  It has been great every time.  I like substituting 1C oats for 1C of the flour.

Excellent!  This bread is moist and delicious and it is always terrific to get two loaves.  I have made it many, many times, just as the recipe states, and it is always perfect.  I also sub 1 cup of whole wheat flour much of the time and you can't tell the difference.  So good!

Delicious.  I substituted applesauce for the oil and used whole wheat flour.  Because I added the applesauce, I cut the sugar in half.  I also added a handful of chocolate chips.  Wonderful recipe.

My friend and I both followed the recipe exactly (or so we thought) and it just came out way too dense and somewhat tasteless.  Others liked it but I have tried too many zucchini bread recipes to think this was anything special.

This recipe rocks!  But, true to form, I had to tinker with it.  It's great as-is, but I added equal parts grated carrot to the zucchini, and raisins as well as walnuts....and some nutmeg.

Good recipe.

I dry my Zucchini out a bit different. I sprinkle the Zucchini with sugar, not salt as suggested by another member.

And it works great! I also do it to the carrots I put in my carrot cake.

And I have to agree, while yummy this is still a quick bread and not the most nutritional snack in the world.

Very moist and good!
I substituted 1 cup oil for 1/2 cup, and used 1/2 cup applesauce instead.

Make sure you squeeze excess moisture from grated zucchini.

Following the advice of some other reviews, I substituted 1/2 of the oil for applesauce. I also used half of what the recipes called for of cinnamon because the applesauce had some. I omitted the nuts b/c I was out. The bread turned out great! Next time I plan to try the crumb topping that others have suggested.

This recipe was de-lish!  I made muffins instead of loaves, which I cooked for about 25 minutes and I followed the recipe exactly except for adding some ground nutmeg.  Would DEFINITELY make this one again!

This bread came out so moist and tasty.  I added some blueberries that I needed to use up from going blueberry picking and that was really good too.  But I'm sure even without the blueberries this bread is a real blue ribbon winner.

WOW is this good!!  I did make a few minor changes by replacing 1/2 of the oil with applesauce, and 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour, then added about 1/4 cup flax seed meal.  It turned out fantastic!  I know I'll have to make more in a couple days!

This was my very first zucchini bread! I've made it twice now, and I did get brave and add a dash each of allspice and nutmeg. It was delicious right out of the oven. Even my parents were impressed.

good! I did change it a little. I used butter instead of oil. I used 1 1/2 cups sugar, 4 cups zucchini, 1 teaspoon baking powder, and no nuts.

I made this recipe with 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce to reduce the oiliness. 
The crumb topping is good. I think it made too much as I only used half of it, and I used an additional tablespoon of butter so that it would hold a crumb texture.
My friend Dave said that he likes it with mini chocolate chips, so I added that to my loaves as well. 
I also toasted the walnuts before adding them to the batter.

this was really good!  I used a tiny bit less sugar, halved the oil and subbed with applesauce, and threw in a little extra zucchini.  it wasn't super super moist because of the applesauce, but i thought it was better that way because my fingers weren't greasy!

I never thought I would like zucchini bread but this recipe is fabulous~ especially with the streusel topping that so many have recommended.  I'm a vegan so I replaced the eggs with Ener-G egg replacer (available at health food stores) and to add fiber, I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  And because I wasn't paying attention, I totally forgot to add the baking powder (so if you don't have any in your cabinet-- no worries! I just had to cook it a little longer).  The bread is super moist--everyone absolutely loved it.  I'm going to make a second batch for sure.  Even if you're not a vegan, the vegan modifications are a good idea because they make the recipe cholesterol free.

A friend of mine gave me about 6 giant zucchinis. I used this recipe, and just tasted the first batch. PERFECT! It is wonderful! Thank you! I used the crumb topping suggested by others...but I couldn't get it very "crummy" so I just sprinkeled about half of it on top of the  bread before baking it. It's so good. I'll be making more tomorrow and giving them away to my favorite customers. Within a week, this recipe will be in 1/2 the kitchens in my town. Thank you for helping me introduce Zucchini Bread to the town of Breaux Bridge, Louisiana.

This was really great.  To make them healthier, I used 2 cups of whole wheat flour and one cup of white flour, replaced half of the oil with applesauce, and replaced half of the sugar with splenda.  then I baked them in cupcake tins.  My kids think they are cupcakes and beg for seconds on "dessert."  Thank you so much for helping my kids to eat zucchini!

Loved this recipe. My 8 year old did as well. Made a few changes to the recipe but it still came out wonderful. I used 1/2 applesauce 1/ oil, brown sugar instead of white sugar, 1/2 wheat flour & 1/2 white flour added ground ginger and ground nutmeg and raisins. Came out wonderful. Yumm

yum! I did omit the walnuts, and I did the 1/2 applesauce 1/2 veg. oil. I actually only made 1/2 the amount due to only having one cup of zucchini. Good stuff!

it was great! i used 50/50 oil-applesauce and 50/50 allpurpose-stoneground wheat flour. didn't have loaf pans but it baked quickly and perfectly in 8in round pans in about 45 min. i don't like walnuts so i used pistachios. i might use a bit less sugar, it's a bit sweet but the moistness and texture is wonderful!

Not a big walnut fan, so I omit those.  I have been making this bread for several years now and I always look forward to it.  I have tried variations to make it more healthy by adding milled flaxseed and removing some of the oil.  Always turns out great!

This was a very good base recipe. I say base becuase I tweaked a couple of things.
As some other member said, I used 1/2 the oil and added crushed pineapple. I also used 1 and 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of honey. and instead of all 3 cups of white flour, I used 2 cups all purpose and 1 cup whole wheat!
I also added raisins, and added the topping suggested by another member. It turned out great. I'm going to take a loaf into the office tomorrow and see what the verdict from them is!

Used all of the suggestions here, and my loaf turned out fantastico!!! This is a very heavy bread, but a terrific bread, I thought.
The hardest part is grating those stupid zucchinis. What a mess!

This recipe is DEVINE!  I substituted 1/2 c. crushed pineapple for half of the oil (because I didn't have applesauce) and it was fabulous!  I'll make it this way every time.  Also, I made the topping, but would suggest using way less flour, and I covered the loaves during most of the cooking time to prevent over-browning.  Thanks for the tips, they worked out wonderfully.

I make this all the time! I also turn this into an Apple Bread recipe by using 2 cups grated apple instead of zucchini, and adding a bit of nutmeg. You can spread cream cheese frosting on the top.

I liked this recipe, but I had to make a few changes, either out of necessity or my quest to make this a healthier snack:
I only own one loaf pan so I made it in a 13*9 pan.  Also, 2 c sugar seemed like a lot, so I only used 1 c with about 1/4c honey.  And, like others, I used 3/4 c unsweetened applesauce with 1/4 cup oil, as well as 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Turned out great and moist, and not too sweet!  

Oh, and big change: I didn't have zucchini, but I had a half of a spaghetti squash left over from dinner a few nights ago and used that- still turned out very tasty.  Will definitly make again seeing as this is a versatile recipe.

Wow!  I agree - it's fantastic.  I substituted 1 cup of the white flour for whole wheat flour and added the above 1 cup extra zucchini and probably  2/3 tsp nutmeg, and slightly more baking soda and baking powder (to prevent the bread from being too heavy because of the tendency for whole wheat flour to make recipes heavy).  You have to like whole wheat flour but if you've lived on whole wheat - you know no different.

I'm giving this 3 stars because the flavor was good.  However it was dry and not a dense as I prefer.  I'll keep looking for a recipe that produces the type of zucchini bread we like.  Thanks for the recipe.  The flavor was good!

This was a great zucchini bread! I even substituted the sugar for Splenda and it came out fantastic. This is a  very moist bread. This recipe is now a permanent fixture in our household.

VERY good recipe for Zucchini Bread.  The wonderful smells while it baked enticed my 12-y.o. son to actually taste it!  He said, "I don't like zucchini, but I like zucchini bread."

This was delicious. I omitted the nuts (only because I didn't have them) and cooked for less time (between 50-60 minutes). These came out moist and perfect.

Excellent! This is an easy goof proof recipe... and I too used 1/2 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce and it's the best.  HA! I can't wait to bring the second loaf to the office on Monday.... and I'll eat the other one!

This is the first time that I have made a Zucchini Bread and it was absolutely DELICIOUS!  I also added the crunchy crust that was listed in another review and it was awesome. The two loaves that I made were gone very quickly!  I would definitely recommend this recipe.  Its a keeper!!  :)

This is the best zucchini bread recipe I have ever used.  Used 3 cups of zucchini instead of 2.  Also extra cinnamon (but I am a cinnamon girl). Very moist, it was gone in no time.

Very good bread.  I did modify by 1/2 oil & 1/2 cinnamon applesauce,and added nutmeg, but otherwise no changes.  My 6 year old, who doesn't like zucchini, really enjoyed and even wanted 2nds!  Thanks!

I grated about 1/4 c. of the zuchini skin and set aside.  Then boiled the zuchini in water, drained it, and measured out 2 cups.  This I used instead of the grated raw zuchini,  It turned out moist and wonderful.  Thanks.
Next time I will try the topping.  Donnajean

This is the first time I ever made zucchini bread. I had to try it due to the overflow of squash in my garden! All I can say is WOW. Best zucchini bread I ever tried. My kids had never tried it before and said "ew - zucchini?" but then they took a bite and LOVED it. Both loaves were gone in one day!

I made the two loaves using chocolate chips in place of the walnuts.  I also followed the tip on the crumb topping from Patrincia and it was a perfect blend of moistness and crunchy.  My husband and 3 boys polished off the first loaf within an hour that I had to freeze the other loaf. I just used the other loaf three weeks later and the topping lost its crunchiness, but the ladies I work for loved it and asked for the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I agree with the reviewer who said it was "generically sweet".  I think it might be improved using some brown sugar like others have done and adding some different spices.

This was very good!  I just baked it for about 60 minutes so it was very moist in the middle and had a little bit of a crunchy top.  I have more zucchini frozen so I can make more loaves.  Very good recipe!

Very good recipe!  I made mine with half whole wheat flour, half white, and added a little wheat germ.  Also, per other reviews I added a lot of extra zucchini...very yummy!!!

Made this zucchini bread last night.  My boyfriend brought the loaf to work and got rave reviews about the moistness and the flavor.  I did not add the nuts and probably put about 3 cups of zucchini in the recipe.  Other than that, there was no other change made to the recipe.  I also put part of it in a loaf pan and the rest in a bundt as I did not have two loaf pans.  It came out great in the bundt pan.  The edges got a bit crispy which my boyfriend like but the middle is nice and moist.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I thought this was good, but not amazing.  The loaf wasn't that pretty, but the muffins looked nice.  One recipe made 1 loaf, 8 regular heart shaped muffins and 11 mini muffins.  I prefer spicier zucchini bread though.  I only used 1 cup sugar and that was plenty!

Great Recipe!  This recipe was relatively easy to make and bake and tastes exceptional!  I cut up half serving size pieces and froze them for smaller calorie snacks and let my family loose on the rest of the loaf.  I know it will be gone by the end of the day.

EXCELLENT!!  I kept the skin on the zucchini to keep the nostalgic feel, like my mom always made it :)  also, i did the half apple sauce and half oil, and half white and half brown sugar. One batch i added 2 cups of blueberries, and one batch i added two cups of pineapple, this got WONDERFUL feedback from friends and family, this is my newest "keeper" recipe!

I made this bread twice, the first time completely substituting 1 c of applesauce for the 1 c of oil, and the second time following the recipe exactly except for leaving out the walnuts. Both times the bread tasted great, however the loaves I made with applesauce turned out very chewy. I don't like that texture for quick breads, so I might suggest only substituting 1/2 c of applesauce for the oil if you want a lower fat bread.

I'm not always a big fan of zucchini bread, but this is really a very good recipe (espcially for using up all that extra zucchini from the garden!)  I used 2 t. of cinnamon and 1 t. of pumpkin pie spice for a little extra flavor and it was great.  Spicy and delicious!

Wow - I have no idea why this bread tastes this great, but this is truly the best loaf of bread I have ever made!! I made one large loaf and cooked it a little longer, and it came out completely moist with the right amount of denseness. Truly a winner recipe! Thanks Kristen for this submission.

This was GREAT bread. Easy to follow directions. Even when my husband (accidently) turned off the oven halfway through and I had to re-cook it another 25 minutes, it still turned out great. You can 't mess it up.

DeLiCIouS!
I added two teaspoons of sour cream, just because it was sitting in the fridge and I didn't have any nuts at the time.  I topped one of them with heated honey and I sprinkled the other with confectioner's sugar.  
My husband loved it so much that I probably will make it again!

This was just what I was looking for to use up some zucchini.  It was SO moist, sweet, and perfect.  The kids are getting up now...here comes the real test! ;-D  (Oh, and I tripled the recipe...I had a lot of zucchini...but only used 4 loaf pans...and it was fabulous)

Similar to other reviewers I'm used to something a little more moist but still good.  I might cut down on the sugar next time (not because i don't like sweet--just a lot of calories) and use applesauce in its place.

This recipe was easy to make and delicious.  I decided to try it with more of a wheat base, so I used 2 cups whole wheat flour and one cup of all-purpose flour.  It came out very well and I will definitely make this again.  I served it to a group of moms and their children and they all loved it too. Here's a link to my write up of it on my food blog called "At Our Table":  http://atourtable.blogspot.com/2004/10/whole-wheat-zucchini-bread.html

Wonderful recipe - my four-year-old son and I love making it together.  Makes a large amount of bread for not much effort with ingredients you're likely to have on hand.

I would recommend checking for doneness before the 60 minute mark, as I nearly burned the loaves my first time making them.

Great! I made this as muffins for a potluck, and they went over very well. I also made a half batch of these (i used 2 medium eggs) using a gluten-free flour mixture for my daughter, who has celiac disease. I added 2 tsp. of xanthan gum and they were great- she loves them.

This bread is phenomenal! My young children and husband have been devouring it! We voted, and ended up leaving the nuts out, but kept the rest of the recipe the same. This would make a perfect holiday gift for a neighbor, or a special treat to take to a gathering. It is moist on the inside with a nicely browned crust on the outside, and just the right height for a sweet bread. Try baking it in mini-loaf pans and freezing for future snacking! Superb! This is a keeper!

I halfed this recipe because I only had 1 loaf pan, man was i wishing i had just run to the store and bought another pan. this recipe is excellent! Like others I added about half a cup more zucchini then called for, and since it is hard to half 3 eggs I just put in 2, i also added nutmeg and used cinnamon apple sauce instead of oil. Unlike what other people said the bread was not too dense for me, I think the key may be whipping the eggs to the right texture. This wonderful recipe made the house smell like the holidays I couldn't wait for it to be done baking!

This bread tasted great!  My loaf, however, came out very dense.  I'm not sure if it was something that I did or that's how it's suppose to be.  Regardless, the flavor was terrific.

This was good, however, I tried to cut out too much sugar....I should have added more.  I did add some milk chocolate chips to one loaf.

This was an excellent bread - just what I was looking for to use my bounty of zucchini in.  I halved the cinnamon and added a teaspoon and a half of allspice to replace it. My family and I really liked the results.

This was my first attempt at making zucchini bread. It seemed a tad on the dry side for me. Maybe it will be moister tomorrow?! I also prefer a denser bread, and I agree with an earlier post- it lacks something. (Another spice maybe?) My husband likes it and I will feed it to my 2 toddlers tomorrow.

Very good! I changed the walnuts to pecans, and added chocolate chips. It's nice that it makes two loaves, one for my family and one for a friend. I like the cinnamon spice, and it was a yummy Fall bread to use some of our zucchini.

Apparently when you drain the zucchini you are stripping the bread of its moisture. The crumb topping mentioned by others needs more butter and less flour or it is basically a sugar/flour topping, and it makes waaaaay too much of it! I threw away 1/2-3/4 of the topping because there’d be no way to cut the bread with that much sugary topping. I’ll keep looking for a better recipe. Don’t mean to sound like a hater!

This is a good, basic zucchini bread.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added an extra cup of zucchini.  I baked them in mini-bread loaf pans to store the extra little loaves in the freezer for later.

Followed others suggestions to increase zucchini, add nutmeg and always substitute 1/2 oil for applesauce. Zucchini grows like a weed in my garden, so I shred and freeze in 3 cup pkgs. When it's time to refresh my stash of mini frozen baked loaves, I thaw zucchini and bake more. Always rave compliments, even from zucchini-haters.

I have one other trick I have use for years.  Instead of flouring the pans I spray them with Pam and cost with a mixture of cinnamon/sugar.  I also put the cinnamon/sugar on top of the loaves before baking.  The sugar and cinnamon crystallize so the bread is sweet and a little crunchy.

I made as directed, but substituted artificial sweetener to cut calories. I also cut the oil in 1/2 and used applesauce. Thinking this would make  a moister bread. It is good. I am very glad I cut the sugar in 1/2. It was just the right sweetness. But it is a little dry. Next time I will substitute brown sugar for the white sugar. Otherwise a good basic recipe.

One of the most moist zucchini breads I’ve ever made. As always, I read reviews and took a couple suggestions. I used 3 cups zucchini (slightly packed), otherwise I would have had to pitch the leftover cup. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup packed dark brown. I didn’t add nuts but did add mini chocolate chips to half my batter. YUM!  Next time I plan to use unsweetened applesauce for half the oil called for.

This is my let’s get it done, when you have a garden full of zucchini.   The zucchini bread freezes great, and all the Nieghbor wait for there loaf.   Today I made five cakes three small and two big.   Change nothing,  but maybe more zucchini, nut, and raisin if you like.  It’s moist every time.

My 12 year old son John Paul Johnsen made this but used 1.5 cup of sugar and added 0.5 cup mayo and 1med banana and it was SUPER moist . He was super proud.  Great recipe. We used real butter on  the baking pan giving the bread a delicious buttery flavor.  YUM YUM!!

Loved it.  I used 1/2 the oil and added some vanilla Greek yogurt in its place.  I will make this again!  Very yummy!

I made this recipe gluten free by simply replacing the flour with a gluten free flour. I've found it works better to half the recipe when making it gluten free. I also added 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.

I've made this recipe many times and everyone loves it! The only thing I want to say is that the 15 minute prep time-unless you have people in your kitchen prepping for you, you better add another 30 minutes or so! I don't have a food processor to grate my zucchini and tried the blender on grate-keeps getting hung up and I've tried my chopper. I do just as well with a hand grater, but it takes time! Also I use a hand mixer to blend everything together. At any rate, I give it a five because everyone loves it so I'll keep making it.

This was great. I  don't think it needs as much sugar since I used 1 1/2 cups rather than 2 and it was really good. Also I was almost out of vanilla so only had
maybe 1/2 tsp, and only had pecans.  This recipe is very forgiving!  I recommend you try it, you won't be disappointed !

I consider myself to be a good baker, but this turned out very dense and dry. Maybe I did something wrong, but I can't think of anything. The cooks illustrated recipe is way better.

This is a great recipe for classic zucchini bread. The only change I made was using 1/2 applesauce, and 1/2 oil. It was still very moist and delicious. I think the amount of sugar is perfect.

This was a good recipe, but not a great recipe. I am used to my mom's zucchini bread which is decadently moist and delicious. This recipe (which I made exactly as written) is a bit on the dry for my taste.

Wonderful recipe!  Decided to make this 100% diet friendly so swapped out the flour for Carbquick, the sugar for half Splenda and half Erythritol and baked it about 20 minutes longer.  I also made the crunchy topping another reviewer suggested and swapped out the brown sugar for Brown Sugar Twin substitute.  This turned out fabulous!  No one was able to tell it was diet friendly and it made a wonderful light cinnamon, nicely textured bread.  Definitely a keeper!

I absolutely love this recipe... I've even taken this and altered it for a similar banana bread.  I have grated AND used a food processor for the zucchini, I don't dry it at all and I get a wonderfully moist CAKE.  I make this recipe about once a month: I can get three cakes out of it and unfortunately for me, it doesn't last more than 2 days.

I liked it, with changes.  I used a half cup of olive oil and added an extra cup of chocolate chips.  I changed one cup of sugar from white to brown. Because everyone warned about how much extra water the zucchini provided, instead of blotting it I instead cut the oil in half and used all the water from the zucchini.  The bread took a good hour and a half to cook at 335, but it came out delicious. No one noticed the lack of oil, or that I used olive.

It tastes nothing like Zucchini bread.  Do not cook for the whole time or your bread will end up dry.

Just made this recipe with my niece and nephew and they LOVED it. I strained the water out of my grated zuchinni and substituted the nuts for chocolate chips and they couldn't get enough! I used 3 non stick loaf pans instead of 2. Cut cook time to about 50 min.

My  rating was based on the taste of just the batter!  It's in the oven and smells great.  I had a humongous zucchini given to us and had to use it quick.  I love all the cinnamon.  Hope it will "neutralize" the sugar a bit.  Also used coconut oil.

I'm one of those people that always swap out a few ingredients to make recipes healthier.  With that being said, this was a great base recipe for me.  I made the following changes and it turned out delicious!  I used 1/2 cup melted coconut oil and 1/2 cup applesauce for the oil.  I used half whole wheat pastry flour and half spelt flour for the flour.  I used unrefined coconut sugar for all the sugar.  And I didn't use any nuts because of the kiddos!  I did use the topping with 1/2 c. flour, 1/2 c. coconut sugar and 2 tsp cinnamon.  Baking time 50 minutes. The result was delicious and moist!!

I love this recipe!  I follow the recipe to the letter and it is fabulous!! It turns out moist and oh so yummy every single time.  I realize other cooks change it up and substitute applesauce for the oil, but honestly, my family prefers it as it is written.

I would like to make muffins with this wonderful recipe, but they fall flat every time.  Any suggestions on how to change the recipe to make muffins (other than time--I did 25 minutes)?

Amazing! I followed the recipe except for one change,  didn't add the walnuts.  I may or may not use nuts the next time but either way, I WILL make this again.  Taking a loaf over to my mom's to share Mother's Day.

This is a great recipe.  I cut the oil in half, by adding 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also substitute 1 scant cup of chocolate chips for the 1/2 cup of nuts.  People love this loaf, and almost always comment on the combination of cinnamon and chocolate. Thank you Kristen's mother for sharing this recipe!

This was excellent!  I did as most of the reviews suggested - I added the crumb topping and used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.  I also used 1 c. White sugar and 1 c brown sugar (I'd run out of the white!) and it came out great!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I followed some of the options given, add apple sause and cut the oil in half, add nutmeg etc.  I shredded the zucchini but then assumed my kids may not like the texture so I put it as well as the other ingredients into my food processer and mixed it all that way so at the end, the zucchini was not noticable.  My two loaves were all gone in 2 days and more requests were put in!

I added the crumb topping as did other reviewers, and that was the only source of flavor. Despite adding 1 1/2 cups extra zucchini,  the bread had zero zucchini flavor. Additionally, this was not as moist as I prefer my breads to be. 
It's not to say this bread is terrible, it was dense and sugary-sweet, but I don't bake zucchini bread not to taste the star ingredient, and the topping that "made" the bread is not even part of the original recipe.

My fam loves this recipe.  I have shared it with all my friends.  I substitute half the flour for whole wheat flour.  Other than that, I don't change a thing and it comes out perfect every time.  Not too oily, or bland!  Thank you!!!!

I loved this bread! It was so moist and delicious!! Yumm yumm!! I used applesauce instead of vegetable oil and also added about a handful of sweetened coconut and some coarsely chopped almonds into the mix as well. It turned out great and instantly became a family favorite!

My family loves this zuchini bread! I did some changes and it turned out pretty good. I added 1 cup of shreded carrots with 1 cup of zuchini. Instead of using 2 cups of white sugar I used only one cup of brown sugar and instead of the nwhole 1 cup of oil I mashed peaches with apple sauce ( about 1 cup) and added almos 1/4 cup of oil. I baked it for an hour at 325C. It was delicious

This is the best zucchini bread I have ever had. I gave a loaf to my daughter and my son-in-law never had any because she and the kids devoured it before he could get any. I omitted the walnuts. My grandson is allergic to nuts. Thanks for the recipe!

I used the ideas other reviewers had suggested...an extra cup of zuchhini and crumble topping.  Considering how much zuchhini I have from my garden I will definitely be making this again and again.

Turned out well... followed the suggestion of adding another cup of zucchini and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. Add more zing and more zucchini flavor.

AWESOME recipe!  I added semi-sweet chocolate chips (6 oz for 24 servings) and it turned out great!  Am going to add lemon-balm chopped leaves from my garden this time to see how it turns out.  So easy to  make!

I made this zucchini bread to use up the zucchinis from our garden and it was excellent! Sweet, spicy and delicious - I'll definitely be making this again.

I replaced half the oil with unsweetened applesauce, mostly peeled the zucchini so picky eaters in the house wouldn't see the green, and I used my "Cheasy" cheese grater I keep for parmesan to grate up the walnuts. I made the crumble topping but will make less next time. Right now I have enough of that left over to make a couple coffee cakes! This bread is fabulous. My picky daughters keep doing happy dances while eating it!

This is a great recipe as is, but I made a few changes to it since I am the only one eating it and I wanted a healthy daily snack. So, I replaced the oil with 1 1/2 cups unsweetened apple sauce, replaced the 2 cups of white sugar with 1 cup dark brown sugar, added 1 cup raisins and 1 tsp ground cloves. I also substituted the white flour for whole wheat flour. The result was surprisingly tasty! I baked them in 2 metal loaf pans for 60 minutes.

This turned out phenomenal! I made little baby loafs and I took the advice of others and added the crispy topping and one of my friends told me "...dont ever bring that over here again, I just inhaled the whole thing!"  and my boyfriend claimed one and wouldn't share w/ anyone else haha  Will totally be making this again!

This bread has a wonderful flavor and I wouldn't change much; it's nearly perfect.  I've made it exactly as directed twice and it it could have been just a tad more moist.  Just a smidge.  I'm going to try adding just a bit more oil, maybe a few Tablespoons and see if that helps.

FANTASTIC!  I did the applesauce/oil trick like many did and lessened the sugar a little.  I happened to have 1 cup of pumkin puree left over from some pumpkin bread that I made and I mixed that in as well.  It was the perfect amount of pumkin to still have the bread be considered "zucchini" bread.

Good basic recipe. I did half the oil and did the other half with apple sauce. It kept the bread super moist. I also added extra zucchini and for loaf #2 I added some chocolate chips for fun....sooo yummy!

Fantastic! I made it with 2 cups of spelt flour and 1 cup of white, and the crumbly topping someone suggested. I recommend halving the topping mix (1/2 cup brown sugar etc) because I have some leftover. Gee, I'll just have to make more bread!

This was an amazing recipe, just like my Grandma use to make, I was searching high and low for her recipe and could not, so I came here and found this one, I just added 2 tsp of Black Walnut Flavoring (like Grandma use to make) and my Dad did'nt know the difference. Thanks for an amazing recipe!!!!!

This recipe was dynamite and so easy!  I made it as written, substituting the 1/2 cup applesauce as other suggested, I did add the crumb topping as suggested and it came out perfect.  Made one loaf with nuts and the other without.  Rave reviews from family and co-workers.  And it was the first time I had ever made zucchini bread - no need to look any further.  Thanks so much!

Whew! Made lots of changes...summer squash instead of zucchini, 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 AP flour, 3 TB ground flax seed, heaping 1/2 tsp each ginger, nutmeg, and cloves (I wanted more of a spice bread) and omitted nuts. Oh and a cream cheese glaze. Very good!!

I'm sure the original recipe is delicious but I liked adding the suggestions of other reviewers. With the following suggestions, it made it from home made bread to something I would expect to get at a nice bakery: I added the 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and an extra cup of zucchini and replaced half the apple sauce with oil. I also added the "crunchy crust" recipe. I also used King Aurther white whole wheat flour. IT WAS AMAZING! The men in my house had no idea that it wasn't as bad for them as they thought :o)

This came out delicious, but I made a few adjustments.  First of all, it does not need a whole cup of oil, I only used 1/2 a cup.  Instead of 2 cups of white sugar, I used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown.  I increased the cinnamon to 2 tablespoons, but thats only because I love cinnamon.  It came out nice and moist, and it was probably healthier without all that oil.  Thanks for the great recipe!(:

Simple recipe and it turned out great.  Next time I think I will follow other reviews that suggested adding more zucchini, but even without that it's still a keeper in the recipe book! Thanks!

Very moist and delicious. So easy to make, and my 2-year old girl loved it--I think she ate half a pan by herself!

I'd never had (or made) this before, but I was presented with a 10 lb. zucchini....it made this bread and several other dishes. I had good reviews from my boyfriend. I took a loaf and a half to work and it disappeared pretty quickly. Nice texture and flavors.

I made this bread last week and my husband and 14 year old son LOVED it. I am making it again today. Next time I think I'll try some of the suggestions I've read in other reviews.

This was my first time making zucchini bread and it was just perfect! My whole family just ate it up and asked that I make more. I did add 1 cup of walnuts instead of the 1/2 because I wanted a nuttier bread.

This was an awesome Zucchini Bread. I made this two ways first exactly by the original recipe and them I add an 8oz can of crushed pineapple drained. Both ways were just as delicious.

I've made this several times now with only minor changes and it always turns out great.  I double the zucchini as I've got tons of it from my garden, and increase the flour by 1/2 cup to compensate for this.  I use a mix of brown sugar and honey in place of the white sugar, and a mix of whole wheat and white flour.  It takes 70-80 minutes in my oven, but at 325 degrees, I've never had trouble with the loaves burning.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made the recipe as written, except I added a tablespoon of cocoa. I turned out moist and is one of the best zucchini bread recipes I have ever baked. I received several compliments on this bread.

Made this bread using 2 cups of wheat flour and 1 cup of white.  I also used all dark brown sugar.  Added cup of raisins and no nuts.  Good, safe recipe.

I love this recipe. It was easy, fun and delicious. I made it for my roomates and they loved it! I have never made bread like this before and because of this I will not stop cooking this. I of course added a few ingredients and used a 1/4 cup of brown sugar in exchange for a 1/4 cup of white sugar! Absolutely delicious!!!!!

Great.  I used the applesauce oil combo and topped with the struesel.  My husband said, "This ought to be a sin."  I'm going to try it now with white wheat flour, bananas for the eggs, applesauce for the oil and see what kind of results I get.  Thanks for the recipe.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  I did sub Splenda for sugar, applesauce for oil and 1/2 the flour with whole wheat.  Maybe that is why it turned out so dense.

I've had this recipe for years, before joining this website. And i've almost always added 1 cup chocolate chips to the bread, which makes it even more tasty.

Mmmmmmm. I didn't think any recipe for Zucchini bread was better than my Mom's..... but this recipe is the BEST EVER! I also used 1/2 c. applesauce. Used 1/2 organic whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 regular flour. Added  flax seeds and  a crumb topping. The sweet crumb topping really add a nice touch.

I made this zucchini bread the first time with MaryKlaire's topping, and it was a big hit with my family and neighbors. Making it again, because I have a bumper crop of zucchini this year in my garden.  Thank you

This is my mother-in-law's recipe and the BEST!!  So moist and yummy.  We have zucchini coming out of our ears and I'm doing my best to keep up freezing loaves to last us beyond summer.  The problem is they keep eating it!!!

Thank you for posting this recipe, I really found it easy and soooo tasty! It came out perfectly! It was moist and even my 2 1/2 yr old daughter liked it, which is rare these days considering that she doesn't like anything except pasta and chicken nuggets!!  I will be using this again and passing it on to my family!

I subbed 1/2 c unsweetened applesauce for half of the oil, used half white and half brown sugar, and added a crumb topping as suggested by a previous reviewer. It was amazing. Also, I even messed up the first batch because I had been using a 3/4 c measuring cup thinking it was the 1 c when I measured out the flour...but though it required a slightly longer baking time (and came out a bit wetter and eggier), it was still fantastic.

This is the first time I have ever made zucchini bread but it won't be the last time.  I made this recipe exactly as instructed and my family thought it was wonderful.  Very easy to assemble with ingredients that are standard in most kitchens.

i substituted applesauce for the oil and lemon extract for the vanilla extract.  it was a good dense bread with good flavor.  i'd make it again, but i'm still on the hunt for the ultimate zucchini bread recipe.

i used this recipe for my first try at zucchini bread and it was great!! the only thing i did different is that i added more cinnmon...it made enough to share with co-workers and they all really enjoyed it. next time i'll try swapping out the oil for some apple sauce...but for the first go, i had to make the real thing. LOVED IT!

This was a great, easy recipe. I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and the sugar to 1.5 cups. The outside had a nice crust and the inside was very moist. I would definitely make it again.

this is my go to zucchini bread recipe, but i am only giving it 4 stars because i actually have to double the zucchini.  otherwise everything is great.  i also put brown sugar instead b/c it tastes better and a touch of nutmeg too! :)

Excellent. Made additions per others recommendations - nutmeg, applesauce and extra zucchini. Also added the topping mix. Made additional change - added chocolate chips to last batch (of double batch) and used less of the topping mix... tastes even better!

I have to admitt this is one of the BEST recipes for zucchini bread I have come across.I made a loaf for myself and when it came out of the oven of coarse I had to try it all I can say is yummy.As others I have had a zucchini bread recipe that I have used for year it has now been replaced. I also added 1/2 applesauce to try to cut calories a little and I also added a handfull of coconut and that just added to  it. I suggest that everyone try this you won't regret it. Candy

Very good recipe. I used half apple sauce/half oil at the recommendation of others. I added the crumble topping, but think I will skip that next time. Overall, very good bread. It smelled heavenly while it was baking, and drew my roommates out of their rooms into the kitchen.

This recipe is fantastic. I had to use my resourcefulness to get it made. I was stuck with using self rising flour...and you know this does not change the taste however it does make quite a bit more and fall off into the oven. Terrific, thanks and big cu-dos.

My fiance says it's Better Than His Mom Makes!  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and did add the topping (cut in 1/2 as well) and came out DELICIOUS!  Only took about 45 minutes to bake in a toaster oven.  So yummy, this is a new favorite.

I used 1 cup applesauce instead of the 1 cup oil, also I followed the recommendations for the crumb topping, added the nutmeg, and also the 1 cup raisins as suggested by other reviews. FabulouS! I do want to add that it tasted so much moister after it cooled. At first I thought, well its ok, but my oven must have dreid it a little until I had a piece later that day after keeping it covered then I said, wow this is it!!

this is a great recipe. I used an extra cup of zucchini and added chocolate chips. I cant keep it in the house. I must of made at least 21 loafs this summer and I got rave reviews.

great bread, one which received lots of compliments.  followed recipe exactly, no high altitude adjustments.  wrapped in foil after cooling which makes the bread even better the next day.

Started with the basic recipe and added a banana (only had one on hand) and 1/2 cup semisweet choc chips.  Very moist, and great flavor.  Added the streusel topping as others suggested. Will be making this again.

Loved this recipe! Kept one loaf for us and gave the other to a friend and they loved it too. The only thing I did different was I added a teaspoon of nutmeg. It was just perfect and yummy.

Easy to make, bake and eat! I am not an experienced cook but I made this bread for the first time and gave a loaf to my parents. My Dad called this the best zucchini bread he had ever eaten! I would recommend this to everyone I know and have!

I made this and though very good, the taste reminded me of carrot cake, which I love.  I  made cream cheese frosting from a recipe on this site and it was wonderful!  Now I know what to do with my bumper crop of zucchini.

I have made this 2 times, and both times I have ate so much my belly hurts. Many friends/family beg me to make more and more. Infact, tomorrow I'll have to make another loaf. Thanks for this recipe, it's awesome!

Yummy!  I followed the recipe as stated and then made revisions the second time around according to other reviewers.  The revisions was delish- more zucchini, applesauce, crumbs, etc. I gave them to my nieces and nephews and they loved it!

I don't know yet if I'll make this one again.  I followed the recipe for the most part, but did sub half the oil for applesauce, and added more zucchini.  It cooked for a very long time, and still wound up not being completely cooked through, which was a huge disappointment!
Taste is great, though, so I may try again.

This bread is absolutely delicious!  I love the cinnamon.  I grow patie-pan squash and made some loaves with the substituted squash.  It made and a wonderful, mild loaf -- and a great use for my squash!  I call them patty-cakes!

Good bread. I made as written except omitted the nuts and sprinkles a few choco chips on top. My kids will eat anything with chocolate chips. Yummy. We have lots more zucchini's so I'm guessing we'll make it again.

I've had better. I followed the suggestion of adding a cup of zucchini and the topping. The bread took much longer to cook through and the topping suggested made WAY too much. Won't make again.

First time ever making zucchini bread. Great recipe. I made muffins, wrapped them individually and froze them. Husband who won't eat zucchini loved them. When I told him what was in them, he still loves them! Thanks!

I have never made zucchini bread in my life!  I had a few zucchinis and my mother told me to make a zucchini bread with them.  At first I thought I would not like it at all.  Then I looked up the recipe on a few sites and settled with this one.  As the ingredients started coming together I started to think this was going to be too much sugar and be too sweet.  After it came out of the oven it didn't sit very long before we cut into the first of two loaves and just three adults and 2 kids later there was three quarters of ONE loaf left!  It is SO tasty!!  It reminds me so much of carrot cake just shredded zucchini instead of carrots.  I will definitely make this recipe again...tomorrow!!

Sorry, but this was not a very good recipe for me. It tasted like cinnamon and sugar baked bread. I used 1/2 of the sugar called for and used mostly brown sugar. My husband and his co-workers loved it. But I will not make it again.

Excellent. I used 3 cups of zucchini and substituted pecans. I also used 2t of cinnamon and 1t of nutmeg. I made two batches and gave my neighbors each a loaf. They also loved it and asked for the recipe.

I have made this twice now and it is really good!  I doubled the amount of zucchini and used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour.  Most of my family doesn't like nuts so I left them out.  Next time I make it I am going to try replacing 1/2 the oil with apple sauce and decreasing the sugar a bit.

This recipe is sooo good! I love how the top gets almost like a sugary crunchiness to it! I put a bit extra zuchinni in it too, and it made it really moist and yummy!

I did my own variation of the crispy crust addition mentioned in the first review and used raisins instead of nuts because of allergies in the family, but this turned out terrific and is a "keeper." High yeild and wonderful flavor! A real winner.

I thought this is a great recipe only i didn't put the walnuts in it because can't chew them. My grand-daughters went nuts about this and want me to make more.

This was the first time I've made zucchini bread and I must say this was delicious. I made the crust as someone suggested minus the walnuts because I didn't have any available but it was still pretty good.

I have never made/had Zucchini bread before but made it for my boyfriend who loves it.  I thought this was a great, moist bread.  I made a few changes ...  I used WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR, 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 Smart Balance Oil, Egg Beaters instead of the 3 eggs, and Splenda mix (has sugar) that is made for baking.  I also added an extra cup of Zucchini and the nutmeg, as well as some dark chocholate chips.

Lots of possibilities with this!  Great recipe overall. The first batch I made I added chocolate chips and used 1/2 cup pear applesauce & 1/2 cup oil.  Turned out great! Second batch I used 3/4 cup Eggbeaters instead of eggs, 1/2 cup regular applesauce and 1/2 cup oil.  Added 1 cup raisins that had been dusted with flour to prevent them sinking.  These 2 loaves turned out fabulous.  Wrap the loaves in foil when slightly warm and the will be super moist the next day!

I THINK THERE ARE SOME COOKS THAT ARE TRYING TO FIT THIS WHOLE RECIPE IN ONE LOAF PAN.  I HAVEN'T TRIED IT YET, BUT I USE A RECIPE THAT'S VERY SIMILAR.  WAS SHOCKED THE FIRST TIME WITH THE AMOUNT OF BATTER...TILL I READ THAT I NEEDED TWO PANS!

Followed the recipe pretty much right on.  I added extra zucchini (maybe 3/4 cup more) and sprinkled pan with sugar instead of flour because I was out.  The bread is sooo moist and yummy.  Even my reluctant 4 year old is asking for more.  :)

I enjoyed this recipe.  It was the first time I had made zucchini bread.  I didn't have enough white flour, so I used 2 cups white flour and 1 cup wheat flour.  I also added pumpkin pie spice mix to it.  It turned out great!  My family gobbled it all up.

I will try some of the other substs...like the applesauce and walnut topping soon!

I have given this recipe two stars because we found it to be quite tasteless.  I followed the recipe, except I used applesauce in place of oil.  My husband wouldn't even take a loaf to school to share because he said I have a reputation to uphold.  This was a disapointment.  Sorry.

the first loaf i made turned out to be more cake like than bread like and a little on the sweet side, however since i didnt have 2 loaf pans i put the 2nd half of dough in the fridge for a day and when i baked it it turned out great and much like a bread- its a great recipe but next time i might tweak the ingredients a bit

Well, I had to make some unexpected changes to this recipe and it still turned out good.  I followed the suggestion to use half apple sauce and half oil (I had cinnamon apple sauce in the house - yummy) but when it came to the sugar, I only had 1/2 c of white sugar, so I used light brown sugar for the rest and it actually was pretty good.  It took a lot less time to bake than the recipe said (45 minutes only) yet it came out moist and flavorful.  Oh, and I used pumpkin pie spice for half the cinnamon and the other half was just cinnamon.

I love zucchini bread, I always lose my recipe, but seem to find it somewhere on the internet.  I love using walnuts, but also try other things like chocolate chips and caramel bits, etc.

My family and I loved this. I left out the nuts cause I didn't have any. I also scaled the recipe down to make one loaf and had my bread machine do all the work. Excellent bread. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the very first zucchini bread I have ever made and will be the last!  This is wonderful and moist!  Extremely easy to make and my family loved it. I didn't have walnuts for this recipe, so I substituted pecans which tasted wonderful.  I also have a family member that doesn't like nuts, so half the batter I put nuts in, the other was plain and both tasted great!

Just like my mom's Zucchini Bread, except she uses 1/2 tsp. baking powder instead of 1/4 and adds 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  Great classic recipe!

Made this for work, but can't eat it (celiac disease). Smells good, looks ok. Mine didn't rise well and it is dense and I can't figure out why.
All I changed was adding an additional tsp of cinnamon and I used 1 1/2 cups of sugar. I am sure it tastes great. 
Have to find my own gluten free variation. My husband even went out and bought a fresh box of baking soda so it couldn't be that.

Great recipe! My family and co-workers loved it. I used the applesauce suggestion and it worked wonderfully. My second batch I used 4 tsp of cinnamon, an extra 2 tablespoons of applesauce and approx 1/2 to 2/3 cup of raisins (I didn't measure, just did the scoop and toss). I also reduced the sugar by just about 1/4 cup (because of the raisins). It turned out really nice. I'll try the Slpenda next week!

Nothing too exciting, pretty plain.  Zucchini bread is my husbands favorite, and this didn't go fast at all.  I've had better, no big whoop.

This is a really, really strong recipe.  The zucchini adds flavor, but not too much.  We love it!  The only thing we don't like is the amount of sugar, oil and flour - we're working on a healthier version, but will probably never find one as light and tasty as this.

This recipe is terrific! I only use 1 1/2 cups of sugar and only 1 cup if I add chocolate chips. I actually used olive oil as it was all I had on hand and ground up a cinnamon stick. It was a hit to all who tried the two loaves. The best was that I made a chocolate chip loaf for the neighbors on our first visit and the first thing their 3 year old said with his mouth full was MMMMM!!!! Can't beat that! Thanks!

This bread was great!  I made it two weeks ago and my husband keeps saying "That succhini bread was really good" I added extra sugar for a sweeter dessert type bread.  the next week I made it with less for more of a breakfast bread. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a hit all around. Simple to make and I split it into two loaves, one without walnuts, and both were excellent. Thanx, Kristen's mom.

It's hard to rate this recipe because it's not the zucchini bread I'm used to.  Other people seem to really like it, but it wasn't my cup of tea.  I'm used to moist, chewy, dense bread... this was almost cakelike.

Really good recipe.  I've made this twice this week.  The first time, I substituted almonds for the walnuts; delish!  The second time, I substituted 1 c whole wheat flour for 1 c white flour; just as good.

I like the two smaller loaves rather than one large one; that's a plus in my book.  Thanks for the great recipe.

this was pretty good. i put it into one loaf pan (about 4x10 or so) and that worked great. however it's not as moist as i would have liked. and the edges got hard .
but overall pretty good.

THE FLAVOR WAS DELICIOUS, THE DENSITY WAS PERFECT [IT IS A BREAD], & IT WAS SO EASY TO MAKE. I DO FIND FAULT WITH SAYING IT MAKES 2 LOAVES THOUGH. IT WOULD HAVE MADE A VERY NICE SINGLE LOAF----2 DOESN'T CUT IT TO ME WHEN IT ONLY RISES TO HALF THE PAN-----IT'S ZUCCHINI BREAD-----TO ME IT SHOULD BE THE SIZE OF A SLICE OF BREAD. I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN, BUT ONLY IN ONE PAN.

I really liked this recipe. My boyfriend loves zucchini bread and asked me to make it.  He loved it.  I never had it before, and wasn't sure I would like it, it was very good

Excellent flavor, a bit on the heavy side but over all a very good recipe. I took a loaf to my neighbor for a second opinion and she agreed that the flavor is unbeatable but it is very heavy.  One piece will fill you up.  My boyfriend and I split a piece for dessert until it was gone.  Will make again with a few adjustments.

Just Ok, a bit too chewy and somewhat bland.

My kids loved this. I cut back a little on the sugar and added a little honey; also used Pumpkin Pie spice instead of the cinnamon. Rather than using all white flour, I used about 1 1/4 cups of wheat flour and the rest white. Overall, very tasty.

This is one of the best, most moist zucchini bread recipes I have found!  I think the cinnamon really makes it.

This was so good! It turned out perfectly! I cut it down by 1/2 since I only had one pan so it took less time to cook but it is so good. Nice and moist. I took the advice of someone else and put sugar on the bottom and sides of the pan and the edges were all nice and crusty and sweet. Amazing. First time making zuccini loaf too!
