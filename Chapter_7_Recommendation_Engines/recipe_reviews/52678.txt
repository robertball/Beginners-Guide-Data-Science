I restrained myself from modifying the ingredients due to the reviews (I always modify everything). Glad I did! My husband is from India, and he is picky about his food. Boy was I tempted to use garam masala (that my husband's Mom made) instead of the curry powder (real indian curries never use curry powder, please!). Well my husband loved this, said it tasted like his Mom's. The only thing I did different was I cooked it more traditionally-I browned the onions in oil first, then added the ginger garlic, then the spices, stirred it for a couple minutes, then proceeded with the chicken and continued. It did need a little water added to it. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Really great for those who love spicy food. Easy, too -- in fact the only difficult part is having the ingredients. I couldn't find the cardamom pods, so I used 3 Tbs. Madras Tamarind Hot Curry (purchased at Cost Plus) and it came out great. Also added more red pepper (we like it HOT!) and a few grinds of sea salt. Since I planned to use a slow cooker after heating the oil and combining the ingredients, I reduced the oil by half. After putting the mixture in the cooker, I added about 4 ounces of chicken stock and let it cook for around 2 hours. Really tasty served over basmati rice. Thanks for the great recipe!

I am eating and typing at the same time. THIS IS FABULOUS! I had to improvise with a couple of ingredients like the ginger garlic paste (I used pickled ginger and minced garlic) and I had no Bay leaves at all, but it doesn't seem to be lacking. We are a family of salt lovers, however, so next time I will salt the chicken first.Keep a beverage nearby because the spices 'sneak' up on you. WONDERFUL & EASY

As far as curry goes, this recipe is a good basic recipe. Easy to prepare and has some good flavor and heat.  However, I changed a few things as others did as well.  I grinded the spices down to bring out more flavor and make the dish easier to eat.  I also added some stock and cream to finish it off so that there would be extra sauce to have with my rice.  I'd add additional fresh red peppers (diced w/ seeds) if you want more heat.  Either reduce the sauce by simmering it uncovered or add a cornstarch slurry at the end.  

Also, I think this dish could really go well with some veggies.  I'll put some baby corn, asparagus, or eggplant in next time.  If you want to add some presentation quality to it, I think some deep fried julienned sweet potato would go well as a garnish or fried onions to add some contrasting crunch.

Much love to your cooking...cheers.

Not great.
1. What Gravy? I added a mug of boiling water and 250g halved cherry tomatoes (I would have used chicken stock and/or chopped tomatoes, but I didn't have any)
2. The cardamon pods were killers when I bit into one.
3. The cloves were killers when I bit into one!
4. The coriander seeds were killers when I bit into one!! (the above could have done with being ground).
5. The black peppercorns wern't great whole either.

All-in-all not the best (infact probably the worst) curry I've had, although it has some of the basics of a good curry.
I'm honestly suprised at the number of 4-5 stars reviewers have given it.

This curry had a very good taste...however, next time, I will crush the coriander seeds before using them.  Every bite, i would bite into a seed and the flavor would be too strong.  Also, next time, I may use chicken breasts. The chicken thighs were a little too fatty for my tastes.

Great recipe and a sure winner. Recommended modifications: use fresh cilantro and add coconut milk (lite or regular) and chicken bouillion for additional flavour. Enjoy!

I liked it, but I found it too dry. I might have missed something, but it didn't have coconut milk or tomatoes, or anything to make any sort of sauce. I decided to add tomato. I have found other curry recipes here much better than this one.

Whomever said "spicy yet bland" was very much correct. Not inedible, but I certainly will not cook this again.

I love Indian food.  I did not like this recipe.  I would like to think I messed up the ingredients.  I am an excellent cook and this is an easy recipe. I found it to be too sweet.  I used minimal red pepper (kids)and ground coriander.  I also had no cardamom.  I think this could have made a difference.  Even though, I still think this recipe is lacking something.

The recipe is definitely missing three things:  milk or coconut milk, chicken broth, and SALT!  That's why there's "no gravy" and it's "spicy, yet bland."  I think the author of the recipe probably just forgot to type in these ingredients.

"Curry" is a generic term and there are countless variations. Like bbq, everyone has an idea of what it should taste like.  I liked this version.  It was reminicent of good Indian dishes I have had.  I followed the instructions exactly.  I was surprised that it did not call for sauteeing anything in the oil, but putting all the ingredients together, stirring, covering and simmering immediately.  Doing that, at the end of the 30 minutes cooking time, I did, indeed, have gravy.  If the dish is too hot for one's taste, even serving it over rice as it should be, Indian currys are served with yogurt, which can be added to your plate to cool the heat to your particular taste.  It adds to the yummy factor.  In the future I will add the whole spices wrapped in cheese cloth, bouquet garni style, or substitute ground spices. Chomping down on a whole cardamom pod is not my idea of a good time. However, since the balance was so perfect as called for, I probably will stick to whole spices, but wrapped up so I can take them out prior to serving.

I have eaten a lot of Indian food from a variety of sources and I was not a fan of this. It was spicy, but flavor was lacking. I even added some coconut milk to help, but to no avail. I suggest trying a different recipe.

This is such a treat! My husband and children loved it. I added salt and let me sy that this really brings out a rich flavor. The way its supposed to  be ;) And served over basmati rice is the best. This is by far the best chicken recipe I have tried in a long time!

Nice recipe! I have been making curries a looooong time (best friend is Tamil, her mom taught me everything I know, I've always loved South Indian food). So I read this short ingredient list and was like "psht!!" But it came so well reviewed I trusted the recipe, didn't add anything-- it does need salt to taste (duh), but otherwise its simplicity is its strength. Resist the urge to add turmeric, cumin, etc. Depending on your curry powder (I use homemade, or Merwanni Punjiaji) there is enough. I think having authentic lime leaves and cardamom pods is vital. If you don't have an Indian/Pakistani market, you can find them at a more East Asian grocery if that's what's around you. You can also make your own ginger/garlic paste-- in fact I think it's better that way. Use a mortar and pestle or a food processor and mix equal parts. I add a little rice vinegar and sugar to mine to help it brown. Cinnamon/cloves- the whole spices are not as important. But cardamom is only right if it's whole. The chicken THIGHS not breasts is important. And if you're unfamiliar with cooking indian food, "burning" stuff and scraping it up with water several times is important (and not in the recipe). It seems pretty south Indian so I would consider adding coconut milk. But the most important part of this recipe (the ingredients anyways, not technique) is leaving it alone, its simplicity is great. Reminds me of what I used to have as a kid (without meat)! I can't get over how great this is. Nandri!

This recipe inspired me to make my own version of it. I didn't like the idea of the whole peppercorns, or the whole cloves. I wouldn't want to bite into the whole clove, it would be overwhelming with sweet, which I did not want. So I switched up the spices a bit, a lot of bit, ha ha. I browned the chicken in oil, and set aside then I saute the onions, along with one garlic, and about 1 tbsp of fresh finely chopped ginger. Then added 1 finely chopped tomato, for about 1 minute. then I added 2 cups of water along with the following spices. 1 tbsp of curry powder, dash of cayenne pepper, 1/4 tsp tumeric, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, a dash of cinnamon, a dash of ground cloves, & 2 bay leaves. Im sorry my recipe isn't precise, I didn't think I would be sharing it.. but it was so good, I couldn't help but do so. This was in fact my first time cooking with Curry Powder and I have to admit, I like it. Ok So I let come to a boil, then I reduce to medium low heat, still boiling some, and in the meantime, I had the rice cooked, Then in the last minute I wanted some peas added to it, so I got the frozen peas and cooked in a bowl with a bit of water in the microwave! Then i added to the pot, Then I added a bit more water, and to make the gravy thick, i added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, pre mix it in some water, then add to the pot, little at a time, you might not need it all.. Hope this helps somebody out there. The aroma of this recipe was amazing, and very flavorful.

Really delicious. I excluded (personal preference) the bay leaf, clover and black peppercorns. Served with a side of rice and raita. Yummy! A new favourite.

My family loved this. I skinned the thighs but didn't debone, & it was SO TOTALLY TENDER! I didn't have cadamom (very expensive right now) or the garlic paste or peppercorns. Since my son doesn't like to feel the onions or garlic in his food, yet they're nutritious, I usually put those ingredients, my spices and some dissolved bouillon in the blender, and then pour the liquid on the meat and allow it all to cook down.  This time, I also added a can of UNSWEETENED coconut milk. WOW! GREAT! Thanks.

I liked the idea of this recipe, but there's no actual gravy to it. I added a bit of ketchup and relish and a splash of lemon juice to add enough sauce to serve over rice. I know ketchup and relish sounds weird, but the relish gives the recipe a little sweetness, and I didn't have any other tomato sauce or paste. My curry turned out pretty spicy, which I love. I would add chicken stock, tomato paste and maybe raisins next time.

This could be really spicy for some people.  The more you let it sit the better it taste. I didn't have the ingredients whole but I used them grounded.  I would brown the chicken next time.  I did add chicken stock, carrots and potatoes.  I didnt have rice to go with it and I put two envelopes of Ramen soup noodles in the pot at the end and it was different but really good.  Overall I found it very good and so my family.  The second day though we all found it excellent.  I originally gave 4 stars and I had to change it to 5.

This was my first time making curry and it turned out to be delicious!  The one thing I will change for next time is to lower the heat by significantly reducing the red pepper flakes.  My husband and I both love spicy food but this one was a bit too much for us!! Would probably be good with some coconut milk or cream, too.  Delicious & easy!

I did this on limited resources and it was delicious! I didn't have coriander, cardamom, bay leaves, peppercorn seeds, garlic ginger paste or cinnamon sticks!  But ground pepper and ground cinnamon worked just fine.  I added a cup of chicken bouillion broth to 1/2 cup of evap milk beacause it does require some add'l liquid.  I like my curry sweet and hot so I added a tbsp of sugar, extra red pepper flakes and a tsp of chilli pepper.  Add some potato chunks to simmer with your curry and it is hmmmmm good.

I too am surprised at all the high ratings, I followed it exactly (with exception to many people's note of using ground coriander, and cloves) and in the end had very dry bland spicy chicken.  Not wanting to waste my meal, I added a can of coconut milk and about 1/4 cup of brown sugar--- it is now edible, but still not going to try this one again.

Great taste. I forgot the bay leaves, and instead of ginger garlic paste I used canned ginger which I minced. 

Season the dish with some lime juice and salt.

Yummy curry not so yummy.  I followed this exactly.  Had a hard time find whole green cardamom pods.  Still I was going to make this as written, so I waited until I found some.  I did remove the bay leaves,  cinnamon stick before serving.  It was about a three star UNTIL I SANK MY TEATH IN TO A CLOVE.  Even without this happening we all thought it had a kick to it but needed something  (salt-maybe).  After learning more you should not use curry powder but make you own curry.  Curry is not a spice but a blend of spices

I didn't like this at all, but my husband said it was ok (I'll go with his star rating as he's from India and knows more about the food than I).  I keep going back to the recipe to see what I missed - there was nothing to simmer.  The chicken thighs gave off a little liquid, but not enough to get a good simmer going.  I added more of the spices and then even tried to doctor it up a bit with garam masala and some other spices, but no dice.  I cook Indian food all the time and this one just doesn't do it for us - which is a shame as these are all pretty standard ingredients in our house.

I have made this twice now. First with chicken thighs and again with chicken breasts. The thighs are much more tender and produces more juices, thus making for a more abundant sauce. I did reduce the amount of red pepper by half as well as the black pepper. I also crushed the spices and broke the cinnamon stick in half only. The flavour was great. A bit of work but worth the time! This definitely beats the jarred curry mixes etc.

Wow, this was a hot one!  I too scaled down the red pepper flakes & peppercorns by half, added 1 cup bouillon & 1/2 cup heavy cream, but this was still hot enough that my husband (a lover of spicy foods) had to drink 3 glasses of soda to get through the meal.  I would definitely recommend adding the extra liquids if you want a sauce to go along with this though.  You won't have one if you don't!  :)

I have made this recipe twice.  Once following the recipe to a tee; the second time adding light coconut milk and cilantro as a previous reviewer suggested.  It's "okay" as written (and very spicy if you add that whole T of red pepper flakes), but totally delicious with the coconut milk and cilantro!  That sweetness really complements the spicy.  I grind the clove and the cinnamon stick and also add yellow squash and whatever vegetables I have on hand in the last 5-7 minutes.

Yummy! I added peas to this dish and used chicken tendors instead of breasts! This is a really easy recipe, especially if you work. Next time, I think I will make it a little more spicy.

Must add coconut milk!  Gravy not runny at all until i did.  Added extra flavor with no extra effort.  May need to add additional spice to flavor to taste.

I added veggies (onions, red peppers, broccoli, carrots) and mixed in non-fat yogurt after the cooking process, which added creaminess and volume to the sauce.

It was pretty good. I made my own ginger garlic paste(the recipe is on this site). I felt that it needed more flavor. So I added salt to it which was a bit better. Next time, I'll fry the onion with the chicken more before adding the rest of the ingredients. I think that will give it more flavor.

'Gravy will be runny' - what gravy?! Initially, all I had was a big sticky lump of chicken, so I stirred in a generous glug of heavy cream. I've discovered that the flavor of 'curry powder' varies greatly from brand to brand, but this time I used Sharwood's, and I ended up with something like a chicken Korma but with a spicy red pepper kick. Not bad at all. Thanks!

This was good, but not like Indian restaurants. It could have been because I used chicken breasts instead of thighs, omitted the cardamom and coriander because I didn't have any. It needed a bit of salt to get the full flavor. It was spicy though, which was good because I'm pregnant and heard that spicy food induces labor and I'm ready to have this baby!

Super flavour.  I only used 1/2 the red pepper flakes and it was still too hot for me (made the back of my head sweat *grin*), but my husband thought it was just right and could have gone hotter.  Didn't enjoy crunching on the corriander seeds, broken cinnamon bits and cloves, etc, so will grind the spices next time and leave the cinnamon stick whole.  Good portion size.

My husband is Indian and very picky about Indian food. According to him, he will only eat Indian food that is as good as his moms.I cook as American as apple pie. Let's just say, I didn't have any leftovers that night. The only thing to watch out for is the red pepper flakes.  A pinch goes a long way in the spicey hot department.

Turned out yummy! I suggest salt& peppering the chicken first, and removing the large items (bay leaves, etc.) just before serving. If you like more heat, add some Indian chili powder. Follow the recipe's suggestion of cooking it uncovered at the end to thicken the sauce. Make sure you use chicken thighs, not breasts, or it may be too dry and not gravy-sauce like.

This recipe is super easy, and a great starter recipe for those that want to slowly approach cooking with the depth of spices in Indian cooking. I added about a cup of water to create the 'gravy', and some salt since I think it needed it. Served it with Basmati rice, balanced very well, also my kids enjoyed it. There is some depth missing though, not sure how I could have fixed that; I have had wonderful Indian food in the past, but I am not experienced in Indian cooking. Because of the ease, I will make again.

Easy, simple and Delicious. Its really yummy. I used Garam masala powder instead of coriander, cardamom, bay leaves, peppercorn seeds and cinnamon sticks, even though i had these things. I guess I was just being a bit lazy, but its still tastes great.

I don't know how it's possible to create gravy when there is NO LIQUID used aside from three tablespoons of oil.  It's a mystery.  Like KatieCat, I added a can of coconut milk, some chicken broth, and that improved it immensely.

This was exactly what I was looking for. I didn't have any cinnamon sticks but it still tasted great! I added a diced fresh chilli to add a bit more heat and added carrots, mushrooms and spinach to make it a little healthier. Great recipe, thanks.

Yummy and how! All I would change is to omit the red pepper flakes because I used a spicy curry. There are so many differnt curry.

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  After reading everyone's advice, I held back on some of the spice - A bad idea for us.  I made a few substitutions for what was in our cupboard.  Traded out thighs for breasts, ginger garlic paste for garlic chili paste and ground ginger, cinnamon ground rather than stick, no cardamoms, parsey for bay leaves - this was a bad idea, clove ground for whole, coriander ground for seeds...  I followed other peoples' comments about adding adding a bit of broth since breasts aren't as juicy as thighs and using the slow cooker.  Both excellent ideas.  Also, I added a ton of veggies (basically, veggies make me happy) - 4 carrots (2:1 for each breast), about 6 celery ribs (1.5:1), 8 baby red potatoes(2:1) , 4 tomatoes (1:1), 8 baby bell peppers (2:1).  This filled up my entire huge slow cooker - low for 4 hours with froz ckn, pull out ckn, cut up and put back in, high for 1 hour.  We ate what we could, then packed up some for lunches and froze the rest.  Very excellent recipe, it will definately be used again.

This is a good, solid curry recipe.  I decreased the proportion of spicy ingredients because I had some guests over who weren't the biggest fan of spicey foods, and it was still a bit spicey for them.  I personally loved it.  The flavor is really good, but not excellent, hence the four stars.  Serve this with some raita, naan, and saffron/coconut rice, and you have yourself a delicious Indian meal.

Excellent curry and easy to prepare! I used two tbsps of red pepper, and it came out perfectly.

This was fantastic!!  Very SPICY!!!  It only took about 15 minutes to simmer.  I added 2/3 cup of water and it made a great sauce to go with rice.  I used chicken breast instead of thighs and didn't use the cardamon pods or corriander.  FABULOUS!!

I didn't have the pods, ginger-garlic paste or the peppercorn. I went without the pods, added ginger and fresh garlic separately and substituted large pepper for peppercorn. That said, this dish was absolutely wonderful! The ingredients were normal and me and my husband both love spicy hot food and this dish did not disappoint. I would recommend this to anyone!
