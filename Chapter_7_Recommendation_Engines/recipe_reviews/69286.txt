My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  I used shoulder steaks since that is what I had on hand.  Prep work is the only "con" to this recipe.  It took about 45 minutes to chop all the veggies (which my lovely husband did while I pain-stakingly picked every ounce of meat off the bones).  I browned the chunks/shreds of lamb in the pot before adding the remaining ingredients.  For me it was easier than fishing the bones out of the stew.  I also soaked my chopped eggplant in salt water for about 30 min to an hour before cooking in stew (this helps to remove some of the bitterness from the eggplant).  I also added a whole can (i think it was the 4 oz size) of tomato paste for a richer tomato base.  The extra paste also helped thicken the liquid in this stew.  I will be making this again and again.  4* for recipe as is, but is 5* with the changes.

Loved it, I used red wine instead of water, added some chilies for spice and put in an extra eggplant. I ate it with Brown Basmati Rice and a yogurt recipe from Sharon's Scrumptious Souvlaki.  Thanks.

We all had mixed feelings about this one.  I followed the recipe for the most part, but added one can of diced tomatoes (28 oz) because I cooked it in the crockpot. (on low for 5 hours)  The veggies all held up nicely and the meat was so tender.  My husband thought it was just ok and my daughter picked out the meat and only ate some of the eggplant.  I liked it a lot. The recipe makes a lot of food, so be prepared for leftovers.  I guess I will have to eat ours as no one else will :-D

What a great stew!! My husband said this was restaurant quality and is one of his favorite meals I have ever made. I tinkered with it just a bit... used left over leg of lamb and instead of water I used some of the lamb stock from the leg of lamb. I also added a bit of red pepper flakes as I thought it needed a bit of zip. This will be made again and again. Thanks!!

Delicious!!

Here are the changes I made.  Instead of using whole tomatoes, I used a full can of diced tomatoes.  I substituted the lamb with blade steak, and used four cloves of garlic.  I skipped the tomato paste because I had none on hand.  I added a sprinkle of sugar and let it simmer for 1.5 hours, covered.  During the last 15 minutes, I added a tablespoon of cornstarch (mixed with some water) to the stew and took the cover off.  Served over rice.  A keeper and will take again!!

Pretty good.  I didn't let it simmer for the full hour and a half, probably just under an hour.  I suggest mixing the allspice, salt and pepper in with the tomato-water mixture as it's more easily distributed in the stew that way.  Also I added more peppers and eggplant than the recipe called for.  Goes well with rice.

this recipe was delicious!! i also added crushed red pepper and a whole can of tomato paste. i used lamb shoulder chops which are a bit easier to find than a piece of whole lamb shoulder. i added a ton more water than the recipe called for because of the tomato paste, but it gave it a much fuller flavor. also would be great to add potatos as a option as well. All in all it was a great dish if you are looking for a good lamb recipe.

I made this recipe not with lamb but with stew beef I needed to use up. I didn't have allspice so I substituted ground cloves and cinnamon, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  It came out super tasty and flavorful, and very healthy.  I like the recommendation below about the wine. Next time I'll try that.  Served with couscous.

I enjoyed this lean, vegie laden stew and baked it in a clayware roaster for one and 1/2 hours. I browned the lamb first and de-boned the shoulder meat, smothered the vegies and then transfered all to the clayware at 350 degrees. It goes great over rice or bulgur rice. It's worth checking with the butcher to know when price breaks on the lamb shoulder are most likely. It fed 8 people. Hearty and colorful meal.

This was a great meal!  I used lamb stew meat, substituted ghee for butter, and wine for water.  It was delicious served with brown rice and a cucumber-yogurt salad.  It was definitely a favorite for both my boyfriend and I.

This was good with a few changes. I omitted the peppers and substituted it with potatoes, red wine for the water, and added cumin, tomato sauce instead of tomato paste, a dash of hot sauce, and a touch of cinnamon. Yum! Great with saffron basmati rice.

Very good flavor combination. I was a little disappointed that the veggies were mush after cooking that long. If I make it again, I will cook the meat, garlic, onion, tomato, and seasoning for an hour, then add the peppers and eggplant so they still have shape and substance.

A very simple recipe.  I made some changes in the Allrecipes tradition.  I used a jar of prepared pasta sauce (instead of paste+water) and added red pepper flakes.  I didn't want mushy veggies, so I simmered the lamb in the tomato sauce for 1hr then added my veggies the last 30 minutes.  Very tender!

This is awesome.  Everytime I have made this recipe I have used leg of lamb leftovers.  I put the leftovers in the fridge and then dice it right before I put it in the stew so that it's much eaiser to chop up.  Today I used lamb shoulder because I couldn't wait until I made leg of lamb to fix this again and I would say that I much prefer using the leftovers from leg of lamb since this using lamb shoulder was more difficult to get all of the meat off of the bones.   The only other thing I've changed this time is my husband wanted to try it without the tomato paste, but I can already tell that I'd much rather eat it as the recipe is written.  Overall though, this is great. Needs no changing whatsoever.....  we fight over the leftovers.

This was very good! I had leftover leg of lamb that had been roasted so I pulled off the meat and added it after I browned the eggplant, onion and garlic together (in olive oil not butter).  Although I use allspice in my cooking, I don't usually use so much so i put 1/2 teaspoon and said I could always add more later and it turned out to be just what we like.  I also use a lot of cinnamon in savory food so I know it goes perfect with eggplant, so I added about 1/4 teaspoon and also 1/4 teaspoon garam marsala spice and it was really delicious and everyone liked it. And 10 cloves of garlic is not too much!  It goes so well with the eggplant.  What a perfect way to make leftover meat taste like it was made fresh.  Thanks for this recipe I will use it a lot! Oh yeah, last note is that there was a small dish left after dinner and I finished it later that night, wow, it tasted even better than it did just made!  I think the flavors were left to blend together, but it was really good!

Perfect stew anytime of the year, however, really hit the spot on a cold, winter day like today!  This stew melts in your mouth.  I made a few revisions:
1.  Used 4 shoulder bone-in lamb chops 
2.  Used 1 can stewed tomatoes (with liquid) instead of 2 large tomatoes.
3.  added cumin, paprika, and cinnamon (about 1 tsp+ each)
4.  Added 2 large chopped carrots
5.  Threw in a Turkish bay leaf

Because I used lamp shoulder chops instead of a roast, I let the stew simmer for about 1 hour, then just let it sit on the stovetop.  It's amazing how the eggplant just shrinks as it cooks.  Chop the eggplant into somewhat large pieces.  

These are the types of meals we traditionally cook (my family is from Turkey).  This meal was ridiculously easy and is so healthy.  We serve this over basmati or jasmine rice.  Or, we eat with fresh baked Panera bread (warmed in oven) with butter.  It's great to dip the bread in the juices of the stew.

We really enjoyed this recipe, and will definitely be trying it again. Used a lamb shank. I wish I had taken a cue from some of the comments from other reviewers; It definitely needs a "kick". Next time I may get a larger piece of lamb, too.

To the saute stage, I added some fresh, sliced okra to the other chopped veggies. I also almost doubled the garlic by using an entire head. At the end, it seemed somewhat bland so I added some hot paprika, cinnamon, and chile powder. Like some of the other reviewers, it was finished cooking much more quickly than the recipe called for...I think I may have actually overcooked the lamb a bit because it didn't shred as expected, so I had to end up taking it out and using a knife to chop it. My advice would be not to set the timer and walk away like I did - check on it every 15 mins or so to check the doneness of the meat.

The next time I make it I will probably also add some chopped chile peppers and try the suggestion of adding a bit of wine and at least doubling the tomato paste. Maybe even some pomegranate molasses? My thought is that this simply needs some more flavor complexity to match my family's tastebuds. Overall, this was really easy to make, pretty healthy, and definitely delicious!

We all loved this!  I had some friends over to break fast for Ramadan and made this.  I substituted a beef roast for the lamb and cooked it slow.  5 kids and 4 adults ate every bit of it...and not just b/c we were starving! The sauce is great poured over rice.

Ive been making this for a few years now, trying desperately to recreate my friends mothers recipe.  Tonight I got as close as I'm ever going to get.... changes are as follows: 1) use more lamb - i used about 3 lbs of shoulder steaks, cut up prior to cooking.  2) i tossed the lamb with flour, salt, pepper and oregano and browned in olive oil.  3) i only used 1 eggplant, 1 green pepper and 1 yellow onion 4) For the sauce I used 1 large can (28 oz?) of diced tomatoes, 1 6oz can tomato paste, 32 oz of beef stock and 1/2 c red wine. 5) for seasonings (which i added in the last 20-30 min of cooking time) i used 1 T garam masala, 1 t hot madras curry, 1/2 t oregano and 1/2 t sage; salt, pepper to taste.  Also used some cayenne pepper for kick.    

Cooked for a total of 2 hours.  Flour from meat thickened up the stew nicely, even with the extra liquids.  Served over basmati rice.  Delish!

First of all, this is an excellent recipe!  Due to personal preferences, I made a few changes by substituting olive oil for the butter, used boneless leg of lamb instead of the shoulder (as it was available), used can of organic chopped tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes, used 1/2 can of the tomato paste instead of 1 tablespoon and substituted chicken broth for the water.  I took another reviewer's advice and soaked the peeled and chopped eggplant in salt water for 30 minutes before using.  My husband was sceptical about this recipe at first but once he tried this delicious stew, he told me this was a 'keeper' recipe and I agree. The prep time was a little longer than noted and I cooked about 30 minutes longer than noted (personal preference).  This recipe is easily doubled and it can be served as a stand-alone stew.  Thank you for this great "keeper" recipe!!!

This was a huge hit!  Instead of bell peppers, I used bella mushrooms for a wonderful earthy flavor, used wine in place of water, and added about a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  I also used a combo of lamb shoulder and lamb stew meat.  Next time, I'll use just lamb stew meat.  I'll also add carrots and potatoes, and maybe slightly more spices ~ cumin, cinnamon, or coriander ~ and cook earlier in the day so that the flavors have more time to meld.  This was great with a seasoned basmati rice and yogurt-cucumber (tzitziki) salad.

FANTASTIC. If you love lamb, please try this. It was amazing. Here are the changes I made: salted/drained the eggplant for almost an hour. Used 2 cans of diced tomatoes instead of the diced. Used red wine instead of water. Added the spices to the tomato paste mixture for easier distribution. Used a whole can of tomato paste. added a bunch of carrots...was going to add potatoes but my pot was too full!  Will be making this again and again. The whole family including 2 picky toddlers ate this up!

I followed this recipe exactly except for making a substitution - my small town grocery store did not have lamb, so I opted for ground turkey. 
I thought this was a little bland, and will likely throw in more seasoning next time, maybe even a dash of crushed red pepper. I will also try beef or pork next time (unless lamb is available). My husband did really like it, and it's healthy with lots of veggies, so I will make it again. I served mine over brown rice since that's what I had in the cabinet, but my husband didn't think he needed it (liked it as a soup) - next time I will opt for couscous.

I was skeptical that it would taste as good as it did with so little seasoning and effort.  I don't even like lamb, but I decided to make it for my boyfriend, and we both couldn't get enough of it!

I substituted 1 can stewed tomatoes, Used garlic salt in same measurement as regular salt.Added shoulder joint and 600 gms of cubed lamb (as others suggested was not enough lamb).Cut eggplant in large chunks, placed in cockpot was bland at first but spices built on my palate and it became more flavorful. served with cornbread...yummy!

Fab!  I don't like watery sauces, so even though I served this with couscous, I added 3tbs of flour after I browned the meat and veg.  No peppers in the house, so I added about a cup of zucchini for some color. W/O the meat,  this would be a good dish for vegetarians over the rice or couscous.  I like something somewhat substantial that can do as a side for everyone but a main for those who don't eat meat.  Would go well with a grilled leg of lamb, or chicken breast marinated in a similar spice mix.

My husband and NINE-year old son loved it ... but what's even better, after they picked out most of the delicious lamb, I saved and froze the rest and used it later as an amazing pasta sauce (whole-wheat gemelli).  I will definitely make this again.  Modifications:  28-oz. can diced tomatoes (undrained) instead of out-of season fresh; and about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes. Fabulous recipe, thanks!

I thought this would be terrific, but it was a huge disappointment.  The allspice leaves it with a funny taste, and it desparately needs some fresh herbs of some sort.  The recipe isn't kidding when it calls for two teaspoons of salt.  It needs at least that much.  The lamb meat was delicious, but we threw out the rest.  Will not make again and wouldn't recommend.

I had my doubts about this recipe, when I first saw it.  It is fabulous!!! This lamb stew recipe uses ingredients I tend to have on hand and is so flavorful and simple. The vegetables meld into a wonderful thick sauce thanks to the eggplant.  Excellent!

GREAT.  Used a left over lamb half serloin, with bone.  Cut down on eggplant (I love it, family doesn't) and served over cous-cous with plain yogurt and cucumers on the side.

Good but not great. I thought this stew had a nice suble flavour, but I was looking for a more robust taste. I added the lamb bones into the stew which added some flavour and tasted great the next day. Served it over couscous with a little yogurt on the side.

Wonderful! My husband's usually the one who makes the Middle-Eastern dishes, but since he's away I decided to give this recipe a try. Eggplants make me nervous, so I just used one.  Although I love garlic, I was a bit wary of using 10 cloves, so I used 5 and then threw in a hot jamaican pepper for some heat.  I let it simmer for just over an hour.  The meat was so tender I didn't need a knife to cut it. I served it with rice, but I'm sure it would also be good with couscous. I can't wait to surprise my husband with this one when he gets back.  Thanks!

We followed the directions of the recipe exactly with no modifications.

There seemed to be too much veggies (eggplant, onions, tomatoes, etc) compared to how much lamb was in the dish.  The vegetables were also a bit bland.  We added more salt and other spices to add some kick and it still didn't help the dish by much.

I liked the lamb in the dish, and would have liked more.

Fantastic! My husband and I both really enjoyed the savory Middle Eastern stew. The 4 stars are only because I made some substitutions and additions, so it would be disingenuous to rate this recipe 5 stars. I used the vegetables from our garden, the only thing we didn't have was green pepper, so I used summer squash instead. I also switched cinnamon and clove for the allspice and added a dark ale instead of water. Delicious -- I will make it this way again!!

I really liked this but my boyfreind did not.  Apparently he doesn't like eggplant. I wish he had told me beforehand. 
I followed the recipe exactly but did subsitute a can (drained) of diced tomatoes instead of fresh since it's hard to find good tomatoes this time of year.  Good recipe!!

This was scrumptious!!  I used only 1 large green bell pepper as I find them strong tasting. The allspice was just heavenly and the eggplant had a lovely texture. I used butterfly leg lamb instead but I will try it with the shoulder next time.  My 2 1/2 year old turned up his nose, he didn't know what he missed.

Everyone came back for seconds and thirds; id say it was a huge hit!  I added more veggies and left lamb qty as stated if not a little less. I like a thicker stew and used a full can of tomato past and only added a can of Rotel. Definitely a keeper.

The base recipe is good. I cooked it in the crockpot; I actually love the way the eggplant melts down to form a thick sauce. Acting on some critiques I added more spices; be careful if you do -- the eggplant really soaks up the spices, and I added enough cayenne that the sauce part was VERY hot.  To calm it down I added zucchini and frozen green beans towards the end of the cooking process; they worked well.  I'll definitely make it again and will play around a little with the spices.  I did use stew meat and will probably try a different cut; the lamb never got as tender as I'd hoped.

i used coconut oil instead of butter, beef stew meat instead of lamb shoulder, stock instead of water, and 3 cloves instead of 10 (seemed like an excess of garlic); and then threw in flax  seed, mushrooms, and sugar snap peas. I also used jasmine rice to give it a more India-esque feel. I closed my eyes and could envision myself there.

Despite the work in prep time, it's perfect for cold windy nights, and a quiet night in.

I used my cast iron Dutch oven at the beginning of the recipe, but quickly discovered that it was too small to hold everything!  I cooked the lamb, onions, tomatoes and garlic in the Dutch oven, then transferred everything to my slow cooker.  I used some of the suggestions (added cumin, paprika, cinnamon, carrots and bay leaf) but wished I had cut the eggplant into smaller cubes as it didn't cook down as much as I anticipated in the slow cooker.  However, the lamb was perfect and the addition of more salt and pepper made this a very satisfying meal.

My husband and I loved it !  I did add some red wine but other than that I made it as is.  I served it over rice with some Naan.  Didnt give it 5 stars only because it took a long time to make and lots of chopping.

This is a really easy and a flavorful recipe. I made minor changes like olive oil instead of  butter. I used Italian whole tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes.  I also added extra spices like Turmeric and Garam Masala.  Over jasmine rice this is delicious. Made twice and always a winner.  Eggplant in water and salt a great tip. I added a little lemon juice to keep the eggplant from browning.

Based on past comments, I made some adjustments to the ingredients and halved this recipe. And it was still an entire crockpot full! GREAT comfort food. My ingredients are below:
1 lb lamb (I used lamb chops bc I couldn't find a lamb shoulder)
1 large eggplant
1 large onion
1 green bell pepper
2 carrots
5 cloves garlic
1 can stewed tomatoes, drained
1 T tomato paste
1/3 c red wine
1/2 t allspice
1/2 t cumin
1/2 t cayenne pepper 
1/2 t cinnamon
1/2 t paprika
1 t salt
1/2 t black pepper

Threw in a crockpot and cooked on low for 6 hours. Easy!
Next time, I'm going to try it without the cinnamon and I'll add a bay leaf.

Wow! Really good. I added cumin and coriander and garam masala. Used beef because I had no lamb. The flavors really blended well together.
