My husband adores tacos and loves sausage so I thought this recipe would be good for a change.  He hated it!  He said it just wasn't right.  I didn't think it was that bad.

Very good. I used flour tortilla instead of taco, layered it with sausage, onions, salsa, and cheese. Rolled it up, then topped with salsa and more cheese. Baked it. A nice change. Served with a plain, green salad. Use a sweet dressing like Russian or French. It complimented the Tex-Mex flavors.
