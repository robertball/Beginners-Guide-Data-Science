This is such a comforting soup to have on a cold night. I needed more water than the recipe called for to get a soupy consistency, so I also upped the soy sauce at the end too. I agree with the other reviewer that it needed a lot of salt, so might try using some stock instead of water next time. I added some Sriracha (at the end) for extra heat. I think this would work great with shrimps (blanched at the end) and a squeeze of lime. Will definitely try it again, thanks for the recipe!

Excellent - like a really hearty chicken soup or stew. I used chicken stock instead of water (one liter plus two cups of water). Next time I'll use low salt or unsalted chicken stock. I didn't add any salt. I also used two Thai chilis because I had them on hand. I didn't seed them and threw them in whole. The jook has a nice heat. I also used four chicken thighs because that was what was in the package. I will definitely make this again.

Never had jook before so I was curious to try. I liked the soup.. the creaminess of the rice. I did find it needed a boost for my taste so I added a very small pinch on crushed red pepper.. not enough to make it "hot"  but just  a tiny bit. Perhaps I got a weak jalapeno?  It does need plenty of S&P so be generous with that
