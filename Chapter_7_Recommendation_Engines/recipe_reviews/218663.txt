I made this pie to bring to a picnic and it made a big hit.  My husband raved over it.  The only thing i would change is cutting the sugar down a bit - maybe to 1 cup.

I had a craving for pineapple pie and this one was excellent! I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup, and I added a splash I rum and vanilla to the pineapple mixture. It was so good. I did add the pineapple with tje juice and all and I increased the cornstarch by a couple of tablespoons. The pie cuts beautifully, and really holds it's shape. This one is a keeper!

This is a good start, but I prefer a creamer custard pineapple pie.  I substituted the cup of reserved pineapple juice with a cup of heavy whipping cream, and only used 1/2 cup sugar.  Otherwise I followed the directions.  The heavy cream made all the difference.

i made this, and it's WONDERFUL! The only thing i would change is cutting the sugar by at least a 1/2 cup, going from 1 1/2 C sugar, down to just 1C sugar. Maybe even down to 3/4 C.

I made it by the recipe. You must be sure to cook the pineapple mixture until it is shiny otherwise it will not be thickened enough. best Pineapple pie ever. My husband's name is Bob and it is his favorite pineapple pie also  So on goes the name.

Really nice change flavor--never would have imagined pineapple to make a nice custard pie "filling".  I had to substitute chunk pineapple in juice (just diced it up a bit) and I only made 1/2 recipe--just used one bottom pie crust and folded the edges up over the filling.  Based on some of the other reviewers suggestions, I also did cut the sugar down a bit.  Love that the recipe is super easy, too!

I'm not a pie maker! But after baking and tasting this one you'd think I was a professional baker! A special friend of mine had an upcoming birthday, and she mentioned to me once that her favorite pie was pineapple pie which I have never heard of in all of my 48 years. I called every pie shop in the state of Arizona and couldn't find a single place that sold this pie, one lady did offer to make me one if I provided a recipe for her. I thought to myself, if she can do it, I can too! I baked the perfect pie! Very simple, I will be making this again and again! My friend loved it and said it was the best she's ever had! Thank you for sharing!

I made the filling to go into another recipe and it's so delicious.  Can't wait for the pineapple enchiladas to be eaten at a BBQ today.  I think they will be a hit.  I had some of the left over filling and just ate it with a spoon, heavenly.  I did add the zest of one orange and I thought it added to the overall flavor.  It certainly stands as written though.
