I made this goose for Christmas dinner (plus a duck) to serve 6 adults.  While the goose turned out tasty and terrific, the stuffing was a bit greasy.  However, I had extra stuffing that I could not fit into the cavity and I had put this into a casserole dish and heated it prior to dinner.  This is a better option as it is not so greasy and you can still present it with the meal.  Simple recipe but tasty!

I usually make "dressing" instead of "stuffing.  I goose just renders too much fat.  I roast the bird on a rack and stuff it with a couple of quartered apples.  I discard the apples but they soak up a lot of goose grease.    Turkey comes with my grandmother's cornbread/sage dressing.  I do a wild rice dressing, in another dish, to go with goose.

I made the stuffing for this recipe last christmas eve (2005) and I loved it. It had great flavor and texture and was a great alternative to the tradional stuffing. I took the left overs to a party and I don't know how well it was recieved.

substituted the hazelnuts for almonds, and this was great, and goose for capon. I cooked the rice al dente and this allowed it to soak in the flavour.  A big hit with my picky relatives!!

My first time cooking (or eating) a goose! I looked at about 6 recipes and used bits from all of them, I think, but mostly followed this one. I used a bread stuffing instead of wild rice, which I didn't have handy. My goose was frozen and thawed, not fresh, and still a little icy inside, so I cooked at 350F. I used a spice rub of salt, sage, and thyme, rubbing it on the breast and the back of the bird. Cooking breast-side down for the first half and then turning it worked really well, especially since my bird was still frosty. The skin came out very crispy and caramel colored. The meat was tender and moist. For the gravy, I used the giblet broth plus some vegetable broth and some white wine, all of which came together nicely. Great success!

The goose turned out nicely. It was cooked to perfection. Amazing amounts of goose fat ran into the pan. Perfect for later use for potatoes. I will use this method again.

I make the stuffing out of 5lbs partially boiled potatos, 10 par boiled onions, butter.   Rough chop together with Salt and pepper.  Stuff goose and 20 min before finished, pour cup of red wine through stuffing.      The grease from the goose is absorbed in the par boiled stuffing as it cooks to perfection

Great recipe, but our 11 lb goose took 5 hours instead of 3, and yes, it was fully defrosted.

First time ever roasting or earing goose for me. It was delicious! I added mushrooms,dried cranberries and used thyme and sage since I didn't have savory.  Really good and would use the Recipe again.

The stuffing came out very yummy!  I put the extra in the microwave and served it on the side, not as good as the in-bird stuffing.  Ours wasn't too fatty, I think the secret is taking out the pad of fat that is just inside the goose before cooking. We brined our goose for 24 hours in a turkey brine, too.
