This sauce has become a favorite for my family! I like to cook the onion,celery,garlic & peppers down in olive oil, & then blend them in the food processer to lessen the chunks. We like it meaty & add hot italian sausages for more flavor. This recipe always gets positive reviews from guests.

Thought I'd try a new bolognese sauce and this just doesn't compare to my recipe. I give it 3* for ease, but to add a *wow* flavor, try this. After saute veggies, mix in veal/beef/pork (1/2 pound each). Add wine & stir until almost evaporated.  You need the wine because red wine releases the last bit of sweetness in the tomato. Then add 1/2C whole milk & stir until evaporated. Next, tomato, etc. and simmer away. If you have a parmesan rind, toss this in when simmering. Always better the next day, but also great in lasagna.

this is a good recipe, but needs to be made a day or two ahead of time to allow the flavors to reach their peak.

Made this on a whim, and my husband raved about it (and he's hard to please).  He said it tasted just italian chili....which I had never heard of, but he's Italian, so he should know.  He even took it to work to let a guy (who is a great cook) try it, and he raved about it also.  Didn't change a thing, except a little less onion as I didn't have enough on hand.

This was a great thick sauce.  It was very simple to make and had a great meat flavor.  If you are looking for a thick meat sauce then you will love this recipe.

I gave this recipes to my husband to make for dinner last night.  The main reason wanted him to try it was because of others saying their picky husbands even liked it.  He made it and said it was easy, and he said he loved it!!!  He also told me to rate it 5 stars and say that yes even picky husbands love it!   I printed the recipe for 4 people but next time I will have him made the full recipe and freeze half.

I was a bit skeptical of the amount of onions and liquid, but I decided to trust the others who had given this a 5*...I made it exact to the recipe and it was wonderful!!  Nice and fresh, and will no doubt improve if left overnight.  We served it with a bold red wine - will definitley make this one again as it was fairly easy to prepare and the results were great!

This recipe is easy and sooo good! I made it exactly as directed, except I didn't have any red bell pepper, so I added mushrooms, which are my personal fave. I used a chianti that was lying around for the wine. The flavor was wonderful. So much better than opening a jar! 

I agree that this sauce ends up being mostly "meat" and less saucy...for me, this was exactly what I have been craving but unable to find in a jar. Do not settle for less, make this sauce! Its worth the little extra effort.

Very, very good.  Nothing like what you would get out of a jar.  This is a very meaty dish. Once my pasta was cooked "Al Dante", I drained it and put it back in the pot over high heat.  I tossed it with 1/2 cup of the sauce to coat it and tore some fresh basil leaves into it.  I then cooked it for about 30 seconds to get it nice and coated.  The over-all effect was great.

Yes, as others have stated this is a very meaty sauce, but that is what makes it so different and good. I used ground venison in place of the beef. I also cut back on the onion to only 1 1/2 and I chopped instead of sliced as my mom would be eating it and she is not fond of onions. What I enjoyed most was the bit of liquid it did have had an almost buttery flavor, rich but not too much. I did find it did need salt so next time will add it and maybe a bit of fresh basil. I let it simmer about 2 1/2 hours and did add about 1 1/2 cups water as it started to become too dry while it simmered. Liked it because it was not your typical tomato spaghetti sauce. For those who think jarred is better, sorry, you must have weak taste buds.  NOTHING is better then made from scratch, fresh dishes!

Every bolognese sauce I've tasted had some sauce to it - this was just chunks of meat and veggies.  Needs salt - I added 1/2t to the pan and needed more once plated.  I'll add a jar of spaghetti sauce and some mushrooms to the leftovers.

Based on reviews, I had high expectations. It was just ok. I think a good spaghetti sauce out of a jar is better!

Very good. I only used 1 pound of ground beef after reading how "meaty" the sauce was. I used basil instead of bay leaves, since that's what I had.  Sea salt instead of italian seasonings and it was so good! Thanks for the recipe.

This was good and reminds me of what my mother would make when I was a child. My husband and I enjoyed it though my kids thought there was too much meat and wanted jarred sauce instead.

I love this recipe and so does everyone I've made it for!  I love to make it early in the morning and let my house smell wonderful by the end of the day! I use ground sirloin and also add light brown sugar to sweeten it up - I've never received so many compliments for something I've made and proudly tell them I got it off this website!

I made it and out of the pot it was quite bland. I let it sit overnight and still bland. But I took out a portion and added more Italian seasoning, salt, basil and Tony Chacere's and BAM! it was all sorts of rich a flavourful. It's a meat sauce, not just a sauce. Outside Italy, the phrase "Bolognese sauce" often refers to a tomato-based sauce to which minced beef (or pork) has been added; such sauces typically bear less resemblance to ragù alla bolognese being more similar in fact to the ragù alla napoletana from the tomato-rich south of the country. If you want something similar to a jar sauuce go with the Nap not the Bol.

Although it did take awhile to make, it was well worth it. The only 2 changes I made were:  a) I only used 1 large onion because I thought 3 was way too much; b)  I used 1 lb of ground beef & 1 lb of sweet Italian sausage. it was delicious!

Followed instructions exactly and it came out wonderfully. We usually don't do leftovers but the whole family had some the next day! As others have said, the sauce is very meaty, but it works well over pasta because the wine and beef broth add such a delicious depth. If you prefer a sauce with a bit more, well, sauce - try adding more of a plain tomato sauce. You can always use this as a base and tweak it how you like.

This sauce is absolutely incredible! I made the recipe as it was written; you don't need to change a thing. I  was concerned that the sauce looked too thick; however, after it simmered for one hour, it got a lot juicier.  This recipe is a keeper ... you won't be disappointed!

I had only 1-1/2 lb of ground beef, so that's what I used, and ended up with a sauce with perfect consistency.  Unfortunately, I didn't think there was much to distinguish this sauce from others, and actually from one I would just throw together for a quick dinner.  This was good, but I certainly wouldn't characterize it as anything out of the ordinary.

I didn't know what to expect from this since i've never made a bolognese sauce.  I was a little leary of all the onions...  but went ahead with it and it turned out great.  Was curious about all the onions and did a little research and it seems to me that that many onions isn't the norm for this variety of sauce, so if you aren't crazy about onions, you could probably cut back, on the other hand, it is a great variation and what makes this a special recipe.  A similar recipe on this website called for 7 carrots!  Now that i just wouldn't do...  but someone else thought it was great.

I gave this 3 stars because it tasted great, but it really was not above and beyond what I would consider a basic meat sauce recipe.  I will do this again sometime and add some touches.

This had a good taste, and you can really taste the sweetness that the wine provides.  We used a local wineries fave (Deer Garden Red-Winehaven, Chisago City, MN) I made it for a camping trip ahead of time and it re-heated well and served a ton of people.  If you are looking for a saucy spaghtti sauce this one is not for you.  Very meaty, but lacked sauce.

Yep, to me this is the classic "spaghetti with meat sauce" flavor--I'll make the effort to prepare this instead of opening a jar, whenever possible!

Great recipe!!
Made this many times and it always tastes great. Can be frozen and reheated too. Better the next day.
