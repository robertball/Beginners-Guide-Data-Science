For a paleo diet dinner it was ok.  But I agree that it's way too bland.

More flavor was needed in this dish. The spaghetti squash is watery and bland and I will not buy again. The sauce made lots and I had to tweak it so I added some leftover spaghetti sauce, garlic, oregano, italian seasoning and a little salt. The sauce then worked great served over spaghetti.

Absolutely amazing! My kids prefer this recipe over regular spaghetti sauce with meat and sausage in it. This is amazing on spaghetti squash or by itself. Its very tasty and easy to make.  The flavors are wonderful!

Relatively bland, but simple meal. I needed to use 2 spaghetti squash, not 1. Good leftovers. I've made better spag. squash paleo recipes, so I'd honestly skip this if you were considering.

I used 1 pound of Bison and 1 pound of Veal and made meatballs.  I added 4 garlic cloves, salt and use whole peeled tomatoes and crushed them with my cavewoman's hand!!  .  I only put 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes not 1 tablespoon, I may use less next time.  Very tasty!! I'm learning how to cook for my Paleo diet and this will defiantly go into by recipe box!!!!  Here's to our Health!!!

I appreciate the ingredients, but something is missing... and it's not just salt.  As a side note, the amount of salt I added to this dish is appalling.  It needs something that would add depth and tie it all together, and I'm not sure what that ingredient is.  As it stands now, the recipe is very bland and one note.

However, the spaghetti squash is fab.  This recipe inspires me to use spaghetti squash as a pasta sub in other dishes.  We loved the texture and didn't even miss the pasta!  Just need to figure out how to spice this dish up because it definitely has potential!

This is a great recipe. So what if it is a bit bland... Don't give it a one star because you can't add flavor to your recipes.

I added everything in the recipe minus the red pepper flakes.  I cooked the onions by themselves in a tiny bit of olive oil to bring out the flavor, the added to them to the cooked hamburger meat and seasoned with sea salt, pepper and dried basil, thyme and oregano. I then cooked the rest of the ingredients as suggested, except I added a larger fresh tomato, diced finely, peeled plum tomatoes, I crushed by hand, and 5 garlic cloves, finely diced. I added the herbs 1 at a time , a couple minutes apart and then seasoned this with sea salt and pepper to taste. Once the sauce, which tasted fantastic by the way by itself, was added to the meat mixture it lost some of the flavor, so I added some dried Italian seasoning (basil, thyme and oregano) and that did the trick. My 17 year old son, who hates mushrooms and spaghetti squash loved this.  Definitely will cook this again.

I made this and we loved it, the only thing I left out was the mushrooms, as my husband does not like them, but did everything else as directed, and it was great.

I added tomato paste to thicken it which was the thing that it really needed. Along with garlic and spices. That made it delicious!

Really good and the potential to be really versatile.  I couldn't bring myself to smother all those beautiful vegetables in tomatoes, so I added some sea salt and italian seasoning to taste and the flavor was terrific.  Although not Paleo, some shredded Mozzarella on top was really good and I could see it making a really great casserole dish.

This was great!  I made it as suggested with the following change.  I added 2 large garlic cloves diced minimally with the onion and I didn' have a zucchini, so I used a yellow summer squash.  
I found it to be quite flavorful.   
I  used a full 1/4 cup chopped of each of the herbs and a tablespoon of the red pepper flakes as suggested and my husband loved it. 
There is a lot of meat sauce left. Will cook up another squash later this week and have it again!

With the addition of fresh rosemary, garlic and sea salt this dish could go from bland to over the top. I'm surprised there's no salt whatsoever in this recipe, aside from what's in the canned tomatoes.

Enjoyed this dish! I had a spaghetti squash from my weekly co-op to use up and wanted something more interesting than the usual roasting it up. The sauce is quite good, although I agree with others- next time I would definitely add garlic and maybe a little more spice. But it's one recipe that actually is even better left over and the combo with the spaghetti squash is really great. Also, it makes a lot of sauce, way more than enough for just one squash.

This was a great dish!  We loved it.  Kids gobbled it up.  Even my hard to please husband went back for seconds.  I did add in a smidge of garlic powder and I did not pour olive oil on the "noodles".  My family is already asking when I will make this again!

I don't understand what people are saying about this being bland. They obviously didn't follow the instructions. It was delicious and a way healthier alternative to regular spaghetti.

My husband made it with ground turkey and it was easy and delicious and next week we will make it with ground meat. This dish has so much flavor I will make it often. We also cooked the meat with some of the spices for added flavor.

I did add the garlic like suggested in video.  I also didn't have the fresh herbs, so I used dried.  It was fine, but I am sure the fresh would make it that much better.

The recipe do not call for any seasonings that will bring out the flavor. Turn out pretty bland, however I added my own additional seasonings.

Easy to make, very filling and I think good for you.  I didn't put in the red pepper flakes and had one large can of crushed tomatoes and one small can of diced tomatoes but that seemed to work perfectly.  Definitely will make again.  And lots of leftovers...

Solid, authentic sauce.  I added  a pound of carrots, chunked and used 2 zucchini instead of one.  I also added about 4 oz. of dry white wine and let the sauce simmer on the back of the stove for about six hours.  A dry red wine would probably be better but don't use because of migraines.  I did use the spaghetti squash but the sauce could be used on pasta as well.

We were worried we wouldnt like this because we LOVE pasta but it was so good with lots of flavor.  we added some fresh garlic to the meat while it cooked which i believe gave it even better flavor!

Overall , it’s very bland as it is written. I suggest adding a good bit of garlic and other seasonings you enjoy.

Really enjoyed having a great option for lowering the carbs in this dish.  I had some acorn squash and steamed them in the oven covered in water in a pan for 45 minutes at 350 and scooped the squash out as a base for the meal.  It worked out fine for not having a spaghetti squash for this recipe.  Definitely will do this dish again.

I loved it, nice combo of flavors and textures. The spaghetti squash needed more than 40 mins in the oven for sure. My husband, who does not like squash or zucchini ate it, grudgingly. Hence only three stars.

It was pretty good. I added minced garlic and cooked the vegetables and fresh herbs and garlic for a few minutes  before I added the crushed tomatoes (I only had an 8oz can of tomato sauce on hand and used instead of the smaller can of crushed tomatoes) then followed the recipe to finish. I also added only a teaspoon of crushed red pepper. I sprinkled some grated Parmesan cheese on it.

Served this to adults, a 14 year old, and a 10 year old. The 10 year old ate the squash only. Everyone else loved this recipe! I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I noticed other people said the dish was bland so I went heavy with seasoning... I added olive oil & a little butter to my skillet then sautéed onions, minced garlic, green & orange bell pepper (1/4 sized slices of each), zucchini, mushrooms & sliced garlic cloves. I seasoned the veggies with seasoning salt, lemon pepper & garlic salt. After adding the tomatoes to the sautéed veggies, I went heavy with fresh basil & dried oregano (didn't have fresh on hand), and then seasoned again with black pepper, crushed pepper & a pinch of cayenne pepper (go easy, mine came out spicy). Once I put the spaghetti squash on my plate, I drizzled it lightly with olive oil and seasoned with Mrs. Dash Original. Then I added tomato sauce on top with basil garnish. So good! I wish I hadn't added cayenne, would have been perfect. Definitely will make again.

This is a great recipe for anyone who wants a large variety of veggies in their dinner. Changes: I didn't use any red bell pepper or red pepper. I used dried herbs and spices instead of fresh for those listed. I added some fresh rosemary (1-2 tsp), salt and black pepper. I seasoned to taste due to the "bland" reviews and it tasted great. The recipe makes a lot more sauce than you can use on one squash. I think it'll be even better as leftovers as the flavors blend.

Not sure why some people said this was bland, just add more seasoning! I seasoned with spices I had in the pantry and it was not bland in the least.  Delicious way to get more veggies in your diet and also use up whatever veggies  you have in the house before they go bad. My husband and I loved this recipe and will definitely make it a staple!

I used 2 cans diced tomatoes with garlic and 1 tomato sauce. Everybody loved it. I was worried about the 3 & 4 year old liking the spaghetti squash, but one had 3 helpings and the other had 2.

This was delicious!  I replace the mushrooms with broccoli and used ground turkey for the meat. We topped with a little feta and it was great!  I love the trick about roasting the squash with water in the dish. It made it much easier to scrape the squash out. Thank you! I would definitely make this again!!

This spaghetti sauce is so good and has so much depth to it!!  I added garlic to it, about 2 cloves.   I make it regularly and sometimes I eat it with spaghetti squash and sometimes just by itself.   It's delicious and super healthy it's loaded with veggies!

Hubby is pre-diabetic, so I've been looking for low carb, high protein meals.  He's been missing his pasta, so I thought this would be a good substitute.  While I did add a few more spices because he likes spice, this was fantastic!  He loved it, I loved it, and the leftovers were even better the next day.

It was very tasty...but with some alterations. I used ground turkey and added 3 cloves of crushed garlic and did not use zucchini as it tends to water down a dish like this. Also added a half can of tomato paste to give it more substance.

The sauce was hearty and made plenty but was on the bland side; I added salt and garlic salt to add more flavor. The spaghetti squash watered everything down and added an unexpected sweetness to the meal.

I thought this was a great recipe!  I didn't find it bland at all.  I used grass-fed beef, which made it even healthier.  And I've never used spaghetti squash before, which was a winner in our house!  Will definitely make again!
