Don't be scared off by the name! My family all made faces when I told them what I was making, but once they tasted it, they were begging for more :) This pie is amazing!!  It actually tastes a lot like a lemon meringue pie, next time I think that I will put a meringue on top.  The only thing that I did differently, was that I used about a half tsp of lemon extract, and half a tsp of lemon juice. Enjoy!

Vinegar pie is a very old recipe and a very good one, built for economy, as most people have these ingredients on hand. The taste is sweet and citrusy. I used 1 tsp orange extract and a sprinkle of orange peel this time instead of lemon. It tasted sort of like a lightly flavored dreamsicle pie. This recipe did not fill my pie shell up as far as I would like, but next time I will try multiplying recipe by 1/2 and adding meringue.  Great old recipe, Thanks!

Sort of a citrus flavored egg custard. Taste much better than the name.
