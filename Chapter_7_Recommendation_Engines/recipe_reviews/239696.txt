I used Jack Daniel's and Cointreau.  While this is sweet (which one must expect from the ingredients), it is very delicious!  Thanks, BETSYMAT!

This was really good! It packs a punch! I used Triple Sec for the orange liqueur. And we had the luxardo cherries so used those instead of maraschino. Yummy!
