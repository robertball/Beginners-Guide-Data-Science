I made this batter and it was absolutely delicious! The only thing is is is way too much of the liquid batter for 1 pound of shrimp. If you scale it down to a 3/4 of a serving it will not leave you with a lot of excess cornstarch batter.

For an even crispier shrimp, dip the second time in Panko breadcrumbs.  Panko crumbs are found in the Japanese section of the grocery store.  They are very light and fry up beautifully golden and they are crispier than any breadcrumb I have ever tried.

My husband says this is the best shrimp he ever ate. ( including restraunts)  I also cooked some scallops like this,and they were also wonderful. I did change a couple of things.  1/2 the water and corn starch, 2 eggs and salt for the wash.  I also added about 1/4 cup of fine corn meal to the bread crumbs. I will make this often!!

WOW...I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars because it totally deserves it.  I'm usually a failure at breading and frying food, but even I couldn't mess up this recipe!!  The shrimp looked and tasted like restaurant-style fried shrimp and my entire family was impressed.  The only thing I did differently was to mix the cornstarch with the bread crumbs (instead of with the egg and water) and to add a few spices to the bread crumbs (salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder).  Also, cut down the water to about 1 cup because 4 cups is way to much.  TRY THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!!
UPDATE: this breading is also great for mozzarella cheese sticks and chicken

I have made this recipe many times and absolutely LOVE it. Reminds me of the great fried shrimp places in Chicago. I never bother butterflying the shrimp. Like many, I reduce the water and cornstarch in half. I add a little Louisiana Hot Sauce to the wash as well. For the crumbs I've used saltine crumbs, bread crumbs (I add a little corn meal for extra crunch) and Panko, alternately. They are all good! I always add a little extra spice to the crumbs - usually some garlic powder and paprika. Although I love Panko crumbs, they tend to not stick very well and often wash off on the 2nd breading. Let the shrimp dry a bit after the first dip and the breading will stick better. Make sure your oil is the correct temperature and let them get a nice golden brown which seems to take about 3 minutes. I drain them on a rack over a brown paper bag for a couple of minutes then put them on paper towels in the oven at 150 degrees while I prepare the rest. Serve with some home-made cocktail sauce (ketchup & horseradish)and some Sweet Restaurant Slaw from this site and it's just like Hanson's Fish Market on Harlem Ave! (of course, you have to serve it in a brown paper bag!;-)

I usually pay attention to the reviews and adjust the recipe accordingly but somehow I missed the water suggestions. Way too much water, definetely reduce it. If you follow the recipe as stated, you can't double dip. Upon dipping your shrimp the second time around, the liquid mixture just removes the first coat you put on. Just don't coat a second time, it turns out fine. I didn't have any fresh breadcrumbs so I very lightly toasted 6 slices of bread in the oven, then ran them throuh the food processor. I also added salt, pepper and dried parsley to the breadcrumbs. It was excellent.

This recipe turned out great! I followed others' advice and reduced the water and cornstarch, and added some onion salt, cornmeal, paprika, pepper, and garlic powder to the breadcrumbs. The shrimp were nice and crunchy, with a nice flavor, not "floury" like other recipes for fried shrimp that I've tried! Thanks for the great recipe!

I reduced the water and cornstarch in half as well as adding 1/4 cup of fine cornmeal with the breadcrumbs as suggested below and the outcome was wonderful!  The whole family enjoyed and not a single leftover!  Thank you for this added tip it really made the recipe perfect.  Sarah

Too much liquid, couldn't get the breadcrumbs to adhere to the shrimp, even with all of the dipping. No salt or seasoning in the recipe. One of the strangest recipes I have ever tried. Was something left out? One quart of water, yikes...

Terrific recipe!  I'm usually not a great fan of fried foods, but we were doing steak & shrimp night for my father-in-law's birthday dinner so I needed a great recipe.  They turned out wonderfully crispy and golden brown.  Had no problem double dipping them in the batter - and I think this contributed to the wonderful crispiness.  The breadcrumbs didn't come off at all after the second dip, though I did let them set for about 5 minutes after the first dip cycle.  The only changes I made were:   1.  cut water & cornstarch in half (but I left egg count the same)    2. added about 1/4 cup of cornmeal to the breadcrumbs   3. added a tablespoon or so of cajun seasoning.    I also used fine grain, store-bought breadcrumbs (1/2 plain, 1/2 seasoned) instead of making my own.    This is actually the first time I've ever deep fried shrimp.  I was thrilled with how they turned out and got tons of compliments.  Thanks so much for sharing!

These are, without question, the best fried shrimp EVER!  I followed the recipe as written with one small revision...I used panko break crumbs for the second coating.  CRISPY & DELICIOUS.  I made 2 lbs. for just me and my husband, and we ate all of them!

These shrimp are great!!!! I made them for the first time last night and enjoyed everybite. This will be the only recipe I use for fried shrimp now. The flavor was good and it wasn't an overload of breading. I did however, dip my shrimp once in the coating and let them sit several minutes just to make sure the coating wouldn't come off while cooking and I added seasoning to my bread crumbs. This one's a keeper!

Yes way too much batter, definitely adjust per other reviewers.  For those who had dipping problems, don't double dip, let first coating dry before second dip.  I didn't butterfly my shrimp but left the tails on for easier dipping.  I used small deep bowls (like cereal bowls) held the shrimp by the tail dipped in batter then crumbs and laid to rest on a cooling rack.  I season my crumbs with Old Bay and Seasoned Salt.  Looking forward to trying with Panko.

Recipe was perfect as is and I did not change a thing with the batter. I did let shrinp set in fridge until slightly chilled before dipping in batter the 2nd time. For comparison I also made part of the batch using Panko for the second dip and felt that they turned out too too crispy/crunchy.

All I can say is YUMMY! And all my family could say when they had this was the same thing! It's a bit messy making these but its so worth it! I served this with an Asian sweet and sour sauce recipe I got online. The batter is just fantastic, highly recommended!

The batter for this was ridiculous. I used 1/3 of the water and it was still really runny. I was left with way too much of it and threw a bunch out.  The dry mixture is fine but I've had better recipes which used Panko instead and/or also had some unsweetened coconut shavings in it which made it more delicious.

Simple and delicious.  I think the water to cornstarch-egg mixture was too watery.  Would probably reduce the water next time by 1/2 a cup.

I halved the recipe as did many others trying this recipe.  I added cornstarch to the seasoned breadcrumbs as well as garlic powder, seasoned salt, tarragon and pepper.  VERY GOOD!!!

I was just looking for a basic Batter To Adhere to The Shrimp, because I hadn't made Butterfly Shrimp in a while. This Recipe was Very Helpful. Though I changed to many things to list Thanks for the Basic Batter To Making Breading Adhere.. I've Added a Photo to My Finished Product. Thanks Again!

Panko Bread Crumbs make a world of difference.  I seasoned the shrimp with Old Bay before diping and coating with Panko.  Only one coating is necessary.  Restaurant Quality Fried Shrimp!

I halved the batter recipe and added about 1/4 cup Old Bay seasoning. I only dipped and breaded shrimp once instead of twice since the breading was overpowering the shrimp. 
Sooooo good!!

Bit disappointed with this recipe. Loved the butterfly idea and the cornstarch coating, to which I only used two cups of water and one cup of cornstarch. If using fresh breadcrumbs, as the recipe states, they need to be highly seasoned (which I did) or they would be incredibly bland. Unfortunately, I don't think that fresh breadcrumbs are the way to go. I use fresh for many recipes, but I wish I had used either dry crumbs or panko. The shrimp weren't nearly as crispy as I would have liked them to be. Will try again though and thank you.

Excellent. I read all the other reviews and took the advice of those who recommended adding spices to batter including corn meal, it was very crunchy and very flavorful, a bit too much I thought. I used 16-20 per pound-sized shrimp and it did overpower the shrimp. Smaller shrimp would be lost. Next time I will just go with plain breadcrumbs, but I will cut the water and cornstarch by a factor of 4 instead just cutting it in half. The measure the recipe calls for would cover 3 or 4 lbs easy.

The batter was way too watery. The flour would not stick well because of the batter so the shrimp tough and uneatable.

Well just made this tonight and rated it a 5! I had never made fried shrimp before at home.. I had to substitute flour for the bread crumbs due to I was all out and so I added 1 teaspoon of baking soda to the flour,  I added seasoning to my flour,  adobo, garlic salt, garlic powder pepper and rosemary just threw in about a teaspoon of each   but the batter although I halved was amazing and this was the lightest fluffiest batter almost like between tempura and a batter.. everyone loved it and asked me to make it again tomorrow haha  thanks for the idea!!

The only reason this gets 4 stars is because the liquid stated in the recipe is a bit too much.  I reduced it and only used 1C of water and 3/4C of cornstarch.  I also used panko breadcrumbs instead of regular--there was also no need to double dip/coat the shrimp, they came out nicely coated the first time.  Definitely a winner.

If it is on the menu, my husband usually orders shrimp when we go out to eat.  I made this cutting the water and corn starch each by half and adding Tony Chachere's creole seasoning to the crumbs and he said "This is delicious, it's one of those things you would remember in a restaurant that would make you want to go back there." He was still talking about these the next day! Used Panko crumbs but ran out so switched to Progresso bread crumbs for subsequent batches.  Also followed the advice of letting them dry out a bit between washings so that the breading from the first go round didn't wash off.  I will definitely make these again.  

This was the first time I had fried shrimp and next time will go for bigger ones.  These ended up like popcorn shrimp so it was lots more work.

Hands down, the most elegant, scrumptious, delectable fried shrimp I have ever eaten. Mine came out as beautiful as the photo  too. Tips: 1) Cut water and cornstarch in half (everything else is fine); you will have a somewhat watery dip but a too-thick dip means you end up with too much breading and too little taste of the shrimp; 2) Double-dipping is a preferred method, as it creates the perfect amount of light/thin crunch; 3) Panko crumbs create the lightest, crispiest breading around. I seasoned mine with a sparse amount of fish rub; 4) If you are using frozen shrimp, run tepid water over them about 60 seconds. This will leave them semifrozen. It is far easier to make the butterfly cut when they're semifrozen instead of fully defrosted. I made a Thai chili/yogurt dip like that served in fine restaurants. I can't believe that these restaurant-quality fried shrimp were created in my own kitchen. Thank you Joy for this marvelous recipe.

Perfect fried shrimp.  I used a cornmeal flour for the first dusting and then finished with panko bread crumbs.  They looked like they were from a restaurant!

This was soo good. I followed the recipe, only adding half McCormick's Seafood mix and half bread crumbs. No added salt. I did take the advice of others and halved the batter and still had too much. I making this again today. My hubby loved it.

We really liked these shrimp, but I would suggest a couple things for sure. First, the wash is very wasteful and I suspect not really even necessary. At least cut the water, egg and cornstarch in half so you don't waste as much. Next, add some sort of seasoning. We used italian bread crumbs and salt. Bet they would have been pretty bland without. I will certainly make these again. Very simple. PS. they took about 2 minutes for large size. So don't overcook

Great recipes.  I used Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  They came out very light and crispy.  This recipe was perfect for two pounds of shrimp.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I took the advice of the previous reviewers and cut the water by half. I seasoned the shrimp and cornstarch mixture and used italian bread crumbs. I placed the batter and breadcrumbs in two zip lock bags and shook the shrimp in each mixture because I had medium sized shrimp. Really Good

Changed the recipe quite a bit based on suggestions by other reviewers.  Cut water and cornstarch by more than half.  Used slightly less than 2 cups breading and added garlic powder, salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper.  Only coated shrimp once.  I friend about 1.5 lbs of shrimp and still had plent of batter left.  So I used the same batter and breading for chicken tenders.  I still had plenty left.  Both shrimp and chicken tenders turned out wonderfully.

This is just what I was looking for.  My kids do not like my fried shrimp because they are too spicy.  This is perfect for them.  I did use seasoned bread crumbs to add a little flavor and added the 1/4 cup of corn meal.  I also halved the water and cornstarch as suggested.  You should also halve the bread crumb mixture.  I did about 2 1/2 pounds of shrimp and had at least half of the bread crumb mixture left.  Adults will probably find this recipe bland.  Just add garlic powder and paprika to spice it up.

I made the receipe as printed with one exception - I had no bread crumbs so instead, I used pep. farm stuffing mix (I grounded itin the food processor).  My husband said it was the best fried shrimp he ever had!  Awesome.

In all the years I have been married, I had never fried shrimp at home.  I am not a big shrimp eater but my husband is.  I used this recipe including the comments (1/2 the water) and it was great.  I used seasoned breadcrumbs on half of the shrimp then used the cajun fish fry on the remainder.  WOW!!!  My husband is already asking when am I going to make it again.  He said that it is better than any fried shrimp he's ordered at the restaurants.  Thanks!!

This if great, better than most restaurants. I would suggest as others, you don't need all that batter an add some spices along the way. The coating sticks to the shrimp very well but don't overload the frier for best results.
Excellent!!

An absolute must to make half of the liquid portion. I halved the liquid  and made 2lbs of shrimp with left over liquid. Very good batter.

This recipe was perfect. I agree with another reviewer that the batter is too much for a pound of shrimp. I actually made 2 pounds of shrimp and still had leftover batter. I encourage everyone to try this easy recipe. Simply delicious. My son has already requested that I make this more often.

I must say that I have tried a couple of recipes from this site and they were great. This fried shrimp recipe is a keeper. Well I scaled the water down and it was still to much. I also double breaded the shrimp and it was extra crispy, can't remember who it was but they said to use panko bread crumbs. I did I breaded with regular italian bread crumbs dropped the shrimp back in the egg wash and then dredged them in the panko. THEY WERE AWESOME. Nice a crispy just the way fried shrimp shoukd be. Thank you so much for this recipe

Wonderful.  I have been searching for the perfect fried shrimp recipe.  I will search no more.  I agree way too much wash and way too thin.  I cut the water down quite a bit. I added enough water to make the wash as thick as pancake syrup.  It makes the bread crumbs cling to the shrimp better.  I made fresh bread crumbs in my food chopper and tossed them in a little garlic powder and season salt.  Then I lightly toasted them in the oven.  Much better and cheaper than panko bread crumbs.  I dipped the shrimp in the wash and rolled in the bread crumbs and into the fryer they went.  My husband sayed it was the best fried shrimp he ever ate.

This is very good. My husband thought I bought the shrimps from a restaurant. I used 1 ½ cups of water and 2 cups of cornstarch per other reviewer and that was too much for 1lb of shrimps. Next time I will use ¾ cup of water and 1 cup of cornstarch. I added salt & garlic powder into the panko crumb. I did the second coat of the wash and crumb after I finished all the first coat of the shrimps to give time for the crumb to dry up. I also refrigerated the shrimps for half hour to help the breading stick on the shrimps when they are frying.

It's kinda hard to screw up fried shrimp but I really enjoyed this recipe. The breading is very durable and does not crumble as soon as you dip it whatever you dip it in. You can get away with half of the ingredients for the wash and I added about 1/4 cup of flour and some seasoning (garlic powder and black pepper to the bread crumbs. Make ya wanna smack your mamma!

Well.......I followed this recipe exactly and for the first batch I fried, the breading came off.  I also  thought the shrimps were a little bland.  For the second batch, I didn't use the cornstarch batter.  I used a beaten egg as the batter, added corn meal to the breadcrumbs along with paprika, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I dipped the shrimp in the egg batter, then in the breadcrumbs mixture.  This time the breadcrumb coating stuck to the shrimp and they were absolutely delicious!!  Will make again.

The shrimp turned out tasty but I'm not overly impressed with this coating. It fell off of the shrimp at first, but when I kicked up the heat on the oil it held on better. However the increase in temp made the shrimp a little too brown and crispy in my opinion.

This was superb! I followed others advice to use only half the amount of water and I used beer instead and added seasoning to the cornstarch (cajun seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder.  YUMU! Served it with steamed broccoli!

As updated and modified by other reviewers, this recipe makes a very light coating to help bring out the natural taste of fried shrimp.  

For a pound of shrimp, you can easily get by using 1 and a 1/4 cup water, 1 egg and 4oz. of cornstarch.  

It's a must to use Panko bread crumbs.  (If you can't find that brand in your stores, put a slice of white bread through a small countertop food processor and lightly dry the flakes in a low heat oven or a microwave).  

As also mentioned, there's no need to double dip.  Dip once in the wash and once in the bread crumbs and then right into the oil.  

Delicious!!!

This was delicious, only change made was I used corn meal instead of starch as my batter...oops. However, they did turn out well. Served well along side Wasabi Cocktail Sauce, and they definitely don't last long. Had to make a second batch! Will be making these again though, definitely.

You definitely need to halve the batter.  I added garlic powder and adobo to the batter.  You only need to dip the shrimp.  Twice is too much breading.

Very tasty! My boyfriend and I are addicted. I halved the liquid batter, but I still had a lot left. I used dried season breadcrumbs, like other have mentioned. The batter also works well with eggplant, chicken, and onions.

This recipe was excellent.  My family loved the breaded shrimp - it was nice and light.  The batter didn't hold the grease and it tasted nice and fresh - not greasy.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Absolutely love this recipe!  My husband did too. Won’t make fried shrimp any other way. I did reduce amount of water and cornstarch and added a little OldBay seafood seasoning. Can’t wait to make it for company..

Used raw shrimp and these were perfect.  Cut in 1/2 thru cooking process to make sure they were done.  Great with crab cakes and onion rings.

I prepared this recipe for our Thanksgiving dinner as an appitizer.  These shrimp were "gobbled" up in 2 mintres!!!  The only changes I made was to use less water.  I prepared them using 1 & 1/2 cups of water and 2 cups of cornstarch.  I also used Panko bread crumbs for the secoond dip.  Excellent dish and fun to serve.  Thank you Joy.

I liked this, but the breading was a little off. Not my favorite, but will make it again to try out a different technique for coating the shrimp.

OH my....yummy, yummy, yummy!  Made a few changes per the reviews- 1 1/4 cups water, 3/4-1 cup of cornstarch, added some ground cumin, garlic powder and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I also used canned breadcrumbs and it was still great.  I wanted a bit of sauce for these so I made the swet and sour sauce II from this site....oh boy, what a treat.  Thanks for the great recipe Joy!

It truly is a great recipe! Just like someone else said, it definitely seems like a restaurant dish. I also cut the water down, but still kept the cornstarch and egg the same. I did add the cornmeal to the bread crumbs. My kids and husband thought it was great, there's nothing left!!!

PERFECT! I've finally found the recipe for perfect fried shrimp!  The only variance I made to this recipe was to add salt, pepper, and Old Bay Seasoning to the bread crumbs.  My family loved these shrimp.  They are definitely restaurant quality, if not better.  Delicious!

This was by far the BEST shrimp I've ever had. It was better than restaurant quality. Half of them never even made it to the table because we ate them right out of the pot. The ones that did make it were devoured in record time! We followed the advice to cut the water in half and added a little garlic salt and Emeril seasoning. Delicious!

I agree with the other reviewers who recommend cutting down or halving the water, eggs, and cornstarch. I sprinkled a bit of cajun seasoning on the shrimp before battering. Glad I did, or esle it would have been a little bland for our taste.

This recipe is simple and delicious. I used only 1 cup water, 1/2 cup corn starch, and 1 egg, and still had plenty left over. This is way cheaper than buying the frozen butterflied shrimp. I will use this recipe forever!

I made this for dinner last night and it was great.  I used seasoned bread crumbs and then ran out for the last ten shrimp or so and replaced the breadcrumbs with a mixture of flour, salt, pepper, and a generous amount of Old Bay.  We couldn't decide which of the two breadings were better, but we all agreed that I have to make these again!

So used the other suggestions and havled the cornstarch mixture but kept the eggs. My bf who is very very picky liked it alot and hs cousin as well but his brother claimed that it was awful ( I think he was trying to annoy me though). Anyhooo I als thought they were great and next time I'll get the shrimp already peeled, deveined and butterflied and the grocer's. That'll make it alot easier and faster.

The first fried shrimp recipe my kids actually ate without complaint!  My kids always pick the coating off of fried shrimp (they're weird; they don't know that the coating is the best part of fried shrimp) It was just a great recipe.

I didn’t have enough bread crumbs so I mixed panko with the bread crumbs. It was very good and I think it will be better with just the bread crumbs.

I followed other reviewers that said 1 quart of water was too much.  Used 2 cups water and 3/4 cup of corn starch and they came out great!  Was always unsure how to get bread crumbs to stick to shrimp.  This worked!

Made as directed except I didn't have plain breadcrumbs so I used seasoned ones.  I also after the first dipping let them sit for 5 min before redipping.  This worked great.  The only reason I gave a 4 was that I felt if I hadn't used seasoned bread crumbs they might have been a little bland.  Great way to make fried shrimp! **** Made again and this time I cut back on the water, actually butterflied the shrimp, used plain bread crumbs and added some old bay to the mixtures for added seasoning.  Excellent!

while it was crunchy it lacked good spices and seasoning... also i tried mixing them in the bowls twice and it did not work out.. the crumbs did not stick to the bread. So I put it in the cornstarch mix, then flour, then breadcrumbs. Came out much better that way

Crunchy, not greasy.  It was just as good with one coat of breading, and the shrimp flavor was more pronounced.  I used pre cooked shrimp because that is what I had on hand, and it worked great.

We had 1lb 16/20 shrimp, but decided to half the cornstarch mixture.  This worked.  We did forget to keep whisking the cornstarch mixture, but they still came out evenly coated after frying.

This recipe doesn't instruct one to actually butterfly the shrimp. This is simply then, a batter and fried shrimp recipe.

I loved them. Had been looking for shrimp that was simple and tasteful. The only change I made was add a 1/4 teaspoon of salt and black pepper to batter.

Very good, however I found that the 1 qt water was WAY too much. If I make this again I will use 1 C, and adjust other ingredients to fit.

Tried this recipe with the advice of others and cut down the water.  I breaded half as is and half with dipping the second time in Panko bread crumbs.  We prefer as is, but next time I will either season the bread crumbs or use italian seasoned bread crumbs.

THE BEST SHRIMP EVER!! I was hoping this would be easy enough for my family to make when I requested it for my Mother's Day dinner. To my surprise, and theirs, it was much better than we expected!! They followed the recipe to the tee, and our taste buds were truly pleased!! As stated by previous reviewers, this gives restaurant quality shrimp! Thanks!!

I gave it five stars coz the shrimp was very crisb like the fried shrimp that we have in our favorite seafood resturant , but the flavor is very poor so I added salt , black pepper, cumin , lemon juice and garlic powder to the shrimp and just salt and black pepper to the water mixture ...so it was the best shrimp I have ever had .
as many other reviews said that the water and the  cornstarch is toooooooo much for one pound , I had one pound large shrimp and I just used 1/4 the amount of the water and the cornstarch .

I am not a seafood person at all. I only made this because my husband loves shrimp. It's hard to cook something that you don't really care for, but I did it. I have to say that this was SUPER easy! My husband said it was great and I think that my 4.5 year old and 5.5 year old each ate at least as much as my husband did if not more, which completely shocked me! And I will admit, I DID try one...not bad for shrimp. ;o) Great recipe! I'll certainly make this again! Thanks!

This was the best shrimp recipe I have tried.  I made this for my mom who is my biggest critic and she loved them. Since I only had a pound and a half of shrimp, I used 1 egg and 3/4 cups of cornstarch. I also added a dash of garlic powder and a tsp of paprika for coloring.

Too much water. What do you want us to make? Shrimp soup? Also, what is the point of the bread crumbs when the "mixture" washes them right off? Waste of time and good shrimp. Needs tweaking like less water!

Really enjoyable. 
Totally loved it. 
I made no changes
I will be making this again
My family loved it so much that they said I should cook for an entire restaurant instead of a single home. The best! I loved it too. Also good if dipped with Ketchup. 
Sooooooooooo Gooooooooooooooooooooood!!!!

I used panko bread crumbs in the recipe as well and my family loved them! It went so fast my father said it was as good if not better as going to a restaurant and ordering fried shrimp, I will definately fix this again!

This is a great recipe I used this on fish the first time instead of shrimp with Panko flakes and my family loved it. I  adjusted the seasons to fit my family taste the next time I cook shrimp I will be using this recipe.This is a keeper for fried seafood.

My boyfriend liked it...he's not hard to please...but I found it kind of bland. Also, the batter was coming off. Would not make this again. Maybe it would be more suitable for a child's taste.

I would agree with others to cut the batter portion of this recipe in half.  Was a big hit with my family!  The only other thing I would do is -- make more!

For some reason, this didn't turn out that good.  The breading was coming off slightly and it didn't taste great.  My husband didn't even eat all of the shrimp on his plate.
