I thought this was a good blend of flavors and produced a very moist pork roast. I struggled a bit with the cooking method. My pork loin was only 3 lbs., so I decided to cook it for 3 hrs initially before adding the sauce. But It wasn't nearly ready, so I ended up increasing the temperature to 350 for the next hour when I added the sauce. At the end of that hour, the temperature was almost 160 degrees but the roast was soggy looking, so I increased the temperature to 425 for 15 minutes to brown it a bit. The sauce was tasty but 2 quarts of chicken stock was too much. I put half that amount and still had a pretty watery sauce. But the taste of rhubarb and apples was excellent. I think with some tweeking, this will be a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

Made this with a cherry apple glaze. Absolutely delicious. This was the most tender and juicy bone-in pork roast I ever made.  Highly recommend it

Taste of sage with pork was good.  It takes much longer to boil down sauce than 30 minutes. Recipe was disappointing -- sounded better than it tasted.  There was too much sauce so I put some on boiled carrots - that was good.
