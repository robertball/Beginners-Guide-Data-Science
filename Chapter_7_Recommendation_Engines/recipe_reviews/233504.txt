I had been trying to make a good, flavored home made creamer to replace the store bought type, which has so many artificial ingredients. But I was struggling with getting it "just right." This recipe was spot on! I substituted half of the vanilla extract with hazelnut extract to create my favorite flavor. The results were excellent. Farewell, store bought creamer! (One tip: I have a Bella Cucina, which is like a "Bullet" blender, and that worked perfectly for mixing the ingredients together and achieving a smooth consistency.)

Sounds great, but one question. How long will this stay fresh?

Fantastic! I made it exactly as written, tastes just like store bought creamer but without the all the artificial ingredients. And it's much cheaper!

Snowed in and can't get to store for creamer.  I added almond flavor and coconut flavor with the vanilla.  I used  sugar substitute, but only 1/2 cup, which was a cup for cup measure.   Also added fat free milk.  So far it tastes ok!

So easy and versatile! My variation to make chocolate coffee creamer, sub chocolate chips for sugar, adding extra sugar, if desired, to taste.

I have tried several homemade coffee creamer recipes and didn't care for the overpowering taste of the sweetened condensed milk. This is the first recipe I found without so I tried it. Excellent! Thank you so much for a really great recipe!

Was sooooooo sweet. I like my coffee sweet, but this was out of control. If I try this again I'll cut the sugar down to 1/3C for sure.

I am one of those substitute cooks. I don’t use milk, so I used almond cashew blend milk which was what was in my fridge. I blended it up thinking it’s not going to work. But I was pleasantly surprised that it’s a lighter version of coffee creamer. I’m not that fond of super sweet things so I may reduce the sugar next time to 1/2 cup instead of 2/3 cup.

Didn't have the flavor I was hoping for. I don't like sugar in my coffee, and this still had the flavor of milk and sugar to me.
