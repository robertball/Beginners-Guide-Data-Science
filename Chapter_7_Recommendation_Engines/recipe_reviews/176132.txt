Okay, let me say that I don't think just giving this 5 stars will express how much my fiance loved these sandwiches. Direct quotes from him: "This is the best thing to ever come out of a crockpot in the history of cooking", "I would eat my way out of a bathtub of this". LOL! Seriously, if we weren't already engaged, this stuff would have made him propose on the spot. :) The only change I made was to shred the chicken after 5 hours and then put it back into the crockpot to let it soak up all the sauce for another 2 hours. I served the meat on toasted Kaiser rolls with melted pepperjack cheese. Thank you very much, needless to say this will be a VERY regularly made recipe in our house! :)

I would give this more stars if I could!  This was sooooo good!!  I "kind of" doubled the recipe.  I used a 2.5# bag of frozen boneless chicken tenders and tossed in two 12 oz. bottles of Frank's Wing Sauce, a whole package of ranch dressing mix & 1/4 cup butter.  I let it all cook together instead of adding sauce and butter at the end.  This was plenty saucy and I think I will go with 3# of chicken next time (the leftovers are great)!  Also great to use on the buffalo chicken pizza recipe on this site. I served this on crusty french bread with cheese and pepper rings.  I am making this for the next party that comes around and I know it will be a hit.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

This went over amazingly well with hubby and his buddies. I had a problem with my hot sauce evaporating about half way through the process, so I ended up adding the rest of the 23 oz bottle, which made it a bit too spicy . I enjoyed the little zip the ranch powder added to the chicken. Next time I make this I'll probably use some chicken broth for the first half of the cooking time and then add the hot sauce. I served the sandwiches with colby-jack cheese, shredded lettuce, and ranch dressing. I'm planning to use the leftovers for Buffalo Chicken pizza. Thanks for another great variation on buffalo chicken.

This is awesome! The first time i made it I followed the recipe exactly and it was too spicey for my family. The second time I made it I used a 2 1/2lb bag frozed chicken tenderloins, 1 bottle of Franks Wing Sauce, a whole packet of ranch, 1/4c butter and 2 8oz whipped cream cheese (to tone down the spice). I put the cream cheese and butter at the bottom of the crock pot, then put the chicken on top and poured the bottle of wing sauce over it along with the packet of ranch. My family LOVED it!! The cream cheese really toned down the spiceyness! We had this o n samdwichs and I bought Boboli pizza crust, brushed it with olive oil and fresh minced garlic, baked it for 10 minutes, then spread ranch dressing on crust, spead buffalo chicken on next and topped with mozz. cheese. That was fabulous!!!

This was ok.  I love hot wings so I have to say I missed the skin.  I think this dish could use a bit of thigh meat, perhaps, to give a bit more chicken flavor & fat to it.  (As my husband would say 'fat is where the flavor is'.)  I also think it could do with a little less cook time because it does (especially with all white meat) dry out the meat and the end result for me was sauced dry bland breast meat.  I think I'll try it again with the modifications I mentioned.

This was good, it had a nice kick, my husband really liked it.  Next time I will add some blue cheese dressing on top when I serve it or buy some prepackaged coleslaw mix and mix it with blue cheese dressing to serve on the sandwiches.... it just needs a little something added to it.  Good for game nights and very, very easy.  This will be a keeper.  I used franks red hot buffalo wing sauce and hidden valley ranch dressing pack.

Love, LOVE this recipe. I've been making the same thing ever since I found Frank's Hot sauce in the store! I always eat mine with lettuce and provolone cheese! These blow the restaurant version of the buffalo chicken sandwich out of the water. Another fun version I've come to love as well, is using the chicken to make buffalor chicken pizzas that are amazing!

These were really good, DH loved them. Substituted regular ranch for dry mix and it was still really good.

Update (5/5/12): I have made this quite a few times and have finally perfected taste and spice. I place 2 lbs of thawed boneless chicken breasts in the crock pot with 1/4 bottle of Frank's Redhot Wings Sauce and drizzle with ranch dressing (instead of dry packet). Cook on low for 3 hours and shred.  Add remainder of hot sauce and cook for 1 more hour. Add more ranch (to desired taste) and butter and serve. I like them with cheddar cheese on onion rolls or toasted hoagie rolls. Cooking with the entire bottle of hot sauce makes them very spicy.

I gave it 5 stars b/c DH loved, loved, loved it!  He is the bigger fan of buffalo wings around here.  Used a 4qt crock, 3 lg. breasts and Frank's sauce.  Super easy, moist and even DH assembled it while I was at work today. I used fresh chicken so it only took about 4 hours on low.

I wanted to try this recipe, and I didn't have time to go get "the buffalo wing sauce", so I made a mix of Frank's hot sauce and melted butter. Great flavor, and I liked alot, but it was too spicy for my family.  Also, I got home late from work, and it cooked 9 hours instead of 7-8. Totally my fault, of course,and the chicken was overcooked (getting mushy), so I will only make again, only when I can time it correctly. Still was very good with my (couldn't-help-it-this-time)changes. Now, I can't wait to try exactly! Thanks, "crazycatlady", from the "Recipe Exchange", for suggesting, and Divinesoalc21 for an easy,why-didn't-I-think-of-that, delicious recipe!

Very, very easy to make. The chicken shreds easily. The buffalo sauce at the end was key, since without it, the chicken seems a little dry.

As a Buffalo chicken fan I have to say this recipe is incredible. Being that I am trying to watch what I am eating makes it even better because you get all the flavor without frying and all the fatty skin. Also this is not only good on sandwiches but also as soft taco meat, on wraps, and in salads. I also used it with some brown rice and vegetables.   I took a lot of the tips from previous reviewers and struck upon the perfect combination to solve any of the problems from people who gave it bad reviews. This is what I did:  In place of 4 boneless breasts I used 3 very large bone-in breasts.  Instead of the ranch dressing packets I made my own ranch seasoning. I did not add any salt to the ranch dressing seasing I made, just used the herbs and spices (There is enough salt in the hot sauce).  After 5 hours, I deboned the chicken and shredded it slightly and put it back in the sauce. This keeps it perfectly moist and tender.  Rather than butter I spinkled it a bit with "Molly McButter". I like it really hot and using that just toned it down ever so slightly.  I used Franks "Red Hot" Buffalo sauce and it was in no way too hot for me. For the others complaining it was too hot use a milder sauce or add more butter. That will tone it down. Also I think by making your own Ranch Seasoning any problems with it being too salty will be eliminated, just remember not to add salt to your homemade ranch dressing seasoning recipe if it calls for it.

My fiance and I loved, loved, LOVED this recipe! I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was super easy to make and tasted amazing!  Instead of using 4 chicken breasts, I used 6, as I wanted to have a little extra left over.  I also added 3 Tbsp. of butter instead of 2 Tbsp.  And finally, I put out blue cheese crumbles, shredded mozzarella cheese and ranch dressing as topping options.  All in all, we got rave reviews on this one.  Definitely a keeper!

I LOVE this recipe! I do just throw the entire bottle of sauce in with the chicken, and I leave out the butter. I also normally throw in frozen chicken breasts, and cook on low ~7-8 hours (while I'm sleeping) We serve it on rolls with ranch dressing and provolone. My son does not like the tabasco-y flavor of the buffalo sauce, so I tried this with a "sweet heat" bbq sauce (w/o the ranch powder) to really positive reactions. Last night I used pizza sauce - we put it on rolls with provolone. Easy chicken parmesan! Am trying to figure out other sauces to use (=

This is incredibly easy to throw together, and really tasty! I used 3 large FROZEN chicken breasts and poured 3/4 of the hot sauce (Original Frank's) with half the ranch packet on top. After reading many reviews, I was leery of the hot sauce evaporating, so I added 1/4 cup of chicken broth. I cooked it on low for about 4 hours, then shredded the chicken and put it back into the crockpot to soak up the sauce. At this point I also added in the remaining 1/4 cup of hot sauce, along with the butter. I cooked it for an additional hour on low, and it turned out WONDERFUL! It was so tender and moist. I think that adding *frozen* chicken breasts helped to prevent the chicken from over-cooking to the point of dryness. I served it as sliders: I cut dinner rolls in half, toasted them in the broiler, and topped the sandwiches with shredded cheddar cheese and lettuce. I was initially going to give this recipe 4 stars, but my boyfriend exclaimed that this is one of the BEST dishes I have ever cooked for him...and wants me to make it for his family. So 5 stars it is! :)

Good starting point and good flavor, but I took the sggestion of many of the previous reviewers and used Frank's Original Hot Sauce.  Talk about salty! We could barely eat this!   I calculated that the hot sauce alone in this recipe provides 3400 mg of sodium per serving (and that is before adding the salt in the butter, ranch mix, etc) - given that the daily recommended allowance is less than 2400 mg, a person would get well over what is considered a healthy amount for an entire day in the meat alone!  I did like the ease of preparation and flavor (take away most of the salt), and I will probably make this again but use Tabasco and a tad of garlic powder, and add cayenne for added heat (since Frank's is basically Tabasco with a bit of garlic powder, a touch more cayenne, and a ton of salt  - Tabasco has 30 mg sodium per tsp while Frank's has 200!).  I'll let you know how it turns out.  I made the sandwiches on warmed Hoagie rolls with Provolone, and served this with Original Blue Cheese coleslaw (from this site) and fresh fruit, which made for good counterpoints to the heat and salt of the sandwich.

Made this yesterday, I knew I was going to be gone all day and the husband was going to be hungry when he got home from work. He put it in tortillas and loved it! I didn't have much Franks Red Wing sauce so I used a can of chicken broth to cover the chicken. It was so moist and delicious!

I took this to my last work luncheon and received rave reviews!  I kept to the heart of the recipe but took a couple of the suggestions from other reviewers...to make 24 sliders (double this recipe): 4 large boneless skinless chicken breasts and 6 small boneless skinless chicken thighs and I used one bottle of mild buffalo wing sauce and one regular buffalo wing sauce...all other ingredients as written.  As a time saver and to cut down on mess, I discovered if you use a hand held potato masher you can break up the chicken in the crock pot to the consistency you want easily without any mess or fuss.

Very, very good! I didn't make it exactly as it says because I couldn't find any ranch dressing mix at the store (the one time I need and they don't have!) I just added some ranch dressing in instead and still turned out fab! Really tastey, my family really enjoyed it! Can't wait to make it again! Thank you for sharing!

I'm not a huge fan of wings, too much work, and the sandwiches I've had never seemed to give the full flavor, this sandwich packed a punch I loved.  I used the remaining ranch and mixed with cream cheese to spread on the rolls to add the cooling part and it was so flavorful.  A definite keeper!!

Although I like buffalo sauce, I must be a wimp because this was too spicy for me. I bought Franks Red Hot buffalo wing sauce and used the whole bottle since it was 12 oz. I also accidentally used a whole packet of ranch and it was totally fine. Also, when it was done cooking, I took out the sauce with the chicken and spooned some back in so it wouldn't be sopping. It would have been swimming in sauce if I hadn't done that. Think I used about a pound of chicken, maybe a little more. You can put the breasts in the crockpot frozen to save time - I cooked on low for 8 hours and chicken was not dry. I know they warn against using frozen meat in the crock pot but I've always done it and always been fine so I'm taking my chances.

This was so tasty!  I only made a couple of changes, as per some other reviews. After 5 hours, I shredded the chicken and put it back in the pot, along with the butter.  I served it on rolls that I broiled to melt butter and crumbled blue cheese on them.    I only take a star away because I really think it matters to shred the chicken five hours in.  Also, I used 3 chicken breasts and only 12 oz of wing sauce and it was just fine; I think 17.5 oz might be a bit much.  So yummy!  Will definitely make this again!

This was really good and so easy. My husband loved it and said he might put a special request in for it on a game day.  I followed one of the other reviewer's suggestions and mixed some coleslaw mix with blue cheese dressing to put on top which really added something! I will definitely make this again.

This is incredible!  Ridiculously easy, too.  My chicken breasts were huge so I only used 3 but they still totaled 1 1/2 pounds.  I was skeptical of the amount of buffalo wing sauce (used Frank's of course and the bottle was only 12 ounces) so just added 3/4 cup, and used the entire packet of ranch mix.  My chicken was still partly frozen but it was cooked and ready to shred in 6 hours.  The chicken was completely delicious.  Moist, tender, saucy, perfect amount of heat.  We devoured these and I plan to use some of the leftovers to make a buffalo chicken pizza.  It would have been too hot with the whole amount of wing sauce though.  As my mom says, you can always add more but you can't take anything out!

I made the chicken as recommended, but made wraps rather than sandwiches.  I put a few fork-fulls of chicken in a tortilla, covered with some shredded lettuce and ranch dressing.  Buffalo ranch chicken wraps - yum.

A really delicious, different way to make chicken in the slow cooker. I made as written and thought it was awesome. Next time I'll try adding a full pack of ranch, just because I don't like the half pack sitting around and we do love our ranch flavor. I cooked for the full seven hours on low and the breasts practically shred themselves in the crock, they were so tender. Served on ciabatta rolls browned in a skillet with butter on the cut halves, provolone on mine and pepperjack on his: we were both very satisfied. Thanks so much for sharing :)

A big hit for potluck of 12 ppl with the following changes! 6 breasts, 6 thighs, 2 btl(12 oz) buffalo wing sauce, 1 can low sodium tomato soup, 2T butter, low sodium ranch dressing mix. 5 hrs on low, shred, 1 hr on low. Serve with crumbled bleu cheese. Makes a lot of sauce - I think it could use more chicken. Thank you for the awesome idea!

The heat of this recipe will depend on your buffalo wing sauce.  Franks does make a mild sauce people!  If you don't like it hot, don't use the hot variety!  I used a bit of hot Franks buffalo wing sauce and more of the hot and spicy Franks BBQ sauce.  I made my own dry ranch dressing mix from a recipe here on AR and used the whole recipe. I never added butter.  I also used 6 frozen chicken tenderloins.  They cooked in my slow cooker on low in 3 hours.  Yes the chicken was spicy hot but that is a function of the sauce I used.  I dumped in some bottled ranch dressing and we toned down the sandwiches with some cole slaw.  It was very good.  This is a good basic recipe which you can alter to you own tastes.  Thanks!

YUM!  I love hot wings, so I had a feeling I would like this.  I was right!  Hubby liked it too, and he doesn't like wings (he doesn't like any meat with bones in it).  It went over very well at our LAN party. Lots of compliments and second (and third) helpings.  I made my sandwich with white American cheese, Blue Cheese dressing for the buns, and celery sticks on the side, but most of the guys just had their sandwiches plain.  Some reviewers complained that the chicken mixture dried out in the crock pot, but I had rather the opposite problem.  My shredded chicken mixture was positively soupy.  It made for some messy sandwiches!  I think that perhaps the chicken breasts I used were a bit on the small side, though.  I will definitely make this again, but I think I will perhaps cut back on the wing sauce, and add a bit more ranch dressing powder, just to give it a bit more complex flavor.  However, it was perfectly delicious made just as the recipe states.

For the ease of making this recipe, it was pretty darn good. I cooked the chicken with hot sauce and a mixture of ranch dressing and blue cheese dressing. We didn't have the dried ranch on hand and this worked out fine. This recipe definitely packed some heat though.

Wonderful! I added some chicken broth at the beginning because I didn't want all of the buffalo sauce to evaporate. They were wonderful. I saved the left over chicken and am going to try a buffalo chicken pizza. Thanks for the recipe!

These were great! I didn't use quite as much hot sauce as called for on the original recipe.  I added 1/2 block of cream cheese (used 1/3 less fat) and it made them a little creamier.  Without these two changes this would have been way to spicy for us (and we love the taste of buffalo sauce).  Served them on mini subs and sprinkled with shredded cheddar and ranch smeared on the subs.  We had leftovers for dinner and the chicken was not as spicy as it was right after it was done cooking.  Will definitely make these again soon!  DELICIOUS!

If you like chicken wings you will love this.  This was great and the chicken shredded so well I couldn't believe how easy it was.  So good.  I can't wait to experiment with different sauces.

I made this yesterday for the first time. I put 6 frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot along with the recommended wing sauce and ranch seasoning pkt. It smelled wonderful cooking-just like hot wings! After the chicken was cooked I took it out and shredded it, (put in some butter) then put it back into the crockpot to reabsorb the juices and seasoning. My daughter and husband walked in from basketball and thier mouths started watering. They told me the could smell it all the way in the garage! We toasted regular buns in the oven and scooped the chicken on. It was very good, and low fat b/c of the breast meat. I think I will skip on the butter next time b/c I notice on the wing sauce bottle that butter decreases the wing sauce hotness. We will make again, over and over! Thanks for the great idea!

I thought this recipe was amazing.  I did modify it by adding about 3/4 bottle of Frank's and about 3/4 cup of prepared ranch dressing and it had the perfect amount of sauce. It turned out fabulous.  If I had had more time I would have added some onions and celery to the chicken in the last 2 hrs of cook time.  I served it on toasted buns with shredded cheese on top and a drizzle of ranch with celery sticks on the side!!! YUMMY!!

I made this with texas petes buffalo chicken sauce. I used 5 chickens and the whole 17 oz bottle. This tastes delicious. DO NOT TRY if you DONT LIKE SPICY FOOD! I love hot and spicy so this is great to me. but if spicy isnt your thing you will hate this. I also shredded the meat about an hour before it was done so that it could soak up more of the hot sauce

I used Frank's Red Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce for this recipe and it was definitely spicy.  I didn't have dry ranch salad dressing so I used regular Ranch dressing.  My husband really liked this, though I can't say I was a big fan of it.  It was too spicy for my likings.

This is a very  nice and spicy dish to fix and forget in the slow cooker until it is done!  I did shred the chicken in about 3/4 of the way done.  I also used only had half a bottle of the buffalo wing sauce that I had on hand and it still was saucy and spicy enough.  We served this chicken up on multi-grain kaiser rolls and enjoyed it quite a bit.

Oh my goodness, these are so delicious!  I topped ours with ranch dressing, and next time I might dice some celery also to add to the sandwiches.  My husband & I couldn't get enough.  I made this with Scott's Buffalo Wing Sauce from here and would not change a thing.  I look forward to making this LOTS during Football season!!

super easy, great flavor...but killer hot!  Although I like spicy, next time I think I would use less wing sauce and more of another liquid.  I would have to experiment.  I served these w/ blue cheese dressing.  I will make this again.  Yum.

I used the thick (pour that stuff on everything) franks red hot sauce and mixed in a couple of teaspoons of the regular franks red hot sauce and walah, awesome thick non runny sauce!  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, 1 purple onion sliced and orange/red/yellow bell peppers as well, just threw all the veggies into the crockpot with the chicken and was supurb, served on whole wheat buns.....

This recipe was extremely salty and I am a guy who will eat an entire bag of sun flower seeds in one sitting.  We used Franks Hot Sauce.  I dont know if that has anything to do with it or not but holy cow.  Gave me bitter beer face.

Awesome and EASY meal! I put the chicken on around 9 a.m. and then at 7 p.m. I shred the chicken, added remaining sauce and butter (about an hour before eating to let sauce really soak in.) I served them on buns toasted with a little olive oil and garlic powder. Healthier alternative to Fried Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches! Yum!

Now I can have my own chicken pull apart sandwich.  I've never fixed anything like this before...and my only hesitation now is the amount of salt. I used unsalted butter to help a little. Not sure if it helped the volume of salt, but I used about 12 oz of Frank's mildest buffalo wing sauce with some GATES Kansas City BBQ sauce and a splash of white wine for the marinade/slow cooker sauce.  I also added some diced bacon bits I had around.  Raw bacon would have cooked fine too. Sauteed in garlic/butter sauce some onion rings and sliced Shitake mushrooms later to put on top of the sandwich.  Very good flavor with enough spice fer sure (Gates isn't for sissy's either).

I made this yesterday since it was too hot to cook. I only used 1/4 of the ranch seasoning since I was worried it would be too salty. I used Texas Pete Buffalo Chicken Sauce as well. This was very good and very easy to make. My chicken was small so it only took about 5 hours to cook on low. Once I shredded them I put it all back in the crockpot with some unsalted butter so it would absorb some of the sauce. My husband liked this alot and we will be using the leftovers for wraps and salads. Thank you for a easy recipe!!!!

My husband loves this! I make it for him if he's going to be on guard duty because it makes a lot, and I can send plenty for the other soldiers. We use Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Wing sauce :)

Perfect. I made in skillet instead of crocpot because I couldn't wait til the following day to make it.

Heated olive oil on medium, cooked chicken about 6 minutes. Then flipped chicken, added hot sauce, ranch and butter. Reduced heat and simmer with lid on until done- About 15 minutes.

 It was delicious. Will make again and again.

This was a big hit!!! I read so many of the reviews and was debating how much wing sauce to put with the chicken. We love spicy stuff! I just happened to have about 10 ounces of Louisiana wing sauce original in the cabinet so I used that. I also added about a tablespoon of butter in the beginning with one packet of ranch. Cooked on low for about 4 hours then turned on high for about one hour then shredded the chicken and put back in the original sauce. Once shredded I put back on low for about 2 hours which was perfect. I used 2 frozen breasts and 5 tenderloins. This made a big batch!! I was so unsure to drain the chicken or not but I am glad I did not, the shredded chicken soaked up the rest of the sauce. I never did add any extra hot sauce. I also added about 1/4 block of cream cheese and a little garlic pepper. This was perfect. It was very spicy so I would never be able to use the entire bottle of Wing sauce. Thank you for a great recipe!!!!!!! Oh and I used hoagie buns, I put butter on them and a thin layer of sharp shredded cheddar and baked about 4 minutes for a toasted bun. Happy happy husband!!!

I kept wanting to make this recipe, but never did, it came up on the buzz so I finally remembered to make it. it was so good.I actually didn't follow the directions and just threw everything in the crock pot at once. didn't have dry ranch so I used a bottle of prepared ranch. at one point it was looking a little dry so I added some chicken broth. I also used 6 chicken breast halves will be making this again. esp when we go camping. there were no left overs to make a pizza like I was hoping. so glad I made  this recipe.

For those of you who said this was too salty, DO NOT use the ranch dressing mix. You don't need it. It's still good without it. =)

Holy moly this is awesome!  Used Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce (what else).  Husband told me to put this on the list of "keeper" recipes.  Used the leftovers the next night to make the "Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza" recipe from this site- also awesome and a great use for the leftovers.  Made the "Blue Cheese Coleslaw" recipe from this site for the sandwich's side dish.

I'm shocked that this recipe received such good reviews.  I used the whole ranch pack and I couldn't even taste it.  I LOVE spicy food but this just tasted WAY too salty and REALLY HOT!   I couldn't even finish my sandwich and neither could my husband.  I used huge rolls and cheese which I thought would offset the heat.  Sorry!

Fantastic. Served on a fresh roll with a little ranch dressing, lettuce and sliced onion. My husband was amazed, loved it. I will say, that I NEVER, EVER, EVER, cook chicken for more than 4 or 4.5 hours in the crockpot. EVER. I cooked three large breasts for 4.5 hours for this recipe and it was perfect. Anytime I cook chicken longer than that in the crockpot it comes out dry and tough.

Endless possibilities! Love this recipe so much but don't limit yourself to just serving it on a bun. I've used it in tacos, lettuce wraps, on pizza, in a salad, but my personal favorite is on top of a baked potato. Enjoy!

This was good. I omitted the ranch seasoning since some ppl aren't fond of ranch with their buffalo chicken and because some of the reviews said the recipe was overly salty. Instead, ppl can put ranch or blue cheese on their sandwich. I just drizzled a little Franks Buffalo sauce on mine. Simple, easy & tastes good! Can't beat it!

I read through many of the reviews and was getting a little worried about it being too salty/spicy.  After cooking for 5 hours, I drained off the sauce and shredded the chicken.  I only added enough of the sauce back in to make it moist...all of it would have been way too much.  I also used 3 chicken breasts and 2 thighs to give it a bit more depth.  It went over very well for our Super Bowl party.

Excellent! So easy! I only had 3 large chicken breasts and 12 oz of Franks wing sauce, so I went with it and it worked out great! Added just a tad water with chicken boullion (I would estimate 4-5 Tbsp) with the 3/4 of the bottle of sauce and the dry ranch mix and it was very saucy and nice n spicy. My chicken wasn't dry at all at exactly 6 hrs. (last 1/2hr shredded chicken and let it soak up the sauce). I didn't miss the fatty fried skin at all! Tasted like a buffalo chicken sandwich you'd get in a restaurant, but it might be a tiny bit less fat/calories than the fried breast. :)  I put extra sauce and ranch dressing on top before topping with the top bun (adding the fat back in!). Provelone or Jack cheese would have been great too. Definitely will be making again! We will be having buffalo chicken pizzas this week with the leftovers! Mm. Thanks for the great recipe.

"Great Cluck for your Buck!"  This was a very easy recipe!  After reading previous reviews I placed my chicken breast in the crockpot with chicken broth and Franks Wing sauce and cooked on low for about 6 hours.  Afterwards, I shredded the chicken and placed back in the crockpot with more franks sauce.  I just tasted and poured~tasted and poured~this may have helped with the salty taste previous posters reported.  Great sandwich served with french fries and cut celery and of course a great football game~GO VOLS!!!

I have made this recipe a bunch of times, it is so good.  I use a 12oz bottle of buffalo sauce and 1 whole packet of ranch dressing mix.  I shred the meat and put it back in the sauce until I am ready to serve it.  My favorite way to serve this is on wraps with blue cheese, provolone, lettuce and tomato.  So yummy.

I've made this so many times since finding the reciepe on AR! These are so good and easy! You can adjust the hotness according to the amount of sauce you use! You can also get creative with the way you serve this! We love them on a hoagie roll, but this is great in a salad, in a wrap, or used as taco filling! YUMMIE!!

I used Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce and it turned out great. I shredded the chicken midway during cooking so it could absorb all of the sauce. This chicken was such a hit, I made a second (larger) batch two days later. I took a suggestion from KatieO and used the leftovers to make the Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza the following night. This one's a keeper for me.

I'll be anxious to see how my family of Hot buffalo wing eaters like this at our family get-together.  I wish I knew what "heat" wing sauce to have used - since I made a large quanity I  used Frank's original  and added some hot thinking it would make everyone happy. I put it all in - ended up toning it down with some chicken broth - we still felt it was hot but will probably be perfect for the family (adults). Frank's comes in so many heats - it would be helpful if that was specified for us that are unsure. I plan to use "Resturant-Style Coleslaw I" and "Bob's Bluecheese Dressing" ;) I'm sure these sandwiches will make everyone happy! I made it in advance and froze it - anything to make life easier so you can spend time with everyone!!

I have been making this almost once a week for my husband who LOVES this recipe. It only takes 3 and a half hours on high to cook 4 chicken breasts. I have tried several wing sauces but I like the Kroger brand Medium wing sauce the best - some kick but not too strong. I use the leftovers and make a buffalo chicken salad with Blue Cheese Crumbles and Blue Cheese dressing. Thanks for a great and super easy recipe!

We really liked this and it was super easy!  I put the chicken, franks sauce, and I used ranch dressing b/c I didn't have the dry mix, and cooked on low all day.  When I got home I removed the chicken, poured out the liquid (the dressing made it a little separated) and shredded the chicken, and tossed it back in the CP w/ a little more franks and ranch and let warm while I toasted the buns.  I added some mozzarella cheese b/c it's what I had on hand, and it was delish!  I can't wait to try w/ provalone!

These are great for afternoon brunch and/or dinner.  I added a bit more hot sauce as we like things a bit more spicy, but other than that, it is a great recipe. As a side note, if you add a little fresh blue cheese to the top, it tastes gourmet!

Needed something QUICK and tasty. This fit the bill. Made it on my lunchbreak in about five minutes. Came home on break to pull apart and soak in remaining sauce. Heaven by seven pm! Made enough for dinner for six and a stuffed buffalo chicken pizza at the end of the week.

Fabulous. It's become a staple around here. We use extra hot sauce in the crock pot so it comes out perfectly saucy, served on keiser buns. I have ommitted the powdered ranch a few times if I haven't had it on hand, and haven't missed it - fabulous both ways. I usually sprinle a little "garlic plus" in with the hot sauce. SO GOOD.

This is a keeper. I liked how different they were, it's a nice twist from BBQ sauce.  I toasted the rolls and then added blue cheese dressing.  Next time I think I'll add some cheese.

WOW! This was really good and will be a regular in my house. It was so easy and tasty. I used Franks Wing Sauce which was 12 oz and I used around 8-9 oz and that was plenty. There is no way I would use a 17.5oz bottle or it would be way too spicy for my family. It was too spicy for my toddler but I took out some chicken before I shredded it and he ate that but wouldn't eat the saucy chicken. However the hubs and I thought it had the right amount of spice with the 8-9oz of sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!!

Way too spicy (and I LOVE spicy food). I even used half of what the recipe said and it was still inedible. I will make again, just using EVEN LESS than what I did the first time.

This was delicious!I've never tried buffalo wing sauce on anything so I had no idea what to expect but I loved it. I was afraid it would be too hot for me but it wasn't at all and I even put extra on my sandwich.I used the Franks buffalo sauce and I served the sandwiches with blue cheese coleslaw.I loved the coleslaw with this and all I did was whisk 1/2 cup mayo,1/2 cup buttermilk,1 TB apple cider vinegar,2 TB sugar and 1 oz crumbled blue cheese then add a bag of coleslaw mix.I served the chicken and slaw in deli buns and everyone loved it.I would not change a thing with this recipe.

I've been making this recipe at least twice a week for over a year. My menu changes regularly as I love to experiment with new foods, but this is one thing my family just won't do without. It is our absolute favorite meal. My husband has had me make it for ALL of his friends and family and I've gotten major good wiffey points. I've tweaked it a little over time to make it cheaper and easier, but it's still just as amazing. I use Franks Red Hot (not the buffalo sauce, but the hot sauce) and I use about 1/3 bottle - 1/2 bottle. This way the chicken isn't so saucy, it makes the bread to soggy to eat. Also, I serve it on hamburger buns, or preferably onion buns. And if you don't have a slow cooker, no problem. Cook the chicken separately, however you prefer, shred it in a pan and add ingredients (I use ranch straight from the bottle, cheaper than the powder). Throw the buns in a warm oven just long enough to get crispy and serve.... YUM! I'd rather stay in and eat this than eat out any day, even if it means doing the dishes.

Couldn't be much easier.  My guests liked it.  I'm not huge into buffalo flavor.  It wasn't anything special, per se, but definitely buffalo chicken.

So easy! And tasty! I tasted it after shredding it and thought, "uh oh, this is kind of missing something", but after putting the butter in it really did the trick. Served with blue cheese dressing, lettuce, tomato and onion. It tasted like a Buffalo Chicken Finger Sub, but lighter/healthier. This chicken would be awesome on pizza, in wing dip, even made into a quesadilla....great possibilities.

I couldn't believe how juicy, tender and flavorful this was. I followed the advice of other reviewers and added a bit of chicken broth at the beginning of the cook time. Back in Western New York, we don't buy bottled "wing sauce;" we mix Frank's Hot Sauce and melted butter (the more butter, the milder the sauce). I did that here, and omitted the butter added later in the recipe. Like others, I didn't have dry ranch dressing mix on hand and substituted in regular ranch dressing. It was fine, but I will try it next time with the dry mix. I didn't add more wing sauce at the end--it was more than spicy and saucy enough at that point. Very well received at the potluck to which I took it, and many people asked for the recipe.

I would give this recipe ten stars if I could! WOW...so wonderful. I love all things "buffalo," and this certainly filled the bill. I made it exactly as written and could probably eat it every single day. It's so deceptively simple I wonder why I didn't think of it myself! Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

This was DELICIOUS! I was skeptical of cooking raw chicken in the crockpot, but it tured out fantastic. I did add slices of one onion and used a BBQ sauce of my choice. I shredded the chicken about an hour before it was done and it was wonderful. My family loved it and my son took all the leftovers back to school with him. I guess I'll have to make it again! I would rate it a 10 if I could!

I love love love this recipe!! I used Franks wing sauce: buffalo. I just had jaw surgery and the one thing I have been craving is buffalo wings. I can only eat food that is shredded down and this defiantly fits the description!! After 7 hours the chicken is falling apart. Shred the chicken directly in the cooking juice. Great for football parties!!! Can make buffalo chicken pizza with the leftovers... if there are any!

The packages of ranch dressing mix were smaller than the recipe called for - still all we could taste was SALT. It was so bad my family couldn't eat it. Maybe leave out the dry mix and use ranch dressing on the top of the meat when eatin the sandwich

Being a huge fan of buffalo chicken but no so much of dealing with wings, I thought this sounded perfect!  And it pretty much was.  I fixed this yesterday in the crock pot exactly as stated in the recipe, except I doubled it. It was a big hit with everyone.  There were some leftovers that we reheated for lunch today and it was EVEN BETTER.  Next time I will make a day ahead of time and let it sit overnight.  I served this on hamburger buns with monterey jack cheese and ranch dressing for those who wanted it.  Even the kids are asking for a "do-over"!

As much as I loved the flavor of the chicken and how easy it was to put together, it's really better for pizza or a wrap. It was way too messy for sandwiches. The only change I made was to do a nice "gloop" of ranch dressing in with the buff sauce to add more moisture. My chicken came out so juicy and not dried out at all and it shredded beautifully. Also, to anyone who had the issue of dried up chicken, make sure your crock pot isn't malfunctioning. Check your user manual to see what the temp should be for "low" setting and use a thermometer to check it. If it's off then that's why your chicken dried out (it cooked too fast). Hope this helped someone!

Very good! Many said it's too salty, but I didn't think so. Others said it's too spicy. Well, buffalo wings are always spicy...often spicier than this was. If you don't like heat, this isn't for you! 

I used 5 half breasts and bathed them in about 6 oz of Moore's buffalo wing sauce and half a ranch packet. My husband loves wings and spicy foods, and he loved this, so I'm making it again tonight. The last time I made this, I used about 10 oz of the 12 oz bottle, and it was a little too saucy, so I imagine that using 17.5 oz on 4 half breasts would be way too saucy. I'm sticking with about half the Moore's bottle for now, and if it dries up, I'll add more. Easier to add than to take away! I'm leaving out the butter because this recipe already isn't very healthy. Make sure you don't over-shred the chicken. I did that the last time I made this because the chicken was so tender, and it almost became like a mush. It was still good, but the slightly chunky chicken texture shown in the picture wasn't there, and we would have preferred it, so I'm going to be more careful this time and will probably stop cooking it at 6 hours rather than 7. This recipe was too spicy for me, so I'm going to try Texas Pete's extra mild buffalo sauce the next time I make this, because I want to enjoy it as much as my husband does! Thanks for the recipe.

Very good! To cut some of the heat, I modified by adding about a cup of chicken broth and a T of BBQ sauce. It still had enough a kick to it. Like others suggested, I put the shredded meat back in the crockpot for the last hour or so. Served on lettuce wraps with a bit of bleu cheese dressing. Delish! For the kids, I served on buns with provolone. I used a 12 oz bottle of sauce and the whole packet of ranch and it wasn't terribly salty - probably depends on the type of sauce you choose.

Chicken was great...we had it on a bun and used the left overs the next day in a flour tortilla...needless to say that was much better.

This was wonderful! My husband and I BOTH love it, which is pretty unusual in our house. Now that I've discovered crock pot liners, this recipe and clean-up couldn't be easier. This will be a staple in our house.

HUGE HIT!  I crowd sized this recipe for a group of mainly guys and it was raved about!  I used a 10lb bag of Costco chicken breasts (boneless & skinless) 2 - 12oz bottles Frank's Wings Sauce, 2 - 1oz pkgs of powdered Ranch dressing and 2 sticks of butter.  Because of the size I split the frozen breasts evenly between 2 large crockpots and put half all the ingredients in each on High for 4 hours.  I took out the breasts, skimmed the fat off the sauce and shredded the meat with forks.  I then returned it ALL to one large crock pot.  I served it on buns with extra sauce and coleslaw to put on the sandwich - amazing!  For coleslaw I used 3 - 16oz pks chopped cabbage and 1 - 25oz jar Marie's Coleslaw dressing...it was a perfect topping!

I have used this many times for potlucks and people always rave about it.  The best thing is that you can basically add whatever sauce you like.  I have done the buffalo (as written) as well as a barbeque and both were great.  Another thing - SO EASY!

If you like Buffalo foods like I do you will love this!! So easy to make. I made recipe exactly as written. I did spread some blue cheese dressing on the roll - that was the only thing I did different to the recipe. Tasted so good!! I can't say enough good things about this.

Buffalo Chicken doesn't get much easier than this.  I put the ingredients in the crockpot before going to bed and we enjoyed the sandwiches for lunch the next day.  The meat was so tender and was loaded with flavor.  I was worried that they would be too runny to eat with the liquid in the bottom of the crockpot, but once I shredded the meat, it all disappeared.  I served these on shooter size buns and added bleu cheese crumbles to some of the sandwiches.  Thanks Divinesolace21 for sharing this recipe.  This would make a great sandwich for SuperBowl parties.

This is one of the best dishes I have ever made.  My husband requests this several times a month, and his friends have told their wives how to find the recipe after having it at my home, because it is just so good!  I put all ingredients (except the rolls of course!) into the slow cooker for 5-6 hours, shred the chicken, and then put it in for another hour.  I serve it on toasted rolls with a splash of wing sauce on it and sometimes a little blue cheese or even shredded cheddar.  Delish!

I made mine super spicy for my lunches for this week!  To cut back on the fat, I did not add the butter.  I used a 12oz. bottle of hot buffalo wing sauce, since that is all I had on hand.  Through this in my little 2qt. slow cooker and let her cook all day.  :D

This was awesome, however I did not follow it I just used it as inspiration this was my take on it and my husband LOVED IT!: 

-I used chicken thighs instead of breast (as breast is typically too dry)
-I used one 350ml jar of buffalo wing sauce and then 1 jar of sweet onion chipotle sauce to add some depth of flavour
-I added half a large onion (rough chopped)
-I also added a few bacon slices, diced, for flavour

I cooked on high for 6 hours and it was awesome!

Tender and spicy and just right for rolls.  I used Tony Roma's wing sauce which comes in a 17.5 oz bottle.  I used only about 1/3-1/2 of the bottle as it is really spicy for my taste and then added about 1/2 a cup of water or so to ensure enough liquid.  I used 1/2 a package of Uncle Dan's ranch dressing mix.  I've said this before but I think it is worth repeating....please, if a sauce or mix is being used, specifiy the brand that you are using.  We all have to make do with what we can get in our area, however, changing the brand can really change the character of the dish and I would like to try recipes for the first time with what the original recipe contributor suggests.

My husband said he liked the level of spice, but it was too hot for me to finish one sandwich.  I like a medium level of spice, but this recipe was more than I could handle.  He also noticed the saltiness that others mentioned.  I used Louisiana brand Wing Sauce.  I probably won't make it again since I can't handle it, but it's an easy recipe for those who like it hot.

This was amazing!!! Definitely one of my favorites. I am a sucker for Charlies buffalo chicken sandwhich, so when I saw this recipe I was very excited to try it. I too used Franks wing sauce. I added 1 12oz bottle Franks wing sauce, 1 package hidden valley dry ranch mix into the crockpot and mixed. I then added 6 frozen chicken breasts. Cooked on high for 2 hours and turned the chicken breasts over. Cooked on low for another 4 hours. When the chicken was done I removed the chicken from the liquid and shredded with the 2 tbsp of butter. I then added the desired amount of sauce left over in the pot to the shredded chicken. Served on a hamburger bun with swiss cheese and ranch dressing. It would have been yummy with lettuce and tomato too.

Very tender chicken--it fell apart when I shredded it. Good amount of heat for us, but oh man was it salty. I used Frank's Red Hot original with 1 Tbs. butter. I would love to make this again but would use some other type of sauce. I don't know if those who gave this 5 stars used a particular sauce, but I think I might try a more bbq-like sauce next time as straight-up Frank's was just way too salty. 
Served on hamburger buns with leftover Texas Caviar II from AR.

Very good and super easy.  Definitely will be making again.  I didn't use the full amount of wing sauce, and I also added chicking broth.  Also, about an hour before being done, I shredded then chicken, returned to the crock pot, and let cook for another hour.  To make it a little more low cal, I used whole grain wraps instead of hoagie rolls.  Pretty good!

Delicious and so easy!  I used the whole package of ranch mix and a smaller bottle of wing sauce than what the recipe called for (It's what I had- I think it was maybe 12 oz).  I used Franks hot wing sauce and will definitley do it all again the same way.  We liked it best with provolone cheese and ranch dressing.  Soooooo good.  I don't think you can go wrong with this one.

I was in the mood for some buffalo chicken, but not wings. This was great! Both my husband and I really enjoyed it. I did 3 boneless chicken breasts, then a few boneless thighs (I tried to make sure the weight of the thighs was equal to 1 breast). I didn't have any problems with the hot sauce absorbing, though I did do it on high for a few hours vs 6-7 hours on low. I noticed the recipe calls for a 17.5 oz bottle of hot sauce and my Franks is only 12 oz, so I used the whole bottle in the crockpot and then a little bit more from another. We didn't even add the extra hot sauce at the end, we thought it was perfect as is. Oh and I did use the whole package of ranch mix. We'll keep making this! It was great with some provolone on the rolls. I thought the leftover chicken was really good on a salad too

Made using frozen breasts, frank's and 1/2 ounce Hellman's buttermilk dressing mix. Thanks! Edited: Made again with frank's and ranch dressing mix in the spice isle.

Made this last night for friends and it was devoured! I used the whole packet of ranch mix and most of the sauce. To server, I gave options of blue cheese crumbles, ranch dressing, and sauteed peppers/onions. I served it with homemade coleslaw...AMAZING! Especially with the blue cheese and peppers/onions!

This was very good and easy. I used 3/4 of a bottle of Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce and about 3/4 of a packet of ranch mix with three large chicken breasts. I left on high for about 4 hours, then shredded and added the rest of the wing sauce. It WAS spicy but in a good way. When I put the chicken on the hoagies, I added a bit of shredded monterey jack cheese and let it melt a little bit before serving. Only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is that while it was good, it wasn't anything super special. Definitely a keeper though!

Fun and Easy Breezy!  My son thought this was 2-thumps-up.  He tries to impress me with his mad eating skills (he's 8) of how much "spicyness" he can consume.  Yow-za!  It was spicy but you can really make this as spicy or unspicy as you like.  I liked the one readers advice about making it was pizza sause.  I told my dauter (who does not like spicy food and thinks black pepper is spicy...how awful is that) we'd make it with pizza sauce.  Her eyes lit up!  Honestly, you could do this with almost any sause base.  But I loved this!  I used the blue cheese and oh so yum!  This is deffinately a keeper IMO!

Very good balance of flavors.  A potato masher makes easy work of "shredding" the chicken.

My husband and I love this... it's made for every tailgating event, or when friends get together. It's definitely a crowd pleaser!  Recently though, I took the time to compare the ingredients in the buffalo sauce vs the hot sauce, and the only thing different is paprika, garlic, and butter flavor is added to the buffalo sauce. I obviously have no clue how much of each is added, but I'm going to give it a shot as the hot sauce it cheaper. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious.  Used Frank's buffalo wing sauce and at the 5 hour mark when I shredded the chicken I also added in some Frank's RedHot - Xtra Hot Sauce to give it a bit more kick.  Placed buns on a pan and sprinkled shredded nacho cheese on them and broiled them for ~1 minute to get the cheese nice and melted.

Makes amazing pizza the next day.  Used 3 cheese ranch dressing as the sauce with red onion, roasted garlic, and mushrooms.

Yum! This turned out terrific. I used "medium" heat wing sauce so that it wasn't too hot fo everyone. (My husband would have been happier with more heat.) Blue cheese dressing drizzled on top of the meat was the perfect touch.

This is so good! We forgot to add the ranch and the butter and still loved it! Next time we will add the ranch & butter - I would imagine it's even better that way! The chicken was so tender and good! And this can't get any easier! It is hot but not too hot. I am wondering if the people that say it's too hot are using hot sauce and not buffalo sauce. I would think that would make a difference but I'm not sure. We had ours on buns with cheese and ranch dressing. These are spicey but good! PERFECT football recipe! Thanks!

WOW! I followed this recipe exactly and I really wanted to give it a 5 but I simply cannot. I am blaming it on the brand of wing sauce I used I guess. We like spicy but this was just too much for us. It has all the things we like but we couldn't get past the heat and honestly that is all we could taste. I used Louisana brand wing sauce because that is all my store had at the time. I'm thinking Frank's or Hooters would be more tolerable? I'll likely make again because we love the buffalo flavor but I'll definitely try a different brand of sauce next time or else cut back on the heat.

Wow! Not only is this amazingly easy, it tastes great too! I made about half the recipe and found it did not take even 6 hours to cook on low. Glad I was watching or it would have dried out a bit. Next time, I'll add a little blue cheese dressing at the last minute

Used 6 frozen boneless chicken breasts and was done after 6 hours on low.  Used the "Dry Ranch Style Seasoning Mix" from this site. (1 tsp parsley, 3/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp garlic salt, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/8 tsp thyme).  Used two cups of Frank's Red Hot Sauce.

This was Yummy! Everybody loved it! I was afraid to make it after some of the negative reviews, but I'm glad I did. I took about 6 chicken breast and put some chicken broth inside the slow cooker and cooked that for about two and a half hours on high. Then I drained the broth, shredded the chicken, and threw in the salad dressing mix, and a 12 fl oz bottle of the Frank's Buffalo Sauce (they didn't have the big one at the store) and mixed everything together. I cooked for another 30 minutes and it turned out perfect. I think the key is to add the sauce during the end of cooking so it doesn't dry out. I even forgot the butter! I served it with slider buns with ranch dressing, and some chopped celery for a nice crunch.

I'm a big fan of buffalo anything but for me this recipe was not really edible. I accidentally used the entire packet of ranch dressing mix, but it didn't really matter because I couldn't really taste it anyways. Eating these sandwiches with some American cheese and ranch seems to have the same effect as drinking buffalo sauce straight from the bottle with a straw. I think the amount of sauce that is put into this recipe needs to be reduced significantly, but I’m not sure if I’ll be willing to try again.

YUM!  Took care of my buffalo chicken craving!  I used 1 large breast for  my husband and I and there was still plenty for another sandwich!  Be sure you strain the meat as it's coming out otherwise it's a soppy mess on your bread!  I didn't do that & so just ended up eating my meat with a fork off the bun & dipped it into extra ranch that I had on my plate.  Thanks for posting, this was incredible!

Super sandwiches for a Super Bowl!  I made these exactly as written, except I added 12 oz wing sauce to 5 boneless half breasts, perfect!  I just used the reserved broth in the crock to moisten after shredding.  The chicken was so moist and tender, and the added butter makes them melt in your mouth.  A great recipe for a crowd.  Loved this recipe, and will use many more times!  Thanks for a terrific submission.

This was really easy, but I just thought it was average - basically tastes like the generic buffalo wings you get in a bar, minus the bones.  Might be a good method, with a good barbecue sauce for a shredded barbecue chicken sandwich.  Otherwise, I suggest using it as a dip with some cheese, black olives, etc. with tortilla chips.

A pretty good recipe for the slow cooker which will not disappoint anyone. I found the stew's sauce a little too runny. Make sure you're not wearing your Sunday best because this can be very messy to eat. If possible, make this a day ahead. The overnight sit improves the flavour and helps the sauce thicken.Thanks for the recipe I will probably make it again.

Simple, easy, short ingredient list and very tasty!  I will definitely make this again "as is" and will also try a few variations when we want a different texture (like some cream cheese in it, possibly some jalapenos, etc.).  Thanks for sharing!

Good sandwich, don't overcook like I did, chicken had a mushy texture. Looking forward to making again to get that "stringy" texture like pulled pork-topped with blue cheese dressing-great flavor

After reading all of the reviews about the saltyness, I went to the store to buy the hotsauce and was shocked to see the amount of sodium. I found Crystals Wing Sauce and it had about half of what the other brands had.  This was a big hit and not to salty at all.  I diced up some celery and mixed it with ranch dressing as a topping for the chicken and it gave it the perfect texture.  Make sure to shread the chicken about an hour before serving to give it time to soak up all the juice. YUM

This is great. I wanted something to be done when we all got home from work, school etc.... I put it on in the morning an out the door. I didn’t use the ranch package or the butter (my choice)  Cooked the chicken in Red Hot sauce and a little chicken broth. Came home shredded the chicken. Toasted some buns filled with chicken meat and topped it with x-tra sauce & home made blue cheese dressing. Its more of a dip cause it is pretty think. My boyfriend and girls that are the worlds biggest (I’m not trying that teenagers I have ever seen) LOVED IT!!! ask for seconds. Then wanted to know if they could take leftover to work & the other one wanted to take it to school. Thanks for sharing. We will be having this often. Not to leave out the fact that it better for you than chicken wings and still the great flavors! Serve it with a small salad with blue cheese dressing for a complete meal!  This should get a 10....

Very Yummy and easy!  However be careful when buying your sauce. As others I used the Franks Red Hot Wing Sauce.  Do not confuse this with the regular Franks Red Hot otherwise your dish will be super hot!  The bottle must say Franks Red Hot Wing Sauce and it has plenty of kick on its own.  Topping your sandwiches with blue cheese dressing or blue cheese crumbles is delicious and its cuts the heat.

Very Good!  Spicy and tender.  I used Frank's Red Hot. It was juicy so I used a slotted spoon to serve so the bun wouldnt get soggy.  My girls and husband loved it.  I plan on making pizza with the leftover chicken.

Most excellent. Very easy. I used boneless chicken thighs, because that's what I had on hand. Also, I mistakenly used a full packet of Ranch dressing and my bottle of hot wing sauce was only 12.5 oz. But I won't change a thing next time. It was perfect. This is destined to become a family football season favorite.

This was just ok for my family. Too salty for us.  Though it was quick there is nothing really special about it.   We preferred the Zesty Slow Cooker Barbecue much better.  Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe! Served it with sour cream, shredded lettuce, and shredded cheese to top off hoagies ... yum! Even my picky 10 yr old said he'd eat this again! Great dish for the summer time ... no need to heat the whole house for dinner!

This was really good. I followed the recipe exactly, but I poured some more wing sauce in the chicken after I drained all the sauce I had cooked it in. It was so tender and we just loved it. This is prepared in the same way as the Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken Barbecue on this site, which we absolutely love too.

These were really good & I thought it was a great idea for buffalo chicken. My only complaints were that it was a little too wet than I would've liked, but that may have been my fault for not following the instructions completely..I put everything in the slow cooker all at once! Also, it was a little too spicy for my husband's and my taste...used "mild" wing sauce, but it was too hot and was burning the whole way down!! Next time I may try to make my own wing sauce so I can control the heat. And will definitely only put in half the amount of sauce in the beginning as stated in the recipe.

Excellent! Everyone loved this one and asked for the recipe.  The only edits I made were to add 1/4 C cream cheese, and a handfull of cheddar cheese to the sauce.

Super easy & really tasty. Turned out like Sloppy Buffaloes or Pulled Chicken, moist and delicious.  Substitutions: 1/4 pkt of dry ranch, about 1/2 cup blue cheese dressing plus I rinsed buffalo sauce bottle with water and added that water to mix.  About 1c. water total and I think that was key.  Chicken was fresh, not frozen so 4 hrs. on low was perfect.  Pulled apart with 2 forks and it fell apart. Cont'd on low for another 30 min.  Good stuff!  Make double and freeze remainder or leftovers can be made into  Buffalo Nachos, Enchiladas or baked into a Buffalo Chicken Dip by adding some cream cheese.

This was amazing!!! We don't love the "wing" part of buffalo wings but we do love the flavor. So the chicken breasts were perfect. This was so tangy and flavorfull! I would reccomend shreading the chicken breast about an hour prior to serving it, and then returning it to the slow cooker. It soaks up all of the jucies that way. We had blue cheese salad on the side. Awesome!

These were quickly devoured by my family, which is always a good sign, plus they asked me to make it again!  I served it with mozzarella cheese on it, and ranch dressing to dip it in.  It was kind of messy, but no one seemed to mind!

Really easy recipe to follow with just a few ingredients. The only think I added was a 1/2 cup of chicken stock. I used Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce and it was somewhat spicy. That was OK since we all like spicy. If you don't like spicy just look for a mild Buffalo Wing Sauce. I cooked it at a low setting for 3.5 hours shredded it and returned it to the crock pot and let it simmer in the juices. I simply shredded the chicken breasts with a knife and fork. A few reviewers commented their chicken breasts were dry but just make sure you cook it on low, and there is enough sauce too. My buffalo chicken did not come out dry at all Another reviewer compared the shredded chicken to tuna. It sounds like they used a processor to shred the chicken. Simply use a knife and fork and it will not shred like tuna! My whole family loves this recipe and asks for it over and over again!

Loved it! This is so easy and delicious! I used the remainder of the ranch mix and mixed it with half a cup mayo and half a cup milk to make a small bowl of ranch dressing. I served the chicken with the ranch dressing and a little of the buffalo sauce on sweet rolls. My family loved it!

Didn't need as much sauce...I only used 10 oz and it was perfect! I also added the whole packet of ranch for more flavor...family devoured it!! And we were all excited for leftovers :) FYI....there's a huge difference between hot sauce and wing sauce! Lol

Awesome. I used a smaller (12 oz.?) bottle of buffalo sauce; that was plenty for us. I also omitted the butter to save on fat & calories. Still turned out fantastic.

I used thigh and breast meat and Frank's red hot.  It was waaay
 to salty for me.  I even used cheese on the sandwich to tone it down.  I am upset with myself for doubling the recipe.

Fabulous!  Easy!  I used a whole bottle of wing sauce (17.5 oz.) and entire package of dry ranch dressing mix, 4 boneless chicken breasts, 3 Tbsp. butter. Just dump it all in the crock and forget about it for 7 hours. I shredded and put back in the crock as someone else suggested, leaving it there for another hour.  Perfect for game day!

Very good, very hot.  Adding more butter to leftovers in hopes of toning it down a little.  Next time may try a little cream cheese as suggested by another reviewer.  Really easy recipe.

This is very good, BUT so so spicy. Used 4 breasts and only 12 oz Franks, added extra butter and little cream cheese but still spicy. Done in 4 hrs, 6-7 would be overdone. Use 1oz Ranch mix. Next time will probably add little chic broth, less Frank. Can always add more spice at end if needed.

Wow!  This is exactly what I've been craving!  This recipe couldn't be easier, either.  I actually cooked a large package of chicken breasts for about 4 hours on low in my crockpot.  I tok half the chicen out for a different recipe and shredded the other half of the chicken.  I put this chicken back in the crockpot on warm with the butter, wing sauce, and ranch mix for two hours.  This was sooo good!  I think I could grab a fork and eat the whole mixture straight from the crockpot!  Next time I'll double it!

Made it  yesterday. I used 3 large chicken breast halves and it was plenty! 5 sandwiches, someone ate half of a breast as is, plus some leftovers! I also used the whole packet of ranch mix (why save a half of packet?) And threw the butter and sprinkled some celery seed in with it all. I shredded the chicken when done, put it back in the sauce and let it stay warm while I cooked fries. Also Served with dill pickle spears and coleslaw-which cools some of the bite...but we like spicy here. As I write I have chicken wing dip in the oven which I used the leftovers! Will certainly make again.

So easy!  The taste is obviously very dependent on the wing sauce that you use.  I'm looking forward to experimenting with different styles and brands of sauce.

I don't know what happened here for me...for me when I made this recipe I thought how did so many people give this 5 stars...what went wrong.  I love buffalo chicken wing dip and I guess I thought this would be up that same alley, but it just wasn't:(

I have two problems with this recipe.  First the amount of buffalo wing sauce is way too much IMO.  After shredding the chicken I poured off the liquid and added some back to the chicken, but probably only used about half of it.  Had I used the entire amount, this would have been way too wet.  I also thought the cooking time was way too long, at least for my slow cooker.  My chicken was perfectly done in 4 hours on low.  We weren’t huge fans of this.  Maybe we’re just not buffalo wing fans.  But that is no fault of the recipe.  Four stars for the amount of sauce and cooking time.  I used this to make Buffalo Chicken and Ranch Wraps, also on this site.

I agree with other reviewers that the cooking time should be cut, probably 4-5 hrs would be plenty.  And it was dry, needed darker meat or something to help it out.  It is super easy, though, and my kids ate it, so that's always a plus.

We really liked this a lot.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and cooked them for about 6 hours on low.  I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch slurry at the end of the cook time.  It tastes good without the butter, but adding the butter gives the sauce a nice silky texture.

This is my addiction! I've made this multiple times and I have doubled/tripled this recipe it's so good. The only thing I change is I add 1/2-1cup chicken broth in the beginning start with less you can always add more. I think if I used dark meat I could get away with not adding the broth I haven't tried it yet but I plan to.

This recipe was great. I love how spicy it is, but my kids don't like it quite so hot. I did what someone else suggested...I added 1  pack of cream cheese to the crock pot and that cut it back just enough for them. I topped the sandwiches off with provolone cheese, baby spinach and ranch dressing. For my husband's and my sandwich, we just added a dash more of franks sauce. This was a huge hit!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was a huge hit.  I was short on time so cooked it in a big frying pan with a lid and it turned out great! I had only glanced at the recipe so inadvertently mixed up a couple of things - I cooked the chicken in the butter and ranch mix and then added the bottle of hot sauce.  Simmered on low for about an hour and then shredded the chicken. We made it into wraps with cheese, tomato and lettuce.  The tomato helped cut the heat of it for the wimpier member of our family (me).  I had the hot sauce sweats for about an hour after but that just added to the greatness of it.  I've already decided to use some of the leftovers in the morning with a poached egg, diced tomato and lettuce on a corn tortilla.

Very good!  After several dried out chicken experiences, I have figured out my crockpot cooks faster than others.  Aside from shortening the cooking time, I followed it exactly.  We served it with lettuce and blue cheese and it was excellent!  Thanks for the reicpe!

Let me just say I am an amateur cook. I dont usually know what I'm doing but manage to pull things off and 5 stars was NOT enough for this. it was so good. I tweeked things a bit. We used boneless thighs, 3 tablespoons of butter, 1 bottle of texas pete buffalo sauce the hidden valley ranch mix, and I added a cup of water. I mixed all ingredients in the crock pot and cooked it all stirring occasionally for about 7 hrs. The chicken was shredded on its own by that time. put it on soft sesame hoagie buns with a splash of buffalo sauce and ranch it was so delicious! However you tweek it, I'm sure it will be delicious! Good luck!

My family loved this chicken one Saturday afternoon, we made it as the recipe was written and added some ranch dressing on top as a sandwich dressing.  I think this is an ideal game day staple for the football game parties.  Along with this we made some homemade steak fries.  Wonderfully easy and delicious!

this recipe was SOOOOOOOOOOO SPICY it made me sick.  I made this almost 6 months ago and I still can't stand the taste of buffalo wing sauce.  I think it would have been quite good if I'd only put in 1 bottle of wing sauce! 
I will NEVER make this recipe again!

This was great, my husband and I loved it! I forgot to add the butter, but neither of us thought it mattered, since we added extra buffalo sauce before eating. I served this with Bleu cheese coleslaw on top, using pre-cut slaw mix and bleu cheese dressing from a bottle. So easy and it really made the sandwiches amazing!

SO delicious! I was pressed for time and had to cook my chicken on high for 3 hours, rather than low and slow. Still, the chicken was flavorful, moist and absolutely delicious. This is a GREAT recipe that will be a regular part of my rotation. :)

So delicious!! I left out the step with the butter to make it a bit healthier and I didnt feel like I was missing anything! I placed the chicken back in the crockpot for about 30 mins after shredding to re-absorb some of the sauce, rather than using the rest in the bottle (so much sauce in the pot I felt like it would be a waste!) I also made a topping for the sandwiches - I mixed ranch dressing, blue cheese crumbles, and diced celery, and it was AMAZING on top of the sandwiches!  Definitely messy but so worth it and my husband can't wait for me to make this again!

Giving this 5 stars on my husband's behalf.  This recipe is super easy to make and is very flexible on amounts and ingredients - I just threw two chicken breasts, dumped enough hot sauce in so it was almost covering the chicken (probably 1 - 1 1/2 cups), threw in 1-2 T of butter (I added the butter at the beginning) and a little ranch dressing (the liquid dressing, since I didn't have any packets on hand), and turned on the machine.  I cooked it on high for a couple of hours, shredded the chicken with two forks, and cooked it on low for a couple more hours, although it probably could have been done sooner.  I've made this a few times and knew that I didn't want leftover liquid, so I added some corn starch for the last hour or so to thicken everything up.  Great served on buns with blue cheese crumbles or ranch dressing, with carrot sticks or celery on the side.  My husband's favorite!

This is probably the saltiest thing I've ever eaten in my life. It's very close to being inedible. I think I had a stroke just looking at the nutrition facts on this one. I also think I drank about a gallon of water after eating this. In theory it seems great but in reality, not so much.

On my regular rotation. Often make wraps with w/w tortillas, lined with a large leaf of lettuce, topped with meat, then a sprinkle of carrot/celery matchsticks on top.

This recipe gets 5 stars not because it's the most gourmet recipe ever, but because it is one of the tastiest and easiest recipes I've tried.  To throw this together in the crockpot in the morning  takes 5 minutes.  By dinner time, you have a great sandwich that my family absolutely loves!!!  I use sweet baby rays wing sauce and add shredded lettuce on top to give it a bit of crunch.  It goes great with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing...how easy is that?  Perfect weeknight meal!

My husband and I love this, but it was a little too hot for my son.  So if I was to make this for a large group I would put in less buffalo sauce so everyone could enjoy.  For people who like spicy food, it was perfect as is.

Really, really, REALLY GOOD! This is our favorite NFL Sunday meal - served on mini toasted kaiser rolls with sides of celery and carrots, they make the perfect finger food combo.

Nothing more to say that others haven't already said. Delicious recipe that takes little to no preparation. Frank's Buffalo Wing Sauce is delicious. The step for adding sauce after you take it out of the slow cooker is important. It really adds to the flavor of the sandwich.

This was pretty good! My boyfriend realy loved it! We used Sweet Baby Rays Buffalo sauce, and it was pretty spicey (and we love spicey!) but it was alittle TOO spicey...ahhh wheres my burts bees!?!?! I think next time we will try it with Hooters Sauce which I know is available at Walmart so hopefully it wont be as intense. I pre-shredded the chicken at the 4 hr mark into cooking so that all the chicken was nice and coated and marinated not just the outter parts and let it cook anouther hr. It was perfectly juicy. Also, we did this on tortillas with lettuce and fresh blue cheese crumbles! DELISH!

These were okay.  Lot of vinegar flavor (duh, I know) but I feel like it needed something else to cut it and it would be delicious.  Maybe cream cheese?  I'm not sure, they were good and super easy so I will fiddle with them a bit more.

This was very good and very easy.  I used 8 breast and 1 bottle hot wing sauce, I also added 5 oz cream cheese after I shredded the chicken.   I am going to use left overs today for ching wing pizza.  I will use this recipe again.

This is a great 2 dish meal. I slowed cooked the chicken in chicken  broth and when ready to shred I left just a touch of broth in the bottom and then added the buffalo sauce and ranch. I also added just a touch of white sugar to help tone down the tang in the sauce. (I was careful not to add too much sugar so I wouldn't end up with a confused dish) We ate these with maple flavored baked beans and slaw. I then used the leftovers to make a ranch & buffalo chicken pizza. I sauteed sweet onions and added bacon and used colby jack cheese. So good! Everybody loved both recipes!

delicious. Everyone loved this and my  hubby is a huge buffalo wing fan. I used 20oz of Franks wing sauce, 4 monster chicken breasts, 1 package of ranch seasoning and 2T butter. Served on rolls with blue cheese but will be using the leftovers to make buffalo chicken pizza.

I love spicy and I love buffalo sauce but these totally missed the mark. I'm not sure how it could go wrong but it did. Niether my husband nor I finished our sandwiches and I threw out the left overs. I won't make these again.

Didn't have a lot of kick because I toned it down--not a whole bottle of sauce. Good, tho. Used regular ranch dressing, not dry.

This recipe was good, not great.  The second time I made it, I skipped the ranch mix to cut the salt.  I added blue cheese to the sandwich.

Wow.  This recipe definitely answers my craving for buffalo chicken.  I had cooked some chicken breasts in the crock pot and was undecided as to what to do with them when I came across this recipe. Since me chicken was already cooked, I shredded it and mixed together Frank's Wing Sauce with some bottled ranch dressing.  I poured it over the chicken and put back in the fridge for a few hours.  When it was time to eat, I simply reheated it and served on fresh ciabatta rolls.  What's nice about this recipe is that you can calm it down a bit by adding more ranch,for those who can't tolerate the heat.  Definitely a keeper!

This was delicious! I used 2 lbs of boneless chicken thighs and seasoned them well with salt, pepper, onion powder and paprika. The guys ate every bite of it - huge hit with them. I didn't add the butter since I used the thighs and next time I'll try it with the breasts to keep it a bit healthier. Really good, will certainly make this many times because it's so very easy.

This could be better but I think the whole point of this recipe is the simpleness.  I would change it up:
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
coarse salt and ground pepper
1 pound boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces
1 package frozen seasoning blend - onion, celery, peppers, etc.
3 garlic cloves
1 can (28 oz) diced tomatoes
1/4 cup franks hot wing sauce
3 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoon yellow mustard
1 tablespoon honey

Easy & delicious! I use frozen/semi-frozen chicken breasts and cook on low for 8-9 hours; chicken is tender (no need for extra butter). Can't believe how easy this is!

This is an excellent recipe for chicken. Very easy and the chicken comes out incredibly tender. My only complaint is that it is a bit too spicy, so next time I will definitely tone it down with some ranch dressing.

This recipe is amazing. My husband loves buffalo chicken and this is one of his favorite meals. I am not such a huge fan of buffalo normally, but I was a huge fan of this one as well. I used about 2.5 times the amount of chicken the recipe calls for, and used about 2x the sauce. I don't find that I have a problem with the sauce evaporating like another review said, so there was still plenty of sauce. Made this for a party on mini sliders and it was a huge hit!

My family loves this!  We add a little chicken broth and brown sugar when cooking.  We put it on broiled french bread with swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado and blue cheese dressing.  Also good on salad.

This was excellent - this was what I would consider medium spicy like at buffalo wild wings or chili's boneless wings - way yummy way easy.  I put 1 TBSP butter in at end - kind of wish I didn't - don't know what it really added.  next time will omit.  I chopped up celery for another topping for the sandwich - I ate mine with no bun.

I've continued to make this w/o the butter - it is so delicious. If you have the craving for buffalo chicken which I always do.

These are great.  We make these at least 2x a month here.  I add a splash of white vinegar to the crockpot before cooking.  Great leftovers too - we use it for wraps, on salads, buffalo chicken dip, etc.

This recipe is fantastic and incredibly easy.  A must try if you really enjoy buffalo chicken recipes.  Only complaint is that if your chicken to sauce ratio is a little off, the chicken can taste very salty at the end.

Five stars with these changes:  I used Costco brand chicken breasts--straight from the freezer, with 3/4 bottle wing sauce and package ranch.  Cooked 7 hours on low--shredded chicken and returned to the crock for another hour.  So juicy and tender--no butter required.  Served on Kaiser rolls with colby jack cheese and a dollop of bleu cheese dressing--a must.  Delish!

I loved it, but I added the butter before tasting it first and I wish I hadn't. I didn't have any dry ranch mix on hand, so instead I used a giant squirt of regular bottled ranch. I think it worked well.

This was a great meal.  I will definitely make this one again!  It cooked longer than expected because I worked late so the chicken melted in your mouth.  My husband loved it.  He loves hot/spicy foods.  My children even liked it.  The only change I made was that I put in the whole package of ranch mix instead of half.  I liked ranch dressing on it to cut down "the spicy" a bit.  I did the same for my kids.  My husband said he would have liked to have the blue cheese or any kind of cheese on it next time.  I will try it next time.  Leftovers were just as great!

Followed recipe exactly, turned out great however a tad too spicy for most people.  My suggestion, go easy on the hot sauce and let people put their own on when you serve the sandwiches.  Otherwise, worked out great, as Buffalo Chicken sliders.

This is great made as a wrap too or on a bed of shredded lettuce.  I used the dry ranch dressing mix from this site, slightly modified (add 1 tsp dill and 1/2 cup dry buttermilk powder then use 2-3 Tbs. of the resulting mix) - it's gluten free and works well, and Frank's Original Hot Sauce.  With the left overs (just hubby and I were eating) I made a chicken tortilla soup adding 1 chopped onion, 1-2 cloves garlic, 1 pint tomatoes, 2 cups whole kernel corn, 2 cups chicken broth, a pinch of oregano , about 1/4 cup chopped cilantro and juice of one lime (or lemon).  Serve over tortilla chips/strips with shredded cheese.  Top with more cilantro and some chopped avacado.  Pretty and delicious.  Can also add black beans.  So you can get several dinners from this start!

Pretty good but not quite as good as I was hoping the would be. I think I personally would have enjoyed them more with a bit of tomato and lettuce on them and maybe topped with a bit of ranch. The were kinda dry. I think I would do these again but only for my husband and myself as the kids thought that they were to spicy.

My husband loved it, I thought it was good.  My kids not so much but then again they are picky, it was a lil spicy for them and I used very mild buffalo chicken sauce made by red hot.  I will def make it again for me and my husband but maybe make something different for the kids. :)

This recipe was incredibly easy and delicious!  I added onions and green peppers, and cooked 3 hours on high.  Will make again very soon.

WOW, this was really spicy and quite tasty. I used Texas Pete's Buffalo Wing Sauce and it turned out far spicier than I ever could have anticipated.  I couldn't even consider adding more hot sauce to it once I put it on the roll. My favorite part was testing it along the way, I was full by the time it was time to sit down and eat!  I definitely want to make a batch of this for a BBQ buffet....leave it in the crockpot and put out a basket of nice soft rolls.  Super easy, and spicy fans will love it.

This was fantastic!!! Used 12 oz jar of frank's buffalo wing sauce and whole packet of ranch. Topped with my own lite blue cheese dressing (recipe from betty crocker) cooked 5 hours, shredded and left for 90 more minutes. Perfect consistency.

This is finger licking good!!! We used the herbs and sesonings that are tyipically found in ranch dressing and then added mayo to the finished product to cut down on the heat.  We can eat this stuff for breakfast or at one in the morning hot or cold!!!  It does not have to be football season for this stuff.

made this for the nfc championship game.  All loved this. Here are the changes I made.  I used one full bag 3 lbs of chicken breasts, 1- 12oz buffalo sauce and 1 package of ranch dressing.  I cooked on high for 4 hours, pulled out and shredded, added it back to sauce and put on low.  Served on Panera Ciabatta and topped with ranch dressing YUMMY!!!!  Would have given it 5 stars, but I really made this for others I am not a huge fan of buffalo chicken. Super easy and everyone else just loved it . . .

This was great but I did make a few tweaks/additions that came out great. I did half breast meat half boneless skinless thigh meat to add flavor and tenderness. I also used Franks Red hot for the sauce. I toasted the rolls with crumbled blue cheese to melt a little, then piled on the shredded chicken. I also added some diced fresh crisp celery on top. It literally tasted like the best buffalo wings ever on a sandwich with the celery and blue cheese added in! Flavor explosion!

Pretty good. Added about 1/2 of the ranch dressing mix package to give it some more flavor.  The butter wasn't needed. Great with a lil' bleu cheese dressing and lettuce on the sandwich. Yum. Will be making again. I used Frank's buffalo sauce.

I made these sandwiches for a party and served them with bleu cheese dressing and crumbled bleu cheese on top.  The only change I made each time thereafter was that I  used both breasts and thighs for more flavor and texture.

I made about a triple batch of this for a holiday potluck at my office. It was a nice change of pace from the traditional potluck items (meatballs, chili, etc). It didn't receive any specific rave reviews, but a good portion of it was eaten, so I'll take that as a compliment. It stayed moist after several hours (well above the recommended cook time). I think it was due to my packing my slowcooker to the brim with chicken. On the whole, a pretty easy recipe. Just make sure to serve it with a really good quality kaiser roll...makes all the difference.

My husband loved this. I thought it was pretty good. I used Texas Pete wing sauce and I think that was my problem. (I don't really like Texas Pete, my man loves it) I forgot to add in the butter, but it tasted fine without it.

This was incredibly easy and tasted awesome.  The only thing I'll say is shred your chicken after a bit and then keep cooking so the flavor really incorporates and the butter is in no way neccessary.  It just adds extra calories without adding flavor.

wow, I found these to be WAAAAAY spicy, and I like my food on the spicy side. I did put a small amount on a Trisket added a big slice of cheddar cheese and popped them into the toster oven long enough to melt the cheese and ate it that way.

Really good! I modified a little for the amount of food I needed. I still used only one bottle of sauce. I put eight frozen breasts into the pot along with 2/3 bottle of sauce, garlic, and onion. I then added 2 cups of chicken broth so that all the chicken was covered. Cooked this on low for 7 hours adding the ranch packet with 2 hours left. We also served ours on toasted buns with blue cheese dressing. So simple and so good! Keeper for sure!

This was good!  We did use Buffalo Wing sauce, and it came out just as we expected.  This would probably be good as a dip, to maybe dip with celery sticks!

Loved it! There were only two of us so I cut the recipe in half. Cooked on low for 3.5 hours and it was perfectly done. The chicken shredded flawlessly. Served in bowls instead of making sandwiches. What's great is you can alter the intensity of the buffalo sauce to your liking. This will definitely become a staple. Can't wait to try it on a sub roll!

Very easy to make.  It was good however, I was the only one in the house that ate it so I have to give it 4 stars.  I would make again but only for entertaining.  Not a very good family meal.

I LOVE buffalo chicken and buffalo chicken sandwiches.  I don't know if it was the sauce I used the ranch packet mixed.  Just didn't like it.  Maybe I'll try again with a different brand of buffalo sauce.

My absolute favorite recipe!  This is so easy I make almost once a week, just throw in 4 frozen chicken breast with 1 packet ranch and about ¾ bottle of Franks Wing Sauce.  I slow cook for about 7 to 8 hours, then it shreds super easy, no need for the butter IMO.  I serve on Kaiser rolls with sliced red onion, bleu cheese dressing & mozzarella cheese. So good!  I have also used the leftovers for the Buffalo Style Chicken Pizza recipe on this site and that’s super good also.

This was tasty but not excellent. My wife couldn't even finish hers as it was too hot for her. The chicken was tender and moist but the hot sauce really over powered everything else.

Good recipe.  Family loved this.  (I didn't see a need to slow cook chicken breasts for 6 hours...I found 4 was enough time)

For how incredibly simple it was to make this tasty dish alone, I give it 5 stars. I have to admit, I did not add the butter and the extra hot sauce at the end ONLY because I knew my guests wouldn't like it as spicy as I would. But this chicken is awesome. I will make it over and over and over again.

this is awesome!!!  i've made it several times.  the last time i used the garlic spicy kroger wing sauce and it was perfect.  i cut the butter in half but i think it does need that little bit of butter and i make my own ranch salad dressing mix, doesn't have all the nasty stuff.   top these with blue cheese coleslaw from this site and you have an awesome sandwich.   this is great for get togethers, so easy and everyone loves it.  enjoy.  and thanks for recipe. oh, i use leftovers to make buffalo chicken pizza and use mozzerella on pizza.
1/18/12. Just made it again, forgot how good this was!! So easy and always have the ingredients on hand. Husband loves this!!!

Yummy.  That pretty much sums it up!  Definitely give this one a try.  Excellent when paired with "Mom's Coleslaw" on this site.

So good and so easy! WE used three chicken breasts and about half a bottle of Franks. Cooked for 7 hours without opening the lid, the last half hour i shredded the chicken (so moist) and added a bit more franks and the butter and continued heating for a hald hour. Server on rolls with lettuce, avocado slices and ranch. MMMM, definelty the easiest slow cooker recipes ever.

This was a fabulous recipe!  My husband actually made this(and he doesn't normally cook) and we all loved it.  Even my teeny tiny stepdaughter, who normally eats light, ate two of these!  We took the advice of another review & topped the sandwiches with pepperjack cheese.  Delicious!  If I could give this recipe 10 stars I woul!!!

Easy and good. I have served this many times and everyone loves it; and it is dead simple. A great Sunday lunch, put everything in the crockpot before you head to Church and you only need to shred the meat when you get back. I put the chicken back in the crockpot after shredding and the family can eat when they wish.

We really enjoyed this recipe...super easy to make, cheap, and really tasty.  I used Franks Buffalo Wing Sauce, it was spicy but good.  Alot of other reviewers who complain of recipe being too spicy are using hot sauce vs. buffalo wing sauce.  I bet that is the problem.  Also, I used the whole 1oz. package of ranch mix, hated to waste the rest.  Glad I did, because it turned out wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

Freaking delicious.  I made 3x the recipe and had tons of leftovers, which we proceeded to put into eggs, other sandwiches, mac and cheese, and lots of other meals.  I can't recommend this enough.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but these were great.  I dumped a 2.5 pound bag of frozen chicken breasts into the crock pot and used about a bottle and a half of Frank's Wing Sauce.  Cooked on low about 7 hours.  I think the leftovers were even better when the flavors had more time to meld.  Fabulous with blue cheese!

This was very yummy!  I doubled the recipe and it turned out great.  I added a whole bottle of Franks Buffal Hot Sauce in the beginning and then once shredded I drained some of the juices and then add another 1/2 bottle.  Then about 20min. b4 serving I added the rest of the botlle.  It turned out awesome!!!  Will make again. Thx!

I added my own hot wing sauce instead of prepared hot wing sauce when I found out how much sodium was in it. Other than that, made as is, it was very good. Love those slow cooker recipes!

AMAZING and SO simple! I add some blue cheese crumbles, and then serve with a blue cheese/fat free sour cream mix on the buns. My husband can't get enough!!! I skip the butter (it doesn't need it and I don't want the calories).

My hubby thought it was too salty. I used Frank's Buffalo sauce instead of regular Frank's. Might make again if i am in a pinch and have no idea what to make. But probably not.

What a fabulous idea, especially those of us who LOVE "buffalo chicken anything" and like to use their slow cooker as often as possible!  This was a hit, altho recipe was heavily modified.  I coated the chicken breasts in the ranch salad dressing seasoning.  Then i made my homemade version of buffalo sauce which is the one with Franks RedHot, butter, garlic powder, white wine, parsley, and a dash of white pepper.  I coated the chicken with this and honestly, this dish could have been done in 3 hours.  It was in about 5.5 hrs and i had to remove because it started to burn. However, I will say it is most likely my slow cooker, it is very hot and cooks food too fastAnyway i pulled the chicken apart AND WE had it on hoagie rolls from a deli we love, and he put a few spurts of ranch on his and i used blue cheese crumbles.  I also sliced carrot sticks and celery sticks for a side instead of the usual fries, since the chicken itself looks to be heavily fattening. My husband and I both ate it all and LOVED it!  Thanks for this recipe.

Tastes just like something you'd get at a restaurant. I put the chicken in frozen so it was a bit runny. I drained it, shredded the chicken, put new sauce on it, and let it cook for another 20 minutes. SO good! We put blue cheese crumbles and ranch dressing on them and served 'em up on toasted kaiser rolls. WOW! This is a new favorite for us. SO easy!

Very good!! I followed the suggestion of using 3lbs of frozen chicken and 24 oz of buffalo sauce and putting everything in the crock pot from the start.  It worked very well.

After all the great reviews, I was really excited to try this out for a party and I have to say that I was disapointed. It wasn't bad, no one hated it, but nobody (including myself) was impressed. I followed the recipe exactly, the chicken was moist and the recipe was easy to prepare but its nothing I'll ever serve again.

I used two whole frozen chicken breasts and half a bottle of Frank's Red Hot sauce mixed that with half a package of the dry Ranch and threw it in the crockpot.  I put it on low for 8 hours (then it switches to keep warm).  When I got home I pulled the chicken out and shredded (it was a little dry) so I added the rest of the Frank's and threw it back in the pot and kept on keep warm for about 2 hours.  I absolutely loved it - just enough kick for me.  However, my boyfriend said it was way to spicy for him, so maybe next time I'll stick with half a bottle and add extra on just my sandwich.  Overall I really enjoyed it - and it was easy!

This was absolutely AWESOME! I didnt change a thing.  My husband liked it on burrito flours and I had it on Sweet Italian Bread from the Kroger Bakery.  We shredded cheddar cheese on top. Definately one of our new favorites.

Outstanding!  So easy to prepare and tasted fantastic.  I put a liitle blue cheese dressing on each roll and added lettuce to the sandwich.  Served is carrots and celery and my meal was complete. Thanks for a great recipe.

I think the type of buffalo sauce you use is key in this one.  Most people used/recommened Franks which is what I use now.  I did make the mistake once of using the Hooters brand (don't do it - it was an oily-separated mess)  I stick pretty close with the directions, only addition I make is to add a little cream cheese towards the end.  Have made this many times.

This was awesome! I used 6 large frozen chicken breasts and let them cook in about 2/3 of the sauce and a whole packet of the dry ranch for 5 hours. Then I drained most of the liquid, shredded the chicken (which fell apart perfectly) and put back in slow cooker with the rest of the sauce for 2 hours. This was soooo good! A keeper and SO EASY recipe.

This was really good and easy in the crockpot, put 3 breast in the sauce cooked on low, then shredded put back in sauce for about an hour. Toasted some buns put blue cheese dressing (we were almost out of that) would have put lots more on... served with carrots on the side.... yummy and easy!

I recently made this for a large group of hungry guys.  I was a little skeptical (it seems almost too simple!).  Needless to say, they ate two sandwiches a piece, and after I ran out, they were all begging for the recipe.  I almost wish is was harder to make so I looked better! : )  I changed it slightly--I cooked the chicken for 5 hours on low, then I shredded it and then I placed it back in the slow cooker for an hour or so just to let all the flavors penetrate the whole chicken breast.  I served it with the sauce, blue cheese, and ranch on the side and the boys went CRAZY for it!  Thanks for the great (and easy) recipe!

I cut this recipe in half and cooked for only a few hours (3)  on high.  I used Franks Hot Sauce.  I think it would have been really good if it was not so hot!!  If I make this again I will try using less hot sauce.

We enjoyed this very much. Since we're not all fans of spicy food, I used a bottle of Frank's sweet and spicy buffalo wing sauce. Perfect amount of heat. I used bone-in chicken breasts, removed from the bone when tender, and put the shredded meat back in the crockpot for a bit to soak up the sauce. I drizzled ranch dressing on top of each (I'll try bleu cheese dressing next time)- the cool creaminess was a perfect foil to the spicy heat of the sauce. So easy to make, and quite tasty!

It was very spicy - and when I took it out, it was more of a buffalo chicken dip.  My husband ate a sandwich, but it was a little too hot for me.  So we put it in a saucepan with cream cheese, ranch dressing and shredded cheddar cheese and re-made it into buffalo chicken dip for the game on Sunday!  That was yummy!

This was pretty good, it was a little hot for my kids, but they are small, so I just boiled up some chicken for them and made them chicken salad sandwiches. With the left over, I made the warm cheese buffalo dip, and also today I made me a chicken wrap. It was better today. Mine was not at all soupy.

This was a big hit with my husband!  He insists that I make this for our annual Superbowl Party.  I followed another reviewer's suggestions and cooked my frozen chicken breasts on low for 5 hours, shred them with 2 forks, then left the crock pot on warm until we were ready to eat (about an hour or two later).  The chicken sucked up all the liquid once I shred it.  I served ours with cole slaw, celery & blue cheese.

This recipe rocks! I forgot to pick up a packet of ranch dressing mix so I improvised and used a couple squirts of bottled ranch dressing and it seemed to turn out just fine. My family absolutely loved it. We also used chunky blue cheese dressing as a topping versus extra wing sauce and it was tasty. We'll be adding this to our family favorites and making it again.

Really good!!!  I am always skeptical about slow cooker chicken stuff because white meat tends to dry out the longer you cook it, opposite of all other meats.  I only used 12 oz wing sauce and 3 big chicken breasts (I think almost 1 3/4 pounds) and didn't need to add any more sauce before eating, because there was plenty left.  This made enough for 6 sandwiches.  Served this with 'Absolutely the BEST Rich and Creamy Blue Cheese Dressing' on this site.  I don't know if the chicken needed to be frozen, but in my paranoia over ending up with dry chicken, I bought and froze the chicken.  It turned out really moist so I'm not messing with this one!  I shredded it after 4 hours and cooked it for 1 more, and it was great.  Tossed it back into the sauce and served it like that.

I made this exactly as directed. DELICIOUS! I can't wait to make this for a crowd. The chicken was perfectly tender. It's perfect on sandwiches and would be great on a buffalo chicken pizza. You'll be tempted to skip the butter at the end... don't! It makes the sauce nice and rich.

Very good recipe.  Easy.  I prefer things a bit hotter,but you can always slather more sauce on the chicken!

This is truly fantastic and so simple to make.  My family devoured it!  Even the ones who don't like spicy food ate it, the buns and cheddar cheese we topped it with toned down the heat perfectly.  Will definitely be making this again, it's perfect for the summer since you don't have to turn your oven on.  Pair it up w/a nice summer salad.  Love it!!

This recipe was very easy to make and such a treat to eat.  I used chicken thighs rather than chicken breast.  I also used Red hot pepper sauce and put the butter in at the beginning.  I topped this with creamy cole slaw, pepper jack cheese and pot it on a toasted kaiser roll.  This was such a treat my family whent wild.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!!! We will definately be making this frequently! I topped the sandwiches with a slice of cheese (I used provolone, but I'm sure any kind would taste good).

E A S Y ! !  I did use an entire 17.5 oz bottle of Frank's BUFFALO WING SAUCE and some chicken broth for the cooking phase.  After I shredded the chicken, I added a bit more Frank's, so it wouldn't dry out while on "WARM" in the crock pot.  Used provolone cheese and Kaiser rolls.

WOW!  If you love buffalo chicken sandwiches or buffalo wings, then this is the recipe for you!  I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce for the wing sauce and yes, I'll admit, it was spicy.  But we tamed the heat by adding some crumbled blue cheese on top of the sandwich which melted perfectly into the spicy chicken meat.  This was SO simple to making using the crockpot.  Thanks for the recipe, it was delish!

This recipe ended up being too hot for me and hubby. However, I won't rank it so low just becasue we can't handle the heat. The method and idea is really good but I'll have to play around with it to tone it down a little.

This made for a decent, edible meal.  It must be my personal taste, but I don't care for the shredded texture of chicken in this recipe.  It winds up like the texture of tuna salad with the flavor of buffalo chicken.  Not for me, but thanks for the idea.

I used Frank's Wing Sauce buffalo (med heat).  The kids said it was still too hot, so next time I will try Frank's Wing Sauce Honey BBQ when serving them.  I loved it and will make it again-HOT-when the kids aren't around.

Made it exactly as suggested!   Not too spicy which my husband appreciates.  I added extra hot sauce to my sandwich and used crumbled blue cheese on top  of chicken.   

Later in week I used the shredded buffalo chicken to make a pizza adding onion and crumbled cooked bacon and shredded mozzarella on top of a crust spread with Ranch dressing!  Will make again!

It was good but I couldn't really taste the ranch dressing. Maybe I overdid it on the buffalo sauce, or it was too hot. I used Texas Pete's.

Followed the suggestion to shred with a knife after 5 hours, then let cook for 2 hours more. Worked out perfect and the sauce soaked into everything after I shredded it. I really enjoyed Texas Pete's Buffalo sauce. I"m going to put some coleslaw on a sandwich tomorrow!

Make sure you pick your sauce wisely as I did not like the local brand I used. Also I added some chicken stock after reading the reviews, but I didn't feel it was necessary and made the mixture too soupy. Otherwise, it was very good. I might suggest using a tougher roll instead of a French hoagie and adding lettuce and blue cheese crumbles. Yummmm

I made this today according to the instructions and using the exact ingredients called for.  While I loved the flavor and the ease of preparation, we also found it incredibly salty... In fact, I was surprised to see only one other reviewer mention the saltiness!  I may try using a mixture of broth and hot sauce to cook the chicken and after shredding, adding the wing sauce back in with the chicken.  It's good enough that I will experiment  to cut the salt a bit.

I put 6 chicken breasts in with 2 cups of franks wing sauce and the entire hidden valley ranch packet.  At 5 hours, I shred the chicken, put another 1/2 cup of wing sauce, and 1/2 stick of butter.  I let that cook another hour and served on ciabatta rolls with mozzarella cheese.  We really liked this and plan to make it again.

I was in the mood for Buffalo Chicken and decided upon this recipe. In the slow cooker I put in a couple frozen breasts (still frozen) and only the buffalo sauce.  After 6 hours it was fall-apart tender, I couldn't even pick it up with a fork without it shredding itself..  Sometimes slow cooked breast meat seems tough to me, but that didn't happen today.  I didn't use a ranch packet or butter at all but instead made up a homemade creamy peppercorn dressing.  Served on a kaiser roll with that creamy dressing, chopped celery and blue cheese crumbles. I may or may not have topped with a bit more of the buffalo sauce.  The celery added a really nice crunch that this sandwich needs.  Out-fricking-Standing.

Made this for the boys tonight and they just loved it. After shredding the chicken I added some creamy ranch dressing and totally forgot the butter.  Put them on hoagie rolls with extra ranch and shredded mozzarella cheese. Delish

Cooked in chicken stock for about 4 of the hours because my daughter doesn't like hot sauce- took some chicken out for her.. Scooped as much stock out as I could and put the wing sauce in. Was great! Will definitely make again.

Yep, I will be making this again!  Super easy weeknight meal and I made enough to freeze for an even easier meal at a later date.   I used Frank's Red Hot Wing Suace (buffalo flavor) and it wasn't spicy at all - next time I will look for a higher heat variety.  Grilled both hoagie buns and onion rolls then added melted Monterey Jack to each - consensus was onion rolls next time. My son and husband added tomatoes and onions to theirs too. I generally dislike crockpot cooking since most everything seems like dried out, over cooked meat that all taste the same.  This one is helping me change my mind!

Made this for my friend, his mother, and his 8 year old son.  I used Frank's Wing Sauce - hot.  It was a huge hit.  Served it on hoagie rolls but would also be good on other types of buns and rolls as well.  Added some mayo, tomato, and onion.  Let me say that my friend loves spicy food and regularly eats Indian food with a lot of spice.  This had plenty of kick for him.  Even the son loved it.

This was a huge hit with my boyfriend and his friends! However, I definitely did not need the full 7.5 hours to cook this thing. I started off by putting my slow cooker on high for 3.5 hours. Then I separated the chicken or “fork” the chicken, then place slow cooker on low and I let it sit for only another 1.5 hours before it was ready to eat! We paired it with blue cheese sauce on the side and sourdough bread that was super soft and went great with it. And finally, we added some cilantro!! If you run out of bread like we did, using romaine lettuce just for wraps are a sweet idea and makes it super refreshing!!

The recipe I made was good, but I made a lot of changes. My local grocery doesn't carry Frank's Red Hot, so I substituted. In it's place I put 3/4 a bottle of Lousiana hot sauce, three tablespoons of butter, and went on with the recipe (mostly) as planned. My slow cooker is stuck on High, as it has been since 2003 when five year old me tore the knob off. So it only took two hours. When cooked through I shredded it, wrapped it in a tortilla, and added ranch on top. It was delicious, but most definitely not the same as the recipe above. I'm mostly posting this review as an easy substitution.

My girlfriend and I enjoyed this recipe.  She said it had good flavor.  The white meat came out a little on the dry side, as others have mentioned.  I plan on trying it again at some point with dark meat (probably thighs).  Also, we both agreed that the butter did not really seem necessary - it was good before adding it.

This was a really good base recipe. I made Chef John's Buffalo Chicken Wing Sauce from this site and then just added the ranch dressing mix. About 4.5 hours in the crock pot. I did as some readers suggested and thickened the sauce with cornstarch. Really good, really delicious!

I LOVED this recipe!! I'm giving it 5 stars, but I'll mention that I used my own homemade buffalo sauce and homemade ranch seasoning mix, so I wouldn't know exactly how this would taste with store-bought stuff. I also cut the recipe in half, so the chicken was perfectly done after only 5 hours on low. Not dry at all! I shredded the chicken in the crockpot with all the juices, and mixed it all together. Perfection! I also did not add extra buffalo sauce at the end, because the flavor was AWESOME and I didn't want to drown it in too much sauce. The method I used was exactly the same as the recipe though, and the final result was phenomenal!!  I will definitely be putting this in regular rotation, especially for my husband's lunches! Thank you for a delicious and easy recipe!

I wanted to love this! The family loves buffalo chicken but did not like this at all. The taste of the ranch dressing disappeared and the butter added no richness at all. Too salty, too spicy, too soupy of a consistency.

Yum! I have made this before, but adding the 1/4 cup of chicken broth at the beginning and shredding the chicken 1.5 hour before finished cooking definitely made it better.

This was way too salty. The packet of dry ranch mix did nothing for the flavor other than making it too salty.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  Next time I will omit the ranch packet and add nonfat greet yogurt or cream cheese for creaminess and to temper the heat a bit.

I tried this twice. Things seemed to go well and taste good until I put in the dry ranch mix. It made it SO salty and non-edible the first time so I used a different brand and only sprinkled a little bit it in the second time. Again, still too salty. My third attempt will omit that all-together and I'll just put some ranch or blue cheese dressing on top of my sandwich.

I followed the recipe, and I have a crock-pot that doesnt run too hot. However, after 6 hours the chicken was near mush falling apart with a spoon. It was more like I slow cooked canned chicken and not fresh. Maybe, buffalo sauces differ in their thickness. I am going to see if I can salvage this into a dip or a buffalo chicken pizza sauce. I was making this for mini sandwiches, for the Super Bowl game, but it is just unfortunately way too soupy!

These were pretty good, although I added a lot to them.  Made the chicken as directed.  I also made a mixture of ranch or blue cheese dressing with finely diced celery, green peppers and onions.  stacked the dressing mixture onto to sandwiches along with the chicken and lettuce.  Yum!  Oh and my chicken wasn't dry at all.

Fantastic recipe. As other posters noted, I added all of the hot sauce to the slow cooker. I like it saucy. I served on a kaiser roll with a slice if cheddar. Magnificent!

These were very good.  I don't know if adding the ranch mix did anything for flavor. I used a 12 oz. bottle of Franks buffalo wing sauce. I cooked 4 large breasts on high for 4 hours. It was perfect. It was not too hot.

After I shredded the chicken and let it cook for another half hour, I removed 1/2 the chicken for those who like spice and added two oz. of cream cheese to the rest of the chicken for those who would like a more tame flavor.

Served with carrots and celery.

Just what I was looking for!  All the taste without the skin and bones and other less desirable elements that wings have.  I love this on a good whole grain cracker but will probably make lettuce wraps as well.  Makes enough for two or three meals.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is SO GOOD and so easy! My husband is a huge fan, as are friends who've had this at our potlucks. Really good when topped with some blue cheese or ranch dressing.

I love this recipe but I'm one to add my own little creative touches.  I added celery and onion to the crockpot and baked the rolls with a little Swiss cheese.  Perfect!!!!!!

Just tasted like chicken drenched in hot wing sauce with a hint of ranch. Entirely too salty and yes I bought the right sauce. Not a keeper here.

I've made these a few times and each time they are extremely too spicy for most people. I like spicy, so they don't bother me so much, but when I'm only 1 of 10 people that like them, it's a problem. I also need to find a better bread for these. The hoagie rolls were too big and hamburger buns didn't taste right.

Mine came out with lots of sauce (not a bad thing). Used five chicken breast halves instead of four and I have a small crockpot. Still great. Will make this regularly. Too good and too easy not to make. My boyfriend even started taking bites before it was finished. He couldn't help himself. Used a Carl's Jr. biscuit to serve with crumbled bleu cheese. Amazing. Would still be great without the butter.

Easy and great. I don't use the ranch seasoning pack, but that's because we add ranch dressing on top as well as putting it on butter toasted texas toast. Never any leftovers.

12/14: not very good.  but i did make a lot of changes.  i used half a bottle of siracha instead of a whole one and also added a cup of chicken broth to cover since i was going to be at work for 9 hours and it is only suposed to cook for 5.  so it turned out dry and not very flavorabe but PLENTY HOT!

Very Good. I used Buffalo Wing Sauce and added 1 cup of Mexican chicken broth based on recommendation of other reviewer that it needed more liquid. The broth was good enough to eat on it's own.

I've now cooked this countless times, and its phenomenal. Easy and delicious, impossible to screw up. Try substituting various other sauces for a portion of the franks; we've had nothing but tasty experiments with this. My favorite is a 1/4 chipotle barbecue in place of 1/4 of the franks - doesnt detract from the flavor but turns down the spice a notch and adds smoky deliciousness.

This recipe was very easy, but the taste was just average to me.  Sort of meh.  The ranch made it tangy/almost sour tasting (next time I think I will try HVR Fiesta Ranch mix) and overall, I thought it tasted too greasy.  I'm not a serious hot wings lover, however, so that might have shaped my opinion.

Don't know if I should be rating this recipe seeing as how I made 1 huge change. I was unable to find a bottle of mild buffalo sauce (if such a thing exists) so I added a bottle of Frank's Sweet Chilli sauce instead. I followed all of the other directions and this came out amazing. I served it on kaiser rolls with pickle chips, sweet potato fries and a garlic aioli sauce for dipping. The sauce went great with the sandwiches. My 8-year-old said this was the best meal ever and my 16-month-old gobbled it up. 5 Hours on low was enough time to cook the chicken and after I shredded it I returned it to the slow cooker for another 30 minutes to absorb all of the sauce that was swimming around in the pot. I will definitely make this again.

This was so easy to get together which was a huge help on a busy morning.  I loved the flavor of the sauce although it is a tad salty.  The chicken fell apart, but, was incredibly dry.   I should have trusted my instincts and known not to cook boneless breasts for 6-7 hours.    I will make this again, although, next time reduce the time or just put it in a dutch oven and bake.  I am rating based on the taste of the recipe, but, the timing was off.

Okay, I have to confess something:  I made this recipe EXACTLY as written!  And it was great!  I get so irritated when everyone chimes in with "oh, but I changed the buffalo for barbecue sauce".  

I didn't have high hopes as I've done white meat in the slow cooker before, and have done it too long I guess because it came out chalky.  This did not, and I'm glad to have a meal I can quickly prep in the morning and come home at night and it's ready to go.  I know a lot of slow cooker recipes are that, but they're also fatty and caloric.  I'm into fitness and eating clean and this one is great.  What's leaner than chicken breast?

So, kudos to devinesolace - thanks for a keeper.

Made this for a party yesterday and everyone loved it! For the buffalo sauce, we used Frank's original, a little Sriracha and butter. I am eating the leftovers today and I can't wait for lunch!

Before leaving to go to Bay Fest in Mobile, AL I put this together in the crock pot, so me & my hubby would something to eat when we got home. It was great idea, the chicken fell apart all on its own when in went shred it with a folk.  I thought it would have more flavor. I'm a little disappointed, but it was nice to have something ready when arrived home. I might try to doctor it up the next time.

I have made this recipe time and time again.  It is a staple for football parties and office pot lucks. Everyone raves about it and I am always asked for the recipe.  Some people just eat the chicken on it's own; I will have hoagie rolls or potato rolls on the side to use. I also like to put out the prepackaged slaw from the produce section with ranch dressing for those who prefer to cool down the heat a bit. It is super simple and requires very little hands on time. My best advice is to use a wing sauce that you enjoy.

I liked this recipe.  It's spicy enough as is.  Adding more sauce will kick it up for anyone who wants more heat, and a little more moisture.

L-O-V-E this recipe with the changes I made to it. I start with the breasts frozen for more moisture, use 3/4cup of Franks and the entire packet of Ranch mix. I top the sandwich with a drizzle of Ranch dressing and a couple slices of Roma tomato! Every person I have made this for loves it and has asked for the recipe! YUM, I just may have to make it tonight!

Ok. Maybe I am not a big fan of heat because I found this recipe to be way over the top spicy, to the point of being unenjoyable. My son needed 4 glasses of milk just to get through 1 sandwich. I like the ease of the recipe and the chicken itself tasted nice and tender, but the spice factor was just too hard to get over. Will not be making it again.

I loved it! So easy and super yummy! I used KC Masterpiece Buffalo Sauce and Hidden Valley Ranch (1/2) packet. My husband thought it was a little salty, but I thought it was perfect. Will definitely be making this quite often!

I make this recipe frequently. I use half chicken breasts and half thighs, and just pick out the bones and joints at the end of cooking. I also add a couple cloves of minced garlic to the crock pot. Whip cream cheese and a high quality bleu cheese dressing together and spread on a toasted bun, slice of tomato and the shredded chicken. You are in business!

I took the advice of another reviewer and added cornstarch to thicken up the sauce - made  a huge improvement!  We also used the leftover meat in Buffalo Chicken wraps - with cheddar and jalapeños, were to die for!

This turned out great!  I used Red Devil and Tapatio hot sauce and it came out very spicy.  I was short on time, so I did 2 hours on high and 2 hours on low.  It started to fall apart around hour 3.  Very tasty.  Next time I might use something less spicy.  I also did not pay close attention to the directions and cooked it in the full amount of sauce from the get go.  It seemed to work fine because it did evaporate or soak into the meat.

So easy, we love hot wings and this is a way to get it without all the grease and fried fat that comes with traditional hot wings. We put on toasted, sourdough rolls and teenage boys gobble it up and go back for more. Great with fresh salad as a side.

I followed this recipe exactly as it is and it was amazing! My boyfriend is a huge buffalo chicken fan so I'm always looking for new recipes to try and this is definitely a new favorite! We ate ours on toasted Bulkie rolls with cole slaw and ranch dressing. So easy and SO delicious!

This was wonderful , I scaled it down to make only 3 servings ( it was just for my hubby and I ...too spicy for the 2 yr old) we both devoured it. I served it on a bun with lettuce and a ranch salad on the side. The only thing I will do differently next time is to cut down on the dry ranch mix , it was just a bit too salty ( I used unsalted butter also ) and I am known for loving salt. Definitely a keeper and super easy.

My family thought it was great, perfect after a late afternoon at the baseball field to serve to a hungry group.  I served it with shredded lettuce and let everyone choose between blue cheese and ranch.  I hope to remember to have some cut up carrot and celery sticks the next time I serve it, just to add some veggies.

It was pretty good, I used franks Red hot chicken wing sauce which is pretty mild compared to regular franks red hot. I added a cup of chicken broth mixed with the hot sauce, added some diced onion and celery drizzled the chicken with EVOO, used 6 chicken breasts and put the butter in at the beginning of the cooking. Chicken shredded easily after about 6 hours. I kept the shredded chicken in the liquid for about another 30 min to soak up the juice.  Served it on crusty chabatta bread with some extra hot sauce. I plan on trying the left overs in a wrap as other reviewers suggested.  I made the blue cheese coleslaw from this site and did not like that at all.

Very good and easy to make.  Although after a couple of tries I added a lot more chicken and it was still delicious.

It was SO easy to make and tasted SO good. We really liked the flavor combination of buffalo and ranch. The only change I made was to add butter.

instead of chicken breast I used chicken tenders, because it was on sale it turned out great but i added a lot more heat to it and i couldnt set it on a lower setting other than high and it was done in 1 and a half hour and I have a small crock pot so i put about roughly 6-7 peices in and when that batch was done reused the sauce for more chicken tenders turned out great so far

This recipe was fantastic! I changed it a little and that's why I didn't give it 5 stars. I have little ones and was afraid it would be too spicy so I used 3/4 BBQ sauce and 1/4 wing sauce. Topped it with slaw and blue cheese crumbles. I used the entire ranch packet mainly bc I didn't want one half opened packet to store. Thanks for the recipe! Def a keeper!

This was good, but a bit salty.  The chicken was very tender at 6 hrs and like others, I shredded the meat and returned to the sauce with the crockpot off for about half an hour.  Definitely toast your buns (with butter if you're not dieting) because that adds a nice bit of texture.

Making this for dinner tonight. Only took about 4.5 hours in my crockpot. Tastes delicious. Added a dash of siracha for a zing of heat. Planning on serving on Portuguese rolls with a dollop of Cheese Wiz and curly fries!

Amazing :)) highly recommend . I made a few changes all for the better . I had something cooking in crock pot already so I boiled chicken tenders in some herbs / spices and shredded it . Then in a hot pan I added butter sautéed onions into it ( cut onions in thin strips ) added shredded chicken , hot sauce and ranch dressing. ( bottled kind) let's soak up sauce a few minutes and took off heat. Then I put them on Kings Hawaiian sandwhich buns (lightly toasted) 
Was so good. Must try!

This is amazing. I used a 13oz. bottle of yuengling hot wing sauce, and added 3 oz of sriracha as well as 4 cloves of garlic and let it cook for the full 7 hours, though I stirred it around every few hours. My fiance and I love this so much.

This is one of my husband's favorite things that I make.  Before adding the wing sauce,  I pour it into a container and mix the whole packet of ranch seasoning.  I also add 2 cloves minced garlic.  Then pour over 4 chicken breasts.  Cook on low 4-5 hrs, shred, add butter, then let cook on low for another 30-45 min.  Serve on toasted hoagie rolls with melted american cheese, blue cheese dressing.  YUM!

Way too spicy.  I even tried mixing it with some sour-cream to take away some of the heat, but it didn't really work.  We ate it but would not make this again.

I didn't love this recipe but it may have been my fault...I may have overdone it on the hot sauce.  Will try again and add less to the chicken during cooking and keep it to add later if needed.

These were just ok.  I really like buffalo sauce so I was hoping I would like this but it did not have a lot of flavor.  I even used a bottle of buffalo sauce that I was familiar with.

These are scrumptious!! I did make a couple of changes. I only used a half cup of hot wing sauce and added a half cup of water to it in my measuring cup and mixed in the ranch dressing. I only had the "thick" version of the wing sauce on hand. But it worked out well because I still had sauce left to add to the sandwich once it was built. Super yummy! Even my 4 year-old who doesn't like spicy liked these, I just put ranch on her sandwich instead of more wing sauce. Wonderful recipe, versatile to please every member of your family, even the picky ones! ;-)

I took this to a potluck at work. Everyone loved it, there was none left and everyone wanted recipe. It was not too salty or spicy ( I should have taken some regular hot sauce for the people who wanted more heat) as some of the reviewers mentioned. I did add celery and onions to the bottom of pot and marinade the chicken with onion and garlic powder, pepper, a little creole seasoning, about a tablespoon of rice wine vinegar, a couple tablespoons of evoo for at least an hour. I will definitely be making this 1 of my fave crockpot meals.

I have made this recipe over a dozen times and it always gets rave reviews.  I use 6+ chicken breasts in a crockpot and keep the rest of the recipe the same.  I made 2 crockpots of this recipe for my son's graduation & I am not exaggerating when I tell you that his friends finished both crockpots in 30 minutes.  I use slider rolls and make my own blue cheese dressing for topping. If you do have left overs, you can always use tortillas & shredded cheese & lettuce for Buffalo Chicken wraps. I have also filled large wonton wrappers with the chicken and cheese & folded into a triangle & deep fried! Possibly one of the best crock pot recipes of all time!!!

Awesome, huge party hit! Used 6 chicken breasts, 1 1/2 bottles of Mild wing sauce, whole packet of ranch and 4 TBS of butter to accommodate the crowd. Will definitely make again!

This dish was just okay.  It's uncomplicated, but maybe too much so.  It just didn't have a very interesting flavor to me.  My husband specifically asked me if we could avoid having leftovers of this because "he didn't hate it, but didn't love it either."  I do love buffalo chicken, but this just didn't do it for me.  I can see why some people may like it though.

Very Good! I used Franks Buffalo Sauce, worked out very well and very tasty! I suggest being a fan of Buffalo Sauce because these are the real deal, they do have a kick!! I added blue cheese for extra flavor and it was like eating a wing on a roll!

we love these and instead of sandwiches I use for quesadillas I just put in a tortilla add cheese and fry in skillet. Was really useful during the chemical spill we had in Charleston wv where we live at that contaminated the water here. I recommend using crock pot liners for easy clean up. Makes good leftovers too

This was really good flavor-wise, but was super salty! Need to find a way to cut down on the salt either in the hot sauce or from the ranch packet.

YUM! We really enjoyed this! I served on rolls with Swiss cheese. My boyfriend came home from work & couldnt stop saying how delicious the house smelled. He had 2 giant sandwiches.. & then the next day ate about 2. He didnt even want me to make a new dinner-- just ate leftovers! I found out last minute that I didnt have dry ranch packet, so i used regular ranch. I think it turned out better this way. I'm sure it would've been completely spicy just drenched in hot sauce. This ones a keeper!!

I did not like this recipe and I was shocked that soooo many people loved it.  It had little to no flavor, the chicken was soggy, just boring.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!  The only thing that I did differently was to use chicken tenders instead of the chicken breasts.  It cooked in almost half the time and was very good!  Will be making this again!

This recipe was great! I did modify it a bit because I like a kick but not too much. I used a half bottle of Franks Hot Sauce and 1/4 cup of chicken broth. I wanted my kids to be able to eat it too. Instead of the bread I used a tortilla and threw some lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. It was a hit at my house.

TERRIBLE!!!  Way too salty! Wondering if we used the wrong sauce but looking at the sodium content of the sauces I've used for wings and other various dressings etc. I don't know how anyone could eat this?

These were great. I served to company, and they liked them a lot. The only thing I changed was adding 1 Tbsp butter instead of 2, and next time I don't think I'll add any. I served with blue cheese dressing, colby jack cheese and coleslaw, as recommended by different reviewers. We'll be having these again!

Umpteenth time I made this so far. Last night, I tried it with a homemade dry ranch dressing mix (I used a little more than a serving for a little more oomph). My husband tells me that he topped it with shredded mozzerella cheese and served it with a veggie platter with homemade low-fat ranch dip. My husband and kids are still talking about it. For us, this made enough for five loaded sandwiches at dinner and three for the next day's lunch.  Always a winner in this house!

Wow! This was awesome and my family loved it! It's a regular on our dinner menu per request of them all. I must say I use a whole pack of dry ranch seasoning and use very mild buffalo wing sauce that way my 2 year old eats it as well!

Very delicious! Used thigh and breast fresh chicken (~ 1 lb of each), 8 oz Frank's Red Hot "Wings - Buffalo" Sauce (if you choose to use more sauce, be aware the chicken might get soupy), omitted dry Ranch dsg, did put the (real) butter in, also added 1/3 cup lowfat cream cheese to mellow the heat (it doesn't curdle if you cook on LOW). 4 Qt crock, on Low 5 hrs - then removed lid and stirred chicken with fork, the chicken shreds itself and sauce mixes in nicely. Replaced lid, cooked 1 hr more.  Melts in your mouth.  Great with cheddar cheese and ranch dressing.  We will be eating this weekly!

as another reviewer suggested, I shredded the chicken after 5 hours on LOW; then added the butter and heated for another 2 hours on LOW; this really did help infuse the spiciness into the meat. Definitely served with ranch dressing on the buns.

this is a staple at our house now! sooo easy. 
you don't need to use a ranch packet if you don't have one. the sauce and butter is fine. just make sure you don't over cook the chicken, each slow cooker is different and it depends on the size and heat of your cooker and how full it is.

These were very salty. Good for a dip but not a whole sandwich. I would use just hot sauce not buffalo sauce.

This is a pretty good recipe. My sons love it. However, I wish you could somehow make a lower sodium version. That's the only drawback on this for me. I like to put this mix in a lettuce wrap for a lower carb version.

Holy cow! I tried this recipe for the first time to serve to our guests on NY Eve - they LOVED it! Just a few very minor changes/additions: I used chicken tenderloins and boneless/skinless thighs for added flavor. I also added a bit of chicken broth in the beginning since I did read others comments on their chicken drying out after a few hours. Lastly, I removed some of the sauce and blended in a block of softened cream cheese right before it was ready to serve. So creamy and good served over sourdough rolls. Thanks for sharing such a great (and simple) recipe!

Flavor was good (Thanks to the Franks) and it was super easy. Next time I would add more to it: blue cheese crumbles, coleslaw, something...

Ok well I forgot to take everything out of the freezer until I got home at 3:00pm I have been wanting to make theese for a few weeks now. So my chicken was frozen 3 hours before dinner. I was determined to make theese so I poached my frozen chicken in chicken broth and water for about 20 minutes. They were pretty much cooked when I took them out of the pan. I cut them up and put them in the crock pot with franks wing sauce and a pkg of hidden valley ranch, cooked them on high for 1 hour, then broke them up/shredded them took a 12 pack of slider buns put those on a foil lined cookie sheet put the chicken mixture on them, topped them with some provalone cheese sprayed the top of the buns with butter flavoed cooking spray covered them with foil and baked them at 425 for 10 minutes, top shelf...... went with the temp I had to cook the tater tots at. 12 sliders, 3 people, I got 1 hubby and son loved them. Can't wait to do them all the way in the crockpot. I think they will be even better that way!

Made this last night and it was great.  I cooked three large chicken breasts, a full 12 oz bottle of Franks RedHot Wings Sauce.  I used the Buffalo flavor, not the Hot Buffalo flavor.  The regular buffalo flavor has plenty of heat for us although both are good.  I also added about 3/4 cup of chicken broth.  I cooked this on high for a little over three hours and then shredded the chicken and added the butter.  There was still plenty of sauce, so I didn't add anymore.  I let it go for another hour or so.  I toasted up hoagie rolls, put the chicken mixture on there, topped with some crumbled blue cheese, and a slice of Provolone cheese.  I put that under the broiler for just a short time to melt the cheese, then topped with some shredded lettuce.  It was fabulous!  My husband loved it too, in fact instead of making a second sandwich he just ate a bowl of the chicken and said how much he liked it.  I am making the buffalo chicken pizza tonight with the little leftovers we have.

This is really good!  I agree with another reviewer who suggested adding some dark meat.  I think it made a world of difference.  White meat only would be too dry.  I did 3 small breasts and 3 boneless thighs.  Also used Texas Pete's extra mild buffalo sauce.

loved it , the only thing I suggest is to only put half of the dry ranch mix if you don't want it too salty.  other than that, it is delicous!!

I liked the texture of the chicken but honestly, this was so salty that we had a hard time eating it. I'm guessing that it was the brand of buffalo wing sauce that I chose.  I really wanted to like this dish as so many others do, so I will make this again using a different wing sauce (with a lower sodium count).

Pretty good. very easy. I'm keeping this one.Made it without the butter and it turned out fine. The chicken really shredded up nicely. Served on steak rolls with ranch, red onion, and slices of provel. yummy! Just wanted to add something here after I made it the second time. This time I did use the butter, and I liked it even more. Not sure why it changed it so much, but it seemed more like buffalo chicken to me. Very good family and friends loved it!

These were really good but spicy.  I used the whole packet of ranch dressing and left out the butter.  I also had used the whole bottle of buffalo sauce in the crockpot and didn't need to add extra after...it was soupy enough.  I put blue cheese dressing on my sandwich to "cool" it down.

I usually make this on the stovetop or with chicken already cooked and stored in the freezer.  I eat mine with american cheese on a hamburger bun.  My husband likes to use blue cheese dressing too.  It's very good.

DH loved it! We're big Hooter's fans, so I used Hooter's brand hot wing sauce. It was only 12 oz, so I added 5 oz of honey to get a honey hot wing flavor. I omitted the Ranch for this reason. Cooked for 3 1/2 on high because I was short on time. It was perfect!

My family LOVES this recipe. I've made it several times in the past few months. I rarely add the butter as I find it unnecessary. After a few times of making the recipe, it's easier to eyeball the measurements. I use Franks Original hot sauce since we always have it on hand and it's our absolute favorite. The kids gobble this up! I've recommended this recipe to several friends, who all love it too! Thank you!!!!!

Easy as can be! Perfect when you forget that you had to "bring a dish". Chances are you already have it all in the fridge. Always a hit.

Easy recipe and tastes delicious!  I cannot cook at all, and this is the only recipe my husband asks me to make once a week!  Sandwiches are fantastic and any extra chicken we use to make a buffalo chicken pizza.  Highly recommend this!  Our favorite buffalo sauce is Anchor Bar Buffalo Sauce since it's spicy and delicious, but with next to NO calories making this a VERY healthy dish.  Enjoy!

The recipe is super easy and tastes so amazing! I used Texas Pete Mild Wing sauce, added crushed red pepper, and used wraps instead of buns. Also used the rest of the dry Ranch and added it to 6oz of sour cream to have some Ranch dip!

As written, very blah taste, the ranch added nothing to the flavor of the dish.  With some additions, there was some improvement.   Buffalo wings aren't wings without the bleu cheese and celery.  Served w/garnish of blue cheese and diced celery.  This brought it up to speed.  easy and quick but would not make it again.

Was not to my liking. There really is no use in wasting your Buffalo Sauce and Ranch Dressing in the Crock Pot. I would use chicken stock (Without Ranch) and then shred Chicken and remove all liquid, otherwise runny and messy. Put Chicken back in Crock Pot with Buffalo Sauce ( I would add fresh chopped Jalapeno/Serrano and/or Habenero Peppers) and heat for a short time. Otherwise this was rather bland and not hot enough for me.

Yummy and super easy.  I found it quite saucy and tangy, so used a bit less Frank's to start with and moisten it with chicken broth if needed, and leave out the ranch dressing pack entirely, replacing it with some garlic and onion powder and paprika.  I serve it on buns with lettuce, blue cheese dressing and some cilantro relish, it's absolutely delicious.

I love this recipe! I have modified it a bit. I make my own buffalo sauce  by using Franks red hot and butter wisk together. That way you can control how spicy you want it. I cook the chicken on high about 4 hours with just a splash of broth, then shred the chicken, then add my buffalo sauce and a bit of ranch powder in, mix and let it cook about 2 hours on low. I toast the rolls and serve with celery and blue cheese dressing on the side. There is never any left! My whole family loves it!

The hubs loved this!  It was really easy to make, which is also a big plus.  I don't know that the ranch packet really adds much to it, so you could probably skip that if you don't have any on hand.

This recipe turned out better than I thought it would.  I used 3 chicken breasts and about 4 thighs.  I couldn't find Franks Red Hot, so I used Crystal's Wing Sauce.  One bottle of the regular wing sauce (12oz) and about 1/4 of the extra hot.  Used a full pack of Ranch Dressing Mix.  Shredded the meat, returned it to the crock and let it go for another hour or so.  Put meat on a toasted Cibatta roll and added a little blue cheese dressing.  Served with coleslaw.  Turned out with just the right about of spice.  Definitely will make this again.

I found this to be pretty tasty (and not alarmingly spicy like others had). I used the thick Frank's Hot Sauce and sprinkled some dry ranch dressing mix into it. I'd say probably a little more than a tablespoon. I used 4 partially frozen breasts on low for about 6 hours and shredded about an hour before eating. It wasn't dry, but moist and delicious. Added ranch dressing to a toasted hoagie and some crumbled blue cheese. Will likely make again!

YUM YUM YUM! I love buffalo wings so this recipe was a huge hit with me! I used Franks red hot buffalo wing sauce and left the butter out but otherwise followed the directions. Served on buttered ciabatta bread toasted under the broiler. Topped with mozzarela cheese and ranch. Thanks for a great recipe. Will make this again and again!

AWESOME! We use Frank's Buffalo Sauce but never add the butter. The leftovers also make an awesome cold sandwich the next day!

I used one 12 oz bottle of wing sauce, 4 chicken breasts and 1/2 poutch of ranch mix. I mixed it all at the beginning, no butter or extra sauce at the end. I served w/ blue cheese dressing, toasted bun, shredded cheddar and lettuce. It very good. Thanks for the recipe!

Too much buffalo flavor for me, kinda killed my tastebuds.  If I make this again I will have to put the entire packet of ranch, instead of just half.  Overall, though, this was not a homerun for me at all.

Wished I had liked this dish but it was far too spicy for our taste.  1/2 the hot sauce might also have been too much.  I'm all for buffalo chicken, but we couldn't taste anything but heat.
Will not make again.

Very good, only complaint was that the chicken was fairly dry. Next time I think I will try shredding the chicken before its totally done and adding it back to the slow cooker to finish off and soak up some of the sauce for the remaining hour or two. Also the sandwiches are way better with cheese added to them.

Forgot to add the ranch mix and it was still delicious! We used a mix of Franks spicy buffalo sauce and Franks bbq wing sauce. I added ranch dressing to top my sandwich. This recipe is sooo easy!

Very good recipe, though I don't think it needed the butter at the end.  I would also cut out about 20% of the buffalo sauce to get the overall dish a little less soupy.  However, last night it was cold and football was on - these sandwiches were perfect.

Made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I both loved it! I didn't use the butter. I used 7 chicken breasts, 1 1/2 bottles medium buffalo sauce, and drizzled ranch in the crock pot. After 5 hours, I shredded and left on warm for two hours.  Toasted some hoagie buns, then put the chicken, shredded lettuce, and ranch. Was spicy but definitely the way we like it!!

This was okay, it was greasy. I used legs with thigh instead of breast. I didn't have enough wing sauce, so I used water to make up the difference. I couldn't find the dry ranch dressing so I used salad seasoning. If there were a next time (only made this to use up the bottle of wing sauce) I'd omit the butter and opt for a homemade sauce. I wonder if cutting back on the wing sauce and using bottled ranch dressing (instead dry) would work. Served with "Country Cottage Potato Salad" from AR.

Great dish for football games! Used 3 chicken breasts & 4 thighs just because I thought it would be dry then when the chicken was done took it out added 2 tablespoons of corn starch and half a block of cream cheese. Let it mix in and melt then put chicken back in, the guys loved it on deli rolls. I love this website.

We loved this recipe, even though I made it without ranch! My husband doesn't like it, so I made the dish with about 1.3 lbs of chicken tenderloins, and a 12 oz. bottle of Hot wing sauce from BWW. Spicy! I had it on a low setting for about 2 1/2 hours, then I shredded the chicken, added in the 2 Tbsp of butter, and let it sit on low for another 1 1/2 hrs. Didn't add more sauce, since the 12 oz. was sufficient for the amount of chicken I had. Served it on buttered, toasted sandwich rolls with mozzarella cheese on top. Delicious - thanks for the idea!

This was pretty good but I would make changes next time.  

Pros: Easy to make and good
Cons:   Very salty if you follow the recipe

Since some of the other reviewers commented this is very salty I used half the recommendation on the ranch dressing since that's salty as well. It was still too salty for my taste and next time, I'll make my own wing sauce to control the salt level.

Overall, I did enjoy it and will make again.  I don't like people reviewing recipes with their own versions but I'll be guilty of that here.  

I made smaller portion - cooked 2 frozen chicken breasts, used a little less of the dry ranch dressing, cooked on high for 5 hours, and skipped the butter since that's already in the wing sauce.  It was shredding it by pressing each chicken piecs with a potato masher (works perfectly with no work)!

I served it on a toasted hoagie roll with provolone and topped it with cole slaw (made with pre-packaged slaw cabbage mix and tossed with blue cheese dressing), and of course carrot and celery sticks on a side.

Yummy - Made this for my daughter's Halloween Party last night in my triple crock pot (along with Pulled BBQ Pork - my own recipe - and just frozen meatballs w/ a good jarred marinara and peppers and onions) - Everyone loved it (college age kids), but it ended up pretty wet, so I took the lid off the crock for probably a good hour with it on high to cook out some of the water - I used 5 large breasts (almost 4 lbs) and ended up adding more Frank's Hot Buffalo Wing Sauce and stirring it in - served with Martin's Whole Wheat Potato Slider Rolls - they're slightly sweet, which I think goes well with the hot buffalo chicken - also had additional hot sauce, crumbled bleu cheese, cheddar and bleu cheese dressing available as toppings for them - I also forgot to add the butter, but nobody seemed to notice or care - Love Buffalo anything, so I'll probably make again, but I think it'd be even better braised in a dutch oven :)

Made this last night for my buffalo-wing-loving husband!  He loved it!!  I used more sauce than recommended, shredded it after 5 hours and then let it sit in the crockpot for another 45 minutes.  We loved it!!  Definitely think the sauce makes this though... We will try a better bottle of sauce next time - one from our favorite wing spot... Don't think the stuff off the grocery store shelf did this sandwich justice!!

this is so fantastic!!!!!!    Triple the recipe if you want any leftovers... everyone LOVES this!    

I add boneless chicken thighs to give it a bit more flavor and we top the chicken with a little ranch dressing (bottled) on the sandwich.   

I followed someone else's suggestion and used the leftovers (if there are any) to make the buffalo chicken pizza... wow, another winner!

Love this simple recipe.  I served it on toasted buns that I spread with ranch dressing I had smashed fresh blue cheese into, then topped it with creamy coleslaw and a drizzle of more Buffalo sauce.  Fantastic!  

Next time I might toast the buns, top the bottom with the chicken, then add crumbled blue cheese and pop it under the broiler to melt the cheese.  Then add a simple coleslaw and a drizzle of ranch.

Amazing. What I did was slather honey on one side of the hoagie and broiled it to a crisp then dug out the other side to fill it with the meat and sprinkled it with crumbled bleu cheese. Delicious.

Absolutely delicious, though maybe a bit too spicy.  We'll definitely make it again, but try adding some chicken broth to tone down the spice a bit.

Yum! Made mine with BLSL chicken breasts and BLSL thighs, made it even more like chicken wings with the dark meat. Awesome flavor and super easy. More than enough sauce.

Soooooo good!! I use budweiser mild wing sauce and add a little of our favorite hot sauce to spice it up. We usually cook and shred the chicken the night before then throw it in the crock pot the next morning and it's ready by lunch time!

Another easy and delicious slow cooker winner! We had it on hoagie rolls (yum) then made a pizza with it...DOUBLE YUM...and then on a salad and also in a wrap. It was all very good. My 9yr old loved it =)

WAY TO SALTY.  We couldn't eat it.  I don't know if it was a brand we used, but after reading through more of the reviews, it doesn't sound like that was the issue.  We used Ken's buffalo sauce and it seemed like most other people with the same issue used Frank's.  Would definitely not make this one again.

This was good, but a little too overpoweringly saucey.  I put in three chicken breasts and then halved them length wise.  It only suggested 4 halves and I had 6... I will probably add another breast or two and halve it next time or add less than a bottle of sauce.

As I write this review, my husband is currently on the phone talking about how delicious this dinner was tonight.  It was so good and so easy! I cooked the chicken on low for 6.5 hours.  About 4 hours in, I shredded the chicken and allowed it to cook for the remaining time.  I think this created a very moist end-product.  I also omitted the butter because I thought it was so delicious without it.  I highly recommend this!

Very good. I add something to the cooking method though. Nix the butter at the end (not needed except to add more calories no one wants), and after you shred the chicken, bake in the oven in a casserole dish for 20 min at 350 degrees. This bakes in the sauce better. You can look and gauge how much sauce you want to add. I use Frank's buffalo sauce - like everyone else ;)

This recipe couldn't be easier and it is very good. Perfect for picnics & game days. I did cut down on the cooking time, however - 4 hours on low, then shredded the meat and put it back in the sauce and added the butter. Kept it on warm for an hour or so and then it was ready to go. The meat was tender, juicy & fell apart after 4 hrs. Otherwise the recipe is wonderful as-is. Thanks!

These were easy, but unfotunately I got HOT wing sauce - I never saw it in HOT for wing sauce until I shopped to make this recipe. I won't do that again. We really like spicy, and we love Frank's - but that HOT wing sauce was max for what we could handle.  Next time (and there will be a next time - we love buffalo chicken) I'll use the regular wing sauce :)

This was a great idea! I used a large package of chicken which was about 7 breasts, put it in the crock pot with a 16oz bottle of Frank's wing sauce and let it cook on low for about 4-5 hours. Then I shredded the chicken and left it on warm until we were ready to eat. It fed 9 hungry people with leftovers. Very good...I'll be making this again!

I tried made these according to the recipe the other night and loved the flavor.  However, I don't know that I could take a whole sandwich of this.  I didn't have any other flavors in the meal to cool down the heat.  Next time I'll probably try using the meat in a wrap with shredded lettuce or coleslaw.  Or maybe on a buffalo chicken pizza.  I liked the recipe, I just have to figure out how I want to use it better.

This is so easy, fast, and delicious! I only used about 12 oz of buffalo sauce and it was plenty for me. I also used the whole packet of ranch because I could not taste it after using 1/2 packet. I put mozzarella cheese and blue cheese dressing on it for added flavor. It is a keeper!

This was pretty good, but somehow didn't QUITE hit the spot like real buffalo wings would have.  I have a weird craving for buffalo wings when I'm pregnant...  I don't know why I didn't think this through, but quite obviously, this was waaay too spicy for the kids (not the recipe's fault, of course).  I used homemade Ranch mix and served this on "Soft Sandwich Buns" from this site.  Pretty good - my husband actually liked this a lot, which surprised me because I'M the wing freak in the house. :)  All in all, a good sandwich.  I would make it again and probably have some blue cheese dressing on hand to serve it with.

Made great sandwiches. Warning - it made the house smell pretty strong (vinegar based wing sauce). But it was still worth it! I toasted the hoagies with the meat and some blue cheese till they were warm. Thanks!

Amazing! I took the advice of a few people who shredded the chicken and put it back in the crock pot to simmer for awhile longer. I also added BBQ sauce (not too much to take away from the spicy flavor) and 1 more packet of ranch.

this was the first slow cooker recipe i tried, and i am really disappointed! it was salty, and i didn't use nearly as much buffalo sauce (Frank's brand) nor dried ranch dressing (Hidden Valley) as was called for. the chicken turned out moist and broke apart perfectly, but the resulting flavor was so salty and vinegary that it was totally inedible to both me and my husband. i would not make this recipe again without some serious modifications. i was recommended this recipe by a friend, and she loved it, though, so it must appeal to some people.

Excellent!  I roasted a whole fryer chicken and used that just because that's what I had in my freezer.  I shredded it and followed the recipe....slow cooked it at a very low temp so the hot sauce wouldn't dry out.   I added the rest of the ranch salad dressing mix to some plain greek yogurt to put on the sandwiches and to dip celery in.  Will make again!  Maybe for pizza as some of you have suggested...thanks for the great recipe!

I used 2 1/2 lbs of chicken tenderloins, 1 bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Marinade Sauce, and 1 stick of butter... DELICIOUS!  My coworkers agreed!  Can't wait to have the leftovers. EDIT: I put left overs inside a crescent roll with some bleu cheese crumbles, sprinkles the tops with ranch and parmesean..SO GOOD!!

Easy and wonderful as written. I've made several times and serve on ciabatta rolls with blue cheese dressing and provolone cheese. I've also made it with BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, and bacon on the sandwich, which I prefer. The Frank's Sweet Chili sauce is hubby's favorite. So many ways to switch up this recipe!

Great! I made a mistake the first time I made these and bought the hotter version of the Franks Red Hot Buffalo sauce (I didnt realize there were different levels of the Buffalo one)... we all love spicy food, but this was so spicy that we couldnt even stomach it! So make sure you get the right kind of Frank's, or else you'll be in pain! I served these on hoagie rolls and melted pepperjack or american cheese over them (depending on individual tastes). Thanks!

I think I left the chicken in a little too long because it was slightly mushy.  Still, it tasted great.  It was hot enough to leave my nose running for awhile.  I did put the chicken on round rolls, but it was too messy to pick up, and I had to eat it with a fork.

I made it again with 3 large fresh breasts.  After 4 1/2 hours it was ready to shred, so I shredded it best I could and let it soak for another hour.  This time put it on sub rolls and added coleslaw.  Fantastic!  I plan on making this for a Superbowl party, putting it on sub rolls and adding lettuce, tomato, and blue cheese. Tastes just like wings but so much easier to make!

Also, Franks makes a cayenne pepper sauce.  After shredding, I added a little of this since I like it pretty spicy.

Very delicious!  I added 4 frozen chicken breasts to the crockpot and used about 3/4 of a bottle of a 16 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Sauce and 1/2 of a package of the 1 oz pkg of dry ranch dressing mix.  I cooked them on low for 4 hours and then added 2 tablespoons of margarine, shredded the meat and let it cook for another hour in the sauce.  I toasted hamburger buns with a little butter and put the chicken on them with ranch dressing and they were delicious!  My 13 year old loved them and I am curious to see if my 18 year old will because he is a pickier eater.  He loves buffalo wings but I am unsure if he will like this recipe.

This recipe was soooooo good!!!!  I used poppy sead mini rolls with a slice of melted pepperjack on them and everyone raved about them.  I added a little butter to the pot as well.  They were so good. Soooo easy to make too!  My husband made Chili for the football game and I made these I was done in about 8min while he slaved over the stove for a few hours while I enjoyed a glass....or two of wine.  Try these you wont be dissapointed.

Loved this recipe!  It was so easy to just let it sit all day while I as doing house work.  I added in some Syburgs Wing Sauce with the Frank's Red Hot - I love spicy so this was great for me.  The ranch gave it great flavor.

This is one of my top 3 slow-cooker recipes now. It was fabulous on toasted kaiser rolls with a bit of lettuce - I prefer this recipe over restaurant buffalo chicken sandwiches because it's easy to eat with the shredded chicken. I used a mix of chicken breasts and thighs and reduced the butter (I might not even use the butter next time). Yummy!

I was looking for a recipe that used few ingredients and that I had off hand. I forgot to make a dish for my daughters school gathering. I didnt have time to cook it in the crock pot, so I pressure cooked the chicken, shredded it, and added the sauce I had made in a seperate bowl. Needless to say, I had so many compliments on it. I cant wait to cook it in a crock pot Im sure the flavor really infuses in the chicken, and it tastes even better. I used Kroger brand "medium" wing sauce. Its cheaper, and I think it tastes like BW3.

I quadrupled the recipe and it was a HUGE hit at a party we had last winter.  We had bleu cheese crumbles available to put on the sandwiches as well.  I'm making another large batch again this Halloween and calling it Dragon Meat.

It was an easy meal, and good - but not as tasty as I had hoped.  I've marinated chicken in wing sauce then grilled it before, and I think that is tastier.

Love love love! The first time I made it, I used Louisiana Wing Sauce which was SO hot that we had to add extra butter. The second go-around we used Moore's Wing Sauce and a half of a packet of the ranch dressing and it was absolutely perfect.

I think this is the perfect recipe if you love wings! My husband and I don't like wings so we were a little put off. He thought i should add bbq sauce! but I said then it would be a bbq chicken sandwich! But if you love wings this is fabulous!

Made this for 10 guys at my work- they all loved it and said it was just about the best sandwich they ever ate!
Didn't taste any of the ranch seasoning- might just skip that step next time I make it- I just put a few squirts of actual reanch dressing on the sandwich and it tasted way better to me.

This was great. My husband loved it. I made a few adjustments. I used 4 boneless, skinless thighs. I only added about 6 oz. of Frank's Hot Wing Sauce, but I also added about 4 oz. of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce to cut the heat. I also added about 4 oz. of water. I cooked for 4 hours. I used the extra ranch mix to make roasted ranch potatoes.

Very quick, easy preparation, and yummy to eat.  Everyone in my family loved these, especially on football game get togethers.

This is the easiest recipe to make. Definitely shred the chicken then throw it back into the sauce for about an hour to really soak up everything. We made sandwiches with cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, and tomatoes out of this, it was great! We ate the leftovers as dip with Ritz Crackers. Big hit, this will be be our game day go-to recipe!

This was fantastic! I used 4 chicken breasts, one 12 oz. bottle of Anchor Bar wing sauce, Medium (the inventor of the wings here in Buffalo), one .4 oz packet of Hidden Valley Buttermilk Ranch dressing mix. Mine was super moist, so I didnt add the butter. We topped ours with extra wing sauce from a second bottle, and I added some chopped up celery to my sandwiches for some extra crunch. These were a huge hit for my and my boyfriend, and it made great sandwiches all week! This recipe is a MUST for anyone who likes Buffalo-style chicken flavors and it makes your whole house smell like wings!

I made this dish for a football party and everyone loved it.  Made it just the way it was described.  Will make it aain! Although, I do dispute the calorie count that allrecipes claims per serving! My daughter calculated it out, and a serving containing about 3 ounces of chicken on a bun only contains about 320 calories! Not nearly as bad as the 578 calories the recipe claims!

My husband and teenage son LOVE this. I bought a different brand of wing sauce this last time ( Stubbs Wicked Wing Sauce ) and it was so hot no one could eat it. It even made my husbands eyes water! But when you use the regular hot or even mild wing sauce its great!

Yummy with some blue cheese dressing and chopped lettuce. Next time I might mellow this out a bit and use some tomato sauce too. It was a bit tangy. I used Frank's Original Hot Sauce. I may try Frank's Wing Sauce if I can find it next time. Definitely yummy and would be great for a potluck.

Excellent. Husband and Kids all LOVED it! Made as written and came out wonderfully! Used the other half of the ranch packet to make ranch potatoes in the oven. Then, as others suggested, the next night we made a buffalo chicken pizza from this site and hubby still had leftovers for lunch for several days. Delicious and economical for us since we got so many meals out of it!

We found that half the wing sauce specified was plenty for our tastes.  Chicken was wonderfully tender, not too liquidy, just the right amount of kick for us.

There are probably very few words in the english language that can describe how fantastic these sandwiches are. My husband and I couldnt say enough about these!!! It is a new regular in our house. We had it and a few days later my husband asked me if we could have it again that day! Thats gotta say something when the man in the house special orders!

So good! The cold leftovers were fabulous on my salad the next day. I made it again and stirred in 1/4 c. blue cheese dressing and 1 c. reduced fat sour cream. It was a great dip!

I have a question I haven't made this yet but in the directions you say to add the ranch dressing mix. Do I add it dry or do I mix it up first then add it?

The first few bites were great, but then the ranch got a little overpowering.  If I make this meat again, I will do a little less ranch mix than recommended.

Everyone loved this!  I made this the day before and I think letting it sit overnight just added to the goodness.  I used a combo of boneless skinless breast and thighs, omited the butter in favor of chicken broth.  I also shreded the meat after about 5 hours and placed it back into the sauce for about an hour.  This will become an regular in our home.

This was so easy! I was concerned that leaving it in the crock pot all day, 9.5 hours, would make the chicken mushy but it was perfect! I put the chicken in frozen so it could handle the longer cook time. It made plenty for leftovers too. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was delish. I threw four frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot with the sauce/dressing and it so easily pulled apart with two forks the next morning.  I brushed the hoagie rolls with butter and sprinkled with garlic salt before toasting in the oven,  I then put the chicken on the hoagies, topped with shredded cheese and returned to the oven just to melt the cheese. Topped with pickles and blue cheese dressing...YUMM...will be making this many times over.

I did as another rater said and cooked for a little longer after shredding the meat to allow it soak up more flavor!  Also, I couldn't get to mine in less than 9 hours (closer to 10).  No problem.  Not burnt, delicious.

I told my boyfriend that I'd love to learn how to cook and he told me to join this site and start with easy recipes (most likely, crock pot recipes). Well, this was my first one and we LOVE it and it was SO easy. The chicken is so tender, fell apart so nicely. The sauce is a wonderful kick, not too spicy which is what I was nervous about. Can't say enough about this recipe. I LOVE it.

Not much depth in flavor.  If I'm going to do this kind of thing I'd much rather have buffalo chicken dip.  Seems weird to eat it as a sandwich.

Delicous!! I used sweet baby rays buffalo sauce and hidden valley ranch packet.  With the advice of another user I let the chicken cook for 5 hrs, shredded, added the butter and put back in the slow cooker for another hour or so to let the chicken absorb the sauce.  I think the butter really helped tone down the heat so dont skip it! Served it on toasted hoagie buns with melted provolone cheese and a splash of ranch.  Hubby and I loved this recipe :)

Delicious and easy!  Made it for guests and everyone loved it.  I was hesitant to tell them how easy it was.

I'm the type to follow recipe as it's posted. I will do some changes but, typically not. So may positive reviews, but mine is not. The chicken breasts came out dry after slow cooking 61/2 hours. Really......really spicy hot, actually burned my eyes when I lifted the lid to turn over the chicken! Did put Marzetti Ranch Veggie dip on roll to cut the heat. Won't make again.

Very easy, very tasty!  I topped the sandwiches with bleu cheese and coleslaw.  I then used the other half of the ranch mix and some olive oil and roasted some potatoes to serve with the sandwiches.  Nom nom nom!

This was so easy and so delicious.  It wasn't nearly as spicy as I thought it would be which was great for the people who prefer "mild" hot sauce.  If you want it spicier just add some red hot right onto the sandwhich. I made it last weekend and everyone loved it so much I am making it again except this time I will double it!

This was FANTASTIC!! I added one sliced onion to the bottom of the slow cooker for some extra flavour. I also added Frank's Red Hot Sauce and used regular Ranch salad dressing with a little bit of water to keep it moist. I pulled the meat apart about 4 hours into cooking so every piece was soaked in sauce. Everyone in my family loved it and is begging me to make it again!!!

I made this exactly as recommended, with Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Wing Sauce (my favorite) and homemade ranch dressing mix. I served it on buns with bleu cheese dressing and it was phenomenal.

I made this recipe with franks red hot wing sauce. I loved the addition of the ranch dressing mix but I did find it a bit salty. I also served with a little shredded cheddar and lettuce on the rolls. It was a great easy recipe and next time I will try this with the boneless thighs.

Hubby loved this so much I had to make it a second time in one week.  Used Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce and bottled ranch dressing (because I never have the powder mix at home).  Used the butter the first time, but forgot it the second time.  Can't tell any difference.  Served with a sweet coleslaw.  Awesome recipe!

Delicious & super easy!  Spicy and juicy.  I used frozen chicken breast cutlets, since that's all I had. I cooked it exactly as stated above. I popped a bulkie roll with jalapeno jack cheese to melt, then spread  the bun with blue cheese and added some escarole for color/crunch.  Me, my husband, dad, and brother-in-law loved it!  Will definitely make again.

I'm a huge fan of Franks Red Hot, which is what I used, and I loved this recipe! I didn't add the butter because when I tasted it, I didn't think it needed it. It was yummy.  I did toast my buns and added a little bleu cheese dressing on top.  I will make again and again. Thanks for the recipe!!

Our entire family loves this recipe. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly (3/4 of wing sauce which is about 12 oz) and added the rest of the bottle after shredding. A little too wet.  The last 2 times I made this recipe I mixed 12 oz of Franks Buffalo Wing sauce with 1/2 pack of dry ranch and an entire 3 lb pkg of frozen chicken breast I bought on sale. Before I put on the lid, I made sure all the pieces were covered with sauce. I slow cooked 6 to 7 hours on a higher setting.  Removed the chicken, added the butter to the sauce in the cooker, shredded the meat and put everything back in to slow cooker. No additional sauce needed unless you want it spicer! We are a family of 4 so plenty of leftovers for my teenage boys to warm up. Also - top with crumbled bleu cheese - yummm!

Fantastic.  I've always loved the taste of wing sauce, but not the mess and the dark meat on wings.  Great alternative.

This gets 5 stars because it was very tasty and just couldn't be easier.  I used Frank's Buffalo sauce, and made it a bit diet friendly by using a butter substitute and serving on low fat wraps instead of rolls.  I spread them with light blue cheese dressing and topped with shredded lettuce.  Really good!  My husband kept looking at me and asking "this is good for the diet??"  He couldn't believe it =)

Wow!!  This recipe was amazing!!  I was running short on time, so I had to play with the time and the temp a little.  I added the whole bottle of wing sauce in the beginning along with the whole Ranch packet.  I let the chicken cook on high for three hours, then shredded it and placed it back into the sauce and let it cook for an additional hour.  I also added 1/8 tsp of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce just a bit.  This was a huge hit last night!!  A little Bleu Cheese on top complimented it perfectly.  This is definitely a keeper!!

This was a HIT! I threw in 3 lbs of chicken breast, 1 bottle of Franks buffalo wing sauce, and the butter all at once then about 5 hrs in, I shredded the chicken and returned it to the slow cooker for about an hour and a half to two hours. Served on Kaiser rolls with pepperjack or mozzarella cheese, and had blue cheese dressing & another bottle of Franks handy for anyone who wanted more of that buffalo wing flavor. Very good, will make again.

Oh mama!!  I am a sucker for a certain taste in buffalo chicken, and this one nails it!  The tangyness, the spicyness, but also the mellowing flavour of the ranch... it all comes together in this recipe, and it's SO EASY!  Tried it for the first time last week, only change I made was the cooking process... I cooked it for about 4 1/2 hours, then shredded the chicken and added the butter, then back in the crock pot for another hour or so.  Delicious!  Had it for lunch sandwiches all week... kaiser bun, lettuce, mozza cheese, and a healthy scoop of the shredded chicken.    Would also be good simply eaten by itself as sliced chicken, or on pizza.

I loved this, and I made it as written however I liked the meat over a salad versus the sandwich idea.  My boyfriend loved it as a sandwich.  I had left overs so I had buffalo chicken salad's all week.  They were great.

I have made this several times for my friends and they love it. I simmer the chicken in vegetable broth in the slow cooker until the meat falls apart when I shred it. I put the shredded chicken in a bowl and I stir in Frank's Buffalo sauce to taste. I don't bother with the ranch seasoning, although it might add extra flavor. I pile the meat onto hoagie rolls, top with cheese, and broil them for a couple minutes. Yum!

Yumm,  I through two breast and two thigh leg combos in there and it turned out great, once it was done cooking the meat just fell off the bone so I was able to shred it.  I used a 12 oz bottle and had plenty of sauce.  I served it at a pot luck and it went over really well the only thing I would do differently is label it because of wimps. lol

This was excellent. My chicken breasts were frozen and I needed to speed up cooking time, so I cooked for 2 hours on high with chicken stock.  Then I drained stock and added recipe ingredients.  Cooked for 2.5 hours on low.  I added a little more buffalo sauce (I only had a 12 oz bottle and had to run out for more) and thinly sliced onion the last 45 minutes of cooking time. I used sausage rolls and  I topped it with provolone cheese, lettuce and ranch dressing.  My 11 year old daughter came back for another!  We will definately eat this again!

Instead of a sandwich, I topped it with cheddar and used it for a dip.  Dipping celery in it is fantastic and diet friendly.

Good stuff!  I used 6 breast pieces and the whole bottle of sauce -- Frank's Original buffalo wing sauce.  We served them on fresh ciabatta rolls with Provolone cheese melted on top.  They have a nice kick without being overly spicy.  I will try using the whole packet of ranch mix next time.

I'm a huge fan of buffalo flavor anything, and this was really good.  I made the mistake of dumping out all of the marinade before I shredded, next time I'll keep about half.  I defrosted the chicken breast the night before, so that cut my cooking time down to about 5 hours.

I'm not sure what went wrong given how simple the recipe is, but this turned out WAY too salty I used about 13 oz of Frank's hot buffalo wing sauce, about 2/3 a pack of ranch dressing mix, and 1.5 lbs of chicken. I shredded the chicken while in the marinade as someone else suggested and that may have been the problem.

My family LOVES this recipe!! It is super easy to throw in the crockpot before work using the bagged, flash frozen chicken breast.  I usually use the entire bag but then I have 3 teenage boys at home.

great recipe!  so simple.  my chicken breasts were frozen, but they cooked right up in around 5 hours on low.  i shredded the meat with a fork, added the butter, and an hour later, we're good to go.  i just used a bottle of the safeway brand buffalo wing marinade, and it came out great.   enough kick without lighting my mouth on fire!  fiance loved it!

Delicious! Simple and easy to make, satisfied our buffalo chicken cravings and wasn't as terrible for you as eating wings. I cooked for 4 hours and then did some shredding, cooked for another 1-2 hours and finished shredding after that, so that the pieces could cook in the sauce. I will definitely be making this again!

Great recipe!  My husband loved it!  I used fresh chicken and it only took 4-5 hours.  I also shreaded it (as another review mentioned) and then returned it to the slow cooker for another 45 minutes or so to let it absorb the yummy sauce.

I used 2 frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts. After 4.5 hours they were done so I just set the crock pot to warm rather than low so as to avoid the chicken drying out. These were AWESOME. I will be making this quite often now. I only used 1 tbsp. of butter and that was plenty.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out GREAT!  Very tender, moist, and spicy!!!  I do think the sauce you use will determine on whether you like it or not, so try to find one that suits your taste.  Will def. be making this again!

Wow, this was good.  Super easy to boot!  I followed the recipe exactly except for using the entire envelope of ranch as opposed to half.  I also didn't use "wing" sauce per se...I used a Louisiana red pepper sauce (Tate's) and only used about 1/2 the bottle total because I didn't want to burn the kids' tongues off.  At any rate it was FANTASTIC.  We had on wheat hoagie rolls w/blue cheese crumbles (ranch for the kids) and letttuce and tomato - sweet potato fries and fresh strawberries on the side. My husband and 3 boys think I am a genius...thanks Divinesoalce21!!!!!!

Awesome, made this for my sons and they loved it!! Not salty or too spicy. I think the key is to use Frank's Wing Sauce. They asked to have this every Friday after work.

Excellent recipe, very different--will definately make this one again.  Needed to use a sturdy bun for this--overall was very pleased with how it turned out.  Will recommend to friends for sure!  Picky hubby loved it!  A friend of mine suggested using the leftovers on a Buffalo Chicken Pizza!

This was the easiest thing I have ever made!!  I used 5 chicken breasts, it fed a family of 8, had plenty of leftovers, and everyone loved it! Instead of using plain dry ranch, I also used the spicy version.. It was so good, I'm making it again for extended family this weekend! It wasn't as 'hot' as I expected, but it did have a kick

Oh my heavens....yummm!  I was nervous with some of the negative reviews as I did not have a backup plan for dinner.  I did switch some things up based on some of the reviews and my instinct.  I put the chicken (fresh not frozen) in the crockpot in 2 cups chicken broth for 4 hours.  I drained and shredded the chicken and returned it to the pot with 8 oz of wing sauce for another hour and half or so.  It was perfect!  Not to hot, not too wet, not at all vinegary.  If you like wings you would love this.  I served it on a roll with extra wing sauce at the table, blue cheese dressing and a salad on the side.  It felt like a reasonable healthy indulgence.

Simple, and amazing.  I used about 5 lbs of chicken, 2 bottles of buffalo sauce and 1 1/2 packets of ranch.  I used frozen chicken, put it all in the crock pot the night before to thaw in the fridge.  popped in the crock pot on low for 6 hours, and perfect!  I forgot to add the butter, and they were still perfect!  Everyone asked me for the recipe....  It was awesome, and I will be making this a staple in my house!

These sandwiches were a hit! My husband absolutley loved these. I used 5 frozen chicken breast and cooked on high for one hour and on low for four hours. I then shredded the chicken and let it cook another hour to absorb the sauce. I served them on garlic bread with crumbled blue cheese on top. Yummy! Thank you for this recipe I will be using often!

BIG TIP: Forget the sandwiches.  I essentially used this buffalo chicken with the "Hot 'n' Spicy Buffalo Chicken Salad" recipe on this site, and it was TO DIE FOR.  As for the chicken, I used Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Wing marinade/sauce, and it was wonderful.  My chicken, which was put in as two whole frozen breasts, was more than done (i.e. a little dry) in five and a half hours.  Next time I think I'll check it at four hours to prevent drying.

I really love buffalo wings and pulled pork, but I definitely do not recommend following this recipie to the T.  I used almost a full 2 pounds of chicken breast tenderloins for this, and half of the hot sauce it calls for. I did use 1/2 of a package of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix.  Overall everything came out waaaay to salty for my taste, and I cant even imagine with only 2 chicken breasts.    Next time I am going to try just cooking the chicken and adding the sauce to my taste, probably just going to use some ranch dressing too.  Way too much sodium in the hot sauce and ranch seasoning.

Delicious, and a family favorite!  So good!!  I use a full packet of dry ranch instead of just half for more flavor.  Frank's Red Hot original is the best sauce for this if you have kids that like spicy but don't like it super hot.

This was good, but based on most of the reviews, I guess I thought it would be great.  I used a cup or so of chicken broth, and only half a bottle of wing sauce and I added the butter at the beginning.  also added some bottled ranch dressing so it wouldn't be too salty as the package dressing tend to be very salty.  Got home, shredded and added a little more sauce and let it simmer for 45 minutes. Toasted some kaiser rolls on the stove and added some more dressing onto the sandwich.  It really does absorb much more of the flavor after it's shredded. Like I said, this was pretty good, but I was expecting more.  Will make again from time to time.

I love buffalo chicken and this was great and so easy.  I used the whole package of ranch dressing mix and did not use the butter, there was no need to use it.  It was great on toasted bread with some monterey jack cheese.

My husband loves buffalo chicken, it is much too spicy for me, so I made this for him. He stated that it was almost a but too strong for him. His thought was that it would be better if the hot sauce was not put in until an hour before serving, we will try this next time.

I agree that it was WAY too salty, but I made it for a birthday party and EVERYONE was asking me for the recipe!  It's a matter of taste.  I may try what someone else suggested and use a little water or add some sour cream to cut down the salt a little.  I'm not sure what caused the saltiness more, the ranch dressing seasoning or the Frank's sauce.  Will try it again until I get it right.  Can't wait to make these for superbowl next year!

This was a HUGE hit in our house. I omitted the ranch seasoning and instead lightly seasoned the chicken with garlic, salt and pepper. I added the butter (which I melted) in the beginning. I also added a little bit of water. It turned out SO well. YUM! I can't wait to make this again.

Overall I thought this was a good idea and I did like it - however, between the hot sauce and ranch mix, it was just way too salty for my taste. I think next time I will cook the chicken in less hot sauce and replace some of it with low sodium chicken broth and just up the heat level by adding a smaller amount of hotter sauce or some fresh chiles.

This was ok.  You really need to like straight buffalo wing sauce.  My husband compared it to drinking the Franks sauce straight out of the bottle.  If you like flavor and not just heat then I would pass.

Hubby loved this so much, he said i can make this whenever I want! toasted hoagie buns and put provolone cheese on while toasting, also I put in two, well, glops of sour cream into chicken mixture to tone it down just a little, as I knew the kids wouldnt like it too spicy. I am not a big fan of buff. wings, but I actually liked this. And talk about EASYYYYY!. I did do as another reviewer suggested, and I shredded the chicken about 1.5 hours before it was to be served, it soaked up the sauce much better that way.

Very good base recipe, but needed some tweaking.  These are our KID FRIENDLY, LOW SODIUM tweaks:  We mixed 3/4 cup Frank's Red Hot Wing sauce, 1/4 water, and 1 tbsp. of Ranch seasoning.  I coated the chicken in garlic powder and black pepper too and poured the sauce mixture in with chicken.    Cooked all day (8-9 hours) on low; with mostly frozen chicken though.  Removed chicken and poured sauce out of slow cooker.  Added chicken back in and slow added sauce back until it was to the consistency I liked.  The chicken was a little dry on it's own and the mush factor was there, but it was still good.    I used some of the Ranch seasoning to make a Ranch coleslaw to top the sandwiches (slaw mix, mayo, milk and Ranch seasoning), YUM!  We used Muenster cheese too.  My husband and I added more wing sauce on ours, but our kids ate them just fine as is.    All in all a good recipe!

Well, too spicy for me. I tried to tone it down by using my sisters yummy recipe for wing sauce (you'll have to look at my reviews, it's not published yet..."best wild wings sauce" by hockeymom089, basically adding sour cream, mayo, and lemon juice. The chicken was nice and tender, the flavor was great, but the afterkick was a bit too much for me..maybe because it was marinated in the sauce. If you like spicy, try it

We live in Italy and the Super Bowl is on in the wee hours of the morning so we eat "football" food all day long while we wait for the game to come on.   This made an excellent dinner and since there is just my husband and I, we have had it for lunch a couple of times and it is just as good as a leftover.  I will definitely be making this again and I will send the receipe to my kids.  This is a keeper!

I only used about 3/4 of a cup of wing sauce in the crockpot so that it wasn't too hot for my 2 and 4 year olds.  Everyone LOVED this!  I am re-prising it this weekend for our superbowl party and my hubby has been talking it up to his friends all week!

Please, please, please listen and use the correct amount of chicken breast with this recipe. Especially if you use Franks hot sauce, which my family loves.  I used 1 chicken breast less and the spice it gave this recipe was overwhelming for my kids.   My husband I love spicy food so we did okay.  It can definitely be used as party food with Alcohol because it will sober up even the most enebriated person!  Outstanding flavor and the crockpot is my bestfriend!!!  Thanks a definite keeper!

Delicious! All 4 of my kids enjoyed this!!!  This will be a regular menu item now!  I only used 1/3 bottle of sauce, added some water & a full packet of the ranch mix.   I poured it over the chicken and baked the chicken in the oven at 325 for about 2.5 hours.  Half way thru, I shredded the chicken.  I made homemade rolls & added shredded cheese with a salad...YUMMY!

The chicken came out amazingly tender.  Sadly, the wing sauce I used was way too hot and it was almost painful to eat.  I will definitely try again with a milder sauce.

My husband is from Philly and we always grab cheesesteaks when we visit his family, my favorite variety being the buffalo chicken cheesesteak. Although this isn't grilled (I guess I could throw it on the stove to brown it up a bit), the flavor is as close as I can get at home! I doubled the recipe and topped it with a little blue cheese dressing. Delicious!

Great recipe! We loved it! I used the whole packet of ranch mix instead of 1/2, and I also added a little water (maybe 1/4 cup) to the hot sauce bottle to shake out all the good stuff, and poured it right into the crock pot. I also made a batch of Buffalo Chicken Dip to serve with the sandwiches. We will for sure make this recipe again!

Easy and tasty.  This worked well even for just 2 chicken breasts and adjusting per the recalculated amounts of sauce & dressing mix.
UPDATE:  I wanted to make this again, but knew it would dry out in the  crockpot during my long workday.  So I baked it ocvered in 325 degree oven for 1 hr. before I shredded it and put the balance of the sauce on.  It turned out perfectly.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe.  I love all things buffalo, and had high hopes for it.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I have to say it was missing something.  And even though I'm only rating it three stars, I'd probably make it again, but try to jazz it up a bit.  I may butter and toast the rolls and possibly serve it with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, and blue cheese or ranch dressing.  I'm not going to give up on it just yet, but I'll definitely try and tweak it to our tastes.

We really liked these sandwiches.  I put everything in the crock pot before we went Christmas shopping and when we got home they were done.  My husband bought the wing sauce and although we usually like things pretty spice - he bought the HOT and it was just a little much.  We will definitely make again but with a milder sauce!

Excellent!!!  My 10 year old son loves buffalo chicken and this was a huge hit with him.  I toped it with blue cheese dressing.  It was delicious. Thanks for a great recipe

This was great, but very messy!!! It was my first time using a Crock Pot and I am still amazed at how easy it was.  I omitted the ranch salad dressing mix and the butter.  After reading the other reviews, it didn't seem to add much to the recipe other than to make it saltier.  I used two different wing sauces: Frank's Red Hot Wing Sauce and Stubb's Wing Sauce.  I recommend this combination because Frank's gives the chicken the classic buffalo flavor and color, while Stubb's gives more depth to the flavor.  Served it with blue cheese crumbles and blue cheese dressing on sesame potato rolls. The bf loved it!

Although I am not normally a fan of buffalo chicken, these sandwiches rock!!  I shredded the chicken after 6 hours and added diced onion and let it cook another 2 hours.  I also used about 3/4 of the ranch packet instead of 1/2.  I omitted the butter and they still turned out GREAT.  Topped the buns with provolone and romaine. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good easy recipe.  I made it exactly as shown.  I felt like it needed a little something.  I poured a little blue cheese dressing on my sandwich, which I thought helped.  Maybe I'll try some different sauces, too.  It's definitely a keeper, but one I think I'll monkey around with a little to get it more to my liking.  Thanks for posting!

This was SO GOOD!  I did cut the spicy by diluting the Frank's redhot wing sauce with chicken stock and a packet of ranch dressing mix for the first 2.5 hours.  I then drained the chicken, added butter, new hot sauce, and 1/2 a new packet of ranch dressing mix- I also shredded the chicken at this point.   Cooked for another 2 hours and it was perfect!  THANK you for this recipe idea and this is in the rotation - especially for football Sundays...Can't wait to try the leftovers on pizza...

Hmmmm. I know many reviewers have been quite impressed with this, but I wasn't :-( My fiance and I were invited to a friends house to watch yesterday's U of IA vs. Ohio State football game and I wanted to bring something to "munch" on. Buffalo wings are usually a good game watching food, but I don't like them. When I saw this recipe, I thought it would be perfect - and filling! I guess I just don't care for the sandwich idea.... On second thought, when I go to BWW or Hooter's, I usually don't order "plain" (boneless) wings - I go for spicy garlic, mango habanero, etc. The hot sauce taste (I used Pete's wing sauce) was overwhelming, IMHO. I was hoping to taste a bit of 'zing' from the Ranch, but it was nonexistent (there doesn't seem to be much point in adding it... perhaps adding the entire packet would do the trick???). I also think that had I had toasted my kaiser rolls so they weren't so soft (which is great for hamburgers, but not for this; it just soaded thru the bun) these would have been better???? Oh, and I topped my sandwich with blue cheese dressing, but didn't really care for that either. I'm glad I didn't go thru the trouble of making it homemade. I might make this in the future (prep couldn't be easier - and frozen chicken breasts work great in the sc!) for buffalo chicken pizza, but wouldn't again if not for that. Thanks anyways :)

This was yummy!  I didnt have wing sauce.  So I used straight hot sauce with butter added to tone it down a bit.  I used franks, its the best!  I did add a little more seasoning to it to flavor it well.  I cooked on low for an hour and high for 4 hours total.  It was nice and spicy!  I topped our sandwiches with some melted swiss cheese.  This would also be great with some crunchy coleslaw on top.  Very good and versatile.  I will be making this again and next time using the franks wing sauce!  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy, good... I used regular bottled ranch dressing in place of the ranch seasoning (didn't have any on hand) Very spicy, a good alternative to BBQ pork or chicken sandwiches.

OMGoodness!  So good.  I tasted it in the crock pot, and it was good, but I was a tad dissappointed.  When I made it into sandwiches for dinner, it was a million times better on a toasted and buttered sandwich roll with a slice of colby jack.  We'll have this again one day...when we get over the sodium rush! =)

This was sooo easy & quick to prepare I did it on my lunch hour!! I loved how quick it went together & easy it was!! I'm a big spice lover & this was a bit spicy even for me!! I think it was a little too much hot sauce & that it could use some BBQ sauce to help tone it down a bit. Other than it being way over spicy its a great idea it just needs a little modifications. I think I will try this one again I'll just do it a little diffrently next time!

It was a good sandwich granted but it certainly wasn't HOT like everybody says, maybe it was the brand, anyway, I still liked it,I left  the chicken whole tonight and tried it like that. Way too slip sliding away, I'll try it chopped up next time.

Went on allrecipes.com today to print out a recipe I am making this weekend and saw this on one the home page.  Didn't know what to make for dinner tonight anyway.  Noticed I had just enough time to throw it in the crock pot and the best part was, I had all the ingredients!!!!  I only had 3 chkn brsts so I think I used too much sauce.  But even still, made no changes and OMG!!!  SOOO GOOD!!!  Thanks so much!!!

Oops I just realized we used a whole pkg of ranch drsg mix...but it was great!  Very spicy (I used Ken's wing sauce) but we slathered our buns with bleu cheese dressing which helped cancel out some of the heat.  A great Saturday supper!

Very good! I used a whole chicken, but other than that kept it the same. It was a little dry so I added a little broth. I think next time I will try using ranch dressing instead of the dry mix.

This was really good and REALLY easy.  I used Budweiser wing sauce, which was a bit too tangy.  Next time I'll try Frank's Red Hot, but there will for sure be a next time!

This was FANTASTIC!!  I'm the only one at my house who likes buffalo sauce so I made this for me and can't wait to make it again.  The only complaint I had is that it is really salty.  I think next time I will try to find a low sodium sauce.

This is a tasty and easy recipe.  I have made it several times and it's always a hit.  It great for a fall football party.  I don't ever add the butter, b/c I don't want to add the fat.  I've use the leftovers to make pizza, now everytime I want to be sure to have leftovers.  The pizza is even better than the sandwiches!!

The way it came out for me it did not impress me too much. I think I used too hot of a buffalo sauce. I tried to tone it down, but it seemed to be a lost cause, and I ended up throwing a good portion away. If I were to make this again, I would use a milder buffalo sauce and possible add the prepared ranch dressing in as another suggested instead of just the powdered mix.

I added some chicken broth as others advised. Waaaay too liquidy. You may need the broth if using fresh chicken. The added water in the frozen chicken breasts was more than enough. I also recommend the Franks Hot Sauce vs. the Franks Wing Sauce. Less sodium.

Very tasty recipe! It tasted just as I had expected and had the flavor I was craving! It was spicy, but not an overwhelming kind of heat that keeps you from eating more!  I served it on ciabatta rolls with cheddar cheese and ranch with celery sticks on the side.  I cooked it just as stated.  I think if you're facing it being too runny reduce the sauce by a bit and make sure you cook the entire time.  Thanks for the recipe!

My Husband and three kids loved this. I used a mild buffalo wing sauce and fresh chicken. Cooked in about 3 hours on high. Added some cheese to the buns and put them under the broiler to toast and melt the cheese. Before dinner was even finished they were all asking me to make it again. So easy and tasty.

This recipe was great, but I did reduce the hot sauce by 1/2 which was perfect for me.  With left-overs make mini pizzas: top whole wheat pita with ranch dressing, chicken, cheddar cheese, olives, green peppers, and any drizzle with EVOO.  Bake on 400 for 12-15mins!

This recipe did not specify what kind of buffalo sauce so I used hot sauce and butter like another member. It was so hot that boyfriend and I couldn't even eat them. Sorry loved the idea though.

These were great.  Husband loved them.  I used regular franks hot sauce instead of the wing sauce to cut sodium a little and didn't add the butter.  we did not find them messy at all.

These were really good! The only things I did different were: cooked the frozen chicken breasts on High for 4 and a half hours, shredded them up about 3 hours into cooking, and used a bottle of Frank's Hot Sauce instead of Buffalo Sauce because it was all I had. My husband LOVED them!

We enjoyed this. I left out the butter at the end, to lower calories. It was still very good. We topped ours with bleu cheese dressing. This was a very low-fuss recipe! EDIT 5/06/10: I've made this several times. I find it helps to dump most of the juice right before the shredding step. You add more fresh sauce (the remaining 1/4 of the jar) at the end for flavor anyway. Thanks again for the recipe, we love this one!

AWESOME!  So easy since the chicken goes in frozen.  I used ranch salad dressing from the bottle since I didn't have dry mix and it came out so delicious and moist.  The chicken practically fell apart.  Yum!

Really yummy! My husband ate three sandwhiches and I really enjoyed it.  Since I am a little bit of a whimp I added chicken broth in with the sauce and ranch.  I also had fresh chicken on hand so I cooked it for 4 hours on high, at the 3 hour mark I took it out and shredded the chicken and put it back in the pot for one more hour.  Topped the chicken with blue cheese dressing.  It made a tom enough for leftovers.  I will make this again.

Five stars! I did only use about 10 oz. of sauce and 1 cup of water instead of the full amount of sauce. I knew my family couldn't handle the spice. It came out great--everyone ate it, including my 1 year old!!! I just added extra sauce to mine when I put my sandwich together. Loved it!

Definitely good and healthier than traditional wings. I only used about 1 T dry ranch seasoning.  I added about 1-2 T each of honey, Worcestershire, and red wine vinegar. Finally I put a small can of low sodium chicken broth in with the hot sauce.  Instead of shredding I cut the cooked chicken breasts into large chunks and then returned it to the crock pot with 2+ T butter and placed on the warm setting.  Served on homemade buns (toasted with butter), with sliced sharp cheddar cheese, and slathered with a mixture of sour cream/spicy ranch dressing.  Didn't find this too salty.

This was so yummy and so easy. I used 3/4 bottle (12 fl oz bottle) buffalo sauce, 1/2 bottle (8 fl oz bottle) ranch dressing, & 6 breast halves (1 pound). Put all at once in the slow cooker for 2 hours. Shred the chicken, add 1/2 stick butter, put on low for further 2 hours, then served it with ranch dressing on burger buns. So yummy!

This recipe was really great.  The only thing was the cooking time for my slow cooker ended up being too long, and the chicken dried out.  About an hour and a half less and it would have been perfect.

Hubby loved this. I followed the recipe exactly and we did not find it too salty. Was a little spicy but oh so good and went great with a cold beer! :) We will definitely be putting this in with our regular routine recipes.

I love the fact that this recipe uses frozen chicken breasts. Just throw it all in together and forget it! The chicken was super tender and very easy to shred. The flavor was outstanding!

This is always a hit in my house! My hubby and his friends cannot get enough and it's SO easy! I usually combine this recipe with one from Rachael Ray so I add 2 tbsp. of red wine vinegar, 2 tbsp. brown sugar, some worcestershire sauce, 1 cup of chicken stock and 1c. of tomato sauce. I know it sounds like a lot but it's still just opening cans and throwing it all in! And it's amazing!

This one is a for sure keeper!  Easy and delicious.  Use a good "sturdy" bun to pile the chicken on otherwise it can be a messy sandwich.  I used a soft potato like roll, and while good, I had to finish up with a fork.  It was worth it!

This was a good recipe. The only problem I had was it was too salty. The dry ranch dip package I used was a little less than what the recipe called for and I used Frank's wing sauce which is only a 12oz. bottle. I didn't even put all of the sauce in there because I wanted to reserve some to go on the sandwiches. After it was done I tasted the sauce and it was very salty so I spooned about half of the sauce out and it was still too salty. And I actually tend to like more salty flavors. I really liked it otherwise. Gotta say it was still very moist. Don't really know what to do next time to make better. Any suggestions?

This was a huge hit at a family dinner.  As some other reviewers suggested, I like to shred my meat before it is finished cooking so it better absorbs the sauce.  I shredded after about 5 hours.

made this the other night and family just loved it! Its a bit messy but the flavors are really good. Will make this again. My son suggested next time to leave the chicken breasts whole and place on sandwich, not a bad idea? Might try it that way too.

This was phenomenal.  We used a mix of thigh and breast meat because we like dark moist meat.  We also added honey to cut down the spice a bit, then we topped it with provolone.  It was delicious!

This dish was great.  Tasted just like buffalo hot wings.  Nice and spicy. I really enjoyed it.  Not to mention how easy it was to prepare.  Just throw it in the crock pot. I see myself definitely making it again and again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was excellent.  I took just the meat and put it on a pre-made pizza crust with ranch dressing as the pizza sauce and topped it with mozz. cheese and put it in the oven until the cheese was melted.  Super great, super easy, and HEAVENLY!

I thought this was a pretty good dish. Many recipes neglect to tell you if you might want to add additional seasoining to the meal, based on your tase, so I never know what to do in that case. I ultimately added a little too much season all, but I'll definitely know for next time.

This was very very good, instead of using the dry dressing mix, I put in a little over 1/2 a bottle of chunky blue cheese dressing.  Served to 3 different people and they loved it.  Thought it would also make awesome chicken nachos

The chicken came out moist, tender and spicy but it was way too salty.  I put sour cream on it which helped to cut the saltiness.  I used Frank's hot sauce and Hidden Valley Ranch mix.

Delicious!  I used "Texas Pete's Buffalo Chicken Wing Sauce," which I love.  I didn't use the butter because the meat was plently moist.  Leftovers are great for the delicious buffalo chicken pizza at allrecipes.  If not in the mood for a sandwich, it's great over pasta and in tortilla wraps, too.

These were GOOOOD!! I used a combo of 1/2 franks hot sauce and 1/2 Lawry's Buffalo bbq, and regular bottled ranch dressing! I also put the chicken in thawed out so they only took like 3 hours on high! End result was great!! :)

These were awesome!! I served on french bread mini loaves topped with no guilt zesty ranch from this site with a bit of lettuce. I also used plain franks red hot sauce instead of wing sauce because of the already added salt to the wing sauce. We didn't find them too salty. Thx for the easy and yummy recipe.

Easy, no fuss recipe.  It was all in the crockpot in no time.  Sandwiches turned out good.  Wish it was not soo salty.  If we make it again, we would skip the dry ranch dressing mix and use only the buffalo wing sauce for cooking.  This may cut down on saltiness.

My friends & I were headed to the beach for a few hours, so I threw this in the slow cooker (which took 5 minutes to do, if that) and when we came home it was ready to go.  Everyone LOVED it!  Made just as the recipe specified & wouldn't change a thing.  :)

this sandwich was really tasty.  Just the right amount of spice.  My husband loves it.  Adding the sauce to the sandwich at the end was a good idea.

Very good. Just some notes. Used 1 whole bottle of Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce (12oz), put in the butter up-front along with Ranch. 2lbs of chicken breasts (frozen Purdue). Way too much sauce, could have used more chicken, or less sauce. Shredded chicken after 4 hours, was cooked through in 5. No way was this dry unless you were cooking w/o the lid on. Chicken was tender and flavorful, good but needs something more next time. Maybe serve it over rice with some veggies. Thanks!

Wonderful.  The whole family loved them. I used the whole packet of Ranch, and when I took the chicken out to shred it i added a little cornstarch to thicken up the sauce.  Everyone says that it tastes just like hooters buffalo chicken sandwiches!

I think I'd try bone in chicken next time for more flavor and tender meat. I topped the sandwich with coleslaw mixed with blue cheese dressing.

i actually made this in a pressure cooker because i don't own a slow cooker, but was curious enough to try the recipe anyway.  it was my first time using a pressure cook so i was a little worried.  fortunately, i was pleasantly surprised.  this came out great even in a pressure cooker.  i will definitely be making this again.

Love this recipe! And what could be easier than tossing frozen chicken in a crock pot?!  I made it with Frank's Red Hot, and tossed in a bit of regular ranch dressing, as that's all I had, and it came out perfect...the hubby loved it!  As far as spicy, well, we consider Buffalo sauce to be pretty mild....we tossed some Tabasco on our sandwiches, too, for a little more kick. And some blue cheese dressing & lettuce...YUMMMM!  Definitely a recipe I'll use again and again.  :)

My husband loves hot wings and basically anything spicy.  He did not care for these at all.  He never took a second sandwich and he'll eat just about anything.  I had to dump it out. Could have just been texture or something.

Made this last Friday. To eat over the course of the weekend and lunch for the week. Since we have a busy baseball player sometimes it hard to get a good lunch in. This was quick to throw togther and let go and then come home and have to eat. Will make time and time again!

Bless the crock pot, this was good! We had these with no bread and they were very good, just like eating chicken wings without the bones. I was able to cut down on the cooking time by using chicken tenderloins instead of the breasts, just used more of them.They were ready in 5 hours. Thanks!UPDATE!! The leftovers are great on top of baked potato wedges and melted cheese with ranch (or blue cheese)-yummy!!!

Delicious! I can't believe we haven't thought of this idea bc we live off of buffalo sauce. Great with some shredded cheese on top and you MUST try it with Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo Sauce (R)!! A definate keeper to through and crock before work and go!

Very good and much healthier than fried wings.  I accidently used the whole packet of ranch dressing so it was a little salty.  I put a little crumbled blue cheese on my roll and topped with the chicken.  Excellent.  Thank you for sharing!!

A little on the salty side (could have been the sauce I used, maybe a little less ranch seasoning). I will make it again. I might try a little crumbled blue cheese on it.

DH said it was definitely a 4 star; but not a 5 star.  (Probably because I omitted the butter which seemed like too much.)  Served with swiss cheese, sliced red onion and sour cream. Yummy; will make again.

I am eating this right now and it is fantastic!  Like a nice spicy buffalo wing right on a bun...only no bones or fat.  Followed ingredients exactly but put everything in including butter at the beginning.  Cooked for about 6 hours, shredded and tossed back in the sauce to soak it up.  Could not have been easier and great end result.  Will definitely be doing for football season.  Used Texas Pete wing sauce since I've had some in the pantry for a LONG time and it is the perfect amount of spice.

I made it using Buffalo and also a mild sauce version. There is regular chicken salad in the background of the picture from a different recipe. This was SUPER spicy and ABSOLUTELY amazing. The smell and the taste. TWO THUMBS UP!!!

I made sure to buy the Frank's WING sauce instead of Frank's HOT sauce. We did not need to add any of the reserved sauce to the sandwiches because the chicken was hot enough with the amount already on it. I may increase the butter a little next time. I made ranch dressing to serve with the sandwiches.

It was absolutely amazing, but if you can’t handle spicy foods make sure you get mild buffalo sauce.

Tender, juicy, scrumptious chicken.     I didn't add the butter.
Served over lettuce, tomato and shredded cheese salad.  drizzled some of the sauce it cooked in over the shredded chicken.  Wonderful!

Good.  Made in the Instant Pot instead of the crockpot.  Also toasted the bun in the oven (with cheese) before hand then added the chicken and baked 5 minutes more. Added ranch to top it off.  You could really do this with any chicken wing sauce combo.

I made this and the taste was pretty good. But the chicken came out a bit dry and a bit difficult to chew. I expected this to be a melt in your mouth kind of thing and it did not reach my expectations.

I've been making this recipe for about two years now and my sons (ages 12 & 15) ask me to make this all the time!  My husband enjoys it also.  It's so easy and oftentimes I'll just make some rice to go along with it and a vegetable and they like it this way just as much as eating as a sandwich.  I'm not crazy about buffalo sauce myself, so when shredding it I will just keep some aside for myself before I add back to the sauce.  Great, easy recipe!

I enjoyed it, but the additional butter was overkill. The butter in the hot sauce is sufficient.

You may also want to be aware that putting this much hot sauce in a pressure cooker will fill the air with spicy. My partner was coughing up a storm while it cooked.

It was very good & doesn't get much easier than this. I used Hooters wing sauce & Hawaiian hamburger buns.

These are so easy and so delicious! Just throw everything in and go to work, and come home to dinner!! The only adjustment I made was adding a cup of chicken broth when I added all the other ingredients. The first time I made it, my husband and son found them to be too spicy, so this really helps tone the wing sauce down a bit, but still have a great flavor! I love to pair these with baked mac and cheese and green beans. Make them! Tonight! :)

Tasty Sandwich, mine was  a little strong, in flavor , but I believe that was my fault. My husband love it. I put ours on toasted onion buns . I added chunky blue cheese dressing, my husband used ranch and topped it with celery leaves

Tried this 3 times and got the same result each time.....dry cling to your mouth chicken.  Maybe I am doing something wrong but this was just not good, the flavor didn't penetrate the chicken and the sauce breaks down and needed rework after coming out of the crock pot......maybe I am just not a crock pot cooker........time to throw it out

I made this for dinner yesterday. It’s a fantastic recipe as is. We all devoured it! My only regret is not doubling the recipe for another meal. I will make this again and again! Toasting the buns makes all the difference, along with using a slotted spoon for serving to avoid the juiciness of a sloppy sandwich.

Made this exactly the way it was written. ...and it was WAY TOO SPICY and WAY TOO SALTY.  I tried to save the recipe by adding in some ingredients to counteract the ruined meal, first some cream cheese, (didn't work) then some more reg cheese, (nope) some lime juice.....we even added in rice to try and tame the spice and saltiness.  Nothing worked and we ended up throwing it out.

Okay, pretty bland though with the only two flavors. Tastes like a sandwich that's trying to be a chicken wing but isn't quite succeeding...

I absolutely love buffalo chicken wings.  I decided to halve this recipe as it’s only two of us. Instead of using our slow cooker, I decided to cook chicken in my Instant Pot  for an hour & 15 mins.  I used Franks but realized the 2 bottles I had were different labels. Aghast!! One was wing sauce the other Hot sauce.  I had already poured the hot sauce when I realized the difference. So note to self for future reference.  I then added the equal amount of Wing sauce.  I couldn’t wait to try it, it came out so tender & minimal shredding was needed.  I found it to be very spicy for my taste  & a bit salty but that could have been my fault due to the Hot sauce confusion. I  will update when I use the correct sauce in future.  Thank you for an easy meal!

I like the flavor, but I think I'd like it better with thighs. I like more fat on my chicken and I always had a little bit of a texture problem with breast meat. I'm on a low-carb diet and ate it without a bun, which may have made a big difference.

It was the best pulled chicken sandwich.i made this in my Instant Pot, it was done in less then 30 minutes also I used chicken thighs which is much better then breast. I pull on Hawaiian little rolls with homemade cole slaw and avocado. I forgot to take a photo as we were starving. Next time I will do this with pork shoulder.

I can't give this enough stars! I used four chicken breasts, 3/4 of a bottle of sweet baby rays buffalo sauce and a packet of hidden valley ranch dressing mix, low for six hours, then shredded it and returned it to crock pot (with the rest of the bottle of sauce) for an hour on warm. It was amazing! It has quite a kick but cheese and some ranch or mayo helps cut it back a bit. And I normally hate spicy things. Yum!!

Having made this for many years now, this is one of those failsafe recipes that's easily "tweakable" and great for serving a crowd. I always use thighs, as I find they're better suited for the crockpot. A bonus is that my crockpot is a beast and I can have this done from start to finish in 2 hours.  I use Frank's Red Hot sauce and serve on toasted onion buns with melted provolone, shredded lettuce, and a side of crispy onion rings. I keep bleu cheese dressing or crumbles on the side for those who want to add extras. Carmelized onions (or even raw for those like me who love raw onions)  make excellent toppings as well. This is made often at my house, and will continue on as a game day tradition!

This was one of my favorite sandwiches at a local restaurant, but they stopped making it, so I was very happy to find this recipe and even happier when I tasted it! I absolutely LOVED it and will definitely make again!

I added some finely diced red onion during the cooking. After I shredded the chicken I separated the chicken to add some Frank's Kickin' BBQ sauce in one batch, and regular Frank's Chicken Wing sauce in the other. Everyone loved both mixtures.

I have made this many many times and it always comes out great! I usually make coleslaw to put on the sandwiches and serve blue cheese dressing with it.  You can up the spice value by getting the HOT wing sauce, but make sure it's WON'T sauce, not just Tabasco sauce...

Buffalo chicken with 4 ingredients and one pot.  What's not to love.  We made exactly as written and we didn't find them too spicy at all  Although I never seem to need to cook my chicken as long as directions call for.

This was delish and not to mention super easy, as it only dirtied a few items! I added homemade garlic butter on each side and  broiled the hoagies in the oven in low. I also added provolone cheese and chopped romaine lettuce.

I have to give this recipe 5 stars.  It's ridiculously simple and tastes great exactly as written.  My hubby loves wings & I don't care for them,  so I made this as a comprise.  We both love it!  I like to put some blue cheese crumbles on mine.   This prime football food. :)

Really good. I froze half of it because it's makes so much. Made buffalo quesadilla the second time with Mexican cheese blend and dressing on the side.

I've made this a few times and recommend the following changes: I used boneless/skinless thighs instead of breast meat and omitted the butter as it is compensated by the extra fat content of the thighs. Almost any recipe for chicken breast can be improved by substituting the thigh which less expensive and more flavorful. I did try omitting the ranch dressing, because ordinarily ranch is an anathema to Buffalo wings (blue cheese all the way!), but it really works to add some flavors and umami to the preparation.

This was amazing the first time I made it. I didn't use buffalo sauce just normal. The second time I made the mistake of buying pre-shredded chicken that looked almost like ground beef. the consistency was ruined and it was awful. Stick with the high quality meat!

I thought the ranch seasoning might make it have a more interesting flavor but it still tasted like plain chicken with buffalo sauce.  Not bad but nothing to write home about either.

Easy recipe for the slow cooker. We added lettuce to the sandwich and it helped cut through the spicy flavor. I didn't need to add the extra sauce at the end, ours was spicy enough using the 3/4 bottle while cooking.

Just made this tonight.  Very good and takes almost no effort.  We didn't change anything really.

We topped with some provolone and some blue cheese.  
Looking forward to lunch tomorrow :)

I used Sweet Baby Rays Wing Sauce, omitted the butter, and strained & skimmed the fat from the cooking liquid after the chicken was done cooking.  I shredded the chicken and returned it to the slow cooker and added the strained cooking liquid & left over wing sauce back to the shredded chicken.

Substituted the ranch for cream cheese due to taste preferences. Had to add some flour to thicken it a bit, but it was amazingly delicious!

We did not care for this recipe at all.  I followed the directions as instructed but chicken came out way too saucy.  Sandwiches were soggy, even after toasting the hoagie buns.  The sauce was just really overwhelming; the level of sodium is also a concern for me personally.  I would not make this again.

This was awesome with the addition of the two tubs of whipped cream cheese that Michelle recommended in her review. It can also be used as a dip. I took it to work, and several people asked me for the recipe.

This is an easy, simple recipe to throw in the crockpot before work. I would definitely buy blue cheese crumbles or dressing next time to put on the sandwich with the chicken or is it a bit one-note. My son loved it though and I will definitely make it again.

This is probably my husbands favorite dish and it seriously could not be more easy. I follow the recipe exactly, but add a little bit of garlic powder. I sprinkle blue cheese on top of mine and he tops his with ranch dressing. Seriously SO GOOD. We cook this at least 2 times a month. 
TIP: Use the baby rays creamy buffalo sauce. It's PERFECT with this.

Very good, and very easy.  The first time I was a bit nervous about the meat ending up dry, so I made it using a total of about 3 lbs of chicken and dumped in about  20 oz of Franks buffalo sauce.  This resulted in a soupy, spicy-ish mix, which, while still delicious, was too wet.  The second time, I put in 5 lbs of chicken and about 12 oz of sauce.  Delish, but a bit short on spice/flavor.  I think the next time I make it, I'll aim for the middle - about 4 lbs of chicken and about 16 oz of sauce.  Also, to make it a bit healthier, I cut out the butter entirely both times...

So easy in the slow cooker but holy cow, was it spicy! I used Frank's Hot Buffalo sauce and it lived up to its name. It was tasty but my mouth was on fire and I couldn't quite finish my sandwich. Husband loved it. Will make again but might try a little milder sauce.

I wish there was a way to make this a little less salty, because otherwise these were perfect. I served with ranch dressing, blue cheese crumbles, and celery sticks on the side. So great.

Delicous! Spicy, but not too spicy. I did add 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I was afraid it would dry out while I was at work. I would only use 1/3 cup next time.

Very simple meal for a busy family.  I'm always looking for new, easy, not much prep slow cooker recipes.  This for sure fits the bill.  I turn on pot before bed it's done when I wake up.  We seldom eat as a family because of different sports we play.  This provides a tasty sandwich on the go.

It took me awhile to make it, but amazing!  I set my crockpot on high (because I'm not patient) for about 4-ish hours.  Came out perfect.  I served it with a slice of pepperjack and a smidge of ranch dressing.  Super easy and the flavors just meld together so well.

Great sandwiches, I added a can of diced tomatoes as another reader suggested. Served it with a side of blue cheese coleslaw.

My family really enjoyed this. It is important to use Frank's Buffalo sauce and not the regular Frank's hot sauce. I  used regular salad dressing because I didn't have any dry mix. I'm not sure why it is salty for some...that was not the case when I made it. 
I'll make it again.

Super easy to make, it was great for Super Bowl food, but will use it for other occasions . I look forward to making it and putting it in baked sweet potatoes.
We used iceberg lettuce, which worked well.

I added more hot sauce and some finely shredded cheddar cheese to the original recipe.  My family thought this recipe was a good start, but needed some additional tweaking for our own taste.

This was my first time trying to do something special for the Super Bowl. It is not an event that we go all out for. To me the chicken wing sauce did not have enough layers of flavor. It seemed just hot and that was pretty much it. Perhaps there are more flavorful sauces out there and I didn't choose the right one. I served it  in the hogie bun with a really good cole slaw on top to tone down the fire. Can anyone suggest a better sauce?

This is the best tasting, easiest thing I have ever made! The prep time says it takes 15 mins... I literally did it in under 3 and that was going slow! This is my new favorite dish.

this was so easy to make and was really tasty.  I love buffalo chicken and this was exactly as I wanted it to be.  I didn't change anything.  I made for the Super bowl and served with slider buns and buttermilk ranch dressing (made with the packet, not from the bottle).  Everyone loved it.

The chicken was salty, overcooked and dry, and being shredded was sloppy to pile on, halve and eat on halved Italian loaf. I was surprised there were no other ingredients suggested except more sauce so I added shredded lettuce, sliced tomato and red onion just to have something on it.  My family didn't care for it and we have plenty of dry, salty shredded chicken and sauce left over today.

Made this in place of hot wings.  Husband and Son LOVED it.  I did not use the butter, just hot sauce, ranch and chicken.  Used Blue Cheese Dressing and Crumbles on Whole Wheat Hoagie Roll.  Will be making this again and again.  :)

This was a great Super Bowl dinner.  Very easy and very delicious!  I used more chicken (about 4 breasts and 3 boneless thighs) and less of the wing sauce (12 ounce bottle).  My sauce did not evaporate and the chicken did not dry out.  Also, as someone else suggested, I made my own ranch seasoning (recipe from this site) because the prepackaged kind had way too much salt and other chemicals that I don't like to use.  We used onion rolls (personal preference).  We served this with cole slaw and blue cheese on the side.  Will definitely make this again.

I was so exited to try this and I have to say it was very easy to throw together and smelled divine while cooking.   I was somewhat disappointed in how it turned out. First off, way too salty.  Second, way too sloppy. I couldn't eat it like a sandwich so wind up doing open faced on buns. Overall it's ok but I don't think I will be making this one again.

I'm sure that it would be five stars just as written but I did change it a little. I used more chicken and a whole 12 oz bottle of Frank's wing sauce.I couldn't find ranch dressing mix that doesn't have msg, so I just sprinkled seasonings on top of the chicken (tarragon, lots of garlic powder, parsley, a little dill, dried onions) Then I poured the wing sauce over and cooked until the chicken could shred and added about 3tbs of unsalted butter at that point. after shredding we put it on toasted buttered French rolls and added shredded lettuce, blue cheese and drizzled with homemade buttermilk ranch dressing. It was very easy and tasted amazing. I will definitely make it again. I served purple coleslaw with it.

Not for the faint of heart.  I took a chance and made this for the football game yesterday.  It is HOT, HOT, HOT.  I toasted mini kaisers and added provolone to half, and sharp cheddar to half, but the meat was so spicy.  The crowd liked it, but you really need to like spicy foods to enjoy.

Try and use a hot sauce that does not have an extremely high sodium content. I used franks red hot sauce and it was way too salty. I would give it one star because it was so salty, but it may taste better with a different hot sauce.

Very good, it need more spice for my taste,
Add some lemon juice when you add the butter, gives an extra layer of flavor.
I browned out the chicken,  deglazed the pan with sauce before putting into the crockpot.

Amazing!!! So easy and tasty.
I had to make a few changes while cooking. My crockpot doesn't have a 6 hour low setting (and I was running short on time) so I set it to 6 hours on high and took it out after 3.5 hours. It was perfect! I used 2 lbs of chicken and a bottle of Frank's Red Hot Buffalo wing sauce, and a packet Hidden Valley Ranch.
I've been make buffalo chicken wraps for lunch all week! Yum!

I made this for the first time the other day after reading the comments of others and it came out fantastic.

I used equal parts thigh meat, equal parts breast meat, and I shredded the chicken after five hours so it could spend the last hour or so shredded in the sauce (Frank's Buffalo Sauce). 

It was phenomenal! Will definitely make again. ( Real winner with the boys on game day)

I subbed 1/3 cube cream cheese instead of the butter. Put them on pretzel buns to make sliders instead of hoagies. Served with celery and carrot sticks and cole slaw. Fantastic. Will do again.

So good and so easy.  It's very salty so I would add a little less ranch.

I made these for dinner last night and they were a hit! I also had to make it without butter and I only had ranch in the bottle. It came out delicious anyways, but would like to try it with butter and a ranch packet next time.

It tastes like you would imagine: chicken wing. Popular with the family. Used Franks Hot Sauce and it was spicy.

Absolutely delicious! My partner and I love it and it makes 2 or 3 meals for us (depending on how fat we decide to be.) 

If it is too spicy, use a milder sauce I guess. Sweet Baby Ray's and the Louisiana Buffalo Wing sauce are both great in my opinion! 

Tip: Don't shred with a fork, use a whisk (especially if you have a silicone one!). I've found that very effective.

I have made these numerous times. It's one of my go-to recipes. The heat depends on your wing sauce: we go between Sweet Baby Rays and Frank's. Chicken is always tender and easy to shred.  I don't use the extra sauce on top as I find there to be plenty in the crock pot. We throw a drizzle of ranch or blue cheese on top!

This recipe is great: 5 stars for ease of preparation, taste and versatility. I used chicken tenders instead of breasts, so I reduced my cooking time, and instead of traditional sandwiches, I made wraps with the chicken. It was delicious and I will be making this again!

This was pretty good, and super easy!  
Only change I made was to add chicken broth (& the butter) to the crock pot prior to cooking.  Served it with ranch for the sandwiches.  I liked it, but my husband loved it.  I'll make this at some point again.  Thanks for the quick, easy recipe!

You can cut the hotness by adding additional chicken broth, which I did when it was first started and then more once it was done. I don't see why we need to add the butter -- the flavor is there. P.S. Be sure and use Wing sauce, not hot sauce. I'm gonna use Ranch dressing on the buns.

Way too vinegary for me. Tried to tone it down by adding some sour cream.  Did not work. Could not eat. Had to throw it out.  Good idea but maybe with a different hot sauce.

I have to say I was skeptical at first this would be a crowd pleaser at my house, but I'm glad I tried it because my family loved this! Made as-is and served it with blue cheese dressing and extra buffalo wing sauce . My picky son-in-law even requested that I send the recipe to my daughter.

Oh my goodness this was so easy and sooooooo good!  I used a 2 1/2 pound bag of frozen chicken tenders, and mixed the 1/2 packet of ranch dressing mix with a whole bottle of buffalo sauce.  This was good tonight and we will enjoy the leftovers tomorrow (I'll make nachos with it).  WOW yes I will make this again.

Turns out that my "discriminating" SIL never stopped eating the chicken.  He pulled out the 'scoop' corn chips and polished it off.  
You have to realize that this is the equivalent of a really huge award - I'll let you know when it happens, but the red carpet will be at my doorstep very soon and I'm watching for it!

I am a  lifelong  spicy hot wing  lover all my life and  when I tried this the first time , it was ok but not to my particular  full hot chicken wing  liking  but knew it  had potential to be perfect,  so  when I made it a couple weeks later  I made It  a bit better , I  melted the butter, and poured it and all the other ingredients in a bowl, then added  1 tablespoon of vinegar and 4 drops of Dave's Insanity Sauce,. and mixed well, then poured it over  the  Chicken and  and then I let sit for 1/2  hours  to marinate .. and  when I had some ..it was as if I was in ecstasy.. Had it all, mouth watering  Flavor, perfect amount of heat & texture  perfect all the way around

Awesome recipe. ..but I did change a few things I used half a packet of Italian dry ranch with the  half a pack of the original kind I also put some chicken broth and half a cup of sour cream and I used Texas Pete wing sauce ( I don't like the wing sauce the recipe calls for) The recipe is fine just the way it is I've made it the original way before but I always add to recipe's I love to experiment with food but it's fine on it's own.

It was pretty spicy until we added the butter and the other half of the ranch packet.  I doubled the chicken and ranch packet,  and used the same amount of buffalo sauce and butter as the recipe states.  This was great but not super buffalo-y!  Served 9 adults with a good amount left over.

I've made this twice now and both times it was delicious!!! I got several remarks about how good it was! As someone else stated in there review, I also add cream cheese toward the end of cooking time to cut down on the heat a little. I myself love spicy hot food but not everyone I'm feeding does! Served on tortilla wraps with some cheese and blue cheese dressing! Yum!!!! Thanks for such an easy and delicious recipe!

Tasty and easy! I served it with a ranch celery slaw (slaw mix with light ranch and chopped celery) put on top of the meat and extra sauce on the buns/rolls  I like to toast the buns so they don't get too soggy.   Those that like bleu cheese can add some crumbles. This is a family favorite!

My new favorite crockpot recipe! I used only 3/4 of the bottle of wing sauce, and all of the packet of ranch (because why not?) and threw in a couple of boneless thighs to make it moister. Amazing stuff!

This was delicious, but I'm giving it a 5 b/c of its versatility. There was a lot left so the next day, I made a salad with bleu cheese crumbles, carrots, and a little oil and vinegar. Then, the next day, I made flat bread pizza with the chicken and melted cheddar on top.  Totally making this again.

I love, love, love this recipe! My boyfriend loved it and he made the comment that it would be great with some cheese. 
So the second time I modified it a little. 
I used one more chicken breast.
One whole packet of ranch dressing mix. 
1/4 bottle of ranch dressing
6 oz of mozzarella cheese.
Boyfriend added some more hot sauce to his sandwich.

These were very good, but a bit on the spicy side.  We made these exactly according to the recipe.  I think next time we will try some of the suggestions from other reviewers to cut down on the spice a bit.  The chicken however was wonderful.  Used 3 fresh boneless skinless chicken breasts and cooked on low for 6 hours. It came out nice and juicy and pulled apart easily.  Definitely will try again with some alterations.

I made this recipe using 2 pounds of chicken tenderloins. They were still slightly frozen when I put them in the slow cooker. I cooked them on low for four hours and they were perfectly done.  I served them over brown rice with veggies on the side for the first meal. After that I shredded them and served on rolls with pepper jack cheese melted on the sandwich. Very very delicious. Easy to make. I will definitely make this recipe again.

This was delicious. Followed recipe exactly. I put  4 breasts in pot with one 12 oz bottle Franks hot wing sauce.  Cooked perfectly after 6 hours on low.  Did not need additional sauce. I did place a layer of slaw on bottom of roll with a drizzle of ranch dressing over the top.  Very good.  Great for football game.   Heat level was just right. Served celery and carrot sticks with ranch dip for cool down.

Very simple, delicious meal! I used "Sweet Baby Ray's Marinade & Sauce - Buffalo Wing Sauce" since my boyfriend doesn't like things too spicy. It was the perfect amount of spice. Not too hot, but definitely has a kick.

I was excited to find this recipe, however unfortunately due to the overwhelming salt content it was not palatable. I followed the instructions exactly. Against my better judgement I added the ranch dressing powder, I am thinking that is where the excessive salt content  came from. Next time I will make it  without the ranch powder.

I used Sweet Baby Ray's Buffalo sauce and it turned out fantastic. The chicken shreds very nicely after being cooked in the slow cooker. I topped my sandwiches with pepper jack cheese and use some of the sauce as a dressing on the sandwiches to make them extra hot.

Sorry- this was way too spicy for my family. I think it could have been like the buffalo chicken dip, but missed key ingredients (i..e, cream cheese, cheese).

I ended up using a little bit less chicken, but didn't cut back on the buffalo sauce, so they ended up a bit more potent than I had planned. I loved them, but my husband thought they were a bit much. I also served them as sliders at my book club and the girls couldn't stop raving about them!

I've made this several times, it is a huge hit with my house full of boys.  But I admit I love it too.  I can eat the chicken straight from the crock.  It reheats well too, so plenty for leftovers is good.  We usually serve it on buns with pickles and blue cheese dressing.  We have also served it with Swiss Cheese slices.  Any way you serve it though, it will be great.

It was pretty tasty I used slider buns instead of hoagies. Also I seasoned the meat to my liking before putting in the slow cooker. Ate with some chips :)

It was great and everyone loved it. One thing, if you are use to and like Frank's branded hot sauce, use that. I used another brand and didn't like it but it wasn't my brand of hot sauce.

It was good. A literal HOT mess on a bun. Haha! You really need to like spicy buffalo sauce to enjoy this. I topped my sandwich with some ranch.

Instead of adding some extra buffalo sauce at the end, we topped ours with just a little ranch. It was a good dish, but gets a bump for convenience!

Excellent!  I tweeked this by browning chicken in evoo and added a large can of diced tomatoes DRAINED,  omitted the ranch dressing, then cooked on stove top.  Served on iceberg lettuce "taco salad" style with blue cheese - non-fat yogurt dressing, green onions & fresh grilled corn.  Tonight I will transform leftovers into buffalo chicken enchiladas . . . yum!

I was worried about the sodium content in Franks hot sauce so I used Guy Ferier (?), which had 70 mg sodium I think and was good.  I cooked 6 checked breasts for 5 hrs, shredded, then cooked for another 30-40 minutes more.  I don't like it when it has the mushy texture.  Now this had a definite kick to it.  Great for me and hubby, not good at all for kids.   When i make this again I will try what others suggested - add half or so block of cream cheese.
Good, easy recipe to change up the monotony!

I use this recipe often for tailgate, large parties, and events. It is always raved about and at least 100 people have asked for it. Kids and Adults love it!  It is amazing how moist the chicken is even with being done in a crockpot. Since I'm always doing bulk I use the Smart and Final First Street 64oz buffalo style chicken wing sauce.

It was absolutely amazing, I definitely suggest shredding the chicken with a couple hours left to let the juice soak into the chicken.

Way, way too spicy. And I love spicy. I would not use less hot sauce and substitute ranch dressing for the dry ranch packet. This was way too hot for everyone.

I think the original was great. I made it twice, it was excellent. The third time I made it I modified it a little. Instead of using packaged ranch I used a bottle of liquid ranch. Then I seasoned it with old bay, splash of Italian dressing and two heaping TBLS of garlic. I put a half stick of butter and used franks extra hot sauce. Slow cooked it 8 hrs.  Then shredded it. I let it sit for about an hour on warm. IT was delicious!!!!!

This was really easy to whip up on my lunch break. Tasted just fine. Used some fresh rolls from the fresh market to make more of a slider. Little spring mix & ranch. Good to go. Will be adding this to the tailgate menu.

This was just ok. I only put 1/2 bottle of sauce in the crockpot because I was afraid it was going to be too much liquid, and it was still very soupy when it was done cooking. So I shredded the meat in the sauce and mixed it up then put it on a burner on medium-high to cook off some of the liquid. It was very moist, not dry at all which was good. I melted pepper jack cheese on the rolls, added the chicken, and topped it off with a splash of wing sauce. My husband said it just tasted like something that was hot to be hot, there wasn't a lot of flavor. I liked it a little better than he did, but I had blue cheese dressing on mine which cut the spiciness a bit and added some more flavor. If I try this again, I will cook the chicken with the ranch dressing first, then remove it from the liquid in the pot, shred it and add the sauce and butter. I might try adding adding some cream cheese as others suggested to cut the heat.

I just made this. Holy cow! I was NOT expecting it to be so delicious! I had to do it in a time crunch, so I just boiled the chicken and mixed it with the sauce. I never buy seasoning packets, I just used the recipe for dry ranch mix on this site (halved it).

The best decision I made with this is that I spread goat cheese on the bun and a touch of ranch. Holy cow. DELICIOUS!!! I was expecting it to be heartburn inducing as these types of sandwiches can be... not the case! It is more subtle and so darn good.

Husband love this! I cook frozen chicken breasts in water first for 5 hours then strain and shred the chicken before adding the sauce ingredients and cook for another 30 minutes. If I wasn't cooking frozen chicken breasts I wouldn't need to do this. Thanks for the recipe!

This is awesome! !!  This was absolutely delicious.  The whole family liked it.  We opted for sesame seed buns vs hoagie rolls.  I personally thought the rolls would be too bready.  This will for sure get made many more times in our household.

I used frozen chicken breasts and omitted the butter.  It made for a solid buffalo chicken sandwich.  I was expecting my kids to rave about it, but they didn't, which is why I'm not giving 5 stars.

Very good.  My hubby really liked this.  I accidentally put the whole ranch packet in there and ended up have to add water as it was too salty.  This was my mistake.. I will make this again.

I made this as a wrap with blue cheese coleslaw inside instead of a sandwich and boy did everyone love it. Recipe is so simple to follow and really flavorful. Just beware it makes a lot if you follow the directions.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I prefer the texture of my usual buffalo chicken recipe with cubed chicken, but for the ease of it, this recipe is wonderful. Next time I will make my own dried ranch mix, since most of the store bought ones have MSG.

Easy to make. I thought 7.5 hours was a little excessive. I had too much water in there from the chicken so at hour 5 poured out half and add more sauce (we like ours spicy).  It was ready by hour 6. It was a hit with the family. I was already asked to make it again soon.

Followed the recipe exactly using Sweet Baby Ray's wing sauce.  Chicken was tender and the flavor was excellent.  Served it with creamy slaw on potato buns.  Will definitely be making again in the future.

This is a staple in our house.  I don't usually have packets of dry ranch so I use ranch dressing, and sweet baby ray's wing sauce.  I don't use the butter and know its purpose.  Leftovers on a pizza with BBQ and a bit more wing sauce the next day topped with Mozzarella cheese is almost as good as the original.  Another tip serve the sandwiches with coleslaw on top.  Killer!!

It was really great I just used a medium buffalo sauce to add some kick and it turned out great.  I will follow other peoples suggestions and make buffalo chicken ranch pizza with the leftovers.

I tried this recipe tonight, cooked for the chicken for only about 5 1/2 hours an must say its pretty dang good. I add few things like corn starch to thicken up the sauce and a touch of liquid smoke(not much cause it's concentrated) to add a little more of that bbq chicken wings favor.

I halved the recipe and it was alright. I feel it was too saucy... However, I toasted the hoagies before serving and even added cheese. Will try again and perhaps leave the chicken in whole pieces.

Holy cow, this was awesome!  Made some minor changes - used chicken thighs instead of breast and only used about half the bottle of sauce.  I did use the ranch dressing mix recipe from this site instead of the pre-packaged ranch.  I used Wing It sauce the times I made it with great results.  I made it twice in 3 days it was so good.

This was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! My only complaint is that the dry ranch dressing has MSG in it :( Not sure if it would be as good without it, but maybe a substitute can be used.

I didn't really have a lot of time, so I turned the slow cooker on high and at about 1.5 hours shredded the chicken and turned it to low. I also added a cup of water. I forgot the butter, but it turned out just fine.

I would suggest doing half buffalo wing sauce and half bbq sauce...cooking in the slow cooker and the spiciness was strong. I also topped with ranch and fresh made slaw. Very good. Thanks for sharing!

SOO delicious! I made this with chicken thighs (skin removed) and it turned out fantastic! 8 chicken thighs plus half a stick of butter, a whole ranch packet and a cup of chicken broth. Let it cook down, drain off all the juices, remove the bones and shred.  Then I added the hot sauce and made it as spicy as I wanted.  Thank you for this recipe.

This is great stuff! I used 4 breasts & 8 bone in thighs.  I did it overnight and will only do 6 hrs next time.  I drained out the water/liquid when I pulled the chicken out of the crock pot because I had way too much liquid. After I shredded the meat I added the rest of the wing sauce but skipped the butter. My wife says these will be her next offering  for a carry-in at work.  Thanks for the recipe.

I cooked it in a crock pot for 4.5 hours (6 breasts, 1 whole packet of Italian dressing and Frank's Original hot sauce).  After 4.5, I shredded it and added 6-7 tbsp. of butter so that it was more like real, NY style wing sauce.  I let the shredded chicken sit in the sauce on warm for a few hours before serving it.  We ate it again the next day and it was even better.  I don't even think it needs to be on a roll, but I served it with shredded cheese and small rolls.

This was very good and very easy! I used Franks Hot Buffalo Wings Sauce. It was a little salty but that is my fault as I used over half of the dry ranch dressing mix. I served on rolls with blue cheese and cole slaw.

Easy recipe. Didn't taste too salty or spicy to us as others noted. Did add some garlic cloves. Kids liked it as well.

My family loves buffalo chicken strips so I had to try this.  Although I don't like buffalo sauce myself this was good.  With the dry ranch mix it seemed a bit salty so I'm not sure if bottled would be better?  Overall an easy crockpot meal!

This turned out really good!  I was surprised at how tender the chicken breasts were and how easy it was to shred.  I ate mine on a steak roll, but my husband ate his on corn tortillas with a little bit of sour cream and hot sauce and he loved it!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic!  The whole family loved it, and so easy to make.  My kids opted for bbq sauce on top, but loved the spicy flavor of the chicken.

these were so good. I didn't have the ranch spice packet so I just put some garlic and onion powder and salt and pepper on the chicken before I put it in the crock pot.  I used sweet baby rays buffalo wing sauce.  I kept in for 5 hours added the butter some more hot sauce shredded the chicken and kept on for another hour.

Really good. Used anchor bar medium wing sauce and it still had a lot of heat. Served with blue cheese on a costanzo roll. Would make again.

This is my STAND-BY when bringing food to a workplace potluck. Everyone loves it, and it's gone from the Crock Pot within the first ten minutes every time. I bring it in and cook it at work, so my co-workers are constantly asking me if it's going to be ready soon. I add a little extra hot sauce to the buffalo wing sauce to give it a little extra kick. This recipe is fool proof! You gotta try it with hot-dog buns!

very good! I wish my sauce was a bit more like buffalo sauce, it tastes somewhat like vinegar after being in the slow cooker so long, somewhat sour.

This was a good, quick, help yourself when you're hungry kinda dinner for my boys. Becuse I read the reviews I found a new and faster way to shred chicken without using the stand mixer...a potato masher, why didn't I think of that? I used 3.5 lbs of fresh chicken breast, 1 cup of Franks Original, 1 package of Giant Eagle brand dry Ranch seasoning, 1 tbs of chicken bouillon and a heaping fork of jarred garlic. I mixed it in a 2 cup measuring cup then topped it off with water to make 2 cups of sauce. Next time I will cut it back to 1.5 cups total. Other thoughts from the other reviews: 1. Put this on a heavy bun like a Kaiser Roll, the cheap Hamburger buns will dissolve from the liquid. 2. If you buy the bagged from the freezer chicken they add lots of water/brine to it. This could contribute to the runny and or to salty outcome.   I plan to make this again.

What a hit!  I cut the chicken breasts in four for more even cooking and to shorten cook  time. I also didn't add all the sauce to prevent it from being too spicy for kids.  Topped with coleslaw in buttery toasted buns, very satisfying.

I followed the recipe as follows and we just thought it was too mushy and lacked flavor. It would have helped if the bread was toasted to add some crunch but with soft rolls and super soft chicken it was just too mush for us. I like the idea of this but it just didn't work for us.

"This recipe is keeper" said my boyfriend in between helpings. This buffalo chicken is not only EASY but it's delicious! I used frozen chicken and after 7 hrs it was PERFECT. I feared it may be a little dry after reading a few pervious reviews- but my fears were layed to rest when I was pulling the chicken apart. Topped it off with a thin slice of Swiss cheese, yummy. My beau was right, it's a keeper!

I tryed this out last Saturday. Wow! Great flavor, and soo easy to make. My boyfriend asked me to make it again next weekend. We love potato buns in my house, and I added some melted pepper jack cheese that "CookinBug" suggested. It's a winner... Thanks!

Easy and awesome! Video right on. By accident I forgot the butter and used a whole ranch pack.  My bottle of reds wing sauce was only 12 ounces and it was plenty moist and hot without any on top. cooked on low done in 5 hrs pulled apart after 3.
Will make this for parties etc sooo good with some blue cheese dressing.  Thanks!!!!

Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, and yummy! Literally you throw 4 chicken breasts, a packet of ranch dressing, and a bottle of hot sauce in a crock pot and walk away - 6 hours later you've got a fabulish dinner! Chicken wasn't dry or too spicy (you can control that depending on the hot sauce you use) and I have leftovers. This is going in the dinner rotation from now on. Even a buffoon can do this Buffalo recipe! Love, love, love!!!!!

What a disappointment! After reading some reviews, I was concerned about this being a bit too salty so I cut down the sauce quite a lot. I figured I could always add more if needed. For 4 pcs chicken, I used 8 ozs of sauce and 1/3 of ranch packet. Way too salty for me. I added sugar and that made it a bit better but still not quite. Not sure what I'm going to do with lots of leftover.

Yum! This recipe is so easy to make and turns out great every time. I have used Frank's buffalo sauce and Sweet Baby Ray's buffalo sauce and both worked great. I don't add the butter at the end because I don't think it needs it. I top my sandwiches with crumbled blue cheese and lettuce. This would be a great recipe to double and make for a party.

I doubled this, easy, delicious and great for Party's.  I made this for my husbands birthday party and everyone loved it. It was self serve right out of the crockpot onto hearty hamburger buns and offered Blue Cheese salad dressing, or coleslaw as toppings.

It was only ok. You have to really like buffalo chicken. Better for a big tailgate party than dinner. Better for sampling than a sandwich.

Wow!  Delicious on sandwiches as well as on a pizza!  I varied a bit by cooking the chicken in broth with added RedHot.  Then shredding after 4-5 hours, reserving some liquid and adding a mixture of Red Hot and butter (how I usually make wing sauce).  I also added some of the reserved liquid to the Red Hot/Butter mixture.  Cooked another hour on low.  Came out perfect!

I love, love, love this recipe! When making the sandwiches I always add pepper jack cheese and a strip of bacon! Also I pull the chicken apart 4 hours in to the 6 hours so it soaks in to all the chicken

I make this without the dry ranch (I'm a bleu cheese gal). This is super easy to make and I let the slow cooker do it's thing while I'm at work. I always toast the bread and add bleu cheese crumbles and dressing on top.

WOW I DIDNT KNOW HOW MUCH BUTTER WAS ACTUALLY IN BUFFALO SAUCE... i skipped the butter when it was in the slow cooker just because i didn't think it could possibly be neccessary

This is an easy recipe with great results.  Kids found it to be a bit hot but adults loved it.  May ease up on the sauce next time for the kids and adults can add more to their sandwiches.

Delish! Added a couple more pcs of chicken so I had a bit too much liquid. When I make this again I'll spring for fresh rather than frozen chicken so this isn't so wet. The flavor was heavenly tho. I added some cream cheese to the left overs and used this as Buffalo chicken dip. Thanks for sharing.

My husband would give this 5 stars and I would say 3. So we'll settle on 4.  I thought there wasn't much to it but a bite full of hot sauce. That's probably why he loved it :)

This was pretty darn good and it can't get any easier to prepare.  I didn't have the wing sauce so I used BBQ sauce and added some crushed red pepper, maybe a drop or two of hot sauce would also be good.  I'll definitely make again and maybe add some water or not cook as long.

This is 5 stars if you used thighs instead of breasts. I've made it both ways and the former is better. Also, shred then return to crockpot for at least 30 minutes seems to really infuse the sauce. I thought this would be really spicy with so much hot sauce, but maybe the salad dressing mix mellows it a bit.

I love this recipe. I actually did a 2.5lb bag of frozen chicken (thawed out) and 1 jar of Frank's and 2T of margarine and it tasted great. I will use this method of prepping chicken for a whole week. Using BBQ sauce or Frank's Wing Sauce.

I love buffalo wings so I had to try this. It turned out great. I didn't use the ranch dry mix instead I just used regular ranch about 1/2 cup and it was perfect. My man loved it as well. Will be making it again :)

Will make again.  Serve with carrot and celery sticks and blue cheese.  Added bbq sauce and cheese to my son's bun to cut the heat.

Be careful what ranch you use. Mine turned out so salty I had to mix it with a pound of rice for it to be edible. The rice was really quite good, just not what I was going for.

We love this recipe! My family asks for it a lot now. I shred the chicken after it has cooked for a few hours and then put it back in the sauce to cook for awhile longer. And then we add our fave cheese on the sandwich, like provolone, pepper jack, swiss...
And serve with our favorite chips too! Great and easy supper!!! :)

great recipe especially for atkins dieters.  i just threw in 4 FROZEN whole chicken breasts to the crockpot, added 12 oz bottle of valentinos hot sauce (franks red hot would work/taste the same) - 0 carbs and 1/2 cup of blue cheese dressing - 0 carbs.  on low for 8 hours.... perfect!  shredded and stirred with just a fork then added 4 oz cream cheese and 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar.  put on pork rinds and celery :)  even my non-dieting, picky husband loved it.  SOOOOOOOO EASY!!!! thanks!

Super easy. I used a bottle of wing sauce I found on sale at Target. I don't have a slow cooker so I simply do it the old fashion way - A pot on the stove on the lowest setting. It should take at least 3 hours for your meat to cook and when it shreds easily with a foor it is done! Time permitting, I like to leave my shredded meat on the stove a little while (maybe an hour) to soak up all the good marinade.

These are sooooo good!  I'm making them for the 2nd time today & I cannot wait!  I used the Louisiana brand sauce the first time.  This time I'm going to try Franks Buffalo sauce.  We put them on Crustini Rolls instead of Hoagie rolls.  AHHH-MAZING!!!!!

Delicious!  Made some modifications due to different levels of tolerances for "hotness."  I used 3 large boneless breasts.  For the buffalo sauce I used 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 1/2 cup of Frank's buffalo hot sauce & 1/2 cup of blue cheese dressing.  I shredded the chicken after about 5 hours & let it sit cook a about an hour longer.  The chicken was delicious & left the lips tingling but not burning.  Served the chicken on nice rolls with blue cheese dressing & cole slaw.  Dripping, messy sandwich but worth the extra napkins.

YUMMY!  I used the whole packet of Ranch dressing mix and only 1/2 bottle of Franks Wing Sauce.  There was a lot of liquid in my slow cooker so I tried to drain it and reduce it so I'd have a slightly thicker sauce, but my patience and my chicken couldn't wait.  It was okay though because when I shredded the chicken it sort of absorbed the extra sauce.  Next time I might add a boneless thigh or two for a little extra flavor but it was delicious just the way the recipe is written.  Served it on some toasted whole wheat buns and topped with blue cheese dressing.  Might try blue cheese slaw next time.  My 11 year old ate two whole sandwiches!  We'll definitely be having this again soon.

These are FABULOUS! One of my favorite guilty pleasures are boneless buffalo wings dipped in blue cheese dressing. These are IT!!! I sprinkled some blue cheese crumbles on the chicken after placing it in the bun, topped it all with some shredded iceberg lettuce, slapped the top of the bun on, and it was wonderful! Awesome flavor, no greasy heaviness afterward! Thanks so much for sharing!

I (sort of) made this last night but I had different plans for it.  I was reading that the package of ranch makes it super salty so I did not add it (someone suggested putting ranch dressing on top after).  I did cut the Franks with butter so it would not be too hot and then I made a buffalo chicken pizza!  It was so good and there was plenty left over so I put it in the freezer.

Using just chicken breasts makes it sooo dry...I even added broth to compensate. Using some thighs might help.

Added all of my hot sauce to the slow cooker atop the chicken.  Also since I doubled the recipe, added a full packet of ranch dressing mix.  The recommendation of cheese and/or ranch dressing on the chicken sandwich was a hit.  We used mozzarella or provolone cheese to the chicken sandwich, kids loved it!

My family and I thought this was just terrible. I managed to salvage it by making chicken quesadillas with colby jack and avocado on them. I am normally a very good cook so not quite sure what happened here.

This recipe is great. I've made it with pure chicken breast and a mixture of chicken breast and thigh. For me it worked better with just chicken breast, the mixture got way too watery from the fat in the thighs. I also stick to Frank's Original sauce because it's such a perfect Buffalo style sauce. (Not sure why they make and charge more for "Buffalo" flavor? Original is perfect.) 

I did also try to add some chopped celery to add some vegetables but of course they completely evaporated throughout the slow cooking process, I may attempt again but add them in with 30 minutes to go.

Our family loved this.  It wasn't too spicy for the little ones but it had enough flavor for the rest of  us.  It was so easy to throw into the crock pot too.  Also, it was great on luttuce, for my healthier dinner, and the kids threw it on their favorite buns.  Perfect!

I threw this in the crockpot before I left for work, I called my fiance to see how it was looking and he said it was done and he already ate and it was sooo good! I cannot cook AT ALL...this was so easy and took no time at all and we both loved it. Will definatley be making this again! Also I love ranch so of course it tasted amazing when topped with ranch.

I mixed the leftovers with a block of cream cheese and baked for about 20 min for an awesome buffalo dip.

The trick to this recipe is finding a buffalo sauce that you like.  The first time I bought the ONLY bottle I could find at the grocery store, which was so hot, I couldn't eat it!!!  So the next time I made it, I bought my favorite buffalo sauce from Buffalo Wild Wings and it turned out fantastic!

This is not my kind of recipe- I don't like wing sauce at all.  However, I made it for my boys and they adored it, which was the goal.  Thanks for sharing this.  I'll be making it again for sure.

Well I had my daughter try it when it was done.  She tasted it and said "HOLY COWABUNGA DUDE!!!  THIS IS FANTASTIC!!! Made this for a demonstration party and everyone loved it.  I actually ran out and had to cook extra breasts on the stove but thankfully took out some sauce earlier and that saved me.  I did use half a can of chix broth but had to take some sauce out from the crockpot.  But if I didn't do that, I think it might have been too dry.

Super easy and a good taste, though the chicken was a bit dry. If I had had organic chicken, I think it would have been much better.

This is an awesome recipe! I give it 5 stars easily.   I'm not a huge buffalo wing fan, but have to say this is so good.   It makes a lot for two people, so my husband and I freeze portions for later meals.  It freezes very well.  A great tailgating or party food but works great for a working family.  Thanks to whoever came up with this recipe!!

We felt like we were eating an appetizer on a hoagie roll.  The wing sauce was overwhelming for a sandwich. When I re-heated it, I added cream cheese.  Then, it was delicious.  We ate it with Fritos and tortilla chips.

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved these sandwiches!!! I used 8 chicken breasts with 1/4 cup honey and 2 tsp minced garlic with 2 bottles franks hot buffalo sauce on the 6 hr high setting. I shredded the chicken and put it back in the sauce for another hour and a half to absorb the flavors. I toasted sub rolls with pepper jack cheese and served with sweet potato fries!!

This stuff is amazing!!! None ever goes to waste. Definately spicy. I used a little more of ranch powder to tone it down just a little. Great with coleslaw on a sandwhich or without bread.

Simple and delicious. I used Frank's Red Hot Wing sauce. The chicken is super tender and flavorful. Great on both toasted buns or on lettuce.

This is a great recipe for anyone who likes easy and spicy. My husband loves this. I really like it, but sometimes "cut" the spice with tomato sauce. Top with blue cheese chunks, makes a great weekend sandwich!

My fiance and I loved this!  I only had 3 chicken breasts, but it still turned out great.  Fiance wants to make this a regular meal.

I paired it with swiss cheese and for a side, I just used carrots and celery and ranch dressing.

This was really good!  I used Franks Red Hot Buffalo sauce and it was SUPER spicy - like, mouth on fire hot.  I like hot, but would have preferred a tad toned down.  I'll try this again using another sauce, but this one is a keeper - especially for busy nights.

Delicious! I used a bit more of the buffalo sauce as we like it spicy and it was perfect!  So quick and easy yet super yummy, this would be perfect for tailgating or a super bowl part, or really any type of potluck. This is a new staple for us - thx Divinesolace21!

Fiance said he couldn't get a sandwich at a restaurant any better!! I didn't have a bottled wing sauce so I mixed Open Pit BBQ sauce from Sams Club with Franks red hot and 1/4 bottle of Chinese hot sauce(with rooster) along with some cumin and leaf majorum - omitted the butter and it turned out great!

I LOVE buffalo chicken but dislike it fried. This recipe was PERFECT! The only thing I'm trying to figure out is why it doesn't seem very filling. Like I'm hungry again in a couple hours. I think this would go great on a salad or by making a lettuce wrap. I love the fact that I can put this on to cook before I go to work, come home and it's good to go! Delicious!

This was so simple it was almost silly that it was a recipe! I figured it would just be "ok", but it was EXCELLENT! I used 2 thighs and 2 breasts, because that's what I had. I don't normally like thighs but they work better in the crockpot. I plopped the frozen chicken in the pot and sprinkled the ranch dressing over the top, then topped with the hot sauce. I didn't read the instructions and I put the butter in as well. When I got home, the sauce kind of separated. I shredded the chicken and then mixed it together and let the chicken soak up the sauce a little bit. We had them on kaiser rolls with bleu cheese dressing as a mayo. They were so delicious! Even warmed up the next day for lunch they were great. Really simple and easy and perfect!! Thanks!

This was so-so.  Even though I love Buffalo Chicken Dip, this just didn't do it for me.  I missed the cream cheese in this dish.  Even though it was spicy, it just didn't seem like it had a good flavor.

This had great flavor, but was way too spicy for us as the recipe is written.  I served with ranch dressing and provolone cheese.

This was a little too spicy for me and my boyfriend, but it was delicious nonetheless. It is quite possibly the easiest most delicious recipe I've found on allrecipes.com. I will be making it for the second time in a month today, but I'm going to add provolone cheese to cool it down, as suggested in a few other reviews.

Love this recipe. Used the Louisiana Wing Sauce the first time and it was too hot for the kids. Used Sweet Baby Ray's and Franks Wing Sauce the next couple times and it fantastic ( each sauce used individually, not together). Used regular Hidden Valley dry Ranch, the whole packet. We also add a thick bleu cheese dressing on top of the chicken when served on buns.

So easy and so good!  Frozen chicken breasts were done after 6 hours on low.  Family gave 4 stars but all of the reasons were controllable - too spicy and too saucy; next time I will use a milder sauce and not as much.  I will also omit the butter at the end but I always follow the exact instructions the first time I try a recipe.  Super easy and soooo good!

These were OK. They dried out quite a bit even after adding more sauce, and also adding ranch and cheese to the sandwiches. Kind of bummed, was super excited to try these and they sounded great, but did not turn out so great. I like the concept of the slow cooker pulled chicken, and will try something similar again but I will not make this recipe again as is. I am surprised everyone else liked it so much, I like chicken wings and DH loves them, so I thought this would be a sure hit but it was not.

This wasn't bad but it was very salty. IF I make this again I would not shred the chicken like I did. Maybe then the saltiness wouldn't be so extreme. I think the blue cheese dressing I added to the sandwich helped but it was still really salty.

Yum yum yum!! Soooo easy to make too! Perfect for those bz days when there no time to cook. I used franks red hot wing sauce, good choice, the original red hot wld have been to spicy i think. 1.5pds of chick brest made enough for about 5 overstuffed sandwichs. I cooked in the slow cooker for 5:30hrs then it stood on "keep warm" option for a hr untill i got home from work. The chik was sooo tender, fell apart easily. Let, tom, and some crumbley blue chz. Delish! will make again and again

The whole family loved this. I followed the recipe except I put in the slow cooker the night before so it was ready in the morning and I didn't add the butter. I shredded a half an hour before dinner and returned to sauce, excellent!

I found the chicken to be very salty overall which I felt ruined it.  I'm not sure if it is because of the ranch or the type of buffalo sauce I used, no name brand.

Love these sandwiches - so yummy and so easy!  We use Bulliard's sauce.  It has such a nice zing to it.  If you need to tone it down, put a little crumbled blue cheese on or a little blue cheese dressing.  If blue cheese isn't your thing, a little ranch dressing works.  Provolone cheese is wonderful with it also!

just tried this tonight..if you are a novice or an expert..you can make this work...the left over sauce is nice to put in a separate bowl and let your company decide what level of heat they want..accompanied w/ a homemade blue cheese dressing (rachel ray's ) and the suggestions of toasting the rolls w/ a littel butta..heavan on a bun!

Loved this! So easy too, we served the sandwiches with sauteed onions and peppers, pepperoncinis and melted provolone on top- a great meal to satisfy a junk food craving (wings) and so much better for you! I also cut the amount of butter used in half....

This was just OK...It's just chicken with buffalo wing sauce. Not really sure why such great reviews.  I put lettuce and tomato on mine....it's pretty plain without anything on it.

These were great! I did add a little chicken stock though per previous reviews and am glad I did! It cooked down great. I also shredded the chicken an hour before serving and it soaked up all the juices great!!!

This sandwich was delicious and easy to make.  I cooked it while I was at work.  Being that I enjoy spicy foods I used a spicy ranch package instead of regular ranch...I did have friends who couldn't deal with the heat so just be aware if you use a spicy ranch package.

This was OK.  I originally served it on buns with blue cheese dressing, but my husband and I felt it would be better served in flour tortillas with lettuce, tomato, shredded cheddar and blue cheese.  Next time we'll try it this way!

SORRY.. I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS RECIPE. MADE LAST WEEKEND FOR GAMEDAY. WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN MY ADULT SONS TASTED THE CHICKEN MIX AND PUT THE LID BACK ON THE POT AND ASKED" WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE?" I HAD ALREADY TASTED AND WAS WAY TO SALTY, USED ONLY 1/4 TO 1/2 PKG OF RANCH MIX. THIS RECIPE SOUNDED PERFECT FOR BY HOT WING LOVERS, BUT IT MISSED THE MARK

Boyfriend ate this up! I wasn't as thrilled with it myself, but I'm admittedly not the biggest fan of buffalo flavored things so I'll trust him in the fact that it's an amazing recipe if youre into spicy food :)

Absolutely delicious and easy. Made my own wing sauce with Frank's Red Hot and minced garlic and followed the recipe the rest of the way.  A keeper, for sure!

I thought this was a good and very easy recipe.  I added Franks Hot Wing sauce, I could not find a 17.5 oz bottle of hot sauce the recipe called for so I used most of the bottle of the wing sauce that I had bought. I thought that the chicken needed some liquid as the hot sauce pretty much evaporated when it cooked in the slow cooker. I ended up adding some water to it during the last hour or so of cooking time. I would make this again, its great topped with ranch or blue cheese dressing and some cheese!

Made this 4 days ago and my husband is requesting it again for dinner tonight!   We used Franks Hot Buffalo sauce and it was a tad spicy, just had to put a little extra ranch on the sandwich.   lol    It is a keeper in our house.

Awesome! The only thing I changed was to cube the chicken in 2 inch cubes before placing in crockpot. It cooks a little faster and is WAY easier to shred! Also, to make it a little thicker and spicier, we added a packet of buffalo seasoning mix (found with the powder marinades and rubs). Great on onion rolls!

Wow, I was skeptical that this would be something I would like (bc of the ranch dressing), even after the positive reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised. This turned out exactly like I wanted it to taste, if not even better!  Will absolutely be making this again...often

These are awesome! I made the mistake of throwing frozen breasts into the crockpot along with the ranch and sauce. As a seasoned crockpot user, I should have known better. Shame on me! The amount of liquid in the pot was ridiculous after the chicken breasts released the water from being frozen! I simply removed the breasts and shredded them and then made up some more homemade buffalo sauce (1/2 cup hot sauce(I prefer Trappy's Red Devil),4 TBS melted butter, 1 tsp vinegar) that I then added the other half of the ranch packet to. I tossed it all in a pan and cooked on low heat for a while. We had these on toasted buns with sliced pepperjack cheese and topped them with some prepared slaw mix I tossed with blue cheese dressing. The combo of the slightly spicy meat, the pepperjack and crunchy tang of the blue cheese slaw was a great combo. Next time, I will go ahead and toss the breasts in the crockpot by themselves to cook and then shred them and toss with homemade sauce, the ranch and put back in the crock for an hour or so to simply heat through. I will certainly be making these again and will always serve with pepperjack, the blue cheese slaw and toasted buns.

So easy and delicious! Followed the recipe exactly for the cooking, but added a few extras to the sandwich to make it sing! Added blue cheese crumbles, leaf lettuce and tomato along with extra sauce for an added kick at the end. Otherwise, the chicken turns out savory without being too spicy until you add the extra wing sauce at the end. Delicious!

Great flavor and was the right amount of "hot" for my wife and I.  Knocking one star off just because it was a little salty for us.  Will try experimenting by replacing some of the hot sauce with chicken broth and some red pepper flakes.  Overall though a great, simple recipe.

Very easy to make, but way too hot for us. A real buffalo lover will LOVE this, though. I served with blue cheese/greek yogurt topping and shredded lettuce. Next time I will do less buffalo sauce to lighten the hot flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly. I left it on the counter cooking in the crockpot when I went to school and when I got home the kitchen smelled amazing! And it tasted even better. The husband loved it too! We served it on bread with pepperjack cheese. The Best!

This was delicious and so easy to make. My boyfriend and our group of friends loved this tasty recipe. I would recommend using the chicken to top a salad. Top with some ranch dressing or blue cheese crumbles and enjoy!

Delicious! Instead of bottled buffalo sauce I made my own BBQ sauce from another recipe: with the packet of ranch mix, a little corn starch and a few pinches of cayenne pepper.

As a person who only likes my food to have a little bit of a kick, if any at all, these were not for me.  I bought the most mild buffalo sauce I could find and it was still entirely too spicy.  I like a splash of buffalo sauce, but a meal saturated in it is just too spicy.  I even added extra bottled ranch to try to offset the heat.  So unless you really like spicy, these aren't for you.  They definitely aren't going to go over well with the kiddos.  They have a nice taste to them, but they are just too hot even with the mildest sauce.

I wanted to love this one too but it tasted just like flavorless chicken drenched in sauce right out of the bottle.  It made my boyfriend and I both sick all night.  Too much sauce and not enough true flavor.  I really like the idea though!

What an awesome easy recipe! I didn't have wing sauce and no time to go to Publix, so I threw in a bottle of Carolina BBQ Sauce and rinsed the bottle with a smidgen of Swanson Organic Chicken Broth. My husband (who hates chicken breast) ate several servings and it was super super easy.

My husband liked the taste, but not the texture.  The recipe said cook 6-7 hours, so I cooked 6 hours on low without opening the slow cooker until I shredded the chicken and added butter at 6 hours.  I did leave it cooking on low for another 45 minutes, so maybe it was my fault, but the recipe did say cook for 6-7 hours.  My husband thought it lacked texture and tasted mushy like canned chicken.  I will probably try this again because I need more slow cooker recipes, but will cook it for less time (maybe on high for 4 hours as in another chicken slow cooker recipe I like?).  I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could.

I have made these several times now.  The last time I made them, I used a cooked rotisserie chicken to save time and in addition to the buffalo sauce and ranch I also used a locally made vidalia onion hot sauce (kind of like a chunky sweet-hot salsa) and they were excellent!  Football, cool weather, and crock pot cooking....yay for fall!

I made this on Saturday and OMG, my honey and I ate just about the whole thing!  He had enough for 2 sandwiches for work the next day!  I did not have the dry ranch packets, so i put about 1/2 a bottle of ranch dressing in it and I am glad I did because I think it may have been too dry if I hadn't.  It was so good and the house smelled great when we got home!!!!  Thanks for sharing!

Good, but it seemed like it was missing something. Followed the recipe exactly. Will probably make again. Will maybe use the leftovers on a pizza or try to make some sort of soup with it.

Be sure to add the butter at the end (it makes it milder).  Served on cibatta rolls with sprinkles of bleu cheese with a side of cole slaw.  YUM!

This was so good and so easy!  I used some not great wing sauce, but it was still good.  I don't think that the butter is really needed.  I served it with bleu cheese coleslaw right on the sandwich.  I also made chicken wing pizza with the leftovers.

Very delicious but very, very salty!  Will definitely make again but I will use the recipe on AR for the dry ranch mix so I can lower the saltiness.  I added celery seed and we topped with ranch dressing and pepper jack cheese.  Served on my chewy sandwich rolls from my recipe box.  Great recipe for busy days!

My family loves spicy foods, but this was a little too spicy/tangy/salty for all of us!  I followed the recipe to the letter.  Not sure why you need to add 1/2 package of dry ranch salad dressing mix.  That's probably where the salty came from.  Love the idea of this recipe, but will remake it omitting the dressing mix and maybe less buffalo sauce.

i followed this recipe exactly as it calls for and they turned out too salty, too spicey, too strong. the only good part was how the chicken turned out... very juicy and broke apart just by stiring in the crock pot.

Yum! SUCH a good recipe for Sunday football! Make sure to use Franks buffalo wing sauce. I accidentally used Franks hot sauce the first time and WOW, way too hot. But, after correcting my error, this recipe has become a staple for game days.

Supper yummy and easy. Even without the butter. I just don't get what the butter is supposed to be adding to this? Served with crispy rolls and an assortment of cheeses. Goes great with beer and football! Sure it's gonna be even better tomorrow...

This is a delicious idea for a quick dinner to please my whole crew.  My husband prefers his spicier so I used mild sauce in the crockpot and served hot wing sauce on the side for him to sprinkle on top of his own sandwich.  This way everybody was happy!

My wife and I really liked this recipe, but the kids?... Not so much. They were alright with the heat, but didn't care for the flavor. I bought a Lawry's Buffalo sauce that was just o.k. I think the next time I'm going to look around for a better buffalo wing sauce, maybe something from our local wing place...

I really wanted to love this recipe since it was so easy but my family wouldn't eat it.  I followed the directions as indicated and chose Frank's Buffalo sauce. I also toasted the hoagie rolls with a slice of American cheese.  We did not like it at all.  I'm not sure the purpose of the Ranch dressing mix since I could not taste it but maybe I should have used the whole packet verses a half as indicated.  I found this to taste just like the bottle of sauce so if you can eat your favorite sauce straight out of the bottle, you will probably like this a lot.   Instead of throwing this out, I tried to make it as a dip as suggested by another reader.  I put it in a dish, sprinkled chedder cheese all over it and baked it until the cheese melted and then served with fresh celery.  Still not a winner for my family.  Sorry.

This is my first bad review and i was surprised because i thought i would love this dish. I personally didn't like the flavor neither did anyone one else who came over for dinner. No one wanted seconds, 4 people didn't eat theirs. I think it's the ranch. I love to add ranch or blue cheese to my buffalo sandwich, but something about it being cooked in didn't sit right with anyone. I really love spicy food and always use Reds buffalo sauce and this didn't turn out spicy at all this time. That's how i know its the ranch. Good for kids maybe, or people who like a mild buffalo taste.

After seeing the amount of buffalo sauce called for in this recipe, I was nervous that this would be too spicy, especially for my kids.  But it was just perfect.  Even my youngest (who is 7) gobbled it right down.  I love using my slow cooker when we are busy, and it was so nice to come home to a delicious meal.  Served on homemade hamburger buns, also from this site.  Will use over and over - thanks!

Really good!  Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  My family really enjoyed and I will make again.  I ate mine on a toasted bun with a splash of bleu cheese dressing and some melted cheese.  Yum!

These sandwiches are the bomb!  I am always looking for meals I can throw in the crockpot and have ready when I get home from work.  My entire family loved these!  I used Frank's buffalo wing sauce (it was only 12 ounces but it had just the right amount of sauce).  I forgot the butter and they were still great!  This is a yummy, easy and low calorie dinner.  Definitely a keeper!

I can't believe how quick, easy, and delicious this chicken is!!  I followed the advice of some others and shredded the chicken after about 4 hours, then added a little more hot wing sauce and let it continue cooking.   It was plenty saucy and the perfect spiciness. YUMMM!! I will definately be making this MANY more times.

Enjoyed and it was so convenient to throw it in the crockpot and forget about it for a few hours.  Used 5 large boneless chicken breasts, entire 12 oz bottle of Frank's Red Hot sauce (did not reserve any to splash on top of the meat later when serving), and the entire 1 oz pkg of ranch dressig mix.  Added a couple of teaspoons of minced garlic and a generous drizzle of honey.   Cooked on low for 3 hours, removed the chicken and shredded it, returned it to the slower cooker with the sauce & a couple of tbs of butter and cooked for another 45 mins.    Served on hearty hoagie rolls with ranch dressing and a topping of blue cheese coleslaw (recipe on this site).

Very Tasty. Was skeptical at first but it came out great. It only took 7 hours which made it done in the afternoon for us. We went ahead and pulled it and put it into the fridge. Then for dinner, just heated what we needed. Already looking forward to lunch tomorrow.

Tastes better without the ranch dressing packet... also has less MSG that way.  It's a great idea though.  Would never have thought of doing buffalo chicken in a crock pot.  I've done it several times now!

Absolutely delicious.  My husband now wants them added into the rotation.  I only used three chicken breasts and about 8 oz. of Buffalo Sauce which was plenty for the three of us.  Would be perfect for a Superbowl party.

Really tasty. I went a little lighter on the buffalo wing sauce because my stomach is wimpy and added a little chickens tock to it. Cooked for about 5 hours, shredded up, put back in the sauce and cooked a bit longer. I topped these sandwiches with sauted cabbage, onions and roasted garlic

I have to say I followed the recipe perfectly but it just didn't come out as well as i had hoped, i was hoping with the slow cooker that it would have really absorbed the sauce but it just didn't, it's still cooking now guess i'll have to wait and see how my hubby likes it, I think next time i would need a thicker sauce.

I read some of the reviews and also shredded the chicken about an hour before serving. Also, before I put the chicken in, I seasoned it with a packet of buffalo wing seasoning from McCormick. I think this made the chicken have an even spicier flavor. This made great filling for wraps as well as sandwiches. We'll definitely make it again!

Careful, once the chicken is done cooking, DRAIN the slow cooker before mixing in the sauce. I made this mistake at first and the mix was very watery.

Amazing recipe, and so easy -- definitely part of our normal dinner rotation!  I tend to leave the cooker for closer to 10 hours, so I add chicken stock just to cover the top of the chicken (otherwise it dries out a lot).  Awesome recipe!!!

I didn't use the butter, and maybe that is why it was too hot.  Or maybe it was the sauce I used.  Nonetheless, this was way too hot and rich for my taste.  I do like the way the chicken crumbled though, and may try this recipe again modified.

My whole family LOVED this! Splashing a little buffalo wing sauce on top before serving is a *must*. We also top it with a little Ranch or Blue Cheese dressing. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, we are adding to our list of family favorites!

Sandwich was good but a little to spicy and I only used 12 oz of buffalo sauce. Tried to tame down the heat with extra butter but was still very hot. After I put some ranch dressing and cheese on it it was a little better. Yummy but may try a milder sauce next time. Hubby loved it while he was eating it but was hurting the next day lol!

MMMM! I used Louisiana brand buffalo wing sauce and it was a little salty so I will try a different kind next time. I started it before work and it was ready when I got home which was nice but it was a little runny. I added the butter then let it cook a little while longer with the top off so some of the juice would evaporate. This worked out nicely. I buttered and toasted the rolls in a frying pan and added slices of Havarti cheese. The smoky flavor and creamy texture of the melted cheese made these super yummy! Great recipe!

very good recipe, needed to adjust due to family does not like too hot and did not want to add extra butter. Cooked in chicken broth with ranch seasoning, added buffalo sauce and butter, cooked on high with lid off about 30 min. Thanks for the recipe.

Used full pack of Ranch mix, 1 bottle of Frank's Buffalo sauce and 4 chicken breast. Cooked on low for 7 hours. Topped with lettuce, tomato, blue cheese crumbles and it was yummy. Served wth sweet potato fries.

I did not like this. The buffalo flavor is OVERWHELMING. I gave it two stars, but only because my husband who likes buffalo sauce said it was "okay." I had my sisters try it, and they did not care for it. I could taste the ranch in it, and I didn't care for that either. Sorry, but adding ranch powder to your chicken is different than dipping a wing in ranch dressing. I will not make this again.

This is not the best thing I've ever had.  I blame it on Franks Hot Wing Sauce.  It needs to be tastier.  You need to have more veggies to go on your sandwich.   My husband would like to see the sauce thicker.  He will have to like it to like it for the next 2 days because that is what we are eating.  My son and husband would give it 3.5 stars.  I need more flavour and I do like hot stuff.

i was so excited to try this, but it was WAYYYY too salty for my liking.  i couldnt even eat it because it was too salty.  maybe it was the sauce i used, but i wont be trying this recipe again.  i generally dont cook with salt because of my body builder brother so im use to the taste of food without it, so maybe its just me.

Like many other reviewers, I too thought the hot sauce was WAY too strong. I used an entire packet of ranch mix and also cut back on the amount of sauce and these sandwiches were still dripping with hot sauce. It was really all you tatsed. For people who just love hot sauce, this is probably a good recipe, but for my family, it was just way too much. I would have liked to taste some other flavor in there...

This was really easy to make. My boys loved the stuff. I thought it was a little to salty but I think that was because of the wing sauce I used. Thanks.

I was VERY disappointed in this recipe. I feel like it needs something more, but I can't put my finger on it. When I first saw this recipe I thought it was going to be awesome, unfortunately I was sadly proven wrong. Sorry, I will not be making this again :-(

This was incredibly easy, and very good.  Once the chicken was shredded, it soaked up quite a bit of the sauce, so I think next time I'd have extra wing sauce on hand.  I didn't have the dry-type rance dressing, so I just squeezed some ready-made ranch dressing into the mixt, and I thought it was just fine.  My kids really liked this one!

I just got a crock pot for my birthday, and this was the first thing I made in it. SSSOOOOOO GOOD! my boyfriend loved this and even my mom who doesn't really like spicy food loved this. For the hotsauce I used the Ken's buffalo marinade. With the leftovers I made buffalo chicken wontons, those came out really good too. next time I make this I think I am going to try making the buffalo chicken pizza with the leftovers like some other reviewers did. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks for posting!

Super easy and divine! I make these into wraps. I add extra ranch dressing, pickles, and pepper jack cheese. It ends up being extra spicy....so beware if spicy isn't your thing.

This was okay, but I found it to be a little soggey. Next time I will make this with 5 or 6 chicken breasts to absorb some of the juice. But overall it was tasty once I took it off of the roll.

I used frozen tenderloins and franks red hot buffalo wing sauce. As with all of these types of recipes, the outcome is as good as the sauce you use. All I could really taste was ranch flavored wing sauce. It was yummy, but overpowering. But if you spread only a little of the filling on the bread, and add ranch dressing- it is awesome!

Delicious!!  My husband especially loved it, he told me if they sold this in a restaurant it would be a hit.  I used 3 chicken breasts and a 12 oz bottle of Frank's buffalo sauce and it came out perfect.  Some people have said that the sauce evaporated or that the chicken was dry, but I didn't have either of these problems using those amounts.  It made enough for two sandwiches plus two for tomorrow night, with possibly some left over.  I put provolone cheese on the rolls and melted in the oven for 5 minutes before putting on the chicken and some ranch dressing.  Yum!

My husband LOVES this, although I will say that we tried it once with Tony Roma's Buffalo sauce and then once with Frank's Wing Sauce, and the Tony Roma's one was better.  We make a large crockpot full of it and then make sandwiches, pizza, dipping sauce for chips and even put them in eggs for a breakfast burrito that is surprisingly good!  Freezes really well too.    I cook whole chicken breasts for 6-7 hours, then shred them and leave them in for another hour on low just to get them to soak up the sauce.

I thought this was okay.  It was nice and easy but if you dont want to wait all day you could have similar results by just tossing cooked chicken with buffalo sauce in a skillet.  I also thought it was a little watery, next time i might add some cheese to thicken it up.

I have discovered that I really dislike the taste of buffalo sauce.  I make a buffalo chicken dip using cream cheese, cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, and buffalo seasoning packet.  I think I may try to use that to make a similar sandwich without using the sauce that I dislike.

I'm Sorry but I made this recipie as written, with Franks hot sauce and me and my family thought it was just ok. I couldn't really taste the ranch dressing in it. I am not sure what I could do to make it better for us.

Super easy to make. I cooked it in the crock pot on high for 3 hours, and the chicken was cooked perfectly.

Wow! These are wonderful. The chicken practically melted in your mouth and it had the perfect amount of spice. I used Franks Red Hot and added blue cheese coleslaw to the sandwiches. To die for! Thanks for the recipe.

Really good and super easy.  Darn if it doesn't taste like buffalo chicken.  Gotta love being out all day and coming home to a yummy smelling house courtesy of the slow cooker!!  We made some with bleu cheese dressing on the roll and, with or without the dressing, these were loved by all!!

Excellent!  I used Frank's hot sauce and this was very tastey, not too spicey.  I think the ranch dressing packet mellows it out a bit.

Very easy!  It turned out extremely spicy, but I think I added too much buffalo sauce.  The leftovers made an awesome buffalo chicken pizza the next day.  I spread ranch dressing on the pizza crust, topped with the chicken and mozzarella cheese.  Worth making the chicken just for the pizza!

Great! I shredded it and put it over Romaine lettece.  Called it a Buffalo Chicken salad.  Great, and pretty low in calorie.  I used only one tablespoon of butter to cut the calories.  Will definitely make again, my husband loved the flavor.  Thank you!

Good idea. Thanks for the recipe.  My husband and I loved it.  I used a little less hot sauce and then just added more on it right when we put it on the bread.  I also used Frank's hot sauce.  We used to mix that with butter for chicken wings, so this tasted just like that.

So so easy and delicious! I used Frank's Hotsauce and the flavor was wonderful. **Some reviewers complained about the thin consistency. To thicken up the chicken mixture at the end, I mixed 1 tbsp of melted butter with 1 tbsp flour. Then I added it to the chicken, stirred it, and let it sit for 3 minutes. It's the simpliest way to thicken any gravy or soup, and it worked perfectly with this.

A solid recipe for those wanting the taste of buffalo wings without all the work. I did cut back on the ranch salad dressing mix - basically I used enough to dust each piece of chicken.

I cooked this for SuperBowl party.  I added another 1/2 bottle of the wings sauce at the end to make sure they were nice and moist.  I had people calling people during the commercials to tell them about these sandwiches!  Needless to say, it was gone by the end of the game. :)  Delicious!

After reading all the great reviews, I was expecting a lot more.  This was good, but not spectacular.  An easy weeknight meal, nothing I would serve to company.  I did serve it with coleslaw on top.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I absolutely loved how much it tasted like something from a restaraunt!  I do think a big part of this recipe is the buffalo sauce you use.  That creates the main flavor, so be sure to pick a sauce your family will enjoy.  We used the other 1/2 of the dressing packet to make regular ranch dressing which was enought to top all of the sandwiches.  :)

easy and deeeelicious! I took advice from other posters who cut back on the sauce; I added a few ounces when I put chicken in the crockpot, added a few more half way thru cooking, and then a dash when it was served. I did not think this was too salty; moswtly likely due to less hot sauce. I would cook this for no more than 6 hours; I cooked for 7 and it was a little too long; the meat was too soft. Add more chicken breasts to the crockpot so you have leftovers, you are going to love this dish!

Excellent sandwich. I will try with celery thinly sliced and added the last hour next time for that true buffalo wing taste. This round, I added all the sauce, toasted the rolls, and then spread them with bleu cheese dressing.

Maybe it was the brands i used, but this became waaaaay salty. I added some water to dilute the juices a bit. Still, effing amazing recipe on merits of ease and taste. Will make again!

Excellent recipe. I made 2.5 lbs of chicken, s I added half the bottle of sauce, all the ranch mix, butter and 1/2c. beef broth at the beginning. About a half hour before serving, I drained the liquid and mixed in the rest of the sauce and a pinch of cayenne. It was a big hit.

We LOVED this! My hubby loves hot wings and I love chicken in the crockpot, so this was the best of both worlds. I didn't have a ranch packet, so I used regular ranch dressing instead. I also didn't have the buffalo sauce (they were out at the store!) so I did the proportion of regular hot sauce & butter the back of the bottle calls for. The hot sauce really mellowed out after all day in the crockpot. It was very flavorful, but not so hot that I was running for a glass of milk. I am making this again this week!

These are awesome. I served them for my girls night about a month ago. I took the advise of other reviewers and added a couple of chicken thighs so that it wouldn't dry out. I got a lot of servings out of one pot of this dish. My husband loved it too. I topped it with coleslaw mix that can be found in the produce section of the grocery store. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe for how easy this is. If you like spicy & use a lot of Franks or similar sauces, then you'll probably like this. I only had 2 breasts & seasoned the chicken breasts first with some southwest seasoning...cooked them up a bit so I could speed up the process & only cooked them for 4 hrs. They shredded really easily but I could see if you used less sauce, them being dry. We ran out of bread & used tortillas too with a little cheese. Really good!

I doubled the recipe, and ended up with a bit too much sauce.  Will definately make double batch again, cut back on sauce and butter, and add chicken broth.

Vinegar bomb!  I added a TON of sour cream and cheese to make it somewhat edible. I used Frank's... perhaps something else would be better?

Very easy and makes for a quick dinner.  I used chicken tenders (b/c that's what I had on hand) which made the shredding really quick and easy.  We put cheese on the sandwiches when we served them which toned down the spice for me (though the recipe as it is is not hugely spicey).  My husband likes spicy so he added some sauce to his sandwich.  This one is definitely a keeper for us.  My husband suggested that the mixture would be great in one of those cream cheese dips so I think I may try that next.

DEE-Friggen-licious!:D It was sooo good and hubby loved it. Hubby had dinner with the kids and was waiting for me to get and he was litterally giddy like a five yeat old waking me up so that we could eat because he was so excited to have more. I had it with the ranch dressing on top and with cheesey potato salad on the side. For those who aren't exactly fond of the flavor of buffalo sauce amazingly you don't get that flavor. I love spicy food but I don't like that flavor that buffalo sauce has and I loved this.

This was so easy! i used Frank's buffalo sauce and it was HOT! It was too hot actually for my tastes. I had a lot left over. I may make it again just with a milder version of a buffalo sauce and add a little more ranch dressing mix.

Not my thing, but bf loves buffalo chicken so occasionally I make stuff like this just for him.  This was one of those times.  I thought it was okay, a bit spicy, but nothing special.  Bf liked it, although he said it was a bit spicy.  I asked him if it was too spicy, and he said it wasn't, although he was sweating by the time he finished his second sandwich.  LOL.  I used an entire chicken, cut up, so I doubled the sauce, which was good.  I was a bit concerned while it was cooking--it looked like too much sauce, and runny at that, but when I shredded the chicken, it was perfect.  It works just as well to use a whole chicken, just be prepared to search for bones, grisle, and skin and take it out as you shred.  It took me a bit longer to do that, but I don't regret using the whole chicken.  We don't have chicken breasts at the moment, and his parents give us these huge chickens that cook best in the slow cooker.  I put it in at about 7:30 am and took it out at 4:30 pm, so it was in there a good amount of time. Bf insisted the sandwiches HAD to have ranch dressing on them, so I served with that as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Even though my team lost, my chicken was a winner. I used frozen skinless/ boneless chicken breast. I increased the number of breast because other reviewers said that it was soupy. Mine came out nice and moist. Very spicy. I also added 1/2 cup BBQ sauce and some seasoning. Add a slice of cheese like provolone with sandwiches.

I used 3 large chicken breasts in my 3.5 qt cooker.  I added about 6oz Franks Red Hot Buffalo Wing sauce, 1/2 pkt of the ranch seasoning & after mixing, placed a thin slice of butter on each breast. Cooked on high 1.5hrs, shredded the chicken, added a bit more sauce & continued on high for 1/2hr.  Toasted & buttered our rolls & served w/Briannas Blue Cheese Dressing.  We loved it!  I rinsed off some chicken for my little guy - too hot for him. Def would make again.

My Family loved this dish. no leftovers to refrigerate.  come to think of it, that was the only complaint I got for this meal, that their were no left-overs. We will make this dish again , no doubt. I do suggest a quality buffalo chicken sauce.

This was delicious!  I used frozen chicken in the crockpot for about 4 hours, shredded it and let it another hour.  Next time, I'll either cut down the cooking time or not shred so much.  The chicken practically melted into the sauce.  It was still great though and made for great leftovers.

This was not what my family expected.  It was really salty and I think that came from the dry ranch seasoning.  I would half the ranch next time if there is a next time!

I have to say, this downright stunk while it was cooking.  But once we started eating it, it was sort of addictive.  The buns got soggy even though I buttered and grilled it.  We added Muenster cheese to the sandwiches which helped cut the tanginess of the marinade.  I did not have dry ranch, so we added a little ranch dressing at the end.  I used the Ken's Buffalo Marinade.  It was pretty good, but I will try to tweak it next time.

I put my chicken in the crock frozen and cooked on high 3-1/2 - 4 hours.  Combo'd thighs and breasts - more in keeping with typical "wing" meat.  Could've used a little garlic & onion powder, pepper, maybe a few other seasonings.  Even with the Frank's -- it tasted a little "flat".  Not bad -- just not "great".  Going to freeze some of it and use next weekend in a Buffalo DIP for Superbowl.

Awesome recipe! It made the kitchen smell sooo good during the day. I made this for dinner one night and my mom and sister loved it. My mom ate her sandwich with some garlic ranch dressing on top and added some lettuce. I had mine with cheese. I love how easy this is to prepare!

These are a huge hit in our house.  I haven't been a fan of buffalo wings so I was a little skeptical.  I am so glad I tried it. We were also a little afraid our 6yo would think these too spicy.  We were wrong. I don't know if it's the chicken being shredded or the ranch dressing and buns toning it down, but he loved them.  We even kept the homemade wing sauce the same level of heat.

I made this when I read how great it was, but I was let a little disappointed in the end.   My husband and I though it was ok, but I won't be keeping this in my recipe rotation.  Our 7 and 4 yr old thought it was so spicy they begged me for a big glass of milk.  I recommend only adding half the wing sauce that the recipe calls for and adding Pepper Jack cheese.  20 secs in microwave to melt just before serving with Ranch sauce on the bun.  It was a tremendous amount of wasted sauce and the chicken was swimming in it.

This could not have been easier!  And it was soooooo good.  I omitted the butter - it was not needed.  The chicken practically shredded itself in the crockpot b/c it was so tender.  Definitely a keeper!!

It was pretty good, I was worried about salt so I only used 1/2 a bottle of Franks red hot buffalo sauce (which is different than plain Franks red hot and less salty)  I'm glad I had some to mix in later because the spice seems to evaporate.  It was really easy.  I would consider just adding the red hot later in the process.  Cooked in 6 hours in low.

This is a delicious recipe.  After being in the slow cooker for a few hours, the chicken was tender and very easy to shred.  After I shredded it, I put it back into the slow cooker for another two hours, and the result was tender, juicy chicken.  I didn't have dry ranch salad dressing mix on hand, so I added a bit of actual ranch dressing instead. I highly recommend this recipe.  It's so simple to make, yet so delicious.

I never rated a recipe before, but I did not care for this recipe.  It tasted like I poured a bottle of vinegar over it.  I used Texas Pete buffalo sauce, maybe it was the wrong kind of sauce.

I used 4 chicken breasts and about half a bottle of Franks Buffalo Wing sauce. After about 7 hours (I was away most of the day) the sauce had separated and while the chicken was cooked, the sauce hadn't penetrated and the chicken was almost plain. I shredded it and mixed it with most of the remaining sauce from the bottle. It's not bad, but I think it may be better to just cook the chicken plain and mix in the sauce after. I couldn't tell anything from the ranch dressing, so not sure if it's needed. Not sure if I will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly how it is here; these tasted so good and were so easy to make. I used four frozen boneless/skinless chicken breasts and Texas Pete buffalo sauce. I recommend that right before the dish is ready that you shred the chicken, then let it cook a tad longer. Yum yum! I also use the remaining ranch dressing powder to make a ranch dressing that I put on my sandwich.

Nice easy recipe. I only had 2 boneless chicken breasts, so I used 2 chicken thighs as well. I boiled the meat, then cut it off the bone and added to the crockpot. Chicken shredded easily, but it did seem slightly dry, so I added 1/2 package of philadelphia cream cheese and let it warm and mixed it with the chicken and that added some extra deliciousness!

this sandwich looks very unappetizing.  The bland white roll to the bland white cheese. Hopefully, the chicken pulls it through

I doubled the meat to 6 chicken breasts, cut in half.  We don't really like a lot of spice so I only used half the Frank's Wing sauce bottle. I also added about a cup of chicken broth after shredding the chicken since it seemed dry, probably because of the changes.    The flavor of the chicken came out great!  I let the folks who wanted more spice add the Frank's on individual sandwiches.  Also served with blue cheese dressing on the side.

Delicious.  It only took 3 hours for my chicken to be done on low, then I shredded it and returned it to the pot with the butter.  Great flavor- spicy but I like it that way.

This is absolutely delicious! I've used medium and hot wing sauce, but our favorite is spicy garlic wing sauce.  The only changes I make is to use two bottles of sauce andand a whole packet of ranch.  I let it cook all day and then shred the chicken about an hour before serving.  We have made this about 10 times and I just found the recipe a month ago!

Super easy and very good! I used Archie Moore's Buffalo Sauce and added about 1/4 cup of half and half since I usually like my sauce a little creamy. YUM!

Loved this, next time I wont add the remainder of the sauce it was a little too saucy.****Update, I made these as a panini pressed sandwich with blue cheese and bacon.  I will do it this way from now on.  Make sure you drain the sauce well before placing it on the bread to press as it will get soggy.  So so good!  I also omit the butter, no  need for it.

i cut this recipe in half because it was just for the 3 of us. so i only used 2 chicken breasts i was kind of scared to use a whole thing of RedHot Frank's sauce, so i used Famous Dave's Sweet and Zesty bbq sauce like about 1/4 of the bottle and just under half a bottle of RedHot sauce.  anyways, this was absolutely delicious and so so easyy. actually, my dad had to go to the doctor for like 6 hours today so it ended up sitting in the crock pot on the "keep warm" setting for an hour and it turned out amazing. my boyfriend and dad lovedd it!!

What a great recipe. And so easy to make. I'm from Minnesota, and my family doesn't like alot of spice, so we used Famous Dave's Sweet and Zesty bbq sauce instead of what was recommended. Oh my, it was excellent! I served it Christmas Eve for an easy meal and it was a hit! Hardly any leftovers. Thank you!

This was just ok for me.  I thought it needed something more.  Not sure what the point of the ranch dressing is as you couldn't really taste it.  Maybe a full packet would add more flavor?  It could have been less spicy and a lot easier to just marinade a chicken breast and then grill it.

Just ok.  The recipe would probably get 5 stars if it included thigh meat as another reviewer wrote.  I thought that it was a bit dry and needed some more fat.

We use Franks Red Hot Sauce, by far the best brand and I always add more hot sauce! Fantastic Recipe!

Made these for a group. Everyone loved them. It was so easy and delicious. I dont know about the people who said it was dry. I added maybe a half cup of water because i was worried about it and it was nice and juicy.

Yum.. this is definitely my favorite crock pot recipe so far. I used Frank's Red Hot sauce. I followed everything exactly.. the pepperjack was the perfect touch. A bit too spicy for the kiddos though.

This recipe was fantastic!!!!!  It was incredibly easy to make too. I used the ranch dressing mix, but honestly, I didn't see the point.  Also for the reviewers who thought it was too hot, I used Franks Redhot Wings, and the flavor was Sweet Heat BBQ.   Perfect amount of heat, and if anybody wants a little more heat, use regular hot sauce to their serving.  Definitely try this.  You won't be disappointed.

I've made this recipe about 4 times in the past two months...My husband, family, friends and I all LOVE it!!!  The only thing I did different was omit the butter,  I use Frank's Buffalo Sauce and to me it tastes buttery enough.  We've also learned that chicken tenders are way easier to shred than chicken breast.  We like to serve ours on rolls w/ jalapenos, ranch dressing, and pepper jack cheese. MMMmmmmmm!!! I'm still amazed that you can put 3 ingredients in a crock pot and it turns out this YUMMY!!!

Very yummy! I followed the recipe exactly and it was really good. I used the Franks Buffalo Sauce which is the best and served with sliced tomato, red onion, romaine, provolone, and swiss cheese.  Toasting your rolls and spreading with blue cheese dressing is the kicker that takes it from good to great.

SO good and SO easy. I only did two chicken breasts in a small crock pot, 1/4 packet of ranch mix and 1/2 to 3/4 bottle of Franks wing sauce. I forgot to add the butter, but it was excellent even without it. It was spicy but not too spicy, moist but not runny... just perfect. This is going to become a regular recipe for me.

Great Sunday afternoon, football watching sandwich!  Threw all the ingredients into the crockpot and added some extra hot sauce (Cholula) and it turned out great.  I wouldn't change a thing at all.

Don't add dry ranch dressing and it is perfect.  Just add blue cheese dressing to the bun.

LOVED IT!!!  I did use bone-in, skinless thighs because we perfer dark meat.  I just picked the meat off the bones, shredded it and threw it back in the crock pot with some of the juices that were produced while cooking and some more franks redhot.  We had bluecheese dressing on our sandwiches.  Next time I will have to make alot more cause there was no leftovers for my husbands lunches.

This came out soo yummy.  We added a lot of hot sauce beacuse we love things hot.  I made this the night before thanksgiving and the next day the Lions were on (my boyfriend loves them, even though they stink!) so I threw it in the slow cooker with cream cheese, and some ranch dressing.  Made a delicious dip, perfect for the game.  Thanks!

It was ok. Definitely easy to make. You can't really go wrong with chicken cooked in hot sauce. I used Louisiana hot sauce, our fav, and it must have over powered the ranch mix because there wasn't any hint of it at all.

It was good and I can definitely see it as an easy crowd pleaser especially when the game's on.  A little too much of a ranch taste on the buffalo sauce for us though!

This was just-ok for me, I made it exactly as the recipe called. I agree with a previous rating that suggested needing some dark meat in the recipe, as the chicken breast cooked very dry and was pretty bland. With some modifications, this sandwich has some potential!

The husband LOVED it!!! I ended up getting chicken tenderloins and just trimming those a bit before putting them in the crock pot (less work then a regular breast and they were on sale). I also only cooked them on high for 2 hours and then shredded the tenderloins and then added in the sauce and the butter, cooked it for an additional 30 minutes and put it on a toasted bun and served it! I added reduced fat blue cheese crumbled to my sandwich for a little extra flavor! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

I don't often use my slow cooker, but this recipe has changed that! It was great. My husband and I really enjoyed it! It made alot, so we were able to have many leftovers but we did not mind. It was a very easy recipe to follow and it had a great taste. I plan on making again and again. Thanks for the great recipe and getting me to use my slow cooker!

This recipe is amazing if you are a buffalo chicken lover. I have made this several times and have found that using the dry ranch dressing is key to this recipe, I always add a full packet too, it helps take so the vinegar flavor isn't so overwhelming. I use franks buffalo wing sauce and I haven't added the butter yet. I serve these on Kieser buns with tomato, sliced cucumber, onion, cheese and ranch dressing. The leftover's reheat really well too!

Was ok, but not spectacular. I am very disappointed because I had been looking forward to making thse for my husband, who loves hot wings. Followed recipe exactly, and added blue cheese on top of chicken. Just didn't have good flavor in my opinion. We agreed this one won't be made again.

My family loves Buffalo chicken wings so I decided to try this recipe...especially after reading some of the reviews.  They all liked it but agreed it needed "something".  I'll be making it again and trying to figure out what that something is.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Awesome recipe! I add a little bit of chicken broth with the frozen chicken and then let it cook for about 2-3 hours. Then I shred it and add the Franks Hot Sauce and let it all cook for another hour or so. It actually tastes better reheated the second day!

DELICIOUS!  It was done after 6 hours, very tender.  We put them in a whole wheat pita and put blue cheese dressing on it and it was so good!  Will definitely make again.

This was pretty good, I used regular ranch dressing and kept everything else the same. The only thing I didn't like was that it made the bread super soggy. I'm making this for a potluck in 2 days and am going to add corn starch after shredding to thicken up the sauce.

I made this with huge expectations, based on the reviews.  We thought it was just okay.  It was very wet, and to be honest, hard to wrap our brain around the fact that it was buffalo chicken, as there was no breading.  It was worth a try, but we won't be making it again.

Really really good! I used 7 breast halves instead of 4, and it made enough for 6 or 7 sandwiches, so I'm glad I did. plus it was really soupy and If I hadnt used that much chicken it might not have turned out that well. I also didnt have to cook it for 7 hours. I dont know if my crock is hotter than normal, but it was on the low setting and ready in about 4.5 hours. Either way, really good, will be making again!

This was super easy and very good. I used about a half a bottle of a non-hot wing sauce and used an entire dry packet of the hidden valley ranch dressing mix.  I also added two "to go" packages of Dave's Sassy Barbeque Sauce - they probably have about a tablespoon each in the packages - to the mixture.  Put this on a toasted roll.  It was SO good!  Thanks so much for the recipe - I'll be making it again and sharing it with my (grown) kids.

These were really good, I only used about 1/2 the 17.5 oz bottle of Frank's and I think that was perfect. I would only cook for about 5 hours that's all it  needs. We put mozzarella and ranch on top..really good and easy!

I made this last night for dinner.  I loved the idea of putting it all in the crockpot and it be done in 7 hours.  It was so easy.  The flavor was good.  I used Frank's Redhot Wing Sauce.  The vinegar really came out in it.  I would think about trying a diffrent brand next time, but other than that we really liked it.  I also topped ours with some blue cheese dressing.  Yummy!

These are so easy, yet flavorful.  I only used a 12 oz bottle of buffalo sauce and it was enough.  In fact, it makes for a very sloppy sandwhich, so make sure you have a lot of napkins! (even after a added a tsp of cornstarch).  Served on wheat kaiser rolls with blue cheese dressing on them. Thanks for a great recipe!

OMG!  My husband was a little concerned that I was using chicken breasts instead of the traditional wings, but when he got home from work and smelled this cooking, he was so excited.  He ate two sandwiches, with his face red and eyes watering!  He can't wait to eat the leftovers.  thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Nice and simple.   I was in a rush and made this on the stove top.  Used 1 can of chicken stock to boil the chicken, shredded it with a fork in the pot when most of the juice was gone. Added garlic and onion powder.  next time i will be sure to use sodium free/low chicken broth. served with ranch dressing on the side and didnt use the packet of mix.  served on toasted keiser rolls with jack cheese.

Been waiting to try this cause all the reviews were so good.   I gotta say I think it was just ok...It needs a little more seasoning...Probably needs blue cheese chunks and liquid ranch dressing in addition to the ranch packet.  I used the hoagie rolls...toasted them, then topped with meat and cheese...and put back on oven for a few to melt the cheese.  I also used texas pete, and entire 13 oz bottle for 3 chicken breasts.  I used all the sauce in the recipe with only half the meat and I still felt it could have used more sauce, especially after I shredded it.  All in all its a good quick and easy to make recipe and I would make it again

It definitely tasted like buffalo chicken but was way too hot for my husband or I, and both of us enjoy spicy food!  Very easy to make, maybe would've been better with more ranch to cool it down...

This sandwich was underwhelming.  Both my husband and I expected great things after all of the reviews but I would say it's just a "good" recipe.  I won't make it again, but will go for something with a little more pizzazz in the slow cooker.

This was AMAZING and a new football favorite/must have!  I made this with 3 lbs of chicken breasts, used one 23 oz. jar of Franks Hot Sauce and a little over half of a 12 oz bottle (after reading other reviews used this instead of Franks Wing Sauce to cut back on the salt) and a packet and a half of ranch dresssing.  We were afraid it would be too spicy, but the ranch and butter really tone down the heat.  After reading other reviews I took it out after 6 hours, shredded the chicken then put it back in for the next 2 hours.  Also added the butter when I shredded the chicken.  Putting the shredded chicken back in the sauce made a huge difference: it soaked up the sauce and was much more flavorful.  Served on grilled hoagie and kaiser rolls with choice of cheese, slaw, extra hot sauce and ranch dressing.  The leftovers were really good as well: made another sandwich the next day for lunch and am going to make buffalo chicken pizza with the remaining.

I made this recipe exactly as written. I didn't think it was fantastic, but I didn't think it was bad either. The chicken came out a little overdone. I would consider making it again, but cook it int he slow cooker for 4 hours instead. I used Frank's hot sauce (which is the best!). I just served it on whole-wheat hamburger bun...and I put a layer of blue cheese dressing on the buns since you have to have blue cheese with buffalo wings! :) Overall, quick & easy weekday meal. Nothing I would serve to a guest though.

Everyone loved this! I doubled the recipe and it worked out great. When I took out the chicken to shred it i skimmed the fat of the top of the sauce it made it a lot lighter. I put lettuce and tomato on mine it made it very tasty.

OMGooooodness was this good!  I used fresh unfrozen chicken breasts right after I bought them.  I ended up using Kroger's mild sauce (12 oz only) since that was the only mild brand available.  Used an entire packet of the ranch dressing.  I shredded the chicken after 5 hours, added the butter and let it sit in the pot for another ½ hour.  That's all.  The level of spiciness was perfect, it was not runny at all, and the amount of sauce was plenty.  I also put a leaf of lettuce and provolone cheese when I made the sandwiches.  Everyone LOVED them.  Woohoo!!

This was one of the best recipes I have made from this website! The chicken was so tender and delicious, no modifications needed. Loved the simplicity of this recipe, throw it in the crockpot and four hours later you have a delicious meal! Thank you for sharing!

***** 5 STARS ***** I used 8 chicken breasts, cut them in half and it made the cooking time 1/2 the time when on Low.  Saved cooking time.  Shredded nicely.  Spooned leftover sauce on top of the chicken and stirred.  Bingo.  Fresh chicken for salads and sandwiches for the work week!

Wow... love that you can get the flavor of wings w/ out all the calories!!  Changes (a mix of about 100 reviews!)...  Did 4 hours in chicken stock... Drained that and cover in 10 ounces of hot sauce (4 chicken breasts) and added the ranch packet... Cooked for another 2 hours... Shredded the chicken and added sour cream (about 5 tablespoons).... Increased the heat to thicken.  It was so good.  Perfect!!!

We loved this recipe! We used Buffalo Wild Wings Mild Sauce and it turned out great, actually better than the wings. (not so much work to eat) We also tried it with shredded cheddar cheese in homemade tortillas; my husband likes it best that way.

I was really excited about this recipe because of the reviews, my family and I did not enjoy this, too bad it was so simple to put together

This was great!  I made a few small modifications, but not much.  I used precooked frozen breasts so I used about 5 of them because they were so small.  I used 3/4 of a 12oz bottle of hot buffalo sauce.  The butter was added at the beginning instead of the end, and I shredded the chicken about 5 hours in so the meat would soak up more of the sauce.    It was fairly spicy, but good!  The sauce was not soupy as I used less and let it soak into the meet.  My husband gave it a thumbs up!  Next time, I am going to add blue cheese crumbles to the sandwich :)

OMG good!!  Just made for the first time and it was great.  I used Moore's medium Buffalo Wing Sauce, poured 3/4 of a 16 oz jar over the frozen chicken breast, shredded chicken when I got home from work and added about 4 to 5 tablespoons of  my homemade ranch dressing.  When ready to eat, toasted buns, and topped buffalo chicken with blue cheese dressing, wonderful, all the great buffalo chicken flavor without the breading and deep frying.  I recommend highly.

WOW!!!! I never thought I could make something SO tasty and EASY!      I used the following and it turned out absoloutly amazing and I thought that the dry ranch seasoning really evened out the spicyness of the Buffalo sauce I used!    I used five chicken breasts cut in half and put in my slow cooker. For the Buffalo sauce I used "Lowrys" brand, I bought 3 bottles of it and used two and a WHOLE packet of hidden valley ranch seasoning, mixed it all up cooked in my crockpot for about 5 hours, shredded cooked for another half hour (the key is NOT to cook to long, the juices will soak in overnight in the fridge)    I started this around 5-6PM and stopped cooking it around 10 then put right in the fridge, packed some for my fiances lunch and he called me raving!   With the amount of sauce I used initially I didnt need to add anymore sauce afterwards :-)

I love spicy.... But the hot sauce has too much sodium.  I would make again, but would look for a low sodium brand.  Not the one I normally use on everything else

This was very good but a little salty.  I would cut back the dressing to reduce salt content.

This was extremely easy to make.  My husband LOVED it.  However I thought it was too spicey but then again it wouldn't be "buffalo chicken" if it wasn't!  ;) I will make this again for him.

I fixed this according to directions except I thawed the chicken and only needed to cook it for about 6 hours. It was SO good, SO easy and the house smelled like buffalo wings! I used the extra sauce in the pot to drizzle on my sandwich and served with bleu cheese or ranch dressing.

I made this exactly as written, using the Frank's Wing Sauce as many recommended, & I cannot believe no one else found these so salty. My husband & I couldn't eat more than half a sandwich.

This was absolutely delicious! Me and my boyfriend truly enjoyed this scrumptious chicken sandwich. I'm not sure how people found the chicken dry with so much sauce in there. Had it with burger buns (that was all that was around!) and when I make it next time, I will spring for something of a more firm bread like a ciabatta. Very easy and very tasty!

Frickin' amazing.  We used 10 ounces of frank's red hot sauce, and about 5 ounces of barbecue sauce.  We served it on sourdough garlic bread.  This will ABSOLUTELY become a staple in our home.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

this was good, but the husband didn't like it which is why i'm giving it 4 stars. I followed the directions but dumped the whole bottle of wing sauce in with the chicken and didn't save any for after.

This was very yummy. I only used 2 chicken breasts (just for BF and myself) and cut the cooking time by half. I found the seasoning made it a little on the salty side so next time I think I would just add ranch dressing to the sandwiches. Awesome with lettuce and red onion. You really need a sturdy bread for these though - I used a cheddar/jalapeno baguette.

Wow, this was great!  My husband always has wings for football season, so I figured we'd try these for less mess and less effort.  Its a great recipe!  I prefer to use Texas Pete wing sauce, and I use less than a 1/2 bottle to cook it in, and then add a little more after it's done.  Great alternative to feed a football crowd and the leftovers are excellent too :)

I think it's a good idea, but it didn't work out too well for me. Way too hearty, I suppose. I could only eat half a sandwich. Too messy also. Perhaps thawing chicken beforehand would get rid of some of the juice, but I think it would still be really messy. Wouldn't try again, but thank you. =)

YUM!  I made these just slightly different than the recipe.  I added all of the hot sauce to the chicken to cook and none at the end and I didn't add any butter.  I also added a slice of cheddar cheese to these.  So good!  I ate my sandwich with bleu cheese and my husband ate his with ranch.  He said it's a keeper and I agree!

This recipe was just ok.  It was really easy to prepare, but didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  I even added a screamin hot sauce to kick it up.  The sauce was watery and the meat really didn't absorb the flavor.  Will stick with pulled pork sandwiches instead.

Yum, I enjoyed this recipe but only gave it 4 stars since 4 out of 5 in the family really liked it.  It wasn't my husband's taste.  I used fresh breasts, probably 5 or 6 and it was fine. I did take the meat out and shred it and then poured the liquid...it was very liquidy, into a small pan and added cornstarch, brought to a boil and put bag in crockpot with meat.  I used Franks Buffalo hot sauce because that came highly recommended by a friend.  Great quick dinner.  I made the Crispy Potato Wedges from this site for a side dish.

Delicious!  I mixed everything together instead of waiting until the end to add the butter.  I used extra ranch which toned down the spicy taste just a little.  The whole family loved it.  I served with sauteed peppers and onions.  Yummy!

this is good but mine turned out SPICY! I recommend Franks Buffalo Sauce. I added a little extra ranch and butter to try and counter the heat (and I like spice!!)

We loved this recipe - it was so easy to make and was just as good as left overs the next couple days.  It could also be used as a buffalo chicken dip served with crackers and celery if you shred the chicken very finely.

This was soooo easy to make, but it was reallllly watery to me. I made my sandwich then forgot I didn't get my kids their drinks, so I got their drinks and by the time I went to eat my sandwich the bun was so soggy that I couldn't eat it. I liked that you could use frozen meat. Next time I will cook them eat with a little chicken broth or water, then shred it and add the sauce. This would be great to use as filling for enchiladas, buffalo chicken pizza, and inside wraps. I will make again. Thank you!!

Awesome!  I had leftovers and made some into a dip by just mixing cream cheese with it and adding cheddar cheese on top and baking (served w/chips).  I also made bufflao chicken pizza (blue cheese as sauce on pizza).  Loved it all 3 ways!

This was very good, very easy to make, and a healthier alternative to hot wings. Kind of messy, but very tasty.

These were good.  I did about 4 breast halves & used a 5 oz bottle of Franks & 3 oz of chicken broth. (We're not huge hot fans)  This was good for a change but I missed the true buffalo wing texture.

While the chicken was very moist, we really didn't care for the wing sauce on it.  I bought the Frank's brand, but it seemed too bitter/vinegary (?).  If I had used a honey BBQ sauce, this would be a 5 star.

These were great tasting and easy!  I like the fact that you can add more sauce at the end.  I didn't add anything for my children's sandwiches but added extra spice to mine and my husband's chicken.  I placed the chicken on the bottom of the bun, topped with cheddar and placed under the broiler to melt.  I then topped with tomato, shredded lettuce and ranch dressing.

We were disappointed at first because this was SO juicy and SO spicy that we felt like we were drinking Frank's straight from the bottle (and we LOVE Frank's).  But then we wised up and put the meat in a strainer in order to press out some of the sauce.  Much better.  Next time I will probably add more butter to help round out the flavor.  I also added ranch dressing to my sandwiches, which was tasty.

You can't get any easier than this! I used 3 large skinless breasts with the bones in because that is what I had.  I also accidentally used an entire packet of dressing mix, but it turned out okay.  The chicken was moist with a tasty, mild flavor.  Everyone was able to add hot sauce to their individual liking and those who don't care for "hot" were able to enjoy it, too. I will definitely make this again.

Altered this one a bit.  Used fresh chicken breast(6)which cut down the cooking time (2 1/2 hours on high and an hour on low) and used a new Franks Red Hot Wings sauce (Sweet Heat BBQ).  Instead of regular ranch, I used Hidden Valley's Fiesta Ranch.  Omitted the butter at the end and it turned out excellent.  The Sweet Heat BBQ sauce has some bite, but not as much as the regular Buffalo Wing sauce.  The Fiesta Ranch added a slight Southwestern taste to the sauce.  Will certainly make again and look forward to making this recipe as listed above.

This was really good, but you have to really like buffalo wings to eat it.  My husband isn't as fond of it as I am and he said it was okay.  It needs a sturdy bun to hold up to all the juice.  I made it just as directed and added blue cheese dressing and crumbles...that's how we eat hot wings where I'm from.

This was okay, I did not love it.  My 6-year-old said he liked it but he could not finish his half-sandwich.  I think it was too spicy for him.  I did not even give it to my 3-year-old.  My husband really liked it a lot, but I found it waaaay too salty and greasy, strangely enough.  I won't make it again, but my husband is enthusiastically taking the leftovers to work at the firehouse.  That about sums it up--this is a guy's recipe.

i gave this recipe 5 stars first b/c it was super easy!...i only had 3 chicken breasts, however i still used the same measurements for everything else...i think i only cooked mine for about 6 hours also...this recipe was also very good...my husband (picky eater) really liked it so that was a plus...i think next time i might add some thigh meat...overall good recipe, worth trying!

Awesome recipe!  Mine came out pretty spicy, but that all depends on the type of buffalo sauce you use.  After 6 hours of cooking, I took the chicken out and shredded it with 2 forks, then put it back in the slow cooker and cooked for another hour.  Amazingly tender. I served it with lettuce and ranch dressing to cool it down a little!

Oh happy day - I've found something that will satisfy my lust for wings! We had a cookout tonight for friends and I opted to try this out on them - lots of compliments and recipe requests (esp when I mentioned the sugg'n of using it for tailgates!) I used a 2.5 lb bag of frozen breasts, 1 bottle mild sauce, majority of another bottle of hot. Omitted butter, shredded and added more sauce for the last hour, to make sure it stayed moist/saucy. Some folks used a bun, some simply ate it by itself, perhaps with a dash of blue cheese or ranch on top. Went great with Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake from this site - thanks for the submission!

My family loved these sandwiches and the recipe was so easy...we have decided it will replace buffalo hot wings at our football tailgates this fall. We topped  our sandwiches with "Hot" Frank's Buffalo sauce and homemade blue cheese dressing.

Everyone loved this.  I liked it but it was a bit spicy for me (I'm a lightweight).  Wouldn't change a thing though, was perfect for everyone else that tried it.

1-The chicken is GREAT.  2-I don't care for Frank's Buffalo sauce...they add paprika, and it's too sweet for my tastes. So, if you want authentic Buffalo sauce, I recommend adding butter to Frank's original, OR, you can just use your fave type of buffalo sauce! 3-the sandwich...not for me and my husband. We tried eating it with the rolls, and didn't like it at all, SO, since then I serve it like a a burrito, with mexican rice, sour cream, etc. and we love it like that. 4-the chicken is great, super easy and delicious....so...make it and serve it however you like!! :) 5-we used leftovers to make buffalo chicken pizza like many other reviewers...also delicious! :)

My family loves buffalo wings and usually try to have them every Sunday evening.  We had to try these and they were AWESOME!  My 8 yo had two in a row!  I did not make any changes to the recipe and it turned out great.  I served these with veggies and ranch and blue cheese dressing.

I used RED HOT chicken wing sauce. Very spicy for me so I took the chicken out of the sauce after it was done cooking and pulled it apart and left the sauce on the side and you could add how ever much you wanted. The chicken was soo tender(I used fresh-not frozen) and delicious!

This was really delicious. However we chose a spicy garlic wing sauce to use and it was too much. I would try it again with a milder sauce.

Like some others I used ranch dip instead of dressing.  I didn't realize I purchased the wrong thing. I used Frank's Sweet Hot Sauce. The only thing I would do differently is make more.  There aren't any leftovers.

This is an amazing recipe! Really, really, really brilliantly good. I switched out the buffalo/ranch sauce for chick'n rib sauce, just because of personal preferences, and it was still amazing.

Great recipe!  My husband and I really liked it.  Make enough for leftovers - it's better the next day!!  I made the following modifications: 1. 1/2 packet of ranch salad dressing 2. Used Texas Pete Buffalo Wing Sauce 3. 1 lb. chicken breast, 1 lb thighs 4. Added 1 cup chicken stock - will omit next time because the sauce was still too thin after 4 hours and had to thicken with cornstarch.  I did not have to add the rest of the bottle. 5. Shredded chicken after 3 hours on low, it was already cooked through.   Cooked on low for another 45 mins or so.  My crockpot runs hot even on low. 6. Served melted cheddar cheese on huge crusty rolls with carrots and ranch dressing for dipping.

I put these in a wrap instead of on a bun. It was really good but I agree with another reviewer, it is not a substitute for the real thing.

I used Frank's buffalo sauce (entire bottle with 4 chicken breats) and pretty much the entire package of ranch dressing mix.  Also, used unsalted butter....DELICIOUS!!!  Chicken was very tender and the amount of heat was just right.  Definitely keeping this one!

Very spicy and delicious! I will definitely be making this recipe again, it turned out perfectly. I understand what some posters mean about it being too salty and maybe next time I'll only use 1/2 the ranch packet or omit it all together.

This recipe was so easy and so delicious. The only changes I made was after 5 hours I removed the chicken separated it with a fork and put it back in the crock pot to absorb the rest of the sauce while it finished cooking. Iserved it on a hoagie roll with Bleau cheese dressing and leafy lettuce. Delicious. My husband and I loved It. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is fabulous.  For those that say it is too spicy try melting in some cream cheese.  I use about six ounces but you can to it to taste of course.

I loved this sandwich.  I used Texas Pete's buffalo wing sauce.  It was spicy but oh so yummy.  I made it exactly with the exception of using Country Crock light instead of butter.  Also used the kaiser rolls. Made Adrienne's cucumber salad to go with. Perfect combination.

Excellent recipe. Very adaptable to make to individual tastes. Our family likes hot and spicy foods. Here are the changes I made:  Ingredients changes: 6 chicken breasts 1 12 oz bottle regular wing sauce 1 12 bottle hot wing sauce 1-oz package dry ranch mix  Pour in half of the regular wing sauce and half of the hot wing sauce with half pkg. ranch mix. Cooked 6 hours. Removed chicken and shredded. Strained the sauce from crockpot into a bowl - reserved this sauce for later.  Into the crockpot add remaining of the regular wing sauce and remaining dry ranch mix, add butter and stir to blend. Return shredded chicken to crockpot stir to blend. If needed add reserved sauce to the shredded chicken to moistened.  Initially, this dish was very spicy as we like, but after a few hours it mellowed out significantly - very mild the next day- still very delicious. Husband loved it but missed the “crunch” of wings- will crisp the  rolls next time.

If you like Buffalo sauce then this is the recipe for you! It was very spicy as expected. I added an additional tablespoon of butter. I served this with Blue Cheese Cole Slaw on top of the sandwich and the slaw was the perfect balance for the spiciness of the chicken. I found there was no need to add extra sauce on the sandwich. This is one of my most used recipes when serving a group (along with Slow Cooker Pulled Pork from this website)

A great and easy dish to make.  After five hours i pulled the chicken and then added some butter to the hot sauce before putting the chicken back in the crock pot.  It came out perfect and was a great hit on the 4th.

This was good. I used Franks buffalo sauce instead of the Red Hot. Reviewers are right in not forgetting to add the butter, it really does make a difference. The one thing I would change is adding the ranch dressing packet, or use a lot  less of it. Both my husband and I thought it was way to salty

Wonderful recipe!I had to make a few changes according to what I had on hand. I used 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken breast,baked with ranch mix and hot sauce(Franks). Then I pulled the meat after it cooled. The next day I put the pulled chicken in a crockpot with 2 pkg of ranch mix,2 bottles of hot wing sauce and 1 med. size bottle of "57" sauce. This gave it another layer of flavor. The butter brought a smoothness to it that I never imagined. Served with tortilla chips. AWESOME!!!!

I LOVE buffalo wings so I had to try this when I saw it. I used 6 breasts instead of 4 and adjusted the other ingredients for that. These were great! I had mine with a little blue cheese dressing on top and a slice of American cheese too to combat some of the heat...fantastic!! Even my picky daughter raved on these.

Great! Quick & Easy - Couldn't find pack of Ranch Salad Dressing, so I substituted Ranch Dip Mix ( Hidden Valley) -ALSO - I used bonless skinless chicken theighs - these are less expensive and tastier and basically shred by themselves.  YUM - whole family loved it!

This is a very tasty recipe. I couldn't find Frank's wing sauce so I used another brand. To avoid the dry and overcooked syndrome, I used bone in split breasts as I always do. I take the skin off (literally a three minute process) before cooking. Just peel it and cut it off. I cooked on high for 4 hours, shredded it, then returned it to the sauce for an hour on low, when I added the butter. Perfecto! served it with jack cheese and blue cheese salad dressing.

To enlighten The Alchemist about the Buffalo in Buffalo wings.  They originated in the Anchor Bar in Buffalo, NY (been there, ate there, loved it). Their fiery sauce is made on site, but there are many good bottled types available.  They're served with a side of celery and blue cheese dressing to cool your mouth in between bites of the spicy sauced wings (no, the dressing is not for dipping the wings).  Since original wings are deep fat fried, then tossed in butter, then the sauce, this recipe is a very healthy alternative.

This recipe is a keeper.  It was very easy and good.  My batch was a little salty as others commented, but I didn't notice that until after I added the butter.  Maybe try unsalted butter if you have it.  I wouldn't skip the butter because, despite the saltiness, it did improve the flavor and made it seem more like wings.

Something was missing. I'm not sure what though. I used the suggestion of butter in the sauce....It was better leftover though!

I'm giving this four stars because I loved it and my husband hated it (even though we're both huge hot wing fans).  I thought this had a great taste and the chicken was very moist, plus it was so simple!  Our chicken was done in only 5 hours.  We used half the packet of ranch mix so it wouldn't get too salty and I served on hoagie rolls with blue cheese dressing.  Loved it!

I Doubled the recipe and served the sandwiches with bleu cheese dressing.  I used to make sandwich similar to this only I didn't make it in a slow cooker or shred them.  This version is much easier. The best part was throwing the chicken in frozen.  No need to defrost the breasts.  I used a 3lb package which gave me 8 breasts. Thanks
Made this again recently.  With the leftover I used it to make Buffalo Chicken Dip from this recipe.
Thanks again for the recipe !

These had good flavor and were really low maintenance.  Perfect for those busy days when you don't have time to cook.  I just threw the ingredients together in the morning and let it go.  When we got home the house smelled great and all I had to do was shred the chicken.  The kids liked these too.  I only used about 1/2 bottle of sauce for fear it would be too spicy for them.  My husband and I just added extra sauce to ours to kick it up a notch.  My husband was a little weirded out about the shredded chicken because he usually have buffalo chicken sandwiches with a whole chicken breast.  He still really enjoyed these and liked the change from the regular stuff. Thanks for the recipe!

Very easy.  Could probably even use more chicken than what it call for.  Next time I will drain off more of the juice/sauce before putting it on the sandwiches...it was too hot for my taste and very messy and wet.

Very easy to make.  My boyfriend liked it.  It was too salty for my taste.  Will try again using different brands of sauce/dressing.  We also had them on hamburger buns and I think I'll try it on some kind of hard roll next time.

These were just ok for us.  I didn't have the dried ranch, but I made my own.  We thought it was salty, but in only had a teaspoon of salt in it so I don't know if the flavors just concentrated while in the slow cooker?  Thanks for sharing.

I'm a big fan of buffalo wings, this is a good idea, but it's just not the same.  I missed the crunchiness of the fried chicken, the darker meat with the skin and fat with the buffalo sauce all over it, using breast meat was a little odd.  Must watch this closely so you do not over cook the chicken.  I'm sure this works great for some people, just wasn't for me.
