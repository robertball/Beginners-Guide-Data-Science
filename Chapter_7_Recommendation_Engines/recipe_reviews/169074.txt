This soup was absolutely delicious and so easy to make!  I added mushrooms and onions and only had about 2 Tbsp of ginger.  Only thing I will change next time is adding the zucchini at the same time as the chicken.  They got a little bit too mushy for my taste.

I was worried about all the ginger, because I'm not much of a fan of ginger.  The broth was a little heavy with that ginger bite, but when eaten with the vegetables and noodles, it was really great.  I'll definitely do this soup again, as it was filling, easy to make, and low-cal.  I might have estimated proportions a bit, but followed the recipe and wouldn't recommend any changes.

Yummy soup.  I did make some additions but had to give it the full 5 because my kids all ate it.  I added carrots, green onions, mushrooms, and celery.  I also added a bit of soy sauce, sesame seed oil, and sweet chili sauce for a kick.

What a great healthy soup, and it was a big surprise in taste.  My whole family loved it.  I always have homemade chicken broth in the freezer for soup -- it's much, much better than canned (see my review for chicken broth).  To this soup, I added half of a chopped onion, cracked pepper, sea salt, fresh basil, and a combination of chopped zucchini and yellow squash.  I had all the ingredients onhand, except for cellophane noodles (so this was omitted) and fresh ginger (so I used small amount of ground ginger), which didn't seem to compromise the flavor.  We'll make this often.  Note:  Especially good for dieters!

Love this soup!!! I did change it up a little. Made it twice so far, first time I added carrots instead of zucchini and used gluten free noodles instead of cellophane noodles. I had to add 4 more cups of broth because of the noodles I used, but it was great.

Second time, I poached my chicken breasts first then used the water from that (4 cups worth) and added 4 cups of boxed chicken broth. I doubled the garlic and ginger root because of the extra liquid. I used 1 cup of frozen peas instead of zucchini. I used 2 cups of shredded chicken and 4 cups of spinach and a box of gluten free shell pasta. I love this stuff!! better the second time with the increased garlic and ginger.

Thank you for a great recipe that is also very flexible!

Excellent! I admit I was a little scared of 3 tbsp of ginger, but it really does mellow out so go for the full amount. This fits perfectly into my diet - low calorie and low carb with a good amount of protein. I ended up adding an extra 2 cups of broth because the soup was really thick. Even then, this definitely is not 8 servings (unless you're planning on tiny bowls).  I'd say this is 4 servings if you want a decent-sized portion - so 210cals. Still very healthy!  The flavor was good as written, but i then added some sliced green onion for garnish and a couple dashes of fish sauce. This would also be excellent with a squirt of lime juice, or some thinly sliced jalapeno. Yum!

I really enjoyed the flavor of this soup, but next time I will use more chicken broth or skip the cellophane noodles.  I liked my first bowl so much, I went back for seconds and the noodles had soaked up ALL of the broth.

The cellophane noodles did soak up all the soup, but I liked it better that way.  I substituted tofu for the chicken and added mushrooms.  Delicious!

Awesome! The broth is sooo flavorful! I add thinly sliced carrots, few shakes of soy sauce, and an extra cup of broth. Next time, I will add 2 extra cups of broth. Thank you for this delicious and healthy recipe!

I used dry ginger spice, added fresh sliced green onions and omitted the noodles. Served with a squeeze of lime and fresh cilantro on top. Gave it a Vietnamese spin.

Very good. I used low sodium chicken broth. I didn't have any cooked chicken already so I used 4 chicken breasts for a double recipe. Perfect as is. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good! Great taste. I used udon noodles to accommodate a special diet in our home. I had to add a bit more broth, perhaps because the different noodles? LOVED IT, will make again!

My whole family loves this dish and they rarely all love the same thing.  It can be a complete meal by itself (although we often add a cold side-vegetable for the complete dinner), is easy to make, and is inexpensive (especially when we get a Costco roasted chicken for $4.99.)  This is a regular dish in our house.  Thank you AllRecipes!

I sauteed onion with garlic, two jalapeno peppers and the zucchini in olive oil, first. I still added more garlic (because I love it!) to the broth with the ginger but increased the broth to six cups so I could add more zucchini (because I love it!) and I used shrimp instead of chicken (because I love it!) I also garnished it with avocado slices (because I love them!)

We Loved the soup! I made a double batch added 10 cloves of garlic(yummmmm) and also some kale. I didn't have any noodles so left that out,but the soup was thick enough without. This soup is a winner!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, I liked it. It is light and easy to make, also tastes good.
I would add more garlic, and it is missing something maybe potatoes and mushrooms would give it a more elevating taste.

What a great spin on chicken noodle soup. I thought the ginger would over power since it has such a distant taste amongst lighter flavors but it blended great. I did use powered ginger instead of fresh grated though, not sure if that made a difference. I added more garlic just because I’m a fan, a little mushroom power and adobe. Also subbed carrots for the zucchini. Quick, easy to prepare and light. Loved it :-)

I'll be trying this again with some adjustments. I liked everything in the soup except the broth was terrible it tastes like a mouth full of ginger. You might as well just take a bite out of a raw piece of ginger. Next time I'll try just 1 or 1/2 Tbsp of ginger instead of three

I found this soup easy and fast to prepare/make. I liked the mild flavor and once in a bowl on the table I added to it,  a splash of fish sauce, tamari and lemon juice. Doesn't need much to add a bit of flavor, so don't over do the splashes.

This was a tasty, light, healthy soup. I added some minced shallot to the garlic and ginger. A bit of grated Parmesan, when served, added additional flavor. Very easy to make.

Very tasty, I am home sick and needed a quick soup recipe. This is very good, I do recommend upping the broth amount if you are craving more liquid and less of a thick soup. I also cheated and used the meat from a rotisserie chicken so I could get back to the couch ASAP which worked out great. Looking forward to this for the remainder of the weekend.

i think i was expecting something more bold like a hot and sour soup with all the ginger.. it was a bit on the bland side for me.. this was alright as is but nothing to write home about
