Breakfast today was this salsa served with cinnamon-sugar baked tortilla chips.  If you need a recipe for the tortilla chips, see Annie's Fruit Salsa and Cinnamon Chips on this site.  I had fresh pineapple, so I used that instead of canned, and the orange, strawberries, and kiwi were perfectly ripe, so I didn't need the sugar.  Just simple, fresh fruit flavor at its best!

I've made Strawberry Salsa many times over the years and also serve with cinnamon chips for dipping. Agree with previous post, I use fresh pineapple so no need for adding white sugar especially if using in season Strawberries. I've found when making ahead, the Kiwi turns a bit pink and "slimy" in appearance. Omit the Kiwi if you're making the previous day. Fresh Mango is a great addition.
