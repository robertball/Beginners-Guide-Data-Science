Being from Iowa, I would have to say that the addition of sugar to fresh sweet corn is sacriledge, lol.....as well as unnecessary. Real sweet corn will not need it!! But this is a good idea if you have to use corn from a can; drain about half the liquid, add a couple pats of butter, a tsp. or so (to taste) of sugar and a dash of salt. Simmer while you get the rest of the meal together, serve. Makes canned corn pretty tasty!

When I visited Trader Joe's today, they had corn on the cob--unusual for them, so I picked up a couple of ears, remembering this new recipe.  I scaled it to 2 servings, and I added only half the salt but all of the sugar (we don't have sweet corn here in Socal this time of year, if ever!).  I was hoping it would be like creamed corn, and it was in texture.  If I make it again, I would reduce the sugar to 1/4 and leave the salt at 1/2.  But it was good, and it lives up to its name.  It may be a good jumping off point for other additions--like minced sweet red peppers or something.  I love the idea of this, so I'll play with it!

This simply was not any good.  We followed the recipe to a T (how could you not with as few of ingredients) and nobody in my family enjoyed this.  Much easier to simply stick to buying good sweet corn.

I followed this recipe exactly, scaled down for the 1 corn on the cob I had left. I was worried it would be too sweet, but the sugar actually wasn't bad. For the most part the additions just bring out the flavor of the corn. The only thing was the salt. It was bearable for me because I like salt so much, but I would cut it by half first, then go up from there. I didn't miss the butter in this recipe at all. A healthier version of fresh corn on the cob, or a nice recipe for canned corn. Will make again. Thanks Nathan!
