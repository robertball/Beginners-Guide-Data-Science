It was quite tasty, but a little dry.  Maybe it was the meat I used.  It had very little fat in it.  Husband enjoyed the unusual flavour of the mint in such a beefy dish.  Easy to prepare for an evening meal.

I love all the ingredients in this recipe, but I did not enjoy this dish.  The final product came out soggy and bland.  It was not unpleasant so I think I may tamper with cooking process by baking the stuffed zucchini in the oven, add more spices and veggies.
