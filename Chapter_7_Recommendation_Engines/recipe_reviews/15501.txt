Tons of flavor!! Instead of wraping the asparagus in individual bundles, I put them in a baking dish and covered them. I will absolutely make this again, although maybe next time cut the garlic a little. Think I'll keep my distance from my co-workers tomorrow!

My fiance and I were very impressed with this recipe. I didn't make mine with thyme or cloves of garlic. Instead, I used minced garlic, about 1 1/2 cup and poured white cooking wine in the bag. The flavor was FANTASTIC, especially if you're a garlic lover, as we are. Thanks for this one!

I minced the garlic and only used about 10 cloves. Used a few tsp of crushed thyme rather than fresh. Added some salt and pepper. I prefer asparagus on the crisp side, so I would decrease the baking time next time to 15-18 minutes. Served with whole wheat couscous and Parmesan cheese for a vegetarian meal. As a meal, this recipe made 2 servings.

I was trying to imitate an asparagus dish I had at a restaurant, and this was it! The only things I did differently were substituted wine with a drizzle of butter because I didn't have any wine...and I added cashew peices because it seemed like it would go well with the dish--and it did! I will definitely be making this again.

This is great!  Love it, love it, love it!  For those people who didn't like it, I'm betting that you don't like asparagus to begin with.  Hey, I don't like peas -- I wouldn't expect some great recipe to change that!  LOL
So, if you like asparagus, give this a try -- definitely yummy!

I made this on Easter Sunday to go with my roasted leg of lamb & it was awesome. I was a little nervous to serve it to our guests from Idaho (where asparagus grows wild) but they LOVED it! I made one big batch only because I found out too late that I didn't have enough foil to split it up.  It was perfect except it needed salt & it tasted AWESOME reheated or even cold the next day too!  I'll definitely make this again. Thanks Robyn!

Good, but it needs tweaking.  The wine was a little too strong in the flavor, and it needs more spicing.  I did add some garlic salt to the recipe, which I think helped, but it needed more salt, amongst other things.  Next time I'll also stick it under the broiler for a couple of minutes to give it more of a roasted taste.  I'll have to play with it.

I absolutely love this recipe, I omitted the wine and use dried thyme instead of fresh and salted a bite when done. I also cooked a little longer until the garlic carmelized more, it was fabulouse! Will definitely make again!

Not our favorite.  Too much wine and the garlic needs to be crushed.  I might try this again with less wine and add some butter.

My other half said it was the best asparagus I ever made! Personally I would have liked a little stronger garlic flavor and I thought it a tad bitter. Maybe the addition of a sprinkle of garlic powder and a sweeter white wine?

Very good! I added salt and pepper and accidentally forgot the thyme, but it was still yummy. I've never done white wine with asparagus, I really enjoyed it. Thanks for the recipe!

I used dried thyme since I didn't have any fresh and diced my garlic cloves. I probably would do 2x as much asparagus next time because there was plenty of flavor to go around! Good thing I'll be working from home tomorrow!

Simple recipe, strong flavor, a different way to prepare a vegetable that I sometimes get tired of.

This recipe was just okay. There was nothing special about it. It seems to me that it would taste better with dill instead of thyme. I won't use this recipe again.

Like the recipe said, this was easy with little clean-up after. Instead of doing individual packets, I lined a baking dish with foil and covered it with additional foil. Since I was baking this with something else that required the oven to be set at 400 degrees, I cut the cooking time to 15 minutes. The asparagus didn't suffer at all, and came out bright green and crisp-tender.  I minced the garlic instead of using whole cloves which gave it a more even garlic flavor. This is a tasty departure from traditional steamed asparagus where the additional ingredients enhanced, rather than detracted from, the wonderful asparagus taste.

This didn't have as much flavor as I expected. We make a pan cooked version of asparagus and chopped garlic that has much more flavor ... and there is also a roasted version of the same that is better (not cooked in foil, but roasted dry on the pan). This might have tasted better if the garlic were chopped up rather than whole cloves.

l LOVED the individual packets! it was easy to serve on to plates and there was no mess! however, this was my first time roasting asparagus, i usually saute. i didn't like how soft it was. maybe next time i won't leave it in as long.

I did what a couple other reviews did, and put the ingredients in a dish and covered with foil.  I took the foil off and roasted another 10 minutes.  Excellent!

I've never really liked asparagus, but when I tried this recipe, I could not believe how good it tasted!!!! I have tried it with fresh green beans and also some other vegetables.  They all tasted great. You have made me eat my vegetables again!!

Like one of the other reviewers, I did not use white wine. Instead I used clarified butter. The flavor of this recipe is amazing. If I were to change one thing though, other than the butter, it would be to put the garlic in the oven about 20 minutes ahead of the asparagus. That way they are ready at the same time.

A great way to prepare asparagus!  I cooked in one large foil packet and used botttled, chopped garlic (5 tsp), chardonnay and 2 tsp dried thyme.  Also roasted for more like 12-15 minutes. Any longer it would have been overcooked.  My husband and 3 older kids (ages 11-6) loved it, my 2 year old not so much.

I ended up putting it all into one pot with a lid that could go in the oven. We also added an onion and some shrimp and mushrooms. My son with Down's was so excited. He said it was the best thing I'd ever cooked. We all agreed it was wonderful. Even though we added the other things, it was still your recipe that made it all work.

These were fairly good. I like the natural flavor of asparagus and this dish seemed to mask the flavor to me. That might be a positive for many people trying to eat more asparagus!

Would have been 5 stars had I not overcooked it.  While I did cut the serving sizes down to 4 instead of the original 6, I still think that you don't need to cook it for 20 minutes...maybe 15 at most.

This asparagus was not so much roasted, as is suggested, but steamed with the wine, oil and its own juices. The end result was very like canned asparagus, but with a sometimes unpleasantly overwhelming flavor of thyme. Even the garlic cloves came out devoid of flavor. Though easy to prepare, and quick, it was a waste of aspargus.

I tried to make this recipe without the wine and without the foil packets.  Instead I used a 2 quart covered pyrex dish.  I baked it for 25 minutes and they were done to perfection, but the flavor wasn't anything special as it seems it would have been had I used the foil packets method.

My husband and I adore asparagus, and this is  a great new favorite.  Using the foil makes for an easy cleanup.  It's fun to change it up with different herbs, and I like to keep the asparagus whole for a pretty presentation.

This was very good and easy. I tossed in a few mushrooms and they were delicious--I'm going to use this recipe for a whole batch of them. Definitely needs salt and pepper, though.

I loved this recipe! I changed a couple of things though. I used a chardonay and instead of fresh garlic, I used garlic powder. I also placed the asparaus in a glass baking dish covered with foil instead of the packets. I will definitely make this again!

I threw everything in one foil packet, doubled the thyme and it turned out just fine, although, I did have to increase the roasting time by about 10-15 minutes.

This was pretty good. I had to bake it @ 450 because that's the temp my other things were baking at. It turned out stringy and sort of slimy at parts. Good idea, but I think I'll just steam it next time.

This was a good recipe. I just used 1 bunch of asparagus, and I don't think it was 3 cups.  I minced up 4 cloves of garlic, which was plenty.  I also cut the wine down to 2 Tbsp and added salt.  I put this all in one pouch.

This was an above average dish, easy to make but not quite a 5 star in my book.  Will probably make again, but will keep looking for other asparagus recipes.  I didn't do indivdual bundles, as others I cooked in a covered casserole dish.  Color of asparagus fine, presentation really nice.

My family loves asparagus, as well as, garlic and spices. It may just be my oven, but it took forever for the asparagus to get even close to tender. I did also added some fresh green beans-they turned out good.

Very easy recipe and very tasty. I loved it!!!! Ended up eating a whole pound in one sitting. Next time I will cut the garlic a little. I am a garlic lover, but it was a bit much for me. I also had no thyme, so I can't say how it would be with the additional seasoning. However, I loved it without.

The recipe "as is" was a little bland for me. I did add some shallots during the roasting. But at the table I added Pecorino cheese. It was easy to prepare and cooked along side the Herb, Garlic and Bacon Pork Loin.

The asparagus turned out slimy and overcooked. I will stick with either steaming or grilling directly under the grill. Ideal for those used to eating canned vegetables only.

Simple, yet awesome! The garlic comes out soft as butter. Makes some toast rounds out of a baggette and spread the roasted garlic on it.

This gets a major thumbs down. I usually have asparagus just steamed with a bit of butter and lemon.  This recipe does asparagus a disservice. 

The favor is bland and has a bitter edge. I tried using fines herbes when steaming in the packet but it didn't help. 

I will not make this again. I like the steaming in a foil pouch concept but I would try it simply with a bit a water of vegetable broth and a lemon wedge.

Yum!  This recipe is so easy anyone can fix it!  If children like asparagus then this will be a huge hit -- mine don't.  Only down side might be that portions are too small.

I tossed the asparagus with 8 oz cremini mushrooms, olive oil, minced garlic, salt and pepper and put in a casserole. I added the wine and baked it for 25 minutes with the lid on and 10 minutes without the lid. It turned out perfectly and everyone enjoyed it!

Served this last night as a side with jagerschnitzel (fron Guy's Big Bite) it was wonderful!!  My step daughters, husband and myself couldn't get enough, no left overs...The only changed I made was I replaced wine with butter and did it in one large foil pack.  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

Fresh thyme really makes a difference on this one. I add extra too. I don't really care for asparagus, but my other half loves it, so I tried this for a special dinner, and I think I am changing my mind on asparagus. Other reviewers are definately right, this is for garlic lovers, I minced mine instead to increase the flavor.

The wine flavor was not as strong as I would have liked.  Tasted as good as simply sauteing the asparagus in butter, garlic, wine sauce.

I have to agree with a previous reviewer about the appearance. Usually, I briefly steam asparagus, shock it in iced water, then pan fry it or whatever, and it retains its lovely bright green color. This definitely wasn't the case with this recipe. The flavor was decent but it really didn't look very appetizing. Thanks anyway!

This was ok, but I agree with some of the reviewers said it was similar to canned asparagus.  The cooking method made the color go from a vivid green to a very dull, almost grey-looking green.  The flavor was just ok.  And I wouldn't call this "roasted".

I served this with "Mediterranean Lemon Chicken" also from this site.  YUM!  I really loved them. These are very easy and look amazing.  Thank you Robyn for a great side dish.  BTW, I love the way the garlic turned out!  I think I died and went to heaven!  well.. almost.. teehee.  This is a perfect side for a romantic meal for two. ;)

My family thought this was a good way to make asparagus. I only had a can and I didn't know how to make it so I tried this way.  As far as canned asparagus goes this was pretty good. I put everything in a foil pack and put on the grill for a few minutes until it was warmed.
If I ever get another can of asparagus I will make it this way.

Okay. Asparagus cooked much faster than garlic, so cloves weren't really edible. I threw all in one package and replaced white wine with red.

I didn't care for this recipe.  Being winter I tried it on my Foreman grill.  Thought it was bland.  Will stick w/ my tried-and-true steamed and topped w/ garlic vinaigrette dressing.

Very good however I rather cook asparagus in a pan in water instead of the oven, however it does produce more flavor.

I shared this recipe with a friend and 
she loved it as much as I did. I omit
the wine and substitute 1 tsp dried thyme for 
the sprigs of fresh, but kept everything
else the same. It comes out fabulous every
time and is so easy!

I found the garlic a little too strong - second time I made it I cut the garlic in half and it was much better.  Easy way to prepare asparagus!!

Very yummy way to use asparagus.  Easy to prepare and the cooking time really sweetens the garlic.
