So great and seems super fancy but is really simple.  If you can use your food processor to quickly grate the cheese, it is even easier since grating is the most time consuming part.  The kirsch and nutmeg are certainly the secret ingredients!

Excellent! I did add a little lemon juice to my wine before adding the cheese and did coat my cheese with flour before adding to wine. It turned out perfect. No problems at all.  Used for bread and steamed veggies.  It was a hit with my crowd.

Not to be picky but the recipe mixes Fondue and Raclette. Cornichons, pearl onions, and potatoes are part of a Raclette recipe. All delicious.
