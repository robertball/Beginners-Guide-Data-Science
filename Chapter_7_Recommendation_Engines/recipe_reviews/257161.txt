Obviously this recipe makes a ton of muffins.  I halved it, and reduced the oil to half.  Didn't have pineapple so I subbed in some raisins.  My family and friends raved about them.  They tasted like carrot cake.  I didn't tell them the 'secret' ingredient (carrot pulp) until later because the idea of using a pulp turns people off.  But what a great use for pulp!
