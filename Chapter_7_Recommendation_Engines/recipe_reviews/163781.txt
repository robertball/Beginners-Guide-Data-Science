This recipe was excellent and very easy to make. It took about 3 zucchini in order to get the 3 cups required. Definitely make sure you let the zucchini drain after grating it as it is extremely juicy, I took a large spoon and mashed it in the colander to get a lot more juice out. I tried it in a bundt pan which took about 50-55 minutes and came out extremely moist. Highly recommend this recipe!!

Fantastic! This recipe used the most zucchini, but sooooo much sugar. I cut the sugar to 1/2 Cup each white and brown. Sweet enough with the applesauce. And I used half white and half whole wheat flours. And to get the moisture out of the grated zuke, just squeeze it in your hands. Very moist and delicious. With the spices, it kinda reminded me of pumpkin bread. We loved this more than the chocolate zucchini cake. I made it twice this week already.

Very good and moist. I cut the white sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and it was plenty. I frosted with cream cheese frosting (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Cream-Cheese-Frosting-II/Detail.aspx). I also used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, pinch cardamom, nutmeg & 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice. Really good!

This cake was awesome!  I have never before commented on a recipe I've used from this site but this cake turned out perfectly.  So perfect, in fact, that I made it twice in one week.  (My brother and sister-in-law were visiting and ate up the first one.)  Thanks for sharing!

Very simple to make. Next time I will have to add some raisins. Some things I altered were the spices and applesauce, instead I just used a Tablespoon of pumpkin spice and 4 Tablespoons of butter.

This cake is extremely moist & very delicious! I made it according to your recipe except my applesauce was not unsweetened and I frosted it with cream cheese frosting & chopped walnuts. I've had 3 requests for the recipe and oodles of compliments. Thanks for sharing!

What a great cake! I did lighten it some with excellent results. I used 2 eggs & 1/2 cup egg substitute, 2 cups of all-purpose flour & one cup of whole wheat, and 1 cup of white sugar & 1 cup of Splenda. Fabulous! Thank you, BECCARAE1!

Took much longer to bake than in the directions. I added 3/4 cup carrots decreased the oil by 1/4 c and added 1/2 c more applesauce. Next time I'll completely omit the oil because its still very moist. Delicious nonetheless!

I don't have a grater or food processor, but I do have a blender, so I needed to puree the zucchini in the blender with liquid.  I figured this would give me too much liquid from the zucchini, so I needed to reduce the amount of other liquid -- I therefore reduced the oil to 1/4 cup.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose flour (I always do when baking).  The cake was great!  My husband complained about it (b/c he doesn't like the idea of zucchini in dessert) but he asked for seconds every time I served it.

This was very very good! I doubled the spices and used both coconut flakes and walnuts and it turned out very moist and tasty. Topped with a coffee-chocolate glaze, and my family loved it.

I absolutely loved this recipe! There is so much zucchini in our garden and I've been trying to think of ways to use it all. My family liked this so much that they want me to use all of the zucchini for this! In the past two days I have made five of these cakes for family and friends and everyone has loved it! For a special event, I would suggest topping it off with penuche frosting.

I made this for work and it was like a swarm of locusts--entire cake gone in one hour. People are still commenting that they loved it! Only problem I had was that the top of the very middle of the cake was a little soggy.

I thought this cake was great. I did try to make it a little healthier by cutting 1 cup of the white sugar and substituting 1 cup of unsweetened apple sauce for the oil. Cooked a little longer than the suggested time but it was very tasty. Very close in taste to a carrot cake.

I took this to work.  Got some positive reviews but everyone seemed to agree, it was better when cool whip was added rather than eating it plain.  Mine came out too moist - perhaps I didn't drain the zucchini well enough.  I probably won't make this again.

One of my co-workers gave me a gigantic zucchini. I was going to make zucchini bread with it, that's until I saw this recipe! The only change I made to the recipe was to reduce the sugar to 1 cup white and 1 cup brown. It was plenty sweet enough. I think I'll leave out the ground cloves next time (personal choice). All in all, the cake does deserve 5 stars. It's very moist and tasty!

I made a half recipe and had to use 2 cups of zucchini because that is what I had in the freezer.  I added coconut and pecans.  This recipe is great!! Family loved it - I will make this again.

This is a moist, tasty, rich yet simple cake that I would make over and over again. I used a piece of a giant tough zucchini that had seeds the size of pumpkin seeds (I scraped out the seeds first of course) and it still turned out tender and sweet.

Not wanting to overload my son with sugar, I made this cake for his first birthday and topped with a cream cheese frosting. Everyone raved about this cake! The best part is that my son had a wonderful birthday party and no sugar crash after. 

I should mention that like other reviewers, I cut the sugar down to 1 cup each and the oil to 1/4 cup. It was perfect.

This was really good. I did make a few modifications.  Cut down the sugar a little and left most of the liquid in the zucchini.  Made the batter thinner and was super moist.  This is a recipe I will be making again.

Simply amazing cake.  Both moist and dense, just like the description says.  Everyone who tried is was instantly in love.  I decreased the white sugar to 1 1/2 cups and it was still way sweet.  I added unsweetened coconut flakes and some chopped pecans.  I bake a LOT and this cake is a keeper.  Incredibly good.

This was moist and quite good.  I did cut the sugar by a half cup and added about a tablespoon of maple, oh, I also ended up w/ over 3 cups of zuch and all went into batter-was fine.  We topped w/ 'lite' cream cheese frosting.  I think I will top next one w/ broiled coconut frosting as it didn't occur to me until we were eating it.   really, frosting not needed as cake is quite moist.  
Thank you for sharing.

Giving this five stars because it is very pretty, smells amazing and tastes a solid 4.5! Followed directions exactly (which I never do) and I would decrease the oil to 1/4 cup next time. I let the grated zucchini sit in a strainer pressing on it from time to time. It probably sat draining for an hour. I squeezed the liquid out of it too! LOTS of liquid came out of the zucchini. Do not ignore this step!

I baked it in my convection oven at 350 for 45 minutes and it is perfect. Trying to use up summer zucchini and sneak green veggies into my 16 year old. Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely make it again.

I started out using the recipe as posted and it is very good! Currently, I only use half the amount of brown and white sugar called for. I have found the applesauce adds enough sweetness. I also add 1 cup of dried cranberries(craisins) which are also somewhat sweetened. I do not find that the reduction in sugar changes the outcome or the overall flavor. This is a great recipe, everytime I make it and give it to the neighbors, they love it.

Good taste and nice texture. However, this is a pretty time-consuming cake to put together.

I hate to give this recipe a low rating but unfortunately my family didn't really like this cake. We thought it had a strange texture and my husband thought it was too oily. Looking back at the recipe, I'm wondering if it was the applesauce that gave it a strange texture we didn't like. It's hard to say because I never use applesauce in my cakes. I wouldn't let this review discourage you from making it, though, judging by the perfect rating it has. It just didn't work us. Thanks anyway.

very very good! and a hit with my friends.  my first try was with a cup of plumped raisins - mmm!  I'll be trying several other options; carrots next I think!  it doesn't need it, but this would be a great cake with cram cheese frosting.

This recipe made the cake just so moist and wonderful, but I think the changes I made to it gave it an extra zing.  PLEASE try these additions - it makes it healthier/tastier!

I doubled the amount of cloves,
used only 1 and 1/2 cup of brown sugar,
used oat flour (ground 1 and 1/2c rolled oats),
added 1/2 cup of walnut pieces,
added 1/2 cup of craisins,
added 1 medium apple, cut into small cubes, and
added orange zest (grated the entire surface of 1 medium orange).

WHAT a win.

I made muffins instead of a cake (cooked 20-25 minutes; 23-24 muffins).  I cut sugar down to 3/4 c white and 1/3 c brown - can't imagine using the full amount.  Also, cut oil to 1/2 c and increased applesauce to 1 1/4 c.  OK I guess I really played with the recipe but it turned out great!

I used half the amount of white sugar because I felt it would be too sweet for us.  I recommend putting the zucchini in a clean linen towel and squeezing all the moisture out.  I used my mini bundt pan to make little cakes and  dusted them with powdered sugar.  They came out beautifully.

My  friend gave me a zucchini and thought I would try this cake.  It is delicious. After reading the reviews I made some adjustments.  I used 1/2 cup of white and brown sugar, cut the oil down to 1/2 cup and increased the applesauce to 1 1/2 cups.  It was sweet enough for us. Next time I might try reducing the oil a little bit.  Will freeze at least half of cake since there are only two of us and I could see myself eating it all day long.

Is good, but maybe needs a little more cinnamon or allspice. I added walnuts. Squeezed water out of shredded zucchini, still very moist. The pan was heavy . I used cream cheese recipe  from allrecipes.com in my favorite saves,which was yummy !

I am basing the four stars on the original recipe.  On the advice of other reviewers, I reduced the sugar to 1 cup white and 1 cup brown.  My family and I thought that this was still a little sweet, especially since I added a cream cheese frosting.  Next time, I will try 3/4 cup each white and brown sugar.  For an add-in, I used some chopped candied ginger, maybe 1/4 cup.   I do think the texture is excellent and just the right moisture.  I will make it again!

Update: I made it again with 3/4 cup each white and brown sugar.  The sweetness was just right.  I will still add a cream cheese frosting because I like that with all cakes like this.

This was great recipe, squeezed the zucchini and that worked great. But i cut the sugar in half and it was still a little too sweet. Will probably do a half cup of each  sugar as the other reviews said next time. Also added a teaspoon of ground ginger. Will make again!

Made this cake twice in 2 days. I reduced both sugars in half as did many others. I doubled the vanilla and cinnamon and left out the cloves. I used 4 cups of zucchini fresh from my garden.  Also added raisins and walnuts . Delicious with or without cream cheese frosting.The first cake was a hit at work and the second cake was for visiting relatives. This is a keeper. I will make it many more times

I thought this recipe was alright, but members of my family asked why I didn't just go ahead and make a carrot cake (one of their faves)-they were not crazy about it. I had to make it for my birthday (my day-my choice of cake).

I made this to use up a HUGE zucchini that a coworker gave me from her garden.  Delicious!  The only thing I changed: I didn't have applesauce so I used 4 tbsp butter instead.   It came out moist and yummy.  Lots of rave reviews from friends and family.  I also liked that you can taste the spice.  And so easy! Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely make this again.

Perfect snacking cake, lots of flavor!  After going over other reviews, I made the following changes - which also brought down the calorie count to 150 cal.
Reduced white sugar to 1 C.; reduced oil to 1/4 C; increased unsweetened applesauce to 1.5 C; increased cloves to 1/2 tsp.
This is a keeper!

This is probably the most forgiving cake recipe I've ever made.  I wouldn't ordinarily rate it because of the number of subs I made, but I think it's worth noting that you can really adjust this recipe.  I'd been looking through a ton of gluten free recipes and didn't realize this wasn't one until I was already committed.  When it came time for the flour, I saw that I was nearly out.  So I used a cup of GF flour, 1.5 c of almond flour, and 0.5 c of oatmeal.  I used a cup of oil because I didn't have applesauce.  I eliminated 1 cup of white sugar, and still could've cut it back to 3/4 c each of brown and white, I think.  (The four stars are for the original recipe having way too much sugar.)  I used walnuts.  Often I don't like the weird mouth feel of GF flour but there's so much going on in this cake that it wasn't noticeable.  I included a cup of walnuts and didn't put icing on it because even with the reduced sugar, it's still very sweet.

BEST cake i have ever made! My family didn't like the whole zucchini in a cake thing but they quickly fell in love too! Just added a cream cheese frosting to it because  cake has to have frosting, right, but it was EXCELLENT without also! Yum yum yum

Loved it! Like others, I cut the sugar by using a scant cup of white sugar and scant cup granulated white Splenda along with the specified 1cup brown sugar. I also opted to throw in flaked unsweetened coconut  (abt 3/4C) as my family does not like either raisins or nuts in cakes. Also, listened to other commenters and ensured the zucchini was very very well squeezed out. 
Will make it again for sure, and already fwded the recipe to the one person besides my immediate family who loved it too! Thanks for sharing!!!

This is a most delicious cake.  Great for using up  the extra Zucchini in the garden.  Made the cake according to directions with one exception I used Splenda instead of sugar.  It is a moist yummy cake hard to stop at one piece.  I have a favorite carrot cake but I think this one is replacing it!  So good with cream cheese frosting.

This cake was great. Supper moist and flavorful. The only thing different I did was to add more spices and increased the salt by 1/4 teas.

This one is a definite favorite. I make it for my mom every year and purposely buy one of those huge zucchinis for it.

Best moist zucchini cake I've ever made.  I used 1/2 cup of Stevia & 1 cup of Xylitol & added a can of drained crushed pineapple instead of using sugar.  Turned out amazing.  I also added 1/2 cup of ground flax seed.  Because I like more spice I used a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon & 1/2 tsp of both cloves & nutmeg.  Tasted like pumpkin pie.  My boys RAVED about it!
