Guys Guys Guys - its xanthe here, the recipe published omitted some crucial details. 
1. Only use egg mayo - not the regular kind - that would be grose!
2. Brush or spoon on the sauce (dont triple it!) cause it needs to cook and brown - The sauce is not a dipper at all. 
3. You cook this in the griller in your stove not on a barbeque at all! Line your tray with foil and you should be able to spoon off the potatoes when ready and disgard the foil - no biggie!
4. Everything else is to taste...garlic or no garlic, cheese if you like - you decide.
I have had so much success at making these so I hope that helps.

YUM!! We enjoyed these potatoes so much that we had them two nights in a row. This is what i did: I used real Mayo (not Miracle Whip) and added alittle extra garlic (because we like it). The first night I followed the recipe and boiled the potatoes and I think after the baking, they were just alittle over-cooked - SO, on the second night, I microwaved them for ~10 minutes on high. They were PERFECT after the baking. When blending the ingredients together, I litely coated the potatoes before putting them into a roasting foil bag. I tried baking in the oven (375 degrees for 20 min.) and the second night, I put the foil bag right on the BBQ. Both methods worked great! Give this recipe a try. I think you will like it. Thanks for sharing! :)

Great recipe!  I used a small foil pan lightly sprayed with Pam - this always works great for potatoes on the grill.  I partially microwaved the potatoes vs. boiling and added a chopped onion.  I used 1/2 tsp. of oregano, 1/2 tsp. of italian seasoning, a little parsley, and added a couple of tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the mayo mixture.  You can use light mayo as well to cut down on fat.  I covered the pan with foil and these were great on the grill - perfect with steak.

These are a solid 4 stars - I did read the submitters rating and she never intended this to be done on the outside grill - using the broiler would work great.  I thought they were lacking something and added a sprinkling of Smoked Paprika and a touch of parsley.  Next time I would add the smoked paprika to the mayonnaise mixture and also do a spicy dip for them.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

DELICIOUS!I was hesitant to try this recipe because the the less than positive review. However, I used an aluminum pie plate sprayed with PAM and had no sticking problem whatsoever. The topping is even better when grated parmesan cheese is added to the mix. Made this for company last night and received rave reviews.

These turned out so good. I added sour cream, smoked paprika, parmesan cheese and, onion powder to these potatoes. They were a big hit with my family. Thank you for the idea of these potatoes.

Seems like a small language difference here. In the USA you say broiler, but in Australia and New Zealand we call it a griller ie the bit at the top of the oven. BBQ's have a solid plate called a hot plate and/or maybe a grill as well, and we do not differentiate -  it's a bbq, we do not call it a grill, and the cook decides how the food will be cooked(depends on how many beers have been consumed before and during the cooking). Have fun with this, I need another beer!

took these to a bbq with friends, and they were a big hit.  I followed the recipe (scaled up to feed a large group), except i subbed about 1/3 of the lite mayo with sour cream, and i added some smoked paprika.  i also sprinkled fresh parmesan cheese at the end of cooking, and i think the cheese really made the flavour come together.  you'll need a lot of salt, which is typical of potato dishes.  overall, a very nice dish and a good change from the usual potato salad or scalloped potatoes you usually see at a bbq.

Wow!  The recipe doesn't look all that impressive, but these are the most flavorful potatoes I've ever made on the grill.  Only a couple of them stuck to the foil, so next time I'll definitely use some PAM spray.  I also used three huge cloves of garlic--some of the zing mellows from the grill.  Thanks for an incredible recipe.  I'll make these for every BBQ!!

Great starter recipe to adjust to your tastes. 
I microwaved not boiled skin on. 
I used olive oil mayo and added chopped onion to the spicing. 
Used a blender to combine and smooth. Brushed once before placing in broiler and again after 15 min. 
Perfect

Great idea for using potatoes. We usually like our baked/grilled potatoes with sour cream but find that we're often out of it when we need it so we've been looking for something else to use as a substitute and this is it. I microwaved them until almost cooked and then cut each potato in half. Then I spread the mayonnaise mixture on each cut surface and broiled them until the topping was slightly browned. We both love them this way. Thanks for the great idea Xanthe.

Delicious. I toss the potatoes in the bowl with the sauce before baking them rather than just pouring it on the top, turned great!

I’m so surprised at how many people thought this was to be cooked on the barbecue. It clearly says in the directions to preheat your oven broiler. But hey, if it works on the barbecue too, that’s awesome. I just know how delicious these are when broiled to a golden brown. I followed the directions exactly the first time. The second time I microwaved them rather than boiling. Then added a few tablespoons of parm to the mayo mixture before spreading it on the potatoes. Yummy!

Not our favorite.  Hubby asked me why I didn't make my "normal" potatoes.  After asking why...he says he likes mine much better.  It was ok...but not for us. Thanks anyway for the post.

These were so not the best potatoes I've ever tasted.  I'll definately go back to olive oil and luck of the draw seasonings.

I love potatoes!  & this was a hit.  Did cube the potatoes rather than quarter.  Also added parmesan on top.  Cooked on a tray in the oven.  Will try it in summer on the bbq though.  Would be great!  Very tasty. Thanks

Pouring the mayo mix over the potatoes is. Unsatisfactory method as not all surfaces of potatoes are reached. I prefer putting the potatoes in a bowl, pouring the mayo mix on top, then with clean hands, gently roll pots and mix together both until pots are completely covered! I do this quite often with a very similar recipe.

I wish that this recipe wasn't called the best potatoes you'll ever taste because they aren't even close.  The mayo spread left a funny, greasy feeling in my mouth.   I'm sorry but we just didn't enjoy these.

If I make this again... my taste buds need to kick it up some. I'll add some pepper flakes and sour cream to the mayo mixture. And add a honey mustard dipping sauce to compliment.

Easy to throw together, modified with everyone's recommendations of adding grated parmesan cheese and parsley for a little color is perfect.  Great flavor! I made it twice in one week because my family wanted more.  Thank you for this recipe!

My guys loved these potatoes.  But......make sure you read the reviews.  The submitter, XANTHE clarified that changes were made to his original recipe and these are to made under the broiler, not on the grill.  I made as he/she suggested and they were delicious.  My one change was to partially microwave the potatoes rather than boil them.  I will make them again using the same method.  Served them with 'Greek Yogurt Coleslaw', 'Flank Steak a la Willyboy' and 'Sloppied Flank Steak Sandwiches' all AR recipes.

These were different.  My hubby and I thought they were good but our 10 & 12 year olds found the smell of the garlic too strong.  I probably won't make them again.

Great!  I actually made it on the stove, doing the second part in a frying pan with some olive oil.  It came out great, and everyone (including me) loved it.  I will definitely make it again.

I love this recipe.  It was easy to prepare and tasted great!  Like the previous review, I used parmesan cheese and used pam on the foil instead of butter.  This worked great and didn't give me any trouble.  I will most definately cook this recipe again!

I followed the recipe and it was ok. Not what I expected but not bad. I did use small Yukon potatoes and that might have been the difference.

This was a great change to every day potatoes. I didn't change any of the ingredients, just the method.
I put the sauce mixture in a large bowl and tossed the par-baked potatoes in it and arranged them on the baking dish. Saving me to have to pour it over and miss any spots. Delish!!

The potatoes were very yummy. We would try it again but use sour cream instead of mayonnaise. I rated it with three stars only because they do not taste as good as leftovers.

these were pretty much the best potatoes i've ever had (that i've made).
my favourite thing about them is that they didn't break up after boiling.
great recipe!

These were ok. I don't think I'll try them again.  I'm a fan of olive oil, garlic and spices.  I think part of my disappointment was that my expectations were a bit too high, given the title of the recipe :)

I'm so sorry to give a bad review. I feel bad. I didn't read any of the reviews before making this. I found that after I got my potatoes  done and ready to coat with the sauce, there wasn't enough to cover them all. So I ended up tripling the sauce. I also added 1T of fresh grated parmesan cheese each time I made this. I thought the oregano to be way over powering in this. We love our potatoes and was so excited to try this, but none of us 4 adults liked them. Maybe it was my fault tripling the sauce but they weren't dripping in it, I just covered them nicely. If the sauce is good it shouldn't matter how much you use. Some people really liked this but everyones taste is different. Sorry, this wasn't to our taste. Thanks anyways Xanthe.

These are pretty good, I'm not a big potato eater. My husband liked them for a change and like another suggested I finished them in a skillet sprayed with PAM. Will make again thanks for sharing.

Instead of clinging to the potatoes the sauce burned onto the foil and became really gross looking.  I won't make this again.

I used the mayonnaise mixture in the last few minutes of mix of roasted red potatoes, sweet potatoes, cauliflower and onions. Once it had warmed up on the almost done veggies, broiled on Lo for a few minutes. Excellent addition to my roasted veggies!

Over rated.  Thought potatoes were dry - maybe I parboiled too long.  I started in a 450 oven for 10 min then broiled for a few more.  We ended up smashing them and adding butter

I added a few more potatoes so I cooked the potatoes in the salt water about 15 minutes.  I didn’t have any fresh garlic so I used garlic salt in place of salt in recipe.  They turned out really well.  Everyone in the family loved them.  I’ll be keeping this recipe.

I added Parmesan cheese and they turned out perfectly! I would probably pick a different herb next time instead of oregano, or I could use powdered ranch dressing mix.

This was a great change to every day potatoes. I didn't change any of the ingredients, just the method.
I put the sauce mixture in a large bowl and tossed the par-baked potatoes in it and arranged them on the baking dish. Saving me to have to pour it over and miss any spots. Delish!!

Rather than only painting the mixture onto the top of the potatoes, I made the mayo mixture in a large bowl and added the potatoes to it. Turning them gently with a rubber spatula ensures complete coverage. Don’t use fat-free mayo or Miracle Whip. Use real mayonnaise.

I would change a few things. I would double the sauce.  I would watch more closely the time to boil the potatoes - I left mine a bit too long.  I would slice my potatoes  which would decrease the amount of boiling time but allow the sauce to be spread more evenly.
Otherwise we enjoyed these.

I made changes. Used olive oil and not mayo. Chopped shallots, fresh rosemary and garlic. Added red pepper flakes and cooked in 350 oven after boiling for 5-7 minutes, for about 20 minutes. Turning potatoes as they brown. 
Yummy!!!

I've used mayo as a crunch maker for grilled cheese sandwiches instead of butter on the bread, but was still pleasantly surprised at how good and crispy these turned out while still retaining that soft potato texture inside. I omitted the salt and used black pepper and Mrs. Dash garlic herb seasoning.  I dipped then in no-salt ketchup and they were superb and healthy!

Made no changes however, I did toss the potatoes in the mayo by hand instead of pouring it on top. My exceptionally picky husband liked them a lot. I will make them again.

I microwaved the potatoes instead of boiling.  Even more flavor.  I removed them from the micro one minute early. Let cooled, and easily skinned the potatoes.  Came out great.

I have a regular recipe for potato wedges in the oven, but I usually have to bake them for around 2 hours. 

I made these potatoes from start to finish in about 30 minutes!

I followed the recipe as written and they were pretty darn good! I spooned the mayo mixture on the top of the wedges.

Next time I think I will boil the potatoes for 10 minutes and then put them in a bowl with the mayo mixture to coat them better.

I do love my regular recipe of oven potatoes, but do love the flavor and the time saved with this recipe.

I wasn’t real sure as to cooking the potatoes before cooking in the oven. So I quartered the potatoes and then microwaved them for 16 minutes (I have an 800 watt microwave). I doubled the mixture and gobbed it on . I did added grated Parmesan (1/2 cup). Then I baked it at 375 for 38 minutes. My hubby loved  them.

I stuck to the recipe.  It turned out a little moist rather than a crisp coating, but think if I move the oven rack up 1 more level I’ll end up with the right texture. Very tasty roasted potatoes; husband and I loved it!

The mayonnaise  mixture  was not enough. Also  the flavor was not that great  It would be better to double the mixture for three potatoes  Garlic powder with Goya chicken bullion flavor packs are better. I am going to use them for breakfast potatoes.

I followed the recipe but next time I would use Italian seasoning I think. Didn’t care for just oregano flavour. Otherwise, tasty and simple.

These were really good. Used Yukon Gold & microwaved instead of boiled. In the mixture I used pepper, 21 Seasonings, oregano, and sweet paprika. plus chopped sweet onions & garlic. Sprinkled shredded sharp Cheddar on top. Definitely a favorite.

I thought these were really good. We were pressed for time when cooking these and I decided to slice the potatoes in large chuncks so they would cook faster. Then I placed them on tin foil to cook on the BBQ they cooked great and I liked having the sauce/seasoning on every bite.
