I always, always get rave reviews when I make this dish for company.  My family loves it too, including my picky kids!  Instead of mace, I add 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg and I never use anything but Granny Smith apples.  This one is definately a keeper!

Not quite a five star but more than a four.  I used about a 1/4 t allspice, 1/4 t nutmeg, and 1/2 t cinnamon to replace mace.  Next time, I think I'll cube the squash to get better mixing with the apples.  I don't know why it said to sprinkle the spice mix.  It was like a thick sauce that had to be spread.

The mixture for this squash is wonderful but there is not enough of it. Also it is a bear to clean the dish you cook it in. I would make again without the apples and double the mix and coat the pan. Great flavor in the surgar mix!

So easy to make ! I used Butternut Squash, and basic red apples (whichever red apple that was on sale at the market).  A trick to easily peel a butternut, is to boil it (whole) in radily boiling water  for 4 minutes, remove from water, let cool, and then the  skin peels of easly with a potatoes peeler.  Trick: The blanching softens the peel, and makes for easy peeling.

I also altered this recipe a bit by using nutmeg instead of mace.   I also had some boneless chicken breast,  which I partially cooked first, and laid on top of the squash/apple/spice mix.  My son said DO NOT throw away this recipe.

What an easy treat...the hardest part is being the squash.  I actually goofed and mixed everything together but it still tasted delish!  Also, sprinkled toasted almonds on top to add some crunch.

much too sweet for my family. My children thought they were having dessert for supper so that made them pretty happy! I like the combo of apples and squash, but I'll cut the sugar in 1/2 next time.

I have been making this recipe for more years than I care to admit! It is in my Betty Crocker Cookbook I have had since 1976. I always make this for the holiday's dinners. Some of my family think sweet potato's must be covered in marshmellow (yuck!) I use less sugar, depending on the tartness of the apples. No mace, just cinnamon. I have also used curry powder, most yummy and nice mid year change from the cinnamon. 
Also, I don't melt the butter, I just put pieces of butter on top. Best of all this can be put together the day before, store in fridge and simply let come to room temp before placing in the oven. Even the kids will eat it with the apples. 
Enjoy-

Delicious!  The apples add nice flavor; I used cinnamon, fresh nutmeg and allspice.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful! I made it for Canadian Thanksgiving and everyone was extremely impressed...most everyone present asked for the recipe and there were no leftovers. A truly wonderful alternative to candied yams and much more interesting.

This was very tasty!  And apart from making the initial cuts in the squash -- where's my broadsword when I need it?! -- very fast and easy.  I substituted a pear for one of the apples, because that's what I had, and that variety was pleasant.  Also substituted nutmeg for the mace, as others have recommended ... but next time I think I'll make sure I have mace in the pantry.  The nutmeg was fine but I think the mace might have been even better.  In the future, I'll probably cut back on, or even eliminate the sugar -- there's so much sweetness in the squash and fruit -- or else possibly add in something tart, like cranberries, or savory, like chunks of Gruyere or bacon or salt ham, to create some additional complexity.  I might also increase the amount of flour just a tad -- the mouth-feel of the liquid seemed just a little thin.  But overall, this is an easy, delicious, and tremendously nutritious (it's got tons of vitamin A and C) autumn comfort food.

Excellent.  I doubled the recipe and added pecans.  I liked it, my sister-in-law wants the recipe and my sister who hates squash even said it was passable...

This was so delicious!  I added some raisins and slivered almonds, but I didn't need to - it would have been just as great without the additions.  I, too, used pumpkin pie spice.  Don't forget to bake it covered.  I forgot, and the burnt tips were not tasty.

I have prepared my squash similarly for years.  Instead of slicing the squash, I simply wash it, cut an opening in the top, remove seeds, add apple slices and other ingredients and bake it that way.  The apples soften and it's delicious!

Brought this to our Thanksgiving potluck and it went quickly. Substituted mace with 1 tsp vanilla, cinnamon, and dash of nutmeg, and used granny smith apples.

This is a fall staple for me. Instead of mace, I use 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon, and a dash of nutmeg. When preparing the squash, boil it whole for about 5 minutes first. Dunk in cold water, and then you can peel it with a spoon! Well, a vegetable peeler on some parts, a spoon in the valleys.

I liked it a lot, it's buttery AND sweet. My husband, not a fan of vegetables, actually has started looking for other recipes for this squash despite the difficulty he had peeling and cutting the squash! He wants me to buy another and said he will handle the peeling and chopping!! Thanks for sharing. I suspect we will feature this for many Thanksgivings to come!

Love butternut squash (so nutritious!); hate the mess of prep -- so....when Costco has the packs of butternut squash already cubed and ready to go -- then I'm on the hunt for some great recipes.  This one qualifies -- thank you!  We loved it!

This was great!  Believe it or not, it was even better the next day COLD! (It tastes surprisingly close to pumpkin pie when cold.)  I spent considerable time peeling the squash and apples, but other than that it was simple. Like others suggested, not having mace, I used a bit of nutmeg and added some cinnamon and vanilla as well. I'll be making this for Thanksgiving and I'm sure I'll get rave reviews.

I've been making this recipe since the early 80's when I cut the recipe out of the local newspaper.  It is one of my favorite ways to prepare squash.  I think the mace gives it a special flavor.

My boyfriend didn't like this, so I ate it all. I didn't have mace , so I used cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. I mixed everthing together and cooked in microwave. I added some water as it cooked because it was really thick. It was really good.

This recipe was fantastic!  I had bought a thing of cubed butternut squash and was looking for a recipe to use it with.  This was perfect.  I cubed all the apples and the squash was pre-cubed so it took a little longer to cook (1 hour 10 minutes).  Also didn't have mace so substituted 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  We all loved it, even my 3 year old!

So very "fall" tasting.  Didn't pack the brown sugar just to lighten up on  the sweet and it was just right.  Used 1/4t allspice in place of the mace we didn't have on hand.  Very well received.

I lightened this a little by using some Brummel and Brown spread instead of butter and did not pack the brown sugar.  I used cinnamon and a little nutmeg instead of mace.  It was wonderful!

This was delicious!  It was plenty sweet as written.  We pealed and cubed the squash and layered that and the apples in the casserole and then poured the sugar mixture over the top.

Super delicious!  I sprayed my pan before putting in the squash and apples and clan up was a breeze.  I only used 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. salt.  I had no mace so used 1/8 tsp nutmeg and 3/8 tsp all spice instead.  I served it with 12 boneless skinless chicken tenders I had sauteed on the stove top with 1 clove of garlic.  Made a fantastic meal.  Everyone went back for seconds and my high schooler packed herself the leftovers for lunch!

I made this recipe for my grandchildren, who love vegetables, and they ate it up quickly.
I used cinnamon, and nutmeg. I poured apple juice that I sweetened with Splenda, and thickened with cornstarch over the whole casserole and baked it for the recommended time.
What a delicious recipe that tastes like dessert!

It was too much work for what you got from the taste.  The cutting and peeling of the squash along with the 55 minutes required cooking time made this dish impractical for me.  It only tasted decently.  Thanks though.

Followed recipe as described, no alterations. Overall OK. Found it to be a little sweet for our tastes. Would make again, adjusting to reduce sweetness.

I was so impressed by this recipe! I have spun off and made my own Fall Bounty Bakes. I've added Granny Smith apples, butternut squash, yams, golden raisins, dried cranberries, pecans. For the topping, I've added different spices like cardamom, ginger, and allspice. Half side dish, half dessert with a little brown sugar. Tastes like Fall!

I baked this in a cast iron roast pan covered with the lid.  The squash turned out soft and perfectly seasoned. The mixture is thick but it melted perfectly over the squash and apples. I used Macs. Def will make again!

Way too sweet for my taste and the butter and brown sugar seemed to mask the butternut flavor.  I think this recipe has potential and I will try again, and cut the sugar in half.

Delicioso.  I had to look up how to peel and dice a butternut squash. Glad I did. Peeling  was difficult. Have to upgrade my utensils.  Loved this dish.

I am new to all the winter squashes except for acorn squash, so I was looking for a recipe for my butternut squash that I picked up last week.  I'm so glad I found this one. I followed the recipe very closely, except I used splenda brown, 1/4 cup instead of the brown sugar. I have to say, this was delicious!  I also used cinnamon instead of mace, because I sniffed the mace before I started and didn't really care for the aroma.  I'm glad I went with the cinnamon.  It was so warm and comforting! The apples go so well with the squash and they compliment each other.  I love the way the flour thickens the pan juices and the end result is reminiscent of apple pie filling - YUM! My husband and I are both diabetic, and this dish was like a "forbidden" dessert to us, but still sugar-free! I removed the cover and baked the dish another 15 minutes at the end, just to thicken those delicious juices a little more.  I had used 2 more apples than the recipe called for, and that made a little extra liquid. Used 4 different varieties of apples, and they all worked great. I also boiled the squash before peeling, which made it quite easy to peel -  ( 5 min. rolling boil). Thank you, Paula for sharing this easy and delightful recipe.  I will enjoy this for years to come.

Nice autumn dish.  Hint: Poke a couple of holes in squash and microwave for 3-5 minutes for easier peeling.  Second time I made it I used prechopped squash from the produce department--makes it a lot easier.  This time I felt it could have used a little more spice such as cloves or cinnamon.

Very easy!  I did not mix the ingreds together; sprinkled over layered squash and apples.  I think some crunchiness on top would be good, perhaps, chopped nuts.

My toddlers loved it because it was so very sweet it resembled a dessert more than part of a meal. I won't be making this dish again, however, I like the idea of cooking with apples in a more savory dish. It has inspired me to experiment more, minus the sugar!

We do an annual event with about 20 friends around Thanksgiving time which we call our 'Harvest Celebration'. This recipe was an absolute crowd pleaser. I used firm honey crisp apples, also eliminated the mace and used cinnamon instead and a dash of freshly grated nutmeg. I did follow the suggestion someone made to lightly butter the pan first but don't know that I really needed to. I am a firm believer - don't mess with success.

Very easy to make.  I doubled the glaze because I could tell it wasn't going to be enough as indicated.  I also sliced the apples and squash into quarters.  A nice, tasy dish which would make for a great side to any meal.

This was easy to make, and tasted great! One caution: I layered the squash and apples twice - the ones on top were a little less cooked. No complaints from the 'tweens on this one!

Oh yeah!  This is marvelous.  A great substitution for sweet potatoes...or in addition to, because what is Thanksgiving without the sweet potatoes?!
Delicious with roast pork, or even just pork chops.
