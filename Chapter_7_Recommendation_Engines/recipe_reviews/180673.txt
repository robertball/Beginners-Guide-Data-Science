Overall Just OK. I used white pepper and a little drizzle of sesame oil to bring it into place. This time around I omitted the butter too.

I added another onion, and I'm thinking about adding mushrooms next time. We have had it twice now, and it really hits the spot. I don't care if it is soup weather or not, we are definitely having this throughout the summer.
