I made a few changes to this one.  I actually won a Chili cookoff with this.  Instead of the Green Sauce, I added Diced Green Chili's.  It was a hit! The flavor was wonderful!!

This is a very delicious chili.  I loved that it contained chicken for a nice twist and the 2 types of beans added nice color with the corn & peppers.  Very colorful.  I happen to enjoy a very spicy chili so I added about 1/2 tbl.  more chili powder, 1/2 tbl more cayenne pepper, 2 diced jalapenos & 1 tsp more cumin powder.  I also found the chili to be a little too runny because of all the water.  I simmered for an extra 20 minutes and it was still "soupier" then I prefer.  Next time, I would add 3 cups during the first step adding water in the recipe but I would only add 1 cup in the second step adding water in the recipe.  I served it by topping with sliced jalapenos, sour cream, shredded mexican cheese & chopped cilantro.  Will make again...

very good, made this on a couple occasions. i omitted the corn and replaced it with a can of diced tomatoes, and i would also suggest omitting a cup or two of the water.

Great Recipe! Family likes it. Reduce to 4 cups of water(I used chicken both ) for a thicker chili. And I used chicken thighs in place of chicken breast.

Great! Always looking for ways to add beans and fiber to meals. Could not find green Tobasco locally, so added a small can of green chiles to the mix. Will make this one, again.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. The aroma of all the spices just woke the sences. The cilantro was a refreshing addition to the recipe. I let the water in the first part of the recipe simmer a liitle more than it asked and then add the second part and the chili was thick enough, A well rounded Chili. Will make again!!!:)

I also added a can of diced tomatoes (as suggested by another reviewer), but still added the corn (omitted by that reviewer), and reduced the water by 2 cups (we like a thick chili).  Very excellent.

I really loved this.  I've gotten lucky recently finding chili recipes that are different from the usual.  (Not that the usual is bad.)  I thought the chicken made a big difference and I like a variety of beans.  Except, I admit to not even knowing what chipotle is and used ground cayenne instead, so I don't know if this made a big difference -- I just liked the chicken and the spiciness. :-)

This was delicious-I love the cilantro topping. I've made it twice in three weeks.  I made small !modifications to the base recipe by omitting corn, and adding a large can of diced tomatoes.  I also add a diced jalapeno to give it a little extra kick!  Enjoy

THIS IS VERY QUICK AND EXTREMELY TASTY. I HAVE ADDED A CAN OF PINTO BEANS TO THE MIX. WHEN SERVING I ADD A TSP OF SOUR CREAM AND FRESH CELANTRO ON TOP.  THIS TIME INSTEAD OF REGULAR CORN KERNALS I USED A CAN OF MINI CORNS.  I THEN RAN THEM THROUGH MY VIDALIA CHOPPER.  IT WAS SO YUMMY.  I USE LESS WATER THAN CALLED FOR AS I LIKE MY CHILI SAUCE A BIT THICKER.

Delicious...like most people, I modified based on what I had and what sounded good. Used 1 c water and 2 c chicken stock as per many reviews, also cut back on tomato paste and added diced canned tomatoes as many have done. Subbed a fresh chipotle chili and dried cilantro. White pepper for cayenne. On impulse based on other chili recipes, added mustard, cocoa powder, and peanut butter. It was SO good. Served w/ tortilla chips, sharp cheddar, and sour cream.

This was yummy!  I did add a little garlic to the recipe (BAMM) and garnished with a little sour cream rather than cilantro.  Served this for lunch with my sister and it was a HIT.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made this chili a few times. We have enjoyed it every time. I make only one change, I like my chili thicker so I put in 3 at the beginning and 1 at the end with about 2 tsp of flour mixed in it to thicken it up. It comes out great. Sometimes I add a can of diced tomatoes as well.

It is very delicious. I left a star off just because it was too spicy for my 2 year old, but I should have known from the ingredients that it would be. It seemed a bit watery so I left out the additional 2 cups of water, so that probably made it spicier. Very tasty though!

This recipe was not quite right for me.  It was a good jumping off point, but as soon as I added the 3 cups of chicken stock in place of the water (I never did ad the other two!), it never got back on track from there.  I had to doctor it up with more than double the spices and extra beans.  I think good chili doesn't really need a recipe, it's best made to taste.

Made some changes to make it a veggie recipe, and it has been a huge hit among friends. It's a pretty flexible recipe, so anything chili related fits in.   I eliminate the chicken, and instead add cooked brown rice in before the final simmer, about 1.5 - 2 cups.  I don't use the corn, but instead add a second can of kidney beans.  I rinse two cans of beans, add the liquid of the third can only.  Use jalapenos instead of the sauce stuff, and fresh garlic (about 2 or 3 cloves) and tomato paste instead of what's listed.    Makes a great amount of leftovers for two people, which means lunch is ready for the week! I top it with a small sprinkle of cheddar cheese, served in a multigrain bread bowl.  DELICIOUS!

I had recently tried the Hormel Chipotle Chicken Chili for lunch. I decided to search for a recipe that I could make myself and found this one. It is absolutely wonderful!! I did make a couple of changes. I used ground chipotle pepper instead of grinding a pepper (1/4 tsp) and used green chilis instead of green sauce (1 small can) I didn't brown the chicken, instead I threw it all in the slow cooker adding about 1 cup of water and cooked it on low for 4-5 hours. I made this for our annual chili cook off at work, and won!!! As we say in our home, this is a repeater!

Delicious!  I made a few adjustments according to other people's reviews.  I omitted the corn, added a can of diced tomatoes with green chile peppers.  I used 3 cups of chicken broth total, instead of water.  I like the chili chunky! I also added fresh garlic and a few tablespoons of salt. No chipotle pepper, just two tbsp of chili pepper instead. I only used one can of black beans, no kidney beans. Topped with sour cream and cheese and served with tortilla chips ... Yum yum!

I've made it twice to rave reviews. I omitted the green pepper sauce (didn't have any) and last time I left out the cayenne since my husband has a hard time with spicy stuff.  Delicious!

Was delicious but if you don't like something spicy you may want to put less cayenne and less black pepper.

I made this from leftover bbq chicken legs, and it was beyond DELICIOUS!  I used less water since I was using cooked meat.  It still was a little soupy fo some, so I'd add water as you go along.  But it thickens up the 2nd day, and is even better!  Sooooo good.  Like a liquidy pulled chicken taco. AWESOME.

Great basic recipe. This  is easy to throw in substitutes. I only added 3 cups of water and a splash of chicken broth after the first simmer. I used 1 green pepper and added 3 garlic cloves and omitted the corn. It tasted great!

This recipe gets 5+ stars from me because it is very forgiving and my family loved it! Even the left-overs were a rave! I did not have bell peppers so I omitted those. I did not have kidney beans so I used canned great northern. I did not have roasted garlic tomato paste so I used regular and I did not use green pepper sauce. Next time I might make it exact to the recipe but then again I might not depends on what I am out of at the time, but I can assure you it will still turn out great. Thank-you KORREN for an awesome recipe!

This is one of the tastiest versions of chili I have ever made...however, I did make these changes for a very quick version...used a 12.5oz can of chicken breast (drained), 2-14oz. cans of chicken broth instead of the water and 1-14.5oz can of mexican-style chopped tomatoes. I didn't have a chipolte pepper on hand so I deleted that, and the recipe was plenty spicy without it. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, serving it with a dollop of sour cream & fresh cilantro. Very yummy!

I think another can of tomatoes is needed.  It was a little dry.

This was just ok.  I had high expectations, as all the ingredients are things I really like, but this recipe just didn't live up to my expectations.  It didn't really taste like chili.  It wasn't bad, but I don't think I will make it again.

I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs in place of breasts, added 1 small can of green chiles, and added a 15 oz can of crushed tomatoes. Put it together the night before and then cooked in a slow cooker the next day while at work. Yummy!

I only had 2 chicken breasts on hand when I made this recipe so I decided to bring bacon to the party which may have worsened the healthy aspect but didn't hurt the flavor.  I am a spice fiend so I added sliced habanero peppers as well.  This was a very easy and delicious recipe and I will surely repeat it.

My family liked this, and it was a nice change from beef chili.  I did make some changes as others did.  I personally boiled the chicken earlier to save time and used the broth from the chicken  instead of water in the receipe.  I also cut back on the amount of water used, it made it thicker and seem more like chili and not a soup.  I just added my spices in when adding the chicken.   We also like things alittle spicer and added what we need to spice it up.  Overall very quick and everyone ate it.   I did not have the garlic roasted tomato paste, just used regular tomato paste.

Delicious!  Husband raved about it too.  It has a nice kick, but not too much.  Only gave 4 stars since I felt 5 cups of water would have made this soup rather than chili.  I listened to the other reviewers and cut back on the water by 2 cups.  Also, didn't find or use the chipotle but felt it was delicious without it.  Will DEFINITELY make again and have shared this recipe with other family members.

I didn't use the corn but cut up a can of stewed tomatoes - it really enhanced the flavor.  Also used 2 cans of black beans and no red - we love blackbeans! I used the maximum on all the spices and used others suggestions to use only 1 cup of water on the 2nd addition. Very good chili.

Awesome recipe. Everyone loved it! I didn't use chipotle and doubled the chili powder. I also cut the water down to 3 cups and used an extra can of beans and skipped the corn. This one's definitely a keeper!

- Add a couple cloves of garlic
-corn is ok to skip
- When you put in your first 3 cups of water add a healthy amount of cilantro too.
- Very good!

Spicy and wonderful! Used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of the water, and 1 tsp chipotle chili powder instead of crushing a dry one. Cooked it a bit longer than 30 minutes. Very tasty, and healthy. Thank you for the recipe!

Worthy of 5 stars following advice from other members' suggestions - especially less water! I used about 3 cups which was plenty - otherwise would have  been soup, not chili! Also added a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and more cumin than what was called for (other suggested changes). I chopped up a canned chipotle pepper instead of grinding a dried one because I had it on hand - great flavor.  My hint/help: Pound the chicken breasts between sheets of plastic wrap or wax paper to tenderize them before browning if not using ground chicken.

Way, WAY too spicy with the chili powder, chili pepper, cayenne & pepper sauce.  I really had to doctor it to make it palatable for my family - and we are no strangers to heat!  I ended up adding milk, peanut butter, chocolate, sugar, lime juice and a can of whole tomatoes just to be able to eat it!  Good flavor, but if I ever make it again I would definitely leave out most if not all of the chipotle and cayenne.

Good start; I personally was a little liberal with my spices, but that's just how I enjoy it. The major issue is is that the end result was just too watery. Even going off of some other reviews, I only added 3 + 1 cups of water. I drained the corn, but left the beans undrained, pouring that liquid into the chili at the end. So I ended up with more of a soup than a chili.

Spice island has ground chipotle chili so I used that instead of grinding my own.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written and my family all wanted seconds.  Only the kids had the sour cream to cut the spice.  this is absolutely fabulous!

Fabulous. I only had green pepper, onion and garlic. Did not use chipotle only cayenne and chili powder. I did add an additional can of stewed tomatoes and more beans as I like pretty hearty. It was really yummy!Use plenty of fresh cilantro.Great recipe!

This recipe was very, very tasty and my husband said it was a definite repeat.

One suggestion, though: right after you brown the chunks of chicken, remove them with a slotted spoon into a medium/large bowl and shred them. Then return them to the pot and continue as normal.

I strongly endorse this for a hearty mid-winter meal.

This turned out really well. Everyone was impressed. I used 2 cups of broth and 1 cup of water (we like our chili thick) instead of the 5 cups of water. Switched to 1 big green bell pepper ( we didn't have a red or yellow one on hand) and also used a regular can of Rotel for the diced tomatoes. This is a great base recipe for changing around, based on what you have on hand.

I am rating this based what I found in the basic recipe, though I deviated based on my soup preferences and others' reviews.  I sautéed the red and yellow peppers with the onion and added celery,  then the spices and cooked chicken thigh meat,  reduced the water to 3 cups and added stewed tomatoes.  I mistakenly opened  spicy black beans so I used them with baby butter beans and the corn.  I also liked other's idea to add a dash of cocoa powder and garlic powder.  I have to say that the seasonings in the spicy black beans seemed to shine past the other seasonings, and while it was still great soup, I would have loved to taste the original seasonings more. I think the dark meat in this was wonderful.   I  really like this recipe and will make it again...you can learn from me on the spicy bean oops.

I made some changes:

1. No green chile sauce or cilantro since my kids wouldn't eat those
2. Substituted petite diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce
3. Used chicken broth instead of water
4. Omitted the chipotle chili powder since I didn't have 
any
5. Substituted kidney beans for pinto cause it's what I had
I thought that with these changes it was delicious but a tad salty.  Next time if I use chicken broth I won't add any other salt.

I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times now and it's just perfect.  Can't find the dried chipotles around here so I usually add some crushed red pepper flakes.  Very good though.  Great chili flavor and the fact that there's very little that's bad for you in here means you can feel good about yourself.

This was delicious!  Like many who’ve reviewed this recipe, I cut back the water to 3 cups rather than 5, but used chicken broth in place of the water.  Added just a little more to the flavor.  I could not find dried chipotle peppers, so I used the canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce.  Those can be found in the ethnic foods area of most grocery stores.  The last thing that I did that was not on the original recipe is add a 15 oz can of tomato sauce at the end were you’d add the remaining water if you were to use it.  I’ve been telling friends and family about this recipe, including one friend who has wheat allergies.  Totally making this again.

Good recipe! Thanks for sharing. I didn't have green pepper so just did a whole onion. I used Penzey's Adobo spices instead of the cumin/pepper etc. We topped with grated cheese and lite sour cream. Very easy and my husband went back for a big bowl of seconds.

This is a great chicken chili!  It is very tasty and hearty.  My boyfriend said it was the best.  I didn’t use the chipotle pepper, corn, or green pepper sauce, because I did not have.  I substituted a can of diced tomatoes for the paste.  I followed previous reviews and only used 3 cups of water and added chicken bouillon with the water.  I also added a chopped jalapeno.  Will definitely make again!

The flavor of this dish was amazing.  I withheld the five star rating (although its a 4.99999) because the consistency wasn't what I was hoping for in a chili.  I will definitely make this again and adjust the water content to find the thickness that I prefer.  Very Good!!!

This recipe is, hands down, the best chili I have *ever* tasted. I pared down the water to a total of 3 cups instead of 5, and couldn't find a chili pepper, so just upped the powder. I intended to submit a photo but we ate the entire batch so quickly that it'll have to wait until the next time we make it! Thanks for sharing!

This truly was a yummy chili, I just think, as others have noted before me, that the recipe needs to be changed because 5 cups is just too much water for a chili consistency. I simmered for an hour and still couldn't get it to look like chili! It still makes a delicious soup!
