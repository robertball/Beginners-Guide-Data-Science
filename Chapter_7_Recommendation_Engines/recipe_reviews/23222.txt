I would like to thank Liz. My family has been using this recipe for years. 
We would have to phone my Aunt every year to get it, unfortunately she 
passed away a few years ago and no one could remember the ingriedients. 
So thank you Liz for we shall enjoy the white sauce again a very long tradition
in our family. Merry Christmas Kim

Yum, this was perfect!  It made my cinnamon raisin bread pudding taste like cinnamon rolls.  I used cornstarch in place of flour, it turned out great!

The recipe was easy to make.  I was hesitant at first but by the time I started stirring and tasting, even Gordon Ramsey would have complemented me.  Outstanding over my Rum Cake.
