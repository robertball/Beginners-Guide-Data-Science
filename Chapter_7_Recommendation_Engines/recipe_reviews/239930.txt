I actually worked at a taco joint in the mid 70's and I remember our taco meat recipe. Broken down for 1 pound of ground beef, add: 1 Tbsp onion powder, 1Tbsp garlic powder, 1Tbsp cumin, 1Tbsp sugar ( yes, Sugar!), and 1tsp salt.  These days, I like to chop a Vidalea onion and about 1 cup of chopped red, yellow and orange sweet bell peppers. Saute'  the onions & peppers, then add the ground beef and brown it with the onions & peppers, then add the spices when the meat is about halfway browned so the flavors have time to intermingle.  DON'T add tomato sauce, paste or any of that!  You add salsa when you assemble your tacos, burritos, tostadas or whatever after putting on your lettuce, guacamole, tomatoes & whatever you like on your Mexican food.   Enjoy, Amigos!

This is a great change of pace for an easy taco meat. The celery salt is perfect in this recipe. Thank you Natalie.

I used this recipe to make beef and bean burritos. I cooked an onion with the ground beef rather than using onion powder and added a can of refried beans with green chiles at the end. I didn't have celery salt so I doubled the garlic salt and it turned out great. Thanks!

This was way under seasoned. I made it a second time with the same spices but quadrupled+ everything but the celery salt. Much better! Basically a heaping tablespoon of all the spices, and a nice salsa  in place of the tomato sauce gets it.

Super easy to make and super delicious. It's well rounded and I would say it's equivalent to Taco bell & Del Taco's Taco meat taste. I did however add fresh garlic to the recipe and little bit more tomato sauce.

Thanks for the recipe!!!  I used ground turkey and substituted tomato paste for tomato sauce, (that's what I had in the pantry), and made a taco salad.  Best taco meat seasoning used to date.

I love this recipe!! I did make a few changes though, I did not want to use the sauce it calls for , so I used taco sauce instead and I also didn't add the celery salt and it still tastes fantastic!

This was bland and needed a lot of seasoning. I will not add the tomato sauce next time.

Tasted pretty bland when made as the recipe states, but was perfect after adding about 1/4 to 1/3 of a taco seasoning packet.

It's a good base, but I had to triple all the spices just to get flavor. Then I added some taco sauce rather than tomato sauce.  Like I said, good base, just doesn't have enough flavor as written.

Big Hit!!  Used at my daughter's birthday party.  Made 10 pounds of taco meat, increased all of the seasonings and it was the first thing to disappear.  Like the fact that it's simple and easy because the kitchen doesn't come easy for this hombre!!

The flavor was good but I had to add more seasoning.  I just started tossing more of all the spices in.  I also used ground turkey not ground beef.

This is super easy especially if you don't have a packet. Personally I used powders instead of salts and added my homemade canned salsa instead of tomato paste loved it

I use everything except the Onion Powder because I use chopped onions to cook the ground beef giving you that onion flavor already inside

Just made this tonight because I didn't want to default to a standard pack of taco seasoning and OMG it was truly delicious. I threw in some chili powder as well, which may have been negligible overall, but very happy with the original recipe. Thanks for posting this. Quick, easy, and very tasty.
