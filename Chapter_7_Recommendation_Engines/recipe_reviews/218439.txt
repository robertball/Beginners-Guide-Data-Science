I cut this recipe in half. I did not use the full amount of red pepper, maybe just over a quarter teaspoon because I was feeding two kids. I also used drained "trim" cottage cheese in place of the ricotta only because a) it's cheaper and b) we like it better. Instead of parmesan on top, I melted deli mozzerella cheese over the top. I made a homemade marinara to go with. Since I'm eating lower-carb, I didn't eat mine on a bun, I just spooned a tablespoon or so of marinara on my patty and covered it with spinach leaves. We liked this pretty well, though doing the cheese in the middle of the burger was a pain and really seemed to serve no purpose. Maybe if it was to be mixed in to the actual burger?. I'll make this again, but I'll add more spices and maybe work out the filling of the burger a little better. Very clever dinner idea. I think this would work as a "sloppy joe", if you were to just brown the meat, add the spices and marinara and served them on broiled garlic butter buns, that would be good, too. NOTE: I did not grill my burgers, it's too cold. This worked just fine cooking it on my broiler pan.

I really wanted to love these. I was so looking forward to the taste of lasagna in the heat of August. There is nothing wrong with this recipe. The patties were quite flavorful. We just thought the taste was really no different than any other pizza burger recipe we have had. The ricotta seemed to become almost tasteless and did not give the lasagna flavor that I was expecting.

Interesting concept but I didn't like the ricotta cheese. I think mozzarella cheese would be better.

I love this recipe, it is defiantly one of my husband's favorites! I usually saute the spinach with a little garlic and olive oil. So tasty!
