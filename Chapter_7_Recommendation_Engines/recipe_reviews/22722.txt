Superb.  Like others, I always sprinkle brown sugar on top.  One thing I'd note to anyone making a banana bread for the first time:  Trust your instincts!  Bananas vary, so if yours aren't very sweet, add more sugar.  If yours are especially moist, add a bit of extra flour (the finished dough should be like a thick muffin batter).  This recipe is forgiving enough to work even without these alterations, but a sense of adventure really helps take it up a notch.

For probably 40 years I have made a banana bread with a recipe I got from a wonderful home ec teacher which included sour cream. Since I didn't have sour cream, I made this recipe. This is good, but more cake-like...not nearly as rich or dense as my old favorite banana bread which I will continue to make. The sour cream must be what makes the difference!

Absolutely delicious! It was my first banana nut bread, and it was easy and turned out perfect. I used three bananas and about 1 1/2 cups walnuts, and I had to bake it a little longer, about 1hour and 20 minutes.
I will definitely make this again! Big plus: no need for fancy ingredients, I could make it with what I had at home.

Excellent flavor and easy to make.  I added 1/3 cup of sour cream for added moisture and then topped the bread with vanilla frosting.  Yum Yum!

I would suggest only three bananas other wise this is excellant, to many bananas makes it hard to get done, and falls apart very easily, but flavor was excellant.

I previously reviewed this recipe and gave it 4 1/2 stars, very yummy. My whole family loves this bread. I just made it again for the first time since we moved to CO. I was worried about the altitude, so I added about 1/4 c. flour and made no other changes, except to sprinkle about 2 TBSP brown sugar on the top before baking. It turned out wonderful! Only had to bake for 50 mins. My son could not keep his hands off! So good!!!

Very moist and cake-like.  It made my whole house smell delicious!  I will make this recipe again and again.  The brown sugar gave it a tasty crust.  I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 3 large bananas and one whole cup of nuts (I used pecans).

I'm giving this 5 stars; however I really made my own version of this off this recipe.  I reduced it to one egg (I think egg dries cake/breads out).  I added 1/2 tablespoon of cinnamon, 2 tablespoons of Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum, 3 extra tablespoons of the brown sugar (I used Dark brown sugar), and I added HEATH toffee chips.  I also used 4 bananas, not 3 like others suggested.  I put the batter in a muffin metal pan (6 LARGE muffins).  In a large bowl I mixed brown sugar, cinnamon,  flour, health chips, and melted butter  and sprinkled it on top of the unbaked muffins.  I cooked it at 350 for 33 minutes.  I just had one this morning and it knocked my socks off!  ENJOY!

I don't understand how this recipe had such high reviews! All I can imagine is that the past reviewers have never had good banana bread. My whole family tasted it and we all agree-yes it was very moist but it had a terrible bitter aftertaste. I followed everything to the letter and that must have been the problem. I have to attribute that taste to the 3 tsp. of baking powder. I had thought it seemed like a lot but went with it. Upon looking at some other recipes, I see that yes this is a lot.

This is a delicious banana nut bread.  Doesn't last long around my house.  As a variation I pour one half of the batter into loaf pan, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, pour remaining batter over the cinnamon sugar and top with remaining sugar mixture.

I thought I already had a good recipe for banana bread but the brown sugar caught my eye so I thought I'd give this one a try....well let me tell you, I am tossing the old one away and keeping this one!!! I too added a tsp. of cinnamon to the batter and sprinkled the top with a little extra brown sugar. The best banana bread ever!!!!!!

Very good! One of the best banana breads I've made. I made in muffin tins because I had to cut the recipe in half because I didn't have enough bananas.

Another reviewer refers to milk being added in but there's no milk mentioned in either the recipe or the ingredients.

Brown Sugar Banana Nut Bread Recipe II calls for 1/2 a cup less flour but adds in 1/2 a cup of milk. Next time I'm following that, and maybe using 2 teaspoons of Baking Powder instead of 3. My loaf rose beautifully high (almost too high) but turned out rather dry.

This is my absolute favorite banana bread recipe!  I top my loaves with a little brown sugar before baking and they turn out great!  I can't ever seem to keep any in the house longer than a day!

This recipe was delicious!! I only used 3 very ripe bananas, instead of 4, used twice the vanilla, twice the walnuts, and added about 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. I split the mixture into two 8 x 3 1/2 inch loaf pans. It may have overflowed if I used only one pan. It was perfect! This is by far the best banana bread I have ever tasted! My fiancé and I loved it, and will be making it again!

Very moist bread!  Like a goof, I forgot to add the nuts and it seemed to be missing something.  Next time I will be sure to tape them to my head so I don't forget them.  I'm sure I'm just recovering from the shock of now having a "teenager"  Happy 13th Arica!!  Thanks for the recipe J.R.!

I made this the other day and it was wonderful.
It was moist and was more like a cake than a dense bread.
My family seemed to like that more.
I did a few changes like adding cinnamon, and i'd lined the pan with sugar and cinnamon, also sprinkled some on top. 
Next time I will add cloves, and nutmeg for a little more flavor.
I will definitely make this again.

Warm, dense, sticky, delicious! Everything you'd want in a banana nut bread. Very easy to make and the house smelled AMAZING. I was actually mad at my husband for burning his grilled cheese afterward- it took away the lingering smell of this delicious bread. Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making this recipe for years and am only getting around to rating it now.  Just the number of times I have made it speaks to how much I and everyone who's ever tried it loves this recipe.  Easy, fast and saved an unspeakable number of overly ripe bananas from a fate in the dumpster.  So from everyone, thank you for putting up this recipe.  I'd recommend it to anyone - it's great.

I had 4 large very ripe bananas that I needed to use up and decided to try this recipe.  It was incredibly moist and a pretty typical banana nut bread.  I followed the recipe and felt that it could have used more walnuts.  I found myself wanting some spice, so I might play around with it by adding a little cinnamon & nutmeg.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not find it to be too sweet & my bananas were extremely ripe.

This was easy and very good, I changed the recipe a little, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup unbleached  flour, added another egg, and two more bananas,  it turned out moist and wonderful.  All three of my baby girls loved it and asked for seconds!!

I followed the recipe exactly and the bread tasted fantastic. I have made a couple of changes since such as replacing the oil with applesauce and adding chopped almonds to the top. This bread rarely lasts through the day it is made.

Not the best. I was looking for a brown sugar banana bread recipe. There are too many bananas, you only need three in any recipe and too much baking powder. Just did not bake up right. No cinnamon? Will stick with what I found on this site that received 5 stars.

I made 24 mini muffins from this recipe (baked for 20 minutes each) and they turned out so wonderfully!  I put a mix of dark brown sugar and cinnamon on the top for a bit of crackle, which was a nice touch.  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp ground mace to the batter.  Soft, sweet and addictive.

Very, very good.  LOTS of banana flavor and the brown sugar and vanilla don't overpower, as I was thinking they might.  A little on the greasy side with all that butter, which is the only negative from my point of view.

THE best banana bread I've ever made or tried! It was rich and sweet and flavorful!  I sprinkled a layer of brown sugar across the top during the last 15 minutes of baking to give it a crunchy-sweet crust.  We were also out of nuts, but it was just as good without.

I just made this last night.  First, I have a 3.5 month old so I need something fast so he can just hang and watch me and not get bored.   This bread is soooo good.  I believe it's the brown sugar. With other recipes, I've had issues with a spongy texture, not here. It is very muffin-like, but moist and sweet, but not overly.  I sprinkled some plain ole brown sugar on top with a dusting of cinnamon.  OMG! I will totally make this again.  Sadly, I've eaten almost have the cake myself.

as suggested by other reviewers, i added 1t cinnamon to the flour mixture and sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking.  this is the BEST banana bread EVER. (i have been using an old stand-by recipe for years and this has now replaced it).

This bread was very easy to make, but it wasn't what I was hoping for.  The banana flavor was definitely there, but the bread texture left something to be desired.

This is a very good Banana Bread recipe. It is moist and flavorful but I feel it is missing something, but not sure what that is. I usually use a recipe from a well known bakery in Boston and it has 2 TBS. sour cream. I am going to try this recipe again and add the sour cream and see if it brightens this up just a bit. The family did enjoy this with coffee this morning. Thanks for sharing!

I doubled this and omitted the nuts. (This will be a gift and I never know if the person I gift the bread to will be allergic.) Easy to pull together and baked up beautifully. It darkens faster than your average bread, so make sure to cover it with foil halfway through to keep from scorching/burning.

This is pretty good, but not great.  I will stick to my standard recipe for now.  It is a lot better toasted with butter than it is plain.

Yummy!!!  I had to make banana bread today because my 2 year old decided to peel all the bananas I had in the house, so I decided to try this recipe since I don't have one that I use on a regular basis.  I think this will be the one I use all the time now!  This is so good and moist...even my 2 year old, who hates bananas (but apparently loves peeling them), kept shoveling it in and saying "I like it!  Want more, please!"

I made this for my coworkers and everyone lived it!  It had a great banana flavor without being overwhelming.  What a great hearty, dense bread.  It was a huge hit!  I'll definitely keep this as my standard banana bread recipe.

Excellent texture and flavor.  The only thing different I did was use brandy for the vanilla and topped with a coating of brown sugar before baking.  Exactly 1 hour at 350 and it was perfect, moist and delicious.  The house smelled so wonderful too!

This was a rich, flavorful banana nut bread. I don't like my banana bread to be bland; after trying a few of the other recipes on this website, I've settled on this one and won't search anymore! I like to sprinkle sugar on top of the batter before I stick it in the oven to make a sweet topping.

What a fantastic recipe! The brown sugar gave it such a wonderful flavor. It's easy to prepare, and practially fool-proof; due to some "human error" I was half convinced it wouldn't turn out, but it came out perfectly! I'll never search for another banana bread recipe again. Thanks so much!

I lessened the baking powder by a small margin. 
Baking time in my convection oven has consistently been 1hr 20min.
it is a staple whenever bananas start to darken, so much so that our family waits to eat bananas specifically to give a reason to make bread.

A great use of very ripe spotted bananas.  I made as directed and it turned out delicious. You can taste the difference from using brown sugar rather than white sugar. I baked in three mini loaves rather than one full size loaf.  As with all quick breads, my family enjoyed it toasted best, for breakfast.

Very delicious banana bread. I added dried cranberries, a teaspoon of cinnamon, and used pecans instead of walnuts. I also baked for 45 minutes instead of an hour because the bread began to look too brown around the sides.

Have I reviewed this before?  I don't know, but I just have to say (maybe again) that its my favorite banana bread recipe!  Its easy, moist, delicious, and I almost always have all the ingredients on hand.  Anytime I've got bananas that are getting too ripe for snacking, I make this bread.  My boys don't like nuts, so for them I substitute chocolate chips.  My co-workers get the original version, and a loaf in the break room never makes it past 10am.

Wonderful recipe, I've made it a couple times. My newest customization includes approximately one cup of grated carrots and a quarter cup minced fresh ginger in place of the walnuts.  I also swap out the white flour for wholewheat and add one teaspoon ground cinnamon and a half teaspoon nutmeg.

The bread turned out pretty and light but it tasted too strong of baking powder.

This recipe sounds better than it tastes. I followed it to a T and it turned out pretty "cakey" and not as thick and heavy as I like my banana bread. Seems like it could use more banana flavor, too. It's definitely edible, just not what I was looking for. 3.5 stars

Even with 4 bananas something else (maybe the brown sugar itself) overpowered the banana flavor.  The texture was also not what we're use to in a banana bread.  The really odd part was the black flecks you usually get with banana bread, were no where to be found.

This recipe indroduced me to this site. I love how it uses butter instead of shortening and the liberal use of vanilla. I usually omit the walnuts and always omit salt when using salted butter. I get rave reviews whenever i make this bread to share and I have yet to throw away any leftovers because it has been hanging around the house too long!

I made this bread and it wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be.  I only used 2 bananas, because that's all I had, that probably played a role in the sweetness... or lack of it.  Next time I try making it, I will use 4 bananas, as the recipie calls for..

Use this batter to bake in muffin tins for 30 mins. Less mess (no cutting a loaf of bread). Top each one with brown sugar, maple syrup n nuts that have been microwaved for 2 secs.

If you have extra bananas lying around, bake this bread! I had been using an old recipe for banana bread for years, then I tried this, and WOW! I didn't have any nuts in the cupboard, so I added raisins instead, it was wonderful! A nice soft, cakey bread.

Okay I liked this and the issues I had were prolly my own fault. Made this a while ago just gotten around to noting my review good thing i make notes. It was kinna 'wet' in the middle some where. It was still enjoyed by all of those that had got to have a piece. I used more bananas than the recipie called for which may have been part of my issue. But for a first time baker of this i think it went well I will make it again. thanks.. and yum

Update: Almost nine years later, this is still my go-to banana bread. It’s wonderful.
***
Love this. I've made this once with three bananas and once with four. I've added an extra tablespoon of vanilla both times. (Best tip I've garnered from baking blogs — splurge on good vanilla extract. There's a real, discernible difference.) Like the other reviewers, I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients and added brown sugar to the top of the batter before baking for the extra crisp to the top of the bread. I made this the second time without nuts because I ran out. It was so good each time. Will make this again and again. Also! I added about 10 minutes to the baking time. Check with a wooden skewer, you want moist, not wet!

I thought this banana nut bread was delicious. My sister loved it also. I followed the recipe and did not change a thing. I had some bananas that were to ripe for my taste so I decided to make bread with them.  I know some reviewers commented that four bananas were to much but I used a couple of medium to small bananas. That may have made a difference. I will definitely make it again.

For us this turned out dry, overcooked and not very sweet.  We only had 3 bananas this could have made the bread not as moist as desired.  The cooking time was about 10 minutes too long as well.  (I have made other breads that I had to add additional baking time so I don't think it was our oven)

This banana bread is delish!  I screwed it up by melting the butter instead of just softening it.  I also used half the required butter and half apple sauce.  Subbed chocolate chips for the walnuts as a personal preference.  This bread is moist, dense and really not too much fat.  I only gave it four stars as it is nothing out of this world...just a good old banana bread.  I will use this recipe again!

I used this recipe to make muffins instead of a loaf and it turned out pretty well! Next time, I'll try adding a crumb topping for a little bite more browning on top. Thank you for the recipe!

I choose this recipe because it used brown sugar instead of white sugar, and because it used 4 ripe bananas instead, of 2. This is the BEST BANANA NUT BREAD I HAVE EVER HAD!!!! My loaf was so moist and delicious, I will use this recipe from now on, it is the best.

This recipe is so easy and it's one of those fail proof quick fixes that you can customize to your liking! I always add up to 1/4 a cup of sour cream to my mix and a little cinnamon to spice it up just a tad, try making a cream cheese spread / frosting or even dusting the top with some additional brown or powdered sugar..yum yum! everyone always gobbles it right up.

Perfectly moist and wonderful.  I did use oil instead of butter and only had 3 very ripe bananas, and it was still amazing.  This will be my permanent banana nut bread recipe!

This was a nice base for banana nut bread...I tweaked the recipe to suit my own tastes.  I used half brown /half white sugar and pre-sifted my flour so it would not turn out too dense, which sometimes happens with banana nut bread.  I added a packet of instant banana pudding for additional flavor and moisture, along with some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Oh…I also used very nicely ripened bananas for the best flavor.  To bake, I used small individual loaf pans and they turned out perfectly.

This bread is tasty- although I would not have minded if it was a tad bit sweeter.  I pretty much followed the recipe- used half brown and half white instead of all brown sugar and added a tbsp of maple syrup.  The bread had a nice texture to it.  However it was not done in an hour and I let it bake an additional 15 min. at 350.  I will make again and add a touch more sugar.

My cooking time was acutally 45-50 min? Good tasting and very easy to make! My family couldn't wait for the bread to cool... served it with "French Vanilla" topping. Yum!

I found this to be somewhat lacking in flavor.  Were I to make it again, I would add cinnamon and perhaps some allspice and nutmeg.  Brown sugar sprinkled on the top helps.

Yummy! I didn't have 4 bananas, only 3, so I used 1/3 cup milk to make sure there was enough moisture. It worked great. Also, I added some cinnamon to the batter. I greased the pan and "floured" it with sugar which gave the loaf a nice added touch of sweetness. Also, I sprinkled some brown sugar and cinnamon on top before baking. After an hour, the middle was still a little gooey, so I turned off the oven and left the bread in for another 15 minutes, per another review. It was perfection!

Yum!  I'm eating a piece right now!  I doubled the recipe thank goodness or we'd be fighting over it.  Thanks for the suggestion on sprinkling brown sugar on top, it was great.  My husband said this is now his favorite, even replacing his favorite cake.  I used pecans because that's what I had and I was a little short on bananas but it turned out great.  Thanks, it's a keeper!

I have made banana bread for many years.  This is moist and I love the walnuts in it.  I did "chunk" the walnuts and everybody raved over it.

Easy recipe, but just not sweet enough.  I did sprinkle a bit of brown sugar and chopped nuts on top so I am just eating the top...  I would add at least 3/4 c. more sugar to this. It also came out very dark... never have seen such a dark banana bread.

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I make 2 batches, 1 with choc chips n nuts, and 1 just nuts.  Yummy!
I always freeze my brown bananas until I need them.  When I thaw them there is this awesome juice they secrete.  I always use the juice right along with the bananas and it makes this recipe even moister.

I made this and I added chocolate chips to one loaf,  second just the nuts.  They turned out super yummy and went fast.  Even the hard to please were liking this recipe.  Plus,  I freeze my brown bananas,  and when they thaw there is this awesome juice,  I substitute the juice for some of the liquid,  wow. .. what a flavor boost!  This recipe called for no liquid so I just added some anyhow.  1/8th cup.

Made this today and my family LOVED it. Only change I made was using applesauce instead of butter...Because I didn't realize we were out of butter when I planned to make this. This was super great. Definitely going to make again and again!

I followed the other suggestions and used only  three bananas and a whole cup of walnuts. I also added a tsp of cinnamon and that really gave the end result  a fantastic taste. For anyone who is used to sticking to the  instructions  and following them exactly, try to sway from what is written. Trust me I´ve tried to make this by sticking to instructions and when you deviate from them it tastes a lot better

It was good, however I tweaked it, and added a half cup of granulated sugar and an extra half teaspoon of vanilla extract.

Once I put the batter in the 9X13 pan, I put a line of cinnamon & sugar mixture down the middle of the batter and swirled it. This bread was delicious. It was perfectly moist and my family loved it.

Overall, this was a great recipe for bananas I had that were a bit too ripe for my liking. I must say that I used a pan slightly smaller than the suggested size so it had take a bit longer for the loaf to cook tot the center. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

I love this recipe! Moist and delicious. I add about 1/2 a cup more brown sugar. I put a little brown sugar on the top. We like it sweet! Mine took a little longer at a lower temperature to prevent the sugar from getting too dark. My family loves it and its easy to make.

In my opinion….it’s DELICIOUS! For me this will be the only recipe I need for brown sugar banana bread....it's quick and simple to make.  I made a small sample loaf to see if I would like it in addition to making the big loaf.  I ate the whole sampler loaf before I realized it.  I’m a coffee drinker and this will be perfect for my morning and evening coffee time.

just served this recipe and received rave reviews for it. I have a friend who cannot eat nuts so I replaced the walnuts with chopped up white almond bark (I had in drawer). The second one was made according to the directions above. Both breads turned out exceptional. I baked the breads for 1hr and 8 mins. That's with using 4 banana. Love this recipe, Thank you!

Followed the recipe exactly then added brown sugar to the top before baking. Absolutely wonderful taste and the brown sugar made a sweet crunch. Best Banana Bread I ever had!

This is one of my favorite go-to recipes.  I have everything on hand when one of the family has a taste for banana bread.  I add some cinnamon and some nutmeg--I don't measure just add a bit.  I also sprinkle the brown sugar on top.  I usually add 3 bananas then taste the mix.  If I need more banana flavor then I add a fourth.  Great as banana muffins as well!

I didn't have any walnuts, and only had 3 small overripe bananas, but I added another 1/2 cup of flour, another 1 t of vanilla, 1 T of cinnamon, 1 t of cloves, and 1/8 t of nutmeg.  Turned out awesome!  A great bread to go with coffee or for desert.  I also topped the loaf with oats and brown sugar before I put it in the oven.  It looked so pretty when it came out that no one wanted to cut into it!

Soooooo wonderful but we use 5 bananas and they are bananas that were waaaaaay ripe and then put in freezer(not peeled, just how you bought 'em at the store).  They have usually been in the freezer for a LOOOOOONG time, months and months even.   They seem to make the best:)

This was nice, but not great in my opinion.  I only had 3 very ripe bananas.  I added a dash more vanilla and a dash more salt.  Also, used pecans instead of walnuts.  This was lacking in flavor, but it may be that I am missing the flavor of the walnuts, and maybe the additional banana would have made the difference - still good though. Will try again with the walnuts and the additional banana.

I love this recipe!  I made it the second time a little different. I added peeled, diced green apple to the banana mixture.  This added moisture and great flavor to the bread.

This bread came out dense and floury-tasting..and a bit dry..Improved a bit the next day: I thought it got more moist and buttery.  Not bad, but have had more success with other recipes.

my first time making banana bread and it was a success! I'm proud to share it with friends.  I took the advise of others and increased the walnut quantity a bit and I only used 3 bananas. It was a tad bit 'cake like' but I like that lightness texture. Next time (yes i will make it again for sure!) I would add more brown sugar for that extra crunch on the outside.

Texture turned out GREAT, my only issue is, my flavors are not jumping out at all! I was expecting more banana flavor (since I used 6 banana's) and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. Can someone give me some tips on how to get more flavor?

Delicious! I doubled everything for two loaves and it came out perfect!  A tiny bit of crispness to the crust, warm brown sugar flavor and super moist, this one is probably tied for first place in my banana bread collection.  Thanks J.R.!

I followed the directions, however I think next time I would cut back on the vanilla a little, it's a tad bit too strong.  Other than that it was very moist and tasted great!  Something easy to take a slice of for hurried breakfastes...

This was a great and easy recipe! As previously mentioned, my batter looked a bit runny, so I followed my instincts and added a handful of flour (maybe about 1/4c or less)to get a more muffin like batter. As a result my bread was more bread-like than cake-like. One of the difficult things about this recipe is that bananas can range in size/texture. Also if you stir too much after you fold in the nuts they settle to the bottom. Like everyone i put brown sugar on top before baking. this was delicious!

A little dark and heavy, but sweet and tasty.  I used a non-aluminum baking powder (Rumford) and a glass pan to bake.  Simple variation(s)   Use KAHLÚA Especial instead of Vanilla Extract 1/ 2 cup cranberries or raisins and three bananas

I followed this recipe exactly and it was the best banana nut bread I have made! It was very moist and had great flavor. My family loved it, along with everyone else. The only thing different that I did was cook it about 10 min. longer than stated. I highly recommend this recipe!

Very good and easy recipe but I felt it wasn't sweet enough.   I added only 3 bananas and maybe that had something to do with it.  It's a very good recipe and I will  make it again but next time I will add a little bit of white sugar to the mix.  I also took the suggestion from someone else and added 1/4 cup of sour cream.  Added brown sugar to the top and some oats to give it a little crunch.

I made it last afternoon and this morning my whole house still smells like banana bread… delicious!!!
It was my first attempt at making banana bread, and I had no brown sugar on hand and my bananas were very ripe, so I search in this site http://www.ochef.com  (by the way, it is very good for questions) and they suggest to “substitute white sugar for brown sugar on a 1 to 1 basis, but add 4 tablespoons of molasses per cup, and decrease the total amount of liquid in the recipe by 3 tablespoons”. I did so and reduce the mashed bananas in 3 TBS.
Instead of nuts, I used 1 cup of almonds. It was done in 1 hour. Was extremely sweet, but delicious and beautifully browned!!!. Next time I will reduce the sugar.
Easy to make.

Very good - I didn't have any brown sugar for my "brown sugar banana bread".  So I cut the sugar in half and added 1 tbsp of maple syrup and one package of apple cinnamon instant oatmeal.  It came out great - super hearty!  But it does need more than an hour to bake like... 90 minutes?

I followed the recipe to a "T" and this recipe did not turn out well for me. It lacked the sweetness of other nut breads that I've tried from this site. I think another cup of sugar might have done the trick.
Very disappointing to say the least. I've been a member for nearly 8 years and plan my meals solely from here.

Great recipe, very easy. The first batch was gone in less than 6 hours. I had to make 2 more batches for visitors and family! I used 6 bananas and 3/4 c of nuts since I like a lot of flavor in my bread. I also ran out of baking powder, using 2 teaspoons instead of 3 and it still came out fine. If you lower the heat to 325 and bake for 25, you can make 18-20 muffins.

This recipe was delicious.  The changes I made were to make it a healthier.  I substituted 1 cup of Whole Wheat Flour, added a half cup of organic rolled oats, and drizzled honey over the top and sprinkled with cinnamon while still were.  Served after refrigerated - it tastes better chilled!

This was so easy and got RAVE reviews, although I did make alterations. Instead of butter, I used peanut butter, and in place of the nuts, I used PB & chocolate swirled chips. I also made this into muffins and sprinkled a little brown sugar on the tops, at the suggestion of some of the other reviewers. I will definitely make this one over and over!

very yummy. sifted flour twice prior to mixing -- just beacuse my breads always sag and droop -- but this one came out light and fluffy! (and used self raising flour/no additional baking powder) Used the advice to sprinkle brown sugar and waluts on top --great idea and yummy texture! wonderful experience!

I followed this recipe for half the serving, and put in some coconut flakes and almonds instead of walnuts. This turned out to be one of the most delicious muffins I've ever made! Thanks for the recipe :)

Loved it.  I added about 1 1/2 to 2 cups walnuts and a bit of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove to the dry ingredients.  Very easy and delicious.  I think this is my new banana bread recipe!

This is a really great recipe to turn vegan. Just swap out the butter for oil, and the eggs for egg replacer. It came out wonderful! I also added cinn. and ginger, and topped with extra walnuts and sugar.

I added cinnamon and a packet of butterscotch cook and serve pudding.  It was moist and great.  I sprinkled nuts on the top and when finished drizzled a glaze over top.  It was moist and tasty.

I am sorry, but this is just not the best recipe for banana bread. I have been making banana breads for 25 odd years and this one is not a keeper.I made this just as the recipe stated and it was so pale in color on the inside and way too heavy and dense. It needs to cook longer than one hour also. Try 70 minutes.Less banana, about 2 large, very ripe bananas. Very disappointed in this one. There are much better recipes on this site for banana bread.Try the banana banana bread recipe. sorry....

I am not sure why this is not a 5 star across the board? This is the ultimate banana bread! I added more walnuts and a three drops of banana extract because my banana's were not real ripe yet. and wa-LLA, the perfect banana bread. I also cooked for 1 hour and 15 min. PERFECTION!

This is a cake like loaf. It was the best right whem it came out of the oven. I sprinkled some walnut pieces over the top before I put it in the oven to bake. I might try it as a actual cake one day, serve it with some coffee. Brunch with the girls will be great!

This is a great recipe!  I added a box of banana instant pudding mix and some mini chocolate chips.  I made muffins instead of bread and baked them about 20 minutes, then just kept checking them every 2-3 mi until they were done. I lost track of the exact time, but it was about a 1/2 hr.  This recipe made 36 muffins.  The kids had them warm out of the oven after school for their snack.  I felt like "suzy homemaker"!  They RAVED about them!

What an awesome recipe!  My husband and I had half of the loaf when it came out of the oven - we could not wait for it to cool.  He just kept commenting how great the "cake" was and that I will now have to do it more often - first time I even attempt to make banana nut bread.  Wonderful smell while it is baking, simple and delicious.  Only thing is I used the bisquick mix instead of the flour, salt and baking powder.  Great recipe - a keeper!

Came together very easy. Only had two bananas so I added a tad of banana extract as well. Very pretty color. I thought it could have been a bit sweeter. Family seems to like it just fine.

The first time I made this the center of the bread was not done.  So the next time I made it, I split it up between 2 loaf pans and they came out great just a little short.  I found out why it didn't cook right the first time, my loaf pan is smaller than the one recommended, silly my I didn't even look.  It tasted so yummy and now I even put the batter in muffin cups and make muffins.

I didn't change this recipe at all.  It is excellent.  I used 4 rather large bananas and it worked out perfectly.  The only thing I added was a sprinkle of brown sugar to the top of the cake before baking.  It took about an hour in my oven.  Great recipe!!

I think by now I must have tried every single banana bread recipe on this site.  I could never find one exactly to my liking.  Well, I think my search is over.  This banana bread is light and fluffy, and rose nicely, with a crunchy crust and a moist crumb.  I did change the recipe ever so slightly, though, using about 1 3/4 cups flour, three bananas, and just half a cup of sugar.

Flavor was great but texture was not.  It was crumbly.  I make a new banana bread recipe weekly from all recipes (for my daycare) and this was my least favorite.  The kids still loved it even though it crumbled.

I made this b/c I didn't have baking soda.  I'm glad I did b/c this was so delicious!  The traditional version can be heavy, but this is light AND moist.  The butter I spread on it made it so wonderful!

This is my first banana nut bread and it came out fantastic! I hardly ever make cakes or breads from scratch because it is usually easier to buy a boxed mix, but boy am I glad I tried this one. So simple and so good! I'll be making this very often. Thanks for the recipe.

This banana nut bread recipe is the best I've come across.  I'm not sure what does the trick whether it be the extra vanilla or the whisking/sifting the dry ingredients or brown sugar instead of white or what, but for kicks I made a struesel topping (flour, brn sugar, nuts, and butter) that I put on top about 20 minutes into baking and it added an extra flare in the final result.  I love this recipe!  Usually quick bread recipes that I use don't take up the entire 9X5 bread pan but this one did and I can't wait to share the loaf with my neighbors!  It's so entirely moist and light and full of flavor -defintely one of my comfort foods.  Thank you!

I can't even count how many times I've made this recipe since I found it a few weeks ago. This is an excellent recipe. Wouldn't change a thing about it. Super easy. Easy enough to memorize quickly. Everybody loves it. I make it into loaves, rounds and muffins. I give them to everyone I know and they all love it too! Thank you for an outstanding recipe.

Great basic recipe that you can tweak to your preferences. I changed it up a bit. Added a couple tbls of flaxseed meal, handful of presoaked raisins, and a few dashes of cinnamon. I also used pecans instead of walnuts and sprinkled some rolled oats on top before baking.

I swapped out the nuts for chocolate chips. It’s pretty good. Not the moistest banana bread I’ve ever had, but it’s not dry. Still good though.

I used part of this recipe along with a couple of others to create my own in the past, but this time the only deviations I made were using pecans and substituting wax paper for oiling the pan.

Thanks for the delicious recipe: two slices hot out of the oven with butter made for a wonderfully sweet Sunday!

Update: 11/3/19 I used walnuts this time and  2/3 tablespoon of vanilla with 1/3 tablespoon of almond extract plus a dash of cinnamon and lastly greased the pan with butter—— decadent!! Thanks again for the recipe.

Love this recipe. Just as is. I lost my original Brown Sugar Banana Bread recipe from the back of the C&H Brown Sugar box, and the others online (even the one from C&H), just weren’t the ones.

Very moist and has a fresh clean taste to it but it’s not sweet enough.  I may add extra brown sugar or a little bakers sugar to the existing recipe to add a slight sweet kick to it.   I poured honey on it and it taste great

This recipe is as close to a perfect banana bread as you can get.  Extremely moist and fabulous flavour.  First time I made it I made no changes to recipe.  2nd time I used a little less than 1/2 cup nuts and added 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips as well.

I made this recipe after reading many of the reviews and although I made it exactly as written, I think I would prefer using white sugar next time as opposed to brown sugar as the recipe called for.  From my past experience making banana bread, the white sugar adds a better  flavour.

This is by far my favorite banana bread recipe! I did add two tablespoons of honey, and used sliced almonds instead of walnuts (I didn't have any walnuts). I also sprinkled some sugar on top. All in all, very delicious

I always make this recipe when I want to make banana bread. I like tomix a handful or two of crushed walnuts in mine and then sprinkle some on the top along with a sprinkling of brown sugar before I bake it. It's generally gone within a few hours because I can't keep the kids out of it!

I'm going to be making this again however I think the batter needs to be split into two loaf pans when I made it the first time it overflowed and Spilled Out the side so I think it was just too much batter for one pan however seems to be a great recipe and smells

Just a great recipe. I doubled the amount of nuts and bananas. We like it nutty and with more banana taste. I also used one of those mini loaf pans which allowed me to share the bread with family. Also I froze unused loaves for later.  It's a repeat recipe.

I've made this for years.   Today I only had 3 bananas and it was just as good.   Pecans or walnuts work.    My oven got this done in 55 mins.    When it smells like it's done... it is !

LOVED IT!  I did take some of the reviewer's suggestions and cut back the baking powder to 2 Tbsp. and added about a tsp. of cinnamon.  I also used the mini loaf pans so I could use these as small gifts for teachers, etc.  It is delicious,  moist, beautiful finished brown color.  Will definitely make this one again, probably this week.

Delish! Did make some changes though. Sprinkled in some cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon and also added 1/3 of a cup of sour cream and only 1 1/2 cups of flour. Amazing and I would make it again!

I'm sorry but this was terrible.  I have been making brown sugar banana bread since I was 7 with my grandmother. This bread had an AWFUL BITTER TASTE! So bad I threw it away!  I have made several other banana bread recipes off this site but this one was so bad I had to sign up just to leave this comment. Do not add 3 tsp of baking powder.  And what's up with the milk? To much flour as well!  Since I don't like leaving this terrible review I am making another loaf right now and fixing a few ingredients.   I personally have never made banana bread with milk.  So I'm going to use baking Sosa instead of powder.  And the correct amount which is like 1 tsp of baking soda. Hopefully this helps!

I guess some folks can't read what is rite in front of them, have made this and it's excellent! Tam mentions the recipe says to mix the milk and flour mixture, no where in the instructions does it say to mix the "milk", it's not listed, It's Not even Mentioned, Tam must have her recipes mixed up!

This was a very good banana bread and it was easy to make.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used 3 bananas instead of 4 and sprinkled some brown sugar on top to add a little extra sweetness.  I'm saving this and will definitely be making again!

Delicious. I made it and added brown sugar on top.  I did not realize my pan was too small until I started pouring the batter.  I had some batter left over so I made muffins. The kids love them.

I used this recipe because I did not have any baking soda and only had baking powder. I did make a few changes to it so my rating is for five stars with a few adjustments. I used three huge bananas instead of four small/medium ones & a teaspoon banana extract because I had it and was short on a banana so figured why not.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and a half cup white sugar because I was running out of brown, I added tablespoon cinnamon and a teaspoon nutmeg. 
I cooked in a buttered cupcake pan for 20 minutes checked on them and they were pretty much done left them in for two more minutes maybe, filled the muffins up to top because they don't rise much and they were moist and delicious. Also I added a cup walnuts!  I have made maybe four other banana recipes in the past but have this one in my favorites now!

Nice moist bread - I like it a little less sweet overall so reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup -  then added 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips! I also added a splash more vanilla and two teaspoons of almond extract - yum!

I added to the recipe a 1/4  cup of milk, 1/2 cup of raisins, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp clove. So, I guess I just changed the recipe. It turned out like a moist bread pudding and I truly enjoyed it. I normally do not like bread pudding because it is too wet and too sweet for me. However, I will continue to search for a banana nut bread that has the consistency of bread.

We added 1/3 cup sour cream as some else mentioned and we also added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. These two additions made it even more moist and flavorful. It was amazing banana bread and we will defiantly make it again the next time we don't eat our bananas soon enough!

The recipe turned out pretty good, but the ingredient list did not include milk and I must admit, I found the bread to be a but on the dry side, but it was still tasty.  I did add pumpkin Pie spice and I used browned butter.  I didn't have any nuts on hand, but i did have some Muslix that had nuts in it and that worked pretty well.

I loved how it wasn't real sweet too.  I think the next time I will try adding some sour cream as another reviewer did.

I rated the recipe 3 stars because I am unclear about the milk.

I followed the recipe, and added 1 teaspoon of maple syrup, ½ teaspoon cinnamon, ½ cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Sprinkle brown sugar on the bottom of the pan, and on top of the bread before baking… It's delicious!!

I really liked this recipe and most importantly it's the first banana bread recipe I've made that my husband actually likes. I did put in a full cup of chopped walnuts and then sprinkled brown sugar, chopped walnuts and cinnamon on the top. Thank you for sharing your recipe.

I made only a few changes.   I  substituted one cup of whole grain wheat flour, did not have walnuts, and used a teaspoon of almond extract.   I used all of the bananas that the recipe called for.

It was very flavorful! The texture was spongy and moist. I added chocolate chips to the top. I would make it again but with 3 bananas as well. It didn't cook in the center completely. I took it out because the rest was perfectly baked. I would definatetle love to bake this again!!!

Followed the instructions to a T. It was really good. I added almonds inside instead of walnuts, but that's just a preference. Added cinnamon on top as well. I didn't even realize no milk was used until I looked at the comments. Moist insides, nicely crisp bread on the outside. Absolutely delicious.

Delicious!  I started out doubling this recipe and forgot what I was doing. What's new ADHD! So my eggs went in at the wrong time the wrong way. Oops!  Followed it mostly only I used 1 tsp maple extract to replace 1 vanilla. I used extra walnuts. I like that bitter taste they have. All in all I stuck pretty close to recipe. It's turned out beautiful and tastes delicious. New fav!  Served mine hot out of oven with cream cheese. Think I will have it for lunch too.

I used three bananas and 3/4 tsp baking soda instead of baking powder and the recipe turned out excellent. Took about 1 hour and 5 minutes in an oven with temperature swings 160 to 220 degrees C.

I just made this and followed the direction's step by step. The only thing I didn't add was walnut's and I guess it makes a HUGE difference. I made this into muffins as well. Also added some brown sugar on the top before baking, and honestly the one good part was the top with a tad bit of butter. It tasted pretty bland other than that. I have definitely have had better banana bread. I will not try this recipe again.

This was nice! Nothing fantastic, but easy ingredients and easy to adapt to your own. Not as dense as previous banana breads I've made, but those were too dense. I used whole wheat flour and flaxmeal and water instead of eggs, I also added about a quarter cup of greek yoghurt, some chocolate chunks and spices. I think the whole wheat flour made it a bit heavier and denser, it wasn't as 'cake-like' as others have described. Yum!

I didn't have any white sugar so I couldn't use my other recipe so I was glad to find this recipe.I'm so glad that happened because I loved this BNB! I had 5 ripe bananas so that's how many I used. I had to bake about 10 minutes longer  and the bread is super moist. It reminds me of banana nut muffins rather than a bread but it is delicious. This is now my go-to recipe for when I have over-ripe bananas.

With the suggested change of adding 1/3 c. sour cream I would give it 4.5 to 5 stars! We like pecans and choc chips and 1/4 tsp nutmeg and cinnamon each.

Let me say that this is one of the best banana bread recipes I have made, and I have made quite a few over the years. I didn't make any changes. I thought it was going to be a flop because our power went off with about 15 minutes left, but fortunately it wasn't out for long and I left the oven shut and once the power came back it finished baking just took a little longer, but the finished product is really good!! Will definitely make again.

Loooove this recipe! I did substitute apple sauce for butter only because I didn't have enough butter on hand and I sprinkled brown sugar on top and omitted the nuts just because I have small children. Very good flavor! I did read a review about mixing it too much will cause dryness... I mixed just enough to moisten it and it worked! I will definitely be using this recipe from now on!

Yummy! I have made this delicious banana bread and it was wonderful! I added some chocolate chips as well as the walnuts and it was great! I am making another loaf now minus the walnuts and added some brown sugar on top. I am sure it is going to be great. Thanks for sharing your recipe! ??

This was good, but I had hoped it would have been moister.  It was a little bit cake-like.  I did wind up eating the whole thing though.  Trust me, I don't turn my nose up at anything cake-like!  Thanks, J. R.!

It was good, easy.  Not as moist as other banana breads I've made and I like my banana bread dense and banana-y.  But it was sweet and a nice quick bread to take to a lunch.  Thanks!

This came out great!!! The cook time was much less for me. Luckily I checked it at 43 minutes or it would have burned. I followed the recipe almost exact. I used margarine because I didn't have enough butter. Maybe that effected the cook time???? I also added about a Tbs. of cinnamon like others suggested and I topped with brown sugar and cinnamon. I saved this recipe so I can make it again, Thanks!

I was out of white sugar so I couldn't make the banana bread recipe that I usually make.  This is very good and easy to make.  I doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves.  I used 6 bananas for  the 2 and it turned out very well.  It is a little more cake-like and  I like it more like bread, thus the 4 stars instead of 5.

I loved it, the ingredients are simple, directions easy to follow. The only thing I changed was three bananas instead of four so the banana flavor isn't overbearing. And I also add chocolate chips instead of nuts.

This bread came out great.  I like to add honey, cinnamon and blueberries, but that is my own personal touch.  The recipe itself gives a very sweet, moist bread.

Baked last night, wasn't as sweet as I would like it would add more sugar. Added more nuts as I love nuts but doing so overwhelmed, stick to suggested measure, might try again but need to let this experience wear off first, easy recipe just not what I expected but will try as directed once more with just a bit more sugar

Overall, this recipe is pretty good, but I don't love it.  I made mine into muffins topped with struesel and I added 2 tsp cinnamon and 1/3 cup sour cream.  I love cinnamon, so I added it just out of preference, but after tasting the finished product I think without the cinnamon the bread would have been a bit bland.  The sour cream was to make the bread nice and moist, I dunno if it actually made a difference or not, if so the bread would have been a bit dry without it.  Definitely better than just okay.

The taste was great, it was very dense and moist.  I will probably make this again but adjust the cook time because an hour was just too long. I think 45 minutes would be plenty.

This is my go-to banana bread recipe when I have overripe bananas because it's super simple and easy to half or double it depending on how many bananas I have to use up. I've changed it up by adding cinnamon & nutmeg, orange zest, substituting pecans or mini chocolate chips for the walnuts, etc.
I once had a request for this banana bread when I didn't have any ripe bananas - so I put fresh ones in the oven at 300 degrees for 20 to 30 minutes, until the peels turned black and the insides were soft and caramelized.  This works really well!

This is the first time I've ever made banana bread and it won't be the last!  I didn't have enough brown sugar, so I used white sugar to make up the difference, and it still came out great! I've never made banana bread before, but this recipe will be THE banana bread recipe I use from now on.   I loved how moist and fluffy the inside was, and the "crunchy" top - this would also make a good muffin recipe as I don't like dense muffins or snacking breads. And my family LOVES it - the recipe was enough to fill 2 8x5 loaf pans, which is good because we devoured the first one in one sitting!   Thanks for posting this recipe!

This bread is amazing. I used 5 really ripe bananas and was greeted with a very flavorful, moist bite upon first taste. It's not overly sweet and is has great dense texture. Mmm. I didn't realize I was out of nuts until it was time to fold them in, but they weren't missed a bit. Great recipe!

Good flavor and good way to use up old bananas, but a little too dense for my tastes.  I didn't use nuts and only 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla because I don't want any flavors taking the lead over the delicate banana flavor.

The banana nut bread was wonderful.  Just like the ones we had when I was a kid, some 60+ years ago.  Yum!  My only  suggestion is rub butter over the top the minute it comes out of the oven.  Double Yum!

I didn't want to use the butter and I only had two large bananas, so I substituted with a cup of apple sauce. I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg. The flavor turned out really well, but I'm sure it's because my bananas were extremely overripe. If they had been less black, I would have needed more banana to get a good banana flavor. It came out very moist, and a day later it hasn't dried out at all. My roommate and I have eaten almost half the loaf already!

Very banana-y flavoured with 4 bananas. Also wet in the middle even after baking for over an hour.  Otherwise very happy with the way it turned out.  Will decrease bananas to 3 next time.

Very little flavor - could be operator error though. :)   I didn't use very ripe bananas... could that be it?  It was very moist though.  I could taste the nuts but not much banana or brown sugar.  I used a stone loaf pan, therefore, I baked at 325 for 50 mins and it came out nicely.    Husband doesn't like the taste so the birds will be fed well tonight.

This was so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully.  Very moist and lots of flavor.  Unfortunately, it didn't last long!  Will definitely be making another one soon.

This was my first time preparing a bread type of dessert and it turned out fan-tabulous!  My husband, who is not a pastry/snacky-cake kinda man, loved.  I will say the quantity of materials makes 2 loaves easily.  Thanks for sharing- will be making again soon, perhaps as gifts!

This turned out VERY good, but I think next time I might add a little bit of white sugar to the mix. I thought it could be a little bit sweeter, but it was VERY good. I also added a little more nuts because I love them!

Well, tis scrumptious. I made the cake according to directions except that I included one grated apple for more moisture. When it was done I drizzled a mixture of lemon juice and icing sugar over the loaf while it was just warm. It was a 10 on the yummy meter. I did have to bake it for an extra 1/2 hour

This is the first banana bread I've actually made.. or even tasted.. but it was sooooo freakin good! Especially when it's warm. It's very easy to make. Followed the recipe exactly except for I didn't add walnuts. I didn't have any.. but I did add just a few pecans because I had some.. and just to see how it would taste.. it was just as good. Will def keep making!

My family and I loved this recipe. My Dad is allergic to eggs, so I used applesauce and a little bit of olive oil as a substitute, and it held together beautifully. I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe is awesome!  This is the first time I've made banana nut bread from scratch.  I did add the sprinkling of brown sugar on top, as suggested by another member, and it's really wonderful.  Thank you!

I had some bananas that were too ripe to eat so I thought I would make some bread.  I didn't even have to go to the sore because I had everything I needed in my kitchen!  It turned out to be a beautiful bread.  I made one loaf plain and one loaf with chocolate chips mixed in and both were delicious!

EXCELLENT flavor & taste. however the instrustions are a little vague for a new cook. The recipe does not read sift flour prior to measuring, if you don't the berad might too dry. I added the flour mixture to the bananas, so that I could control the amount of flour, as the amt. depends on the size and ripness of bananas.

Actually 4 1/2 stars! Very good! Moist, perfect texture. I baked for 50 minutes at 325 & it was perfect. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there are a couple of BNB recipes I like a little better. But this one is truly really good!

This was pretty good. I made it exactly like the recipe called for, but it turned out a little dry. I think my oven may run a bit hot though. I wish I had read the post about brown sugar on the top earlier. Will try that one next time. The pecans sound like an awesome add in. Good, but definately needs a second chance for me. Not very much banana flavor.

This recipe made delicious bread. The only thing I changed was reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup, but thats just because my family doesn't really have a big sweet tooth.

Good recipe, though I only have the 4x8 pans, so one makes it too full, so I used 2 pans instead and cut back on the time to 45 minutes. Worked fine. Next time, I will double the recipe and make 3 loaf pans.

I was searching through the recipes for a good banana bread to bake; having never baked one before, it was a tough decision. I opted for this one and it turned out really great. The first time i made it i used three large bananas instead of four. Instead of nuts, i used a cup of golden raisens. I baked for exactly an hour and it was ready. Both me and my fiance thought it was really sweet and great tasting (and i didn't even use to like banana bread). I had two bananas left over so a few days later i made another loaf; this time i only had one egg, but the bread still turned out really great. I'd recommend this recipe to any first time banana bread maker! Easy to make and easier to eat.

I don't know what I did wrong. The batter was very thick and the bread was dry. I had 4 very large ripe bananas and I only used two of them. Maybe that's why it was dry? That's the only thing I changed about the recipe. Maybe my oven cooks hot. I'm not sure. I may give it another try.

Great recipe.  I didn't have 4 ripe bananas, just 2 un-ripe ones, so I cut the flour down to 1.5 cups.  Tasted great anyway!  As always, I used pecans instead of walnuts.   I've tried several other banana bread recipes on this site, and this is the best so far.

I really like this recipe.  The thing I liked best about it is that its not too sweet.  I didnt have walnuts so I substituted frozen blueberries and it turned out really good!

Not as sweet as i thought it would be, but very moist.  My family loved it the way it was, but I think I was the only one who thought it wasn't sweet enough.

We added a little oatmeal and chocolate chips in place of the nuts - which my husband can't eat - and it was very good.

Excellent recipe - we liked it best the next day - after having been cooled, wrapped and refrigerated overnight.  It was sweet and excellent.
