Absolutely WOW!  We had to make a couple of substitutions so we could use what we had on hand:  1) crushed pineapple instead of tidbits, 2) rice vinegar instead of distilled white, and 3) one little packet of pepper flakes from the local pizza chain store instead of the full teaspoon.  We used it as a dipping sauce with pork eggrolls and even tried it on sweet potato fries.  
The results: this is hands down the BEST sweet and sour sauce we've ever tasted!!  This will definitely be our go-to recipe from now on.  Thank you for sharing your recipe! :o)

This was very good.  My nine year old said it was "spot on"!  I left out the pepper flakes and just used the hot sauce.

A wonderfully delicious sweet and sour sauce!! My variation is slight:

I used apple cider vinegar instead of the white vinegar. I omitted the steak sauce and used Worcestershire Sauce instead. I added a little bit of ground ginger and garlic powder to taste. --> that's it! Otherwise I followed this recipe to a tee! 

I also cut the recipe in half since I am single and stored the left over in a jar in the refrigerator for another night.

Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!

My family is in LOVE with this sauce! Omitted the pepper flakes, used Worcestershire in place of steak sauce and used crushed pineapple in place of tidbits. They like it better than takeout! Thank you Nana! 10 stars for this dipping nectar!

Awesome sauce! I followed the recommendations of other reviewers, and cut the sugar to just a bit more than a cup, maybe a "heaping" cup. Only a pinch of red pepper flakes, too. We will DEFINITELY use this recipe again! Great recipe!

This is the BEST sweet and sour recipe I have ever tried. Easy to make and it was amazing just as written. I made an extra batch to freeze for using on other dishes too.   I used it tonight on the recipe Sweet and Sour Chicken 1 on here (the chicken batter is amazing on this recipe). The combination of these two recipes makes the BEST S&S Chicken my husband and I have ever eaten. Definitely a keeper.

Made this sweet & sour sauce tonight with some chicken and rice and the entire family loved it. Said it was comparable to that of our local Chinese restaurant's homemade sauce. Just a small alteration we made was to use fresh pineapple, rather than the canned (we mashed up the fresh to get some of the juices out, then tossed it all in). Also, since my daughters are 4 and 5 yrs old, they have no tolerance for anything remotely spicy, so we left out the red pepper flakes...but somehow were able to sneak the dash of hot pepper sauce by them :) Oh, also, for our family we cut this recipe in half and still had a good amount leftover!

So I have declared that this sauce is AMAZING! The only thing I don't like is the steak sauce......So I just don't put that in. I cut this in half and that's with a family of 2 Adults and 2 Children and we love our sauces! There is SO much left over sauce... I make 2 large chicken breast and one small one with another recipe on here for sweet and sour chicken! Good Luck and thanks for this yummy sauce!

This sauce was pretty good, but it tasted a little too much like ketchup. Next time I will half the ketchup, and use only 1 cup of sugar.
I also hope the sauce will keep well, because there is a lot of it!

This recipe was great. It makes a lot. I broke the recipe in half and still had some jarred up to keep in the fridge. Great as a stir fry topping, which is what I did with it. 
I also wouldn't hesitate to just use as a dip for chicken/chicken nuggets. I plan on making much more of this.

This Sauce is really the bomb! Just the right amount of Tang. We always make extra as it freezes really well. Don't change a thing!

Amazing!  Made it almost as is.  Just used Apple cider vinegar instead of white, only a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  Used sriracha for the hot sauce.  YUM!!!

Wow, is right!  This should be called Sweet, Sour, and Spicy Sauce!  Made it as written and I really enjoyed it.  I wanted to make sweet and sour smoked sausage, and this sauce worked great.  I halved the recipe and it still mad a lot.  Will definitely make again!

I want to give this recipe 5 stars but I changed it, upon recommendation of other commenters, only adding half a cup of sugar. It's sweet enough this way. I paid no heed to comments on it being too spicy, however, and with the seasoning as is, it's quite hot. I love it this way but my dad says he won't be able to eat it. Know your audience and adjust spice accordingly.

This is a great sauce. I was surprised that I had almost all the base ingredients with a few alterations. I used crushed pineapple, Heinz 57 steak sauce, and Frank's Red hot sauce instead cayenne. Made as directed and was worried that it was too much sauce add it to pork. And I was right. This makes about 4 cups of sauce. I used about 1/2 the sauce and that was a lot still. Usually I double the sauce, but this, I would have to 1/2 the recipe next time and use more pineapple juice than water.

This is one recipe that I wish I could give more than 5 stars!  Like several other reviewers said, I'll never buy commercial sweet and sour sauce again!
I made 2 small substitutions:  Since I was serving this over chicken and veggies, I used chunk pineapple instead of the bit.  And I didn't have the Cayenne sauce but did have ground cayenne, so used that instead.
My husband has not been a fan of sweet and sour dishes...but told me that THIS was good enough to serve again.  Definitely a keeper!

Wow! is the right name for this recipe!  I made it to accompany my meatballs for an appetizer at a dinner party and everybody LOVED it!  The recipe makes quite a bit and I had to get creative throughout the week to use up all the yummy sauce and ended up freezing some.  Next time I will make half the recipe.  A definite keeper!

I will use this recipe again! Just enough "kick" to cater to all tastes!  
   I didn't have pineapple with juice or distilled white vinegar once ,so I used homemade pineapple apricot jam instead ,along with white wine vinegar... It was great also!!

Was looking for a sauce that was a little more than the standard ketchup sugar and vinegar version. This sauce was a hit with the whole family. Not sure if it was the addition of the steak sauce and cayenne, but it was very tasty. I followed the recipe almost exactly except for omitting the pepper flakes. Tis will be my new go-to sweet and sour sauce from now on!! Thanks for sharing it

Perfect!  I have tried a couple recipes and this one will be my go to recipe.  I did not have steak sauce so I left it out but still turned out beautiful.

My mother-in-law is allergic to pineapple and I happened to be out of it when I first made it, so I used apple juice instead. I made it in the crockpot with ribs and another time with pork for pulled pork. The entire family raved over it and this sauce is now in my supper rotation. Another thing I did was substitute whole wheat flour for the cornstarch, since I was out of it too. I double the amount of flour though, since it doesn't seem thick enough. Wonderful recipe!!

The last ingredient I added was the sugar because it just seemed like this recipe called for a lot. I ended up adding only half the amount of sugar, because simply doesn't need all of it. It would be waaaay to sweet. I love the red pepper flakes.

I scaled the ingrediants down to 3 servings, but still had tons left over after serving with egg rolls. However, if was using this as a sauce to top veggies, meat and rice or what not, amount of sauce would be good.
I added maybe 1oz of pineapple tibits that I crushed, instead of the 4oz that were called for. Also doubled the red pepper flakes, as we like spicy stuff. 
Boiled for 5 minutes, then removed from heat. Definately cool this sauce before serving if using for egg rolls as a dipping sauce. 
My other half raved that it was better than jarred stuff.

What a gem of a recipe!!! I needed a sweet and sour sauce to go along with meatballs and rice. I was unable to find my handwritten stand by recipe, so I found this one online. (The only ingredient not added was the steak sauce as I didn't have any.)It was an instant hit with the family, I don't think I will bother searching for the old one again. I made a second double batch after supper and canned it for later use.

Very yummy! Was worried the hot sauce and pepper flakes would make it too hot but they didn’t. I put into Tibet plastic containers and will freeze.

So good! I didn't have not sauce so I used cayenne powder. No steak sauce, so I used Worcestershire sauce. Poured over kielbasa. Yummy! It makes a lot, so I froze the leftover sauce.

You can't go wrong with this!  I used a lot of leftover odds & ends - pureed tomatoes rather than ketchup & fresh pineapple chunks, so I used almost no water, because of the liquid in the tomatoes & pineapple. I needed a little more tomato so used Bloody Mary mix.  I added hot sauce to taste, used 1/3 C apple cider vinegar & 1/3 C white.  I used WAY less sugar, like a heaping 1/2 cup, Worchestershire sauce vs steak sauce, and added other things I had on hand, broccoli, zucchini, green beans & chicken pieces - it was fantastic!

If you double this recipe like I did you may not want to double the amount of Red Pepper flakes. Turned out real spicy even adding only 1.5 teaspoons . I did also use some Brown Sugar instead of all White Sugar.

Fantastic! I had some chili paste on hand instead of hot sauce... my only other substitute was rice wine vinegar for white vinegar. This was great stuff! Actually persuaded the kids to eat at home tonight instead of going out! It’s THAT GOOD!

My family loved it, but it's pretty spicy as is.  I halved the recommended amount of chili and it was still a little zestier than we are used to.  Still, we will be making this again - it was a big hit over baked pork chops!

Kind of winged it, because I wanted to make less and also wasn’t sure how much pineapple and juice was in my 20 oz pineapple can (when I only needed 8) so I used part of the pineapple chunks, all of the pineapple liquid, backed off on the water some then started guessing as to proportions of the other ingredients. I didn’t add the pepper flakes because I didn’t have any. I don’t think you can mess this up with these ingredients. It was really, really yummy!

This was very good, I used it to make sweet and sour meatballs. It's very easy to tweak to personal preference or what you have in the cupboard. 
I was able to make this in the microwave, but after stirring in the cornstarch mixture I just poured over the meatballs and cooked in the oven (covered) for 35-40 minutes. The sauce thickened up nicely!

Pineapple sweet and sour sauce is a variety of its own. I too reduced the sugar. Suggest cutting recipe in half or a quarter but then what do you do with an open can of pineapple?

No more store-bought sweet/sour sauce in this house. Recipe allows for adjustments as to levels of sweetness or sourness, but I made it exactly as written and don't plan to change a thing. The wife was equally impressed as I used it with stir fry peppers, onions, mushrooms, water chestnuts and precooked shrimp over rice.

What an incredibly perfect sweet and sour! My family absolutely loved it!

I just have one issue with the ketchup addition (not judging!). Being the cook, all I could taste was ketchup and I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions for substitution. I don't care that it's not orange in color in the end. vinegar and sugar is mostly what ketchup is, it's just the tomato part is not my friend. any suggestions are so welcome!. Again, it's just my taste, family gives it 5 stars.

All four kids ate it! Win for Dad. We actually served it over chicken nuggets on rice as kind of an intro to Asian food.

I liked this a lot. Followed it loosely, as I was low on ketchup and (rice) vinegar. I used 1 C. of sugar and no steak sauce. I had no crushed pepper flakes, but I used hot chili paste instead. It turned out really good and everyone liked it. I'll make it again and follow the recipe more next time.

This is a delicious sauce.. however I made a few changes. Used bone broth for the 2 c. of water. Sautéed 5 diced carrots, 3 stalks of diced celery, half yellow onion. And then cooked 3 chicken breasts slowly on med low in a fry pan with a little sauce and broth. It was excellent. Served with brown rice. You could sauté any vegetable.. like broccoli, sprouts. Mushrooms whatever you like.

Been looking for a good sweet and sour sauce similar to what you get in most Chinese restaurants  to use with tempura prawns, crab Rangoon  and sweet and sour pork. This one does not disappoint! 
Many flavors in this and they work really well melded together. The only change I made was using crushed pineapple as I didn't want as chunky a sauce as with pineapple chunks. 
If you are looking to make your own instead of asking for an extra container of sweet and sour sauce at your regular Chinese take out place, this is the one!

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would! It is WOWZA! Such an explosion of flavours with a kick at the end.  I’m making Hawaiian Chicken but using this as my sauce and adding broccoli, shredded carrots, bean sprouts and red and yellow sweet peppers.  So incredibly awesome.  If you want it spicier, add a few more shots of Tobasco sauce and red pepper flakes.  My favourite.

My new favorite go to sweet & sour sauce. Has a little heat (which I love) if you don’t want it very hot you may want to adjust the red pepper flakes.

Love love love! Perfect balance of sweet and tang with a subtle background heat. My family loved it. I substituted tomato paste for the ketchup both to thicken and to cut sugar/salt. I may cut the recipe in half next time or freeze half. It really is a large batch of sauce. We ended up with way too much sauce for our stir fry. I used pineapple chunks because that was what I had, and those were just too big. I think the tidbits or crushed would have been better.

This is pretty amazing!  The only change I made was reducing the hot sauce to 1/2 teaspoon instead of 1/2 tablespoon.  I figured I could add more if needed.  I think it had just enough bite using the reduced amount.  I made 4 herb-roasted pork tenderloins for a family gathering.  I sliced them and covered them with this amazing sauce.  I kept some separate to pass at the table.  Honestly, people were raving about the pork and putting the sweet and sour sauce on everything on their plates!  I will make this again and again!!

Awesome. I put more vinegar and soy in it as I prefer it more sour. I also put some ginger and garlic as well as carrot, onion and red capsicum.

I'm replacing my old recipe with this one - it's like restaurant S/S sauce! Makes more than enough for a family of 6 but it can be put in a  mason jar (with lid) in the frig and it lasts quite long. if you have "spicy averse" kids you can omit the pepper flakes and use just a squirt of sriracha sauce. I left out the steak sauce (per other reviews)  and it was perfect. The juice of a large can of chunk or sliced pineapple is about equivalent to 8 oz of tidbits. On behalf of all of us "in a rush to get dinner on the table Moms" -Thanks for posting!

So easy to make & has the authentic "Sweet & Sour" flavor. I was pleasantly surprised to have all of the ingredients but one on hand. I didn't have steak sauce but used some Worcestershire instead. After making this sauce, I left in the pan over warm heat.
I had defrosted a small pork tenderloin a couple of days prior which I cut up in slightly larger than bite sized pieces. 
Put rice on to cook.
Mixed together AP flour, cold water, salt, a beaten egg and stirred in the pork (all at once) then deep fried about 10 pieces at a time until brown.
Layered rice, deep fried tenderloin and covered with this Wow sauce. It was not  only easy, it was delicious!
There are just 2 of us.  We had plenty of sauce left over which should keep quite well in the fridge for a couple of weeks. Am thinking there are a couple of chicken breast and a small package of frozen Asian mix veggies just waiting to climb into the wok for another delicious meal over rice! Thank you for the great recipe!

This sauce is amazing! I reduced the Pepper Flakes and Hot Sauce by half as I am unable to eat spicy; but the heat really didn't need to be halved at all. Next time I make  this it will be in its entirety. It was very yummy as Sweet and Sour Chicken served over Broccoli Rice.

Very good!  I pureed mine in the blender after making, because I like a smoother sauce, and froze the extra sauce so I could use it later :)

This is an incredibly easy sauce and what I think of when I want a sweet and sour sauce.  I added homemade seitan , it would be great with tofu or any protein. Next time I will add onion and green bell pepper cut in chunks.  I was afraid there would be too much heat but it was perfect.  I put everything except the cornstarch slurry in a pot and let it simmer while I made brown rice, maybe 45 minutes.  I think that may have mellowed out the vinegar that some of the reviewers found objectionable.  I added the cornstarch at the very end.  This is versatile and a "keeper".  Thanks.

I used only 1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup of vinegar and it turned out great. The steak sauce is a brilliant balancing ingredient. Such a great sauce recipe.

I really liked it.  I'll use it again next time.  I didn't have any steak sauce, but it was still good.  I was also leery about using ketchup but I was happy with the result.

I added this delicious sauce (with only 1 c. of sugar) to my stir fried veggies and frozen meatballs,  and then simmered for about 15 - 20 minutes. Served it over rice. Perfect sweetness with a little "kick".

I make it exactly like the recipe says, but I make it in bulk and can it. Even one recipe makes a lot. I triple the recipe and get about 8 quarts. Pour it into jars, wipe the rims, put on lids which have been simmered in water, tighten down rings, and process in a boiling water bath for 30 minutes. It is awesome stuff to have in the pantry. I mix it with BBQ sauce and put it over meatballs with noodles, or use it plain over rice. I am sure you will have a favorite use for it quickly.

Omitted the red pepper flakes. My family will know I spiced it up lol. Cut fresh pineapples up and used them. Cut up sweet peppers and cooked them in with it. Added more hot sauce as needed and chopped fresh parsley and stirred it in last! Delicious!!!

Wow is right! Best sweet and sour ever - very zippy!
I used fresh pineapple, so no juice, so I added a little orange juice - but couldn't tell the difference.
Made a half recipe and turned out great - use on pecan crusted chicken on a bed of rice. Next time will try pork kabobs skewered with pineapple, onions and green pepper.

Yummy! This was easy to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I served this over pork stir fry. This will be my go-to recipe whenever I want to cook something up fast! Thanks for sharing!

DH and I loved this sauce. I made it to go with some Asian pork meatballs and oven baked rice. I made the sauce exactly to the recipe except I didn't have any steak sauce so splashed some Worcestershire into the mix for a little bite.  It was easy and quick - perfect for a mid-week dinner. Once the sauce was made I added some stir fry veggies to it to complete the meal. This is a keeper for me.

I made this today to go with my egg rolls. I love it. I do wish I had read the reviews before I made it though. I would have cut back on the sugar just a bit. I was short on pineapple by about 4 once's but went with it any way. Came out great. Will be making this again. May try it on/with a few other things.

As written, this recipe is way too sweet and way too hot for my taste. With modifications, it was delicious. I used 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup water with 1 cup pineapple juice drained from 2 medium cans of pineapple.  I left out the pepper flakes but used 1.5 tablespoons sricha. The quantity was perfect for sweet and sour chicken as I make a large batch to feed my family.

I should have been making this a long time ago. I love that I can control the amount and quality of this sauce versus buying store bought which tends to sit in the refrigerator until it is finally thrown out. I like making healthy Chinese food at home but my daughter often won't eat it without an orange or sweet and sour sauce. She doesn't like most of the store bought versions because they can be chunky so this recipe is exactly what we were looking for. I removed the pineapple tidbits after the sauce was done.

Very good!  Used this with stir fry. My hubby said it was the best he's had.  I didn't have steak sauce but I did have BBQ sauce so I used that.  Also I had leftover pineapple juice  which I used instead of pineapple tidbits. I will definitely be making again! Thanks!

This sauce was amazing. My husband called it "sublime."  The red pepper flakes give the sauce a slight kick. It makes a lot of sauce so I'm going to freeze it and use it for another meal. I'm very pleased with this recipe.

Perfect! Exactly as you get in the tester aunt and maybe even a bit better! Little tip add a dash of lemon or lime juice to the mixture will thicken in less than 5 minutes

Pretty good! It was a little thick- next time I'll probably lay off on the cornstarch a bit. It was also a little too ketchup-y for my taste, so I'll cut that down next time, too. Overall I liked the flavor, and it went well with my crab Rangoon! I'll probably be making it again!

Made this for a sweet & sour pork stir fry dish, but I cut back on the amount of red pepper flacks as I didn't want this to turn out as Kung-pow (too hot). Turned out the best I've made for a sweet & sour sauce.

Excellent flavor  & easy to make....I cut the sugar in half since the recipe already uses ketchup + pineapple....split the savory steak sauce with some Worcestershire and mixed rice wine vinegar with white vinegar....used it to top sauteed shrimp w/red pepper, bamboo shoots, carrot & onion atop garlic fried rice.  Thanks so much for this go-to sauce!!

I thought it was going to be another sweet, tomatoey failure. But after reading several of the comments I finally decided to try it. The only thing I changed was to have the hot stuff for the kids, and add a little garlic and ginger. This is a great sauce!  I have finally found my go-to sweet and sour sauce!

I made this the first time the other day.  I used it to make Sweet & Sour Chicken.  It was easy to make and tasted great.  My wife like it too. She thought it was a little to sweet but I thought it was just right.  I plan to make it again for a dinner party.   The only suggestion I have is to make it once by the recipe then adjust as you and your family desire.

Loved it with modifications.   3/4 c. Sugar, Worcestershire  instead of steak sauce, 3/4 c. Ketchup, 3/4 c. Fresh pineapple puree.   Next time I will add less dried peppers (mine are HOT).   Served over chunked grilled chicken, grilled bell pepper, onions and pineapple and rice.    Will definitely make again!

Made as written.  Awesome sauce with just enough "heat".  Definitely will make this again.  I made white rice, stir fry veggies and took two chicken breasts and made thin slices of chicken.  Dipped chicken in egg wash and then tumbled slices in plastic bag with cornstarch and a little salt.  Browned the chicken in a couple of tbls of canola oil .  Microwaved the stir fry veggies and steamed the rice.  Plated chicken with veggies and served sauce and rice separate.   Fixed our dishes to our personal taste with all the ingredients.  Absolutely delicious!

I thought this was ok, but it seemed pretty ketchup-y to me.  After making it as written (other than halving the recipe, since i saw it would make way more than i needed), I thought it needed a little something and added two cloves of garlic.  To my taste, that helped a bit flavour-wise.  I would probably use less ketchup next time and still add the garlic.  All in all, it was ok as a base recipe, but i think this one is best to taste as you go and tailor it to suit.

What an amazing sauce to make for a cold Winter's night!  The whole house smells delicious.  I made two small changes - 1 cup of sugar, not 1 1/2 (used brown sugar not white) and a 16 oz can of pineapple not 8 ( reduced the water 1/3 a cup to compensate.  Definitely will make again and I saved the extra in pint jars to use for pork this coming weekend.

We love this recipe! Our 13 year old nephew is getting into cooking and asked if we could make chicken nuggets and fries. We made this sauce when he asked we could buy some sweet and sour sauce (the horror!!). He looked very surprised when I said we'd make our own. Caution: THIS MAKES A LOT!! I substituted worchestershire cause for the steak sauce (don't use it) and decreased the sugar to a little less than a cup. It was perfect as a dipping sauce and I'm using the leftover sauce for sweet and sour chicken and rice tonight for dinner. Great recipe!

I am very new at cooking for guests.  Tried this recipe for my very first dinner.  Used it as sauce for a Sweet & Sour Chicken recipe.  Only change was 1 cup of sugar instead of 1.5 cups.  My guests loved it.

Wow is an apt description of this sauce even though I made a few changes to suit my family's taste.   I started by making only half the recipe.  so keep in mind these change would need to be doubled for the full recipe.   I decreased the water to 3/4  cup because I  used 2/3 cup pineapple juice in place of the pineapple tidbits.  I also did not add the red pepper flakes and hot pepper sauce.  The sauce was very similar to the "Polynesian Sauce" my granddaughter likes on chicken.  Next time I make it,  I'll make the full recipe with  the pineapple tidbits to add a little texture to the sauce.  I would never think of using ketchup in a sweet and sour sauce but it works.

Awesome flavor!  I blended the pineapple in my small food processor instead of having the tidbits.  Not spicy at all to my family.  I'm glad it makes so much, I will put some in fridge for leftovers and freeze the rest for another time.  Thanks for the "keeper"!

Reading the reviews I left out 1/2 cup sugar but added it at the end, I felt it needed it to balance the sweet vrs sour taste. It is the best Sweet and Sour sauce I have ever had and the color was very good. After dinner I emailed it to everyone I know. Would not change the recipe at all.

If your looking for the sweet and sour sauce found in every mom and pop take out, this is the one to try.  This recipe makes a lot.  I put the leftovers into a clean pickle jar and it kept nice on the fridge door for 2 weeks until I used it.

Hands down best sweet and sour sauce we have had! Easy easy to make ( had everything on hand!) literally ran to my phone when I realized I didnt have ranch for the kids chicken nuggets made this by the time theirs were done. They loved it! Was able to take the rest of the sauce and can it for another time.

This simple and easy recipe turned out to be better than I had thought it was. I substituted the cornstarch for all purpose flour. The flour did a really good job of substituting the cornstarch. I would definitely recommend this recipe for anyone that wants a simple sweet and sour sauce recipe.

Keeper recipe. I substituted Worcestershire sauce. I used both pepper flakes and hot sauce and it was the perfect amount of heat.

This was amazing! I cut the recipe in half and still had way more than I needed! I will certainly be making this again! My only major changes is that I would do a dash of red pepper flakes next time(and I like it spicy, but it was too spicy for me). I ended up putting a bit of Vanilla Almond milk in the batch to bring down the heat. I also used Rice Vinegar instead of the white distilled vinegar. I also measured the cornstarch out and put a tiny bit of COLD water and mixed it till smooth then added directly to the batch of sauce on the stove (this makes it so you avoid any clumping of the cornstarch).  This recipe was a total hit!

This was great! I'll never buy store bought S&S again! I used fresh pineapple and didn't add any steak sauce, but other than that I followed the directions to the letter. Easily a family favorite!

My husband and I had this with Fried Rice I and enjoyed it. If I make this again, I will add less ketchup. The flavor of the sauce was good but I could definitely taste the ketchup in it.

This was really good and easy to adjust for your personal taste.  I would have preferred it to be a little thicker so next time I will add more cornstarch.  Also, this made A LOT.  My family of four has now used it for two meals and we still have a large amount left.  This will definitely be my go-to recipe for sweet and sour sauce from now on.

I was trying to make this gluten free so I left out the soy sauce, steak sauce, and cayenne pepper sauce.   It was still a wonderful sauce and there was plenty of it!   Loved it and will definitely make it again.  Thanks!

Perfect! It was just what I was looking for. I had to sub in crushed pineapple and worcestershire sauce instead of steak sauce since didn't know I was out of it until I started cooking which is funny b/c I didn't know I was out of store bought sweet and sour sauce until the lumpia was cooked! It was quick and easy and of course delish~!
 Thank you for the recipe.

It is the BEST! Does not need to  add or take any thing away. After all it is Sweet and Sour Sauce. Maybe less pepper for the kids. This will be my only recipe. Thank you.

Excellent!  I made this to accompany some Spring Rolls I made from this site.  Rave reviews from everyone who tried the combo.  I added a little more red pepper flakes because we are more of a fan of spicy than we are of sweet ....   I kept leftovers and made sweet and sour pork a couple of days later.  Yum!

Pretty close, it worked as a dipping sauce for the crab rangoon I made tonight... it was a little spicy in comparison to restaurant versions, so I'll tone it down with the crushed red pepper next time... I used less than specified and it was still too spicy... i also had to use more cornstarch, and I think it could have used more vinegar or something, but it's probably my own fault for substituting straight pineapple juice instead of the tidbits! Any which way, I bookmarked this and will try it again, after I use up the vat of sauce I have leftover! ;)

I just used the juice rather than the pineapple tidbits as I didn't want the lumps.  I made a mistake and used cayenne pepper powder rather than the hot sauce so it was a tad on the hot side, but compared to the sugary restaurant version, this is delicious! I am pretty sure I will be putting it on everything. Thanks for the recipe.

I tried this recipe and it was a big hit in our family! I made a few adjustments...I halved it as it made plenty and we still had leftovers...and I ommitted the pineapple and steak sauce as I didn't want pineapple bits in my sauce and didn't have any steak sauce on hand. Even without those ingredients, it was the best we have ever had. I will never be buying sauce again. The ketchup and sugar gave it the sweet, the vinegar gave it the sour, and the red pepper flakes and cayenne gave it the spicy kick and zing to each bite. Amazing!

The recipe is wonderful. I used it with lots of added bits of browned pork stew meat and served over rice. Everyone had seconds and saved none for tomorrow! I changed the recipe some by using less of some ingredients as to what the family likes or doesn't like. I have also used with chunks of Chicken. It Was Very tasty!

WOW, WOW and WOW!  I made this super sauce last night and everyone was unanimous - a definite keeper. The only ingredient  I omitted was the steak sauce. My daughter is somewhat picky about new recipes I try but this one is a winner. Thanks for sharing it

So yummy!!!! I didn't put in cayenne or steak sauce... and halved the red pepper flakes.  But that's just because I don't like spicy.  But it turned out perfect!

Sooo good!!! I didn't add the red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper hot sauce or the steak sauce so it was more sweet than sour, which I love!!! Put it over rice and meatballs, don't think i'll use any other sweet and sour sauce ever again!

This was the first time I have made Sweet and Sour Sauce!  This turned out VERY YUMYMY!  I will make it again!  Very quick and simple!  I doubled the recipe and made it with out the spicy stuff.  Then split the pot in half and added the spicy to one pot.  It was hard to decide if I wanted spicy or none.  Highly recommend this recipe!
