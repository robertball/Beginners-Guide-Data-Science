Recipe is to die for! I had a friend make it for me and I had to make it again only 4 days later...and I still want to make it again! Only changes were: used Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom Soup and 1 lb of chicken breast diced and sauteed. Used 3/4 package angelhair pasta. Was amazing!

I used this recipe as a starting off point; added in fresh red bell pepper, jalapenos, garlic and onion. I used asian noodles this time, but I'm thinking this would also be awesome with steamed rice.

This was edible, but I found the sauce had a weird twang to it and the coleslaw was strange.  Would probably just use my usual mix of stir-fry veggies next time and play around with the sauce.  My hubby liked it as is though.

So delicious! I am a freak for peanut sauces and this one is very very good! My cream of mushroom soup also didn't have the garlic, and I omitted the lime juice because I am allergic, and also forgot the red peppers, but it was so delicious anyways. I cooked the chicken breast right before, and added the chicken and vermicelli noodles to the pan after the sauce boiled and heated it through (because the vermicelli noodles were rinsed in cold water) and just added the coleslaw right before serving because I didn't want it to get mushy (I like crispy/crunchy texture). Yum, thanks for sharing!

This was delicious. I only had two large chicken breasts, so I cut them into strips and browned them with some olive oil, salt  garlic powder, black pepper and soy sauce. My Cream of Mushroom soup didn't have Roasted Garlic, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. My family was impressed, and I was too. I will use this recipe again and again.

This recipe came out very thick for me, I had to add 1 cup of liquid to thin it out. And then there was to much of it. I didn't use the coleslaw mix, it's not something I like. But it tasted fine, and was a bit better when I added srirachi sauce. It works very well on spaghetti, but is a bit strange on rice

Delicous!  I was skeptical of the Cream of Mushroom soup in the sauce, and was delighted with the outcome.  Recipe as is a perfect.  Any type of noodle can be used, I used spirals because that's what I had in the cupboard.  I look forward to making this again.

I made this recipe exactly as directed, and my family of 6 and I absolutely LOVED IT. Even the preschooler was asking for more (enough said, huh?) I'm usually hesitant to use a recipe with condensed soup, but this meal really was amazing and did NOT taste like your typical cooking-with-soup sort of dish. While it was a kid pleaser, it also managed to feel pretty darn fancy. Even better, it went together very easily. The time and serving estimates really are spot on. We're definitely going to make this a favorite in our normal meal rotation!

Excellent!!  The sauce was a little thick, but the flavor was FANTASTIC.  I only added about half the noodles right away, then added coleslaw, peanuts & cilantro right before serving.  Yum yum.  My hubby loved it too!

It is delicious!  I made it for two of my women friends and myself and we all loved it.  I did two things differently: I cut my own cabbage and shredded some carrot instead of the coleslaw mix and I used oven roasted chicken cut in strips. It reminds me of Pad Thai which my son's family loves.  I forwarded the recipe to him because it is delicious and he can easily make it for his family after he comes home from work. It does come together in 30 minutes which is great for busy families.

I just finished eating this and it is so tasty. We are on a low cholesterol, low saturated fat diet and this is perfect. I only gave it 4 stars because I made a few alterations. I sliced two chicken breasts, seasoned them with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder, then sauteed them in a little olive oil and soy sauce. I also used wide rice noodles instead of the vermicelli, forgot to add the brown sugar, used sriracha sauce in place of the red pepper and added the slaw at the very end along with a couple of tablespoons of chicken broth to thin it out just a little. My husband and I both loved it. This is definitely going in the "keeper" file. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

I loved this recipe.  I didn't have the soup on hand so I used a mixture of cream, chopped mushrooms and fresh garlic.  It turned out really well.

I had high hopes for this recipe, but honestly I think it's gross.  I made the recipe as written except I left out the cilantro leaves.

This was really good. At first taste before the chicken and cabbage where added I was a little worried about the strong Lime flavor. As one put it,"it was a little off". But after making this my own by adding garlic, green onions and green and red peppers, the flavors all blended really well and everyone loved it. Like everyone else I did have to add about a cup of the water that I boiled the chicken and then cooked the noodles in. It gave it a nice smooth taste. 
Next time I'll grill chicken breast whole and use the noodles and veggies as a side dish.

We just put our plates down and I for one loved this dish! I used a few (heavy) squirts of sriracha instead of the red pepper flakes. 
I also cooked my chicken strips in coconut oil after I dipped them in egg & milk and dredged them through a crushed peanut/bread crumb mix (heavy on the crushed peanuts). This is definitely a keeper.

Sauce was very thick. I added water to it to thin it down and that helped. Everyone at the table enjoyed the meal. Served with salad and a baguette. I'd make this again.
