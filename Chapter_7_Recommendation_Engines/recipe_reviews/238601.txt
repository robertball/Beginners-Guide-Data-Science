Wow!! I used creme fraiche but had to make my own chipotle in adobo sauce and used more than two, just tasting as I went so I don't know how many ended up in there in the end. I made it before going to bed and ate it on some breakfast burritos the next morning and the flavours, after sitting in the fridge, were more bold. I suggest making it ahead of time. Definitely an addition to any Tex-Mex table. Thanks for the recipe.

Perfect! The only change I would make is to add more chipotle as stated in the recipe. This worked great as a topper on our chicken fajitas. As a matter of preference I used sour cream in place of the creme fraiche.
