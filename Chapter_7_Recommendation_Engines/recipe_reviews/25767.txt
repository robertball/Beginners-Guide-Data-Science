I'm giving this recipie 5 stars with the modifications I made. I substituted 1/4 c. of the butter with shortening and also added 1 egg yolk. I also found that rolling them out just a bit thicker than 1/8'', baking them for 7 minutes and using parchment paper kept them from breaking apart. I ended up with cookies that were SO CHOCOLATEY WONDERFUL and tasted a lot like brownies. They were gorgeous with the "sugar cookie icing" recipie from this site.

Instead of using flour when cutting out shapes, use cocoa powder! That way you cant see the flour after baking.

These turned out great with modifications.  I followed advice of other reviewers and added:
1t. vanilla, 1/2 t. cinnamon and an extra egg yolk.  I also rolled them out a little thicker than the recipe called for.  I did not refrigerate the dough at all and the dough was fine - even with my young kids making the cut-out cookies.  We will make these again for something different.

I made a double version of this recipe for my sons Halloween party at school. They were not only absolutely fabulous, but also DELICIOUS! It's like mini brownie cookies with a crisp yummy texture.

This recipe would be great for anyone, even people who are novice.

Well, after all these wonderful reviews, I have to wonder why this recipe doesn't work for me.  I bake a lot and have tried this recipe three times now, and every time, the cookies fall apart either when they're being removed from the cookie sheet or when they're being handled as I frost/decorate them.  They taste good--very rich--, roll out easily, and cut easily, but it's Cookie Crumb City from then on.  'Disappointing.

I liked this cookie! It had a really good chocolate flavor but not too sweet. It was simple to make, too. I skipped the cutout part (too time consuming) and just formed the dough into two logs about 2-3 inches wide. When it was chilled I sliced it into 1/8" slices. I baked it on parchment for about 9 minutes. These would be perfect with coffee or to make your own ice cream sandwiches. Thanks!

This is a great recipe and I will make it again. I had no problem with the consistency of the dough and followed the recipe to a T. Make sure you use only room temp softened butter, measure the exact amount of ingredients (no eyeballing it) and chill the dough for 2 hours. TIP! Cover the dough in wax paper in the fridge during chilling. After you pull it out, roll it between 2 sheets of wax paper. You have no issues with sticking, flour doesn't mar the pretty brown dough. 

Thanks for sharing your Grandmother's recipe! She was a great cook!!

These cookies were very tasty! I liked them a bit thicker and soft and my boyfriend liked them a little crispier. Either way they were even better when we drizzled them with melted white chocolate chips, caramel and a good chocolate bar with nuts in it! It was like eating a really gooey brownie, but easier to manage!

We LOVED this cookie recipe!  I made them for Valentine's Day this week, icing them with an almond-flavored confectionary glaze in pink and white.  They were very pretty--but, more importantly, very yummy!  I love sugar cookies, so these were right up my alley.  I think my kids still prefer traditional sugar cookies, but they enjoyed these too.  Recipe was very simple and the cookies really kept their shape nicely.  Thanks!

Make Mine Mexican Chocolate!  My favorite version combines many of tips provided by others- subs. 1/4C butter for shortening; add in one egg yolk & 1 tsp vanilla to wet ingredients; added 3/4 tsp cinnamon and a dash of red pepper to the dry ingredients.  Found that I needed to chill the dough- in fact found it rolled out better when not chilled.  When rolling, used 1 part cocoa powder and 2 parts flour- rolls great and doesn't dusty up the finished cookies or leave a film like straight cocoa.

WOW, What great chocolate flavor!! My kids loved them! They are very easy to make!! Simple ingredients. Let the dough warm up a little after refridgerating its easier to roll and use flour to roll them on, they come up easy with a spatula after you roll them to transfer them to your cookie sheet. Yummy, these didnt last long!!

These turned out pretty good- really rich and chocolately.  However, I did follow others' advice and added a teaspoon of vanilla and an extra egg.  I ended up making them a bit thicker as well.  Good for bigger stencils but fell apart in any shapes that had littler pieces (like with Rudolph's antlers).

These cookies were delightful - I let them cool and sifted powdered sugar on top, which added just the right amount of sweetness.  I was in a time crunch, so I didn't refrigerate, but I was still able to roll out and use cookie cutters without a hitch!  Roll out thicker and store in a sealed container for chewy cookies; thinner and store uncovered for crisp ones.

Wonderful recipe. I added a capful of vanilla and chilled the dough overnight. The dough is BEAUTIFUL, and rolled out like fondant. Thicker cookies came out soft and chewy; thinner came out crisp--BOTH thick and thin have a wonderful chocolate-y flavor and are delicious! Thanks for sharing this great recipe :)

Great cookies! For everyone complaining of crumbly cookies, you have to be smarter than the dough. I refrigerated mine overnight, and let it sit about 10 minutes before rolling it out. I like to roll out dough on a mat or on parchment paper or plastic wrap taped to the counter. It works wonders. Don't bake the cookies more than about 8 minutes, or they will dry out. I made a batch of these as Valentine gifts, and decorated them with royal icing. SO beautiful and delicious!

Wow, what a cookie.  Easy to make, easy to roll and cut.  They taste like a thin brownie, soft and delicious.  My son had a horse/cowboy birthday party this year, and I was looking for a chocolate recipe so the horse head cutout cookies could be already brown and not need to frost them!  I just added a brown mini-m&m eye and they looked and tasted perfect!   My son the cowboy and I thank you for a great recipe!!!!  I'm sure to use it for several upcoming occasions.

I made heart cut-outs for my 5th grade son's class Valentine's Day party.  Dough was easy to work with and cookies were a hit!  I rolled my dough out between two layers of parchment and baked the cut-out shapes right on the parchment--works great, doesn't add extra flour to the dough and no flour mess to clean up!

These were by far the best cutout cookies I've had, and i give them 5 stars the way i made them. I made them thicker than the recipe calls for and only cooked them for 6 minutes and they came out nice and chewy like a brownie. I'm also a vegan so i used 1/4 cup blended tofu instead of egg and margarine instead of butter and they turned out great, i gave them to my boyfriend in the shape of hearts, he loves them too :)

Such a great, easy recipe for something a little different! I add 1 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and an extra egg yolk but other than that stick with the recipe. I ended of chilling my dough longer than planned (3hrs) because my 1 year old wasn't in the mood to share my focus but I think it helped in the long run. When rolling out dough use more cocoa powder instead of flour so you don't ruin the look with white baked on flour and roll out between sheets of parchment paper for the easiest experience. DON'T overbake! these turn out great, like a brownie flavored sugar cookie!

Went with an additional whole egg and added some more spices - it was soft, but after refrigerating it overnight it worked out well. Delicious.

Super delicious and unbelievably easy! The dough seemed a little on the dry side but they turned out perfect.  I don't like my cookies overly sweet, so I cut down the sugar to 1 cup and it was just right.

I followed this recipe to a T and it worked out very well.  4 stars because I would like to add more cocoa next time.  I used parchment paper to bake and to roll out with great success.   I rolled rather thickly (for me, anyway)...at least 1/8" and the recipe yielded 24 3-1/2" hearts.  Not much spreading at all.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These cookies were yummy and tasted better as they got a little older.  For a bit of variation, sprinkle equal proportions of cinnamon, ground cloves, brown sugar and ground almonds on top of some of the cookies to make spiced chocolate cookies.

This is my go-to recipe for rolled chocolate cookies.  As per other reviewers, I add a tsp of vanilla, occasionally add an extra egg yolk if I'm baking other stuff that'll use the white, and I always roll the dough out on cocoa powder.

For cocoa, I use about half Hershey's Special Dark (which is a blend of regular and Dutch) and half regular.  This makes the cookies very dark, which offsets the sweetness of royal icing decorations very nicely.

I also roll them with my 1/4" guides and bake for 8 minutes.

Delicious, very chocolatey cookies. I add 1/4t cinnamon and 1/8t cayenne--it doesn't make the cookies spicy, but elevates the other flavors. 

The dough is very easy to work with just hand-rolling it into logs and chopping off rounds. With cookies about 1in x 3/16in and a bit more baking time (12-15min.), you get a wonderful texture, al dente on the outside and soft when you bite in. I roll the logs and toss each cookie in a 2/2/1 mix of flour, cocoa and sugar. 

I don't refrigerate the dough, but often pause to turn on the oven and wash some dishes or just take a break after the logs are rolled out, before I chop them up. My sifting method is a quart bell jar and a butter knife :) I mix the dry ingredients in the jar, 'sift' them gradually to another container with the knife, play whack-a-mole with any visible clumps, and it all gets sifted again going into the dough. It's quicker and more effective than a colander.

I'll put my complete recipe up on my blog, Flavors of Daylight.

The flavor of this cookie is wonderful. They remind of a crisp brownie. The dough was a bit crumbly and kept pulling up with the rolling pin, had to use a good dusting of cocoa powder. I would recomend rolling dough out on parchment paper, cut out shapes, then remove excess dough to prevent cookies from falling apart during tranfer to a baking sheet.

The dough was far too dry! I tried to add a bit more butter after it was all mixed together - that was hard. I only used 1 cup of sugar and it was sweet enough. I just wanted a chocolate sugar cookie recipe to make "Tiny Teddies" and essentially that's what I got. 
Tastes good and that is what matters most.
Next time I will add vanilla & a 2nd egg

The taste is definitely awesome and extra chocolatey. It was initially very gooey and sticky, so I had a hard time getting it out of the mixing bowl, so I added some more flour and after  chilling I could roll it out just fine between two sheets of parchment paper so I got no more extra flour added in. The baked cookies do break easily unless you roll them thicker and let them cool a bit first before lifting them off the cookie sheet. They held their shape beautifully so the dough works fine with complex cutters. However, they are not strong enough to withstand covering the entire surface with royal icing, in fact you don't need it.  I did add vanilla and people kept saying they tasted like brownies. This one is definitely making it into my cookie recipe box. It gets five stars.

we followed the recipe to a T and found it to be bland.  My kids will eat one every once in a while, but I will not be making them again....not every recipe is for everyone :)

I have made these several times now and each time have been asked for the recipe. They are very chocolatety and delicious! My tips: don't make them too thin or they get overdone easy. Also, when making the cutouts, instead of using flour on your work surface, use cocoa powder. Your cookies will look even and chocolatey instead of having flour residue.

These cookies taste amazing!  While the dough is a little tough to work with at first, adding enough flour when rolling out the dough solved all of my problems.  I made the cookies a little thicker than suggested and used a heart shaped cookie cutter.  After that, I decorated them with icing.  Perfect for Valentine's Day!

Easy to work with and really yummy too. My five year old had a great time cutting them out. Thanks for a great recipe! The only thing I did different was to add a teaspoon of vanilla along with the egg.

Not sure what caused difficulty for others.  I loved the texture of this dough!  We rolled (using a heavy dusting of cocoa instead of flour) to about 1/4 to 1/2 inch and cut using 3 inch cutters.  Baked for 8 minutes and they were perfect!  Loved the "crisp brownie" texture.  Also am using this as my "gift cookie" for work colleagues.  Using 6 inch tree and snowflake cutters and then decorating with royal icing.  
P.S.  Aren't grandma's recipes the best??

These cookies are really tasty and chocolaty. I added a teaspoon of vanilla when I added the egg to the creamed butter and sugar, and a half teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients. I rolled them about 1/8" thick as the recipe states, and the cookies came out crispy when cooled, kind of like a chocoate wafer cookie.

Followed other cook's suggestion of adding 1 tsp vanilla and 1 egg yolk.  Rolled dough out to 1/4 inch thick & baked on parchment.  Cookies are great!!!

These were terrific: easy to make and very tasty. I used this recipe rather than gingerbread (which hardly anyone wants to eat) to make the moose cookies I bake every year. Now they're chocolate moose cookies which makes them even better!

For flavor, I give this recipe 5 stars.  Unfortunately, like other reviewers, I had an issue with most of them breaking apart while getting them off the pan.  Even still, the flavor was so good that I will make them again.

We used this recipe as a part of a school project:  DS had to make a 3-D model of something from the book Fahrenheit 451- he chose a phoenix.
This cookie dough was perfect- we made the base of the display, the back of the phoenix and the decorative front from this dough. (used chocolate royal icing to glue it all together on the sugar cookie background for contrast)
Not only has it held up so far, I tasted one of the scraps and it's really yummy too!
I'll be making some REAL cookies from this soon- easy recipe (DS made it all himself) and delicious!

I followed others' recommendations and added the vanilla and extra egg yolk. I rolled them out between two sheets of waxed paper, so I didn't need to use extra flour or cocoa powder. They taste really good, and my only complaint is that they break apart super-easy. I was planning to decorate them for friends and I've already lost three to breakage.

Disaster! The cookies started perfectly doughy, i cut them into 1/8inch thick stars with my cookie cutter, and placed them in the oven for 6 minutes. I check them later and they are one giant wafer-thin bubbly cookie. They tasted good, but they were crazy! The butter in the cookies melted and 'boiled' the cookies! These were NOTHING like the picture!

These are pretty good.  They taste similar to a thin brownie. Used the recipe to make bumble bee "B" cookies for preschoolers, and they turned out really cute!

Awesome cookies! They taste just like brownies, but they look so very pretty! These will become a staple in our home from now on! Everybody loved them! How did we do it: we added vanilla and cinnamon, as other reviewers suggested and rolled them just a bit thicker. They didn't break as long as they stayed flat. They are fragile though, not hard as the white sugar cookies I have tried so far, but who cares?.... They disappear so very quickly, nobody notices the head of the snowman broke of... No crumbling though, whatsoever! I don't know why other reviewers had that problem. Ours came out perfect!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

These were awesome! So tasty! They are like very rich brownie-cookies. I used Special Dark cocoa powder which made them darker in color and they had a dark chocolate taste.  I had no trouble with the dough being crumbly. It mixed up very well and once it was chilled, it was easy to work with. I used cocoa powder instead of flour to roll these out and that worked nicely and the cookies looked neater with no white streaks. I did notice that if you make the cut outs too thick, they are more apt to break. I baked these for 8 or 9 minutes, then let them cool on the sheet for 5 minutes. I drizzled them with red and green confectioners glaze for christmas and it was very striking against the almost black cookies. The only change I made to the recipe was to add 1 tsp. of vanilla to the dough. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - it will become a regular for me!

This is a great soft cookie, easy to make, the hardest part was waiting a little over an hour for them in the fridge, they are a easy cookie to break apart but I found that taking one stick of butter straight from fridge and microwaving fo 12 sec made it soft enough to use and adding 1/4 cp shortning made the doug easy to roll even without puttng in fridge, also to make sure you don't break them leave them on cookie shet for about 5 min they harden  enough to take out with spatula, and for a nice topper just use about 1cup of powder sugar mixed with 2 and 1/2 table spoons of milk, just stir mixure, and put in ziplock bag with small hole and decorate your cookies, its best to let them set out for about 4min an th frostng will harden up

Perhaps I am a rookie, but I find this cookie recipe very crumbly, anyone have any tips?  I had to leave the dough in the fridge overnight and used the microwave to soften them a bit...  The crumbs are tastey....

Made as directed.  Chilled for 3-1/2 hours in the freezer.  Dough was incredibly sticky.  I rolled 1/4 of the dough out and cut with cutters dipped in cocoa powder -all looked well until I tried to transfer to cookie sheet.  They were completely stuck to my parchment paper.  I ended up making drop cookies out of these and baking them longer than directed because they were much thicker.  I will not try this recipe again for cut-outs.

The batter never worked for me.  I tried it by the letter, and it was just too sticky to roll, even after being in the fridge for 4 hours.  I then tried it again with some of the suggestions in the comments, and still too sticky/mushy to turn into cookies.

I thought this cookie was a nice change!  I did add a splash of vanilla though.  My girls had a great time decorating these for Halloween!  I followed the suggestion of rolling the dough out between wax paper.  I also put the dough and wax paper in the fridge for a few minutes after we used cookie cutters to firm back up enough so they wouldnt break when trying to transfer them to the cookie sheet.  Worked great!

I made this as directed, but added butter flavoring.  Things got busy, so the dough was in the fridge over the weekend.  warmed up on the counter, rolled out with wax paper (no flour or powdered sugar). baked 8 min. at 350, nice and soft with good chocolate flavor.

These are a great adult chocolate cookie.  My kids didn't think they were sweet enough.  I did have to kneed about 3 TBS. of flour in order to stiffen up the dough enough to make cut out cookies.  I thought they had a nice chocolate flavor and were tasty with a peanutbutter cream sandwiched between them.

Wow these cookies are awesome. The chocolate taste is amazing! Really flavorful!! I only refrigerated the dough for 1/2 for if you do it too long it gets crumbly. My kids ate the entire batch in one day! I cant wait to make these for Christmas!! You really have a great recipe here Krista- Great job to your Grandmother!! Yum!!

I have been looking for a chocolate cut out for a while and finally found one. I wanted to make these to see how mine came out after reading some of the reviews. Some people had problems with them sticking and others had no problems. Mine did not stick, i had no problems with the recipe at all. I did line the cookie sheet with parchment paper to be safe and i did not refrigerate the dough.  Other than that i followed the recipe exactly and my dough was not sticky at all, i didnt even really need to dust with extra cocoa powder. Tastes wonderful, just like a brownie. I just hope they will not crumble and fall apart during storage. If they last that long. YUM

I'm mostly giving this 4 stars just based on the taste of the cookie.  The dough was way too crumbly for rolling out and cutting with cookie cutters.  However, what I did was refrigerate the dough in logs and once set, I sliced the roll into approximately 1/2 inch slices and baked them that way.  I dipped some of them in melted white chocolate.  The taste of these cookies is great and I think it even gets better a few days after they've been baked.  I got compliments from everyone who tried these cookies.  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks!

This is very chocolatey but I too had the crumbling problem another reviewer described. Maybe it was becaused I used shortening instead of butter? I found that the dough looked great to use once I made it but followed the directions and put it in the fridge for 2 hours. I think I should have used it right away instead. I added a little water to the dough to get it pliable again and heavily doused my rolling surface with cocoa. Usinga spatula to remove the cut outs solved the crumbling problem and the baked very nicely in exactly 8 minutes. I think I will try this recipe again but not refrigeratethe dough because I like the intensity of the chocolate flavor and the cut-outs etained their shape perfectly after baking.

Great taste; very chocolate-y (one friend said these tasted almost like dark chocolate, the chocolate flavor was so strong). The dough got very hard when I chilled it, which made it difficult to roll out the cookies. Next time, I won't chill dough as long. I cut mine thicker because of the rollout difficulty. They were great warm from the oven but got a little hard later on.... I like a softer cookie, so I wrapped them in moist paper towels and then microwaved for 10 seconds or so to bring them back to that "fresh from the oven" softness.

This is my favorite chocolate cutout cookie recipe.  I make these every valentine's day: heart-shaped sandwiches with pink icing in the middle.  They have a great chocolatey flavor without being too sweet.
I use "sugar cookie icing" for my pink icing with these.  Yum!

Very easy to work with and the cookies came out sturdy but still chewy.  I think I baked mine for a bit longer because I wanted to ensure a sturdier cookie since I was going to be using it as a cake topper.  These do taste like a crunchy/chewy brownie.

12/2013 I will be making this recipe again and again. I wanted a chocolate cut out dough to make reindeer cookies with. This recipe is perfect. The only change I made was to use 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup margarine so it would be a little more budget friendly. If you like dark chocolate, you will like this cookie. Update 12/2015: I added 1/2 tsp. mint extract to the cookie dough this year and the result was marvelous. Note: I use parchment paper to line my baking sheets because I can slide the  whole sheet of parchment paper with the hot, baked cookies onto the cooling rack with out trying to use a spatula. :D

Easy and delicious. Love the brownie flavor. Only change was to skip the chill and instead roll out on a cold marble slab. Oh, and sometimes use butter flavor Crisco instead of butter.
Dough was a breeze to work with. Rolled and cut out easily with no crumbling or breaking. Held its shape well. I use it for the Wilton 3D cookie Christmas tree (photo uploaded).

I used vanilla as other reviewers suggested.  The dough was crumbly, but once I kneaded it a little it rolled out fine no problem.  I used this recipe to make graduation cookie pops and uploaded a photo to the gallery.  It worked so well and I was happy with the result.

Very chocolatey, chewy browny like cookie! I made this recipe as is, but I decided to add 1 tsp. of vanilla extract for a more aromatic cookie. I didn't want the cookies to taste too much like flour, because I've had bad experiences in the past with cut out cookies tasting like flour. SO! intead rolled the dough between 2 sheets of waxed paper and this made a non-floury tasting cookie and also kept them from sticking to the surface. This cookie recipe would definately make great Ice cream sandwiches. Fill them with vanilla Ice cream and roll in chocolate chips or nuts, Yum! The only thing I would change next time is intead of adding 3/4 c. of coco powder, only add 2/3 c. They are a bit to bitter for my likeing. All in all a good chocolate cut out cookie! Thanks for sharing!

Amazing Cookies!  Used advice about adding an extra egg yolk, and we used cocoa powder rather than flour when rolling out dough and using the cookie cutters.  GREAT FLAVOR!

I was testing a few different chocolate rollout sugar cookies and these were by far the best. So chocolatey, didn't lose their shape, and chewy in the middle.  I followed recommendations and added an egg yolk. I rolled them out to 1/4" thick and baked for 9 min for smaller shapes and 11 min for larger shapes. Took them to a cookie swap with peanut butter icing and won!

Tasted ok, but far too dry to roll.  I could have worked with it however I never would have gotten out of it the # of cookies I required, so I rolled them into balls.  I'll stick with my regular cookie recipe.

These were amazing!  In the past I usually have trouble with cookie cutter type cookies,  however these were great.  I never had trouble with the rolling and they never fell apart at any point even after they were baked.  They tasted great and they still had a slightly soft texture, which I preferred.  I highly recommend these.

People did ask for this recipe when I made them!  They taste like brownies but in a cookie... SO good! I made some 2 inch wide heart shapes for a friend's wedding shower - they were a big hit as you could pop a whole one in your mouth ;)  Thank you for sharing!

They were a hit at the New Year's party I brought them to. I found the dough difficult to roll out after taking it out of the fridge, and the cut-outs fell apart if I wasn't very careful when moving them, even though I rolled them thicker than instructed. Overall they turned out really well!

If I could give this recipe no stars, I would.  The dough was crumbly even after chilling.  It had the consistency of slightly wet sand and could not be rolled or even shaped into a log as other reviewers suggested.

Wow! The dough was really easy to work with--not sticky at all once it was chilled--and my whole family loved these! They baked up nice and flat, but soft (when I only rolled them out to 1/4")--perfect for ice cream sandwiches. Definitely a keeper!

This was okay. I was a bit dissapointed by the results. My first batch I cooked exactly as it said, and they ended up being slightly burnt. My second batch I cooked for 6 minutes, then only left on the tray for four, and they were much better. I might make these again, but I'll probably just stick with my regular sugar cookie recipe. UPDATE: Okay, maybe  spoke too soon... The next day, the cookies had softened up and were chewy and much tastier.  Still not my favorite cookie, but much better than I initially thought.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY, and the cookies completely crumbled. Really disappointed, but the scraps tasted good.

I rolled them a bit thicker and only baked for about 7 min and this was enough time.  The cookies came out very soft, tasted good, and stayed together well.  I think maybe this would be better with frosting or icing but something about the plain cookie just wasn't totally cutting it for me... although it did kind of taste like a thin brownie...which is pretty awesome!

I loved this recipe. It almost taste like a brownie. I am starting to make cookies for special events with royal icing decorations and this recipe was a nice change from the classic sugar cookie. Not sure why some people were saying the dough was sticky, I let mine chill for 3 hours and it was PERFECT!

This recipe is awesome. It is not at all sticky like many others I have tried. The trick to cookies is not to overdo the butter and sugar. Just cream until it looks smooth and the sugar is evenly distributed. Then lightly beat the eggs and add them all at once and mix in completely. Unlike cake you don't want light and fluffy here. I didn't use flour or cocoa to roll them out, but I did do it right after mixing (onto my baking parchment). Then I put it in the fridge while the oven was heating up. Also let your oven heat AT the temperature for a full 1/2 hour before putting your cookies in.   These are my husband's new favourite. He is a self-styled chocolate connoiseur.  And I am sure my clients will love them as cookie lid to their cake "boxes".

I did not care for these - salty and crumbly. definitely would not use again. if you like the somewhat brownie taste, i would suggest making a regular brownie cookie (much better and easier), and cutting them into shapes when they are still warm out of the oven.

Wow these are awesome! What a chocolate taste!! They got rave reviews everywhere I took them. My only recommendation refrigerate the dough about 2hrs let stand for about 15 min on counter - put flour on counter and saran wrap on top of dough to roll out- its so much easier to roll using saran wrap. These are amazing!!

Awesome flavour and no trouble at all with these! i took the advice of adding a little cinnamon and it worked really nicely and VERY brownie tasting (i rolled them a little thicker too). Super cute idea to use them at a football party as i did, just some white stripes and laces and they were a huge hit!

These really are best ever. I substituted with gluten free flour and they still worked out amazing, they dough didn't spread and they maintained difficult shapes. SO GOOD.

Wow. I don't know what happened. We followed the recipe exactly, yet the dough was too soft (even after putting it in the fridge). They acted weirdly in the oven, bubbling like they had too much baking powder in them. Then half of them just collapsed, while still in the oven, and ended up thinner than they'd been rolled out, and burnt. The taste was not very good, either. We won't be making these again.

These cookies were very good. They came out a little flat when they were cooked. The only reason I gave them 4/5 stars. I followed the directions. No changes. And rolled out the dough. They spread quite a bit, which was fine, but a little flat. They did crisp on the edges and they were soft in the center.. perfect consistency. Even so much they fell apart because they were thin, but tasty.

I would say these were ok..... when you put the dough in the fridge they got hard as a rock, so I would skip that. They were just ok cookies I thought. Next time I think I will just add cocoa to my sugar cookie recipe like I normally do.

These are outstanding. Oh Chocolate Cutout Cookie Recipe, where have you been all my life? So pretty with sprinkles on them. And tasty, a nice change from sugar cookies. They are rich, like oreos. The batter was amazing to work with. I rolled between wax paper and did not need flour for rolling. Perfection! Thank You!!!

Big winner in our house.  I followed the recipe without changes, but found that they were much better when only cooked 8 minutes (not 10).  Frosted with chocolate frosting - family loved them!

I do not know what happened here...I followed the recipe as stated.  The dough was incredibly crumbly, I had to use my hands to get it together out of the bowl.  I was able to eventually roll out several cookies and while they tasted very good I was disappointed that the work involved and I was unable to make the cookies for my daughter's class for a Halloween party.  Good taste, yes. But consistency is off.

This recipe came together okay and did not get even close to falling apart, but it did not taste very good, if you like the taste of cocoa powder then you will like these cookies, maybe they will be better with real chocolate.

Really yummy cookies! Someone mentioned that they were like a brownie in a cookie, and that's my perception as well. I didn't want to wait for them to cool, nor did I particularly want to roll and cut them, so I squished the very soft dough into my cookie press and pressed out shapes. It worked perfectly! We frosted it with "Perfectly Chocolate Frosting" (recipe on the Hershey's Cocoa container) and the result is scrumptious. Will absolutely make again, next time with minty frosting!!

I used this recipe to be the outer rim of "owl eyes" cookies.  I am not sure if my cocoa is a little stale (in a box, not canister), but the dough wasn't chocolatey enough for me, so I added 2 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate.  Also, about a tablespoon of shortening to counteract the added chocolate.  The dough itself was lovely - though was too hard to be worked straight from the fridge.  It was difficult to get it to roll around the sugar cookie dough - but if I had been rolling it out flat and cutting shapes out, it would have been fine.  I also used cocoa and confectioner's mixed to roll out the dough. Baked for 9 min @ 365, delicious, and just perfectly chewy.  Great chocolate flavor.

These were super yummy! We aren't the biggest fans of regular sugar cookies, so when we decided to do halloween cookies I had to come up with a better solution. These cookies hit the spot. I like soft cookies so I decided to omit 1/4 C of butter and replace it with 1/4 C of applesauce. I had to leave it in the fridge for the 2 hours...much too sticky when I tried to work with it before that. I also rolled the dough in a mixture of powdered sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg instead of flour which added a nice flavor. I had to let the cookies pretty much cool completely in the pan so they wouldn't crumble when I removed them. Using a very sharp ended spatula helped. We didn't make frosting, but I'm sure they would taste amazing with a good cream cheese frosting. Overall I am very pleased with them and will be making them many times in the future.

Excellent recipe... people at work and at home LOVED these cookies. Although I chilled the dough only for an hour and let it sit outside the fridge for 20 minutes before rolling it out. Oh and I also used cocoa to knead the dough just as one of the other reviewers suggested. I made these in star shapes and stuck silver dragees on all the points... the looked really pretty and had absolutely no cracks. I'm making these every year, thank you!

Boy, was I disappointed with these!  I wanted to make them in bat and cat shapes for a Halloween party, and couldn't find a suitable amount of time to bake them for - they either burned or were raw, and in either case they broke very easily. And after all that, they didn't even taste that good! Still searching for a "best ever" chocolate cutout!

Usually my reviews have a few tips on how to make the recipe better and 5e rest is positive but these didn’t work for me. I’ve tried these multiple times and every time I make them I regret it......sorry but I have to give this a one star.

I used many of the suggestions, added and extra egg yolk, added vanilla and I rolled them using the 3 to one flour to cocoa ratio.  I also added a teaspoon of espresso powder.  They were a bit of a challenge to roll out but the taste is outstanding!  Your grandma knew her cookies, thanks.  I will make these again!!!

Followed this recipe exactly and the cookies turned out great! Did not have issues with cookies breaking, except where I rolled the dough out too thinly. Delicious and great for using cookie cutters!

I used this recipe to make chocolate bunnies for Easter.  The first batch I let sit on the cookie sheet for 5 minutes as the recipe says, which turned out to be a big mistake.  They got hard and I had to chisel them off the cookie sheet, breaking them all into pieces.  They need to be removed from the cookie sheet while they're still soft and warm. Other than that, they were good, but I wouldn't say they are the "best ever", so I gave them 4 stars.

I was so disappointed with how these cookies turned out. I even added vanilla and they were so bitter chocolatey! They were also very crumbly almost like burnt edges of a brownie. I only cooked them for 7 minutes like some others suggested (and also, I love soft cookies) and they were awful. I consider myself an intermediate baker but these wouldn't even work out for experts. Most of the reviews that are positive, the person had to tweak the recipe. It was most definitely not "the best chocolate cutout cookie you have ever tasted" as the description says...on to find a different recipe!

Sooo yummy! Followed the advice to add the egg yolk and vanilla and also stuck some cinnamon in and they are awesome.  Froze the dough to save time and it was sticky but used extra cocoa. Minor mess but the end result is worth it.

These taste really good, dense and chocolaty. The only issue I had is that the dough is delicate. I tried to use a cookie cutter with small parts and the dough ripped a lot. So I switched to a simple/easy cutter and had no problems. Keep in mind this recipe does not make a lot of cookies.  I used a "regular" size heart cutter and it made 24, not 36 cookies. But I love the chocolaty taste of these! would be great for homemade chocolate sandwich cookies.

These cookies taste just like brownies! They are much better when they are thicker. I would suggest adding more flour to the batter though, because it can get very sticky when rolling.

Really good. I'll likely make these again. The dough held its shape really well with my cutters, the cookies ended up a little chewy and a little crisp (depends on thickness of course). I used some extra cocoa to dust during rolling/working with the dough, and it worked really well, but the cookies did end up being just a tad unsweet, IMO. A nice sweet frosting would probably be amazing. We ate them cutout, but plain, though, and still really good.

These turned out great for me. I didn't bother chilling the dough (I was in a hurry - had to make these as a last-minute holiday gift) and they still turned out fine, the dough pulled apart a little bit when I was rolling it out but wasn't too sticky or hard to work. I added just a little bit of vanilla and topped these off with a drizzle of simple homemade caramel. These cookies were just the right amount of sweet and chocolately and turned out with a nice soft texture. Great recipe!

I made these cookies to add some chocolate to my Christmas cookie tray.  They were a big hit.   I took the suggestion of the one reviewer and substituted 1/4 cup of shorting for a 1/4 cup of butter and added an egg yolk.   I didn't have too many problems with the dough when I kept it thick enough.   I simply sprinkled them with powdered sugar after they had cooled, and both looked and tasted great!  Didn't have any leftover.

Delicious!  I also added an extra egg yolk and actually added 1 Tbsp of vanilla (by mistake :) then i refrigerated the dough overnight.  The next day I cutout the cookies and chilled them on the pans for like 10 minutes before putting them in the oven.  They came out awesome - and taste chocolately good :)  A keeper!!

Mine were soft and tasty. Very chocolatey. I did add the extra egg and vanilla like others said. Baked at 325 for 7 minutes on parchment paper so they were soft.

Good but not great recipe.  The cookies really need to be refrigerated twice to totally retain their shape.  Once for the 2 hours as directed and a 2nd time after they are cut out and on the cookie tray.  I found that one batch which I cut out and got in the oven immediately did a pretty good job of retaining their shape.  The batch I made w. my kids (so it took longer to cut out and re-roll and the dough got handled more) spread quite a bit more.  The taste of the cookies is very chocolatey, if kind of one-dimensional.  I'd made it again, but with a few things to enhance.  Probably double strength vanilla and a bit more flour.

It's not very often I have the time to come back and rate a recipe but I have to say these could even be better then a chocolate chip cookie.  It's like a split between a cookie and soft fudgy brownie.  The only change I made in the recipe is that I used an egg replacer cause my son has an allergy.  By far the best cookie :)

I followed the recipe but, as mentioned by others, also added 1 t vanilla and swapped out 1/4 c shortening for part of the butter.  I had Droste dutch process cocoa on hand, so I used that.    I chilled half the dough in the freezer for about 15 minutes while I rolled out the first half, which I didn't even bother to chill at all. I used a sheet of silicon (like Silpat) on which to roll out the cookies.  It made the job SO simple!  I found it helped to peel off the little scraps of dough around the cookies and then use a very thin metal cookie spatula to lift them onto my cookie sheets, which I had rinsed in very cold water and dried before putting the cookies on it.  I baked them for 10 minutes.  Yield: 42 very thin 3" cookies.  They *are* brownie-like in flavor, even as thin and crispy as they are.  This recipe is a keeper!

My dough was very dry, so dry that I had to mix in more butter and even added milk to make up for the lack of moisture.  The dough also kept drying out and I had to keep adding milk to it for it to be workable.  Because the dough was so dry the cookies were also dry.  I will probably make these again but up the butter to a full cup.

I followed the suggestions & added an extra egg yolk and some cinnamon. Rolled the dough 1/4" and baked on parchment for 7 minutes. Great flavor, chewy texture but they broke easily, even after glazing them with a thin icing. Next time I'll use a sturdier cutout design, or just cut into rounds. Will add to my collection.

Loved the taste of these, just like brownies. The dough was a little challenging to work with, I found using a mixture of icing sugar and Cocoa powder minimized the stickiness. I found the dough got crumbly after working with it for a bit though.

These are wonderful!  Just what I was looking for.  I didn't think the dough was overly sticky at all.  I didn't even need to refrigerate it before rolling out.  I did roll it between wax paper which made the rolling very easy.  I also cut them thick 'cause that's how I like my sugar cookies.  Very yummy!

I like these better than traditional sugar cookies.  These are not overly sweet, and they taste like thin, chewy brownies.  The dough is very sticky and does not spread much.  I rolled my dough while still chilled then I refrigerated my cut outs for ~15 minutes.  Very, very good for cut-out cookies.  Next time I might try Hershey's special dark cocoa to get a darker color.

Love these cookies! My daughter does not like sugar cookies so we make these every year at Christmas time and make a minty frosting for them. The dough is easy to work with and they come out great. I love the fact that they are chocolaty and not too sweet.

I would not recommend this dough for cutout cookies because it was way too sticky! None of the shapes held their form. On the other hand, the cookies tasted delicious!! I would just recommend making the cookies into circles. I also added 1 tsp of vanilla to the recipe and that turned out great!

Nice and chocolatey, but a bit too crunchy for my family's preference. I tried less time in the oven and then they just kind of crumbled. I might make again in the future, or else just make regular chocolate cookies instead.

I love this dough. I've never been lucky with cut-out cookies, and I was able to get sharp looking little bats for Halloween. I chill the dough overnight so that it's nice and cold to work with. The dough is really chocolatey, but not too sweet. I agree that if serving the cookies at a party, it's probably best to roll in cocoa powder instead of flour. I'll be making this dough from now until Christmas!

Very good, they almost taste like brownies when cut thicker, which I did...more like 1/6-1/4 inch. I did add an extra egg, some vanilla, and some cinnamon. Won't do the cinnamon again, but the egg and vanilla add to it. Definitely frost them, the cocoa is almost too rich and dark without it.

First off, 375 is way too hot to bake these cookies. I used a 350 oven for 10-12 minutes. I did roll out thicker and reduced the cinnamon by half. The dough was a sticky mess for me to work with. I had to put the whole cookie sheet in the freezer to let the scraps firm up before I could remove it from around the cut out cookie.  Good flavor but I don't think it is sweet enough for kids. The next day these were too soft for me, so I did not even waste the time decorating with icing.

The cookies were great with the extra egg yolk, but for some odd reason, they smoked a lot... My oven was spewing out tons of smoke even though I had the cookies in there for only 7 minutes at 375 degrees... I know I don't have a problem with my oven because I just baked a cheesecake the day before and it was fine...

These absolutely delicious cookies taste a lot like brownies. I followed the advice of making some modifications (add an egg yolk, 1 tsp of vanilla, and 1 tsp of cinnamon), and they came out great. I did have trouble with breakage, though, when I didn't grease the cookie sheet well enough and I let the cookies cool on the tray -- but when I removed them immediately from a well-greased tray, the problem was solved. Btw, I made these as Valentine's Day cookies (heart-shaped), and they were a big hit with my son's preschool class.

I might make this again. The dough came out very hard after refrigeration, but it became softer after some kneading & rolling. I followed the recipe exactly and it was very easy to make cut-out cookies, but the edges became puffy after baking, so the cookie doesn't hold the shape if you have very elaborate cookie cutters.  I didn't mind that it wasn't too sweet but the cookie was very hard and not too much flavor.

I must say these were a disappointment. The kids liked them, hence the 2 stars, but the adults wouldn't eat a second one. They were very dull, with little to no sweetness. I even used a confectioner's sugar and milk icing, but no luck getting them sweeter. Think I will stick to plain sugar cookies.

Very yummy... I made these in the shape of leaves for my daughter's story time fall party at the library. All the kids loved them. I decorated them with the "Sugar Cookie Icing" recipe from this site. They cut out beautifully with our cookie cutters, and I didn't even refridgerate mine. I followed a lot of the recomendations from other reviews as far as adding extra ingredients/ subs to make the dough better.

I'm not sure what happened but I followed the directions and when I took the dough out to roll it was so crumbly. I add another egg and some vanilla so the dough would stick just a little. Got about 20 cookies had to throw out the rest of the dough. The cookies smelled wonderful baking but tasted very bad. Sorry will not try again.

I don't know why this recipe didn't work out for me.  They looked beautiful, but I did not care for the taste. I didn't use the modifications of adding the vanilla or cinnamon, so maybe that was the problem.  It was just not sweet like a cookie should be and I followed the recipe exactly.

These held their shape well, and they tasted like crispy brownies. They were perfect. I didn't roll them out like it said here, but i only rolled out small sections and kept the rest of the dough in the fridge to keep it cold. These were wonderful

I've had tastier cookies, but these work great if you want black cookies to decorate for Halloween. They have a plain cocoa flavor like an oreo, but they look great! I halved the batch but still used a whole egg, so that might have helped keep them chewy. For a full batch I would use two eggs instead of one. I made these with half a batch of plain sugar cookies, and then made black cats out of the chocolate cookies and ghosts out of the sugar cookies. The chocolate dough is a little sticky, so be sure to keep it cold and use lots of cocoa powder dusted on the board. And be careful not to overbake them since you won't see any color change. The dark cookies look really striking with any decorations you put on top.

I made these cookies the other day.
This recipe is the best chocolate cookie recipe I have ever made!  When I added the egg, I also added one egg yolk.  They didn't break, and baked up nice and chewy.  I had some sitting on the counter for two days uncovered and they didn't get hard!  Very brownie-like cookies. My kids ask me everyday to make more!

If I could give this recipe NO STARS I would have. Despite following the recipe (and many of the suggestions) quite carefully and refrigerating for well over two hours, it wouldn't even come close to holding together long enough to cut shapes out of it. This is defiitely NOT the Best Ever Chocolate Cutout Cookie recipe.

Wow!  These are *so* yummy!  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the dough, and my dough was very stiff (my hand-held mixer was having trouble with it and, needless to say, it needed no refrigeration), but my kitchen smelled heavenly while the cookies were baking.  I baked the first batch for seven minutes, but found after they cooled that they were a little too hard for my liking, so I baked the second batch for 6 minutes.  Perfect!  Thanks for the great recipe -- it's a keeper!

I had a lot of trouble with this recipe and I'm not sure why (given all the rave reviews!). I did use butter flavor Crisco instead of butter and did not melt it but used it a room temperature which I perhaps mistakenly considered "soft". At any rate the dough was very dry and crumbly and only stuck together when I kneaded it like playdough. It rolled out okay but still tended to crumble and the finished cookies were hard and broke easily. The taste can only be described as "extreme chocolate" which was more than even this chocolate-lover could handle. Sorry. Disappointing recipe for me. Seemed like the proportion of liquid to dry ingredients was maybe off.

wonderful cookies.  I was worried as I mixed them together--the dough seemed really dry and crumbly, but after chilling it rolled out nicely.  Even cut-out from the second and third round of scraps were good.  Very chocolatey-definitely a keeper.

Very chocolately cookie.  I used a mixture of whole wheat and white flour, and it worked fine.  Next time, I would cut down on the sugar a bit (they were a little sweet, even without the icing) and refrigerate for less time--my dough was in the fridge overnight. Though I had no problems with the cookies holding shape or becoming crumbly, I had to wait a long time for the dough to warm up so I could roll it out.

Sorry but these should be called the "Worst Ever Chocolate Cutout Cookies".  I followed the recipe to the letter and the dough was stiff and dry.

Add additional flour.
Freeze for 2 hours, allow to thaw before rolling out dough.

I'm giving this recipe an "average" of 4 stars... 5 stars because the cookies were delicious, and 3 stars because they crumbled all over the place as I tried to remove them from the baking sheet.

I made these cookies for a cookie decorating party, and they were a huge hit.  Everyone loved the delicate chocolate flavor.  I liked them a lot because the cutout cookies didn't lose thier shape, as so many cutout cookies do.

A wonderfully cookie.  It doesn't need any icing since it is sweet enough as is.  I used this recipe to make chocolate Easter bunny cookies, complete with pink ears and nose, and white whiskers using piping icing and sprinkles.  They are adorable and a great compliment to my Easter feast!

I made stain glass cookies by using a 4” cutter for the outside and and a 2” cutter for the inside. I found it was easier to keep the shape of the cookie by placing the cookie once cut with the the larger size on a parchment lined cookie sheet then carefully lineup the smaller cutter and remove the center of the cookie. Chill cookies on cookie sheet for 10-15 min. Fill center of cookie with pulverized hard candy.

These cookies were the worst texture. They were extremely crumbly and couldn't be rolled at all. I tried cooking them as scooped cookies, since they wouldn't roll out. They didn't spread at all and were a weird texture. I don't recommend these cookies at all.

If you don't like the taste of this cookie, you're crazy. I gave this 5 stars based on what others suggested and I followed. I still thought it was too sticky so I added 1/8 c more flour which helped some. I had no problems using flour [lots of it] to roll and cut out shapes. It didn't show on my cookies once baked I guess because the dough is so moist. I do not suggest this recipe for cookies you want to dip instead of piping icing. They're way too soft. Hopefully the icing helps strengthen them a little better. And yes, they taste just like brownies. UPDATE: not sure about adding the extra flour now. Just realized I used 1 cup butter instead of 1/2 cup. Probably why I had slight issues. Oops!

These taste like a brownie in cookie form. They are excellent. No frosting ontop required. Only changes were from the other reviews of added another egg & 1tsp vanilla. The dough is a bit sticky but I always separate the dough into 2 pieces, put it loosely in Saran Wrap, press it to the req thickness and then put it in the fridge. No rolling req just use the cookie cutters when ready

My 7 year old grandson made these for his cousins to have a dino day. I was concerned with some of the reviews they would be dry. He added vanilla and an extra egg yolk. In our dry environment they turned out perfect. It was a cool day so we only refrigerated for about 35 minutes and rolled right away. We left it thicker then recomended. 
We made complicated dinosaur cut outs and they worked perfect! The children decorated with icing and sprinkles. They loved the taste.

I made the dough exactly as written.  The only thing I did was chill the dough again after I cut them out to make sure they didn't spread.  We thought they tasted a lot like a brownie.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you!!

While some of us may have perceived Stu to be a "Debbie Downer" with his review, we have discovered that he is indeed an insightful baker. Perhaps it was the presence of organic sugar, which made the dough grainy. Perhaps it was simply the touch of a master baker trying some new tricks. Regardless, the one thing we do know for sure is that Stu should not be doubted in the future by readers of this lovely recipe. 

Despite the dough, the recipe worked well!

I made this recipe as is and it was not great. The flavor was only so so. The dough was difficult to work with and very sticky or too hard but rarely just right. Once baked, these cookies were rather fragile and didn’t stay together very well.

Loved this recipe!! I altered it a bit, as per the suggestions. I added an extra egg, 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 peppermint extract, and 3.3 grams of instant coffee and rolled them out a bit thicker. I didn't refrigerate my dough either, only because I was on a time limit. When finished, I drizzled with melted white chocolate and sprinkled crushed candy canes on top. The texture of these is perfect!! It might have had something to do with my use of a stoneware pan, but they turned out kind of chewy still with a nice snap, which is how I prefer my cookies. I plan on seeing how else I can play around with this recipe but I think these are a new go-to!

First tIme making these. I always read reviews to see the trend in add/reduce ingredients before I bake. I added the 1tsp of vanilla, 1 egg yolk and reduced sugar to 3/4 of a cup (I normally reduce sugar in all recipes) and theses were delicious.  They smell and taste like brownies and 8 minutes was the exact time for my oven. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

I added the extra egg yolk and rolled them thicker too.  I refrigerated the dough for just one hour and had trouble rolling it out.  I let it warm up a little before I could roll them.  These are like brownie cookies!  I plan to make some as chocolate Easter eggs for Easter.

Very easy to make, taste great. I added 2 tsp vanilla, cut sugar and butter back small amount. Chilled dough 30 minutes. Oiled rolling pin with bit olive oil, rolled dough on piece parchment paper, lined cookie sheet with parchment as well. Rolled to 1/16" using Joseph Joseph rolling pin. Baked 6 minutes 350 degree convection oven. Adding to my favorites.

TIPS! TIPS! TIPS!

I had no problems with this recipe (or any others), and here's why...

GENERAL TIPS -------

1. Make sure your oven is the right temp. Spend the $7 and get an oven thermometer from Target (or wherever) and verify that the knob on the outside and the temp on the inside are the same. 

2. Read through the recipe and the comments. Ignore the comments that suggest modifications until you've tried the recipe as-written first. Note what problems folks had and consider the solutions.

3. Know that butter makes a crunchy cookie and margarine keeps them softer.

4. Always use name brand products - it matters! They've done the research and have a product that's always consistent.

5. For accuracy, consider measuring your ingredients by weight instead of using measuring cups. It's an investment in a kitchen scale and keeping a notebook of your conversions, but it's worth it!

RECIPE SPECIFIC -------
1. If you like your cookies crunchier, use butter. Otherwise, use Parkay margarine sticks.

2. Thoroughly cream the butter and sugar before going any further. Set your mixer on medium and let it go for 2-3 minutes.

3. Refrigerating the dough will make it easier to work with. If you left it in the fridge for more than 2 hours, let it sit on the counter to soften up for about 30 mins,

4. When rolling out the cookies, know that thin cookies will be crunchy and thicker will be softer. 
V
5. Never mix new dough with old dough. Roll out some new dough and cut out your cookies.

I love this recipe, we make it every year for Christmas!  It taste like rich chocolate brownies!  It can be sticky, I let the dough warm up a little after the fridge. I sprinkle the counter with cocoa and roll the dough out with Saran wrap on top of the dough. Nothing sticks!  If the dough is too thick add a tiny bit of milk. I bake until they start to harden.  The kids scarf these down!  One of my favorite recipes!  The kids ask for it every year. It's now a tradition!  Thank you for this!

Taste was fine. Rolling out was not too bad. Watch the time on baking, at least for first batch. I burned the first dozen using the least time (8 minutes), so all other batches I baked at 6 minutes and that was much better.  I will probably not make these again, but hadn't tried cut out cookies for a long time and wanted to make some for Christmas. They are not spectacular enough in taste to make again.  I will stick with drop cookies for the simplicity of baking them.

Cutting and transferring to a baking sheet is a delicate process so if you can, cutting them on the cookie sheet and removing dough from around them is ideal. 

I only added 1/2 tsp of baking powder and they still spread considerably even after baking on parchment on cold cookie sheets. 

I cut them 3/8" thick and after cooling they were nice and solid while still being chewy inside and they taste good. 

I decorate a LOT of cookies and this will now be my default recipe for chocolate.

This was my first time making chocolate sugar cookies. These were so rich, yet not too sweet leaving room for icing. The cookies turned out perfect in texture, not too soft not too crunchy and they stood the test of tapping as I was doing the royal icing decorations on them. Like other reviewers I just went on ahead and added an extra egg York and rolled them out about a ¼ inch thicker. I will be keeping this recipe for sure

Finally!!!  A chocolate cutout cookie that didn't fail me! Dough is great to roll and cut. No" fatalities" and I cut stars, trees and tiny little gingerbread men and snowmen which retained all of their limbs and points. Followed a suggestion in reviews to use cocoa for rolling and worked great-  other than that I followed instructions to a "T". A keeper for me!

I am a very experienced cookie baker.  This recipe sounded great, however it was NOTHING like Krista3 claimed. Dough was so dry it was impossible to work with. Raw dough tasted great but the quantities are all WRONG......not nearly enough wet ingredients to hold the dough together.  How she thought this made a soft dough that might need extra flour is a mystery.  I was precise about my measurements , so the issue is with the recipe.

Delicious!!!! I just baked them following the recipe and the only modification that I made was using splenda instead of sugar to save some calories and they came out great. Rich chocolaty flavor.  A keeper!!! Thanks for sharing.

These were well loved by my son's preschool class and their parents.  We topped with chocolate icing and Transformers candy toppers.  My son wanted chocolate cookies and I was so excited to find this recipe.

These were excellent with a few modifications. I added a pinch of cinnamon, a little vanilla, an extra egg yolk, and substituted crisco for 1/2 the butter. I rolled it between waxed paper. When rolled and cut, I put them in the freezer for a few minutes before transfering them to my cookie sheet because the dough was very soft. They had a great flavor that both children and adults enjoyed.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I followed the directions to the T, put it in the fridge for 2 hours, and it came out as hard as a rock. I wasn't able to roll it out at all. When it did soften up a little, it was crumbly and didn't stay together. This was a total waste of time and ingredients.

3 stars for delicious, our only beef which is a big one with this recipe is the refrigeration time, way too long and it's too dry and crumbly.  To solve this problem we finally came up with the idea to add a bit of milk to it, this made it way more manageable.  So ya with the knowledge we have, the next time we make these it will be better!  The smell as they baked was heavenly to say the least!  Even the dough smelt delicious.  I had to use a bigger cut out, ya like someone said earlier bats worked great.  Our cat and Witch though did not work as extremities kept falling off!  These were decorated with the hard icing, which works great for stacking on top of one another when dry of course.  They looked really good with a orange border all the way around them!  What fun these added to our Halloween!

Great for BATS!
Great for REINDEER!
I added an extra egg yolk. 
I rolled the dough between two sheets of saran wrap to 1/2 inch thick, dipped the cutter in in cocoa, and baked the cookies for 10 minutes.  Use a great icing recipe that hardens with a shine to paint the reindeer white.      

I frosted with chocolate frosting and put down Halloween m and m's for the eyes.  

Spooky and Delicious.

I reduced the temp on my oven AND the cooking time to 6mins and they still came out overdone.
Not awful, but not great.
ditto the suggestion to use cocoa powder when rolling out rather than flour. (or 50/50)

I may have overbaked the cookies. They were not real chewy and reminded me of Oreos. I thought the dough was a little dry.

I made these for a Halloween alternative event at my church for the kids to decorate and they turned out great. Not too sweet but chewy enough.

I don't know what went wrong because I followed the recipe exactly, chilling the dough and everything. These spread a lot and thus lost all shape during baking. The consistency was more that of a chocolate chip cookie than a cutout cookie. I took them to work and they disappeared like mad though! Taste: 5* (though very sweet), Presentation: 3*. I think I'd make them again, but with white choc bits and nuts as choc chip cookies.

Really dry and crumbly.  I had to add an extra egg to get it to hold together before refrigerating.  Taste good though.
