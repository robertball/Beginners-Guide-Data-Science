Disclaimer:  in real life, I think the recipe submitter is pretty awesome.  Despite our friendship, like GW, I cannot tell a lie, so rest assured the review is legit (in fact, I stumbled upon the recipe in the newest recipes and didn't even realize it was hers until I was about to make it!).  I wasn't sure what to expect with this, but we loved it!  It was like spaghetti and meatballs and garlic bread all in the same easy to eat dish.  I had everything in the freezer (Jay's pizza crust dough, Meatball Nirvana, and homemade sauce), so all I had to do was thaw that stuff, boil noodles, and assemble.  Pretty easy.  To help you from making the same mistakes I did, please note the submitter tells you to flour your work space.  This is key to avoid rippage.  It's helpful to rinse the pasta in cold water (or use cold leftovers) to avoid warming the dough/rippage, too.  The measurements are spot on, though I did add some raw diced onion and fresh mozz simply because they needed to be used.  I'm a lousy roller (and had already made the aforementioned mistakes), so mine ended up being more stromboli like than rolled.  We especially liked the garlic salt on top.  I think this would be a great filling snack/meal for beer drinking and watching sports!  THANKS, Sanzoe, for another winner!

I used a file dough instead of cornbread easier to get flat plus closer to a bread taste. Key is to work with cold precooked products (leftover chilled pasta already sauced) . If you'r like me and like to add extra ingredients to pasta (vegetables. meat chunks, etc) all the better and you don't need to limit to just spaghetti style pasta and cooked pasta will do. Another great add is cheese like mozzarella or jack cheese to make all ingredients stick together better inside crust.

What a delicious and fun recipe to make and to eat.  I used a  homemade pizza crust by duboo and it worked great with this recipe.  ~ I read the recipe and then read the review by lovestohost, and used her suggestion of the cold spaghetti.  I did not have any problems with the dough ripping.  This came together quickly and baked up nicely.  The taste was wonderful and the next time, and there will be a next time, I'm going to add a green pepper. Thanks, sanzoe for sharing your recipe.

I made this for supper tonight and everyone loved it. Instead of meatballs, I added cooked ground hamburger to my sauce. I will be making this again.

Needed way more than 1/4 cup of sauce. So as its noted, add sauce for taste. I used Hunts cheese and garlic spaghetti sauce (the whole can) 2 Betty crocker dry pizza crust (just add water) and only 12oz of spaghetti noodles.

I love the idea and the flavor, but my experience with the construction was off.

I made my own sauce, my own meatballs and tried to make my own pizza dough.  The dough was ruined by my math and I used Pillsbury for the first day.  Thin crust Pillsbury dough was a nightmare - way too thin but the classic crust was better.  However, the braiding left too much dough on the top.  The inner layer of dough, on the top, was sort of too raw, so the recipe temp was off for my oven.  After making this recipe into so much work, I refused to let it be so so...SO, I made pizza dough with my correct recipe and folded it more like a calzone.  I have set my oven to 325 on convection bake and my spaghetti calzone was PERFECT.  I love this initial idea and you could use any pasta recipe, excess water removed, inside the dough.  My family loved it - including the picky kids.

I haven't tried this recipe (yet) but I certainly  will.  However being a life long member of the bread club I was making spaghetti  sandwiches  since my children  were very young ( oldest child is over 40-ish) but haven't tried pizza dough.  I use whatever bread within reach. I also sometimes add a bit of sour cream yummmm!   For me this is fine dining.  Bon Appetite !

Great way to change it up so you don't get tired of leftover spaghetti! I added more meatballs throughout.

I used the Master Pizza Dough recipient along with my own homemade sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese and I have to say this is now the only way I eat spaghetti leftovers now! This is so good

It was a hit! Only adjustment I will make is more sauce. Just needs a touch more in my opinion.

Very good !!!  I made it for a family get-together and every one enjoyed it !  I used ground turkey sausage cooked with diced onions, basil, oregano and garlic.  I also sautéed red and orange bell peppers and added on top of the meat.  

I will use this recipe again !!!

Fun and easy meal that would be great for football watching or tailgating.  We switched out ingredients and added steam vegetables and artichokes.

I have been using Allrecipes for years and years.  Most recipes look very good, but I'm sorry, this looks disgusting, and I'm wondering why it was even posted.  I would never, ever try this.

Amazing! Everyone loved this, and I will definitely make this again, maybe for a party. Everyone will be shocked! It'll be wonderful! I didn't change anything in the recipe and it was great, however next time, I'll add more meatballs to see what happens!
