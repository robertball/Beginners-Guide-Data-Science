I knew going in on this dressing that it would probably have more mayonnaise than I prefer but was willing to give it a try.  Still, once I mixed it up I was surprised at just how much I underestimated that.  This was so mayonnaise-y  it dominated, almost rendering any other ingredient null.  For the most part, it’s all I could taste.  Once doctored with the additions of a fair amount of both sour cream and buttermilk it was markedly improved.  As this recipe’s first reviewer, I wish I could have given it a better launching with a more favorable review.

I submitted this recipe, and just wanted to add a word of advice.  I believe the green onions are the key ingredient. I discard the white part and about an inch of the green end, then chop the rest very fine.  It has to marinate for at least 2 days for the flavor to develop.  Also, most any type of crumbly cheese will work in this recipe.
