This was spectacular! I used already cleaned squid.  I didn't have stewed tomatoes so I used diced canned tomatoes and I didn't have anchovy paste but I did have a can of anchovies so I took 4 of them and just smushed them up.  The little bit of sweet and spicy was wonderful.  Don't be overwhelmed by the ingredient list, it was very easy to make.

Followed this recipe except my clean & frozen squid bodies didn't have tentacles to chop. I chopped some end pieces and mixed them into the stuffing, but it added nothing. Maybe tentacles would have added some chew, but really unnecessary. I was blown away how good this simple sauce was and can't wait to apply it to pasta dishes. My wife said we should make this for company. Could be a tough sell over the phone. "I bought too much squid. How about coming over..." Don't cut the cooking time short or the squid will be tough.

Very good. You have to use thicker squid. One was thick and held well. The other was thin and broke during cooking. Fun recipe.

Great dish. I am a squid lover so am biased. The surprising result from cooking in the oven in this style is that the squid is amazingly tender. All who try it are amazed it is squid because of the tenderness. I bought the squid frozen from the grocery freezer and thaw as needed. The thicker the squid - the better for this recipe.  Get some italian bread -- the spicy tomato sauce deserves to be dipped!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe, but I think next time I'll make a thicker sauce rather than the marinara type as listed.  Just a personal preference!

I made this for Christmas eve as we had an ethnic theme. This covered the category for portuguese and italian main dish. Next time I will find larger squid as the smaller ones were time consuming and difficult to stuff. My family was hesitant to try them but there were hardly any left. I loved the combination of ingrediants and would make again. Give it a try!

OH, MY, GOD! Soooooo amazing.
This recipe was delicious.
I had 8 Squids and I am so glad I did, cuz we all went crazy over this.
The sauce was so flavorful. I used Cabernet instead of white and my house smelled amazing while this was cooking. Reminded me of my Vovo's kitchen... very Portuguese smelling/tasting to me.
I followed the recipe with the following changes:
I had no pine nuts to add... I added peas to the rice instead
I used cab instead white wine (used 3/4 cup too)
doubled the amount of squid (8 total)
added a little marinara sauce to insure the squid were covered (plenty of sauce, though, but psyched to have so much left over)
I think I'll use a little less anchovy because of the added salt, tough call though, cuz the flavor is so good!
Hours later, we are still raving and this house smells so good!
TRY IT!

Fantastic ,
As fresh squid are readily available and at a reasonable price at the fish markets and supermarkets in Southern Portugal, I have tried it twice now in the last two weeks, and recommend it,  I use chilli flakes instead of red pepper flakes as i like things to be spicy, mmmmh! very filling

Cooked rice will only expand and get mushy after baking for an hour. (Perhaps dry bread crumbs is better.)  And the squid is way too chewy and inedible.  Sorry but to be fair since the other reviews were the only reason I tried this recipe.  We basically had to throw it out and eat leftovers.  

A good concept that needs a lot of tweaking - which I dare not try for fear of wasted ingredients.

EXCELLENT!  As others have said, this recipe makes the squid VERY tender.  Cut with a fork, easy to chew, and flavorful!  Recipe withstands tweaking well.  Usually I try to follow the recipe as written the first time, but I had to make due with what I had on hand.  I used a whole grain/wild rice blend instead of white rice and it came out great (whole rice tends to not mush like white does).  Didn't have anchovy paste, used hoisin paste instead (the only "paste" I had) and it still came out wonderful.  Used craisins instead of raisins and sliced almonds instead of pinenuts.  Would be better with pinenuts (what isnt?), but still gave it a good crunch.  Will definitely be making this again.

I made this for the 7 fishes Christmas eve dinner and it was very well received. I was really suprised that the squid was so tender! I guess baking it for that long takes away the "rubbery" texture. I thought the sauce was much too spicy, so I had to add a can of tomato sauce to tone it down which helped. I wasn't overly wowed with the stuffing. I will definitely search for a different stuffing recipe, but use this method of baking the squid because the texture was great!

You defiantly need large squid because the little ones fall apart.  It is very GOOD.

I also added dried cranberries with raisins to the rice.  Made it for my girlfriend and she loved it. Great and pretty simple recipe!

I switched it up a little and instead of rains and nuts I used mushroom and corn and seasoned with some other spices like sazon. And I did not use the sauce on top to bake I set aside for a dip and basically baked them turning over twice till they were crisp brown. Also added chopped up jalepeno to sauce for little more kick. Omg delicious

This took much longer than I expected. Although I did make some changes I must say that the end result was not what I had hoped for. This was primarily because there is way too much crushed red pepper. it was so spicy that it was hard to grade this on it’s real marriage. I suggest illuminating the crushed red pepper and adding it to taste.

This is an excellence base recipe to start with very easy to tweak it. 
I added a few things to add some extra flavour. First I didn't have any pine nuts, so I subsisted slivered almonds. when I added sauteed the onion and garlic for the rice I also roasted the nuts and added mushrooms. In the tomato sauce I added fresh basil and used less anchovie paste. I cooked up the squid separate in a frying pan with a bit of oil. then just assemble the food on my plate as i ate. very delish, i would make it again.

Amazing flavor. A bit chewyu, but not unpleasantly so.  Next time will reduce either cooking time or heat.
