Perfect for a quick lunch that's on the lighter side - especially if you use light cheese!  Definitely toast your English muffin first.  If you're not a huge onion fan leave them out.  I changed this up a bit and topped my tomato with a bit of italian style bread crumbs, minced garlic, basil and oregano (a little like "Baked Tomatoes Oregano" from this site). Instead of just mozzarella I used lite mozzarella along with some lite grated parmesan and romano that I hand on hand. Delish!

This is am awesome and simple little sandwich! Unfortunately my tomato was no good so I made it without. I used havarti cheese and added fresh basil instead of dried. I used honey wheat english muffins was added great taste to the sandwich. I am looking forward to making this again with tomato. This was the first time I used my broiler option on my stove and it worked great.

Being someone who rarely eats mean this is a wonderful easy, tasty recipe.  I just used regular sourdough and it turned out great. will make again!

This was great for a light lunch! I lightly toasted the english muffin first, and instead of using butter, I used some light mayonnaise. I didn't have the recipe in front of me, so I completely forgot the dried basil, which I know would've added a nice touch...next time I will not forget to use it. As long as you like tomatoes and onions you really cannot go wrong with this one! Thanks for sharing. :)

I liked this! I didn't toast the muffins before hand, and I drizzled olive oil on them instead of using butter. Perfect for a quick, light dinner. Thanks!

Simple and tasty...healthy too if you use reduced fat cheese. A juicy, flavorful tomato is important in this dish.  Thanks for sharing!
