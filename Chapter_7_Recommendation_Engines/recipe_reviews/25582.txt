This is an excellent cake...if you want to make it a no-fat cake you can substitute apple sauce straight across for the vegetable oil...great for those on Weight Watchers!  And it still tastes fantastic.

Delicious and so easy!  After reading some other reviews I took a chance and made some changes that I think improved the cake immensely.  I added 2 teaspoons of vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and a tablespoon of mayonnaise (I know, it sounds strange but it really is a great addition!)  Takes away the nonfat aspect of the recipe but adds a richness for just a few extra calories.

Surprisingly excellent! For a slightly healthier version, I made the following subsitutions: for 2 c sugar, I used 1/2 c honey & 3/4 c sugar. For 3 c flour, I used a mixture of white & whole wheat flour (more wheat than white). For 2 c water, I used 1 c "Lite" coconut milk and 1/2 c water. I added 2 T cocoa. The texture was medium. The cake was moist and sweet. I used a made-up coconut frosting and sprinkled coconut flakes on the top and used a berry jelly/honey mixture in between the layers. I baked it at 160 C for 30 min on "pastry mode" and it rose nicely. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Well, it tasted like a cake made with oil and water. Which it was.....making it not so fair for me to give it a low rating, but I really didn't care for it much.

I tried this recipe and the cake was kind of bland so I made a peanut butter glaze to go over it. But without it, its not sweet enough and has a weird taste.

I'm afraid I definitely noticed the absence of eggs, milk and/or butter.  Dry, with a "cardboard" taste to it.

I found this to be a superb "everyday" cake. This is something, that while very good, isn't so terribly rich you only want it once in a while. The removal of eggs from a cake recipe also makes it great for those of us on a budget. I have experimented with the recipe a bit and have also found that 1-2 tbl of sour cream in the mix adds a nice kick.

My family loves this cake, it´s olso known as "Italian cake" for the olive oil. A good thing to put on it is a cream cheese icing. Just beat 2 (8oz) cream cheese, 1/2 c confectiones sugar and 1tbs of almond extract, it´ll come out delicious. Also the cake tastes better if you cut off 1c of the sugar.

What a surprise to find this recipe!  This cake is a family favorite in my family, except we call it "Ol' Black Joe".  My Grandmother who always made this just recently passed away and I have now been made the offical maker of the "Ol' Black Joe" for all of our family functions.  My recipe is a slight bit different.
3 cups sugar
6 Tbsp melted shortening
3/4 cup cocoa
1 1/2 cup sour milk (you can sour the milk by adding 2 tbsp lemon juice)
1 1/2 tsp baking soda
3/4 cup hot water
3 cups flour
1 tbsp vanilla
put in greased and floured baking pan, and then bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  
Thanks so much for sharing your recipe :)

I made it exactly as it was written. The cake has nice texture , great to make a layer cake. Comes easy out of the cake pans. It lacks something in taste, tastes a little watery to me. Maybe something can be added to improve the taste.

This recipe actually wasn't too bad. My day started out wanting to use up some strawberries and a sure fire way is a trifle. I usually keep cake trimmings in my freezer just for this but was out so went in search of an easy cake. My husband needs to eat low cholesterol so the no butter and no egg aspect of this recipe really appealed to me. I made 1/2 the recipe which generosly filled a square baking dish. I doubled the cocoa. The texture was nice. It wasn't real sweet..but that could have been because I added more cocoa. I would still add the cocoa just maybe a touch more sugar with it. I would also add a dash of salt to deter the "bland" flavor a little more and possibly a splash of vanilla. Came out of a lightly greased glass pan with ease. Was perfect for the application I was using it for. Would probably perk up the flavor a lot with some icing as well. All in all..for a recipe which uses such cost efficient ingredients and keeps the fat and cholesterol down...it's a thumbs up in my book.

this is lovely. moist and rich but not too chocolatey. I don,t ice this one at all, it's rich enough. My kids love it, as does my husband who is addicted to chocolate. Even my dad likes it.

It is an interesting cake and did not dislike it.  Certainly very easy to make.   Will probably make it again but with some changes. Please reviewers how can you rate a cake as excellent when you change it completely.  This is what turns me off even writing a review

Needed a little something flavor wise...but definitely moist and sort of "fudgy" in texture. It was okay tasting, but like I said missing a little something. Would maybe be good with chocolate chips for added flavor.

While this cake isn't overly chocalately, it's a very moist delicious cake that doesn't even need frosting.  Even my husband, who isn't a big cake fan,loved it! Delicious with ice cream!

Quick and tasty and just right for a low-budget household like mine. I did make a few minor changes, though: I reduced the sugar and doubled the cocoa. Next time I'm going to put in chocolate chips yet to make it chocolatier.

I like this cake. I used to make a similar recipe frequently when I was younger, it was a depression era recipe. It’s very easy to make and no mixer needed so great for making with kids. I baked for about 37 minutes in a bundt pan at 350.
