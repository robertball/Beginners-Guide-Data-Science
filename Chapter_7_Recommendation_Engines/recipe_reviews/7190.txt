THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!! This bread is awesome!

I have a five year old son who won't eat anything green to save his life!!! He LOVES this bread! I even make his peanut butter sandwiches with it and he gobbles them up.

I make a loaf twice a week. It's a blessing. Now, if someone could come up with broccoli bread that he'd eat...we'd be set!

This recipe is great for getting some greens in to my toddler, and yummy. Whenever I bake it in my bread machine it totally sinks in the middle. So now I set it to the dough cycle & make little rolls (bake 12 mins @ 350) which are great for freezing.

I just love this bread, I make it almost every week.  It has a great flavor and works well with vegie sandwiches or as toast.  I take it to work and people rave over it.  It's one of the best breads I've ever tasted.

I made this bread to use with Cheese Fondue for a Halloween Party.  Maybe I didn't drain the spinach well enough, because it was quite green - or maybe I put too much wanting it to be 1/2 cup after it was thawed, drained & squeezed.  It worked well for the occasion though!  I also made a few changes - I substituted half bread flour, half whole wheat flour, a light cheese blend from Trader Joe's, and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I added 3 cloves of garlic, and half a teaspoon each of Basil, Thyme & rosemary.  Everybody loved the bread with the fondue, and it even tastes amazing by itself!

Pretty to look at, and the touch of pepper made it agreeably spicy.  Great sandwich bread for vegetarian sandwiches

Yummy!  It was a pain in the butt to prepare the spinach, but I'm glad I did so.  I had wilted my own spinach and froze it, so perhaps it was more watery than usual.  Regardless, I drained it then squeezed it, so it was somewhat drained.  I also added garlic to the bread, and my bread was a bit stickier than I think it was supposed to be, but it still pulled away from the pan so it was good.  I only made the dough in the breadmaker; I'm a diehard oven baking fan.  I was going to let it rise for about 30 minutes; but it just was so quick to rise I abandoned that effort after about 15 minutes.  I really didn't want it to become a monster loaf. I baked the bread at 375 for about 45 minutes; not sure it normally needs so long but again, my dough was sticky.  It turned out with a crunchy crust but still a soft bread.  Great for sandwiches, and even just with a piece of cheese it's great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I also make this with rainbow swiss chard... very pretty.  and aged cheddar really adds flavour.  I make the dough in the bread machine, let it rise a 2nd time, then bake at 375 for around 20 min.

What a delicious and pretty loaf of bread this is :-). 
I did add slightly more spinach (I had it leftover from the stuffed shells I was making for dinner) and a full teaspoon of pepper.
My center fell just slightly as it cooled but it made no difference in the taste and you couldn't even tell after it had been sliced. My DH loved it. THANK YOU :-)
RhondaVOOS666...fresh garlic & yeast don't get along. Try adding it later or use garlic powder next time, that should help.

This is one of my very favorite bread recipes.  Wonderful texture and flavor!  (Set my bread machine to the light white setting.)  Great with soup, salad, by itself, or with a meal.  I'll be making this often.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this recipe many times & think it is fantastic!
I often use swiss chard in place of the spinach, which gives a smoky, hearty flavor. To use fresh instead of frozen I weigh out 5 ounces, then nuke it a couple minutes. Do drain it but you don't need to chop it (the bread machine does that for you).
If you don't like the bite of the pepper, you can substitute garam masala.

I tried making this bread...it was good, but not my favorite. My husband really liked it though. I decided to add some garlic and onion (cooked before) to the mix. It was good but I think the bread needed a little more spice to it. Also my bread did not rise... So that was a bit disappointing.

I absolutely love this bread.  If I'm making bread to go along with a meal this is my choice every single time.   You can even slice it and make garlic bread with it.  Wonderful!

I thought when I opened the lid that this was a disaster, the top fell flat and it looked terrible.  I took it out and buttered a slice and it was incredible!  I used Tillamook sharp cheddar and 1/4 cup parmesan, then threw in some garlic and rosemary........garlic bread heaven!!! thank you for the great recipe, I will keep using it til I figure out what I did wrong to make it fall.

I made some modifications but this is really good bread. I used canned spinach, well drained - low sodium - 1/2 cup. I saved the liquid from the spinach and used it as part of the water required. I also left out salt. I added a tablespoon of dried chopped onion. I was out of cheddar so I used 1/3 cup of parmesan instead. I used the Basic bread setting with 2lb and dark crust. Wait for this loaf to cool before devouring - not likely!!! It smells wonderful hot.  Nice crunchy crust. It did not fall though I used all purpose flour. A nice rounded green loaf that was very good served with cream cheese.

I will use the rest of the spinach with an egg for breakfast served on top of a slice of spinach bread toast. :)

This came out perfect, everyone loved it. I didn't change a thing. The spinach & cheese flavors are really subtle. We made it by hand and made it into rolls and baked at 400 for 20min (usually I bake rolls for 15min but they didn't get golden in 15min) Yum - will definitely be making this again!

Made this one for a "bread party" at work (I brought all the bread!) One person liked it best, but overall it was rated "okay."  I did not find the flavor overly exciting and didn't taste the cheese, even though I added it in cubes during the last kneading cycle (hoping that it would not disappear into the bread...still did).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and it was soft inside and made a nice looking loaf.

I followed the recipe precisely and the process started off well, but the bread didn't rise in the final stages and although somewhat edible, the cheese was completely lost in the taste--a complete waste of an ingredient.  The pepper was overwhelming (I'll never put black pepper in bread again).

I followed this recipe exactly.  The bread did rise, but it fell during the cooking cycle so it was really quite heavy.  

I want to be very specific: we ADORE spinach and eat it all the time both cooked and raw.  My boyfriend didn't like the bread at all.  He ate one piece.  I ate about 1/3 of the loaf by myself.

Very simple, easy and tasty bread for the bread machine.  I used fresh, steamed, and well-drained spinach in place of the frozen spinach.  I did not bother to chop the spinach because it did so in the machine.  This makes a very large loaf of bread, so make sure your bread machine can handle 3 cups of flour.  I found out the hard way that mine could not.  It baked fine, it just was not pretty as it rose and baked right out of the baking chamber.  DH really enjoyed the taste of this bread and he is not a spinach fan.  It was just a nice subtle taste and the cheese added extra flavoring.  The next time I make this; I will once again use fresh spinach and let the machine do the blending.  But, I will then transfer the dough to a regular bread pan, let it rise, and then bake at 350° for about 30-40 minutes.

I took the other reviewers' advice and added some garlic powder.  The bread came out with a great flavor, but it was extremely concave (it fell in on itself like nothing I've ever seen!) and dense.  I might try it next time with bread flour instead of all-purpose and report back.

Love this bread - my daughter doesn't like the texture of spinach so I always have to add it to fritters and the likes - this was a much healthier alternative!  I used instant yeast, so after kneading I just cut the dough in three and rolled each piece into a sausage shape, braided them straight on to a baking tray, and let the braided loaf rise without punching it down.  Sprinkled on some sesame seeds just before baking. It turned out light and very tasty - 5 stars!!

I made this to go with leek & potato soup and my family went crazy over it. Even those who don't like spinach! I will definitely be making this again.

This tasted good, but was a little too "dough-y" for my liking.  It was only OK.

We really liked this.  The middle of the loaf did sink in the bread maker but that didn't matter.  It is very tasty and all the family ate it up.  For personal preference I would have liked a bit more spinach so will add some more next time.  Don't forget the pepper - it really makes this bread work.

Well, this wasn't the prettiest loaf of bread,(it totally sunk), but it was really good! I added the whole 10oz. box of spinach, a little extra cheese and about 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. I think next time I will add more salt, though, too, cause I think it needed just a little more to boost the flavor! Thanks for posting. :)

I used feta instead of cheddar and an entire 10 ounce package of frozen spinach. The bread was soft and not dry at all, even with the addition of some wheat flour, but the flavor really just wasn't all that great.

Great way to get some spinach in the kids.  Collapsed a little in the middle but once cut you could not even tell.

I used the recipe and revised it a little by 2x the recipe and:
adding: .5 multi-grain to .5 flour
                 dehydrated fruit (pineapple, mango, banana, raisin dark and light)
                   3 Tbl Flax seed and sesame seeds. 
Next I will try this recipe with dehydrated tomato and Italian style filling.
The cheese is the ingredient that helps keep multi-grain bread from falling apart when sliced. Very Nutritious.

Just amazing!  I live in the tropics, and have finally learned to adjust things a bit.  I added 2 tablespoons extra of flour (only had bread flour left and used that) and a bit of extra yeast.  I also added a tablespoon of parmesan after the first kneed.  I like spicy, living in Thailand, and used about a teaspoon of fresh black pepper, and same of garlic powder.  Next time I'm going to try adding fresh chili powder.  Best bread recipe I've tried yet!

I got my freshly baked loaf out of the oven 30 minutes ago and I'm still surprised at the outcome. It rose beautifully and it is delicious. I added 20% more spinach for flavour and 20% more water because I couldn't work with the flour (the cheese makes the batch somewhat more sticky). I baked at 325 (165 Celsius) based on other bread recipes around here and for 40-45 minutes. If I can make it work, anyone can.

I used bread flour instead of all purp and fresh spinach instead of frozen. My loaf rose beautifully and was so delish. At first I thought it might be bland but we all really enjoyed the simplicity of the bread. I served it with a minestrone soup recipe from here and it was a big hit. I think next time I might up the spinach and cheddar content.

I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour for the white. I also used the dough setting on the bread machine and then baked it in the oven, but it was pretty dense. I wouldn't make it again.

Fantastic Bread!!!  I loved it straight out of the machine with some butter, and I love it as the bread for my lunchtime sandwich.  My husband dislikes spinach and still loved this bread!
