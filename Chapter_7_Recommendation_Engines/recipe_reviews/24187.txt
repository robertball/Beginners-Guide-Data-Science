Wow!  I took this to a New Year's Eve party and it was a hit!  Rather than just mozzarella, I used provolone and romano as well.  It was awesome!  There were a few vegetarians at the party so I made a second loaf with peppers, onions, and mushrooms that was equally as good.  I served this with Pizza Sauce III!  Will definately make again.  Thanks!

This is good but I like to put the cheese on first and then the pepperoni so that the cheese will melt onto the bread.  It is also good with provolone cheese and ham.

Something happened to my bread dough during the day -- totally flat so I had to scurry and quickly defrost another loaf. This was a little more labor intensive than I thought it would be. Used only a 3-ounce package of pepperoni but added a drained can of mushrooms to offset the lack of pepperoni. This was pretty good served with some heated up spaghetti sauce. I couldn't believe how big the loaf was -- we had leftovers that I had wrapped up in foil. I think it was even better today because the bread was a little fluffier, softer. Anyway, I am going to make this many more times and experiment with other ingredients like turkey and colby/jack, ham and Swiss etc.

this recipe was great! everyone loved it. I would suggest using a little less pepperoni and cheese than what it calls for - because it came out VERY cheese and a little hard to handle/eat.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made my own homemade bread from my Kitchen Aid mixer so I proofed up the bread again after adding pepperoni and cheese.  I also had (warm) pizza sauce for dipping the bread.  I brought this to my euchre group and they ate the entire loaf.  I revised this with just one more step.  I put a light coat of the pizza sauce on the bread before placing the pepperoni and cheese on the and it gave it even better flavor than before.  I continue to make this for different functions and it is always a hit!!

Pretty good recipe, similar to my family's recipe for "cracklin" bread.  You can even go to your grocery bakery and ask for unrisen dough, it's better than the frozen dough in the frozen food section.  My kids preferred me to leave off the basil, oregano & onion flakes, and it didn't effect the taste.

Tasted good, will make again.  Next time, I will add more things: green pepper, mushrooms, etc.  And definitely would be good with a pizza sauce for dipping!

I would give this 100 stars but it only goes up to 5!  Perfect, perfect, perfect!!!  I made two at one time.  One we ate, the other we froze.  Three weeks later, the frozen one was just as delicious as the fresh one was (no thawing needed, goes right from freezer to oven, wrapped in foil.  I don't think this is necessary, but it sure made it good: I used a garlic-flavored extra virgin olive oil on the dough, and I placed the cheese first (as other reviewers mentioned) and then the pepperoni on top of that.  After rolling, I brushed with egg and then topped with a little bit of shredded cheese just for looks.  My kids (even the picky one) LOVED this.  This is the keeper of all keepers.  Tasted like I bought it at an Italian bakery or restaurant, even better, and was so easy!  Can't wait to try other fillings...ham & cheese, broccoli or spinach & cheese, philly cheesesteak (fried onions, steak & cheese).  Thanks for submitting this!!!!!

Delicious!  I use Pilsbury refrigerated thin crust pizza dough for simplicity. I just unroll it onto a greased baking sheet, sprinkle it with mozz cheese, lay the pepperoni on top, and then another layer of cheese.  I roll it all up into a log, then bring the ends together to make a "ring".  Seal all the edges well with water or the filling will leak!  I finish with the egg wash, sprinkle of italian seasoning and grated parm. cheese.  The presentation is so pretty I like to serve it to company.  And it tastes awesome, too!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Note, there is no need to let the dough rise. You can use it in the same manner as soon as it's thawed.

This is better than another pepperoni bread I tried on here. I turned the bread upside down before putting in oven. Spread a little bit of egg on top and put garlic salt on top. And I used mozarella cheese on top and inside. DELICIOUS!!!! Bread stayed together and everything. This time I didn't use the recommended time to cook because last bread I made I burned it. So I kept an eye on it while it baked!!! 
Delicious...excellent for pizza lovers!!!!! 2 thumbs up!! Thanks Holly!!

I made this version and it came out okay, just needs a little moisture in the filling.  I also made a version using chopped spinach sauted with olive oil and garlic, feta cheese, mozzerella cheese and chicken breasts that were marinated with pesto and grilled.  That version was amazing!  Very moist and yummy.  Took both breads out on a fishing trip and served with marinara sauce that was heated and kept in a thermos.  That was some good fishing lunch!

Used turkey pepperoni and sprinkled with Italian seasoning. I should have cooked it a little longer because it was a bit doughy but that might be the oven. Also like other reviewers suggested you need to roll tightly but that's just about the look of it and  this is delicious served with some warm pasta sauce.  I used a jar of marinara from the pantry.

This is a very easy way to make pepperoni bread. I added sauce and after making into a rectangle and adding the toppings I did a braided top, sprayed with olive oil instead of the egg, and sprinkled with grated parmesan and a little garlic powder instead of the herbs to add flavoring to the crust. I also found it baked best at 425 for about 18 minutes to get a golden crust. This was easier than making peperoni rolls out of the frozen bread rolls. A lot less time.

The bread was ok, but unrolled slightly when it expanded during cooking so that when the roll was sliced afterward, some of the pepperoni fell out.  I substituted freshly grated parmesan for the mozzarella, and used about half the pepperoni.  Not bad, but probably won't make it again.

I followed this recipe but made a few changes.  I used turkey pepperoni, added extra cheese (6 oz wasn't enough, IMO), and I omitted the egg and brushed it with EVOO instead.  I didn't roll it quite tight enough so I know to do that next time.  It tasted really great, even though it didn't look perfect.  I will definitely make this again...it was a hit with my family.  We ate it plain without the extra marinara but I bet that would be tasty also.  I plan to make another version with spinach and feta next time!!

Very, Very Good! Next time I will roll it a bit tighter as mine ended up with too large of a gap between layers - my fault entirely. AWESOME recipe...will make again!

This was very good and very easy.  I did use fresh basil and had pizza sauce for dipping.  My hubby and 3 year old ate it up (and I got very little for dinner).  Thanks for posting.

I made this with whole wheat bread dough, kraft fat free mozzarella and turkey pepperoni.  It was excellent and much better for my diet. I dipped it in warmed fat free pizza sauce-everyone loved it

Great taste, but instead of worrying about thawing a loaf, I substitued Pillsbury french roll.  Just popped it out of the can and unrolled!!

This was okay. It was very dry.  I did the oil and seasonings but that wasn't enough. It puffed up in the middle and expanded where pepperoni was oozing out. My children didn't eat it all.

This bread is a family favorite at our house!  I served it last night at a New Years Eve party and it was a huge hit.  The bread was done a little early, so I had to wrap it in foil to keep it warm.  The inside of the bread was much fluffier than it normally is when I serve it immediately.  From now on will be wrapping in foil for 15 minutes once I take it out of the oven.

I REALLY wanted this to work, I followed the directions exactly and when the bread was done baking the inner layer was not cooked all the way. I did NOT want to toss it, so I went ahead and sliced it up and then baked it for a few more minutes so it could cook through. I don't understand how so many made this with no problems, I would think its me but I did exactly as the recipe stated. It did taste good though, and after my quick save it was edible. Maybe next time I will fold it in half like a calzone or something.

This was so good and easy! I used a mixture of mozzarella and asiago cheese. I will try it with fontina cheese next. H loved it so much, he ate the WHOLE thing...LOL I served warm marinara sauce on the side for dipping. Update: Made it with four cheese blend and added gouda and sharp cheddar, along with some Italian seasoning. DELISH!

Great party food!  Just be sure to plan ahead so that the bread dough has time to thaw.  This would also be good with ham or canadian bacon.

Accidentally purchased frozen pizza dough instead of bread dough.  I followed the instructions as written and it still turned out great.  I made three rolls and used a lot of different toppings.  Fun and yummy!

YUMMY! We have a really good pizza place called Big Lous here in San Antonio and they make pizza wraps which is similar to this recipe. My husband loved this! Next time I will try to stuff with more Mozzarella cheese dont be afraid to cause you dont think it will roll up!

Great recipe!  Be sure to follow the recipe guidelines in regards to the spices.  Once I added too much spice and it was a little too overbearing.

I use regualar rolls when I make this.  Any roll will do, and I have even used english muffins.  I mix all of the ingredients in a bowl and then spoon it on. I preheat my broiler, and pop them in.  They take 3 minutes and are just as yummy, if not better.

Excellent! Very easy to make, everyone loved it! I did sprinkle some garlic salt and cajun seasonings on top for some added falvor and color. Will make again this evening, since we ate the whole loaf last night. **Edited to add: I baked this again tonite and used pepperjack cheese and fresh slices of jalapeno in addition to the pepperoni and spices. It was delish--I may make it this way permanently!

SUGGESTIONS:  Want to cut the time from 12 hours to less than 2 hours?  Use pizza dough from the canned biscuit section of the grocery store.  It turns out softer and you don't have to thaw or let it rise.  I like the original crust better but have used the pizza dough and it works really well.  Also, I have made this with scrambled eggs, green pepper, cheese, and onions and I have made it with sausage, green pepper, onion, mozarella and spread Dijon mustard on the inside of the bread dough.  I have always had people wanting the recipe.

Delicious recipe that was easy to make.  I used homemade pizza dough (Jay's Pizza Crust recipe from this site) instead of frozen dough.  I added red pepper flakes to the seasoning mixture.  I made a large batch of these one day to freeze to have for later.  They froze well and tasted great when baked.  Served with marinara sauce on the side.

I use the Kroger frozen bread, turns out great. Instead of the separate spices I just sprinkle Italian Seasoning to make it easier. Do seal up the seams so cheese doesn't ooze!

Excellent recipe. I used fresh minced garlic along with the oregano and basil (skipping the onion flake)and put half of the cheese before the pepperoni and the other half after. I should've listened to other reviewers and rolled a little tighter. Still turned out great and was delicious!

I made mine with fresh bread instead of frozen and it was a big hit with family but even with herbs was missing something.  Not sure what but it was a little bland for me.  Still made a great lunch and everyone at work wanted to try it.

This bread is amazing...my hubby says better than any pizza place!  Everyone asks for the recipe and it is so simple too!  I don't bother with the egg but follow everything else exactly.  So delicious!

Excellent recipe with lots of flavor. I followed the advice of other cooks and put the cheese on first. I used a como of Grinder's Italian seasoning and another blend. Will make this recipe again and again. So easy and delicious!

Easy to make and really delicious.It makes a great Friday night dinner. We incorporated this recipe into our weekly menu. It tastes so much better than pizza. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This was fantastic!  Super easy to make--I didn't have some of the spices so I just sprinkled on some minced garlic(in olive oil) and whatever else I could find in the cupboard.  You can also omit the meat entirely--and serve it as cheese bread.  Delish!  This is my new favorite!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I took this to a friend's house and it was a hit.  My husband told me I could make it ANY TIME!  I used only one layer of pepperoni and then added about 1 cup of chopped/cooked Italian Sausage.  I added about 1/4 freshly grated parmesan cheese and did not have the onion flakes, so I sprinkled with garlic powder.

I've made this three or four times, and it's always a hit at parties. The best part is that it is so easy. I always put the cheese on before the pepperoni, but regardless - this is a great recipe.

I use pizza crust made in my bread machine for this.  It is very good, easy, and I always get good compliments.  Good to take as appetizer/potluck.

I've been making this recipe for awhile now and it's extremely easy!!! I make 3 to 5 loaves in a batch...if you put them all in the oven at the same time (which i do 3 at a time) just keep an eye on them but i let them bake a few minutes longer.  Instead of taking different spices and measuring them, I use the italian seasoning on both the inside and outside of the bread..careful can be overpowering but definitely gives it some nice flavor. i have also made this with ham and hot pepper cheese and salami and swiss cheese. BOTH very good!!!!

This recipe was really good and easy to make.  I used my bread machine to make the dough (1 pound of italian bread dough).  I  sprinkled some crushed red pepper flakes on it along with the other spices.  I baked it for exactly 35 minutes and then served it with pizza sauce for dipping.  My son, who loves pepperoni rolls, thought it was great.

WOW. THESE ARE GOOD. Made as written except I added a 1/4 c of pizza sauce to the filling.  It kept it from drying out.  These baked up big and full. Make sure to get the egg wash down the side of the bread.  I also made diagonal cuts across the top of the loaf before baking.    Made one with pepperoni and one without. Both were great. Used the extra pizza sauce for dipping.  One word of caution. I made these for dinner and they sat like a load of bricks in the stomach!! LOL. if making for dinner serve with a salad.  As an appetizer for many people? Perfect.

This is a great base for a recipe.  Instead of complaining about what was missing and what I added I must give the author credit for their recipe.  I added what I knew my boys would like and all they could say was when can we have this again.  So to the person who posted this thank you.

So delicious! I couldn't find frozen bread at the grocery store...had to use frozen parker house roll dough and squish them together to form the dough rectangle...it worked though. And still tasted awesome.

I followed the recipe exactly except for putting a tad less seasoning on the bread.  I taste tested this tonight for a party I'm throwing and it got the thumbs up from my pepperoni loving husband.  I'm making an extra loaf to freeze for later!

This is a favorite!!!  I have made this more than a few times!! Excellent every time, I have made this original and have varied it..adding provolone or switching crumpled cooked sausage for the pepperoni!  Great with a side of marinara sauce and a salad!

My husband loved this; said it was like a homemade hot pocket!  I used refrigerated pizza crust to save time, and added some garlic powder to the spices.  I also spread some spaghetti sauce on the dough before adding cheese and pepperoni, as I was concerned it would be dry.  I cut my dough in half and made two rolls.  One my hubby ate right away, the other we froze.  The frozen one was just as delicious as the fresh one!  We will make again!

I made a pizza dough from scratch and used a combo of cheeses that I had leftover from a make-your-own-pizza party. I served it with some pizza sauce and my family thought it was a great, fun dinner night.

This was really good, but I only gave it 4 stars because I felt the oregano and basil overpowered the other tastes of the pepperoni and melted cheeses. I will make this again, but next time I will cut the seasonings in half.

WONDERFUL KEEPER!!!!
I used refrigerated pizza dough because I was short on time.
I used the suggestion to layer the cheese first then used pepperoni and mushroom slices.  Wrapped and baked.
It was gone before it had a chance to cool off.

SO good! Used refrigerated pizza dough (Pillsbury brand, I think) and baked it for about 5 fewer minutes, and it came out perfect. Will definitely make again for a quick, easy, and yummy appetizer or dinner for two with a side salad.

My first time making pepperoni bread and it turned out terrific!  I used frozen bread dough thawed overnight in the fridge.  I then proofed the dough 3 hours using a heating pad in the oven to get the temp to ~85°F.  I remember that trick from my grandmother and it worked awesome.  I rolled out dough then sprinkled seasoning first, cheese second and pepperoni last. Then I pinched shut and backed on aluminum foil seam down.  We served it with warm marinara sauce and it was a huge hit.  I'll likely be making this again very soon!

Not sure what happened but almost doubled cooking time and was still dough in the middle but burning in the outside.  Recommend reducing temp and increasing cooking time.

I used to make this years ago.  When I saw the recipe show up on a search it reminded me how good it is.  I did add a think layer of pizza sauce before I rolled it.  Husband and son love it too.  I'm thinking of doing another one with ham and swiss cheese.

I did make this and it is a winner!! I actually made two--one as the original recipe adding onions and mushrooms per my son. The second one as the original recipe but added onions, mushrooms, ham, green peppers and spinach. My family loves pizza with lots of veggies. It still rolled up very nicely with all the stuff.

I couldn't find frozen dough so I made a basic white recipe in my bread maker. I also added some sliced green olives and used marinara sauce as a side dip. Absolutely delicious.

Wow!  My family absolutely loves this recipe.  I have made this recipe several times now.  The first time we followed it exactly as written, but did add some herbs and Parmesan sprinkled on top which made for a beautiful presentation The recipe was such a hit, I wish I had made two loaves.  After reading reviews, I decided to try the recipe with refrigerated pizza dough, rather than the bread dough. My family did not like the recipe as well this way.  While it was certainly easier and came together very quickly, the pizza dough changed the texture of the finished product.  Now when I make it, I make two loaves, one for now and one for later. It makes a great after school snack. I haven't tried it yet with other fillings, but definitely plan to do so.

I used pizza dough and put olives, capers, sun dried tomatoes, and pepperoni through the food processor to form a thick paste. Next one I will replace the pepperoni with tuna. Using sweet dough and fruit filling one can make one for a desert'  It is so versatile.

Gave this 5 stars but only because I used the Focaccia Bread from this website instead of frozen bread. I also took others suggestion & added cheddar cheese for more taste. With the herbs in the Focaccia bread & adding a sprinkling more of basil, onion & garlic powder & oregano it really hit the spot.  I've given this new combination of focaccia/pepperoni bread to several others already.  Using the focaccia bread instead of frozen bread dough was also less time consuming & easier which is up my alley. There is no defrosting, rising for couple of hours & punching down dough. I wanted to try dipping in marina sauce but it went to fast. Good warm or cold & no need for any butter or dipping sauce.

I loved this bread! I browned some Johnsonville sweet Italian sausage and used it instead of the pepperoni and it was awesome! I followed the rest of the recipe as written except that I used the canned pizza dough as others suggested. I did not find it dry at all - but this could have to do with the extra fat that is added with the sausage.  Crunchy crust outside and soft and cheesy on the inside. And oh-so flavorful! What a great snack for a crowd - this was fantastic football watching fare but would also be perfect for a potluck. YUM!

Really great recipe, easier than making my traditional sausauge breads but just as good.  Used refrigerated pizza dough, pre-sliced pepperoni and also 4 slices deli ham, just because I had some. Used shredded mozz/cheddar mix and 2 slices of American cheese.  After brushing the loaf w/egg wash, sprinkled with dried onions & herbs. Really fabulous-my guests gobbled it up.

This is a GREAT recipe except we make it differently. We use Swiss cheese instead of mozzarella and we season with oregano, not onion or basil. I've made FIVE rolls before for my son's ski trip...needless to say the pepperoni rolls never made it to the mountain!! The basic idea of the recipe lends itself to many variations!

I made these for a Super Bowl party of adults and everyone LOVED them! There were none left and they're so easy!! I cooked mine ahead of time and then reheated these in the oven for 10 minutes with foil covering them.  Served with sauce on the side for the folks who wanted it.

I refrigerate the loaf and slice it up for my sons' school lunches.  It is the only sandwich they really like. The only thing I changed in this recipe is that I used the French Bread recipe from this site instead of frozen bread dough.  Delicious!

I LOVE this recipe. I've tried others on this site and always come back to this one. It's easy and versatile. I've altered it and made it with sausage, peppers and onions; mozzarella with sweet peppers, and even buffalo chicken strips with mozzarella. The only problem I have with this recipe is that no matter what I throw in there, I can never seem to make enough.

I compared several recipes before I decided this was the best one.  It has a lot of flavor and goes well with soups and spaghetti.  Make sure you look for the paper thin slices of pepperoni.  The thicker ones make it difficult to roll and may push through the bread.  I like to make this with one layer of pepperoni.  Some places I have purchased pepperoni bread have stacks of pepperoni.-

This recipe was very good, although it ended up looking more like flat stromboli than a loaf, but that may have had something to do with the cook ;) I will probably use this recipe again, but I will put out some marinara sauce for dipping next time.

Yummy!!!!  We loved it, made it for a special treat when the kids didn't have school.  My 7 yr old helped with it and she loved it.  Only change we made was instead of using the seasonings to sprinkle on the bread dough we use Tastefully Simple Dried Tomato and Garlic Pesto (made to directions).  We dipped it in warm pizza sauce and loved every bite.

This was easy and very very good.  Only change I made was to double the cheese and spinkle the top with basil for garnish.

too greasey!  i used to make this with my grandmother often as a child and we always chopped the pepperoni in the food processor first.  i tried it this way and will revert back to the way grandma did it -- it is so much less greasey.    also, i didn't like the beated egg on top.  it makes the loaf look crusty and nice, but you can taste it!

Really good and easy to make!   I made one just as the recipe is written - good.  I made another with red pepper flakes and banana peppers - really good!   Will definitely make again and again!   Thanks.

I used the dough for "Mama D's Italian Bread" for this recipe. It took about 40 minutes for the 'log' to get to the desired color. I placed mine on a rack on the baking sheet too, as some grease from the pepperoni seeped out while baking. Also, I used a parmesean, asiago, and romano cheese blend instead of mozz. and it turned out just fine. My husband suggested that I add some finely chopped tomatoes next time to add a bit of moisture to it.

The kids really enjoyed this but like it better when I add ham, and salami and make it a stromboli!  While I was in a hurry, I actually forgot to add the cheese!  Since I had the egg wash on I knew I could not unwrap it without making a mess.  I baked it anyway and the kids couldn't tell the difference.  Saved a few calories.  They dipped in pizza sauce.

Very good!
Actually thawed frozen bread in microwave b/c pressed for time. Added extra pepperoni & spices. Turned out great!
