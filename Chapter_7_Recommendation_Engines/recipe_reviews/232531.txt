So good! I love pink grapefruit juice and this was the perfect refreshing drink on this warm Labor Day weekend. My guests really enjoyed it too, well until we ran out of vodka! I made it exactly as written and wouldn't change a thing. By the way, regarding the other review, why on earth would you only give 4 stars because YOU didn't have the necessary ingredients!?!? Wow.

This was refreshing on a HOT summer afternoon! I do not have 'martini' glasses,I also didn't have the triple sec,  hence the 4 stars. This was very delicious non the less. Thank you KAC2!

Made as written, these were very good.  I liked the tartness from the grapefruit juice combined with the sweet of the triple sec and sugar.  I plan to make these again.

Very refreshing cocktail for Spring/Summer. If Iâ€™m a hurry(or no fresh grapefruits on hand) I use  Ruby Red grapefruit juice w pulp from refrigerated carton (Tropicana or similar brand).

Tasty!  I didn't use the sugar, my triple sec bottle was empty so I used OJ.  As good as this was it will be even better with triple sec! Thanks for a great recipe!  Update: I made a pitcher with triple sec to take on a camping trip. Vast improvement! Very yummy! Can be made with OJ but triple sec way better!

I cannot drink any citrus juice but I can do fresh squeezed.  I double this recipe and do not use the sugar rim.  It is delicious every time.  Reasoning behind doubling:  most ruby red grapefruit when squeezed results in 4+ ounces of juice.

I made it with Hendrick's Gin and used Sugar In The Raw with fresh squeezed Ruby Red Grapefruit juice.  Wow!  It was great!  Definitely will be made again.

Full disclosure- I made it with Sapphire  gin and Cointreau b/c I didn't have vodka or triple sec, but I had ruby grapefruit and a hankering for a nice cocktail I remembered having in Bend, Oregon years ago. Yum. Superfine sugar is best to use on the rim. enjoy!

Love it. Just a hint of orange and the right combination of grapefruit juice and vodka.
