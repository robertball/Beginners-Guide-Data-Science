I have been looking for this recipe for a long time. I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't scald the milk. (With modern pasteurization,  bacteria and enzymes are already destroyed, so scalding is no longer necessary. Also, it reduces the chances of cooking the egg as the ingredients are mixed). It was a very easy recipe to make. I just threw everything in the bowl, used a mixer for about 1 minute, poured it in the pie shell and popped it in the oven. Only one problem, I can never get more than one slice before it's all gone. Every person who tastes this pie wants the recipe and says it's the best they have ever eaten. Even the people who proclaimed they really didn't care for egg custard pie, changed their tunes rather quickly after the first bite. Thanks for this one!!!

MMMMMMM. I used a can of evaporated milk and added fresh milk to equal 2-1/2 cups. That was my mom's secret. Also added another yolk from the egg white wash. Rich and delicious. I forgot how easy it is to make custard pie. Use the Easy Pie Crust recipe on this site and you won't need to glaze the shell with egg white or roll it out. Super quick and easy. I'm going to make this pie often. Everyone has these ingredients on hand. Ovens vary in temperature, btw. Adjust baking time accordingly or lower temp. to 350-375.

This pie came out perfect! Silky, perfect custard! However, I read some reviews from others who seemed to have problems. No spongy texture if you add the scalded milk VERY slowly while whisking constantly. Also to prevent custard from going under shell, be sure and poke holes w/fork all over the shell including the sides FIRST to prevent bubbling. That would be for any pie recipe.

WOW!!! I love Custard pie, but my attempts have never quite matched the one's at the pie-shop...until now.  My recipe for pie crust called for half an egg, so I threw the other half into the filling. I added the extra egg yolk (left over from the egg-white wash for the crust) to the filling as well, which made for a very rich and creamy filling!  It was the BEST!! I was a little nervous about spillover after pouring all of the filling into the crust as it came to the very brim, but nothing spilled over, and it made the most beautiful pie!!! A keeper!! :)

My partner couldn't believe that I could make something so good!  I like mine slightly sweeter, so I will add a smidge more sugar next time.  Also I found it helpful to place the pie pan on the oven rack before filling up to the top, to avoid spillage.

This is a nice, simple pie.  Just waiting for your choice of toppings.  We used carmel sauce and strawberry couli.  For those who think this tastes like scrambled eggs, you must temper the eggs before incorporating the scalded milk.  Makes a huge difference in result of the pie.  Also if you want to make it richer and really dress it up add an extra yolk and half and half or cream for some of the milk.  Thumbs up!

This pie brought back memories of my childhood! I cheated and used a frozen pie crust, the egg white (used the extra yolk in the mix) kept the crust from getting 'gummy' but next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will bake it a little first. I covered the pie edges with foil just in case. I had left over heavy cream so substituted 1/2 cup of that for some of the milk. Add the scalded milk very, very slowly to your egg mixture or otherwise the eggs cook and scramble, and that's why it will taste 'eggy.' I had no problems with water pooling in pie pan - maybe those people had condensation issues, so make sure your pie is cool before placing in fridge. The custard is delicious - it tastes almost like vanilla creme brulee! Thanks for the great recipe!

You can easily turn this terrific recipe into one for Coconut Custard Pie with the addition of 1 cup of shredded coconut just before pouring into the pie shell. When I did this, though, I found that baking time needed to be increased to 40 minutes.  I made it as my contribution on Thanksgiving and my entire family loved it!!!

This was my first time making a pie. my mother couldn't make pies so I never learned how to make them. My husband had never had custard pie before so I thought "why not make one for him". I looked through a lot of custerd pie recipes and this one seemed pretty easy and yummy. So I made it and it turned out perfect. It was silky not spongy and didn't taste like scrambled eggs. I had tempered the eggs like a previous review had suggested doing and I also added the egg yolk left over from the egg wash. I baked it longer then the time had suggested, I think I baked it like 20 minutes longer (I can't exactly remember). I had at first thought I had over baked it but when me and my hubby ate later it was perfect. Not watery or having a "crust" on top or anything wrong. I was so proud of myself.

Tasted just like my grandma used to make!  I had to increase cooking time to 40 minutes.  When I cut into my pie, it was slightly watery (clear fluid), but I drained the excess water off and was left with a great pie!  Maybe I didn't let it cool sufficiently enough before I cut it - I was just too anxious to dig in!

After reading the disasters, here are some hints:Only brush Egg Whites on Sides and Bottom, not Edge.  If you are above sea level, cooking takes longer,pie will be drier. Pie shells vary, use the deepest you can find. If you bake on a sheet,or a stone, cooking takes longer.  If you crust burns or is dark, make a shield out of foil. Try pre-cooking the crust some to prevent soggy crust. If you experiment w/ different milks, you deserve a strange result ! Is your oven temperature correct, get a seperate thermometer. Try reducing the temp or use a water bath or tray of water. If you skip scalding, cooking time will increase and/or affect the consistency.  I had problems using regular depth crust, there was too much liquid so I divided it between 2 shells, a regular and a deep. The regular was not filled enough to allow browning on the surface, and was to rubbery, the deep shell filled to the bottom of the scrollwork, jelled nicely and was a nice brown. I did drop the temp to 350 because of over browning of the crust.  I think full scalding of milk is required to bring the ingredients up to temp to reduce cooking time, and possibly use a foil shield to prevent dark crust.  I am cooking at about 20' above sea level.  Both pies were edible, the smaller was not brown due to the shallow depth of the filling. The larger was browned nice,crust overdone, shielding needed. When I checked for done-ness, I simply gave a slight jiggle, and center jiggled firm.

VERY disappointing. I followed the recipe verbatim and ended up with watery custard and nearly burnt crust edges. In search of another recipe.

Excellent recipe -- to prevent a soggy crust pre-bake your pie crust and brush with the recommended egg white. Let your pie cool on a wire rack so circulation can get under the pie. If your custard becomes watery, it is because it was overcooked and liquid was forced out of the egg protein (temps and times on ovens vary so cook a little less next time). You should end up with a rich and silky filling. I added a TBS of flour since I like my custard a little firmer. Really great flavor!

I love this recipe because I used skim milk, never made a custard pie before... and it STILL turned out FABULOUS! I love buying these pies, so being able to make them with ease is such a treat. I used an extra half teaspoon of vanilla, and a bit more nutmeg. I also added in the leftover yolk from the egg white wash. Like I said, I only had skim milk in the fridge and it still held firm. Delicious :)

Here's the scoop people, I have read almost every review on the recipe and the bottom line is, you only need to change one thing. DO NOT BRUSH THE CRUST WITH EGG WHITE!!! It will only cause your crust to burn. As far as the ingredients go, do not change or add anything and bake the pie for exactly 40 minutes in a deep pie dish. I made this recipe twice in the last two weeks. I changed things up such as adding the extra egg yolk and not filling the crust much because people said it boiled over. My first pie was a disaster. It was thin and the crust burned and it was too eggy. The second time it was perfect! Nice and thick, golden brown crust and by not adding the extra egg yolk, it was the perfect color and not too eggy. A deep pie dish is the way to go. Hope you all have as good of luck as I did.

It was really a great pie but I learned from my greatgrandma that you can put a dusting of cornstarch in the bottom of the pie crust to keep it from being soggy instead if egg white.

This recipe makes a fantastic frozen custard- it's super rich and smooth and totally ruined my ever wanting store-bought vanilla ice cream again.  This is way easier than trying to do frozen custard the traditional way, and ensures there won't be any sketchiness around uncooked eggs.  I just baked it with no crust, blended it again after baking to keep it smooth, and froze it!

I love custard pie. My mom and grandmother, both from the south, knew how to make a mean custard pie. I misplaced their recipe so I found this one when I needed something ASAP and didn't have time to look. This recipe tastes almost identical to their recipe. It's very good, but does need a bit more time to cook and set. If you leave less than 5 stars because the pie didn't set up correctly, etc. it isn't the recipes fault, sorry to say. It's the chefs. You need to be careful when adding the scalded milk; add slowly. Beat egg mixture well and don't open the oven door to peek! you will have a wonderful and delicious pie!

Great recipe! I didn't have any issues with it at all. I do recommend that you use a deep dish pie crust if you buy pre-made. I always used the pet ritz brand. The recipe makes enough custard batter to fill the deep dish crust up to the VERY top. I started with room temp eggs & did temper the egg mixture with a couple ladles full of the scalded milk before I added the remaining milk. My pie turned out just as a custard should with a silky smooth filling. I did increase the baking time to 40 minutes. The pie was still bubbling after 40 minutes, but I did insert a knife & it came out clean. So don't accidently overbake, thinking it's not done.

Overall it's okay.  I did use the extra yolk in the custard and evaporated milk.  Judging by the pictures of this pie I liked my crust to be more brown, so I prebaked it, but continued as usual with the rest of the directions.  I've read some of the reviews and a lot of people mentioned watery and rubbery pie. It's because the eggs are getting overcooked and it's letting out all the liquid.  I baked it at a lower temp around 375F and I watched until the center jiggled. Take it out then as it will continue to cook out of the oven. Hope the tips helped.

This was my first time making this kind of pie. I read some of the reviews and took some of the information and used it. I DID NOT SCALD the milk, i used it cold out of the refrigerator and used whole milk. I also added 1 teaspoon of lemon extract to the recipe with the vanilla extract. I DID NOT brush the crust with egg white. I used a 9" deep dish frozen pie shell. I baked it at 400 degrees in a electric oven. I started to get a little worried when after 35 minutes it was not set, but my husband who is german and learned about baking from his grandmother told me to just keep baking it longer in the oven. I baked it on a cookie sheet for 1 hour and 5 minutes. It was still kind of jiggly, but when i inserted a butter knife in the center and it came out clean i knew it was done. It came out wonderful and was like the pies my great grandmother used to make. Don't be afraid to experiment. Now that i know how to make this, i will make it often.

Can you say: "Super quick"? If you are in a time crunch but need a quick, tasty dessert, then you have found your miracle recipe! This was super quick and easy to prepare. 

I followed the recipe and tweaked it a little per the other reviewers. I used a frozen pie crust and let it thaw slightly but also poked the crust with a fork and used a egg white wash for the golden crust result. I also added the extra egg yolk to the custard mixture. I used 1% milk and had no problem with texture (and I didn't scald the milk either and just merely blended the ingredients with a hand mixer).

The pie was light and not overly sweet and almost flan-like. My boyfriend and neighbor loved it! A winner!

This pie was good, but a little to "eggy" for my family.  To avoid the crust being overdone, I baked it on the lowest rack, this helps the bottom of the pie to not be soggy, and keeps the top from browning too much.  Reading the reviews, I think it would be a very good base for adding Coconut, for a Coconut Custard pie.  I will say the texture was very nice and smooth, but just couldn't get beyond the "eggy" taste.

i must have done something seriously wrong, because this recipe did receive such positive reviews.  i took the advice of others who said the scalding step was unnecessary, and made it otherwise as written.  my pie never set - i baked it almost an additional hour but still had egg custard pudding, not pie.  probably won't try again, but i'm not sure what i did wrong anyway.

I tried this pie for dinner tonight.  It was everything promised and more.  As per other suggestions, I used two teaspoons vanilla extract and the remaining yolk from brushing the crust in with the other eggs.  I didn't use the food coloring, as I didn't think it needed it.  I also used a 12 ounce can of carnation milk for part of the 2 1/2 cups of milk.  The rest I used whole milk.  I did use a purchased 9 inch deep dish crust, which I usually don't use, but it turned out great!  My husband really liked it.  As per the purchased crust directions, I baked my pie on a preheated cookie sheet, which also helped make it minimal cleanup.  I would most definitely make this again.  Thanks for everyone's input in the few changes that I did make.

The flavor is wonderful! but i had 2 frozen REGULAR sized pie crusts and it took BOTH of them.  So...it probably should be noted that a deep dish pie crust/pan is needed.

Have never made a custard pie but hubby and father-in-law wanted one for Christmas. This was just like they remember family members making. Made just like written only used 12 oz can evap milk and used 1/2 and 1/2 to make up 2 1/2 cup milks. Warmed in microwave. Pre baked my homemade pie crust before adding filling and baked in a water bath. They are already asking when I plan on baking another one:)

Very good pie.  I used 1 can of evaporated milk the second time I made this and used milk to make up the difference and liked that better.  I didn't scald the milk either....waste of time.  Very easy to make.

came out beautiful with some tweaks in the recipe.  accidentally added 1 TABLESPOON instead of 1 teaspoon of vanilla and used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. did take the advice of a baking in a bath water (used a shallow pizza dish) - 400 for 30 mins. and then 350 for 10-15 mins. did have extra filling due to shallow store bought pie crust but good idea w/ the egg white coating.  it was better tasting if you cooled and chilled it before serving it. PLEASE add the scalded milk SLOWLY into the sugar/egg mixture.

I followed every instruction for this recipe.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and tempered the egg mixture so that the scalded milk will not cook the eggs.  The pie was consistent and kept firm after i cooled it completely at room temperature...so i didnt have a problem with it building too much liquid.  But the reason why i give this only one star is although i didnt make the pie taste "eggy" when i was taking the bites...the aroma smelled very much like boiled eggs and it just turned me off from the pie and didnt make it very appetizing to me and although my boyfriend usually makes everything i bake...he immediately said "no" when i asked him to take another bite ;P.

Very yummy! I used 1 can of evaporated milk and then added whole milk to equal 2 1/2 cups. I cooked for 30 minutes. I let it come to room temperature and then chilled overnight in the refrigerator. Before serving, I let it come to room temperature again...perfect results!!!

This was so easy.  I had some pie dough I had frozen so I was able to throw this together in no time.  I didn't scald the milk and it worked beautifully.  I added fresh vanilla caviar (It will rise to the top) but it enhanced the vanilla flavor.

This is the first custard pie I have ever made and I absolutley love it.  Made it for Christmas, and it was a hit.  I am new at cooking, and I like to create and experiment... SO--- I thought I'd share my success:) I made one delicious regular, and one egg nog one. For the egg nog one, I mixed the 3 beaten eggs, 1 tsp. vanilla, and a dash of salt (the egg nog had plenty) and I cut the sugar in half (a teeny bit more than 3 oz.) Then added 2 1/2 cups of egg nog (not scalded). Mix, Mix, Mix. And before I beat my eggs, I just took a little bit of the egg whites and spread on my lightly forked pie crust (I didn't see the need to waste an egg). Preheated my oven, and took out a cookie sheet (about a half inch deep), and put my pie in it.  The mixture fits perfectly in the pie crust.  Then I carefully put the cookie sheet (with the filled pie) in the preheated oven. Then I poured water into the cookie sheet so the bottom was barely covered (a little less than 4 cups).  It was done in 30-35 minutes.  When the timer went off, I stuck a clean knife in the center.  When it is done, the knife is wet and clear with maybe a teeny ball or 2 of egg. Cooled completely on rack, then covered in fridge.  So good :) And easy :)

This is a truely delicious pie.  I have made six now and my husband can't seem to get enough of them.  I didn't use scalded milk, I used a combination of evaporated milk and 2%.  I did however have to do some research on the cooking of custard.  I found that cooking my pie in a water bath did wonders for keeping the pie from over cooking aroung the edges.  The texture came out much more creamy this way.  This is truely a wonderful pie, thank you Marles!

I tried this recipe because of the great reviews, but it did not turn out well for me at all --  burnt, curdled, soggy.  I'm thinking 400 degrees is too hot for a custard...?

You'll know your custard pie is done when you stick a butter knife in near the middle and it comes out clean.  This recipe is absolutely fantastic!  My pie is just like my dad's from growing up in Oregon!

I used a pre-made raw crust that I rolled out, brushed with egg white, and baked for a few minutes to prevent from getting soggy. I tossed the extra egg yolk into the mix and added an extra teaspoon of sugar. I also scalded the milk and slowly poured it into the egg mixed with a hand mixer blending it all together as I went. This created a rather thick frothy layer on top of the liquid, but I was able to scoop out the froth and still have plenty of liquid left over to fill the 9" pie pan. I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg. The texture came out great-- very smooth and silky, great flavor. However, there was a layer of water underneath the custard layer that basically ruined the crust. ): I think it may be because I used 2% milk, I'm not sure. Next time I'll reduce the sugar a little bit because it came out too sweet for my taste, and I'll try different milk variations.

This recipe is a definite keeper! I should have followed the advice of others who have added an extra yolk to the filling.(the yolk went to waste) My whole family just love this recipe. Everyone had second helpings. Don't worry about the amount of filling. It was just rite. Did not over flow at all. covers the crust up to the brim. Thank you for the recipe!

Egg Custard is my mom's favorite pie so I decided to start making them for her a little while back. This is the recipe I use and it's always been wonderful. Now I'll admit that now I do add an extra teaspoon (2 tsp instead of 1) of vanilla but if you are happy with one that's great too. The pies have always come out with a wonderfully smooth and creamy texture. This recipe has never failed me until this Christmas.  I tried something different that another reviewer suggested. She said you don't have to scald the milk. This year I didn't scald the milk and even though the pie taste fine the texture is like really fine wet scrambled eggs. The texture is a real problem for me.  So to me I'd sum it up by saying SCALD the milk and pour very slowly into the sugar and egg mixture. Do not take that short cut.

I LOVE this pie!  I use all evaporated milk (no scalding) I add my egg yolk of the egg white that I using to coat my crust with to the custard mix ( I hate to waste) and I opt not to use the dye.  My family loves it.

I made this twice.  The first time I scalded the milk and it turned out perfect.  The second time I made it I put the milk in without warming it up.  The pie rose higher but it didn't cook as well as the 1st time and there was quite a bit of watery moisture at the bottom of the pan.  I don't know if this has to do with not heating up the milk but I'll take the 5-minutes next time to scald it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Amazing flavor!  I wish i'd read the reviews about how to keep it from turning into a sweet egg dish though, lol!  It wasn't creamy at all, very eggy and spongy.  But i think i will try this again and pour my scalded milk in real slow next time.  I can't blame the recipe for my lack of knowledge.  :)

I have never made custard pie before, and I dont even like it, but my mother absolutely loves it.  i made this one for her and she said it is the BEST.  I followed the advice of others and baked in a water bath, added almost 1 TBSP of vanilla, used the egg yolk from the egg washand I used half milk and half 1/2&1/2, instead of all milk.  Be sure to add the milk SLOWLY, very important tip!! Otherwise the eggs start cooking from the hot milk.I also recommend the deep dish crust, was just the perfect amount.  My mom, who is a very small woman, eats this entire pie in 2 days when I make them for her.  Also, for whatever it's worth, my mom SWEARS that good custard is the best thing to eat when you have problems with an ulcer.

Very good! I had leftover heavy cream that I used along with 2% milk to equal the 2 1/2c. Also used vanilla infused sugar. I also tossed the yolk from the egg white wash into the egg/sugar mix (waste not). Very simple to make and it is all stuff you have on hand!

Would NOT set. Cooked for an hour then let cool completely. I think there are multiple problems:

1) You need to specify whole milk.
2) Two and a half cups of milk should take at least four eggs, if not five.
3) This recipe fills two 9" crusts all the way to the brim. One? HA!

LOOK NO FURTHER!! Stop right here! I never made an egg custard pie before, but love them. I JUST tried this recipe yesterday for Thanksgiving. PERFECT! WONDERFUL! THANK YOU! The only thing I changed was I added an extra egg yolk, (so as not to waste the one from the egg whites one) and I didn't scorch the milk. I read the review as to why that was done a long time ago, so thank you for that too. 
PERFECT! This is going into my family recipe book...an honored spot! :-)

I tried this in Nov 2010 as a test to see if this would be a good pie to add to our Thanksgiving meal. My husband was begging for a custard pie for several years but I figured it would be to hard to make so I was dragging my feet for far to long. lol I found this recipe and thought I might could do this after I read some of the reviews. I took the advise to use condensed milk and whole milk, no need to scald milk at all. My husband LOVED it!!!! It is now 2011 and I've made this every week since Nov 2010. If you are chicken to make this Don't be it is so simple! Give it a try!!! There should be more stars but I could only give it 5. Enjoy!

I was excited to make this pie and the flavor was good but it never achieved a "cheesecake" consistency that I like. It was very soft like firm pudding. My nanny gave me a secret she mixes a tablespoon of flour into the mix. I may try it next time.

Used 2 vanilla beans in lieu of the vanilla extract. Wonderful flavor. Not "eggy" at all. Did add the extra yolk as suggested by others.  Even better with whipped cream. I would probably use evaporated milk or play with it to make it a little more dense (as that suits our family's taste's a little better), but it definitely has a "custard" consistency so it's perfect in that regard if that's what you are looking for, don't change a thing!.I baked for 45 min. like a lot of other reviewers mentioned. I need to work on my crust making skills, but the filling was terrific and I will definitely make again!

I made this for my stepmother's father, who loved it. I thought it was too eggy, and the crust was soggy even though I coated it with egg white. Might be better with cream instead of milk.

Thank you for this recipe.  It is just like my grandmothers.  It is so important to add the scalded milk to the egg mixture s-l-o-w-l-y.  I dribble small ladles of it while stirring constantly.  It took quite a bit longer for mine to cook, but it turned out beautifully.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I added an extra egg yolk and used 1/2 milk and 1/2 half and half.  Make sure your eggs sit out of the fridge for a while before adding the milk mixture this will make the pie super creamy.  Everyone LOVED this pie!  Someone else brought two custard pies from the amish house to the same get together and everyone LOVED this one much better! 10 stars!!

PERFECT! Not too sweet, great texture and crust remained crispy in a glass pie dish. I doubled the recipe to make two pies and it was the exact amount needed for two 9 inch pies. I replaced the milk with equal amounts of cream and half & half for a richer flavor. This is a keeper for sure!

My boyfriend loves Custard Pie and says this is the best he's ever had.  I'm not usually too fond of this type of pie, but I thought it was excellent.  I added the extra egg yolk and beat the mixture in my electric mixer until light and fluffy, before adding scalded 1/2 & 1/2, instead of milk.  I used a frozen 9" deep dish pie crust and had a small amount of the mixture left over.  Probably from beating it, rather than just mixing it.  This is a definite keeper!

I made this for a 76-year-old woman I am taking care of. She said her mom used to make it all the time and she said it was pretty close. I would definitely make it again. However, next time I will fill the pie pan in the oven because carrying it over resulted in spilling all over the pan. It was a very smooth texture and it didn't taste like scrambled eggs at all. Thank you for this recipe.

I grew up in the midwest (Lincoln, NE) and my Grandma Chadd made the best pies.  This is a GREAT and easy recipe - perfect.  I did add 1 extra egg yolk and a liberal grating of nutmeg on top.  It fits perfectly in a 9-inch shell, so I am not sure what others were doing wrong. This is authentic and delicious - will be my standard recipe from now on.

Just like my mom makes, true traditional custard pie.  I used Wholly Wholesome frozen pie shell, sprinkled corn starch in the bottom of the shell and baked for about 8 min prior to adding custard.  I covered edge of crust with foil.  I used one small can of evaporated milk and the remainder with reg milk.  We like our pie a little sweeter so I added one extra T of sugar.  Perfect custard pie.

Easy and tasty!  My friends loved it.  Instead of 2.5 cups milk, I used 1.5 cups of fat-free milk and 1 cup of half-and-half.  I did not scald it.  I also threw into the batter the extra egg yolk that was separated from the egg white used for brushing the crust.  This one is a keeper!

I just made this pie, and haven't cut into it, but it smells yummy.  I just wanted to say I also had to cook this pie 55 mins., as someone else had mentioned it.  Not sure why the big variation in time cooking from 35 mins. would happen.  Don't know if it makes any difference, but I cook with gas.  I used a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk and the rest 2%.  I was skeptical of this fitting into a regular 9 in. crust, it didn't, so I had to use a deep dish pan.

This was so delicious! I have never made a custard pie before and this was so easy! Custard pie is my father’s favorite and he absolutely loved it!! In fact, he said it was one of the best he has tried and he’s tried a lot. I took some advice from others by adding the extra yoke into the mix; made sure I added the scalding milk slowly and increased the cooking time by 15 minutes. When I put the toothpick in, it wasn’t all the way clean but knew you shouldn’t over cook so I took out after 45 minutes. The pie was delicious the first night but even better the next day cold. Thank you very much for this recipe, it is definitely a keeper! I was wondering if you had a lemon bar recipe or if you knew of a good recipe. This is another favorite of my dad’s.

A tasty pie, very easy and fast to whip up. My only complaint is that it made way too much for one pie crust - had to fill two. But on the whole, nice pie!

I forget how much I hate egg custards. So when making the scorched milk, I added a vanilla bean, halved and scraped. Picked out the pods while waiting for the milk to cool. Made the custard and it was enough filling to fill 2 pie crusts with. Then baked it and had to bake it longer then said while the crust was burning. So the second one I baked, I covered the crust with foil to prevent burning and also turned down the heat. When I finally had a taste, it tasted like scrambled eggs with a vanilla taste. The pie crust was good though because all the vanilla beans fell to the bottom and settled on the crust. I'm still looking for a recipe that will make me like egg custard pies.

This was fantastic! I have tried several custard pies in an effort to find one my husband would approve of, and this was it. I made 2 small changes. I used 4 eggs instead of 3 and used 1 1/2 cups of heavy cream for part of the milk. These gave a silky texture that was incredible. I used the rest of the cream to make another one. The crust did terrific and the filling did not separate. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was amazing!! It didnt last more than 2 days in my house.  The recipe makes too much filling to just make one pie, but easily makes two standard pie crusts (might do one if you use a deep dish).  I also cooked mine at 300 degrees for longer because the top started to scorch before it was set.  Definatley a keeper!

My husband's favorite pie is Custard.  I was always afraid to try it because I thought it was too hard.   NO WAY  and he said this is the BEST he has ever tasted.  Since trying this recipe I have made 6 of them.  One pie only lasts one day with him around, I get maybe 1 1/2 pieces and he gets the rest.   Highly recommend this recipe.

Best so far....very smooth and tasty.  Next time I will use a little less sugar, but my family still gobbled it up.  I baked in a water bath, so had to leave it in the oven for just a bit longer and also omitted the food coloring.  This one is a definite keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly. I had to bake it for 45min.
 and lowered the temp to 350 because the crust was starting to burn and the filling was not getting done, finally I lowered to 300 and baked at least 15 min. more.

A dear friend made a passing comment that he would like an egg custard pie like his mother used to make (his mother passed away last year).  I searched and searched for an Egg Custard recipe--I finally found it.  Easy and delicious.  
The word "Grandma's" suits this recipe--that's what memories are made of.

I was looking for an old custard pie recipe to make for my father and this was very easy and good.  Not too sweet and not too egg tasting.  It was exactly what I was looking to make....

I have always loved Custard Pies and had to buy them, didn't do pies, and very hard to find. Just a couple of years ago (my early 50's), learned how to make pie crusts, so was looking for recipes when ran across this and tried it. BEST Custard Pie I have ever eaten and very easy to make. Recipe not complicated and easy to follow instructions. As I'm the only one who likes Custard Pies, have to be very careful not to make very often as I find it's gone in 24 hours and no one to blame but myself.

Great pie! Tasty and really easy to make. One word of advice though...eat it all within 24 hours. Otherwise it starts to get a little watery.

I was going for something like the egg tartlettes they serve at chinese restaurants, and I must say this recipe turned out pretty well. It wasn't too sweet, and the consistency was okay too. But I always have way too much filling left--something like 1/3 gets left over!! Besides, even if it could all fit into my 9 inch pan, I don't think I'd want the custard layer to be that thick anyway. Also, my bottom crust ends up rather gummy; not as much soggy, but more like, damp? I tried putting lots of egg white on it, but I guess I'll have to try and bake the crust a bit first.

This is the first review I've ever done for anything in my life, except for a product on Lush.com that I absolutely loved to death. This pie is the edible version of that. First off, let me say that I'm the kind of person who substitues ingredients willy nilly (also because I don't drink regular milk, use all-purpose flour, or have a lot of ingredients most normal people have in their kitchen). Most of the time it works just fine, maybe because I've done it enough times to know when it's a good idea/bad idea. For this recipe, I used unsweetened original almond milk (not scalded) in place of scalded cow's milk, forgot the nutmeg (intended to use it but I was so anxious to get the thing in the oven I plum forgot), and used the recipe for Easy Pie Crust on this website as suggested by another reviewer (in that recipe, I completely substituted all-purpose for whole wheat, olive oil for veg... still turned out great). I used the leftover yolk in the custard mixture as others did, and it was awesome. I did have to leave it baking in the oven longer than 35 minutes (maybe 20 minutes longer, if not more), although I'm sure that's why I got the wateryness other reviewers have experienced. I also left the pie in the oven after i turned off the heat, because it was jiggling like a jello monster and I was worried it would never set. Anyway, once it totally cooled down and I was brave enough to stick a knife in it, I ate the entire thing. Seriously. Holy cow, delicious.

This is no question the worst egg custard pie I've ever made or eaten.  It has almost no flavor and it not at all creamy, it's actually very lumpy.  I followed the recipe exactly, I don't know how you guys said it was good.  I am tossing this into the trash, sadly it is that bad.

Like another poster, I used the extra egg yolk in the pie filling.  It turned out great, but I had to cook it for almost an hour to get it to set.  At 35 minutes, it was still 90% liquid with ripples on top.  The oven is accurate; there's a thermometer in it.

I don't know who in my family made this growing up, but making this recipe brought back the flavor.  It was so easy, I had all of the ingredients on hand which was nice.  I made it at night and ate it the next day and it was fantastic!  I did take the advice of using one can of evaporated milk then fresh milk to the 2 1/2 c.  Great!

I have had no luck with custard pie , usually the pastry is soggy or the custard curdles but this recipe is fantastic. I made it for company dinner on Boxing Day and it was a big hit with everyone.
I baked it in a glass pie plate at 375 for 40mins  and let it cool on the counter most of the day--Perfect..

Many older recipes called for you to scald milk, that is, to bring it nearly to a boil (185°F, 85°C, or more), preferably in a thick-bottomed pan, and stirring actively, to keep a protein skin from forming on the surface and keep the proteins and sugar from sticking to the bottom. Scalding served two purposes, to kill potentially harmful bacteria in the milk, and to destroy enzymes that keep the milk from thickening in recipes. Pasteurization, however, accomplishes both of those goals, and since almost all store-bought milk in Western countries is pasteurized these days, scalding is essentially an unnecessary step.  (from http://www.ochef.com)

Great recipe.  Using the egg whites on the crust is definitely beneficial.

I made this recipe again and this time I couldn't get every bit of the mixture into the crust but it was fine I brushed with egg white on the crust and it didn't burn just nice golden brown :) I also bought the unbanked pie crusts in the freezer aisle and I used the extra yolk from the egg white and put it in the mixture. Turned out wonderful. Just slowly stir in the scalded milk if that's what you use. Delicious!

Excellent custard pie.  For a really crisp crust, bake in a ceramic pie plate. That is the secret to avoid a soggy crust.  Aluminum foil pie pans do not conduct and hold the heat like ceramic does. The end result is amazing.

Nice pie and was well received at a dinner tonight. I was hoping it would have been a little firmer. I baked it for about 50 minutes and it was still rather loose in the middle. I did do it as written and will probably try it again some day.

My husband loves egg custard, but every recipe I tried was not as good as his mother made.  She is gone now so is her recipe.  This he says is better than his mother made.  We love this pie.

Really, really delicious, beautiful texture and wonderful egg custard flavour, put the extra yolk into the custard, didn't scald the milk, so needed to bake about 15 min. longer, cut the sugar to a little over 1/2 a cup, a real keeper - thanks Marles

This was just awesome !! I changed it just a bit.. I didn't scald the milk, I added the egg yolk from the separated egg, and I used 1 can of evaporated milk=1 1/2 cups and 1 cup of heavy cream.  The consistency was PERFECT !!! I baked it for 36 minutes and it was shear perfection !!

Looks like my other review of this pie just disappeared. Weird. 

Anyhow, that review wasnt totally fair anyhow.  Unlike most pies, this one is best after it completely COOLED (which I didnt wait until it cooled to review.) I didnt much care for it warm though, too soggy/wet until it cools & firms.  Its not a sweet recipe though, so if you like 'em sweet you might wanna add another 1/4 C sugar.  Oh, and DEFINITELY use a DEEP crust!

To those who have attempted this pie with disasterous results may I humbly recommend you test your oven's temperature and it's ability to hold the temperature?  My experience with this recipe was rocky until I did this.  The first 3 times I made the pie (my changes to the recipe at the end of this posting) it was perfect - light with a silky texture.  Then, 3 in a row were just like sweet scrambled eggs.  I carefully checked my procedure for combining the ingredients, tempering the egg mixture and nothing had changed.  My husband suggested an oven thermometer to check the oven setting.  When I performed this experiment I discovered my oven did not reach 400F when the oven light went off.  I increased the oven temp guage knob until the thermometer read 400F.  However my oven temp fluctuated more than 55 degrees and the result was a pie with uneven texture and watery bottom crust.  My husband loved the first 3 pies so much he bought me a new countertop Breville convection oven (amazing tool!).  Each pie baked with the new oven at 400F for 30 min has had a perfectly browned crust while the filling has a light and silky consistency.  Now for my recipe changes: I do temper the eggs by stirring in a 1/2 ladle at a time. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup organic brown sugar and 1/4 cup dark maple syrup. increased the vanilla by 1/2 teaspoon and toss the leftover egg white wash and yolk into the egg mixture and mix in thoroughly before I pour it into the crust. Enjoy!

This recipe was really simple.  I made one with a crust and one without (to lessen calories), they were both delicious!  I used half splenda and it seemed a little to sweet, so I will lessen the sugar next time. I did not scaled the milk, I used all the ingredients right out of the fridge. I baked mine 40 min.

This recipe was too sweet for my taste and the baking temp was too high.  I ended up with watery custard and overly brown crust edges.  I'll go back to my old recipe.

My grandmother's egg custard sure didn't taste like this... This pie has a good taste, but it is REALLY sweet. I didn't like the texture, it was LUMPY even though I followed the recipe exactly. I don't think I will use this recipe again. Sorry.

A good custard pie. I halved the receipe (for one small pie dish). I made the pie crust using the base recipe for the best lemon bars on this site. I used 2 whole eggs and the yolk which came extra (as compared to 1 1/2 eggs). I also used a quarter cup of fresh cream. I poured the boiling milk very slowly into the batter, while whisking it. Hence didn't have any problems with the eggs getting cooked. I was also very generous with the vanilla and the nutmeg. The consistency was amazing. It came out really smooth. I give it only 4 stars because this recipe really needs a topping. You have got have a sauce or some kind of fruits with it. But a very good recipe

Yummy!  I used skim milk and it still came out silky and creamy. To prevent the crust from becoming soggy, prebake the crust for about 20 minutes then immediately brush bottoms and sides with egg wash and cool pie on wire rack. I also used 4 eggs instead of 3 and baked the pie in a water bath. The water bath caused an increase in baking time (20-25 minutes longer). To prevent crust from burning, cover exposed crust with foil.

What a wonderful recipe!  Custard is my mothers favorite pie.  She thought this
custard pie was the best she ever had.
I added 4 eggs versus 3.  And used
2 cups of half N half..versus the milk.
I baked for 30 minutes.  Very creamy!!
Don't over bake this pie!  Also..
add the scalded milk to the egg mixture
VERY SLOWLY.

This is the recipe I was looking for!  I wanted a simple, perfect custard dessert recipe, and luckily found this one.  I follow it exactly, except for omitting the food color. If you use farm fresh local eggs from cage-free hens (or organic), the yolks have a much more vivid color than grocery-store factory-produced eggs, so the color of the finished custard is bright and lovely.   Sometimes I reduce the sugar to 1/2 c and serve it as a less-sweet breakfast treat.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and I have to say it was fantastic! I am now a bona fide Custard Pie lover!  I did pour my custard mixture through a strainer into the pie crust just to make sure there weren't any weird little cooked egg bits. Great, Great recipe- I'm putting it in my "To make again" file.

Simple, easy instructions for a perfect custard pie! I used 1 1/2 cups 2% milk and 1 cup half and half since I didn't have whole milk on hand.

I keep used vanilla beans in a jar of sugar and that's what I used for the 3/4 C of sugar. I added one teaspoon of vanilla and a whole vanilla bean scraped clean. (I love vanilla)

The idea of brushing the crust with an egg white is fantastic! This pie reminds me of my favorite Grandmother, it's terrific!

Recipe worked great for me, but mention needs to be made that it's for deep dish, not regular crust. Substituted egg nog for milk and cut sugar by 2/3; and now all the pies gone by the time it hits the table around the holidays.

I tried this pie and loved it. It tasted wonderful. I followed the directions except I added the yolk from the 4th egg into the pie mixture. Nest time I'm going to add some coconut and see how that turns out.

I followed the instructions with the slight exception of not scalding the milk. I mixed everything and poured it into my crust. It needed a full ten minutes more cooking time in my oven to set up but it did and it did it perfectly. A tad sweet for my taste but that's just me. Yummy, non watery or eggy tasting  pie perfection!

I was disappointed but don't know what I did wrong.  The custard curdled.  I think 400 degrees is to hot and long and it overcooked.

Took quite a bit longer to fully bake through than the recipe indicated. Although I will try this again, I won't coat the uncooked pie crust with egg white-I ended up with a burnt crust as well.  Fortunately, my husband doesn't mind a bit of well-done crust on his pies!

scalding the milk isn't too remove bacteria  or whatever.  the milk should be still warm.. as should the pie Shell. ( bake  first at 400  for  ten  minutes on a  sheet pan)  rhythm the oven down to 325.  temper the eggs  with the scalded milk.  pour the  warm egg/ milk  mixture into  hot pie  shell  while  it's in the oven.

I bake this at least once a month if not more for my husband.  Ever since the first one this is his favorite dessert.  It's easy and taste wonderful.  I use the easy pie crust from here too and it's a snap to pull this together.

It (mostly) worked but I didn't really like it.  It was too sweet and bland and I didn't care for the nutmeg flavor. The directions were vague, listing the egg white before the milk which made me think it was part of the egg mixture.  I don't think this made a big difference overall but it annoyed me.  Therefore I didn't egg white the crust and I also didn't scald the milk.  I made my own crust and it wasn't soggy.  It took 50 minutes to be "almost done" but still jiggly, and the recipe would have easily filled two 9" crusts baked in bakery sized aluminum pans.

I've never written a review but this pie was so awesome that I just had to write.  First of all I read all of the reviews looking for one that replaced all the sugar with maple syrup and I couldn't find any.  So first of all, I tempered the eggs and I scalded the half and half; I replaced the milk with half and half.  I used a home-made crust and baked it for 10 minutes before putting the custard in.  I covered the edge with foil so it wouldn't burn.  I used 1/3 c + 3 TBSP of maple syrup instead of sugar and made my own whipped cream using heavy cream and vanilla stevia.  I added a little cinnamon and baked it in a deep dish pie pan for exactly 35 minutes. IT WAS THE BOMB!!! TOTALLY AWESOME PIE!!!!

My husband grew up in the south and raved about his grandmother's custard pie. I, on the other hand, grew up in the Republic of Panama, and never heard of a custard pie.  So, I had to make this for him.  It was the absolute easiest pie ever!  He said it was one of his favorite things I've cooked to date.  I can see why this one the prize in all custards!  Thank you.  I will make this again and again, I'm sure. Did not change a thing and it came out so creamy and good.

I confess, I am the horrible reviewer who did not follow the recipe yet is rating it. I am only doing it for the sake of everyone out there who needs to know the results of the changes though. Just so you know, I hate it when people do this.
I used a can of coconut milk, a can of evaporated milk and stevia. Turned out great! Couldn't even taste the coconut milk, which is what I was hoping for.

This is a fabulous recipe!  Custard has been my favorite pie since childhood, but until this recipe I've always had trouble with custard weeping. (Though because I tweaked the recipe using suggentions of other reviewers, it took me awhile to make the pie as written here.  So even though I LOVE to tweak recipes I'll not be doing so with this one. The tweaked versions of this pie just aren't as good as the original recipe!) Thanks Marles for sharing!!

This was my first time making egg custard and it worked well and tasted great.  I made it for Father's Day as this is one of my Dad's favs.  He NEVER says anything is good, but did say this was!!  I did not scald the milk, but used it cold and used a combo of evaporated milk and 2% and it was fine.  I added what it called for on the sugar and did not think it was too sweet.  I did bake it longer than called for since at 30 minutes it was still really runny.  Ended up probably baking it 400 degrees for 50 min to 1 hour.

Exactly the recipe I was looking for! Smooth as silk and not too sweet. Yum! I added the leftover egg yolk and used whole milk (not scalded) and whisked like crazy. Perfect!

I used this recipe for my first egg custard. I also made a homemade pie crust for it, and it was delicious! Rave reviews from the family and they want me to make another today! It was very easy.

This turned out great, thanks.  Made my own crust.  Also mixed coconut milk with regular 2% milk, which added flavor, and used a vanilla bean instead of extract.  Made this for St. Patrick's Day so used green food coloring rather than yellow :)

My boyfriend's favorite pie is egg custard. I never made it before so I made this one, half way done and I realized I was out of vanilla, but I took my chances and made it without. Guess what he told me this was the best egg custard he has ever eaten and when could I make another. Thanks.

very good recipe for custard pie! I substituted almond and soy milk for the regular milk. I also added the extra yolk. I cooked the shell a bit before adding the filling. Husband proclaimed this the "best pie ever"!!!

This recipe is so important personally and professionally. My Grandmom (R.I.P.) made custard pies for my mother since childhood. When I used this recipe and brought her the pie, it brought her to tears because it is almost identical to her mom's. This is great practice for me because I can't stand custard! Sincere thanks for this recipe. I'll use it from now on.

I love custard of all kinds. This was too sweet, with no egg flavor.
My grandparents owned a diner back in the 60's and grandma made all the pies.  She would not have served this. I'll go back to her recipe and will never stray again.

Tastes great but took almost an hour to set when made exactly as the recipe states.  I have a thermometer in my oven-so I know the temp was right.  By the time it set it had a puddle of water in the middle-but I just dabbed it off with a paper towel and let it cool and room temp before putting in the fridge.

This pie is AWESOME!! I had never made custard pie before but I had tried custard and it didn't turn out right so I was nervous about this. I did everything as directed and it was delicious! My crust did stick to the pie plate which I don't understand and I had to cook it way longer than 35 min, probably about 20 min more. I will certainly be making this again!!

This is a lot like a Sugar Cream Pie that is popular in East Central Indiana.  The best ones are from Wick's or the old Durbin Hotel.

Excellent pie!  First of all, it uses everyday ingredients which is a huge plus!  No special trips to the grocery store.  Second, it was so easy to prepare.  My seven year old daughter practically made it by herself.  Third, the pie is delicious!  It is so light, not too sweet, and yummy!  A really nice change of pace from the heavier desserts I served over the holidays.

As written, it's WAY too eggy, and it had to cook much longer than the recipe stated.  We had regular size crusts (not deep dish), but both came out tasting like  smooth, sweet, scrambled eggs.    It has the potential to be really good, but it also has the potential to be a disaster on the first try.

Great recipe!  My twists: I just use some of the egg white before I beat the three eggs so no need for an extra egg white; and I just heat up the milk rather than "scalding" it, no need to risk pre-cooking the eggs!  Other than that, I follow it to a T and the family LOVES it!!!

Almost $10 of ingredients down the tube. This was a disaster. I used a deep dish pie crust, put a pan under it for spill over and it burned on the pan stinking up the oven. The crust dissolved (yes, I brushed it with egg white).

Have made this 4 times so far and it has turned out wonderful. I need to work on preparing the crust a bit better as it always comes to the surface while cooking but that is not an issue related to the recipe. It looks bad when I make it but it still tastes great.

The filling was slightly too sweet, it took about 40 minutes to bake, and it turned out to look like steamed egg. The egg whites also didn't prevent a soggy crust. To decrease the cooking time I'd suggest putting in less filling.

My only complaint is that the texture wasn't a thick(firm?) as I would have liked. I have a feeling this may have something to do with the fat-free milk I had to use. I bake my pies on a baking sheet that sits on a pizza stone so I didn't brush my crust with an egg white, but I did add an extra egg yolk to the custard. I also used vanilla sugar and added some cinnamon with the nutmeg. It smells delicious, and the taste is perfect. A hint of creamy egg flavor, and a nice sweetness from the vanilla and spices.

Baked exactly according to the directions.  I've been baking for almost 20 years, I shouldve stuck to my own recipe.  Took over an hour to bake, too much of an egg taste, the crust was burnt til it was done baking.  I will def be using my own recipe from now on

Love this recipe.  Came out perfect the very first time and I have never made a custard before.  No condensation.  My family and friends LOVED it.  I definitely will be making this one again and again.  Thank you so much.

Wow - have to say this was an awesome recipe! I got a little worried as I watched it cook based on the other reviews of it being to eggy and it started to bubble in that eggy way along the top ( I did the scalded milk route) BUT - it was amazing and my Southern raised aunt said it was by far the best she has ever had - which says a lot since my grandmother made amazing egg custard pie. I now have requests to make the egg and coconut versions for Easter. Thanks for this awesome recipe!!

I just made this egg custard pie.  It was EXCELLENT!  I read through the reviews and I pre-backed my pie shell and I added the extra yolk.  This came out exactly as I thought egg custard should taste like.  I think if you end up with scrammbled eggs, you haven't beat the eggs enough.  I beat the eggs with a whip and i beat them very well.  enjoy!

My husband and Daddy loved this pie.  It took a lot longer to cook than the recipe said - it just seemed like it didn't want to set up, but turned out delicious!

Great Recipe! As suggested by another viewer I did use the 1 can of canned milk and with reg. milk to equal 2 1/2 cup. It was Great pie,my husband loved it..,but one thing though the next time I make this pie, as I definately will be doing, I am going to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup since I am using the canned mik.But if you like sweet then by all means use the 3/4 cup of sugar. Thanks so much for this recipe.It's by far a better one than I had been using.

Oh. My. God. I just made this tonight as a 'test' for Thanksgiving next week, and let me tell you, this is the BEST custard pie I have ever eaten. My father loves custard pie and said it was by far the smoothest, creamiest custard he has ever had. I took the recommendation of adding the extra yolk, I used whole milk, and gave the crust a serious egg wash before pouring in the custard. I ended up having to bake this for 45 minutes, maybe it was my stove. Anyhow, this recipe did not disappoint! Thanks Grandma!!

This is the best custard pie I've eaten.  It's even better than my mom's. Note: You need to use a deep dish pie pan/crust to hold all the mixture.

This was really great!  The only problem I had was even with the egg wash, the pie crust was still a little soggy.  Next time I'll probably bake the crust for a little bit before adding the filling.

I took the advice of one review and used 1- 12 oz can of evap milk and topped with milk to equal 2 1/2 cups. I also took the advice of another review and chose to skip the step of scalding the milk. I highly suspect that was the reason the texture of the custard was airy and curdled. My pie needed an extra 10 minutes beyond the bake time specified, and I'm wondering if it's because I used evap milk and unscalded whole milk. I can certianly relate with others that claimed it reminded them of scrambled eggs (there were little tiny egg curdles through the custard!) A skin had formed on the top which was disappointing. Very much like a sweetened omelet. I was hoping this would creamy and smooth, like vanilla cream pie or creme brulee. I added 1 extra tsp. of PURE vanilla extract as some others claimed it was lacking flavor. I also grated a little fresh nutmeg on top. The flavor is DEFINITELY there, but I need to work on the texture. I'll post an update when I perfect this GEM of a recipe. This an old fashion favorite of my Mother's-who says this pie is a tradition in her native country (Philippines).

this recipe did not work well for me. I guess because I did not scald the milk. It never would get done no matter how long it stayed in the oven. Finally I mashed up the custard to expose the slimy parts to see if it would get done. I'll try later but I rather leave the pie making to my grandma.

Very good and tasty!!  I don't have much of a sweet tooth so I cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup.  Since I needed egg whites to wash the crust, I added an extra egg yolk to the egg custard mix.  My family loved it!  Easy to make-- be patient and pour the scalded milk SLOWLY to the eggs.

Fabulous, fabulous!  I've made this pie numerous times now and I've discovered that I don't necessarily need to scald the milk and I definitely like using the yellow coloring.  Otherwise, no changes, perfect as-is.  Thanks!

This pie was simple to make and very good! My grandson liked it and he normally won't eat "new" foods! This custard is so good it could also be used as invidual custard cups instead of using the pie shell.

What a delicious and smooth egg custard pie!  It was a little on the sweet side, so it may be too sweet for some people's tastes.  I didn't bother with scalding the milk, just added it cold.  Very easy to make.  Tastes best when served chilled.  Yum yum!  Is sure to become a favourite in our house.

This pie is okay. Not great. Not terrible. Boring. It just didn't have a lot of flavor. If I decide to make this again, next time I'll add 2tsp of vanilla instead of the 1tsp called for in the recipe. It needs something more to perk it up.

Not impressed. I've attempted this pie twice now, and been disappointed each time. The taste is good, but the texture is terrible - runny and lumpy (yes, I did temper the eggs and the hot milk). I won't be making this again.

I was looking for an easy egg custard pie recipe and this is one. My dad cooked egg custard pies when I was a kid and I wanted to make one of my own. I'm not a baker but this recipe came out great! Even my wife enjoyed my pie. Thank You!

This is good and really easy. The changes I made were: prebaked the pie shell, and based on the previous reviewers' suggestion, cut down the milk to 2 cups. I also cut back the sugar by 60%, and it was still pretty sweet (the recipe calls for way too much sugar). The modified recipe was a hit. I may try making this next time with cream for a richer custard.

I'm not an egg custard eater, but it's my husband's favorite.  I've tried several different recipes, but this one is his favorite.  He eats the whole thing in two days.  My only problem is that it's hard to get into the oven without spilling.

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because it really should specify to add the scalded milk very slowly.  I added it slowly and the result was a very custardy texture and wonderful flavor!

Very good custard, I doubled the recipe and both were gone in two days. The only thing I did different was I put the custard in a water bath in the oven. I have always put the custard pies on a cookie sheet and added about an inch of water to the cookie sheet like a "bath".  Very good, I will make again.

I made this for my mother and she said that it needed a little more vanilla but was a good pie.  I added the extra yolk and it looked great when it came out.  As for me...well...it tasted like scrambled eggs at first then tasted more like a vanilla custard after the initial tasting.

I think I would leave out the salt. It made the pie tasted a bit like scrabbled eggs. I had a lot of filling, so I'd recommend a deep dish.

I like this recipe but only after I made a few changes because it was a bit too sweet and the custard kept burning.

If you're having the same problems try using only 1/2 cup of sugar and baking at 350 degrees.

Such an easy recipe, but I find it does need modification. I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk and the result is much nicer to me.  Make sure that the egg white dries in your pie crust before filling it as well. Mine always takes at least 45 minutes in the oven, so know that these times vary based on your oven.  Also I like to sprinkle mine with vanilla sugar once it comes out.  This is my go-to pie and I’ve always had many compliments.  I just love it for breakfast as well!

I love custard and found this recipe when I was looking for a good custard recipe. I am a type 1 diabetic which is the reason I needed to make some changes to the recipe. I made it with a crust the first time but skipped the crust the next 6 times I made it. I don't drink milk  I  do however use 1/2 and 1/2 in my coffee. So that is what I used. I stuck mostly to the original recipe the first time I made it but concluded that I like a more eggy and vanilla-y flavor. I use four eggs,  1/2 tablespoon vanilla and sprinkled it with a light dusting of cardamom (it's a Swedish thing, lol) and cinnamon (don't like nutmeg). In place of sugar, I have used Truvia or Splenda baking blends. It turns out great with either. My oven runs hot so I have been playing with the temperature and length of baking time each time I've made it. I now cook it at 375 for 35 minutes. I love this custard recipe and don't remotely miss the crust! Yummy, creamy and sinful!
**** Note For Thanksgiving this year, I made it into a pumpkin custard and kept my modified directions the same but put organic sugar in it in place of the Splenda. After all, it's for everybody. Added 15 minutes onto the baking time and it came out beautifully! ****Just add a 15 oz. can of pumpkin to the mix.

This is a terrific recipe.  I omitted the vanilla.  Turned it into a pear custard pie by adding 2 medium pears, peeled and quartered.  My friends raved about this pie.

Perfect! I did not scald the milk and I poked the crust with a fork before the egg wash. Mine took 40 minutes to get done.  Served with strawberry rhubarb sauce, it is heavenly.

I made this pie last night for our Bible study.  It went over great!  My husband and son love it!  I baked it longer than what it stated on the recipe until it was done & placed a pie crust ring around the edge of the crust to keep it from burning.  It turned out fine.  Will definitely make this again!

I use a deep pie crust shell because I too use the extra egg yolk then just roll down the extra crust to the top of the filling no spill over or thin burned crust tops.

I just started using this recipe and I am getting very good reviews.  As a whim, I decided to make pies to sell for Thanksgiving, I am now a little overwhelmed with people wanting them now.  I add a tablespoon of brown sugar to the milk is the only thing I do differently from the recipe.

So disappointed. So, did scalded and un scalded milk.  Scalded is the way to go.  Consistency changes with scalding.  I recommend adding the yolk from the egg white into the custard.  
So my issues are; 1. possibly 2% milk doesn't work with this recipe. I made 3 pies to test and I had to cook for 45 to 50 min to get the custard to set. 2. I had water two out of three times between the crust and custard.  3.  It was very eggy, and I like that but not many others do.   This recipe seemed to have double the milk compared to other recipes which may be why it was such so wet at took twice the listed time to cook.  Unless your a custard wizard, done use this recipe.

This recipe just didn't work out. My pie was very watery and had no texture at all. I tried to bake it a little longer, but it haven't gotten any better. The custard has too much liquid in it, and the crust seems to be raw. I am very disappointed.

I made this tonight, my eggs were fairly small so I added the yolk and half of the white used to brush the pastry in with the other eggs, I had no vanilla so left it out, and added a couple of tablespoons more sugar. It's absolutely delicious, and tastes exactly like Chinese egg tarts, which made my Chinese husband VERY happy!! Will definitely be making again, though I might blind bake the crust next time as it was a bit soggy.

EASY AS YUMMI PIE... I made the pie then put it into the oven.  THEN read the comments and started to get worried.  DON'T BE ALARMED if it LOOKS TOO RUNNY when you pour it into the pie shell.    YES, do keep whisking in the milk into the egg mixture, and let it cool for at least 30 min.   Believe me it's worth the wait.  Like everyone else I did put in the extra egg, and another splash of Vanilla.  This was my First Time as well making this pie.  It is truly DELICIOUS, just a few ingredients.  ***BE CAREFUL!! YOU CAN'T JUST EAT ONE SLICE*** Enjoy My Lovelie's.

Very good! Kids love it! I substituted splenda for the sugar and added the extra yolk in with the other eggs. I used a previous tip and used a can of evaporated milk and added fresh milk to equal 2 1/2 cups. I baked it a little longer, about 40-45 minutes. It never even lasts to cool off, my kids eat it warm.

I just tried it and it was extremely good. The custard came out very smooth, delicate, and silky. I think I might like to add a little more vanilla though. I took it out after 33 minutes at 400 degrees. This was my first time making an egg custard pie, and I was nervous because 1) the recipe did not call for any flour and 2) the mixture was so watery when I poured it in, I was afraid it would never set! But it turned out almost perfect! The one thing--my crust got burned. I think it goes without saying that you should cover the outer crust with foil, but I think if you put it in the actual instructions it would remind dummies like me to do it!

Although I was tempted to use evaporated milk, add the extra egg yolk or not scald the milk like others suggested I ended up following the recipe exactly except I mixed the nutmeg into the batter instead of sprinkling it on top. My own mistake, was ahead of myself. The crust began to overly brown after about 15 minutes. So I opened the oven and wrapped the edges in foil. Because I opened the oven I ended up baking for another 5 minutes which is probably why the custard became watery, over baked it. My own fault again. The batter is a bit difficult to work with because it's so watery. Although I tried to fill the crust while it was already placed on the oven rack I still spilled tons of it when I pushed the rack back into place. I used a 9" premade frozen crust and had some batter left over which worked out since I spilled so much of it. The hardest part for me was filling the pie shell. The finished result was really delicious though. Really silky and not overly sweet. 4 stars and not 5 because of the burnt crust and not noting the scalded milk should be added slowly.

This was a hit in my family. 5 out of 6 asked for a second serving. The crust edge was browner than I wanted it to be-- almost burnt, and the top of the pie got burned on some spots, I had to peel them off. I covered the pie with whipped topping and nobody noticed the "repair." Still good. Next time, I will bake it for 375 instead of 400 for around 50 minutes.

The pie turned out just fine...after about an hour and a half of baking. 30-35 minutes was not near enough time. It was still liquid at an hour!. I'm actually not a fan of custard pie, but I have several family members who loved this recipe. Just have to adjust the bake time.

Definitely the best custard pie I've ever had.  Couple of tips:
1. If you buy a frozen pie crust (I used Marie Callendar's), put the pie on a baking sheet.  The disposable pan is flimsy and this will easily spill all over your oven and make a huge mess (the baking sheet was the only way I'd move it to the oven without spilling the whole thing).
2. When you add the scalded milk, do a tablespoon at a time.  This prevents scrambling, plus gives you more time to beat with a hand mixer. 

ENJOY!

I made this because someone asked for an egg pie.  I found this recipe and read the reviews and thought it would be a winner.  I tweaked it like everyone else.  I used a cup of whole milk and a can of evaporated milk.  I used the extra yolk and 3 Tbls of butter.  I got rave reviews!!  It made two pies for me but no reviews mentioned that. I baked it on low heat 300 after seeing that the crust was cooking too fast. I cooked it for about an hour on 300.  It turned out perfectly!!

My 1st ever attempt at making egg custard pie was apparently a success! My SO and his son loved it!  Easy, fast, and inexpensive!

I don't know what I did wrong, but I could not get this pie to cook. It was only supposed to take 30 minutes. It stayed liquid, and I cooked it for so long. Eventually I was able to get it cooked. By the end the pie was flat, and it tased like scrambled eggs. I made this for thanksgiving so I didn't give it my full attention since I was cooking other things. Maybe I missed a direction. I will probably try a different recipe next time I make an egg custard pie.

He said it might be the best thing I ever baked, and that's saying something!  Like others, I added the extra yolk, and I used some light cream, too.

I modified this recipe for the holidays as a good weight watchers lifetime member would and it came out great. 
I used 2 cups of over the moon fat free milk and a half cup of egg nog. I used a half cup of splenda rather than the 3/4 cup of sugar.  It was perfect and no one knew of my modifications. I added a splash more of vanilla too. It was gone before I could get a second slice. :)

DIVINE! It turned out sooooo good, and I wasn't even sure I made it correctly--are you supposed to cool the scalded milk first? It didn't say to, so I just waited a few minutes after scalding it and poured it into the egg mixture.

I've never made a custard pie before but this was fast,  easy and it tastes fabulous.  Filling is smooth and creamy.  I pricked the crust and brushed bottom w/egg white and it turned out great, not soggy at all.  I will definitely be making this pie again.

Thanks for this quick and easy recipe. I made this last night and I was not disappointed. I followed it exactly as written with the addition of the extra yolk leftover from the egg white. The custard was smooth and silky on my palate, nor was it heavy in texture. However, I still feel something is amiss. Still, it does taste good; next time I will cut back on the sugar somewhat.

Outstanding. I followed exactly. Except I used heavy cream (about 1.5 cups) instead of milk and forgot the salt. But it was so good!

This recipe was excellent.  I used 4 eggs, though because my eggs were very small.  This is a championship pie for sure.  I'm adding it to my personal collection.  Thanks.

Love it !!!!! 
I added 2 1/2 cups half and half instead of milk.
It was AWSOME. 
I had to cook it for 40 mins.
Can not wait to make it again.....

Very easy and very good pie but I did have to cook longer than the 35 minutes. It was more like 55 minutes.  I started at 400 degree and then dropped down to 350 for the last 30 minutes.

Yum! Even better than the custard pie I remember from when I was little.  I followed the recipe exactly except I beat the 'extra' yolk into the custard. It's worthwhile using very high quality ingredients if you can - use good, real vanilla and freshly grated nutmeg.

OMG!!  This pie is awesome.  I used undiluted carnation evaporated milk instead of the milk to make a creamier and smoother custard. I also threw in the yolk I separated from the white. Suggestion:  Serve the pie chilled.  It is out of this world!!

wow! Simply put this is a wonderful recipe! You do need to put in a deep dish pie pan...I had to make 2 in regular pie pan. I added just a sprinkle of cinnamon also. This is a wonderful recipe that I will use time and time again! can't wait to add some coconut to the recipe! (I also had no problem with the eggs scrambling but I did let the milk cool after I scalded it. I also added some evaporated milk so it would be richer) Thanks again for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This recipe is delicious just as followed.  My daughter and her husband especially loved it and couldn't wait to have it again.  I did add the extra yolk and 2-3 teaspoons of vanilla.  I didn't add the food coloring and don't think you really need it.  It is very important to temper your eggs with the hot milk to avoid a scrambled custard pie.

I've never made a custard pie before, but my brother wanted one for his birthday. I made this one and it turned out wonderful.  He loved it and so did everyone else.  If I'd have know they were so easy to make I'd have made them a long time ago.

This is quite a hit at our house. This is very simple to make and tastes delicious. I have not had any issues with it separating or boiling in the oven. I scald my milk in a double boiler and it turns out perfect every time.

I also ended up with sweet, scrambled eggs. I love a sweet custard, and this is too much for me - unheard of before this. I did some research to find out why it separated, and I found where this happens when it is cooked at too high of a heat. When I looked in the oven, it's the first time I ever saw a custard boil! I will go back to Mom's and try at a lower heat... Maybe someday my custard will turn out!

Just made this pie tonight. It was GREAT!! I think it would have been better if I would have used real sugar but I used a Splenda sugar Blend. It was still fantastic so I KNOW it had to be a good recipe! I'll try it one day with real sugar when I'm not trying to lose weight, ;-).

My husband absolutely loves custard pie and he was very happy with this one! I revised by using a can of evaporated milk and heavy cream to 2 1/2 cups, using 2 teaspoons of vanilla and by cooking 40 minutes. Worked well with frozen pie crust. Next time I will add the yolk from the egg wash. Thank you for a great recipe!

Very good pie although it seems more pudding and less custardy. It's so creamy and so good. Next time I will cook the milk down a little more.

Since I had an extra pie shell taking up space in my freezer after Thanksgiving I decided to have a go at my dad's favorite pie - custard. I'm not a fan of custard pie myself, but it set up properly, was the right texture, and got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. Quality recipe.

This was a total disaster!  It spilled everywhere, the crust caught fire during cooking, and the custard was watery.

This is a great recipe, but it was way too sweet!  I will definitely cut down the sugar next time.  Mine took about 40 min. to bake, but it was silky smooth custard and didn't taste too eggy.  I tempered my eggs before adding the other ingredients, but I didn't exactly scald my milk, just heated it up a bit.  I will definitely make this again, reminded me of when I was little and my mom would make for me.

I'm not a big custard fan, but my family loved it. The egg white on the crust really kept it from getting soggy. I'll try that on my other custard-type pies too.

I rated this a 5. Personally, I don't like this pie because I don't like custard, but I made it for a man I work with whose mom used to make it and he said it tasted just like hers. I made the recipe exactly as written. He also said it tasted like K&W Cafeterias (and I guess that is a good thing!)

This was my first time making egg custard and it was pretty good. I didn't scald the milk - I just threw everything into the bowl and mixed it all together. I added two more eggs and kept the other ingredients the same. I added a drop of lemon extract and I had enough for two pies. Next time, just because of my families prefrences I'll add more lemon, extra nutmeg and maybe some cinnamon. This was a good basic pie, not as good as the one I'm use to, the only hard part was getting it to not spill out of the sides of the pie crust while trying to get it into the oven.

It was my husband's birthday and he LOVES custard pie. So for the heck of it I thought I'd try it and wow was it amazing! So easy to make even I could make it. His sister tried it too and said it was better than their Grandmother's. THANK YOU for this recipe it was simple and made his birthday. I also used the extra egg yolk from the white and it was fabulous!

I made this for a sick friend who was craving custard.  Stuck to the recipe but added one egg yolk left over from the egg white wash on the crust, as others did.  Used half milk, half 1/2 'n 1/2.  She raved so much I have made 3 more pies since!  Can't get enough of it! Thanks, Grandma!!!

This is a very good custard pie. I loved it, my husband loved it. I'm requested to do another one!

My cooking comments are: 

(1)Cooking @400F, half way through the recommended time the edge of my pie started getting  brown, while the center of the custard boiled like a little geyser, I begun to worry and:

(2)I first decreased the temperature to 375F and 10 minutes later went even lower to 350F. 

(3) Overall cooking time got in result extended until that gayser disappeared and the pie settled while shaken gently.

(4) at that point I cut the temperature off and left the pie in the oven with the door open

(5) "wobbling" completely stoped after a few minutes and pie looked perfect (light to golden brown). 

(6) chilled pie cut perfectly (no crumbs, or other falling of pieces) and it tasted  tops!

The temperature "issue" may have had something to do with the fact I cooked it in our little mini oven, perhaps.

I doubled this recipe and made two of these pies, one for a gift, and the other for myself so I could be sure it was good.  Absolutely perfect.  I did follow other readers suggestions and add the extra yolk, as well as a can of evaporated milk plus whole milk to equal 2 1/2 cups.  My oven is small so I had to put one on an upper rack and one on a lower rack.  The edge of the crust burned some on the upper rack but the lower rack one had perfect crust, especially the bottom of the crust.  Will definately bake my next one in the lower 1/3 of the oven.

I made this pie on Christmas morning.  It was easy to make as I used frozen pie crust and was really very good.  I added an extra egg yold and vanilla as suggested in many of the reviews.  The men in my family loved it!  Will definitely make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very easy custard pie. To add extra richness, I added the yolk  from the egg that I used the whites from to brush on the crust,that way nothing was wasted. 
My mother, who loves custard said it was very good.

I have been searching for the perfect custard pie and I believe this is it. I made this pie for Thanksgiving dinner, along with three others, and it was everyone's favorite. It is a keeper. Thank you, Marles, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!!  I have tried several different Custard Pie recipes, to include two others from this site, and this one is a definite keeper!  The crust was firm and not soggy...the custard was perfectly set and not runny...and the flavor was wonderful (I highly recommend using freshly grated nutmeg on top)! YUM!!!!!

I have been looking for a long time for this recipe. I tweaked it only a little. I used evaporated milk and the left over egg yolk for extra richness. I also added a tablespoon of all purpose flour for a firmer pie. I like vanilla so I added an extra teaspoon. This pie is a big hit in my home !!!!

my DH said this is the pie he has been waiting for since he was a kid, and this was the first pie that tasted exactly the way he remembered. It was a huge success.

I would give this even more stars if possible.  This is my absolute favorite custard pie recipe.  I love them anyway, but this one has completely taken away the "eggy" taste and left you with sweet, good pie.  I did have to put foil on the edges, and I made 2 thinner pies, but I followed the recipe exactly.  Simply perfect, definitely a blue ribbon around here!

Sadly, this was more spongy than silky, although the flavor was nice and delicate. I'll keep shopping for a recipe with better-textured results.

it's very good, but lacks a bit of flavor (i'm probably just picky) it is great though, and would really make a great flan...

This was wonderful and so easy to make, my 6 year old helped.  I would normally substitute Splenda for sugar, but was low on Splenda, so went half and half with the sugar.  Used 1% milk and thought it turned out great!

This is good, but not great.  I'm used to a sweeter pie with a firmer consistency.  Next time, I'll add another 1/2 cup of sugar.  As far as the consistency, I wonder if that was because I used one-percent milk.  Either that, or it needs another egg and less milk.  I'm gonna need to play around with this one to get the result I desire.

My husband, previously a custard-phobe, L-O-V-E-S this pie.  I do use a mix of half and half and milk instead of 100% milk and it is so creamy.  Yum.  This has now become a family staple.

I made this for the third time (holidays only) this Thanksgiving. The first thing I was asked as I walked in the door was did you make the Custard Pie? This pie is now demanded by my family every Holiday get-together. It is easy to make, and tastes wonderful. My teenage niece, who is not fond of eggs, even liked this one.

A very easy recipe, only problem I had (following the directions exactly) was that I needed a deep dish crust.  The ingredients did not call for a deep dish crust just a 9" unbaked pie crust.  I ended up with one really nice pie and one really thin pie.

Overall it was pretty alright.  It was my first time to make custard pie so I wasn't really sure what to expect when I made the filling.  I really didn't care for the nutmeg so I replaced it with cinnamon. It tasted pretty good.  But I too like my Custard Pies heavier and richer.  I like custard pies a little more eggy. The recipe was VERY easy but make sure you've got steady hands to put it in the oven (i had some major spillage in my kitchen ~_~ ) My family said it was alright but not great.  I'd make it again if someone REALLY REALLY needed custard egg pie fast.

This is not the best custard pie I have ever had. Didn't have a lot of flavor to it.  In my family, we have custard pie every Christmas holiday, and this pie could use some improvement. It is missing something, but I just can't quite put my finger on it.

I followed instructions exactly. I used a 9 inch frozen deep dish pie crust. There was way too much batter for the pie crust so I also filled 2 ramekins and threw some batter out. Put in oven and set timer. It was not dobe, in fact it was very runny. I cooked for an additional 16 plus minutes, it was still a bit runny but I took it out to cool. I certainly could not insert a knife to come out clean it was a runny mess. But as it cool down it congealed. My crust was burnt due to the extra time in oven. But the pie sans crust was good. In the end these instructions suck.

Came out perfect and it was gone by the end of the day.  Make sure not to cook the eggs with the scalded milk.

It was okay.  I wasn't fond of the texture though.  When you cut a piece with a fork to take a bite, the top half of the pie splits off.  It was odd.

I made this a while back as written and it was wonderful! I made it in a regular 9 inch and had some left over, which I put in custard cups. Husband LOVED IT!  I made it again, and used the suggestions of 1 can of evaporated milk and to complete the 2 1/2 cups milk I used buttermilk! Still WONDERFUL! My mistake was not adjusting the amount of every thing because I divided it up between to prepare 8 in graham cracker crust, ( I was lazy and didn't want to make the pie crust when I had two already made )  it was definitely NOT ENOUGH! The pies were skimpy! The serving was 8 so next time I'll try adjusting it to 12 servings for ingredient amount! Still, WONDERFUL flavor just as I remembered.

This was an absolutely perfect recipe. I did, however, add a tablespoon of corn starch and put some sweetened coconut on top for the most excellent Coconut Custard pie I ever had. The brushing of the crust with  eggs whites made the crust so flaky. It was awesome.

This was pretty foolproof. I've never been successful making egg custard pies but this one turned out perfectly. I followed the suggestion of using evaporated milk + milk combo and used a blender to mix all the components. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written. When I make it next time, I will add more spice. I think it could stand to be amped up slightly. I think I'll also drop the oven 25 degrees. The top got pretty brown. 

Bottom line, I'll be making this again! Highly recommended.

I needed to cook this a bit more. The custard was good but the crust was still raw. Also, suggest more flavor, but my husband almost ate the whole pie.

Probably the worst custard recipe I've ever made & I've made hundreds. It calls for entirely too much milk is the biggest problem I see & could do with a TBS or more flour. However, I will choose to stick with 1 of my other recipes that are fail proof, sorry. This is the 1st bad review I've ever left on here.

I followed this recipe to the letter except used cardamom instead of nutmeg.  That wouldn’t have made any difference in how the recipe performs.  First, there was a bit too much filling for the frozen deep dish pie shell.  Then, this didn’t set up firm enough for my taste and was just eggy and really not quite sweet enough.  Next time, I will use a custard pie recipe that incorporates some flour.

I made this as written today.  Silky smooth custard in a crispy crust-so good!  Just the right amount of sweetness.    I had never heard of brushing the pie crust with egg white before, but this will now be standard procedure on all my pies, what a difference it makes. Outstanding recipe!

Awful instructions, caused such a mess!
First, 3 eggs are not enough.  All other recipes call for 4 eggs. The shortage of eggs resulted in prolonged cooking time.  I'm way pass the 50 minute mark yet my pie is still wet.
Second, instructions didn't mention that the recipe requires a dip dish pie shell which resulted in a 1/3 of a custard mixture to be wasted. I placed the remaining of the mixture in  a ramekin, hoping for the best.
This recipe called for uncooked pie crust yet other recipes call for a homemade crust to be blind-baked (pre-baked). I spent so much butter and effort on a lovely pie crust dough yet following instructions of not pre-baking ended up with a huge bubble on the side and more of the custard mixture spilled and burned to a crisp (thankfully on the cookie tray that we placed underneath). 
I often get my recopies off this website yet never before had such a disaster. 
My advice: use  4 eggs, use a deep dish pie shell, pre-bake your homemade pie crust.

I followed the directions exactly. I ended up baking for well over an hour and still had a jiggly pie that was liquidy on the bottom. The bottom crust ended up soggy and the edges were burnt. I'm not sure in what world this would be cooked in 35 minutes.

My family absolutely LOVED this pie!  This is my first time ever making a custard style pie and I was worried it would be a mess.  Additionally, my mother in law is the only person I ever knew to make it and she just passed away days ago.  It was and is my husband's FAVORITE, and I thought I would try and make it for him.  It turned out almost perfect!  A few notes:

1.  I had to bake it for about 55 minutes at 400 degrees to get it ALMOST DONE.  Even after that I wasn't sure the center was completely done.  I baked it about 380 for another 8-10 minutes and took it out to cool.

2.  As others have said the milk does not need to be scalded.  Just pour it in.  Also use 3 drops of yellow food coloring for the perfect color.

3. I topped it with strawberries, a very few shaved almonds and when I cut the individual pieces I included about 3 blackberrys and whipped cream.

DELICIOUS, EVERYONE LOVED IT!  Whole pie gone in 20 minutes and I only got one slice.  Have to make 2 more tomorrow.  :-)

This is a good recipe with all ingredients already in the pantry. I did not have any nutmeg so I decided to give more flavor using coconut. I put 1 cup of coconut flakes in the bottom of the pan before adding the batter. I cooked the pie about 45 minutes and added extra flakes on top during the last 10 minutes. To make sure the crust does not burn, cover the edges till the last 10 minutes of baking time. Be sure to temper your eggs before adding the milk. I tasted a hint of scrambled eggs but not too much.  Overall, great and simple recipe.

I used to make this when my kids were little. They are all grown men now. I had forgotten the recipe. This recipe fit the bill perfectly. I made it in a casserole dish and cooked it for 1hr. and 10 min.. It turned out beautifully, just as I remembered.

I found out why some people have a problem with the custard being undercooked and the crust burning! I made a few of these pies and one of them indeed turned out like that. It was because I made the pie with ingredients straight out of the refrigerator. If you make the custard without scalding the milk (which is what I did and which works perfectly) make sure all the ingredients are room temp, including the eggs and milk and the pie will turn out perfect! Also one of the pies seemed underdone, but after waiting an hour for it to completely set, it was SO GOOD. The texture was fancy chawanmushi. So don't be too bummed if the custard looks runny.  Also it is very easy to make different versions of this pie because it has such a neutral flavor. You can substitute the vanilla for any spice. I made one with turmeric even! I love this recipe!

My husband has been a big fan of custard pies, but I never tried to make one until I saw this recipe. He loves it. I make it almost weekly and he doesn't tire of it.

I’ve made this pie multiple times and really love it. It’s so easy and tastes great! It’s like the egg custard they sell at Chinese bakeries but in pie size instead of individual size. I use a store bought pie crust and mix the ingredients with a mixer. I use 4 eggs instead of three, 2 cups of milk (not scalded), and add extra vanilla extract. I strain the mixture through a wire strainer as I’m pouring it into the pie crust so it’s smooth. I sprinkle a generous amount of nutmeg on top, then bake. Delicious every time! Thanks for the recipe.

Came out great, just like I remember from my childhood. I didn't bother to scald the milk, just whipped everything together, and like some of the other commenters, added the additional yolk to the mix as well. I pre-baked my crust for about 10 minutes because I didn't want it to be soggy, but I ended up having to cover the edges in foil so I won't pre-bake it at all next time. This is supposed to be a very straight-forward, mild-tasting pie and this recipe hits the mark! I might try using a can of milk next time, but wouldn't add sugar or more seasoning.

Wonderful recipe!! I did make a few changes though and it came out beautifully. 
Whipped the eggs and added sugar gradually
Substituted one cup heavy cream for one cup milk 
Added extra egg yoke to the mix from the egg wash
Added extra vanilla 
Sprinkled the top with nutmeg and sugar to give an almost Creme brûlée top

This is the best custard pie my husband has ever eaten! And he has had many because it's his favorite pie. This pie was easy and fast to put together.  I used the wire whip attachment on my mixer and this pie turn out to be the lightest custard pie we have ever had.

Awesome recipe as it is written....  Just make sure you temper the eggs by adding a small amount of scalded milk at a time.  I never bring the milk to a complete boil, just take it off before it boils.

I've made this twice, and each time it was the favorite pie of the day.

I used 1/2 cup heavy cream and the rest whole milk. I made it in a 9.5" pan, and still had extra filling (though had I not fluted the edges, it may have fit perfectly). I did partially prebake the crust, which I highly recommend. 

Suggestions:
- Make sure to temper the eggs when adding the scalded milk 
- Partially prebake crust 
Use less nutmeg, add some cinnamon, add extra vanilla

The pie will look like it isn't setting up for a long time, and then voila- it turns into a soft pudding. That is the time to take it out.

It was great! I did use the 4th yolk in the custard and the white to brush the pie crust. I had read another reviewer that did that and it was less wasteful. Was the best custard pie I ever made! I did have to cook mine for @ 40 minutes though; but my oven is 30 yrs old so there you go.

I made one change and that was the eggs.  Being frugal I used 3 whole eggs and added the yoke from the fourth so I had the egg white to brush the crust.  Also, I used fresh ground nutmeg from a nut. Pie was a complete success and you don't have to look for any other recipes.

I was so excited to try this, as I love egg custard pie. Not what I was looking for,  was too sweet for me. I don't use dairy, so did substitute almond milk,. So I will  try something else.

I will make this again.  My mom always made custard pie for Thanksgiving.  I've tried many recipes but this is the best by far.  My Dad and brother thought it was delicious as did my husband and son.  Just like Mom's.  Thank you for the recipe.  Now I can carry on the family tradition of this long time favorite.

I followed the recipe as listed, both my son and I agree it wasn't great. The texture was more jello like than custard or flan creamy.  It also had a strong egg flavor.  I've had egg pie/custard before but this was almost like eating a sweetened scrambled egg.  I think I will try a version with flour in it. Hopefully that will cut  the egg flavor.

This was very good.  I didn't make a pie, just baked the custard in a bowl.  Next time, and there will be a next, I'll use less sugar.

I have made this three times now. LOVE IT! I can say this, it needs to cook longer than indicated. I run on gas and things usually cook faster however with any egg custard pie, it will take longer.

The first time I made it, I love it. The second time - I actually only put 1 egg in and it made it sweeter. So, if you are making this for a party, I would play around with how many eggs you put in and see what you like. 

The third time, I used evaporated milk which turned out awesome.

Remember, it is 1:1 ratio. If you need 2 1/2 of milk. Your going to put 1 1/4 of water and 1 1/4 of evaporated milk. Condensed milk is sweeter so you would need to decrease the amount of sugar to off-set the sugar in the condensed milk.

The only change I made was not to scald the milk (the video instructions said it was not required).  This is my first time making or eating egg custard and I did not care for the taste.  It tastes like sweet eggs!  Not for me.

Excellent recipe.  I liked the tip of  brushing the pie shell with egg white before pouring in the custard batter.  Crust did stay flaky.

So good. I added plenty of nutmeg on top and threw on some dry grated lemon peel I had on hand. It reminded me of my mothers peach cobbler with those tweaks. Excellent recipe!

Try separating your eggs. Add the egg yokes first. Then beat your egg whites to a stiff peak and fold them in the pie filling last, right before pouring it into the crust. My pie was so creamy people thought it was lemon pie instead of egg pie. This recipe is delicious. Thanks for sharing it. My grandmother and mother would be proud.

After testing a couple of different recipes before Thanksgiving, I must say, this one was the best recipe I tested. Just the right amount of sugar. I do recommend baking crust at least 15 minuets before you bake the pie. Although I brushed with egg whites  it wasn't entirely soggy but I prefer it to be a bit more cooked. I added 1 cup of coconut and made it a coconut custard pie.  I also baked it 15 minutes at 450 and then 35 minuets at 325. I covered pie with crust protector. Not crazy about nutmeg...So I would be careful with the nutmeg because it can overpower the pie.

Added extra yolk from egg white wash for pie crust.  The volume of the filling was overflowing the pie crust when I added so next time I will add volume of milk to evaporated milk to achieve 2.5 cups.  Otherwise, eggselent pie! lol.

The picture on this recipe does not do this pie justice. This pie is so easy to make, it fills a 9 inch pie pan/plate and is so beautiful. And I must say after the second pie, following the directions exactly except for my variations, both turned out perfectly beautiful and very delicious. Like others noted, it is necessary to whisk the hot milk one cup at a time into the egg mixture until all is incorporated.
 
Here are some variations I made.
For the first pie, I microwaved 1/2 cup raisins in a little water for 20 seconds, drained them, added to the egg/milk mixture and sprinkled crushed pecans on top.
 
The second pie, I made into a coconut custard pie. First, toasted 1/4 cup shredded coconut on a cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 5 minutes and set aside. I then raised the oven temperature to 400 and added 1/2 cup shredded coconut to the egg/milk mixture just before pouring into pie crust. Yes, the pie spilled out a little while baking but it was an easy clean-up. It's easy to see why this pie is a real prize winner

Absolutely delicious. The filling was light, delicate, and not too sweet. It was silky and smooth in the middle. If you've ever had chinese egg tarts, it's a bit like that - in fact, I might miniaturize it into tiny tart tins to make pseudo egg tarts. I added the extra egg yolk from the egg white into the filling, and I did bake my shell by itself for about 10 minutes to make sure it would cook completely. I reduced the cooking temperature to 350 degrees to prevent the crust from burning (which was successful!), which meant I had to cook it for quite a bit longer. However, by checking on it every ten minutes and checking it with the jiggle test/clean knife test, it came out perfectly browned and not overcooked. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I don't think it's necessary to scald the milk.  I also don't use the spice, and I top with the egg whites after the pie is cooked it rounds out the finish of the pie.  Very good recipe.

I'm sure this dish is succulent with extras, but on the day I made it, I did not have all the extras such as maybe toasted coconut flakes, caramel sauce, or whipped cream. We ate it just as is, and it was not sweet enough just by itself. For me a good dish is one that is delicious without extras, that did not fit my liking.

The look and texture turn out to be perfect, but the taste...

This recipe is fantastic! I made one change: the egg white used to brush the crust plus the extra yolk went in the pie as well (for a total of just less than 4 eggs in my custard). I made this for my parents and they both absolutely loved it! They both said it tasted like what their grandmother's made. I'm making it again today (dyed green for St. Patrick's Day)! And for anyone who cuts corners and doesn't scald the milk--it's worth it. It doesn't need to be scaled for safety reasons, like one reviewer suggested. Scalding the milk changes the flavor and when that warm milk hits those eggs--the smell is just heavenly! That was the moment I knew I was making grandma's custard.

I had a 7" pastry tin, but instead of adjusting amounts just made 6 mini ones as well. Had some trouble trying to get them out. Are you meant to butter up the cases first? Cooked all the way through, but bottom of pastry was a little soggy, I did egg wash pastry first as directed. Maybe the mixture leaked a little. Very easy to make otherwise, the custard set beautifully and was delicious. Looked good enough to eat too. I love nutmeg so sprinkled little note on b4 putting into oven. Will try again though I'm aiming for perfection:-)

I highly recommend this recipe for egg custard.  I did not use pie crust, just put in ramecans and gave a water bath in oven.  Very very good.  My husband loved it.  Thanks for the recipe.  Oh, one more thing, first time I scaled the milk, but, theres a video on this now and it said you don't need to scald the milk  I am going to try it today.

Great recipe!  I add a split vanilla bean when scalding the milk and replace about 2 tablespoons of the white sugar with brown sugar.  Makes for a rich yummy pie.

I give this 4 star for potential.  I read some of the reviews and cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup which still seemed a tad sweet, added an extra egg, and used almond extract instead of vanilla (I used 1tsp but it was kind of strong so maybe next time 1/2 tsp just for the hint of it).  I did not brush the egg white onto the crust.  This took about 45 mins to bake at 375 (probably could've used another 5 mins), but it seemed to set ok after being overnight in the fridge.  Will probably make this again with less sugar.

My pie looked like it was boiling even after 40 minutes (I let it stay in there 5 minutes longer). The filling doesn't look smooth either. This is the first time I baked something that came out like this. :-(

It is so easy to make and the recipe is very simple.  Do not hesitate to use the scalded milk as it is what makes this egg custard pie better than the others. Even my kids they enjoyed the pre very much!
Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I tweaked it by adding caramel extract along with the vanilla. Everyone said it was the best custard pie they ever had! Also, I used my usual lard crust recipe and pre-baked it. No need for the egg white wash, it came out perfect.

This was my first custard pie I ever made. It came out delicious. my husband loved the sweet flavor. When I was growing up being a very fussy eater. I wouldn't think of eating a pie made from eggs. Now I'm older and wiser and love this pie! would recommend it to all

Husband is egg custard nut. He said this one is the best yet. I have made several times and it turns out perfect every time. I add the extra egg yolk to pie with no problems. Also use half and half instead of milk.

I really wanted to like this recipe but no one in the family liked it at all. It took longer to bake than stated but that would have been okay if we liked the taste. That didn't happen. I couldn't even finish the one piece I tried. Except for an eggy taste it didn't seem to have much flavor at all. If I am going to be eating all of those calories it had better taste good!

Very good. I used evaporated milk and did not boil it first. My pie did not come out "eggy" (there was no boiled milk to cook the egg) nor did it come out runny. Note: I had extra filling that I baked in a ramekin alongsie the pie. I thought it was even better than the pie!! Next time, I might make this without the crust - it's that good!

Mine was watery with burnt edges just as the Most Helpful Critical Review stated. I use to have a family recipe for egg custard pie and can't seem to find it but I'm sad and baffled about my outcome with this one since so many seem to have had success...

Very disappointed. I went directly by the directions to the nth. It took 45 minutes and I finally pulled it out of the 400 degree oven. Crust was burned badly. Still the knife showed custard.

I had three leftover egg yolks, so I added another whole egg and the yolk from the separate "egg white for brushing." I also substituted some leftover evaporated skim milk for half the milk. One of the easiest pies ever, and it came out luscious. I did scald the milk.

I made this pie as directed.  I did have to cook it a bit longer because it need to set.  It tasted ok, but the egg came through more to me than a dessert.  I would make it again but add cornstarch to make it a smoother texture and add additional vanilla and sugar.

This was a really good pie. Smooth, not too sweet as a couple reviews said (at least not for my tastebuds). The only thing I would change the next time i make it, is the amount of salt- i think a pinch, instead of 1/4 teaspoon would be a better, as there was a mouthful or 2 that really tasted a bit like scrambled eggs, but only because of the extra salt in those bits. Overall Yummy none the less!!!

This was recipe was really good.  My children loved it.  Also, instead of adding yellow food coloring to the pie we used red and blue to make a purple pie and the kids thought it was so cool.

This was a nice custard pie, quite delicate.  It was even better the next day.  I agree you need to add the milk slowly while whisking to temper the eggs,and be careful not to overcook it.  I used a pie crust recipe from this site.

This was sooooooooooo yummy!!! I actually used a frozen pie crust...the kind you get already in the pan and it didn't come out soggy at all! Turned out very light and awesome!

So, I'm on a quest now to find a *perfect* egg custard pie.  While this was not quite there, it was certainly good!  I added the extra yolk into the custard, like others recommended.  I also added closer to a Tbsp. of vanilla.  Plus, my mother asked for coconut custard pie, so that is what she got!  I added a cup of coconut (someone suggested it EARLY in the reviews).  It was really good, but I'm gonna try some others to compare!  Thanks!

This is excellent and so easy! I used the pre-made pie shell (I recommend Marie Callender-you can get these in the frozen food section of almost any grocery store)I also added an extra 1/4 tsp of vanilla. Scrumptious!!!

I cooked it longer than in the recipe since I found the filling still very watery. I used the Easy Pie Crust recipe for the crust and I followed the advice not to glaze it with egg white, but it turned out to be soggy. I also have quite a lot of leftover filling, but it doesn't matter since I'll definitely bake another one ^^

This is my first experience cooking a pie, and it was wonderful! I actually planned to make egg tarts but thought that this pie might be easier and taste as good as egg tarts. And it is! ^v^

This is the BEST custard pie I've made! I did replace 1c of the milk with heavy cream, put cinnamon on top instead of nutmeg, and used the leftover egg yolk in the custard.  Not watery at all even after refrigerated, which is the problem I usually have.  I brushed the unbaked crust with egg white and the bottom crust wasn't soggy at all, but it didn't bake - I wonder if that was because I put the pie pan on a cookie sheet.  Next time I'll place it directly on the rack.  I had a little extra custard mixture so I put it in a dish and added unsweetened coconut and that was awesome!  
I was concerned after reading other reviews that the pie was too sweet, but it was just right for me!

This was great - so easy to make and came out perfectly.  I made it for my father because custard pie is his favorite and he said it was the best he ever had.  The only thing I did differently was to use a vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract.  I had never made custard pie before but after this I will make it again because this recipe is great!

very good recipe, I was looking for something  like my mom used to make when I was a little girl, and this is it. Next time I will cut the sugar down a bit, (just a personal preferance) it was a bit sweet for me. Other than that a great recipe! Thank you.

The only thing that saved this pie was the homemade pie crust. Otherwise the custard was just okay. I used extra vanilla too but it didn't turn out half as good as I had hoped. This is my first attempt at a custard pie and while we are all custard fans even the kids wouldn't touch it after one bite.

This custard pie was wonderful, it reminded my husband of one that his grandmother used to make.  I only had 1% milk in the fridge so I used half and half and 1% milk both which I'm sure added to the creamy texture.  Very simple and delicious!

I'm not that big of a fan of egg custard pie.  I made this pie at my boyfriend's request.  He liked it, it passed the test, and I've nothing to complain about.

This was good. Not as good as some made it out to be, but pretty good.  Imade it for my friend's birthday and she loved it......or maybe she was just trying to be nice. Either way, I would recomend this to all you custard lovers out there because it is pretty tasty.

With a little trial and error, this turned out great. At first, I was supervising my 12 yr. old daughter with the recipe, we were busy doing one thing and as a result we burned the milk instead of scalding it. :( Having to do the milk again slowed us down but the end result was a hit!  Also, instead of store bought crust, we made it using Emeril Lagasse's crust recipe and it turned out fantastic! My daughter & I had fun making this together and you can bet that this recipe will definitly be used again.  ;)
