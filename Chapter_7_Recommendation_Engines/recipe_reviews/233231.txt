Excellent flavor. I dont have a stick blender so did with an electric beater.(Just have to be patient). Also found that I needed to add more Dijon..for my tastes. I used the mayo on the Red Skinned Potato Salad found on AR. Awesome combo.

Really, really fabulous - and so easy! I used light-tasting olive oil (avoid Extra Virgin Olive Oil for mayo as it's too strong tasting and often results in bitter mayo). I just bought avocado oil so may try that next time. This was SO good, I immediately had my husband taste it and he thought it would be awesome as a dipping sauce (ie, for fondue). It has an aioli feel (from the garlic). The only thing to know is that the basil turns brown by the next day. Still 100% fine, but not as brilliant-looking if serving to company. Given how easy this is with an immersion blender, I'd rather do fresh, smaller batches the day of if you're concerned about presentation. It doesn't affect the taste though. SO yummy!

You have to add the oil SLOWLY!!  This did not turn out for me at all.  After looking up a different recipe it states that you have to add the oil very SLOWLY in order for it not to separate and continue to be a liquidy mess instead of thick and creamy.  I used up almost my entire bottle of oil trying to make this but had enough left to try a different recipe where I added the oil slowly and it turned out.  So... this might be a good recipe (I will try it again after I buy more oil) but the directions were unclear.

First off, I LOVE this method with using a stick blender. I've made it in my regular Oster blender before but this made for much less waste and much easier clean-up. My Pyrex 2-cup measurer worked great to make this in. I did omit the basil (didn't have any) and I also used "Extra Light Tasting" olive oil, because I know olive oil is a better oil for you. Loved the taste. One of these days I hope to try it with the basil too though. :-)

Amazing!!  I've tried making mayo before and never found it worth the effort and frequently it was too runny and separated.  Since I already have an immersion blender and my basil plant is at peak, I thought I'd try this recipe.  WOW!  Simple and no drizzling oil or separation.  The mayo never got all the way to a salad or sandwich plate either!  Tried the suggestion to spread on baguette slices and before you know it, I needed another batch.  Will definitely try this again soon.

I had some basil to use up and was happy to find this recipe since Chef John never disappoints! Made as written and it was delicious. I used it to marinate shrimp for the grill and then tossed some with pasta. Even my 3 year old couldn't stop stealing little tastes before I used it.

I followed the directions exactly. Great flavor, velvety smooth texture. Made it to use on some beautiful turkey sandwiches, then used some of the leftover on grilled salmon. Also good on broccoli and I'm sure other veggies. Delicious! I'll be making this again! Thanks Chef John!

I thought I followed the instructions but although the mixture did taste okay, it didn't thicken and was of no use to me.

I have made fresh Mayonnaise since I was a child, it's easier than buying a jar!  It's true though you must drizzle your olive oil (someone here said avoid EVO.....false, only if you buy an inferior brand).  What caught my eye on this recipe was the addition of basil, I usually use just garlic for something different, I tried just as it was in my blender. Tastes devine on toasted BLT's, try it you'll like it!

I just made this for the first time.  I had been using a "whole egg" recipe because I hate waste, but it never turned out right.  It was always bland and runny.  This is perfect.  The consistency is excellent.  I'll never go back to the runny slop again!

This looks fabulous but I add a bit of a blend for my oil when making mayo.  The kids and hubby say it tastes closest to store bought mayo (if that's what you're used to).  I use a cup of avocado oil (it's got a very neutral flavor), a quarter cup of sesame oil and a quarter cup of light olive oil. Also if you have a Vitamix, this is super simple to make and I always use the whole egg which doesn't leave any to waste.

If you see the photo my batch is much greener.  That's because I added a small poblano to the boiling water and let that boil for a minute before I blanched the basil with it.  And I slowly added peanut oil into my blender to emulsify with the yolks.  I was worried about how runny it was in the beginning, but I kept adding all of the oil and like some magic trick...voila... it got thicker and creamier with more and more oil.
I think it would be fun to use this recipe as a base, and experiment, making batches of mayo with different ethnic cuisines.  I can't wait to use this to make a Thai inspired mayo with the addition of lemon grass, star anise and ginger.

Delicious!  Don't forget to make it with room temperature eggs.  I made that mistake first and it made the mayo runny.  I tried it again with room temp eggs and it was amazing.

I've made mayo with my stick blender many times, but this particular combination of flavors raises it to a whole new level. While I didn't bother with the wasted step of sterilizing the outside of the eggs, I only made two other changes: 1) I used an ultra light olive oil instead of vegetable oil; and 2) instead of lemon juice I used Bragg's organic apple cider vinegar for the acid. Forget spreading it on crackers or toast; I want to eat it by the spoonful!!
