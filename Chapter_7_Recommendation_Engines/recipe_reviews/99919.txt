This recipe was fantastic - however after reading the review where the person said it took 45 minutes to cook, I decided to soak the tapiaco overnight and my cooked fine as directed.

This was fantastic, just like the pudding in the Vietnamese restaurants.  I added 1 1/2 cups (440g) crushed pineapple instead of bananas though, which went really well - pina colada-ish!  Next time I would add just a little more tapioca though, just to make it a little less runny, but overall everyone loved it, and it was so simple to make.

This was a fun recipe. I've never used tapioca before, and the only tapioca pudding I've ever had was the Jell-O pudding cups. This was so much better than that! I didn't have coconut milk, so I used regular milk and added some coconut. Next time I would just follow the recipe, the coconut added a funny texture. As written, this recipe is fantastic!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It took way way way too long to make.  My small pearl tapioca didn't turn transparent for 45 minutes.  Now that it is finally done, the final product looks unapetizing and tastes as bad.  Sorry, really not worth the time.

Positively delicious!  

I was searching for a non-smoothie idea to use up a partial can of coconut milk and some bananas and ran across this.  I had no tapioca so I adjusted water and used plain rice.  I also added a touch of vanilla and did not use salt.  Surprisingly fabulous!  I thought we would like it.  I was not anticipating loving it.

I'm eager to try the flavor combination but on a healthier grain as a breakfast option...maybe barley or oats.

This is delicious, also known as "Jaik-a-Thy". Best if prepared with fresh coconut milk and the starchier SE Asian bananas (cubed pumpkin can also be substituted!). If you are using canned, you may need thin it a bit with water and reduce the sugar a tad. If you are making your own coconut milk, reserve some of the "first milk", later warm it and serve over the chilled pudding.

Couldn't find pearl tapioca so used minute tapioca. It was very thin, so I just added more tapioca. Was very good.

I just made this for dessert. There really is no need for all the extra prep work with the tapioca. I used 3/4 of small pearls with 3 cups of water. Bring to boil, reduce to simmer and cover. Stir about 3 times to prevent the pearls from sticking to the pot. It will thicken and look gooey, but no worries. After about 10-15 mins, dump a can of coconut cream/milk and stir. You will be able to see your pearls again after putting in the cononut milk/cream. Try to find a banana variety with thick skin, those cook and taste better. Slice the banana about 3/4" thick and throw it in the pot. Keep the cover on and turn off heat. The banana will continue to cook as the pudding cools--about 10 mins. I cracked a young coconut and used a peeler to get thin slices to mix in the pudding.

This is as basic as it gets.  Add whatever fruits you think would compliment the coconut milk.  Instead of microwaving, I simmered it for 5-7 minutes then let it sit.

Hi. I adapted the recipe as didn't have pearl tapioca. I used 1/2 c organic minute tapioca, 2 c filtered water, 1 can(13.5oz)organic coconut milk, and 2c 2.5 oz mashed ripe organic banana and cooked on stove 12 minutes. I added 3/4 c shredded, unsweetened organic coconut to mix while hot. Let cool in fridge 15 minutes, then added one whole diced fresh pineapple and 6 diced ripe organic bananas. Finished product is yummy and is, I believe, organic,  gluten-free, wheat-free, sugar-free, dairy-free, nut-free, soy-free, and vegan (which is fairly remarkable, really). It's delicious.  Next time I will add pecans, more shredded coconut (I ran out), and maybe a touch of brown sugar. As it is, it's perfect for the hippy potluck I'm headed to today :-) Great recipe! Thank you! I live in Hawaii and have an abundance of fruit at all times, so this was an amazing way to use up a ton of bananas, coconut,and pineapple. Hooray!

While the flavor was yummy it was very, very runny - not like pudding at all.  If I ever make it again I will use much less water.

I tried this as living in Hawaii I have a lot of bananas in my life...and for whatever reason this didn't work.  I didn't like the fact that the consistency was thinner than I thought it should be and really would have liked more coconut milk and less water.  Essentially it tasted like pretty sweet banana baby food.

First I want to thank all the reviewers because your input has helped me make this dish. I used cassava starch tapioca (purchased at my local Asian market) and followed the recipe closely. Changes were to the amount of sugar added, I used 1/4c to taste, and I used 3 ripe bananas instead of the 5 called for. To address the issue people said about it being runny I mixed on egg in a bowl and added small amounts of water from the pot until it was warm enough to add to the pudding. I stirred that in, added the coconut milk, and added the sugar last.

Yummy... I read the other reviews and I adjusted the recipe to fit how I'd like it to turn out. I used 1/4 cup sugar, 6 cups water and a whole can of coconut milk (13.66 fl. oz.).  Even with the adjustments to the recipe the dish ended up pretty sweet, for me that is... Next time I'll hold back on adding the sugar until the very last minute and taste, taste, taste.

Sounds yummy but I found that you can make tapioca pudding with coconut milk in about 15 minutes just following the directions  on the tapioca box. MUST stir constantly though.
