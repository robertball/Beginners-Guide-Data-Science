this was a very good recipe and easy to make. i didn't have any fresh strawberries so i just used a home made strawberry jam that i had and it worked out great. next time i think i will cut a little into the bottom round to put in the filling. cause  when i did it as is the strawberries just ran off the side.

This was good...but plan to eat the whole thing!  It turns soggy quickly.  My kids loved it though.  It's hard to keep it in the shape of a cake since it wants to mush everywhere, but despite the appearance it gave it tasted really good!
