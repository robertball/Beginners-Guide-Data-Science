This was fantastic!  However, I made a couple of substitutions for personal taste and convenience.  I used 2 whole fresh chilies (about 3 inches long) in place of the dried ones and substituted zucchini for the mushrooms for some additional nutrition (and also because zucchini is what I had on hand).  In the final step, I added the vegetable stock directly to the veggie mixture, brought to a slow boil, added the couscous, covered the pan, removed it from the heat and let it sit for 5 minutes.  It looked beautiful and tasted magnificent!

This has fast become one of my favorite dishes...so delicious. I serve it with a roasted sweet potatoe. If you cannot tolerate very spicy foods, then lessen the dried pepper to what you feel you can handle.  It comes out very spicy. I used crimini mushrooms, they are meatier then the white button.  I'd give this 6 stars if I could.

amazing dish!  I would also say, in regards to the previous rating, that I would give this a 6 star rating if I could.  I did change something important though.  I didn't have any anise on hand so I used a small amount of coursely chopped fennel seeds instead.  I haven't had it with the anise, but with the fennel it was grand.  This is also a recipe that can be made ahead of time and quickly reheated in the oven.  Watch the time on the covered simmering couscous, it barely takes the 3 min.

Substituted some red curry paste for chilies and added a zucchini and a can of kidney beans.  Left out the lemon juice and pepper (personal preferences.) It was wonderful!   Tip: Cut the dates lengthwise to remove pits easily before chopping. Don't forget to remove the star anise pods before eating.  More vegetable broth may be needed to get the couscous consistency you desire.

Really liked this - it was a good blend of spicy and sweet.  Like others have done, I added 1 zucchini.  I would also increase the amount of dates the next time I make it.

This was really really good but I had to make some substitutions because of ingredients I didn't have. I used scant 1/2 tsp anise powder instead of the pods, about a tsp salt, 1 1/2 tsp minced garlic, 1 whole red bell pepper chopped, just a pinch of black pepper, 3/4 cup sliced mushrooms (they really do give it a wonderful flavor), 1/3 cup chopped dates, and used chicken stock instead of vegetable. I also used about a tsp Sriracha hot sauce instead of the dried pepper because I couldn't find any and it gave it just the right amount of spice. I also had to add about 2 more T of oil after adding the mushrooms, etc because it would have been too dry. YUM *edit* by the way this makes around 4 servings, not 2!

"A food so nice they named it twice!" :) The rave reviews for this dish initially sold me. I gave the couscous a whirl, and was in awe of the superb mix of flavors. It reminds me of a Southern Mexico stew that combines many of the same flavors- cinnamon, anise, hot peppers, dates (they also add boiled eggs and potatoes!). The sugar from the dates nicely caramelized the rest of the veggies near the end of the cooking process. The warming spices are perfect for the coming cold months!

Fantastic recipe. I just use Clic brand couscous spices and a little bit of chili paste instead of assembling the spices on this list. Very versatile; you can use any vegetables you might have in the fridge.

This was great...I first thought the lemon juice would make it too tart but it didn't. I used raisns because I was out of dates, which I am sure changed the flavor quite a bit. Star anise is essential in this recipe. I think the same method would work well with bulgar or even long-grain rice.

Wow, delicious. This is my first attempt at making couscous and couldn't have found a better recipe to try. I only made three minor changes; I cooked red instead of green bell peppers, and used 1/2 cup of dates for more sweetness, and omitted the dried peppers since I was hoping my little toddler would eat some too. I am already looking forward to making this again.

For the most part, this is a great site and I have gotten many great recipes from it. That being said, there are a small number of recipes, this one included, where not only do I not understand how it achieved 5 stars, but I literally cannot fathom how ANYONE would give this 5 stars.   My father and I made it EXACTLY as written (we even went to a Chinese market to buy star anise).   What does it taste like? It tastes like couscous with onions and mushrooms and a little sweetness. Nothing interesting about it and you couldn't taste the dates, the star anise or the vegetable stock. It was alot of trouble for a bland dinner.  One more thing, star anise pods become like little pieces of plastic floating around in the dish and they are almost impossible to pick out until you have the unfortunate occasion to bite into one.   The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is because I do like couscous with onions and mushrooms :)

I love this recipe. It's easy and fast and you can change it up depending on what you have in the kitchen. I can never find whole anise so I have always used fennel. I also add either raisins or chopped, dried, apricots in addition to the dates. Delish!

Wow! This stuff is delicious. Quite the wild array of flavors and spices. I would recommend much more cinnamon and more anise but besides that puuuuurfect!

Beautiful recipe, very easy. I added some squash and, like other reviewers, added the stock and couscous into the same pot the vegetables were in.

I had to change this recipe a bit because I was missing ingredients, but what I came up with was incredible. I did not use mushrooms and I did not use red peppers only because I was serving pita and red pepper hummus with this dish. Then I used dry cayenne pepper flakes instead of whole peppers. It was a great meal and the family felt good that it was fairly healthy too. Two thumbs up here. Oh yeah I didn't have dates either so I used raisins instead. It was great.

This is really delicious.  I used one of those large dried red peppers like you see hanging in bunches, seeds and all.  It was very spicy, but we like things spicy. I used about twice the amount of mushrooms called for, just because I had some on hand I needed to use up.  Like one of the other reviewers, I just added the broth to the sauted veggies, brought it to a low boil then stirred in the couscous.  Cover and remove from heat, ready in 5 minutes.  Next time I make this, I plan to add some zucchini to the veggies already called for.  Delicious!

This is really tasty.  I only did 3 dried red peppers and it was still plenty spicy.  Also added a carrot sliced thinly and a can of garbanzo beans as the veggies were simmering.  My only complaint is that the couscous itself didn't have much flavor.  Perhaps adding a little butter or a soft cheese would do the trick.

My son's girlfriend is a vegetarian so I am always looking for new recipes to try.  This recipe was perfect.  We loved it exactly as is.  It was perfect leftover for lunch the next day.

This recipe was just okay for me. A little bland and not great for a vegetarian main dish, which is what I used it for. I didn't really enjoy eating the leftovers for lunch the next day which is unusual for me. I folled the recipe exactly. If I would ever make this again I would add chick peas for protein and texture.

Using many of the previous suggestions, I tried zucchini instead of mushrooms, used hot sauce instead of the hot peppers,  and put the couscous and vegetable stock in with the veggies.   Loved it!!!!   Served with roasted sweet potatoes.

I doubled the recipe and it yielded 5 servings. But next time I'll definitely add less couscous because I didn't like the proportions - it was too dry and not flavorful enough.

This dish had a very unique flavor.  The strongest components were anise and cinnamon, but the dates gave it a subtle sweetness.  I substituted green bell pepper for red, and melon seed pasta for couscous.  It was very enjoyable, but definitely different, and I was not sure what other type of dish might be a good complement for it.

So, so, so good. Any time of year. I didn't use the anise pods, but kept everything else the same. The little red finger peppers work beautifully. One of our favorites!
