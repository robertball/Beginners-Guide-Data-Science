I used this on a portabella, and spinach dish I make, and it was great.
Thanks.

The instructions leave a little to be desired but the sauce is a good one.   It probably should be called Cheese Sauce though.   Melt the butter, add the flour and stir and cook. Add the milk or cream - start with only a portion and stir until smooth then add the remaining milk or cream.  Stir until smooth.  Add the cheese.   Easy and no lumps.

Yum! Using havarti in a white sauce is a great idea!

It was a huge hit. I added some fresh parsley and basill, salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste. Made it for a group of 20. After I followed the instructions, I put it in a crock pit on low to keep it warm for the party and just stirred it occasionally. Turned out really good and easy for a larger group.

My family LOVES this sauce.  I use it on Chimichangas!  I think they'd eat it like soup if I let them  :)
