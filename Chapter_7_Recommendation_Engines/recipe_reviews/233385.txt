Very easy to make. I too used white wine and I added stewed tomatoes. I can see making this again and also trying it with chicken breasts. Great recipe.

I used this with salmon instead of cod, and it was the best salmon I have ever made. I left out the capers and yellow squash, used fresh basil, and subbed freshly grated parmesan for the mozzarella.

My Hubby and I like it, however I think it need a 1/2 cup white wine, some 1/2 teaspoon fresh basil. reduce it by half then add the zucchini, yellow squash and olives. Then make  per recipe. I will be making it again. pared it with Cheddar Onion Drop Biscuits. it was a nice paring. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Made it several times, always a hit. I cut back on salt and olives for my salt sensitive family. They now love cod since it turns moist and full of flavor.

The only changes I made were due to lack of ingredients on hand.  I used red, yellow and orange peppers in place of zucchini and yellow squash. Fantastic!

Slightly changed the recipe:  no capers or black olives (just don't like either), and didn't use quite as much Italian seasoning (a couple of hearty shakes tossed in with zucchini and squash was perfect).  All veggies were fresh from the garden ... and served over a bed of Jasmine rice. DELISH!  I do a lot of cooking, so my husband is used to trying new things, but this meal elicited the best comment ever:  "Hun.  I think this is the best meal you've ever made."  WINNER!  :-)

Good, but I did change the tomatoes and used 1 can of fiery diced tomatoes. Instead of the 2fresh ones. It made more sauce to put over the ride, so the rice wasn't dry!

I was looking for a fish recipe that was sugar and carb free. This was easy to prepare with ingredients I had on hand. I didn't have yellow squash or capers and had to substitute green olives since my husband doesn't like black olives. I also served a side of asparagus for some extra veggies. My husband really liked it.
